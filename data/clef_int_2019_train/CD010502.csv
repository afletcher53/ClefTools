CD010502,0,6991897,0,"Antibody levels in mothers colonised with group B streptococci during pregnancy and in their newborn infants, as measured by an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay.","An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed to measure serum antibodies to group B streptococci in 20 healthy pregnant women before delivery and in their newborn infants. The sera from 10 of these women who were colonised with group B streptococci and umbilical cord sera from their infants, had higher levels of type-specific IgG antibody than the 10 non-colonised controls and their neonates. All the babies remained well. The results demonstrate that infants from colonised mothers receive type-specific antibody. The possibility that this antibody may provide some degree of protection at birth against this potentially lethal organism warrants investigation."

CD010502,0,2257698,0,Immunologic evidence for the in situ deposition of a cytoplasmic streptococcal antigen (endostreptosin) on the glomerular basement membrane in rats.,"Endostreptosin (ESS) is an antigen derived from the cytoplasm and the plasma membrane of nephritogenic group A and to a lesser extent group C and G streptococci. It is immunologically not related to streptococcal exoenzymes or the streptococcal cell wall and can be detected on the endothelial side of the glomerular basement membrane of kidney biopsies of patients with acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (ASGN) during the early phase of the disease. Highest and most persistent antibody titers to this antigen are found in patients with ASGN. Immunoaffinity isolated ESS was injected i.v. into the tail vein of Wistar Furth (W/FU) rats for up to five successive days. The animals were sacrificed on days 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12. Frozen sections of the rat kidneys were tested by immunofluorescence against rabbit anti-ESS-antibody and against sera from patients who had recently recovered from ASGN as well as against anti-rat-IgG and C3. The basement membranes of rat kidneys were positive for ESS deposition starting from day one on, but were negative for anti-rat IgG and C3 during the first four days. Rats sacrificed on days 8-12 showed increasing deposition of IgG and C3 with decreased staining for ESS. The sera of rats sacrificed on days 1-3 had no detectable anti-ESS antibodies; whereas animals from day 4 on had low levels of anti-ESS antibodies as determined by microcomplement fixation. Control animals showed no staining for ESS, IgG, C3 as well as no detectable anti-ESS antibodies."
CD010502,0,2257699,0,Decrease in mean platelet survival time in acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (APSGN).,"In an attempt to study further the possible participation of platelets in the pathogenesis of acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (APSGN), we studied the platelet survival time, as an index of platelet activation, in 22 patients with APSGN. Mean platelet survival time was computed from the disappearance of radioactivity from blood, sampled serially after injection of autologous 51Cr-labelled platelets. C1q solid phase ELISA and conglutinin (K) solid phase ELISA were used to measure the serum levels of immune complexes. The platelet survival time in APSGN patients was 113 +/- 10 h vs 197 +/- 10 h in the control group (p less than 0.001); 68% of the patients had a shortened platelet survival, lower than 95% confidence limit. There was a significant increase in the platelet survival in the six patients that were studied after recovery from acute nephritic syndrome. There was no significant association between the mean platelet times survival and CICs (circulating immune complexes). Similarly, no significant correlation was found between the mean platelet lifespan and the severity of the glomerular disease, as assessed by the serum creatinine level and the proteinuria. These results support evidence of platelet activation and consumption in APSGN and we suggest that this activation occurs in the glomeruli capillary wall, due to platelet-vascular wall interaction."

Potassium thiocyanate was used as an extracting agent. Nontype-specific antigens of the thiocyanate extract purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation were examined by immunodiffusion in agar gel. The thiocyanate extracts were found to contain several nontype-specific protein antigens part of which were absent from the HCl-extracts. No group A streptococcal polysaccharide was found in the thiocyanate extracts.

CD010502,0,2085376,0,Domain structure and molecular flexibility of streptococcal M protein in situ probed by limited proteolysis.,"Serologically distinct group A streptococcal M proteins, the antiphagocytic determinants of the bacteria, have a highly repetitive sequence and exhibit a heptad periodicity characteristic of alpha-helical coiled-coil proteins. Based on the differences in the pattern of hepatad periodicity, the coiled-coil region of the complete M molecule has been divided into three distinct domains: I, II, and III. Domains I and II together constitute the variable part of M protein, whereas domain III is conserved among serotypes. Pepsin treatment of the M5, M6, and M24 streptococci results in a preferential cleavage of their M molecules between the predicted domains II and III, releasing biologically active fragments of the respective M proteins. Thus, a pepsin cleavage site at the junction of their variable and conserved regions is conserved in the M5, M6, and M24 proteins. In contrast, in the case of the M49 streptococci, the primary site of pepsin cleavage was observed to be within the conserved region of the M49 molecule, rather than at the junction of its variable and conserved regions. Despite containing part of the conserved region, the PepM49 protein is significantly smaller than the pepsin fragments of the M5, M6, and M24 proteins, which contain only the variable regions. However, in addition to the major PepM49 species, the pepsin digest of the type-49 streptococci also contained a smaller fragment, PepM49/a, as a minor component. Its formation was extremely sensitive to the pH of pepsin digestion. PepM49/a, which retains both the propensity to attain an alpha-helical conformation and the opsonic antibody epitope of the M49 molecule, contains only domains I and II like the other PepM proteins. Thus, as in the M5, M6, and M24 proteins, a pepsin cleavage site at the junction of the variable and conserved regions is indeed present in the M49 molecule, but is much less accessible relative to the other serotypes. Thus, the pepsin cleavage sites in the M protein correlate quite well with the boundaries of structurally distinct domains reflected by the predictive analysis. These sites apparently represent the flexible/hinge regions of the molecule. PepM49/a is the least repetitive and the shortest of the M protein pepsin fragments isolated so far. These results suggest that the flexibility of the interdomain regions in M protein may be dependent on the molecular size of their variable domains.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

A newly developed indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay compares the antibody responses against two antigen preparations of GBS-serotypes Ia, Ib, II and III in the cord sera of cervico-vaginal GBS-carriers and non-carriers during pregnancy. Antibody responses in GBS-positive women against both antigen preparations were found to be significantly higher than in GBS-negative women (p less than 0.005). Antibody levels towards the EDTA-antigen were markedly lower than levels for the HCl-antigen thus indicating two different antibody responses."

CD010502,0,22719253,0,Role of the Group B antigen of Streptococcus agalactiae: a peptidoglycan-anchored polysaccharide involved in cell wall biogenesis.,"Streptococcus agalactiae (Group B streptococcus, GBS) is a leading cause of infections in neonates and an emerging pathogen in adults. The Lancefield Group B carbohydrate (GBC) is a peptidoglycan-anchored antigen that defines this species as a Group B Streptococcus. Despite earlier immunological and biochemical characterizations, the function of this abundant glycopolymer has never been addressed experimentally. Here, we inactivated the gene gbcO encoding a putative UDP-N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate:lipid phosphate transferase thought to catalyze the first step of GBC synthesis. Indeed, the gbcO mutant was unable to synthesize the GBC polymer, and displayed an important growth defect in vitro. Electron microscopy study of the GBC-depleted strain of S. agalactiae revealed a series of growth-related abnormalities: random placement of septa, defective cell division and separation processes, and aberrant cell morphology. Furthermore, vancomycin labeling and peptidoglycan structure analysis demonstrated that, in the absence of GBC, cells failed to initiate normal PG synthesis and cannot complete polymerization of the murein sacculus. Finally, the subcellular localization of the PG hydrolase PcsB, which has a critical role in cell division of streptococci, was altered in the gbcO mutant. Collectively, these findings show that GBC is an essential component of the cell wall of S. agalactiae whose function is reminiscent of that of conventional wall teichoic acids found in Staphylococcus aureus or Bacillus subtilis. Furthermore, our findings raise the possibility that GBC-like molecules play a major role in the growth of most if not all beta-hemolytic streptococci."

CD010502,0,17895966,0,Identification of upper respiratory tract pathogens using electrochemical detection on an oligonucleotide microarray.,"Bacterial and viral upper respiratory infections (URI) produce highly variable clinical symptoms that cannot be used to identify the etiologic agent. Proper treatment, however, depends on correct identification of the pathogen involved as antibiotics provide little or no benefit with viral infections. Here we describe a rapid and sensitive genotyping assay and microarray for URI identification using standard amplification and hybridization techniques, with electrochemical detection (ECD) on a semiconductor-based oligonucleotide microarray. The assay was developed to detect four bacterial pathogens (Bordetella pertussis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae) and 9 viral pathogens (adenovirus 4, coronavirus OC43, 229E and HK, influenza A and B, parainfluenza types 1, 2, and 3 and respiratory syncytial virus. This new platform forms the basis for a fully automated diagnostics system that is very flexible and can be customized to suit different or additional pathogens. Multiple probes on a flexible platform allow one to test probes empirically and then select highly reactive probes for further iterative evaluation. Because ECD uses an enzymatic reaction to create electrical signals that can be read directly from the array, there is no need for image analysis or for expensive and delicate optical scanning equipment. We show assay sensitivity and specificity that are excellent for a multiplexed format."
CD010502,0,10979907,0,Contrasting molecular epidemiology of group A streptococci causing tropical and nontropical infections of the skin and throat.,"Disease caused by group A streptococci (GAS) in tropical regions often takes the form of impetigo, whereas pharyngitis tends to predominate in temperate zones. GAS derived from asymptomatic throat infections and pyoderma lesions of rural Aboriginal Australians were evaluated for phylogenetic distant emm genes, which represent ecological markers for tissue site preference. On the basis of the percentage of total isolates from a given tissue, emm pattern A-C organisms exhibited a stronger predilection for the throat, whereas pattern D organisms preferred the skin. Only 16% of isolates collected by active surveillance displayed pattern A-C, which reflects the low incidence of oropharyngeal infection. Importantly, most (70%) pattern A-C organisms were isolated from skin sores, despite their innate tendency to infect the throat. Combined with findings from nontropical populations, analysis of the data supports the hypothesis that GAS tissue preferences are genetically predetermined and that host risk factors for infection strongly influence the differential reproduction of individual clones."
CD010502,0,2204901,0,Throat culture or rapid strep test?,"Clearly, rapid tests for streptococci identification are here to stay, and development of the technology is likely to continue. The most rational use of these tests is to identify streptococcal pharyngitis when patients have severe symptoms or when special situations warrant early detection. Throat culture alone is sufficient for most other patients, and all negative rapid tests should be confirmed by throat culture. Specific antistreptococcal therapy should be initiated if either the rapid test or culture is positive. If the physician decides on the basis of clinical criteria to treat pharyngitis with an antibiotic that covers group A beta-hemolytic streptococci, a rapid test is not necessary. If confirmation of the infection is warranted in these cases, throat culture alone should suffice. No rapid strep test kit clearly outperforms others. With any test, good results depend on the quality of the specimen."
CD010502,0,2827043,0,A case of IgA nephropathy associated with adeno- and herpes simplex viruses.,"We report here an adult case of IgA nephropathy associated with episodes of recurrent tonsillitis. Various kinds of viral antigens were examined in the renal and tonsillar tissues by immunofluorescence. Granular depositions of adeno- and herpes simplex viral antigens were detected in the glomerular mesangial areas and in the tonsillar epithelial cells by immunofluorescence. IgA and IgA1 deposits were also observed in the glomerular mesangial areas. It was suggested that IgA nephropathy might be caused by multiple antigenic substances, including adeno- and/or herpes simplex viruses, located in the tonsillar regions."
CD010502,0,9922998,0,[Acute articular rheumatism in the child in 1997].,"Nine cases of rheumatic fever were seen from 1982 to 1996. The diagnosis was based on Jones criteria. Four of eight children had carditis characterized by mitral regurgitation with or without aortic regurgitation and/or atrioventricular conduction disturbances. The outcome was favorable in all the patients who had carditis initially; one of the patients without initial carditis developed permanent cardiac lesions during a recurrence with carditis. In industrialized countries, the incidence of rheumatic fever declined starting early in the XXth century, then dropped sharply after World War II, and is now extraordinarily low (mean annual incidence, 0.5/100,000 schoolage children). In developing countries, by contrast, rheumatic fever was recognized only after World War II and remains endemic (mean annual incidence, 100 to 200/100,000 schoolage children), contributing a substantial proportion of cases of cardiovascular disease. The diagnosis is difficult and rests on clinical grounds since there is no specific laboratory test. Diagnostic delays are potentially serious. Acute attacks should be managed as therapeutic emergencies. Prevention of recurrences rests on long-term antimicrobial therapy. Rheumatic fever is a disease process resulting from an inappropriate immune response to pharyngitis due to a beta-hemolytic group A streptotoccus (BHAS). A low standard of living may be a factor in developing countries but fails to explain the epidemic flares seen in these areas or the residual background incidence in industrialized countries. A role of host-related susceptibility to the disease has not been demonstrated. The type-specific surface M protein, the main factor associated with high virulence, carries a specific epitope on its distal portion. Rheumatogenic strains have been identified; most produce mucoid colonies. At a given point in time, within a given serotype, the virulence of a specific strain increases. Temporal and spatial variations of observed types contribute additional complexity. Adhesion of the organisms is followed by release of streptococcal degradation products that share antigenic determinants with human tissues including the heart, the synovium, and the neurons. The hyaluronate capsule and M protein of the organisms are capable of initiating immune responses; their presentation to CD4+ T-cells results in lymphokine production, an acute phase humoral response, and a cell-mediated response potentially responsible for permanent valvular damage. In France, the standard of care is to prescribe antimicrobial therapy to all patients with pharyngitis or tonsillitis without performing tests to identify the causative agent. The introduction of tests for the rapid recognition in routine clinical practice of BHAS, which account for only 20 to 30% of all cases of pharyngitis and tonsillitis, should allow a more rational approach to the treatment of these infections. Reserving antimicrobial therapy to those patients with BHAS should not result in an increase in the incidence or rheumatic fever."

CD010502,0,7596313,0,Protective immunity to the group A Streptococcus may be only strain specific.,"M protein enables Group A streptococci to resist phagocytosis. Protective immunity is considered to be mediated by opsonic antibodies directed against this M protein. In recent studies we have shown that genetically distinct populations exist within an M-type. The question asked in this study was whether human and rabbit type specific M1 antibody was opsonic for all strains of M-type 1, irrespective of their restriction fragment length polymorphism type. When locating a blood donor from among our staff for use in the indirect bactericidal test, selective variation in opsonic ability was demonstrated by one person. Subsequent testing of 44 randomly selected human sera revealed that 11 (25%) had opsonic antibody. Of these 11, 6 opsonised all seven strains and 5 demonstrated selective opsonisation. We conclude that opsonic antibody is not necessarily type specific but may be strain specific."

CD010502,0,1428591,0,Distribution characteristics of immunoglobulin-secreting cells in adenoids. Relationship to age and disease.,"Forty-four adenoids and 52 palatine tonsils from 71 children and adolescents (age 3-21 years) undergoing surgery because of adenoidal hypertrophy or recurrent tonsillitis were examined for the presence of immunoglobulin-secreting cells (ISC) employing an enzyme-linked immunospot assay (ELISPOT). ISC constituted less than 2% of the mononuclear cell population. Adenoids contained IgG, IgA, and IgM ISC in significantly lower numbers than palatine tonsils. The predominant isotype of the ISC was IgG, in adenoids accounting for 62% of the ISC and in palatine tonsils for 73%. The relative numbers for IgA and IgM ISC were similar. A significant correlation existed between autologous adenoids and palatine tonsils for the numbers of IgA and IgM ISC, but not for the numbers of IgG cells. These observations suggest that, adenoid and palatine tonsils display similar immunoglobulin distribution patterns within a single individual. However, individuals with hypertrophied adenoids exhibited a numeric decrease in IgG ISC with increasing age (P less than 0.01). Both lymphoid tissues may be involved in mucosal immune defense."
CD010502,0,9602217,0,Restricted usage of the T-cell receptor V beta repertoire in tonsillitis in association with palmoplantar pustulosis.,"Focal infections such as chronic tonsillitis or dental caries occasionally play a role in the induction or exacerbation of palmoplantar pustulosis (PPP). Arthro-osteitis is sometimes a complication in severe cases of PPP. To study the effects of bacterial infection on the exacerbation of cutaneous lesions and arthralgia, we investigated the T-cell receptor V beta repertoire in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and tonsil tissue after tonsillectomy in 4 cases, who had chronic tonsillitis and a history of exacerbation of cutaneous lesions following a sore throat. First, serum levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-8 were measured before and after tonsillectomy by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Second, 3H-TdR incorporation was used to examine the effects of the culture supernatant on the PBMC of the autologous patients, other PPP patients without tonsillitis and normal controls. T-cell receptor V beta repertoire was examined by the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction method. Results showed that IL-8 was significantly high in the serum and abundantly released from tonsillar lymphocytes, which may play a role in the accumulation of neutrophils in lesional skin. T-cell receptors V beta 6 and 12 were preferentially expressed on tonsillar lymphocytes, and V beta 4, 7, 9, 17 and 18 were detected relatively frequently. These data suggest that restricted usage of T-cell receptor V beta subsets may play a crucial role in the induction of tonsillitis associated with PPP."
CD010502,0,3950543,0,Antibodies to basement membrane collagen and to laminin are present in sera from patients with poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis.,"Sera from patients with poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN) known to have antibodies to proteoglycans were studied for the presence of antibodies against other basement membrane (BM) components. BM collagen (type IV) was isolated in the native state by extracting bovine anterior lens capsule (ALC) with 0.5 M acetic acid. The 7-S (collagenous) domain and the NC-1 (noncollagenous) domain of type IV collagen were obtained after bacterial collagenase digestion of ALC followed by gel filtration. Laminin was isolated from the mouse EHS tumor and fibronectin from human plasma. Immunologic studies, using an ELISA and electroimmunoblot, revealed the presence of antibodies that reacted with intact, native type IV collagen and the 7-S collagenous domain of this molecule. Reaction with the NC-1 (noncollagenous) domain was minimal, and not higher than that obtained with control sera. Laminin reaction strongly with the patients' sera, but fibronectin did not. Unlike sera from patients with Goodpasture syndrome, which contain antibodies primarily against the NC-1 (noncollagenous) domain of type IV collagen, sera from patients with acute PSGN contain antibodies against all the major macromolecular components of BM. This difference in immunologic reactivity may account for the observed differences in the pathologic picture at the glomerular level."

They bind exclusively to the lymphocytic TCR V beta portion, are not processed by macrophages, are related to dependent HLA but not restrained HLA and are able to stimulate a hugh number of lymphocytes, leading them to destruction. Different microorganisms (toxins from S. aureus, S. pyogenes, M. arthritidis, etc. produce a high number of superantigens, which have been associated with infectious diseases, especially by HIV.

CD010502,0,2131168,0,A rapid diagnosis of anaerobic infection in the oro-maxillary region by gas-liquid chromatography.,"The relationship between volatile fatty acids (VFAs) in pus and infecting bacterial species was examined in order to establish a rapid identification system for anaerobic microorganisms in purulent inflammation in the oro-maxillary region. VFAs were detected by the direct injection of pus into gas-liquid chromatography (GLC). Bacterial examination was carried out by anaerobic culture using blood agar plates. The bacterial identification was carried out mainly according to the VPI manual. Analysis of the direct VFA patterns of each sample resulted in 5 groups. The following bacterial species were the main isolates in each group: Streptococcus intermedius in Group A, Peptostreptococcus micros in Group B, Fusobacterium nucleatum in Group C, Bacteroides gingivalis in Group D, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius in Group E. The profile of VFAs produced in the PYG culture medium of the above isolated bacteria was compared with the direct VFA patterns. Agreement ratios between direct and PYG VFA patterns were as follows: Group A, 47.1%; Groups B and C, 45.0%; Group D, 87.5%; and Group E, 62.9%. The acetic acid concentration was more than 14 x 10(-4) meq/ml in Group B, the butyric acid concentration was more than 7 x 10(-4) meq/ml in Group C, and the iso-caproic acid concentration was more than 14 x 10(-4) meq/ml in Group E. In these cases, it was found that the agreement ratios between the direct and PYG FVA pattern were high. In Group D, irrespective of the concentration of iso-valeric acid detected, the agreement ratio was very high. The antibiotic susceptibility of the isolates was studied. Efficiency rates of ABPC, PIPC, CCL, CEZ, CMZ, SBT/CPZ, JM, CLDM, MINO and GM were relatively low and resistant rates were high for the gram-negative rods."

The results of the LightCycler PCR and the Directigen method were independently compared to the results of the accepted ""gold standard,"" bacterial culture. The sensitivities, specificities, and positive and negative predictive values for this comparison were as follows: for the Directigen method, 55, 99, 97, and 93%, respectively; for the LightCycler PCR, 93, 98, 88, and 99%, respectively. In no case was a throat swab positive by both the LightCycler PCR and the Directigen method but negative by culture. The medical histories of patients whose throat swabs were negative by culture but positive by either the LightCycler PCR (n = 7) or the Directigen method (n = 1) were reviewed. All of these patients had signs or symptoms compatible with GAS disease, and therefore, all of these discordant positive results (along with positive results by either the Directigen method or the LightCycler PCR that agreed with the culture results) were counted as true positives for statistical analysis. For this analysis, the LightCycler PCR detected more true-positive results than the culture method (58 versus 55 swabs); however, this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.5465). In contrast, statistically significantly more true-positive results occurred by culture than by the Directigen method (55 versus 31 swabs; P < 0.0001) and by the LightCycler PCR than by the Directigen method (58 versus 31 swabs; P < 0.0001). The LightCycler PCR is a suitable stand-alone method for the detection of GAS from throat swabs. Additionally, this method requires less than half the personnel time and the procedure can be completed in considerably less time ( approximately 1 h) than our standard approach (up to 2 days) for detection of GAS in throat swabs (i.e., testing by the Directigen method with negative results verified by culture)."
CD010502,0,2404953,0,Coregulation of type 12 M protein and streptococcal C5a peptidase genes in group A streptococci: evidence for a virulence regulon controlled by the virR locus.,"Group A streptococci express at least two surface-associated virulence factors, the antiphagocytic M protein and the antichemotactic streptococcal C5a peptidase (SCP). Preliminary evidence suggested that the biosynthesis of these two proteins is coordinately controlled and subject to simultaneous phase variation. To explore this possibility further, a series of phase-switching and phase-locked M- variants were assayed for SCP by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay inhibition and for SCP-specific mRNA by dot blot hybridization. All M- cultures produced diminished amounts of SCP antigen and specific mRNA, whereas revertants produced quantities equivalent to those of the wild-type M+ culture. A phase-locked strain that harbors a deletion in a region upstream of the M12 and SCP genes, termed the virR locus, failed to produce SCP antigen or SCP-specific transcripts. The SCP-specific transcript produced by M+ bacteria was shown by Northern (RNA) blot hybridization to be 4 kilobases in size, distinguishing it from the transcript which encodes M protein. These data demonstrate that phase switching of both SCP and M12 proteins is at the transcriptional level and that expression is under the control of the upstream virR locus. We propose that the genetic determinants of these proteins and of colony morphology comprise a virulence regulon."
CD010502,0,2081094,0,Differential signal requirements in T-cell activation by mitogen and superantigen.,"The requirement for co-stimulatory molecules in T-cell stimulation by mitogens and superantigens in the absence of antigen-presenting cells (APC) was investigated. Phytohemagglutinin (PHA) induced interleukin (IL)-2 receptor (IL-2R) expression on purified T-cells, but proliferation occurred only when exogenous IL-2 was added. In contrast, the proliferative response to a pepsin-extracted type 5 M-protein from Streptococcus pyogenes (pep M5), a recently identified superantigen, required signals provided by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), IL-1 and IL-6. pep M5 alone did not induce IL-2R expression; however, when combined with PMA, IL-1 and IL-6, IL-2R was expressed. Differences were also observed in the response of the leukemic T-cell line, Jurkat, to PHA and pep M5. Soluble PHA, but not pep M5, induced IL-2 production by these cells in the presence of PMA. Cross-linking by its specific antibody or adsorption of pep M5 to microtiter plates was required to activate Jurkat cells. Both PHA and pep M5 induced Ca2+ mobilization in Jurkat cells; however, only PHA induced a rise in intracellular Ca2+ in purified T-cells, whereas pep M5 was unable to induce this activity unless IL-1, IL-6 and PMA were added. Our data provide biochemical evidence that mitogenic and superantigenic stimulation of T-cells is different."
CD010502,0,6206091,0,Immunological studies of post-streptococcal sequelae. Evidence for presence of streptococcal antigens in circulating immune complexes.,"Since elevated levels of circulating complexes have been noted to occur in the sera of patients with post-streptococcal sequelae, the possibility that these complexes contained streptococcal antigens within the complex was investigated. Sera from these patients were precipitated with polyethylene glycol to extract a fraction rich in these complexes, which was then injected into rabbits. The rabbit sera were then reacted with both cellular and extracellular fractions obtained from streptococcal strains associated with either acute post-streptococcal nephritis (APSGN) or acute rheumatic fever (ARF) by using immunoelectrophoresis and ELISA techniques. The data demonstrate that both ARF and APSGN complexes contain streptococcal antigens. However, APSGN complexes react uniquely to certain extracellular antigens present in those strains associated with nephritis, while ARF complexes react specifically to certain streptococcal extracellular antigens excreted by strains associated with rheumatic fever. Neither of the two groups of complexes appear to contain streptococcal antigens related to any cellular antigens derived from the group A streptococcus. Additionally, a rabbit serum immunized with streptococcal extracellular products reacted directly with complexes isolated from nephritis patients. Removal of the gamma globulin by absorption with an anti-human Fc serum resulted in the concomitant loss of reactivity with the anti-streptococcal serum, strongly suggesting an intimate association of the streptococcal antigen with these complexes. The presence of streptococcal antigens within the circulating immune complex of patients with APSGN coupled with their specific presence in those strains associated with post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis argues strongly for a causal role of these antigens in the disease process."
CD010502,0,11039878,0,Production of interferon-gamma by tonsillar mononuclear cells in IgA nephropathy patients.,"Much evidence, both in vivo and in vitro, suggests that patients with IgA nephropathy (IgAN) have enhanced IgA production. We hypothesized that Haemophilus parainfluenzae (HP) in the tonsil plays an important role in the IgA production of IgAN patients. In this study, we focused on interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and IgA production by tonsillar mononuclear cells (TMC) in patients with IgAN. Tonsillectomies were performed in patients with IgAN and chronic tonsillitis (CT). The induction of IFN-gamma and IgA in vitro by TMC from IgAN patients was compared with that from CT patients. In addition, we investigated whether stimulation with the outer membranes of HP (OMHP) enhanced IFN-gamma and IgA induction by TMC from patients with IgAN. Spontaneous IFN-gamma production and spontaneous total IgA production by TMC were higher in IgAN patients than in those patients with CT (p < 0.05). IFN-gamma induction by OMHP stimulation was also higher in IgAN patients than in CT patients. The stimulation of OMHP enhanced HP-specific IgA in IgAN but had no influence on the production of IFN-gamma in patients with either IgAN or CT compared with spontaneous IFN-gamma production. IFN-gamma production was positively correlated with total IgA values in both IgAN and CT patients, but not with HP-specific IgA. These results suggest that increased IFN-gamma production in patients with IgAN is not associated with HP infection but may play a role in the pathogenesis of IgAN."
CD010502,0,2466896,0,Tropomyosin shares immunologic epitopes with group A streptococcal M proteins.,"Tropomyosin is an alpha-helical coiled-coil protein with structural similarities to the streptococcal M protein. In order to show serologic cross-reactivity between streptococcal M proteins and tropomyosin, we selected from a panel of murine mAb those which reacted with M proteins and tropomyosins in the ELISA. Western blots were used to study the reactions of each mAb with human and rabbit cardiac and rabbit skeletal tropomyosins. The antibodies were further characterized for their reactions with the additional autoantigens myosin, actin, keratin, and DNA. Five mAb were found which reacted with either PepM5 or ColiM6 protein and tropomyosin in Western blots or ELISA. Two of the tropomyosin positive mAb were also antinuclear antibodies and were inhibited with DNA. In Western blots of cardiac tropomyosins, the mAb reacted with either the 70-kDa dimer of tropomyosin, the 35-kDa monomer, or both. Some differences were observed in the reactions of the mAb with the different tropomyosins in Western blots. The heart cross-reactive epitopes shared between M proteins and tropomyosin were in most instances shared with cardiac myosin. Differences were observed among the reactions of the mAb with the different tropomyosins. This report constitutes the first evidence of serologic cross-reactivity between streptococcal M proteins and tropomyosins."
CD010502,0,8350770,0,Development and evaluation of capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for detection of immunoglobulin G and M antibodies to group A streptococcal antigens.,"Capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) were developed to detect immunoglobulin G and M antibodies to group A streptococcal (GAS) antigens, streptolysin O, streptokinase, and group A carbohydrate. The sensitivities and the specificities of the IgM capture ELISAs to each GAS antigen were high enough to distinguish the patients with GAS infections (diagnosed as GAS pharyngitis or scarlet fever) from the control groups (healthy people and patients with pharyngitis from whom GAS could not be isolated). On the other hand, the specificities of the IgG capture ELISAs were not very effective in diagnosis of GAS infections. When the capture ELISA and an indirect ELISA detecting IgM antibodies to group A carbohydrate were compared, false-positive reactions due to rheumatoid factor occurred in the indirect ELISA, but did not occur in the capture ELISA. These results indicate that the capture ELISA works better than the indirect ELISA in detecting the IgM antibody, and that the IgM capture ELISA to GAS antigen provides a rapid and highly reliable serodiagnosis for GAS infections employing only a single serum."
CD010502,0,14761243,0,Lipid core peptide technology and group A streptococcal vaccine delivery.,"The antiphagocytic surface M protein of group A streptococcus has been widely studied as the major candidate antigen for a vaccine to prevent group A streptococcus infection. Approaches that have proven to be effective in animal models include the use of multi-epitope vaccines incorporating highly variable amino terminal serotypic determinants, those based on the carboxy terminal conserved region and combination vaccines incorporating both serotypic and conserved region determinants of the M protein. The use of lipid core peptide technology is at the forefront of this research in the quest to develop a broad-strain protective vaccine that can be delivered via the mucosal route, stimulating mucosal and systemic immunity. This review aims to cover the various strategies and technologies that have been investigated with regard to group A streptococcus vaccine design and development."

CD010502,0,20231435,0,Induction of TGF-beta1 and TGF-beta1-dependent predominant Th17 differentiation by group A streptococcal infection.,"Recurrent group A Streptococcus (GAS) tonsillitis and associated autoimmune diseases indicate that the immune response to this organism can be ineffective and pathological. TGF-beta1 is recognized as an essential signal for generation of regulatory T cells (Tregs) and T helper (Th) 17 cells. Here, the impact of TGF-beta1 induction on the T-cell response in mouse nasal-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT) following intranasal (i.n.) infections is investigated. ELISA and TGF-beta1-luciferase reporter assays indicated that persistent infection of mouse NALT with GAS sets the stage for TGF-beta1 and IL-6 production, signals required for promotion of a Th17 immune response. As predicted, IL-17, the Th17 signature cytokine, was induced in a TGF-beta1 signaling-dependent manner in single-cell suspensions of both human tonsils and NALT. Intracellular cytokine staining and flow cytometry demonstrated that CD4(+) IL-17(+) T cells are the dominant T cells induced in NALT by i.n. infections. Moreover, naive mice acquired the potential to clear GAS by adoptive transfer of CD4(+) T cells from immunized IL-17A(+)/(+) mice but not cells from IL-17A(-)/(-) mice. These experiments link specific induction of TGF-beta1 by a bacterial infection to an in vivo Th17 immune response and show that this cellular response is sufficient for protection against GAS. The association of a Th17 response with GAS infection reveals a potential mechanism for destructive autoimmune responses in humans."
CD010502,0,11237843,0,False-positive rapid antigen detection test results: reduced specificity in the absence of group A streptococci in the upper respiratory tract.,"Rapid antigen detection tests (ADTs) are promoted for identification of group A streptococci (GAS) in the upper respiratory tract. Although debate persists about their sensitivity, most investigators consider ADTs to be highly specific. Nevertheless, reports continue to describe false-positive ADT results (positive ADT result, negative culture result). This study examined culture results from 522 adult patients with acute pharyngitis and a positive ADT result; unexpectedly, 15% had throat culture results negative for GAS. Normal bacterial flora from 30% of these ""negative"" culture results produced a positive ADT result. An ADT-reactive organism belonging to the Streptococcus milleri group was isolated from 1 culture; it carried group A carbohydrate antigen. Although S. milleri previously has been associated with false-positive ADT reactions, the frequency of this phenomenon is unknown. The present, large study suggests that false-positive ADT reactions may be more common than previously reported, an observation that must be precisely explained and epidemiologically and clinically defined."
CD010502,0,9712796,0,Immunological relationship between the class I epitope of streptococcal M protein and myosin.,"The class I epitope of streptococcal M protein is an epidemiological marker for acute rheumatic fever (ARF)-associated serotypes of group A streptococci and is recognized by anti-M protein monoclonal antibody (MAb) 10B6. Using MAb 10B6, we determined the relationship between the class I epitope of M protein and the alpha-helical coiled-coil protein myosin. MAb 10B6 reacted by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blotting with human cardiac myosin and rabbit skeletal myosin and its heavy meromyosin (HMM) subfragment. Overlapping synthetic peptides of M5 protein were used to identify the region of M5 protein recognized by MAb 10B6. Two C repeat peptides (C2A and C3) containing the amino acid sequence KGLRRDLDASREAK reacted with MAb 10B6. Partial sequence identity, RRDL, was found in the HMM fragment of myosin, which reacted with MAb 10B6. However, not all peptides of M5 protein and myosin containing the RRDL sequence reacted with MAb 10B6. ARF sera and sera from uncomplicated pharyngitis (UNC) reacted with C repeat region peptides of M protein, while acute glomerulonephritis sera were not as reactive. Affinity-purified human antibody to peptide C3 reacted with myosin. The data demonstrate that the class I epitope of M protein is immunologically cross-reactive with myosin and the HMM subfragment, and antibodies to peptide C3 and myosin were present in ARF and UNC sera."
CD010502,0,16000420,0,Variations in emm type among group A streptococcal isolates causing invasive or noninvasive infections in a nationwide study.,"Since the late 1980s several studies have described the increased incidence and severity of invasive group A streptococcal (GAS) infections. However, most studies on GAS pathogenesis have focused on information obtained during outbreaks. We analyzed isolate distribution and host susceptibility as part of a nationwide prospective surveillance study performed between January 2001 and August 2002. GAS isolates collected from 201 patients with invasive infections, 335 patients with noninvasive infections, and 17 asymptomatic carriers were characterized with respect to their emm types and superantigen genotypes. The superantigen-neutralizing capacity and levels of antibodies against streptolysin O and DNAse B were determined for isolates from the sera from 36 invasive cases and 91 noninvasive cases. emm type 1 (emm-1) isolates were significantly more common among invasive cases, whereas emm-4, emm-6, and emm-12 dominated among the noninvasive cases. The distributions of the phage-associated superantigen genes (speA, speC, speH, speI, ssa) differed among invasive and noninvasive isolates, mainly due to their linkage to certain emm types. No significant differences in serum superantigen-neutralizing capacities were observed. The levels of anti-streptolysin O and anti-DNAse B antibodies were highest in the sera from invasive cases. Our study emphasizes the importance of obtaining data during years with stable incidences, which will enable evaluation of future outbreak data."
CD010502,0,9804392,0,Effect of haptoglobin phenotypes on growth of Streptococcus pyogenes.,"The haptoglobin (Hp) 2-1 and 2-2 phenotypes have been shown to agglutinate Streptococcus pyogenes carrying the membrane antigen T4. In this study, the growth rate of two strains of Streptococcus pyogenes (T1 and T4) in human serum was compared among haptoglobin phenotypes in vitro. During incubation for 16 hours in serum of different haptoglobin types, only Hp 2-1 and Hp 2-2 sera showed an inhibitory effect on growth, Hp 2-2 being 1.85 times more potent than Hp 2-1. Growth of Streptococcus pyogenes T4 negatively correlated with the serum concentration of Hp 2-1 (r = -0.908) and Hp 2-2 (r = -0.953). Haptoglobin-depleted serum had no inhibitory effect on bacterial growth. Addition of haemoglobin and ferric citrate to the serum accelerated the growth of Streptococcus pyogenes T4 (P <0.05) but not in Hp 2-2 serum. Haptoglobin types 2-1 and 2-2 can be regarded as inhibitors of Streptococcus pyogenes growth in vitro. These data point towards a potential protective role of Hp 2-2 in Streptococcus pyogenes infection in vivo, independently of iron uptake."
CD010502,0,3300343,0,Reduction of group B streptococcal maternal and neonatal infections in preterm pregnancies with premature rupture of membranes through a rapid identification test.,"To establish the effect of rapid detection and chemoprophylaxis of group B streptococcal genital colonization in preterm gestations with premature rupture of membranes, 260 singleton pregnancies were cultured. Through the use of a rapid test based on coagulation methods, group B streptococcus was identified in 84 (32%) patients, of which 18 (7%) had heavily colonized infections. The treatment of 36 patients resulted in no cases of chorioamnionitis or neonatal sepsis compared with 11 (23%) cases of chorioamnionitis and 13 (27%) of neonatal sepsis among 48 untreated patients (p less than 0.01). Although the risk of infection was significantly higher in patients with heavily colonized infections, characterized by less than 5 hours' growth for detection, even light colonization, requiring 20 hours for detection, resulted in a 14% rate of maternal and 16% rate of neonatal infection, respectively."
CD010502,0,15572249,0,Actions of the functional upstream domain of protein F1 of Streptococcus pyogenes on the conformation of fibronectin.,"Fibronectin (Fn), discovered by Harvard's Plasma Protein Program as plasma ""cold-insoluble globulin"" in the 1940s, has attracted much interest over the past three decades. One of the most interesting features of Fn is its ability to change shape in response to various environmental conditions and interactions with other substances found in the extra-cellular space. Here we examine the potential of the functional upstream domain (FUD) of Streptococcus pyogenes protein F1 to bring about changes in structure of Fn. In particular, we investigate the accessibility of Fn's 10th type III module that contains the integrin binding RGD motif. By use of monoclonal antibodies in a competitive ELISA assay, we found that FUD interacts with the amino-terminal type I modules of Fn to unveil the cell-binding region of Fn. This conformational change was achieved at sub-equimolar ratios of FUD/Fn monomer. We discuss the functional relevance of the interaction for both Fn and S. pyogenes and correlate the results with a conformational model of Fn that arose out of a collaboration between our laboratory and that of John Ferry."

Certain serotypes of group A streptococci such as M1, M3, M5, M6, M14, M18, M19, M24 are associated with this disorder. Immunity to streptococci and to rheumatic fever depends on antibodies to the M proteins. Due to current scarcity of M-typing sera, many laboratories use T typing and opacity factor production for serotype identification of group A streptococci.

CD010502,0,8830235,0,M-related protein (Mrp) contributes to group A streptococcal resistance to phagocytosis by human granulocytes.,"The M protein has been postulated to be a major group A streptococcal (GAS) virulence factor because of its contribution to the bacterial resistance to opsonophagocytosis. Direct evidence of this was only provided for GAS strains which expressed a single M protein. The majority of GAS express additional, structurally similar M-related proteins, Mrp and Enn, which have been described as IgG- and IgA-binding proteins. To determine the involvement of Mrp and M protein in phagocytosis resistance, the mrp and emm genes from serotypes M2, M4, and M49 as well as from M-untypeable strain 64/14 were insertionally inactivated. The mrp and emm mutants were subjected to direct bactericidal assays. As judged by numbers of surviving colony-forming units, all mutant strains with the exception of the mrp4 mutant exhibited reduced multiplication factors as compared to the isogenic wild-type strains. Subsequent analysis of phagocytosis by flow cytometry, measuring association of BCECF/AM-labelled bacteria and granulocytes, paralleled the results from direct bactericidal assays regardless of whether isolated granulocytes or whole blood were utilized. Resistant wild-type GAS strains bound to less than 24% of granulocytes, whereas phagocytosis-sensitive controls attached to more than 90% of the white blood cells. 40 to 60% of the granulocytes associated with the mrp and emm mutants within 1 h of co-incubation. Kinetic data suggested that attachment to granulocytes proceeds faster for emm mutants than for corresponding mrp mutants. By adding a dihydro-rhodamine123 stain and measuring fluorescence induced by oxidative burst, the experimental data suggested that bacteria bound to granulocytes were also engulfed and integrated into phagolysosomes. Thus, these data indicated that, if present, both mrp and emm gene products contribute to phagocytosis resistance by decreasing bacterial binding to granulocytes."
CD010502,0,6386884,1,Comparison of Directigen Group A Strep Test with a traditional culture technique for detection of group A beta-hemolytic streptococci.,"The Directigen Group A Strep Test (DGAST), a new rapid method of detecting group A beta-hemolytic streptococci directly from throat swabs, was compared with a traditional culture technique for the detection of group A beta-hemolytic streptococci. Five hundred oropharyngeal swabs from pediatric and adult patients were cultured and then processed by using the DGAST. Of the 144 specimens positive by culture, 131 were DGAST positive (sensitivity, 90.9%). Of the 356 specimens negative by culture, 353 were DGAST negative (specificity, 99.2%). Twelve of the 13 false-negative DGAST results were from pediatric patients. One hundred isolates of non-group A beta-hemolytic streptococci were recovered, primarily groups C, F, and G. The DGAST is easy to perform, rapid, sensitive, and very specific for detection of group A beta-hemolytic streptococci directly from swabs. Supplementing the DGAST with a culture on a 5% sheep blood agar plate would enhance detection of group A beta-hemolytic streptococci, especially in pediatric patients."
CD010502,0,22875885,0,Development of rapid serotype-specific PCR assays for eight serotypes of Streptococcus suis.,"Streptococcus suis is an emerging zoonotic pathogen causing severe infections in pigs and humans. Thirty-three serotypes of S. suis have been identified using serum agglutination. The capsular polysaccharides synthesis (cps) locus is usually conserved among different strains of the same serotype. The cps loci of 15 serotypes have been sequenced, while the loci of the other serotypes remain unknown. In the present study, two to six serotype-specific genes of each of eight serotypes, i.e., serotypes 3, 4, 5, 8, 10, 19, 23, and 25, were identified using cross-hybridization with 93 nucleic acid probes specific to genes in the cps locus, and serotype-specific PCR assays for rapid and sensitive detection of the eight serotypes were then developed. The PCR typing results of the 148 serologically typeable isolates were completely consistent with agglutination results. Furthermore, some autoagglutinating, acapsular, and multiagglutinating strains which could not be differentiated by traditional serum agglutination assays were positive in the PCR assays. Use of the PCR assays with clinical tonsillar specimens showed that the assays are sensitive and able to identify samples with autoagglutinating isolates. To our knowledge, this is the first study to identify the serotype-specific genes of the eight Streptococcus suis serotypes and develop rapid and sensitive PCR assays for the eight serotypes which can be identified only by serum agglutination."
CD010502,0,11404377,0,Superantigen antagonist blocks Th1 cytokine gene induction and lethal shock.,"Bacterial superantigens trigger an excessive, Th1-cytokine response leading to toxic shock. We designed a peptide antagonist that inhibits SEB-induced expression of human genes for IL-2, IFN-gamma, and TNF-beta, cytokines that mediate shock. The peptide antagonist shows homology to a beta-strand-hinge-alpha-helix domain that is conserved structurally in superantigens produced by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes yet remote from known binding sites for the major histocompatibility class II molecule and T-cell receptor. For Th1-cell activation, superantigens depend on this domain. The peptide protected mice against lethal challenge with SEB or SEA. Moreover, it rescued mice undergoing toxic shock. Surviving mice rapidly developed broad-spectrum, protective immunity, which rendered them resistant to further lethal challenges with different staphylococcal and streptococcal superantigens. Thus, the lethal effect of superantigens, mediated by Th1 cytokines, can be blocked with a peptide antagonist that inhibits their action at the top of the toxicity cascade, before activation of T cells takes place."

CD010502,0,17965349,0,Evaluation of the ability of erythromycin-resistant and -susceptible pharyngeal group A Streptococcus isolates from Spain to enter and persist in human keratinocytes.,"The macrolide-resistance rate among group A Streptococcus (GAS) isolates has increased in some European countries. To investigate the reasons for this increase, the ability of 60 erythromycin-resistant and 61 erythromycin-susceptible, genetically unrelated, pharyngeal GAS isolates from Spain to enter and persist within human keratinocytes was evaluated. It was observed that erythromycin resistance was associated with the presence of prtF1, a gene related to invasiveness, whereas no association was observed with the ability to enter human keratinocytes. However, the ability to enter human keratinocytes was not associated with the presence of prtF1 or with the emm type, suggesting that interaction with keratinocytes depends on several characteristics of the isolate. Almost all strains (95.9 %) were capable of persisting within human keratinocytes. However, most of them (91.7 %) exhibited a decline in viability over time. Interestingly, the ability to persist within keratinocytes protected from the action of the beta-lactams was higher among erythromycin-resistant isolates and correlated with their ability to avoid the induction of cellular lysis. These observations suggest that if the carrier state results from intracellular GAS survival, the association between erythromycin resistance and intracellular persistence may represent a serious problem for the eradication of these isolates."
CD010502,0,3941275,0,Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the detection of antibodies to nutritionally variant streptococci in patients with endocarditis.,"The viridans streptococci are responsible for 50%-55% of microbial endocarditis. Among these varied species, the nutritionally variant streptococci (NVS) have recently been associated with culture-negative endocarditis and are responsible for 5%-10% of all streptococcal endocarditis. The isolation and identification of these bacteria has been hampered by the extremely fastidious nature of their growth requirements as well as by their slow growth rate. In addition, their antibiotic sensitivity varies greatly, a characteristic leading to a higher rate of morbidity and mortality than is found in patients with non-NVS endocarditis. For these reasons sera from patients with NVS endocarditis were examined for antibodies to the NVS serotype I antigen by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Seventy-four percent of patients with NVS endocarditis had elevated titers to this antigen. None of the sera from controls and only 6.7% of the sera from patients with non-NVS streptococcal endocarditis showed increased titers. These results indicate that antibody to the NVS serotype I antigen can serve as a marker for NVS endocarditis."
CD010502,0,8345402,0,[Antibody titers to bacterial antigens in middle ear effusion of otitis media with effusion].,"Antibody titers against H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, S. mitis, S. sanguis, and S. salivarius in middle ear effusions (MEE) of 46 children (60 ears) with chronic otitis media with effusion (OME) are reported. H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes are predominant microorganisms in acute suppurative otitis media. S. mitis, S. sanguis, and S. salivarius are major species of normal adenoid flora. Specific antibodies against the above bacterial species were detected in all samples. In the chronic group, IgG titers against H. influenzae, IgG and IgM against S. pneumoniae, IgG and IgM against S. pyogenes, and IgG against S. salivarius were statistically higher than in the acute and subacute groups. IgG, IgM and IgA titers against S. mitis and S. pneumoniae in MEE with chronic sinusitis were higher than those from sinusitis free children. Anti-S. sanguis and S. pyogenes IgG and IgA of sinusitis free patients' MEE were higher than those with chronic sinusitis. The antibody titers against H. influenzae did not differ statistically between those with and without sinusitis. The presence of anti-bacterial antibodies inhibits acute infection in MEE, and the difference in titers with sinusitis may be caused by bacterial numbers in the adenoids and the host's response to the bacteria."
CD010502,0,19386831,0,Genetic relationships deduced from emm and multilocus sequence typing of invasive Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis and S. canis recovered from isolates collected in the United States.,"Beta-hemolytic group C and G streptococci cause a considerable invasive disease burden and sometimes cause disease outbreaks. Little is known about the critical epidemiologic parameter of genetic relatedness between isolates. We determined the emm types of 334 Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis isolates, and attempted emm typing of 5 Streptococcus canis isolates from a recent population-based surveillance for invasive isolates. Thirty-four emm types were observed, including one from S. canis. We formulated multilocus sequence typing (MLST) primers with six of the seven loci corresponding to the Streptococcus pyogenes MLST scheme. We performed MLST with 65 of the 334 surveillance isolates (61 S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis isolates, 4 S. canis isolates) to represent each emm type identified, including 2 to 3 isolates for each of the 25 redundantly represented emm types. Forty-one MLST sequence types (STs) were observed. Isolates within 16 redundantly represented S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis emm types shared identical or nearly identical STs, demonstrating concordance between the emm type and genetic relatedness. However, seven STs were each represented by two to four different emm types, and 7 of the 10 S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis eBURST groups represented up to six different emm types. Thus, S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis isolates were similar to S. pyogenes isolates, in that strains of the same emm type were often highly related, but they differed from S. pyogenes, in that S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis strains with identical or closely similar STs often exhibited multiple unrelated emm types. The phylogenetic relationships between S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis and S. pyogenes alleles revealed a history of interspecies recombination, with either species often serving as genetic donors. The four S. canis isolates shared highly homologous alleles but were unrelated clones without evidence of past recombination with S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis or S. pyogenes."
CD010502,0,6094999,0,Quantitative differences in specific binding of fibrinogen fragment D by M-positive and M-negative group-A streptococci.,"Selected M-positive and M-negative group-A streptococcal strains were investigated with respect to their selective absorption of plasmin fibrinogen degradation products (FDP) in a simple batch technique. After incubation of killed streptococci with the FDP mixture, the centrifuged supernatants were investigated by SDS-electrophoresis and the binding capacity of the strains was calculated by evaluation of the scanning curves of stained gels. It was found that there is a specific uptake of the C-terminal fragment D by both M-positive and M-negative strains. Although the M-positive strains bound more fragment D (30%-80%) than did the M-negative strains (10%-15%), it could be clearly shown that the loss of M-protein was not necessarily linked with a total disappearance of fibrinogen binding activity. Fragment D blocked the agglutination of streptococci by fibrinogen. Washing the streptococci preincubated with FDP with a 0.1 M citric acid, 6 M urea buffer, pH 3.0, restored agglutination. Treatment of FDP-incubated bacteria with this buffer was found to be a means of recovering pure fragment D from streptococcal cells. It is suggested that M-positive and M-negative streptococci have qualitatively similar binding sites. These receptors might be reduced in the M-negative streptococci. Human serum albumin and Tween 20 did not influence the interaction between streptococcus and fibrinogen."
CD010502,0,3295052,0,Stimulation of S-adenosylmethionine synthetase in human lymphocytes by streptococcal M protein.,"The effects of the specific antigen M5 protein of group A streptococci on AdoMet synthetase activity and AdoMet levels in peripheral blood (PB) lymphocytes were studied and were compared with the effects of the nonspecific polyclonal T cell mitogen PHA. M5 protein stimulated AdoMet synthetase activity, whereas PHA had a biphasic effect with an early inhibitory effect and a later stimulatory effect on AdoMet synthetase activity. S-Carbamyl-L-cysteine (SCC), an inhibitor of human lymphocyte AdoMet synthetase, reduced AdoMet levels and inhibited the blastogenic response of PB lymphocytes to both M5 protein and PHA. Inhibition of the response to M5 protein was stronger than that to PHA. However, the inhibitory effects of SCC were totally reversible by washing the cells. It is our hypothesis that such differences in the biochemical events triggered by specific antigen as opposed to a polyclonal mitogen may determine the direction of the functional differentiation of T lymphocytes."

We examined the in vitro responses of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) to streptococcal superantigens, SPEA and SPEC, and staphylococcal superantigens, SEB and TSST-1, in patients with guttate psoriasis, in patients with chronic plaque psoriasis, and in healthy subjects. PBMC from patients with guttate psoriasis responded poorly to SPEA and SPEC at concentrations of 0.1 and 1 ng/ml as compared with those from patients with plaque psoriasis, but showed high responses to SEB and TSST-1. The hyporesponsiveness recovered after improvement of the skin eruption. There was no significant difference between guttate and chronic types of psoriasis in the percentage of circulating T-cell receptor BV2 or BV8-bearing T cells, responsive to streptococcal superantigens, indicating that T-cell clonal anergy was a mechanism underlying the hyporesponsiveness. Our results suggest that superantigens released from focally infecting S. pyogenes induce a transient activation of relevant T cells, leading to the development of skin eruption and, subsequently, temporary T-cell anergy to these toxins."

This PCR assay was tested with 182 isolates of P. aeruginosa and 20 isolates of other bacterial species, and demonstrated 100% specificity and sensitivity. The test was also able to detect P. aeruginosa directly in clinical samples such as sputum or throat swabs obtained from cystic fibrosis patients. The combination of this primer with a universal bacterial primer, acting as a control to assess DNA quality in the sample, resulted in a robust PCR method that can be used for rapid P. aeruginosa detection."
CD010502,0,3522953,0,Treatment of streptococcal pharyngitis revisited.,"Penicillin has remained the drug of choice for treatment of patients with streptococcal pharyngitis for the past four decades. From the early 1950s into the 1970s, a single injection of intramuscular penicillin G benzathine, alone or in combination with penicillin G procaine, was the preferred treatment. Because this regimen consistently produced the highest cure rate and because compliance was assured, it evolved as the gold standard with which other treatment regimens were compared. In the late 1960s and the 1970s, studies showed that in private practice settings with counseling as to the need to take oral penicillin for a full ten days to prevent rheumatic fever, good compliance with results equal to intramuscular penicillin G benzathine could be achieved. By the early 1980s, oral treatment was preferred by most primary physicians in the United States. Oral penicillin V in a dosage of 250 mg, twice daily for ten days, affords optimal treatment for children. In areas where rheumatic fever is still prevalent, particularly in poor and crowded inner-city populations where medical care is episodic, follow-up may be lacking, and compliance in taking oral penicillin cannot be relied on, treatment with intramuscular penicillin G benzathine remains preferred. Studies now confirm that early treatment of streptococcal pharyngitis can reduce the duration of symptoms to less than 24 hours in most cases, decrease the incidence of suppurative complications, limit spread of the disease in the family and community, and permit earlier return of the child to school. Recently developed tests that permit rapid, laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis directly on the throat swab at the initial clinic visit may soon guide early treatment with these inherent benefits."
CD010502,0,16871906,0,[Cytomegalovirus infection with hepatic involvement in immunocompetent adults].,"We retrospectively evaluated 73 immunocompetent adult patients assisted at our Infectious Diseases Clinic between March 1999 and March 2004 who presented fever and asthenia, mild to moderate increase of transaminases and serological findings compatible with recent cytomegalovirus infection. We excluded patients with a history of transfusions, drug abuse, immunodeficiencies, preexistent hepatic impairment or serological findings compatible with acute hepatitis A, B and C (HAV, HBV, HCV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). The laboratory diagnosis of recent cytomegalovirus infection was made by especific IgM detection (ELISA) or a significant increase of specific IgG. The most frequent symptoms were fever (85%) and asthenia (83%), followed by cephalea (25%), splenomegaly (20%), adenomegalies (22%), pharyngitis (25%), myalgias (25%) and hepatomegaly (19%). All the patients showed moderate increase of transaminases and lymphomonocytosis (73/73). In average, ALT was increased by 6 fold and AST by 3.5 fold. The clinical characteristics that differentiate CMV infection from Epstein-Barr infection are the lesser frequency of adenomegalies and pharyngitis in the former. The differential diagnosis of CMV infection with hepatic involvement from acute hepatitis A and B, is based on the absence of jaundice, the lower elevation of transaminases, the intense lymphomonocytosis and the presence of specific IgM against CMV that are characteristic of CMV infection. In conclusion, in previously healthy young adults with fever, intense asthenia, lymphomonocytosis and moderate increase in transaminases levels, cytomegalovirus infection should be investigated."
CD010502,0,3017661,0,[Immunohistochemical and cytochemical analysis of lymphocytes and plasma cells in nasopharyngeal carcinoma].,"Cytoplasmic IgA+, IgG+ and IgM+ in plasma cells, present in biopsy tissue of 68 patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and 40 patients with chronic nasopharyngitis (CN), were studied by immunoperoxidase (PAP) technique. EB virus VCA-IgA serum antibody in all these patients was determined. At the same time, the activity of T lymphocytes of 41 patients (23 with NPC and 18 with CN) was investigated by alpha-naphthyl acetate esterase (ANAE) method. The number of T lymphocytes in NPC was far less than that in CN. This suggests that the impediment or deficiency in cellular immunity may promote the development and growth of tumor. The number of IgA+ plasma cells in NPC was obviously more than that in CN. As the increase in the level of VCA-IgA serum antibody in NPC patients corresponded to the increase in the number of IgA+ plasma cells in the tumor tissue, it was presumed that part of the IgA+ plasma cells might participate in the production and introduction of VCA-IgA antibody. We suggest that the examination of VCA-IgA serum antibody be a reliable screening test for NPC. No significant difference was found in the numbers of IgG+ plasma cells between NPC and CN. IgM+ plasma cells were rare in both."

CD010502,0,19580415,0,Nosocomial transmission of invasive group a streptococcus from patient to health care worker.,Nosocomial transmission of group A streptococcus (GAS) has been well described. Instances resulting in fulminant disease among health care workers have not been described. Contact and droplet precautions have been advised to minimize the risk of nosocomial transmission. We aimed to determine whether a case of invasive GAS pneumonia and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome in a respiratory therapist was acquired as a result of caring for a patient with GAS necrotizing fasciitis. Contacts of these patients were screened to determine if they were the reservoir of the GAS. Genetic testing to confirm clonal transmission was conducted.

One of the aims was to demonstrate how this method could be used effectively in screening patients at risk and preventing the spread of antigenic bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae b, Streptococcus (Strep b), and Neisseria meningitidis (mainly group c and b). A total of 2,837 patients were screened for bacterial infections; 908 (32%) were male and 1,929 (68%) were female. The age range was between 2 and 70 years. Of the total group, 356 (12.5%) patients were positive; 203 (57%) were female while 153 (43%) were male (male/female ratio of 1:1.3). Medically underserved and immune suppressed populations are the most affected by these bacterial infections. Blacks are the most affected (48%) compared to Native Americans (1%), but children under 10 years of age have the highest incidence. This research showed, in addition, that the Wellcogen Rapid Tests are effective (356 cases identified) for a rapid screening of infectious bacteria. Explanation for these results was probably due to poor living conditions, poor hygiene, and viral immune suppression in adults and immature immune systems in neonates and children under 10 years of age."

CD010502,0,19863488,0,Development of conformational mimetics of conserved Streptococcus pyogenes minimal epitope as vaccine candidates.,"One of the factors responsible for the poor immunogenicity of synthetic peptide antigens is the lack of conformational integrity. Embedding the minimal epitopes in helix-promoting peptide sequences has successfully enhanced the immunogenicity of the epitopes derived from the alpha-helical regions of the M protein of group A streptococci (Streptococcus pyogenes, GAS). However, the introduction of ""foreign"" peptide sequences is believed to have an unfavourable impact on the antigen specificity. In the current study, we employed a non-peptide approach, using topological carbohydrate templates, to induce helical conformation of the peptide antigens. Utilized together with the advances of the lipid core peptide system and chemoselective ligation, five GAS vaccine candidates incorporating the minimal epitope J14i (ASREAKKQVEKALE) were synthesized with high purity. Circular dichroism studies indicated that the template-assembled peptides formed alpha-helix bundles. This atom-economic strategy also reduces the complexity and cost of vaccine production by simply reducing the peptide epitope size."

The prevalent emm types were emm1 (12.6 %), emm22 (8.7 %), emm28 (7.7 %), emm88 (7.7 %) and emm4 (6.8 %) and all isolates were susceptible to vancomycin and penicillin G. Ten per cent of the isolates were resistant to erythromycin and 3 % were resistant to erythromycin and clindamycin, showing the macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B phenotype. The emm sequences and PFGE pattern database that were generated in this study will serve as a basis for information for long-term evolutionary and epidemiological studies of local S. pyogenes recovered not only in Lebanon, but also in neighbouring countries."

The 12 cases who presented at hospital were initially assumed to have tularaemia, and all were successfully treated with gentamicin. When, however, their sera were tested for evidence of Yersinia pestis or Francisella tularensis infection (using haemagglutination, enzyme immuno-assays for specific IgM or the F1 antigen of Y. pestis, and micro-agglutination tests), all 12 were found to have anti-Y. pestis IgM. Three dogs shot near the Saudi Arabian border were also found seropositive for antibodies against Y. pestis. Eleven of the 12 patients reported that, 2-4 days before their symptoms appeared, they had eaten the meat cut from the carcass of the same camel, either raw (10 cases) or cooked (one case). All 12 patients were diagnosed as cases of pharyngeal plague (the first cases of plague reported in Jordan for more than 80 years), caused by Y. pestis that most had acquired when they ate raw meat from a camel that was infected with the pathogen."
CD010502,0,20337717,0,Development of species-specific primers for detection of Streptococcus pyogenes from throat swabs.,"A species-specific molecular marker has been developed to detect the human pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes from throat swabs. Streptococcus pyogenes is an important pathogen among Gram-positive organisms. A rapid and simple diagnostic tool is of utmost importance for the identification of this pathogen. The random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) technique was used to differentiate the S. pyogenes strains. A differentially amplified fragment obtained from RAPD profiles was sequenced and characterized, which was developed into a sequence characterized amplified region (SCAR) marker to evaluate the specificity of S. pyogenes from other species of Streptococcus. The sensitivity of the SCAR primers was studied by qualitative PCR and the detection limit was found to be 10(-1) ng of genomic DNA or one to two cells of S. pyogenes. The specificity of the primers was assayed in 270 clinical throat swabs wherein 23 samples turned to be positive, which was highly significant over culture-based methods. This species-specific primer enables accurate detection of S. pyogenes from clinical samples and will be a useful tool in epidemiological studies."

CD010502,0,16113285,0,Characterization of salivary immunoglobulin A responses in children heavily exposed to the oral bacterium Streptococcus mutans: influence of specific antigen recognition in infection.,"The initial infection of children by Streptococcus mutans, the main pathogen of dental caries, depends on the ability of S. mutans to adhere and accumulate on tooth surfaces. These processes involve the adhesin antigen I/II (AgI/II), glucosyltransferases (GTF) and glucan-binding protein B (GbpB), each a target for anticaries vaccines. The salivary immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibody responses to S. mutans antigens (Ags) were characterized in 21 pairs of 5- to 13-month-old children. Pairs were constructed with one early S. mutans-infected and one noninfected child matched by age, racial background, number of teeth, and salivary levels of IgA. Specific salivary IgA antibody response and S. mutans infection levels were then measured during a 1-year follow-up. Robust responses to S. mutans were detected from 6 months of age. Salivary IgA antibody to AgI/II and GTF was commonly detected in salivas of all 42 children. However, GbpB-specific IgA antibody was seldom detected in the subset of infected children (38.1% at baseline). In contrast, most of the subset of noninfected children (76.2%) showed GbpB-reactive IgA antibody during the same period. Frequencies of GbpB responses increased with age, but differences in intensities of GbpB-IgA antibody reactions were sustained between the subsets. At baseline, GbpB-reactive IgA antibody accounted for at least half of the total salivary IgA S. mutans-reactive antibody in 33.3 and 9.5% of noninfected and infected children, respectively. This study provides evidence that a robust natural response to S. mutans Ags can be achieved by 1 year of age and that IgA antibody specificities may be critical in modulating initial S. mutans infection."

A hypothesis was postulated that a shared antigen, such as a stress protein, might account for some of these findings. Indeed, a rabbit antiserum against a 65-kDa heat shock protein of Mycobacterium tuberculosis revealed a corresponding 65-kDa band with all six Streptococcus sanguis strains examined and S. pyogenes but not with S. salivarius. By applying a panel of nine monoclonal antibodies to the mycobacterial 65-kDa heat shock protein, an approximately 65-kDa antigen was identified in the uncommon serotypes of S. sanguis ST3 and H.83 and one with a different Mr was identified in KTH-1 and S. pyogenes. Monoclonal antibodies Y1.2, C1.1, II H9, and ML30, which reacted with these streptococci, recognize residues 11 to 27, 88 to 123, 107 to 122, and 276 to 297 of the 65-kDa heat shock protein, respectively, suggesting that these residues are conserved among some uncommon serotypes of S. sanguis and S. pyogenes. Immunoblot analyses of sera from patients with BS for immunoglobulin A (IgA) and IgG antibodies revealed bands of 65 to 70 kDa with the mycobacterial heat shock protein, S. sanguis strains, and S. pyogenes, although these reactivities were also found to a lesser extent in controls. A 65- to 70-kDa band was found more frequently with S. sanguis KTH-2 or KTH-3 and IgA in serum from patients with BS than with serum from controls (P less than 0.02). Antibodies in serum were then studied by a radioimmunoassay, and in patients with BS this revealed significantly raised IgA antibodies to the recombinant 65-kDa mycobacterial heat shock protein and to soluble protein extracts of S. sanguis ST3, KTH-1, KTH-2, and KTH-3. Whereas significant anti-65-kDa heat shock protein and anti-S. sanguis ST3 antibodies were also found in sera from patients with rheumatoid arthritis and recurrent oral ulcers, the anti-S. sanguis KTH-1, KTH-2, and KTH-3 antibodies were confined to BS. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that some of the streptococcal antigens are associated with heat shock or stress proteins, which will need to be formally established by isolating heat shock proteins from streptococci."

After pre-treatment of samples (faeces and biopsies) with a liquid medium (trypticase soy broth-TSB) containing foetal calf serum (FCS, 10%) and spectinomycin and rifampicin (TSB-SR) the first detection of B. aalborgi isolate HBS1 was observed after 48 h in the primary plates of selective blood agar modified medium (BAM) containing spectinomycin and rifampicin (BAM-SR), where growth zones were signalled by a small weakly beta-haemolytic halo. Attempts to subculture spirochaetes in agar media failed. The new HBS1 isolate was only propagated in TSB broth and at electron microscopy it showed 4 endoflagella inserted at each tapered end. The phenotypic characterization of HBS1 demonstrated absence of hippurate hydrolysis, indole production, alpha-galactosidase, alpha- and beta-glucosidase activities in accordance with the B. aalborgi type strain. Rapid identification of B. aalborgi isolate HBS1 was performed directly from faeces and rectal biopsies and subsequently from pure cultures by a genetic method based on 16S DNA restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The sequence of 16S DNA amplicon of the isolate HBS1 was found 99.2% corresponding to that of the B. aalborgi type strain. Our results encourage further investigations for the development of a suitable selective agar medium for the isolating and cultivating B. aalborgi from human specimens."

CD010502,0,20708459,0,Localization of nephritis-associated plasmin receptor in acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis.,"The nephritis-associated plasmin receptor is a recently identified nephritogenic antigen associated with acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis and proposed to play a pathogenic role, but its precise glomerular localization in acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis has not been elucidated. We therefore analyzed renal biopsy sections from 10 acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis patients by using immunofluorescence staining with anti-nephritis-associated plasmin receptor antibody and various markers of glomerular components. Nephritis-associated plasmin receptor was detected in the glomeruli of all patients, and double staining for nephritis-associated plasmin receptor and collagen IV showed nephritis-associated plasmin receptor to be predominantly on the inner side of the glomerular tufts. Nephritis-associated plasmin receptor-positive areas within glomerular tufts were further characterized with markers for neutrophils, mesangial cells, endothelial cells, and macrophages. In 6 of the patients, nephritis-associated plasmin receptor staining was seen mainly in neutrophils and to a lesser degree in mesangial and endothelial cells. In the other 4 patients, nephritis-associated plasmin receptor staining was seen mainly in mesangial cells and to a lesser degree in neutrophils and endothelial cells. In all patients, macrophages showed little staining. Elevated plasmin activity in glomerular neutrophils was identified by combining in situ zymography staining for plasmin activity and immunofluorescence staining for neutrophils. The glomerular localizations of nephritis-associated plasmin receptor and another nephritogenic antigen, streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin B, were compared by double immunofluorescence staining and found to be similar. These findings indicate the nephritogenic potential of nephritis-associated plasmin receptor and offer valuable information with respect to the pathogenic mechanism of acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis."
CD010502,0,21245448,0,Lactobacilli reduce cell cytotoxicity caused by Streptococcus pyogenes by producing lactic acid that degrades the toxic component lipoteichoic acid.,"Lactobacilli are known to prevent colonization by many pathogens; nevertheless, the mechanisms of their protective effect are largely unknown. In this work, we investigated the role of lactobacilli during infection of epithelial cells with group A streptococci (GAS). GAS cause a variety of illnesses ranging from noninvasive disease to more severe invasive infections, such as necrotizing fasciitis and toxic shock-like syndrome. Invasion of deeper tissues is facilitated by GAS-induced apoptosis and cell death. We found that lactobacilli inhibit GAS-induced host cell cytotoxicity and shedding of the complement regulator CD46. Further, survival assays demonstrated that lactic acid secreted by lactobacilli is highly bactericidal toward GAS. In addition, lactic acid treatment of GAS, but not heat killing, prior to infection abolishes the cytotoxic effects against human cells. Since lipoteichoic acid (LTA) of GAS is heat resistant and cytotoxic, we explored the effects of lactic acid on LTA. By applying such an approach, we demonstrate that lactic acid reduces epithelial cell damage caused by GAS by degrading both secreted and cell-bound LTA. Taken together, our experiments reveal a mechanism by which lactobacilli prevent pathogen-induced host cell damage."
CD010502,0,15773976,0,Human fibrinogen bound to Streptococcus pyogenes M protein inhibits complement deposition via the classical pathway.,"Human fibrinogen (Fg) binds to surface proteins expressed by many pathogenic bacteria and has been implicated in different host-pathogen interactions, but the role of bound Fg remains unclear. Here, we analyse the role of Fg bound to Streptococcus pyogenes M protein, a major virulence factor that confers resistance to phagocytosis. Studies of the M5 system showed that a chromosomal mutant lacking the Fg-binding region was completely unable to resist phagocytosis, indicating that bound Fg plays a key role in virulence. Deposition of complement on S. pyogenes occurred via the classical pathway even under non-immune conditions, but was blocked by M5-bound Fg, which reduced the amount of classical pathway C3 convertase on the bacterial surface. This property of M protein-bound Fg may explain its role in phagocytosis resistance. Previous studies have shown that many M proteins do not bind Fg, but interfere with complement deposition and phagocytosis by recruiting human C4b-binding protein (C4BP), an inhibitor of the classical pathway. Thus, all M proteins may share ability to recruit a human plasma protein, Fg or C4BP, which inhibits complement deposition via the classical pathway. Our data identify a novel function for surface-bound Fg and allow us to propose a unifying mechanism by which M proteins interfere with innate immunity."

CD010502,0,9734606,0,Immunohistochemical and serological evidence for the role of streptococcal proteinase in acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis.,We have previously demonstrated the preferential secretion of streptococcal proteinase or streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin B (SPEB) by nephritic strains of Group A streptococci isolated from the skin or throat of patients with acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (APSGN).
CD010502,0,9139932,0,Cell wall anchoring of the Streptococcus pyogenes M6 protein in various lactic acid bacteria.,"The M6 protein from Streptococcus pyogenes is the best-characterized member of a family of cell envelope-associated proteins. Based on the observation that the C-terminal sorting signals of these proteins can drive cell wall anchoring of heterologous unanchored proteins, we have cloned and expressed the emm6 structural gene for the M6 protein in various lactic acid bacteria (LAB). The emm6 gene was successfully expressed from lactococcal promoters in several Lactococcus lactis strains, an animal-colonizing Lactobacillus fermentum strain, Lactobacillus sake, and Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus. The M6 protein was efficiently anchored to the cell wall in all strains tested. In lactobacilli, essentially all detectable M6 protein was cell wall associated. These results suggest the feasibility of using the C-terminal anchor moiety of M6 for protein surface display in LAB."
CD010502,0,2546969,0,Clinical experience with cytomegalovirus isolation using conventional cell cultures and early antigen detection in centrifugation-enhanced shell vial cultures.,"A total of 1,915 clinical samples was inoculated by low-speed centrifugation into shell vials (Bartels Immunodiagnostics, Bellvue, Wash.) containing cover slip monolayers of MRC-5 fibroblasts. At 1 and 2 days postinoculation, one cover slip was stained by an indirect immunofluorescence technique using a monoclonal antibody (Biotech Research Laboratories for Dupont, Billerica, Mass.) to cytomegalovirus (CMV) early antigen (EA). Clinical samples were also inoculated into three MRC-5 or MRHF cell cultures which were observed for 30 days for the appearance of a cytopathic effect (CPE). Of 157 CMV-positive samples, 92 (59%) were identified by centrifugation-enhanced EA (CE-EA) and 131 (83%) produced a CPE. CE-EA was less sensitive than CPE for all types of samples, although 17% of CMV-positive samples were detected by CE-EA alone. Evaluation of the CMV status of patients with CE-EA-positive-CPE-negative samples indicated that these samples likely represented true CMV-positive results. The average elapsed time between culture inoculation and identification of CMV decreased as follows when both CE-EA and CPE, rather than CPE alone, were used: urines, 15 to 7 days; buffy coats, 18 to 9 days; lung samples, 13 to 8 days; throat samples, 18 to 7 days. Although CE-EA was less sensitive than 30-day cell culture, both CE-EA and CPE were identified as valuable in CMV detection, and neither could be discontinued without a decrease in the CMV isolation rate or an increase in the turnaround time."

Capsular antigens as the basis of vaccines against pathogenic bacteria.,The role of bacterial capsular antigens represented in capsular polysaccharides and exoglycans in pathogenicity and virulence of bacteria is discussed in this review. Using capsular antigens for vaccines against severe diseases caused by capsular microorganisms is considered in detail. The use of conjugates of capsular polysaccharides and their fragments with proteins and peptides for vaccine as well as using liposomes as adjuvants for the capsular antigens are described. Data concerning structural elucidation of bacterial capsular antigens are given in the first part of this review.
CD010502,0,17011180,0,Application of a unique server-based oligonucleotide probe selection tool toward a novel biosensor for the detection of Streptococcus pyogenes.,"We developed a software program for the rapid selection of detection probes to be used in nucleic acid-based assays. In comparison to commercially available software packages, our program allows the addition of oligotags as required by nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) as well as automatic BLAST searches for all probe/primer pairs. We then demonstrated the usefulness of the program by designing a novel lateral flow biosensor for Streptococcus pyogenes that does not rely on amplification methods such as the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or NASBA to obtain low limits of detection, but instead uses multiple reporter and capture probes per target sequence and an instantaneous amplification via dye-encapsulating liposomes. These assays will decrease the detection time to just a 20 min hybridization reaction and avoid costly enzymatic gene amplification reactions. The lateral flow assay was developed quantifying the 16S rRNA from S. pyogenes by designing reporter and capture probes that specifically hybridize with the RNA and form a sandwich. DNA reporter probes were tagged with dye-encapsulating liposomes, biotinylated DNA oligonucleotides were used as capture probes. From the initial number of capture and reporter probes chosen, a combination of two capture and three reporter probes were found to provide optimal signal generation and significant enhancement over single capture/reporter probe combinations. The selectivity of the biosensor was proven by analyzing organisms closely related to S. pyogenes, such as other Streptococcus and Enterococcus species. All probes had been selected by the software program within minutes and no iterative optimization and re-design of the oligonucleotides was required which enabled a very rapid biosensor prototyping. While the sensitivity obtained with the biosensor was only 135 ng, future experiments will decrease this significantly by the addition of more reporter and capture probes for either the same rRNA or a different nucleic acid target molecule. This will lead to the possibility of detecting S. pyogenes with a rugged assay that does not require a cell culturing or gene amplification step and will therefore enable rapid, specific and sensitive onsite testing."

Higher levels of antibodies, as seen in previous recipients of streptokinase therapy, cause more adverse reactions and may result in lower efficacy."
CD010502,0,6356288,0,Attachment of Streptococcus pyogenes to mammalian cells.,"Accumulated evidence indicates that lipoteichoic acid (LTA) is centrally involved in the attachment of group A streptococci to epithelial cells of the host. The binding of LTA to a variety of host cells is mediated by the glycolipid end of the LTA molecule, which can form ionic complexes with streptococcal surface proteins, permitting the reorientation of the LTA to expose some of its lipid ends toward the surface of the organism. The ability of albumin to block the adherence of streptococci to epithelial cells and to bind to LTA-M protein but not deacylated LTA-M protein complexes supports the idea that the lipid ends remain free to interact with cell membrane receptors. The cell membrane receptors appear to consist of a lipid-binding region(s) on fibronectin molecules on the surfaces of oropharyngeal epithelial cells. Although streptococci exhibit LTA-sensitive binding to phagocytic cells in a serum-free system, in the presence of serum, they do not; rather, complement bound to the streptococcal cell surface is required for recognition by phagocytes. The binding of fibrinogen to the M protein on the surface of M-rich streptococci specifically blocks the recognition of the organisms by opsonic complement components. The attachment of M-rich streptococci to phagocytic cells requires the development of antibodies directed specifically toward regions of M protein not blocked by fibrinogen."
CD010502,0,3930111,0,An idiotypic complementarity between rheumatoid factor and anti-peptidoglycan antibodies?,"Groups of BALB/c mice have been repeatedly immunized with sterile affinity-purified human rheumatoid factor (RF) preparations from high-titred seropositive rheumatoid arthritis sera. In all cases, there was an antibody response reactive with Streptococcus pyogenes cell wall peptidoglycan-polysaccharide (PG-PS) polymer in both immunodiffusion and ELISA. This antibody could be absorbed by either excess RF or PG-PS, but not by isolated human non-RF IgG or IgM preparations. Groups of mice similarly immunized with non-RF IgG or IgM produced no significant anti-PG-PS antibody response compared with pre-immune sera. All immunogens lacked detectable PG-PS. Thus, anti-PG-PS antibody may be produced by RF immunization in the absence of PG-PS. This suggests some idiotypic complementarity between RF and anti-PG-PS antibodies."
CD010502,0,12113483,0,"Distribution of emm genotypes and superantigen genes of Streptococcus pyogenes isolated in Japan, 1994-9.","The purpose of this study was to examine characteristic profiles of Streptococcus pyogenes clinical isolates isolated in Japan during 1994-9. Genotyping of the M protein (emm typing) revealed that emm types 12 and 28 were the most common among 316 isolates. Most of the emm12 isolates were isolated from mucosa, while emm58 and emm89 were from skin. Moreover, the emm3 isolates were dominant in invasive infections. The distribution of 6 superantigen genes showed that all isolates harboured the mf gene and many had the speG gene. Invasive isolates were shown to have the ssa gene at a higher rate (76%) than noninvasive (37%). The distribution of superantigens was significantly different between emm types, but not between isolation sites. These results suggest that the distribution of emm types is related to isolation site, whereas superantigen distribution is related to clinical features of S. pyogenes infections."
CD010502,0,11980963,0,"Molecular analysis of group A Streptococcus type emm18 isolates temporally associated with acute rheumatic fever outbreaks in Salt Lake City, Utah.","Acute rheumatic fever (ARF) and subsequent rheumatic heart disease are rare but serious sequelae of group A Streptococcus (GAS) infections in most western countries. Salt Lake City (SLC), Utah, and the surrounding intermountain region experienced a resurgence of ARF in 1985 which has persisted. The largest numbers of cases were encountered in 1985-1986 and in 1997-1998. Organisms with a mucoid colony phenotype when grown on blood agar plates were temporally associated with the higher incidence of ARF. To develop an understanding of the molecular population genetic structure of GAS strains associated with ARF in the SLC region, 964 mucoid and nonmucoid pharyngeal isolates recovered in SLC from 1984 to 1999 were studied by sequencing the emm gene. Isolates with an emm18 allele were further characterized by sequencing the spa, covR, and covS genes. Peak periods of ARF were associated with GAS isolates possessing an emm18 allele encoding the protein found in serotype M18 isolates. Among the serotype M18 isolates, the difference in the number of C repeats produced three size variants. Variation was limited in spa, a gene that encodes a streptococcal protective antigen, and covR and covS, genes that encode a two-component regulatory system that, when inactivated, results in a mucoid phenotype and enhanced virulence in mouse infection models. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis showed a single restriction profile for serotype M18 organisms isolated during both peak periods of ARF. In SLC, the incidence of ARF coresurged with the occurrence of GAS serotype M18 isolates that have very restricted genetic variation."
CD010502,0,8159739,0,Allelic polymorphism of emm loci provides evidence for horizontal gene spread in group A streptococci.,"Group A streptococci have a virulence regulon containing a single emm locus or two or three distinct and adjacent loci of structurally related emm family genes. The products of the emm gene cluster consist of fibrillar surface proteins, at least some of which are known to contain determinants of type specificity located in their NH2-terminal regions, lying distal to the cell surface. The emm genes can be categorized into four major subfamilies (SFs), based on structural differences within their 3' regions encoding the peptidoglycan-spanning domain. In this study, we investigate the polymorphism within the 5' region of SF-4 and SF-3 emm genes (which occupy the first and last emm positions of the gene cluster, respectively) in 22 strains representing different serotypes. Our findings indicate that unlike the centrally positioned SF-1 or SF-2 genes, SF-3 and SF-4 genes each display only limited polymorphism in their 5' regions, suggesting that their gene products may not be major contributors to type specificity. Two forms of the SF-3 gene (SF3a, SF3b) and two forms of the SF-4 gene (SF4a, SF4b) are found to exist in all four possible combinations (SF3aSF4a, SF3aSF4b, SF3bSF4a, SF3bSF4b), strongly suggesting that horizontal gene spread has contributed to the evolution of emm genes and to the generation of emm gene diversity in group A streptococci."
CD010502,0,8308811,0,Control of neonatal group B streptococcal infection.,"Group B beta-haemolytic streptococcus (GBS) is the leading cause of life-threatening perinatal infection in developed countries. As immunization of women is not yet available, selective intrapartum chemoprophylaxis appears to be the best current strategy for preventing disease. All pregnant women should be screened for GBS at 26 to 28 weeks gestation. During labour, all colonized women with risk factors for invasive GBS neonatal infection should be treated with intravenous penicillin or ampicillin. Risk factors include preterm labour, premature rupture of membranes, intrapartum fever, multiple births, prolonged rupture of membranes, maternal diabetes, previous sibling with invasive GBS disease, and maternal GBS bacteriuria. The latter two categories warrant chemoprophylaxis regardless of maternal colonization status."
CD010502,0,18245783,0,Comprehensive analysis of antibody responses to streptococcal and tissue antigens in patients with acute rheumatic fever.,"Acute rheumatic fever (ARF) is an autoimmune disease occurring in individuals following untreated group A streptococcal infection believed to be triggered by antibodies to bacterial components that cross-react with human tissues. We developed a multiplexed immunoassay for the simultaneous quantitation of antibodies to nine streptococcal-related antigens including streptolysin O (SLO), DNase B, collagen I and IV, fibronectin, myosin, group A carbohydrate, M6 protein and streptococcal C5a peptidase. Utilizing this method, we examined serum from 49 ARF, 58 pharyngitis patients and age- and sex-matched controls in samples collected at initial disease onset, and at 4 weeks, 6 months and 1 year after diagnosis. Antibody responses were significantly higher for SLO, DNase B, M6 protein, group A carbohydrate and the cross-reactive antigens collagen I and myosin in ARF compared with pharyngitis patients (P <or= 0.05). Moreover, we found significantly elevated antibody responses in the ARF patients with rheumatic heart disease to fibronectin and collagen I compared with ARF patients without heart disease. The major differences between the ARF patients with and without carditis appear to be in the immune response to the putative heart valve components, collagen I and fibronectin."

CD010502,0,2418664,0,Review of group B streptococci and their infections.,"This review article discusses the stages in the development of research on group B streptococcus (GBS), otherwise called Streptococcus agalactiae. Emphasis was placed on the bacteriology, clinical spectrum of disease, immunity to GBS infections and antibiotic susceptibility of the causative organism. The organism, first recognized by Billroth in 1873, is classified into order Eubacteriales, family Lactobacillceae, class Schizomycetes and genus Streptococcus on the basis of its biochemical and physiological characteristics. It is subdivided into types Ia, Ib, Ic, II, III, X and R on the basis of carbohydrate and protein antigens present on its cell wall. Bovine strains of GBS are found in the bovine teat while human strains are present in the female vagina, the oro-pharynx, anorectum and the external auditory canal of newborns. It could be transmitted vertically from mother to child in-utero and during parturition. Cross infection by the nursery staff could also occur during the immediate post partum period. Two types of diseases are caused in the newborn: the early disease occurring within a week of birth; and the late disease presenting during the late neonatal period. The former usually presents in the form of septicaemia while the latter presents as meningitis. Adult infections include puerperal sepsis, pyelonephritis and a wide range of other infections. Usually they are associated with other underlying clinical conditions such as malignancy, diabetes mellitus and sickle cell disease. The organism is sensitive to penicillin which is the drug choice in treating established infections by GBS. Control measures are based on treatment of cases, eradication of vaginal colonization and chemoprophylaxis of infants at risk. An effective vaccine may become available in the near future."
CD010502,0,3277152,0,False positive results with the use of chlamydial antigen detection tests in the evaluation of suspected sexual abuse in children.,"The presence of rectal or genital infection with Chlamydia trachomatis in children is frequently considered an indicator of sexual abuse. The diagnosis of chlamydial infection in these children has been complicated by the use of antigen detection methods instead of culture. We report five cases in which the use of chlamydial antigen detection tests in the evaluation of suspected child abuse gave false positive results. An enzyme immunoassay was used in two cases (Chlamydiazyme; Abbott Diagnostics) and a direct fluorescent antibody test was used in the remaining three cases (Microtrak; Syva). The sites examined were the urethra, vagina and rectum. In all cases chlamydial cultures obtained several days later with no interim antibiotic therapy were negative. Four of the five children examined were probably victims of sexual abuse. The enzyme immunoassay and direct fluorescent antibody tests have been evaluated primarily for urethral and cervical cultures from adults; neither test has been approved or evaluated for rectal or genital sites in children. At these sites use of both tests may be associated with a large proportion of false positives caused by contamination with fecal flora which can cross-react with the antibodies used in the test. These tests also have limited utility in populations where the prevalence of chlamydial infection is low (less than 10%), as has been reported for sexually abused children. Because of the medicolegal implications only ""gold standard"" methods (i.e. culture) performed by a competent laboratory should be used in evaluating chlamydial infection in sexually abused children."

CD010502,0,3514437,0,[Lymphocyte activation by bacterial biostructures: precursor of infection-induced immune phenomena and sequelae? I. lymphocyte reactions to A-streptococci].,"The pathogenesis of the nonsuppurative sequelae of bacterial infections, e.g. rheumatic fever (RF) following A-streptococcal infection and seronegative spondarthritis (SS) following enterobacterial infection, is thought to be related to 1. an unusual persistence of infection, and/or 2. direct toxic effects of bacterial toxins, and/or 3. an abnormal immune response to the inital infection. Additionally, modern working hypothesis center around more recent findings concerning the genetic predisposition (for which there are now markers in both diseases) and the various immunologically active biostructures of the bacteria. These structures consist chiefly of a. crossreactive (CR) antigens, i.e. common or similar epitopes in both bacteriae and mammalian tissues, and b. polyclonal cell activators, e.g. the polyclonal B-cell activator (PBA) which induce immunologically many nonspecific resting B-cell clones to mature into Ig secreting cells. In this paper the lymphocyte response to a wide range of bacterial cell preparations is described. Blood lymphocytes from both RF and SS patients respond to the disease-precipitating microorganism more rigorously than the controls. There are several lines of evidence that the heightened response is genetically determined. However, there are no obvious facts which can confirm the idea that the so-called cross-reactive antigen preparations induce a specific cell response to CR antigens. On the contrary, such crude cell membrane preparations are obviously composed of an antigenic mosaic and of polyclonal cell activators: lymphocytes from healthy blood donors and even from newborns respond with lymphokine production, blastogenesis and Ig secretion under certain circumstances.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD010502,0,18062652,0,Human neutrophil peptides in vaginitis/cervicitis of different etiology.,"Development of female genito-urinary infections depends on many factors, such as immune system activity, virulence of microorganism and production of factors inhibiting the growth of microorganisms. Taking into account the possibility of relapses or severe complications, it is very important to appropriately diagnose and treat infections. Because of recently observed increase of microbial resistance to antibiotics, researchers are looking for alternatives. In our study we evaluated and compared the concentration of human neutrophil peptides (HNP 1-3) in cervico-vaginal lavages (CVL), obtained from women with vaginitis/cervicitis. Swabs from the posterior vaginal fornix and from the endocervical canal as well as CVL samples were obtained from 32 patients with vaginitis/cervicitis and 29 healthy women (control group). Supernatants of CVL were used for determination of concentration of HNP by ELISA. The difference between concentrations of HNP 1-3 in studied and control groups was statistically significant (p = 0.018). The maximal concentration was determined in patients with mixed infections (28.41 ng/ml), and Group B Streptococci, GBS, (28.06 ng/ml), the minimal concentrations in cases of C. trachomatis (mean concentrations did not differ from those in the control group: 16.93 ng/ml and 16.39 ng/ml, respectively). Maximal correlation was determined for control-studied group with isolation of GBS (r = 0.79), and very high negative correlation for group of GBS - C. trachomatis (r = -0.98)."

The level of antibodies to rhamnose determinants (RD) of A-PS has been determined by the inhibition of the immunoenzyme reaction with A-PS under the influence of a variant of group A streptococcus and rhamnose disaccharides with the bonds alpha 1-2 and alpha 1-3. In patients with recurrent rheumocarditis the level of antibodies to A-PS has been shown to be considerably higher than in healthy donors having these antibodies. In acute primary rheumatism a high level of antibodies to A-PS has been detected only in a few cases, and at the same time the prevalence of antibodies to the specific RD of A-PS, bound with beta-N-acetylglucosamine, is observed. In the sera of patients with recurrent rheumocarditis and donors having a high content of antibodies to the rhamnose site of A-PS antibodies, seemingly active against at least two RD, have been detected. In acute primary rheumatism an insignificant amount of antibodies to the rhamnose site of A-PS may probably cause the autoimmune process accompanying rheumatism. This suggestion is substantiated by the previously established capacity of these antibodies for inducing the suppression of cytotoxic cell reactions to microbial antigens."

The test detects coagglutination between protein A and streptococcal antigen extracted directly from throat swabs. Of the 307 specimens tested, 66 (21.5%) were positive for group A streptococci by culture and 16 specimens (5.2%) were positive for other beta-hemolytic streptococci. The direct test agreed with the culture in 274 of 307 specimens (accuracy 89.3%). The sensitivity of the test was 86.4% (57/66), the specificity 90% (217/241), the positive predictive value 70.4% and the negative predictive value 96%. If only throat cultures with more than 100 colonies of group A streptococci per plate were considered, the sensitivity of the direct test rose to 96%. If only a strong agglutination was considered positive, the specificity of the direct test rose to 98%.

CD010502,0,12578144,1,Are current rapid detection tests for Group A Streptococci sensitive enough? Evaluation of 2 commercial kits.,"A new, 1-step, enzyme-linked immunoassay kit for detection of Group A Streptococci (GAS) in throat samples (QuickVue In-Line One-Step Strep A Test; Quidel Corporation, San Diego, CA) was evaluated for use in a study comprising 536 patients in 8 primary healthcare centres. Compared to conventional culture at the clinical microbiology laboratory, the sensitivity achieved was 73.9% and the specificity 86.8%; these figures were not affected to any major extent by broth enrichment of samples before culturing or following PCR testing of the cysteine proteinase gene for independent diagnosis of GAS. It was also found that most samples containing low numbers of GAS were missed by the rapid test. We therefore evaluated the kit in use in our area (TestPack Plus Strep A Test; Abbott Laboratories, Chicago, IL) in a separate study of 615 patients. Somewhat increased sensitivity (82.8%) and specificity (96.1%) were obtained. As current antigen tests depend on subjective judgement of test outcome, improvements in test design or provision of more detailed instructions may be desirable in order to achieve optimal results."

Extracts of cell wall (including M protein) from types M4 and M12 GAS, recombinant M6 protein, and both cell-wall and cell-membrane extracts from type M6 (M6+) GAS and its corresponding M gene deletion mutant (M6-) were tested. PBMC from psoriatic patients proliferated more strongly to cell-wall extracts from M12 versus M4 (P = 0.0348), and to M6+ versus M6- (P = 0.0019) GAS with, in most cases, moderate proliferation to recombinant M6 protein. The psoriatic response to M12 cell wall was significantly increased compared to the controls (P = 0.0032). In psoriatics, M6+ membrane extracts induced a markedly greater proliferation than those of cell wall (P = 0.0002); responses to M6+ (P = 0.0039) and M6- (P = 0.0114) membrane extracts were higher than those of the control PBMC. Both groups showed a decreased response to the M6- versus M6+ membrane extracts (P = 0.0030; P = 0.0181, respectively). This study has demonstrated that patients with psoriasis have a heightened circulating T-cell response to cell wall M protein and to non-M proteins present on the cell wall and membrane of GAS."

CD010502,0,20798480,0,M1 protein-dependent intracellular trafficking promotes persistence and replication of Streptococcus pyogenes in macrophages.,"Streptococcus pyogenes is an important human pathogen that causes a variety of diseases including life-threatening invasive diseases, such as toxic shock and deep tissue infections. Although S. pyogenes are classically considered extracellular pathogens, a clinical significance of an intracellular source has been emphasized. In patients with deep tissue infections, an intracellular reservoir of S. pyogenes within macrophages was shown to contribute to prolonged bacterial persistence. Here we demonstrate that intracellular survival of S. pyogenes in macrophages is associated with an M1 protein-dependent intracellular trafficking in the phagosomal-lysosomal pathway, which results in impaired fusion with lysosomes. The phagocytic vacuoles harbouring M1 protein-expressing bacteria not only served as a safe haven for the bacteria, but also as a replicating niche. An M1 protein-dependent modulation of macrophages was further supported by differences in NF-κB signalling between cells infected with either the wild-type or M1 protein-deficient strains, thereby indicating a suppressed inflammatory response when M1 protein was involved. Evidence of egress of bacteria out of their host cell and subsequent re-infection of new cells emphasize the importance of intracellular bacteria as a reservoir for dissemination of infection and continued tissue injury."

Recombinant streptococcal M5 protein elicited opsonic antibodies in Lewis rats, and anti-M5 antisera recognized epitopes within the B- and C-repeat regions of M5. One peptide from the streptococcal M5 protein B-repeat region (M5-B.6, amino acids 161 to 180) induced lymphocytes that responded to both recombinant M5 and cardiac myosin. Rats immunized with streptococcal M5 protein developed valvular lesions, distinguished by infiltration of CD3(+), CD4(+), and CD68(+) cells into valve tissue, consistent with human studies that suggest that RF/RHD are mediated by inflammatory CD4(+) T cells and CD68(+) macrophages. The current study provides additional information that supports the use of the rat autoimmune valvulitis model for investigating RF/RHD."
CD010502,0,17849036,0,Invasion mechanisms of Gram-positive pathogenic cocci.,"Gram-positive cocci are important human pathogens. Streptococci and staphylococci in particular are a major threat to human health, since they cause a variety of serious invasive infections. Their invasion into normally sterile sites of the host depends on elaborated bacterial mechanisms that involve adhesion to the host tissue, its degradation, internalisation by host cells, and passage through epithelia and endothelia. Interactions of bacterial surface proteins with proteins of the host's extracellular matrix as well as with cell surface receptors are crucial factors in these processes, and some of the key mechanisms are similar in many pathogenic Gram-positive cocci. Therapies that interfere with these mechanisms may become efficient alternatives to today's antibiotic treatments."

CD010502,0,10565916,0,Comparison of four clinical specimen types for detection of influenza A and B viruses by optical immunoassay (FLU OIA test) and cell culture methods.,"Although laboratory diagnosis of respiratory viruses has been widely studied, there is a relative insufficiency of literature examining the impact of specimen type on the laboratory diagnosis of influenza A and B. In a clinical study comparing the FLU OIA test with 14-day cell culture, clinical specimens from nasopharyngeal swabs, throat swabs, nasal aspirates, and sputum were obtained from patients experiencing influenza-like symptoms. A total of 404 clinical specimens were collected from 184 patients. Patients were defined as influenza positive if the viral culture of a specimen from any sample site was positive. Patients were defined as influenza negative if the viral cultures of specimens from all sample sites were negative. By this gold standard, culture and FLU OIA test results for each sample type were compared. For each of the four specimen types, the viral culture and FLU OIA test demonstrated equal abilities to detect the presence of influenza A or B virus or viral antigen. Sputum and nasal aspirate samples were the most predictive of influenza virus infection. Throat swabs were the least predictive of influenza virus infection, with both tests failing to detect influenza virus in nearly 50% of the throat samples studied."

In this study, our objective was to detect whether adenoid and/or tonsillar tissue of patients diagnosed with chronic adenotonsillitis was a reservoir for H. pylori. This study was performed with 47 patients with the diagnosis of chronic tonsillitits and adenoid hypertrophy. Helicobacter pylori was searched by rapid urease test (RUT) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Presence of H. pylori glmM gene (formerly named as ureC gene) was tested using ureC and ureC2 primers. Fifty-five specimens used in the study were made up of 35 adenoid and 20 tonsil tissues. Rapid urease test was positive in three (5.5%) specimens. Helicobacter pylori was not detected in any of the patients by PCR. Further studies are needed to clarify the possible role of H. pylori in upper aerodigestive tract diseases such adenotonsillitis."
CD010502,0,6158555,0,Immunoelectron microscopic study of the location of group-specific and protein type-specific antigens of group B streptococci.,"The ultrastructural location of the group-specific polysaccharide and the type-specific protein antigens R and X of group B streptococci was studied by means of the direct immunoferritin technique. The group-specific antigen was located on the outer wall layer. The specificity of the reaction was proved by the inhibition of labelling after absorption of the antibody-ferritin conjugate with group B polysaccharide. On the other hand, the demonstration of the polysaccharide was not sterically hindered by protein type antigens. As with group A and C streptococci the group polysaccharide could be localized on both the outer and inner surfaces of isolated walls. The protein antigens R and X were also demonstrated on the wall surface. The specificity of the reaction was ensured by making use of the enzymic sensitivity of these antigens. The location of the R protein on long filaments protruding from the cell surface resembles that of M protein of group A streptococci. In contrast to the group polysaccharide both the R and X protein antigens are localized only on the outer surface of isolated walls."
CD010502,0,3536274,0,Comparative evaluation of PathoDx Strep A test and culture for the detection of group A streptococci in pharyngeal specimens.,"The PathoDx Strep A kit, a 10-min acid extraction and latex agglutination test, was compared with routine culture for the direct detection of group A beta-hemolytic streptococci (BHS) in 414 pharyngeal specimens collected from children with pharyngitis. The results showed that the latex test compared favorably with culture for detecting group A BHS in pharyngeal specimens (sensitivity 96.7%, specificity 97.9%, and positive and negative predictive values of 97.2% and 97.4%, respectively). The comparable number of false-positive (five) and false-negative (six) latex tests along with review of patient histories suggest that these discrepant results were attributable to sampling error during specimen procurement rather than deficiencies in the latex kit. In addition, clear-cut, agglutination reactions were obtained in over 96% of positive latex tests regardless of the amount of group A BHS that was recovered by culture. The PathoDx Strep A test is a rapid, reliable noncultural alternative for the detection of group A BHS in pharyngeal specimens."

Susceptibility tests to determine MICs and analysis of the presence of erythromycin-resistant genes (mefA, ermB and ermA) and emm gene typing were performed on 466 S. pyogenes isolates from Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing and Shenzhen. Superantigen genes (speA and speC) were examined by performing PCR on isolates with the most prevalent emm genotype. All isolates were sensitive to penicillin, cefradine and ofloxacin. The highest rate of resistance was against clarithromycin (98.1 %), followed by erythromycin (97.6 %), azithromycin and clindamycin (both 97.2 %), and tetracycline (94.0 %). Among the 466 isolates, 421 (90.3 %) harboured the ermB gene, 145 (31.1 %) were speA-positive and 273 (58.6 %) were speC-positive. The speA gene was common in emm1.0 (88.8 %) and emm6.5 (83.3 %) genotypes. The speC gene was frequently observed in emm4.0 (90.0 %), emm12.0 (69.6 %), emm18.0 (66.7 %), emm22.0 (75.9 %) and emm80.0 (80.0 %) genotypes.

CD010502,0,7708671,0,Membrane cofactor protein (CD46) is a keratinocyte receptor for the M protein of the group A streptococcus.,"The pathogenic Gram-positive bacterium Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococcus) is the causative agent of numerous suppurative diseases of human skin. The M protein of S. pyogenes mediates the adherence of the bacterium to keratinocytes, the most numerous cell type in the epidermis. In this study, we have constructed and analyzed a series of mutant M proteins and have shown that the C repeat domain of the M molecule is responsible for cell recognition. The binding of factor H, a serum regulator of complement activation, to the C repeat region of M protein blocked bacterial adherence. Factor H is a member of a large family of complement regulatory proteins that share a homologous structural motif termed the short consensus repeat. Membrane cofactor protein (MCP), or CD46, is a short consensus repeat-containing protein found on the surface of keratinocytes, and purified MCP could competitively inhibit the adherence of S. pyogenes to these cells. Furthermore, the M protein was found to bind directly to MCP, whereas mutant M proteins that lacked the C repeat domain did not bind MCP, suggesting that recognition of MCP plays an important role in the ability of the streptococcus to adhere to keratinocytes."

Taking in to account the anatomic particularities the necessity of very precise roentgenographic technics in order to assess the sacro-iliac joint, especially in children because of incomplete ossification, the authors replace this pathology into the osteomyelitis in children. From the clinical aspects of the disease, with its typically localized pain, and its acute clinical and biological septicemic syndrome, the authors attempt to demonstrate that the classical idea of a delayed diagnosis, is not absolute. Even in this particular localization, an early ""up to date"" diagnosis is possible allowing rapid treatment with efficient antibiotherapy directed towards the responsible germ after their isolation (especially staphylococcus aureus).

CD010502,0,2196541,0,Latex agglutination for the rapid diagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis: use by house staff in a pediatric emergency service.,"A rapid latex agglutination (LA) method was evaluated in 2401 consecutive pediatric patients presenting to an emergency service with suspected group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis. LA tests were performed by the treating physicians, who were not blinded to the clinical condition of the children and who made therapeutic decisions based on the results of the tests. When compared with anaerobic culture, the LA method had a sensitivity of 91%, a specificity of 82%, and a positive predictive value of 43%. There was a marked seasonal variation in the positive predictive value: 62% in winter and 16% in summer. However, even in peak streptococcal pharyngitis season (January to March), basing therapy on a positive LA test leads to the unnecessary treatment of a large number of patients. Therefore, we cannot recommend the routine performance of this test by all practitioners in all clinical settings."
CD010502,0,7707331,0,Distribution of serovariants of group B streptococci in isolates from England and Norway.,"The distribution of capsular polysaccharide antigen (CHO) types, surface-exposed c proteins alpha (c alpha) and beta (c beta) and an R-protein antigen was examined in 334 group B streptococci (GBS) isolates from three groups of patients hospitalised in England and Wales or Norway. The isolates were from 108 carriers, 67 cases of neonatal infection and 154 cases of adult infection. Each group contained all CHO types (Ia, Ib, II, III, IV, V and NT); type III strains predominated except in the adult infected group. Strains within each CHO type could be further subdivided by the protein markers into five subtypes by a combined typing system. The proportion of type Ib and type III strains in the neonatal infection cases and of type Ib strains in the adult infection cases significantly outnumbered isolates of these serotypes among the carrier strains. Twenty-nine different serovariants were identified; 24, 13 and 23 serovariants among the carrier, neonatal infection and adult infection isolates, respectively. Certain CHO antigen-protein associations were identified, notably those between Ia/c alpha, Ib/c alpha beta and III/R. The proportion of invasive isolates that expressed protein was not higher than in the carrier isolates. All CHO-type Ib isolates contained a c protein, but 7% of the Ib isolates did not contain any of these proteins. These findings indicate that this combined typing approach may be useful in examining epidemiological problems associated with GBS."
CD010502,0,10680980,0,Pathogenic mechanism of acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis.,"Considerable knowledge has been accumulated regarding the characteristics of acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (APSGN), and many attempts have been made to identify a streptococcal factor or factors responsible for triggering this disease. However, the pathogenic mechanism behind APSGN remains largely unknown. As glomerular deposition of C3 is generally demonstrated before that of IgG in the disease process, it is likely that the inflammatory response is initiated by renal deposition of a streptococcal product, rather than by deposition of antibodies or pre-formed immune complexes. During recent years, a number of streptococcal products have been suggested to be involved in the pathogenic process. In this review, possible roles of these factors are discussed in the context of the clinical and renal findings most often demonstrated in patients with APSGN. Streptokinase was observed to be required in order to induce signs of APSGN in mice, and a number of findings suggest that the initiation of the disease may occur as a result of renal binding by certain nephritis-associated variants of this protein. However, additional factors may be required for the development of the disease."

The aneurysm situated at the junction of the thoracoabdominal aorta was readily detected by transesophageal echocardiography. Computed tomography and aortography were complementary to transesophageal echocardiography in establishing the diagnosis. The patient underwent successful repair and acute inflammation of the aneurysm was present at histologic examination.

One hundred and forty-one patients clinically diagnosed with pharyngeal tonsillitis were analyzed. 80 other patients diagnosed with rhino-pharyngitis were used as control groups as well as a group of 66 healthy patients. It was found that the presence of pus in the tonsils and the absence of rhinorrhea and/or a productive cough were isolated clinical variables which showed a significant difference when comparing those cases with a positive or a negative culture (P less than 0.01). These clinical data had a sensitivity and adequate negative predictive values (68 to 83% and 90 to 92%, respectively); specificity was 44 to 74% and the positive predictive value from 24 to 36%. The gathering of combined clinical indexes with different symptoms and signs, were not greater than isolated data. The coagglutination test in those cases of pharyngeal tonsillitis showed greater better specificity (98%) and positive predictive value (93%), but saw no improvement in sensitivity (72%) nor in the negative predictive value (91%), which is why when faced with a negative coagglutination test, it is still necessary to perform a throat culture due to the risk which the patient may be exposed to when no treatment is given. The analysis of the advantages and disadvantages in the routine use of coagglutination and cultures in their particular cases, allows us to conclude that in daily clinical practice the use of clinical criteria is of greater usefulness.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Improved eradication of GBS colonization and disease may involve universal screening in conjunction with rapid diagnostic technologies or other novel approaches. Given the complications and potential limitations associated with maternal intrapartum prophylaxis, however, vaccines may be the most effective means of preventing neonatal GBS disease. The global utility of conjugated GBS vaccines may be hampered by the variability of serotypes in diverse populations and geographic locations. Modern technologies, such as those involving proteomics and genomic sequencing, are likely to hasten the development of a universal vaccine against GBS."
CD010502,0,18467595,0,M protein-mediated plasminogen binding is essential for the virulence of an invasive Streptococcus pyogenes isolate.,"The human protease plasmin plays a crucial role in the capacity of the group A streptococcus (GAS; Streptococcus pyogenes) to initiate invasive disease. The GAS strain NS88.2 was isolated from a case of bacteremia from the Northern Territory of Australia, a region with high rates of GAS invasive disease. Mutagenesis of the NS88.2 plasminogen binding M protein Prp was undertaken to examine the contribution of plasminogen binding and cell surface plasmin acquisition to virulence. The isogenic mutant NS88.2prp was engineered whereby four amino acid residues critical for plasminogen binding were converted to alanine codons in the GAS genome sequence. The mutated residues were reverse complemented to the wild-type sequence to construct GAS strain NS88.2prpRC. In comparison to NS88.2 and NS88.2prpRC, the NS88.2prp mutant exhibited significantly reduced ability to bind human plasminogen and accumulate cell surface plasmin activity during growth in human plasma. Utilizing a humanized plasminogen mouse model of invasive infection, we demonstrate that the capacity to bind plasminogen and accumulate surface plasmin activity plays an essential role in GAS virulence."

The Fc-receptor-mediated clearance observed in patients (mean +/- SE) was not significantly different as compared to the control group of similar age distribution. However, the immune clearance time was significantly age-correlated in both groups (acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis, APSGN, r = 0.39, p less than 0.05; control r = 0.63, p less than 0.01). The magnitude of the Fc-specific immune clearance and the serum creatinine were also significantly correlated (r = 0.59; p less than 0.01). Circulating immune complexes (as measured by the C1q and conglutinin ELISA) did not correlate with immune clearance, which remained stable in longitudinal studies. Age-related changes in MPS Fc-receptor function could explain, at least in part, prognostic differences between children and adult patients with APSGN."

The study also looked at the prevalence of streptococcal pharyngitis in the clinic. We found that the rapid test has a sensitivity of 90.9% and a specificity of 90.7%. Viral pharyngitis is the commonest form (63%) of pharyngitis followed by Group A Beta haemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis (14.2%).

The presence of anti-PG cross-reactive antibodies was verified in patient sera by inhibition studies with the various bacterial PGs. Antibodies to nonstaphylococcal PGs were also elevated in sera from rabbits immunized with S. aureus PG. Antibodies to S. aureus PG were removed with the synthetic peptide analogs of S. aureus PG, the L-Lys-D-Ala-D-Ala, L-Lys-D-Ala, and (Gly)5 determinants, as well as with an S. aureus PG peptide fragment containing the determinants D-Ala-D-Ala and L-Lys-D-Ala. Isolated antibodies to the PG peptides, both synthetic and native, were reactive with S. aureus and S. epidermidis PGs. The antibodies to the D-Ala-D-Ala and the L-Lys-D-Ala determinants were also reactive with S. pyogenes PG, but not with PGs from M. lysodeikticus, B. subtilis, and E. coli."
CD010502,0,10517191,0,Low prevalence of the immunoglobulin-A-binding beta antigen of the C protein among Streptococcus agalactiae isolates causing neonatal sepsis.,"Streptococcus agalactiae (Group B streptococcus, GBS) is the most important pathogen causing neonatal sepsis. The role of bacterial proteins contributing to pathogenicity in GBS infections has not yet been clearly determined, but the C protein complex has been suggested to be involved in both virulence and protective immunity. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of GBS strains bearing the gene encoding for the beta antigen of the C protein among clinical isolates from 68 neonates with sepsis, 45 newborns colonized without clinical signs of infection, and 50 isolates from pregnant women. The prevalence of the beta antigen gene in all three groups was low (24% vs. 19% vs. 22%) [corrected], and the differences between groups were not statistically significant. Clinical characteristics and cytokine plasma levels did not differ between septic patients with beta antigen-positive and -negative strains. The beta-antigen gene was not found among serotype III isolates, which accounted for roughly half of all the strains isolated. Thus, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis based on the beta antigen gene seems not helpful for distinguishing invasive from colonizing GBS strains. A vaccine based on peptide antigens from the beta antigen of the C protein would most probably not provide protection against the majority of GBS isolates. When analyzing the PCR products of the C protein beta antigen gene by DNA sequencing, a genetic heterogeneity was observed, revealing small repetitive genetic elements within the amplified fragment, an observation that should be studied further."

Two IgG-binding phenotypes of group A isolates of the M1 serotype were identified. The first group expressed a surface protein that bound all four human IgG subclasses (type IIo) and was recognized by rabbit anti-serotype M1-specific antiserum but not by normal rabbit serum. The second group expressed an IgG-binding protein that was also recognized by the anti-serotype M1 antiserum but demonstrated significant nonimmune reactivity only with human IgG3 (type IIb). Analysis of extracts of the isolates for reactivity with human IgA, fibrinogen, and albumin was also performed.

Antigens was detected by slide coagglutination in 19 (82.6%) and by countercurrent immunoelectrophoresis in 20 (87.0%) of 23 cerebrospinal fluid specimens from infants with group B streptococcal meningitis at admission. After initiation of antimicrobial therapy, antigen could be detected in 11 of 19 (by slide coagglutination) and 7 of 18 (by countercurrent immunoelectrophoresis) cerebrospinal fluids. False-positive reactions were noted by slide coagglutination in one infant with S. bovis meningitis and one with group B streptococcal bacteremia without meningitis; none occurred with countercurrent immunoelectrophoresis. The commercial availiability, simplicity, sensitivity (82.6%), and specificity (96.4%) of the Phadebact slide coaggluatination test for detecting group B streptococcal antigen in cerebrospinal fluid suggest that it may be useful for the early and rapid diagnosis of group B streptococcal meningitis."

The ability to give large amounts of immunoglobulin intravenously repeatedly and in a safe fashion allows us to achieve and maintain very high levels of antibody. These high antibody levels can prevent infection in high risk individuals (e.g. the premature, the immunocompromised, the exposed susceptible), can treat a number of bacterial and viral infections heretofore considered refractory to antibody therapy and can achieve immunomodulating effects not necessarily related to specific antibody titers; these effects can be used therapeutically in disorders associated with aberrant immune responses (Kawasaki disease, idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura, etc).

CD010502,0,11895961,0,Influence of recombination and niche separation on the population genetic structure of the pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes.,"The throat and skin of the human host are the principal reservoirs for the bacterial pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes. The emm locus encodes structurally heterogeneous surface fibrils that play numerous roles in virulence, depending on the strain. Isolates harboring the emm pattern A-C marker exhibit a strong tendency to cause throat infection, whereas emm pattern D strains are usually recovered from impetigo lesions; as a group, emm pattern E organisms fail to display obvious tissue tropisms. The peak incidence for streptococcal pharyngitis and impetigo varies with season and locale, leading to wide spatial and temporal distances between throat and skin strains. To assess any impact of niche separation on genetic variation, the extent of recombinational exchange between emm pattern A-C, D, and E subpopulations was evaluated. Analysis of nucleotide sequence data for internal portions of seven housekeeping loci from 212 isolates provides evidence of extensive recombination between strains belonging to different emm pattern subpopulations. Furthermore, no fixed nucleotide differences were found between emm pattern A-C and D strains. Thus, despite some niche separation created by distinct epidemiological trends and innate tissue tropisms there is little evidence for neutral gene divergence between throat and skin strains. Maintenance of a relationship between emm pattern and tissue tropism in the face of underlying recombination suggests that tissue tropism is associated with emm or a closely linked gene."

CD010502,0,3512746,0,Assay for antibodies to group C and G streptococcal carbohydrate by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.,"An enzyme-linked immunosorbent technique was established for the assay of serum antibodies to the group C and G streptococcal group-specific carbohydrates. The antigens consisted of formamide-extracted purified polysaccharides conjugated to poly-L-lysine. By use of hyperimmune rabbit antisera to the streptococcal group-specific polysaccharides A, C, and G, a high degree of specificity was encountered for each of the antigens tested. Antibody titers to these antigens were then measured in sera of 100 normal individuals varying in age from newborn to 20 years. The mean titer of these antibodies increased significantly between the ages of 5 and 15 years and leveled off thereafter. Assay of antibodies to the group A, C, and G carbohydrates on sera of patients with antecedent group A streptococcal infections or rheumatic fever and their matched normal controls revealed significantly elevated titers for the antibody to streptococcal group A carbohydrate only in the sera of these patients. These results support the specificity of these tests and suggest their potential usefulness for providing evidence for infection by the various streptococcal serogroups in humans."
CD010502,0,1717271,0,Autoimmune determinants of rheumatic carditis: localization of epitopes in human cardiac myosin.,"Rheumatic carditis is a sequela of group A streptococcal throat infection. Although the pathogenic mechanisms which lead to heart damage in acute rheumatic fever (ARF) are not well understood, autoimmune processes have been implicated, involving molecular mimicry between streptococci and the human heart. We have studied the immunological cross-reactions between the group A Streptococcus and human heart to understand their molecular and immunological basis. Human and mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAb) and affinity-purified anti-myosin antibodies from acute rheumatic fever sera were characterized and shown to cross-react with group A streptococcal M protein and myosin. Studies of proteolytic fragments of human cardiac myosin identified sites of cross-reactivity in the rod region of the myosin heavy chain. Murine monoclonal antibodies cross-reactive with streptococcal M protein and myosin recognized epitopes located in the S2 and light meromyosin (LMM) subfragments of the heavy chain. None of the cross-reactive monoclonal antibodies recognized the S1 subfragment. One broadly cross-reactive monoclonal antibody was highly cytotoxic for heart cells in vitro and reactive with the LMM fragment. The data suggest that the cross-reactive epitopes recognized by these antibodies are conformational, dependent upon their alpha-helical structures, and potentially damaging to host tissues."
CD010502,0,11254602,0,Multilocus sequence typing of Streptococcus pyogenes and the relationships between emm type and clone.,"Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) is a tool that can be used to study the molecular epidemiology and population genetic structure of microorganisms. A MLST scheme was developed for Streptococcus pyogenes and the nucleotide sequences of internal fragments of seven selected housekeeping loci were obtained for 212 isolates. A total of 100 unique combinations of housekeeping alleles (allelic profiles) were identified. The MLST scheme was highly concordant with several other typing methods. The emm type, corresponding to a locus that is subject to host immune selection, was determined for each isolate; of the >150 distinct emm types identified to date, 78 are represented in this report. For a given emm type, the majority of isolates shared five or more of the seven housekeeping alleles. Stable associations between emm type and MLST were documented by comparing isolates obtained decades apart and/or from different continents. For the 33 emm types for which more than one isolate was examined, only five emm types were present on widely divergent backgrounds, differing at four or more of the housekeeping loci. The findings indicate that the majority of emm types examined define clones or clonal complexes. In addition, an MLST database is made accessible to investigators who seek to characterize other isolates of this species via the internet (http://www.mlst.net)."

The psoas abscess was preceded by an episode of acute pharyngitis. The M-protein gene (emm) and streptolysin S structural gene (sagA) were present in the isolate, with no significant amino acid differences from previously described sequences of M1 GAS isolates. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) showed that the isolate belonged to MLST sequence type (MLST-ST) 28, the predominant MLST-ST associated with invasive disease caused by M1 isolates."

CD010502,0,22866358,0,A 23-year-old man with fever and malaise.,"Acute infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is infrequently diagnosed, owing in large part to vague or non-specific symptoms. Among the most common of these symptoms are fever, fatigue, pharyngitis, lymphadenopathy, anorexia, arthralgia, myalgia, rash, and headache. Some patients seek no medical attention for such symptoms, and others recall no symptoms whatsoever. Physicians in all healthcare environments must maintain a high index of suspicion for HIV in the setting of these symptoms. For suspected acute infection, rapid serologic tests should be supplemented with assays of p24 antigen and/or HIV RNA viral load. We report here a case of acute HIV infection in a young man who presented with a negative rapid serologic test, as well as pancytopenia and transaminitis. We also review the epidemiology, transmission, diagnosis, and management of acute HIV infection."

A lambda ZAPII DNA library was produced from the sheared genomic DNA of S. sobrinus MUCOB 263 and six identical positive clones were identified when this library was screened with serum from a patient with endocarditis caused by a bacterium from the mutans group of streptococci. On subcloning and sequencing, a protein containing 1548 amino acids was identified with a 99.2% homology to the SpaA antigen of S. sobrinus and 68.4% homology to the PAc antigen of S. mutans."
CD010502,0,16441436,0,Integrin-linked kinase is an essential link between integrins and uptake of bacterial pathogens by epithelial cells.,"Entry of Streptococcus pyogenes or group A streptococcus (GAS) into host cells is mediated by fibronectin bound to surface proteins, M1 or PrtF1, forming a bridge to alpha5beta1 integrins. This interaction leads to cytoskeletal rearrangement and uptake of streptococci. We postulated that integrin-linked kinase (ILK), which directly associates with integrins, is the universal link between integrins and several bacterial pathogens. We showed that inhibition of ILK expression by siRNA silencing, or ILK kinase activity by chemical inhibitors or expression of a dominant negative form of ILK reduced M1-mediated invasion of epithelial cells up to 80%. To evaluate the ILK requirement for PrtF1-mediated GAS invasion, a M1-PrtF1+ recombinant strain within the M1 background was constructed. Inhibition of ILK kinase activity also significantly reduced invasion of epithelial cells by this recombinant and wild-type strain JRS4 that expresses PrtF1. In addition, impaired ILK kinase activity results in significant reduction of integrin-dependent invasion mediated by invasins of two other important pathogens, Staphylococcus aureus and Yersinia spp. This study suggests that bacterial pathogens evolved different molecules and strategies to exploit the host integrin signalling pathway for their survival."
CD010502,0,7476099,0,Characterisation of group A streptococcal isolates from tropical Australia with high prevalence of rheumatic fever: probing for signature sequences to identify members of the family of serotype 5.,"The prevalence of rheumatic heart disease (RHD) in Northern Territory Aboriginal communities is high, but there is a low isolation rate of historically rheumatic fever associated M types (such as M5) of group A streptococci (GAS). Many isolates are M non-typable (MNT). Serology suggests that the population is exposed to M5-like isolates; some RHD patients having high IgM or IgG titres to two M5 B-repeat region peptide epitopes, B1 (KQQESK) and B4 (EQKSKQ). To identify relatives of M5 in our collection of GAS, oligonucleotide probes to the B1 and B4-repeat regions shared by M5 and a local M5-like isolate, were used to screen 101 isolates for the presence of signature sequences. In all, 28% of the tropical Australian isolates contained the signature sequences, identifying members of the M5 family. The 5' region of the genes for M proteins from three members of the M5 family fell into two sequence types. Hybridisation to probes based on these sequences suggested that among tropical Australian isolates there are at least three distinct sequence types that contained the M5 signature sequences. These results suggest that a considerable number of M5 family GAS are circulating in tropical Australia."
CD010502,0,9188864,0,Detection of streptococcal class I M protein in psoriasis by confocal immunofluorescent microscopy.,"Epidemiological evidence implicates Streptococcus pyogenes (group A) infection as a common triggering stimulus for psoriasis. Unequivocal demonstration of streptococcal antigens in psoriatic skin has been difficult due to cross-reactive antigens in both normal human tissue and group A streptococci, which complicate immunohistological analysis. In this study cryostat sections of involved psoriatic skin were stained with monoclonal antibody 111-15504 to group A streptococci. The epitope recognized by this antibody was found to be specific for group A streptococci and is associated with class I M protein. Streptococcal antigens were found in the dermal papillae and epidermis of psoriatic skin lesions of 20 out 38 patients. These findings indicate that specific S. pyogenes antigen, associated with class I M protein, is often present in psoriatic lesions. Such an antigen, originating from focal infection elsewhere could be responsible for T-lymphocyte inflammatory responses triggering the development of psoriatic lesions."
CD010502,0,8846555,0,Prevention of neonatal septicaemia due to group B streptococci.,"Group B streptococcus is the leading cause of neonatal septicaemia. Major risk factors for early-onset disease are heavy maternal GBS colonization preterm delivery (and related low birthweight), preterm rupture of membranes, prelabour rupture of membranes, intrapartum fever, GBS urinary infection and low levels of maternal serum anti-GBS antibodies. Screening for maternal GBS colonization, a part of most current preventive strategies, can be targeted on all pregnant women or only on those with recognizable risk factors, and can be implemented antepartum or intrapartum. A culture in a selective broth is the 'gold standard' for detection of GBS colonization. The lower vagina (introitus) is the most suitable site for culturing, with the optional addition of an anorectal sample. The sensitivity of the available rapid GBS antigen tests for vagina samples seems too low to advocate their general use. Intrapartum prophylaxis with ampicillin, preferably targeted on GBS-colonized parturients with risk factors is, at present, the only strategy with established efficacy and safety to prevent early-onset infection. Vaginal chlorhexidine disinfection during labour in all women may, in addition offer a minor contribution to prevention. Late-onset GBS disease is unlikely to be reduced by these strategies. In the future, immunoprophylaxis may well prove to be the most safe and efficacious alternative to prevent GBS septicaemia, irrespective of age of onset, although protection of (very) preterm infants is unlikely."
CD010502,0,2986281,0,Restriction fingerprinting and serology in a small outbreak of B15 meningococcal disease among Norwegian soldiers.,"In September 1981 a soldier died from meningococcal septicemia in a military camp in Mid-Norway. Soon afterwards one of his room-mates was transferred to a military camp in Northern-Norway where he shared sleeping quarters (room 7D) with 5 other soldiers of whom 2 fell ill with meningococcal disease 1 month later. Throat cultures were obtained from all 128 soldiers at the military camp in Northern-Norway; 41 (32%) harboured meningococci in their throats. The 3 invasive isolates and the isolates from the 4 healthy carriers at room 7D were all group B and type 15 meningococci. However, by DNA fingerprinting we could identify at least 2, probably 3, different individual strains among these 7 isolates. None of these strains were isolated from soldiers outside room 7D. By use of a B15 whole-bacterium ELISA method we showed that the levels of antimeningococcal IgG antibodies in the sera of the two cases at room 7D were low (18 and 28 OD units) compared with the mean IgG levels in the sera of their 4 healthy room mates (1150 OD units) and the mean IgG in the sera from all healthy soldiers (472 OD units)."
CD010502,0,17919742,0,An indirect immunocolorimetric assay to detect rubella virus infected cells.,"An indirect immunocolorimetric assay (ICA) to detect rubella virus infected cells by the naked eye was developed. This assay was as sensitive and specific as an indirect immunofluorescent assay (IFA), could detect as little as 10 plaque forming units (pfu) of rubella virus in the initial inoculum and could detect viruses from throat swabs. This assay detected infection with viruses of all nine rubella virus genotypes available for testing. It could be utilized for virus quantitation and a neutralization assay. In addition to detecting rubella virus infection, this assay also allowed us to confirm measles virus infection. This assay should be useful for virus isolation from clinical samples."
CD010502,0,12087517,0,Diagnosis of strep throat in adults: are clinical criteria really good enough?,"The clinical manifestations of group A streptococcal and nonstreptococcal pharyngitis overlap quite broadly. For this reason, the updated Infectious Diseases Society of America practice guideline for group A streptococcal pharyngitis, published in this issue of Clinical Infectious Diseases, recommends laboratory confirmation of the clinical diagnosis by means of either throat culture or a rapid antigen detection test. However, a recently published guideline, developed by a subcommittee of the American College of Physicians-American Society of Internal Medicine (ACP-ASIM) in collaboration with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, advocates use of a clinical algorithm alone, in lieu of microbiologic testing, for confirmation of the diagnosis in adults for whom the suspicion of streptococcal infection is high. In this discussion, we examine the assumptions of the ACP-ASIM guideline, question whether its recommendations will achieve the stated objective of dramatically decreasing excess antibiotic use, and suggest that its recommendations be confirmed by clinical trials before clinicians abandon long-held teachings regarding diagnosis and management of group A streptococcal pharyngitis."
CD010502,0,19679002,0,Ribosome-component immune modulation of respiratory tract infections in children.,"More than 25% of infants in their first year of life and 18% of children aged between 1 and 4 years suffer from recurrent respiratory infections (RRIs) in Western countries. Although RRIs are self-limiting as a rule, complications may include otitis media, sinusitis, and bronchial and pulmonary infections. This study was designed to present the available data on immune modulators (defined as drugs that interact with the immune system and modulate immune function by stimulating a more rapid and effective immune response). A ribosome-component immune modulator (RCIM) designed to stimulate both specific and nonspecific immunity in children and thus prevent or alleviate RRI is also described. A narrative review of the literature was performed with a focus on clinical trials. Double-blind, placebo-controlled studies have shown that an RCIM effectively prevents recurrent bronchopulmonary and ear-nose-throat infections; in particular, the number, severity, and duration of infectious episodes and the numbers of antibiotic courses, concomitant medications, and days away from school (children) or the workplace (parents) were reduced. Use of a RCIM is clinically efficacious, incurs minimal risk of adverse events, and, thus, represents a consistent therapeutic approach for RRIs."
CD010502,0,6886490,0,Humoral reactions in human endocarditis due to Streptococcus bovis: evidence for a common S bovis antigen.,"Humoral reactions to native culture filtrates of Streptococcus bovis were studied in patients with endocarditis by means of two-dimensional crossed immunoelectrophoresis. Serum from patients with S bovis endocarditis produced eight different precipitin arcs. Lex antigen cross-reacted with sera from patients with viridans streptococcal endocarditis, and TA antigen cross-reacted with ribitol teichoic acid-positive sera from patients with Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia. One antigen, common (c), was immunoreactive with all 10 sera from S bovis-infected patients. Antibody to this antigen was not found in sera from 77 patients with gram-positive bacteremia or in 29 other control sera. Common (c) antigen was found in all strains of S bovis isolated from patients. Rabbits immunized with formalinized S bovis cells of human origin also produced antibody to common (c) antigen. Common (c) may be an important antigen of S bovis and may in fact define this organism serologically."
CD010502,0,18787689,0,Antibodies against a surface protein of Streptococcus pyogenes promote a pathological inflammatory response.,"Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS) caused by Streptococcus pyogenes is a clinical condition with a high mortality rate despite modern intensive care. A key feature of STSS is excessive plasma leakage leading to hypovolemic hypotension, disturbed microcirculation and multiorgan failure. Previous work has identified a virulence mechanism in STSS where M1 protein of S. pyogenes forms complexes with fibrinogen that activate neutrophils to release heparin-binding protein (HBP), an inducer of vascular leakage. Here, we report a marked inter-individual difference in the response to M1 protein-induced HBP release, a difference found to be related to IgG antibodies directed against the central region of the M1 protein. To elicit massive HBP release, such antibodies need to be part of the M1 protein-fibrinogen complexes. The data add a novel aspect to bacterial pathogenesis where antibodies contribute to the severity of disease by promoting a pathologic inflammatory response."
CD010502,0,14509945,0,[Present state and disadvantage of rapid diagnosis method in clinical microbiology--analysis of questionnaire survey].,"To investigate the present state and the disadvantages of rapid diagnosis methods in clinical microbiology in Japan, We have conducted a questionnaire survey of 360 medical facilities accredited by the Japanese Association for Rapid Method and Automation in Microbiology (JARMAM). Major rapid diagnosis methods being used in clinical microbiology are, in the order of its use rate, influenza virus, adenovirus, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Clostridium difficile toxin A, Rotavirus, hepatitis B virus, group A Streptococcus, RS virus, hepatitis C virus antibody. The fact found by this survey is that there is some gap between two groups, as one group views that the result of rapid diagnosis method can be considered as the final, another views that it is a supplementary diagnosis under conventional methods such as culturing. Some problems related to rapid diagnosis methods are also pointed out; how to interpret and report a test result obtained by the rapid diagnosis method when it is different from that of culture method, it can not perform antibiotic sensitivity tests, a problem of non-specific reaction, comparatively higher cost of rapid diagnosis kits. This survey finds that rapid diagnosis methods have greatly contributed to early medical treatment and appropriate therapy with its quickness, such as the use of rapid diagnosis kits for bacterial meningitis or viral infectious diseases requiring clinical urgency is highly necessitated even though some problems mentioned above exist."

CD010502,0,6392319,0,Evaluation of the Directigen Group A Strep test kit.,"The Directigen Group A Strep test kit (Hynson, Wescott, and Dunning, Baltimore, Md.) was tested for its ability to detect group A streptococci directly from 147 throat swabs. The results were compared with results from conventional culture and Lancefield serological grouping tests. The data showed that 121 of 124 culture-negative throat specimens were also Directigen negative (98%) and that 21 of 23 culture-positive specimens were Directigen positive (91%). If specimens that provided less than 10 colonies per plate of beta-hemolytic streptococci were eliminated, all of the culture-positive specimens were Directigen positive. Positive or negative results were available within 65 to 70 min of testing. The Directigen method is relatively simple to perform and easy to interpret and provides accurate assessment of the presence or absence of group A streptococci in throat swabs, with little or no cross-reactivity with other beta-hemolytic groups."
CD010502,0,12190945,0,Epidermal CD8+ T cells reactive with group A streptococcal antigens in chronic plaque psoriasis.,"Chronic plaque psoriasis is a T cell mediated disease associated with group A streptococci (GAS). We have previously shown the presence of a psoriasis-specific dermal Th1 subset that recognizes GAS antigens. To assess whether GAS-reactive T cells are also present in lesional epidermis, fresh cell suspensions or T cell lines isolated from lesional epidermis of 33 psoriasis patients were stained for intracellular interferon-gamma after stimulation with GAS antigens. The patients were typed by PCR for HLA-DR7 and HLA-Cw6 expression. A subset of GAS-reactive CD8+ T cells (2.4% +/- 2.4) was found in 14/21 (67%) fresh cell suspensions. A smaller subset of GAS-reactive CD4+ T cells (0.9% +/- 0.9) was found in 13/21 (62%) fresh cell suspensions, which was expanded in the T cell lines. There was a significant inverse correlation between the proportions of GAS-reactive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the fresh suspensions (r = -0.48, P = 0.0277). The presence of GAS-reactive CD4+ or CD8+ T cells did not correlate with HLA-DR7 or HLA-Cw6 expression, respectively. This study has demonstrated GAS-reactive CD8+, and to a lesser extent CD4+, T cell subsets in psoriatic epidermis and provides further evidence that GAS antigens may play a role in the pathogenesis of chronic plaque psoriasis."
CD010502,0,22090294,0,[Development and optimization of an in-house PCR method for molecular diagnosis of pertussis].,"Pertussis (whooping cough), caused by Bordetella pertussis is a severe, acute contagious disease of the respiratory system and it affects mostly children and also susceptible individuals of all ages. Although the conventional culture method used for diagnosis is highly specific, it has a lower sensitivity. Therefore, there is a need for a sensitive, specific and rapid method for diagnosis of pertussis. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR), introduced recently as a new approach for diagnosis of pertussis, has been shown to be more sensitive than culture method. Pertussis toxin gene (ptxA-Pr), insertion sequence genes (IS481 and IS1001), adenylate cyclase genes and structural porin and flagellin genes were chosen as targets for PCR, in different studies. This study aimed to develop and optimize a diagnostic inhouse PCR method by using primers specific for ptxA-Pr and IS481 gene regions. An in-house PCR method was developed by using primer pairs of PTp1/PTp2 specific for ptxA-Pr gene and PIp1/PIp2 specific for IS481 gene and DNAs of various bacterial reference strains. Throat samples obtained from 45 healthy individuals and B.pertussis reference strain with decreasing concentrations were mixed to constitute a group of ""representative clinical samples"" and used to test and optimize sensitivity and specificity of the method. The in-house PCR with PTp1/PTp2 primers showed a very high specificity but a low sensitivity with a value of 34.4 cfu/Rm (colony forming unit/reaction mixture). Whereas, the inhouse PCR with PIp1/PIp2 primers exhibited a low specificity due to cross-reactivity with B. Pertussis and B.bronchiseptica but much higher sensitivity with a value of 1.12 cfu/Rm. The experiments performed with the representative clinical samples yielded similar results. Simultaneously applied cultivation studies indicated the detection limit of the PCR method as 2 x 103 cfu/ml. Based on our results, the PCR targeting IS481 gene had high sensitivity while the PCR targeting ptxA-Pr gene had high specificity. It was concluded that, PCR method targeting the IS481 gene might be used for pre-diagnosis and then PCR for ptxA-Pr gene might be applied for the confirmation of B.pertussis in the molecular diagnosis of pertussis."
CD010502,0,9399523,0,Characterization of group A Streptococcus strains recovered from Mexican children with pharyngitis by automated DNA sequencing of virulence-related genes: unexpectedly large variation in the gene (sic) encoding a complement-inhibiting protein.,"Sequence variation was studied in several target genes in 54 strains of group A Streptococcus (GAS) cultured from children with pharyngitis in Mexico City. Although 16 distinct emm alleles were identified, only 4 had not been previously described. Virtually all bacteria (31 of 33 [94%] with the streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin gene (speA) had emm1-related, emm3, or emm6 alleles. The gene (sic) encoding an extracellular GAS protein that inhibits complement function was unusually variable among isolates with the emm1 family of alleles, with a total of seven variants identified. The data suggest that many GAS strains infecting Mexican children are genetically similar to organisms commonly encountered in the United States and western Europe. Sequence variation in the sic gene is useful for rapid differentiation among GAS isolates with the emm1 family of alleles."
CD010502,0,9201310,0,Circulating T cells of patients with active psoriasis respond to streptococcal M-peptides sharing sequences with human epidermal keratins.,"Psoriasis is a T-cell mediated inflammatory skin disease which has been associated with group A, beta-haemolytic streptococcal infections. Four 20 a.a. long M6-peptides sharing 5-6 a.a. sequences with human epidermal keratins were identified. To investigate the role of potentially cross-reactive T cells in the pathogenesis of psoriasis, interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and interleukin-4 (IL-4) responses of circulating T cells to these peptides were analysed by ELISPOT and RT-PCR in 14 psoriatic patients, 12 healthy individuals and six patients with atopic dermatitis (AD). Untreated psoriatic patients' responses were significantly higher to these peptides than healthy and AD controls, while responses to a control M6-peptide, not sharing sequences with keratin, were negligible in all groups. No difference was found in response to streptokinase/streptodornase (SK/SD). M6-protein and peptides exclusively elicited IFN-gamma production, with little IL-4 production, even in AD patients. Interferon-gamma responses to all the M6-peptides were abolished after successful treatment of psoriatic patients, but responses to SK/SD were unaffected. The results indicate that active psoriasis is associated with Th1-like cells responding to streptococcal M6-peptides sharing sequences with human epidermal keratin. This is consistent with the hypothesis that psoriasis may be induced and exacerbated in susceptible individuals by M-protein specific Th1-like cells that cross-react with human epidermal keratin."
CD010502,0,7615721,0,"Cost-effective, clinically relevant method for rapid identification of beta-hemolytic streptococci and enterococci.","Currently popular agglutination and coagglutination methods for the identification of beta-hemolytic streptococci, although rapid and simple to perform, are costly. Furthermore, they fail to distinguish between clinically relevant species and normal flora of the same serogroup. We investigated the use of a series of four physiologic tests to differentiate beta-hemolytic streptococci and enterococci into five clinically relevant groups. We also investigated the use of a new product, Visi-Spot, and evaluated an alternate method for the detection of beta-D-glucuronidase production. Our results suggest that for most routine processing of beta-hemolytic streptococci, physiologic tests are sufficiently rapid, more accurate, and far less costly to perform than serologic methods. The facility of our scheme is enhanced by the use of the Visi-Spot test and the substitution of a commercially available product for more traditional methods of detecting beta-D-glucuronidase."
CD010502,0,2050400,0,Virulent human strains of group G streptococci express a C5a peptidase enzyme similar to that produced by group A streptococci.,"Specific proteolytic destruction of the human chemotaxin, C5a, is a property of group A and B streptococcal pathogens. Here we show that virulent group G streptococci from human sources also express C5a peptidase activity. The enzyme responsible for this activity is approximately the same size as and is antigenically similar to that produced by group A streptococci. On the basis of Southern hybridization analysis with an internal fragment of the group A C5a peptidase gene (scpA) as a probe, a copy of this gene was found in the genome of all group G human isolates tested. Comparison of partial restriction maps of scpA and scpG revealed significant similarity between the two genes. Group G strains isolated from dogs and cows were found to lack C5a peptidase activity and did not hybridize to the scpA-specific probe. The association of this activity with three streptococcal species suggests that elimination of phagocyte chemotactic attractants is a more universal virulence mechanism than originally anticipated."

In the present study, we employed transcriptomics together with functional tests to investigate the impact of the CiaH sensor gene of the CiaRH two-component regulator on gene expression and virulence traits of serotype M49 S. pyogenes strains CS101 and 591. In parallel, we studied the effects of the immunostimulatory substance Luivac on the serotype M49 S. pyogenes transcriptome and several biological features of serotype M1, M2, M3, M6, M18, and M49 S. pyogenes strains. Overall, the transcriptome analyses allowed a swift identification of differences in transcript abundance apparently associated with the observed strain-specific changes in matrix protein binding, eukaryotic cell interactions, or biofilm formation of the ciaH mutants and of wild-type strains exposed to a commercially available substance used for preventing upper respiratory tract infections."
CD010502,0,21605704,0,Transmission probabilities and durations of immunity for three pathogenic group B Streptococcus serotypes.,"Group B Streptococcus (GBS) remains a major cause of neonatal sepsis and is an emerging cause of invasive bacterial infections. The 9 known serotypes vary in virulence, and there is little cross-immunity. Key parameters for planning an effective vaccination strategy, such as average length of immunity and transmission probabilities by serotype, are unknown. We simulated GBS spread in a population using a computational model with parameters derived from studies of GBS sexual transmission in a college dormitory. Here we provide estimates of the duration of immunity relative to the transmission probabilities for the 3 GBS serotypes most associated with invasive disease: Ia, III, and V. We also place upper limits on the durations of immunity for serotype Ia (570 days), III (1125 days) and V (260 days). Better transmission estimates are required to establish the epidemiological parameters of GBS infection and determine the best vaccination strategies to prevent GBS disease."
CD010502,0,22649539,0,Direct heme transfer reactions in the Group A Streptococcus heme acquisition pathway.,"The heme acquisition machinery in Group A Streptococcus (GAS) consists of the surface proteins Shr and Shp and ATP-binding cassette transporter HtsABC. Shp cannot directly acquire heme from methemoglobin (metHb) but directly transfers its heme to HtsA. It has not been previously determined whether Shr directly relays heme from metHb to Shp. Thus, the complete pathway for heme acquisition from metHb by the GAS heme acquisition machinery has remained unclear. In this study, the metHb-to-Shr and Shr-to-Shp heme transfer reactions were characterized by spectroscopy, kinetics and protein-protein interaction analyses. Heme is efficiently transferred from the β and α subunits of metHb to Shr with rates that are 7 and 60 times greater than those of the passive heme release from metHb, indicating that Shr directly acquires heme from metHb. The rapid heme transfer from Shr to Shp involves an initial heme donor/acceptor complex and a spectrally and kinetically detectable transfer intermediate, implying that heme is directly channeled from Shr to Shp. The present results show that Shr speeds up heme transfer from metHb to Shp, whereas Shp speeds up heme transfer from Shr to HtsA. Furthermore, the findings demonstrate that Shr can interact with metHb and Shp but not HtsA. Taken together with our published results on the Shp/HtsA reaction, these findings establish a model of the heme acquisition pathway in GAS in which Shr directly extracts heme from metHb and Shp relays it from Shr to HtsA."
CD010502,0,2162185,0,Detection of cytomegalovirus-infected cells in autopsy material by in situ hybridization.,"A non-radioactive in situ hybridization (ISH) method was elaborated to detect cytomegalovirus (CMV)-infected cells in tissue specimens processed for diagnostic routine histopathology.

Autopsy specimens obtained from an infant with acquired CMV-infection, six patients with AIDS, five patients clinically and serologically without CMV-infection, and preoperative needle core biopsies from six renal allografts served as material. ISH was specific and more sensitive when compared to immunohistochemical (IMH) detection of CMV-antigens by a monoclonal antibody. ISH was concluded to be a rapid, practical, and sensitive tool in daily diagnostic histopathology."
CD010502,0,3556444,0,Characterization of Streptococcus zooepidemicus (Lancefield group C) from human and selected animal infections.,"We assembled an international collection of strains from sporadic and epidemic human infection with Streptococcus zooepidemicus (Lancefield group C) for laboratory study. Cultural and physiological characteristics of the isolates were determined, including biotyping with the API 20 STREP test kit and susceptibility testing with penicillin, erythromycin and tetracycline. The strains were examined for bacteriocin production and sensitivity and typed with a specially developed group-C streptococcal bacteriophage system incorporating a panel of 14 phages. Results of these tests gave useful discrimination between many of the strains: differences were shown between each of the major outbreak strains, including those complicated by post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis. Serious group C streptococcal infection may be caused by S. zooepidemicus and isolates should be identified to species level; the application of a typing scheme such as this may help to distinguish epidemiological patterns of infection."
CD010502,0,9169751,0,Preferential recognition of human myocardial antigens by T lymphocytes from rheumatic heart disease patients.,"Acute rheumatic fever (ARF) and rheumatic heart disease (RHD) are autoimmune sequelae of upper respiratory infections with group A streptococci (GAS). To gain a better understanding of the pathogenesis of these diseases, we examined the in vitro proliferative responses of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from RHD patients to human myocardial proteins in a T-cell Western assay. A number of myocardial proteins fractionated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were recognized by PBMC from both patients and controls. However, PBMC from a significant percentage of RHD patients (40%) responded to a discrete band of myocardial proteins migrating with an apparent molecular mass of 50 to 54 kDa while none of the control subject PBMC responded to this protein band (P < or = 0.0001). To further investigate the link between infections with GAS and autoimmune carditis, we studied the proliferative responses of PBMC from patients and controls to myocardial proteins before and after in vitro stimulation of the cells with opsonized GAS isolated from ARF patients. Priming of PBMC with rheumatogenic GAS caused the percentage of RHD patients responding to the 50- to 54-kDa myocardial proteins to increase from 43 to 90% (P < or = 0.0284). By contrast, PBMC from control subjects failed to recognize the 50- to 54-kDa myocardial proteins even after stimulation with the opsonized streptococci (P < or = 0.0001). The assay sensitivity was increased from 40 to 90% after priming of a patient's cells with opsonized GAS, but the positive predictive value was 100% in both unprimed and primed cultures. Antibodies generated to partially purified 50- to 54-kDa myocardial proteins did not cross-react with either streptococcal homogenates, purified M protein, myosin, laminin, or vimentin, suggesting a lack of cross-reactivity at the humoral level. This study suggests that the 50- to 54-kDa myocardial proteins contain a putative antigen that is preferentially recognized by T cells from RHD patients and demonstrates that exposure to streptococcal antigens enhances the ability of patients to recognize these proteins."

CD010502,0,20827373,0,M protein and hyaluronic acid capsule are essential for in vivo selection of covRS mutations characteristic of invasive serotype M1T1 group A Streptococcus.,"The initiation of hyperinvasive disease in group A Streptococcus (GAS) serotype M1T1 occurs by mutation within the covRS two-component regulon (named covRS for control of virulence regulatory sensor kinase), which promotes resistance to neutrophil-mediated killing through the upregulation of bacteriophage-encoded Sda1 DNase. To determine whether other virulence factors contribute to this phase-switching phenomenon, we studied a panel of 10 isogenic GAS serotype M1T1 virulence gene knockout mutants. While loss of several individual virulence factors did not prevent GAS covRS switching in vivo, we found that M1 protein and hyaluronic acid capsule are indispensable for the switching phenotype, a phenomenon previously attributed uniquely to the Sda1 DNase. We demonstrate that like M1 protein and Sda1, capsule expression enhances survival of GAS serotype M1T1 within neutrophil extracellular traps. Furthermore, capsule shares with M1 protein a role in GAS resistance to human cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide LL-37. We conclude that a quorum of GAS serotype M1T1 virulence genes with cooperative roles in resistance to neutrophil extracellular killing is essential for the switch to a hyperinvasive phenotype in vivo."
CD010502,0,9510625,0,Seroprevalence of antibodies to group B streptococcal polysaccharides in Gambian mothers and their newborns.,"In developing countries, little is known about the relationship between group B streptococcal (GBS) colonization in pregnant women and serum antibody levels to capsular polysaccharide antigens of these organisms. This study examined the prevalence of antibodies to two polysaccharides of GBS, Ia and III, in 124 Gambian women with known GBS colonization at delivery and their newborns. Mean antibody levels in maternal-cord serum pairs were 4.06 +/- 0.25 micrograms/mL and 2.64 +/- 0.20 micrograms/mL for type Ia GBS, and 1.1 +/- 0.52 microgram/mL and 0.78 +/- 0.43 microgram/mL for type III GBS. Women colonized with type V GBS had significantly higher antibody levels to type III GBS than did noncolonized women, but no difference was found when these groups were compared for antibody levels to type Ia GBS. Women > or = 20 years had significantly higher antibody levels to type III GBS compared with younger women and those colonized by other GBS serotypes. Maternal antibodies to types la and III GBS were transferred across the placenta to newborns. The rarity of GBS disease in Gambia and other developing countries may be due to the prevalence of maternally derived GBS antibodies, the low prevalence of colonization with serotype III strains, or other undefined factors."
CD010502,0,16388428,0,"Streptococcus pneumoniae: epidemiology, risk factors, and clinical features.","Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common cause of both pneumonia overall and fatal pneumonia. Antibiotic resistance has developed worldwide and is most frequent in pneumococcal serotypes that are most prevalent in children (types/groups 6, 14, 19, and 23). The incidence of pneumococcal disease is the highest in children < 2 years of age and in adults > 65 years of age. Other important risk factors are chronic heart and lung disease, cigarette smoking, and asplenia. A 23-valent capsular polysaccharide vaccine and a heptavalent protein-polysaccharide conjugate vaccine are currently available. The latter is specially designed for pediatric use because small children respond poorly to polysaccharide antigens. Both vaccines are efficacious in prevention of invasive pneumococcal disease. The clinical presentation of pneumococcal pneumonia is variable, and neither clinical features nor laboratory or radiographic findings can reliably predict the etiology of pneumonia. Blood culture is the most important tool for establishing a definitive diagnosis, but Gram's stains and sputum culture are also of value in skilled hands. A recently developed urinary antigen test may provide a rapid diagnosis of pneumococcal pneumonia in adults. Penicillin (penicillin G/amoxicillin) remains the drug of choice for strains that are fully sensitive or have a moderately decreased susceptibility to penicillin, whereas cefotaxime and ceftriaxone are the first-line alternatives in cases with higher levels of resistance."
CD010502,0,9157138,0,Determination of anti-streptolysin O antibody titer by a new passive agglutination method using sensitized toraysphere particles.,"We developed a new method for determining the anti-streptolysin O (ASO) titer on the basis of a passive agglutination reaction. This new method uses Toraysphere particles sensitized with streptolysin O. This method was used to measure the ASO titer in 130 serum samples (from 31 patients with post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, 26 patients with group A streptococcal pharyngitis, 5 patients with scarlet fever, 29 patients with non-group A streptococcal pharyngitis, 20 healthy children, and 19 healthy adults). The results were compared with those obtained simultaneously by two conventional methods, the Rantz-Randall and the NA-Latex-ASL methods. The results obtained by the Toraysphere method showed an excellent correlation with those obtained by each conventional method (correlation coefficients, 0.932 for the Rantz-Randall method and 0.913 for the NA-Latex-ASL method). The performance of each method was evaluated with respect to the clinical and microbiological diagnoses for each patient. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for the Toraysphere method were 76, 84, 81, and 79%, respectively. The corresponding values for the Rantz-Randall method were 48, 78, 67, and 62%, respectively, while those for the NA-Latex-ASL method were 60, 82, 76, and 69%, respectively. Because the Toraysphere method is simple and reproducible, has a short reaction time, and has a clear-cut endpoint for the analysis, we recommend it for routine use in determining the ASO titer in the clinical microbiology laboratory."

CD010502,0,22309986,0,A new flow-cytometry-based opsonophagocytosis assay for the rapid measurement of functional antibody levels against Group B Streptococcus.,"Opsonophagocytosis is the primary mechanism for the clearance of Group B Streptococcus (GBS) by the host, and levels of opsonic antibodies may correlate with protection in preclinical models. A killing-based opsonophagocytosis assay (OPA), can be used to determine the functional activity of vaccine-induced GBS-specific antibodies. The assay, which measures the number of bacterial colonies surviving phagocytic killing in the presence of specific antibodies and complement, is rather expensive, time-consuming and poorly standardized. Here we describe a rapid, sensitive and reproducible fluorescent OPA assay (fOPA) based on flow cytometry analysis (FACS), which allows internalized bacteria to be distinguished from those associated to the plasma membrane of phagocytic cells. Fixed GBS were labeled with pHrodo™, a fluorescent dye which dramatically increases the emitted fluorescence at the acidic conditions present in the phagocytic endosomal compartment. Labeled bacteria were incubated with HL-60 cells differentiated to phagocytes, antibodies and complement, and then analyzed by FACS. A further improvement to our method, allowing to reduce assay variability, consisted on a step of selection of effector cells among the HL-60 population. Analysis of sera from mice immunized with different GBS vaccines revealed comparable sensitivity and specificity with the traditional killing OPA assay (kOPA), and a good correlation between the fluorescent signal of bacteria internalized by HL-60 phagocytes and killing. Remarkably, the pHrodo-based approach reduced the variability observed with other fOPA assays. The obtained data indicate the proposed fOPA as a reliable and useful tool for functional antibody assessment."
CD010502,0,7517905,0,Antigenic diversity within a family of M proteins from group A streptococci: evidence for the role of frameshift and compensatory mutations.,"The genes (emm) encoding M proteins, from isolates of group-A streptococci (GAS) serotyped as M52, M53, M80 and M nontypeable (MNT; serologically related to M53 and M80), were examined. Characterization of emm from these GAS revealed some discrepancies with serotyping, illustrating the difficulty in serotype determination when cross-reactions occur. DNA sequences corresponding to the N-terminal region of M proteins from the isolates showed considerable similarity both in the hypervariable region and the repeat regions. We propose that these serotypes form a family of closely related M types. Frameshift mutations in the hypervariable region followed by a corrective (compensatory) frameshift were observed. This may be an effective mechanism for generating antigenic diversity in the M protein."
CD010502,0,10085008,0,"Protein H, an antiphagocytic surface protein in Streptococcus pyogenes.","Surface-associated M protein is a major virulence factor in Streptococcus pyogenes which confers bacterial resistance to phagocytosis. However, many S. pyogenes strains also express additional structurally related so-called M-like proteins. The strain studied here is of the clinically important M1 serotype and expresses two structurally related surface proteins, the M1 protein and protein H. Mutants were generated that expressed only one or none of these proteins at the bacterial surface. For survival in human blood either protein H or M1 protein was sufficient, whereas the double mutant was rapidly killed. The protein-binding properties of protein H, M1 protein, and the mutants suggest that bacterial binding of immunoglobulin G and factor H or factor H-like protein 1, which are regulatory proteins in the complement system, contribute to the antiphagocytic property."
CD010502,0,2648711,0,Rapid detection of group B streptococci in vaginal swabs of parturients by latex particle agglutination.,"Duplicate high vaginal swabs were obtained from 200 parturient women at Abeokuta (Nigeria). By culture on a selective agar twenty-two women (11%) were found to harbour group B streptococci. The second swab was subjected to a 45 min enzymatic extraction procedure and then tested in a latex agglutination test for group B streptococcal antigen (Wellcogen Strep B; Wellcome Diagnostics, Dartford, UK). The latex test permitted the detection of three out of 22 colonized women (overall sensitivity 13.6%). The sensitivity for detection of heavy colonization was 50% (three out of six women). It is concluded that the sensitivity of the method employed for rapid detection of group B streptococcal antigen in vaginal swabs is still unsatisfactory."

The analysis for the presence of bacterial antigen by counterimmunoelectrophoresis has been used in the detection of neonatal and pediatric infections. In the present report, the previous data concerning the detection of group B streptococcal antigen in cerebrospinal fluid, sera, and urine of infected newborns was reinforced. Counterimmunoelectrophoresis was also established as a method for detecting group B streptococcal antigen in amniotic fluid and group D streptococcal antigen in body fluids, and for verifying group A streptococcal antigen from 24-hour culture plates. This is a further extension of the use by the clinical laboratory of counterimmunoelectrophoresis in the detection of bacterial antigen."

CD010502,0,7948521,0,Diagnosis of Chlamydia pneumoniae infection in patients with community-acquired pneumonia by polymerase chain reaction enzyme immunoassay.,"We conducted a prospective study of 385 patients who had community-acquired pneumonia with use of a modified polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay that detects amplified DNA by enzyme immunoassay (EIA). We used PCR-EIA to improve detection of Chlamydia pneumoniae infection and to differentiate C. pneumoniae infection from other chlamydial infections. Cultures of throat swab specimens from four patients yielded Chlamydia species (C. pneumoniae, one patient; Chlamydia species, two patients; and C. psittaci, one patient). C. pneumoniae was repeatedly detected by PCR-EIA for thirteen (3.4%) of these 385 patients. Six of these 13 patients were infected with the human immunodeficiency virus. Ten (76.9%) of the patients who were positive by PCR-EIA had IgG titers of > or = 1:16, and two (15.4%) of the 13 patients had IgG titers of < 1:16; no sera was available in one case. Other pathogens were recovered in eight (61.5%) of the 13 cases in which C. pneumoniae was detected by PCR-EIA. In addition, for 46 (11.9%) of the 385 patients the titers of antibody were considered diagnostic of C. pneumoniae infection; however, as 36 of the 46 patients were infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (which may have affected their serological response to C. pneumoniae), interpretation of these titers was problematic. As PCR-EIA was more sensitive than was culture for detecting C. pneumoniae infection in this study, this method may be a valuable tool for the prompt diagnosis of this infection."
CD010502,0,17642354,0,Vertebral osteomyelitis in a healthy young adult.,"A 39-year-old African American man with no significant past medical history presented to our hospital with right hand weakness and pain in both arms. He had no fever, neck pain, headache, dizziness, vision changes, or weakness in his lower extremities. Magnetic resonance imaging of the cervical spine showed extensive abnormal enhancement of the C7-T1 vertebral bodies as well as the prevertebral and epidural spaces. Open biopsy of the lesion showed inflammatory changes consistent with osteomyelitis. Culture of the biopsy specimen grew Group B Streptococcus (GBS). HIV ELISA and blood cultures were negative. The patient was treated with intravenous vancomycin for 6 weeks with complete resolution of symptoms. GBS classically affects newborns and pregnant females. However, the incidence of infection from this pathogen in nonpregnant adults is increasing. Vertebral osteomyelitis due to GBS in nonpregnant adults is exceedingly rare. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of GBS cervical vertebral osteomyelitis in an adult without risk factors for invasive GBS infection. This case illustrates that GBS should be included in the differential diagnosis of pyogenic vertebral osteomyelitis, irrespective of immune status and predisposing factors."
CD010502,0,15687433,1,Relationship between the clinical likelihood of group a streptococcal pharyngitis and the sensitivity of a rapid antigen-detection test in a pediatric practice.,The sensitivity of a rapid antigen-detection test (RADT) for group A streptococcal (GAS) pharyngitis is critical to whether the test is cost-effective and to whether a confirmatory throat culture is needed. We evaluated a second-generation RADT to determine if its sensitivity varies across the broad clinical spectrum of patients tested for GAS in pediatric outpatient practice.

His cerebrospinal fluid showed a slight increase in the white cell count and protein content. T2-weighted MRI demonstrated high signal intensity of the bilateral globus pallidus. Cerebrospinal fluid culture was negative for fungi and bacteria, including mycobacterium tuberculosis. Negative results for PCR and ELISA made herpes simplex virus encephalitis unlikely. We treated him empirically with aciclovir and cefpirome, conducting further tests because a HIV serological test was positive on admission. HIV RNA was 2.9 x 10(5) copies/ml in the blood. Western blot analysis demonstrated positive bands at gp160, p24, p55, and p68, but negative at gp120, p52, gp41, p40, p34, and p18. These results yielded a definitive diagnosis of acute primary HIV infection presenting as meningoencephalitis. His clinical condition improved over the next few days. Repeated MRI showed a new lesion in the pons on T2-weighted images. No MRI abnormality has reported previously in acute primary HIV infection with meningoencephalitis. High signal intensity in the bilateral globus pallidus and the pons in patients with meningoencephalitis may thus be a useful indicator for acute primary HIV infection."
CD010502,0,2435154,0,Vaginal gram stain as an immediate detector of group B streptococci in selected obstetric patients.,"During a 19-month period selective vaginal Gram stain and culturing were performed prospectively in all women admitted to the delivery room at risk for low birth weight delivery secondary to preterm premature rupture of the membranes or for prolonged membrane rupture secondary to term premature rupture of the membranes. Gram stain was performed and read immediately on admission. Cultures were also obtained simultaneously and sent for microbiologic evaluation. All women with Gram stains positive for gram-positive cocci were treated with intravenous ampicillin in the event of labor, unless vaginal culture results were already known and were negative for group B beta-hemolytic streptococcus. A total of 72 women had samples taken, and 30 (41.7%) were positive for gram-positive cocci. Nine (30%) of these were subsequently positive for group B beta-hemolytic streptococci by culture. There were no cultures positive for group B beta-hemolytic streptococci in the Gram stain-negative group. Gram stain sensitivity was 100% for predicting the presence of group B beta-hemolytic streptococci in the study population, and specificity was 66.7%. Selective vaginal Gram stain provides an effective and rapid screen for identifying the presence of group B beta-hemolytic streptococci and allows for immediate institution of appropriate antibiotic therapy in the event of onset of labor before the availability of culture results."

The upper limit of normal ASP titers in school children was 1:32 in this study, and titers of 1:64 or more were considered abnormal.

CD010502,0,2196614,0,"Pharyngitis, croup, and epiglottitis.","The exact diagnosis of pharyngitis remains a problem despite the advent of rapid streptococcal screening. An apparent resurgence of rheumatic fever outbreaks makes it more important to attempt to accurately diagnose pharyngitis. Positive identification of streptococci should be followed by treatment with penicillin, or erythromycin in the patient with penicillin allergy. The patient without positive identification of streptococci will need either observation or further evaluation depending on the degree of illness. Classic croup or laryngotracheobronchitis is a clinical entity that can be diagnosed with reasonable confidence. The few patients that require hospitalization can be treated with humidity, racemic epinephrine, corticosteroids, parental and child support, or any combination of these with good results. Continued observation of all patients with croup is necessary to recognize the uncommon complication of bacterial tracheitis when it occurs. Epiglottitis has a varied clinical appearance and management according to age groups. Infants show a mixed clinical picture similar to croup, but with more obstruction. The classic epiglottitis with acute airway obstruction is seen in the 3-8-year-old age group. Adults have a less fulminant form of supraglottitis. Infants and children will need artificial airway management in most cases, whereas many adults can be treated simply with observation."

In this prospective study we compared the results of culture and PCR testing of vaginal and rectal samples collected by nursing staff when women were in labor. Patients' charts were also reviewed to obtain relevant information about pregnancy risk factors. Our results demonstrated a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of 90.5%, 96.1%, 86.4%, and 97.4%, respectively, for rapid PCR. Of the 196 women evaluated, 29 (14.8%) presented with unknown GBS status, 11 (37.9%) of whom received unnecessary intrapartum antibiotics. The rapid real-time PCR test was robust and was able to reliably detect the presence of GBS in women in labor within 1 h of specimen submission to the laboratory. We recommend that the rapid PCR test be targeted to women who present in labor with unknown GBS status. In cases where the laboratory does not offer 24-h availability of testing, sample collection followed by PCR testing the next morning is still valuable and provides reliable results 24 to 48 h faster than culture and will aid appropriate decision-making regarding continuing or stopping antibiotics for neonates of women with unknown GBS status."
CD010502,0,22719247,0,DNase Sda1 allows invasive M1T1 Group A Streptococcus to prevent TLR9-dependent recognition.,"Group A Streptococcus (GAS) has developed a broad arsenal of virulence factors that serve to circumvent host defense mechanisms. The virulence factor DNase Sda1 of the hyperinvasive M1T1 GAS clone degrades DNA-based neutrophil extracellular traps allowing GAS to escape extracellular killing. TLR9 is activated by unmethylated CpG-rich bacterial DNA and enhances innate immune resistance. We hypothesized that Sda1 degradation of bacterial DNA could alter TLR9-mediated recognition of GAS by host innate immune cells. We tested this hypothesis using a dual approach: loss and gain of function of DNase in isogenic GAS strains and presence and absence of TLR9 in the host. Either DNA degradation by Sda1 or host deficiency of TLR9 prevented GAS induced IFN-α and TNF-α secretion from murine macrophages and contributed to bacterial survival. Similarly, in a murine necrotizing fasciitis model, IFN-α and TNF-α levels were significantly decreased in wild type mice infected with GAS expressing Sda1, whereas no such Sda1-dependent effect was seen in a TLR9-deficient background. Thus GAS Sda1 suppressed both the TLR9-mediated innate immune response and macrophage bactericidal activity. Our results demonstrate a novel mechanism of bacterial innate immune evasion based on autodegradation of CpG-rich DNA by a bacterial DNase."
CD010502,0,8664524,0,Evidence for an increased rate of bacterial infections in liver transplant patients with cytomegalovirus infection.,"It has been reported that cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections increase the susceptibility of transplant patients for other opportunistic infections. Most of these studies date back from a time when CMV infection was difficult to diagnose and antiviral treatment not available. We therefore analyzed CMV-related morbidity after OLT in 111 consecutive patients. CMV monitoring was done weekly using the antigenemia assay, a quantitative marker of the viral load, in addition to serology. CMV infection occurred in 66/95 (69%) evaluable patients. Antigenemia was detected in 94% of them. The number of CMV antigen-positive cells was helpful to monitor the course of infection and differentiate CMV disease from other complications. CMV infection was symptomatic in 48/66 (73%) patients. Mild disease occurred in 30 patients, and severe constitutional symptoms or organ involvement in 18. No patient died as a direct result of CMV infection, but mortality between day 30 and 180 tended to be higher in CMV-infected patients (15 vs. 0%, p < 0.1). CMV infection was associated with a 2.45-fold higher incidence of major infections between day 30 and 180 after OLT (p < 0.05). Most of these infections were caused by gram-positive cocci. We conclude that CMV not only causes substantial morbidity, but also increases the risk of bacterial infections."

CD010502,0,2521633,0,Serine and tyrosine protein kinase activities in Streptococcus pyogenes. Phosphorylation of native and synthetic peptides of streptococcal M proteins.,"Two forms of protein kinase activity were isolated from crude extracts of Streptococcus pyogenes and partially purified by ion exchange chromatography and affinity chromatography. The phosphorylation activities were shown to be insensitive to cAMP, required the presence of divalent cations, and eluted from a Sephadex G-200 column with approximate molecular masses of 60 and 45 kDa, respectively. Both enzymes were capable of phosphorylating eukaryotic proteins and synthetic polypeptides in addition to endogenous and heterologous prokaryotic proteins at serine and tyrosine residues. Firm evidence for tyrosine kinase activity was obtained by the use of a tyrosine kinase-specific substrate, a 4:1 glutamate:tyrosine copolymer. Both protein kinases phosphorylated HPr, a phosphocarrier protein of the phosphotransferase system isolated from S. pyogenes and Bacillus stearothermophilus, but failed to phosphorylate HPr isolated from Escherichia coli. Both also phosphorylated a native polypeptide fragment (pep M24) as well as synthetic peptide copies of M protein, the major virulence determinant of group A streptococci. These results indicate that prokaryotic protein kinases are capable of phosphorylating eukaryotic proteins and suggest that the protein kinases of streptococci may play an important role not only in the phosphotransferase system but also in the virulence properties of these organisms."
CD010502,0,6408401,0,An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for quantification of antibodies to Streptococcus mutans surface antigens.,"An ELISA was developed to quantitate the level of antibodies to various cell surface antigens of the Gram positive bacterium, Streptococcus mutans. Whole cells and purified cell wall components of S. mutans, lipoteichoic acid (LTA) from Streptococcus pyogenes, and dextran T 2000 were employed as coating antigens in this study. Cell walls of S. mutans were purified by mechanical disruption of whole cells followed by differential centrifugation and proteolytic enzyme treatment. Serotype-specific carbohydrate was purified from an autoclaved, lyophilized S. mutans whole cell preparation by column chromatography. LTA was prepared by Sepharose 4B chromatography of a phenol-water extract of S. pyogenes and used for detection of anti-polyglycerophosphate (PGP) antibodies. A rabbit antiserum to S. mutans 6715 (serotype g), which precipitated with purified carbohydrate antigen (RR g), gave good reactions with purified cell walls and whole cells of S. mutans 6715, less activity with RR g and low activity to LTA and dextran when tested by ELISA. Adsorption of this antiserum with whole cells of S. pyogenes resulted in antibody activity with specificity only to the serotype carbohydrate. The specificity of the antibody for homologous coating antigen was RR g greater than cell wall greater than whole cells. An antiserum to S. mutans MT573 (serotype e) contained antibody predominantly to LTA, whereas, anti-S. mutans MT703 (serotype e) reacted with both dextran and LTA; however, the activity to LTA was removed by prior adsorption of the antiserum with S. pyogenes cells. This treatment did not alter the antibody activity to dextran. To establish the sensitivity of ELISA, a purified IgG anti-serotype carbohydrate antibody was prepared by adsorption of anti-S. mutans 6715 antiserum with a mutant of S. mutans which lacks serotype carbohydrate followed by adsorption and elution of specific antibodies from S. mutans 6715 whole cells. The minimum level of sensitivity of ELISA was 12.5 ng of IgG anti-serotype carbohydrate."
CD010502,0,9082777,0,Reconstitution of SCID mouse with tonsillar cells from patients with IgA nephropathy.,"IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is characterized by a predominant IgA deposition to the renal mesangium. Immunological abnormalities are closely related to the occurrence and progression of IgAN. Many reports have indicated that tonsillectomy favours the clinical course of IgAN. To understand the role of tonsil glands in the occurrence and progression of IgAN, we injected tonsillar lymphoid cells from patients with IgAN into severe combined immuno-deficient mice (SCID). Tonsillar glands were obtained surgically from 3 patients with IgAN (experimental group) and from 7 patients with chronic tonsillitis without any manifestation of renal diseases (control group). Tonsils were homogenized and resultant cells cryopreserved. On the day of injection, cells were thawed and passed through Ficoll-Paque gradients to obtain mononuclear cells. Fifty million cells were injected intraperitoneally into the SCID mice. After 8 weeks, transferred cells successfully reconstituted SCID, as shown by the fact that human immunoglobulins were detected in the sera of both groups. Renal histopathological examination revealed there was no IgA deposition to the mesangial area in either group. These results indicate that tonsillar mononuclear cells alone may not directly relate to the occurrence of IgAN."
CD010502,0,16364444,0,Invasive group A streptococcal infection with pancarditis caused by a new emm-type 12 allele of Streptococcus pyogenes.,"Throughout the 1980s, a progressive increase in the incidence of Streptococcus pyogenes-related invasive infections has occurred. It has been suggested that a host-related immunogenetic background, as well as bacterial virulence factors may play an important role in the outcome of streptococcal infections. Here, we present the first case of pancarditis in the literature caused by direct bacterial invasion due to a new emm-type 12 allele of S. pyogenes in an immunocompetent patient. The pathogenesis of this invasive infection, as well as predictors of poor prognosis are discussed."
CD010502,0,2413662,0,[Use of immunoenzyme analysis for evaluating the specificity of the antibody recognition of the antigenic determinants of Streptococcus group A].,"Investigations carried out with the use of a CELIA system have revealed that antibodies in the sera of patients with primary erysipelas and antibodies in rabbit antiserum to the ribosomes of group A streptococcus specifically bind with adsorbed streptococcal ribosomes, recognizing the antigenic determinants of streptococcal ribosomes, which differ from those of individual Gram-negative prokaryotes (Escherichia coli, Shigella sonnei, Shigella flexneri, Salmonella minnesota). The modified CELIA system used in this investigation has made it possible to find out that antibodies in the sera of patients with primary erysipelas and antibodies in rabbit ribosomal antiserum bind with different antigenic determinants of the ribosomes of group A streptococcus."
CD010502,0,16113323,0,Identification of group A Streptococcus antigenic determinants upregulated in vivo.,"Group A Streptococcus (GAS) causes a range of diseases in humans, from mild noninvasive infections to severe invasive infections. The molecular basis for the varying severity of disease remains unclear. We identified genes expressed during invasive disease using in vivo-induced antigen technology (IVIAT), applied for the first time in a gram-positive organism. Convalescent-phase sera from patients with invasive disease were pooled, adsorbed against antigens derived from in vitro-grown GAS, and used to screen a GAS genomic expression library. A murine model of invasive GAS disease was included as an additional source of sera for screening. Sequencing DNA inserts from clones reactive with both human and mouse sera indicated 16 open reading frames with homology to genes involved in metabolic activity to genes of unknown function. Of these, seven genes were assessed for their differential expression by quantitative real-time PCR both in vivo, utilizing a murine model of invasive GAS disease, and in vitro at different time points of growth. Three gene products-a putative penicillin-binding protein 1A, a putative lipoprotein, and a conserved hypothetical protein homologous to a putative translation initiation inhibitor in Vibrio vulnificus-were upregulated in vivo, suggesting that these genes play a role during invasive disease."
CD010502,0,6203092,0,Human IgG antibodies to carbohydrate and protein antigens in mouse protection tests with group B streptococci.,"The protective effect of four commercial human gammaglobulin batches (I-IV) in mice was studied using six different strains of group B streptococci (GBS): types Ia; Ib; II, R-protein negative (R-); II, R+; III, R-; and III, R+. Each mouse received 1.0 ml gammaglobulin and 0.5 ml bacteria, 10(6)-10(8) colony forming units (CFU). There was a close correlation between antibody levels measured by the use of radiolabeled protein A and the mouse-protective effect of the gamma-globulins. The mouse-protection tests demonstrated that batch I protected against GBS types Ia and III, R- at low concentration (65 mg/kg mouse weight), against type Ib at medium (260 mg/kg) and against type III, R+ at high concentration. Batch IV protected against types Ia and Ib, although the doses were four times higher than those in batch I, but did not protect against type III, R+. There was no mouse protection by any of the batches against type II. Antibody levels against Ibc and R, protein antigens, were substantially lower in batch IV. Because the results of these mouse-protection studies indicate the importance of such antibodies against protein antigens, batches I-III might be more useful for therapy of neonatal GBS-septicemia."

Antibrain antibody profiles were compared in children with OCD-only (n = 13; 14.1 +/- 3.1 years), OCD+PANDAS (n = 20; 11.3 +/- 1.5 years), OCD+Chronic Tic Disorder (n = 23; 13.4 +/- 3.5 years), and controls (n = 29; 12.4 +/- 2.4 years) using ELISA (orbitofrontal (OFC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), caudate (CD), cingulate gyrus (CG)), immunoblotting (four regions plus putative antigens), and immunohistochemistry. ELISA and immunohistochemistry showed no differences among groups. Immunoblot showed that a greater percentage of individuals in the OCD+PANDAS cohort had reactive bands at 27 kDa (CD, CG, DLPFC), 36 kDa (CD), and 100 kDa (CD, OFC) and increased peak height at 67 kDa (all regions). Immunoblotting studies using the putative antigens (pyruvate kinase M1, aldolase C, alpha- and gamma-enolase) did not differ among groups. ASO titers were similar in all groups and did not correlate with immunoassays. It remains controversial whether childhood OCD is associated with autoimmune mechanisms."
CD010502,0,11579726,0,[Overuse of antibiotics with upper respiratory tract infections in a primary care clinic].,"In the majority of cases upper respiratory tract infections (URI's) are caused by viruses. Nonetheless, in many instances, patients with URI's are over-treated with antibiotics. In order to evaluate the use of antibiotic therapy in patients with URI's, we recorded medications prescribed for URI's in 394 young adults seeking care in a primary care clinic. The following parameters were assessed: rhinnorhea, cough, sore throat, dysphagia, tonsillar exudates, tonsillar enlargement and cervical lymphadenopathy. Throat cultures were taken from all the patients."
CD010502,0,11286821,0,Increased titers of antibodies against streptococcal M12 and M19 proteins in patients with Tourette's syndrome.,"It has been suggested that a post-streptococcal autoimmune process may be involved in the pathogenesis of a subgroup of children with tics and obsessive-compulsive symptoms (PANDAS). Elevated antibody titers against streptococcal antigens have also been described in adult patients suffering from Tourette's syndrome (TS). In order to characterise further streptococcal antigens, we focussed on M proteins. M proteins are a major virulence factor of group A streptococci and known to evoke an immunologic cross-reaction with diverse epitopes of human tissue including brain tissue. Therefore, antibodies against M proteins may play a role in the pathophysiology of at least a subgroup of TS patients. Antibodies against M proteins were studied in 25 adult patients suffering from TS and 25 healthy controls after careful medical examination. The antibody titers against the peptides M1, M4, M6, M12 and M19 were estimated by ELISA. Our results show increased titers of antibodies against the streptococcal M12 and M19 proteins in TS patients as compared with controls, while antibody titers against M1, M4 and M6 did not differ between the TS and control groups. Elevated serum titers of antibodies against M12 and M19 proteins support the view that a streptococcus-induced autoimmune process may be involved in TS. The finding of a possible autoimmune origin of TS has implications for both pathophysiology and future therapeutic strategies."

CD010502,0,8992100,0,[5-day therapy of bacterial pharyngitis and tonsillitis with cefixime. Comparison with 10 day treatment with penicillin V. Cefixime Study Group].,"160 children aged 1 to 12 years with clinical diagnosis of bacterial pharyngitis and/or tonsillitis were treated either with cefixime ready-to-use-suspension or penicillin V in an open, controlled and randomized multicenter study. Before treatment a rapid antigen detection test was accomplished and throat swabs were taken. After randomization, the children were either treated for 5 days with 8 mg cefixime/kg bodyweight ready-to-use suspension once daily or with 20,000 I.U. penicillin V/kg bodyweight t.i.d. also administered as suspension. The data of 151 children could be evaluated for clinically efficacy. In the cefixime-group 86.7% of the children were cured and 9.3% significantly improved. After initial improvement, in one child (1.3%) a relapse occurred and in the two remaining children (2.7%) therapy failed. 90.8% of the patients treated with penicillin V were cured, 6.6% improved and in one child each a relapse was registered resp. therapy failed. Complete microbiological data were available in 137 patients. In the cefixime-group in 82.6% of the patients the pathogens were eradicated. The elimination rate in the penicillin-group was 88.2%. At the follow-up 3-4 weeks after end of treatment 6 relapses were seen in the cefixime-group, and 8 in the patients treated with penicillin. Both regimes were safe. Mild to moderate adverse events at least possibly related to the study medication were seen in only 4 children treated with cefixime and in 5 treated with penicillin. A 5 day treatment of bacterial pharyngitis and tonsillitis with cefixime was as effective as a ten day treatment with penicillin V."

However, it was not found in the cells of entodermal tumors (stomach and intestinal adenocarcinoma). Considering earlier reports on the detection of cross reacting antigen in experimental ectodermal tumors, these results suggest the development of an additional histogenetical method of differential diagnosis of human tumors which arise in ectodermal tegumental epithelium."
CD010502,0,22012657,0,Description of macrolide-resistant and potential virulent clones of Streptococcus pyogenes causing asymptomatic colonization during 2000-2006 in the Lisbon area.,"The asymptomatic oropharyngeal colonization rate by Streptococcus pyogenes was 10.7% in children (901 among 8,405 children 0-16 years old) and 3.3% in adults (37 among 1,126 households of children) in the Lisbon area during 2000-2006. Macrolide-resistant S. pyogenes from children (n = 149) was variable with time: 9.8-10.7% in 2000-2002, 28.1% in 2003, 19.6-2.7% in 2004-2005 and 14.6% in 2006. Eight lineages (97.3% of isolates) were identified based on at least 80% similarity of PFGE patterns, T types, emm types and multilocus sequence types (ST). The elevated frequency of macrolide resistance was associated with M phenotype lineages I (emm12/ST36) and V (emm4, emm75/ST39 and a novel emmstMrp6 type) and with one cMLS(B) lineage IV (emm28/ST52) known to be associated with upper respiratory tract and invasive infections. Significant associations (p < 0.05) between emm type/virulence genotype were found, such as emm1/speA (+) ssa (-), emm4/ssa (+) prtF1 (+), emm12/speA (-) ssa (-). The high prevalence (>20%) of speC, prtF1 or ssa was probably caused either by clonal dissemination (speC), or to horizontal gene transfer events (prtF1 and ssa). This report contributes to a better understanding of the molecular epidemiology and evolution of macrolide-resistant S. pyogenes causing symptom-free oropharyngeal colonization. These colonizing strains carry macrolide resistance and virulence genes capable of being transferred to other bacterial species sharing the same niche."
CD010502,0,11845431,0,Phenotypic characterization of some anginosus group isolates from oral and maxillofacial infections.,"The aim of this study was to briefly characterize serologically, biochemically and from the cultural point of view some anginosus group isolates found in pus samples collected from patients with oral and maxillofacial infections. Cultural characterization was done by studying the culture odor, the colony size and aspect, and hemolysis type on Columbia bood agar (BA). Lancefield grouping was made on cards using the rapid latex-agglutination test (Slidex Strepto-Kit, Bio Mérieux, France). The biochemical characterization was performed at the same time with the speciation by the Rapid ID 32 Strep system (Bio Mérieux, Marcy-l'Etoile, France). The anginosus group isolates were phenotypically heterogenic. Based on phenotypic description, nonidentical anginosus group isolates were found in the same patient sample."
CD010502,0,16434707,0,Characterization of group A streptococci (Streptococcus pyogenes): correlation of M-protein and emm-gene type with T-protein agglutination pattern and serum opacity factor.,"Strain characterization of group A streptococci (GAS) has traditionally been based on serological identification of M protein. Additional tests to determine T-protein serotype and production of streptococcal serum opacity factor (SOF) provide important information both to aid in and to supplement M-protein serotyping. Advances in DNA-sequencing technology in the late twentieth century resulted in the development of a method for determining the M type of GAS from the sequence of the gene encoding M protein, the emm gene. Although emm-sequence typing has largely replaced M typing in many laboratories, information provided by T typing and SOF determination continues to provide valuable supplementary information for strain characterization. A comprehensive summary of the correlation of T pattern and SOF production with M type was last published in 1993, several years before emm typing became widely available. Since then, the ease of M-type identification afforded by emm typing has resulted in an increase in the number of confirmed M/emm types of more than 50 %. However, comprehensive information about T-protein serotype and the correlation of SOF production with these new M/emm types is not widely available. This report presents a comprehensive summary of this information, not only for newly described types, but also updated information for previously described types. This information was extracted from combined records from streptococcal reference laboratories at the University of Minnesota and at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. Data from more than 40,000 strains (representing uncomplicated GAS infections, systemic invasive infections and strains associated with non-suppurative sequelae, collected from the US and diverse locations worldwide) were analysed."
CD010502,0,8504038,0,Group A streptococcal antigen-specific T lymphocytes in guttate psoriatic lesions.,"A strong association exists between guttate psoriasis and group A, beta-haemolytic streptococcal infections. To demonstrate the presence of streptococcal-specific T cells in psoriatic skin, T-cell lines (TLs) were established from biopsies of lesions from five patients with guttate psoriasis, and compared with TLs from five patients with eczema, five with lichen planus, two with pityriasis rosea and three with nickel contact dermatitis. TLs from purified protein derivative (PPD)-induced delayed hypersensitivity sites in three normal individuals were also studied. All five of the psoriatic TLs responded in a proliferation assay to heat-killed isolates of group A streptococci, compared with only one eczema, two lichen planus and one pityriasis rosea. The response of one nickel contact dermatitis and two PPD TLs to group A streptococci was markedly less than to nickel and PPD, respectively. One of the psoriatic TLs was cloned in the presence of type 5 streptococcal M protein. The nine clones obtained were all CD3+, CD4+, CD45RO+, TCR alpha, beta+, gamma, delta-. However, they were all unreactive with antibodies to TCR V beta 5, 6, 8 or 12. Eight of the nine clones reacted, to a varying extent, to one or two of three preparations of group A streptococci expressing different M proteins. The streptococcal response of four consistently reactive clones from this patient was HLA-DR-restricted and inhibited by anti-HLA-DR antibody in a dose-dependent manner. On stimulation these four clones secreted high levels of gamma-interferon and detectable levels of IL-2, IL-10 and granulocyte/macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) depending upon the nature of the stimulus, but no IL-4 or TNF-alpha production was detected. This study has demonstrated, for the first time, that T lymphocytes specific for group A streptococcal antigens can be consistently isolated from guttate psoriatic lesions. The role of streptococcal-specific T cells in the pathogenesis of psoriasis remains to be determined."

She recovered rapidly without any sequelae after treatment with intravenously administered acyclovir."
CD010502,0,3090801,0,beta-D-galactosidase activity in streptococci of serological group B.,"Group B streptococci isolated from humans differed significantly in beta-D-galactosidase-activity from those of bovine mastitis. This could be demonstrated in a relatively simple and rapid test using a fluorogenic 4-methylumbelliferyl-beta-D-galactoside conjugate. Only 10 (12%) of 82 group B streptococcal cultures from human produced beta-D-galactosidase. On the other hand, 74 (96%) of 77 ""bovine"" cultures formed this enzyme. Thus, beta-D-galactosidase activity could be used as an additional marker for the differentiation between group B streptococci of human and bovine origin."
CD010502,0,17010371,0,Development of a multiplexed fluorescent immunoassay for the quantitation of antibody responses to group A streptococci.,"The host immunologic response to group A streptococcal infections gives rise to numerous antibodies directed against cellular and extracellular bacterial antigens. For determining individual immune status, or studying the pathogenesis of group A streptococcal associated diseases, such as acute rheumatic fever (ARF), an assay capable of determining antibodies responses to multiple antigens would be of great advantage. We have developed a microsphere based, multiplexed immunoassay for the simultaneous quantitation of antibodies to nine different extracellular, ARF related tissue and group A streptococci specific antigens using only 5 microl of sample. Through the selection of microspheres and serum diluent, non-specific antibody binding was reduced by 17%. Different formulations of the coupling buffer were found to greatly influence the efficiency of coupling antigens to the carboxylated microspheres. Monoclonal antibodies against the different antigens demonstrated assay specificity as well as sensitivities of less than 1 ng/ml of antibody. This multiplexed assay should be a powerful research and clinical tool in determining antibody responses to group A streptococcal infections and in potentially determining the role of a variety of cross-reactive antigens in rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease."
CD010502,0,12517826,0,Evaluation of a PCR assay for detection of Streptococcus pneumoniae in respiratory and nonrespiratory samples from adults with community-acquired pneumonia.,"Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common cause of community-acquired pneumonia, but it is undoubtedly underdiagnosed. We used a nested PCR assay (targeting the pneumolysin gene) to detect S. pneumoniae DNA in multiple sample types from 474 adults with community-acquired pneumonia and 183 control patients who did not have pneumonia. Plasma or buffy coat samples were PCR positive in only 6 of the 21 patients with positive blood cultures for S. pneumoniae and in 12 other patients (4 of whom had no other laboratory evidence of S. pneumoniae infection). Buffy coat samples from two control patients (neither having evidence of S. pneumoniae infection), but no control plasma samples, were PCR positive. Although pneumococcal antigen was detected in the urine from 120 of 420 (29%) patients, only 4 of 227 (2%) urine samples tested were PCR positive. Overall, 256 of 318 (81%) patients had PCR-positive sputum samples, including 58 of 59 samples from which S. pneumoniae was cultured. Throat swab samples from 229 of 417 (55%) patients were PCR positive and, in those who produced sputum, 96% also had positive PCR results from sputum. Throat swabs from 73 of 126 (58%) control patients were also PCR positive. We conclude that the pneumolysin PCR assay adds little to existing diagnostic tests for S. pneumoniae and is unable to distinguish colonization from infection when respiratory samples are tested."
CD010502,0,8208140,1,Evaluation of the diagnostic accuracy of a kit for the rapid detection of group A streptococci.,"A rapid immunoassay method using an Event Test Strip Strep A experimental kit (Boehringer Mannheim) was evaluated. Results obtained were compared with culture results to evaluate the accuracy of detection of group A streptococci directly from throat swabs or from artificial swabs containing various bacterial concentrations. A good diagnostic accuracy was obtained with a sensitivity of 96.9% in the assay of throat swabs which provided more than ten group A Streptococcus colonies per plate. Since a low level of micro-organisms may indicate infection, it is recommended that a culture be performed when the rapid test based on antigen detection is negative."
CD010502,0,8487287,0,A review of the correlation of T-agglutination patterns and M-protein typing and opacity factor production in the identification of group A streptococci.,"The classical techniques of M protein and opacity factor (OF) typing and T agglutination typing remain the ""gold standard"" in identifying group A streptococci, although newer techniques have been proposed to assist laboratory scientists, microbiologists, epidemiologists and clinicians in the precise identification and characterisation of these organisms. Because of the current scarcity of M-typing sera and the increased use by many laboratories of T typing as the sole method of group A identification, a table is presented to indicate specific correlation between the T-agglutination pattern and the M serotype. The use of this table will enable not only more selective use of typing sera but also, perhaps, result in improved understanding and ultimately in correlating these defined patterns with newer and more sensitive techniques."
CD010502,0,3014010,0,Centrifugation-augmented solid-phase immunoassay (CASPIA) for the rapid diagnosis of infectious diseases.,"We have devised centrifugation-augmented solid-phase immunoassays (CASPIAs) for the detection of microbial pathogens in human body fluids. The CASPIA format combines several features of latex agglutination and solid-phase immunoassay systems to produce an assay system that is inexpensive and simple to perform. We found that CASPIA systems for the detection of rotaviral, group A streptococcal, and Haemophilus influenzae type b antigens were significantly more sensitive than latex agglutination assays and at least as sensitive as enzyme immunoassay systems using analogous reagents. Because CASPIA reactions could either be read macroscopically, recorded with a standard office photocopying device, or quantitated by means of a microplate colorimeter, the assays were applicable under a wide range of clinical and laboratory conditions."
CD010502,0,9304282,0,[Tonsillo-pharyngeal form of tularemia].,"Clinical, laboratory and serologic features of tonsillopharyngeal form of tularemia in 14 patients were analyzed in the study. The disease was ignored under the diagnosis of typical tonsillopharyngitis followed by cervical lymphadenopathy. Routine laboratory analyses results were non-specific and didn't reveal the disease etiology, while microagglutination test (MAT) of F. tularensis in the second week of disease was positive in 86% of patients. Skin tularin test was positive in all the tested patients during the first week of the disease. The best results in the treatment were achieved by administration of streptomycin and doxycycline. Well timed therapy prevented the lymph nodes colliquation, disease recurrence and infection generalization. The authors point out the significance of this clinical form of tularemia in the differential diagnosis of tonsillopharyngitis and cervical lymphodenopathy."

CD010502,0,3903009,0,Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for identification and measurement of antibodies to group A streptococcal bacteriophage.,"A sensitive enzyme immunoassay (ELISA) was developed to identify and measure antibodies to group A streptococcal bacteriophage hyaluronidase. With a purified preparation of bacteriophage hyaluronidase as the solid-phase antigen, the ELISA was shown to be as specific as and more sensitive than the standard bacteriophage neutralization test for measurement of antibody to bacteriophage. In rabbits immunized with bacteriophage, the ELISA detected antibody earlier than the neutralization assay (7 vs. 11 days) and was able to distinguish IgG and IgM class antibodies. A strong correlation was demonstrated between antibody titers measured by ELISA and bacteriophage neutralization (r = 0.88; P less than 0.001). Preliminary data using the ELISA, modified to measure human antibody to bacteriophage hyaluronidase, indicated that an antibody response of both IgG and IgM classes occurred in humans after group A streptococcal infection. This ELISA provided a sensitive method for detection and measurement of antibody to a specific bacteriophage antigen, which will be useful in the investigation of the role of bacteriophage in the pathogenesis of group A streptococcal infections."
CD010502,0,1997440,0,Modifications of plasma fibronectin in cystic fibrosis patients.,"Recurrent pulmonary infections with Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are a major problem in cystic fibrosis (CF), leading to severe and progressive deterioration of the respiratory tract. Fibronectin (FN) has a binding site(s) for S. aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. This bacterial bindings site(s) was studied by using FN from patients with CF and comparing them with FN purified from the plasma of bronchitis and normal subjects by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique. We found a decreased binding of the CF FN to these bacteria in all seven CF patients. Other differences between the CF FN and normal FN were a marked modification in the pattern of peptide migration in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis after hydrolysis with various proteinases and an increase or decrease of the total sugar content of the FN."
CD010502,0,9990406,0,Resistance to antibiotics used in dermatological practice.,"The increased prevalence of bacterial resistance is one of the major problems of medicine today. Antibiotic resistance can be defined as the situation where the minimal inhibitory concentration is greater than the concentration obtainable in vivo. Resistance genes are easily transferred among bacteria, especially bacteria on skin and mucous membranes. In dermatological patients the most important resistance problems are found among staphylococci, Propionibacterium acnes and, to some extent, streptococci. Staphylococcus aureus strains have developed worldwide resistance to penicillin due to betalactamase production in > 90% of cases, and methicillin resistance is now a major problem with resistance levels of > 50% in certain areas of the world. These resistant strains are often multiresistant, and include resistance to erythromycin and tetracycline, with resistance to quinolone developing rapidly. Group A streptococci are still susceptible to penicillin, but increasing problems with erythromycin and tetracycline have been reported. After treatment with both systemic and oral antibiotics, P. acnes develops resistance in more than 50% of cases, and it is estimated that one in four acne patients harbours strains resistant to tetracycline, erythromycin, and clindamycin. To limit the development of antibiotic resistance, it is necessary to establish an antibiotic policy (prescription rules, reimbursement strategy, development of both national and local guidelines, and limitations on non-medical use). Clinicians also need access to rapid diagnostic methods, including resistance testing. This may provide further data for surveillance systems, reporting both antibiotic consumption and resistance levels. The involvement of clinical doctors in teaching and research in this area is probably the most important aspect, along with their involvement in the formulation of national and local guidelines. In the future we may consider it more important to ensure that future patients can be offered antibiotic treatment, rather than focusing on the patient presenting today."
CD010502,0,11030302,0,Pharyngeal carriage of group C and group G streptococci and acute rheumatic fever in an Aboriginal population.,"Acute rheumatic fever (ARF) and rheumatic heart disease (RHD) represent an autoimmune response to group A streptococcal pharyngitis. In the Aboriginal population of the Northern Territory of Australia, some of the highest rates of ARF in the world have been reported, although throat carriage rates of group A streptococcus in this population are extremely low and symptomatic group A streptococcal pharyngitis is uncommon; by contrast, carriage rates of group C and G streptococci are high. Therefore, we questioned the involvement of these groups in ARF and showed that they have the potential to elicit an autoimmune response that may trigger ARF."

Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain on admission showed high-signal intensities in the right pontine tegmentum, right cerebellar peduncle and vermis on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery imaging. Examination of cerebrospinal fluid yielded mononuclear pleocytosis, elevated protein and increased IgM antibodies to herpes simplex virus (HSV) by enzyme immunoassay. HSV-1 specific antibodies also were detected in serum by neutralization test. We gave a diagnosis of brainstem encephalitis caused by HSV-1. The patient was successfully treated with high dose of acyclovir, steroid and intravenous immunoglobulin. He was discharged without any neurologic sequelae. We herein presented a case of atypical encephalitis due to HSV-1 involving mainly the brainstem with possible infection via right trigeminal nerve and summarized recent 35 cases with herpetic brainstem encephalitis since 1990."

CD010502,0,10998165,0,A role for the fibrinogen-binding regions of streptococcal M proteins in phagocytosis resistance.,"All virulent group A streptococcal isolates bind fibrinogen, a property that is closely linked to expression of type-specific antiphagocytic surface molecules designated M proteins. Here we show that although the M proteins from two different strains, M1 and M5, both bind fibrinogen with high affinity, they interact with different regions in the ligand. Moreover, mapping experiments demonstrated that the fibrinogen-binding regions in the M1 and M5 proteins are quite dissimilar at the amino acid sequence level and that they bind to different regions in the plasma protein. In spite of these differences, the fibrinogen-binding regions of M1 and M5 could both be shown to contribute to streptococcal survival in human blood, providing evidence for the distinct function of a plasma protein interaction in bacterial pathogenesis."
CD010502,0,17407184,0,Group A streptococcus cell-associated pathogenic proteins as revealed by growth in hyaluronic acid-enriched media.,"Group A streptococcus (GAS), also know as Streptococcus pyogenes, is a human pathogen and can cause several fatal invasive diseases such as necrotising fasciitis, the so-called flesh-eating disease, and toxic shock syndrome. The destruction of connective tissue and the hyaluronic acid (HA) therein, is a key element of GAS pathogenesis. We therefore propagated GAS in HA-enriched growth media in an attempt to create a simple biological system that could reflect some elements of GAS pathogenesis. Our results show that several recognised virulence factors were up-regulated in HA-enriched media, including the M1 protein, a collagen-like surface protein and the glycolytic enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, which has been shown to play important roles in streptococcal pathogenesis. Interestingly, two hypothetical proteins of unknown function were also up-regulated and detailed bioinformatics analysis showed that at least one of these hypothetical proteins is likely to be involved in pathogenesis. It was therefore concluded that this simple biological system provided a valuable tool for the identification of potential GAS virulence factors."
CD010502,0,2189797,0,[Sore throat: an analysis of medical management in a community clinic].,"The diagnostic approach to sore throat and its treatment by 7 doctors was studied in 692 community clinic patients. Redness of the throat, the commonest clinical feature in all age groups, was present in 88%. The prevalence of other clinical findings varied in the different age groups. 54% of the patients, most of whom were less than 13 years old, were treated initially with antibiotics. Most of the physicians prescribed penicillin V (average, 8.4 days). From 11 (13%) of the throat cultures taken from children under the age of 4, beta hemolytic streptococci (BHS) were grown. Based on throat cultures, antibiotics had been given unnecessarily in 53% of those in whom it was initially prescribed, and wrongly withheld in 10% of those who initially did not receive them. This study reveals an urgent need for a rapid and accurate method of detecting BHS in patients with sore throat."

CD010502,0,22012878,0,Selective antibody response to Streptococcus gallolyticus pilus proteins in colorectal cancer patients.,"Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus (previously called Streptococcus bovis biotype I) infections have long been associated with colorectal cancer (CRC). This work aimed to investigate the CRC-associated humoral immune response to four pilus proteins of this bacterium by newly developed ELISAs. Pilus proteins are interesting diagnostic targets as they are the building blocks of pilin-like structures that mediate bacterial virulence and are readily exposed to the host immune system upon infection. The presence of serum antibodies against these pilus proteins was evaluated in Dutch and American populations. These analyses showed that an immune response to these antigens was specific for clinical S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus infections, but that increased serum antibody titers to multiple pilus proteins in single individuals were rarely observed. However, a multiplex approach based on antibody titers against any of these four antigens resulted in assay sensitivities between 16% and 43% for the detection of early-stage CRC. Together these findings underscore the potential of a multi-antigen approach to complement diagnosis of S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus-associated CRC."
CD010502,0,9322743,0,Two-domain motif for IgG-binding activity by group A streptococcal emm gene products.,"A biological role for the non-immune binding of human IgG by group A streptococci is evidenced by its strong association with a subpopulation of strains giving rise to tissue-specific infection. IgG-binding activity lies within many of the M and M-like surface proteins (encoded by emm genes), and several structurally distinct IgG-binding sites are known to exist. In this report, two adjacent IgG-binding domains, differing in their specificity for human IgG subclasses, are localized within the M-like protein, protein H. The putative coding regions for the two IgG-binding domains were mapped for 82 epidemiologically unrelated strains. Both coding regions are associated with phylogenetically distant emm genes, supporting a role for horizontal transfer and intergenomic recombination in the evolution of emm genes. In most instances, the two coding regions are tightly linked, suggesting that there exist strong selective pressures to maintain a two-domain binding motif. Both coding regions are found among all strains bearing emm gene markers associated with impetigo lesions as the principal tissue reservoir, but are absent from most strains that exhibit markers for a predominant nasopharyngeal reservoir. The data support the hypothesis that the pathogenic potential of an isolate is dictated, at least in part, by its unique array of multifunctional emm gene products."

Heretofore there have been very few reports about GBS in unmarried women in Japan. The validity of urinary culture as a substitute for vaginal culture was initially studied. The carriage of GBS was evaluated by vaginal, anal and urinary cultures in 90 pregnant women. Carrier detection were 18 carriers (20.0%) by vaginal culture, 22 carriers (24.4%) by anal culture and 18 carriers (20.0%) by urinary culture. Fifteen of the 18 subjects (83.3%) detected as carriers by vaginal culture carried the same strain of GBS in urine. Therefore, an urinary culture appears to perform as well as the vaginal culture as a convenient test for GBS. Nineteen (16.2%) of 117 unmarried women had positive urinary cultures for GBS. Among the 19 with positive cultures for GBS, 3 (15.8%) were type Ia, 3 (15.8%) were type Ib, 8 (42.0%) were type III and 5 (26.4%) were other types. Type II was not detected. From the type-specific antibody assay, the histogram of ODI (optimal density index) frequency of types Ia, Ib and III showed a concentration in a relatively narrow range at low ODI, while that of type II was dispersed over a relatively wide range."

Direct gas-liquid chromatography (GLC) analysis was made, bacterial isolation and identification were carried out, and comparisons were made with results from GLC analysis and anaerobic isolates in a PYG medium. In addition, antibiotic susceptibilities of anaerobic bacteria were examined. Results 1. Anaerobic bacteria were isolated from 85 of 100 cases of obstructive abscesses. Of the 85, 49 were cases of mixed infection involving both anaerobic and aerobic bacteria; and 64 cases were involved with more than 2 species of anaerobic bacteria. Of the 184 strains of anaerobic isolates, 53 were Bacteroides sp. and 51 were Peptostreptococcus sp. The 2 groups accounted for more than half of the isolates. 2. Group A, in which no VFA was detected, accounted for 17 out of 100 cases. Group B, in which acetic acid was detected, accounted for 20 cases; and Group C, in which butyric acid was detected, accounted for 20 cases; and Group D, in which iso-valeric acid was detected, accounted for 8 cases. Direct GLC analysis revealed iso-caproic and caproic acids in the 35 cases constituting Group E. 3. Whereas the percentage of anaerobic bacteria was 64.7% in Group A and 60% in Group B, significantly higher percentages were noted in Group C (95%), Group D (100%) and Group E (100%). The following species were isolated as major member in the groups; Group A--Streptococcus intermedius, Group B--Peptostreptococcus micros, Group C--Fusobacterium nucleatum, Group D--Bacteroides gingivalis, and Group E--Peptostreptococcus anaerobius. 4. In all cases, the sum of VFA produced in the PYG medium by anaerobic isolates was classified into Group A' to E'. Ratios of agreement between VFA as revealed by direct GLC and VFA as revealed by PYG.GLC were as follows: Group A-A'; 47.1%, Group B-B' and C-C'; 45%, Group D-D'; 87.5%, and Group E-E'; 62.9%. 5. In Group B, no propionic acid was detected. The 2 cases in which acetic acid occurred in a concentration greater than 14 x 10(-4) meq/ml belonged to Group B'. In Group C, no isobutyric acid was detected; and the 5 cases in which butyric acid was detected in a concentration of more than 7 x 10(-4) meq/ml belonged to Group C'.

CD010502,0,8423107,0,Role of antigen-presenting cells in activation of human T cells by the streptococcal M protein superantigen: requirement for secreted and membrane-associated costimulatory factors.,"The requirements for T-cell activation by the streptococcal superantigen (SAg), pepsin-extracted M protein from type 5 streptococci (pep M5), were studied by monitoring Ca2+ influx and cell proliferation. Cells from a pep M5-specific T-cell line showed no change in intracellular Ca2+ levels in response to pep M5 when added alone or with freshly isolated autologous antigen-presenting cells (APC). However, after being incubated with pep M5 overnight, the APC secreted soluble factors that together with pep M5 induced a marked increase in intracellular Ca2+ levels in pep M5-specific T cells or freshly isolated, purified T cells. Removal of the SAg from the overnight APC-derived supernatants resulted in loss of the Ca(2+)-mobilizing activity, which was restored within seconds of addition of SAg, suggesting that both the SAg and the soluble factors synergize to induce the Ca2+ influx. Induction of cell proliferation required additional signals inasmuch as the activated APC-derived supernatant failed to synergize with pep M5 to induce the proliferation of purified T cells and required the presence of phorbol myristate acetate for this activity. Metabolically inactive, fixed APC were impaired in their ability to present pep M5 to T cells. Presentation of pep M5 by fixed APC was, however, restored when the APC-derived soluble costimulatory factors were added to the culture. Our data suggest that pep M5-induced activation of T cells is dependent on APC-derived soluble factors and an APC membrane-associated costimulatory molecule(s). These interactions may be important in regulating the in vivo responses to M proteins, could contribute to the severity or progression of infections with Streptococcus pyogenes, and may influence the susceptibility of individuals to its associated nonsuppurative autoimmune sequelae."

Colonization by serotype VIII GBS was associated with significantly higher serum concentrations of serotype-specific antibodies (geometric mean [GM], 5.53 micro g/mL), compared with both noncolonization (1.53 micro g/mL) and colonization with other serotypes (2.19 micro g/mL). There was excellent correlation between antibody levels in mothers and those in their neonates. The prevalence of positive antibody levels, when arbitrarily defined, according to antibody levels in neonatal sepsis (GM, 0.49 micro g/mL) as >1.0 micro g/mL, was 58% of all pregnant women and 85% of the women colonized by serotype VIII. This high serotype prevalence may explain, at least in part, why serotype VIII causes early-onset neonatal disease at rates lower than those which would be expected on the basis of its prevalence in mothers in Japan who are colonized by GBS."
CD010502,0,12700052,0,Autoimmunity and molecular mimicry in the pathogenesis of post-streptococcal heart disease.,"Molecular mimicry between pathogen and host has been proposed as a mechanism for the development of autoimmune diseases. Evidence suggests that microorganisms contain proteins which are similar enough to host proteins that they can stimulate existing B and T cells to respond to self proteins. The loss of immune regulation during responses against microbial antigens may explain development of pathogenic B and T cell responses in autoimmune diseases associated with infections. The study of B and T cell responses against the group A streptococcal antigens, N-acetyl-glucosamine, M protein and the autoantigen cardiac myosin has led to a better understanding of how molecular mimicry may play a role in disease. Studies of human monoclonal antibodies, T cell responses and animal models in comparison with the immunopathology in the human disease has provided information about the steps leading to inflammatory heart disease in autoimmune post-streptococcal rheumatic carditis. The new data indicate that the steps in pathogenesis of rheumatic heart disease following group A streptococcal infection include the following events. First, the development of crossreactive autoantibodies against the group A streptococcal carbohydrate antigen N-acetyl-glucosamine and cardiac myosin. Second, these antibodies react with valvular endothelium which becomes inflamed with expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1). After this event, T cells, CD4+ and CD8+, infiltrate through the endothelium/endocardium into the valve which is an avascular structure. Aschoff bodies or granulomatous lesions may form containing macrophages and T cells underneath the endocardium. The T cells are responsive to streptococcal M protein antigen sequences. The valve becomes scarred with eventual neovascularization and progressive, chronic disease in the valve. In the host, the mimicking antigens cardiac myosin and laminin have been involved in the myocardium and valve, respectively. As in other autoimmune diseases, both environmental and genetic factors are involved in the development of rheumatic carditis and inflammatory heart disease, a result of mimicry between the group A streptococcus and heart."
CD010502,0,11373317,0,Immunohistochemical detection of interferon-gamma: fake or fact?,"Immunohistochemistry is a widely accepted tool to investigate the presence and immunolocalization of cytokines in tissue sections at the protein level. We have tested the specificity and reproducibility of IFNgamma immunohistochemistry on tissue sections with a large panel of anti-IFNgamma antibodies. Thirteen different commercially available anti-IFNgamma antibodies, including seven advertised and/or regularly applied for immunohistochemistry/-cytochemistry, were tested using a three-step streptavidin-biotin-peroxidase technique and a two-step immunofluorescence (FACS) analysis. Immunoenzyme double staining was used to identify the IFNgamma-positive cells. Serial cryostat sections were used of human reactive hyperplastic tonsils, rheumatoid synovium, and inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysms, known to possess a prominent Th1-type immune response. In vitro phorbol myristate acetate/ionomycin-stimulated T-cells served as positive control; unstimulated cells served as negative control. Cultured T-cells were used adhered to glass slides (immunocytochemistry), in suspension (FACS), or snap-frozen and sectioned (immunohistochemistry). Immunocytochemistry and FACS analysis on stimulated cultured T-cells showed positive staining results with 12 of 13 anti-IFNgamma antibodies. However, immunohistochemistry of sectioned stimulated T-cells was negative with all. Unstimulated cells were consistently negative. IFNgamma immunohistochemical single- and double staining analysis of the tissue sections showed huge variations in staining patterns, including positivity for smooth muscle cells (n = 8), endothelial cells (n = 4), extracellular matrix (n = 4), and CD138+ plasma cells (n = 12). Specific staining of T-cells, as the sole positive staining, was not achieved with any of the 13 antibodies. IFNgamma-immunohistochemistry appears unreliable because of lack of specificity to stain T-cells in situ. In fact, depending on the type of anti-IFNgamma antibody used, a variety of different cell constituents were nonspecifically stained. Consequently, data based on IFNgamma-immunohistochemistry must be interpreted with great caution."

Paired sera were tested using immunofluorescence or enzyme immunoassay methods to establish the serologic diagnosis. In 18 patients (18%), there was evidence of acute infection with Mycoplasma pneumoniae, compared with 3% in the control group (p = 0.0006). In 10 of these patients there was evidence of infection with at least one additional pathogen, a respiratory virus in 7. There was no significant difference between the study groups in the rates of acute infection by Chlamydia pneumoniae (8% in the hospitalized patients versus 6% in the control subjects), Legionella spp. (5 versus 3%, respectively), or Coxiella burnettii (no patients in either group). We conclude that of these four atypical pathogens, only infection with M. pneumoniae is associated with hospitalization for acute exacerbation of bronchial asthma. In most of these M. pneumoniae patients there is evidence of infection with a respiratory virus as well. The pathophysiologic and therapeutic significance of these findings should be tested in further studies specifically designed to address these questions."

Bacterial adherence was quantitated either by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique with specific antibacterial serum as the first antibody followed by peroxidase-conjugated second antibody or by using biotinylated bacteria and avidin-peroxidase as the detecting agent. Unlabeled Escherichia coli and purified E. coli 987P fimbriae inhibited the adherence of biotinylated E. coli to immobilized enterocytes. The adherence of a mannose-sensitive strain of E. coli to immobilized oral epithelial cells was inhibited by mannose derivatives. The adherence of fimbriated E. coli 987P to immobilized enterocytes was approximately four times higher than the adherence of a nonfimbriated variant of the same strain. The adherence of Streptococcus pyogenes to oral cells was detected in the range of 10 to 150 bacteria per cell and was inhibited by lipoteichoic acid and albumin. The data suggest that the putative receptors which bind bacteria on the immobilized cells retain a functional form similar to that of native cells in suspension. The proposed adherence assay is easy to perform, allows the detection of specific adherence of test bacteria, and provides objective quantitation of adherence with a sensitivity of 10 bacteria per cell. Most importantly, the assay allows the testing of many variables in the same day."

To investigate this possibility, we examined serum antibody titers for various members of the 60 kDa family of HSPs and their implications with regard to a role for HSP60s in Behçet's disease. We isolated HSP60 of Streptococcus pyogenes from the margin of oral aphthae in one Behçet's disease patient with severe uveoretinitis and the HSP60s of Yersinia enterocolitica, retinoblastoma cell line clone Y79, and bovine retinal extract and investigated the reaction of each of these HSP60s with 100-fold diluted serum samples from 20 Behçet's disease patients using anti-HSP60 antibody titers determined by ELISA. The anti- Streptococcus HSP60 antibody and anti-retinal HSP60 antibody titers of the 100-fold diluted serum samples from the Behçet's disease patients were both significantly higher than those of similarly diluted serum samples from healthy donors. The results of the ELISA antibody titer assay showed that, although the various HSP60s share a common basic antigenicity, they differed in reactivity to the anti-HSP60 antibodies in the sera of the Behçet's disease patients. The results indicate that subtle but significant differences exist in the antigenicity of the various HSP60s tested, all of which share a common basic antigenicity and are of approximately the same molecular weight, and suggest that an immuno-cross-reaction between retinal and streptococcal HSPs and a related autoimmune response may be involved in the development of Behçet's disease."

CD010502,0,10722575,0,Identification of a fibronectin binding protein from Streptococcus mutans.,"The interaction of viridans streptococci with components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of infective endocarditis. We have identified a surface protein of Streptococcus mutans which binds the ECM constituent fibronectin (Fn). Initially, we found that S. mutans could adsorb soluble Fn in plasma, but with lower efficiency than Streptococcus pyogenes. In addition, S. mutans could bind immobilized Fn in a dose-dependent manner when tested using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Crude extracts of cell wall-associated proteins or extracellular proteins from S. mutans MT8148 specifically bound Fn through a protein with the molecular mass of ca. 130 kDa, as detected by far-Western immunoblotting. The candidate Fn binding protein (FBP-130) was purified to near homogeneity by using Fn coupled Sepharose 4B affinity column chromatography. A rabbit polyclonal antibody against FBP-130 reacted specifically with a protein of molecular mass of ca. 130 kDa in both cell wall and extracellular fractions, and the abundance of FBP was higher in the former than in the latter fractions. The purified FBP bound specifically to immobilized Fn, whereas the binding of soluble Fn to coated FBP could only be detected in the presence of high concentrations of Fn. The purified FBP, as well as anti-FBP immunoglobulin G, inhibited the adherence of S. mutans to immobilized Fn and endothelial cells (ECV304) in a dose-dependent manner. These results demonstrated that FBP-130 mediated the adherence of S. mutans specifically to Fn and endothelial cells in vitro. The characteristics of S. mutans and FBP-130 in binding Fn confirmed that viridans streptococci adopt different strategies in their interaction with ECM."

Antibodies to Streptococcus pyogenes cell-associated proteins and to proteins released by rapidly dividing S. pyogenes were compared in four patient groups with different post-streptococcal diseases and in healthy controls. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays showed that total Ig and IgG to extracellular antigens were significantly higher in patients with acute rheumatic fever (ARF) compared to healthy controls, but no differences were found in either total Ig or IgG titres to cell-associated proteins between any of the groups. Western blotting showed that multiple extracellular and cell-associated antigens, covering a wide range of molecular masses, were recognised by all sera, including healthy controls. No evidence was obtained for putative dominant antigens associated with any disease group, although a low molecular mass cell-associated protein (approximately 4 kDa) was clearly recognised by two-thirds of subjects irrespective of disease status. These findings demonstrate that raised serum Ig and IgG titres to extracellular, but not cell-associated, S. pyogenes antigens are a feature of ARF in this population, and suggest that multiple S. pyogenes antigens contribute to this response."

MIC50 and MIC90 of antibiotics tested were determined by agar dilution method according to CA-SFM guidelines. Macrolide resistance genes (ermA, ermB, mef) were detected by PCR. Genetic diversity of erythromycin-resistant isolates was analysed by pulsotypic method after digestion by SmaI (Finger-printing II, Biorad)."
CD010502,0,12030969,0,A link between parotid salivary Ig level and recurrent respiratory infections in young Down's syndrome patients.,The purpose of the present investigation was to assess the correlation between recurrent respiratory infections and the levels of salivary Ig in a group of young Down's syndrome (DS) individuals. Twenty-three DS and 10 age- and sex-matched healthy individuals were included. DS individuals who had experienced three or more upper respiratory tract infections (n = 10) in the previous 12 months were compared to DS individuals who had not experienced recurrent respiratory infections (n = 13) and to healthy controls (n = 10). A statistically significant reduction in the Ig salivary secretion rate was recorded in the subgroup with recurrent respiratory infections. No significant differences were seen between the subgroup without recurrent respiratory infections and controls. It is suggested that the secretory immune system provides local immune protection against pathogens in the respiratory tract. Detection of salivary Ig levels may serve as a predictor of the susceptibility of DS individuals to recurrent respiratory tract infections.

Strains vary widely in terms of antibiotic resistance (AbR), clinical severity, and transmission rate. Currently, strain identification is achieved by emm typing (direct sequencing of the genomic segment coding for the antigenic portion of the M protein) or by multilocus genotyping methods. Phenotype analysis, including critical AbR typing, is generally achieved by much slower and more laborious direct culture-based methods."

Discordants were resolved by Lancefield typing of beta-hemolytic colonies. After culture, swabs were randomly assigned to be tested by Directigen within 4 h of sampling or after overnight storage. For swabs that yielded more than 50 beta-hemolytic colonies from culture, there was a highly significant difference (P less than 0.01) in sensitivity between the group tested early and the group tested after storage overnight. For swabs tested within 4 h of sampling, a trend (P = 0.07) existed between sensitivity and length of delay before testing."
CD010502,0,8740854,0,Rapid detection of group B streptococcal colonization of the genital tract by a commercial optical immunoassay.,"The performance of a commercial optical immunoassay (OIA) was compared at two institutions with that of routine agar and broth culture methods for the detection of group B streptococcal (GBS) colonization of the genital tract. The Strep B OIA (Bio Star, USA) was used to test 962 vaginal swabs from pregnant women for the presence of GBS antigen. The prevalence of GBS vaginal colonization in this population was 22.4%. The OIA results were compared with those of culture on trypticase soy agar with 5% sheep blood (TSA) and broth enhanced culture (Lim broth). Sensitivity and specificity values of the OIA method compared to TSA culture alone were 82.5% and 91.8%, respectively. The sensitivity of the OIA method was equivalent to that of TSA culture (62.4% vs. 64.4%; p > 0.5, chi 2 = 0.01) when the data were compared with broth culture. The extent of colonization affected the sensitivity of the OIA method: 100% of 4+, 94% of 3+, 96% of 2+, and 63% of 1+ TSA plates were detected by the OIA test. The commercial OIA method demonstrated sensitivity equivalent to that of TSA culture for the detection of GBS colonization. The OIA test offers two additional advantages over culture: reduced time required to obtain results (30 min vs. days) and the ability to detect GBS antigen in samples with compromised viability. The results of this study suggest that the Strep B OIA test can be a useful diagnostic tool in the management of early-onset GBS disease."
CD010502,0,22815998,0,Complement inhibitors from scabies mites promote streptococcal growth--a novel mechanism in infected epidermis?,"Scabies is highly prevalent in socially disadvantaged communities such as indigenous populations and in developing countries. Generalized itching causes discomfort to the patient; however, serious complications can occur as a result of secondary bacterial pyoderma, commonly caused by Streptococcus pyogenes (GAS) or Staphylococcus aureus. In the tropics, skin damage due to scabies mite infestations has been postulated to be an important link in the pathogenesis of disease associated with acute rheumatic fever and heart disease, poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis and systemic sepsis. Treatment of scabies decreases the prevalence of infections by bacteria. This study aims to identify the molecular mechanisms underlying the link between scabies and GAS infections."
CD010502,0,10464209,0,Regulation of mga transcription in the group A streptococcus: specific binding of mga within its own promoter and evidence for a negative regulator.,"Transcription of mga, encoding the multiple virulence gene regulator of the group A streptococcus, is positively autoregulated. This regulation requires a DNA region (Pmga) that contains both a promoter proximal to mga (P2) and a promoter located further upstream (P1). To determine if Mga has a direct role in this process, its ability to bind to specific sequences within Pmga was tested. A purified fusion of Mga to the C-terminal end of maltose-binding protein (MBP-Mga), encoded by malE-mga, was shown previously to bind to the promoter regions of Mga-regulated genes, including scpA and emm. We report here that MBP-Mga can function in vivo to regulate emm and mga. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and DNase I footprinting were used to demonstrate specific binding of MBP-Mga to two ca. 59-bp binding sites in Pmga centered around bases -108 and -180 from the major P2 start of transcription. Mga binding sites from Pemm and PscpA were shown to compete for binding at the two Pmga sites, suggesting that the same domain of Mga interacts at all of these promoter targets. Deletion of the distal Pmga binding site (site I) in vivo resulted in loss of Mga-dependent transcription from the P2 start. However, the same lesion resulted in an increase in P1 transcription that was independent of Mga. This suggests the existence of a repressor of mga transcription with a binding site overlapping those of Mga."
CD010502,0,19276078,0,Serum opacity factor is a streptococcal receptor for the extracellular matrix protein fibulin-1.,"The adhesion of bacteria to host tissues is often mediated by interactions with extracellular matrices. Herein, we report on the interactions of the group A streptococcus, Streptococcus pyogenes, with the extracellular matrix protein fibulin-1. S. pyogenes bound purified fibulin-1 in a dose-dependent manner. Genetic ablation of serum opacity factor (SOF), a virulence determinant of S. pyogenes, reduced binding by approximately 50%, and a recombinant peptide of SOF inhibited binding of fibulin-1 to streptococci by approximately 45%. Fibulin-1 bound to purified SOF2 in a dose-dependent manner with high affinity (K(d) = 1.6 nm). The fibulin-1-binding domain was localized to amino acid residues 457-806 of SOF2, whereas the fibronectin-binding domain is contained within residues 807-931 of SOF2, indicating that these two domains are separate and distinct. Fibulin-1 bound to recombinant SOF from M types 2, 4, 28, and 75 of S. pyogenes, indicating that the fibulin-1-binding domain is likely conserved among SOF from different serotypes. Mixed binding experiments suggested that gelatin, fibronectin, fibulin-1, and SOF form a quaternary molecular complex that enhanced the binding of fibulin-1. These data indicate that S. pyogenes can interact with fibulin-1 and that SOF is a major streptococcal receptor for fibulin-1 but not the only receptor. Such interactions with fibulin-1 may be involved in the adhesion of S. pyogenes to extracellular matrices of the host."
CD010502,0,3314321,0,Influence of antibiotic treatment on the isolation rate of group A streptococci from peritonsillar abscesses.,"In a prospective one-year study, group A streptococci were cultured from pus specimens from 13 of 71 patients (18%) with peritonsillar abscesses. The isolation rate was significantly lower (7/57 = 12%) in patients who had received antibiotic treatment before specimen collection than in patients who had not received such treatment (6/12 = 50%). Group A streptococcus antigen detection tests on pus, using a commercially available diagnostic kit, had a low sensitivity (5/13 = 38%). It was concluded that in patients treated with antibiotics prior to collection of specimens, the absence of group A streptococcus on culture does not rule out that this organism could have been the principal etiologic agent."

CD010502,0,19609313,0,Enhanced proliferation and activation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in patients with psoriasis vulgaris mediated by streptococcal antigen with bacterial DNA.,"Streptococcal infection is believed to have an intimate relationship with psoriasis, although the pathogenic role of streptococcal DNA is not fully understood. To gain a clearer understanding of these dynamics, we investigated the effect of streptococcal DNA on lymphocyte proliferation and activation as well as cytokine secretion in psoriasis. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from psoriatic patients had higher proliferative responses upon stimulation by streptococcal antigen (SA) when compared with those from healthy individuals. Strikingly, this enhanced proliferation of PBMCs was attenuated after administration of SA treated with DNase-I. In addition, CD69 expression levels on T cells, including skin-homing lymphocyte cutaneous lymphocyte-associated antigen positive T cells, and IFN-alpha secretion by PBMCs were also attenuated in patients after stimulation with SA without nucleic acid (non-nucleic acid SA, non-NASA) compared with stimulation with untreated SA. However, activation marker CD86 expression levels on B cells as well as the secretion of IFN-gamma and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha following stimulation with SA or non-NASA were not significantly altered. Interestingly, the attenuated T-cell activation and IFN-alpha secretion in psoriatic patients could be reconstituted when stimulated by non-NASA combined with synthetic CpG-A, but not when combined with synthetic CpG-B. This study demonstrates the integral function of SA, particularly streptococcal DNA, in the pathogenesis of psoriasis."
CD010502,0,15713613,0,Sample type is crucial to the diagnosis of Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia by PCR.,"Sensitive and specific methods for rapid laboratory diagnosis of Mycoplasma pneumoniae were not available until nucleic acid amplification methods were developed. The choice of sample type and method of sampling are crucial to optimal diagnostic efficacy. Three types of respiratory samples from 32 young military conscripts with pneumonia were collected during an outbreak of M. pneumoniae infection. Sputum, nasopharyngeal aspirate and throat swab specimens were tested by 16S rRNA gene-based PCR with liquid-phase probe hybridization, and the results were compared with serology. The PCR result was positive for 22 (69 %) of the sputa, 16 (50 %) of the aspirates and 12 (37.5 %) of the swabs. Serology with increasing or high titres supported the positive findings in all instances. Sputum, when available, is clearly the best sample type for young adults with pneumonia."
CD010502,0,2968502,0,"Distribution of IgG subclasses among human autoantibodies to Sm, RNP, dsDNA, SS-B and IgG rheumatoid factor.","The IgG subclass distribution of human autoantibodies to Sm, double-stranded DNA (ds-DNA), ribonucleoprotein (RNP), SS-B (La), and IgG rheumatoid factor (RF) have been determined using sensitive ELISA or by indirect immunofluorescence on Crithidia lucilia in sera from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Sjögren's syndrome, and rheumatoid arthritis. For anti-Sm and anti-RNP, IgG1 was the predominant isotype. For anti-ds-DNA and anti-SS-B, IgG1 and a lesser contribution of IgG3 was found. In contrast, IgG1 and IgG4 were the predominant isotypes of human IgG RF. The preponderance of isotypes noted for these autoantibodies did not extend to the IgG subclass distribution for antibodies to trinitrophenol-bovine serum albumin (TNP), tetanus toxoid (Tet. tox.), pneumococcal polysaccharides (Pneumo), and group A streptococcal cell walls (Strep.). The restriction of human humoral responses as well as autoantibodies has both pathogenetic and immunoregulatory implications, and suggests that for these autoantibodies, T-cell-dependent responses, probably driven by antigen, are of importance."
CD010502,0,8857785,0,Use of the rapid streptococcus test in extrapharyngeal sites.,"The rapid ""strep"" test is established as a valuable tool for the management of pharyngitis. Because of the recent increase in reports of serious, rapidly progressive streptococcal soft tissue infections, the test can also be useful in determining early management of skin infections.

CD010502,0,15205431,0,Multilocus sequence typing of Streptococcus pyogenes representing most known emm types and distinctions among subpopulation genetic structures.,"A long-term goal is to characterize the full range of genetic diversity within Streptococcus pyogenes as it exists in the world today. Since the emm locus is subject to strong diversifying selection, emm type was used as a guide for identifying a genetically diverse set of strains. This report contains a description of multilocus sequence typing based on seven housekeeping loci for 495 isolates representing 158 emm types, yielding 238 unique combinations of sequence type and emm type. A genotypic marker for tissue site preference (emm pattern) revealed that only 17% of the emm types displayed the marker representing strong preference for infection at the throat and that 39% of emm types had the marker for skin tropism, whereas 41% of emm types harbored the marker for no obvious tissue site preference. As a group, the emm types bearing the emm pattern marker indicative of no obvious tissue site preference were far less likely to have two distinct emm types associated with the same sequence type than either of the two subpopulations having markers for strong tissue tropisms (P < 0.002). In addition, all genetic diversification events clearly ascribed to a recombinational mechanism involved strains of only two of the emm pattern-defined subpopulations, those representing skin specialists and generalists. The findings suggest that the population genetic structure differs for the tissue-defined subpopulations of S. pyogenes. The observed differences may partly reflect differential host immune selection pressures."

CD010502,0,15590288,0,Micromachined polymerase chain reaction system for multiple DNA amplification of upper respiratory tract infectious diseases.,"This paper presents a micro polymerase chain reaction (PCR) chip for the DNA-based diagnosis of microorganism genes and the detection of their corresponding antibiotic-resistant genes. The micro PCR chip comprises cheap biocompatible soda-lime glass substrates with integrated thin-film platinum resistors as heating/sensing elements, and is fabricated using micro-electro-mechanical-system (MEMS) techniques in a reliable batch-fabrication process. The heating and temperature sensing elements are made of the same material and are located inside the reaction chamber in order to ensure a uniform temperature distribution. This study performs the detection of several genes associated with upper respiratory tract infection microorganisms, i.e. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemopilus influenze, Staphylococcu aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Neisseria meningitides, together with their corresponding antibiotic-resistant genes. The lower thermal inertia of the proposed micro PCR chip relative to conventional bench-top PCR systems enables a more rapid detection operation with reduced sample and reagent consumption. The experimental data reveal that the high heating and cooling rates of the system (20 and 10 degrees C/s, respectively) permit successful DNA amplification within 15 min. The micro PCR chip is also capable of performing multiple DNA amplification, i.e. the simultaneous duplication of multiple genes under different conditions in separate reaction wells. Compared with the large-scale PCR system, it is greatly advantageous for fast diagnosis of multiple infectious diseases. Multiplex PCR amplification of two DNA segments in the same well is also feasible using the proposed micro device. The developed micro PCR chip provides a crucial tool for genetic analysis, molecular biology, infectious disease detection, and many other biomedical applications."
CD010502,0,11211972,0,Distribution and sequence variations of selected virulence genes among group A streptococcal isolates from western Norway.,"In order to compare the distribution of selected virulence genes among group A streptococci recovered from invasive disease and superficial infections, 42 isolates were screened for mga, speB, speA, ssa and ska, by PCR. The isolates were predominantly of the sequence types emm1, emm3 and emm6, but also included a few of the types emm22, emm28, emm75 and emm78. The phage-mediated speA seemed to be prevalent in emm types 1 and 3, and its distribution was not related to disease severity. The other genes were present in all isolates. The mga, speB and speA were further studied by sequence analysis. Although allotypic associations with invasiveness were not found, allelic specificity to the emm sequence type was observed. In addition, the mga sequences indicated two lineages, related to opacity factor production. A possible recombination between these two main divergent mga genes was observed in isolates of the types emm22 and emm75. A logical nomenclature of the alleles of mga and speB is suggested."
CD010502,0,8366514,0,The serotypes of Streptococcus pyogenes present in Britain during 1980-1990 and their association with disease.,"A total of 16,909 cultures of Streptococcus pyogenes (Lancefield group A) isolated in Britain during 1980-90 were examined for T- and M-protein antigens. One or other M antigen was detected in 92.6% of the strains. The numbers of isolates of some serotypes, such as M3 and M12, did not show great variation from year-to-year, whereas there were nationwide epidemics, extending over several years, caused by strains of serotypes M1 and M49. Isolates of serotypes M1 and M3 were associated particularly with invasive disease and fatal infections. Representatives of serotypes M80, M81 and the provisional types PT180, PT1658 and PT5757 were isolated most often from cases of pyoderma. Erythromycin resistance was detected in 30 serotypes but one half of all of the resistant isolates belonged to serotype M4."
CD010502,0,9515677,0,Detection of adenovirus outbreak at a municipal swimming pool by nested PCR amplification.,"In July 1995 an outbreak of pharyngoconjuctivitis caused by adenoviruses occurred among athletes participating in a swimming contest in a town in southern Greece (Peloponnese). At least 80 persons displayed symptoms of the illness, with the predominant ones being high fever, sore throat, conjuctivitis, headache, and abdominal pain. Poor chlorination was probably the cause of the outbreak (residual chlorine <0.2 mg/l), as after hyperchlorination the spread of adenoviruses stopped. Rapid detection of adenoviruses in the municipal swimming pool water by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification allowed quick control of the outbreak."
CD010502,0,1873200,0,Altered cell-mediated immunity to group A haemolytic streptococcal antigens in chronic plaque psoriasis.,"The proliferative lymphocyte response to sonicated group A, beta-haemolytic streptococci (Strep-A) was measured by thymidine incorporation in 78 patients with psoriasis (guttate, chronic plaque or both). Lymphocytes from 72 of these patients were also cultured with streptokinase/streptodornase (SK/SD), and 20 of the patients with chronic plaque psoriasis were further tested with PPD, Candida albicans and sonicated Streptococcus mutans, a bacterial type not associated clinically with psoriasis. The median stimulation index (SI) of the psoriasis group to the Strep-A preparation was significantly higher than that of a group of 27 non-psoriatic individuals (P less than 0.05). Within this group, only the patients with chronic plaque psoriasis (n = 42) showed a significantly increased proliferative response compared to the non-psoriatic controls (median SI = 123.8 and 31.9, respectively, P less than 0.01). Although the lymphocyte response of the chronic plaque group to SK/SD was also markedly higher than that of the control group, this difference did not reach statistical significance. In addition, these patients did not show significantly increased responses to any of the other antigens tested, including S. mutans. No correlation was observed between the degree of proliferation to Strep-A and disease extent or activity. Similarly, ASO titres, which were raised in 11 out of 23 guttate and three out of nine chronic plaque psoriasis patients tested, did not correlate with the proliferative responses observed."

In this study we determined the sensitivity of the detection of Legionella pneumophila in simulated throat swab specimens by PCR. Next, we compared the sensitivity and specificity of a single throat swab PCR with the current tests for diagnosis of Legionella spp., M. pneumoniae, and C. pneumoniae in patients with lower respiratory tract infections. Patients' work-up included: (a) throat swab specimen for Legionella spp., M. pneumoniae, and C. pneumoniae PCR; (b) throat swab specimen for C. pneumoniae culture; (c) sputum specimen for L. pneumophila direct fluorescent antibody and culture; (d) urine specimen for L. pneumophila serogroup 1 antigen detection; and (e) serum specimen for L. pneumophila, M. pneumoniae, and C. pneumoniae acute and convalescent antibody titers. A total of 155 patients with lower respiratory infection were enrolled in this prospective study. Throat swab PCR was positive for Legionella spp. in five of the six patients with legionellosis, indicating the presence of this organism in the oropharynx of patients with Legionnaires disease. Mycoplasma pneumoniae PCR was positive in eight of the nine patients with mycoplasma infection. Chlamydia pneumoniae PCR was positive in the two patients with C. pneumoniae infection. None of the other 138 patients with negative PCR had other positive confirmatory tests for respiratory infection by these three organisms (100% specificity). PCR was able to detect 15 of the 17 infected (88.2%). Results of this investigation indicate that PCR on a single throat swab specimen is a rapid, sensitive, and specific test that may greatly simplify the diagnosis of lower respiratory infection caused by Legionella spp., Mycoplasma pneumoniae, or C. pneumoniae."

Relationship to a plasminogen activator produced by the same micro-organism.,"Plasminogen receptors have been identified on the surface of a number of prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. A receptor demonstrating high affinity for plasmin with minimal reactivity with the native zymogen Glu-plasminogen has been identified on the surface of certain group A streptococci. In this study the group A streptococcal plasmin receptor has been solubilized and purified to homogeneity. The isolated protein was an Mr approximately 41,000 molecule which retained its ability to bind plasmin following solubilization and affinity purification on a column of enzymatically inactivated human plasmin. The isolated plasmin receptor was compared functionally, antigenically, and physicochemically to the secreted plasminogen activator, streptokinase, produced by the same organism. The Mr approximately 41,000 surface plasmin receptor was shown to be functionally and antigenically distinct from the Mr approximately 48,000 streptokinase molecule produced by the same strain and lacked any plasminogen activator activity. The streptokinase molecule produced by this strain was shown to be closely related to the plasminogen activator protein secreted by other group A and C streptococci.

CD010502,0,18604573,1,Point-of-care testing of group A streptococcal antigen: performance evaluated by external quality assessment.,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the overall performance of rapid antigen detection (RAD) in group A streptococcus (GAS) in Finland by using the results of external quality assurance (EQA) samples. We also compared the performance of laboratory professionals to that of nursing professionals. Around 22,800 EQA results among a total of 383 laboratories and physician's offices were analysed. Vocational data on the personnel who carried out the tests were available for 10,088 EQA samples, 7,428 of which were tested by laboratory technicians and 2,531 by nursing staff. The best overall performance was found with GAS-negative samples: 99% of the reports were correct. In contrast, the overall performance was only 76% when the samples were weakly positive for GAS antigen. The laboratory technicians performed statistically significantly better than the nursing staff, with both strongly positive (correct results 98.9% vs. 95.1%, respectively; p<0.001) and weakly positive (79.3% vs. 65.3%, respectively; p<0.001) samples. With negative samples, no difference in performance between the laboratory and nursing staff was found (99.5% vs. 99.0%, respectively). The professional skills of the person performing the RAD test for GAS have a major impact on the sensitivity of the test. Based on the results of this study, we suggest that EQA-like artificial specimens could be used as a tool to improve and validate the quality of RAD testing in individual testing sites."
CD010502,0,12409399,1,"Performance characteristics and utilization of rapid antigen test, DNA probe, and culture for detection of group a streptococci in an acute care clinic.","Group A streptococcus (GAS) antigen testing has become a routine point-of-care (POC) test in acute care settings. Concern about performance parameters (PP) of these tests as well as inappropriate antibiotic use has resulted in various recommendations regarding diagnosis of GAS. There were two objectives in this study. The first was to evaluate the rapid GAS antigen test presently in use (Thermo BioStar, Boulder, Colo.) and the GAS Direct probe test (Gen-Probe, San Diego, Calif.) compared to culture. The second was to define the optimal use of these technologies in a large acute care pediatric clinic. A total of 520 consecutive pediatric patients presenting with symptoms of pharyngitis at any of three Lahey Clinic acute care facilities were evaluated. Pharyngeal specimens were collected using a double-swab collection device (Copan, Corona, Calif.). One swab was used for the antigen test, the second was used for the probe test, and the pledget was placed in the collection device for culture on 5% sheep blood agar, incubated for 48 h anaerobically, and subsequently placed in Todd-Hewitt broth. After discrepant analysis, sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were as follows: 94.8, 100, 100, and 96.9% for the probe test and 86.1, 97.1, 93.7, and 93.4% for the antigen test, respectively. Sensitivity using an enhanced culture technique was 99.4% (163 of 164). False-positive (FP) antigen results were often seen from patients previously diagnosed and/or treated for GAS. No FP results were seen with the probe test. Colony counts for the false-negative (FN) antigen tests were higher than those for the FN probe tests. Compared to culture and DNA probe, the rapid antigen test (RAT) offered a result at the time of the patient's visit, with acceptable PP when prevalence of disease is high. Follow-up testing with the RAT of GAS patients who previously tested as positive should be avoided due to increased FP results. The probe test was comparable to culture in performance. Results indicate the probe test can be used as the primary test or as a backup to negative antigen tests. The probe test offers the advantage over culture of same-day reporting of a final result but, in contrast to a POC test, necessitates follow-up communication to the patient. Preliminary data show the specificity of the probe test to be greater than that of the RAT for patients previously diagnosed with GAS."
CD010502,0,21049032,0,Detection of Mycoplasma pneumoniae in simulated and true clinical throat swab specimens by nanorod array-surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy.,"The prokaryote Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a major cause of respiratory disease in humans, accounting for 20% of all community-acquired pneumonia and the leading cause of pneumonia in older children and young adults. The limitations of existing options for mycoplasma diagnosis highlight a critical need for a new detection platform with high sensitivity, specificity, and expediency. Here we evaluated silver nanorod arrays (NA) as a biosensing platform for detection and differentiation of M. pneumoniae in culture and in spiked and true clinical throat swab samples by surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). Three M. pneumoniae strains were reproducibly differentiated by NA-SERS with 95%-100% specificity and 94-100% sensitivity, and with a lower detection limit exceeding standard PCR. Analysis of throat swab samples spiked with M. pneumoniae yielded detection in a complex, clinically relevant background with >90% accuracy and high sensitivity. In addition, NA-SERS correctly classified with >97% accuracy, ten true clinical throat swab samples previously established by real-time PCR and culture to be positive or negative for M. pneumoniae. Our findings suggest that the unique biochemical specificity of Raman spectroscopy, combined with reproducible spectral enhancement by silver NA, holds great promise as a superior platform for rapid and sensitive detection and identification of M. pneumoniae, with potential for point-of-care application."
CD010502,0,22339680,0,Experimental poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis elicited by IgG Fc-binding M family proteins and blocked by IgG Fc fragment.,"The pathogenesis of acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (APSGN), a major nonsuppurative complication of group A streptococcal (GAS) throat or skin disease, remains unclear. During the years, various theories based on certain streptococcal extracellular factors, as well as immunological mimicry between streptococci and renal tissue, have been forwarded. We earlier reported that many clinical GAS isolates with documented nephritogenic capacity show non-immune binding of monomeric or aggregated IgG. Moreover, in a rabbit model of APSGN we obtained evidence for an important role of streptococcal IgG Fc binding proteins (IgGFcBPs) belonging to the M family surface proteins; thus, hyperimmunization by whole IgGFcBP-positive streptococci was shown to induce renal glomerular changes with deposition of IgG and complement C3, resembling the picture recorded in human APSGN. These typical renal changes were always preceded by the appearance of circulating anti-IgG antibodies. In the present work, using the same rabbit model, each of two purified IgGFcBPs, isolated from type M22 GAS, were found to elicit glomerular degenerative damage comparable to that caused by whole bacteria, as well as formation of anti-IgG. In addition, the induction by whole streptococci (type M1) of experimental APSGN was inhibited by the i.v. administration of purified human or rabbit IgG Fc, but not Fab, fragment, supporting the importance of Fc-mediated mechanisms in causation of glomerulonephritis. We propose that anti-IgG antibody, induced by streptococcal IgGFcBP, facilitated renal accumulation of IgG-containing complexes, which in turn triggered complement deposition and proinflammatory cascades. Further studies on the possible beneficial effect of IgG Fc fragment in APSGN should be of interest."
CD010502,0,6417016,0,Study of heart-reactive antibody in antisera and hybridoma culture fluids against group A streptococci.,"Heart-reactive antibody is known to be produced in animals immunized with group A streptococci. However, the detection and quantitation of these antibodies and their respective antigens have been limited to immunofluorescence or immunoprecipitation tests. In this study a more sensitive technique was used to detect heart-reactive antibody, i.e., the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Countercurrent immunoelectrophoresis and agar gel immunodiffusion were also used to confirm the reactivity of rabbit antisera to group A streptococci and human heart tissue. Human heart tissue antigen was prepared by Triton X-100 extraction, and checkerboard titrations of heart tissue antigen versus streptococcal antisera revealed optimal concentrations of each for the ELISA. When immune rabbit serum was reacted with heart tissue antigen, a 5- to 10-fold increase was observed over the reactions of preimmune sera controls. Streptococcal antiserum was found to have a six- to eightfold greater reactivity with heart tissue antigen than with similar concentrations of kidney and skeletal muscle antigens. Heart tissue antigen was partially purified by DEAE-cellulose chromatography, and quantities of greater than 10 to 100 ng (dry weight) were shown to react with streptococcal antisera in the ELISA. Heart, kidney, and skeletal muscle antigens were subjected to electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gel slabs and blotted onto a nitrocellulose filter. These filter blots reacted with streptococcal antisera and confirmed the tissue antigen specificity observed with the ELISA. In addition, the ELISA was found to be an effective method for the detection of heart-reactive antibodies produced by murine hybridomas that were producing antibody to group A streptococci."
CD010502,0,14702157,0,Identification of new candidate vaccine antigens made by Streptococcus pyogenes: purification and characterization of 16 putative extracellular lipoproteins.,"Putative extracellular lipoproteins made by group A Streptococcus (GAS) are the focus of this study, which was designed to identify new candidate vaccine antigens. Bioinformatic analysis of a serotype M1 GAS strain identified 30 open-reading frames encoding putative lipoproteins. The genes encoding the mature form of 29 of these proteins were cloned, and 16 recombinant proteins were overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified to apparent homogeneity. The genes encoding these 16 proteins were highly conserved in GAS strains for which genome sequence data are available (serotypes M1, M3, M5, M12, M18, and M28). Mice inoculated subcutaneously with GAS and humans with GAS pharyngitis and invasive infections seroconverted to most of the 16 recombinant proteins, which indicates that these lipoproteins were produced during infection. The blood of mice actively immunized with 5 of the 16 recombinant proteins had significantly (P<.05) increased growth-inhibitory activity, compared with the blood of unimmunized mice, which identified these proteins as potential new vaccine candidates."

A rapid identification test of Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci (GABHS) was used to initiate the therapy; however, a positive tonsillar/pharyngeal culture was required at pretreatment to determine if the patient was assessable. Another culture was repeated at least 2 days after the 10 days of drug therapy. From 164 patients enrolled (mean age, 27.7 years; range, 14 to 60 years), 141 were assessable for efficacy; 22 patients were excluded because they did not have a positive culture at pretreatment and 1 patient did not complete the study due to a side effect (rash). All patients were included in the safety analysis. Patients received either clindamycin hydrochloride capsules 150 mg four times per day (QID) or clindamycin hydrochloride capsules 300 mg two times per day (BID) and placebo capsules BID for 10 days. There were no significant differences between groups in terms of demographics, medical history, and evolution of symptoms. The clinical efficacy rate in the two groups at day 12 was as follows: QID group--cured, 64 (92.8%) of 69 patients; improved, 5 (7.2%) of 69 patients; BID group--cured, 67 (93.1%) of 72 patients; improved, 5 (6.9%) of 72 patients.

CD010502,0,9542906,0,Group A streptococcal Vir types are M-protein gene (emm) sequence type specific.,"The M-protein genes (emm genes) of 103 separate impetiginous Streptococcus pyogenes isolates were sequenced and the sequence types were compared to the types obtained by Vir typing. Vir typing is based on restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of a 4- to 7-kb pathogenicity island encoding emm and other virulence genes. By using both HaeIII and HinfI to generate RFLP profiles, complete concordance between Vir type and emm sequence type was found. Comparison of the emm sequences with those in GenBank revealed new sequence types sharing less than 90% identity with known types. Diversity in the emm sequence was generated by corrected frameshift mutations, point mutations, and small in-frame mutations."

We conducted a retrospective cohort study that followed a convenience sample of 340 healthy children who participated in the Rochester Family Measles Study. Comprehensive medical record reviews determined asthma status by applying predetermined criteria. All laboratory test results of cultures, rapid antigen, and polymerase chain reaction tests for S. pyogenes infections during the first 18 years of life were collected to compare the incidence of S. pyogenes infections between asthmatic and nonasthmatic subjects. A Poisson regression was fit to determine the association between asthma and S. pyogenes infections controlling for other risk factors. Of the 340 subjects, we enrolled 327 who were eligible for this study. Of the 327 subjects, 114 (35%) had asthma. The incidences of S. pyogenes infections for asthmatic and nonasthmatic subjects were 0.25 per person-year and 0.18 per person-year, respectively. The adjusted risk ratio for asthma was 1.40 (95% CI, 1.12-1.74; p = 0.0029). Asthma in children is associated with an increased risk of S. pyogenes upper respiratory infections. The impact of asthma status on susceptibility to microbial infections needs to be considered in the context of a possible causal relationship between asthma and microbial infections. The mechanisms underlying this risk need to be elucidated."

An infectious mononucleosis-like disease with negative heterophil antibodies in otherwise healthy adults was described in 1965. We present six previously healthy adults with CMV mononucleosis observed in 1984. The diagnosis was established by CMV-IgM-ELISA. All patients were febrile for an average of 20 days. The general state of health was reduced in three patients; one patient suffered from headache and another from abdominal pain. Physical examination showed splenomegaly and mild tonsillitis in one patient each, but in no case lymphadenopathy. All patients had lymhocytosis with reactive forms (virocytes). Elevation of transaminases was seen in four cases. Compared to Epstein-Barr virus mononucleosis, fever in CMV mononucleosis lasts significantly longer and lymphadenopathy is evidently rarer. The combination of fever of unknown origin, a negative heterophil antibody titer and the presence of virocytes prompts suspicion of CMV mononucleosis."
CD010502,0,3012772,0,[Viral respiratory infections in children: new diagnostic methods for early detection. Initial results of a pilot project in Switzerland].,"The new methods of rapid viral diagnosis make it possible to specify a number of the most prevalent agents of respiratory tract infections within 24 hours. The techniques are based on the immunological detection of antigens of respiratory syncytial (RSV), adeno, parainfluenza type 1, 2 and 3, as well as of influenza A and B viruses in nasopharyngeal secretions. During a one-year period we have used these methods to evaluate diagnostically 1541 outpatients presenting with upper and lower respiratory tract infections. The patients included babies, infants and children under 16. In about 50% of all sick babies below the age of three months a definite viral infection could be established, and in approximately 30% of infants and children aged up to 4 years. RSV was most frequently observed, accounting for 53.6% of all infections (80% of all babies below the age of 3 months, in whom specified agents could be identified, had RSV infection). The next most frequent pathogens were parainfluenza type 3 (18,8%), influenza A (11,3%) and, finally, adenoviruses (10.2%). The epidemiological and clinical characteristics of these infections are summarized. In addition, the results of these antigen detecting assays have been compared with those of concomitantly conducted virus isolation techniques in cell cultures. This comparative analysis most impressively revealed the time saved by attempting an etiological diagnosis using the antigen detecting system: in only 6% was a specific diagnosis established on the basis of virus isolation, whereas the delay was equal or more than 8 days in 36% of all patients enroled.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

CD010502,0,1656437,0,Hyaluronic acid capsule is a virulence factor for mucoid group A streptococci.,"Mucoid strains of group A Streptococcus have been associated with recent outbreaks of acute rheumatic fever. The mucoid colony morphology of these strains is a result of abundant production of capsular polysaccharide, which is composed of hyaluronic acid. To study the role of the hyaluronic acid capsule in virulence, we derived an acapsular mutant from a mucoid strain of group A Streptococcus by transposon mutagenesis. M protein expression was not altered in the mutant strain. The mucoid wild-type strain grew in fresh human blood and was resistant to phagocytic killing in vitro. In contrast, the acapsular mutant failed to grow in fresh human blood and was sensitive to phagocytic killing in vitro. Loss of capsule was associated with a 100-fold reduction in virulence of the organisms in mice. We conclude that the hyaluronic acid capsule protects mucoid group A streptococci from phagocytosis and has an important role in virulence."

CD010502,0,10558949,0,Variable susceptibility to opsonophagocytosis of group A streptococcus M-1 strains by human immune sera.,"Immunity to group A streptococci (GAS) is thought to be related to the acquisition of type-specific antibody directed against the M protein. However, recent work suggests that immunity may only be strain and not M-type specific. Therefore, susceptibility of 70 different GAS M-1 strains to opsonization and killing by convalescent sera was compared by using a highly sensitive chemiluminescence assay and by standard bactericidal assay. Sequencing of the emm1 gene in 10 strains with variable susceptibility to opsonization revealed 100% homology in 9 strains. Several substitutions in the N-terminal and 2 in the A3 repeat regions of strain CS-190 were associated with profound resistance to opsonization. Thus amino acid substitutions within different regions of the M-1 protein molecule may adversely affect opsonization by immune sera. In addition, non-M protein factors from identical M types influence susceptibility to phagocytosis. These findings may in part explain the persistently high prevalence of M-1 strains worldwide over the last 15 years."

CD010502,0,1835489,0,Stimulation of human T cells by microbial 'superantigens'.,"The enterotoxins and the TSST of S. aureus, the erythrogenic toxins A and C of S. pyogenes and a still uncharacterized exoprotein of M. arthritidis belong to a family of exotoxins that have in common a potent mitogenic activity for T lymphocytes of several species. These proteins stimulate CD4+ and C8+ T cells, as well as a fraction of gamma delta TCR-bearing T cells by cross-linking variable parts of the T cell antigen receptor with MHC class II molecules on accessory or target cells. They are functionally bivalent molecules having distinct interaction sites for variable parts of the TCR and for nonpolymorphic parts of the MHC class II molecule. For alpha beta TCR-bearing T cells the V beta is the dominant site of interaction with the toxins. However, there is only a preferential but not exclusive stimulation of T cells carrying a certain V beta, because T cell clones carrying e.g. V beta 5 or V beta 8 can respond also to those toxins that do not stimulate V beta 5+ and V beta 8+ T cells in bulk cultures. Therefore, different TCR bind to these toxins with different affinities and the specificity of the TCR-toxin interaction is quantitative rather than qualitative in nature. Murine T cells respond to the mitogen of M. arthritidis that is a natural pathogen for mice and rats much better than to the toxins of the human pathogenic bacteria, whereas the opposite is true for human T cells. This could indicate that the toxins have been adapted to the host's immune system in evolution. The T cell-stimulating activity contributes to the pathogenesis of the respective diseases."

In this investigation, the antibody response of the host was studied for the first time, using SDS-PAGE and Western blot analyses. Paired acute and convalescent sera showed development of antibodies to A. haemolyticum in 7 of 8 patients. The antibodies reacted primarily with four distinct cell wall-associated proteins with estimated molecular masses of 80, 60, 50, and 30 kDa. Moreover, the reactivity of convalescent sera from 19 patients was compared with that of sera from 19 controls.

In children over the age of 2 yr it was found that the maturation of antibody responses to the polysaccharide Ag of S. pyogenes (A-CHO) appeared to occur in parallel with, or even earlier, than the responses to streptococcal protein Ag. When antibodies to group A carbohydrate (A-CHO) were studied in detail, qualitative differences between the antibodies of children and adults were demonstrated. Although anti-A-CHO antibodies of adults were strikingly restricted to the IgG2 subclass, those of children were found in both the IgG1 and IgG2 subclasses. In addition, the clonal diversity of IgG antibodies to A-CHO increased with age, and additional clonotypes were detectable in convalescent sera of some subjects of all ages after infection. Two cases with major additional clonotypes after group A streptococcal infection were studied in detail. In these two cases the additional clonotypes belonged to a different IgG subclass than the previously dominant clonotypes, and the expression of the additional major clonotypes occurred in both IgG1 and IgG2 subclasses."

Concerning its pathogenesis, several investigators suggest that the deposited IgA is an antibody to viral, bacterial, or dietary antigens. Thus the antibody is probably produced as part of the specific host immune response to various environmental antigens. Such reports strengthen the possibility of a relationship between mucosal immunity and the pathogenesis of IgAN. Nevertheless, attempts to isolate a specific IgA-circulating immune complex associated antigen in patients with IgAN have been unsuccessful. We have showed that such mucosal infections as pharyngitis are often associated with the acute onset of IgAN. Then IgAN is an immune complex disease that is caused by a poor mucosal immune response to environmental antigens to which the patient has been chronically exposed. We observed that Haemophilus parainfluenzae (HP) is more commonly isolated from the pharynx of patients with IgAN than from those with other diseases. We have also identified the glomerular deposition of outer membranes of HP antigens (OMHP) and an increased serum concentration of IgA antibodies against OMHP in patients with IgAN. Further studies will be necessary to determine whether the association of OMHP antigens in the glomeruli and IgA antibody against OMHP antigens in the sera of patients with IgAN can be confirmed in other parts of the world and whether this association is important in the pathogenesis of IgAN. Nevertheless, the demonstration of glomerular deposition of OMHP antigens and of IgA antibody against OMHP in sera indicates a potential new avenue of investigation into the elusive cause of IgAN."
CD010502,0,6154921,0,Countercurrent immunoelectrophoresis in the evaluation of infants with group B streptococcal disease.,"Admission specimens of CSF, serum, and urine from 67 patients with proved group B streptococcal (GBS) bacteremia and/or meningitis were evaluated by countercurrent immunoelectrophoresis (CIE). Group B and type-specific antigens were detected in 81% of CSF, 63% of serum, and 96% of concentrated urine specimens by CIE. Each of 26 infants with meningitis from whom all three body fluids were available and ten with bacteremia from whom both serum and urine were collected at admission had GBS antigens detected by CIE in at least one specimen. No false positive reactions were observed. Among patients with type III, GBS meningeal infection, fatal outcome or neurologic sequelae were significantly correlated with concentration of type III antigen in admission CSF and duration of antigenuria when compared to normal survivors (P = less than .05, Mann-Whitney U tests). CIE appears to be a useful diagnostic and prognostic tool for infants with GBS infection if admission specimens from more than one source are examined and appropriately high-titered antisera are employed for testing."

CD010502,0,8176719,0,Immunodominant antigens of Streptococcus equisimilis shared by other beta-haemolytic streptococci.,"Three immunodominant antigens of Streptococcus equisimilis (Lancefield group C) with approximate mol. wts of 46, 66 and 105 kDa were recognised by human serum IgG and IgA immunoblotting. These antigens were identified consistently by various human sera but immunoblots with IgA (heavy chain) and secretory IgA (J chain) from human respiratory secretions gave more variable results. Antigens with similar migration rates were demonstrated in S.pyogenes, large colony human biotype group G streptococci, and streptococci of groups C and G from the ""S. anginosus-milleri group"". Polyclonal antibody which was eluted from immunoblot substrates that contained the S. equisimilis 66-kDa antigen reacted with the 60-kDa antigen of S. pyogenes. Both polyclonal and monoclonal anti-vimentin antibodies identified the 46-kDa and 66-kDa antigens of S. equisimilis. The homology of these antigens among beta-haemolytic streptococci has the potential to complicate both a strategy for the utilisation of immunoblotting for diagnostic purposes and the understanding of how such antigens may be involved in the pathogenesis of post-infectious sequelae."
CD010502,0,16757615,0,Genetically diverse group A streptococci from children in far-western Nepal share high genetic relatedness with isolates from other countries.,"The genetic diversity of group A streptococci (GAS) throughout much of the world has not been adequately explored. To assess genetic variation among GAS in western Nepal, 120 noninvasive GAS, collected from eight different villages, were genetically characterized using emm typing, sof sequencing, and multilocus sequence typing (MLST). A high level of genetic diversity was observed among these isolates, with 51 genotypes based upon 51 multilocus sequence types (STs), 45 emm sequence types, and 28 sof sequence types. On the basis of shared ST-emm and sof-emm associations, 40 of the 51 genotypes were identical or highly related to genotypes characterized from locations outside of Nepal, even though most of the emm sequence and clonal types are rare among GAS within the United States. When analyzing all known STs highly related to Nepal STs, only one example of similar STs shared between a sof PCR-positive strain and a sof PCR-negative strain was observed. Since previous data indicate free exchange of MLST loci between sof-positive and sof-negative strains, there is possibly selection against the expansion of subclones resulting from horizontal transfers of sof or emm genes between sof-positive and sof-negative strains. All 45 emm types encountered in Nepal have also been documented from other countries. These data, together with data encompassing the past decade of emm type surveillance, support the possibility that most existing GAS emm types have been discovered. Similarly, since most (40/51) strain types were highly related to strains found elsewhere, it is likely that a major fraction of the existing GAS clonal complexes have been discovered."
CD010502,0,7798684,0,Selective depletion of V beta-bearing T cells in patients with severe invasive group A streptococcal infections and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. Ontario Streptococcal Study Project.,"The V beta repertoire of T cells of patients with gram-positive group A streptococcal (GAS) and non-GAS infections was analyzed to seek evidence for the role of superantigens in streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. No evidence of V beta overexpression but a consistent pattern of depletion of V beta 1, V beta 5.1, and V beta 12 was observed in patients with severe GAS infections. This pattern of V beta depletion was not observed in patients with nonsevere GAS infections or with severe non-GAS gram-positive infections. T cells from patients with severe GAS infections showed evidence of apoptosis; no apoptosis was found when there was no evidence of V beta depletion. There was no correlation with streptococcal M or T serotype or known spe genes. The depletion of specific V beta-bearing T cells in patients with severe GAS infections supports the role of a superantigen in these infections. The in vivo pattern of V beta specificity implicates a novel superantigen(s) in this disease."

CD010502,0,1578122,0,Prevention of group B streptococcal infection.,"Group B streptococci continue to be major perinatal pathogens, both for mothers and their infants, and are associated with significant morbidity, mortality, and its attendant cost to society. Approaches to prevention are directed toward either eliminating exposure to the organism or enhancing host resistance, that is, chemoprophylaxis and immunoprophylaxis. Intrapartum chemoprophylaxis has been shown to effectively interrupt vertical transmission of group B streptococci from the genitally colonized mother to the infant and to decrease the incidence of both maternal and early-onset neonatal group B streptococcal disease. To avoid unnecessarily exposing large numbers of colonized women to antibiotics, only those with defined risk factors should be selected for intrapartum chemoprophylaxis. This regimen is ampicillin given intravenously, 2 g initially at onset of labor or rupture of membranes, followed by 1 g every 4 hours until delivery. Risk factors include premature onset of labor or rupture of membranes before 37 weeks' gestation, rupture of membranes of more than 12 hours, intrapartum fever, group B streptococcal bacteriuria, or having previously delivered an infant with group B streptococcal disease. Detection of anogenital colonization is accomplished either by culture late in the second or early in the third trimester or by intrapartum group B streptococcal antigen testing of vaginal swabs from those previously culture-negative or not cultured. Although this approach combines the advantages of several proposed strategies, it will still miss those cases of group B streptococcal disease developing in the absence of discernible risk factors. Intrapartum prophylaxis does not prevent late-onset group B streptococcal disease. Prenatal and postnatal chemoprophylaxis have not been shown to be effective. Symptomatic infants born to mothers given chemoprophylaxis should be evaluated for neonatal sepsis and treated accordingly. This approach is also suggested for asymptomatic premature infants, those whose mothers have not received adequate prophylaxis or have previously delivered infants with group B streptococcal disease, and for twin siblings of infants developing group B streptococcal disease. Successful implementation of this approach may be limited by the availability and sensitivity of the rapid antigen test used. Immunoprophylaxis, and active immunization in particular, is the most promising method of preventing perinatal group B streptococcal disease in mothers and their infants, including late-onset disease. Immunization of pregnant women with type III polysaccharide vaccine has resulted in adequate provision of functional antibody to the infants born to responders.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
CD010502,0,17991761,0,Commercial peptidoglycan preparations are contaminated with superantigen-like activity that stimulates IL-17 production.,"The immunomodulatory properties of peptidoglycan (PGN), a constituent of the bacterial cell wall, have been studied extensively but with contrasting results. Recent studies have demonstrated that the TLR2-mediated inflammatory responses elicited by Gram-positive PGN preparations are in fact a result of contaminating lipoproteins and lipoteichoic acid that can be removed only through sophisticated extraction procedures. Here, we report that commercial preparations of Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes PGN are contaminated with bacterial superantigens (SAg). The T cell-derived cytokines IL-17A and IL-17F were induced by PGN preparations but not by TLR agonists or nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain-like receptor agonists in human PBMC. IL-17 induction by PGN preparations was sensitive to protease digestion and required TCR signaling. Bacterial SAg could be detected by immunoblot in the PGN preparations, and purified recombinant SAg were powerful inducers of IL-17. Finally, the PGN preparations stimulated proliferation and expansion of T cells bearing specific TCR V beta elements. Our results suggest that a large body of literature that relied on commercial PGN preparations to study inflammatory diseases, such as arthritis, where IL-17 also plays an important role, should be interpreted with caution and possibly revisited. Future studies aimed at characterizing the activities of PGN should use PGN preparations of proven purity."
CD010502,0,8401425,0,"Multiple binding of type 3 streptococcal M protein to human fibrinogen, albumin and fibronectin.","M proteins are major virulence factors of group A streptococci which enable the bacteria to resist phagocytic attack. Their binding capacity for different plasma proteins seems to be one reason for the antiphagocytic activity of M protein. In the present study we demonstrate that M3 protein, isolated from the streptococcal culture supernatant of strain 4/55, and the recombinant form (rM3), purified from an E. coli lysate after cloning in phage lambda-EMBL3, show a multiple binding to fibrinogen, albumin and fibronectin in Western blot and dot binding assays. Binding of M3 protein to the multifunctional extracellular matrix and plasma protein fibronectin may not only influence phagocytosis but may also contribute to the adherence of these bacteria to endothelial and epithelial cells."

The sensitivities of the methods were respectively 60.8% (TPSA) and 64.4% (DSAE), the specificities 98.3% (TPSA) and 93.2% (DSAE), the positive predictive values 88.6% (TPSA) and 70.3% (DSAE) and the negative predictive values 92.0% (TPSA) and 91.2% (DSAE). We conclude that the TPSA is easy to interpret and is sufficiently specific to initiate treatment in patients with a positive test. It is not sufficiently sensitive to ensure negative or intermediate results. The performance of the DSAE test is similar but the specificity is slightly lower and more false positive results occur."

CD010502,0,12076179,0,Narrow versus broad spectrum antibacterials: factors in the selection of pneumococcal resistance to beta-lactams.,"Streptococus pneumoniae represents an interesting model to discuss the relative impact of broad versus narrow spectrum antibacterials as potential selectors for resistance. Indeed, this pathogen is responsible for potentially severe infections in the community, and has a great capacity for acquisition of resistance to antibacterial agents. It has been the focus of many studies to elucidate some unique aspects of molecular biology, including the adaptive mechanisms responsible for emergence and spread of multiresistance. In the past, the use of narrow spectrum agents was recommended in order to try to reduce the risk of selection of resistance. This concept is nowadays somewhat obsolete for several reasons. S. pneumoniae is able to acquire resistance to antibacterials belonging to different families of drugs through different molecular mechanisms. Thus, selection of multiresistant pneumococci can result from exposure to very different agents, including narrow spectrum as well as broad spectrum agents. In vitro studies have shown a different potential for selection of resistance among the beta-lactam agents. Furthermore, several studies have more or less directly established a close relationship between the level of antibacterial use and the rate of selection of resistance. In addition to the overall amount of antibacterials prescribed in the community, several other factors have been shown to influence the rate of selection of resistance, including the use of doses that are too low, the length of therapy and the duration of bacterial exposure to long-acting agents compared to drugs with short half-lives. Therefore, there are three main ways to control selection and spread of resistant strains: by (i) reducing the amount of antibacterials used; (ii) using optimal dosages (avoiding underdosing) and treatments of short duration; and (iii) reducing the risk of transmission among young children attending daycare centres or kindergartens. In order to help physicians reduce the number of unnecessary prescriptions, it is important to develop rapid tests to recognise the bacterial origin of a febrile illness and even more important to detect resistance to antibacterials. However, apart from rapid diagnostic tests for streptococcal pharyngitis, those tests are not currently available. As a consequence, currently, the debate around narrow versus broad spectrum antibacterials remains a false debate. Physicians should use broad spectrum agents in many instances of upper or lower respiratory tract infection, taking into consideration the probable pathogens and the risk of (multi)resistance to antibacterials. Once rapid diagnostic are available in community practice, allowing a precise diagnosis of the offending agent and its susceptibility profile, physicians will be able to add to their current criteria the selective potential for resistance of the antibacterials that appear to be active in vitro."
CD010502,0,11695754,0,Biochemical and genetic characterization of serologically untypable Streptococcus mutans strains isolated from patients with bacteremia.,"Four out of 522 streptococcal isolates from the peripheral blood of patients with bacteremia exhibited typical properties of Streptococcus mutans in terms of sucrose-dependent adhesion, expression of glucosyltransferases, fermentation profiles of sugars, the presence of surface protein antigen, and DNA-DNA hybridization. Two strains were determined as serotype f and e by immunodiffusion, whereas the other two isolates did not react with the specific antiserum to S. mutans serotype c. e. or f of the eight different serotypes of mutans streptococci. The latter two untypable isolates, however, expressed a new antigenic determinant that was different from serotype c/e/f specificity as revealed by immunodiffusion. Analysis of the cell wall polysaccharides revealed very low contents of glucose in the untypable isolates. Furthermore, Southern blot analysis demonstrated that the untypable strains lacked at least one gene corresponding to a glucose-adding enzyme. These results indicate that the serologically untypable nature is due to the loss of glucosidic residue from the serotype-specific polysaccharide antigens of S. mutans."
CD010502,0,19495818,0,Evaluation of genotypic and phenotypic methods for differentiation of the members of the Anginosus group streptococci.,"The terminology and classification of the Anginosus group streptococci has been inconsistent. We tested the utility of 16S rRNA gene and tuf gene sequencing and conventional biochemical tests for the reliable differentiation of the Anginosus group streptococci. Biochemical testing included Rapid ID 32 Strep, API Strep, Fluo-Card Milleri, Wee-tabs, and Lancefield antigen typing. Altogether, 61 Anginosus group isolates from skin and soft tissue infections and four reference strains were included. Our results showed a good agreement between 16S rRNA gene and tuf gene sequencing. Using the full sequence was less discriminatory than using the first part of the 16S rRNA gene. The three species could not be separated with the API 20 Strep test. Streptococcus intermedius could be differentiated from the other two species by beta-galactosidase (ONPG) and beta-N-acetyl-glucosaminidase reactions. Rapid ID 32 Strep beta-glucosidase reaction was useful in separating S. anginosus strains from S. constellatus. In conclusion, both 16S rRNA gene and tuf gene sequencing can be used for the reliable identification of the Anginosus group streptococci. S. intermedius can be readily differentiated from the other two species by phenotypic tests; however, 16S rRNA gene or tuf gene sequencing may be needed for separating some strains of S. constellatus from S. anginosus."

The disease manifests as polyarthritis, carditis, chorea, erythema marginatum, and/or subcutaneous nodules. Carditis, the most serious complication, occurs in 30% to 45% of RF patients and leads to chronic rheumatic heart disease (RHD), which is characterized by progressive and permanent valvular lesions.

CD010502,0,12952922,0,Group B streptococcal beta-hemolysin/cytolysin activates neutrophil signaling pathways in brain endothelium and contributes to development of meningitis.,"Meningitis occurs when blood-borne pathogens cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in a complex interplay between endothelial cells and microbial gene products. We sought to understand the initial response of the BBB to the human meningeal pathogen group B Streptococcus (GBS) and the organism's major virulence factors, the exopolysaccharide capsule and the beta-hemolysin/cytolysin toxin (beta-h/c). Using oligonucleotide microarrays, we found that GBS infection of human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC) induced a highly specific and coordinate set of genes including IL-8, Groalpha, Grobeta, IL-6, GM-CSF, myeloid cell leukemia sequence-1 (Mcl-1), and ICAM-1, which act to orchestrate neutrophil recruitment, activation, and enhanced survival. Most strikingly, infection with a GBS strain lacking beta-h/c resulted in a marked reduction in expression of genes involved in the immune response, while the unencapsulated strain generally induced similar or greater expression levels for the same subset of genes. Cell-free bacterial supernatants containing beta-h/c activity induced IL-8 release, identifying this toxin as a principal provocative factor for BBB activation. These findings were further substantiated in vitro and in vivo. Neutrophil migration across polar HBMEC monolayers was stimulated by GBS and its beta-h/c through a process involving IL-8 and ICAM-1. In a murine model of hematogenous meningitis, mice infected with beta-h/c mutants exhibited lower mortality and decreased brain bacterial counts compared with mice infected with the corresponding WT GBS strains."
CD010502,0,19520603,0,Identification of active variants of PARF in human pathogenic group C and group G streptococci leads to an amended description of its consensus motif.,"Certain streptococcal M proteins bind collagen via an octapeptide motif that is located in their hypervariable N-terminal region. The interaction with this extracellular matrix protein enhances adhesion to the host tissue and thereby facilitates infection. Moreover, it has the side effect of eliciting collagen autoimmune responses, a phenomenon which is also observed in patients with acute rheumatic fever. Therefore, the octapeptide motif was named peptide associated with rheumatic fever (PARF). Only a comprehensive characterization of the collagen-binding M proteins and their collagen-binding motifs will allow the investigation of their associations with certain streptococcal infections and their sequelae. Therefore, a collection of Streptococcus dysgalactiae equisimilis strains that were isolated from infected humans was examined, in order to identify collagen-binding proteins and motifs. Strains that bound collagen independent of a hyaluronic acid capsule belonged to 7 distinct types of the emm gene, which codes for the M protein (emm types). Only one of these emm types was previously described as collagen-binding. Five possessed a PARF sequence. The other 2 emm types stC2sk.0 and stG2574 had PARF-like motifs that diverged from the previously described consensus sequence AXYLZZLN but were able to induce collagen autoimmunity when injected into mice. The results led to the amended PARF consensus (A/E/T)XYLXXLN. Moreover, they demonstrate a predictive power regarding collagen-binding and elicitation of collagen autoimmunity, indicating that PARF may be one of the markers for strains that cause collagen-dependent acute rheumatic fever."
CD010502,0,1754316,0,[Etiology of a nephrotic form of primary chronic glomerulonephritis in children].,"As many as 91 children with the nephrotic and hematuric forms of primary chronic glomerulonephritis were examined for the presence of streptococcal infection and allergic diseases. It has been shown that as compared to patients with the hematuric form of chronic glomerulonephritis, those with the nephrotic form manifest a higher occurrence of A3, a dramatic rise of serum IgE and its dependence on the activity of glomerulonephritis. The data obtained may attest to the etiological role played by allergy in the development of the nephrotic form of glomerulonephritis. Frequently occurring colonization of hemolytic streptococcus in the fauces and the rise of the ASL-O titer in the blood serum seen in patients with the hematuric form of glomerulonephritis, its dependence on the disease activity suggest the streptococcal etiology in patients with that form in contrast to those with the nephrotic form."
CD010502,0,18813950,0,Age-associated differences in prevalence of group A streptococcal type-specific M antibodies in children.,"Our prior studies of the molecular epidemiology of group A streptococcus (GAS) pharyngitis indicated that the most common emm types associated with pediatric pharyngitis in North America were 12, 1, 28, and 4. We previously reported that the proportions of pediatric pharyngitis due to emm types 12 and 4 decreased with increasing age throughout childhood. We hypothesized that this is due to age-associated acquisition of antibodies to the amino-terminal type-specific region of common GAS M proteins during childhood. We sought to demonstrate this in sera from healthy children by using ELISAs for M 12, 1, 28, and 4. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) using chemically synthesized peptides copying amino-terminal type-specific regions of the M proteins were performed on sera from four age groups of healthy children (group I: 3-6 years, group II: 7-10 years, group III: 11-14 years, group IV: 15-18 years). ELISA data were correlated with opsonophagocytic assays for a subset of sera and M 1 GAS. Sera from healthy 12-20-month-old children were used as negative controls. Our results showed that the highest percentage of positivity was for M12, which also showed progressive seropositivity in older children. For the other serotypes, the highest seroprevalence rates were in the 11-14-year-old age group. The presence of ELISA antibodies against M1 correlated with opsonophagocytic activity, a previously studied indicator of immunologic protection."

GBS cultures from the lower genital tract were obtained in a prospective fashion using a dual swab transport system from patients with risk factors for perinatal GBS infection. One swab was used to inoculate a trypticase soy agar plate with 5% sheep blood (TSA) and then placed in Lim broth. The other swab was used to perform the Strep B OIA. Growth of GBS by either direct plating or broth-enhanced culture was used as the gold standard for determining GBS colonization. Of the 524 women in the study, 90 women had positive cultures (either TSA or Lim broth). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the Strep B OIA were 47% (42/90), 96% (416/434), 70% (42/60), 90% (416/464). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the TSA were 61% (55/90), 100% (434/434), 100% (55/55), 93% (434/469). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of Lim broth were 97% (87/90), 100% (434/434), 100% (87/87), and 97% (434/437). The sensitivity of the Strep B OIA to detect light GBS colonization and heavy GBS colonization, as determined by the TSA, was 53% (19/36) and 90% (17/19), respectively. The Strep B OIA and direct agar plate culture appear to be of limited clinical value due to their poor sensitivities. This study also demonstrates the need to use a selective medium such as Lim broth when assessing for GBS colonization of the lower genital tract."
CD010502,0,2945929,0,Monoclonal opsonic mouse antibodies specific for streptococcal IgG Fc-receptor.,Spleen cells from mice immunised with group-A type-M15 streptococci and boosted with purified IgG Fc-receptor (FcR) from this type were fused with Sp 2/0 mouse myeloma cells. The resulting hybridomas were screened by ELISA for antibody production. Two IgM-secreting cell lines were selected. The monoclonal antibodies and ascites fluids inhibited the binding of 125I-labelled human IgG and IgG Fc-fragments to group-A type-M15 streptococci. The monoclonal antibodies also displaced purified FcR towards the anode in electrophoresis. They opsonised group-A type M-15 streptococci for phagocytosis by human granulocytes in the presence of fresh human serum. It was concluded that FcR is important for group-A streptococcal virulence.
CD010502,0,22512736,0,Cellular aspects of the distinct M protein and SfbI anchoring pathways in Streptococcus pyogenes.,"Wall-anchored surface proteins are critical for the in vivo survival of Streptococcus pyogenes. Cues in the signal sequence direct the membrane translocation of surface proteins: M protein to the septum, and SfbI to the poles. Both proteins are subsequently anchored to the wall by the membrane bound enzyme sortase A. However, the cellular features of these pathways are not fully understood. Here we show that M protein and SfbI are anchored simultaneously throughout the cell cycle. M protein is rapidly anchored at the septum, and in part of the cell cycle, is anchored simultaneously at the mother and daughter septa. Conversely, SfbI accumulates gradually on peripheral peptidoglycan, resulting in a polar distribution. Sortase is not required for translocation of M protein or SfbI at their respective locations. Methicillin-induced unbalanced peptidoglycan synthesis diminishes surface M protein but not SfbI. Furthermore, overexpression of the division regulator DivIVA also diminishes surface M protein but increases SfbI. These results demonstrate a close connection between the regulation of cell division and protein anchoring. Better understanding of the spatial regulation of surface anchoring may lead to the identification of novel targets for the development of anti-infective agents, given the importance of surface molecules for pathogenesis."

Although there is no international consensus on the use of RADTs, these kits have been widely adopted in Finland, France and the USA. Yet in the UK, the Clinical Knowledge Summaries, that provide the main online guidance for GPs, discourage RADTs use, citing their poor sensitivity and inability to impact on prescribing decisions in acute sore throat infections."

CD010502,0,12207341,0,Differential presentation of group A streptococcal superantigens by HLA class II DQ and DR alleles.,"Superantigens have been implicated as pivotal mediators of severe invasive group A streptococcal (GAS) infections, by virtue of their potent immunostimulatory activity. HLA polymorphism has been suggested to influence the susceptibility to severe invasive GAS infection. Here we studied the influence of allelic and isotypic variation of HLA class II molecules on GAS superantigen-induced immune responses using cells derived from patients with bare lymphocyte syndrome, untransfected or transfected with various HLA class II alleles. Significantly higher proliferative responses were detected when streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin (Spe) A was presented by cells expressing DQA1*0101/DQB1*0302 (DQ3.2), as compared to cells expressing DR1, DR4, or DR5 alleles (p=0.0002-0.01). In contrast to SpeA, SpeC was preferentially presented by DR4 as compared to DQB1*03 (p=0.04). In agreement with the proliferation results, a significantly higher frequency of IL-2-, TNF-alpha-, TNF-beta-, and IFN-gamma-producing cells was detected when SpeA was presented by HLA class II DQB1*03 alleles as compared to DR4 (p=0.0002-0.04). Binding experiments showed a high affinitybinding of SpeA to both class II DR4 and DQB1*0302, and there was no significant difference in SpeA binding affinity between the two alleles. The data confirm the effect of allelic polymorphism in superantigen responses and show that different superantigens are preferentially presented by distinct class II alleles."
CD010502,0,10970389,0,Multilaboratory validation of rapid spot tests for identification of Escherichia coli.,"To validate the accuracy of rapid tests for identification of Escherichia coli, five laboratories sequentially collected 1,064 fresh, clinically significant strains with core criteria of indole-positive, oxidase-negative, nonspreading organisms on sheep blood agar plates (BAP), having typical gram-negative rod plate morphology, defined as good growth on gram-negative rod-selective media. An algorithm using beta-hemolysis on BAP, lactose reaction on eosin-methylene blue or MacConkey agar, L-pyrrolidonyl-beta-naphthylamide (PYR), and 4-methylumbelliferyl-beta-D-glucuronide (MUG) was evaluated. Identifications using the algorithm were compared to those obtained using commercial kit system identifications. One thousand strains were E. coli and 64 were not E. coli by kit identifications, which were supplemented with conventional biochemical testing of low probability profiles. Of the 1,064 isolates meeting the core criteria, 294 were beta-hemolytic and did not require further testing to be identified as E. coli. None of the 64 non-E. coli strains were hemolytic, although other indole-positive, lactose-negative species were found to be hemolytic when further strains were examined in a follow-up study. Of the remaining strains, 628 were identified as E. coli by a lactose-positive and PYR-negative reaction. For nonhemolytic, lactose-negative E. coli, PYR was not helpful, but a positive MUG reaction identified 65 of 78 isolates as E. coli. The remaining 13 E. coli strains required kit identifications. This scheme for E. coli identification misidentified three non-E. coli strains as E. coli, for an error rate of 0.3%. A total of 13 kit identifications, 657 PYR tests, and 113 MUG tests were needed to identify 1,000 E. coli strains with the algorithm. The use of this rapid system saves laboratory resources, provides timely identifications, and yields rare misidentifications."

CD010502,0,3313256,0,Streptococcal perianal disease in children.,"From October 1985 through June 1986, 31 children in a single pediatric practice were treated for perianal signs and symptoms associated with growth of group A beta-hemolytic streptococci from perianal cultures. Signs and symptoms included perianal dermatitis (90%), perianal itching (78%), rectal pain (52%), and blood-streaked stools (35%). Ages ranged from 7 months to 8 years mean 4.25 +/- 1.8 years). There were 24 boys (77%) and seven girls (23%). The 31 cases occurred in 19 families. Intrafamily spread was only to siblings and occurred in 50% of the possible situations. Direct perianal antigen studies had a sensitivity of 89% for predicting positive cultures. Four different T types of group A streptococci were isolated from these cases, but the T type within each family outbreak was identical except in one case. When group A streptococci were found in the pharynx (64% of patients), the T type of the pharyngeal and perianal isolates were identical. Treatment was usually with oral penicillin. Relapses occurred in 39%. Signs of cellulitis were absent in all 31 cases and, therefore, we suggest that the nomenclature for this entity be changed from streptococcal perianal cellulitis to streptococcal perianal disease."

CD010502,0,8083381,0,M protein and protein F act as important determinants of cell-specific tropism of Streptococcus pyogenes in skin tissue.,"The pathogenic gram-positive bacterium Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococcus) causes numerous diseases of cutaneous tissue, each of which is initiated after the interaction of the bacterium with the cells of the epidermis. In this study, we show that different surface proteins of S. pyogenes play important roles in determining the cell-specific tropism of the bacterium in skin. Using streptococcal strains with defined mutations in the genes which encode surface proteins in combination with primary cultures of human skin and an in situ adherence assay which uses histological sections of human skin, we show that the M protein of S. pyogenes mediates the binding of the bacterium to keratinocytes, while a second streptococcal surface protein, protein F, directs the adherence of the organism to Langerhans' cells. Characterization of binding revealed that adherence was inhibited by purified streptococcal proteins and pretreatment of both host cells with the protease trypsin. Adherence was only slightly affected by the state of keratinocyte differentiation in vitro, but was considerably modulated in response to environmental conditions known to regulate expression of M protein and protein F, suggesting that the interaction between these bacterial cell-surface structures/adhesins and keratinocytes and Langerhans' cells may play an important role in streptococcal skin disease."

CD010502,0,6155342,0,Heterogeneity of group A type-specific antibodies.,Extracting type 6 group A streptococcai with dilute nitrous acid releases an antigen that exhibits type-specific precipitating properties with anti-M6 serum but fails to neutralize the type-specific bactericidal reaction or to absorb the bactericidal antibody from anti-M6 serum. These studies suggest that the precipitating and antiphagocytic properties of the M protein are attributable to different antigenic determinants. The antigenic determinant responsible for bactericidal antibody is more sensitive to the deleterious effect of nitrous acid than is the moiety responsible for the precipitin reaction. Use of the indirect fluorescent technique with anti-M sera absorbed with lyophilized nitrous acid extracts permits the possible differentiation of the two M-protein determinants in situ on the surface of streptococcal cells.

CD010502,0,1308988,0,Isolation and characterization of a novel streptococcal superantigen.,"The involvement of S. pyogenes (group A Streptococcus) in severe invasive disease, toxic-shock-like syndrome, and episodes of rheumatic fever led us to explore the possibility that these strains produce a novel superantigen. By using a superantigen-specific assay, we purified a 28-kDa protein from culture supernatants that stimulated T cells in an MHC class II-dependent, V beta-specific manner and designated it SSA, streptococcal superantigen. The amino terminus of SSA showed striking resemblance to SEB, SEC1, and SEC3. The structural homology exhibited by SSA to SEB was reflected functionally in that both of these superantigens bound the same class II isotypes. In contrast, SSA differed from SEB and other known bacterial superantigens with respect to its pattern of V beta-specific T-cell activation. SSA stimulated human T cells that expressed V beta 1, 3, 15, and perhaps V beta 5.2. Using SSA-specific antibodies in an immunoblot assay, we screened 26 strains of Lancefield group A Streptococcus and 16 strains of group B, C, and G Streptococcus. We found that SSA was expressed with high frequency in group A strains, but was absent from all other groups tested. These data establish SSA as a novel superantigen secreted by S. pyogenes. Further study of the structure and expression of SSA may reveal a role for this molecule in current episodes of severe streptococcal diseases."

By applying existing knowledge to 1,000 theoretical patients, this study compares the diagnostic accuracy, costs, and benefits of ""gold standard"" throat cultures, less specific office cultures, and rapid streptococcal tests. With the new rapid tests, appropriate treatment for streptococcal pharyngitis can be started promptly without waiting for a culture result. Benefit-cost analysis of existing data shows that rapid tests have the potential to be more efficient than throat cultures in minimizing medical costs and time lost because of illness. These conclusions remained true over widely ranging assumptions about streptococcal prevalence, carrier rate, rheumatic fever attack rate, test cost, and test accuracy."
CD010502,0,21843871,0,The Hypervariable region of Streptococcus pyogenes M protein escapes antibody attack by antigenic variation and weak immunogenicity.,"Sequence variation of antigenic proteins allows pathogens to evade antibody attack. The variable protein commonly includes a hypervariable region (HVR), which represents a key target for antibodies and is therefore predicted to be immunodominant. To understand the mechanism(s) of antibody evasion, we analyzed the clinically important HVR-containing M proteins of the human pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes. Antibodies elicited by M proteins were directed almost exclusively against the C-terminal part and not against the N-terminal HVR. Similar results were obtained for mice and humans with invasive S. pyogenes infection. Nevertheless, only anti-HVR antibodies protected efficiently against infection, as shown by passive immunizations. The HVR fused to an unrelated protein elicited no antibodies, implying that it is inherently weakly immunogenic. These data indicate that the M protein HVR evades antibody attack not only through antigenic variation but also by weak immunogenicity, a paradoxical observation that may apply to other HVR-containing proteins."
CD010502,0,7876606,0,Group A streptococcus-liposome ELISA antibody titers to group A polysaccharide and opsonophagocytic capabilities of the antibodies.,"Antibodies reactive with group A streptococci (GAS) carbohydrate were studied by ELISA and in an indirect bactericidal assay. The ELISA used GAS carbohydrate covalently bound to phosphatidylethanolamine incorporated into liposomes so that both precipitating and nonprecipitating antibodies were measured. Sera from children from different geographic areas exhibited marked differences in levels of anti-GAS carbohydrate antibody, which increased with age. The antibodies were predominantly of IgG. In bactericidal assays, most of these sera promoted phagocytosis of several type-specific M-positive strains. Opsonization was also related to serum levels of anti-GAS carbohydrate antibodies. These opsonizing antibodies were depleted from the serum by absorption of the sera on an N-acetyl-D-glucosamine affinity column. Antibody eluted from this column could partially restore opsonization of GAS. Anti-GAS carbohydrate antibodies play a major role in these opsonophagocytosis assays."
CD010502,0,20107992,0,Characterization of Streptococcus pyogenes isolated from balanoposthitis patients presumably transmitted by penile-oral sexual intercourse.,"Streptococcus pyogenes is indigenous to the human pharynx and causes acute pharyngitis. Balanoposthitis is an inflammatory disease of the glans and the foreskin. However, balanoposthitis caused by S. pyogenes is not widely recognized as a sexually transmitted disease. In addition, bacteriological features of the isolates causing balanoposthitis are unclear. The four S. pyogenes strains isolated from adult balanoposthitis were examined. We performed emm typing, T antigen typing, RAPD assay, PCR assay for the streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin-related genes and antibiotic-resistant genes, and antibiotic susceptibility assay. All four strains were suspected to be transmitted by penile-oral sexual intercourse, were found to be different by genetic analysis, and also harbored some antibiotic-resistant factors. We propose that S. pyogenes should be considered as a causative agent of sexually transmitted disease. The drug resistant S. pyogenes must be taken into account when balanoposthitis patients are treated with antibiotic."

CD010502,0,3535794,0,Sequence homology of group A streptococcal Pep M5 protein with other coiled-coil proteins.,"Group A streptococcal Pep M5 protein, an antiphagocytic determinant of the bacteria, is an alpha-helical coiled-coil molecule, and exhibits significant sequence homology with tropomyosin and myosin, but to a lesser degree with other coiled-coil proteins. Moreover, Pep M5 is more homologous to myosin than to tropomyosin, and the homologies are more numerous between the C-terminal domain of the Pep M5 protein and the S2 fragment of myosin. The C-terminal domain of the Pep M5 protein exhibits extensive sequence identity with the C-terminal region of Pep M6 molecule, another M protein serotype. Thus, regions within two M protein serotypes are homologous to the S2 region of the myosin molecule. These observations are consistent with the immunological findings of other investigators and thus may explain some of the previously reported immunological cross-reactions between antigens of the group A streptococcus and mammalian heart tissue."

This substance had a molecular weight of 28,000 and pI 9.2, and was designated as S. pyogenes mitogen (SPM). The proliferative response of C3H/HeN spleen cells began at 1 ng ml-1 and reached a maximal response at 100 ng ml-1 of SPM for 4 days culture. Anti-Thy 1.2 mAb and complement-treated spleen cells abrogated the proliferative response to any dose of SPM. Although the anti-major histocompatibility complex class 1 mAbs had no blocking effect on proliferation by SPM, this proliferation was substantially inhibited by the addition of either anti-I-A or anti-I-E mAb, and complete inhibition was produced by the addition of both mAbs. Fixed antigen-presenting cells still induced T cell proliferation by SPM. A significant expansion of T cells bearing V beta 13 T-cell receptor was observed up to 73% among the Thy 1.2+ cells in cultures stimulated with SPM, indicating expansion in a V beta-specific manner. Immunoblotting of IEF-separated proteins showed that anti-streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin (SPE) C reacted with a protein of pI 6.9 and anti-SPEB did not show any reactivity. SPEA was reported to expand V beta 8.1 and 8.2 bearing murine T cells, and SPM did not. SPM also exhibited potent mitogenic activity on human T cells and V beta 21+ T cells were selectively expanded. These results lead to the conclusion that SPM was neither SPEA, B nor C, but a new protein belonging to a group of streptococcal superantigens with activity on not only human but also murine lymphocytes."

The purpose of this study was to determine the colonization rate with GBS and the antibiotic susceptibility profile in pregnant women attending Gynecological clinics in Egypt. One-hundred and fifty vaginal swabs were collected from pregnant women at 35-40 weeks of gestation. In comparison to culture, direct latex agglutination testing revealed 100% sensitivity and 93.75% specificity. Thirty-eight specimens (25.3%) were found to be positive for GBS. Each isolate was tested for susceptibility to penicillin G, ampicillin, cefotaxime, erythromycin, clindamycin and vancomycin. Erythromycin-resistant isolates were further classified by double-disk method. All isolates were susceptible to penicillin G, ampicillin and vancomycin. Resistance to cefotaxime was detected in three isolates (7.89%). Five isolates (13.15%) were resistant to erythromycin and nine isolates (23.68%) were resistant to clindamycin. Four (80%) isolates had constitutive macrolide-lincosamide-Streptogramin(B) resistance (cMLSB(B)) resistance and one (20%) isolate had inducible resistance (iMLS(B)) resistance. GBS colonization was found to be high in our region.

CD010502,0,9020931,0,Is psoriasis induced by streptococcal superantigens and maintained by M-protein-specific T cells that cross-react with keratin?,"The evidence that T lymphocytes play a key role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis is now compelling. Eruption of psoriatic skin lesions coincides with epidermal infiltration and activation of T cells, and spontaneous or treatment-induced resolution of the lesions is preceded by the reduction or disappearance of epidermal T cells. An upregulation has also been demonstrated for various molecules associated with T-cell mediated inflammation, and treatments selectively directed against T cells have proved very effective. Infections with group A beta-haemolytic streptococci have been associated with onset of acute psoriasis and exacerbation of chronic psoriasis. Such infections are also frequently accompanied by erythematous skin rashes. Also, recent reports indicate that streptococcal superantigens can induce expression of cutaneous lymphocyte antigens (CLA), believed to play a major role in enabling T cells to migrate to the skin. Furthermore, T-cell lines isolated from psoriatic lesions may show strong reactivity to streptococcal antigens. We have postulated that psoriasis is an autoimmune disease mediated by T cells reacting to epitopes that are common to streptococcal M-proteins and keratins. To investigate this possibility, circulating T cells from 12 patients with active psoriasis, paired controls, and six patients with atopic dermatitis were challenged in vitro with five synthetic 20aa (amino acid) M-peptides: production of IFN-gamma and IL-4 was analysed by ELISPOT and RT-PCR techniques. Four of these peptides shared five to six aa sequences with several type I keratins and one did not. In 10 of the 12 psoriasis patients, measurable IFN-gamma production could be induced by one or more of the four peptides that share sequences with keratins. A borderline response was observed in only four of the 18 controls: the dermatitis patients were all negative. The only peptide that shared 6aa with keratins was the one that induced a response in the psoriatic patients most frequently, and four of them showed the strongest response to this peptide while none of the controls reacted to it. In all instances negligible responses were observed to the control peptide that did not share sequences with keratins. Except for PHA-stimulated controls, IL-4 responses could not be detected by either ELISPOT or RT-PCR and there was generally good agreement between the two techniques. A marked reduction in the M-peptide-induced IFN-gamma responses was observed in the psoriasis patients during remission induced by UVB treatment, while their responses to streptokinase-streptodornase were not affected. Thus, active psoriasis is associated with a Th1 type response to short peptides with epitopes shared by streptococcal M-protein and keratin. This is consistent with the hypothesis that psoriasis may be induced and exacerbated in susceptible individuals by M-protein-specific Th1-like cells that cross-react with human epidermal keratin."
CD010502,0,12537174,0,An office-based approach to influenza: clinical diagnosis and laboratory testing.,"Vaccination is the primary measure for preventing morbidity and mortality from influenza. During the influenza season, family physicians must distinguish influenza from the common cold and other flu-like illnesses. Signs and symptoms of influenza include abrupt onset of fever, severe myalgias, anorexia, sore throat, headache, cough, and malaise. Clinical diagnosis can be difficult or nonspecific when patients have other symptoms (e.g., stuffy nose, sneezing, cough, sore throat) that can be caused by various respiratory viruses or bacterial pathogens. Family physicians can improve diagnostic accuracy by being aware of the epidemiology of influenza. During outbreaks of influenza, commercially available rapid assays can be used to identify type A and B viruses. On average, rapid in-office tests are more than 70 percent sensitive and 90 percent specific for viral antigens. The assays vary in complexity, specificity, sensitivity, time to obtain results, specimen analyzed, and cost. The results of rapid viral tests can guide treatment decisions."

Twenty-six percent of patients with negative latex agglutination test results had growth on culture of a paired specimen. Under the best assumption rapid test sensitivity was 44.9%. The treatment rate (84%) for cases detected by the rapid test was markedly higher than the rate (44%) for cases detected only by culture (P less than 0.001), presumably because the rapid test result is available sooner. We conclude that: the rapid test had a lower sensitivity in routine use in our pediatric emergency department population than in previous reports from research settings; and using the rapid test in addition to culture can significantly increase treatment rates."

However, rapid methods for detecting colonized women must be developed to limit the administration of antibiotics to those who are at risk of delivering an infected infant. The accuracy of a colorimetric test using starch serum medium on vaginal and rectal specimens from women with preterm labor or prolonged rupture of membranes was evaluated. The test was interpreted by labor and delivery room nurses without special microbiologic training. Starch serum medium results were compared with those obtained from routine cultures. Thirteen of 29 positive vaginal cultures (45%) and eight of 18 positive rectal swabs (44%) were identified by nurses using the rapid method. This was significantly different (P less than .001) from sensitivities of 93 and 95%, respectively, for the same vaginal and rectal specimens interpreted by a bacteriology technologist. The specificity for the test from both sites was 95% for the nurses. The sensitivity was 53 and 36% for vaginal and rectal swabs, respectively, for a subgroup of mothers whose infants were assessed as clinically septic. The low sensitivity of starch serum medium as interpreted by nurses in the labor suite is inadequate to allow the test to replace cultures in identifying women colonized with group B streptococci. Efforts to increase the sensitivity should be directed toward improving nursing staff interpretation rather than improving the medium itself."

Influence of immunization with erythrogenic toxin type A (ET A) and its toxoid on subsequent infection with an ET A producing strain.,"Purified erythrogenic toxin type A (ET A) and the corresponding toxoid, prepared by formalin treatment, were used for the immunization of rabbits (200 micrograms per rabbit). The impact of anti-erythrogenic toxin and toxoid immunity was investigated under the conditions of experimental infection with the ET A-producing Streptococcus pyogenes strain SF 130 (type 1). Whereas non of the immunized rabbits (n = 14) died after infection, 40% of nonimmunized animals did not survive (Table 1). The increase of the spleen weight after infection was significantly smaller in the immunized groups (Table 2). The immunized rabbits responded after infection with a significantly lower increase of fever which did not exceed 0.8 degree C (2 degrees C in infected non-immunized animals). Humoral antibodies to ET A were detected after immunization by means of ELISA. The challenge infection acted as a booster leading to a further increase of antibodies. The antibodies were found to be neutralizing the nonspecific mitogenicity of ET A in vitro in relation to the antibody titer. Cell-mediated immunity was tested in the lymphocyte transformation reaction with peripheral lymphocytes. The nonspecific mitogenicity of ET A, ET B, ET C and Con A was pronounced after immunization, whereas the nonimmunized rabbits responded to these antigens to a lower degree. The toxoid was found to be nonmitogenic. The altogether higher lymphocyte stimulation was also observed using spleen lymphocytes of immunized animals after infection."

Younger, healthy patients after minor local trauma are most commonly afflicted. The infection is characterized by a rapid course with shock, sepsis, multiorgan failure, soft-tissue infection and a high mortality rate. This special disease has been termed ""streptococcal toxic shock-like syndrome"". The M-proteins, especially types 1 and 3, and the streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin A (speA) might play an important role in the pathogenesis of the infection. High dose therapy with antibiotics, monitoring in the intensive care unit and early, aggressive and often multiple debridement of necrotic soft tissue are necessary to save the patient's life."

Applying a genomic approach that relies on human antibodies we identified antigenic GBS proteins, among them most of the previously published protective antigens. In vitro analyses allowed the selection of conserved candidate antigens that were further evaluated in murine lethal sepsis models using several GBS strains. In active and passive immunization models, we identified four protective GBS antigens, FbsA and BibA, as well as two hypothetical proteins, all shown to contribute to virulence based on gene deletion mutants. These protective antigens have the potential to be components of novel vaccines or targets for passive immune prophylaxis against GBS disease."
CD010502,0,2660147,0,Fc-receptor and M-protein genes of group A streptococci are products of gene duplication.,"The partial nucleotide sequence for an Fc-receptor gene from an M-type 76 group A streptococcus was determined. DNA sequence analysis revealed considerable sequence similarity between the Fc-receptor and M-protein genes in their proposed promoter regions, signal sequences, and 3' termini. Additional analysis indicated that the deduced Fc-receptor protein contains a proline-rich region and membrane anchor region highly similar to that of M protein. In view of these results, we postulated that Fc-receptor and M-protein genes of group A streptococci are the products of gene duplication from a common ancestral gene. It is proposed that DNA sequence similarity between these two genes may allow for extragenic homologous recombination as a means of generating antigenic diversity in these two surface proteins."

One hundred and fourteen children (11.3%) had both a positive antigen and culture test, while 216 (21.6%) had antigen-positive tests only and 16 (1.5%) had a positive culture only. Thus, the combination of culture and antigen detection revealed a carrier rate of 35.4% in the children examined.

CD010502,0,7047404,0,The adherence of group A streptococci to oropharyngeal cells: the lipoteichoic acid adhesin and fibronectin receptor.,"The attachment of group A streptococci to oropharyngeal epithelial cells is mediated by adhesive molecules (adhesins) on the surfaces of the micro-organisms that interact with receptor molecules on the epithelial cells. The evidence that the adhesin is composed of lipoteichoic acid (LTA) complexed with bacterial cell surface proteins is as follows: (a) Among the purified cell wall substances tested, only LTA was able to inhibit attachment; (b) treatment of streptococci with anti LTA but not with antibody against other surface substances blocks attachment; (c) LTa forms complexes with purified M protein, the most abundant protein on the surface of virulent streptococci; (d) the lipid moieties of LTA, which mediate attachment, remain free in the M protein-LTA complexes to interact with receptor analogues, such as serum albumin. The evidence that the receptor for the LTA mediated binding of streptococci resides in fibronectin molecules on oropharyngeal cells is as follows: (a) the addition ot adhesion test mixtures of fibronection inhibits binding; (b) the number of streptococci capable of attaching is directly proportional to the amount of fibronectin present on epithelial cells; (c) purified fibronectin immobilized on latex beads agglutinates suspensions of streptococci; (d) radiolabeled fibronectin binds to group A streptococci; (e) both the agglutination of fibronectin-beads and the binding of fibronectin to streptococci is blocked by LTA, the streptococcal adhesin."

We recently compared the Culturette Brand Ten-Minute Group A Strep ID Kit with blood agar cultures in 313 patients with pharyngitis, 257 (82%) of whom had positive throat cultures for GABHS. The Culturette Brand test had a sensitivity of 88%, specificity of 96%, a positive predictive value of 99%, and negative predictive value of 64%. More than half of the false-negative Culturette Brand test results occurred in children with less than 10 GABHS colonies on throat culture (1+ culture). When these 1+ cultures were not considered positive, the sensitivity of the Culturette Brand test was 93%. The sensitivity of the Culturette Brand test increased with an increased degree of positivity of the corresponding throat culture. Of the 31 children with false-negative Culturette Brand test results, 14 (45%) had a significant streptococcal antibody response; of the 224 children with true-positive Culturette Brand test results (positive test results and positive culture) from whom serologic data were available, 114 (51%) had a significant streptococcal antibody response. This difference is not statistically significant. These findings suggest that almost half of patients with false-negative results on antigen detection tests for GABHS pharyngitis have true infections (positive culture and antibody rise) and are not merely streptococcal carriers."

In this study we show that SodA is found both in surface protein extracts and in culture supernatants of GAS. To investigate whether SodA is a possible vaccine candidate outbred Quackenbush mice were subcutaneously vaccinated with recombinant SodA. Strong antibody responses which were moderately opsonic were elicited. These antibodies were unable to protect mice from intraperitoneal challenge with M1 GAS. We also show that SodA and p145 (a conserved peptide from the M-protein) antibodies are present at significantly higher levels amongst patients with rheumatic heart disease than in control subjects from the same endemic region. The higher SodA antibody levels in patients may be indicative of a role for this protein in pathogenesis of rheumatic heart disease but are more likely to be a marker of recent or recurrent streptococcal infection.

In the present study, 241 GBS isolates from Zimbabwe, comprising 124 carrier isolates from pregnant women and 117 isolates from patients hospitalised for various diseases, were serotyped. Antibodies specific for the capsular polysaccharide antigens (CPAs) Ia, Ib and II-V and antibodies specific for the surface-localised proteins, c(alpha), c(beta), R1, R3 and R4 were used for serotyping. Strains of the CPA types Ia (17%), III (47.7%) and V (23.2%) predominated. Of the various protein antigens, c(alpha) and R4 were expressed with highest frequency, c(alpha) by 100% of the CPA type Ia strains and R4 by 92% of the CPA type III strains. The R3 protein occurred frequently (24%), especially in type V strains (84%). A total of 25 serovariants was detected in the strain collection with the variants Ia/c(alpha) (16%), III/R4 (43.5%) and V/c(alpha), R3 (14.1%) occurring with the highest frequency. Serotype and subtype distribution of the carrier isolates were essentially similar to those of the disease-associated isolates. Genomic heterogeneity was demonstrated by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of type III/R4 and type V/c(alpha), R3 isolates, but to a much lesser extent than recorded with Norwegian strains. These results demonstrate that many variants of GBS occur in the Zimbabwean population. The data obtained may assist in the formulation of a possible future GBS vaccine for Zimbabwe and perhaps for other African countries."

Strains of only some M types are known to be associated with PSGN. A secretory protein called SIC inhibits complement function. Whereas all M1 and M57 strains express closely related SIC (CRS), all M12 and M55 strains express distantly related SIC (DRS) proteins. Strains belonging to these four M types are historically associated with PSGN. This study used ELISA to analyse 112 sera from individuals with a recorded history of PSGN and 86 sera from individuals who had no such recorded history, all from a PSGN endemic region in tropical Australia. Antibody reactions to CRS, DRS and peptides corresponding to the N-termini of M1, M5, M12, M49, M55 and M57 antigens were assessed. A large proportion of the population showed reactions to each of these antigens and there was no correlation between CRS seropositivity and antibodies to CRS-positive M types. Likewise there was no correlation between DRS seropositivity and antibodies to DRS-positive M types. Interestingly, in this community endemic for PSGN a significantly higher proportion of DRS seropositive subjects had a recorded history of PSGN than did DRS seronegative subjects. DRS may have a predictive value for PSGN diagnosis or a role in PSGN pathogenesis."

CD010502,0,21597903,0,Cutting edge issues in rheumatic fever.,"Although the incidence of acute rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease has decreased significantly in regions of the world where antibiotics are easily accessible, there remains a high incidence in developing nations as well as in certain regions where there is a high incidence of genetic susceptibility. These diseases are a function of poverty, low socioeconomic status, and barriers to healthcare access, and it is in the developing world that a comprehensive prevention program is most critically needed. Development of group A streptococcal vaccines has been under investigation since the 1960s and 50 years later, we still have no vaccine. Factors that contribute to this lack of success include a potential risk for developing vaccine-induced rheumatic heart disease, as well as difficulties in covering the many serological subtypes of M protein, a virulence factor found on the surface of the bacterium. Yet, development of a successful vaccine program for prevention of group A streptococcal infection still offers the best chance for eradication of rheumatic fever in the twenty-first century. Other useful approaches include continuation of primary and secondary prevention with antibiotics and implementation of health care policies that provide patients with easy access to antibiotics. Improved living conditions and better hygiene are also critical to the prevention of the spread of group A streptococcus, especially in impoverished regions of the world. The purpose of this article is to discuss current and recent developments in the diagnosis, pathogenesis, and management of rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease."

The annual average incidence of invasive disease was 2 episodes per 100,000 inhabitants (3.1 for children and 1.9 for adults). The most frequent clinical manifestations were cellulitis (41.3%), bacteremia without focus (19.0%), streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (12.6%), and pneumonia (7.7%). Among 247 invasive isolates analyzed, the most prevalent clones were emm1/ST28 (27.9%), emm3/ST15-406 (9.8%), and emm4/ST39 (6.5%). The emm1/ST28 clone was the only clone detected each year throughout the study period and was associated with more than one third of all fatal outcomes. When invasive isolates were compared with 1,189 non-invasive isolates, the emm1/ST28 clone was significantly associated with invasive disease. The speA and ssa genes were more frequent among invasive emm1 and emm4 isolates, respectively. Forty-two (17%) invasive isolates were resistant to erythromycin (21 harbored the mef gene and 21 the ermB or ermA genes). Twenty-two (8.9%) isolates had reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin (minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC] 2-8 μg/mL) and 32 (13%) were tetracycline-resistant (tetM or tetO gene).

On electron microscopy, they exhibited surface fibrillae similar to those observed in M-protein-rich group A streptococci, but they were not serologically M typable with a battery of 39 M antisera. Rabbit antisera raised against two of the group G strains (1618 and 1750) opsonized the homologous but not the heterologous isolates and exhibited type-specific Ouchterlony immunoprecipitin reactions. Moreover, antisera raised against peptic extracts of strain 1750 also promoted phagocytic killing of that strain. Anti-1750 reacted in high titer in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay against peptic extracts of the homologous strain; these antibodies were removed by absorption with 1750 cells but not by absorption with heterologous strains. These studies represent, to our knowledge, the first analysis of virulence factors of group G streptococci isolated from invasive human disease.

There was no correlation between anti-pneumolysin and anti-streptolysin O titers (r = -0.279). The distribution of anti-pneumolysin titers in patients with high anti-streptolysin O titers did not differ from healthy controls. However, there was a tendency to increased or rising anti-streptolysin O titers in patients with pneumococcal infection. Antibodies obtained during pneumococcal infection might thus give false-positive reactions in the streptolysin O neutralization test. Serum antibodies to streptolysin O do not cross-react with pneumolysin in an ELISA. The pneumolysin ELISA for detection of pneumococcal disease will therefore not be disturbed by false-positive reactions due to antibodies directed against beta-haemolytic streptococci."

Infected children (study group, SG) were examined monthly until the agent could not be detected, quantifying persistent infection. They were compared with randomly selected, non-infected children without asthma matched for age, gender and origin (control group, CG) regarding lung function and inflammatory parameters as well as initiation of allergic diseases judged by family doctor diagnosis after, in median, 22 months. At the first follow-up examination, SG children revealed a higher leukotriene B4 (median 36 pg/ml vs. 19, p=0.04) and 8-isoprostane (median 15 pg/ml vs. 12, p=0.04) in breath condensate characterizing neutrophil, agent-related inflammation and oxidative stress in the lower airways. Cysteinyl leukotrienes, important in acute allergic inflammation, were without difference. Local, anti C. pneumoniae secretory immunoglobulin A antibodies were higher in children after C. pneumoniae infection (optical density median 0.7 vs. 0.4, p=0.001) confirming PCR-EIA results. At the final examination, there was no difference in pathological lung function tests, parameters of exhaled breath condensate or eosinophilia of the nasal mucosa. Incidence of asthma (0/55 vs. 5/54, p=0.03) and allergic rhinitis [3/53 vs. 10/52, p=0.04, odds ratio and 95% confidence interval-OR 0.25 (0.06;0.98)] as well as prevalence of asthma [1/56 vs. 9/58, p=0.02, OR 0.1 (0.01;0.81)] and allergic rhinitis [6/56 vs. 16/58, p=0.03, OR 0.32 (0.11;0.88)] were lower in the SG children. There was no association in atopic eczema. Three children with persistent infection revealed a slightly higher incidence in allergic rhinitis without significance than those with single C. pneumoniae detection (1/3 vs. 2/50), however, not to the CG. In conclusion a C. pneumoniae upper respiratory tract infection may be regarded as a protective factor for childhood asthma or allergic rhinitis in a population of kindergarten and school-age children."

Cbeta is usually found in serotype Ib, less commonly in serotype II, and rarely in other serotypes. The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence, variety and distribution, among GBS serotypes and between invasive and superficial isolates, of bac sequence types. A total of 1101 GBS isolates were tested, from 10 countries, with a bac-specific PCR, and amplicons from all 255 (23 %) with positive results were sequenced. Ninety-seven percent (184/190) of serotype Ib and 37 % of serotype II isolates were bac positive. The Calpha protein gene (bca) was present in 98 % (251/255), and insertion sequences IS1381 and IS861 in 94 % (239/255), of bac-positive isolates. The authors identified 59 bac sequence types belonging to 19 groups, based on length, from 496 to 946 bp, with up to six sequence variants (a-f) in each group. The median bac sequence length of invasive isolates was significantly shorter than that of superficial isolates overall (640 versus 586 bp; P < 0.001) and specifically for serotype Ib (541 versus 676 bp; P < 0.001), and invasive isolates were significantly (P < 0.001) more likely to have one or more 18 bp deletions relative to the original published bac sequence (X59771). bac sequence typing is a useful addition to the previously described genotyping system, and will help to predict relative virulence among S. agalactiae serotype Ib strains."
CD010502,0,15742082,1,[Comparative analysis of clinical and laboratory methods for diagnosing streptococcal sore throat].,Diagnosis and correct treatment of group A streptococcal sore throat is important particularly to prevent non-suppurative sequelae. Clinical findings continue to be used to differentiate streptococcal infection from viral sore throat. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that streptococcal sore throat diagnosis should always be performed by microbiological identification methods. The aim of this study is to evaluate the accuracy of clinical diagnosis in comparison with culture and rapid test.

CD010502,0,10925594,0,[Ludwig's angina].,"Ludwig's angina is a rare infectious condition originating in the oropharyngeal region, most commonly from the teeth. The principal symptoms consist of cervical pain, dyspnea, dysphagia, symmetrical neck swelling and fever. Serious complications include respiratory collapses, mediastinitis, pleural empyema, pericarditis and pericardial tamponade, and may result in the death of the patient. The most useful investigations in patients with suspected Ludwig's angina are clinical assessment, a cervico-thoracic CT-scan to determine the extent of the lesions, microbiological examination and panoramic radiography to detect possible dental focuses of infection. Treatment consists of ensuring adequate ventilation by securing the upper airways, broad spectrum antibiotic therapy, eradication of the source of infection, and often early surgical decompression may be necessary. Rapid diagnosis and appropriate treatment can reduce the mortality rate to 10%."
CD010502,0,9788814,0,Ability of clinical isolates of group A streptococci to adhere to and invade HEp-2 epithelial cells.,"Individual strains of group A streptococci (GAS) differ in virulence, but the reasons for these differences are incompletely understood. To determine if the ability of GAS to cause invasive disease corresponded with their capacity to adhere to or invade epithelial cells, 63 clinical isolates of GAS (40 from patients with systemic infection and 23 from superficial disease) were examined in quantitative assays of bacterial adhesion to and invasion of HEp-2 cells, a continuous line of human pharyngeal epithelial cells. The results showed that individual isolates of GAS varied considerably in their ability to adhere to and penetrate HEp-2 cells. However, on the whole, strains from patients with invasive disease adhered to cells in numbers c.1.5 greater than those from superficial infection. Paradoxically, strains from patients with invasive disease invaded HEp-2 cells to a significantly lesser extent than those from superficial sites, with a two-fold difference in invasion index (defined as the percentage of cell-associated bacteria located intracellularly). To determine if these differences were caused by differences in the production of hyaluronic acid capsule or M protein by the two groups of bacteria, the adherence and invasive capacities of bacteria carrying defined mutations in the genes for these factors were examined. Although M6-protein-deficient [corrected] bacteria were less adherent to HEp-2 cells than the wild-type, neither the hyaluronic acid capsule nor the M protein had a significant influence on the ability of GAS to adhere to or invade HEp-2 cells. The results of this study demonstrate that there are biological differences between GAS isolates associated with invasive and superficial diseases and that these differences can be demonstrated by an assay of bacterial adherence to and invasion of HEp-2 epithelial cells."
CD010502,0,9260962,0,Role of mga in growth phase regulation of virulence genes of the group A streptococcus.,"To determine whether growth phase affects the expression of mga and other virulence-associated genes in the group A streptococcus (GAS), total RNA was isolated from the serotype M6 GAS strain JRS4 at different phases of growth and transcript levels were quantitated by hybridization with radiolabeled DNA probes. Expression of mga (which encodes a multiple gene regulator) and the Mga-regulated genes emm (which encodes M protein) and scpA (which encodes a complement C5a peptidase) was found to be maximal in exponential phase and shut off as the bacteria entered stationary phase, while the housekeeping genes recA and rpsL showed constant transcript levels over the same period of growth. Expression of mga from a foreign phage promoter in a mga-deleted GAS strain (JRS519) altered the wild-type growth phase-dependent transcription profile seen for emm and scpA, as well as for mga. Therefore, the temporal control of mga expression requires its upstream promoter region, and the subsequent growth phase regulation of emm and scpA is Mga dependent. A number of putative virulence genes in JRS4 were shown not to require Mga for their expression, although several exhibited growth phase-dependent regulation that was similar to mga, i.e., slo (which encodes streptolysin O) and plr (encoding the plasmin receptor/glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase). Still others showed a markedly different pattern of expression (the genes for the superantigen toxins MF and SpeC). These results suggest the existence of complex levels of global regulation sensitive to growth phase that directly control the expression of virulence genes and mga in GAS."
CD010502,0,7244098,0,[Comparative evaluation of several methods of determining anti-streptolysin O].,"The Authors have carried out some experiences on four tests for the detection of anti O streptolysin, determining in 210 samples of sera: 1. the antistreptolysin titer according to Rantz and Randall; 2. the antistreptolysin titer according to the latex reaction; 3. five different antistreptococcal antibodies (ASO, ASK, ASHA, ADN-aseB, NAD-ase) with a rapid multi-purpose test for a simultaneous detection; 4. the antistreptolysin titer according to Aso Quantum method. The results obtained on the 210 samples of sera were compared. The relationship between the four methods were examined."
CD010502,0,3046808,0,Streptococcal pharyngitis. Comparison of latex agglutination and throat culture.,"Despite its imperfections, the throat culture remains the ""gold standard"" against which all rapid streptococcal antigen detection tests are compared. Using triple throat swabs, the accuracy of a rapid latex agglutination (LA) test and back up throat culture was determined and compared with a simultaneously obtained additional throat culture in children with suspected streptococcal pharyngitis. Although there was a 95 percent concordancy between throat cultures, the sensitivity of the throat culture was only 87 percent. Despite the LA test's lower sensitivity (78 percent), in this clinical population with a relatively low prevalence of positive throat cultures (19 percent), the predictive value of a negative LA test was only slightly lower than that of the throat culture (94-95 percent vs. 97 percent). Backup throat cultures are commonly recommended for patients with initially negative LA test results, but 10 percent of the patients with group A beta-hemolytic streptococci-positive throat cultures would have been undetected using this approach."
CD010502,0,7035430,0,Formation of molecular complexes between a structurally defined M protein and acylated or deacylated lipoteichoic acid of Streptococcus pyogenes.,"The orientation of lipoteichoic acid (LTA) molecules on the surface of bacterial cells undoubtedly is determined by the ability of the LTA, during its transit through the cell wall, to bind via its polyglycerophosphate backbone or its glycolipid moieties to other constituents of the cytoplasmic membrane and the cell wall. We have investigated the possibility that LTA may become anchored to the cell surface by binding through its polyanionic backbone to positively charged regions of cell wall proteins. LTA was found to prevent the precipitation of partially purified HCl extracts of several strains of streptococci as well as a structurally defined streptococcal M protein molecule (pep M24) in 83% solutions of ethanol. The formation of complexes between LTA and M protein was demonstrated further by immunoelectrophoresis of pep M24 protein with increasing concentrations of radiolabeled LTA and by using antiserum against pep M24 to develop precipitin arcs. Pep M24 electrophoresed alone produced a single precipitin arc close to the origin. In contrast, when electrophoresed as a mixture with LTA or deacylated LTA, the M protein produced a second precipitin arc toward the anode coinciding with the area of migration of the radioactive LTA. Increasing concentrations of LTA or deacylated LTA shifted increasing amounts of the pep M24 antigen to the region of the second arc. Maleylation of M protein to block the positively charged free amino groups before mixing it with LTA prevented the formation of complexes. The complexes formed by the M protein with LTA, but not with deacylated LTA, showed the capacity to bind bovine serum albumin; LTA had been shown previously to bind to the fatty acid binding sites on bovine serum albumin. These results indicate that the LTA molecule is able to bind via its polyanionic backbone to positively charged residues of surface proteins of cells of S. pyogenes. The implications of such interaction as to the orientation of LTA molecules on the surface of cells of S. pyogenes are discussed."
CD010502,0,12193210,0,Suppression of antigen-specific lymphocyte proliferation by Gram-positive bacterial cell walls.,"It is largely unknown how bacterial cell walls (BCW) modulate human immune responses. In the present work the effect of Gram-positive BCW on lymphocyte proliferation responses towards several microbial antigens (Ag) or mitogens was studied. Gram-positive BCW were derived from four indigenous bacterial strains and from one pathogen (Streptococcus pyogenes). All BCW preparations used non-specifically suppressed the proliferation responses of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) against bacterial and viral Ag, but not against mitogens. Both lymphocytes and macrophages or their secreted products mediated the suppressive effects of BCW, which were not IL-10 dependent. Furthermore, the expression of HLA-DR and CD86 on monocytes/macrophages was downregulated by BCW. Unlike in LPS-induced suppression, the CD14 pathway was not used by BCW of Lactobacillus casei (L.c.). The observed results indicate that Gram-positive BCW suppress antigen-specific lymphocyte proliferation through several mechanisms. This non-specific immunosuppression might be a general function of BCW in the bacteria-host interaction, being of importance for bacterial survival and pathogenicity."
CD010502,0,19623252,0,Protein array profiling of tic patient sera reveals a broad range and enhanced immune response against Group A Streptococcus antigens.,"The human pathogen Group A Streptococcus (Streptococcus pyogenes, GAS) is widely recognized as a major cause of common pharyngitis as well as of severe invasive diseases and non-suppurative sequelae associated with the existence of GAS antigens eliciting host autoantibodies. It has been proposed that a subset of paediatric disorders characterized by tics and obsessive-compulsive symptoms would exacerbate in association with relapses of GAS-associated pharyngitis. This hypothesis is however still controversial. In the attempt to shed light on the contribution of GAS infections to the onset of neuropsychiatric or behavioral disorders affecting as many as 3% of children and adolescents, we tested the antibody response of tic patient sera to a representative panel of GAS antigens. In particular, 102 recombinant proteins were spotted on nitrocellulose-coated glass slides and probed against 61 sera collected from young patients with typical tic neuropsychiatric symptoms but with no overt GAS infection. Sera from 35 children with neither tic disorder nor overt GAS infection were also analyzed. The protein recognition patterns of these two sera groups were compared with those obtained using 239 sera from children with GAS-associated pharyngitis. This comparative analysis identified 25 antigens recognized by sera of the three patient groups and 21 antigens recognized by tic and pharyngitis sera, but poorly or not recognized by sera from children without tic. Interestingly, these antigens appeared to be, in quantitative terms, more immunogenic in tic than in pharyngitis patients. Additionally, a third group of antigens appeared to be preferentially and specifically recognized by tic sera. These findings provide the first evidence that tic patient sera exhibit immunological profiles typical of individuals who elicited a broad, specific and strong immune response against GAS. This may be relevant in the context of one of the hypothesis proposing that GAS antigen-dependent induction of autoantibodies in susceptible individuals may be involved the occurrence of tic disorders."
CD010502,0,8861393,0,Lateral genetic transfers between group A and G streptococci for M-like genes are ongoing.,"Previously we described a long-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method to amplify a 4-7 kb target containing most of the components of the vir regulon (mga, emm-like genes and scpA) in a number of group A streptococcus (GAS) isolates. In contrast to GAS, strains of human group G streptococcus (GGS) gave approximately 1.6 or 1.8 kb products. Sequence analysis of the amplified products issued from GGS templates revealed a mosaic consisting of upstream sequence from mga (the gene for positive regulator of vir regulon), an unidentified open reading frame, a short segment of emm (the gene for M protein, an antiphagocytic molecule) and an upstream sequence of scp (C5a-peptidase gene). A full length scpG is present immediately downstream from the mosaic segment in the human GGS genome. The GGS PCR fragment did not code for mga or full length emm. All human GGS isolates are known to code for emm but the gene is separated from scpG by at least 10 kb. Our data, obtained using long-PCR and unrelated strains of GGS, confirm this. We could not detect a homologue of mga in human GGS by hybridization analysis. The mosaic sequence suggests that enbloc transfer of the vir regulon from GAS to a GGS progenitor may have occurred, following which deletion and rearrangement events may have taken place. Partial nucleotide sequences of emm corresponding to the variable domain of M proteins from three local GGS isolates were determined. One sequence (emmGGS6) is 99% identical to emm from a geographically separated isolate of GGS recently described.3 emmGGS6 also has significant homology with emm from a GAS strain (STDONALD) isolated from the same geographical area as was GGS6. The two emm sequences (emmGGS6 and emmSTDONALD) revealed frameshift-compensatory frameshift mutations relative to each other, contributing to lower amino acid homology between the two predicted M proteins. Since emmSTDONALD has no known relatives within the 80 or so emm sequences in the database, we speculate that it could have been laterally acquired from GGS. Horizontal transfers between GGS and GAS may be ongoing."
CD010502,0,8958044,0,Opsonic human antibodies from an endemic population specific for a conserved epitope on the M protein of group A streptococci.,"This study demonstrates the presence of epitope-specific opsonic human antibodies in a population living in an area endemic for group A streptococci (GAS) infection. Antibodies recognizing a conserved C-terminal region epitope (p145, sequence in single letter amino acids: LRRDLDASREAKKQVEKALE) of the M protein of GAS were isolated from human patients by affinity chromatography and were shown to be of the immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) and IgG3 subclasses. These antibodies could reduce the number of colonies of serotype 5 GAS in an in vitro opsonization assay by 71-92%, compared with an equal amount of IgG from control adult donors living in non-endemic areas and without antibodies to p145. Addition of the peptide, p145, completely inhibited this opsonization. Indirect immunofluorescence showed that p145-specific antibodies were capable of binding to the surface of M5 GAS whereas control IgG did not. Using chimeric peptides, which contain overlapping segments of p145, each 12 amino acids in length, inserted into a known helical peptide derived from the DNA binding protein of yeast, GCN4, we have been able to further define two minimal regions within p145, referred to as pJ2 and pJ7. These peptides, pJ2 and pJ7, were able to inhibit opsonization by p145 specific antibodies. Finally, we have observed an association between the age-related development of immunity to GAS and the acquisition of antibodies to the conserved epitope, p145, raising the possibility of using this epitope as a target in a prophylactic vaccine administered during early childhood."
CD010502,0,1906258,0,[Cefaclor versus penicillin V in staphylococcal infections in children].,"Although rheumatic fever virtually no longer occurs in France, pharyngitis due to group A beta-hemolytic streptococci (ABHS) remains a common pediatric problem. American studies have underscored the high rate of bacteriologic treatment failures and recurrences of ABHS pharyngitis. Furthermore, several comparative studies have demonstrated that cephalosporins provide better results on these two parameters. This prospective randomized study compared the effectiveness of penicillin V (50,000 to 100,000 IU/kg/day in three divided doses) and Cefaclor (20 to 40 mg/kg/day in three divided doses), each given for ten consecutive days. From September 1989 through October 1990, 117 children (mean age 5.7 years) were entered into the study. All study subjects were seen as outpatients and found to have ABHS pharyngitis on the basis of a rapid screening test and confirmatory bacteriologic studies. Cefaclor was given to 56 patients and penicillin V to 61. Reevaluation with a repeat bacteriologic study was performed in all patients at the end of the treatment period, or earlier in the event of new clinical manifestations, and towards D40. Among patients given penicillin V, bacteriologic failure rate at completion of therapy was 19.6%, clinical failure rate on D10 was 8%, and recurrence rate on D40 was 16.5%. Cefaclor exhibited greater bacteriologic and clinical effectiveness, with 3.4% bacteriologic failures on D10 (p less than 0.01), 1.7% clinical failures on D10, 8.9% clinical recurrences between D10 and D40, and an overall 10.6% rate of failure or recurrence (p = 0.05)."
CD010502,0,8403745,0,False-negative urine latex particle agglutination testing in neonates with group B streptococcal bacteremia. A function of improper test implementation?,"Although blood cultures remain the most specific indicator of Group B streptococcus (GBS) sepsis, a potentially life-threatening infection in neonates, test results may not be available for 24 to 48 hours. Detection of GBS antigen in the urine by latex particle agglutination (LPA) may speed diagnosis. This study analyzed the sensitivity of the GBS urine LPA assay under clinical conditions. The urine of neonates with early-onset GBS bacteremia was analyzed for GBS antigen over a three-year period at six military medical centers. Overall, 53.5% (38/71) of infants with positive blood cultures had a positive urine LPA test. Only one medical center routinely followed manufacturer's recommendations to concentrate urine specimens before testing. These data suggest that the sensitivity for the urine LPA assay, when performed on unconcentrated urine, is lower than previously reported. Clinicians should insist that the laboratory maximize sensitivity by concentrating urine prior to GBS LPA testing."
CD010502,0,14651571,0,Childhood pustular psoriasis elicited by the streptococcal antigen: a case report and review of the literature.,"The Zumbusch pattern of generalized pustular psoriasis (GPP) classically presents as waves of widespread sheets of sterile pustules on brightly erythematous skin. The occurrence of this disease in childhood is rare, and fewer than 200 cases have been reported in the literature. We describe a 10-year-old boy with GPP who had an elevated serum antistreptolysin titer. Several antigenic factors shown to elicit GPP have been reported, including withdrawal of steroids, emotional stress, and infection. However, we further propose that the group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus can trigger a flare of GPP. We suggest that if pustular psoriasis is suspected clinically, an elevated serum antistreptolysin antibody titer may help identify the causative antigen."
CD010502,0,15053411,0,Pharyngitis.,"Sore throat is one of the most common reasons for visits to family physicians. While most patients with sore throat have an infectious cause (pharyngitis), fewer than 20 percent have a clear indication for antibiotic therapy (i.e., group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal infection). Useful, well-validated clinical decision rules are available to help family physicians care for patients who present with pharyngitis. Because of recent improvements in rapid streptococcal antigen tests, throat culture can be reserved for patients whose symptoms do not improve over time or who do not respond to antibiotics."
CD010502,0,8150968,1,Optical immunoassay for streptococcal pharyngitis: evaluation of accuracy with routine and mucoid strains associated with acute rheumatic fever outbreak in the intermountain area of the United States.,"The Strep A OIA (BioStar, Inc., Boulder, Colo.) rapid detection system is an intriguing technology that utilizes an immunoassay relying on changes in reflected light to directly detect group A streptococcal antigen from specimens. In this evaluation, 424 routine pediatric throat specimens and 20 simulated oropharyngeal specimens with added mucoid (M type 3, 18) strains were cultured and tested by the Strep A OIA. The respective sensitivities and specificities were as follows: Strep A OIA versus enhanced broth culturing, 84.2 and 95.7%; and streptococcus-SXT agar (BBL Microbiology Systems, Cockeysville, Md.) culturing versus enhanced broth culturing, 82.9 and 98.6%. The Strep A OIA is an 8-min, technologist-friendly, accurate technique with an 89.4% agreement with traditional culturing."
CD010502,0,20504982,0,Rapid multiple-locus variant-repeat assay (MLVA) for genotyping of Streptococcus agalactiae.,"Several methods have been used for typing of Streptococcus agalactiae (group B streptococci [GBS]). Methods currently in use may provide inadequate resolution (e.g., typing of capsular polysaccharides and surface protein) or are labor-intensive and expensive (e.g., multilocus sequence typing [MLST] or pulsed-field gel electrophoresis). This work describes the construction and use of a multiple-locus variant-repeat assay (MLVA) on 126 well-characterized human GBS strains, consisting mostly of invasive Norwegian strains and international reference strains. Based on in silico whole-genomic analysis of the genomes of strains A909, NEM316, and 2603V/R, 18 candidate loci were selected and investigated by PCR. Eleven loci showed diversity, and the five most diverse loci were used for the construction of an MLVA, consisting of a multiplex PCR followed by fragment analysis with capillary electrophoresis. The assay generated clusters which corresponded well with those observed by other methods. However, it provided a considerably higher degree of diversity, with 70 different MLVA types compared to 36 types generated by MLST. Simpson's index of diversity for the 5-locus MLVA was 0.963, compared to 0.899 for the MLST in this strain collection. MLVA results will generally be available within 2 days, which is usually faster than MLST. In our hands, MLVA of GBS represents a rapid, easy, and comparably inexpensive method for high-resolution genotyping of GBS."
CD010502,0,22358726,0,Molecular characterization of adult-colonizing Streptococcus agalactiae from an area-based surveillance study in Romania.,"One hundred and forty-eight colonizing isolates from adult Romanian women were conventionally serotyped and screened for antibiotic resistance. Capsular type assignment by multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed for nonserotypeable isolates. Tetracycline and macrolide resistance genes (tetM, tetO, tetL, ermA, ermB, and mefA) including tetM gene association with conjugative elements of the Tn916 family were searched. Molecular typing included PCR screening for major surface protein antigen genes (bac, bca, alp1, alp2/3, alp4, and rib), mobile genetic elements (GBSi1 and IS1548), and rapid detection of hypervirulent clone ST-17. Genetic diversity was assessed by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis of SmaI macrorestriction patterns. Among the colonizing isolates studied, serotypes V and III predominated and high rates of tetracycline and macrolide resistance were observed. The tetM gene occurred in 140 tetracycline-resistant isolates and was associated with the int-Tn916 gene in 94 of them. Most of the isolates displayed a constitutive MLS(B) phenotype (38/46 isolates) and harbored the ermB gene. rib, alp2/3, and alp1 were the most common surface protein genes detected. Either IS1548 or GBSi1 intron were detected in almost half of the isolates and nine serotype III isolates belonged to clone ST-17. PFGE analysis of SmaI macrorestriction patterns, obtained from 118 isolates, revealed an apparent genetic diversity."
CD010502,0,17900297,0,Soluble M1 protein of Streptococcus pyogenes triggers potent T cell activation.,"Streptococcus pyogenes of the M1 serotype is commonly associated with large outbreaks of invasive streptococcal infections and development of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS). The pathogenesis behind these infections is believed to involve bacterial superantigens that induce potent inflammatory responses, but the reason why strains of the M1 serotype are over-represented in STSS is still not understood. In the present investigation, we show that a highly purified soluble form of the M1 protein from S. pyogenes, which lacks the membrane-spanning region, is a potent inducer of T cell proliferation and release of Th1 type cytokines. M1 protein-evoked T cell proliferation was HLA class II-dependent but not MHC-restricted, did not require intracellular processing and was Vbeta-restricted. Extensive mass spectrometry studies indicated that there were no other detectable proteins in the preparation. Taken together, our data demonstrate that soluble M1 protein is a novel streptococcal superantigen, which likely contributes to the excessive T cell activation and hyperinflammatory response seen in severe invasive streptococcal infections."
CD010502,0,3586405,0,Behçet's disease and streptococcal infection.,"The streptococcal antigen was determined in the plasma of 26 patients with Behçet's disease, 30 patients with other uveitis (tuberculosis: 7, sarcoidosis: 6, Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada's disease: 6, toxoplasmosis: 6, trauma: 5), and 63 normal subjects with matched ages. The antigen titer in Behçet's patients, either during ocular attack or remission, was significantly higher than that in the normal control subjects (P less than 0.0001) and that of other uveitis subjects (P less than 0.001). Time-course study in the Behçet's disease cases showed that the titer was the highest during the attack and then decreased gradually as the ocular inflammation subsided. It was also found in two cases that the titer increased markedly just before the ocular attacks. There was no difference between the titer in other uveitis cases and that in the controls. By electron microscope, streptococcal L form-like structures were observed in the plasma and leukocyte layer of the blood of Behçet's patients sampled during the ocular attacks. Streptococcal infection may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of Behçet's disease."

His symptoms did not respond to antibiotics. He had mild bilateral conjunctivitis, a rash over his chest and back, and enlarged lymph nodes, but examination of the nervous system yielded normal results. He had low total white cell and platelet counts. The results of enzyme linked immunosorbent assay for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were equivocal when HIV IgM was detected in serum. Despite treatment with ampicillin his temperature remained high and he developed abnormal neurological signs, including a paraparesis and hyperreflexia of the arms. HIV was isolated from lymphocytes from blood and cerebrospinal fluid. Over the next six weeks the patient improved and was discharged. Two months later abnormal neurological signs persisted in his legs. Although various neurological syndromes associated with seroconversion to HIV have been described, this is probably the first report of a patient with myelopathy at the time of seroconversion."
CD010502,0,8268355,0,Detection of Chlamydia pneumoniae by polymerase chain reaction-enzyme immunoassay in an immunocompromised population.,"Chlamydia pneumoniae has now been associated with pneumonia, bronchitis, pharyngitis, acute chest syndrome of sickle cell disease, and asthma. Because of the difficulty of primary isolation and tissue-culture adaptation of this organism, we used a previously developed polymerase chain reaction-enzyme immunoassay (PCR-EIA) to screen 132 culture-negative bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimens from 108 immunocompromised patients (34% of whom were positive for human immunodeficiency virus) and 7 healthy volunteers. Thirteen specimens (9.8%) from 12 immunocompromised patients (11.1%) gave a positive result; one patient had two positive specimens obtained 3 days apart. No healthy volunteer had a PCR-EIA-positive BAL specimen. Twelve (11.1%) of the immunocompromised patients also had diagnostic levels of antibody. Four patients had positive results in both PCR-EIA and serological tests. Thus 20 (18.5%) of the 108 patients had laboratory evidence of C. pneumoniae infection. These data indicate that diagnosis of acute infection with C. pneumoniae can be established more rapidly and reliably by PCR-EIA than by culture or serology, particularly among immunocompromised patients, in whom serological changes in response to infection are relatively undependable. With an infection rate of 11.1% according to PCR-EIA, C. pneumoniae should be considered in the evaluation and treatment of pneumonia in immunocompromised patients."

CD010502,0,8292633,0,"Demographic, medical history and sexual correlates of HIV seropositive methadone maintained women.","Beginning in January 1989, consecutive female admissions to the ARTC MMTP Clinics in NYC were interviewed about their medical, drug, sexual and social experiences during 6 distinct historical years. Bloods were drawn and each sample tested for HIV via ELISA and Western Blot analysis. The data for 256 females was analyzed. The sample was predominantly Black (56%) and Hispanic (36%). Fifty-four percent (140) were between the ages of 31 and 40; 35% (91) were between the ages of 18 and 30; and 10% (27) were 41 or older. The majority, 179 (69%), had less than a high school education, while 79 (31%) had a high school education or greater. The seropositivity for this sample of females was 60.4%. Aside from the common types of illnesses often seen in gay men infected with the HIV virus (i.e., pneumonia, night sweats, sore throat and swollen glands) our sample of females presented with symptoms such as abnormal discharges from the vagina, infections or abscesses of the veins, kidney or bladder infections, bleeding from the bowels and hepatitis infections. The most commonly reported risk factors among our sample of HIV positive females were sharing injecting materials (38%); injecting drugs in the veins (37.2%); dividing an injection (24.3%); and blood transfusions (10.9%). Of our HIV positive females, 42 of 97 (43.3%) reported having sex with a man they shared needles with only one time so that having sex with a man who is potentially infected with the HIV virus only once may be enough for a female to seroconvert. One limitation of this data is that there is no knowledge of when the HIV positive women seroconverted. Some of the behaviors reported could be due to exposure to AIDS education, and not to the knowledge to their HIV serostatus."
CD010502,0,3974168,0,[Microbiology of streptococcal infections].,"Since the discovery of streptococci by the surgeon of Vienna, Theodor Billroth, more than 100 years ago, they have proved to be a bacterial group of great medical and epidemiological importance. The classification in growth-characteristics on blood culture mediums (alpha-, beta- and gamma-hemolysis) has been detached by the evidence of group specific cell wall antigens. The antigene extraction described by Lancefield can distinguish at least 21 serogroups (A-T). They have also taken over the historical names (S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae etc.). In addition to group relationship the antigen structure of the streptococci cell wall (carbohydrates, peptidoglycanes, M-T-R-proteins and others) is responsible for antigenetic and pathogenetic conditions. Some species of streptococci do also excrete exotoxines (streptolysin, hyaluronidase, bacteriocines, erythrogenic toxins) with antigenetic and pathogenetic significance. Infections with streptococci of the serogroup A, B, D and H are numerously and medically significant. There is a great interest in infections due to A streptococci (pharygitis, impetigo, erysipel, scarlatin fever). The known non-purulent diseases following A streptococci infections (acute rheumatoid fever, acute glomerulonephritis) are streptococcal specific reactions for the individual. Some antigens of the cell wall and also some exotoxines react in human beings as autoantigenes. Human beings are the most important reservoir for streptococci. Nearly 20% of a population have A streptococci in their upper respiratory tract.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD010502,0,15815000,0,Reemergence of emm1 and a changed superantigen profile for group A streptococci causing invasive infections: results from a nationwide study.,"Between 1999 and 2002, 496 invasive group A streptococcal (GAS) isolates from clinical microbiological departments in Denmark and subsequently 487 (98%) questionnaires from the clinicians treating the patients were received as part of a national surveillance. emm types and streptococcal superantigen (SAg) genes were determined. The incidence of invasive GAS infections was on average 2.3 per 100,000 per year. Bacteremia with no focal symptoms (27%) was together with erysipelas (20%) the most prevalent clinical diagnoses. Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome occurred in 10% of patients, of which 56% died. The overall case fatality rate within 30 days was 23%. In total, 47 different emm types were identified, of which emm1, emm3, emm4, emm12, emm28, and emm89 were identified in 72% of the 493 available isolates. During the 4-year period the presence of emm1 increased from 16% in 1999 to 40% in 2002. Concurrently, the presence of emm3 decreased from 23% in 1999 to 2% in 2002. The emm1 isolates predominantly carried speA, although the frequency decreased from 94% in 1999 to 71% in 2002, whereas the emm1-specific prevalence of speC increased from 25 to 53%. In a historical perspective, this could be interpreted as a reemergence of emm1 and could indicate a possible introduction of a new emm1 subclone. However, this reemergence did not result in any significant changes in the clinical manifestations during the study period. Our results show the complexity of invasive GAS infections, with time-dependent variations in the incidence and distribution of emm and SAg genes, which emphasizes the need for continuous epidemiological and molecular investigations."
CD010502,0,11255530,0,Principles of appropriate antibiotic use for acute pharyngitis in adults: background.,"The following principles of appropriate antibiotic use for adults with acute pharyngitis apply to immunocompetent adults without complicated comorbid conditions, such as chronic lung or heart disease, and history of rheumatic fever. They do not apply during known outbreaks of group A streptococcus.1. Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS) is the causal agent in approximately 10% of adult cases of pharyngitis. The large majority of adults with acute pharyngitis have a self-limited illness, for which supportive care only is needed.2. Antibiotic treatment of adult pharyngitis benefits only those patients with GABHS infection. All patients with pharyngitis should be offered appropriate doses of analgesics and antipyretics, as well as other supportive care.3. Limit antibiotic prescriptions to patients who are most likely to have GABHS infection. Clinically screen all adult patients with pharyngitis for the presence of the four Centor criteria: history of fever, tonsillar exudates, no cough, and tender anterior cervical lymphadenopathy (lymphadenitis). Do not test or treat patients with none or only one of these criteria, since these patients are unlikely to have GABHS infection. For patients with two or more criteria the following strategies are appropriate: a) Test patients with two, three, or four criteria by using a rapid antigen test, and limit antibiotic therapy to patients with positive test results; b) test patients with two or three criteria by using a rapid antigen test, and limit antibiotic therapy to patients with positive test results or patients with four criteria; or c) do not use any diagnostic tests, and limit antibiotic therapy to patients with three or four criteria. 4. Throat cultures are not recommended for the routine primary evaluation of adults with pharyngitis or for confirmation of negative results on rapid antigen tests when the test sensitivity exceeds 80%. Throat cultures may be indicated as part of investigations of outbreaks of GABHS disease, for monitoring the development and spread of antibiotic resistance, or when such pathogens as gonococcus are being considered.5. The preferred antibiotic for treatment of acute GABHS pharyngitis is penicillin, or erythromycin in a penicillin-allergic patient."

Antibodies were able to identify less than 0.01% of antigenic A polysaccharides determinants in intact streptococcal cells. It is concluded that A polysaccharide is a marker of the destroyed group A streptococcus cells. The circulation of group A polysaccharide was examined in the sera of patients with rheumatism and acute streptococcal tonsillitis. Group A polysaccharide was detectable more frequently in rheumatic patients, as compared to those with tonsillitis, and circulated for long periods of time in the vascular network. Avidity and titres of antibodies to group A polysaccharide were determined in rheumatic patients with different degrees of antigenemia. In cases of marked antigenemia, correlation was disrupted between the titre and avidity of antibodies to group A polysaccharides."
CD010502,0,1432281,0,Limitations in the usefulness of urine latex particle agglutination tests and hematologic measurements in diagnosing neonatal sepsis during the first week of life.,"We present findings regarding the usefulness of urine latex particle agglutination (LPA) testing for group B streptococcus (GBS) antigen, as well as hematologic values, in diagnosing sepsis during the 1st week of life. Of 475 inborn neonates evaluated, 27 (5.7%) had confirmed sepsis, 47 (9.9%) had indeterminate findings precluding further classification, and 401 (84.4%) were not septic. We examined the following: (1) total white blood cell count (WBC); (2) total polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs); (3) total immature PMNs; (4) immature to total (I:T) neutrophil ratio; (5) immature to mature (I:M) neutrophil ratio; (6) platelet count; (7) a 6-point hematologic score based on the preceding values; and (8) urine LPA for GBS. The positive predictive values of the six hematologic values, as well as the hematologic score, were disappointingly low. Using higher I:T ratios (greater than or equal to 0.30 or 0.40) marginally increased the positive predictive values. More than 60% of our ill, nonseptic neonates had I:T ratios greater than or equal to 0.20. Of 15 infants with culture-proven systemic (blood or cerebrospinal fluid) GBS infection who were tested with urine LPA for GBS antigen, only 4 had positive results. Nineteen infants had positive urine LPAs with concomitant negative blood cultures. Urine cultures were obtained from 18 of these infants. No organisms were isolated from any of these specimens. The mothers of 7 of the infants with positive LPAs and negative blood cultures had received intrapartum antibiotics. Of the remaining 12 infants, the urine LPA was repeated in 8 and results were negative in each case.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD010502,0,16002662,0,Induction of a regulatory phenotype in human CD4+ T cells by streptococcal M protein.,"Regulatory T cells (Tregs) participate in the control of the immune response. In the human system, an IL-10-secreting, T regulatory type 1 cell (Tr1)-like subset of Tregs can be induced by concurrent cross-linking of the TCR and CD46 on naive CD4(+) T cells. Because many viral and bacterial pathogens, including the major human pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes, bind to CD46, we asked whether this bacterium can directly induce Tr1-like cells through the streptococcal ligand for CD46, the M protein. The M5 and M22 proteins were found to induce T cells to develop into the IL-10-producing Tr1-like phenotype. Moreover, whole M5-expressing bacteria, but not isogenic M-negative bacteria, led to proliferation and IL-10 secretion by T cells. The interaction between the M5 protein and T cells was dependent on CD46 and the conserved C repeat region of M5. Supernatants derived from T cells stimulated with M proteins or M protein-expressing bacteria suppressed bystander T cell proliferation through IL-10 secretion. In addition, activation of CD46 through streptococcal M protein induced the expression of granzyme B, providing a second means for these cells to regulate an immune response. These findings suggest that binding to CD46 and exploiting its signaling pathway may represent a strategy employed by a number of important human pathogens to induce directly an immunosuppressive/regulatory phenotype in T cells."

The negatively stained immuno-electron micrograph of Streptococcus pyogenes showed many reactive gold particles on the cell surface. Our findings demonstrated the existence of immunologic mimicry between the sLe(x) oligosaccharide and cell surface antigens of many species associated with infective endocarditis. We propose the hypothesis that if these bacteria escape their normal habitats, the surface components that mimic the sLe(x) oligosaccharide might bind to host antigens of the selectin family which could promote binding to endothelial cells and, consequently, initiation of the events leading to infective endocarditis."
CD010502,0,17768657,0,Characterization of group a streptococcal M23 protein and comparison of the M3 and M23 protein's ligand-binding domains.,"The present study concerns the properties for binding of human plasma and extracellular matrix proteins and the relationship between M3 and M23 molecules. Here, it is demonstrated that M23 protein shows a multiple binding to fibrinogen (FG), fibronectin (FN), human serum albumin (HSA), immunoglobulin G (IgG), kininogen, and collagen type I (CI) in Western blot analysis. Some sets of truncated-recombinant M3 or M23 protein fragments were assayed for their capacity to bind FN, FG, IgG, HSA, and CI. The HSA binding activity resided in the C-repeat region of M3 protein, whereas fibrinogen-binding activity resided in the A-repeat region. The FG, FN, and IgG binding sites were mapped to the N-terminal portion of M23 protein, whereas HSA binding was localized in the B-repeat domain, which has homology with C-repeat domain in M3 molecule. Therefore, it is concluded that the FN, FG, and IgG binding regions in the M3 and M23 proteins are quite dissimilar at the amino acid sequence level, whereas HSA binding is localized to the conserved C-repeat domain in the M3 and M23 proteins."

A modified Streptex (Wellcome Diagnostics, Research Triangle Park, N.C.) technique and the PathoDx latex Strep Grouping Kit (Diagnostic Products Corporation, Los Angeles, Calif.) technique were applied to 220 strains of beta-hemolytic streptococci that were serologically grouped by standard techniques. Agreements between standard and modified Streptex and PathoDx techniques were 99.1 and 100%, respectively. Modified Streptex produced a false-negative for one group G isolate and a weak-positive reaction for a group G reagent with a nongroupable isolate. Sixty-five strains representative of bacteria that may be found in the posterior pharynx in concentrations high enough to cause potential reactions with antigen detection reagents were tested with Streptex and PathoDx reagents. No cross-reactions were observed with any reagent tested when challenged with these 65 strains.

CD010502,0,21557065,0,The nonideal coiled coil of M protein and its multifarious functions in pathogenesis.,"The M protein is a major virulence factor of Streptococcus pyogenes (group A Streptococcus, GAS). This gram-positive bacterial pathogen is responsible for mild infections, such as pharyngitis, and severe invasive disease, like streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. M protein contributes to GAS virulence in multifarious ways, including blocking deposition of antibodies and complement, helping formation of microcolonies, neutralizing antimicrobial peptides, and triggering a proinflammatory and procoagulatory state. These functions are specified by interactions between M protein and many host components, especially C4BP and fibrinogen. The former interaction is conserved among many antigenically variant M protein types but occurs in a strikingly sequence-independent manner, and the latter is associated in the M1 protein type with severe invasive disease. Remarkably for a protein of such diverse interactions, the M protein has a relatively simple but nonideal α-helical coiled coil sequence. This sequence nonideality is a crucial feature of M protein. Nonideal residues give rise to specific irregularities in its coiled-coil structure, which are essential for interactions with fibrinogen and establishment of a proinflammatory state. In addition, these structural irregularities are reminiscent of those in myosin and tropomyosin, which are targets for crossreactive antibodies in patients suffering from autoimmune sequelae of GAS infection."
CD010502,0,17681739,0,M1 protein of Streptococcus pyogenes increases production of the antibacterial CXC chemokine MIG/CXCL9 in pharyngeal epithelial cells.,"Streptococcus pyogenes adheres to epithelial cells of the human pharynx where it can cause pharyngitis. To counteract infection, inflamed epithelium produces peptide antibiotics, among them the CXC chemokine MIG/CXCL9. M protein is both a surface-associated and released virulence factor of S. pyogenes. Here, we show that soluble M1 protein enhances MIG gene expression and synthesis in IFN-gamma stimulated epithelial cells. M1 protein was recognized both by resting and IFN-gamma activated pharyngeal epithelial cells as detected by activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of NF-kappaB, decreased MIG synthesis in IFN-gamma activated cells, demonstrating a key role for NF-kappaB in mediating the enhanced response. Microarrays were used to investigate expression of recognized antimicrobial peptides in pharyngeal epithelial cells after stimulation with a combination of IFN-gamma and M1 protein. Amongst the most up-regulated and expressed genes, were several antibacterial CC and CXC chemokines. To investigate an in vivo context, pharyngeal mucosa was stimulated in vitro and MIG could be detected by immunohistochemistry in epithelial cells. The results show that epithelial cells can recognize solubilized M1 protein and intact S. pyogenes, thereby modulating an antibacterial innate host response that may have bearing on the outcome of streptococcal pharyngitis."

CD010502,0,7520963,0,Towards a vaccine for rheumatic fever: identification of a conserved target epitope on M protein of group A streptococci.,"Rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease remain very common in developing countries, and a vaccine to protect against these disorders would have a great impact on public health. A vaccine must target the M protein of group A streptococci (Streptococcus pyogenes), but until lately immunity was thought to be strain-specific and dependent on antibodies to the variable serotype-specific regions of the protein. Experiments in animals have suggested the conserved region of the M protein as a possible alternative target for protective antibodies. We constructed a 20-aminoacid peptide (peptide 145) within the conserved region of the carboxyl terminus of the protein. In mice the peptide induced serum antibodies that could opsonise reference type 5 streptococci. By enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, positive responses to peptide 145 were obtained with serum from 77 (90%) of 86 Aboriginal subjects and 135 (81%) of 167 Thai subjects living in areas with high exposure to streptococci. Only 10 (14%) of 71 Caucasian subjects with low exposure to streptococci showed positive responses. There was no difference in the proportion positive between subjects with rheumatic heart disease and control groups (other or no heart disease). Antibodies to peptide 145 were able to opsonise isolates of streptococci from Aboriginal and Thai subjects with acute rheumatic fever as well as reference strains. This highly conserved part of the M protein may be a suitable target for vaccines to prevent streptococcal infections and their sequelae."

A total of 29 CF patients were examined and 18 healthy controls. Before the treatment, FSA was detected in the blood and oral liquid in 24.1 and 89.6%, respectively. The indices of the blood and oral liquid correlated. 30 days after conservative treatment the rate of the antigen detection was not less, while after cryosurgical treatment the antigen was not found. Autoantibodies to FSA occurred in the blood of the patients in 86.2%, in the oral liquid in 34.5%. Conservative treatment failed to reduce the antibodies frequency though cryosurgical treatment lowered this frequency to 5.9 and 17.6%, respectively. Immune complexes in the blood of CF patients were registered before the treatment in 10.3%, after conservative treatment in 9.1%, after cryosurgical treatment they were not found. The emergence of autoantibodies and immune complexes may be a normal reaction to introduction of tissue antigen of the affected organ. Detection of the antigen in the blood and oral liquid indicates destruction of the tissue and the test can be used for assessment of the destruction degree."
CD010502,0,16157543,0,Association of group A streptococcal emm types with virulence traits and macrolide-resistance genes is independent of the source of isolation.,"Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococci; GAS) recovered from paediatric pharyngitis (101 isolates) and asymptomatic children (79 isolates) in the same geographical area and period, as well as isolates collected during an enhanced national surveillance programme for GAS invasive diseases (79 isolates), were screened for the incidence of the streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin (spe) genes speA and speC, as well as the macrolide-resistance genes erm(B), erm(A) subclass erm(TR) and mef(A), and typed by emm sequencing. The speA gene was detected with comparable incidence among throat isolates (13.9 % of asymptomatic children and 16.8 % of pharyngitis isolates) and in 25 % of invasive cases; in contrast, speC incidence was, surprisingly, higher in paediatric populations (55.4 % in pharyngitis isolates and 65.8 % in asymptomatic children) than in invasive isolates (30 %; P < 0.0001). Macrolide resistance was detected in 26.6, 38.0 and 37.6 % of strains belonging to invasive, asymptomatic and pharyngitis populations, respectively. The different incidences of exotoxin and antibiotic-resistance genes among populations did not appear to have an intrinsic clinical significance, but may reflect the propensity of these traits to be associated with certain emm types independent of the source from which the strains were isolated. Further investigations with larger emm-type populations are warranted to confirm this."

PCR tests in which a primary ""touchdown"" PCR was followed by secondary reactions using PV or HRV specific primers were able to differentiate HRVs of 48 serotypes from EVs. PVnRT-PCR and HRVnRT-PCR were then used to test nasal and throat swabs from adult subjects with naturally acquired respiratory virus infections. The swabs were also analysed for respiratory viruses by cell culture techniques and the rates of PV identification by the two methods were compared. PVnRT-PCR was found to be at least five times more sensitive than cell culture for the detection of PVs in these clinical specimens. Paired acute and convalescent serum samples were tested for complement fixing antibodies to adenovirus, influenza A and B, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza viruses 1, 2, and 3, Myco plasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydia psittaci.

CD010502,0,1525678,0,[The role of Toxoplasma gondii in the etiology of chronic tonsillitis in children].,"Toxoplasma gondii is known to have an affinity to lymphatic tissue. A series of 506 children with chronic tonsillitis were examined serologically for toxoplasmosis by means of CBR, IIR and ELISA. In 7.7% of the children examined low toxoplasma antibody titers were recorded. Isolation experiments performed on tonsillar tissue of the children with the highest toxoplasma antibody titers were negative. Direct microscopic evidence of tissue toxoplasma cysts failed to be established and the cytopathologic picture characteristic of nodal toxoplasmosis was not present in smears of cells aspirated from lymphatic nodes regional to palatine tonsils. The authors assumed that chronic toxoplasma tonsillitis did not occur in the series studied. In our ecological conditions, T. gondii may not be involved in the etiology of chronic tonsillitis, or it may participate to an extent which is epidemiologically negligible. (Tab. 4, Ref. 14)."
CD010502,0,2422314,0,Localization of protective epitopes of the amino terminus of type 5 streptococcal M protein.,"We have used a set of overlapping chemically synthesized peptides representing the amino terminus of type 5 streptococcal M protein to localize protective, as opposed to nonprotective and tissue-crossreactive epitopes that might be appropriate for vaccine formulations. Rabbit antisera raised against SM5(1-35) reacted in high titer with pep M5 by ELISA and opsonized type 5 streptococci. None of the antisera crossreacted with human heart tissue or myosin. Antisera against SM5(26-35) reacted with SM5(1-35) and pep M5 but failed to opsonize type 5 streptococci. Particle-phase ELISA indicated that SM5(26-35) antibodies were directed against nonprotective determinants of pep M5 that were not exposed on the surface of viable organisms. Opsonization and ELISA inhibition assays showed that, of the SM5(1-35) antibodies that reacted with M5, all were inhibited by SM5(14-35), whereas none was inhibited by SM5(26-35), suggesting that the protective epitopes of SM5(1-35) resided between residues 14 and 26. This was confirmed by subsequent chemical synthesis of this region; SM5(14-26) totally inhibited SM5(1-35) antibodies that reacted with pep M5 in ELISA, and completely inhibited opsonization of type 5 streptococci by SM5(1-35) antibodies. SM5(14-26) evoked high titers of type-specific, opsonic antibodies against type 5 streptococci, confirming the protective immunogenicity of this 13-residue peptide of type 5 M protein."

Current methods of monitoring this modification event involve N-terminal sequencing and are cumbersome, slow and not amenable to routine analysis. In this study we demonstrate that surface enhanced laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry can be used to monitor modification of the M1 protein by the secreted bacterial cysteine protease, SpeB. This method, when combined with a specific antibody capture step provides a specific, rapid and sensitive assay for key virulence factors of the important human pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes."

In this population-based study, 87 bacteraemic GAS isolates from adult patients in Pirkanmaa Health District (HD), Finland, during the period 1995-2004 were emm typed and genotyped for superantigen (SAg) profiles. The epidemiological and clinical data of the patients were analysed with the microbiological characterisation data. Among the 87 isolates, 18 different emm types were found. emm1, emm28 and emm81 were the three most common types, covering 52% of isolates. The prevalence of specific emm types showed high variability during the 10-year study period. We could not find any association between the emm type and clinical features of bacteraemic infection, such as underlying diseases, disease manifestations or case fatality. Of nine superantigen genes examined, speA and speC were identified in 20 and 30% of the strains, respectively. No association was found between disease manifestation and the presence of single superantigen genes. The 26-valent GAS vaccine would have covered only 62% of isolates causing invasive disease in Pirkanmaa HD during the study period."

The latex agglutination test was applied in 1336 cases. Maternal vaginal colonization was detected in 14%, anal colonization in 17% of the cases. A comparison of the results obtained with the latex agglutination test and with conventional bacteriological procedures (no gradual bacteriology, incubation 48 hours) showed antigen identification in amniotic fluid in 54%, respectively 24%. In gastric aspirates a B streptococcal contamination was detected by bacteriology in 40% of cases, by the rapid latex agglutination test in 22%. If no streptococci were found in the mother, amniotic fluid or gastric aspirates were contaminated in 4% or 6%, respectively (agglutination test or bacteriology, respectively). With a sensitivity of approximately 50% and a specificity of 98%, the latex agglutination test proved superior to routine bacteriology. All clinically contaminated newborn (positive blood specimens) were clearly identified by this test. With this new latex agglutination test, a procedure is now available to detect B streptococcal contamination in newborns within less than half an hour, thus an intra- or postpartal antibiotic therapy can be applied early."

CD010502,0,9795991,0,A secreted streptococcal cysteine protease can cleave a surface-expressed M1 protein and alter the immunoglobulin binding properties.,"Previous studies of recent clinical isolates of serotype M1 group A streptococci indicated that they display two patterns of non-immune human IgG subclass binding reactivity associated with their M1 protein. One group reacted with all four IgG subclasses (type IIo), while the second group expressed an M1 protein reacting preferentially with human IgG3 (type IIb). In this study, we have demonstrated that a cysteine protease, SpeB, present in culture supernatants of M1 serotype group A streptococcal isolates expressing type IIb IgG binding protein, can convert a recombinant Emm1 protein from a type IIo functional profile to a type IIb profile by removal of 24 amino acids from the N-terminus of the mature M1 protein. Furthermore, SpeB can convert bacteria expressing IgG binding proteins of the type IIo phenotype into those expressing type IIb proteins. The role of the cysteine protease as the central bacterial enzyme in this posttranslational modification event was confirmed by generation of an isogenic SpeB-negative mutant."
CD010502,0,12624012,0,Epidemiologic analysis of invasive and noninvasive group a streptococcal isolates in Hong Kong.,"Since the mid-1980s, there has been a resurgence of severe forms of invasive group A streptococcal (GAS) disease in many Western countries. In Hong Kong, a similar increase has also been observed in recent years. One hundred seven GAS isolates collected from 1995 to 1998 from individuals with necrotizing fasciitis, toxic shock syndrome, meningitis, or other type of bacteremic sepsis (invasive group, n = 24) as well as from individuals with minor skin and throat infections (noninvasive group, n = 83) were characterized through serologic and/or emm sequence typing. Thirty-two M protein gene sequence types were identified. Types M1, M4, and M12 were the most prevalent in both the invasive group and the noninvasive group; together they accounted for 70.8 and 37.3% of the isolates, respectively. No clear pattern of skin and throat infection M types was observed. Type M1 was overrepresented in the invasive and pharyngeal isolates. The same pulsed-field gel electrophoresis pattern was shared by most invasive and all pharyngeal M1 isolates. Overall, resistance to erythromycin (32%) and tetracycline (53%) was high, but M1 isolates were significantly less likely to have resistance to either antimicrobial agent than non-M1 isolates. One novel emm sequence type, stHK, was identified in an isolate from a patient with necrotizing fasciitis. Minor emm gene sequence alterations were noted for 31 isolates, and for 13 of these isolates, deletion, insertion, or point mutations were seen in the hypervariable 50 N-terminal residues."

No correlation was found between levels of anti-SPM antibodies and ASO titres. However, in serial serum samples from one patient with uncomplicated streptococcal sore throat, it was possible to demonstrate that the increase in the level of anti-SPM antibody paralleled the rise in ASO titre. The anti-SPM antibody level and the ASO titre in this patient persisted throughout a six-month period of follow-up."

Genotypic markers for tissue site preference lie within emm genes, which encode fibrillar surface proteins that play a key role in virulence. emm gene products (M and M-like proteins) display an extensive array of binding activities for tissue and plasma proteins of the human host. In a previous study, a high-affinity binding site for human plasmin(ogen) was mapped to the emm53 gene product. In this report, a structurally similar plasminogen-binding domain is found to be widely and selectively distributed among group A streptococci harboring the emm gene marker for the skin as the preferred tissue site for infection. The findings are highly suggestive of a central role for bacterial modulation of host plasmin(ogen) during localized infection at the epidermis."

However, the characteristics of asymptomatic carriers vary geographically in different countries. We aimed to investigate S. pyogenes isolated from healthy schoolchildren in China. From 2007 to 2008, a total of 94 S. pyogenes isolates were obtained from healthy schoolchildren in Beijing and Chongqing, China. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing, determination of macrolide resistance genes (ermB, ermA and mefA), emm genotyping, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) were performed. The resistance rate to macrolides was 96.8% and to tetracycline was 92.6%. All macrolide-resistant isolates exhibited constitutive resistance; 77 isolates (84.6%) had the ermB gene, while 14 isolates (15.4%) had the ermA gene. Among the macrolide-resistant isolates, the most frequent emm type was emm12 (51.6%), followed by emm22 (14.3%) and ST1815 (8.8%). PFGE analysis revealed 12 different patterns, with a given pattern having the same sequence type (ST) by MLST and the same emm type. In conclusion, the rate of macrolide resistance to S. pyogenes is currently very high in China. This is due primarily to the dissemination of a limited number of clones."
CD010502,0,10639442,0,Absence of SpeB production in virulent large capsular forms of group A streptococcal strain 64.,"Passage in human blood of group A streptococcal isolate 64p was previously shown to result in the enhanced expression of M and M-related proteins. Similarly, when this isolate was injected into mice via an air sac model for skin infection, organisms recovered from the spleens showed both increased expression of M and M-related proteins and increased skin-invasive potential. We show that these phenotypic changes were not solely the result of increased transcription of the mRNAs encoding the M and M-related gene products. Rather, the altered expression was associated with posttranslational modifications of the M and M-related proteins that occur in this strain, based on the presence or absence of another virulence protein, the streptococcal cysteine protease SpeB. The phenotypic variability also correlates with colony size variation. Large colonies selected by both regimens expressed more hyaluronic acid, which may explain differences in colony morphology. All large-colony variants were SpeB negative and expressed three distinct immunoglobulin G (IgG)-binding proteins in the M and M-related protein family. Small-colony variants were SpeB positive and bound little IgG through their M and M-related proteins because these proteins, although made, were degraded or altered in profile by the SpeB protease. We conclude that passage in either human blood or a mouse selects for a stable, phase-varied strain of group A streptococci which is altered in many virulence properties."
CD010502,0,3160236,0,The next 10 years in the treatment of pelvic infections.,"The future developments in the treatment of pelvic infections in women are based on recent changes. There is an expanded knowledge of the complex multibacterial nature of pelvic infections, the clinical view of salpingitis has radically changed, and there have been great modifications in antibiotic treatment strategies with particular emphasis on anaerobes and Chlamydia. In the next 10 years, the following new developments may be expected. In the diagnosis of pelvic infection, there will be new efforts to have better clinical tests and the use of nonspecific and specific laboratory tests. The rapid identification of Neisseria gonorrhea, group B beta-hemolytic Streptococcus, Chlamydia, and Bacteroides fragilis would be an important laboratory aid. The treatment of pelvic infection will not be significantly altered by the introduction of new antibiotics. There will be an emphasis on new combinations of currently available antibiotics and studies that focus on the long-term follow-up of treated patients. In the understanding of the pathophysiology of pelvic infections, the importance of the spermatozoa as a carrier of bacteria and the potent immunosuppression due to seminal fluid will be investigated in detail, along with a greater emphasis on treatment of the male."

In addition, an increasing number of Gram-negative bacteria have been found in hand infections. As differential diagnosis, tumours and non-septic arthritis must be considered. Treatment includes surgical debridement, immobilisation and functional rehabilitation. Crucial for the surgical strategy are the virulence of the pathogens, the resistance of the patient and the location of the infection. If functional recovery cannot be expected, salvage procedures like arthrodeses and resection arthroplasties are sometimes required.

Anti-My1 was tested against sera from patients with other types of autoimmune diseases as well as uncomplicated streptococcal infections. Sera from systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Sjögren's syndrome (SS), and poststreptococcal acute glomerulonephritis patients demonstrated idiotypic reactivity with anti-My1. Affinity-purified anti-myosin antibodies from SLE, SS, and ARF sera also reacted strongly with anti-My1, indicating that immunoglobulins produced in these diseases share idiotypic determinants.

Antibodies to PA-Ag were found to be present in 30 of 31 patients with APSGN, in 1 of 36 patients with uncomplicated group A streptococcal upper respiratory tract infections, and in 1 of 36 normal adults. By using immunoelectrophoresis, it was found that PA-Ag activates the alternate pathway of C. Other water-soluble streptococcal fractions, used as controls, did not activate the C system. The demonstration that PA-Ag is present in the glomeruli in the early phase of APSGN and its ability to activate C3 and factor B suggest that PA-Ag may be involved in the pathogenesis of APSGN, via in situ C activation."

Molecular typing of the N-terminal portion (emm typing) of the M protein was performed with 817 isolates (535 GAS and 282 GCS/GGS). We also performed genotyping of the C-repeat region in 769 of these isolates to identify J14 sequence types. The profile of emm types for Fiji was very different from that found for the United States and Europe. There were no dominant emm types and a large number of overlapping types among clinical disease states. Commonly found GAS emm types in industrialized countries, including emm1, emm12, and emm28, were not found among GAS isolates from Fiji. Over 93% of GAS isolates and over 99% of GCS/GGS isolates that underwent J14 sequence typing contained either J14.0 or J14.1. Our data have implications for GAS vaccine development in developing countries and suggest that a vaccine based upon the conserved region of the M protein may be a feasible option for Fiji and potentially for other tropical developing countries."

Vaginal cultures were obtained at the time of sterile speculum examinations from 300 laboring women. The frequency of vaginal group B streptococcal colonization was 10%. A duplicate vaginal swab was used in the immunoassay, which required less than 10 minutes for completion. The immunoassay could reproducibly detect 3+ to 4+ growth (greater than 10(5) colony-forming units per milliliter of vaginal fluid), which was considered heavy colonization. The overall sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 33, 95, 43, and 93%, respectively, compared with culture.

CD010502,0,2188957,0,Sequence and structural characteristics of the trypsin-resistant T6 surface protein of group A streptococci.,"The gene for the trypsin-resistant surface T6 protein of Streptococcus pyogenes D471 (M type 6) was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The complete nucleotide sequence of the gene (tee6) and its flanking regions was determined and found to include only one major open reading frame coding for a protein of 537 amino acids (Mr, 57,675). The N terminus of the deduced protein sequence exhibits features of a typical signal sequence, and the C-terminal segment was found to have a high degree of homology with the membrane anchor region of other gram-positive surface proteins, such as streptococcal M protein, wapA protein from Streptococcus mutans and staphylococcal protein A. A hexapeptide having the consensus sequence LPSTGE and located immediately upstream of the C-terminal hydrophobic segment showed the highest degree of conservation at both the protein and DNA levels, with nearly all reported surface proteins from gram-positive cocci. The amino acid composition of the T6 protein revealed 21% serine and threonine residues distributed nearly regularly throughout the molecule, and analysis of the secondary structure predicted a conformation composed of greater than 70% beta-sheet potential interrupted by beta-turns or random coils. Localization experiments in E. coli show very little T6 protein in the periplasmic space. When found here, however, this T6 protein had a molecular mass of 55 kilodaltons, similar to that extracted from the streptococci by nonionic detergent. Most of the T6 protein was found localized in the membrane fraction, where it was composed of a triple band of 60, 58, and 57 kilodaltons. The coexistence of streptococcal surface proteins which are either resistant (T protein) or sensitive (M protein) to proteolytic enzymes may offer a new dimension to the modulation of these antigens under specific biological conditions."

Identification of beta-hemolytic streptococci (S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, Lancefield group C and G streptococci, S. anginosus) and enterococci is based on the careful observation of colony morphology and hemolytic pattern on sheep blood agar plates; subsequent genus or species confirmation is achieved by rather simple biochemical or enzymatic tests and by detection of streptococcal cell wall carbohydrate antigens (Lancefield grouping). Rapid antigen tests for the detection of group A and B streptococci directly from pharyngeal and vaginal swabs, respectively, are highly specific, thus allowing an immediate antibiotic therapy in patients with a positive test result. The reported sensitivities of these nonculture tests are too low to exclude streptococcal colonization or infection, however. The elucidation of the genetics of some major virulence factors of group A and B streptococci has contributed to knowledge of their association with disease, and molecular techniques have supplemented the traditional (mostly culture and serologic) methods for an improved understanding of the epidemiology and pathogenesis of streptococcal infections. Recently employed examples include the M protein gene typing of group A streptococci by oligonucleotide probes and the use of PCR assays for the detection of the genes encoding for the pyrogenic exotoxins. Restriction enzyme endonuclease digestions of bacterial DNA in association with DNA fragment separation by conventional or PFGE have been applied successfully to several species of Streptococcaceae (e.g., S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae). Enterococci are important pathogens in the hospital setting, exhibiting high morbidity and mortality rates in bacteremic patients with severe underlying disease. Molecular typing methods have clearly confirmed their potential to be nosocomially transmitted. E. faecalis and E. faecium still account for the majority of human infections, but some of the newer enterococcal species (at present 19 species are recognized) have been encountered as well. The definitive species identification of enterococci requires the performance of an array of biochemical tests. The increasing antimicrobial resistance of enterococci, including high-level resistance to penicillins and aminoglycosides and occasionally also to glycopeptides, has hampered standard therapeutic regimens. All enterococci isolated from serious infections should be tested for high-level gentamicin and streptomycin resistance by one of several methods evaluated; beta-lactamase production (primarily found in E. faecalis) is reliably detected by the nitrocefin test.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
CD010502,0,19778763,0,Global emm type distribution of group A streptococci: systematic review and implications for vaccine development.,"emm sequence typing is the most widely used method for defining group A streptococcal (GAS) strains, and has been applied to isolates in all regions of the world. We did a systematic review of the global distribution of GAS emm types. 102 articles and reports were included (38 081 isolates). Epidemiological data from high-income countries were predominant, with sparse data from low-income countries. The epidemiology of GAS disease in Africa and the Pacific region seems to be different from that in other regions, particularly high-income countries. In Africa and the Pacific, there were no dominant emm types, a higher diversity of emm types, and many of the common emm types in other parts of the world were less common (including emm 1, 4, 6, and 12). Our data have implications for the development of GAS vaccines. On the basis of the available data, the current formulation of the experimental multivalent emm vaccine would provide good coverage in high-income countries, particularly USA, Canada, and Europe, but poor coverage in Africa and the Pacific, and only average coverage in Asia and the Middle East."

We have demonstrated glomerular deposition of the outer membranes of Haemophilus parainfluenzae (HP) antigens (OMHP) and the presence of HP-specific IgA in the serum of patients with IgAN. In this study, we investigated the production of IgA and several cytokines by tonsillar mononuclear cells (TMC) from IgAN patients induced by stimulation with OMHP. The spontaneous production of total IgA and TGF-beta by TMC from IgAN patients was higher than that by TMC from patients with chronic tonsillitis (CT) (P < 0.05). Stimulation with OMHP in vitro enhanced the production of HP-specific IgA by TMC from IgAN patients (P < 0.01), but not by TMC from CT patients. OMHP stimulation also enhanced the production of TGF-beta and IL-10 by TMC from IgAN patients (P < 0.001). These results suggest that the infection of HP in the tonsil may be involved in the etiology of IgAN."

Clinical assessments and laboratory safety tests were performed during and after therapy. Before enrollment, all patients were screened for group A beta-haemolytic streptococci (GABHS) with a rapid test, and a throat swab was taken for confirmatory culture. The presence of GABHS at baseline was confirmed in 41 azithromycin- and 44 penicillin V-treated patients. Cure or improvement was seen in 98% and 100% of azithromycin- and penicillin V-treated patients, respectively.

Forty-four of 46 azithromycin patients, and 46 of 47 erythromycin patients, had S. pyogenes isolated at baseline and were included in the clinical and bacteriological analyses. At the end of treatment (day 10-12), 38 (86%) of the 44 azithromycin patients were considered cured, four (9%) improved, one (2%) failed and one relapsed. In the erythromycin group, 30 of 46 (65%) were considered cured, 15 (33%) improved and one (2%) failed.

CD010502,0,2642469,0,Fibrinogen binding and resistance to phagocytosis of Streptococcus sanguis expressing cloned M protein of Streptococcus pyogenes.,"The biological properties of Streptococcus pyogenes M protein cloned and expressed in S. sanguis were investigated. The spm-5 gene previously cloned into Escherichia coli was subcloned into the E. coli-S. sanguis shuttle plasmid pVA838 to produce a newly constructed plasmid, pBK100. Cells of S. sanguis transformed with pBK100 expressed 53-, 55-, and 58-kilodalton polypeptides reacting with type 5 M protein antiserum in immunoblots. The M protein was expressed on the surface of S. sanguis cells as shown by the capacity of the intact cells to (i) inhibit the reactivity of anti-type 5 antibodies with purified M protein as demonstrated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; (ii) inhibit the opsonization by M5 antisera of type 5 S. pyogenes; (iii) express M-protein-like fibrils on the surface of the organisms that react with M5 antisera as revealed by immunoelectron microscopy; (iv) bind plasma fibrinogen and, as a consequence, resist phagocytosis by human blood neutrophils; and (v) be rendered susceptible to phagocytosis by opsonic M5 antisera. These results provide additional evidence that streptococcal M proteins bind host proteins as a ploy to evade host defense mechanisms."

In this report, cytotoxic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that recognize epitopes on both enteroviruses and the bacterium Streptococcus pyogenes are described. Murine anti-streptococcal mAbs that were crossreactive with streptococcal M protein, human cardiac myosin, and other alpha-helical coiled-coil molecules were found to neutralize coxsackieviruses B3 and B4 or poliovirus type 1. The viral-neutralizing anti-streptococcal mAbs were also cytotoxic for heart and fibroblast cell lines and reacted with viral capsid proteins on a Western immunoblot. Alignment of amino acid sequences shared between streptococcal M protein, coxsackie-virus B3 capsid protein VP1, and myosin revealed 40% identity in a 14- to 15-amino acid overlap. Synthetic peptides containing these sequences blocked mAb reactivity with streptococcal M protein. The data show that antibodies against alpha-helical structures of bacterial and viral antigens can lead to cytotoxic reactions and may be one mechanism to explain the origin of autoimmune heart disease."

CD010502,0,9252400,0,"Streptococcal protein H forms soluble complement-activating complexes with IgG, but inhibits complement activation by IgG-coated targets.","Protein H, a surface protein of Streptococcus pyogenes interacting with the constant Fc region of IgG, is known to be released from the streptococcal surface by a cysteine proteinase produced by the bacteria. Poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis and rheumatic fever are conditions in which immune complexes and autoimmune mechanisms have been suggested to play pathogenetic roles. The present study demonstrates that addition of protein H to human serum produces complement activation with dose-dependent cleavage of C3. The activation was IgG-dependent and the result of complexes formed between IgG and protein H. These complexes were size heterogeneous with molecular masses of 400 kDa to 1.4 MDa. Using complement-depleted serum reconstituted with complement proteins, the activation by protein H was found to be dependent of the classical, but independent of the alternative pathway of complement. In contrast to results of experiments based on soluble protein H.IgG complexes, complement activation was inhibited by protein H when IgG was immobilized on a surface. The interaction between C1q and immunoglobulins represents the first step in the activation of the classical pathway, and protein H efficiently inhibited the binding of C1q to IgG immobilized on polyacrylamide beads. Protein H reduced C3 deposition on the IgG-coated beads and inhibited immune hemolysis of IgG-sensitized erythrocytes. Finally, significantly less C3 was deposited on the surface of protein H-expressing wild-type streptococci than on the surface of isogenic mutant bacteria devoid of protein H. The results demonstrate that protein H.IgG complexes released from the streptococcal surface can produce complement breakdown at the sites of infection, whereas complement activation on bacterial surfaces is inhibited. This should have important implications for host-parasite relationships. In addition, soluble protein H.IgG complexes might contribute to immunological complications of streptococcal infections."

CD010502,0,21684437,0,Clinical and histologic resolution of poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis with large subendothelial deposits and kidney failure.,"A 16-year-old male adolescent who had fallen and scratched his knee developed cold-like symptoms. Gross hematuria, oliguria, and peripheral edema appeared about 2 weeks after his fall. Tests showed hypocomplementemia, increased antistreptolysin O titers, and severe kidney failure with hematuria/proteinuria. Kidney biopsy showed endocapillary proliferative glomerulonephritis visible using light microscopy and deposits of complement C3 on capillary walls, detectable using immunofluorescence microscopy. Although these findings suggested that he had acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (APSGN), electron microscopy failed to detect subepithelial humps, a feature typical of APSGN; instead, massive electron-dense deposits were visible in the subendothelial space. A second biopsy performed 3 months later showed mesangial cell proliferation without endocapillary proliferation using light microscopy and the disappearance of subendothelial electron-dense deposits in electron micrographs, suggesting that APSGN had resolved. Glomerular deposition of nephritis-associated plasmin receptor, a nephritogenic streptococcal antigen, was observed in the first biopsy specimen, but not the second. The patient required 4 hemodialysis treatments, and within 1 year of supportive therapy only, kidney function and urinalysis had normalized. This is an interesting case of APSGN presenting with acute kidney injury and atypical massive subendothelial deposits, but no subepithelial deposits on electron microscopy, a pattern resembling that in membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis type I."
CD010502,0,10323210,0,Functional analysis of IgA antibodies specific for a conserved epitope within the M protein of group A streptococci from Australian Aboriginal endemic communities.,"The mucosa is one of the initial sites of group A streptococcal (GAS) infection and salivary IgA (sIgA) is thought to be critical to immunity. However, the target epitopes of sIgA and the function of sIgA in GAS immunity, in particular the role of accessory cells and complement, is largely unknown. We studied the aquisition and the function of sIgA specific for a conserved region epitope, p145 (sequence: LRRDLDASREAKKQVEKALE) of the M protein. Peptide 145-specific sIgA is highly prevalent within an Aboriginal population living in an area endemic for GAS and acquisition of p145-specific sIgA increases with age, consistent with a role for such antibodies in immunity to GAS. Human sIgA and IgG specific for p145 were affinity purified and shown to opsonize M5 GAS in vitro. Opsonization could be specifically inhibited by the addition of free p145 to the antibodies during assay. Opsonization of GAS was totally dependent on the presence of both complement and polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and, moreover, affinity-purified p145-specific sIgA was shown to fix complement in the presence of M5 GAS. These data show that mucosal IgA to this conserved region peptide within the M protein has an important role in human immunity against GAS and may be useful in a broad-based cross-protective anti-streptococcal vaccine."
CD010502,0,8990095,0,B-cell-derived IL-10: production and function.,"In vitro and in vivo studies identify IL-10 as a key cytokine that inhibits cell-mediated immunity and inflammation while promoting humoral responses. The present review summarizes our studies regarding the ability of B cells to secrete IL-10. When established lines are considered, the production of human IL-10 is restricted to mature B-cell lines and correlates with Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) expression. Accordingly, EBV infection induces purified tonsil B lym phocytes to produce high levels of human IL-10, whereas viral IL-10 (encoded by EBV) remains undetectable. Exogenous IL-10 enhances EBV-induced B-cell growth, while a neutralizing anti-IL-10 antibody inhibits it, suggesting that IL-10 acts as an autocrine growth factor for EBV-infected B lymphocytes. Normal B lymphocytes secrete lower levels of human IL-10 following activation through B-cell receptor or CD40 antigen. While addition of exogenous IL-4 diminishes CD40-induced secretion of IL-10, addition of Staphyloccocus aureus Cowan I (SAC) particles increases it. Neutralization of endogenous IL-10 does not alter growth of CD40-activated B cells but inhibits their IgG, IgA, and IgM secretion, especially when costimulated with SAC particles. Finally, the simul taneous blocking of both endogenous IL-10 and IL-6 inhibits two-thirds of the production of the three isotypes when B cells were triggered through CD40 in the presence of SAC particles, suggesting that IL-10 synergizes with IL-6 to sustain differentiation of CD40-activated B lymphocytes. Overexpression of B-cell-derived IL-10 is likely to contribute in vivo to different pathologies such as B-lymphoproliferative disorders and autoimmune diseases."

CD010502,0,17467801,0,"Membrane cofactor protein (MCP, CD46) binding to clinical isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes: binding to M type 18 strains is independent of Emm or Enn proteins.","The complement regulatory protein CD46 (MCP, membrane cofactor protein) is used as a cell receptor by a number of bacterial and viral pathogens, including Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A Streptococci). The highly variable M (Emm) proteins are virulence factors of S. pyogenes, and Emm proteins of serotypes 5, 6 or 22 are able of binding to CD46, thus mediating the binding of Streptococci to human cells. In this work, using a soluble construction encompassing the extracellular domain of human CD46, we have analyzed its binding to clinical isolates of S. pyogenes, including isolates of the M types 1, 3 and 18 that are frequently found in invasive infections or rheumatic fever. Our data show a strong binding of CD46 to bacteria of M types 1, 3, 8, 18, 24, 28, 29, 31 and 78; weak binding to M6 and M29 and no binding to M types 11, 12, M27 or M30. Surprisingly, CD46 bound to isogenic mutants of one clinical M18 isolate lacking the Emm protein or Emm and the Emm-related protein Enn, regardless of having capsule or not. In addition, these isogenic mutants bound to keratinocytes in a CD46-dependent manner, confirming the role of CD46 as one of the cell receptors for Group A Streptococci. Furthermore, CD46 did not bind to a recombinant Emm 18 construct, confirming that Emm is not involved in CD46 binding to M18 bacteria. Emm-dependent and -independent CD46 binding of clinical isolates of Streptococci confirms the importance of CD46 as a cell target that might confer pathogens some biological advantages over the host."
CD010502,0,9108405,0,Strict lymphotropism of Epstein-Barr virus during acute infectious mononucleosis in nonimmunocompromised individuals.,"Previous investigations of exfoliated oropharyngeal cells from individuals suffering from infectious mononucleosis (IM) suggested that the oropharyngeal epithelia are the primary target and also the site of life-long persistence of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). This concept was widely accepted. However, the investigation of histological sections with more sensitive EBV detection techniques has drawn this concept into doubt since EBV proved to be constantly absent in normal epithelial cells. To elucidate the discrepancy, throat washings and peripheral mononuclear blood cells from 16 patients suffering from IM were investigated for EBV-DNA and EBV gene products employing highly sensitive in situ hybridization, immunocytochemistry, and polymerase chain reaction. Although all patients exhibited latently infected B lymphocytes in peripheral blood, samples of exfoliated oropharyngeal cells were constantly EBV-negative with the exception of three cases. In these cases, the patients additionally suffered from purulent ulcerating tonsillitis, EBV-infected B cells, but no EBV-infected epithelial cells were detectable. These findings support the view that recirculating lymphocytes of B-cell origin, but not epithelial cells are the initial target of EBV during primary infection and that B cells also represent the site of life-long viral persistence."
CD010502,0,12813026,0,Rheumatic fever-associated Streptococcus pyogenes isolates aggregate collagen.,"Acute rheumatic fever is a serious autoimmune sequel of Streptococcus pyogenes infection. This study shows that serotype M3 and M18 S. pyogenes isolated during outbreaks of rheumatic fever have the unique capability to bind and aggregate human basement membrane collagen type IV. M3 protein is identified as collagen-binding factor of M3 streptococci, whereas M18 isolates bind collagen through a hyaluronic acid capsule, revealing a novel function for M3 protein and capsule. Following in vivo mouse passage, conversion of a nonencapsulated and collagen-binding negative M1 S. pyogenes into an encapsulated, collagen-binding strain further supports the crucial role of capsule in mediating collagen binding. Collagen binding represents a novel colonization mechanism, as it is demonstrated that S. pyogenes bind to collagen matrix in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, immunization of mice with purified recombinant M3 protein led to the generation of anti-collagen type IV antibodies. Finally, sera from acute rheumatic fever patients had significantly increased titers of anti-collagen type IV antibodies as compared with healthy controls. These findings may suggest a link between the potential of rheumatogenic S. pyogenes isolates to bind collagen, and the presence of collagen-reactive autoantibodies in the serum of rheumatic fever patients, which may form a basis for post-streptococcal rheumatic disease. These anti-collagen antibodies may form a basis for poststreptococcal rheumatic disease."

Etiologic diagnosis of pharyngitis is only important in Streptococcus pyogenes or group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal infections because antibiotic therapy is mandatory to prevent further complications, especially acute rheumatic fever. Diagnosis has classically been based on bacterial isolation from throat swabs. There are no standardized methods for this culture in terms of culture medium, incubation atmosphere or the identification tests to be performed. Currently, a large number of commercial reagents are available, which, through different immunological techniques, allow direct antigen detection in the clinical sample. Most of these products show good sensitivity and specificity values, with the added advantage of providing a rapid result, especially if they are performed at points of care.

An analogous antigen (or antigens) is present in the cytoplasmic membrane of human myocardial cell fibers. The depletion of antiserum to the streptococcal L-forms both by the culture of L-forms grown in meat or casein media and by the homogenate of the cardiac muscle leads to the inhibition of immunofluorescence. The depletion of serum by the homogenate of other tissues (liver) or by L-form culture does not virtually affect the immunofluorescence intensity. According to the authors' opinion, the similarity of antigens of group A streptococcus L-forms to the antigenic components of organ tissues is likely to be responsible for long-term persistence of the microorganisms under consideration and to favour, in some cases, the occurrence of autoantibodies. The latter circumstance might lead to pathological changes in organs containing cross-reacting antigens."

All EP elicited a high proliferative response in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In patients with bacteremia, low neutralization in acute-phase sera was associated with development of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. Lack of neutralization in acute-phase sera was more common in patients infected with the T1emm1 serotype. The majority of patients did not develop the ability to neutralize the mitogenic activity of their infecting isolate despite a significant increase in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay titer in early convalescent-phase sera. In patients with the ability to neutralize GAS EP, the immune response remained high over at least 3 years. In contrast, the neutralization capacity conferred by intravenous immunoglobulin and/or plasma treatment disappeared within 3 months."

Paired acute and convalescent serum samples from children with GAS-associated pharyngitis were assayed, and a strong immune response to SCPA was demonstrated that was independent of the infecting M type and the age of the patient. Western blot analysis of bacterial extracts revealed that all tested M types expressed SCPA. The immune response to SCPA correlated with the anti-streptolysin O and anti-DNase B responses. These data confirm the immunogenicity of SCPA in humans. Previous knowledge of SPCA's role in virulence, its highly conserved nature, and the results of mouse protection studies make SCPA an ideal vaccine candidate for the prevention of GAS disease."
CD010502,0,17142387,0,Proteomic analysis and identification of Streptococcus pyogenes surface-associated proteins.,"Streptococcus pyogenes is a gram-positive human pathogen that causes a wide spectrum of disease, placing a significant burden on public health. Bacterial surface-associated proteins play crucial roles in host-pathogen interactions and pathogenesis and are important targets for the immune system. The identification of these proteins for vaccine development is an important goal of bacterial proteomics. Here we describe a method of proteolytic digestion of surface-exposed proteins to identify surface antigens of S. pyogenes. Peptides generated by trypsin digestion were analyzed by multidimensional tandem mass spectrometry. This approach allowed the identification of 79 proteins on the bacterial surface, including 14 proteins containing cell wall-anchoring motifs, 12 lipoproteins, 9 secreted proteins, 22 membrane-associated proteins, 1 bacteriophage-associated protein, and 21 proteins commonly identified as cytoplasmic. Thirty-three of these proteins have not been previously identified as cell surface associated in S. pyogenes. Several proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli, and the purified proteins were used to generate specific mouse antisera for use in a whole-cell enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The immunoreactivity of specific antisera to some of these antigens confirmed their surface localization. The data reported here will provide guidance in the development of a novel vaccine to prevent infections caused by S. pyogenes."
CD010502,0,8034498,0,Clinicopathologic approach to the diagnosis of neonatal sepsis.,"Perinatally acquired bacterial neonatal sepsis is a low incidence, high risk disease with a relatively benign treatment. Accurate diagnosis is difficult because there is no definitive diagnostic test; even blood cultures have an unacceptably low sensitivity. Therefore, the clinician must accept that a number of neonates who do not have the disease will have treatment initiated for sepsis. In order to treat rapidly all infants with sepsis and to minimize therapy for those without infection, historical, clinical, and laboratory data can be used together in a management approach to achieve optimal results."
CD010502,0,2515729,0,Possible role of Streptococcus pyogenes in mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome. IX. Quantitation by ELISA of streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin in the serum of MCLS patients.,"In the present paper we describe the use of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reinforced with an introduction of monoclonal antibody, for the detection and quantitation of streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin (SPE) in the serum of patients with mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome (MCLS). The amount of SPE was usually at a high level, and its 100% incidence in patients' sera was proved whenever the assay was made on the day of admission, thereby showing a marked contrast to carefully matched control sera which failed to mediate any positive result. As for the change in detected amount of the toxin, a clear dichotomy was observed between the serum of gammaglobulin-treated patients and that of infants given aspirin; in the former the positive result turned to negative rapidly following the initiation of treatment coupled with a defervescence, while in the latter the reduction of SPE levels was scarcely monitored for as long as 17 days after the onset of illness. Quantitation of SPE might be an auxiliary test for the diagnosis of MCLS, because a considerable amount of SPE was assessed in a patient who developed characteristic huge coronary artery aneurysms following an illness which did not fulfill the diagnostic criteria. These findings support our speculation in relation to the certain role of S. pyogenes as an etiological agent for MCLS. The possible mechanisms of gammaglobulin treatment in reducing the prevalence of cardiovascular lesions and the duration of systemic inflammation are discussed."
CD010502,0,7776097,1,Comparison of an optical immunoassay technique with two culture methods for the detection of group A streptococci in a pediatric office.,"For detecting group A beta-hemolytic streptococci in an office setting, an optical immunoassay method was compared with two culture methods. The sensitivity and specificity of OIA as compared with 5% sheep blood agar cultures were 91.4% and 95.6%, and as compared with a Todd-Hewitt broth method were 90.4% and 94.1%, respectively."
CD010502,0,11472417,0,Skin T cell proliferative response to M protein and other cell wall and membrane proteins of group A streptococci in chronic plaque psoriasis.,"To determine and compare the T cell response to M protein and other group A streptococcal (GAS) antigens, T cell lines (TCL) were cultured from the lesional skin of 33 psoriatic patients and 17 disease controls. GAS-reactive skin TCL were tested in proliferation assays with recombinant M6 protein, and extracts of cell wall and membrane from type M6 GAS and its corresponding M gene deletion mutant. Initially, GAS-reactive skin TCL were obtained from 16 of 25 (64%) psoriasis, and from seven of 17 (41%) control patients. Eleven psoriatic and four control GAS-reactive TCL proliferated to M6 cell wall extract, whereas all the TCL from both groups responded to the extract of M6 membrane proteins. This difference in response to the two extracts was significant for both groups of patients (psoriasis, P = 0.0335, controls, P = 0.0156). GAS-reactive TCL from a further eight psoriasis patients showed no difference in response to cell wall extract from M6 GAS (containing the M protein minus its C-terminus) compared to that of its corresponding M gene deletion mutant. Furthermore, GAS-reactive TCL did not proliferate to recombinant M6 protein. However, a small, but significant reduction in proliferation by the eight psoriatic GAS-reactive TCL to the M-negative (lacking the M protein C-terminus) compared to M6-positive membrane extract was observed (P = 0.01). These findings suggest that GAS-reactive T cells in skin lesions of chronic plaque psoriasis proliferate to streptococcal membrane and, to a lesser extent, cell wall proteins. However, psoriatic skin T cells do not recognize cell wall M protein."
CD010502,0,12679262,0,Molecular basis of group A streptococcal virulence.,"The group A streptococcus (GAS) (Streptococcus pyogenes) is among the most common and versatile of human pathogens. It is responsible for a wide spectrum of human diseases, ranging from trivial to lethal. The advent of modern techniques of molecular biology has taught much about the organism's virulence, and the genomes of several GAS types have now been deciphered. Surface structures of GAS including a family of M proteins, the hyaluronic acid capsule, and fibronectin-binding proteins, allow the organism to adhere to, colonise, and invade human skin and mucus membranes under varying environmental conditions. M protein binds to complement control factors and other host proteins to prevent activation of the alternate complement pathway and thus evade phagocytosis and killing by polymorphonuclear leucocytes. Extracellular toxins, including superantigenic streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins, contribute to tissue invasion and initiate the cytokine storm felt responsible for illnesses such as necrotising fasciitis and the highly lethal streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. Progress has been made in understanding the molecular epidemiology of acute rheumatic fever but less is understood about its basic pathogenesis. The improved understanding of GAS genetic regulation, structure, and function has opened exciting possibilities for developing safe and effective GAS vaccines. Studies directed towards achieving this long-sought goal are being aggressively pursued."
CD010502,0,8132333,0,Streptococcal M6 protein binds to fucose-containing glycoproteins on cultured human epithelial cells.,"M6 protein of Streptococcus pyogenes binds directly to HEp-2 cell surfaces and helps to mediate bacterial adhesion. Two epithelial cell receptors for M protein were identified as 97- and 205-kDa glycoproteins. Purified recombinant M6 protein (rM6) showed a dose-dependent and saturable binding to isolated HEp-2 membranes in an enzyme immunoassay. The HEp-2 cell receptors were selectively denatured by pretreatment of isolated membranes at 80 degrees C or with chymotrypsin; binding activity for rM6 was reduced 83 and 80%, respectively. Pretreatment of the HEp-2 membranes with neuraminidase-N-glycosidase, neuraminidase-O-glycosidase, alpha-L-fucosidase, or Ulex lectin caused 33, 42, 73, and 80% reduction of rM6 binding, respectively. Quantitative analysis of HEp-2 cells pretreated with alpha-L-fucosidase showed that the 97- and 205-kDa glycoproteins lost 70 and 62% of their abilities to bind M6 protein and that 33% of the HEp-2 cell's ability to bind whole streptococci was also lost. These results indicated that binding of M6 protein to HEp-2 cell surfaces is highly selective for certain fucose-containing oligosaccharides on these glycoproteins."
CD010502,0,3521161,0,[Cytotoxic effect of lymphocytes on autologous blood monocytes in the presence of streptococcal group A antigens in patients with primary erysipelas].,"The present work deals with a modification of the cytotoxic test for the determination of the cytotoxic activity of lymphocytes in infectious diseases. This modification is based on the use of the suspension of mononuclear blood cells, simultaneously containing effector cells (sensitized lymphocytes) and target cells (autologous monocytes). The cytotoxic effect on monocytes is observed after the preliminary incubation of nonadhering cells (lymphocytes) with the antigen of microorganisms causing the infectious process. A statistically significant increase in the cytotoxic activity of lymphocytes was recorded in patients with primary erysipelas at the acute period of the disease. The cytotoxic effect has been found to persist at a high level for two weeks. By the end of the disease this effect drops to the level characteristic of clinically normal persons. An elevated level of the cytotoxic activity of lymphocytes in the presence of streptococcal antigens of one type has been detected in 72% of patients with primary erysipelas. This indicates that type-nonspecific streptococcal antigens take part in the formation of delayed hypersensitivity, which is also confirmed by the data obtained in animal experiments."
CD010502,0,8789012,0,Comparison of a modified DNA hybridization assay with standard culture enrichment for detecting group B streptococci in obstetric patients.,"Infection with group B streptococcus (GBS) results in 12,000 to 15,000 cases of neonatal sepsis annually in the United States. GBS is transmitted vertically in up to 70% of infants born to colonized women. Early-onset GBS disease (septicemia, pneumonia, or meningitis occurring within 7 days of life) has a mortality rate of up to 50%, with permanent neurologic sequelae occurring in 15 to 50% of infants surviving meningeal infection. Because of the fulminant nature of neonatal infection, it would be useful to have a rapid assay for determining the GBS status of laboring women. This study illustrated how a commercially available DNA probe-based test was modified to achieve this goal. Modifications included the use of mixed cultures rather than pure isolates for detecting GBS, along with a shorter culture enrichment time and a sample concentration step. To this end, vaginal and rectal swabs from 402 pregnant women during their third trimester were cocultured and tested for GBS rRNA. The 8-h enrichment protocol resulted in an assay with a sensitivity of 95% and specificity of 98%, while the 3-h enrichment protocol revealed a sensitivity of 73% and specificity of 99%. In summary, GBS was detected in the majority of colonized women in less than 4 h. This study illustrated the usefulness of the approach in identifying the most heavily colonized women, who are at the highest risk of transmitting GBS to their neonates. The modified test would have a significant impact on both the medical management and antibiotic therapy for these women and their newborns."
CD010502,0,3334555,0,Pathogenic factors in group B streptococci types IV and V.,Abstract not available
CD010502,0,7596292,0,Role of the conserved C-repeat region of the M protein of Streptococcus pyogenes.,"The surface-located M protein functions to protect Streptococcus pyogenes (the group A streptococcus) from phagocytosis by polymorphonuclear leukocytes. It has been suggested that this protection results from the ability of M protein to bind factor H, a serum protein that can inhibit the activation of complement. Among different serological variants of M protein, the C-repeat domain is highly conserved and is exposed on the bacterial surface. This domain has been implicated in binding to complement factor H and in M-protein-mediated adherence of streptococci to human keratinocytes in the cutaneous epithelium. In this study, we constructed an S. pyogenes mutant strain which expresses an M6 protein from which the entire C-repeat domain was deleted. As predicted, this mutant did not adhere well to human keratinocytes and was unable to bind to factor H. Unexpectedly, the mutant was able to survive and multiply in human blood. Therefore, while the binding of factor H and the facilitation of adherence to keratinocytes appear to involve recognition of the C-repeat domain, a region of the M-protein molecule distinct from the C-repeat domain confers upon S. pyogenes its ability to resist phagocytosis."
CD010502,0,21053711,0,Serious pH1N1 influenza illness and pneumonia despite inactivated vaccine: success of prompt diagnosis and treatment.,"A 42-year-old bedridden patient suddenly became seriously ill with an unexplained fever (39 degrees C) and hypoxemia (pulse oximetry oxygen saturation: patient, 90%; normal, >98%). He had received the inactivated vaccine for pandemic 2009 H1N1-influenza (pH1N1) 41 days earlier. He had no cough, sore throat, or pharyngitis. Therefore, he did not satisfy the Centers for Disease Control criteria for an ""influenza-like illness."" Nevertheless, his nasopharyngeal swab was tested by rapid enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for influenza A and found positive. He was promptly treated with supplemental oxygen and oseltamivir (75 mg twice daily) for 5 days. On day 6, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction test confirmed the virus to be pH1N1. A chest radiograph was normal on day 1 but revealed bilobar pneumonia on day 2. This was considered bacterial superinfection and empirically treated for 10 days with 3 g of piperacillin and 375 mg of tazobactam. The patient fully recovered. This case of pH1N1 vaccine failure occurred because no vaccine is 100% protective, and immune response may be poorer in patients with chronic medical problems. Vaccine failure was not due to immunodeficiency or improper vaccine handling. We credit this patient's recovery to our facility's heightened surveillance for influenza even among the vaccinated individuals, and also in those without classic influenza-like illness."

CD010502,0,8064423,0,Value of a rapid enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for maternal vaginal group B Streptococcus colonization.,"Because group B streptococci maternal colonization is a risk factor for the development of neonatal sepsis, a commercially available rapid test was evaluated for its ability to detect intrapartum maternal colonization. A total of 180 paired vaginal swabs were cultured for group B streptococci and assayed by the Equate test. Of the 15 positive cultures, only 1 was detected by the Equate test, resulting in a sensitivity of 7% and a false-negative rate of 93%. The Equate test detected group B streptococci colonization only at a concentration of > or = 10(7) colony-forming units. These results indicate that the Equate test is not adequately sensitive for screening intrapartum populations for group B streptococci colonization."

CD010502,0,20665975,0,Diversity of emm sequence types in group A beta-haemolytic streptococci in two remote Northern Territory Indigenous communities: implications for vaccine development.,"There is a high burden of disease due to group A streptococcus (GAS) in remote Northern Territory (NT) Indigenous communities. A proposed 26-valent GAS M-type vaccine covers 80-90% of pharyngeal and invasive isolates in the US. We examined the diversity and distribution of emm types in two remote Indigenous communities in the NT Top End over a 17-year period and compared them to the proposed vaccine types. Eighty emm types were identified between 1991 and 2007. Diversity in both communities was high (overall Simpson's index 0.976), but varied between communities. Prior to 2004, 71 emm types were identified and an additional 9 emm types were identified during a period of active surveillance in 2004-2005. The proposed 26-valent vaccine would be expected to cover only 20% of emm types recovered in this study. Of the 80 emm types, 16 (20%) were new sequence types identified since the last assignment of M types in 2002. The diversity of streptococcal isolates was higher than that reported from most industrialized countries, and similar to that described in several developing countries. A vaccine based on such a variable antigen is unlikely to provide effective protection in the highest risk populations."
CD010502,0,20012726,0,Distribution of fibronectin-binding protein genes (prtF1 and prtF2) and streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin genes (spe) among Streptococcus pyogenes in Japan.,"Two hundred and seventy-two strains of Streptococcus pyogenes isolated from patients with invasive and noninvasive infections in Japan were evaluated for the prevalence of fibronectin-binding protein genes (prtF1 and prtF2). The possible associations of the genes with streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin genes, macrolide resistance genes, and emm types were also evaluated. Overall, about 50% of S. pyogenes isolates carried fibronectin-binding protein genes. The prevalence of the prtF1 gene was significantly higher among isolates from noninvasive infections (71.4%) than among isolates from invasive infections (30.8%; P = 0.0037). Strains possessing both the prtF1 and prtF2 genes were more likely to be isolates from noninvasive infections than isolates from invasive infections (50.6% vs 15.4%; P = 0.019). S. pyogenes isolates with streptococcus pyrogenic exotoxin genes (speA and speZ) were more common among isolates without fibronectin-binding protein genes. The speC gene was more frequently identified among isolates with fibronectin-binding protein genes (P = 0.05). Strains belonging to emm75 or emm12 types more frequently harbored macrolide resistance genes than other emm types (P = 0.0094 and P = 0.043, respectively). Strains carrying more than one repeat at the RD2 region of the prtF1 gene and the FBRD region of the prtF2 gene were more prevalent among strains with macrolide resistance genes than among strains negative for macrolide resistance genes. These genes (i.e., the prtF1, prtF2, and spe genes) may enable host-bacteria interaction, and internalization in the host cell, but may not enable infection complications such as invasive diseases."

CD010502,0,3512807,0,Comparison of a latex agglutination test and four culture methods for identification of group A streptococci in a pediatric office laboratory.,"A latex agglutination test and four culture methods for the detection of group A hemolytic streptococci were compared in a pediatric office laboratory. The anaerobic (GasPak) and Detekta-Kit methods produced the highest recovery rates, but aerobic incubation of 5% blood agar plates gave very acceptable results (sensitivity 92%, or 98% if the 1+ positive cultures were eliminated; specificity 100%), and had fewer disadvantages. Delaying inoculation of plates for 2 to 6 hours resulted in significantly greater numbers of strongly positive (3+ and 4+) cultures. The group A selective sheep blood agar media as used in this study offered no advantage. The Culturette test had a sensitivity of 72% and specificity of 98%, compared with the GasPak method, and 77% and 97%, respectively, compared with standard aerobic cultures. Thus it appears too insensitive to be used alone, but might complement culture methods in selected patients."

In basic specificity study, the QuickVue Dipstick Strep A showed positive reaction only to group A Streptococci strains among 34 strains of 10 species of bacteria. In detection limit study, the QuickVue Dipstick Strep A had a capacity to detect Group A Streptococci in 1.0 x 10(4); cfu/ml (1.0 x 10(3) cfu/test). This sensitivity was about 6 times higher than that of the existing similar immunochromatographical test, STREP A TESTPACK Plus (TESTPACK, Abbott Japan, Tokyo). In clinical study compared with bacterial culture test using 100 patients' throat swab specimens, the QuickVue Dipstick Strep A showed a sensitivity of 94.4% (34/36), a specificity of 100% (64/64) and an accuracy of 98% (98/100). Furthermore in correlation study with the reference test, TESTPACK, the QuickVue Dipstick Strep A showed 100% agreement (34 positive and 66 negative specimens). As the QuickVue Dipstick Strep A has several advantages as not only simple operation, rapid reaction and good performance but also easy storage (under room temperature), compact size and minimum waste products, we conclude that this new test is useful as Point-of-Care Testing kit and plays a peripheral role in the diagnosis of Group A Streptococci infection and pertinent medical treatment by antibacterial agents."

The Swiss Centre for Quality Control (CSCQ) has organised External Quality Assessment Schemes (EQAS) for these kits since 1997. From 2004 to 2008, negative, positive, and moderate positive antigen containing samples were sent to the laboratories. After analysing the samples, 7749 results obtained with more than 14 different test kits were returned to the CSCQ. The correct results ranged between 84.8 and 99.8% which shows that all the test kits gave good results during the EQAS. However, in case of a negative result with clinical suspicion of a bacterial pharyngitis, the result is to be confirmed by culture."

We now show that the first two complement control protein (CCP) modules of the C4BP alpha-chain, plus the four residues connecting them, are necessary and sufficient for binding a bacterial virulence factor, the Streptococcus pyogenes M4 (Arp4) protein. Structure determination by NMR reveals two tightly coupled CCP modules in an elongated arrangement within this region of C4BP. Chemical shift perturbation studies demonstrate that the N-terminal, hypervariable region of M4 binds to a site including strand 1 of CCP module 2. This interaction is accompanied by an intermodular reorientation within C4BP. We thus provide a detailed picture of an interaction whereby a pathogen evades complement."

New variants of the Sic protein frequently appear in M1 epidemics as a result of positive natural selection. To gain further understanding of the molecular basis of M1 epidemics, the sic gene was sequenced from 471 pharyngitis and 127 pyogenic and blood isolates recovered from 598 patients living in metropolitan Helsinki, Finland, during a 37-month population-based surveillance study. Most M1 GAS subclones recovered from pyogenic infections and blood were abundantly represented in the pool of subclones causing pharyngitis. Alleles shared among the pharyngitis, pyogenic, and blood samples were identified in throat isolates a mean of 9.8 months before their recovery from pyogenic infections and blood, which indicates that selection of most sic variants occurs on mucosal surfaces. In contrast, no variation was identified in the emm and covR/covS genes."

Positive IF reactions were recorded in 83% of the children with bronchopneumonia, 81.8% of those with acute pharyngitis, 77.7% of those with acute upper respiratory tract infections and 66.6% of those with acute bronchitis. In 68.75% of the IF-positive cases 2-5 different antigens were simultaneously visualized. Herpes and parainfluenza virus antigens appeared to be predominant.

CD010502,0,10518039,0,M protein of a Streptococcus dysgalactiae human wound isolate shows multiple binding to different plasma proteins and shares epitopes with keratin and human cartilage.,"Besides group A (GAS), Lancefield group C beta-haemolytic streptococci (GCS) have been implicated as a causative agent in outbreaks of purulent pharyngitis. In this study we have investigated a class CI M protein of a Streptococcus dysgalactiae1:256, revealed that 26% of these sera showed serological cross-reactivity between a 68-kDa cartilage protein and the N-terminal part of MC. Only 8% of the sera of healthy patients showed this property. In additional, MC also cross-reacted with antibodies recognising epidermal keratins. The cross-reacting 68-kDa protein from cartilage was different from human serum albumin, but was recognised with anti-vimentin immune serum. The MC was cloned and the gene sequenced. By using PCR, recombinant gene fragments encoding characteristic peptide fragments of MC were expressed in Escherichia coli. The peptides were used to map the binding sites for plasma proteins and to locate the cross-reacting epitopes on the MC molecule. In consequence, sequence alignments revealed that MC shared homologous regions with vimentin and different keratins. Our data, obtained with MC, suggest that not only infections with GAS but also infections with GCS and possibly GGS (the latter species can also produce class CI M-like proteins) may be responsible for the formation of streptococcal-associated sequel diseases."
CD010502,0,3980676,0,Prevention of Streptococcus mutans colonization by salivary IgA antibodies.,"The levels of salivary and serum IgA, IgG, and IgM antibodies to the seven serotypes (a-g) of Streptococcus mutans were established in 12 laboratory volunteers using a sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Salivary IgA antibody levels to the serotype c organism were significantly lower (P less than 0.005) than antibody levels to the other six serotypes of S. mutans. Similar results were found with a purified S. mutans serotype c carbohydrate. Serum IgG and IgM antibody titers to the serotype c whole cells were significantly higher (P less than 0.05) than to four other S. mutans serotypes (a, e-g). The abilities of S. mutans serotypes c and d to colonize molar tooth surfaces were examined in eight volunteers. S. mutans serotype d was cleared from the tooth surfaces within 24 hr of challenge, whereas S. mutans serotype c was detected in six of the eight volunteers after 2 weeks and in three of eight after 3 weeks. These results provide additional evidence for the role of salivary IgA antibodies in regulating S. mutans infection and suggest that the low levels of salivary IgA antibodies to S. mutans serotype c may contribute to the predominance of this serotype in the U.S. population."
CD010502,0,11170997,0,Characterization of consecutive Streptococcus pyogenes isolates from patients with pharyngitis and bacteriological treatment failure: special reference to prtF1 and sic / drs.,"To analyze bacteriological treatment failure in streptococcal pharyngitis, 40 consecutive Streptococcus pyogenes isolates from 18 patients were characterized. For 17 patients, isolates were indistinguishable with respect to emm type, random amplified polymorphic DNA pattern, and presence of prtF1 encoding the fibronectin-binding protein F1. prtF1 was detected only in the 11 isolates (4 patients) with emm12 and in the single isolate with emm6. Further analysis by vir(mga) regulon typing, sequencing of sic encoding the streptococcal inhibitor of complement from 19 isolates with emm1 (9 patients), and sequencing of drs (distantly related sic) from 11 isolates with emm12 revealed distinct sic alleles with insertions and/or deletions in sic that corresponded to differences in restriction patterns of the vir(mga) regulon only for paired isolates of 2 patients. Among isolates with emm12, 2 novel drs alleles were found. Analysis of these data suggests that neither the presence of prtF1 nor the diversification of sic / drs is required for the persistence of S. pyogenes in pharyngitis."

Hydrophobicity of Streptococcus pyogenes is primarily due to lipoteichoic acid (LTA) on the streptococcal surface but the mechanism(s) whereby LTA is retained on the surface is poorly understood. In this study, we sought to determine whether members of the M protein family consisting of Emm (M protein), Mrp (M-related protein), Enn (an M-like protein), and the streptococcal protective antigen (Spa) are involved in anchoring LTA in a manner that contributes to hydrophobicity of the streptococci and its ability to form biofilms."

The fact of the presence of specific antigens in the L-forms of streptococci in comparison with the initial streptococcal strains has been confirmed."
CD010502,0,3511046,0,Complete nucleotide sequence of type 6 M protein of the group A Streptococcus. Repetitive structure and membrane anchor.,"The DNA sequence of the gene for type 6 M protein of Streptococcus pyogenes contains two extended tandem repeat regions and one nontandem repeat region. We suggest that the duplication and deletion of these repeats generates the observed diversity in size and sequence among the family of M proteins in the group A streptococci. In addition, the DNA sequence reveals the presence of a 42-amino-acid signal peptide, a region rich in proline that is thought to be located in the cell wall, and a membrane anchor sequence at the carboxyl-terminal end of the protein. Signals similar to the consensus sequences recognized for the initiation of transcription and translation in Gram-positive bacteria have been identified in the DNA sequence. Codon usage is similar to that of other Gram-positive bacteria and significantly different from that of Escherichia coli."
CD010502,0,3049909,0,Human monoclonal antibodies to group B streptococcus. Reactivity and in vivo protection against multiple serotypes.,"Group B streptococcal (GBS) infections cause significant mortality and morbidity among infants. Passive antibody immunotherapy has been proposed as treatment for infected infants. To this end, two human mAb-secreting cell lines were produced by EBV immortalization of human B cells. The mAbs were specific for the group B polysaccharide and bound to strains of all five serotypes as demonstrated by ELISA and crossed immunoelectrophoresis. The mAbs reacted and opsonized 100% (132/132) of the clinical isolates tested which represented all four capsule types. Both prophylactic and therapeutic protection with these mAbs were demonstrated in neonatal rats given lethal infections of types Ia and III human clinical isolates. These data indicate that a single human mAb directed against the group B carbohydrate can protect against GBS infections caused by the different serotypes. This antibody may be useful in the passive immunotherapy of infants infected with GBS."
CD010502,0,2645567,1,Group A streptococcus-associated upper respiratory tract infections in a day-care center.,"Little information is available about the epidemiology of group A streptococcal upper respiratory tract infections in child day-care centers. During an initial 3-month period, symptomatic upper respiratory tract infections associated with throat cultures or rapid antigen detection tests positive for group A streptococci developed in 55 of 214 (26%) children and adult staff in one day-care center. When the entire day-care center population (except for those receiving antibiotics at the time) was then surveyed, 52 of 146 (36%) children and two of 24 (8%) adult staff had throat cultures positive for group A streptococci. Of the 54 group A streptococcal isolates found during the survey, the three most frequently encountered serotypes were M2,T2/28 (35%), M3,T3/13 (30%), and M-NT, T25 (20%). Rapid antigen detection was performed at the same time as the throat culture in the first 98 individuals examined during the culture survey but was positive in only 11 (35%) of 31 individuals with positive throat cultures. Sensitivity of the rapid antigen test was related to degree of positivity of the throat culture but not to age. The overall group A streptococcal positivity rate was 49% for 187 children and 33% for 27 adult staff; 18 of 66 (27%) children younger than 31/2 years of age were found to have group A streptococci in their upper respiratory tracts. This is the first report of high prevalence rates of group A streptococci associated with upper respiratory tract infections in a day-care center. The group A Streptococcus may represent a significant upper respiratory tract pathogen in the day-care setting."
CD010502,0,12480897,0,Roles of the plasminogen activator streptokinase and the plasminogen-associated M protein in an experimental model for streptococcal impetigo.,"Primary infection by group A streptococci (GAS) takes place at either the throat or skin of the human host, often leading to pharyngitis or impetigo, respectively. Many GAS strains differ in their preference for throat and skin tissue sites. Previous epidemiological findings show that many of the strains displaying strong tropism for the skin have a high-affinity binding site for plasminogen, located within M protein (PAM), a prominent surface fibril. Plasminogen bound by PAM interacts with streptokinase, a plasminogen activator secreted by GAS, to yield bacterial-bound plasmin activity. In this study, PAM and streptokinase were tested for their roles in infection using an experimental model that closely mimics human impetigo. Inactivation of genes encoding either PAM or streptokinase led to a partial, but significant, loss of virulence in vivo, as measured by net growth of the bacteria and pathological alterations. The relative loss in virulence in vivo was greater for the streptokinase mutant than for the PAM mutant. However, the PAM mutant, but not the streptokinase mutant, displayed a partial loss in resistance to phagocytosis in vitro. The combined experimental and epidemiological data provide evidence that PAM and streptokinase play a key role in mediating skin-specific infection by GAS. In addition, secreted cysteine proteinase activity due to SpeB leads to degradation of streptokinase in stationary phase broth cultures. Since SpeB is also a determinant of tissue-specific GAS infection at the skin, direct interactions between these two proteolytic pathways may constitute an important pathogenic mechanism. An integrated model for superficial infection at the skin is presented."

CD010502,0,8817190,0,Community outbreak of acute respiratory infection by Mycoplasma pneumoniae.,"We present the results of the investigation of an epidemic outbreak of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection which affected 95 schoolchildren from certain village in Catalonia. The investigation took an epidemiological, clinical and microbiological approach, detecting by capture enzyme-immunoassay technique the presence of IgM antibodies against M. pneumoniae. All cases occurred over a 9 week period. The attack rate in children under five was 18% and 8.2% in those from 5-14 years. The age mean and standard deviation of the cases was 5.2 +/- 3.5 years, the range being from 9 months to 14 years. Cough was the most common clinical manifestation (87.4%), followed by fever (67.4%), asthenia (21.1%), abdominal pain (18.9%), vomiting (13.7%), earache (8.4%) and sore throat (6.3%). There was no significant difference in the distribution of symptoms according to age groups. IgM anti M. pneumoniae was positive in 36 (37.9%) of the samples analysed. Treatment chosen in most cases (90) was eritromicin and there was a correct evolution in all cases except for two clinical and radiological recurrences. Hospitalization was only necessary in 5 cases. The present findings are important to emphasize the high incidence of M. pneumoniae respiratory disease in children under 5, and suggests that with respiratory processes affecting very young children, a possible Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection should also be considered and the necessary action taken in the form of early and appropriate treatment."
CD010502,0,7029524,0,Streptococcal M protein: alpha-helical coiled-coil structure and arrangement on the cell surface.,"The conformation and molecular dimensions of purified type 6 streptococcal M proteins establish the close structural relationship of these molecules to tropomyosin. Ultracentrifuge studies reveal that the M molecules exist as stable dimers; circular dichroism spectra indicate that the molecules contain about 70% alpha helix; and fiber x-ray diffraction diagrams show the characteristic reflections of the alpha-helical pattern. Electron microscopic images of M protein shadowed with platinum reveal rod-shaped molecules having the same width as tropomyosin. However, the lengths of the M molecules are about 30% shorter than lengths predicted by assuming a completely alpha-helical molecule. These findings indicate that the structure of the M6 protein is primarily alpha-helical coiled coil. Comparison of the lengths of the fibers on the surface of the streptococcus and the isolated M proteins suggests that each fiber on the cell wall consists of a single M-protein molecule approximately 500 A long. The structure determined for these fimbriae is the first alpha-helical coiled-coil conformation to be demonstrated for bacterial surface projections."
CD010502,0,8581164,0,"Multiple phase variation in haemolytic, adhesive and antigenic properties of Streptococcus gordonii.","Streptococcus gordonii gave rise to beta-haemolytic variants (Bhp+ for beta-haemolysin production) at frequencies of 10(-4)-10(-3) on agar medium containing washed horse erythrocytes. Bhp+ variants reverted to the wild-type alpha-haemolytic phenotype (Bhp-) at the same frequencies. There was a significant probability (> or = 0.1) that phase variation in Bhp and phase variation in the previously described Spp (sucrose promoted phenotype) would occur concomitantly, but there was no correlation between these phenotypes. There was evidence also of independent phase variation in adhesion to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite (Asp for adhesion to salivary pellicles), in lactose-sensitive coaggregation (Cls for coaggregation, lactose-sensitive) and in the concentrations of particular cell surface antigens (Cap for cell antigen profile) in strains that had undergone phase changes in Spp and/or Bhp. Phase variation in all these phenotypes were transitions between high and low levels of activity and each appeared to occur as an independent event. Significant associations (P << 0.0001 by contingency table analysis) between particular phenotypes such as Bhp and Asp and between Asp, Cls and Cap phenotypes, however, were apparent. The results suggest that S. gordonii cells become predisposed to phase variation and that the resulting independent phenotypic changes may give rise to phenotypically diverse streptococcal populations able to accommodate rapid and transient environmental changes in the mouth."
CD010502,0,17002029,0,Guidelines for the use of antibiotics in acute upper respiratory tract infections.,"To help physicians with the appropriate use of antibiotics in children and adults with upper respiratory tract infection, a multidisciplinary team evaluated existing guidelines and summarized key practice points. Acute otitis media in children should be diagnosed only if there is abrupt onset, signs of middle ear effusion, and symptoms of inflammation. A period of observation without immediate use of antibiotics is an option for certain children. In patients with sinus infection, acute bacterial rhinosinusitis should be diagnosed and treated with antibiotics only if symptoms have not improved after 10 days or have worsened after five to seven days. In patients with sore throat, a diagnosis of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus pharyngitis generally requires confirmation with rapid antigen testing, although other guidelines allow for empiric therapy if a validated clinical rule suggests a high likelihood of infection. Acute bronchitis in otherwise healthy adults should not be treated with antibiotics; delayed prescriptions may help ease patient fears and simultaneously reduce inappropriate use of antibiotics."
CD010502,0,21658876,0,Molecular testing of respiratory swabs aids early recognition of meningococcal disease in children.,"Early meningococcal disease (MD) diagnosis is difficult. We assessed rapid molecular testing of respiratory specimens. We performed genotyping of respiratory swabs, blood, and cerebrospinal fluid from children with suspected disease and nasal swabs (NSs) from matched controls. Thirty-nine of 104 suspected cases had confirmed disease. Four controls were carriers. Throat swab ctrA and porA testing for detection of disease gave a sensitivity of 81% (17/21), specificity of 100% (44/44), positive predictive value (PPV) of 100% (17/17), negative predictive value (NPV) of 92% (44/48), and relative risk of 12. NS ctrA and porA testing gave a sensitivity of 51% (20/39), specificity of 95% (62/65), PPV of 87% (20/23), NPV of 77% (62/81), and relative risk of 4. Including only the 86 NSs taken within 48 h of presentation, the results were sensitivity of 60% (18/30), specificity of 96% (54/56), PPV of 90% (18/20), NPV of 82% (54/66), and relative risk of 5. Swab type agreement was excellent (kappa 0.80, P < 0.001). There was exact phylogenetic agreement from different specimen sites for individuals. Carried genosubtypes were P1.7 and P1.21-7. Prehospital rapid molecular testing of easily obtained respiratory specimens could accelerate diagnosis of MD."

CD010502,0,2384834,0,[Investigation of the bacterial flora in the tonsillar lacunae and serum levels of streptococcal antigen-specific antibodies in patients with pustulosis palmaris et plantaris].,"The purpose of this study was to clarify the relationship between bacterial flora in tonsillar lacunae and antistreptococcal antibody in sera of the patients with pustulosis palmaris et plantaris (PPP). Since the pustules develops or worsens after tonsillitis in many patients with PPP, a pathogenic role of tonsillar bacteria is suggested, but no significant association has been proven so far. In this study, the aerobes in the tonsillar lacunae were identified and quantitated in 15 adult patients with PPP and 9 adult patients with chronic tonsillitis (CT). In addition, serum streptococcal antigen-specific antibody levels in 40 adult patients with PPP, 18 adult patients with chronic tonsillitis, and 11 healthy volunteers (controls) were examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The results were as follows. 1. A total of 53 strains (17 species) of aerobes were isolated and identified from the tonsillar lacunae in patients with PPP, while 35 strains (12 species) of aerobes were found in the patients with CT. 2. S. salivarius and S. pneumoniae were the dominant aerobes isolated from patients with PPP or CT. 3. Although the rates of isolation for Staphylococcus and S. pneumoniae were lower in PPP patients than in CT patients, the rate for S. sanguis I was higher in PPP patients than in CT patients. 4. The percentage of alpha, gamma-streptococci to total aerobes in PPP patients was higher than in CT patients. 5. The IgG antibody titers against S. sanguis and S. mitis, and the IgM antibody titers against all streptococci investigated in PPP patients were higher than those in both CT patients and controls. 6. Moreover, both the IgG antibody titers against S. pyogenes T4 and S. sanguis I and the IgM antibody titers against S. sanguis I and S. sanguis II of the patients in which PPP markedly improved after tonsillectomy were higher than those in which PPP showed less improvement postoperatively."
CD010502,0,9316998,0,Natural polyreactive secretory immunoglobulin A autoantibodies as a possible barrier to infection in humans.,"Secretory immunoglobulin A (S-IgA) was investigated in human secretions for the presence of natural antibodies (Abs) acting as the first ""immune barrier"" to infection before induction or boosting of specific responses. These molecules could be the secretory counterpart of the natural Abs in serum that were previously shown by our laboratory to be polyreactive to autoantigens. Significant levels of S-IgA Abs to human actin, myosin, tubulin, and spectrin were detected in 10 saliva and 8 colostrum samples from normal subjects. Computer-assisted analysis of immunoblots of extracts from human muscles showed these Abs to react with a large number of autoantigens. Their polyreactivity was confirmed by cross-inhibition and by immunoblotting studies of affinity-purified natural Abs, assayed against a large variety of surface or secreted antigens from Streptococcus pyogenes. The thiocyanate elution method showed that functional affinities of some natural Abs can be of the same order of magnitude as those of tetanus vaccine antitoxins. Moreover, nonimmune binding of these natural Abs to the gut protein Fv (Fv-fragment binding protein) can enhance their effector functions. This demonstrates that human secretions contain polyreactive auto-Abs which can also react with pathogens. These secretory Abs of ""skeleton key"" specificities are possibly produced by a primordial B-1-cell-associated immune system and can be involved in a plurispecific mucosal protection against pathogens, irrespective of the conventional immune response."
CD010502,0,9551922,0,Expression of two different antiphagocytic M proteins by Streptococcus pyogenes of the OF+ lineage.,"All clinical isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococcus) share the ability to resist phagocytosis and grow in human blood. In many strains, this property is due to the expression of a single antiphagocytic M protein, while other strains express more than one M-like molecule, of which the role in phagocytosis resistance is unclear. In particular, all S. pyogenes strains of the OF+ lineage, representing approximately half of all isolates, express two M-like proteins, Mrp and Emm, which are immunologically unrelated. These two proteins bind different ligands that have been implicated in phagocytosis resistance: Mrp binds fibrinogen and Emm binds the complement inhibitor C4BP. Using a clinical isolate of the common serotype 22, we created mutants affected in the mrp and emm genes and characterized them in phagocytosis experiments and by electron microscopy. A double mutant mrp-emm- showed strongly decreased resistance to phagocytosis, while mrp- and emm- single mutants grew well in blood. However, optimal growth required the expression of both Mrp and Emm. Experiments in which coagulation was inhibited using the specific thrombin inhibitor, hirudin, rather than heparin, indicated that Emm is more important than Mrp for resistance to phagocytosis. Tuftlike surface structures typical for S. pyogenes were still present in the mrp-emm- double mutant, but not in a mutant affected in the regulatory gene mga, indicating that the presence of these surface structures is not directly correlated to phagocytosis resistance. Our data imply that OF+ strains of S. pyogenes express two antiphagocytic M proteins with different ligand-binding properties."
CD010502,0,2440952,0,Sequence of protective epitopes of streptococcal M proteins shared with cardiac sarcolemmal membranes.,"Synthetic peptide fragments spanning the entire amino acid sequence of pep M5 were used to detect epitopes cross-reactive with heart tissue components other than myosin. Heart-cross-reactive pep M5 antibodies were affinity purified by absorption to and elution from purified sarcolemmal membranes. Only one of the synthetic peptides, SM5(164-197)C, inhibited reactivity of the affinity-purified antibodies with pep M5 by ELISA. SM5(164-197)C linked to KLH evoked both opsonic and heart-cross-reactive antibodies in rabbits. In addition to type 5, the immune sera opsonized M types 6, 18, 19, and 49 streptococci. The antisera reacted strongly with isolated cardiac sarcolemmal membranes by immunofluorescence. In Western blots of cardiac tissue, the anti-SM5(164-197)C reacted with a 40 kDa protein but not with myosin. The reaction was inhibited by pep M5 and SM5(164-197)C but not by any of the other peptides spanning pep M5. The cross-reactive anti-SM5(164-197)C affinity purified on sarcolemmal membranes opsonized types 5, 6, and 19 but not type 24 streptococci. These results indicate that SM5(164-197)C contains heart-cross-reactive, opsonic epitopes that are shared among heterologous serotypes of group A streptococci."

Kits were the; QuickVue Dipstick Strep A (Sumitomo Seiyaku Biomedical Co., Ltd.), TESTPACK Plus STREP A (ABBOTT JAPAN Co., Ltd), CLEAVIEW STREP A (Nihon Schering K. K.), QuickVue STREP A (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd), ImmunoCard STAT! STREP A (TFB, INC.), DIPSTICK 'Eiken' STREP A (Eiken Chemical Co., Ltd.), Rapid Testa Strep A (Daiichi Pure Chemical Co., Ltd.), and StatCheck Strep A (KAINOS Laboratories, Inc.). Four of these kits, i.e. QuickVue Dipstick Strep A, TESTPACK Plus STREP A, Rapid Testa Strep A, and StatCheck Strep A showed sensitivity at 1.0 x 10(5) CFU/mL (1.0 x 10(4)CFU/test) with all of S. pyogenes tested, while the Anginosus group and S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis with Lancefield' s group A antigen showed sensitivity very similar to S. pyogenes. Of these strains, S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis formed a beta-hemolytic colony resembling that of S. pyogenes on sheep blood agar, and was sensitive to bacitracin. It is thus indispensable to identify the colony using biochemical tests such as the PYR (pyrrolidonylarylamidase production) test. In using rapid diagnostic kits for the detection of Group A streptococcus, it is important to rule out the possibility of Group A streptococcus other than S. pyogenes in throats. Severe invasive group-G streptococcal infections are increasing recently. Concerning S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis, it is especially important to conduct these identification tests."
CD010502,0,16358447,0,The management of infections in children in general practice in Sweden: a repeated 1-week diagnosis-prescribing study in 5 counties in 2000 and 2002.,"A diagnosis-prescribing study was performed in 5 Swedish counties during 1 week in November in 2000 and repeated in 2002. The aim of the present study was to analyse data for children 0-15y of age who consulted a general practitioner with symptoms of an infection. During the 2 weeks studied, 4049 children were consulted. Respiratory tract infections (RTI) were the predominant diagnoses, above all among the youngest children, while the proportion of urinary tract infections and skin infections increased with increasing age. Between the y 2000 and 2002, the proportion of children allocated the diagnosis streptococcal tonsillitis and pneumonia decreased (p<0.01 and p<0.001, respectively) while the proportion of common cold increased (p<0.001). Antibiotic prescribing decreased from 55% to 48% (p<0.001) for respiratory infections between the years studied. The only significant changes in type of antibiotics prescribed were the increase of isoxazolylpenicillins (p<0.001) used for skin infection and the decrease of macrolides (p=0.001). A diagnostic test was used in more than half of the consultations. Of children allocated a RTI diagnosis, 36% were prescribed antibiotics when a C-reactive protein test was performed compared to 58% in those not tested. Further studies are needed in general practice to determine the optimal use of near-patient tests in children with RTI."

CD010502,0,10882418,0,Molecular evidence for antigen-driven immune responses in cardiac lesions of rheumatic heart disease patients.,"Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) is a sequel of post-streptococcal throat infection. Molecular mimicry between streptococcal and heart components has been proposed as the triggering factor of the disease, and CD4(+) T cells have been found predominantly at pathological sites in the heart of RHD patients. These infiltrating T cells are able to recognize streptococcal M protein peptides, involving mainly 1-25, 81-103 and 163-177 N-terminal amino acids residues. In the present work we focused on the TCR beta chain family (TCR BV) usage and the degree of clonality assessed by beta chain complementarity-determining region (CDR)-3 length analysis. We have shown that in chronic RHD patients, TCR BV usage in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) paired with heart-infiltrating T cell lines (HIL) is not suggestive of a superantigen effect. Oligoclonal T cell expansions were more frequently observed in HIL than in PBMC. Some major BV expansions were shared between the mitral valve (Miv) and left atrium (LA) T cell lines, but an in-depth analysis of BJ segments usage in these shared expansions as well as nucleotide sequencing of the CDR3 regions suggested that different antigenic peptides could be predominantly recognized in the Miv and the myocardium. Since different antigenic proteins probably are constitutively represented in myocardium and valvular tissue, these findings could suggest a differential epitope recognition at the two lesional heart sites after a common initial bacterial challenge."

The presence of cagA(+) H. pylori strains in tonsil and adenoid tissues may affect clinical outcome. The aim of the present study was to determine the presence of H. pylori cagA gene in tonsil and adenoid tissues and to establish the potential association of cagA(+) H. pylori in recurrent adenotonsillitis (RAT) and adenotonsillar hypertrophy (ATH). For this aim, a total of 118 tissue samples (71 tonsil and 47 adenoid tissues) were collected from a total of 71 children: 28 cases with RAT and 43 cases with ATH. The samples were analyzed for glmM gene to detect the infection with H. pylori by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). H. pylori-positive samples were further analyzed for the presence of the cagA gene. The PCR analysis showed that 29 samples (24.6%) were positive for H. pylori. Seventeen out of these 29 samples (58.6%) were found positive for cagA; the cagA gene was detected in 12 samples of ATH and 5 samples of RAT. The presence rate of cagA gene was significantly higher (p < 0.05) in ATH patients than that found in RAT patients. These results suggest that presence of cagA(+) H. pylori may be associated with development of ATH."

CD010502,0,8058249,0,Prevention of neonatal group B streptococcal infection.,"The optimal clinical strategy to prevent neonatal group B streptococcal infection has not been established. The Maternal-Fetal Medicine Units Network assessed the feasibility of a randomized clinical trial to compare the effectiveness of two methods of prevention of streptococcal infection. The attack rates of early-onset group B streptococcal disease were estimated for the following: 1) a hypothetical program of universal prenatal screening and selective intrapartum chemoprophylaxis, and 2) a hypothetical program of selective intrapartum chemoprophylaxis based on clinical risk factors. Sample size requirements were calculated for a clinical trial to detect a significant difference in attack rates between the two hypothetical programs. Similar low attack rates using both strategies would require extremely large sample sizes to detect differences between programs. Until a satisfactory, rapid diagnostic test for intrapartum group B streptococcal carrier status is developed and clinical strategies are tested in populations with varying carriage frequencies, institutions will need to individualize their approaches to prevent early-onset neonatal group B streptococcal disease."
CD010502,0,2895221,0,The expanded spectrum of toxocaral disease.,"Among 137 members of 30 families, 6% (and 8% of those aged under 15 years) were seropositive for toxocara antibodies. In these seropositive subjects and in 84 patients known to have raised toxocara titres the commonest clinical features were abdominal pain, hepatomegaly, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, lethargy, sleep and behaviour disturbances, pneumonia, cough, wheeze, pharyngitis, cervical adenitis, headache, limb pains, and fever. 61% of patients with raised toxocara titres had recurrent abdominal pain. Eosinophilia was in many cases associated with a raised toxocara titre, but 27% of patients with high titres had normal eosinophil counts. Toxocariasis is common, especially in children, and is associated with clinical features that are generally regarded as non-specific but together form a recognisable symptom complex. Toxocariasis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of such symptoms and especially in recurrent abdominal pain, which might otherwise be labelled as idiopathic. The absence of eosinophilia does not exclude toxocariasis."
CD010502,0,20375633,0,Collagen VI is a subepithelial adhesive target for human respiratory tract pathogens.,"Bacterial engagement of specific host tissue structures can be a means of targeting a pathogen to a particular niche, establishing persistent infections and inducing invasion. In this context, primary adhesion is often the first crucial colonization step allowing pathogens to withstand the mechanical clearing mechanisms of the host. As a consequence, bacteria have evolved adhesins with the capacity to mediate interaction between microorganism and host. Here we describe collagen VI as a novel target for adherence of Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae. In upper and lower airways this collagen was distributed in the lamina propria underneath the epithelial basement membrane. Both pathogens exhibited strong affinity to collagen VI as shown by light and electron microscopy in combination with immunodetection and in vitro binding assays. For S. pyogenes this interaction was mediated by M1 protein. The presented data provide evidence for a previously unrecognized role for collagen VI in host-pathogen interplay during respiratory tract infection."

For this reason, healthcare facilities should develop policies for the diagnosis and treatment of symptomatic hospital employees, and for the recognition and management of potential outbreaks. The clinical diagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis is unreliable.

CD010502,0,9401806,1,"A comparison of the BioStar Strep A OIA rapid antigen assay, group A Selective Strep Agar (ssA), and Todd-Hewitt broth cultures for the detection of group A Streptococcus in an outpatient family practice setting.","In some studies the BioStar Strep A OIA (optical immunoassay) has yielded inconsistent results, although originally it was reported to be more sensitive than conventional culture for the detection of group A Streptococcus (GAS). The Group A Selective Strep Agar with 5% sheep blood (ssA) incubated anaerobically has been reported to be more sensitive than conventional culture in the detection of GAS. We compared the BioStar Strep A OIA GAS rapid antigen detection kit to anaerobic culture on ssA with and without preincubation in Todd-Hewitt broth (THB) for the detection of GAS. From September 1995 through January 1996, throat swabs were collected in duplicate from 75 children (< or = 18 years) and 188 adults (> 18 years) who presented with pharyngitis in the outpatient University of New Mexico Family Practice Clinic. Thirty-one (12%) of the 263 cases were positive for GAS by culture and/or broth. Compared with anaerobic culture on the ssA, with and without preincubation in THB, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the BioStar Strep A OIA were 77, 62, 22, and 95%, respectively. Compared with enrichment in THB followed by subculture on ssA and anaerobic incubation, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of direct culture on ssA and anaerobic incubation were 79, 99, 98, and 96%, respectively. All isolates were serologically grouped. The BioStar Strep A OIA is as sensitive as direct culture on ssA incubated anaerobically, but the low specificity and low positive predictive value when the OIA is used in low prevalence populations could lead to unnecessary antibiotic treatment."
CD010502,0,9519380,0,Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pyogenes group A challenge induce a Th1 type of cytokine response in cells obtained from tonsillar hypertrophy and recurrent tonsillitis.,"We have previously shown that tonsil tissue both from children with tonsillar hypertrophy and recurrent tonsillitis is colonized and invaded by Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pyogenes group A. In order to evaluate if these bacteria are involved in the immunopathogenesis of these two conditions, tonsillar cells from both groups were stimulated in vitro with intact, heat-inactivated H. influenzae or S. pyogenes A. The immunoreactivity was evaluated by assessing the induction of cytokine production (IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-8, IL-2, IFN-gamma, IL-4, TNF-beta and IL-10), which was detected at the single-cell level. All cytokines studied except IL-4 were induced in both groups after stimulation with H. influenzae or S. pyogenes A. The dominating cytokines were IL-1 beta, IFN-gamma and TNF-beta. No major differences in the cytokine pattern or number of cytokine-producing cells were noticed between the two patient cohorts after H. influenzae stimulation. Activation by S. pyogenes A bacteria gave rise to higher frequencies of IFN-gamma- and TNF-beta-synthesizing cells in the recurrent tonsillitis group. The incidence of CD4-, CD8-positive T cells and CD40-positive B cells was comparable between the two groups while the MAC-387-positive macrophages were significantly higher in the recurrent tonsillitis groups. In conclusion, a Th1 type of cytokine response was found in both groups following stimulation with H. influenzae or S. pyogenes A."
CD010502,0,20094974,0,Compliance with group B streptococcus testing prior to labor and delivery.,"We tested whether group B streptococcus (GBS) screening is performed as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and evaluated the need for a rapid GBS test for women with full-term pregnancies. A retrospective cohort analysis at a single, large academic institution was performed. Women who delivered full-term (>37 weeks) infants and had documented prenatal care were included. The primary outcome was documented screening. One hundred sixty-five full-term pregnancies were included; 158 women [95.76%; 95% confidence interval (CI), 92.68 to 98.83%] were screened prior to presentation at labor and delivery. This frequency was significantly greater than the a priori hypothesis of 90% ( P = 0.01). Of the 158 women ever screened, 15 had GBS bacteriuria and 143 had genital culture performed. However, only 118 of the 143 (80.61%; 95% CI, 74.57 to 86.64%) were cultured at the appropriate time as recommended by the CDC (between 35 and 37 weeks). This screening frequency was significantly lower than the a priori hypothesis of 90% ( P < 0.001). Most full-term women presenting to labor and delivery have been screened for GBS. However, screening performed at the appropriate gestational age per CDC recommendations was lower than expected. Rapid GBS testing does not appear to be necessary for this population."
CD010502,0,10811869,0,"The streptococcal superantigen SMEZ exhibits wide allelic variation, mosaic structure, and significant antigenic variation.","The frequencies of the newly identified streptococcal superantigen genes smez, spe-g, and spe-h were determined in a panel of 103 clinical isolates collected between 1976 and 1998 at various locations throughout New Zealand. smez and spe-g were found in every group A Streptococcus (GAS) isolate, suggesting a chromosomal location. The spe-h gene was found in only 24% of the GAS isolates and is probably located on a mobile DNA element. The smez gene displays extensive allelic variation and appears to be in linkage equilibrium with the M/emm type. 22 novel smez alleles were identified from 21 different M/emm types in addition to the already reported alleles smez and smez-2 with sequence identities between 94. 5 and 99.9%. Three alleles are nonfunctional due to a single base pair deletion. The remaining 21 alleles encode distinct SMEZ variants. The mosaic structure of the smez gene suggests that this polymorphism has arisen from homologous recombination events rather than random point mutation. The recently resolved SMEZ-2 crystal structure shows that the polymorphic residues are mainly surface exposed and scattered over the entire protein. The allelic variation did not affect either Vbeta specificity or potency, but did result in significant antigenic differences. Neutralizing antibody responses of individual human sera against different SMEZ variants varied significantly. 98% of sera completely neutralized SMEZ-1, but only 85% neutralized SMEZ-2, a very potent variant that has not yet been found in any New Zealand isolate. SMEZ-specific Vbeta8 activity was found in culture supernatants of 66% of the GAS isolates, indicating a potential base for the development of a SMEZ targeting vaccine."
CD010502,0,3106411,0,"Density profile of group B streptococci, type III, and its possible relation to enhanced virulence.","The buoyant densities of virulent and colonizing group B streptococci, type III, were determined by centrifugation of bacteria on a linear, hypotonic density gradient. A total of 28 strains were investigated. Eleven strains were obtained from blood cultures of babies with early-onset disease, and eight strains were isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid of babies with late-onset septicemia and meningitis. Nine colonizing strains were genital isolates from pregnant women subsequently giving birth to healthy children. In each strain the buoyant density was determined before and after neuraminidase treatment. All strains showed an increase in the buoyant density after enzymatic removal of sialic acid, and the density differences before and after desialylation were calculated. The mean values of these differences for blood, cerebrospinal fluid, and colonizing isolates were 23.4, 25.3, and 10.6 mg/ml, respectively. The mean value for the colonizing strains differed significantly from the mean value for each group of virulent strains. All colonizing strains banded singly in the gradient, whereas five of the virulent strains divided into two density populations. Extracts of the low-density cells produced markedly more dense immunoprecipitates with type antiserum than did extracts of the high-density bacteria. One double-banding strain was positive for R protein. After separation of the two density populations, this antigen was detected only in the low-density population. The results indicate that bacterial buoyant density is inversely related to the amount of capsular polysaccharide enveloping the cell and that a determination of the density profile of the bacteria may be used for discriminating strains with an increased pathogenic potential."
CD010502,0,7699040,0,Sensitivity and specificity of rapid diagnostic tests for detection of group B streptococcal antigen in bacteremic neonates.,"Latex particle agglutination (LPA) testing for antigen to group B streptococcus (GBS) has been useful in the diagnosis of GBS sepsis in newborns. However, recent reports have demonstrated that the sensitivity of LPA assays may be as low as 27 to 54%. The purposes of the present study were to directly compare the abilities of four urine antigen assays to detect GBS antigen with clinical urine samples from neonates with GBS bacteremia and to evaluate the effect of the urine concentration on the sensitivities and specificities of these assays. Urine samples were collected serially from neonates with blood cultures positive for GBS or on admission from healthy full-term infants. One milliliter of urine was removed, and the remainder was concentrated to a volume of 1 ml. Unconcentrated samples were serially diluted with normal saline and were assayed to determine the highest dilution which would produce a positive test result. The Wellcogen, Bactigen, and Directigen LPA tests and ICON immunoassay were directly compared by using concentrated and unconcentrated urine specimens and urine specimens with known titers. A total of 94 urine specimens, including 61 concentrated and 75 unconcentrated specimens, from bacteremic infants were available for sensitivity testing, and 220 urine specimens from uninfected infants were available for specificity testing. There were significant differences in sensitivity among the four assays when they were performed on concentrated urine specimens, as follows: Directigen, 98%; Bactigen, 92%; ICON, 89%; Wellcogen, 68%. When the assays were performed on unconcentrated urine specimens, the Directigen (84%) and Bactigen (76%) assays were each significantly more sensitive than the ICON (59%) or Wellcogen (43%) assay. All four assays were significantly more sensitive in detecting GBS antigen in concentrated than in unconcentrated urine. The Directigen assay detected antigen in higher dilutions (geometric mean titer, 1:5) than the ICON (1:3), Bactigen (1.2), or Wellcogen (1:1) assay. The specificity was 99.5% for all four assays when concentrated urine was used and for the Bactigen, Directigen, and ICON assays when unconcentrated urine was used; the Wellcogen assay was 100% specific when unconcentrated urine was used. We conclude that there are significant differences in sensitivity but not specificity among the commercially available assays for the detection of GBS antigenuria when concentrated and unconcentrated urine specimens are tested. These differences in sensitivity may affect the abilities of clinicians to accurately diagnose GBS sepsis before culture results are available."

CD010502,0,16687865,0,Evaluation of simplified DNA extraction methods for emm typing of group A streptococci.,"Simplified methods of DNA extraction for amplification and sequencing for emm typing of group A streptococci (GAS) can save valuable time and cost in resource crunch situations. To evaluate this, we compared two methods of DNA extraction directly from colonies with the standard CDC cell lysate method for emm typing of 50 GAS strains isolated from children with pharyngitis and impetigo. For this, GAS colonies were transferred into two sets of PCR tubes. One set was preheated at 94 degrees C for two minutes in the thermal cycler and cooled while the other set was frozen overnight at -20 degrees C and then thawed before adding the PCR mix. For the cell lysate method, cells were treated with mutanolysin and hyaluronidase before heating at 100 degrees C for 10 minutes and cooling immediately as recommended in the CDC method. All 50 strains could be typed by sequencing the hyper variable region of the emm gene after amplification. The quality of sequences and the emm types identified were also identical. Our study shows that the two simplified DNA extraction methods directly from colonies can conveniently be used for typing a large number of GAS strains easily in relatively short time."

Clinical isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 92), Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 24), and Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 10) were collected, and comparisons were made with the routine manual methods used in our microbiology laboratory for ID and susceptibility testing. ID concordance with manual methods was 85.9%, 95.8%, and 90.0% for S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, and S. agalactiae, respectively. With respect to AST concordance for S. pneumoniae and beta-hemolytic streptococci (S. pyogenes and S. agalactiae) using Phoenix and standard broth microdilution panels, overall essential agreement was 93.0% and 97.5%, respectively, whereas overall category agreement was 92.4% and 98.9%, respectively. Major and minor error rates for S. pneumoniae and beta-hemolytic streptococci were 0.5% and 0.3%, and 7.1% and 0.8%, respectively. Very major errors were not observed in this study. Mean time for ID and AST test completion was 13.6 +/- 1.6, 10.7 +/- 2.4, and 11.2 +/- 2.3 h for S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, and S. agalactiae, respectively. We have demonstrated that Phoenix ID results show high agreement with manual ID and that AST performance was equivalent to standard broth microdilution in less time."
CD010502,0,2689729,0,Enzyme immunoassay (ELISA) for the detection of anticarbohydrate antibodies in rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease.,"Antibodies to group A streptococcal polysaccharide were estimated in the following groups of patients: (I) Patients with uncomplicated streptococcal pharyngitis: 10 patients, followed up for 3 months. (II) Patients with acute rheumatic fever: 8 patients with first attack followed up for one year. (III) Patients with reactivated rheumatic heart disease: 10 patients, followed up for one year. (IV) Patients with chronic rheumatic heart disease: followed up for one year. (V) normal controls without any history of sore throat/fever/vaccination/rheumatic disease: 10 patients followed up for one year. Group (I) patients did not show any significant elevation in anticarbohydrate antibodies by both ELISA and RIA. In the case of (III) and (IV), antibody levels were significantly higher as compared to group (V) and remained so till one year of follow up. In group (II) patients there was no significant rise in antibody levels. There was a good correlation between the ELISA and RIA used to detect the antibody levels. These findings suggest that the use of ELISA to detect anticarbohydrate antibody can be of help in diagnosing cases of rheumatic heart disease (both acute and chronic RHD)."
CD010502,0,16912949,0,Different preparations of intravenous immunoglobulin vary in their efficacy to neutralize streptococcal superantigens: implications for treatment of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome.,Eight different batches of intravenous immunoglobulin from 3 different manufacturers were tested for neutralizing activities against all currently known streptococcal superantigens. Statistically significant variation among different intravenous immunoglobulin preparations (P<.0001) and between individual streptococcal superantigens (P<.0001) was observed. These results might be helpful for optimizing the type and dose of intravenous immunoglobulin used in adjunctive therapy for severe invasive streptococcal disease.
CD010502,0,2194273,0,Polyvalent group B streptococcal immune globulin for intravenous administration: overview.,"Immunoglobulin therapy is becoming an important modality for the prevention and treatment of bacterial and viral infection. Standard intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is made from large pools of plasma obtained from normal blood donors. However, lot-to-lot variation in titers of antibody to specific microbial pathogens may diminish therapeutic efficacy. Since group B Streptococcus (GBS) is an important neonatal pathogen, a preparation with high titers of activity against GBS was prepared and studied. Plasma was obtained from volunteers immunized with a polyvalent GBS vaccine and was processed by the Swiss Red Cross for intravenous infusion. This high-titered GBS intravenous immunoglobulin (GBS-IVIG) was shown to be superior both in vitro and in vivo to standard IVIG. GBS-IVIG provided protection when therapy was delayed for up to 24 hours after infection. Standard IVIG did not protect animals against all GBS strains. However, GBS-IVIG enhanced survival from infection with all strains tested, even when the challenge dose of GBS was increased by 2 log units. Specific hyperimmune globulins to pathogens such as Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae have also been studied. Immunization of adult volunteers as a means of obtaining hyperimmune globulin appears to be an effective method of producing high-titered pathogen-specific preparations of IVIG."

CD010502,0,20458278,0,Molecular mimicry between streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin B and endothelial cells.,"Molecular mimicry between group A streptococcus and host antigens has important roles in the development of post-streptococcal sequelae, including glomerulonephritis and rheumatic heart disease (RHD). The etiology of RHD involves host cross-reactivity with M proteins and carbohydrate antigens. In this study, we show that anti-streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin B (SPE B) antibodies exhibited characteristics of autoantibodies, which cross-react with endothelial cells. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) deposition and complement activation were observed in the heart valve of SPE B-immunized mice. In addition, apoptosis in the heart valve was detected in SPE B-immunized mice. An anti-SPE B monoclonal antibody (mAb) 10G showed cross-reactivity with human microvascular endothelial (HMEC-1) cells and mouse valve endothelial cells. Passive immunization with mAb 10G also caused IgG deposition, complement activation, and apoptotic cell death in the mouse heart valve. We conducted peptide array and ELISA using synthetic peptides to identify the SPE B antigenic epitope recognized by mAb 10G. Results showed that the major epitope of mAb 10G is localized to amino-acid residues 296-310 of SPE B (P7-8). The cross-reactivity of mAb 10G with endothelial cells was inhibited using P7-8 peptides for competition. These results suggest that anti-SPE B antibodies cross-react with endothelial cells, and that a dominant epitope is located within the amino-acid residues 296-310 of SPE B. Moreover, we found that mAb 10G can also bind to N-acetyl-β-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc) conjugated with bovine serum albumin (BSA), but not to BSA or M1 protein. Competition assay showed that the binding activity of mAb 10G with GlcNAc-BSA and P7-8 of SPE B was inhibited by pretreatment with GlcNAc-BSA or P7-8 peptides. Therefore, our results suggest that conformational molecular mimicry may exist between SPE B and GlcNAc."
CD010502,0,21925735,0,The deficient cleavage of M protein-bound IgG by IdeS: insight into the escape of Streptococcus pyogenes from antibody-mediated immunity.,"IdeS (IgG-degrading enzyme of Streptococcus pyogenes) is a virulence factor for S. pyogenes, group A Streptococcus (GAS). IdeS is believed to allow GAS to evade antibody-mediated phagocytosis by cleaving IgG at the lower hinge region. Human immunoglobulins bind to the GAS surface by two mechanisms: Specific antibodies attach at the Fab region to their specific antigens on the bacterial surface. Immunoglobulins can also attach nonspecifically at the Fc region to streptococcal M and M-like proteins. This phenomenon is believed to form the host-like coat and to block the recognition of Fc region by Fc receptor on phagocytes and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. It is not known whether IdeS preferentially cleaves IgG attached at the Fab or Fc regions. To explore this issue, we used Sepharose beads coated with protein A or L or M protein as surrogate markers for specific (Fab) and nonspecific (Fc) binding sites. We found that IdeS cleaved Fab-bound IgG as rapidly as soluble IgG. In contrast, Fc-bound IgG was cleaved about 4 fold less than soluble IgG. In a competitive binding assay, we found that M protein had a greater affinity than IdeS to attach to the Fc region of human IgG. Thus, IdeS exhibited preferential IgG endopeptidase activity for Fab-bound IgG while allowing the non-specific binding of IgG to remain attached to M protein. We propose that this preferential enzymatic activity accounts for the ability of GAS to resist immunoglobulin-mediated phagocytosis and cytotoxicity."
CD010502,0,11705914,0,Group A streptococci bind to mucin and human pharyngeal cells through sialic acid-containing receptors.,"The first step in the colonization of group A streptococci (Streptococcus pyogenes) is adherence to pharyngeal epithelial cells. Prior to adherence to their target tissue, the first barrier that the streptococci encounter is the mucous layer of the respiratory tract. The present study was undertaken to characterize the interaction between mucin, the major glycoprotein component of mucus, and streptococci. We report here that S. pyogenes is able to bind to bovine submaxillary mucin in solid-phase microtiter plate assays. Western blots probed with (125)I-labeled mucin and a panel of monoclonal antibodies revealed that the streptococcal M protein is one of two cell wall-associated proteins responsible for this binding. The binding was further localized to the N-terminal portion of the M molecule. Further analysis revealed that the M protein binds to the sialic acid moieties on mucin, and this interaction seems to be based on M-protein conformation rather than specific amino acid sequences. We found that sialic acid also plays a critical role in the adherence of an M6 streptococcal strain to the Detroit 562 human pharyngeal cell line and have identified alpha2-6-linked sialic acid as an important sialylated linkage for M-protein recognition. Western blot analysis of extracted pharyngeal cell membrane proteins identified three potential sialic acid-containing receptors for the M protein. The results are the first to show that sialic acid not only is involved in the binding of the streptococci to mucin but also plays an important role in adherence of group A streptococci to the pharyngeal cell surface."

Removal of the fibronectin by absorption of the plasma with agarose-immobilized gelatin abolished the attachment-promoting activity. The activity of the absorbed plasma was restored with purified human serum fibronectin. The fibronectin was found to promote the attachment of three M protein-negative, but not of three M protein-positive, strains of streptococci. Radiolabeled fibronectin was shown to bind in various degrees to all strains of S. pyogenes tested. Thus, in the absence of streptococci surface M protein, fibronectin promotes the association of group A streptococci with human polymorphonuclear leukocytes."

Furthermore, the neutralizing test using cytokine-specific antibodies demonstrated that IL-18 plays a most significant role for IFN-gamma- and killer cell-inducing ability of OK-PSA among the other cytokines tested. These findings clearly indicated that OK-PSA, an LTA-related molecule, is a main effective component of OK-432, and is a potent inducer of Th1-type cytokines by T cell and natural killer (NK) cell activation mediated by monocytes-derived IL-18, and that it may be a useful immunotherapeutic agent for the patients with malignancies better than original OK-432."
CD010502,0,3102351,0,Enhancement of the B-cell response to Staphylococcus aureus Cowan strain 1 by natural human gamma interferon.,"The effects of interferon (IFN) on the B-cell response to Staphylococcus aureus Cowan strain 1 (SAC) were studied comparatively with natural human IFN-alpha, IFN-beta, and IFN-gamma, employing equal units of their anti-viral activity. First, the response was investigated in peripheral mononuclear cells obtained from healthy individuals, and next, confirmed in cultures employing B-cell enriched populations derived from tonsils obtained at tonsillectomy from patients with chronic tonsillitis. B cells were purified by rosetting out T cells with sheep red cells followed by the removal of adherent cells on a plastic surface. The results show that the SAC-stimulated lymphoproliferative response was enhanced in the presence of IFN-gamma in a dose-related manner, at concentrations ranging from 10 to 1000 IU/ml, both in peripheral mononuclear cells and tonsillar B-cell enriched fractions. In contrast, IFN-alpha and IFN-beta did not enhance or suppress SAC-stimulated blastogenesis in either lymphocyte preparation. The enhancing effects specific to IFN-gamma were more remarkable in cultures stimulated with a suboptimal dose (0.002%) of SAC than when the optimal dose (0.005%) was employed."

To investigate if this phenomenon could be observed in a different Gram-positive pathogen, the effects of two major Streptococcus pyogenes superantigens on streptococcal secretome expression were examined. Using mutagenesis and genetic complementation, we demonstrated that neither streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin A (SPEA) nor streptococcal mitogenic exotoxin Z (SMEZ) had any consistent effect on global protein expression or on transcription of genes encoding the secreted exoproteins, DNase B, SPEB and SPEG.

CD010502,0,15797242,0,The pro-sequence domain of streptopain directs the folding of the mature enzyme.,"The cysteine endopeptidase streptopain, an extracellular enzyme from pathogenic Streptococcus pyogenes, is synthesized as a precursor containing an NH2-terminal pro-sequence. The pro-sequence of streptopain was expressed in Escherichia coli and subjected to structural and functional investigation. Heat-induced denaturation of the pro-sequence studied using circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed that it forms a compact structure and represents an independently folded domain. The isolated pro-sequence exhibits high affinity towards mature streptopain and associates with its cognate enzyme by forming an equimolar complex. Refolding of denatured streptopain in the presence of pro-sequence in vitro facilitated recovery of active enzyme. Expression of the mature streptopain in E. coli either alone, or in trans with its pro-sequence as an independent polypeptide, led to the formation of insoluble protein aggregates or functionally active enzyme, respectively. These results demonstrate that the pro-sequence domain acts as an intramolecular chaperone that directs the correct folding of the mature streptopain."

In the present work, we show that infection of human macrophages with Gram-positive pathogenic Streptococcus pyogenes or nonpathogenic Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG enhances mRNA expression of inflammatory chemokine ligands CCL2/monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), CCL3/macrophage-inflammatory protein-1alpha (MIP-1alpha), CCL5/regulated on activation, normal T expressed and secreted, CCL7/MCP-3, CCL19/MIP-3beta, and CCL20/MIP-3alpha and CXC chemokine ligands CXCL8/interleukin (IL)-8, CXCL9/monokine induced by interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), and CXCL10/IFN-inducible protein 10. Bacteria-induced CCL2, CCL7, CXCL9, and CXCL10 mRNA expression was partially dependent on ongoing protein synthesis. The expression of these chemokines and of CCL19 was dependent on bacteria-induced IFN-alpha/beta production. CCL19 and CCL20 mRNA expression was up-regulated by IL-1beta or tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), and in addition, IFN-alpha together with TNF-alpha further enhanced CCL19 gene expression. Synergy between IFN-alpha and TNF-alpha was also seen for CXCL9 and CXCL10 mRNA expression. Bacteria-stimulated macrophage supernatants induced the migration of T helper cell type 1 (Th1) cells, suggesting that in human macrophages, these bacteria can stimulate efficient inflammatory chemokine gene expression including those that recruit Th1 cells to the site of inflammation. Furthermore, L. rhamnosus-induced Th1 chemokine production could in part explain the proposed antiallergenic properties of this bacterium."
CD010502,0,10966229,0,Haemolysin-deficient variants of Streptococcus pyogenes and S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis may be overlooked as aetiological agents of pharyngitis.,"Variants of large colony beta-haemolytic Lancefield group A, C and G streptococci that are non-haemolytic or alpha-haemolytic on sheep blood agar have been detected in clinical specimens due to their enhanced haemolytic activity when grown on a new selective and differential blood agar medium containing colistin, nalidixic acid and pH 7.5-adjusted PIPES buffer (CNA-P). The large colony Lancefield group C and G isolates were identified as Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis by API 20 Strep classification and 16S rDNA profiling. The haemolytic activity of these variants on various blood agar media, including CNA-P, was closely similar to that of known streptolysin S-defective mutants of S. pyogenes and was blocked by addition of cholesterol, a specific inhibitor of the streptolysin O family of haemolysins. As haemolysin variants could be detected in large numbers in cultures from patients with clinical symptoms of pharyngitis it is suggested that they may function as primary pathogens in such infections. The high frequency with which haemolysin variants were isolated from clinical specimens during a 3-month trial (3%, 13% and 10%, respectively, of group A, C and G streptococcal isolates) indicated that a substantial proportion of streptococcal infections may go undetected if only conventional sheep blood agar media are used in clinical laboratories for the detection of beta-haemolytic streptococci. As haemolysin variants have been implicated in the development of serious streptococcal sequelae, further investigation of the full extent of their contribution to streptococcal disease is indicated."

CD010502,0,17983447,0,Selective expansion of T cell receptor (TCR) V beta 6 in tonsillar and peripheral blood T cells and its induction by in vitro stimulation with Haemophilus parainfluenzae in patients with IgA nephropathy.,"IgA nephropathy (IgAN), the most common form of primary glomerulonephritis, is recognized as a disease that often becomes worse during acute tonsillitis. Although many reports have shown that tonsillectomy is an effective treatment for IgAN patients, the immunological evidence has not yet been investigated fully. In this study, we compared the expression of T cell receptor (TCR) V beta families in tonsillar T cells of IgAN patients to those of non-IgAN patients. The reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and flow cytometric analyses showed that the TCR V beta 6 was used more frequently in tonsillar T cells of IgAN patients than in those of non-IgAN patients (P < 0.01 each). Similarly, the proportions of TCR V beta 6-positive cells in peripheral blood T cells were significantly higher in IgAN patients than in non-IgAN patients (P < 0.05). After tonsillectomy, the proportions decreased in IgAN patients (P < 0.05), but did not in non-IgAN patients. Furthermore, in vitro stimulation with Haemophilus parainfluenzae antigen, which is reported to deposit in the glomerular mesangium of IgAN, enhanced expression of TCR V beta 6 in tonsillar T cells from both IgAN and non-IgAN patients. These results suggest that TCR V beta 6-positive tonsillar T cells might be activated by H. parainfluenzae, move into the kidney through blood circulation and induce glomerulonephritis."
CD010502,0,2487781,0,Lack of specificity of Chlamydiazyme for detection of vaginal chlamydial infection in prepubertal girls.,"A 1-year prospective study was undertaken of 65 prepubertal girls referred for evaluation of sexual abuse or vulvovaginitis to compare Chlamydiazyme, an enzyme immunoassay (EIA), with culture for the detection of Chlamydia trachomatis i in vaginal specimens. Five (8%) of 65 patients were initially EIA-positive. On repeat sampling without intervening antibiotic treatment, 4 girls who were initially positive became negative and 1 remained persistently positive. Chlamydial cultures were negative in all patients. The patient with the persistently positive EIA also had Group A streptococcal vaginitis. We were able to demonstrate that some strains of Group A Streptococcus can cause a positive reaction with the EIA. Cross-reactions with other bacterial species are also known to occur. We therefore conclude that Chlamydiazyme is not specific for the detection of chlamydial infection in the vagina of prepubertal girls and, for medicolegal reasons, should not be used for evaluation of sexual abuse."
CD010502,0,21371090,0,Variation in M protein production among Streptococcus pyogenes strains according to emm genotype.,"M protein is an important virulence determinant in Streptococcus pyogenes, but the amounts of M protein in various strains of the species remain to be elucidated. To assess the amount of M protein in strains of each emm genotype, dot blot analysis was performed on 141 clinically isolated strains. Among the cell membrane-associated proteins, M protein was present in greater quantities in the emm1, 3, and 6 strains than in the other emm strains. In addition three strains, one each of the emm1, 3, and 6 types, showed prolific M protein production (M protein-high producers). These three emm genotypes are frequently isolated in clinical practice. Sequencing of the csrRS gene, one of the two-component signal transduction systems implicated in virulence, was performed on 25 strains bearing different amounts of M protein. CsrS mutations, in contrast to CsrR protein, were detected in 11 strains. The M protein-high producer strain of emm1 type carried two amino acid substitutions, whereas the other three emm1 strains carried only one substitution each. The M protein-high producer expressed its emm gene more strongly than the corresponding M protein-low producer did according to TaqMan RT-PCR. These observations suggest that the accumulation of amino acid substitutions in CsrS protein may contribute, at least in part, to the large amount of M protein production seen in several emm genotypes."

CD010502,0,14533942,0,Acute adenoviral infection of a graft by serotype 35 following renal transplantation.,"Adenoviral infections of immunocompetent patients usually present as self-limiting pharyngitis, gastroenteritis, urocystitis, or conjunctivitis. In immunosuppressed patients, development of the illness can be severe, even life-threatening or fatal, and therapeutical intervention is difficult. Previous case reports of adenoviral infections after kidney transplantation have described a symptomatology of hemorrhagic cystitis, fever, renal dysfunction, and rarely fatal systemic dissemination. Here we report on a 46-year-old female renal transplant recipient suffering from adenoviral serotype 35 nephritis of the donor organ 29 days after transplantation. In this case, the main symptoms of the adenoviral infection were high fever and progressive renal failure of the transplanted organ. At the peak of the clinical symptoms, owing to histological and immunohistochemical evaluations of a kidney biopsy, we were able to establish the diagnosis in time so that adequate therapy could be employed. Immunosuppression was reduced and modified, and a self-limiting course of the infection was observed, followed by significant improvement of graft function. Subsequent to histological diagnosis, adenoviral particles were isolated from urine and identified as adenovirus serotype 35. Adenoviral nephritis of the transplanted organ should be considered in the differential diagnosis of persistent anuria after kidney transplantation. Our case highlights the importance of applying all possible diagnostic techniques, including histological evaluation of renal biopsies."

CD010502,0,3528381,1,Effect of a rapid diagnostic method on prescribing patterns and ordering of throat cultures for streptococcal pharyngitis.,"The sensitivity and specificity of a rapid identification test for group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus and its impact on prescribing antibiotics and ordering throat cultures were evaluated in a primary care office setting. The calculated sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 82 percent, 92 percent, 76 percent, and 94 percent, respectively. Throat cultures were ordered for 98 percent of patients with acute pharyngitis regardless of the method of testing available. After use of the rapid identification test within the office, a reduction was observed in physician prescribing of antibiotics before the throat culture results were known. Physicians were more likely to initiate antibiotics immediately when rapid test results for streptococcal infection were positive and provide patient education regarding symptomatic treatment when the results were negative. The rapid identification test is an acceptable alternative to the standard culture technique in the family practice office. The rapid test was apparently responsible for the observed reduction in antibiotic prescribing and should reduce unnecessary cost and antibiotic exposure in the ambulatory setting."

CD010502,0,6515354,0,[Therapy and prevention of infectious endocarditis].,"Only 40 years ago infectious endocarditis (IE) was lethal in most cases. Due to the development of numerous antibiotics and continuous improvements in heart valve surgery, a wide range of possibilities for therapy and prophylaxis of IE are available. The prognosis depends essentially on rapid and relevant diagnosis, which should be followed by immediate and adequate therapy consisting of general measures for treatment of septicaemic disease and specific antibiotic therapy. As multiple complications may develop during IE, careful follow-up by clinical, laboratory and mechanical examinations is necessary to decide whether surgical intervention is urgently indicated or not. In case of complications such as myocardial failure, septicaemic embolism or acute renal failure, as well as septicaemia persisting for more than 72 hours in spite of antibiotic treatment, immediate valve replacement is usually indispensable. Furthermore, large vegetations found by echocardiography, or infections caused by staphylococci, gramnegative bacteria or fungi are arguments for early surgery. For most of the IE pathogens the antibiotic treatment concept is nowadays widely acknowledged. Penicillin-sensitive streptococci are treated with a combination of penicillin S and an amino-glycoside (streptomycin). If the penicillin-MBK is very low, combined treatment can usually be abandoned. In patients allergic to penicillin, treatment with lincomycin has advantages over vancomycin or cephalosporins. In enterococcal IE, ampicillin plus aminoglycoside is the combination of choice. Streptomycin has preference over gentamicin here only if the enterococci are not streptomycin-resistant. If penicillin allergy is evident, the new beta-lactam antibiotic imipenem offers a way out of the present therapy dilemma. For penicillin-sensitive staphylococci a combination of penicillin-G with gentamicin given over 6 weeks is recommended. In case of penicillin allergy, cefazolin or vancomycin may provide a substitute for penicillin. In penicillin-resistant staphylococci the combination of oxacillin or flucloxacillin with gentamicin is established. Fungal endocarditis can be treated with a combination of amphotericin-B and flucytosin. Cure without surgery, however, is rare. For the large remaining number of pathogens which are less frequently responsible for IE, antibiotic management depends on sensitivity test in vitro, as the sensitivity of pathogens may vary widely. Though not only groups of patients with high infection rates are widely known, but also the events provoking the infections, the prophylaxis of IE continues to be inadequate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
CD010502,0,1353981,0,Clinical characteristics of haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in children.,"From January 1988 to September 1989, seven patients (4 girls and 3 boys, aged 3-12 years) with haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) were hospitalised at the University Children's Hospital in Belgrade. In four patients the disease appeared as a family outbreak, the others were sporadic cases. In six patients the clinical presentation was suggestive of HFRS, as they had fever with headache, myalgia, sore throat and gastrointestinal illness followed by renal abnormalities. However, severe haemorrhagic syndrome with petechia, haematoma, haematemesis and melaena was present in one patient only. Renal disease presented as nephritic syndrome and/or acute renal failure. Five patients recovered after 2-3 weeks without sequellae, one patient had decreased renal function 17 months after the start of the disease and the remaining patient died. In six patients the diagnosis of HFRS was confirmed serologically by a significant rise in antibody titres against hantaviruses, while in the patient with the fetal and fulminant course of the disease, the diagnosis was established on the basis of epidemiological and autopsy findings. We suggest that children living in endemic areas who develop an ill-defined, febrile and gastrointestinal disease with renal dysfunction should be evaluated for HFRS."
CD010502,0,15056382,0,The interaction of streptococcal inhibitor of complement (SIC) and its proteolytic fragments with the human beta defensins.,"Streptococcal inhibitor of complement (SIC) is a 31 kDa extracellular protein produced by a few highly virulent strains of Streptococcus pyogenes (in particular the M1 strain). It has been shown additionally to inhibit four further components of the mucosal innate response-lysozyme, secretory leucocyte proteinase inhibitor, human alpha-defensin 1 and the cathelicidin LL-37 which are all bactericidal against Group A Streptococci (GAS). We now show that SIC also inhibits variably the antibacterial action of hBD-1, -2 and -3. By enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), SIC binds strongly to hBD-2 and hBD-3, but not at all to hBD-1. Investigation of the antimicrobial action of beta-defensins hBD-1, -2 and -3 against GAS in two different buffer systems shows that both the killing efficiencies of all three defensins, and the binding of SIC to them, occurs more efficiently in 10 mm Tris buffer than in 10 mm phosphate. The lower ionic strength of the Tris buffer may underlie this effect. hBD-1 kills the M1 strain of GAS only in 10 mm Tris, but is able to kill an M6 (SIC negative) strain in 10 mm phosphate. The inhibition of hBD-3 by SIC is clearly of physiological relevance, that of hBD-2 is likely to be so, but the inhibition of hBD-1 occurs only at lower ionic strength than is likely to be encountered in vivo. Elastase digestion of SIC yields three major fragments of MW 3.843 kDa comprising residues 1-33 (fragment A); 10.369 kDa comprising residues 34-126 (fragment B); and MW 16.487 kDa, comprising residues 127-273 (fragment C). By ELISA, only fragment B binds to hBD-2 and hBD-3 and this may indicate the inhibitory portion of the SIC molecule."
CD010502,0,10443506,0,The protective effect of breast feeding in relation to sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS): III. Detection of IgA antibodies in human milk that bind to bacterial toxins implicated in SIDS.,"Two toxin-producing bacteria implicated in sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) are Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium perfringens. Epidemiological studies have shown that breast feeding reduces an infant's risk of SIDS. This protective effect could be due partly to IgA antibodies to these toxins in human milk. The aim of this work was to use a quantitative ELISA to determine levels of IgA antibodies that bound to toxic shock syndrome toxin (TSST-1), staphylococcal enterotoxin C (SEC) and C. perfringens enterotoxin A (CEA) in individual samples of human milk. All samples of milk tested contained IgA antibodies that bound to the bacterial toxins. For individual samples, IgA bound to TSST-1, SEC and CEA were in the range of 900-3100 ng ml(-1), 1000-3600 ng ml(-1) and 1000-4300 ng ml(-1) respectively. Isolation of S. aureus from mothers donating breast milk samples was used to determine if the presence of bacteria affected IgA levels which bound TSST-1 and SEC. For 3/5 samples with levels above the upper limit of the standard deviation (2375 ng ml(-1)) for IgA bound to TSST-1, S. aureus was isolated from the mother whilst 4/5 samples found to contain levels above the upper limit of the standard deviation (2627 ng ml(-1)) for IgA bound to SEC, had S. aureus isolated from the mother. In conclusion, if bacterial toxins do play a role in precipitating a SIDS death, the presence of IgA antibodies to toxins in breast milk, but not in infant formula, might contribute to the protective effect of breast feeding in relation to SIDS."
CD010502,0,3885219,0,Relationship of M protein genes in group A streptococci.,"The M protein of group A streptococci is considered one of the primary virulence determinants of this organism because it prevents phagocytosis. All of the 56 different M protein types of group A streptococci tested contain a DNA region that hybridizes with a labeled probe consisting of DNA encoding the type 6 M protein (emm6 gene). In addition, 2 of 3 functionally M- group A strains (strains that are successfully phagocytized) also contain this gene, but this DNA is not present in 1 M- strain. Of the other streptococcal groups, only groups C and G, which are closely related to group A, contain DNA that hybridizes with emm6. None of the non-streptococcal Gram-positive bacteria tested contains emm6-related DNA. In the strain from which emm6 was cloned, there appears to be only a single copy of this gene."

CD010502,0,8223526,0,Decreased salivary immunoglobulin A secretion rate after intense interval exercise in elite kayakers.,"Endurance athletes have been shown to suffer a high incidence of upper respiratory tract infection (URTI; e.g. colds, sore throat) during intense training and after competition. Previous studies have shown that concentrations of secretory immunoglobulin A (IgA), the major effector of host defense against micro-organisms causing URTI, decrease after intense endurance exercise. Many athletes perform intense interval exercise as part of their normal training. The purpose of this study was to determine whether salivary IgA concentrations also decrease after intense interval exercise during the normal training regime in elite athletes. Timed saliva samples were obtained from eight elite male kayakers immediately before and after three on-water training sessions during a 3-week period. The concentrations of IgA, IgG and IgM were determined separately by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and secretion rates calculated for each Ig. The IgA secretion rate (micrograms.min-1) decreased 27%-38% after all three training sessions (P = 0.007); the largest decrease (38%) was noted after the most intense session at the end of an especially intense week of training. The IgA concentration relative to total protein (micrograms.mg protein-1) was significantly lower (P < 0.05) on this training day compared with the other 2 days. Concentrations and secretion rates of IgG and IgM did not change after exercise, indicating a specific effect on IgA. These data would suggest that, in elite athletes, IgA concentration and secretion rate are reduced by intense interval exercise, and that exercise-induced changes in IgA output may be one mechanism contributing to URTI in elite athletes."

CD010502,0,12969551,0,A highly sensitive immuno-PCR assay for detecting Group A Streptococcus.,"A highly sensitive hybrid assay, based on immuno polymerase chain reaction (immuno-PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) techniques, was developed for the detection of pathogenic Group A Streptococcus (Strep A). Cells were disrupted by sonication and then coated onto the walls of Maxisorp microtiter plates. Next, biotinylated anti-Group A monoclonal antibody (mAb) was bound to the antigen and then linked, via a streptavidin (STV) bridge, to biotinylated reporter DNA. After extensive washing, the denatured reporter DNA was transferred to PCR tubes, amplified, electrophoresed, and used as the signal for detection of bacteria. The minimum detection limit of this assay is the equivalent of approximately one one-thousandth of a Streptococcus pyogenes cell, even in the presence of 100,000 Escherichia coli cells. The combination of multiple antigens per cell and PCR amplification provides the extreme sensitivity in this immuno-PCR assay. No cross-reaction was found with other Streptococcus species. We also directly linked the anti-Group A monoclonal antibody to DNA using succinimidyl 4-[N-maleimidomethyl]-cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (SMCC). The sensitivity using directly linked antibody-reporter DNA was approximately 10 cells. Because this assay could be adapted for detection of many different bacteria in a variety of sample types, we tested the potential for interference from substances that could be present in clinical, food, and environmental samples. Sonicated meat or human plasma did not inhibit detection; however, extracts of concentrated soil samples were somewhat inhibitory. This highly specific, sensitive, and robust assay could be applied to clinical detection of Group A Streptococcus and serves as a model for other immuno-PCR assays."
CD010502,0,10955699,0,Prenatal immune priming with helminth infections: parasite-specific cellular reactivity and Th1 and Th2 cytokine responses in neonates.,"The present investigation aimed to determine to what extent maternal helminth infection primes parasite-specific cellular responsiveness in neonates. Umbilical cord mononuclear blood cells (UCBC) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from mothers proliferated in response to mitogenic stimulation with concanavalin A, as well as to bacterial Streptococcus pyogenes-derived (streptolysin O) and helminth-specific antigens of Necator americanus and Onchocerca volvulus. Cellular responses to Echinococcus multilocularis (Em) and Oesophagostomum bifurcum (Oes), helminth parasites not endemic in the study area, were absent (for Em) or very low (for Oes due to antigenic cross-reactivity). Cellular responsiveness to mitogen and antigens was higher in mothers than in their neonates. Several Th1-type (IL-2, IL-12, and IFN-gamma) and Th2-type (IL-5 and IL-10) cytokines were produced by UCBC from neonates and PBMC from mothers. Low levels of IFN-gamma were elicited by UCBC in response to helminth and bacterial antigens, while secretion of IL-2 was pronounced and similarly high in neonates and their mothers. Amounts of IL-5 produced by UCBC in response to bacterial SL-O and mitogenic stimulation (PHA) were low, but equivalent levels of IL-5 were induced by intestinal helminth and filaria-derived antigens in neonates and mothers. A pronounced production of IL-10 and IL-12 by UCBC was observed--spontaneous IL-10 and IL-12 secretion by UCBC was higher in neonates than by PBMC from mothers. Net amounts of IL-10 elicited by helminth antigens were similar, while net IL-12 in response to mitogen, and bacterial and helminth antigens was significantly higher in mothers than their offspring. Our results indicate that human maternal helminth infection does sensitize in utero for parasite-specific cellular responsiveness in offspring, and also activates specific production of several cytokines, and such children do not present a dominant expression of immunity of either Th1 or Th2."

CD010502,0,15816147,0,A boarding school outbreak of pertussis in adolescents: value of laboratory diagnostic methods.,"Culture for Bordetella pertussis (B. pertussis) is the traditional gold standard for laboratory diagnosis of pertussis but is insensitive, especially later in the course of illness and in vaccinated persons. Interpretation of serology is limited by the lack of an appropriate reference standard. An outbreak of pertussis in a crowded boarding-school dormitory allowed evaluation of laboratory correlates of infection. Questionnaires, serum samples and throat swabs were collected from members of the exposed group. Serum samples from unexposed controls of a similar age group were used for comparison. B. pertussis PCR was performed on throat swabs, and sera were tested for IgA antibodies against whole-cell (WC) B. pertussis antigen and IgG antibodies to pertussis toxin (PT). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention definition for pertussis was used to define clinical cases. We evaluated the use of a previously published cut-off for PT IgG of 125 EIA units (EU)/ml. Completed questionnaires were obtained from 115 students, of whom 85 (74%) reported coughing symptoms, including 32 (28%) who met the clinical case definition for pertussis. B. pertussis was detected by PCR in 17 (15%) and WC IgA in 22 (19%) students; neither correlated with symptoms, but dormitory of residence strongly predicted PCR status. The mean PT IgG geometric mean concentration, in this situation of high pertussis exposure, correlated with severity of symptoms and was significantly higher in both symptomatic and asymptomatic children exposed during the outbreak (P < 0.001) than in control children. A cut-off for PT IgG of 125 EU/ml was too high in an outbreak situation to be sensitive enough to identify pertussis cases. A case of pertussis in a crowded boarding-school dormitory resulted rapidly in an outbreak. Serology and PCR were useful in identifying the outbreak and commencing disease control measures. The use of serology has mostly been evaluated in community serosurveys, where it is not possible to determine if immunity reflects vaccination, asymptomatic disease or symptomatic disease. This outbreak gave us the opportunity to evaluate the value of serology and PCR in the presence of confirmed exposure to pertussis."
CD010502,0,2200381,1,Effects of a rapid antigen test for group A streptococcal pharyngitis on physician prescribing and antibiotic costs.,"Decision analysis and opinion survey suggest that introduction of rapid antigen detection tests should decrease the number of patients with negative test results for group A streptococcal pharyngitis treated by antibiotics. We reviewed all cases in which a test for group A streptococcal pharyngitis was performed during the last 7 months of culture diagnosis and the first 7 months of antigen test diagnosis at an inner city community health center, recording culture or antigen test results, whether antibiotics were prescribed, and patient status (as regular health center patients or patients referred to the center). Positive rates for culture and antigen-test periods were similar (10% and 12%), but 53% of patients with negative culture were treated, where only 32% of patients with negative antigen-test results received prescriptions. Significant reductions in the treatment of patients with negative test results were found in both patient-status subpopulations: health center patients, 43% to 29%; referred patients, 91% to 52%. Among health center patients reductions were consistent for both adult (30% to 21%) and child and adolescent (55% to 45%) age groups. For all patients with negative test results, direct costs of diagnostic reagents and antibiotic prescriptions fell from $3.58 per patient with culture to $3.45 with antigen testing; the $0.13 savings per patient was due to less treatment of referred patients. Thus, rapid antigen testing led to (1) significantly fewer patients with negative test results receiving antibiotic prescriptions; and, (2) savings in antibiotic costs offsetting reagent cost of antigen detection diagnosis."

This is an improved modification of the indirect hemagglutination test which utilizes an unstable reagent prepared with fresh blood cells. Two types of bacterial antigens represented by extracellular products and purified streptolysin O were assayed, but only the former antigen gave good results. Pretreatment of the bacterial antigen with 0.15 M NaOH and neutralization to pH 5.5, as well as postfixation of sensitized red cells with 0.1% glutaraldehyde at 56 degrees C for 30 min were found to be essential to give long stability to the reagent in liquid suspension, at least 9 months at 4 degrees C. A total of 564 serum samples with high, moderate and low anti-streptolysin O antibodies as determined by the neutralization assay were studied by the indirect hemagglutination test using the new reagent. The sensitivity, specificity, efficiency, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of the test in relation to the neutralization assay were 0.950, 0.975, 0.963, 0.973, and 0.955, respectively. The kappa agreement index between the two techniques was high (0.926) and ranked as ""almost perfect"".

CD010502,0,3081728,0,Antigenic composition of an endocarditis-associated isolate of Streptococcus faecalis and identification of its glycoprotein antigens by ligand blotting with lectins.,"The antigenic composition of an endocarditis-associated isolate of Streptococcus faecalis was studied by immunoblotting of whole cells and cell walls from sodium-dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gels on to nitrocellulose and detection with serum from patients and hyperimmune rabbit serum. A major envelope protein antigen of mol. wt 53 X 10(3) detected with patient's serum was also present in three urinary strains of Str. faecalis and a laboratory strain of Str. faecalis ss. zymogenes but not in Staphylococcus aureus. Other common antigens of Str. faecalis were of mol. wt (10(3)) 65, 63, 56, 49.5, 30 and 21. Two other protein antigens (43 and 37 X 10(3) mol. wt) reacted strongly with asparagus pea lectin-peroxidase conjugate indicating the presence of fucosyl residues. Other lectin-peroxidase conjugates were used to demonstrate the presence of various glycosyl residues on envelope proteins. Growth of Str. faecalis in serum to mimic in-vivo growth conditions in endocarditis infections dramatically altered the antigenic patterns. Only two major antigens of mol. wt (10(3)) 56 and 53 reacted with sera from endocarditis patients. These antigens may, therefore, be of diagnostic or protective potential."
CD010502,0,4066025,0,Role of culture conditions and immunization in experimental nutritionally variant streptococcal endocarditis.,"The nutritionally variant streptococci (NVS) are usually isolated from patients with NVS endocarditis and recently have been serotyped into three groups. In the past, studies on microbial endocarditis have not analyzed the effect of the growth medium or growth phase on the bacteria used to induce the disease in the experimental rabbit model. Therefore, in this study various bacterial growth parameters were examined, including growth in semisynthetic or complex medium to the exponential or stationary phase of growth. The 50% infective dose ranged from 3.7 X 10(5) to 8.5 X 10(6) CFU for representative strains from each of the three serotypes grown under these conditions, indicating that there was no significant difference. The role of immunization was also examined in this model using organisms grown to the exponential phase in semisynthetic medium. Rabbits were immunized with heat-killed whole cells, high titres of specific antibody were produced as demonstrated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and then the rabbits were challenged with 20- to 100-fold 50% infective dose of the homologous strain. A total of 90 to 100% of the rabbits were protected from the disease process, as shown by the absence of the organisms from the heart valve 3 days after the challenge. Rabbits immunized with the amphiphile that replaces lipoteichoic acid in these organisms were not protected from challenge, demonstrating that another surface component is responsible for adherence or colonization or both. Finally NVS were incubated with radioiodinated fibronectin, fibrinogen, or laminin to determine whether these molecules aided in the adherence of the organisms to the heart valve. Only minor amounts of these components were bound to NVS as compared with controls. Therefore, NVS bind directly to the damaged heart valve or through an unknown mechanism."
CD010502,0,3034962,0,Detection of cytomegalovirus infections in specimens other than urine by the shell vial assay and conventional tube cell cultures.,"Blood, bronchoscopy-lavage, biopsy (lung, liver, kidney), sputum, and other (cecum, bone) specimens were inoculated into shell vials and conventional cell tube cultures seeded with MRC-5 cells over a 23-month period. Of 1,472 specimens, 182 (12.4%) yielded cytomegalovirus (CMV)-positive results from 81 patients. Significantly more CMV-positive specimens were detected in shell vials (n = 154; 84.6%) than in conventional tube cell cultures (n = 126; 69.2%) (P less than 0.01). We found that 98 (53.8%) of the total 182 and 41 (42.7%) of the 96 blood specimens positive for CMV were detected by both the shell vial assay and conventional tube cell cultures. However, 56 (30.7%) of the total 182 and 31 (32.3%) of the 96 blood specimens positive for CMV were obtained exclusively in shell vials after detection with monoclonal antibody. Alternatively, 28 (15.4%) of the total 182 and 24 (25%) of the 96 blood specimens positive for the virus were isolated only in conventional tube cell cultures. Thus, although the shell vial assay was more sensitive and rapid than the conventional tube cell culture method, both systems must be used, especially for blood specimens, for the laboratory diagnosis of CMV infections."
CD010502,0,17603241,0,Disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex infection in a patient with autoantibody to interferon-gamma.,"A 54-year-old man was admitted to our hospital because of intermittent high fever, general malaise, cough and body weight loss after he had been examined and treated at the former hospital for 3 years without a definitive diagnosis and effective therapy. Bacterial examination on admission revealed Streptococcus pyogenes in peripheral blood, bone marrow aspirates and pleural effusion. Furthermore, Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) was detected in sputum, gastric juice, bone marrow liquid, pleural effusion by acid-fast bacillus culture or polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Biopsy of the neck lymph node showed multiple granulomas and the presence of acid-fast bacilli. Administration of ABPC/SBT and later CLDM resulted in disappearance of Streptococcus pyrogenes after 2 weeks. We suspected of generalized immunodeficiency that might underlie the severe bacteremia/osteomyelitis and disseminated MAC infection. We tested interferon (IFN)-gamma production of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of the patient after phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-stimulation and found that these cells produced no or undetectable levels of IFN-gamma in the presence of autologous plasma while produced almost normal levels of IFN-gamma in the presence of healthy donor's plasma. Since this neutralizing activity was co-purified in the IgG fraction, the immunodeficient state of the patient seemed to be caused by autoantibody to IFN-gamma. As far as we know, this is the first report of a Japanese case of disseminated MAC infection presumably due to autoantibody to IFN-gamma."
CD010502,0,9082815,0,Cytokine expression and production by tonsillar lymphocytes.,"Expression of various cytokines in the tonsillar compartments, and in vitro cytokine production and cytokine mRNA expression by tonsillar lymphocytes (TL), were investigated. In immunohistological analysis, a wide variety of cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-10 was expressed intensively in the lymphoepithelial symbiosis (LES). A certain number of cells producing IL-6, interferon (IFN)-gamma, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha was distributed not only in the LES but also in the extrafollicular area. A significant amount of IL-6, IFN-gamma, and TNF-alpha was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in the culture supernatants of TL cultured with streptococcal antigen, even without any mitogens. Furthermore, mRNA of IL-6, IFN-gamma, and TNF-alpha was determined by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction on the TL freshly isolated and with streptococcal stimulated antigen, whereas, production of IL-1 alpha, IL-4, and IL-5, and expression of their mRNA were not found on TL with or without streptococcal stimulation. These data indicate that tonsils are highly active immunological organs containing a wide variety of cytokine-producing cells, and suggest that IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, and IL-6 may play an important role on the immune response to bacteria in the tonsil."
CD010502,0,15766873,0,"Development of PLEX, a plasmid-based expression system for production of heterologous gene products by the gram-positive bacteria Streptococcus gordonii.","While Escherichia coli expression systems have been widely utilized for the production of heterologous proteins, these systems have limitations with regard to the production of particular protein products, including poor expression, expression of insoluble proteins into inclusion bodies, and/or expression of a truncated product. Using the surface protein expression (SPEX) system, chromosomally integrated heterologous genes are expressed and secreted into media by the naturally competent gram-positive organism Streptococcus gordonii. After E. coli turned out to be an inappropriate expression system to produce sufficient quantities of intact product, we successfully utilized SPEX to produce the heterologous antigen BH4XCRR that is designed from sequences homologous to the S. pyogenes M-protein C-repeat region. To further enhance production of this product by S. gordonii, we sought to develop a novel system for the production and secretion of heterologous proteins. We observed that under various growth conditions, S. gordonii secreted high levels of a 172 kDa protein, which was identified by N-terminal sequence analysis as the glucosyltransferase GTF. Here we report on the development of a plasmid-based expression system, designated as PLEX, which we used to enhance production of BH4XCRR by S. gordonii. A region from the S. gordonii chromosome that contains the positive regulatory gene rgg, putative gtfG promoter, and gtfG secretion-signal sequence was cloned into the E. coli/Streptococcus shuttle plasmid pVA838. Additionally, the bh4xcrr structural gene was cloned into the same plasmid downstream and in-frame with rgg and gtfG. This plasmid construct was transformed into S. gordonii and BH4XCRR was detected in culture supernatants from transformants at greater concentrations than in supernatants from a SPEX strain expressing the same product. BH4XCRR was easily purified from culture supernatant using a scalable two-step purification process involving hydrophobic-interaction and gel-filtration chromatography."
CD010502,0,10799895,0,"Human C4b-binding protein has overlapping, but not identical, binding sites for C4b and streptococcal M proteins.","Many strains of Streptococcus pyogenes bind C4b-binding protein (C4BP), an inhibitor of complement activation. The binding is mediated by surface M proteins in a fashion that has been suggested to mimic the binding of C4b. We have previously shown that a positively charged cluster at the interface between complement control protein domains 1 and 2 of C4BP alpha-chain is crucial for the C4b-C4BP interaction. To extend this observation, and to investigate the interaction with M proteins, we constructed and characterized a total of nine mutants of C4BP. We identified a key recognition surface for M proteins that overlaps with the C4b binding site because substitution of R64 and H67 by Gln dramatically reduces binding to both ligands. However, the analysis of all mutants indicates that the binding sites for C4b and M proteins are only overlapping, but not identical. Furthermore, M proteins were able to displace C4BP from immobilized C4b, whereas C4b only weakly affected binding of C4BP to immobilized M proteins. We found that the molecular mechanisms involved in these two interactions differ because the binding between M proteins and C4BP is relatively insensitive to salt in contrast to the C4BP-C4b binding. In addition, six mAbs directed against the alpha-chain interfered with C4b-C4BP interaction, whereas only two of them efficiently inhibited binding of C4BP to M proteins. Collectively, our results suggest that binding between C4b and C4BP is governed mostly by electrostatic interactions, while additional noncovalent forces cause tight binding of C4BP to streptococcal M proteins."
CD010502,0,7865118,0,[Targetted antibiotic therapy. Acute sore throat: streptococcus A update].,"Acute sore throat is a very common pathology, but should not because of this be considered as banal. In effect, the beta-haemolytic streptococcus A, which is responsible for most of the bacteriological etiologies is not only responsible for distant inflammatory complications, acute articular rheumatism (RAA) and glomerulonephritis, which are re-appearing in the United States, but also a fulminating septicemia and a syndrome of visceral failure that makes a grave prognosis for life. Moreover, today, streptococcus A is one of the factors involved in a series of fatal fasciites and necrosing myosites seen in several European countries. Understanding of these complications gives better definition of the causative immunological mechanisms and particularly the adverse role of the ""superantigens"" of streptococci in the start of an increase in the responses of immunocompetent cells and pro-inflammatory and prothrombic mediators. Finally, availability now of rapid diagnostic tests with monoclonal antibody techniques confirms the presence of streptococci A in acute sore throat and should help the physician to make an etiological diagnosis that takes into account the clinical signs. Unfortunately, these tests are not widely available in France and are not subject to reimbursement. All these factors justify the introduction of an antibiotherapy targetted at streptococcus A in the context of bacterial sore throat. Oral penicillin V (phenoxymethyl penicillin, Oracilline) is always the reference, with an excellent anti-bacterial and clinical activity and without risk of production of strains of streptococcus that are of reduced sensitivity or resistant.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Over fifteen different microbial pathogens have been or are known to be currently studied with these methods. Salient data obtained from the application of IVIAT and/or CMAT to a selection of human and plant pathogens will be summarized. This includes recent reports on Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A) in neurological disorders and invasive diseases, Xylella fastidiosa in Pierce's disease, Xanthomonas campestris in bean blight, Salmonella enterica serovar typhi in typhoid fever and Leishmania spp. related infections. Special emphasis will be given to those targets that have been further investigated for the development of novel vaccine, diagnostic and/or antibiotherapy strategies. This encompasses a new point-of-care serological diagnostic test for chronic periodontal diseases. Finally, Mycobacterium tuberculosis in vivo induced products will be described as providing a rational basis for differentiating subjects with primary, dormant or secondary tuberculosis infections, from control subjects who have or did not have prior vaccination with BCG."
CD010502,0,9364687,0,Human antibodies to the conserved region of the M protein: opsonization of heterologous strains of group A streptococci.,"A 20-mer peptide (p145) in the carboxyl-terminal region of the M protein of group A streptococci (GAS) has previously been defined as the target of bactericidal antibodies. Sequence analysis of seven field isolates from indigenous Australians living in an area highly endemic for GAS and five laboratory reference strains (encompassing nine unique serotypes plus three nontypeables) demonstrates that this region is highly conserved (sequence identity ranging from 65 to 95%) with six of the 12 sequences being identical to p145. Most of the sequence dissimilarity is contained within the last seven amino acids of p145. Competitive ELISA demonstrates that human antibodies specific for p145 cannot discriminate between p145 and synthetic peptides representing four from four of the variant sequences tested. Ig purified from endemic sera was able to opsonize each of the GAS isolates and free p145 as well as a peptide expressing a minimal conformational epitope within p145 (requiring amino acids between positions 2 and 13 of p145), but not an irrelevant peptide, were able to partially or completely inhibit opsonization of all isolates and reference strains. Thus adult endemic sera contain antibodies which are bactericidal for multiple GAS serotypes and which are specific for a sequence of 12 amino acids contained within the p145 region of the M protein."
CD010502,0,3308307,0,Evaluation of the Strep-A-Chek technique for presumptive identification of group A beta-hemolytic streptococci and group D enterococci.,"Strep-A-Check (E-Y Laboratories, San Mateo, CA) is a 15-min chromogenic test for a species-specific aminopeptidase that could replace testing bacitracin susceptibility for presumptive identification of group A streptococci as well as 6.5% NaCl agar tolerance for presumptive identification of enterococcal streptococci, with a time savings of 24 hr. Recent clinical streptococcal isolates (n = 341), identified by conventional biochemical and serologic techniques, were used to evaluate the 15-min Strep-A-Chek test. Among the beta-hemolytic streptococci (176 group A, 43 group B, 8 group C, 9 group F, and 9 group G), Strep-A-Chek was 100% accurate. Among the non-beta-hemolytic streptococci, 100% of 52 group D enterococci, 100% of 30 viridans streptococci, and 100% of 14 group D nonenterococci were correctly identified by Strep-A-Chek. Strep-A-Chek is an extremely rapid and reliable test for presumptive identification of group A and enterococcal streptococci."
CD010502,0,18837785,0,The bacterial superantigen and superantigen-like proteins.,"The bacterial superantigens are protein toxins that bind to major histocompatibility complex class II and T-cell receptor to stimulate large numbers of T cells. The majority are produced by the Gram-positive organisms Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes and are the causative agents in toxic shock syndrome, an acute disease caused by the sudden and massive release of T-cell cytokines into the blood stream. The structure and function of the superantigens has revealed a common architecture that is also shared by another group of staphylococcal virulence factors called the superantigen-like proteins (SSL). Together, this family of structurally related molecules highlights how a common pathogenic organism has employed a simple but adaptable protein to generate an armamentarium of potent defense molecules designed to target of the innate and adaptive immune response."
CD010502,0,3553828,0,Evaluating rapid tests for streptococcal pharyngitis: the apparent accuracy of a diagnostic test when there are errors in the standard of comparison.,"The evaluation of new rapid antigen detection tests for streptococcal pharyngitis is complicated by the presence of errors in the standard of comparison. Even ""gold standard"" throat cultures are not perfectly accurate. This article is an analysis of how errors in the comparison cultures affect the apparent accuracy of new tests for streptococcal pharyngitis. One of the questions addressed is whether throat cultures performed in a physician's office are accurate enough to use as a standard in a clinical trial of a new rapid test. While the accuracy of office cultures is accepted by many to be adequate for diagnostic purposes, this analysis shows that when evaluating a new test stricter conditions must be placed on the accuracy of the cultures used for comparison."
CD010502,0,3522076,0,Rapid methods in microbiology for in-office testing.,"There are now a variety of rapid test methods available to assist in the diagnosis of the three most common infectious diseases seen in ambulatory medicine: pharyngitis, urinary tract infection, and venereal disease. Before choosing to implement any of these methods, several aspects should be carefully considered. The objectives met by onsite testing should be clearly identified and the appropriate test chosen to meet those objectives. For example, if the goal is to establish a diagnosis while the patient is still available in the office, a test method that requires more than 20 to 30 minutes to perform will not fulfill the objective. Similarly, if tests must be batched for maximum efficiency, timeliness of results will be compromised. The prevalence of the specific agent or disease in the patient population should be established, as prevalence will significantly influence the predictive value of a diagnostic test. The lower the prevalence of a disease, the lower the predictive value of a positive result and the higher the predictive value of a negative result. Conversely, the higher the prevalence, the higher the positive predictive value and the lower the negative predictive value. Thus, in one setting a test may serve best as a screen to rule out disease and, in another setting, as a confirmatory test to establish a diagnosis. The impact of false-positive and/or false-negative results must be clearly appreciated to avoid diagnostic errors. The technical features of a test method should be carefully appraised. How difficult is the test to perform and what skill level is necessary to ensure the validity of results? How much quality control is necessary? How much additional equipment is needed to perform the assay, and does the equipment have multiple applications or just a single application? Finally, does the cost-benefit ratio of providing on-site testing exceed that of referring the specimens to a reference laboratory?"
CD010502,0,17446281,0,Real-time RT-PCR for H5N1 avian influenza A virus detection.,"The recent recurrence of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus A H5N1 was firstly reported in mid-December 2003 and continued through 2005. This study describes a sensitive and specific real-time RT-PCR method for the detection of influenza A subtype H5 and for monitoring virus loads. Using serial dilutions of influenza A H5N1 cultures, this assay reproducibly determined the lowest detection limit to be approximately 5 x 10(-2) 50 % egg infective doses (EID(50)). In contrast, the minimum detection limit was approximately 3 EID(50) in conventional RT-PCR with WHO primers and 10 EID(50) in antigen-capture ELISA. In tests of serial dilutions of in vitro-transcribed influenza A H5 gene RNA, there was linear amplification from 40 copies to 4 x 10(8) copies of target RNA per reaction and approximately six copies, and sometimes even as few as three copies, of target RNA tested positive in our assay. Thirty-five throat swabs from ill birds were tested: 33 samples tested positive using this assay. In comparison, 27, 13 and 19 samples tested positive using conventional RT-PCR, antigen-capture ELISA and virus isolation, respectively. To evaluate further the sensitivity of this real-time RT-PCR, a standard panel and 60 H5N1 isolates that contained different clades of influenza virus A/H5N1 were tested and all tested positive. To evaluate the specificity of the assay, 60 throat swabs from patients infected with influenza virus A H1 were tested; all were negative. Thirteen other viruses were also tested and all tested negative."
CD010502,0,14500523,0,Streptococcus pyogenes infection induces septic arthritis with increased production of the receptor activator of the NF-kappaB ligand.,"Bacterial arthritis is a rapidly progressive and highly destructive joint disease in humans, with Staphylococcus aureus and Neisseria gonorrhoeae the major causative agents, although beta-hemolytic streptococci as well often induce the disease. We demonstrate here that intravenous inoculation of CD-1 mice with the group A streptococcus (GAS) species Streptococcus pyogenes resulted in a high incidence of septic arthritis. Signs of arthritis emerged within the first few days after injection, and bacterial examinations revealed that colonization of the inoculated GAS in the arthritic joints persisted for 21 days. Induction of persistent septic arthritis was dependent on the number of microorganisms inoculated. Immunohistochemical staining of GAS with anti-GAS antibodies revealed colonization in the joints of infected mice. Cytokine levels were quantified in the joints and sera of infected mice by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. High levels of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) and IL-6 were detected in the joints from 3 to 20 days after infection. We noted that an increase in the amount of receptor activator of NF-kappaB ligand (RANKL), which is a key cytokine in osteoclastogenesis, was also evident in the joints of the infected mice. RANKL was not detected in sera, indicating local production of RANKL in the infected joints. Blocking of RANKL by osteoprotegerin, a decoy receptor of RANKL, prevented bone destruction in the infected joints. These results suggest that GAS can colonize in the joints and induce bacterial arthritis. Local RANKL production in the infected joints may be involved in bone destruction."

CD010502,0,2454473,0,Renal autoimmune epitope of group A streptococci specified by M protein tetrapeptide Ile-Arg-Leu-Arg.,"The renal glomerular cross-reactivity of the amino-terminal region of type 1 streptococcal M protein was investigated. Antisera raised in rabbits against a synthetic peptide representing residues 1-26 and a peptide from which residues 20-22 had been omitted during synthesis were capable not only of opsonizing type 1 streptococci but also of reacting in immunofluorescence tests with human renal glomeruli. The cross-reactions were completely inhibited by the immunizing peptides. By using additional synthetic peptides in these inhibition studies, the glomerular cross-reactive epitope was localized to a tetrapeptide sequence Ile-Arg-Leu-Arg at positions 23-26. A number of synthetic M1 peptides containing the tetrapeptide sequence were inhibitory, whereas the M1 peptides lacking the sequence or unrelated tetrapeptides Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser or Arg-Gly-Phe-Ser were without effect. Furthermore, Ile-Arg-Leu-Arg affinity-purified antibodies reacted with renal glomeruli, and the reactivity was inhibited by the tetrapeptide as well as by type 1 M protein. These results indicate that a renal glomerular autoimmune epitope resides in a tetrapeptide Ile-Arg-Leu-Arg near the amino terminus of type 1 streptococcal M protein."
CD010502,0,22428067,0,Minim typing--a rapid and low cost MLST based typing tool for Klebsiella pneumoniae.,"Here we report a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) based genotyping method for Klebsiella pneumoniae utilising high-resolution melting (HRM) analysis of fragments within the multilocus sequence typing (MLST) loci. The approach is termed mini-MLST or Minim typing and it has previously been applied to Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecium. Six SNPs were derived from concatenated MLST sequences on the basis of maximisation of the Simpsons Index of Diversity (D). DNA fragments incorporating these SNPs and predicted to be suitable for HRM analysis were designed. Using the assumption that HRM alleles are defined by G+C content, Minim typing using six fragments was predicted to provide a D = 0.979 against known STs. The method was tested against 202 K. pneumoniae using a blinded approach in which the MLST analyses were performed after the HRM analyses. The HRM-based alleles were indeed in accordance with G+C content, and the Minim typing identified known STs and flagged new STs. The tonB MLST locus was determined to be very diverse, and the two Minim fragments located herein contribute greatly to the resolving power. However these fragments are refractory to amplification in a minority of isolates. Therefore, we assessed the performance of two additional formats: one using only the four fragments located outside the tonB gene (D = 0.929), and the other using HRM data from these four fragments in conjunction with sequencing of the tonB MLST fragment (D = 0.995). The HRM assays were developed on the Rotorgene 6000, and the method was shown to also be robust on the LightCycler 480, allowing a 384-well high through-put format. The assay provides rapid, robust and low-cost typing with fully portable results that can directly be related to current MLST data. Minim typing in combination with molecular screening for antibiotic resistance markers can be a powerful surveillance tool kit."

CD010502,0,17319399,0,[Diagnosis and management of pharyngitis].,"Although most pharyngitis are caused by viruses, up to 75% of patients visiting for a sore throat receive an antibiotic. As the performance of clinical features is poor a throat swab may help to differentiate a pharyngitis caused by a Group A beta3-hemolytic Streptococcus (GABHS) from other causes. A recent study tested and validated a new strategy combining a rapid test detecting GABHS and a clinical score with 2 or more of the four criteria (fever more than 38 degrees, tender cervical nodes, no cough and tonsillar exsudate). This strategy is cost-effective and limits antibiotic prescription to patients with GABHS. If the score is below two, a symptomatic treatment without antibiotic is recommended."
CD010502,0,8538573,0,Superantigens and pseudosuperantigens of gram-positive cocci.,"Superantigens use an elaborate and unique mechanism of T lymphocyte stimulation. Prototype superantigen are the pyrogenic exotoxins produced by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. Many candidate proteins of bacterial, viral and protozoal origin have recently been reported to be superantigens. In most cases the evidence that these proteins are in fact superantigens is highly indirect. In this review the evidence that gram-positive cocci produce superantigens other than the pyrogenic exotoxins is critically discussed. Evidence in described demonstrating that the epidermolytic toxins of Staphylococcus aureus and the pyrogenic exotoxin B and M-proteins of Streptococcus pyrogenes are not superantigens. Criteria are described for acceptance of a candidate as a superantigen."
CD010502,0,2960774,0,Human cytotoxic T lymphocytes evoked by group A streptococcal M proteins.,"Purified group A streptococcal M proteins were used to stimulate peripheral blood lymphocytes from normal adult volunteers. The activated lymphocytes were cytotoxic against cultured human heart cells, as well as liver cells, fibroblasts, and K562 cells, but showed only minimal cytotoxicity against several animal cell types. The cytotoxic activity evoked by type 5 M protein was dose and time dependent. Rabbit antisera against pep M5 that contained heart-crossreactive antibodies partially inhibited cytotoxicity against heart cells, but had no effect on other target cells, suggesting that a fraction of the effector lymphocytes may be recognizing M protein-crossreactive cell surface antigens. All of the cytotoxic activity was recovered from a CD3+ population of lymphocytes obtained from a fluorescence-activated cell sorter, and CD4+ and CD8+ cells were also cytotoxic. M protein-responsive T cell clones were generated that showed specificity for heart and K562 cells, in addition to clones that were cytotoxic against both cell lines. Our data show that streptococcal M protein evokes cytotoxic T lymphocytes against multiple human but not animal target cells. Some of the effector cells may be specific for cultured myocardial cells, but their role in the pathogenesis of rheumatic carditis will require further studies of lymphocytes from patients with acute rheumatic fever and carditis."
CD010502,0,1444416,0,Routine procedures for isolation and identification of enterococci and fecal streptococci.,"Over the past 6 years, a revised classification of the streptococci and enterococci, based primarily on molecular techniques such as 16S rRNA sequencing and DNA-DNA hybridization, emerged. However, little attention was placed on routine physiological tests that could be used in food and clinical laboratories to differentiate between species of a new genus, Enterococcus, and fecal Streptococcus spp. The purpose of this study was to devise a convenient and reliable system to identify enterococci and fecal streptococci by using conventional procedures. Fifty-nine strains of 13 Enterococcus spp., including the type strains and many strains used by previous investigators, were characterized by using conventional tube tests, the API Rapid Strep system, and MicroScan Pos ID panels. Results were compared with each other and with previously published results. A comparison of conventional tube tests versus published tube test results yielded 17 discrepancies. Although not all tests were done with each of the three systems, 28 discrepancies between results obtained with the API system and those obtained with conventional tube tests were found. There were 24 discrepancies between results obtained with the MicroScan Pos ID panel and those obtained with conventional tube tests. There were 12 discrepancies between the results with the API Rapid Strep system and those with the MicroScan Pos ID panels. We devised flow charts of key tests that might be used to identify cultures without resorting to nucleic acid analysis and other labor- and equipment-intensive analyses."
CD010502,0,1506460,1,Rapid antibody capture assay for detection of group-A streptococci using monoclonal antibody and colloidal gold-monospecific polyvalent antibody conjugate.,"A rapid one step, sensitive and specific antibody capture assay for detection of group-A streptococci from the throat swabs of children is described. Monoclonal antibody either MA-106 or MA-107 specific for group-A streptococci polysaccharide (APS) was used as the capture antibody on nitrocellulose paper and rabbit monospecific polyvalent antibody conjugated with colloidal gold to detect the presence of antigen. The lower detection limit of this assay is 15.6ng APS/ml. The assay is specific for APS and failed to recognize polysaccharides obtained from group-B,-C,-G streptococci as well as Staphylococcus aureus. Antigen extracted from throat swabs of children who were positive for beta-hemolytic plaques (other than group-A streptococci) as seen on blood agar culture gave negative readings, thereby confirming the specificity of the assay for APS."

CD010502,0,7569776,0,Allosteric and temperature effects on the plasma protein binding by streptococcal M protein family members.,"Most group A streptococcal strains bind immunoglobulins (Ig) and fibrinogen to their cell walls. It is shown in this paper that the Ig-binding of three different strains was much weaker at 37 degrees C than at room temperature (20 degrees C), whereas the fibrinogen binding was unaffected by temperature. The binding properties and molecular sizes of two purified group A streptococcal cell surface proteins from the M protein family were studied at various temperatures, M1 protein with affinity for IgG, fibrinogen and albumin, and protein Sir22 with affinity for IgA and IgG. Both proteins appeared as monomers which bound all their ligands, including fibrinogen, very weakly at 37 degrees C, and as strongly binding dimers at 10 and 20 degrees C. Furthermore, the results demonstrated that the plasma protein binding of the bacterial proteins was allosterically regulated, i.e. the binding of a ligand to one site modulated the binding of a ligand to a second site. For example, the binding of albumin or IgG to purified M1 protein at 10 and 20 degrees C strongly enhanced the binding of fibrinogen at 37 degrees C. This indicates that the high affinity dimer form of the bacterial proteins can be stabilized at 37 degrees C, a possible explanation for the strong fibrinogen binding of whole bacteria. Finally, the sizes and binding properties of three M1 protein fragments were studied and the results indicated that the centrally located C-repeats, which are conserved among the members of the M protein family, are important for the formation of the high-affinity dimers of the bacterial proteins."

Eluted samples and unfractionated proteins were screened for T cell stimulatory activity using human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from healthy adults in proliferation assays. Responses were measured in 4- and 7d cultures. Responses to a wide range of cell extract proteins were revealed by fractionation, the degree of response to each fraction varying between donors. Unfractionated culture supernatant proteins elicited proliferative responses by PBMC from all individuals examined. Responses to culture supernatant fractions containing 25-33 kDa proteins could be attributed to known superantigens. Furthermore, samples from culture supernatants containing higher molecular weight fractions (> 45 kDa) elicited responses in 50% of donors in 7d cultures, suggesting that these fractions contained common recall antigens. The efficacy of using electroeluted samples to identify T lymphocyte stimulatory proteins was confirmed by demonstrating that a known superantigen of S. pyogenes Manfredo strain, streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin C (SPEC), could be fractionated successfully using this method and its activity recovered. Our results show that human T cell responses to group A streptococci involve a remarkably wide range of both cell-associated and released streptococcal proteins."

At least 74 alleles based on N-terminal amino acid sequence of the anti-phagocytic SeM have been observed among isolates of S. equi from N. America, Europe and Japan. A d(N)/d(S) ratio of 5.93 for the 5' region of sem is indicative of positive selective pressure. The aim of this study was to determine whether variations in SeM were accompanied by variations in the surface exposed SzPSe and secreted Se18.9, both of which bind to equine tonsillar epithelium and, along with SeM, elicit strong nasopharyngeal IgA responses during convalescence. Sequences of genes for these proteins from 25 S. equi expressing 19 different SeM alleles isolated over 40 years in different countries were compared. No variation was observed in szpse, except for an Australian isolate with a deletion of a single repeat in the 3' end of the gene. Interestingly, only two SNP loci were detected in se18.9 compared to 93 and 55 in sem and szpse, respectively. The high frequency of nucleotide substitutions in szpse may be related to its mosaic structure since this gene in S. zooepidemicus exists in a variety of combinations of sequence segments and has a central hypervariable region that includes exogenous DNA sequence based on an atypical G-C percentage. In summary, the results of this study document very different responses of streptococcal genes for 3 immunoreactive proteins to selection pressure of the nasopharyngeal mucosal immune response."
CD010502,0,22491250,0,Improvement of psoriasis after tonsillectomy is associated with a decrease in the frequency of circulating T cells that recognize streptococcal determinants and homologous skin determinants.,"Exacerbation of chronic psoriasis can be associated with streptococcal throat infections, and T cells that respond to peptide sequences common to streptococcal M proteins and skin keratins have been detected in patients' blood. To our knowledge, we have conducted the first blinded, prospective study to assess the impact of tonsillectomy on psoriasis. Twenty-nine patients with chronic psoriasis and history of exacerbation after sore throat were randomly assigned to tonsillectomy (n = 15) or control (n = 14) groups and monitored for 2 y clinically and by enumeration of circulating skin homing T cells that respond to short homologous M protein or keratin peptides. Thirteen patients (86%) showed sustained improvement after tonsillectomy ranging from 30 to 90% reduction in disease severity. Furthermore, there was a close correlation between the degree of clinical improvement in individual patients and reduction in the frequency of peptide-reactive skin-homing T cells in their circulation. No corresponding clinical or immunologic changes were observed among the controls. These findings indicate that tonsillectomy may have a beneficial effect on chronic psoriasis because the palatine tonsils generate effector T cells that recognize keratin determinants in the skin."
CD010502,0,12393652,0,Induction of platelet thrombi by bacteria and antibodies.,"We have characterized 2 distinct mechanisms through which infectious agents may promote platelet adhesion and thrombus formation in flowing blood, thus contributing to the progression of disease. In one case, the process initiates when the integrin alpha(IIb)beta(3) mediates platelet arrest onto immobilized bacterial constituents that have bound plasma fibrinogen. If blood contains antibodies against the bacteria, immunoglobulin (Ig) G may cluster on the same surface and activate adherent platelets through the Fc(gamma)RIIA receptor, leading to thrombus growth. As an alternative, bacteria that cannot bind fibrinogen may attach to substrates, such as immobilized plasma proteins or components of the extracellular matrix, which also support platelet adhesion. As a result of this colocalization, IgG bound to bacteria can activate neighboring platelets and induce thrombus growth regardless of their ability to initiate platelet-surface contact. Our results demonstrate that intrinsic constituents of infectious agents and host proteins play distinct but complementary roles in recruiting platelets into thrombi, possibly contributing to complications of acute and chronic infections."

CD010502,0,11997308,0,Acute upper airway infections.,"Upper respiratory tract infections are common and important. Although rarely fatal, they are a source of significant morbidity and carry a considerable economic burden. Numerous therapies for the common cold have no effect on symptoms or outcome. Complications such as cough are not improved by over-the-counter preparations, while labelling cough alone as a symptom of asthma may result in unnecessary use of inhaled steroid treatment. Clinical presentation of sore throat does not accurately predict whether the infection is viral or bacterial, while throat culture and rapid antigen tests do not significantly change prescribing practice. Antibiotics have only a limited place in the management of recurrent sore throat due to group A beta-haemolytic streptococcal infection. Routine use of antibiotics in upper respiratory infection enhances parent belief in their effectiveness and increases the likelihood of future consultation in primary care for minor self-limiting illness. Respiratory viruses play a major role in the aetiology of acute otitis media (AOM); prevention includes the use of influenza or RSV vaccination, in addition to reducing other risk factors such as early exposure to respiratory viruses in day-care settings and to environmental tobacco smoke. The use of ventilation tubes (grommets) in secretory otitis media (SOM) remains controversial with conflicting data on developmental outcome and quality of life in young children. New conjugate pneumococcal vaccines appear safe in young children and prevent 6-7% of clinically diagnosed AOM."
CD010502,0,2667818,0,Endostreptosin: isolation of the probable immunogen of acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN).,It is now generally accepted that acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN) is the consequence of the formation of antigen-antibody-complement complexes on the basement membrane of the glomerulus and that the antigen is of streptococcal origin. In cases of acute PSGN a high titre of specific antibodies to a streptococcal cytoplasmic extract can be found at the very beginning of the disease. This cytoplasmic antigen which we called endostreptosin (ESS) is probably the pathogenetic antigen of glomerulonephritis. It is deposited on the subendothelial side of the basement membrane in the first few days of the disease and is rapidly covered by newly-formed and specific antibody and complement with resultant immune injury causing signs and symptoms of symptomatic but also frequently asymptomatic acute glomerulonephritis. To further characterize and isolate ESS we used immunoaffinity chromatography and Western blotting techniques. PAGE analysis of the affinity-isolated ESS revealed the major component to have a molecular weight of approximately 45 kD. Sera from patients with PSGN or sera of rabbits immunized with affinity-isolated ESS reacted by Western blotting with at least one antigenic component with a molecular weight of approximately 45 kD. Normal human sera or the sera of non-immunized rabbits failed to demonstrate activity against this antigen. The basement membranes of the glomeruli of patients with very early PSGN stain with fluorescein-labelled gammaglobulin of patients with glomerulonephritis. This staining can be prevented when these sera are pre-absorbed with ESS but not by pre-absorption with intact cells or cytoplasmic extracts of other bacteria.

In this study, we report the isolation of a catalase-negative, alpha-hemolytic, optochin- and bacitracin-resistant viridans group strain, which does not grow in 10 or 40% bile, on MacConkey agar or bile esculin agar, or in 6% NaCl, from the blood culture of a 73-year-old woman with pyomyositis and poststreptococcal reactive arthritis. Lancefield grouping revealed that the strain was a group G streptococcus. The Vitek system (GPI) showed that it was unidentified, and the API system (20 STREP) showed that it was 95.7% S. dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae. 16S rRNA gene sequencing showed that it was a strain of S. dysgalactiae. Based on phylogenetic affiliation with 16S rRNA gene or GroEL amino acid (another bacterial gene, in addition to 16S rRNA gene, that is highly conserved) sequences, the strain is most closely related to Lancefield group C beta-hemolytic S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis. PCR amplification and sequencing of the streptolysin S structural gene (sagA) and M protein gene (emm) hypervariable region showed the presence of these suspected primary virulence factors. Further studies would delineate whether the isolate is just a hemolysin-deficient variant of group G beta-hemolytic S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis or a novel type of S. dysgalactiae. The present case showed that group G alpha-hemolytic S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis can be associated with serious invasive infection and poststreptococcal sequelae."

CD010502,0,7806389,0,The group A streptococcal virR49 gene controls expression of four structural vir regulon genes.,"Within a genomic locus termed the vir regulon, virR genes of opacity factor-nonproducing (OF-) group A streptococci (GAS) are known to control the expression of the genes encoding M protein (emm) and C5a peptidase (scpA) and of virR itself. Within the corresponding genomic locus, opacity factor-producing (OF+) GAS harbor additional emm-related genes encoding immunoglobulin G- and immunoglobulin A-binding proteins (fcrA and enn, respectively). The virR gene region of the OF+ GAS M-type 49 strain CS101 was amplified by PCR, and 2,650 bp were directly sequenced. An open reading frame of 1,599 bp exhibited 76% overall homology to published virR sequences. By utilizing mRNA analysis, the 5' ends of two specific transcripts were mapped 370 and 174 bp upstream of the start codon of this open reading frame. The deduced sequences of the corresponding promoters and their locations differed from those of previously reported virR promoters. Transcripts from wild-type fcrA49, emm49, enn49, and scpA49 genes located downstream of virR49 were characterized as being monocistronic. The transcripts were quantified and mapped for their 5' ends. Subsequently, the virR49 gene was inactivated by specific insertion of a nonreplicative pSF152 vector containing recombinant virR49 sequences. The RNA from the resulting vir-mut strain did not contain transcripts of virR49, fcrA49, emm49, or enn49 and contained reduced amounts of the scpA49 transcript when compared with wild-type RNA. The mRNA control from the streptokinase gene was demonstrated not to be affected. When strain vir-mut was rotated in human blood, it was found to be fully sensitive to phagocytosis by human leukocytes. Thus, the present study provides evidence that virR genes in OF+ GAS could be involved in the control of up to five vir regulon genes, and their unaffected regulatory activity is associated with features postulated as crucial for GAS virulence."

CD010502,0,14695067,0,Reduction in antibiotic prescribing for respiratory tract infections is needed!,"In general practice, approximately 25% of consultations are related to infectious diseases. The emergence and spread of resistant bacteria are related to antibiotic use on an individual and on a community level. Antibiotic prescribing differs profoundly from one European country to the next, though there is no evidence of differences in the prevalence of infectious diseases. Most respiratory tract infections are self-limiting conditions, and recent evidence shows that antibiotics only slightly modify the course of most respiratory tract infections. The general practitioner should focus on patients with more severe symptoms who might benefit more from antibiotic treatment. In general, antibiotics should be prescribed for acute pneumonia. In addition, we may offer antibiotics to a selected group of patients with more severe symptoms of maxillary sinusitis, pharyngotonsillitis and acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease/chronic bronchitis. In the diagnostic procedure, rapid tests of Streptococcus pyogenus and C-reactive protein may be valuable in carefully selected cases. Penicillins (penicillin V, amoxycillin) should be the first choice in most respiratory tract infections. Larger studies in general practice are needed to analyse the impact of antibiotic prescribing on morbidity, the occurrence of rare complications and spread of resistance. The greatest challenge will be to implement current knowledge in daily praxis."

For accurate detection of infected persons and verification of results obtained by other PCR methods, a DIG-PCR-EIA method was evaluated. In the DIG-PCR-EIA, a 437 bp DNA sequence was amplified and hybridized with a newly synthesized 229 bp biotin-labeled probe. The end product was detected by an enzyme immunoassay. The sensitivity of DIG-PCR-EIA was compared with Southern blot hybridization and one-step HR/HL PCR, which was the routine method used. DNA was detected to the level of 20 elementary bodies of DIG-EIA-PCR compared to less than 2 by Southern blot, and 200 by HR/HL PCR. Thus a 100-fold increase in sensitivity could be expected by DIG-EIA-PCR compared to the routine method. Throat swabs and adenoid tissue from 22 children with otitis and middle ear secretions from 29 children, as well as throat swabs from 179 blood donors, were analyzed with DIG-EIA-PCR, HL/HR PCR and nested touchdown PCR. 32% of the ear secretions were positive by DIG-EIA-PCR as compared to 5% by the other two methods. Three adenoid tissue samples were positive by all methods applied. Among the child and adult throat samples, 18% and 32%, respectively, were positive by DIG-EIA-PCR and 5% and 10% by HR/HLPCR. The results indicate the suitability of DIG-PCR-EIA for verification of results of HR/HL PCR. DIG-PCR-EIA has a potential for increased sensitivity and adaptation for automation. It should be further evaluated using various types of tissue specimens and DNA extraction methods."

The M protein binding site on FH is within domain 7 in which also the age-related macular degeneration (AMD)-associated polymorphism Y402H is located. We studied if FH allotypes 402H and 402Y have different binding affinities to GAS. Plasma-derived FH allotype 402H and its recombinant fragment FH5-7(402H) showed decreased binding to several GAS strains. Growth of GAS in human blood taken from FH(402H) homozygous individuals was decreased when compared with blood taken from FH(402Y) homozygous individuals. The effect of the allotype 402H can be explained by combining the previous M protein mutagenesis data and the recently published crystal structure of FH6-8. In conclusion the data indicate that the AMD-associated allotype 402H leads to diminished binding of FH to GAS and increased opsonophagocytosis of the bacteria in blood. These results suggest that the homozygous presence of the allele 402H could be associated with decreased risk for severe GAS infections offering an explanation for the high frequency of the allele despite its association with visual impairment."
CD010502,0,3546129,0,Biological and immunochemical identity of M protein on group G streptococci with M protein on group A streptococci.,"Previous evidence for the presence of an M or M-like protein on group G streptococci has been based on the ability of these strains to survive in human blood. In addition, cross-reactions between group A and group G streptococci have been demonstrated, but they have relied either on whole bacterial cell vaccine-induced polyclonal sera or crude protein extracts of these cells. In this study two monoclonal antibodies prepared against the purified, native group A streptococcal M6 protein demonstrated a high degree of cross-reactivity with group G streptococcal clinical isolates (9 and 19 of 22 strains examined, respectively). Ten of these strains exhibited resistance to phagocytosis when rotated in human blood. In addition, immunoblot analysis of crude mutanolysin extracts of group G streptococci with one of the M6 monoclonal antibodies illustrated a remarkable similarity in the protein pattern of these extracts as compared with those of group A streptococcal M protein. The immunoblots further demonstrated a variation in the relative molecular weights of the extracted proteins from strain to strain over a range of 57,000 to 77,000. In addition, a purified, pepsin-derived fragment (Mr, 43,000) from a group G strain was capable of eliciting rabbit antibodies that were opsonic for group G cells in a bactericidal assay. These functional and immunochemical data, in concert with DNA hybridization between group G streptococcal DNA and a group A M6 gene probe (J. R. Scott, W. M. Pulliam, S. K. Hollingshead, and V. A. Fischetti, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

To identify genes involved in surface expression of GBS-PGK, we performed Tn917 mutagenesis followed by quantification of PGK expressed on the GBS surface. Tn917 mutagenesis identified 4 genes (sag0966, sag0979, sag0980, and sag1003) that when disrupted, alter expression of GBS-PGK on the bacterial surface. Three of the identified genes were localized to a region of the GBS genome containing genes (sag0973-sag0977) predicted to be involved in resistance to antimicrobial peptides. One mutant isolate, designated NCS13sag1003::Tn917, was found to have increased sensitivity to the antimicrobial peptides bacitracin and nisin. In addition, all of the mutant strains assayed were found to have decreased β-hemolysis. In conclusion, we have identified genes involved in surface expression of GBS-PGK. These genes also appear to be involved in antimicrobial peptide resistance and regulate expression of the β-hemolysin."
CD010502,0,17849038,0,Fibrinogen-binding proteins of Gram-positive bacteria.,"Fibrinogen (Fg), the major clotting protein in blood plasma, plays key roles in blood coagulation and thrombosis. In addition, this 340 kD glycoprotein is a stress inducible protein; its synthesis is dramatically upregulated during inflammation or under exposure to stress such systemic infections. This regulation of Fg expression indicates that Fg also participates in the host defense system against infections. In fact, a number of reported studies have demonstrated the involvement of both the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways of coagulation; the thrombotic and the fibrinolytic systems in the pathophysiology of infectious diseases. It is, therefore, perhaps not surprising that many pathogenic bacteria can interact with Fg and manipulate its biology. This review focuses on the major Fg-binding proteins (Fgbps) from Gram-positive bacteria with an emphasis on those that are known to have an effect on coagulation and thrombosis."

Profiling was performed by use of multiplex polymerase chain reaction that screened for 9 streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins (speA, speB, speC, speF, speG, speH, speJ, ssa, and smeZ). Analysis revealed that invasive GAS isolates do not share a common toxin-gene profile. Although all emm types were characterized by several different toxin-gene profiles, a predominance of 1 or 2 toxin-gene profiles could be observed, reflecting that a few invasive clones have spread successfully throughout the world. Remarkably, statistical pair-wise analysis of individual toxin genes revealed that strains that did not share the predominant profile still showed a nonrandom distribution of key toxin genes characteristic of the specific emm type. This could indicate that M proteins function, directly or indirectly, as barriers for horizontal gene exchange."

Genomic DNA fingerprints produced by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) were compared by computer-assisted analysis. Conventional serologic M types were subdivided into PFGE types showing close genetic similarity. Among the 42 isolates from patients with invasive diseases, 16 PFGE types were identified and genetic diversity was clearly demonstrated. Identical fingerprints were observed in both invasive and noninvasive isolates. Only 43% of invasive isolates produced streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin A (SPE A), and 31% did not contain the speA gene. These findings suggest that the dissemination of a specific clone is not sufficient to explain all cases of these diseases in Japan and pose a question as to the role of SPE A as a major virulent factor. Bacterial factors other than SPE A and host factors should be considered in evaluation of the pathogenesis of the diseases."

An analysis of 57,331 patient visits for the evaluation of acute pharyngitis was conducted. In 39,530 patients with a negative rapid strep test result, nurse practitioner and physician assistant staff adhered to guidelines in 99.05% of cases by withholding unnecessary antibiotics. Of 13,471 patients with a positive rapid strep test result, 99.75% received an appropriate antibiotic prescription. The combined guideline adherence rate for groups with positive and negative rapid strep test results was 99.15%. Strep cultures were performed on 99.1% of patients with a negative rapid strep test result, and 96.2% of patients with a positive culture were treated with an antibiotic. Finally, 0.95% of patients with a negative rapid strep test result were provided an antibiotic outside clinical guidelines; however, approximately half of these prescriptions (n = 190) were supported by documentation of clinical concerns for which an antibiotic was a reasonable choice."
CD010502,0,1452335,0,Role of fibrinogen in complement inhibition by streptococcal M protein.,"M protein, the major virulence factor of group A streptococci, has antiopsonic activity in that it inhibits activation of the alternative complement pathway on the streptococcal surface. Two properties of M protein have been claimed to account for the inhibitory activity, namely, (i) its binding affinity for complement factor H, which is an inhibitor of alternative pathway activation, and (ii) its high binding affinity for fibrinogen. We have recently shown that fibrinogen, like M protein, inhibits alternative pathway activation by possessing binding affinity for factor H. Here we report that fibrinogen effectively competes with factor H for binding to M protein but retains its own binding affinity for factor H. The presence of fibrinogen did not significantly affect alternative pathway inhibition on the streptococcal surface."

CD010502,0,1746852,0,[Antibiotic treatment of pharyngitis].,"Antimicrobial therapy of pharyngitis focuses mainly on eradicating group A streptococci and treating recurrent pharyngitis. The French strategy rests on routine treatment of all cases of childhood pharyngitis; in the United-States, rapid tests are used to identify group A streptococci in the throat before treating. Antibiotics used against group A streptococci include beta-lactams and macrolides. Among beta-lactams, the reference drug is still penicillin, e.g., penicillin V for 10 days. However, numbers of carriers with positive throat cultures for Streptococcus pyogenes seem to be growing in the United States, with a 10-20% increase over the last twenty years. Duration of therapy could be reduced from 10 to 5 days with the new oral cephalosporins but these drugs are more expensive than penicillin. Recurrent pharyngitis is caused by a variety of organisms which are often penicillinase-producers. It follows that penicillin should not be used in these cases, which require oral cephalosporins or the amoxicillin-clavulanic acid combination. Maintenance antimicrobial therapy between acute episodes should be considered."

It is therefore mandatory that these tests are made available to the French practitioner. Additionally, alternatives to the classical 10-day penicillin V treatment of streptococcal tonsillitis must be seriously considered: shorter duration treatment with oral cephalosporins, macrolides or amoxicillin have proved to be as efficient and of lower cost; they are also probably safer due to a better compliance related to the shorter duration."

The stimulation was shown to be largely a general mitogenic effect rather than antigen-selective as a large panel of normal blood donors responded strongly. Further support for a non-specific stimulation was obtained by experiments with cord blood lymphocytes. An antigen-specific response could also be detected as culture supernatants from the stimulation experiments contained immunoglobulins with SLO neutralizing properties. In addition, the total response could partly be inhibited by rabbit heteroantisera against HLA-DR-like antigens supporting the above contention. The stimulatory properties were found to reside in the SLO molecule although results may indicate that the determinants provoking the lymphocyte transformation differ from the determinants possessing the haemolytic properties. Peak response was found on days 4-5. Cell fractionation experiments indicated that only T lymphocytes were stimulated although co-operating B cells and/or monocytes were necessary."
CD010502,0,2019444,0,Role of M protein in adherence of group A streptococci.,"The role of the M protein in adherence of group A streptococci to human epithelial cells was directly tested by using an isogenic pair of M+ and M- strains. There was no difference between these strains in the number of streptococcal units that adhered to buccal or tonsillar epithelial cells, indicating the following: (i) that adhesins that are not dependent upon M protein expression are present on the surface of group A streptococci and (ii) that the M protein is not the primary streptococcal adherence ligand. However, the M+ strain adhered to tonsillar epithelial cells as aggregates. This aggregation was dependent on the presence of the M protein, since the isogenic M- strain did not clump. The coaggregation of streptococci suggests that the M protein plays an important role in promoting the formation of microcolonies after initial attachment. Binding to fibronectin, a potential epithelial cell receptor for group A streptococci, was also the same for the isogenic M+ and M- strains as well as for an isogenic strain with a regulatory mutation that decreases the expression of M protein. In summary, the M protein is not the primary streptococcal adhesin, nor is it required to orient the streptococcal adhesin and/or fibronectin receptor."

In serious cases a systemic activation of the coagulation cascade and hypovolemic shock are critical complications that are associated with high mortality rates. Here we report that blood mononuclear cells, stimulated with M1 protein of Streptococcus pyogenes or other bacterial virulence factors, produce not only pro-coagulant, but also pro-inflammatory microparticles (MPs). Our results also show that activation of the contact system on MPs contributes to these two effects. Phosphatidylserine (PS) plays an important role in these processes as its upregulation on MPs allows an assembly and activation of the contact system. This in turn results in stabilization of the tissue factor-induced clot and a processing of high-molecular-weight kininogen by plasma kallikrein followed by the release of bradykinin, a potent vascular mediator. Pro-coagulant monocyte-derived MPs were identified in plasma samples from septic patients and further analysis of MPs from these patients revealed that their pro-coagulant activity is dependent on the tissue factor- and contact system-driven pathway."

A reliable and rapid species identification is achieved by serologic or biochemical tests. Direct antigen detection tests from throat swabs have broadened the diagnostic possibilities; however, they are often not satisfactory in terms of sensitivity. Typing of strains (either by classic serologic techniques or by molecular methods) is of high value for the study of clinical and therapeutic questions. In recent years, the epidemiology of the prevalent group A streptococcal strains has changed in Europe as well as in the U.S.: an increase of those M protein serotypes that are associated with higher virulence is being recognized. There is good evidence that the unexpected resurgence of rheumatic fever in the U.S. and the emerging number of life-threatening invasive and toxic manifestations of disease (including the toxic shock syndrome) in the U.S. and in Europe are related to the changing epidemiology. The existence of strains with rheumatogenic and nephritogenic potency has been established, but genetic host factors are a prerequisite for the sequelae as well. Although, based on experimental data, there are a lot of hypotheses concerning the nonsuppurative sequelae and the toxic shock syndrome, the exact pathogenesis of these diseases remains to be clarified. A thorough knowledge of the various clinical manifestations of group A streptococcal infections is necessary in order to apply the therapeutic and preventive measures in a rational and sophisticated manner. For most infections penicillins are considered the drug of choice, although no final conclusions regarding optimal dosages or the reasons for treatment failures can be made.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

In this study, the addition of M1 protein to human blood or purified peripheral blood mononuclear cells led to a dose-dependent increase of pro-coagulant activity, which was mediated by an upregulation of tissue factor on monocytes. Analysis of the resulting clots by transmission electron microscopy revealed that the cells were covered with a fibrin network that seemed to originate from the cell surface.

The samples were collected at a sentinel clinic in Japan from January through June 2003. Patients were diagnosed by clinical manifestation of pharyngoconjunctival fever (n = 38) or exudative tonsillitis (n = 100). The IC kit was positive for 84% (116 of 138) of patients diagnosed at bedside. The remaining extract solution of the IC kit test was transferred into maintenance medium and tested via laboratory diagnoses. The IC kit had 95% sensitivity (116 of 122 patients) with HAdV isolation (isolation) as the standard and 91% sensitivity (116 of 128 patients) with PCR as the standard. All of the IC kit-positive samples were isolation and PCR positive. Similarly, all the isolation-positive samples were PCR positive. Twenty-two IC kit-negative samples were evaluated by real-time PCR. Six samples were IC kit negative and isolation positive and contained 3.8 x 10(7) to 2.5 x 10(9) copies of the HAdV genome/ml. Five samples that were only PCR positive contained 3.0 x 10(4) to 3.8 x 10(5) copies of the HAdV genome/ml, but one sample was real-time PCR negative. We conclude that the IC kit is a useful bedside diagnostic tool for HAdV infections because it has 95% sensitivity (compared to isolation), but a negative result does not always rule out HAdV infection."

In a cross-sectional study of one such high risk community, albuminuria was used as a marker of renal disease. The prevalence of albuminuria increased from 0/52 in subjects aged 10-19 years to 10/29 (32.9%) in those aged 50 or more (P < 0.001). Antibodies to streptococcal M protein, markers of past GAS infection, were present in 48/52 (92%) at ages 10-19 years, 16/32 (50%) at ages 30-39, and 20/29 (69%) in those aged 50 or more. After allowing for the age-dependencies of albuminuria and of M protein antibodies (P < 0.001) albuminuria was significantly associated with M protein antibodies (P < 0.01). Thus, 72% of adults aged 30 or more with M protein antibodies also had albuminuria, compared with only 21% of those who were seronegative. More detailed modelling suggested that although most Aboriginal people in this community developed M protein antibodies following GAS infection in childhood, the development of proteinuria was associated with the persistence of such seropositivity into adult life. The models predicted that proteinuria developed at a mean age of 30 years in seropositive persons, at 45 years in seronegative persons who were overweight, and at 62 years in seronegative persons of normal weight. We demonstrated a clear association between evidence of childhood GAS infection and individual risk of proteinuria in adult life. This study provided a strong rationale for prevention of renal disease through the more effective control of GAS skin infections in childhood and through the prevention of obesity in adult life."

CD010502,0,7623660,0,Molecular population genetic analysis of the enn subdivision of group A streptococcal emm-like genes: horizontal gene transfer and restricted variation among enn genes.,"The group A streptococcal emm-like genes, which encode the cell-surface M and M-like proteins, are divided into distinct mrp, emm and enn subdivisions and are clustered together in a region of the chromosome called the vir regulon. In order to understand the mechanisms involved in the evolution of emm-like genes, a 180 bp fragment of the 5' variable region of the enn gene was characterized in 31 strains for which emm sequences and multilocus enzyme electrophoretic profiles have been previously determined. The results demonstrate that nucleotide polymorphisms at the enn locus are generated predominantly by point mutations and short deletions or insertions, and that variation among enn and emm genes has arisen by similar mechanisms. However, diversity at the enn locus is restricted in comparison to the emm locus. Moreover, there is strong evidence for intragenic recombination at the enn locus and the pattern of distribution of emm and enn alleles among strains suggests that these genes may be independently acquired by horizontal transfer and recombination from distinct donor strains, thereby generating a mosaic structure for the vir regulon. The results add to a growing body of evidence that horizontal gene transfer has played a major role in the evolution of Streptococcus pyogenes vir regulons."
CD010502,0,17905980,0,The catabolite control protein CcpA binds to Pmga and influences expression of the virulence regulator Mga in the Group A streptococcus.,"Carbon catabolite repression (CCR) allows bacteria to alter metabolism in response to the availability of specific sugar sources, and increasing evidence suggests that CCR is involved in regulating virulence gene expression in many pathogens. A scan of the M1 SF370 group A streptococcus (GAS) genome using a Bacillus subtilis consensus identified a number of potential catabolite-responsive elements (cre) important for binding by the catabolite control protein A (CcpA), a mediator of CCR in gram-positive bacteria. Intriguingly, a putative cre was identified in the promoter region of mga upstream of its distal P1 start of transcription. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that a His-CcpA fusion protein was capable of binding specifically to the cre in Pmga in vitro. Deletion analysis of Pmga using single-copy Pmga-gusA reporter strains found that Pmga P1 and its upstream cre were not required for normal autoregulated mga expression from Pmga P2 as long as Mga was produced from its native locus. In fact, the Pmga P1 region appeared to show a negative influence on Pmga P2 in these studies. However, deletion of the cre at the native Pmga resulted in a reduction of total mga transcripts as determined by real-time reverse transcription-PCR, supporting a role for CcpA in initial expression. Furthermore, normal transcriptional initiation from the Pmga P1 start site alone was dependent on the presence of the cre. Importantly, inactivation of ccpA in the M6 GAS strain JRS4 resulted in a reduction in Pmga expression and Mga protein levels in late-logarithmic-phase cell growth. These data support a role for CcpA in the early activation of the mga promoter and establish a link between CCR and Mga regulation in the GAS."

In the present study more than 100 large vir regulons from 42 different GAS serotypes were analyzed by PCR and partial DNA sequencing. On comparing these data to published sequences, sites of mutational and putative recombinational events were identified and ordered with respect to their intra/intergenic or intra/intergenomic nature. The emm-related genes were found to display small intragenic deletions or insertions, were completely deleted from, or newly inserted into the genome, or were fused to adjacent genes. Intergenomic exchanges of complete emm-related genes, or segments thereof, between different vir regulons were detected. Most of these processes seem to involve short flanking direct repeats.

Low-grade fever, fatigue, general malaise, or sore throat were present in only 6 (15%) of the 40 patients. A positive result for all serological tests was time dependent from the clinical onset of lymphadenopathy. The initial serum samples were positive for antibody for each patient, as shown by a Sabin-Feldman dye test. Between 3 and 6 months after clinical onset of TL, all of the patients had antibody titers of > or = 1:1,024. The ELISA was positive for IgM antibodies in all of the patients in the first 3 months. Detection of IgA or IgE antibodies or an acute pattern in the differential agglutination test was helpful in diagnosing TL in those patients who had negative, low-positive, or equivocal titers of IgM antibodies (as measured by ELISA) after 3 months. A toxoplasmic serological profile on the first serum specimen drawn after clinical onset of TL had a sensitivity of 100%. It is advisable to obtain such a serological profile in cases of asymptomatic lymphadenopathy before biopsy is carried out, especially for those individuals who have negative or equivocal IgM antibody titers."

We have reported that the expression of 2 streptococcal virulence factors, the streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin (Spe) A and the cysteine protease SpeB, was reciprocally modulated during infection with Streptococcus pyogenes. To identify host signals mediating this reciprocal regulation, we cocultured clonal M1T1 isolates with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). In accordance with our in vivo findings, when bacteria were in direct contact with human PBMCs or were separated in transwells, expression of speA was induced, whereas expression of speB was down-regulated. This phenomenon was mediated by transferrin and lactoferrin and was influenced by the iron-saturation status of these proteins. Iron chelation from media induced expression of speA, but to a much lesser degree than did that with apotransferrin and lactoferrin, suggesting additional effects of these ferrins on modulation of expression of speA and speB. Thus, ferrins may play an important role in host-pathogen interactions in skin and mucosal tissues."

The levels of IgG to S. pyogenes T12, S. gordonii and S. sanguis II in patients with IgA nephropathy were also higher than in healthy controls. Serum immune complexes of IgG and IgA were higher in patients with IgA nephropathy than in healthy controls.

The T nodules in patients with IgA nephropathy were enlarged, and this change was not accompanied by atrophy of B-lymphoid follicles. Morphologically, primary T nodules were predominant. In reactive lymph nodes, T nodules generally play an important role in the extra-follicular maturation of stimulated B lymphocytes into Ig-secreting plasma cells. Therefore the enlarged primary T nodules remind us that this maturation may occur more frequently in the tonsils of patients with IgA nephropathy than in those with habitual tonsillitis. This suggests that some immunoregulatory dysfunction exists in the secretory immune system of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues in patients with IgA nephropathy."

In India, three major programs on contraceptive vaccines based on the beta-subunit of human chorionic gonadotrophin ((beta)hCG) for women, ovine follicle stimulating hormone (oFSH) for men, and riboflavin carrier protein for both males and females have been initiated. The work at the National Institute of Immunology, New Delhi on contraceptive vaccine for women, based on (beta)hCG, has demonstrated, for the first time, that it is feasible to regulate fertility by such an approach. Basic research being carried out to achieve immunocontraception by interfering at sperm-oocyte interaction level has been briefly discussed. These developments are still at the research stage. In addition to advances in the area of contraceptive vaccines, a non-steroidal contraceptive oral pill has been developed by Central Drug Research Institute, Lucknow, commercially produced by two Indian pharmaceutical companies and has been incorporated in the National Family Welfare Program. Another interesting approach for fertility regulation in male has been developed in India, which involves vas occlusion with styrene maleic anhydride (SMA) and is currently undergoing clinical trials in human subjects."
CD010502,0,9497374,0,Molecular co-operation between protein PAM and streptokinase for plasmin acquisition by Streptococcus pyogenes.,"Bacterial surface-associated plasmin formation is believed to contribute to invasion, although the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. To define the components necessary for plasmin generation on group A streptococci we used strain AP53 which exposes an M-like protein (""PAM"") that contains a plasminogen-binding sequence with two 13-amino acid residues long tandem repeats (a1 and a2). Utilizing an Escherichia coli-streptococcal shuttle vector, we replaced a 29-residue long sequence segment of Arp4, an M-like protein that does not bind plasminogen, with a single (a1) or the combined a1a2 repeats of PAM. When expressed in E. coli, the purified chimeric Arp/PAM proteins both bound plasminogen, as well as plasmin, and when used to transform group A streptococcal strains lacking the plasminogen-binding ability, transformants with the Arp/PAM constructs efficiently bound plasminogen. Moreover, when grown in the presence of plasminogen, both Arp/PAM- and PAM-expressing streptococci acquired surface-bound plasmin. In contrast, plasminogen activation failed to occur on PAM- and Arp/PAM-expressing streptococci carrying an inactivated streptokinase gene: this block was overcome by exogenous streptokinase. Together, these results provide evidence for an unusual co-operation between a surface-bound protein, PAM, and a secreted protein, streptokinase, resulting in bacterial acquisition of a host protease that is likely to spur parasite invasion of host tissues."
CD010502,0,17012387,0,Role of streptococcal T antigens in superficial skin infection.,"FCT region genes of Streptococcus pyogenes encode surface proteins that include fibronectin- and collagen-binding proteins and the serological markers known as T antigens, some of which give rise to pilus-like appendages. It remains to be established whether FCT region surface proteins contribute to virulence by in vivo models of infection. In this study, a highly sensitive and ecologically relevant humanized mouse model was used to measure superficial skin infection. Three genes encoding FCT region surface proteins essential for T-serotype specificity were inactivated. Both the Deltacpa and DeltaprtF2 mutants were highly attenuated for virulence when topically applied to the skin following exponential growth but were fully virulent when delivered in stationary phase. In contrast, the DeltafctA mutant was virulent at the skin, regardless of its initial growth state. Immunoblots of cell extracts revealed anti-FctA-reactive, ladder-like polymers characteristic of streptococcal pili. In addition, FctA formed a heteropolymer with the putative collagen-binding protein Cpa. The DeltafctA mutant showed a loss in anti-Cpa-reactive polymers, whereas anti-FctA-reactive polymers were reduced in the Deltacpa mutant. The findings suggest that both FctA and Cpa are required for pilus formation, but importantly, an intact pilus is not essential for Cpa-mediated virulence. Although it is an integral part of the T-antigen complex, the fibronectin-binding protein PrtF2 is not covalently linked to the FctA- and Cpa-containing heteropolymer derived from cell extracts. The data provide direct evidence that streptococcal T antigens function as virulence factors in vivo, but they also reveal that a pilus-like structure is not essential for the most common form of streptococcal skin disease."
CD010502,0,9284171,0,Molecular analysis of human cardiac myosin-cross-reactive B- and T-cell epitopes of the group A streptococcal M5 protein.,"The group A streptococcal M protein is an important virulence determinant eliciting protective and autoimmune responses against the streptococcus and cardiac myosin, respectively. In this report, the major human cardiac myosin-cross-reactive T-cell epitopes of M5 protein are identified and localized to myosin-like repeats within the M5 molecule. BALB/c mice were immunized with human cardiac myosin, and the dominant myosin-cross-reactive T-cell epitopes of M5 protein were identified with a panel of 23 overlapping peptides spanning the A, B, and C repeat regions of M5 protein. Human cardiac myosin-cross-reactive T-cell epitopes of M5 protein were localized to several sequences in the M5 peptides NT4 (GLKTENEGLKTENEGLKTE), NT5 (KKEHEAENDKLKQQRDTL), B1B2 (VKDKIAKEQENKETIGTL), B2 (TIGTLKKILDETVKDKIA), B3A (IGTLKKILDETVKDKLAK), and C3 (KGLRRDLDASREAKKQ). The NT4 repeated sequence LKTEN was highly homologous with a site conserved in cardiac myosins, the B repeat region peptides were 47% homologous to human cardiac myosin amino acid sequence, and the C3 sequence RRDL was identical to a highly conserved site in skeletal and cardiac myosins. Immunization of BALB/c mice with each of the overlapping M5 peptides revealed myosin-cross-reactive B-cell epitopes throughout the A and C repeat regions and one major epitope in the B repeat region containing the previously reported Gln-Lys-Ser-Lys-Gln (QKSKQ) epitope. The data suggest that the M5 peptides elicited higher antibody titers to cardiac myosin than to skeletal myosin and that several sites in the A and B repeat regions of M5 protein induced myocardial inflammatory infiltrates."

In this study, recombinant TCR beta chains were constructed with human variable domains Vbeta5.2, Vbeta1 and Vbeta2.1, expressed as inclusion bodies, refolded and purified. The Streptococcus pyogenes SAg SSA-1 was cloned and expressed as a soluble periplasmic protein. SSA-1 was obtained both as a monomer and a dimer that has an intermolecular disulfide bond. We analyzed the biological activity of the recombinant SAgs by proliferation assays. The results suggest that SSA dimerization occludes the TCR interaction site. Naturally occurring SSA dimerization was also observed in supernatants of S. pyogenes isolates. An SSA mutant [SSA(C26S)] was produced to eliminate the Cys responsible for dimerization. Affinity assays using a resonant biosensor showed that both the mutant and monomeric wild type SSA have affinity for human Vbeta5.2 and Vbeta1 with Kd of 9-11 microm with a fast kass and a moderately fast kdiss. In spite of the reported stimulation of Vbeta2.1 bearing T-cells by SSA, we observed no measurable interaction."

CD010502,0,20109044,0,Group A streptococcal pharyngitis and immune-mediated complications: from diagnosis to management.,"Group A streptococcal pharyngitis remains the most important bacterial pharyngitis because of its frequency and potential complications. Group A streptococcal pharyngitis is most common in children 5-11 years of age in winter-spring, and a rapid test or culture is necessary for accurate diagnosis. We propose a management strategy for those geographic areas with very low acute rheumatic fever rates, emphasizing selective testing that avoids testing those patients with viral-like features (e.g., rhinorrhea and cough). Acute rheumatic fever is the most important immune-mediated sequela and has become rare in most areas of the USA and Western Europe, most probably due to decreased circulation of highly rheumatogenic group A streptococcal strains."
CD010502,0,22192160,0,Which anatomical sites should be sampled for screening of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus carriage by culture or by rapid PCR test?,"The nose is the anatomical site usually recommended for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) screening. Other sites are also recommended, but are more controversial. We showed that the sensitivities of MRSA detection from nasal swabs alone were 48% and 62% by culture or by rapid PCR test, respectively. These percentages increased to 79% and 92% with the addition of groin swabs, and to 96% and 99% with the addition of groin and throat swabs. In conclusion, neither by culture nor by rapid PCR test is nose sampling alone sufficient for MRSA detection. Additional anatomical sites should include at least the groin and throat."

Recently, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) has been validated as a marker of cardiac function and prognosis. Plasma adrenomedullin (ADM) levels are elevated in various pathological states including cardiovascular and inflammatory diseases. We aim to assess the relationship between ADM and BNP levels in adult patients with acute and convalescent rheumatic fever (ARF)."
CD010502,0,6154764,0,Heterogeneity of type-specific and cross-reactive antigenic determinants within a single M protein of group A streptococci.,"The heterogeneity of a pepsin extract of type-24 M protein (pep M24) was demonstrated by absorption of type-specific and cross-reactive human antisera with M protein fragments and heterologous serotypes of M proteins, pepsin extract of type-5 M protein (pep M5) and pepsin extract of type-6 M protein (pep M6). 2 of 12 individuals immunized with pep M24 developed significant rises in antibody titers against pep M5 and pep M6, as measured by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The sam individuals also developed opsonic antibodies against type-6, but not type-5, streptococci, which suggested the development of cross-protective immunity. Inhibition studies of one of these sera with the heterologous pep M proteins showed that the cross-reactive antibodies against pep M6 could not be blocked by high concentrations of pep M24, the immunizing antigen; these antibodies could be blocked, however, by cyanogen bromide-derived peptide fragments of pep M24, which suggested that the cross-reactive antibody was raised against an inaccessible site(s) in the pep M24 molecule. Inhibition studies of type-specific immune sera with pep M24 and peptides derived therefrom indicated that the M protein molecule contained multiple distinct as well as identical type-specific antigenic determinants that are unequally distributed among the seven derived peptide fragments."
CD010502,0,2258705,0,Differentiation between two biologically distinct classes of group A streptococci by limited substitutions of amino acids within the shared region of M protein-like molecules.,"Group A streptococci can be categorized into two classes (I and II) based on immunodeterminants contained within a surface-exposed, conserved region (C repeat domain) of the major virulence factor, M protein. Previous studies have shown that several biological properties correlate strongly with streptococcal class, and thus, there is a strong impetus to precisely define the antigenic epitopes unique to class I and II M proteins. Using synthetic peptides, the binding sites of two class I-specific mAbs were mapped to distinct epitopes within the C repeat region of type 6 M protein (class I). A class II M protein-like gene (type 2) was cloned and sequenced, and the predicted amino acid sequence was compared for homology to class I and II molecules, whose sequences were previously reported. For a given C repeat block 35 amino acid residues in length, 20 residue positions were conserved among all sequences analyzed. Of the 15 variable amino acid positions, only four were class specific, and three of the four positions were localized in the area to which the class I-specific mAbs bound. The predicted secondary structures of class I and II C repeat blocks reveals that they are alpha-helical, except for a single area of disruption. In the class I molecules, the area of disruption corresponds to the class I-specific mAb binding sites. Importantly, the predicted conformational characteristics of this disruption differs for class I and II molecules. The data suggest that only limited changes in amino acid residues differentiate between class I and II molecules in the C repeat region. Therefore, selective (biological) pressures may have contributed to the evolution of these two classes of molecules."
CD010502,0,20558662,0,Antibody response to IgA-binding streptococcal M proteins in children with IgA nephropathy.,"IgA nephropathy (IgAN), the most common glomerulonephritis worldwide, is characterized by mesangial deposits containing predominantly IgA. IgAN commonly occurs or exacerbates after upper respiratory tract infections such as streptococcal pharyngitis. Certain group A streptococci express M proteins with IgA-binding regions (IgA-BRs). We have previously shown that these IgA-BRs co-localize with mesangial IgA in IgAN."
CD010502,0,22518858,0,Analysis of a Streptococcus pyogenes puerperal sepsis cluster by use of whole-genome sequencing.,"Between June and November 2010, a concerning rise in the number of cases of puerperal sepsis, a postpartum pelvic bacterial infection contracted by women after childbirth, was observed in the New South Wales, Australia, hospital system. Group A streptococcus (GAS; Streptococcus pyogenes) isolates PS001 to PS011 were recovered from nine patients. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and emm sequence typing revealed that GAS of emm1.40, emm75.0, emm77.0, emm89.0, and emm89.9 were each recovered from a single patient, ruling out a single source of infection. However, emm28.8 GAS were recovered from four different patients. To investigate the relatedness of these emm28 isolates, whole-genome sequencing was undertaken and the genome sequences were compared to the genome sequence of the emm28.4 reference strain, MGAS6180. A total of 186 single nucleotide polymorphisms were identified, for which the phylogenetic reconstruction indicated an outbreak of a polyclonal nature. While two isolates collected from different hospitals were not closely related, isolates from two puerperal sepsis patients from the same hospital were indistinguishable, suggesting patient-to-patient transmission or infection from a common source. The results of this study indicate that traditional typing protocols, such as pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, may not be sensitive enough to allow fine epidemiological discrimination of closely related bacterial isolates. Whole-genome sequencing presents a valid alternative that allows accurate fine-scale epidemiological investigation of bacterial infectious disease."

Hybridization assays using an oligonucleotide probe derived from the N-terminal sequence revealed that this gene segment is highly homologous among M-type 3 isolates. Of note, analysis of the nucleotide sequence data from the C terminus of the gene confirmed that the emm 3 gene exhibited all the features characteristic for group A streptococcal M-class I molecules. Recently published sequence data that were assigned to emm 3 resulted from a strain confusion and were shown to be the first one derived from an emm gene of an M-untypable isolate."

CD010502,0,1968096,0,Acute HIV-1 infection: clinical and biological study of 12 patients.,"We observed 12 patients with acute human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. The clinical syndrome was characterized by fever (all cases), generalized lymphadenopathy (11), arthralgias and myalgias (9), sore throat (9), rash (7), splenomegaly (6), and other less frequent signs and symptoms. All patients had a spontaneous resolution of their symptoms within 5-30 days. Anti-HIV-1 serum antibodies, as measured by enzyme immunoassay (EIA) at the onset of clinical illness, were negative in every patient. HIV antigen (p24), on the contrary, was detectable in nine cases. Western blot IgM and IgG analysis was serially performed: IgMs were positive in nine cases and IgGs in three. The CD4+/CD8+ ratio was low in all patients because CD8+ were remarkably increased and CD4+ slightly reduced. A laterocervical lymph nodes biopsy was performed in four patients. The morphological and immunohistological pattern of the acute HIV-1-related lymphadenopathy did not correspond to any of the typical ones. The envelope virus protein gp120/160 was found in interfollicular and follicular lymphocytes, in endothelial cells, and in interdigitating and dendritic reticulum cells. The p17 and p24 core virus proteins were mainly detected in endothelial, interdigitating, and dendritic reticulum cells, but in only a few lymphocytes. The follow-up suggests a rapid evolution to ARC and AIDS in patients showing an acute symptomatic HIV infection."

Pregnant women, transplant recipients, HIV infected persons and all immunocompromised subjects were excluded. We observed 34 cases (18 women, 16 men) whose mean age was 34 years (17 to 79). Fever appeared progressively (73%), persisted more than 15 days (87%) and was well tolerated. The main functional symptoms were headaches, myalgia (53%), profuse sweat (50%), abdominal pain, diarrhea, recent loss of weight, dry cough (51%). Splenomegaly was present in 24% of the cases. Chest X ray was always normal. Differential blood count was always inverse and an authentic mononucleosis syndrome was present in 91%: it appeared mainly 13 days after onset of symptoms. Hepatic abnormalities were nearly constant, especially cytolytic (97%) (transaminases three or four times upper the normal limit) but also cholestatic (62%). Thrombopenia has been noticed once (48,000/mm3). Serological diagnosis was confirmed with Elisa test (anti CMV Ig M: 30 cases) or complement fixation test (seroconversion: one, significant increase of the titers: two). CMV viremia, studied in seven patients, was positive in three. Spontaneous or treated (NSAI in 30%) outcome was nearly always favourable (97%). Two patients presented severe complications: meningo encephalitis and spleen rupture. CMV infection in previously healthy patients has to be suspected, without waiting for the mononucleosis syndrome, in view of a prolonged, well tolerated febrile illness, without pharyngitis, associated with hyperlymphocytosis and mild cytolysis. A careful follow-up is needed to detect the rare but severe complications."
CD010502,0,3535485,1,Suitability of a throat culture method for evaluation of group A streptococcal antigen detection kits.,"Previous reports have indicated a wide variation in observed sensitivity of antigen-detection kits for group A streptococci. Before undertaking an evaluation of these new kits, the sensitivity of the throat culture technic routinely used by this laboratory was reexamined. Each throat swab was directly inoculated to sheep blood agar containing trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (SXT X BA) and drug-free sheep blood agar (SBA) plates. Swabs were then washed in saline and the saline used to inoculate one more of each type of medium. SXT X BA cultures were incubated aerobically (5 to 10% CO2), and SBA cultures were incubated anaerobically, both for two days at 35 degrees C. From 726 patients, 164 (22.6%) of the specimens contained group A streptococci, 99% detected on directly inoculated cultures and 100% on cultures inoculated with the saline wash. Either an aerobically (CO2) incubated SXT X BA or an anaerobically incubated SBA, directly inoculated and held for two days, appears to offer a satisfactory reference culture method for the recovery of group A streptococci."

Cell walls were lysate by the enzymatic action of M1 endo-N-acetylmuramidase. The cell wall lysate was concentrated and chromatographed on a Sephadex G-100 column. Two fractions reactive with group A antisera were obtained. These were composed of N-acetylglucosamine, rhamnose, and peptidoglycan components such as glutamic acid, lysine, alanine, N-acetylmuramic acid and N-acetylglucosamine. For comparison, hot TCA extract of the cell walls (TCAgA) or Rantz and Randall extract of the whole cells (RRgA) was purified chromatographically. The latter two also contained rhamnose and glucosamine, and were reactive with group A antisera. The molecular weights of M1gA antigens were larger than those of TCAgA and RRgA.

CD010502,0,8154403,0,Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis: current clinical concepts.,"The classic triad of fever, pharyngeal exudate and tender anterior cervical adenopathy is present in only 15 percent of cases of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis. Since clinical findings are unreliable, a rapid streptococcal test or a throat culture should be performed to confirm the diagnosis. A positive rapid test immediately identifies group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus and may help encourage patients to complete the course of antibiotics. However, a negative rapid test does not definitively rule out this organism and should be followed by a throat culture. Early antibiotic therapy reduces the duration of pharyngitis, minimizes transmission and lessens complications such as acute rheumatic fever and abscess. A 10-day course of oral penicillin or an intramuscular injection of penicillin G benzathine is recommended. Erythromycin is recommended for patients who are allergic to penicillin."
CD010502,0,1583103,0,Application of Directigen FLU-A for the detection of influenza A virus in human and nonhuman specimens.,"Directigen FLU-A, a new enzyme immunoassay membrane test, rapidly detects influenza A virus antigen in specimens from patients. Nasopharyngeal washes and pharyngeal gargles were used to determine the effectiveness of the assay as applied to different types of routinely collected clinical samples. All specimens had been previously shown to contain influenza A virus by virus isolation in tissue culture. Directigen FLU-A was 90% sensitive (95% confidence interval, 56 to 99.7%) with nasopharyngeal washes but only 39% sensitive (95% confidence interval, 17 to 64%) with pharyngeal gargles (P = 0.018) when used with samples containing similar amounts of infectious virus (50% tissue culture infective dose, 1.0 to 4.5). The intensity of the positive reaction with Directigen FLU-A did not correlate with the amount of virus in the specimens. Directigen FLU-A was found to detect cell-associated antigen more readily than free virus; only 20 infected cells were required to identify cell-associated influenza A virus antigen, whereas the limit of detection for free virus was 1.63 x 10(3) infectious virus particles. These findings suggest that Directigen FLU-A detects the cell-associated antigen present in clinical specimens rather than free virus. In addition, Directigen FLU-A detected avian and swine influenza A viruses in both cloacal swabs (75% sensitivity) and swine lung homogenates (86% sensitivity), indicating its potential usefulness in the surveillance of nonhuman influenza A viruses."

Fifty-five strains of S suis, including human and swine meningeal and pneumonic isolates, were tested for M protein genes by DNA probes representing the constant domain of the 3' end of the group A, M protein gene. None of the S suis strains examined was positive, indicating that these organisms either lack M protein genes or harbour different genes, not expressing the constant domains of protein M from group A."
CD010502,0,1984457,0,The human antibody response to streptococcal C5a peptidase.,"An ELISA was developed to measure antibody, both IgG and IgA, against the streptococcal C5a peptidase (SCP), in human sera and saliva. Generally, sera and saliva from young, uninfected children lacked antibody to SCP. In contrast, most sera and saliva specimens from healthy adults had measurable levels of anti-SCP IgG and SCP-specific secretory IgA (anti-SCP sIgA). Paired acute and convalescent sera from patients with streptococcal pharyngitis possessed significantly higher levels of anti-SCP IgG than did sera from healthy individuals. Sera containing high concentrations of anti-SCP immunoglobulin were capable of neutralizing SCP activity. A survey of healthy adults and children also showed that the latter were significantly less likely to have anti-SCP sIgA in their saliva. Detection of this antibody in greater than 90% of the saliva specimens obtained from children who had recently experienced streptococcal pharyngitis demonstrated that children can produce a secretory response. This is thought to be the first report of a secretory IgA response in humans to a somatic antigen of Streptococcus pyogenes."
CD010502,0,9350760,0,Decreased capacity for type-specific-antigen synthesis accounts for high prevalence of nontypeable strains of group B streptococci in Mexico.,"The low incidence of group B streptococcal (GBS) invasive neonatal disease in Mexico has been attributed to the low prevalence of serotype III strains, a major serotype in developed countries. In addition, nontypeable strains account for 12% of the isolates in Mexico and < 1% of the isolates in the United States. In this study, 57 GBS isolates (28 nontypeable by the Lancefield procedure) from carrier and infected neonates and women from Mexico were also examined for the presence of type-specific antigen by an enzymatic procedure using N-acetylmuramidase digestion of the cell wall to release soluble type-specific antigen. Of the 28 nontypeable strains from Mexico, 23 were typeable by the enzyme extraction procedure, with serotype III being the predominant serotype in invasive disease. These results suggest that nontypeable isolates of GBS should be further examined by the enzymatic extraction procedure to determine the presence of type-specific antigen. Furthermore, these limited results suggest that serotype III is likely a major serotype in invasive disease also in Mexico."

Components eluted with the neutral buffer (0.05 M phosphate, 0.2 M NaCl, 0.02% NaN3, pH 7.0) reacted serologically in the same manner as the crude T protein. By using 0.1 M citrate, 6 M urea pH 3.0 buffer a type specifically reacting protein (T1-TRYP-F) was eluted from the fibrinogen column.

CD010502,0,1698337,0,Comparison of a rapid enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test and the Gram stain for detection of group B streptococcus in high-risk antepartum patients.,"Early-onset neonatal sepsis with group B streptococci is a major problem in the management of high-risk obstetrics. Intrapartum treatment of the colonized mother reduces neonatal acquisition; however, many high-risk patients are delivered before culture results are available. This study prospectively evaluated a new enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and the Gram stain for their accuracy in rapid detection of group B streptococci in 131 high-risk patients. Twenty positive cultures for group B streptococci were identified in the study population and were used as the control for test comparisons. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test was 60% sensitive, whereas the Gram stain was 45% sensitive. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay showed an increase in sensitivity as the colony count increased; however, two cases of severe neonatal sepsis occurred in patients with low colony counts and both had enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay negative results. In conclusion, the need for a rapid sensitive test for group B streptococci detection still exists."

We evaluated emm type and subtype distribution among pediatric pharyngitis isolates obtained from 9 sites in the United States during 2000-2001 (year 1) and from 10 sites in the United States and 1 site in Canada during 2001-2002 (year 2). The 7 predominant types were the same in both years, although their order changed. emm 12, 1, and 28 accounted for 49.2% of year 1 isolates, and emm 1, 12, and 4 accounted for 47.1% of year 2 isolates; 6 types accounted for 72.1% in year 1 and 69.4% in year 2. From year 1 to year 2, the proportions of emm 12 and 28 decreased and emm 1 and 6 increased. Striking intersite and interseasonal variations in the distribution of predominant emm types were observed. We conclude that the most-predominant GAS genotypes were similar for each year despite fluctuations, that intersite and intrasite variations in the distribution of emm types were apparent, and that emm type surveillance is needed as M protein vaccine development proceeds."
CD010502,0,21660400,0,Approach to a child with sore throat.,"Sore throat is one of the common reasons for outpatient and emergency visits among children. It could be because of several etiologies; of these bacterial pharyngitis is the most important. Major challenge for the clinician is to diagnose group A beta hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS) pharyngitis and diphtheria, which are associated with serious complications. Throat swab smear with culture and rapid antigen tests are useful for making the diagnosis but the later may not be available in resource poor settings. Many clinical scores have been devised to diagnose GABHS with variable success but usually clinical features, epidemiological criteria and expert clinical judgment with or without supportive investigations indicate need for antibiotics. A child with sore throat and toxic look may have diphtheria or parapharyngeal/retropharyngeal abscess, and therefore should be hospitalized."

CD010502,0,8889294,0,Measurement of swallowing in patients with sore throats.,"Swallowing function was measured using a simple timed test in 20 healthy subjects with a sore throat (16 women, median age [range] 27.5 years [19.3-44.5]) and the test was repeated following recovery. All three indices from the test average volume per swallow (ml), average time per swallow (s) and swallowing capacity (mls-1) were significantly improved following recovery (P = 0.0001, 0.041 and 0.0001 respectively). There was no significant change in respiratory function between the two visits. The indices from a timed test of swallowing are sensitive enough to detect changes occurring due to a sore throat; the test provides a simple bedside technique for quantifying swallowing and may be useful in measuring the rate of recovery from swallowing problems and in assessing the effect of different treatments on swallowing function."

In this study, Lewis rats were immunized with a pool of overlapping peptides spanning the conserved region of the GAS M protein in Complete Freund's Adjuvant, followed by immunization with Bordetella pertussis. Controls received adjuvants alone. Spleen-derived lymphocytes from rats immunized with the conserved region peptides proliferated in response to the immunogen and to cardiac myosin. Moreover, histological examination of cardiac tissue from rats immunized with conserved region peptides revealed the presence of inflammatory lesions in both the myocardium and valve tissue indicating a role for GAS M protein-specific autoreactive T cells in the development of cardiac lesions. This study may support the use of the rat model of autoimmune valvulitis to investigate the immunopathogenesis of RHD and possible preventive strategies."

GAS isolated from patients with pharyngitis and GAS isolated from patients with more severe disease, such as necrotizing fasciitis, adhered to and penetrated HEp-2 cells equally well. M3, M4, M6, and M12 strains adhered to and were internalized within HEp-2 cells more than M1 strains. M18 GAS producing hyaluronic acid capsules were less adherent and less invasive than the M3, M4, M6, and M12 strains. An M3-producing GAS strain and its M protein-deficient isogenic strain adhered similarly to HEp-2 cells, but the M protein-deficient strain exhibited greater penetration. Preincubation of HEp-2 cells with an N-terminal synthetic M3 peptide did not alter the adherence or penetration by an M3 strain. In summary, this study demonstrates that GAS from invasive and non-invasive disease adhere to and penetrate HEp-2 cells equally well and that multiple strains of GAS with various M protein types have the ability to adhere to and penetrate HEp-2 cells."

Recently, up to 47% of enterococci have been found to possess antigens cross-reactive with both the group D and the group G grouping reagents. We investigated whether the organisms had recently emerged or whether changes in extraction methods (enzyme extraction) have resulted in our awareness of their existence. We found that approximately 20% of our enterococcal isolates released material cross-reactive with the group G reagents. These organisms have been present for at least 6 years, and probably for many more. In addition, we found that most strains of Listeria monocytogenes also released antigen cross-reactive with the group G reagent. The clinical significance of these findings is also discussed."

The amino acid sequence was determined of the N-terminal region of the M protein representing the most exposed part of the molecule on the surface fibrils of streptococcal cells, which seems to be very important for the differentiation of the individual serological types. The sequence differs from the homologous N-terminal sequences of types 5, 6 and 24, and shows a homology with sequences repeating in the chain of type 24. Fragment Pep M1 binds to fibrinogen; the absence of its 30 N-terminal amino acid residues, however, abolishes this interaction which is believed to play a role in the virulence of S. pyogenes."
CD010502,0,8103484,0,Group B streptococcal infections in pregnancy. ACOG Technical Bulletin Number 170--July 1992.,"GBS is the leading cause of perinatal bacterial infections in the United States. Selective intrapartum chemoprophylaxis can prevent GBS early-onset neonatal disease and reduce maternal puerperal morbidity. There does not appear to be an effect on late-onset neonatal disease. Protocols for intrapartum antibiotic chemoprophylaxis based on antepartum cultures, testing at parturition, and clinical risk factors have been summarized. While screening of all pregnant women for GBS is an option, screening and selection methods need further development. A highly reliable rapid screening test for intrapartum detection of light and heavy GBS colonization of the lower genital tract is not yet available. Intrapartum antibiotic chemoprophylaxis of GBS carriers with one or more risk factors substantially reduces the frequency of GBS disease. Benefit may also be obtained from prophylaxis based solely on a knowledge of risk factors if GBS carrier status is unknown. The importance of GBS infection as a perinatal problem and its considerable economic burden justify implementation of chemoprophylactic programs by obstetricians, particularly those who encounter a high proportion of patients with perinatal risk factors in their practices."
CD010502,0,22170906,0,Real-time qualitative PCR for 57 human adenovirus types from multiple specimen sources.,"Human adenoviruses (HAdVs) are ubiquitous double-stranded DNA viruses that cause a wide array of diseases in humans including pharyngitis, pneumonia, gastroenteritis, hemorrhagic cystitis, and keratoconjunctivitis. They also cause life-threatening opportunistic infections in immunocompromised individuals and are responsible for outbreaks in certain populations. Diagnosis is traditionally by cell culture or antigen detection methods. However, some HAdVs can take up to 4 weeks to isolate, and diarrheagenic types 40 and 41 will not grow in routine cell culture. Therefore, the goal of this study was to design a rapid, real-time PCR assay to detect all known 57 HAdV types from multiple different specimen sources. Primers and fluorescence resonance energy transfer hybridization probes were designed to target a 185-bp region of the penton base gene of HAdV. The analytical sensitivity was determined to be 10 copies/μl for HAdV types showing exact primer/probe homology in specimen matrix. Using whole-virus strains, the analytical sensitivity for representative HAdV types ranged from 10(-1) to 10(3) 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID(50))/ml. The assay demonstrated 100% sensitivity and 99% specificity. This real-time PCR assay provides a rapid method for the detection of all 57 known HAdV types from respiratory specimens, blood, stool, urine, and ocular swabs."

The aim of these guidelines is to determine optimal treatment for streptococcal sore throat and reasonable indications for tonsillectomy, as well as recommend how to differentiate streptococcal infection for which antibiotics are justified, from numerous other sore throats where antibiotics wont have a significant effect on disease course, but might contribute to bacterial resistance to antibiotics. The development of the guidelines was initiated by the Interdisciplinary Section for Antibiotic Resistance Control (ISKRA) of the Croatian Ministry of Health and Social Welfare in accordance with the principles of AGREE (Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation) methodology which means that the guidelines are the result of consensus between all interested professional societies and institutions. For streptococcal sore throat diagnostics, the Working Group recommends evaluation of clinical presentation according to Centor criteria and for patients with Centor score 0-1, antibiotic therapy is not recommended nor bacteriological testing, while for patients with Centor score 2-4 bacteriological testing is recommended (rapid test or culture) as well as antibiotic therapy in case of positive result. The drug of choice for the treatment of streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis is oral penicillin taken for ten days (penicillin V) or in case of poor patient compliance benzathine penicillin G can be administered parenterally in a single dose. Other antibiotics (macrolides, clindamycin, cephalosporins, co-amoxiclav) are administered only in case of hypersensitivity to penicillin or in recurrent infections. Tonsillectomy is a widely accepted surgical procedure that decreases the number of sore throats in children and should be performed only if indications for this procedure are established. Absolute indications include five or more streptococcal infections per year, tonsillitis complications, permanent respiratory tract obstruction, obstructive sleep apnea syndrome and suspected tonsillar malignancy. Relative indications include chronic tonsillitis and occlusion disturbances."
CD010502,0,3711271,0,Accuracy and reproducibility of the IDS rapID STR system for species identification of streptococci.,"The RapID STR system (Innovative Diagnostic Systems, Inc., Atlanta, Ga.) was evaluated in the identification of 266 streptococci. Organisms included 60 beta-hemolytic streptococci, 71 group D strains (48 enterococci and 23 nonenterococci), 26 Streptococcus pneumoniae, and 109 viridans group strains. With concomitant optochin testing, as is currently recommended by the manufacturer for all alpha-hemolytic strains, the RapID STR system correctly identified 100% of beta-hemolytic strains, 87.3% of group D strains (93.7% of enterococci, 73.9% of nonenterococci), 88.5% of S. pneumoniae, and 72.5% of viridans strains. Without the use of optochin, the correct identification of S. pneumoniae and the viridans group was 26.9 and 52.3%, respectively. The RapID STR system incorrectly identified 3.0% of strains, including four group D streptococci, three pneumococci, and one viridans isolate. Reproducibility was excellent, with 95% of strains tested in triplicate yielding identical results on each of the three occasions. The RapID STR system represents a worthwhile advance in streptococcal species identification, especially for group D and viridans strains."
CD010502,0,12011018,0,Dissemination of the phage-associated novel superantigen gene speL in recent invasive and noninvasive Streptococcus pyogenes M3/T3 isolates in Japan.,"In Japan, more than 10% of streptococcal toxic shock-like syndrome (TSLS) cases have been caused by Streptococcus pyogenes M3/T3 isolates since the first reported TSLS case in 1992. Most M3/T3 isolates from TSLS or severe invasive infection cases during 1992 to 2001 and those from noninvasive cases during this period are indistinguishable in pulsed-field gel electropherograms. The longest fragments of these recent isolates were 300 kb in size, whereas those of isolates recovered during or before 1973 were 260 kb in size. These 260- and 300-kb fragments hybridized to each other, suggesting the acquisition of an about 40-kb fragment by the recent isolates. The whole part of the acquired fragment was cloned from the first Japanese TSLS isolate, NIH1, and its nucleotide sequence was determined. The 41,796-bp fragment is temperate phage phiNIH1.1, containing a new superantigen gene speL near its right attachment site. The C-terminal part of the deduced amino acid sequence of speL has 48 and 46% similarity with well-characterized erythrogenic toxin SpeC and the most potent superantigen, SmeZ-2, respectively. None of 10 T3 isolates recovered during or before 1973 has speL, whereas all of 18 M3/T3 isolates recovered during or after 1992 and, surprisingly, Streptococcus equi subsp. equi ATCC 9527 do have this gene. Though plaques could not be obtained from phiNIH1.1, its DNA became detectable from the phage particle fraction upon mitomycin C induction, showing that this phage is not defective. A horizontal transfer of the phage carrying speL may explain the observed change in M3/T3 S. pyogenes isolates in Japan."
CD010502,0,9122216,0,Exploring the basis of peptide-carbohydrate crossreactivity: evidence for discrimination by peptides between closely related anti-carbohydrate antibodies.,"To investigate the molecular basis of antigenic mimicry by peptides, we studied a panel of closely related mAbs directed against the cell-wall polysaccharide of group A Streptococcus. These antibodies have restricted V-gene usage, indicating a shared mechanism of binding to a single epitope. Epitope mapping studies using synthetic fragments of the cell-wall polysaccharide supported this conclusion. All of the mAbs isolated crossreactive peptides from a panel of phage-displayed libraries, and competition studies indicated that many of the peptides bind at or near the carbohydrate binding site. Surprisingly, the peptides isolated by each mAb fell into distinct consensus-sequence groups that discriminated between the mAbs, and in general, the peptides bound only to the mAbs used for their isolation. Similar results were obtained with polyclonal antibodies directed against synthetic oligosaccharide fragments of the streptococcal cell-wall polysaccharide. Thus, the peptides appear to be specific for their isolating antibodies and are not recognized by the same mechanism as their carbohydrate counterparts."
CD010502,0,11292710,0,Spa contributes to the virulence of type 18 group A streptococci.,"Streptococcal protective antigen (Spa) is a newly described surface protein of group A streptococci that was recently shown to evoke protective antibodies (J. B. Dale, E. Y. Chiang, S. Liu, H. S. Courtney, and D. L. Hasty, J. Clin. Investig. 103:1261--1268, 1999). In this study, we have determined the complete sequence of the spa gene from type 18 streptococci. Purified, recombinant Spa protein evoked antibodies that were bactericidal against type 18 streptococci, confirming the presence of protective epitopes. Sera from patients with acute rheumatic fever contained antibodies against recombinant Spa, indicating that the Spa protein is expressed in vivo and is immunogenic in humans. To determine the role of Spa in the virulence of group A streptococci, we created a series of insertional mutants that were (i) Spa negative and M18 positive, (ii) Spa positive and M18 negative, and (iii) Spa negative and M18 negative. The mutants and the parent M18 strain (18-282) were used in assays to determine resistance to phagocytosis, growth in human blood, and mouse virulence. The results show that Spa is a virulence determinant of group A streptococci and that expression of both Spa and M18 is required for optimal virulence of type 18 streptococci."

CD010502,0,10887654,0,Role of streptococcal infection in the acute pathology of lymphatic filariasis.,"Growing evidence suggest that secondary bacterial, mainly streptococcal, infections contribute significantly to recurrent episodes of acute adenolymphangitis (ADL) of filarial origin. We examined the role of group A streptococci in the progression of lymphedema in Polynesian patients with filariasis-related ADL (22 cases) or chronic pathology (10 cases), or with erysipela (10 patients) and, as controls, in 20 healthy adults. Antistreptolysin O (ASLO) and anti-streptodornase B (ASDB) titers were systematically determined in parallel to parasitological and biochemical tests. ASLO and ASDB assays were positive in 100% of erysipela, 75% of filarial ADL as compared to 50% of chronic pathology and 39% of healthy controls. Interestingly, by opposition to ASLO titers which were not significantly different between the four groups, ASDB titers were higher in ADL (p = 0.019) and erysipela (p = 0.002) than in controls. These results support the hypothesis that recurrent streptococcal infections may have an important role in the pathogenesis of ADL in lymphatic filariasis."

Almost 10% of these swabs gave false positive reactions with the group C component of the test system. Samples taken from uninfected individuals indicated that the false positives were probably associated with blood group A.

CD010502,0,10374697,0,Vaccine strategies to prevent rheumatic fever.,"Group A streptococci (GAS) are responsible for numerous human illnesses, ranging from pharyngitis to severe invasive infections, such as necrotizing fascitis and toxic shock syndrome to the postinfectious sequelae, acute rheumatic fever (ARF), and glomerulonephritis. To date, to develop a vaccine, studies have focused on the M protein. However, designing a vaccine to prevent GAS infection based on this molecule has been hampered by the vast number of M protein serotypes and the possibility that it may induce potentially harmful autoimmune reactions. In this article, the authors discuss recent approaches to overcoming the problems of an M protein-based vaccine. In addition, recent studies identifying the protective properties of other streptococcal antigens and their potential as vaccine candidates are discussed."
CD010502,0,10200965,0,Expression of different group A streptococcal M proteins in an isogenic background demonstrates diversity in adherence to and invasion of eukaryotic cells.,"The M protein of group A streptococcus (GAS) is considered to be a major virulence factor because it renders GAS resistant to phagocytosis and allows bacterial growth in human blood. There are more than 80 known serotypes of M proteins, and protective opsonic antibodies produced during disease in humans are serotype specific. M proteins also mediate bacterial adherence to epithelial cells of skin and pharynx. GAS strains vary in the genomic organization of the mga regulon, which contains the genes encoding M and M-like proteins and other virulence factors. This diversity of organization makes it difficult to assess virulence of M proteins of different serotypes, unless they can be expressed in an isogenic background. Here, we express M proteins of different serotypes in the M protein- and protein F1-deficient GAS strain, SAM2, which also lacks M-like proteins. Genes encoding M proteins of different serotypes (emmXs) have been integrated into the SAM2 chromosome in frame with the emm6.1 promoter and its mga regulon, resulting in similar levels of emmX expression. Although SAM2 exhibits a very low level of adherence to and invasion of HEp-2 and HaCaT cells, a SAM2-derived strain expressing M6 protein adheres to and invades both cell types. In contrast, the isogenic strain expressing M18 protein adheres to both cell types, but invades with a very low efficiency. A strain expressing M3 protein adheres to both types of cells, but its invasion of HEp-2 cells is serum dependent. A GAS strain expressing M6 protein does not compete with the isogenic strain expressing M18 protein for adherence to or invasion of HaCaT cells. We conclude that M proteins of different serotypes recognize different repertoires of receptors on the surfaces of eukaryotic cells."
CD010502,0,16420362,0,Anti-phagocytic mechanisms of Streptococcus pyogenes: binding of fibrinogen to M-related protein.,"A key attribute of invasive Streptococcus pyogenes is their ability to resist phagocytosis and multiply in human blood. M-related protein (Mrp) is a major anti-phagocytic factor but the mechanism whereby it helps streptococci to evade phagocytosis has not been demonstrated. We investigated phagocytosis resistance in a strain of serotype M4 by inactivating the mrp gene and also the emm, enn, sof and sfbX genes and by analysing the effect on streptococcal growth in blood and on complement deposition on the bacterial surface. Inactivation of enn4 and sfbX4 had little impact on growth in blood, but ablation of mrp4, emm4 or sof4 reduced streptococcal growth in human blood, confirming that Mrp and Emm are required for optimal resistance to phagocytosis and providing the first indication that Sof may be an anti-phagocytic factor. Moreover, antisera against Mrp4, Emm4 and Sof4 promoted the killing of S. pyogenes, but anti-SfbX serum had no effect. Growth of S. pyogenes in blood was dependent on the presence of fibrinogen and in the absence of fibrinogen there was a twofold increase in complement deposition. Inactivation of mrp4 resulted in a loss of fibrinogen-binding and caused a twofold increase in the binding of C3b that was inhibited by Mg-EGTA. Mrp contained two fibrinogen-binding sites, one of which is within a highly conserved region. These findings indicate that Mrp-fibrinogen interactions prevent surface deposition of complement via the classical pathway, thereby contributing to the ability of these streptococci to resist phagocytosis. This may be a common mechanism for evasion of phagocytosis because Mrp is expressed by approximately half of the clinical isolates of S. pyogenes."
CD010502,0,16431917,0,"Enhancement of streptolysin O activity and intrinsic cytotoxic effects of the group A streptococcal toxin, NAD-glycohydrolase.","Streptolysin O (SLO) is a cholesterol-dependent cytolysin produced by the important human pathogen, group A Streptococcus (Streptococcus pyogenes or GAS). In addition to its cytolytic activity, SLO mediates the translocation of GAS NAD-glycohydrolase (NADase) into human epithelial cells in vitro. Production of both NADase and SLO is associated with augmented host cell injury beyond that produced by SLO alone, but the mechanism of enhanced cytotoxicity is not known. We have now shown that expression of NADase together with SLO dramatically enhanced the lytic activity of GAS culture supernatants for erythrocytes but had no effect on SLO-mediated poration of synthetic cholesterol-rich liposomes. This result revealed a previously unknown contribution of NADase to the cytolytic activity associated with GAS production of SLO. Purified recombinant SLO bound NADase in vitro, supporting a specific, physical interaction of the two proteins. Exposure of human keratinocytes to wild-type GAS, but not to a NADase-deficient mutant strain, resulted in profound depletion of cellular NAD+ and ATP. Furthermore, expression of recombinant GAS NADase in yeast, in the absence of SLO, induced growth arrest, depletion of NAD+ and ATP, and cell death. These findings have provided evidence that the augmentation of SLO-mediated cytotoxicity by NADase is a consequence of depletion of host cell energy stores through the enzymatic action of NADase. Together, the results have provided mechanistic insight into the cytotoxic effects of a unique bipartite bacterial toxin."
CD010502,0,19961667,0,Towards control of Streptococcus iniae.,"Streptococcus iniae is an emerging zoonotic pathogen; such infections generally occur through injuries associated with preparing whole fresh fish for cooking. Those infected to date have been of Asian descent, are usually elderly (average age 68 years), and have had >/=1 underlying conditions that may predispose them to infection. Studies of the foundations of growth characteristics of S. iniae and its interactions with piscine host cells have recently been complemented by molecular studies. Advances in molecular biology have allowed research groups to identify numerous virulence factors and to explore their roles in the progression of S. iniae infection. Many of these virulence factors are homologous to those found in the major human pathogen S. pyogenes. An increased understanding of the properties of these factors and their effect on the success of infection is leading to novel approaches to control S. iniae infection; in particular, vaccination programs at fish farms have reduced the reservoir of infection for additional clinical cases."
CD010502,0,20152941,0,"Effects on human plasminogen conformation and activation rate caused by interaction with VEK-30, a peptide derived from the group A streptococcal M-like protein (PAM).","In vertebrates, fibrinolysis is primarily carried out by the serine protease plasmin (Pm), which is derived from activation of the zymogen precursor, plasminogen (Pg). One of the most distinctive features of Pg/Pm is the presence of five homologous kringle (K) domains. These structural elements possess conserved Lys-binding sites (LBS) that facilitate interactions with substrates, activators, inhibitors and receptors. In human Pg (hPg), K2 displays weak Lys affinity, however the LBS of this domain has been implicated in an atypical interaction with the N-terminal region of a bacterial surface protein known as PAM (Pg-binding group A streptococcal M-like protein). A direct correlation has been established between invasiveness of group A streptococci and their ability to bind Pg. It has been previously demonstrated that a 30-residue internal peptide (VEK-30) from the N-terminal region of PAM competitively inhibits binding of the full-length parent protein to Pg. We have attempted to determine the effects of this ligand-protein interaction on the regulation of Pg zymogen activation and conformation. Our results show minimal effects on the sedimentation velocity coefficients (S degrees (20,w)) of Pg when associated to VEK-30 and a direct relationship between the concentration of VEK-30 or PAM and the activation rate of Pg. These results are in contrast with the major conformational changes elicited by small-molecule activators of Pg, and point towards a novel mechanism of Pg activation that may underlie group A streptococcal (GAS) virulence."

Eight of these epitopes share sequence identity with three other proteins in addition to the original autoantigen, La. The three proteins are human cardiac myosin beta heavy chain, laminin B1 chain and the M6 protein of Streptococcus pyogenes. Affinity purified anti-La antibodies from a further three mothers bound to the La antigen and also to human cardiac myosin and mouse laminin. Affinity purified antibodies from three mothers of healthy children bound to the La antigen but showed minimal binding to either human cardiac myosin or mouse laminin. Cardiac myosin inhibited the binding of CHB-related anti-La antibodies to both La and myosin. These data support a role for maternal autoantibodies crossing the placenta and recognizing foetal cardiac antigens accessible at a critical developmental stage during gestation. We suggest that this would lead to complement fixation, inflammation and the subsequent pathology associated with congenital heart block."

An increase in the incidence of severe GAS infections in Western countries, and the awareness of the burden of GAS-associated diseases in developing nations, which remains high in spite of the availability of antibiotics, has provided the impetus for development of a safe and efficacious GAS vaccine. This has focused on the M protein, a major GAS virulence factor, however, with the publication of several GAS genomes, a number of non-M vaccine candidates are now under investigation."

CD010502,0,11155177,0,Salivary and serum antibody response to Streptococcus mutans antigens in humans.,"Humoral immunity against Streptococcus mutans infection was analyzed in caries-active and caries-free young adults by immunoblotting. All volunteers from both groups had detectable salivary immunoglobulin A (IgA) and serum IgG antibodies, with similar profiles. They could be classified on the basis of relative intensity of the immunoblot bands into categories of high or low responders. Common protein antigens with molecular weight ranging from approximately 45 to 190 kDa could be found either extracellularly or associated with the cell wall of S. mutans cultured in vitro. The predominant reactive antigens recognized by both IgA and IgG were of proteins around 63 and 60 kDa. Detection of IgA antibodies to the various antigens of S. mutans in individual saliva samples did not always correlate with serum IgG antibody profiles. In addition, distinct bands, which reacted preferentially with either IgA or IgG, could be detected by antibodies from specific subjects. Differential reactivities of salivary IgA and serum IgG antibodies to two, cell-wall associated protein antigens around 33 and 36 kDa were found in caries-active and caries-free young adults; 30.8% of caries-free subjects and 12% of caries-active subjects (P < 0.01) exhibited detectable antibody response to these antigens. This difference was not attributable to variations in antibody levels, since antibody response to these proteins were still detectable in some caries-free but not caries-active individuals whose levels of antibodies to other antigens were low. Thus, a new antibody profile which correlates with dental caries disease activity has been identified in a selected population. Differences in mucosal and systemic immune responses to S. mutans seem to be both antigen and host dependent."
CD010502,0,11350170,0,Structure and binding determinants of the recombinant kringle-2 domain of human plasminogen to an internal peptide from a group A Streptococcal surface protein.,"The X-ray crystal structure of a complex of a modified recombinant kringle-2 domain of human plasminogen, K2Pg[C4G/E56D/L72Y] (mK2Pg), containing an upregulated lysine-binding site, bound to a functional 30 residue internal peptide (VEK-30) from an M-type protein of a group A Streptococcus surface protein, has been determined by molecular replacement methods using K4Pg as a model, and refined at 2.7 A resolution to a R-factor of 19.5 %. The X-ray crystal structure shows that VEK-30 exists as a nearly end-to-end alpha-helix in the complex with mK2Pg. The final structure also revealed that Arg17 and His18 of VEK-30 served as cationic loci for Asp54 and Asp56 of the consensus lysine-binding site of mK2Pg, while Glu20 of VEK-30 coordinates with Arg69 of the cationic binding site of mK2Pg. The hydrophobic ligand-binding pocket in mK2Pg, consisting primarily of Trp60 and Trp70, situated between the positive and negative centers of the lysine-binding site, is utilized in a novel manner in stabilizing the interaction with VEK-30 by forming a cation-pi-electron-mediated association with the positive side-chain of Arg17 of this peptide. Additional lysine-binding sites, as well as exosite electrostatic and hydrogen bonding interactions involving Glu9 and Lys14 of VEK-30, were observed in the structural model. The importance of these interactions were tested in solution by investigating the binding constants of synthetic variants of VEK-30 to mK2Pg, and it was found that, Lys14, Arg17, His18, and Glu20 of VEK-30 were the most critical amino acid binding determinants. With regard to the solution studies, circular dichroism analysis of the titration of VEK-30 with mK2Pg demonstrated that the peptidic alpha-helical structure increased substantially when bound to the kringle module, in agreement with the X-ray results. This investigation is the first to delineate structurally the mode of interaction of the lysine-binding site of a kringle with an internal pseudo-lysine residue of a peptide or protein that functionally interacts with a kringle module, and serves as a paradigm for this important class of interactions."

CD010502,0,11090711,0,Immunoglobulin GM and KM allotypes and vaccine immunity.,"Immunoglobulin (Ig) GM and KM allotypes are genetic markers of gamma and kappa-type light chains, respectively. The striking qualitative and quantitative differences in the distribution of these determinants among different races raise questions concerning the nature of the evolutionary selective mechanism that maintains this variation. Associations between Ig allotypes and specific antibody responses could be a selective force for the maintenance of various haplotypes and their frequencies. Data from several studies reporting significant associations between certain GM and KM allotypes and immune responsiveness to polysaccharide vaccines and to particular infectious pathogens support this hypothesis. Possible ways in which constant (C)-region allotypes could contribute to the antibody specificity include the following: (i) certain alleles coding for allotypes may be in linkage disequilibrium with particular variable (V)-region determinants associated with immune responsiveness; (ii) they could directly contribute to the formation of specific idiotypes, as shown for the T15 system in mice; and (iii) allotype-associated structural variability in the C-region could modulate the kinetic competence of the antigen binding sites."
CD010502,0,14638802,0,Recruitment of complement factor H-like protein 1 promotes intracellular invasion by group A streptococci.,"Numerous microbial pathogens exploit complement regulatory proteins such as factor H (FH) and factor H-like protein 1 (FHL-1) for immune evasion. Fba is an FHL-1 and FH binding protein expressed on the surface of the human pathogenic bacterium, Streptococcus pyogenes, a common agent of pharyngeal, skin, and soft-tissue infections. In the present study, we demonstrate that Fba and FHL-1 work in concert to promote invasion of epithelial cells by S. pyogenes. Fba fragments were expressed as recombinant proteins and assayed for binding of FHL-1 and FH by Western blotting, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and surface plasmon resonance. A binding site for FHL-1 and FH was localized to the N-terminal half of Fba, a region predicted to contain a coiled-coil domain. Deletion of this coiled-coil domain greatly reduced FHL-1 and FH binding. PepSpot analyses identified a 16-amino-acid segment of Fba which overlaps the coiled-coil domain that binds both FHL-1 and FH. To localize the Fba binding site in FHL-1 and FH, surface plasmon resonance was used to assess the interactions between the streptococcal protein and a series of recombinant FH deletion constructs. The Fba binding site was localized to short consensus repeat 7 (SCR 7), a domain common to FHL-1 and FH. SCR 7 contains a heparin binding site, and heparin was found to inhibit FHL-1 binding to Fba. FHL-1 promoted entry of Fba(+) group A streptococci into epithelial cells in a dose-dependent manner but did not affect invasion by an isogenic fba mutant. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a bacterial pathogen exploiting a soluble complement regulatory protein for entry into host cells."

CD010502,0,1691192,0,Detection of high levels of heparin binding growth factor-1 (acidic fibroblast growth factor) in inflammatory arthritic joints.,"The synovium from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and LEW/N rats with streptococcal cell wall (SCW) arthritis, an experimental model resembling RA, is characterized by massive proliferation of synovial connective tissues and invasive destruction of periarticular bone and cartilage. Since heparin binding growth factor (HBGF)-1, the precursor of acidic fibroblast growth factor (FGF), is a potent angiogenic polypeptide and mitogen for mesenchymal cells, we sought evidence that it was involved in the synovial pathology of RA and SCW arthritis. HBGF-1 mRNA was detected in RA synovium using the polymerase chain reaction technique, and its product was immunolocalized intracellularly in both RA and osteoarthritis (OA) synovium. HBGF-1 staining was more extensive and intense in synovium of RA patients than OA and correlated with the extent and intensity of synovial mononuclear cell infiltration. HBGF-1 staining also correlated with c-Fos protein staining. In SCW arthritis, HBGF-1 immunostaining was noted in bone marrow, bone, cartilage, synovium, ligamentous and tendinous structures, as well as various dermal structures and developed early in both T-cell competent and incompetent rats. Persistent high level immunostaining of HBGF-1 was only noted in T-cell competent rats like the disease process in general. These observations implicate HBGF-1 in a multitude of biological functions in inflammatory joint diseases."

CD010502,0,15201199,0,Secretions of interleukin-1beta and tumor necrosis factor alpha by whole fetal membranes depend on initial interactions of amnion or choriodecidua with lipopolysaccharides or group B streptococci.,"The present study evaluated the secretions of interleukin (IL)-1beta and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha by fetal membranes stimulated with group B streptococci (GBS) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The aim was to evaluate the initial response of full-thickness membranes to the microbial insult using an in vitro experimental model that allowed testing of the individual contributions of amnion and choriodecidua to stimulation. Full-thickness membranes were obtained after delivery by elective cesarean section from women at 37-40 wk of gestation without evidence of active labor. The membranes were mounted in Transwell devices, physically separating the upper and lower chambers. The LPS (500 ng/ml) or GBS (1 x 10(6) colony-forming units/ml) was added to either the amniotic or choriodecidual surface, and accumulation of IL-1beta and TNFalpha were measured in both compartments using a specific ELISA. Fetal membranes followed different patterns of secretion of proinflammatory cytokines that depended on the side to which the stimulus was added or the nature of the stimulus itself. The TNFalpha was secreted by amnion and choriodecidua in the presence of LPS or GBS, and stimulation with GBS induced a greater synthesis of IL-1beta than did stimulation with LPS. Choriodecidual tissue was more responsive than amniotic tissue, and this response tended to be higher even when the stimulation was only on the amniotic side. However, the amnion plays an active role in recognizing LPS or GBS, contributing a significant amount of TNFalpha. Thus, cooperative and bidirectional communications occur between amnion and choriodecidua in response to bacterial products, which include intermembranous cytokine traffic and signaling between tissues."
CD010502,0,18479886,0,Inactivation of a gene for a fibronectin-binding protein of the oral bacterium Streptococcus mutans partially impairs its adherence to fibronectin.,"A sequence of 1647 base pairs in length of Streptococcus mutans DNA that encodes for a 63-kDa protein with significant amino acid similarity with fibronectin-binding proteins of Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus gordonii was cloned. The putative recombinant fibronectin-binding protein of S. mutans was purified using affinity chromatography and the cloned protein was used to prepare polyclonal antibodies against the recombinant protein. In immunoblot assays, antibodies against the S. pyogenes fibronectin-binding protein, FBP54, were cross-reactive with the S. mutans protein that was designated SmFnB. Additionally, antibodies to the S. mutans SmFnB protein reacted with the S. pyogenes FBP54 protein. The S. mutans SmFnB protein was found to bind to immobilized fibronectin in a concentration dependant manner. A mutant strain of S. mutans M51 that was constructed by allelic exchange did not express the SmFnB protein. This mutant strain, S. mutans DeltaSmFnB, was determined in an ELISA to bind to immobilized fibronectin 30% less when compared to the parental strain S. mutans M51. The results are consistent with the conclusion that the 63-kDa SmFnB protein of S. mutans is a fibronectin-binding protein that may contribute to the interaction of S. mutans with damaged heart tissue during pathogenesis of infective endocarditis. Also, the study suggests that multiple molecules may mediate the interaction of S. mutans with fibronectin."

The sensitivity of the cPHA (8 ng toxin/ml) was high enough to detect toxin in pure cultures containing C. diphtheriae. For this application the cPHA proved to be a simple and reproducible alternative to the Elek-Ouchterlony test. Toxin in culture filtrates of nasal and tonsillar swabs containing toxinogenic strains of C. diphtheriae together with germs of the physiological flora and toxin in serum can be detected with the more sensitive Biotin/Streptavidin ELISA (0.6 ng toxin/ml).

CD010502,0,14708272,0,Diagnosis of invasive pneumococcal infection by PCR amplification of Streptococcus pneumoniae genomic fragments in blood: a multi-centre comparative study.,"The increasing interest in the prevention of pneumococcal disease by immunisation necessitates improved organism-specific surveillance. This is particularly the case with regard to the contribution of Streptococcus pneumoniae infection to community-acquired pneumonia where blood cultures are often negative and sputum culture results ambiguous. Examination by PCR of blood samples taken at hospital admission offers one possibility for such improvement. The sensitivity, specificity and convenience of three pneumolysin gene PCR assays were compared in a large study, using EDTA blood from 175 patients (95 with proven pneumococcal bacteraemia, 80 with bacteraemia due to other organisms). The assays used were a PCR-enzyme immunoassay, a hybridisation probe assay run on the Roche LightCycler and a hydrolysis probe (TaqMan) assay run on an ABI 7700. Overall samples from only 57% of patients with bacteraemic pneumococcal infection yielded a positive result in at least one assay. Individual sensitivities ranged from 45% (TaqMan/ABI) through 35% (PCR-EIA) to 21% (Hybridisation/LightCycler). Specificity (PCR negative in the 80 control patients) ranged from 97-100%. The TaqMan/ABI assay was run in two centres and concordance between results was 91.4%, discrepancies being associated with very weakly positive samples. Overall, the TaqMan/ABI was the most sensitive and convenient assay; however, this method does not appear to offer any significant improvement over conventional blood cultures and is unlikely to be sufficiently sensitive to confirm a pneumococcal aetiology for non-bacteraemic pneumococcal pneumonia. For the present, therefore, blood culture is the preferred option."

CD010502,0,9501227,0,Hypervariability generated by natural selection in an extracellular complement-inhibiting protein of serotype M1 strains of group A Streptococcus.,"In many countries, M1 strains of the human pathogenic bacterium group A Streptococcus are the most common serotype recovered from patients with invasive disease episodes. Strains of this serotype express an extracellular protein that inhibits complement [streptococcal inhibitor of complement (Sic)] and is therefore believed to be a virulence factor. Comparative sequence analysis of the 915-bp sic gene in 165 M1 organisms recovered from diverse localities and infection types identified 62 alleles. Inasmuch as multilocus enzyme electrophoresis and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis previously showed that most M1 organisms represent a distinct streptococcal clone, the extent of sic gene polymorphism was unexpected. The level of polymorphism greatly exceeds that recorded for all other genes examined in serotype M1 strains. All insertions and deletions are in frame, and virtually all nucleotide substitutions alter the amino acid sequence of the Sic protein. These molecular features indicate that structural change in Sic is mediated by natural selection. Study of 70 strains recovered from two temporally distinct epidemics of streptococcal infections in the former East Germany found little sharing of Sic variants among strains recovered in the different time periods. Taken together, the data indicate that sic is a uniquely variable gene and provide insight into a potential molecular mechanism contributing to fluctuations in streptococcal disease frequency and severity."

CD010502,0,3512764,0,Comparison of throat culture and latex agglutination test for streptococcal pharyngitis.,Numerous reports have recently appeared in the clinical microbiology literature that describe agglutination tests for identifying patients with group A streptococcal pharyngitis. These studies have indicated a close correlation between the results of the agglutination tests and traditional throat culturing. This paper describes a comparison study of 100 consecutive throat swab specimens using a commercially available agglutination test and routine throat culturing. The cultures were interpreted by an individual who was blinded to the agglutination test results. All agglutination testing was done by two laboratory members of a family practice office staff. The agglutination procedure was easy to perform and clear to interpret. The test sensitivity and specificity compared well with that reported in the literature from microbiology laboratories. The new agglutination tests are useful in the office laboratory for the identification of group A streptococci. Their primary advantage compared with throat culturing is the rapid availability of test results.

To investigate the mechanisms underlying these apparent false-positive reactions, we examined the urine LPA test in an unselected population of neonates suspected of sepsis. Urine specimens for LPA testing and culture and simultaneous perirectal cultures were obtained from 134 neonates with suspected sepsis. Six infants had positive blood cultures for GBS; four of the six were positive by LPA testing. An additional 20 infants had positive LPA tests but negative blood cultures; of these, 13 had mothers who received antibiotic treatment prior to delivery. Two infants with positive LPA results and negative blood cultures had bacteria isolated from urine cultures obtained in a nonsterile fashion (GBS, Escherichia coli). GBS was not isolated from perirectal swabs of infants with positive LPA tests and negative blood cultures. In conclusion, (i) a high proportion of neonates evaluated for sepsis gave positive LPA tests and negative blood cultures, (ii) local contamination of the perirectal skin or urinary tract with GBS was an unlikely source of false-positive LPA reactions, and (iii) maternal antibiotic pretreatment during labor may represent an important cause of apparent false-positive LPA reactions."
CD010502,0,19781993,0,Psoriasis--as an autoimmune disease caused by molecular mimicry.,"Psoriasis is strongly associated with streptococcal throat infection, and patients have increased occurrence of such infections. Psoriatic lesional T cells are oligoclonal, and T cells recognizing determinants common to streptococcal M-protein and keratin have been detected in patients' blood. We propose that CD8(+) T cells in psoriatic epidermis respond mainly to such determinants, whereas CD4(+) T cells in the dermis preferentially recognize determinants on the streptococcal peptidoglycan that might itself act as an adjuvant. The streptococcal association might reflect the concurrence of superantigen production promoting skin-homing of tonsil T cells, M-protein mimicking keratin determinants, and adjuvant effects of the peptidoglycan. Accordingly, improvement of psoriasis after tonsillectomy should be associated with fewer T cells that recognize keratin and streptococcal determinants."
CD010502,0,12682118,0,Quantitative detection of Moraxella catarrhalis in nasopharyngeal secretions by real-time PCR.,"The recognition of Moraxella catarrhalis as an important cause of respiratory tract infections has been protracted, mainly because it is a frequent commensal organism of the upper respiratory tract and the diagnostic sensitivity of blood or pleural fluid culture is low. Given that the amount of M. catarrhalis bacteria in the upper respiratory tract may change during infection, quantification of these bacteria in nasopharyngeal secretions (NPSs) by real-time PCR may offer a suitable diagnostic approach. Using primers and a fluorescent probe specific for the copB outer membrane protein gene, we detected DNA from serial dilutions of M. catarrhalis cells corresponding to 1 to 10(6) cells. Importantly, there was no difference in the amplification efficiency when the same DNA was mixed with DNA from NPSs devoid of M. catarrhalis. The specificity of the reaction was further confirmed by the lack of amplification of DNAs from other Moraxella species, nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae, H. influenzae type b, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Bordetella pertussis, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, and various Neisseria species. The assay applied to NPSs from 184 patients with respiratory tract infections performed with a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of up to 98% compared to the culture results. The numbers of M. catarrhalis organisms detected by real-time PCR correlated with the numbers detected by semiquantitative culture. This real-time PCR assay targeting the copB outer membrane protein gene provided a sensitive and reliable means for the rapid detection and quantification of M. catarrhalis in NPSs; may serve as a tool to study changes in the amounts of M. catarrhalis during lower respiratory tract infections or following vaccination against S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, or N. meningitidis; and may be applied to other clinical samples."

The human mucosal innate immune system, important components of which are beta-defensins, secretory leukocyte proteinase inhibitor (SLPI) and lysozyme, provides the first line of defence against microorganisms. We report the interaction between DRS and these proteins; further investigations into the interaction of SIC with the beta-defensins; and compare the sensitivity of M12 and M1 GAS to SLPI. We show that SLPI, which kills M1 GAS and is inhibited by SIC, cannot kill M12 GAS. DRS cannot inhibit SLPI killing of M1 GAS, although ELISA shows binding of DRS to SLPI. We suggest that the target for SLPI on M1 GAS resembles SIC, and soluble SIC inhibits by acting as a decoy for SLPI. M12 GAS may not have this target and cannot interact with SLPI. DRS inhibits the antibacterial action of hBD-2 and hBD-3. Binding of both SIC and DRS to hBD-2, and DRS to hBD-3, shows small positive enthalpy, suggesting that binding is largely hydrophobic. The data for SIC and hBD-3 indicate that this is not a homogeneous bimolecular interaction. We conclude that DRS shares several of the properties of SIC, and therefore can be considered an important virulence factor of M12 GAS and an aid to colonization of the host mucosae."

CD010502,0,2837740,0,Comparison of the leader sequences of four group A streptococcal M protein genes.,"The 5' portions and flanking sequences of genes encoding types 1, 12, 24, and 6 M proteins were compared. Although the DNA sequences encoding the amino-termini of the mature M proteins had no obvious similarity, upstream sequences, and those encoding the signal peptides (leader sequences) of the four M protein genes had considerable similarity. In general, the 5' ends of all the leader sequences were more conserved than the 3' ends, although the M6 and M24 leader sequences had identical 3' ends. Sequence similarity among the deduced amino acid sequences of the four signal peptides was more extensive than the corresponding DNA sequences. We found that strict DNA similarity among all four sequences extended only to the ends of the hydrophilic amino-terminal regions of the signal peptides, but that amino acid sequence conservation continued to the ends of the respective hydrophobic cores. With the exception of the M6 and M24 sequences, the regions adjacent to the signal peptidase cleavage sites were highly variable."
CD010502,0,19243651,0,Characterization of emm types and superantigens of Streptococcus pyogenes isolates from children during two sampling periods.,"The characteristics of 359 group A streptococcal (GAS) isolates collected from Chinese paediatric patients in two periods (1993-1994, 2005-2006) were studied. Isolates were assigned to emm types and assayed for eight superantigen (SAg) genes (speA, speC, speH, speI, speG, speJ, ssa, SMEZ). Types emm1 and emm12 were consistently the most prevalent during the two periods, while others varied in frequency. GAS isolates carrying six or more SAg genes increased from 46.53% (1993-1994) to 78.39% (2005-2006); ssa, speH and speJ genes (P<0.05) increased but speA declined (P<0.05). SAg gene profiles were closely associated with the emm type, but strains of the same emm type sometimes carried different SAg genes in the two periods. No significant difference in emm-type distribution and SAg gene profile was noted between isolates from different diseases. These data may contribute towards the development of a GAS vaccine in China."

CD010502,0,20624096,0,Macrolide and tetracycline resistance and emm type distribution of Streptococcus pyogenes isolates recovered from Turkish patients.,"The aims of this study were to determine the susceptibilities to macrolide and tetracycline antibiotics and emm type distribution of Streptococcus pyogenes strains isolated in the Kocaeli University Hospital, Turkey. A total of 127 S. pyogenes clinical isolates were tested. Eleven (9%) isolates were resistant to erythromycin, and 23 (18%) isolates were resistant to tetracycline. Ten of the erythromycin-resistant isolates were also resistant to tetracycline. By the triple-disk test, all erythromycin-resistant isolates showed the inducible macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin-C phenotype and harbored erm(TR) gene. tet(O) was the most common tetracycline resistance gene. Among erythromycin-tetracycline coresistant isolates, seven harbored the tet(O) gene. emm 4, emm 1, emm 2,114, and emm 89 were the most common emm types. These isolates were more susceptible to erythromycin. There was considerable emm type heterogeneity in macrolide or tetracycline resistant isolates. According to our knowledge, this is the first study in which emm type distribution is investigated in Turkey. More comprehensive studies are needed to obtain true information about the epidemiology of macrolide and tetracycline resistance and emm type distribution in Turkey."
CD010502,0,2531195,0,Identification of an endogenous membrane anchor-cleaving enzyme for group A streptococcal M protein. Its implication for the attachment of surface proteins in gram-positive bacteria.,"How streptococcal M protein or other surface proteins of gram-positive bacteria are anchored to the cell is poorly understood. Previously, we reported that M protein released after cell wall removal with a muralytic enzyme lacked the COOH terminal hydrophobic amino acids and charged tail predicted from DNA sequence. An endogenous membrane anchor-cleaving enzyme has now been identified with the ability to release M protein from isolated streptococcal protoplasts. At pH 5.5 in the presence of 30% raffinose, the streptococcal cell wall may be removed with a muralytic enzyme without releasing M protein from the resulting protoplasts indicating that the M molecule is attached through the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane. Release of M molecules occurs when the M protein-charged protoplasts are placed in raffinose buffer at pH 7.4. Although Zn2+, Cd2+, Ca2+, PHMB, and pHMPS inhibit the activity of the releasing enzyme, the blocking activity of Zn2+, Cd2+, and Ca2+ are reversible while PHMB and pHMPS are irreversible. PHMB-treated protoplasts are unable to release M protein at pH 7.4. However, M protein is liberated from these protoplasts when mixed with those prepared from M- streptococci serving as an enzyme source. The supernatant from M- protoplasts is unable to release M protein from PHMB-inactivated M+ protoplasts, confirming that the anchor-cleaving enzyme is membrane bound. Thus, the M protein releasing activity appears to be the result of a thiol-dependent anchor-cleaving enzyme. Streptococcal membranes treated with sodium carbonate and Triton X-114 still retain the M protein verifying that it is an integral membrane molecule. Evidence also is presented indicating significant sequence similarity between M protein and certain GPI-anchored proteins in the region responsible for protein anchoring."
CD010502,0,9342894,0,Serotypes of group A streptococci isolated from healthy schoolchildren in the United Arab Emirates.,"Group A streptococci (GAS) are the most frequent cause of pharyngitis in children and are a common cause of emergency room or paediatric clinic visits worldwide. This study determined the representative M and T types of GAS, and their distribution, among schoolchildren in the United Arab Emirates. Throat swabs were taken and cultured for GAS isolates during the winter of 1994-95 from 1000 children aged 5-7 years attending nine schools. Of the isolates obtained, 100 were serotyped using standard techniques. Nearly all these isolates (91%) were T typable, falling into 15 T types; the commonest being type 1 (n = 17), type 6 (n = 15), type 11 (n = 10), type 2 (n = 8), type 12 (n = 8), and type 28 (n = 8). A total of 76% of the isolates were typable for M protein, falling into 14 M types, with type 1 (n = 17), type 6 (n = 15), type 2 (n = 8), type 22 (n = 5), type 28 (n = 7), and type 75 (n = 5) predominating. Serotype clusters were found in certain classes or schools, although the number of isolates examined was too small to allow definitive epidemiological conclusions to be drawn. The ease of serotyping these isolates suggests that GAS strains in the United Arab Emirates are similar, but not necessarily related, to those commonly found in the USA and Europe, and that these may be the most prevalent strains worldwide. The relative prevalence of M type 1 is significant, as this GAS serotype is associated with serious diseases such as rheumatic heart disease, a recognized problem in the United Arab Emirates, and toxic shock syndrome, which has not yet been reported from this area. Knowledge of the prevalence of GAS serotypes, and further research on the epidemiology of streptococcal disease, will be useful should streptococcal vaccines become available."
CD010502,0,2460864,0,Spontaneous M6 protein size mutants of group A streptococci display variation in antigenic and opsonogenic epitopes.,"Deletions of highly, but not entirely, homologous intragenic sequence repeats result in amino acid sequence and conformational changes in the M proteins of spontaneous M protein-size variants of group A streptococci. To determine if antigenic changes occurred as a result of these deletion mutations, monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies with defined epitopes were used in competition assays. Competing antigens were either purified pepsin-derived fragments (representing the amino-terminal half of the molecule) of parent and mutant M proteins or were intact bacterial cells. These assays showed that antigenic variation occurred at the site(s) of these deletions but not at adjacent or distant epitopes. Once cleaved from the bacterium by pepsin, the M molecules also underwent conformational changes, which were reflected in their ability to compete. A monoclonal antibody opsonic for M6 streptococci lost its ability to completely opsonize one of the size mutants in this study. Therefore, spontaneous intragenic events between repeats within emm-6, the structural gene for the M6 protein, do result in structural variations within the mutant M molecules. This variation alters the ability of certain antibodies, originally produced in response to sequences in the parental M molecule, to bind to the mutant M molecules or opsonize the mutant organisms. Group A streptococci have evolved a mechanism for generating antigenic diversity that differs from currently known mechanisms in other bacterial species."

Obtained data on complex typing of S. pyogenes would be useful for study of molecular epidemiology of diseases caused by GAS and improvement of epidemiologic surveillance."
CD010502,0,2523964,0,Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from AIDS patients release but do not respond to antigen-stimulated NK-activating lymphokines.,"We have previously shown that streptococcal product (SP) extracted from the culture supernatants of Streptococcus pyogenes ATCC 19615 augments NK activity, partly by inducing the release of soluble factors from mononuclear cells. In this study we use SP as an NK stimulant to investigate the mechanism of NK depression in AIDS. We demonstrate that the NK activity of AIDS patients is lower than normal controls and can be significantly enhanced with SP, although not to control levels. The decreased cytotoxicity in AIDS is not due to a depletion of NK cells, nor to the depletion of lymphokines from CD4 cells that are directly involved in NK cell activation. PBMCs from patients with AIDS respond to SP, producing normal levels of NK-enhancing substances in their supernatants. However, upon examining the ability of SP-induced supernatants from control cells to augment the NK activity of cells from AIDS patients, we find significantly less activity in AIDS cells than in control cells, suggesting an intrinsic effector dysfunction of NK cells in AIDS."

CD010502,0,7826326,0,"Human kininogens interact with M protein, a bacterial surface protein and virulence determinant.","Streptococcus pyogenes, the most significant streptococcal species in clinical medicine, expresses surface proteins with affinity for several human plasma proteins. Here we report that kininogens, the precursors to the vasoactive kinins, bind to the surface of S. pyogenes. M protein, a surface molecule and a major virulence factor-in these bacteria, occurs in > 80 different serotypes. Among 49 strains of S. pyogenes, all of different M serotypes, 41 bound radiolabelled kininogens, whereas 6 M protein-negative mutant strains showed no affinity. M protein of most serotypes bind fibrinogen, and among the 55 strains tested, binding of kininogens was closely correlated to fibrinogen binding (r = 0.88, P < 0.0001). Western blotting, slot binding and enzyme immunoassay experiments demonstrated that M proteins isolated from S. pyogenes of three different M protein serotypes (M1, M6 and M46) bound kininogens. The affinity between kininogens and M1 protein was determined to be 5 x 10(7) M-1 and < or = 10(6) M-1 for high molecular weight (H-kininogen) and low molecular weight kininogen, respectively. The kininogen binding site was tentatively mapped to the N-terminal portion of M1 protein, and this site does not overlap the specific and separate binding sites for albumin, IgG and fibrinogen using monoclonal antibodies to, and synthetic peptides of, the kininogen sequence, the major M protein-binding site(s) was mapped to the C-terminal portion of the H-kininogen light chain. We anticipate that the kininogen-M protein interaction contributes to the host-parasite relationship in S. pyogenes infections."
CD010502,0,19371765,0,Rapid screen for epithelial internalization of Tn917-mutagenized Streptococcus pyogenes.,"Group A streptococci (GAS) cause a number of human diseases ranging from pharyngitis to necrotizing fasciitis. GAS are hypothesized to escape killing by either the immune system or beta lactam antibiotics by internalization into epithelial cells. A Tn917 library of transposon mutants was screened for capacity to invade and survive in human epithelial cells using a novel blood agar overlay method. Although the screen revealed that a majority of Tn917 insertions occurred within a 10 kb region of the genome, GAS genes identified as essential for internalization into epithelial cells included ABC transporters, and DNA maintenance proteins, and citrate metabolism enzymes, underlining the importance of adaptation to the intracellular environment."

Eleven children had febrile and 11 afebrile SE. Polymerase chain reaction was used to detect specific DNA from CSF, enzyme immunoassays and immunofluorescence assays to detect specific antibodies in serum and CSF, viral cultures were obtained from CSF, throat and stool and antigen detection from throat specimens. Viral infection was identified in 10 of 11 children with febrile SE (91%) and in 7 of 11 with afebrile SE (64%). Human herpes virus 6 infection was identified in 12 children (55%), and in at least six of them the infection was primary.

CD010502,0,11162187,0,Polymorphism of the virulence regulon and allelic variations of the sic gene among the emm1 isolates of group A Streptococcus from western Norway.,"With the objective of finding genetic markers of invasiveness, 43 isolates of group A streptococcus, isolated in western Norway and from both severe invasive disease and superficial infections, were studied initially by restriction fragment length polymorphism of the virulence regulon (virR -RFLP). Polymorphism that seemed to be related to the severity of infection was observed within the emm1 sequence type, which included 11 invasive and seven non-invasive isolates. These emm1 isolates were further investigated by restriction mapping of the virR and sequence analysis of a polymorphic region, which revealed the presence of a hypervariable sic gene. Of the nine distinct sic alleles, seven were found in single isolates, of which only two were from patients with invasive disease. The other two alleles were shared among nine invasive and two non-invasive isolates. The presence of only two sic allotypes in nine of the 11 invasive isolates, as compared to a different allele in each of the five non-invasive, contemporary isolates supports the hypothesis that selection of the sic variants occurs at mucosal surfaces and implicates mainly two clones among the invasive emm1 isolates."
CD010502,0,7309850,0,Extraction of group A streptococcal M protein with nitrous acid.,Specific precipitating and opsonic neutralizing antigens were identified in dilute-nitrous acid extracts of group A streptococci.

Ninety percent of 31 strains of group A streptococcal dilute-nitrous acid extracts formed precipitin lines of identity with conventional Lancefield extracts of the same group A streptococci.
CD010502,0,11035746,0,"Inverse relation between disease severity and expression of the streptococcal cysteine protease, SpeB, among clonal M1T1 isolates recovered from invasive group A streptococcal infection cases.","The streptococcal cysteine protease (SpeB) is one of the major virulence factors produced by group A streptococci (GAS). In this study we investigated if differences exist in SpeB production by clonally related M1T1 clinical isolates derived from patients with invasive infections. Twenty-nine of these isolates were from nonsevere cases and 48 were from severe cases, including streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS) and necrotizing fasciitis (NF) cases. The expression and amount of the 28-kDa SpeB protein produced were determined by quantitative Western blotting, and protease activity was measured by a fluorescent enzymatic assay. A high degree of variation in SpeB expression was seen among the isolates, and this variation seemed to correlate with the severity and/or clinical manifestation of the invasive infection. The mean amount of 28-kDa SpeB protein and cysteine protease activity produced by isolates from nonsevere cases was significantly higher than that from STSS cases (P = 0.001). This difference was partly due to the fact that 41% of STSS isolates produced little or no SpeB compared to only 14% of isolates recovered in nonsevere cases. Moreover, the cysteine protease activity among those isolates that expressed SpeB was significantly lower for STSS isolates than for isolates from nonsevere cases (P = 0.001). Increased SpeB production was also inversely correlated with intact M protein expression, and inhibition of cysteine protease activity blocked the cleavage of the surface M protein. Together, the data support the existence of both an ""on-off"" and a posttranslational regulatory mechanism(s) controlling SpeB production, and they suggest that isolates with the speB gene in the ""off"" state are more likely to spare the surface M protein and to be isolated from cases of severe rather than nonsevere invasive infection. These findings may have important implications for the role of SpeB in host-pathogen interactions via regulation of the expression of GAS virulence genes and the severity of invasive disease."
CD010502,0,7026447,0,Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for detection of type A streptococcal exotoxin: kinetics and regulation during growth of Streptococcus pyogenes.,"We describe the detection and quantitation of type A streptococcal exotoxin (erythrogenic toxin, streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin) by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. This sensitive and specific technique detected microgram amounts of type A exotoxin and was useful for studying the kinetics and regulation of type A exotoxin production during the growth of Streptococcus pyogenes NY5. Maximum production of type A exotoxin was observed during the mid-log phase of growth, similar to the production of other streptococcal extracellular products. When S. pyogenes NY5 was grown at 42 degrees C, decreases in both growth and type A exotoxin production were observed. The results obtained when we studied the influence of nutrient additives and metal ions on the production of type A exotoxin led to the conclusion that none of these factors significantly affected type A exotoxin synthesis and that regulation was constitutive."
CD010502,0,8699063,0,Interleukin-6 production by human neonatal monocytes stimulated by type III group B streptococci.,"The subcellular components of type III group B streptococci (GBS) that contribute to the host inflammatory response were determined by measuring production of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-6 by cord blood monocytes. Monocytes were stimulated with encapsulated (COH1) or unencapsulated (COH1-13) whole type III GBS or with purified GBS components, including type III capsular polysaccharide (III-PS), group B antigen (GB-Ag), lipoteichoic acid (LTA), or Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide. Monocytes exposed to COH1 and COH1-13 released similar amounts of IL-6. GBS III-PS, GB-Ag, and LTA each induced IL-6. However, IL-6 release by monocytes was significantly greater after stimulation by GB-Ag than by III-PS or LTA (P < .05). Sera from 16 neonates with systemic GBS disease had IL-6 levels of 8 pg/mL to 4.28 ng/mL. GB-Ag is a potent inducer of IL-6 and may play an important role in tissue inflammation during GBS infection."

CD010502,0,16824100,0,Identification of novel genomic islands coding for antigenic pilus-like structures in Streptococcus agalactiae.,"We have recently reported the presence of covalently linked pilus-like structures in the human pathogen, Group B Streptococcus (GBS). The pilus operon codes for three proteins which contain the conserved amino acid motif, LPXTG, associated with cell wall-anchored proteins together with two genes coding for sortase enzymes. Analysis of the eight sequenced genomes of GBS has led to the identification of a second, related genomic island of which there are two variants, each containing genes coding for proteins with LPXTG motifs and sortases. Here we show that both variant islands also code for pilus-like structures. Furthermore, we provide a thorough description and characterization of the genomic organization of the islands and the role of each protein in the assembly of the pili. For each pilus, polymerization of one of the three component proteins is essential for incorporation of the other two proteins into the pilus structure. In addition, two sortases are required for complete pilus assembly, each with specificity for one of the pilus components. A component protein of one of the newly identified pili is also a previously identified protective antigen and a second component of this pilus is shown to confer protection against GBS challenge. We propose that pilus-like structures are important virulence factors and potential vaccine candidates."

Sensitivity and specificity of the PCR method was compared to conventional virus isolation using MDCK cells. Three pairs of primers for PCR in detecting the HA genes of AH1, AH3, and B influenza viruses showed both subtype and type specificity. The dilution experiments showed that influenza viruses, as few as 1.1-3.5 plaque-forming units per 50 microliters, were sufficient for the detection of HA genes by PCR method and the detection rate by PCR method was 2-3 fold higher than that by conventional method. Our results showed that the PCR method was a fast, sensitive and reliable method for the diagnosis of influenza infections."

Almost 98% of these isolates had emm sequences in agreement with previously recorded M antigen association. We only identified a new 5' emm sequence in 17 isolates. Nine different emm types accounted for 85% of the S. pyogenes isolates susceptible to erythromycin. By contrast, only 3 emm types accounted for 70% of the erythromycin-resistant isolates. Further characterization of these isolates by ribotyping and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis indicated that high frequency of erythromycin resistance in Spain is due to few clones."

New methodology is making possible more incisive research approaches. The defined streptococcal antigens that turn out to be epitopes identical with host tissues, such as the M protein/cardiac myosin model or the hyaluronate in the capsule of mucoid rheumatogenic strains, offer the opportunity for more incisive clinical investigations. The isolation and cultivation of cardiotoxic T cell clones directed against such epitopes shared by host and parasite may eventually be possible.

Patients with ARF and AGN showed a significantly higher geometric mean titer as well as a higher frequency of elevated Ig of the IgG, IgM and IgA A-CHO class antibodies during the acute stage of this disease, when compared to controls. The IgM and IgA geometric means of the antibody were higher in ARF with carditis patients as compared to the non-carditis or AGN patients; however, the differences were not significant.

CD010502,0,3894016,0,Effect of subinhibitory concentrations of josamycin on the expression of M protein by group A streptococci.,"In an attempt to inhibit the biosynthesis of the type-specific M protein usually expressed on surface fimbriae group A Streptococcus pyogenes delta 2305 was cultivated in Todd-Hewitt broth containing 10% human serum and subinhibitory concentrations of either josamycin, erythromycin or clindamycin. Electron microscopy revealed that the antibiotic-pretreatment had little visible effect on the surface structures of the streptococci. However, josamycin and clindamycin-pretreated bacteria adhered less to hydrophobic gels than erythromycin-pretreated or untreated control cultures. Due to the decrease in surface hydrophobicity, the drug-pretreated bacteria also activated complement more readily and fixed more C3 on their surface. Consequently the killing of josamycin and clindamycin-pretreated bacteria by polymorphonuclear leucocytes was significantly enhanced. Similar findings were obtained when the M protein was removed from the bacteria by digestion with trypsin. These results suggest that josamycin, like clindamycin, reverses the capacity of group A streptococci to resist opsonization by normal human serum and interferes with the adhesion of the organisms to host epithelial cell surfaces."
CD010502,0,17522374,0,Nitric oxide and prostaglandin response to group B streptococcal infection in the lung.,"Group B streptococcus (GBS) causes a complex inflammatory process that involves prostaglandins (PG) and nitric oxide (NO). The goal of this study was to examine the inflammatory response to GBS in the lung and the co-regulation of the PG and NO pathways, if any, both in vitro and in vivo. Sprague Dawley rats were treated with various combinations of GBS, aminoguanidine (AG), a selective inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) inhibitor, and L-arginine (LA), a NO donor. The mRNA expression of the COX 2 gene was studied by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) in rat lung tissue. The studies were confirmed in vitro using human lung epithelial (A549) cells treated with GBS, AG, and LA (in combinations similar to the rats) for 3 and 24 hr, after which PG E2 levels in the media were measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). COX 2 mRNA in rat lung tissue was significantly induced by GBS (p = 0.04), an effect that was suppressed by AG (p = 0.02). In the A549 cell line, PG E2 levels increased with GBS treatment at 3 and 24 hr (p <0.001). When AG was added, PG E2 levels were suppressed (p = 0.03) after 24 hr; LA partly reversed the suppression of PG E2 levels (p = 0.039). These data indicate that GBS infection causes significant COX 2 induction and PG E2 synthesis in lung tissue, regulated at least partly by the NO pathway. The interaction between the 2 pathways may play a pathogenic role in GBS lung infections and could be a potential target for pharmacological manipulation."

CD010502,0,8730432,0,Regulation of the C3 production by gamma interferon from peripheral blood T cells in patients with membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis and poststreptococcal acute glomerulonephritis.,"This study assessed the regulatory role of peripheral blood T cells in the C3 production in patients with poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis and branoproliferative glomerulonephritis. Peripheral blood T cells from patients at various stages of disease were cultured and the supernatants tested for gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) content and the capacity to stimulate C3 production by HuH-7 cells. Supernatants from patients with membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis and from convalescent patients with poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis significantly stimulated the C3 production; the degree of stimulation correlated with the IFN-gamma content of the supernatants. Similar results were obtained using recombinant IFN-gamma. In both cases, the effect was blocked by the addition of anti-IFN-gamma monoclonal antibody to the cultures. Interleukin 2 and interleukin 6 levels in supernatants from T cell cultures of patients and controls were essentially the same.

Structural information on the M protein, a dimeric alpha-helical coiled-coil molecule, has come so far from three rheumatogenic serotypes, 5, 6, and 24. However, M proteins from the nephritogenic serotypes have not been well characterized. In the present study, we have isolated a biologically active 20,000 Mr pepsin fragment of type 49 M protein (PepM49), a nephritogenic serotype, and purified it to homogeneity using DEAE-Sephadex and gel filtration. The amino acid composition of PepM49 is similar to those of the rheumatogenic M protein serotypes PepM5, PepM6, and PepM24. However, the sequence of the NH2-terminal 60 residues of PepM49 shows little homology to any of these M protein serotypes, although the latter have significant homology among themselves. Nevertheless, PepM49 exhibits a strong heptad periodicity in its nonpolar residues, suggesting its overall conformational similarity with the other M molecules. During the course of the present studies, Moravek et al. (17) reported the NH2-terminal sequence of another M protein serotype, PepM1, which also does not exhibit much homology with the PepM5, PepM6, and PepM24 proteins. Our analysis of this sequence revealed that the PepM1 protein also exhibits a heptad periodicity of the nonpolar amino acids. A closer examination has revealed that the pattern of heptad periodicity in PepM49 and PepM1 proteins is more regular and more similar to each other than has been previously seen for the PepM5, PepM6, and PepM24 proteins. PepM1 is also a nephritogenic serotype. Taken together, these findings indicate an underlying conservation of the tertiary structure of the various M protein serotypes, despite the complexity in their antigenic variation and suggest that the nephritogenic M protein serotypes M1 and M49 may be further apart evolutionarily from the rheumatogenic serotypes 5, 6, and 24. The distinct differences in the structural features of the PepM1 and PepM49 proteins relative to the PepM5, PepM6, and PepM24 proteins are also suggestive of a correlation with the earlier broader classification of the group A streptococci into rheumatogenic and nephritogenic serotypes."

We investigated the presence of stimulatory DNA motifs in specific group A streptococcal (GAS) genes to elucidate the potential role of DNA in the immunopathogenesis of GAS infections. Despite low GC content in GAS DNA, the emm1 gene encoding the streptococcal M1 protein contained a relatively high frequency of TTCG(T/C), TCGTCG and (G/A)TCGT motifs that preferentially stimulated human lymphocytes. Interestingly, these motifs were also found in genes encoding M-like proteins of group C and G streptococci. ODN copying the emm1 gene sequences harboring these motifs induced the proliferation of human B cells and up-regulated the expression of CD25 on their surface. T cells were not required for the response to the ODN, indicating a direct effect of these motifs on B lymphocytes. Inter-individual variations in responsiveness to ODN were observed, suggesting that host factors potentiate these responses. The finding that GAS DNA contains stimulatory motifs that induce activation of human B cells in a T cell-independent manner suggests that this may be an important mechanism by which the bacteria can target the innate arm of the immune system in the early stages of invasive infections."

CD010502,0,3084162,0,Diagnosis of Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis infections using antigen detection methods.,"Rapid antigen detection methods have great potential value in managing sexually transmitted gonococcal and chlamydial infections. Ideally, such tests should be rapid, technically simple, inexpensive, accurate, and applicable to all sites of infection commonly sampled (cervix, urethra, pharynx). For gonorrhea, the Gram stain fulfills these criteria in men with symptomatic urethritis, but lacks sensitivity when used at other sites or in asymptomatic patients. Antigen detection for gonorrhea would thus be of greatest value in 1) the diagnosis of gonococcal cervical infections in women with mucopurulent cervicitis or pelvic inflammatory disease, 2) the diagnosis of gonococcal proctitis in homosexual men, and 3) in situations requiring lengthy specimen transport. Because culture confirmation of Chlamydia trachomatis infections is not widely available, antigen detection tests could be of great value in management of these infections. Major uses include 1) confirming infection in women with cervicitis, endometritis, and pelvic inflammatory disease; 2) screening for asymptomatic infections in high risk groups of women; and 3) confirmation of Chlamydia trachomatis infections in infants and in adult males. The currently available methods for diagnosis of gonococcal and chlamydial infection by antigen detection are reviewed herein.

Based on the presence or absence of this epitope, GAS are categorized as class I or II, respectively. The objective of this study was to determine whether RF patients have an altered immune response to the class I-specific epitope. Immunoreactivity to class I- and class II-specific epitopes was determined for serum IgG derived from persons with a recent history of acute RF, uncomplicated GAS pharyngitis, and no known recent GAS infection. The results indicate that only RF patients display elevated levels of serum IgG directed towards the class I-specific epitope; they lack immunoreactivity to the class II epitope. The serologic findings strongly suggest that many of the RF patients were recently infected with a class I GAS isolate."

CD010502,0,10569749,0,Group B streptococcal surface proteins as targets for protective antibodies: identification of two novel proteins in strains of serotype V.,"Strains of group B streptococcus (GBS) express surface proteins that confer protective immunity. In particular, most strains of the four classical capsular serotypes (Ia, Ib, II, and III) express either of the Rib and alpha proteins, two members of the same protein family. Here, we report a study of surface proteins expressed by strains of serotype V, which has recently emerged as an important serotype among GBS strains causing serious disease. Two novel GBS proteins were identified, purified, and characterized. One of these proteins, designated Fbs, was immunologically unrelated to other GBS surface proteins. This approximately 110-kDa protein was found in 15 of 49 (31%) type V isolates but in few strains of other serotypes. The Fbs proteins expressed by different strains showed limited variation in size. The most common surface protein among type V strains, found in 29 of 49 (59%) isolates, was designated Rib-like, since it cross-reacted with Rib but was not immunologically identical to Rib. Characterization of this Rib-like protein showed that the N-terminal sequence (12 residues) was identical to that of alpha, although these two proteins lacked cross-reactivity. The biochemical and immunological properties of the Rib-like GBS protein indicate that it is closely related to the R28 protein of Streptococcus pyogenes. Importantly, passive and active immunization experiments with mice showed that the Fbs and Rib-like proteins are targets for protective antibodies. These two proteins are therefore of interest for analysis of pathogenic mechanisms and for vaccine development."

CD010502,0,21852752,0,The M protein of group A Streptococcus is a key virulence factor and a clinically relevant strain identification marker.,"The M protein coats group A streptococci (GAS) and acts as the primary antigen and determinant of type-specific immunity. M is essential for GAS virulence, providing antiphagocytic functions critical to survival in human tissues and fluids. Specific regions of M protein also serve as shared antigens, and cross-reactivity between these epitopes and human proteins may be the source of autoimmune sequelae such as rheumatic heart disease. The M protein is hypervariable, and has long served as the primary target for epidemiological typing of GAS. Though other markers or genotyping methods may be necessary to increase strain resolution when clones of a given M type differ in clinically critical ways, M typing remains the most directly informative and well-documented method for tracking outbreaks of GAS, predicting clinical outcomes during those outbreaks, and measuring the general threat presented by GAS at any given time and place."

The complexes were isolated by polyethylene glycol precipitation and were analyzed for antibodies, antigens, and C-reactive protein. We found the complexes to be enriched in antibody to streptolysin O, particularly in the group of patients with elevated levels of IC. IgM was the predominant class of Ig present in the complexes. Western blots from 12 patients to detect antigens in the complexes showed proteins of m.w. 50,000, 60,000, and 69,000, consistent with the polypeptides of streptolysin O. Such antigens were absent in the complexes from patients with post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis and pharyngitis. Eluted antibodies from these protein bands on the nitrocellulose sheets reacted with the streptolysin O in Western blots and neutralized the hemolytic activity of streptolysin O in a microhemolysin assay. In addition, isolated complexes from several sera showed the presence of C-reactive protein bound to complexes. In vitro experiments demonstrated that [125I]C-reactive protein was not precipitated by polyethylene glycol either alone or when added to monomeric IgG, whereas it precipitated significantly when added to aggregated IgG. The detectable C-reactive protein in isolated complexes and sera samples increased after treatment with sodium dodecyl sulfate. These data suggest that circulating immune complexes in acute rheumatic fever contain streptolysin O and its antibody and raise interesting questions regarding the pathogenetic significance of C-reactive protein in the complexes."
CD010502,0,10456870,0,Fibrinogen cleavage by the Streptococcus pyogenes extracellular cysteine protease and generation of antibodies that inhibit enzyme proteolytic activity.,"The extracellular cysteine protease from Streptococcus pyogenes is a virulence factor that plays a significant role in host-pathogen interaction. Streptococcal protease is expressed as an inactive 40-kDa precursor that is autocatalytically converted into a 28-kDa mature (active) enzyme. Replacement of the single cysteine residue involved in formation of the enzyme active site with serine (C192S mutation) abolished detectable proteolytic activity and eliminated autocatalytic processing of zymogen to the mature form. In the present study, we investigated activity of the wild-type (wt) streptococcal protease toward human fibrinogen and bovine casein. The former is involved in blood coagulation, wound healing, and other aspects of hemostasis. Treatment with streptococcal protease resulted in degradation of the COOH-terminal region of fibrinogen alpha chain, indicating that fibrinogen may serve as an important substrate for this enzyme during the course of human infection. Polyclonal antibodies generated against recombinant 40- and 28-kDa (r40- and r28-kDa) forms of the C192S streptococcal protease mutant exhibited high enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay titers but demonstrated different inhibition activities toward proteolytic action of the wt enzyme. Activity of the wt protease was readily inhibited when the reaction was carried out in the presence of antibodies generated against r28-kDa C192S mutant. Antibodies produced against r40-kDa C192S mutant had no significant effect on proteolysis. These data suggest that the presence of the NH(2)-terminal prosegment prevents generation of functionally active antibodies and indicate that inhibition activity of antibodies most likely depends on their ability to bind the active-site region epitope(s) of the protein."
CD010502,0,16943383,0,Regulation of the tonsil cytokine milieu favors HIV susceptibility.,"Mucosal associated lymphoid tissues are major targets of HIV during early infection and disease progression but can also provide a viral safe haven during highly active antiretroviral therapy. Among these tissues, the tonsils remain enigmatic regarding their status as primary and/or secondary sites of retroviral infection. To dissect the mechanisms underlying susceptibility to HIV in this compartment, isolated tonsil cells were studied for phenotypic and functional characteristics, which may account for their permissiveness to infection. For this, tonsil cells and PBMC were infected in parallel with HIV, and viral replication was monitored by p24 ELISA. Our results demonstrate that unstimulated tonsil cells were more readily infected than PBMC with HIV. Phenotypic characterization of the tonsil cells revealed heterogeneous lymphoid populations but with increased expression of early activation markers and the viral co-receptor CXCR4, relative to PBMC, all of which may contribute to viral susceptibility. Furthermore, the cytokine microenvironment appeared to be key in facilitating HIV infection and tonsil-secreted products enhanced HIV infection in PBMC. Of the cytokines detected in the tonsil supernatants, TH2 cytokines, particularly IL-4, promoted HIV infection and replication. Interestingly, this TH2 profile appeared to dominate, even in the presence of the TH1 cytokine IFNgamma and the anti-viral factor IFNalpha, likely due to the enhanced expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) proteins, which may disengage IFN signaling. These and other local environmental factors may render tonsil cells increasingly susceptible to HIV infection."
CD010502,0,11317941,0,A cluster of positively charged amino acids in the alpha-chain of C4b-binding protein (C4BP) is pivotal for the regulation of the complement system and the interaction with bacteria.,"C4b-binding protein (C4BP) is a potent inhibitor of the classical pathway of complement. Structural analysis of our 3D model of the C4BP alpha-chain suggested that a cluster of positively charged amino acids at the interface between complement control protein (CCP) modules 1 and 2 could be involved in ligand binding. Nine C4BP mutants, where the positively charged amino acids were changed to glutamines, were expressed. We found that all of these displayed lower apparent affinity for C4b and that the site was also a specific heparin-binding site. The mutants demonstrated decreased ability to serve as factor I cofactors in a degradation of C4b. Also, their capacity to prevent the assembly of C3-convertase and to accelerate its decay were decreased. In conclusion, we found a binding site on C4BP that is functionally important for the regulation of C3-convertase. Many strains of Streptococcus pyogenes bind C4BP, via surface M proteins, which plays an important role in pathogenesis. Using the set of C4BP mutants we identified a key recognition surface for M proteins which overlaps with the C4b-binding site. The analysis of all mutants and inhibition with monoclonal antibodies indicated that the binding sites for C4b and M proteins are only overlapping but not identical. Furthermore, we found that the molecular mechanisms involved in these two interactions differ, since the binding between M proteins and C4BP is relatively insensitive to salt in contrast to the C4BP-C4b-binding. We suggest that binding between C4b and C4BP is governed mostly by electrostatic interactions, while additional non-covalent forces cause tight binding of C4BP to streptococcal M proteins."

The ability to servive in normal human blood dropped from a growth index of 52 after the first passage to 1 after four passages. After 14 passages the growth index increased again and stabilized above 30. The virulence for mice increased from a LD100 of 10(8) colony forming units (CFU) to 10-100 CFU after 7 passages and then remained constant. The Mqw antigen disappeared after 4 passages as tested by immunodiffusion, electroimmunoassay and indirect bactericidal tests. Three antisera, raised in rabbits against strains originally belonging to types M3, M12 and M46 but devoid of type antigens after mouse passages showed high bactericidal indices against the 1800 strain after 14 or more passages on mice. Anti-type M1 serum was also found bactericidal for the passaged strains. The IgG Fc-receptor activity of the strain isolated after each mouse passage was tested in hemagglutination experiments with human red blood cells coated with ""incomplete"" anti-Rh and hot hydrochloric acid extracts of the strains. The capacity to agglutinate ""Ripley""-coated cells increased gradually during the first 12 passages and subsequently the titres of the extracts stabilized between 1:160 and 1:320. The HUN coat, useful for detection of the G3m (5) maraker gave titraes increasing with the number of passages while the titres for IgG1 coats kept at 1:4 or below. On background of these results, the possible role of the IgG Fc-receptor as a virulence factor is discussed."
CD010502,0,19158266,0,Clinical and microbiological characteristics of severe Streptococcus pyogenes disease in Europe.,"In an attempt to compare the epidemiology of severe Streptococcus pyogenes infection within Europe, prospective data were collected through the Strep-EURO program. Surveillance for severe cases of S. pyogenes infection diagnosed during 2003 and 2004 was undertaken in 11 countries across Europe by using a standardized case definition and questionnaire. Patient data as well as bacterial isolates were collected and characterized by T and M/emm typing, and selected strains were analyzed for the presence of superantigen genes. Data were analyzed to compare the clinical and microbiological patterns of the infections across the participating countries. A total of 4,353 isolates were collected from 5,521 cases with severe S. pyogenes infections who were identified. A wide diversity of M/emm types (n = 104) was found among the S. pyogenes clinical isolates, but the M/emm type distribution varied broadly between participating countries. The 10 most predominant M/emm types were M/emm type 1 (M/emm1), M/emm28, M/emm3, M/emm89, M/emm87, M/emm12, M/emm4, M/emm83, M/emm81, and M/emm5, in descending order. A correlation was found between some specific disease manifestations, the age of the patients, and the emm types. Although streptococcal toxic shock syndrome and necrotizing fasciitis were caused by a large number of types, they were particularly associated with M/emm1 and M/emm3. The emm types included in the 26-valent vaccine under development were generally well represented in the present material; 16 of the vaccine types accounted for 69% of isolates. The Strep-EURO collaborative program has contributed to enhancement of the knowledge of the spread of invasive disease caused by S. pyogenes within Europe and encourages future surveillance by the notification of cases and the characterization of strains, which are important for vaccination strategies and other health care issues."
CD010502,0,10603375,0,Strain-specific restriction of the antiphagocytic property of group A streptococcal M proteins.,"Group A streptococcal M proteins are type-specific virulence factors that inhibit phagocytosis. We used two M proteins, M5 and Emm22, to analyze the influence of genetic background on the properties of M proteins. Mutant strains, engineered to lack these M proteins, were complemented with genes encoding the homologous or heterologous M protein, and the complemented strains were analyzed for phagocytosis resistance. Neither the M5 nor the Emm22 protein conferred phagocytosis resistance in the heterologous background, but they did do so in the homologous background. This was not due to lack of surface expression in the heterologous background. Moreover, the M5 and Emm22 proteins expressed in heterologous background appeared to have normal structure, since they were not affected in their ability to bind different human plasma proteins. In particular, M5 or Emm22 had normal ability to bind human complement inhibitors, a property that has been implicated in phagocytosis resistance. Results similar to those obtained with M5 and Emm22 were obtained in experiments with the M6 and Emm4 proteins. Together, these data suggest that the surface expression of M protein alone may not be sufficient to confer phagocytosis resistance and consequently that strain-specific factors other than M and Emm proteins may contribute to the ability of group A streptococci to resist phagocytosis."
CD010502,0,14734754,0,HLA class II polymorphisms determine responses to bacterial superantigens.,"The excessive immunological response triggered by microbial superantigens has been implicated in the etiology of a wide range of human diseases but has been most clearly defined for the staphylococcal and streptococcal toxic shock syndromes. Because MHC class II presentation of superantigens to T cells is not MHC-restricted, the possibility that HLA polymorphisms could influence superantigenicity, and thus clinical susceptibility to the toxicity of individual superantigens, has received little attention. In this study, we demonstrate that binding of streptococcal and staphylococcal superantigens to HLA class II is influenced by allelic differences in class II. For the superantigen streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin A, class II binding is dependent on DQ alpha-chain polymorphisms such that HLA-DQA1*01 alpha-chains show greater binding than DQA1*03/05 alpha-chains. The functional implications of differential binding on T cell activation were investigated in various experimental systems using human T cells and murine Vbeta8.2 transgenic cells as responders. These studies showed quantitative and qualitative differences resulting from differential HLA-DQ binding. We observed changes in T cell proliferation and cytokine production, and in the Vbeta specific changes in T cell repertoire that have hitherto been regarded as a defining feature of an individual superantigen. Our observations reveal a mechanism for the different outcomes seen following infection by toxigenic bacteria."

T lymphocytes specific for streptococcal antigens or expressing a restricted, for streptococcal superantigens typical T cell receptor Vbeta chain repertoire have been described in psoriatic skin lesions. The aim of our study was, therefore, to clarify whether streptococci-reactive T lymphocytes played a role in the pathogenesis of psoriatic arthritis (PsA), and by which antigens they might be stimulated. Synovial membrane mononuclear cells from patients with PsA and other arthropathies, separated by collagenase digestion, were expanded in interleukin-2-supplemented medium and subsequently cloned in a representative cloning procedure. The T cell lines and about 30% of the T cell clones proliferated in response to preparations of group A streptococci but not to other bacteria as tested by [3H]thymidine incorporation assays. Interestingly, they did not proliferate in response to exotoxin-negative streptococci, but did so in response to the streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins A and C, which are known to be superantigens. Accordingly, no HLA-DR restriction was seen for the proliferative response. The remaining 70% of the established T cell clones did not react to an antigen of group A streptococci. Our results show that in patients with PsA, osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis a significant number of synovial T lymphocytes were responsive to streptococcal superantigens, but not to conventional streptococcal antigens. A disease-specific role of streptococci-reactive T lymphocytes in the pathogenesis of PsA is, therefore, unlikely."

The following parameters were investigated: (i) the limits of detection (LoDs) for four MRSA strains; (ii) the ability to detect isolates of MRSA from a collection representative of MRSA in Ireland since 1974 (n = 114) and the ability to detect control strains with staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec types IVa (IV.1.1.1), IVb (IV.2.1.1), IVc (IV.3.1.1), IVd (IV.4.1.1), V (V.1.1.1), V(T), and VI; and (iii) performance in a clinical trial with swabs from nose, throat, and groin/perineum sites from 204 patients, where results were compared with those obtained by direct and enrichment cultures. The average LoD of the four test strains was 610 CFU/ml (equivalent to 58 CFU/swab). All 114 MRSA isolates and 7 control strains tested were detected. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values for clinical specimens from all sites investigated were 90%, 97%, 86%, and 98%, respectively, but throat specimens yielded poor sensitivity (75%). Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values for nasal specimens were 95%, 98%, 90%, and 99%, respectively. Overall, the assay was rapid and easy to perform, but performance might be enhanced by the inclusion of an equivocal interpretive category based on analysis of all available amplification data."
CD010502,0,3325899,0,Changes in expression of bacterial surface antigens induced by antibiotics and their influence on host defenses.,"Concomitant with the discovery that a number of antibiotics were able to induce profound morphological changes (increased septation, thickened walls, filamentation) at low concentrations their ability to inhibit bacterial protein/polysaccharide synthesis was determined. In particular toxin and extracellular enzyme biosynthesis could be repressed by the lincosamines, fusidic acid, erythromycin and streptomycin in Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Propionibacterium acnes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli. Several of these exoproducts act as antigens associated with microbial virulence and are therefore of importance in pathogenicity. Likewise structural components such as fimbriae in Escherichia coli, M protein in Streptococcus pyogenes, protein A in Staphylococcus aureus and capsule in Bacteroides fragilis and Haemophilus influenzae were not synthesised when the producer bacteria were grown in low concentrations of antibiotic. These products, through their importance as impedins of opsonization and subsequent phagocytosis by white blood cells, are important determinants in the host-parasite relationship. By their loss during drug exposure, potentiation of opsonophagocytosis occurred leading to more rapid killing of the pathogen. The immunogenicity of the antibiotic-damaged bacteria was also changed under these circumstances."

CD010502,0,1754745,1,Streptococcal throat infection: calculation of test standards and a comparison between an antigen detection test and culture.,"The standard minimum sensitivity (94%) and minimum specificity (89%) of a group A streptococcus (GAS) test were calculated, assuming that no more than 10% false positive and no more than 2% false negative test results should be allowed. The clinical judgement of the need for immediate antibiotic treatment in tonsillitis/pharyngitis was an unreliable indicator of a GAS aetiology, 20-29% of the results being false positive and 2-10% false negative. The rapid antigen detection test Tandem Icon Strep A was not sensitive enough to be used as a single test, though it was specific enough. The sensitivity of culture almost reached the standard demand. Two combinations of rapid test and culture (sequence testing) were superior to the rapid test, but were not significantly better than culture."
CD010502,0,7615768,1,Comparison of two rapid streptococcal antigen detection assays with culture for diagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis.,"In this study, 801 pharyngeal specimens were cultured for group A streptococci and tested with the Biostar Strep A Optical Immunoassay (Strep A OIA). The respective sensitivities and specificities were as follows: culture, 97.1 and 100%; Strep A OIA, 91.5 and 94.8%. Of the 801 specimens, 597 were also tested with the Abbott TestPack Strep A Assay (TP-ST). For those specimens tested by all three methods, the respective sensitivities and specificities were as follows: culture, 98.1 and 100%; Strep A OIA, 92.3 and 95.4%; and TP-ST, 79.4 and 100%. The Strep A OIA is significantly more sensitive than TP-ST and compares favorably with culture."

Fourteen isolates were identified as Streptococcus oralis, five as S. mitis and two as S. salivarius but the remaining two could not be identified reliably. The virulence mechanisms associated with the ability of these species to survive and grow in vivo require further investigation but may involve the production of specific glycosidase and proteolytic enzyme activities."
CD010502,0,15119368,0,Excessive use of rapid tests in respiratory tract infections in Swedish primary health care.,"A 1-y retrospective study of problem oriented electronic patient records, for encounters concerning respiratory tract infection, was performed. The aim was to analyse the management of respiratory tract infections in primary health care in terms of diagnostic coding, tests and antibiotic treatment using data from electronic patient records. 12 primary health care centres with a registered population of 102,050 residents in 3 counties in southeast Sweden participated. Data were retrieved electronically from records of patient encounters concerning respiratory tract infections. The data were: patient age and gender, date of contact, diagnostic code, CRP and GABHS tests and results, as well as antibiotic prescriptions. In a total of 19,965 encounters, the most frequent diagnoses were common cold (40%), acute tonsillitis (18%), and acute bronchitis (15%). A total of 4445 GABHS tests (in 22% of encounters) and 6141 CRP tests (31%) were performed, and both tests were done in 1910 encounters (10%). A total of 7934 antibiotic prescriptions were registered. The proportion of patients tested and prescribed an antibiotic varied greatly between centres. We found an excessive, and much varying, use of rapid tests in encounters for respiratory tract infections. Data retrieval from electronic patient record systems was a feasible method to study the use of laboratory tests in relation to pharmacological treatment."
CD010502,0,10469066,0,Is an epitope on keratin 17 a major target for autoreactive T lymphocytes in psoriasis?,"Psoriasis is a T cell-mediated inflammatory skin disease that has been associated with infections by group A beta-haemolytic streptococci. In a previous study of patients with active psoriasis we demonstrated an increased frequency of circulating Th1-like cells that responded to 20 amino acid (aa) streptococcal M-peptides sharing sequences with human keratin. These cells disappeared after ultraviolet B (UVB)-induced clinical remission. Using T cells from the blood of 17 psoriatic patients and 17 healthy controls we have now compared the numbers of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)-producing cells induced by seven 18-20 aa keratin peptides and five corresponding M-peptides. The most frequent and strongest responses were observed to a peptide from keratin 17 that shares ALEEAN sequence with M-protein. The responses to this peptide were stronger than to the corresponding M-peptide containing the ALEEAN sequence. After UVB treatment T cell responses to all the M- and keratin peptides were abolished, while responses to the positive control antigen streptokinase/streptodornase (SK/SD) were not affected. These findings are consistent with the notion that aa sequences which keratin has in common with M-protein may be a major target for autoreactive T cells in psoriasis."

CD010502,0,2129625,0,Streptococcus mutans and the problem of heart cross-reactivity.,"Investigations of immune responses to Streptococcus mutans have fostered consideration of vaccination as a possible preventive measure against dental caries. However, the finding that hyperimmune rabbit antisera to S. mutans sometimes give immunofluorescent reactions on human heart raised concerns over safety, especially as most individuals display circulating antibodies to this common oral organism. Recent progress in elucidating the molecular mechanisms of the well-established immunological cross-reactivity between group A streptococci and human heart tissue and the structure of S. mutans antigens permits a re-evaluation of this problem. This review examines the evidence for heart cross-reactivity induced by S. mutans in relation to studies on group A streptococci and current understanding of autoimmunity. Although the mechanisms involved in this phenomenon need further clarification, it now appears that it cannot be ascribed to antigenic similarity between heart tissue and a high-molecular-weight surface protein antigen of S. mutans."
CD010502,0,3486089,0,Use of rapidly generated results in patient management.,"The usefulness of a rapid diagnostic test in patient management depends on the sensitivity of the test, the clinical consequences of false-negative or false-positive results, the ease and cost of performance, and the timely availability of results. A test that is sensitive, specific, inexpensive, and rapid is presumed to be useful clinically. However, there has been surprisingly little effort to measure the actual impact of the results on patient care. Since antigen detection for Haemophilus influenzae type b disease has been available for more than a decade, it will be used as a model to illustrate several factors that help determine the benefits, limitations, and pitfalls of antigen detection in the management of patients with serious bacterial infections. Herein we will compare the use of antigen detection in meningitis with that in other Haemophilus influenzae type b diseases. We also will review our experience with the impact of rapid diagnosis on the treatment of bacterial meningitis. Finally, other factors that influence the usefulness of antigen detection on patient care will be explored by comparing the potential consequences of laboratory error on the management of patients with Haemophilus influenzae type b infections with that of management of other kinds of infections, such as streptococcal pharyngitis, sexually transmitted diseases, and viral respiratory infections."
CD010502,0,11060079,0,"Analysis of immunoreactivity to a Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus M-like protein To confirm an outbreak of poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis, and sequences of M-like proteins from isolates obtained from different host species.","The etiologic agent of a large 1998 outbreak of poststreptococcal acute glomerulonephritis (PSGN) in Nova Serrana, Brazil, was found likely to be a specific strain of Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus from contaminated cheese (S. Balter et al., Lancet 355:1776-1780, 2000). In the present study, we used a serologic screen for a known surface-exposed virulence factor to confirm the epidemiologic findings. Using primers flanking a previously characterized M-like protein gene (J. F. Timoney et al., Infect. Immun. 63:1440-1445, 1995), we amplified and sequenced the M-like protein (designated Szp5058) gene and found it to be identical among four independent acute-phase PSGN patient isolates. Convalescent-phase sera from 33 of 44 patients in the PSGN outbreak were found to contain antibodies highly reactive to a purified Szp5058 fusion protein, compared with 1 of 17 control sera (P < 0. 0001), suggesting that Szp5058 was expressed during infection and further implicating this strain as the cause of the PSGN outbreak. The predicted signal sequence and cell wall association motif of Szp5058 were highly conserved with the corresponding sequence from S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus SzpW60, while the predicted surface-exposed portions differed markedly between these two proteins. The 5' end of the szp5058 gene, including its variable region, was identical to the szp gene from another strain associated with a previous PSGN outbreak in England (M. Barham et al., Lancet i:945-948, 1983), and the corresponding szp sequence found from the Lancefield group C type strain isolated from a guinea pig. In addition, the hypervariable (HV) portion of szp5058 was identical to a previously published HV sequence from a horse isolate (J. A. Walker and J. F. Timoney, Am. J. Vet. Res. 59:1129-1133, 1998). Three other strains of S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus, including another strain previously associated with a PSGN outbreak, were each found to contain a distinct szp gene. Two of these szp genes had HV regions identical to szp regions from isolates recovered from different host species."
CD010502,0,10816507,0,Genetic relatedness and superantigen expression in group A streptococcus serotype M1 isolates from patients with severe and nonsevere invasive diseases.,"The relatedness of group A streptococcal (GAS) strains isolated from 35 Canadian patients with invasive disease of different severity was investigated by a variety of molecular methods. All patients were infected with M1T1 strains and, based on clinical criteria, were classified as severe (n = 21) and nonsevere (n = 14) invasive GAS infection cases. All the M1 strains studied had the emm1.0 allele and the same streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin (Spe) genotype, speA(+) speB(+) speC speF(+) speG(+) speH smeZ(+) ssa. All isolates had the same speA allotype, speA2. The randomly amplified polymorphic DNA banding pattern with two different primers was identical for all strains, and pulsed field gel electrophoresis analysis showed that 33 and 30 isolates had identical banding patterns after DNA digestion with SfiI or SmaI, respectively; the nonidentical isolates differed from the main pattern by only one band. A relatively high degree of polymorphism in specific regions of the sic gene was observed among isolates; however, this polymorphism was not associated with disease severity. Likewise, although the phenotypic expression of SpeA, SpeB, and SpeF proteins varied among the M1T1 isolates, there was no correlation between the amount of Spe expressed and disease severity. Importantly, mitogenic and cytokine responses induced by partially purified bacterial culture supernatants containing a mixture of expressed superantigens were very similar for isolates from severe and nonsevere cases (P > 0.1). Together, the data indicate that highly related invasive M1T1 isolates, some indistinguishable, can cause disease of varying severity in different individuals. These findings underscore the contribution of host factors to the outcome of invasive GAS infections."

A rapid screening method is required to identify carriage of GBS in pregnant women at the time of delivery. In order to detect GBS in vaginal specimens, the efficiency of the standard culture versus fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) was investigated. In 258 examined vaginal specimens, FISH identified 58 of the 59 GBS-positive samples (98.3%), whereas by means of standard culture only 38 specimens were positive (64.4%). We recommend FISH as a rapid, specific, highly sensitive screening technique for the detection of GBS in pregnant women at delivery."
CD010502,0,4042439,0,Significance of endostreptosin antibody titers in poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis.,"Endostreptosin (ESS) is an immunologically well defined cytoplasmic antigen of group A and some group C streptococci. ESS is probably the pathogenetic antigen of poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (ASGN). Antibodies to ESS (ESS-Ab) were determined by microcomplement fixation in 1,102 patients and by ELISA in 105 patients. In 168 patients with ASGN (90 from the U.S.A. and 78 from Kuwait) the arithmetic mean titer was 45.2 (log10 1.40 +/- 0.606) and 50.2 (log10 1.51 +/- 0.394) respectively, both significantly elevated compared to 347 age matched children and adults from the U.S.A. whose arithmetic mean titer was 9.1 (log10 0.83 +/- 0.635) and 7.5 (log10 0.55 +/- 0.492) respectively and 139 children from Kuwait whose arithmetic mean titer was 15.7 (log10 0.92 +/- 0.495). In 51 patients with ASGN, the mean ELISA value was 67.5% higher than the values obtained from 54 normal age matched controls. Patients with streptococcal infections without renal involvement had only transiently and mildly elevated values. ESS-Abs in patients with other types of glomerulonephritides were in the range of normal. ESS-Ab titers do not parallel the titers of streptococcal exoenzymes. ESS-Ab titers are of importance for the differential diagnosis of renal diseases and of similar significance for the understanding of the pathogenetic mechanism of ASGN. They are possibly of significance for therapy in the form of an active vaccine."

CD010502,0,8582136,0,Detection of group B Streptococcus by immunoassay following enrichment in LIM-selective broth medium.,"Rapid immunoassays have been developed to decrease the time to detection of Group B Streptococcus (GBS) carriage in pregnant women. In this study, a total of 162 pregnant women, considered to be high-risk obstetric patients, were seen in the Family Care Center at Memorial Hospital of Rhode Island, a 300-bed teaching hospital associated with Brown University Medical School. Vaginal and rectal specimens were taken and tested for GBS by using two rapid enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) that were compared with culture. Quidel and Hybritech ICON Group B strep tests were run following 4 h incubation in the selective enrichment LIM Group B strep broth; cultures were done both directly and after enrichment. Results with both EIAs were identical, with overall sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of 38%, 98%, 88%, and 84% respectively. However, when women having positive cultures were separated into moderately to heavily colonized (> or = 3 +) and lightly colonized (< or = 2 +) populations, the sensitivities were 82% and 19%, respectively. Although GBS assays are useful in the rapid diagnosis of heavily colonized women, culture following enrichment remains the most sensitive method for a lightly colonized population."
CD010502,0,3058803,0,Fc region-dependence of IgG3 anti-streptococcal group A carbohydrate antibody functional affinity. I. The effect of temperature.,"Previous studies have demonstrated that IgG3 anti-streptococcal group A carbohydrate (GAC) mAb bind to the surfaces of heat-killed, pepsin-digested group A streptococcal cells in an Fc region-dependent cooperative manner. This form of positive cooperative binding of antibody to Ag was hypothesized to result from noncovalent association of Fc regions of antibodies bound close to one another on the Ag surface. Because IgG3 Fc regions are self-aggregating and IgG3 molecules are frequently cryoprecipitable, we have now investigated the effect of temperature on the binding, and cooperative binding, of IgG3 anti-GAC mAb to solid-phase (sp) Ag. The Ag used was a covalent conjugate of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc; the epitopes on GAC) and BSA. The main findings were: 1) IgG3 anti-GAC mAb bind to sp GlcNAc-BSA to greater extents at lower temperatures, 2) IgM anti-GAC mAb and Fab and F(ab')2 fragments, derived from an IgG3 anti-GAC mAb, bind to sp GlcNAc-BSA to comparable extents at different temperatures, 3) idiotope-expressing IgG3 anti-GAC mAb bind to sp anti-idiotope to comparable extents at different temperatures, and 4) unlabeled IgG3 anti-GAC mAb enhance the binding of radiolabeled IgG3 anti-GAC mAb to sp GlcNAc-BSA, and the degree of this enhancement is greater at lower temperature. These, and additional results, support the conclusion that for some sp Ag the functional affinities of IgG3 antibodies, are influenced by the Fc region in a temperature-dependent manner."

A rapid detection system enabling early therapeutic intervention is therefore desirable. A commercial kit (Wellcome Diagnostics Reveal Colour Strep A) was evaluated in a burns unit. Two separate studies were undertaken. The first compared two swabs taken from a particular burn site, one of which was cultured conventionally and the other processed for rapid detection. In the second study, swabs were processed routinely and then subjected to the rapid detection test in order to assess reproducibility of results. In our hands the rapid test was easy to perform and correlated well with conventional culture. We recommend the use of a rapid detection system for S. pyogenes as a useful adjunct to conventional culture methods."

CD010502,0,11770023,0,Marginal zone B cell lymphomas of Waldeyer's ring--a report of two tonsillectomy cases resembling histomorphological features of inflammatory lesions.,"We identified two cases of lymphoma of the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) type in 11 tonsillectomy specimens of primary B cell lymphoma of Waldeyer's ring. Both patients were Japanese females presenting with bilateral enlargement of the palatine tonsils. One had a history of chronic otitis media. In that case, the lesion was characterized by an extrafollicular growth pattern with marginal zone-like arrangement. The tumor was mainly composed of medium-sized cells with round or indented nuclei with scant cytoplasm (centrocyte-like cells). In the other patient, most tumor cells were mature plasma cells, plasmacytoid cells, proplasmacytes, and immunoblasts with scattered centrocyte-like cells. Tropism of tumor cells for the epithelium was noted in both lesions. Primary marginal zone B cell lymphoma of the MALT type arising from Waldeyer's ring has rarely been reported in the literature, causing certain diagnostic problems. Various florid reactive lymphoproliferative disorders, including chronic tonsillitis and infectious mononucleosis, should be differentiated from this type of primary Waldeyer's ring lymphoma."
CD010502,0,8332063,0,Structural heterogeneity of the emm gene cluster in group A streptococci.,"One or more distinct copies of emm genes lie within a gene cluster that is located downstream from a transcriptional regulatory gene (mry). Mry is a positive regulator for the genes in this cluster and for the downstream gene, scpA. The objective of this study is to examine the structure of this cluster and the distribution of specific alleles within the cluster among group A streptococcal isolates of 32 different serotypes. The peptidoglycan (PG)-spanning domain, which exists in four divergent forms, was used to identify specific alleles of the genes within the emm cluster. Gene content of the cluster was determined by Southern hybridization with allele-specific oligonucleotides. Five different chromosomal patterns for this cluster were observed. Sequence heterogeneity in the adjacent mry locus was demonstrated by the ability of some of the isolates to hybridize with a whole mry gene probe, but not with mry-based oligonucleotide probes. A PCR-based chromosomal mapping technique was used to examine further the gene order within the emm gene clusters. Structural heterogeneity of the emm gene cluster was found within class I isolates in this study, while class II isolates were relatively homogeneous at this chromosomal locus and distinct from class I."

CD010502,0,6415061,0,Repeating covalent structure and protective immunogenicity of native and synthetic polypeptide fragments of type 24 streptococcal M protein. Mapping of protective and nonprotective epitopes with monoclonal antibodies.,"The complete amino acid sequences of three cyanogen bromide peptide fragments (CB3, CB4, and CB50 of type 24 M protein extracted from Streptococcus pyogenes by limited pepsin digestion were determined by automated Edman degradation of the uncleaved peptides and their tryptic peptides. CB3 and CB4 each contain 35 amino acid residues, whereas CB5 contains 37. The sequence of CB3 was found to be: (formula: see text) (where Hse represents homoserine). The sequence of CB4 was identical except for amino acid substitutions of arginine and glutamine at positions 23 and 24, respectively. The sequence of CB5 also was identical with that of CB3 except for substitutions of aspartic acids at positions 28 and 29; leucine, glutamic acid, and glycine at positions 33, 34, and 35, respectively; and an additional two amino acids, alanine and homoserine, at positions 36 and 37, respectively. A comparison of the structures of these three peptide fragments with those previously reported for CB6 and CB7 revealed as few as one to six amino acid substitutions among the five repeating peptides; CB4 and CB6 differed only by a single Asp/Glu substitution at position 26. When covalently linked to polylysine and injected as an emulsion in complete Freund's adjuvant, CB3, CB4, and CB5 each evoked high titers of type-specific opsonic and bactericidal antibodies in rabbits. A chemically synthesized peptide identical with native CB3 except that it contained methionine instead of homoserine at its COOH terminus was similarly immunogenic. None of the conjugated native or synthetic peptides raised antibodies at reacted in immunofluorescence tests with sarcolemmal membranes of human heart tissue. Mapping studies with monoclonal antibodies revealed a number of distinct protective and nonprotective epitopes. The single Asp/Glu substitution between CB4 and CB4 rendered the 35-residue peptide unrecognizable by protective monoclonal antibodies but recognizable by a nonprotective one. Our studies demonstrate that the repeating covalent structures of native and chemically synthesized polypeptide fragments of streptococcal M protein possess several unique as well as repeating epitopes that evoke opsonic and presumably protective, but not heart cross-reactive, antibodies against a rheumatogenic strain of S. pyogenes."

CD010502,0,8243043,1,Comparison of direct specimen testing utilizing TestPack strep A with testing of specimens following a two-hour broth enrichment.,"In a previous study, we demonstrated that a 2-h enrichment of throat swabs in broth followed by a direct fluorescent antibody test was significantly more sensitive than the Abbott TestPack Strep A for the detection of group-A streptococci. In this study, in an effort to simplify the technique, we utilized broth enrichment with an enzyme immunoassay detection method. A total of 1017 pharyngeal specimens were tested with TestPack Strep A (DTP), culture on a selective streptococcal agar, and a 2-h broth enrichment in Todd-Hewitt broth (THB) followed by TestPack Strep A (ETP). Subculture of the THB was used to arbitrate discordant test results. The sensitivities and specificities respectively were as follows: DTP (69% and 99%), ETP (90% and 98%), and SSA (97% and 100%). This enrichment method offers significantly greater sensitivity than direct testing for antigen yet still allows the potential for finalized same-day reporting of results."

Previous studies have reported an antigen test sensitivity of 55-95% and a specificity of 88-100%. The present study evaluates the reliability of one rapid test in detecting GABHS (PathoDx). A total of 164 throat swab specimens was taken. GABHS was isolated on the culture in 37 (22.5%), and the rapid test was positive in 60 (36.6%). The sensitivity of the rapid test was 86.5% and the specificity 80%. Of the 60 positive rapid test results, 28 (47%) were false positive and the positive predicted value was 53%. We conclude that results obtained using rapid test kits should be compared to throat cultures in order to determine the reliability of such kits in specific clinical settings."
CD010502,0,6392594,0,Comparative study of streptococcal DNase by rapid and quantitative assay systems.,"Clinical isolates of group A, B, and G streptococci were compared in regard to their extracellular deoxyribonuclease (DNase) activities by the modified assay system for DNase using DNA-methyl green complex as a substrate. DNase activity in a culture supernatant of each strain was measured as a percent decrease in the substrate-specific absorbance at 640 nm. After 1 hr incubation, DNase activities in all the strains of group A streptococci were found to be markedly higher than those of any strain in the other groups, although the DNase activities in groups B and G were considerably heterogeneous. These findings were also seen when commercially available DNA-dye complex reagent for the determination of anti-DNase B antibody titer was used as a substrate in the assay system. Our results suggest that this newly established assay system could be applicable for the rapid measurement of DNase activity to distinguish group A streptococci from the other groups."

It spreads rapidly along fascial planes causing extensive necrosis; it often results in gangrene of the overlying skin. Mostly involved are immunodeficient patients with banal infections of the upper aerodigestive tract, small traumas, but also after surgical procedures.

The mortality is about 20%-50% dependent on the localisation of this soft tissue infection."
CD010502,0,11854196,0,Genomic localization of a T serotype locus to a recombinatorial zone encoding extracellular matrix-binding proteins in Streptococcus pyogenes.,"Streptococcus pyogenes is an important bacterial pathogen afflicting humans. A striking feature is its extraordinary biological diversity, evident in the wide range of diseases it can cause and the antigenic heterogeneity present on its surface. The T antigens form the basis of a major serological typing scheme that is often used as an alternative or supplement to M typing. Unlike M typing, the genetic basis for T typing is poorly understood. In this report, the tee6 gene is localized to a position approximately equal to 3.3 kb downstream from prtF1 (or sfbI), which encodes the Fn-binding protein, protein F, a key virulence factor. Comparison of this portion of the genome with those of four additional strains reveals the presence of genes encoding a collagen-binding protein (Cpa) and a second Fn-binding protein (PrtF2 or PfbpI). This chromosomal region--here designated the FCT region--is approximately 11 to 16 kb in length and is flanked at both ends by long stretches of highly conserved sequence. For each of the five strains, the FCT region contains a unique combination of semiconserved loci, indicative of extensive intergenomic recombination. The data provide evidence that the highly recombinatorial FCT region of the S. pyogenes genome is under strong selection for change in response to the host environment."

CD010502,0,17293014,0,Comparative in silico analysis of two vaccine candidates for group A streptococcus predicts that they both may have similar safety profiles.,"Concerns of immune cross-reactivity, between epitopes of the group A streptococcal (GAS) M-proteins and host proteins have hindered the progress of an effective GAS vaccine. An ideal M-protein based subunit vaccine should not elicit heart tissue cross-reactive antibody responses and should not activate M-protein specific CD4+ T-cells. In the current study we used a bioinformatic and immunoinformatic approach to assess the safety of J8 and J14, chimeric vaccine constructs containing a GAS derived M-protein epitope embedded in flanking GCN4 region. We demonstrate that at the primary amino acid level J8 and J14 show very little homology to human proteins. ProPred, RANKPEP and HLABIND algorithms failed to predict significant binding between the M-protein specific regions of J8 and J14 and class II binding alleles. A single peptide was predicted to bind to HLA class I allele B_2705. This data was supported by cellular proliferation assays demonstrating few peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from donors respond to J8 and J14. Reassuringly, there was no correlation between proliferation to these peptides, and proliferation to host proteins. This data suggests that J8 and J14 are unlikely to induce cross-reactive immune responses, and will be safe for use in humans."

CD010502,0,12193726,0,The bacterial superantigen streptococcal mitogenic exotoxin Z is the major immunoactive agent of Streptococcus pyogenes.,"The gene encoding streptococcal mitogenic exotoxin Z (SMEZ) was disrupted in Streptococcus pyogenes. Despite the presence of other superantigen genes, mitogenic responses in human and murine HLA-DQ transgenic cells were abrogated when cells were stimulated with supernatant from the smez(-) mutant compared with the parent strain. Remarkably, disruption of smez led to a complete inability to elicit cytokine production (TNF-alpha, lymphotoxin-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL-1 and -8) from human cells, when cocultured with streptococcal supernatants. The potent effects of SMEZ were apparent even though transcription and expression of SMEZ were barely detectable. Human Vbeta8(+) T cell proliferation in response to S. pyogenes was SMEZ-dependent. Cells from HLA-DQ8 transgenic mice were 3 logs more sensitive to SMEZ-13 than cells from HLA-DR1 transgenic or wild-type mice. In the mouse, SMEZ targeted the human Vbeta8(+) TCR homologue, murine Vbeta11, at the expense of other TCR T cell subsets. Expression of SMEZ did not affect bacterial clearance or survival from peritoneal streptococcal infection in HLA-DQ8 mice, though effects of SMEZ on pharyngeal infection are unknown. Infection did lead to a rise in Vbeta11(+) T cells in the spleen which was partly reversed by disruption of the smez gene. Most strikingly, a clear rise in murine Vbeta4(+) cells was seen in mice infected with the smez(-) mutant S. pyogenes strain, indicating a potential role for SMEZ as a repressor of cognate anti-streptococcal responses."

CD010502,0,12675683,0,Streptococcus pyogenes expressing M and M-like surface proteins are phagocytosed but survive inside human neutrophils.,"Strains of the Gram-positive human pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococcus) that express surface-associated M or M-like proteins survive and grow in non-immune fresh human blood. This is generally accepted to be caused by an antiphagocytic property of these proteins. However, in most previous studies, an inhibition of the internalization of the bacteria into host cells has not been studied or not directly demonstrated. Therefore, in the present paper, we used flow cytometry, fluorescence microscopy and electron microscopy to study phagocytosis by human neutrophils of wild-type S. pyogenes and strains deficient in expression of M protein and/or the M-like protein H. The results demonstrate that all strains of S. pyogenes tested, including the wild-type AP1 strain, induce actin polymerization and are efficiently phagocytosed by human neutrophils. In addition, using classical bactericidal assays, we show that the wild-type AP1 strain can survive inside neutrophils, whereas mutant strains are rapidly killed. We conclude that the ability of virulent S. pyogenes to survive and multiply in whole blood is most likely not possible to explain only by an antiphagocytic effect of bacterial surface components. Instead, our data suggest that bacterial evasion of host defences occurs intracellularly and that survival inside human neutrophils may contribute to the pathogenesis of S. pyogenes and the recurrence of S. pyogenes infections."
CD010502,0,8349810,0,A novel superantigen isolated from pathogenic strains of Streptococcus pyogenes with aminoterminal homology to staphylococcal enterotoxins B and C.,"Streptococcus pyogenes (group A Streptococcus) has re-emerged in recent years as a cause of severe human disease. Because extracellular products are involved in streptococcal pathogenesis, we explored the possibility that a disease isolate expresses an uncharacterized superantigen. We screened culture supernatants for superantigen activity with a major histocompatibility complex class II-dependent T cell proliferation assay. Initial fractionation with red dye A chromatography indicated production of a class II-dependent T cell mitogen by a toxic shock-like syndrome (TSLS) strain. The amino terminus of the purified streptococcal superantigen was more homologous to the amino termini of staphylococcal enterotoxins B, C1, and C3 (SEB, SEC1, and SEC3), than to those of pyrogenic exotoxins A, B, C or other streptococcal toxins. The molecule, designated SSA, had the same pattern of class II isotype usage as SEB in T cell proliferation assays. However, it differed in its pattern of human T cell activation, as measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction with V beta-specific primers. SSA activated human T cells that express V beta 1, 3, 15 with a minor increase of V beta 5.2-bearing cells, whereas SEB activated V beta 3, 12, 15, and 17-bearing T cells. Immunoblot analysis of 75 disease isolates from several localities detected SSA production only in group A streptococci, and found that SSA is apparently confined to only three clonal lineages as defined by multilocus enzyme electrophoresis typing. Isolates of one of these lineages, (electrophoretic type 2) are strongly associated with TSLS. The data identify SSA as a novel streptococcal superantigen that appears to be more related structurally to staphylococcal enterotoxins than to streptococcal exotoxins. Because abundant SSA production is apparently confined to only three streptococcal clonal lineages, the data also suggest that the SSA gene has only recently been acquired by S. pyogenes."
CD010502,0,3103089,0,Streptococcal pharyngitis in the 1980s.,"Streptococcal pharyngitis remains a common problem in children and adolescents. However, the incidence of acute rheumatic fever is now quite low except in developing countries. Proper management of streptococcal pharyngitis has contributed significantly to the decline in ARF. Penicillin treatment has clearly altered the natural history of streptococcal infection; the acute illness is shortened, risk of spread of infection is reduced, suppurative complications are prevented and ARF is prevented. Some cases of acute glomerulonephritis may be prevented. The decline in rheumatic fever has probably contributed to a greater interest in clinical benefits of therapy. Antigen detection tests appear promising for providing a more rapid bacteriologic diagnosis of streptococcal infection, which in turn permits prompt treatment. While penicillin has been the treatment of choice for four decades, a disturbing trend of increasing numbers of clinical relapses or recurrent infections has been noted in recent years. Alternative antibiotics, such as the oral cephalosporins, may now be superior to oral penicillin in terms of lessening the risk of relapse. This advantage must be weighed against other factors including cost effectiveness. The most pressing dilemma for the clinician is management of the patient with repeated episodes of acute streptococcal pharyngitis. Certain of these problem patients may benefit from a period of penicillin prophylaxis during the seasons when streptococcal infections are most prevalent. There is now agreement that posttreatment throat cultures need not be done in the child who remains asymptomatic following therapy. However, it is incumbent on the clinician to make certain that appropriate therapy is prescribed and that compliance with oral regimens of therapy is satisfactory in the management of the patient with acute streptococcal pharyngitis."
CD010502,0,2579417,0,Two human IgM myeloma proteins with unusual specificities for streptococcal carbohydrate-associated epitopes.,"Five hundred and fifty human sera from patients with IgM myeloma or Waldenström's macroglobulinaemia were screened by a solid-phase enzyme-linked immunoassay for binding to the carbohydrate of group A streptococci (A-CHO). Two of them (AC8 and AC179) contained immunoglobulin, which bound specifically to A-CHO even at serum dilutions of 1:10(7). Using synthetic oligosaccharides coupled to protein for inhibition studies, the fine specificities of AC8 and AC179 were determined. AC179 is directed to alpha-linked rhamnose oligosaccharides. AC8 appears to be specific for N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc) side chains beta(1----2)-linked to rhamnose, whereas GlcNAc side chains in A-CHO are reported to be beta(1----3)-linked to the rhamnose backbone. Naturally occurring anti-A-CHO antibodies consist mainly of low-affinity antibodies to such beta(1----3)-linked GlcNAc. In contrast, both myeloma antibodies show more than 10 times higher relative affinities to A-CHO than antibodies prepared from normal human serum (anti-GlcNAc and anti-A-CHO, respectively) by selection for high affinity in the elution procedure. AC179 induced complement activation in the presence of A-CHO."
CD010502,0,1668760,0,Antibodies to N-acetylglucosamine and heparin in acute and remission phases of rheumatic fever.,"The etiology of acute rheumatic fever (ARF) is believed to involve an immunological response to group A streptococcal antigens. Antibodies to group A carbohydrate (A-CHO) have been reported in ARF and rheumatic heart disease patients. As N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) units form the major immunodominant regions in A-CHO antigens, we investigated levels of antibodies to GlcNAc and heparin (with repeated sequences of GlcNAC) in rheumatic fever (RF) patients. Serum samples from 26 acute cases (ARF), 18 remission cases and 17 normal healthy subjects were analyzed for IgG and IgM levels of antibodies to GlcNAc and heparin. High titres of IgG antibodies to heparin and GlcNAc were observed in the ARF group in comparison with controls (p less than 0.0025 and 0.0125 respectively). There was no difference in the levels of IgM antibodies. Remission group demonstrated low titres of IgG to heparin and GlcNAc (p less than 0.01 and 0.0125 respectively) in comparison with ARF group. Heparin antibodies of IgM class was comparatively lower in remission group (p less than 0.005). While the role of these antibodies in different phases of RF needs to be investigated, we conclude that GlcNAc antibodies do not play any role in the pathogenesis of RF or rheumatic heart disease."

Strains with the M3 type are more often associated with necrotizing fasciitis (NF) and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome, and have a higher case fatality rate than strains of other M types. To better understand the epidemiology of M3 GAS strains in Norway, we analyzed 59 invasive and 69 pharyngeal isolates with respect to prophage content, allelic variation in emm3, mtsR encoding the metal transporter of Streptococcus repressor (mtsR), and sclB coding for streptococcal collagen-like protein B. The Norwegian emm3 strains were very homogeneous, mainly harboring the emm allele 3.1 and prophage profile PhiG3.01. Other prophage profiles were transient. The mutation in mtsR known to truncate the protein and result in decreased capacity to cause NF was not found in our isolates. The sclB gene usually harbored five or eight contiguous repeats of a CAAAA pentanucleotide sequence and a highly modular and variable collagen structural motif (CSM) region with 9 and 12 amino acid M3-specific conserved motif repeats distributed across the entire CSM region. Strains with 5 CAAAA repeats emerged in 1993 and these strains were associated with the increase in invasive M3 cases in the period 1993-2003."

In five GBS isolates (1.3%), kanamycin/amikacin resistance and the presence of the aphA-3 gene was identified. Three of these isolates carried the aad-6 gene and were streptomycin-resistant. Screening with kanamycin and streptomycin 1,000-μg disks enabled a rapid and easy detection of these isolates. In all, 312/396 (79%) GBS were tetracycline-resistant and 95% of the examined isolates harbored the tetM gene. Among the 22 (5.5%) GBS resistant to erythromycin and/or clindamycin, the ermB gene was detected in nine isolates (41%) and erm(A/TR) in ten isolates (45%). A high level of erythromycin and clindamycin resistance with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) >256 mg/L was found in four serotype V isolates that harbored ermB. The erythromycin/clindamycin resistance was distributed among all of the common serotypes Ia, Ib, II, III, IV, and V, but was not present in any of the 44 serotype III isolates associated to clonal complex 17. Screening for penicillin resistance with 1-μg oxacillin disks showed a homogenous population with a mean inhibition zone of 20 mm. A change in the present oxacillin breakpoints for GBS is suggested."

All cases of SDE with additional intracranial complications were excluded. Thirteen cases of SDE were identified with the predisposing factors being sinusitis (ten), mastoiditis (two), and otitis media (one). Based on data obtained from this review and from studies previously published in the literature, the keys to optimal outcome are rapid diagnosis, craniotomy with complete evacuation of the purulent collection followed by immediate surgical management of the otorhinological source of the SDE, and appropriate antibiotic therapy. Computed tomography is nearly always diagnostic but can be equivocal and magnetic resonance imaging may become the diagnostic study of choice. Of the five patients initially treated with burr holes. None of the patients initially managed with craniotomy were worse or died, whereas of the four patients initially managed with burr holes, two were worse (25 per cent) and two died (25 per cent). Antibiotic therapy is guided by the organisms found in the empyema and the site of origin of the infection. The otolaryngologist must remain aware of the clinical features and management of SDE and work closely with his neurosurgical colleagues to provide early, decisive surgical treatment."

The typing sera used for this system are prepared in rabbits immunized with whole organisms of specific serotypes. To remove cross reactive antibodies, the sera should be extensively absorbed with organisms of selected heterologous serotypes. In this study, the possibility of using monoclonal antibody (MAb) as a type specific reagent was discussed. MAb which specifically reacted to M type 12 protein of S. pyogenes were produced by cell fusion. This specific MAb reacted to hot acid extracted M type 12 protein in ELISA but didn't react in agglutination and precipitation. Latex beads were sensitized with MAb and examined by the coagglutination method. The latex reagent could detect a very small amount of M type 12 protein, so it could be used for M typing of S. pyogenes which produced a small amount of M 12 protein."
CD010502,0,9766077,0,Identification of Listeria monocytogenes from unpasteurized apple juice using rapid test kits.,"A microbiological survey of 50 retail juices was conducted in the fall of 1996. These juices were analyzed for Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella, coliforms, fecal coliforms, and pH. Two unpasteurized juices were positive for L. monocytogenes: an apple juice and an apple raspberry blend with a pH of 3.78 and 3.75, respectively. Three L. monocytogenes isolates were characterized. The colonies were typical for Listeria sp. on Oxford and lithium chloride-phenylethanol-moxalactam agars and were beta-hemolytic on sheep blood agar. The isolates required 5 days of incubation at 35 degrees C to produce a positive rhamnose reaction in a phenol red carbohydrate broth. This slow rhamnose utilization resulted in these isolates not being identified using the Micro-ID test strip (Organon Technika). However, the isolates were positive for L. monocytogenes using the API Listeria strip (BioMerieux) and a multiplex polymerase chain reaction for detection of the hemolysis (hyla) and invasion-associated protein (iap) genes."

We evaluated the role of rapid culture method in early diagnosis of Mp infection and discussed the potential impact factors. A total of 2,600 patients with acute respiratory infection were included, and their pharyngeal swab samples were prepared for Mp rapid culture based on selective Mp fluid culture medium. The clinical contributing factors related to Mp infection were also explored. The positive rate of Mp culture in females was 41.75%, which was higher than that for males (37.63%). Mp infections were incidental to the children and elderly. The positive rates of Mp culture were higher in children aged 3-5 years and adults older than 70 years (54.05 and 31.48%, respectively), compared with other ages. In addition, Mp infection frequently occurred in winter (December-February) and spring (March-May), with significantly higher positive rates of Mp culture by 40.02 and 42.89 vs. 32.15 and 33.50% in summer (June-August) and autumn (September-November), respectively. The positive rate of rapid culture for Mp was slightly higher than that by Mp antibody assay, but the diagnostic accordance was well between these two methods (P>0.05). Furthermore, clinical common symptoms of respiratory tract infection, such as fever, cough, and expectoration, were not found specific in Mp infection, suggesting that they were not independent prognostic predictors for Mp infection. Therefore, rapid culture based on the Mp pathogen detection would have important clinical application for the early diagnosis of Mp infection."
CD010502,0,15216942,0,"Evaluation of the Uro-Quick, a new rapid automated system, for the detection of well-characterized antibiotic-resistant bacteria.","The Uro-Quick system has been employed to detect antibiotic resistance in genotypically and/or phenotypically well-characterized bacterial species including those that might not be easily identified by routine procedure. In order to achieve full agreement between the antibiotic susceptibility results obtained by the reference method (NCCLS) and the Uro-Quick system, the optimal experimental conditions (inoculum size, time of incubation and antibiotic concentration) for each strain to be used by the automatic system were determined. The shorter time periods for generation of correct susceptibility results were 180 min for ampicillin- and ciprofloxacin-resistant Escherichia coli and for ESBL- and Inhibitor-resistant TEM (IRT)-producing E. coli; 360 min for penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae, as well as for strains with reduced susceptibility to this antibiotic (both intermediate, and resistant isolates). The same time was required to detect erythromycin-resistant pneumococci irrespective of their mechanism of resistance (ribosomal methylation and efflux-mediated), Streptococcus pyogenes exhibiting the three erythromycin-resistance phenotypes (constitutive, inducible and M-type) and Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis and Moraxella morganii refractory to third-generation cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, ciprofloxacin and other classes of antimicrobial agents; 480 min for penicillin-resistant, constitutive and inducible oxacillin-resistant (OXA-R) Staphylococcus aureus and OXA-R Staphylococcus epidermidis. The same period of time was also necessary to find the great majority of drug-resistance exhibited by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Teicoplanin-resistant Staphylococcus haemolyticus, vancomycin-resistant (VanA, VanB, VanC) high-level aminoglycoside-resistant (HLAR) Enterococcus spp, and imipenem-resistant P. aeruginosa required longer incubation (24 h) to be detected. The results obtained indicate that Uro-Quick might be a reliable and promising instrument for the correct detection of the above antibiotic resistance markers."
CD010502,0,11022131,0,Limited effects of placental and pituitary growth hormone on cytokine expression in vitro.,"The hypothesis that growth hormone (GH) can affect immune responses in man has been evaluated by monitoring cytokine expression in cultures from peripheral blood mononuclear cells, by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and ribonuclease protection assay, and in tonsillar cells by ELISA. In addition to pituitary GH (GH-N), the placental form (GH-V), differing from pituitary GH by 13 amino acids has also been tested. Only few effects reached statistical significance and were in no case greater than 15%. Pituitary GH slightly reduced IL-5 production and stimulated IFN-gamma production. The latter effect was also observed with prolactin and could thus be induced through the prolactin receptor. It is proposed that GH has no strong effects on the parameters investigated, possibly as a result of redundancy in the cytokine network. Alternatively, effects on leukocytes are mediated by other tissues such as the liver or are clear only in response to stronger challenges."
CD010502,0,2553613,0,A method for allelic replacement that uses the conjugative transposon Tn916: deletion of the emm6.1 allele in Streptococcus pyogenes JRS4.,"The emm6.1 allele of Streptococcus pyogenes JRS4 was deleted by using the conjugative transposon Tn916. The aphA-3 gene, conferring resistance to kanamycin, was cloned between the sequences flanking the structural gene for the type 6 M protein (emm6.1) and inserted into the BstXI site of Tn916 to generate the chimeric transposon Tn916-5K3. Because the BstXI site lies in a nonessential region of Tn916, the chimeric transposon could transfer by conjugation from Bacillus subtilis into JRS4. In some of the transconjugants, Tn916-5K3 replaced the emm6.1 locus of JRS4 by homologous recombination between the cloned emm6.1-flanking regions and the resident chromosome. One recombinant studied in detail, JRS75, was kanamycin resistant and tetracycline sensitive and lacked immunologically detectable M6 protein. Furthermore, by Southern blot analysis, the DNA region encompassing the emm6.1 structural gene was found to have been replaced by aphA-3."

Glomerulonephritis (GN)-associated drusen appear at a younger age, however, than do drusen in individuals with AMD. In light of recent evidence that immune-mediated events participate in drusen biogenesis and AMD, we examined the structure and composition of drusen in eyes obtained from human donors with two distinct glomerulopathies, both of which involve complement deposition within glomeruli. These features were compared with those of drusen from patients with clinically documented AMD."
CD010502,0,16487241,0,Development of serum IgM antibodies against superantigens of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes in Kawasaki disease.,"To serologically determine the association of microbial superantigens and the pathogenesis of Kawasaki disease (KD), we conducted a case-control study. Serum IgG and IgM antibodies against staphylococcal enterotoxin A (SEA), SEB, SEC, toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1), and streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin A (SPEA) were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 293 serum samples from 65 KD patients on clinical days 1-28 and 120 control samples. The administration of immunoglobulin products, which contain high concentrations of IgG antibodies against all the superantigens, directly elevated antitoxin IgG antibodies in KD patients. In contrast, antitoxin IgM antibodies were not detected in immunoglobulin products. Actually, we found a significant elevation of IgM antibodies against SEA in KD patients in the first (median titre: 0.020, P < 0.01 versus control), second (0.024, P < 0.001), third (0.030, P < 0.001) and fourth (0.038, P < 0.001) weeks, compared to the controls (0.015). Significant differences of IgM antibodies were also true for SEB, TSST-1, and SPEA throughout the first to fourth weeks, and for SEC throughout the second to fourth weeks. The prevalence of KD patients having high IgM titres (> mean + 2SD of control values) to the 5 superantigens was increased with the clinical weeks, and reached 29-43% of KD subjects at the fourth week. This is the first study that describes kinetics of IgM antibodies against superantigens and clarifies the serological significance throughout the clinical course of KD. Our results suggest that multiple superantigens involve in the pathogenesis of KD."

In this work, we have compared the structure and binding of a class A protein, Mrp4, and a class C protein, Arp4, expressed by the same bacterial strain. Circular dichroism spectra, gel filtration, and binding assays showed that both proteins had a coiled-coil dimer configuration and a high-affinity binding at 20 degrees C. However, striking differences were seen at 37 degrees C. The class A protein, Mrp4, was still a coiled-coil dimer with high affinity binding activity, whereas the class C protein, Arp4, had lost both the coiled-coil structure and binding activity. Raising the temperature even higher, Mrp4 retained the coiled-coil structure up to 70-90 degrees C. Furthermore, a recombinant protein, Mrp(C), in which the A-repeats of Mrp4 were replaced by the C-repeats of Arp4, lost its coiled-coil structure and fibrinogen-binding around 40-45 degrees C. These results suggest a high thermal stability of class A proteins and a low stability of class C proteins and that the structural basis for this can be found partly in the A- and C-repeats. Analysis of the amino acid sequences of the A- and C-repeats, revealed a large difference, 87% and 45%, respectively, in the content of hydrophobic amino acid residues in the positions regarded as important for the formation of the coiled-coil structure. In particular, several alanine residues in the A-repeats were replaced by serine residues in the C-repeats. Our results suggest that important structural and functional changes within the M protein family have evolved by specific hydrophobic-nonhydrophobic amino acid replacements."
CD010502,0,9492612,0,[Otitis media and tonsillitis--2 of the most frequent pediatric diagnoses].,"Acute otitis media and tonsillopharyngitis are two of the most common diseases in pediatric clinical practice. Careful examination of the ears and the tonsils are mandatory in the evaluation of a febrile child. Acute otitis media usually can be diagnosed by a carefully taken history and examination alone. The infection usually requires antibiotic treatment, with amoxicillin being still recommended as the first choice drug. Pharyngitis and tonsillitis are more variable in their origin, the majority of cases is caused by different viruses. However, clinical examination alone is not specific enough to rule out the most important bacterial pathogen, group A streptococcus, which still has to be treated by penicillins. Thus, rapid test methods and classic bacteriological culture are used to assess group A streptococcus infections. Infectious mononucleosis and diphtheria are the most important diseases to be considered carefully in each patient."

CD010502,0,3049816,0,Human monoclonal antibodies reactive with antigens of the group A Streptococcus and human heart.,"Human mAb were produced from tonsillar or PBL of normal individuals or patients infected with group A streptococci. Lymphocytes were purified on Ficoll-Hypaque gradients and stimulated in vitro with purified group A streptococcal membranes or M protein extracts. The mAb were selected for study based on their reaction with group A streptococci, pep M5 protein, and/or M6 Escherichia coli protein. Further analysis by Western immunoblot or competitive inhibition ELISA revealed that there were two types of antibodies: one type that reacted with myosin and DNA and the other type that reacted with myosin, keratin, and/or actin. The specificities of these human mAb are similar to specificities observed in our previous studies of murine mAb reactive with group A streptococci and heart Ag. For comparison, anti-myosin antibodies were affinity purified from the sera of infected or acute rheumatic fever patients and were shown to react with myosin and DNA as well as with group A streptococci and M protein. To affinity purify these antibodies from normal sera, five times the amount of sera was required to obtain detectable quantities. These data suggest that the human mAb reactive with group A streptococci and myosin reflect the antibodies seen in sera from infected patients or acute rheumatics and that the B lymphocyte clones capable of producing these cross-reactive antibodies are also present in normal individuals."

Alone or in conjunction with other molecular techniques (16S ribotyping, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, and detection of exotoxin genes), PCR-RFLP could differentiate outbreak-related strains from contemporaneous background strains of the same M serotype. Three outbreaks were studied: pharyngitis in a boarding school (serotype M5), cross-infection in a hospital burn unit (serotype M76), and severe invasive disease in two elderly care homes (serotype R28). It was possible, for example, to identify within serotype R28 a clone with particular potential for invasive disease. In all cases, the four molecular methods yielded complementary results that were hierarchically related. Strains could be assigned to the outbreak or the background in a precise, reproducible, and rapid manner."
CD010502,0,19581371,0,"Selection, recombination, and virulence gene diversity among group B streptococcal genotypes.","Transmission of group B Streptococcus (GBS) from mothers to neonates during childbirth is a leading cause of neonatal sepsis and meningitis. Although subtyping tools have identified specific GBS phylogenetic lineages that are important in neonatal disease, little is known about the genetic diversity of these lineages or the roles that recombination and selection play in the generation of emergent genotypes. Here, we examined genetic variation, selection, and recombination in seven multilocus sequence typing (MLST) loci from 94 invasive, colonizing, and bovine strains representing 38 GBS sequence types and performed DNA sequencing and PCR-based restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of several putative virulence genes to identify gene content differences between genotypes. Despite the low level of diversity in the MLST loci, a neighbor net analysis revealed a variable range of genetic exchange among the seven clonal complexes (CCs) identified, suggesting that recombination is partly responsible for the diversity observed between genotypes. Recombination is also important for several virulence genes, as some gene alleles had evidence for lateral gene exchange across divergent genotypes. The CC-17 lineage, which is associated with neonatal disease, is relatively homogeneous and therefore appears to have diverged independently with an exclusive set of virulence characteristics. These data suggest that different GBS genetic backgrounds have distinct virulence gene profiles that may be important for disease pathogenesis. Such profiles could be used as markers for the rapid detection of strains with an increased propensity to cause neonatal disease and may be considered useful vaccine targets."

We present a novel Fn-binding protein of group A streptococcus serotype M3 and M18 strains isolated from patients with toxic shock-like syndrome (TSLS). By searching the whole genome sequence of an M3 strain from a TSLS patient, an open reading frame was found among the putative surface proteins. It possessed an LPXTG motif and Fn-binding repeat domains in the C-terminal region and was designated as FbaB (Fn-binding protein of group A streptococci type B). The fbaB gene was found in all M3 and M18 strains examined, although not in other M serotypes. Furthermore, FbaB protein was expressed on the cell surface of TSLS strains but not on non-TSLS ones. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and ligand blotting revealed that recombinant FbaB exhibits a strong Fn-binding ability. An FbaB-deficient mutant strain showed 6-fold lower adhesion and invasion efficiencies to HEp-2 cells than the wild type. Moreover, mortality was decreased in mice infected with the mutant strain in comparison to the wild type. These data suggest that FbaB is etiologically involved in the development of invasive streptococcal diseases."

The conjugate elicited type V polysaccharide-specific IgG antibodies in rabbits, while unconjugated type V polysaccharide did not. Conjugate-induced rabbit antibodies were opsonic in vitro and protected mice against challenge with type V GBS.

CD010502,0,7891551,0,Non-congruent relationships between variation in emm gene sequences and the population genetic structure of group A streptococci.,"To examine the molecular population genetics of the M protein family of Streptococcus pyogenes (group A Streptococcus), the 5' regions of polymerase chain reaction-amplified emm products from 79 M serotypes were sequenced and the phylogeny was compared to estimates of overall genetic relationships among strains determined by multilocus enzyme electrophoresis. Although the 5' emm sequences from several strains designated as distinct M types were identical or almost identical, the overall pattern is characterized by very extensive variation. The composition of distinct emm sequence clusters generally parallels the ability of strains to express serum opacity factor and in some cases historical associations of certain M types with acute rheumatic fever, but not with M types classified as nephritogenic. For many strains there is a lack of congruency between variation in 5' emm sequences and estimates of overall chromosomal relationships, which is undoubtedly due to horizontal transfer and recombination of emm sequences. The results of these studies provide insights into the nature and extent of emm sequence variation and describe how this variation 'maps' onto the population genetic structure of extant S. pyogenes lineages. The complexity of emm sequence and streptococcal cell lineage relationships revealed by this analysis has significant implications for understanding evolutionary events generating strain diversity and the epidemiology of S. pyogenes diseases."
CD010502,0,2142480,0,Inhibition of the alternative C3 convertase and classical C5 convertase of complement by group A streptococcal M protein.,"When Streptococcus pyogenes group A type 3 strain C203 (M+) and its M-protein-lacking derivative, strain C203S (M-), were treated with normal human serum in the presence of magnesium-EGTA [ethylene glycol-bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid], virulent M+ bacteria bound only 10 to 30% as much C3 and factors B and P as did avirulent M- bacteria. After treatment of M+ bacteria with trypsin, which inactivates M protein, their binding of these substances was similar to that of M- bacteria. Pretreatment of M+ bacteria with the Fab fragment of rabbit immunoglobulin G anti-M antibody also increased their binding of C3 in the absence of Ca2+. Therefore, M protein inhibits the alternative C3 convertase. In contrast, in the presence of Ca2+ and Mg2+, M+ bacteria bound 75% as much C3 as M- bacteria. This binding was mostly mediated by classical pathway activation, because M+ bacteria bound much smaller amounts of factors B and P than did M- bacteria but consumed amounts of C4 and C2 comparable to those consumed by M- bacteria. On the other hand, the amount of C5 bound to M+ bacteria was much less than that bound to M- bacteria, and the consumption of C5 and C8 by M+ bacteria was also much less than that by M- bacteria. Therefore, M protein does not inhibit the classical C3 convertase but does inhibit the classical C5 convertase. When M+ and M- streptococci were incubated with normal human serum containing radiolabeled C3 in the presence of Ca2+ and Mg2+, more than 85% of the C3 bound to either type of streptococcus was extractable by sodium dodecyl sulfate and alkali treatment. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of the C3 extracted from both strains showed that it was mostly C3b and iC3b. The proportions of C3b and iC3b, respectively, were 7.5 and 71.9% on M+ bacteria and 18.9 and 58.4% on M- bacteria. These results support and extend previous findings that the antiphagocytic activity of streptococcal M protein may be due to complement inhibition mediated by the binding of factor H."

Of note, inhibition of adherence by sIgA occurred despite a much lower immunreactivity against the M6 protein as compared to the hyperimmune serum against the whole M+ strain. The M protein does probably not mediate the adherence of group A streptococci to respiratory cells, as shown by previous studies. However, since the isogenic M- derivative was less invasive to human pharyngeal cells than the M+ strain, our invasion experiments suggest that the M protein may play a role in internalization of group A streptococci into eukaryotic cells. More importantly, internalization and not adherence could be blocked by rabbit serum immunized with recombinant M6 protein."
CD010502,0,21258213,0,Virulence of serotype M3 Group A Streptococcus strains in wax worms (Galleria mellonella larvae).,"Group A Streptococcus (GAS) causes human infections that range in severity from pharyngitis (""strep-throat"") to necrotizing fasciitis (""flesh-eating disease"").  To facilitate investigation of the molecular basis of host-pathogen interactions, infection models capable of rapidly screening for differences in GAS strain virulence are needed.  To this end, we developed a Galleria mellonella larvae (wax worm) model of invasive GAS infection and used it to compare the virulence of serotype M3 GAS strains.  We found that GAS causes severe tissue damage and kills wax worms in a dose-dependent manner.  The virulence of genetically distinct GAS strains was compared by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and determining 50% lethal doses (LD 50).  Host-pathogen interactions were further characterized using quantitative culture, histopathology and TaqMan assays.  GAS strains known to be highly pathogenic in mice and monkeys caused significantly lower survival and had significantly lower LD 50s in wax worms than GAS strains associated with attenuated virulence or asymptomatic carriage.  Furthermore, isogenic inactivation of proven virulence factors resulted in a significantly increased LD 50 and decreased lesion size compared to the wild-type strain, a finding that also strongly correlates with animal studies.  Importantly, survival analysis and LD 50 determination in wax worms supported our hypothesis that a newly emerged GAS subclone that is epidemiologically associated with more human necrotizing fasciitis cases than its progenitor lineage has significantly increased virulence.  We conclude that GAS virulence in wax worms strongly correlates with the data obtained in vertebrate models, and thus, the Galleria mellonella larva is a useful host organism to study GAS pathogenesis."

This study describes a molecular biological approach to the identification of such cross-reactive cardiac antigens. Two human heart cDNA libraries were constructed in the expression vector lambda gt11 and screened with patient sera, monoclonal antibodies and rabbit immune sera cross-reactive with streptococcal and cardiac antigens. Using the serum of a patient with a recurrent acute attack of rheumatic fever containing high titres of antibodies cross-reactive with both sets of antigens, we were able to identify three positive clones with insert sizes of 1.0 kb, 1.4 kb and 0.9 kb in these libraries. Acute rheumatic fever (ARF) sera reacted more strongly with these autoantigen clones than did normal sera. Autoantibodies eluted from the purified plaques of all three clones displayed different patterns of cross-reactivity against immunoblots of streptococcal M5, M6, M19 and M24 protein extracts. The cDNA inserts were sequenced and compared with known sequences in the EMBL and Genbank databases. One clone was 98% homologous with human cytokeratin 8 and showed homologies of 40 to 50% with human cardiac heavy chain myosin, tropomyosin and streptococcal M5 protein--all members of the alpha-helical coiled-coil family of proteins. Another clone was completely homologous to the G-protein alpha-subunit of adenyl cyclase, whilst the sequence of the third clone was not found in any of the data banks."
CD010502,0,1465577,0,Outbreaks of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis in children: correlation of serotype T4 with scarlet fever.,"We evaluated the clinical features of 121 children who had group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal (GABHS) pharyngitis during 2 outbreaks in the Chikuhou district, Fukuoka, Japan, with respect to T types. During the first outbreak (November 1989-February 1990), T12 (50%) and T22 (27%) were the dominant T types isolated. During the second outbreak (January-April 1991), 64% of the typable strains were T4. Pus on the tonsils was less common and strawberry tongue more common in patients with eruptions than in those without. Skin eruptions were much more common in the patients infected with T4 than with other T types (p < 0.001). Despite a 10-day regimen of amoxicillin, 12/69 patients (17.4%) had evidence of GABHS on repeat cultures. The results suggest that T4 may be associated with a high incidence of scarlet fever. Serotyping should be performed to identify disease carriers and patterns of GABHS infection."

CD010502,0,8975893,0,Relative contributions of hyaluronic acid capsule and M protein to virulence in a mucoid strain of the group A Streptococcus.,"The antiphagocytic effect of M protein has been considered a critical element in virulence of the group A streptococcus. The hyaluronic acid capsule also appears to play an important role: studies of an acapsular mutant derived from the mucoid or highly encapsulated M protein type 18 group A streptococcal strain 282 indicated that loss of capsule expression was associated with decreased resistance to phagocytic killing and with reduced virulence in mice. To study directly the relative contributions to virulence of M protein and the hyaluronic acid capsule in strain 282, we inactivated the gene encoding the M protein (emm18) both in wild-type strain 282 and in its acapsular mutant, strain TX72. Inactivation of emm18 was accomplished by integrational plasmid mutagenesis, using the temperature-sensitive shuttle vector pJRS233 harboring a 5' DNA segment of emm18. As reported previously, wild-type strain 282 was resistant to phagocytic killing in vitro, both in whole human blood and in 10% serum. The capsule mutant TX72 was highly susceptible to phagocytic killing in 10% serum and moderately sensitive in whole blood. The M protein mutant 282KZ was highly susceptible to phagocytic killing in blood but only moderately sensitive in 10% serum. The double mutant TX74 was sensitive to killing in both conditions. In a mouse infection model, the 50% lethal dose was increased by 60- and 80-fold for the capsule and double mutants, respectively, compared with that of strain 282, but only by 6-fold for the M protein mutant. Integration of the strain 282 capsule genes into the chromosome of a nonmucoid M1 strain resulted in high-level capsule production and rendered the transformed strain resistant to phagocytic killing in 10% serum. These results provide further evidence that the hyaluronic acid capsule confers resistance to phagocytosis and enhances group A streptococcal virulence. The results suggest also that assessment of in vitro resistance to phagocytosis in 10% serum rather than in whole blood may be a more accurate reflection of virulence in vivo of group A streptococci."
CD010502,0,18403168,0,Diagnosis of Lemierre syndrome by bedside emergency department ultrasound.,"Oropharyngeal infections such as pharyngitis and odontogenic abscess are routinely encountered in emergency and primary care medical practice. Lemierre syndrome is a rare but serious complication of such infections. This syndrome is characterized by penetration of the primary infection into the lateral pharyngeal space, suppurative thrombophlebitis of the internal jugular vein, and metastatic infections resulting from septic emboli. A combination of clinical suspicion, microbiologic identification of the causative organism, and diagnostic imaging may be required to make the diagnosis. We present a case of Lemierre syndrome that was rapidly diagnosed in the Emergency Department with bedside ultrasound of the internal jugular vein. This case suggests that bedside ultrasound, performed before other radiologic imaging, may lead to earlier diagnosis and treatment of this syndrome, which historically has been associated with significant morbidity and mortality."

CD010502,0,14517274,0,Evasion of phagocytosis through cooperation between two ligand-binding regions in Streptococcus pyogenes M protein.,"The M protein of Streptococcus pyogenes is a major bacterial virulence factor that confers resistance to phagocytosis. To analyze how M protein allows evasion of phagocytosis, we used the M22 protein, which has features typical of many M proteins and has two well-characterized regions binding human plasma proteins: the hypervariable NH2-terminal region binds C4b-binding protein (C4BP), which inhibits the classical pathway of complement activation; and an adjacent semivariable region binds IgA-Fc. Characterization of chromosomal S. pyogenes mutants demonstrated that each of the ligand-binding regions contributed to phagocytosis resistance, which could be fully explained as cooperation between the two regions. Deposition of complement on S. pyogenes occurred almost exclusively via the classical pathway, even under nonimmune conditions, but was down-regulated by bacteria-bound C4BP, providing an explanation for the ability of bound C4BP to inhibit phagocytosis. Different opsonizing antisera shared the ability to block binding of both C4BP and IgA, suggesting that the two regions in M22 play important roles also under immune conditions, as targets for protective antibodies. These data indicate that M22 and similar M proteins confer resistance to phagocytosis through ability to bind two components of the human immune system."

All S. aureus strains were identical with respect to the specificity of their PG, essentially differing from other bacteria in this regard. After the removal of antibodies to different PG the effectiveness of PG opsonization decreased by 10.4-44.7%.

We used this approach to evaluate the proposed autoimmune etiology for Tourette syndrome (TS) and pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infection (PANDAS). Sera were assessed from patients with TS (n = 9) preselected based on the presence of elevated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay optical densities against putamen homogenate and sera from patients with PANDAS (n = 8), selected from a larger group assayed for antibodies against a putamen synaptosomal preparation. The effect of antibodies against the streptococcal M5 protein were also studied. A total of 44 Fischer rats received bilateral infusion of sera: 23 ventral striatum (5 PANDAS, 5 TS, 5 anti-M5 protein, and 8 control); 21 ventrolateral striatum (5 PANDAS, 5 TS, 5 anti-M5 protein, and 6 controls). Cannulas were placed bilaterally and symmetrically by stereotactic techniques. After animals were allowed to recover for 1 week, sera were microinfused for 3 days. Animal behavior was then simultaneously quantified by daily observation and monitoring using automated activity boxes for 10 days after infusion. No significant alterations in stereotypic behavior or movement were observed between the PANDAS, TS, or anti-M5 protein and control groups. Our findings are in contrast to previous reports, and suggest the need for further investigations to determine the validity of the model and of autoimmune-mediated hypotheses for pediatric movement disorders."
CD010502,0,12190942,0,Decreased IL-10 production by psoriatic peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated with streptococcal superantigen.,"The strong association of acute guttate psoriasis and streptococcal throat infection has suggested a role for streptococcal antigens in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. We have reported that psoriatic peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) showed significantly lower responses to cytoplasmic membrane-associated protein (CAP) isolated from group A beta-hemolytic streptococci, a kind of streptococcal superantigen. The objectives were to evaluate the abnormal cytokine production by psoriatic PBMCs to streptococcal superantigen, CAP. We compared the production of four different cytokines, i.e. IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, and IFN-gamma, by PBMCs between psoriatic patients and healthy controls after stimulation with CAP or two different staphylococcal superantigens, staphylococcal enterotoxin A (SEA) or E (SEE). When PBMCs were stimulated with CAP, the production of IL-10 was significantly lower by psoriatic PBMCs than by those from healthy controls, whereas those of IL-4, IL-5, or IFN-gamma were not different between the two groups. Such a significant decrease in IL-10 production by psoriatic PBMCs was not observed when they were stimulated with staphylococcal superantigens. Flow cytometric analysis of intracytoplasmic IL-10 demonstrated defective IL-10 production by psoriatic PBMCs in both CD3+ T cells and CD14+ monocytes. There was a significant positive correlation between IFN-gamma production by PBMCs and the proliferation of Vbeta8+ T cells preferentially stimulated by CAP. These data demonstrating the defective IL-10 production by psoriatic PBMCs stimulated with streptococcal superantigen seem to explain why only psoriatic patients evolve sustained and Th-1 deviated skin lesions after streptococcal upper respiratory infection."
CD010502,0,17678558,0,Combined administration of serogroup B meningococcal vaccine and conjugated serogroup C meningococcal vaccine is safe and immunogenic in college students.,"This study evaluated the first use of a combination of the lyophilized components of the conjugated group C vaccine Menjugate reconstituted with the liquid group B outer membrane vesicle (OMV) vaccine MeNZB. At 6-week intervals, healthy residential students received three doses of MeNZB alone or concomitantly with one dose of Menjugate (MeNZB+MenC). Short-lasting injection-site reactions of mild or moderate intensity were frequent in both groups. There were no vaccine-related serious adverse events. After three doses, the percentage of subjects with serum bactericidal assay (SBA) titres > or = 1:8 against the serogroup B strain NZ98/254 was 82% for MeNZB+MenC and 78% for MeNZB. All subjects in the MeNZB+MenC group achieved SBA titres > or = 1:8 against serogroup strain C11 and 67% in the MeNZB group. All SBA and ELISA responses of the combined vaccine were at least as good as for MeNZB alone. After vaccination, the pharyngeal carriage rate of any meningococcus in the vaccinated group had declined from 40% to 21%."

CD010502,0,6991420,0,Binding of streptococcal antigens to muscle tissue in vitro.,"Antigens extracted from cells of Streptococcus pyogenes T6 and Streptococcus mutans strains AHT, BHT, 10449, OMZ175, and K1R adsorbed to the sarcolemmal sheath of cardiac muscle cells in vitro. Similar preparations from S. salivarius, S. sanguis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Lactobacillus casei had weak or negligible tissue-binding activity. Tissue-bound bacterial antigens were detected with homologous rabbit antisera with both indirect immunofluorescence tests and an indirect radioimmunoassay. Serological cross-reactivity was observed between the tissue-binding factors of S. pyogenes and S. mutans cells but not between the bacteria and muscle tissue. In a comparative study of extraction procedures, the greatest yield of tissue-binding factors was obtained from group A streptococci by cell disruption in buffer at 4 degrees C. Hot aqueous phenol and hot water extracts were inactive. Antibodies specific for the tissue-binding factor(s) were readily adsorbed from rabbit anti-S. pyogenes serum by a preparation of isolated cytoplasmic membranes but not by a suspension of cell wall fragments. The heart-binding component of S. pyogenes cell extracts was inactivated by protease digestion and heat treatment and to a lesser extent by periodic acid oxidation. The capacity of heart cell components to adsorb streptococcal antigens was reduced by protease treatment but not by the action of neuraminidase, hyaluronidase, organic solvents, or detergents."
CD010502,0,8450222,0,"Stimulation of human T cells by streptococcal ""superantigen"" erythrogenic toxins (scarlet fever toxins).","The pyrogenic (erythrogenic) exotoxins A and C (SPEA and SPEC) of Streptococcus pyogenes belong to the family of mitogenic toxins of which the staphylococcal enterotoxins are the prototypes. The erythrogenic toxin B (SPEB) is a proteinase precursor. All SPE have been reported to be superantigens. Here we have analyzed the human T cell response to these toxins. We used highly purified preparations of SPEA, SPEB, and SPEC from different S. pyogenes strains. These toxins were apparently homogenous in SDS-PAGE, IEF, and HPLC. In addition, recombinant SPEA and SPEC were produced in Escherichia coli. In cultures of PBMC, all three toxins expanded preferentially a fraction of T cells. Using mAb against V beta 2, -5, -6, -8, and -12, we investigated the phenotype of the stimulated cells. Natural SPEA, SPEB, and SPEC strongly stimulated V beta 8+ T cells, whereas recombinant SPEA and SPEC did not. Both natural and recombinant SPEA stimulated V beta 12+ cells and both natural and recombinant SPEC stimulated V beta 2+ cells. In accordance with these findings, a human V beta 8+ line responded to all three toxins derived from S. pyogenes but not to the recombinant proteins. An antiserum against natural SPEC neutralized specifically the V beta 2-stimulating activity of SPEC and the V beta 8-stimulating activity of all three toxins, but had no effect on the response to other superantigens. This shows that trace amounts of a potent novel V beta 8-stimulating activity not identical to SPEA and SPEC are responsible for the stimulation of V beta 8+ T cells by natural SPEA and SPEC reported previously. In a preliminary screening of S. pyogenes strains from patients, we found that this novel superantigen appears to be more widely distributed than SPEA and SPEC. Furthermore, we present evidence that also the superantigenic properties of SPEB are due to contaminations with this V beta 8 stimulator. The response to SPEB usually required 1000 times higher concentrations than to SPEA or SPEC. Antisera to SPEC but not to SPEB inhibited the response of PBMC and V beta 8+ Jurkat cells to SPEB. Furthermore, more stringent purification of SPEB yielded SPEB preparations devoid of mitogenic activity. These results indicate that the mitogenicity that is commonly attributed to SPEB is due to minute contaminations of the V beta 8 stimulator. These results raise two important caveats for the work with these highly potent T cell mitogens.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
CD010502,0,20515290,0,Peritonsillar abscess and cellulitis and their relation to a positive antigen detection test for streptococcal infection.,"The microbiological cause of peritonsillar abscess and the role of group A β-haemolytic Streptococcus (GAS) are unclear. We performed a retrospective study at the ear, nose and throat clinic (ENT) of Orebro University Hospital, Sweden, and included 376 events of peritonsillitis between 2002 and 2004. We determined if the patients had visited a primary healthcare centre (PHCC) within 30 days prior to inclusion. The results of the rapid antigen detection test for GAS (Strep A) taken at the PHCC were compared with the occurrence of peritonsillar abscess (PTA) and peritonsillar cellulitis (PTC). A Strep A test was performed in 61% (229/376) of the events studied. Strep A was positive in 22% of PTA events and in 35% of PTC events (p = 0.036). Of 48,000 Strep A tests taken in primary healthcare, mainly for sore throat, 22% were positive. We examined the relationship between age, the incidence of PTA, and positive Strep A tests. We also determined if there was a monthly correlation between number of positive Strep A tests and number of PTA events. We found no significant correlations. In conclusion, our findings indicate that GAS does not play a major role in the development of PTA/PTC."

Serum concentrations of two anti-inflammatory cytokines, interleukin-I receptor antagonist (IL-IRa) and human soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor I (sTNF-RI) were determined in patients with ARF at the time of admission and 3 months after treatment in order to evaluate changes in cytokine concentrations occurring during different stages of the disease."
CD010502,0,1299798,0,Serum antibody responses to Streptococcus mutans antigens in humans systemically infected with oral streptococci.,"Sera from patients with subacute bacterial endocarditis (SBE) due to Streptococcus mutans or other oral streptococci and from normal subjects were assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for antibodies to defined S. mutans antigens. Antibodies of IgG and IgA isotypes to Ag I/II and Ag III were greatly elevated in S. mutans-SBE sera, and the IgA antibodies in 3 sera included both polymeric and monomeric forms. Elevated IgM and IgG anti-lipoteichoic acid and IgG and IgA anti-serotype c polysaccharide antibodies were also found. The sera of 4 of 6 patients infected with other oral streptococci also displayed antibodies to S. mutans Ag I/II. Sera of 3 patients infected with Streptococcus mitis or Streptococcus oralis, but none of the S. mutans-infected cases, showed elevated antibodies to human heart sarcolemma, and all SBE sera had elevated rheumatoid factor. These results suggest that the known surface protein antigens of S. mutans are immunodominant in humans, and are not likely to be heart cross-reactive."
CD010502,0,19587152,0,Putative novel surface-exposed Streptococcus agalactiae protein frequently expressed by the group B streptococcus from Zimbabwe.,"Group B streptococci (GBS) express a variety of surface-exposed and strain-variable proteins which function as phenotypic markers and as antigens which are able to induce protective immunity in experimental settings. Among these proteins, the chimeric and immunologically cross-reacting alpha-like proteins are particularly important. Another protein, R3, which has been less well studied, occurred at a frequency of 21.5% in GBS from Zimbabwe and, notably, occurred in serotype V strains at a frequency of 75.9%. Working with rabbit antiserum raised against the R3 reference strain ATCC 49447 (strain 10/84; serotype V/R3) to detect the expression of the R3 protein, we recorded findings which suggested that strain 10/84 expressed a strain-variable protein antigen, in addition to R3. The antigen was detected by various enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based tests by using acid extract antigens or GBS whole-cell coats and by whole-cell-based Western blotting. We named the putative novel antigen the Z antigen. The Z antigen was a high-molecular-mass antigen that was susceptible to degradation by pepsin and trypsin but that was resistant to m-periodate oxidation and failed to show immunological cross-reactivity with any of a variety of other GBS protein antigens. The Z antigen was expressed by 33/121 (27.2%) of strains of a Zimbabwean GBS strain collection and by 64.2% and 72.4% of the type Ib and type V strains, respectively, and was occasionally expressed by GBS of other capsular serotypes. Thus, the putative novel GBS protein named Z showed distinct capsular antigen associations and presented as an important phenotypic marker in GBS from Zimbabwe. It may be an important antigen in GBS from larger areas of southern Africa. Its prevalence in GBS from Western countries is not known."

CD010502,0,2473035,0,Ultrastructural localization of the fibrinogen-binding domain of streptococcal M protein.,"Binding of fibrinogen to the M protein located on the surface fibrillae of group A streptococci impedes deposition of complement and thus contributes to the virulence of these organisms. We investigated this binding by electron microscopy using postembedding immunogold labeling. Both fibrinogen and its D fragment formed a distinct dense layer in the surface fibrillae, separated by 10 nm from the compact part of the cell wall. Labeling the sections with anti-fibrinogen or anti-fragment D showed that the fibrinogen-binding region lay within a 25-nm segment of the fibrillae beginning approximately 30 nm from the inner surface of the cell wall. The outer surface of the fibrinogen layer could be labeled with antibody to the amino-terminal half of type 24 M protein, indicating that the fibrillar tips remained exposed after fibrinogen binding. The degree of labeling with anti-fibrinogen, determined by gold particle counting, was the same whether the bacterial cells had been incubated with purified fibrinogen or whole plasma. These results indicate that the fibrinogen-binding region lies in the distal (amino-terminal) half of the M protein molecule but excludes the most distal portion, which is the site of epitopes that interact with opsonic anti-M antibody, and that plasma proteins other than fibrinogen, a number of which are known to bind to group A streptococci, do not interfere with fibrinogen binding."
CD010502,0,15339937,0,Membrane retrieval in neutrophils during phagocytosis: inhibition by M protein-expressing S. pyogenes bacteria.,"During phagocytosis and phagosome maturation, complex membrane traffic events must be coordinated. We have observed, using fluorescent fluid-phase and membrane markers, that in the human neutrophil, internalization of nonopsonized, Gram-positive bacteria, but not of latex beads, is accompanied by a rapid and localized formation of pinosomal structures. This pinocytic response is calcium-dependent but insensitive to actin cytoskeleton disruption and wortmannin treatment. Contrary to what we observe, endosomal structures usually are considered to participate in phagosome formation by providing necessary membrane to forming phagosomes. Instead, our results show a coupling between neutrophil secretory and membrane-retrieval processes during phagosome maturation, and we suggest that the observed, localized pinocytic response is linked to the secretion of azurophilic granules toward nascent phagosomes. Accordingly, M and M-like protein-expressing Streptococcus pyogenes bacteria, which are able to survive inside neutrophil phagosomes, inhibit both the secretion of azurophilic granules to phagosomes and pinosome formation."
CD010502,0,2410367,0,Immunoglobulin A subclass distribution of naturally occurring salivary antibodies to microbial antigens.,"The distribution of immunoglobulin A1 (IgA1) and IgA2 antibodies to various microbial antigens was determined in human parotid saliva by using monoclonal antibodies to the IgA subclasses in a solid-phase radioimmunoassay. In 12 subjects examined, antibodies to Streptococcus mutans glucosyl transferase, protein antigen I/II, and cell wall carbohydrate, as well as dextrans B1355 fraction S and B512 and phosphorylcholine, occurred predominantly in the IgA1 subclass. In contrast, antibodies to lipoteichoic acid from Streptococcus pyogenes and whole lipopolysaccharides from Bacteroides gingivalis, Bacteroides fragilis, and Escherichia coli were predominantly of the IgA2 subclass. The data indicate that in most individuals naturally occurring antibodies to a given antigen are predominantly associated with one of the two subclasses of IgA."
CD010502,0,12065504,0,Dual control of streptokinase and streptolysin S production by the covRS and fasCAX two-component regulators in Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis.,"Synthesis of the plasminogen activator streptokinase (SK) by group A streptococci (GAS) has recently been shown to be subject to control by two two-component regulators, covRS (or csrRS) and fasBCA. In independent studies, response regulator CovR proved to act as the repressor, whereas FasA was found to act indirectly as the activator by controlling the expression of a stimulatory RNA, fasX. In an attempt at understanding the regulation of SK production in the human group C streptococcal (GCS) strain H46A, the strongest SK producer known yet, we provide here physical and functional evidence for the presence of the cov and fas systems in GCS as well and, using a mutational approach, compare the balance between their opposing actions in H46A and GAS strain NZ131. Sequence analysis combined with Southern hybridization revealed that the covRS and fasCAX operons are preserved at high levels of primary structure identity between the corresponding GAS and GCS genes, with the exception of fasB, encoding a second sensor kinase that is not a member of the GCS fas operon. This analysis also showed that wild-type H46A is actually a derepressed mutant for SK and streptolysin S (SLS) synthesis, carrying a K102 amber mutation in covR. Using cov and fas mutations in various combinations together with strain constructs allowing complementation in trans, we found that, in H46A, cov and fas contribute to approximately equal negative and positive extents, respectively, to constitutive SK and SLS activity. The amounts of SK paralleled the level of skc(H46A) transcription. The most profound difference between H46A and NZ131 regarding the relative activities of the cov and fas systems consisted in significantly higher activity of a functional CovR repressor in NZ131 than in H46A. In NZ131, CovR decreased SK activity in a Fas(+) background about sevenfold, compared to a 1.9-fold reduction of SK activity in H46A. Combined with the very short-lived nature of covR mRNA (decay rate, 1.39/min), such differences may contribute to strain-specific peculiarities of the expression of two prominent streptococcal virulence factors in response to environmental changes."
CD010502,0,7821961,0,Concomitant in vivo production of 19 different cytokines in human tonsils.,"Accumulating data indicate that cytokines, peptides involved in regulation of both physiological and pathological immune responses, are produced predominantly at the site of local antigen stimulation. Cytokine-producing cells were detected at the protein level in human tonsil tissue obtained from children with recurrent tonsillitis or infectious mononucleosis (IM). Concomitant production of 19 different human cytokines, interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1 alpha), IL-1 beta, IL-1 receptor antagonist (ra), IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-13, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), G-CSF, tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), TNF-beta, interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and transforming growth factor-beta 1-3 (TGF-beta 1-3), was identified at a single-cell level by indirect immunohistochemical staining procedures and use of carefully selected cytokine-specific antibodies (Ab). Fresh frozen sections were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized by 0.1% saponin treatment, eluting cholesterol from the cell-surface membrane and the Golgi complex. The intracellular localization of all cytokines, except IL-1 and IL-1ra, was demonstrated by a characteristic local cytoplasmic perinuclear configuration in producer cells. In addition, the immunoreactivity for certain cytokines (IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, G-CSF and GM-CSF) was expressed on the cell membranes and extended over a large extracellular area encompassing the producer cell. Localization of the cytokine to the Golgi organelle was established by co-staining with a monoclonal antibody (mAb) specific to the Golgi complex. Both the extra- and intracellular cytokine staining reactions could be blocked by preincubation of the cytokine-specific Ab with the corresponding purified natural or recombinant cytokine. A complex cytokine pattern was established in both groups studied, where most T-helper type 1 (Th1) and Th2 lymphokines were expressed in the tonsils but at different frequencies and localizations. Cells expressing IL-4, IL-5, IL-10 and IL-13, (Th2 response) were evident at higher frequencies in recurrent tonsillitis compared to sections from IM, which were associated with a more pronounced IL-2, IFN-gamma and TNF-beta expression."
CD010502,0,18444821,0,The importance of the group a streptococcus capsule in the pathogenesis of human infections: a historical perspective.,"The virulence of group A streptococci (GAS) correlates closely with expression of its surface antigen, M protein, and its hyaluronic acid capsule. In studies of human GAS infection, the former has received considerable attention. For several decades, however, systematic identification of encapsulated virulent strains by the mucoid colonies they produce has been neglected in clinical studies. In part, this may be due to the capsule's evanescent expression on artificial media, its repression during convalescent carriage, lack of expertise in recognizing its colonial morphology, and the growing tendency for clinical laboratories to eschew throat cultures in favor of rapid laboratory tests for group A polysaccharide. Older and more recent studies are reviewed here that emphasize the capsule's basic role in infection. We believe that it is time to refocus newer clinical studies and techniques on achieving early recognition of potentially dangerous, heavily encapsulated strains of GAS for which spread may be prevented."

The assays had sensitivity to quantitate these toxins to 1.4, 5.9, 16.3, 2.5 and 4.3 pg/ml, respectively, in a buffer including 50% human plasma. It takes only 150 min to complete the assays after plate preparation. Specificity of the assays agreed with those of reverse latex agglutination assay. We also developed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays to detect antibodies against these five superantigens. The assays are expected to be significant tools for the study of superantigens in several diseases."

CD010502,0,21458494,0,Evaluation of the Roche COBAS® TaqMan® HIV-1 test for quantifying HIV-1 RNA in infected cells and lymphoid tissue.,"Lymphoid tissue is the main reservoir of HIV-1 in infected individuals. In this study the COBAS® TaqMan® HIV-1 test was evaluated for use with the High Pure System (HPS), for quantifying HIV-1 RNA in infected cells and lymphoid tissue specimens. Serial dilutions of 8E5-LAV1 infected T-cells into SUP-T1 cells and 44 tonsil specimens were examined. Some modifications of the test were required, such as the removal of residual DNA and the HIV-1 RNA output copies were adjusted to the sample input and expressed as HIV-1 RNA copies/μg of total RNA. The Roche COBAS® TaqMan HIV-1® (HPS) test proved to be a robust, sensitive, specific and reproducible method for quantifying HIV-1 RNA in infected cells and lymphoid tissue. Linearity and reproducibility were observed in serial dilutions of 8E5-LAV1 infected T-cells (R²>0.86). High reproducibility was found in clinical tonsil specimens (Wilcoxon test p > 0.05). rDNase I treatment was essential to avoid false positives caused by residual HIV-1 DNA, mainly in tonsil specimens obtained from infected patients receiving effective antiretroviral treatment. Probit analysis determined the limit of detection as 22HIV-1 RNA copies/μg of total RNA. The Roche COBAS® TaqMan® HIV-1 (HPS) test thereby proved to be a helpful tool for measuring the HIV-1 viral load in infected cells and lymphoid tissue reservoirs."
CD010502,0,12627991,0,Erysipelas: recognition and management.,"Erysipelas is an acute bacterial infection of the dermis and hypodermis that is associated with clinical inflammation. It is a specific clinical type of cellulitis and, as such, it should be studied as a specific entity. Erysipelas is generally caused by group A streptococci; it is highly probable that streptococcal toxins also play a role, which could, in part, help explain the clinical inflammation. Erysipelas of the leg is the main clinical type encountered. The face, arm, and upper thigh are the other most common sites for the occurrence of erysipelas. After a sudden onset, areas of erythema and edema characteristically enlarge with well-defined margins. Athlete's foot is the most common portal of entry for the disease. Erysipelas is generally associated with high fever, and adenopathy and lymphangitis are sometimes present. At the time of diagnosis, it is important to look for clinical markers of severity (local signs and symptoms, general signs and symptoms, co-morbidity, social context) which would necessitate hospitalization. There are many differential diagnoses, particularly in the case of atypical dermo-hypodermitis. Some bacterial infections may have specific clinical aspects or may lead to a diagnosis of cellulitis. Necrotizing cellulitis or fasciitis are life-threatening diseases and a rapid diagnosis is important. Other noninfectious types of cellulitis have been reported in many diseases, both localized or generalized. The biology of typical erysipelas is of little value in diagnosis and a laboratory workup is usually not required. There are few local complications associated with erysipelas; abscess can occur in some patients and septicemia is rare. Recurrence is the more distressing complication. Treatment of patients with erysipelas has been evaluated in a small number of studies. In most of them, erysipelas has been included in therapeutic studies of 'severe cutaneous infections'. This is not justified as in fact erysipelas is usually sensitive to penicillin G. Amoxicillin and macrolides are also effective. However, comparative, cost-analysis studies need to be performed to determine the best therapeutic option. Bed rest with the leg elevated is also important. Anticoagulants are indicated in patients at risk of venous thromboembolism. The portal of entry will also require treatment. Long-term antibacterial therapy is required for patients with recurrence."
CD010502,0,7995355,0,Clonal diversity of Streptococcus pyogenes within some M-types revealed by multilocus enzyme electrophoresis.,"Twenty-two reference isolates and 30 local isolates of group A Streptococci were classified into 36 electrophoretic types (ET) on the basis of allozyme variation at 27 enzyme loci. Local isolates were characterized by a high frequency of M-non typable strains. M-type and ET were more closely associated in local isolates from an endemically-infected population; nevertheless, amongst the local isolates there were also strains of the same ET type with different M-types. A possible explanation is that genetic exchange between strains may introduce different M-types into strains of defined ET when these are exposed to strong selection in the presence of heavy loads of infection. In contrast to the reported clustering of strains associated with toxic shock-like syndrome into two closely related ET clones, we found no relationship of ET phenotype to acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis or rheumatic fever."
CD010502,0,9222046,0,"Immune response to Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia and other anaerobes in children with acute tonsillitis.","The number of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria was determined in the saliva of 20 children with acute group A beta-haemolytic streptococcal (GABHS) pharyngo-tonsillitis, and 20 with acute non-GABHS tonsillitis. Antibody titres to four Gram-negative anaerobic bacilli that reside in the oropharynx (Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) were determined in these and 20 control patients. An average of 8.8 aerobic and anaerobic isolates per patient saliva specimens were found during the acute tonsillitis stage in both groups, and 6.9 (in GABHS tonsillitis) and 5.6 (in non-GABHS tonsillitis) 5-6 weeks later. There were 10- to 1000-fold more bacteria in the acute stages of the inflammation in both GABHS and non-GABHS groups. These bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Peptostreptococcus spp., F. nucleatum, Prevotella spp. and Porphyromonas spp. Significantly higher antibodies levels to F. nucleatum and P. intermedia were found in the second serum sample of patients with non-GABHS pharyngo-tonsillitis (P < 0.001) and GABHS tonsillitis (P < 0.05), as compared with their first sample or the levels of antibodies in controls. The increase in the number of several aerobic and anaerobic bacteria during acute tonsillitis and the increase in antibody levels to F. nucleatum and P. intermedia, known oral pathogens, may suggest a possible pathogenic role for these organisms in acute non-GABHS and GABHS tonsillitis."

CD010502,0,6808025,0,Identification of bacterial antigens in circulating immune complexes of infective endocarditis.,"The presence of circulating immune complexes (IC) in patients with infective endocarditis has been well documented but the contributions of host and bacterial components to these IC have not been defined. To study this question, IC were isolated from serum of a patient with Streptococcus faecalis endocarditis by differential polyethylene glycol precipitation and competitive binding to staphylococcal protein A. A rabbit antiserum raised against the purified IC had reactivity by crossed immunoelectrophoresis primarily with an antigen derived from the cytoplasm of the infective organism. The antigen was a protein with a 12,000-dalton molecular mass. In situ radiolabeling of the IC bound to the protein A demonstrated a component of the same molecular mass as the bacterial antigen recognized by the antiserum. The patient serum had multiple antibody specificities reactive with bacterial antigens, including the antigen recognized by the rabbit anti-IC antiserum. These techniques for isolation and characterization of circulating IC may have value in the study of IC diseases in which the inciting antigens are not known."
CD010502,0,8454323,0,Temporal relationship of cytokine release by peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated by the streptococcal superantigen pep M5.,"We undertook this study to determine the quality, quantity, and temporal relationship of pep M5-induced cytokine release. The ability of pep M5 to stimulate interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) production by a T-cell-depleted, monocyte- and B-cell-enriched cell population was dependent on the presence of T cells. The requirement for T cells could be met by addition of exogenous gamma interferon (IFN-gamma). In the presence of IFN-gamma, pep M5 induced the release of TNF-alpha, IL-1, and IL-6, TNF-alpha levels peaked at 24 h, while IL-1 and IL-6 levels peaked at 48 h. pep M5 induced T cells to produce IFN-gamma, which may have accounted for the ability of the super antigen to induce the production of IL-1, IL-6, TNF-alpha, and TNF-beta by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). The addition of excess IFN-gamma to cultures of pep M5 and PBMC did not further increase the release of these cytokines at 24 and 48 h but resulted in sustained higher levels at 72 h. Interestingly, TNF-beta production occurred only in the presence of pep M5 and exogenous IFN-gamma. The ability of pep M5 to induce cytokine production was compared with that of a potent super antigen, staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB). SEB was a 2- to 14-fold-more-potent inducer of IFN-gamma production. Furthermore, the profile of cytokine released by PBMC in response to this super antigen mimicked that seen with pep M5 in the presence of exogenous IFN-gamma. In conclusion, pep M5 induces the production of cytokines that are involved in immune regulation and inflammation. These cytokines also play a major role in human T-cell responses to this super antigen."

The diagnostic parameters for the five kits were as follows: Abbott TestPack Strep A--sensitivity, 79% (110/139) and specificity, 98% (490/501); Direct Strep A EIA (Roche)--sensitivity, 79% (104/132) and specificity, 63% (178/281); Respirastick--sensitivity, 55% (46/84) and specificity, 96% (298/309); Reveal Colour Strep A--sensitivity, 82% (114/139) and specificity, 83% (223/268); Tandem ICON Strep A--sensitivity, 78% (111/143) and specificity, 98% (362/368). The antigen detection test results were heavily influenced by the clinical prediction of a streptococcal or viral etiology. It is concluded that in the absence of a standard throat culture, the Abbott TestPack Strep A kit and the Tandem ICON Strep A kit both offer a more safe diagnostic alternative than clinical assessment. Depending on the current prevalence of group A streptococci, the additional use of a throat swab culture should be considered in case of negative antigen detection test results."
CD010502,0,15815033,0,Identity and prevalence of multilocus sequence typing-defined clones of group A streptococci within a hospital setting.,"Between July and October 2003, 121 clinical isolates of group A streptococci (GAS) were collected from a London hospital and characterized by multilocus sequence typing (MLST) to determine the identity and prevalence of clones circulating within this setting. A total of 39 sequence types (ST), of which 20 were represented by a single isolate, were identified. The eight most prevalent clones among the 121 GAS were ST117/emm81 (16%), ST39/emm4 (9%), ST62/emm87 (7%), ST28/emm1 (6%), ST36/emm12 (6%), ST46/emm22 (5%), ST334/emm82 (5%), and ST101/emm89 (4%). Compared to those in the MLST database (http://spyogenes.mlst.net), 12 (31%) of the 39 STs had not been previously identified, although 7 of these differed from recognized STs at only a single locus, suggesting they were closely related to previously recognized strains. Resistance to erythromycin and tetracycline was seen in 7 and 20% of isolates, respectively, with four isolates resistant to both agents. GAS strains with higher (>80) emm types accounted for 45% of GAS isolates collected during this study. Continuing GAS surveillance, using easily comparable methods, is important for detecting changes in the character of disease-causing isolates."
CD010502,0,3065087,0,Human immune response to group A streptococcal carbohydrate (A-CHO). III. Comparison of the efficiencies of anti-idiotopic antibody and of nominal antigen in the induction of IgM anti-A-CHO-producing B cells.,"In this study the efficiencies of a monoclonal anti-idiotopic (Id) antibody (anti-Id498) and of various preparations of nominal antigen in the induction of an antigen-specific human B cell response in vitro were compared. Anti-Id498 recognizes a recurrent, binding site-related Id present on IgM antibodies with specificity for N-acetyl-D-glucosamine, the immunodominant group of streptococcal group A carbohydrate (A-CHO). We have previously shown that anti-Id498 induces IgM anti-A-CHO secretion from B cells of donors that possess Id-498+ antibodies in their serum. A-CHO was presented to B cells either in soluble or insoluble form, i.e. coupled to beads or as intact bacteria. Purified blood B cell populations from three Id+ healthy donors with high numbers of circulating anti-A-CHO B cells were used and antibody-producing B cells are enumerated in a single-cell assay (spot ELISA). The data show that anti-Id498 was superior in the induction of IgM anti-A-CHO-secreting B cells in two donors (factor 4.6 and 13.5 as compared to the most efficient antigenic stimulation). In the third donor antigen stimulation was slightly more efficient than anti-Id but only with Sepharose-bound A-CHO and not with soluble A-CHO or intact bacteria. The increase of specific B cells induced after stimulation with anti-Id498 could be abolished after addition of autologous T cells in two donors. On the contrary, an enhancement of the specific response was observed after addition of autologous T cells in antigen-stimulated cultures. Neither suppression nor enhancement were induced by addition of irradiated T cells."

CD010502,0,20353817,0,Inflammatory cytokines are associated with the development of symptom burden in patients with NSCLC undergoing concurrent chemoradiation therapy.,"Elevations in cancer treatment-induced circulating inflammatory cytokines may be partially responsible for the development of significant symptom burden (e.g., pain, fatigue, distress, disturbed sleep) during concurrent chemoradiation therapy (CXRT). Sixty-two patients undergoing CXRT for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) reported symptoms weekly for 15 weeks via the M. D. Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI). Serum inflammatory cytokines were assessed weekly during therapy via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Dynamic changes in cytokines and associated symptom profiles were estimated using mixed-effect models. MDASI symptom severity increased gradually as CXRT dose accumulated and peaked at week 8. Serum concentrations of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, and serum soluble receptor 1 for tumor necrosis factor (sTNF-R1) increased significantly by week 8 (all p<.05). During CXRT, controlled for age, sex, race, body mass index, cancer recurrence, previous treatment status, total radiotherapy dose, and CXRT delivery technique, an increase in sTNF-R1 was significantly related to an increase in the mean score for all 15 MDASI symptoms (estimate, 1.74; SE, 0.69; p<.05) and to a larger radiation dose to normal lung volume (estimate, 1.77; SE, 0.71; p<.01); an increase in serum IL-6 was significantly related to increased mean severity for the five most severe symptoms (pain, fatigue, disturbed sleep, lack of appetite, sore throat) (estimate, 0.32; SE, 0.16; p<.05). These results suggest a role for over-expressed pro-inflammatory cytokines in significant worsening of symptoms in NSCLC patients undergoing CXRT, and warrant further study to identify biological targets for ameliorating treatment-related symptom burden."

To identify the emm types of GAS strains causing pharyngitis in Ontario, Canada, we sequenced the hypervariable region of the emm gene in 4,635 pharyngeal GAS isolates collected during 2002-2010. The most prevalent emm types varied little from year to year. In contrast, fine-scale geographic analysis identified inter-site variability in the most common emm types. Additionally, we observed fluctuations in yearly frequency of emm3 strains from pharyngitis patients that coincided with peaks of emm3 invasive infections. We also discovered a striking increase in frequency of emm89 strains among isolates from patients with pharyngitis and invasive disease.

CD010502,0,2691841,0,Extensive sequence homology between IgA receptor and M proteins in Streptococcus pyogenes.,"Many strains of Streptococcus pyogenes are known to express a receptor for IgA. The complete nucleotide sequence of the gene for such a receptor, protein Arp4, has been determined. The deduced amino acid sequence of 386 residues includes a signal sequence of 41 amino acids and a putative membrane anchor region, both of which are homologous to similar regions in other streptococcal surface proteins. The processed form of the IgA receptor has a length of 345 amino acids and a calculated molecular weight of 39544. The N-terminal sequence of the processed form is different from that previously found for a similar IgA receptor isolated from a S. pyogenes strain of type M60. The sequence of protein Arp4 shows extensive homology to the C-terminal half of streptococcal M proteins, but not to the streptococcal IgG receptor protein G or staphlyococcal protein A. Apart from the membrane anchor, this homology includes a sequence of 119 amino acid residues containing three repeated units and a 54-residue sequence without repeats. The protein expressed in Escherichia coli is found in the periplasmic space, in which it constitutes the major protein. Protein Arp4 is the first example of a surface protein that has both immunoglobulin-binding capacity and structural features characteristic of M proteins."
CD010502,0,12635926,0,"Staphylococcal and streptococcal superantigens: molecular, biological and clinical aspects.","Superantigens (SAgs) include a class of certain bacterial and viral proteins exhibiting highly potent lymphocyte-transforming (mitogenic) activity towards human and or other mammalian T lymphocytes. Unlike conventional antigens, SAgs bind to certain regions of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) outside the classical antigen-binding groove and concomitantly bind in their native form to T cells at specific motifs of the variable region of the beta chain (Vbeta) of the T cell receptor (TcR). This interaction triggers the activation (proliferation) of the targeted T lymphocytes and leads to the in vivo or in vitro release of high amounts of various cytokines and other effectors by immune cells. Each SAg interacts specifically with a characteristic set of Vbeta motifs. The review summarizes our current knowledge on S. aureus and S. pyogenes superantigen proteins. The repertoire of the staphylococcal and streptococcal SAgs comprises 24 and 8 proteins, respectively. The staphylococcal SAgs include (i) the classical enterotoxins A, B, C (and antigenic variants), D, E, and the recently discovered enterotoxins G to Q, (ii) toxic shock syndrome toxin-1, (iii) exfoliatins A and B. The streptococcal SAgs include the classical pyrogenic exotoxins A and C and the newly identified pyrogenic toxins, G, H, I, J, SMEZ, and SSA. The structural and genomic aspects of these toxins and their molecular relatedness are described as well as the available 3-D crystal structure of some of them and that of certain of their complexes with MHC class II molecules and the TcR, respectively.

CD010502,0,9757684,0,"[Diagnostic value of rapid streptococcal antigen test provided by Abbott ""test pack strep A"": current report].",The upper respiratory tract infections are the most frequent infectious diseases in human. Beta haemolytic streptococcus group A is the most common etiologic factor of bacterial pharyngitis. Delayed or inadequate treatment of streptococcal pharyngitis can cause serious subsequent complications. Only a part of patients show typical features of the disease so that the diagnosis can be based on clinical appearance alone. For this reason we propose direct antigen test as a rapid useful method which allows detection of group A streptococci in throat swabs. The aim of the study is to estimate clinical value of rapid antigen test in differential diagnosis of pharyngitis in children and adults. We have performed 50 tests using commercial kit--Abbott Test Pack Strep A. Simultaneously conventional bacterial throat cultures were performed. The comparison of results acquired by both methods did not revealed any differences.
CD010502,0,2107201,0,Identification of Bacillus anthracis by using monoclonal antibody to cell wall galactose-N-acetylglucosamine polysaccharide.,"Guanidine extracts of crude Bacillus anthracis cell wall were used to vaccinate BALB/c mice and to develop monoclonal antibody (MAb) to vegetative cell surface antigens. Two hybridomas selected during this study produced immunoglobulin M immunoglobulins, which appear to be directed to an epitope associated with the galactose-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine polysaccharide. Both demonstrated specificity in their binding to purified B. anthracis cell wall, o-stearoyl-polysaccharide conjugates, and intact, nonencapsulated vegetative cells. The interaction of the MAbs with purified polysaccharide was inhibited by 0.5 M galactose and lactose but not by N-acetylglucosamine, glutamate, glycine, or glycerol. Inhibition by glucose or sucrose was approximately 75% of that seen with galactose. Electron microscopy showed that both MAbs interacted with the cell wall of vegetative cells as well as with the cortex of spores. Neither MAb reacted with encapsulated vegetative cells, such as those from infected guinea pigs, nor did they react with intact spores. After conjugation to fluorescein isothiocyanate, the MAbs stained intensely all B. anthracis strains tested, whereas with two exceptions, none of the strains of 20 other Bacillus spp. was stained. The exceptions, strains of Bacillus cereus, could be differentiated from B. anthracis by being beta-hemolytic on blood agar."
CD010502,0,11158359,0,Streptococcus pyogenes sclB encodes a putative hypervariable surface protein with a collagen-like repetitive structure.,"Streptococcus pyogenes is the causative agent in a wide range of diseases of humans of varying severity. During a study scanning the genome sequence of a serotype M1 invasive isolate SF370 for novel surface proteins, an ORF, designated sclB, was identified. The putative protein encoded by sclB contains both a signal peptide and classic Gram-positive wall-associated sequences. Comparison of the sequences of this ORF with those from a number of unrelated isolates demonstrated that sclB encodes a putative surface protein with a variable N-terminal sequence followed by a variable length tract of collagen-like GXY(n) repeats. A further feature of sclB is the presence of CAAAA repeat tracts immediately downstream of the putative start codon. The number of these pentameric repeats varies from 4 to 15 between strains and variation in repeat number results in the predicted SclB protein being either in or out of frame relative to the start codon. These observations suggest that expression of this protein may be regulated at the translational level as a result of gain or loss of CAAAA repeats. While the function of SclB remains to be elucidated, an sclB-specific transcript was detected by RT-PCR during in vitro culture. Finally, it is shown that a second gene, sclA, potentially encoding a protein with a similar extensive collagen-like structure and variable N-terminal sequence, is present in all isolates of S. pyogenes tested to date. Thus S. pyogenes harbours a novel family of structurally related and surface-exposed proteins of potential importance in the pathogenic process."

CD010502,0,14500504,0,M1 protein triggers a phosphoinositide cascade for group A Streptococcus invasion of epithelial cells.,"Invasion of nonphagocytic cells by bacteria provides a favorable niche for persistence and evasion of host defenses and antibiotics. M protein is a major virulence factor because it promotes high-frequency invasion of epithelial cells by group A Streptococcus (GAS) and also renders the bacterium resistant to phagocytosis. In this study, we investigated the role of M1 protein from serotype M1 strain 90-226 in regulating mammalian signal transduction and cytoskeletal rearrangement for bacterial entry. LY294002 and wortmannin, which are inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-K) blocked invasion of epithelial cells by GAS by 75 and 80%, respectively, but failed to inhibit invasion by Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. Also, epithelial cells transiently transfected with dominant negative p85 and p110 genes, the regulatory and catalytic subunits of PI 3-K, respectively, were less able to be invaded by GAS. To separate the influence of other streptococcal virulence factors from M protein, Lactococcus lactis was engineered to express M1 protein on its surface. L. lactis(pLM1) invaded epithelial cells efficiently in vitro, and PI 3-K inhibitors blocked 90% of this invasion. Purified soluble M1 protein stimulated the formation of stress fibers and actin tuffs on epithelial cells. LY294002 and wortmannin inhibited these cellular changes. A phosphoinositide analogue also inhibited the invasion of epithelial cells by GAS. Therefore, M1 protein, either directly or via bound fibronectin, initiates signals that depend on the lipid kinase PI 3-K pathway, which paves the way for cytoskeletal rearrangement that internalize the bacterium."
CD010502,0,7643859,0,Characterization of a gene coding for a type IIo bacterial IgG-binding protein.,"Two antigenic classes of non-immune IgG-binding proteins can be expressed by group A streptococci. One antigenic group of proteins is recognized by an antibody prepared against the product of a cloned fcrA gene (anti-FcRA). In this study, the immunogen used to prepare the antibody that defines the second antigenic class was shown to be the product of the emm-like (emmL) gene of M serotype 55 group A isolate, A928. The emmL55 gene expressed in E. coli produced an M(r) approximately 58,000 molecule which bound human IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4, as well as horse, rabbit and pig IgG in a non-immune fashion. These properties are characteristic of the previously described type IIo IgG-binding protein isolated from this strain. In addition, the recombinant protein was reactive with human serum albumin and fibrinogen. The emmL 55 gene sequence was analysed and found to have the organization and sequence characteristics of a typical class I emm-like gene."

The aim of this study was to determine emm types and capsule phenotype in 110 isolates of S. pyogenes from patients with invasive (sterile sites) and non-invasive (mainly pharyngitis) infections in Chile, and the relationship between both virulence factors. The most abundant types found were emm12, emm1, emm4 and emm28 and their distribution was similar to that seen in Latin America and developed countries, but very different from that in Asia and Pacific Island countries. Ten of 16 emm types identified in pharyngeal isolates were found in sterile-site isolates, and three of nine emm types of sterile-site isolates occurred in pharyngeal isolates; three emm subtypes were novel. The amount of hyaluronic acid was significantly higher in sterile-site isolates but did not differ substantially among emm types. Only three isolates were markedly capsulate and two of them had mutations in the csrR gene that codes for a repressor of capsule synthesis genes. We found a non-random association between emm types and csrR gene alleles suggesting that horizontal gene transfer is not freely occurring in the population."

All index cases had high temperatures associated most commonly with tonsillitis, acute otitis media, gastroenteritis, or febrile convulsions. In 14 of the 16 families with symptomatic contacts the index case was the first symptomatic case, or one of the first symptomatic cases, in that family. Fifteen (94%) of the siblings and 20 (56%) of the parents had signs and symptoms of acute infection during the follow up period. In 10 (63%) and eight (20%) of these cases, respectively, adenovirus was confirmed. The mean (SD) incubation period of confirmed adenovirus infections was 10 (3) days. The observations show that adenovirus infection spreads actively to other siblings in the family.

A grouping procedure is described in which antigens from standardized concentrations of bacteria taken directly from agar plates are extracted by Streptomyces albus enzyme at 52 C during a 20-min incubation and then multiple samples assayed in 4 min. Because all components of the system are quantitatively standardized via a spectrophotometer, subjectivity common to other grouping methods is reduced, and high levels of quality assessment can be ensured by establishing numerical control limits. One hundred isolates were assayed using group-specific antisera for A, B, C, and G (400 samples), and 100% correct positive identification with no false positive was obtained. The assay can also serve as a simple way for commercial sources to provide activity information for their products."

Vaginal specimens taken from each patient on admission were used to perform each of two rapid tests and corresponding cultures. The rapid tests were the Streptex latex agglutination assay and the Equate Strep B test, which uses a solid-phase immunoassay. Overall, 105 patients (9.9%) had at least one positive culture. The sensitivities for the rapid tests were 15.1% for Streptex and 21.5% for Equate. Specificities were 99.3 and 98.7%, respectively. Sensitivity was minimally increased in the setting of ruptured membranes for both tests. Likewise, use of separate swabs for streaking the culture plate and performing the rapid test increased the sensitivity, but this was not significant for either test. In control experiments, the limit of sensitivity of both rapid tests was 5 x 10(6) colony-forming units. We conclude that at present, these tests are not sensitive enough for routine use in this type of clinical setting."

Using S. pyogenes ATCC 12351 as reference strain the developed method was evaluated by reproducibility measurements and using parameters typically employed for screening methods, i.e. signal-to-background, signal-to-noise and a screening-window coefficient, the Z' factor. The method was further used for screening a group of natural compounds and their synthetic derivatives against resistant bacterial strains. Of these, octyl and dodecyl gallates, and usnic and ursolic acids were the most active.

During the period 1999-2005, 240,445 visits for RTI were recorded. Children aged <2 y and especially those aged 2-16 y with acute otitis media (AOM), showed decreasing consultations between 2000 and 2005. The consultations for sore throat declined during the study period in all age groups and in 65% of these, antibiotics were prescribed, primarily penicillin V (82%). In sore throat, a positive Strep-A test result was followed by antibiotic prescription in about 92% of cases; when negative, the antibiotic prescription rate was 40%. C-reactive protein (CRP) was analyzed in 36% of all consultations for RTI. In common cold and acute bronchitis, the prescription rates of antibiotics rose with rising CRP. The results show that near-patient tests were used extensively, but often not in accordance with the guidelines. Antibiotic use decreased mainly as a consequence of declined visiting frequencies. This indicates that the new guidelines for AOM and sore throat may have influenced patient consultation habits more than physician prescribing habits."
CD010502,0,10408362,0,Regulation of complement activation by C-reactive protein.,"C-reactive protein (CRP) is an acute-phase serum protein and a mediator of innate immunity. CRP binds to microbial polysaccharides and to ligands exposed on damaged cells. Binding of CRP to these substrates activates the classical complement pathway leading to their uptake by phagocytic cells. Complement activation by CRP is restricted to C1, C4, C2 and C3 with little consumption of C5-9. Surface bound CRP reduces deposition of and generation of C5b-9 by the alternative pathway and deposition of C3b and lysis by the lectin pathway. These activities of CRP are the result of recruitment of factor H resulting in regulation of C3b on bacteria or erythrocytes. Evidence is presented for direct binding of H to CRP. H binding to CRP or C3b immobilized on microtiter wells was demonstrated by ELISA. Attachment of CRP to a surface was required for H binding. H binding to CRP was not inhibited by EDTA or phosphocholine, which inhibit ligand binding, but was inhibited by a 13 amino acid CRP peptide. The peptide sequence was identical to the region of CRP that showed the best alignment to H binding peptides from Streptococcus pyogenes (M6) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (Por1A). The results suggest that CRP bound to a surface provides secondary binding sites for H resulting in greater regulation of alternative pathway amplification and C5 convertases. Complement activation by CRP may help limit the inflammatory response by providing opsonization with minimal generation of C5a and C5b-9."
CD010502,0,11821167,0,A comparative study of the etiology of adult upper and lower respiratory tract infections in the community.,"Lower respiratory tract infection and upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) are very common, but the etiology is not diagnosed in routine practice. The objective of this study was to determine and compare the frequency distribution of the various infectious etiologies for these diseases. One hundred seventy five adults in the community with febrile LRTI and 75 with febrile URTI were included in a purely serologically based prospective study. Paired sera were obtained for each of the patients and were tested by EIA or immunofluorescence methods to identify 14 different pathogens. Only a significant change in antibody titers between the paired sera was considered diagnostic. At least one infectious etiology was identified in 167 patients (67%). In the LRTI group, infection with at least one of 7 respiratory viruses was found in 88 patients (50%). One of the atypical pathogens was found in 40 patients (23%), of these Legionella spp. in 19 (11%) and Mycoplasma pneumoniae in 18 (10%). A bacterial etiology was found in 19 patients (11%), of these Streptococcus pneumoniae in 8 (5%) and beta-hemolytic streptococci group A in 5 (3%). The frequency distribution of etiologies in the URTI group was not significantly different from the LRTI group, except for M. pneumoniae that was identified in only one patient with URTI (p = 0.015). More than one etiologic agent was found in 42 (17%) of the patients. LRTI is caused by a broad spectrum of etiologies, with respiratory viruses predominating and a moderate, but significant, prevalence of atypical pathogens. The frequency distribution of etiologies for URTI is similar to LRTI. In a significant proportion of patients with URTI and LRTI there is serologic evidence of infection with more than one pathogen. The justification and benefit of distinguishing between URTI and LRTI in routine clinical work is doubtful. When a decision is reached to treat RTI patients with an antibiotic, it is logical to use a macrolide or tetracycline."
CD010502,0,2761387,0,Sequence analysis of the wall-associated protein precursor of Streptococcus mutans antigen A.,"The nucleotide sequence has been determined for the Streptococcus mutans wall-associated protein A (wapA) gene from serotype c strains Ingbritt and GS5. The nucleotide sequence for each wapA gene was virtually identical, although the gene from strain GS5 contained a 24 base pair deletion. A 29 amino acid signal peptide was specified by each wapA gene with a mature protein of 424 amino acids (Mr, 45,276) for strain Ingbritt and 416 amino acids (Mr, 44,846) for strain GS5. In the C-terminal region of the wall-associated protein A, considerable sequence similarity was found with the membrane anchor region of proteins from other Gram-positive organisms such as the group A streptococcal M protein and the group G streptococcal IgG binding protein. Adjacent to the proposed membrane anchor is a highly hydrophilic region which may span the cell wall; both sequence data and experimental evidence indicate the existence of a region immediately outside the wall at which proteolytic cleavage occurs to release antigen A of Mr 29,000 into the culture supernatant. Thus, the wall-associated protein A is a precursor of the 29,000 Mr antigen A."
CD010502,0,12161033,0,"Antibodies to neuron-specific antigens in children with autism: possible cross-reaction with encephalitogenic proteins from milk, Chlamydia pneumoniae and Streptococcus group A.","We measured autoantibodies against nine different neuron-specific antigens and three cross-reactive peptides in the sera of autistic subjects and healthy controls by means of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) testing. The antigens were myelin basic protein (MBP), myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG), ganglioside (GM1), sulfatide (SULF), chondroitin sulfate (CONSO4), myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG), alpha,beta-crystallin (alpha,beta-CRYS), neurofilament proteins (NAFP), tubulin and three cross-reactive peptides, Chlamydia pneumoniae (CPP), streptococcal M protein (STM6P) and milk butyrophilin (BTN). Autistic children showed the highest levels of IgG, IgM and IgA antibodies against all neurologic antigens as well as the three cross-reactive peptides. These antibodies are specific because immune absorption demonstrated that only neuron-specific antigens or their cross-reactive epitopes could significantly reduce antibody levels. These antibodies may have been synthesized as a result of an alteration in the blood-brain barrier. This barrier promotes access of preexisting T-cells and central nervous system antigens to immunocompetent cells, which may start a vicious cycle. These results suggest a mechanism by which bacterial infections and milk antigens may modulate autoimmune responses in autism."
CD010502,0,9306157,0,Kinetics of specific salivary IgA responses in man after oral challenge by ribosomal immunostimulant.,"The kinetics of specific IgA mucosal responses was assessed in 12 healthy volunteers over 3 weeks of treatment by oral administration of an immunostimulant, Ribomunyl, composed of ribosomes from the four bacteria Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. The levels of IgA specific for these four bacteria increased after each immunization and, after the third week of treatment, were significantly higher than baseline day 0 values. This study demonstrates that oral ribosomal immunostimulation results in the production of specific salivary antibodies liable to recognize whole bacteria antigens, and therefore likely to confer protection. The kinetic analysis performed also demonstrates the rapidity of specific mucosal immune responses after oral stimulation in man, a feature still seldom explored."
CD010502,0,6172381,0,Mouse protection assay for group B streptococcus type III.,"The mucin model for group B Streptococcus (GBS) type III was used to assay the protective effect of sera against a type III challenge in mice. Hyperimmune rabbit sera, prepared by the Lancefield method against the laboratory reference strain (SS620) and a clinical isolate (M732), protected against a lethal challenge with either strain of GBS type III. Absorption of the sera with either of these type III strains removed the protective effect. Neither normal rabbit sera nor heterologous antisera (anti-Ia, SS615) provided protection; however, protection was obtained with pooled human gamma globulin. Sera from adult volunteers were tested to assay protective levels in the mouse model. Human sera enhanced the mouse lethality of the clinical isolate, M732, but not the laboratory reference strain, SS620. Sera from adults vaccinated with type III polysaccharide of GBS were also tested. The murine-mucin-GBS model may be developed as a screening test to measure protective antibody levels in the pre- and postvaccine treatment period. The model may also be used to measure protective antibody in pooled human gamma globulin for use in the passive immunization of high-risk individuals."
CD010502,0,9733001,0,Fixed polarizer ellipsometry for simple and sensitive detection of thin films generated by specific molecular interactions: applications in immunoassays and DNA sequence detection.,"Biological thin films may form on a surface by specific molecular interactions. The fixed polarizer ellipsometer (FPE) is a sensitive instrument that detects biological thin films either qualitatively or quantitatively. The design is simple and inexpensive. The assays are formatted on an optical surface, and the FPE detection is based on the phase shift of linearly polarized light after reflection through a thin film. We have constructed mathematical models of the FPE response to reflection through single-layer and two-layer films that agree closely with experimental data. Several biological assays have been measured with the FPE to demonstrate the application of this technology to clinical targets, including ultrasensitive immunoassays for hepatitis B surface antigen (0.1 ng/mL) and alpha-fetoprotein (0.01 ng/ mL) and DNA hybridization (0.5 fmol/microL target probe). A clinical study for detection of group A streptococcus from patient throat swabs demonstrated the qualitative application of the FPE to infectious disease targets. The flexibility and sensitivity of the FPE makes this technology suitable for numerous target analytes and applications."
CD010502,0,11581178,0,Antibody levels to the class I and II epitopes of the M protein and myosin are related to group A streptococcal exposure in endemic populations.,"Rheumatic fever (RF)/rheumatic heart disease (RHD) and post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis are thought to be autoimmune diseases, and follow group A streptococcal (GAS) infection. Different GAS M types have been associated with rheumatogenicity or nephritogenicity and categorized into either of two distinct classes (I or II) based on amino acid sequences present within the repeat region ('C' repeats) of the M protein. Sera from ARF patients have previously been shown to contain elevated levels of antibodies to the class I-specific epitope and myosin with the class I-specific antibodies also being cross-reactive to myosin, suggesting a disease association. This study shows that immunoreactivity of the class I-specific peptide and myosin does not differ between controls and acute RF (ARF)/RHD in populations that are highly endemic for GAS, raising the possibility that the association is related to GAS exposure, not the presence of ARF/RHD. Peptide inhibition studies suggest that the class I epitope may be conformational and residue 10 of the peptide is critical for antibody binding. We demonstrate that correlation of antibody levels between the class I and II epitope is due to class II-specific antibodies recognizing a common epitope with class I which is contained within the sequence RDL-ASRE. Our results suggest that antibody prevalence to class I and II epitopes and myosin is associated with GAS exposure, and that antibodies to these epitopes are not an indicator of disease nor a pathogenic factor in endemic populations."
CD010502,0,9529063,0,M protein of the group A Streptococcus binds to the seventh short consensus repeat of human complement factor H.,"Streptococcus pyogenes evades complement by binding the complement-regulatory protein factor H (fH) via the central conserved C-repeat region of M protein. However, the corresponding binding region within fH has not previously been precisely localized. fH is composed of 20 conserved modules called short consensus repeats (SCRs), each of which contains approximately 60 amino acids. A series of fH truncated and deletion mutants were prepared, and their interaction with M6 protein was examined. The M protein binding site was initially localized to SCRs 6 to 15 as demonstrated by ligand dot blotting, chemical cross-linking, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. SCR 7 was then shown to contain the M protein binding site, as a construct consisting of the first seven SCRs bound M protein but a construct containing the first six SCRs did not bind. In addition, deletion of SCR 7 from full-length fH abolished binding to M protein. SCR 7 is known to contain a heparin binding domain, and binding of fH to M6 protein was almost totally inhibited in the presence of 400 U of heparin per ml. These results localize the M6 protein binding site of fH to SCR 7 and indicate that it is in close proximity to the heparin binding site."
CD010502,0,16243478,0,Evaluation of the BD Phoenix Automated Microbiology System SMIC/ID panel for identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of Streptococcus spp.,"The BD Phoenix Automated Microbiology System SMIC/ID panel was evaluated for identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) of various streptococci. A group of 97 consecutive clinical isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 23 Streptococcus pyogenes, 24 Streptococcus agalactiae, and 34 viridans streptococci were collected and comparisons made with routine manual methods used in the clinical microbiology laboratory. Overall, in 162 (91%) of 178 isolates, Phoenix identification results demonstrated agreement. For AST results for the 162 isolates that demonstrated identification concordance, the overall essential agreement rate was 98.5%; the category agreement was 94.9%; and the very major error, major error, and minor error rates were 0%, 0.15%, and 5.8%, respectively. Although relatively high minor error rates were observed with S. pneumoniae and beta-lactams, 79.2% of the 77 minor errors were the result of a single log(2) dilution difference. The Phoenix SMIC/ID panel performed favorably and demonstrated the advantages of automation and simple methodology."
CD010502,0,15243074,0,Evaluation of the Hyplex BloodScreen Multiplex PCR-Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system for direct identification of gram-positive cocci and gram-negative bacilli from positive blood cultures.,"We evaluated the Hyplex BloodScreen PCR-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) system (BAG, Lich, Germany), a new diagnostic test for the direct identification of gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci from positive blood cultures, with 482 positive BACTEC 9240 blood culture bottles. The test involves amplification of the bacterial DNA by multiplex PCR and subsequent hybridization of the PCR product to specific oligonucleotide probes in an ELISA-based format. The available probes allow the separate detection of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis/Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus pneumoniae and the staphylococcal mecA gene. The Hyplex BloodScreen test showed an overall sensitivity of 100% for the identification of gram-negative bacilli and 96.6 to 100% for the identification of gram-positive cocci (S. aureus, 100%; S. epidermidis, 97.2%; Enterococcus faecalis/Enterococcus faecium, 96.6%; and Streptococcus pneumoniae, 100%). The specificities of the test modules ranged from 92.5 to 100% for gram-negative bacilli and 97.7 to 100% for gram-positive cocci (Escherichia coli, 92.5%; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 98.5%; Klebsiella spp., 100%; Enterobacter aerogenes, 100%; S. aureus, 100%, S. epidermidis, 97.7%; Enterococcus faecalis/Enterococcus faecium, 99.6%; Streptococcus pyogenes, 100%; and Streptococcus pneumoniae, 99.3%). The result of the mecA gene detection module correlated with the result of the phenotypic oxacillin resistance testing in all 38 isolates of Staphylococcus aureus investigated. In conclusion, the Hyplex BloodScreen PCR-ELISA system is well suited for the direct and specific identification of the most common pathogenic bacteria and the direct detection of the mecA gene of Staphylococcus aureus in positive blood cultures."

CD010502,0,11367528,0,Multiple ligand binding sites on domain seven of human complement factor H.,"Foreign particles and damaged host cells can activate the complement system leading to their destruction by the host defense system. Factor H (fH) plays a vital role in restricting complement activation on host cells through interactions with polyanions such as heparin, while allowing activation to proceed on foreign surfaces. Complement activation by damaged host cells is also down regulated by fH, which is localized to injured areas through interactions with C-reactive protein (CRP). A number of pathogens have developed mechanisms by which they can also bind fH and thus exploit its protective properties. One such organism is Group A Streptococcus (GAS) which mediates fH binding via its surface expressed M-protein. fH consists of 20 conserved short consensus repeat (SCR) units and mutagenesis studies indicate that the seventh repeat is responsible for interactions with heparin, CRP and M-protein. We recently performed molecular modelling of fH SCR 7 and identified a cluster of positively charged residues on one face of the domain. By alanine replacement mutagenesis, we demonstrated that these residues are involved in heparin, CRP and M protein binding, which indicates that there is a common site within fH SCR 7 responsible for multiple ligand recognition."

It definitely detected the emm1 gene in dot-blotted 20-micrograms amounts of total nucleoid acid extracts. When tested with 27 type M1 group A streptococci of several epidemiologically unrelated outbreaks and 24 non-M1 strains, its sensitivity and specificity of detection reached 100% even at a hybridization temperature 35 degrees C below the calculated Tm. A detailed protocol for the construction and use of this oligonucleotide probe is given."
CD010502,0,18093092,0,The antibacterial activity of peptides derived from human beta-2 glycoprotein I is inhibited by protein H and M1 protein from Streptococcus pyogenes.,"During the last years, the importance of antibacterial peptides has attracted considerable attention. We report here that peptides derived from the fifth domain of beta-2 glycoprotein I (beta(2)GPI), a human heparin binding plasma protein, have antibacterial activities against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Streptococcus pyogenes, an important human pathogen that can survive and grow in human blood, has developed mechanisms to escape the attack by these peptides. Thus, protein H and M1 protein, two surface proteins of the highly pathogenic S. pyogenes AP1 strain, bind full-length beta(2)GPI and thereby prevent the processing of beta(2)GPI by proteases from polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) into antibacterial peptides. In addition, protein H and M1 protein, released from the bacterial cell wall by PMN-derived proteases, bind to, and inhibit the activity of, beta(2)GPI-derived antibacterial peptides. Taken together, the data suggest that the interaction between the streptococcal proteins and beta(2)GPI or beta(2)GPI-derived peptides presents a novel mechanism to resist an antibacterial attack by beta(2)GPI-cleavage products."

CD010502,0,18201679,0,Group B Streptococcus and pregnancy: a review.,"In the 1960s, early onset neonatal sepsis caused by group B Streptococcus (GBS) had an attack rate of 2 per 1000 live births and a 50% fatality rate. Early treatment and then antibiotic prophylaxis were shown to reduce morbidity and mortality rates; however, GBS remains a leading cause of perinatal infection. This article will review our investigations and related studies, including our studies in monkeys, that have contributed to current diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of disease caused by GBS. Although it has not been possible to eradicate GBS colonization, intravenous antibiotic prophylaxis given during parturition has been effective in the prevention of vertical transmission in animals and humans. Recently, diagnostic tests with polymerase chain reaction have offered promise for rapid accurate detection. This could lead to a major shift in the timing of diagnosis from the office setting to delivery suite. The potential for immunization remains a challenge."

It is not known why GBS infections have this age distribution which differs from that of invasive infections caused by other encapsulated bacteria. The aim of this study was to test the possibility that serum antibodies against the GBS capsular polysaccharides (CPS) are acquired during the first months of life thereby preventing infections after the neonatal period. Cord sera were collected from 321 healthy term newborns. A second blood sample was collected at 2, 4, 8, 13 or 26 weeks of age. IgG CPS antibodies (measured by ELISA) against serotypes Ia, II and III were present in 98%-100% of all cord sera and decreased continuously during the first 6 months of life. No IgM antibodies against serotype III CPS were present in cord sera. Only 16%-17% of the children acquired IgM antibodies against serotype III CPS at 3 and 6 months of age."

To investigate the effect of group A streptococci (GAS) on the migration of T cells in psoriasis, CLA expression was assessed by double-staining for CD3 and the HECA-452 epitope on peripheral blood T cells from 13 patients with psoriasis, 10 patients with other inflammatory skin diseases and 12 normal controls before and after 7 days culture with a GAS sonicate, Candida albicans (control antigen) or medium. In addition, CLA+, and CLA-, CD3+ CD45RO+ subsets were isolated from individuals in each group and V beta 2 expression and proliferation to GAS studied. Mean CLA expression by freshly isolated T cells was almost identical in the three groups. After culture with GAS, T cells from the psoriatic patients and control showed a significant increase in mean percentage CLA+ expression compared to medium (P < 0.002, P < 0.05, respectively). This induction was inhibited by the addition of anti-IL-12 antibody. However, in psoriatic patients, but not in controls, the GAS-induced increase was significantly greater than that of C. albicans (P < 0.002) and was accompanied by a decrease in T cells positive for the peripheral lymph node homing receptor, L-selectin (P < 0.05). The percentage of V beta 2+ T cells was markedly higher in the CLA+ than in the CLA- T-cell subset in psoriatic patients (P < 0.01) and controls; both subsets proliferated to GAS, in each group. These findings suggest a differential modulation of specific tissue homing receptors on T cells by GAS in psoriasis."
CD010502,0,16088826,0,Evolutionary origin and emergence of a highly successful clone of serotype M1 group a Streptococcus involved multiple horizontal gene transfer events.,"To better understand the molecular events involved in the origin of new pathogenic bacteria, we studied the evolution of a highly virulent clone of serotype M1 group A Streptococcus (GAS). Genomic, DNA-DNA microarray, and single-nucleotide polymorphism analyses indicated that this clone evolved through a series of horizontal gene transfer events that involved (1) the acquisition of prophages encoding streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin A and extracellular DNases and (2) the reciprocal recombination of a 36-kb chromosomal region encoding the extracellular toxins NAD+-glycohydrolase (NADase) and streptolysin O (SLO). These gene transfer events were associated with significantly increased production of SLO and NADase. Virtual identity in the 36-kb region present in contemporary serotype M1 and M12 isolates suggests that a serotype M12 strain served as the donor of this region. Multiple horizontal gene transfer events were a crucial factor in the evolutionary origin and emergence of a very abundant contemporary clone of serotype M1 GAS."
CD010502,0,16088825,0,Genome sequence of a serotype M28 strain of group a streptococcus: potential new insights into puerperal sepsis and bacterial disease specificity.,"Puerperal sepsis, a major cause of death of young women in Europe in the 1800s, was due predominantly to the gram-positive pathogen group A Streptococcus. Studies conducted during past decades have shown that serotype M28 strains are the major group A Streptococcus organisms responsible for many of these infections. To begin to increase our understanding of their enrichment in puerperal sepsis, we sequenced the genome of a genetically representative strain. This strain has genes encoding a novel array of prophage virulence factors, cell-surface proteins, and other molecules likely to contribute to host-pathogen interactions. Importantly, genes for 7 inferred extracellular proteins are encoded by a 37.4-kb foreign DNA element that is shared with group B Streptococcus and is present in all serotype M28 strains. Proteins encoded by the 37.4-kb element were expressed extracellularly and in human infections. Acquisition of foreign genes has helped create a disease-specialist clone of this pathogen."

CD010502,0,22386185,0,Current concepts in laboratory testing to guide antimicrobial therapy.,"Antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) is indicated for pathogens contributing to an infectious process that warrants antimicrobial therapy if susceptibility to antimicrobials cannot be predicted reliably based on knowledge of their identity. Such tests are most frequently used when the etiologic agents are members of species capable of demonstrating resistance to commonly prescribed antibiotics. Some organisms have predictable susceptibility to antimicrobial agents (ie, Streptococcus pyogenes to penicillin), and empirical therapy for these organisms is typically used. Therefore, AST for such pathogens is seldom required or performed. In addition, AST is valuable in evaluating the activity of new and experimental compounds and investigating the epidemiology of antimicrobial resistant pathogens. Several laboratory methods are available to characterize the in vitro susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial agents. When the nature of the infection is unclear and the culture yields mixed growth or usual microbiota (wherein the isolates usually bear little relationship to the actual infectious process), AST is usually unnecessary and results may, in fact, be dangerously misleading. Phenotypic methods for detection of specific antimicrobial resistance mechanisms are increasingly being used to complement AST (ie, inducible clindamycin resistance among several gram-positive bacteria) and to provide clinicians with preliminary direction for antibiotic selection pending results generated from standardized AST (ie, β-lactamase tests). In addition, molecular methods are being developed and incorporated by microbiology laboratories into resistance detection algorithms for rapid, sensitive assessment of carriage states of epidemiologically and clinically important pathogens, often directly from clinical specimens (ie, presence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci in fecal specimens)."

A total of 19 biopsy specimens were taken from these nine patients. In six of the 19 specimens, a histologic diagnosis of scleroma was not possible. Seventeen of the specimens with characteristic histologic findings stained with the peroxidase-antiperoxidase method for detection of Klebsiella capsular antigen III, although in 11 of these specimens, simultaneous cultures failed to reveal the characteristic Klebsiella rhinoscleromatis. These specimens showed the features of one of the three histopathologic forms of scleroma: ozena, granuloma, or scleroma. A range of tissue reactions was identified: histiocyte and plasma cell nodules, vasculitis, acute inflammation, pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia, ulceration, and submucosal keratin cyst. Comparison with histochemical bacterial stains revealed that the PAS and Hotchkiss-McManus stains gave unequivocal positive results less frequently than the immunoperoxidase method, and were less specific. Methenamine silver, Giemsa, Deiterle, Brown and Brenn, and Brown and Hopps were unreliable for the detection of the organism. The immunoperoxidase method can be appropriately used when the spectrum of histopathologic findings suggests a differential diagnosis of scleroma."

The antigen was detected in virus nonproducer lines (less than 0.01% EBV early antigen expression) and is thus not dependent on the viral cycle. It was differentially expressed depending on the origin of the lines. All 10 lymphoblastoid cell lines tested expressed EBNA5, but it could not be detected in 10 of 11 EBV-carrying Burkitt lymphoma lines. Infection of tonsillar lymphocytes with the B95-8 strain of EBV induced six EBNA5-specific polypeptides that varied between 41 and 70 kDa in molecular size with regular increments of 6 kDa. This may be due to the fact that the EBNA5 coding sequence includes the Bam W internal repeat. Parallel infection of the EBV-negative Burkitt lymphoma line Ramos with the same viral substrain did not induce detectable levels of EBNA5, nor was this antigen present in permanently EBV-converted Ramos sublines. These findings imply that the expression of the viral genome varies among B cells having different phenotypes."
CD010502,0,20219537,0,Interplay of protease-activated receptors and NOD pattern recognition receptors in epithelial innate immune responses to bacteria.,"Protease-activated receptors (PARs), nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD) receptors and Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play a role in innate immunity, but little is known about interaction between these receptors. The goal of this study was to investigate how silencing one receptor affects the expression of other receptors and downstream innate immune markers in response to bacteria. Human gingival epithelial cells (GECs) were transfected with siRNA specific for PAR1 or PAR2, then stimulated with periopathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis, bridging organism between pathogens and non-pathogens Fusobacterium nucleatum, or non-pathogen Streptococcus gordonii. PAR1 or PAR2 knock-down resulted in up-regulated NOD1 and NOD2 expression with P. gingivalis or F. nucleatum stimulation (p<0.01), as well as enhanced TLR2 and TLR4 expression when cells were stimulated by bacteria that utilize TLR2 or TLR4, respectively. Involvement of PARs for induction of CC chemokine ligand 20 (CCL20), a cytokine with antimicrobial properties, was observed following stimulation of the three bacterial species. Furthermore, results from multiple cytokine ELISA array showed receptors utilized in the induction of various innate immune markers are tailored to individual bacterium tested. Our data suggest complex interplay of several receptors is required for appropriate innate immune responses to the different types of bacteria present within the oral cavity and that receptor expression itself is altered depending on which organism the cell encounters."
CD010502,0,7981150,0,Identification of T cell autoepitopes that cross-react with the C-terminal segment of the M protein of group A streptococci.,"Rheumatic fever (RF) follows a throat infection with different M-serotypes of beta-hemolytic group A streptococci (GAS) and can affect different tissues, predominantly the heart. It is thought to be an autoimmune illness. Although histological examination of affected heart shows an infiltrate consisting mainly of T cells, antigens or epitopes that could be putative targets of autoimmune T cells have not been identified. We have examined the T cell response to the conserved C-terminal region of the M protein--a streptococcal surface coiled-coil protein which is the target of opsonic antibodies and antibodies which cross-react with human heart tissue. Australian Aborigine, Caucasian and Thai patients, controls and mice were studied to define regions of the protein immunogenic for T cells, and T cell lines and clones were tested for cross-reactivity to myosin as well as an extract of RF-diseased mitral heart valve. Murine (B10, B10.D2, B10.BR) M peptide-specific T cells were often cross-reactive for other M peptides but did not cross-react with human heart antigens. Patients with RF or other heart diseases, or control subjects exposed more commonly to GAS were more likely to have T cell responses to the M protein, with many regions of the C-terminus being recognized. T cell lines and a clone specific for different M peptides were generated from five donors. Cross-reactivity could be shown between different M peptides, but unlike murine M peptide-specific T cells three of the human T cell lines reacted strongly to peptides representing homologous regions of cardiac and skeletal muscle myosins, and two of these lines also responded to porcine myosin and an extract of human rheumatic mitral valve. However, these last two lines were derived from a normal donor without history of RF or other heart disease. Our data demonstrate that regions of the M protein, including regions that are being considered as subunit vaccines, have the potential to stimulate pre-existing heart cross-reactive T cells, but that the ability of such T cells to cross-react (as measured in vitro) is not in itself sufficient to lead to disease."

CD010502,0,8983566,0,[Necrotizing descendent mediastinitis of oropharyngeal origin].,"The spread of oropharyngeal infections to the mediastinum can give rise to descending necrotizing mediastinitis (DNM), which causes a high rate of mortality (around 40%), particularly when diagnosis is late and drainage inadequate. In the first case we report, successful drainage of the mediastinum was achieved at the cervical and sub-xiphisternum levels and by thoracotomy. Given the condition of the second patient, transcervical drainage alone was considered the best option, but this treatment was inadequate. Rapid start of appropriate drainage of the mediastinum is of great importance. Cervical drains, which may be adequate when there is perforation of the cervical esophagus, is insufficient in DNM, which calls for more aggressive, early drainage, such as can be achieved by thoracotomy. Computerized axial tomography of the chest is essential for rapid diagnosis, to plan the most appropriate surgical approach and for follow-up and evaluation of drainage."

M. pneumoniae were cultivated from sputa, and Mycoplasma serology was done with paired sera by both complement fixation and enzyme immunoassay techniques. Comparison of the probe test results with the Mycoplasma culture and serologic results showed that the Gen-Probe test was sensitive and specific for the rapid diagnosis of acute M. pneumoniae infection of the lower respiratory tract when sputum was used: It had good sensitivity (0.95) and specificity (0.85) among patients whose serologic results were consistent with their culture results. In contrast, the probe test performed with throat swabs seemed to have only limited value."

Peripheral blood mononuclear cell responses to whole type M22 group A streptococci were significantly increased in guttate, but not chronic plaque, psoriasis patients compared to 17 non-psoriatic controls (p < 0.05; n = 17). A significant reduction of this response was observed in both guttate (p < 0.001; n = 17) and chronic plaque (p < 0.01; n = 27) psoriatic patients, but not in the control group, after repeated trypsinization to remove M protein from the streptococci. Furthermore, the difference between the peripheral blood mononuclear cell response to untrypsinized and trypsinized streptococci was significantly greater in the guttate patients than in the controls (p < 0.02). This preliminary study has shown an increased reactivity of T lymphocytes with specificity for trypsin-sensitive protein expressed by type M22 streptococci in the peripheral blood of patients with psoriasis."

CD010502,0,22521051,0,Optimization of a rapid diagnostic test for detection of group B streptococcus from antepartum patients.,"We analyzed the performance of a new rapid diagnostic test for use in determining group B streptococcus colonization in pregnancy. Vaginal-rectal specimens were compared by the rapid test, a commercial laboratory culture result, and an in-house culture. Of 150 patient samples, 72 were positive by the rapid test, giving a prevalence of 48.0% versus 24.7% by traditional culture. Characterization of these results showed cross-reactivity with Enterococcus. The addition of bacitracin reduced this interference, and when reanalyzed, a colonization rate of 31.3% was found (P = 0.3961, chi-square), as well as a sensitivity of 100% (95% confidence interval [CI] 89.1-100) and a specificity of 93.6% (95% CI 86.9-97.2). The addition of bacitracin greatly improves the reliability of this diagnostic test and demonstrates a novel approach to reduce interference. An accurate determination of the test's sensitivity and specificity, however, awaits enrollment of the remaining subjects."

CD010502,0,18200819,0,Rheumatic heart disease: 15 years of clinical and immunological follow-up.,"Rheumatic fever (RF) is a sequel of group A streptococcal throat infection and occurs in untreated susceptible children. Rheumatic heart disease (RHD), the major sequel of RF, occurs in 30%-45% of RF patients. RF is still considered endemic in some regions of Brazil and is responsible for approximately 90% of early childhood valvular surgery in the country. In this study, we present a 15-year clinical follow-up of 25 children who underwent surgical valvular repair. Histopathological and immunological features of heart tissue lesions of RHD patients were also evaluated. The patients presented severe forms of RHD with congestive symptoms at a very young age. Many of them had surgery at the acute phase of RF. Histological analysis showed the presence of dense valvular inflammatory infiltrates and Aschoff nodules in the myocardium of 21% of acute RHD patients. Infiltrating T-cells were mainly CD4+ in heart tissue biopsies of patients with rheumatic activity. In addition, CD4+ and CD8+ infiltrating T-cell clones recognized streptococcal M peptides and cardiac tissue proteins. These findings may open the possibilities of new ways of immunotherapy. In addition, we demonstrated that the surgical procedure during acute phase of the disease improved the quality of life of young RHD patients."
CD010502,0,10959641,0,Infective endocarditis: a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge for the new millennium.,"This review on infective endocarditis (IE) is based on clinical studies carried out in Göteborg since 1984, data obtained from a Swedish national registry of IE since 1995 and existing literature. IE is still a great challenge in medicine, although improved bacteriological and echocardiographical techniques have facilitated diagnosis. In Sweden the incidence of IE is about 6 per 100,000 inhabitants a year. During recent decades IE has changed character. Patients are older, fever is often the only major symptom and a new murmur is less frequent. Streptococci, including viridans species and staphylococci, are still the most common bacteria found. Antibiotic treatment for 4-6 weeks may reduce mortality of IE to 30-50%. For further reduction, heart surgery is necessary in 20-25% of patients in order to remove infected tissues and restore valve function. Rapid diagnosis, careful antibiotic treatment and optimal surgery may reduce mortality associated with treatment to 10%. Antibiotic treatment is still mainly empiric. Penicillin and aminoglycoside for 2 weeks only seem to be effective in uncomplicated IE caused by alpha-streptococci. Otherwise, 4 weeks of treatment is needed, but aminoglycoside treatment may be reduced to 1 week in general and 2 weeks for enterococcal infections."
CD010502,0,2072960,1,[Evaluation of a rapid test for direct detection of group A streptococcal antigen in throat swabs. Study of 4 commercial test systems].,"Four commercially prepared test reagent kits for the rapid screening of throat swabs for group A streptococci were examined in comparison to bacteriological cultures of 963 double throat swabs. The sensitivities of the test systems were 86.7% (Abbott Test Pack Strep A), 81.8% (Hybritech Tandem Icon Strep A), 79.6% (Pharmacia Phadirect Strep A), and 72.6% (Wellcome Reveal Colour Strep A) respectively. The specificity of the four tests was above 90%. Marked variations between different test reagent batches could be observed. The two tests based on the enzyme immunoassay principle proved to be superior to the agglutination tests investigated with respect to sensitivity and reading accuracy. Our results are evaluated in the light of the published literature on these tests."
CD010502,0,10959645,0,Beta-haemolytic streptococci isolated from acute sore-throat patients: cause or coincidence? A case-control study in general practice.,"As beta-haemolytic streptococci can be cultured in people with and in those without a sore throat, a case-control study was set up in 43 family practices in The Netherlands. The association was tested between the number of colony counts, specific T/M types and exotoxin genes and an acute sore throat. Duplicate throat swabs were taken from 663 sore-throat patients, selected by clinical criteria, and from 694 healthy controls. They were cultured for beta-haemolytic streptococci by combining several updated laboratory methods. Approximately 40% of the controls and 80% of the patients had beta-haemolytic streptococci-positive cultures. When focusing on cultures with high colony counts, not only group A (46%), but also non-group A streptococci (20%), predominated significantly in adult patients compared with controls. No T/M or exotoxin gene type was significantly more prevalent in patients than in controls. Thus, semiquantitative analysis, but not T/M and exotoxin gene typing, showed an association between beta-haemolytic streptococci and active disease. Groups A, C and G streptococci were found to be potentially pathogenic in adult sore-throat patients, and should be included in the discussion on the use of rapid antigen detection tests and penicillin treatment in primary care."
CD010502,0,18685016,0,Seroreactivity against streptococcal DRS (distantly related to SIC) protein is a predictor for end-stage renal failure.,"We hypothesized that immunoreactivity against antigens from nephritic strains of Streptococcus pyogenes may be elevated in patients with end-stage renal failure (ESRF). Additionally, we investigated whether a difference in seroreactivity exists between nonindigenous and indigenous (Aboriginal/Torres Strait Islander) patients. To examine these possibilities, antibodies against potentially nephritogenic proteins, streptokinase (Ska1) (from M1), streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin type B (SpeB) (from M1), the streptococcal inhibitor of complement-mediated cell lysis (SIC) (from M1) and its two variants, closely related to SIC (CRS) (from M57) and distantly related to SIC (DRS) (from M12) were determined in 66 patients and 31 healthy controls by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. A significantly higher proportion of patients compared to controls were seropositive to Ska1 (P = 0.004), DRS (P = 0.0003), CRS (P = 0.001), and SIC (P = 0.018). Regression analysis showed that seroreactivity to DRS (r(2) = 0.85, P = 0.001) predicted the development of ESRF and that being diabetic was positively associated with being an ESRF patient (r(2) = 0.37, P < 0.0001) and being indigenous (r(2) = 0.47, P < 0.0001). These results suggest that these ESRF patients were exposed to strains of S. pyogenes that secrete Ska1, DRS, CRS, and SIC and may have pathological significance. No significant difference was observed between the indigenous patients and nonindigenous patients."
CD010502,0,3612389,0,Pneumonia in pediatric outpatients: cause and clinical manifestations.,"The cause and clinical manifestations of pneumonia were studied in 98 pediatric outpatients. A viral diagnosis was established in 38 (39%) of the 98 patients, and a bacterial diagnosis in 19 (19%). Ten (53%) of the 19 patients with bacterial pneumonia had a concurrent viral infection. No clinical, laboratory, or radiographic findings that would reliably differentiate viral from bacterial infection were identified. This study suggests that bacterial pneumonia is more common in pediatric outpatients than previously reported, and that the clinical, laboratory, and radiographic findings in patients with bacterial infection may be indistinguishable from findings in patients with viral infection."

Serum, urine and either sputum or nasopharyngeal secretions were collected during the first 5 days of therapy for antigen detection. Blood culture was positive in 6 of 52 (11.5%) of cases. Antigens were detected by counterimmunoelectrophoresis and/or LA in 13 of 60 (21.7%) serum samples, 2 of 16 (12.5%) unconcentrated urine samples, 19 of 42 (45.2%) urine samples concentrated 25-fold and 21 of 45 (46.7%) sputum or nasopharyngeal secretions. Antibiotic treatment for 5 days did not affect the antigen detection rate. Counter-immunoelectrophoresis was more sensitive than LA in serum and urine but not in sputum. However, because false positive reactions were frequently obtained with LA on nasopharyngeal secretions of an age-matched control group, this test appears unreliable."

CD010502,0,8233725,0,Complement activation in newborn infants with early onset infection.,"The complement system is an important element in host defense. Quantitative deficiencies of total hemolytic complement activity and decreased C3 levels were reported in sera from normal neonates. However, little is known about complement activation products in the newborn. In a prospective study, complement activation products were determined in 32 healthy term neonates, in 41 neonates with colonization of their mothers, in 15 colonized neonates, and in 10 neonates with early onset infection. In all newborns, EDTA plasma was obtained within the first 6 h of life. The anaphylatoxin C3a-desArg was determined with a novel ELISA using an MAb reacting with a neoepitope of C3a-desArg. C3bBbP (alternative pathway convertase) and C1rsC1-inactivator (activation product of classical pathway) were measured with double-sandwich ELISA. C3 was determined by radial immunodiffusion. Plasma concentrations of C3a-desArg were similar in healthy term neonates and healthy adults, whereas diminished C3 levels were observed in the newborn infants. There were no significant differences between healthy neonates, neonates with colonized mothers, and colonized neonates. In neonates with infection, a significant elevation of C3a-desArg was found at the onset of the disease, resulting from alternative pathway activation. In contrast, the C1rsC1-inactivator complex showed no significant differences among healthy, colonized, and infected neonates. The anaphylatoxin C3a mediates inflammatory reactions such as vasodilatation and an increase in microvascular permeability and might therefore play an important role in severe neonatal infection."
CD010502,0,17644718,0,Chlamydophila psittaci genotype E/B transmission from African grey parrots to humans.,"Thirty-six birds from a parrot relief and breeding centre, as well as the manager, were examined for the presence of Chlamydophila psittaci. In the relief unit, 5 of 20 African grey parrots showed depression, ruffled feathers, loss of weight and mild dyspnoea. The birds received no antibiotic treatment. Birds of the breeding unit, 14 blue and gold macaws and 2 green-winged macaws, were healthy. They received doxycycline at the start of each breeding season. The manager complained of shortness of breath but took no medication. Using a nested PCR enzyme immunoassay (EIA), Cp. psittaci was detected in the faeces of all five sick birds, as well as in a nasal and pharyngeal swab from the manager. The veterinarian and her assistant became infected while sampling the parrots, as pharyngeal and nasal swabs from both were positive by nested PCR/EIA after visiting the parrot relief and breeding centre, but they showed no clinical signs of infection. Bacteria could be isolated from three of five nested PCR/EIA-positive birds, the manager and the veterinarian, but not from the veterinary assistant. Using an ompA genotype-specific real-time PCR, Cp. psittaci genotype E/B was identified as the transmitted strain. All breeding birds tested negative for Cp. psittaci. This is believed to be the first report on Cp. psittaci genotype E/B transmission from parrots to humans. In contradiction to genotype A strains, which are thought to be highly virulent to both birds and men, the currently described genotype E/B strain apparently caused no severe clinical symptoms in either parrots or humans."
CD010502,0,16714223,0,"Cellular and humoral systemic and mucosal immune responses stimulated in volunteers by an oral polybacterial immunomodulator ""Dentavax"".","The oral polybacterial immunomodulator Dentavax (D), composed of killed cells from Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans and Lactobacillus acidophilus and their lysates was created for immunoprophylaxis and therapy of oral mucosa and parodont inflammations. The stimulating effect of the preparation was evaluated in twelve volunteers immunized for 10 consecutive days. On days 7, 14, 21, 28 and 49 after the last immunization peripheral blood (PB) lymphocyte subsets, T lymphocyte activation and PB phagocytic activity, were studied by flow cytometry. PB lymphocyte proliferative responses to PHA, rIL-2, LPS and D were evaluated radiometrically. The production of TNF-alpha in supernatants of in vitro stimulated lymphocytes and specific IgA, IgM and IgG antibodies in serum and saliva was determined by ELISA. Ultrastructural morphologic changes in T and B lymphocyte populations were also investigated. Although no significant changes in the levels of basic lymphocyte subsets were detected, the early/late (CD57+/CD57-) CD8 T effectors ratio was increased at the end of the studied period, as were the percentage of PHA-responding (CD69+) T cells and PB phagocytizing cells. The most prominent lymphoprolipherative responses were measured upon costimulation with LPS+D and PHA+D on day 21. Electron-microscopic studies demonstrated a significant effect of D on both T and B cell activity. TNF-alpha concentration increased progressively from day 7 till the end of the investigation. Maximal concentrations were observed after stimulation with D and LPS. An increased level of specific salivary and serum antibodies against the components of D was found, with highest levels between days 7 and 21. Specific secretory IgA predominated in saliva as compared to IgM and IgG. Our results demonstrate the stimulating effect of Dentavax on PB lymphocyte functional activity and the specific humoral systemic and mucosal immunity."
CD010502,0,1541144,0,Adverse effect of chronic tonsillitis on clinical course of sarcoidosis in relation to HLA distribution.,"We examined the effect of chronic inflammatory foci in the upper respiratory tract and/or HLA class 2 antigens on the clinical course of sarcoidosis. Sarcoidosis resolved spontaneously in 6 of 27 (22 percent) patients with CTL and in 19 of 29 (66 percent) without CTL (p less than 0.01). The clinical course became favorable after TLT in 7 of 14 cases with CTL. Patients with HLA-DR9 and DRw8 showed the highest ratio of patients who had protracted clinical course; those with HLA-DR2, DR5 and DR6 showed the lowest; and those with HLA-DR4, DRw52 and Drw53 were between these levels. A high responsiveness to SCW antigens was seen more frequently in sarcoidosis patients with protracted clinical course. The high responsiveness to SCW antigens was related to HLA-DR4, DRw8, DR9 and DRw53 in sarcoidosis patients. HLA antigens, especially HLA-DR, modulate the immune response to inhaled antigenic agents. Immune response seemed to affect the clinical course of sarcoidosis."

The allelic diversity of streptococcal DNase B (sdaB) gene was investigated in 83 strains with 14 emm genotypes. Of the 15 alleles identified, 11 alleles carried only synonymous nucleotide substitutions. On the other hand, 4 alleles had a non-synonymous substitution other than synonymous substitutions, resulting in the substitution of a single amino acid. The distribution of each allele was generally emm genotype-specific. Only sdaB7 was found in both emm2 and emm4. The promoter region was highly conserved and DNase B protein was similarly expressed in all alleles."
CD010502,0,21251553,0,Molecular analysis of Streptococcus pyogenes strains isolated from Chinese children with pharyngitis.,"Streptococcus pyogenes is an important gram-positive bacterial pathogen that causes various human diseases, of which streptococcal pharyngitis is the most common. In this work, a total of 185 S. pyogenes isolated from Chinese children with pharyngitis was analyzed by superantigen (SAg) genes, emm genotyping, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Fifty-eight (31.4%) isolates were also typed by multilocus sequence typing (MLST). The results indicate that most of the emm1 isolates possessed speA (88.5%) and speJ (83.6%), and few isolates possessed speI gene (13.1%). In contrast, none of the emm12-type isolates possessed speJ; few isolates possessed speA (5.2%); and most of the isolates possessed speI (91.7%). PFGE analysis revealed 25 different clusters, and MLST was performed for 2 predominant emm-type isolates; emm12 isolates belonged to ST36 while emm1 isolates belonged to ST28. As far as this collection is concerned, emm1 and emm12 are the prevalent genotypes among S. pyogenes strains associated with children's pharyngitis in China. Most of the pharyngitis strains can be covered by a 26-valent vaccine. A strong correspondence is found only in the direction of emm type for both SAg profiles and PFGE types but not in the reverse direction."
CD010502,0,2862035,0,Colonization antigens and haemagglutination patterns of human Escherichia coli.,"The haemagglutinating properties of 223 (35 enterotoxigenic and 188 non-enterotoxigenic) Escherichia coli strains with nine erythrocyte types were investigated; 153 strains were also tested for beta-haemolysis and colicin production and for the presence of CFA/I, CFA/II, K88 and K99 antigens. A selected group of strains was also examined by electron microscopy to determine the presence of fimbriae or fibrils and to establish the relationship between these, the haemagglutinating properties and the presence of colonization antigens. Generally, the haemagglutinating patterns yielded by the same strains grown in Mueller Hinton broth and on CFA agar differed considerably. Mannose-sensitive haemagglutinating (MSHA) patterns were more homogeneous than mannose-resistant haemagglutinating (MRHA) patterns. Forty-seven percent of the non-enterotoxigenic MRHA+ strains were haemolytic while only 6% of the remaining strains were (chi2 correction = 34.01; p less than 0.001). CFA/I was only detected in the four enterotoxigenic MRHA+ strains which were positive only with human and calf erythrocytes when grown on CFA agar. CFA/II was detected in three of a total of six enterotoxigenic strains which were MRHA+ only with calf erythrocytes when grown on CFA agar. K88 and K99 antigens were not detected. All strains in which bacteria with fimbriae or fibrils were observed showed haemagglutinating activity. Thus, 18 (66.7%) of the 27 haemagglutinating strains grown on CFA agar showed fimbriae or fibrils while none of the 19 non-haemagglutinating strains did (chi2 correction = 18.10; p less than 0.001)."

First, we compared the detection threshold and the ease of use of GBSDA with LIM-BA by inoculating known numbers of GBS mixed with approximately 10(5) cfu of other bacteria. Second, we tested the production of carotenoid pigment in 155 GBS blood culture isolates. Finally, we compared GBSDA, LIM broth with direct GBS antigen detection (LIM-AG) and LIM-BA as methods for GBS screening in pregnant women. GBS colonies were easily detected on GBSDA at a threshold of 20 cfu. In contrast, GBS was not detected in a mixed culture from LIM broth with initial inocula of up to 100 cfu. Orange pigment was produced in 146/155 GBS blood culture isolates. Pigment was not produced in eight non-hemolytic and two hemolytic strains. GBS was detected by GBSDA in 58 out of 297 parturient women (19.5%) but in only 50 (16.8%, P > 0.05) and 46 (15.4%, P = 0.079) women by LIM-BA and LIM-AG, respectively. GBSDA is a satisfactory medium for the rapid detection of most GBS isolates, but other methods may be needed if detection of all non-pigmented strains is required."

These patients are often screened for glandular fever in addition to routine haematological tests. In our unit, we have screened 66 patients with quinsy for glandular fever over a period of 12 months. All these patients were screened for glandular fever by rapid immunoassay. Only one out of 66 patients was tested positive for glandular fever. Due to the extremely low incidence of glandular fever in quinsy patients, we do not see any relevance in screening for glandular fever in quinsy patients. Hence we recommend that routine screening for glandular fever in quinsy patients is an unnecessary invasive investigation for the patients and not cost effective for the hospital."

This work begins to characterize GBS GAPDH and to assess its functional activity on the cell surface. The 1.0-kb gapC gene of GBS was amplified by PCR. plr and gapC demonstrated 87% homology. An anti-Plr monoclonal antibody reacted with GBS whole cells, suggesting GBS GAPDH is surface localized. Multiple serotypes of GBS demonstrated functional GAPDH on their surfaces. The anti-Plr monoclonal antibody recognized GBS protein bands of approximately 41 and 173.5 kDa, by Western blot. Presumably, these represent monomeric and tetrameric forms of the GAPDH molecule. GBS GAPDH was demonstrated by Western blot analysis to interact with lys- and glu-plasminogens. Fluid-phase GBS GAPDH interacted, by means of ELISA, with immobilized lys-plasminogen, glu-plasminogen, actin, and fibrinogen. Enzymatically active GAPDH, capable of binding cytoskeletal and extracellular matrix proteins, is expressed on the surface of GBS."
CD010502,0,1867033,0,[The modification of the cell wall proteins in group A streptococci type M 29 under the influence of spermidine contained in the culture medium].,"The addition of spermidine into growth medium used for the cultivation of group A streptococci, type M 29, leads to changes in the amino acid composition of cell walls and surface proteins isolated by the method of E. H. Beachey et al. The separation of surface proteins into fibrinogen-binding proteins and fibrinogen receptors by affinity chromatography techniques on cellulose with covalently bound fibrinogen indicates that the proportion of these proteins in pepsin extracts obtained from different strains varies. Both spermidine and avirulent strains have similar content of fibrinogen-binding proteins, although these proteins are absent in virulent strains. Different amounts of fibrinogen receptors are extracted from all strains. As shown in the enzyme immunoassay, fibrinogen receptors contain no group-specific polysaccharide A, Fc-receptors and interact with total antiserum to group A streptococci, type M 29 [correction of 28]. Fibrinogen receptors isolated from the strains under study have been found to have similar amino acid composition. On the basis of these results we believe that neither receptor capacity to fibrinogen nor amino acid composition is indicative of the protective properties of protein M."
CD010502,0,3900042,0,Biochemical and biological properties of the binding of human fibrinogen to M protein in group A streptococci.,"Fibrinogen is known to bind to group A streptococci and precipitate with extracts containing streptococcal M protein. We have previously shown that the binding of fibrinogen to M-positive streptococci prevents opsonization by complement and protects that organism from phagocytosis in nonimmune blood. In the present study, we used 3H-labeled fibrinogen, a highly purified peptide fragment of type 24 M protein (pep M24), and anti-pep M sera to show that fibrinogen binds to M-positive streptococci with high affinity (dissociation constants, 1 to 5 nM); occupation of the high-affinity binding sites suffices to protect the organism from phagocytosis; proteolytic treatments that remove M protein from streptococcal cells abolish binding; binding is competitively inhibited by anti-pep M sera; pep M24 precipitates fibrinogen; and binding to type 24 cells is inhibited by pep M24. We conclude that M protein is the cell surface structure principally responsible for binding fibrinogen on the surface of M-positive streptococci and that this binding contributes to the known antiopsonic property of M proteins."
CD010502,0,6336161,0,Analysis of lymphocytes in tonsils and blood from patients with chronic tonsillitis.,"A series of B, T and natural killer cell (NK) monoclonal antibodies was used to determine the distribution of lymphocyte subpopulations in cell suspensions obtained from tonsils of seventeen patients with chronic tonsillitis. The percentage of lymphocytes reacting with the monoclonal antibodies was determined by means of cytofluorometry. The majority of the tonsillar lymphocytes stained with the B-cell specific monoclonal antibody OKB-7. The T lymphocytes were composed of a majority of OKT4+ lymphocytes. Only a minority of the lymphocytes stained with the NK cell specific antibody Leu-7, whereas Leu-11b+ lymphocytes were virtually absent. In ten out of the seventeen patients T lymphocytes were purified from the tonsils and the blood and studied for the presence of the following activation antigens: OKT9, OKT10 and anti-HLA-Dr. These antigens were not detected on the membrane of these lymphocytes. This indicates that T lymphocytes activated in vivo express these antigens in a low amount."

The concentrations of antibody needed to protect mice against 90% lethal dose challenge varied with the bacterial inoculum and ranged from 0.25 to 1 microgram/ml using five strains of group B Streptococcus type Ia. Affinity-chromatographed antibody gave results comparable to serum, indicating the specificity of the antibody and the absence of other humoral factors in protection with this serum. Sera from 11 infected infants and their mothers had concentrations of antibody of less than or equal to 0.17 micrograms/ml, below the protective level delineated in the experimental model. Twelve percent of 50 adult women and 36% of 25 women colonized with group B Streptococcus type Ia had antibody levels of greater than or equal to 1 microgram/ml."
CD010502,0,8926181,1,[Reliability of the rapid Streptococcus A test].,"The results of three second-generation immune assays for direct detection of group A streptococcus were compared in 65 patients with acute pharyngitis. The assays included Strep A Plus, (Abbott), Concise Strep A (Hybritech) and Cards Plus (Pacific Biotech). A standard culture was used as reference. Additionally a nucleic acid hybridization assay (Gen-Probe) was applied after enhanced broth culturing. The sensitivities and specificities of the three immunoassays were similar and showed that Strep A Plus had an 84.2% sensitivity and 88.9% specificity, Concise Strep A an 82.4% sensitivity and 92.3% specificity, and Cards Plus an 84.2% specificity and 90.7% sensitivity. The Concise Strep A had significantly more doubtful results in comparison with the two other rapid immune assays (9.7% versus 2.3%, P = 0.034. The standard culture and the DNA probe test gave the same results in 94% of cases. Clinical parameters were found to be unreliable for the diagnosis of group A streptococcal pharyngitis. However, findings show that when the rapid immune assay is positive, it is reasonable to start antibiotic treatment without performing a bacterial culture. In cases with a negative assay, management is best tailored to clinical symptoms and laboratory examinations."
CD010502,0,1386840,0,Evidence for actinlike proteins in an M protein-negative strain of Streptococcus pyogenes.,"Antigens shared between Streptococcus pyogenes and heart tissue may play an important role in autoimmune cardiac injury associated with acute rheumatic fever. Antiheart/antistreptococcal antibodies found in the disease react with antigens of S. pyogenes, including M protein and a 60-kDa antigen distinct from M protein. Heart antigens recognized by these cross-reactive antistreptococcal antibodies include myosin and actin. To investigate the presence of a streptococcal actin, established protocols for the polymerization and isolation of eukaryotic actin were used to extract and concentrate actinlike proteins from M- streptococcal cells. The polymerized bacterial actin from the streptococcal extract was probed in immunoblots with an antiactin monoclonal antibody. Two proteins of about 60 kDa in the polymerized bacterial actin reacted with the antiactin antibody. Proteins in the polymerized bacterial actin extract of about 43 and 60 kDa behaved like eukaryotic actin by binding to myosin and DNase I affinity columns. Filaments were demonstrated by electron microscopy in the polymerized bacterial actinlike extract, which also enhanced the ATPase activity of eukaryotic myosin. The data suggest that proteins resembling actin are present in S. pyogenes."
CD010502,0,1850382,0,Salivary and serum IgA antibodies to the Epstein-Barr virus glycoprotein gp340: incidence and potential for virus neutralization.,"Human antibody responses to the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) glycoprotein gp340 have been measured using purified preparations of the native molecule as the substrate in ELISAs. This glycoprotein is the dominant component of the EBV envelope and a major target for the virus-neutralizing antibody response. Healthy virus carriers (both Caucasian and Chinese) regularly show detectable anti-gp340 IgG in serum and, unexpectedly, 21-30% of these individuals are also serum anti-gp340 IgA positive. Chinese patients with the EBV-genome-positive malignancy nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) show elevated serum IgA antibodies to gp340 but, given the background of responses amongst healthy virus carriers, anti-gp340 IgA titres are a poorer diagnostic indicator of NPC than serum IgA antibodies detectable by immunofluorescence against the multicomponent EBV early antigen (EA). Salivary IgA antibody responses to gp340 are potentially important as a means of neutralizing orally-transmitted virus. We detected salivary IgA (but not IgG) to gp340 in a minority (12-19%) of healthy virus carriers and in a higher proportion (49%) of NPC patients. Even saliva samples chosen for their relatively high anti-gp340 IgA titres showed only weak neutralizing activity against transforming EBV preparations whether from B95.8 cell culture supernatant or from the throat washing of an infectious mononucleosis patient. We conclude that in healthy virus carriers, salivary IgA responses to gp340 are unlikely to provide effective local immunity against re-infection with a second EBV strain."
CD010502,0,15664926,0,The M protein is dispensable for maturation of streptococcal cysteine protease SpeB.,"The streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin B (SpeB) is an important virulence factor of group A streptococci (GAS) with cysteine protease activity. Maturation of SpeB to a proteolytically active form was suggested to be dependent on cell-wall-anchored M1 protein, the major surface protein of GAS (M. Collin and A. Olsen, Mol. Microbiol. 36:1306-1318, 2000). Collin and Olsen showed that mutant GAS strains expressing truncated M protein secrete a conformationally different form of unprocessed SpeB with no proteolytic activity. Alternatively, we hypothesized that a truncated M protein may interfere with processing of this secreted protease, and therefore we tested cysteine protease activity in genetically defined mutant strains that express either no M protein or membrane-anchored M protein with an in-frame deletion of the AB repeat region. Measurements of SpeB activity by cleavage of a substrate n-benzoyl-Pro-Phe-Arg-p-nitroanilide hydrochloride showed that the proteolytic activities in culture supernatants of both mutants were similar to those from the wild-type strain. In addition, Western blot analysis of culture supernatants showed that SpeB expression and processing to a mature form was unaffected by either deletion mutation. Therefore, we conclude that M protein is not required for maturation of the streptococcal cysteine protease SpeB."

Molecular identification revealed the presence of Enterococcus faecium (nine isolates), Enterococcus faecalis (4), E. avium (3) and Enterococcus casseliflavus/flavescens (1). Alpha-haemolytic activity was detected in two E. avium and one E. faecalis isolates, and beta-haemolytic activity was detected in E. casseliflavus/flavescens. The haemolytic component cylB was detected by PCR amplification in three non-haemolytic isolates and in E. casseliflavus/flavescens. The collagen adhesin ace gene and the endocarditis associated antigen gene efaA(fm) were detected in two isolates each. Genes encoding sex pheromone precursors (cpd, cob, ccf) were detected in E. faecalis and E. casseliflavus/flavescens. Other presumed virulence genes (agg, gelE, cylM, cylA and efaA(fs)) were not detected. All isolates were resistant to rifampicin, erythromycin and ciprofloxacin, and some were also resistant to quinupristin/dalfopristin, tetracycline, levofloxacin, gentamicin and streptomycin. Vancomycin resistance was not detected. Tyrosine decarboxylation was detected in all E. faecium isolates. Given the high resistance of enterococci to environmental conditions, and their implication in opportunistic infections, the incidence of potential virulent enterococci in foods (especially those of a higher risk-like home-made foods) should be carefully studied."

This prospective, multicentre, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy clinical trial was undertaken in order to compare the efficacy of, tolerability of and compliance with a 5-day course of cefotiam hexetil (CTM) 200 mg bd with that of a 10-day course of penicillin V (PEV) 1 megaunit (600 mg) tds, to investigate the significance of recovering GABHS during or after treatment and to evaluate the potential economic advantages of short-term regimens. Two hundred and fifty ambulatory adult patients with a presumptive diagnosis (based on a positive rapid antigen detection test) of GABHS tonsillitis were recruited in 60 centres; the diagnosis was subsequently confirmed by a positive culture of a throat swab. At the time of entry into the trial there was no statistically significant difference between the groups in terms of clinical symptoms. In an intention-to-treat analysis, both the clinical and bacteriological response rates at days 10 and 30 were comparable for each group i.e. 106 of 119 (89.1%) patients and 90 of 109 (82.6%) patients respectively in the CTM group and 103 of 117 (88.0%) patients and 92 of 107 (86.0%) patients respectively in the PEV group. The times until defervescence and resolution of symptoms were also similar. Of the 115 patients in each group who were assessed at day 90, there were three clinical relapses in the CTM group and seven in the PEV group. No non-suppurative complications of GABHS infection were detected. Tolerance was significantly better in the CTM group than in the PEV group, 14 of 119 (11.8%) patients and 26 of 117 (22.2%) patients in the former and latter groups respectively reporting adverse events. In three cases in each group treatment was discontinued prematurely because of adverse events; none of these in the CTM group was serious but one patient in the PEV group experienced a severe allergic reaction. Compliance in both groups was good during the first 5 days of therapy but, by the end of each course, 93.6% of patients in the CTM group had completed treatment, compared with 73.0% in the PEV group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

Acute nephritic syndrome occurred 3 weeks after having pharyngeal pain and diarrhea. He presented with edema and hypertension on admission. Laboratory evaluation showed hemolytic anemia with fragmentation, thrombocytopenia, elevated lactic dehydrogenase level, low haptoglobin level, low complement C3 level, and elevated antistreptolysin-O titer. Serum creatinine level was 1.22 mg/dL (108 micromol/L), and urinalysis showed marked proteinuria, with protein of 8.7 g/d, and hematuria. The renal biopsy specimen was characteristic of APSGN, but not HUS. Moderate expansion of the mesangial matrix, moderate proliferation of epithelial and endothelial cells, and marked infiltration of neutrophils was seen by means of light microscopy, and many subepithelial humps were seen by means of electron microscopy. Neither fibrin deposition nor evidence of thrombotic microangiopathy was found. Complement C3 deposition along the capillary wall and tubules was seen in an immunofluorescence study. The patient was administered plasma infusion at 320 mL/d and antihypertensive drugs. Serum complement C3 and haptoglobin levels returned to normal within 3 weeks. This is a rare case of the simultaneous occurrence of APSGN, HUS, and nephrotic syndrome."

Choriamnionitis is a polymicrobial infection most often due to ascending genital microbes which, in over 65% of positive amniotic fluid cultures, involves two or more organisms. In this study, we determine the cytokines expression (IL-1β, TNFα) and prometalloproteinase activation (proMMP-2 and proMMP-9) after double o single infection an in vitro model of human fetal membranes. Fetal membranes at term were mounted in the Transwell culture system and after 24 h of infection, choriodecidual, and amnion media was collected. IL-1β and TNFα were evaluated by ELISA, whereas proMMP-9 and proMMP-2 were determined by substrate gel zymography. The choriodecidual and amnion compartments actively respond to the infectious process, which induced the secretion of IL-1β, TNFα, and proMMP-9 after either mixed or single infection. The proMMP-2 secretion profile was the same after all experimental conditions. There was no synergy between Streptococcus agalactiae and Escherichia coli for inducing the secretion of inflammatory factors or degradative metalloproteinase. In conclusion, these two bacteria could initiate different pathways to induce chorioamnioitis."

CD010502,0,11349078,0,Induction of autoimmune valvular heart disease by recombinant streptococcal m protein.,"Rheumatic heart disease is an autoimmune sequela of group A streptococcal infection. Previous studies have established that streptococcal M protein is structurally and immunologically similar to cardiac myosin, a well-known mediator of inflammatory heart disease. In this study, we investigated the hypothesis that streptococcal M protein could produce inflammatory valvular heart lesions similar to those seen in rheumatic fever (RF). Fifty percent (3 of 6) of Lewis rats immunized with recombinant type 6 streptococcal M protein (rM6) developed valvulitis as well as focal lesions of myocarditis. Valvular lesions initiated at the valve surface endothelium spread into the valve. Anitschkow cells and verruca-like lesions were present. T cells from rM6-immunized rats proliferated in the presence of purified cardiac myosin, but not skeletal myosin. A T-cell line produced from rM6-treated rats proliferated in the presence of cardiac myosin and rM6 protein. The study demonstrates that the Lewis rat is a model of valvular heart disease and that streptococcal M protein can induce an autoimmune cell-mediated immune attack on the heart valve in an animal model. The data support the hypothesis that a bacterial antigen can break immune tolerance in vivo, an important concept in autoimmunity."

A 22-kD fragment of M type 5 protein is a potent stimulant of human T cells and has recently been shown by our laboratory to belong to the newly designated family of superantigens. Using flow cytometry and the polymerase chain reaction, we demonstrate that this molecule reacts with subsets of human T cells expressing specific T cell receptor (TCR) V beta elements, namely V beta 2, 4, and 8. We employed similar techniques to analyze the TCR V alpha usage of pep M5-stimulated T cells. These studies revealed that the preferential usage of particular V alpha elements is not specific for the superantigen; rather, it may reflect the repertoire of the individual being tested. The expansion of a large number of T cells bearing specific TCR V beta sequences by M protein may account for its role in mediating the pathogenesis of post-streptococcal diseases. Furthermore, the preferential usage of TCR V alpha elements in certain individuals may be an important factor that predisposes them to development of self-reactivity."
CD010502,0,14688117,0,Plasminogen binding by group A streptococcal isolates from a region of hyperendemicity for streptococcal skin infection and a high incidence of invasive infection.,"Reports of resurgence in invasive group A streptococcal (GAS) infections come mainly from affluent populations with infrequent exposure to GAS. In the Northern Territory (NT) of Australia, high incidence of invasive GAS disease is secondary to endemic skin infection, serotype M1 clones are rare in invasive infection, the diversity and level of exposure to GAS strains are high, and no particular strains dominate. Expression of a plasminogen-binding GAS M-like protein (PAM) has been associated with skin infection in isolates elsewhere (D. Bessen, C. M. Sotir, T. M. Readdy, and S. K. Hollingshead, J. Infect. Dis. 173:896-900, 1996), and subversion of the host plasminogen system by GAS is thought to contribute to invasion in animal models. Here, we describe the relationship between plasminogen-binding capacity of GAS isolates, PAM genotype, and invasive capacity in 29 GAS isolates belonging to 25 distinct strains from the NT. In the presence of fibrinogen and streptokinase, invasive isolates bound more plasminogen than isolates from uncomplicated infections (P < or = 0.004). Only PAM-positive isolates bound substantial levels of plasminogen by a fibrinogen-streptokinase-independent pathway (direct binding). Despite considerable amino acid sequence variation within the A1 repeat region of PAM where the plasminogen-binding domain maps, the critical lysine residue was conserved."
CD010502,0,10885988,0,Pathogenesis of group A streptococcal infections.,"Group A streptococci are model extracellular gram-positive pathogens responsible for pharyngitis, impetigo, rheumatic fever, and acute glomerulonephritis. A resurgence of invasive streptococcal diseases and rheumatic fever has appeared in outbreaks over the past 10 years, with a predominant M1 serotype as well as others identified with the outbreaks. emm (M protein) gene sequencing has changed serotyping, and new virulence genes and new virulence regulatory networks have been defined. The emm gene superfamily has expanded to include antiphagocytic molecules and immunoglobulin-binding proteins with common structural features. At least nine superantigens have been characterized, all of which may contribute to toxic streptococcal syndrome. An emerging theme is the dichotomy between skin and throat strains in their epidemiology and genetic makeup. Eleven adhesins have been reported, and surface plasmin-binding proteins have been defined. The strong resistance of the group A streptococcus to phagocytosis is related to factor H and fibrinogen binding by M protein and to disarming complement component C5a by the C5a peptidase. Molecular mimicry appears to play a role in autoimmune mechanisms involved in rheumatic fever, while nephritis strain-associated proteins may lead to immune-mediated acute glomerulonephritis. Vaccine strategies have focused on recombinant M protein and C5a peptidase vaccines, and mucosal vaccine delivery systems are under investigation."

This study evaluates the Abbott CT/NG Real-Time assay and a real-time porA pseudogene assay. Samples (n = 600) from a mixed prevalence Irish population include 164 male urines with corresponding urethral swabs, 58 endocervical swabs, 173 male pharyngeal swabs, 205 male rectal swabs, 36 NG clinical isolates and 26 commensal Neisseria species isolates. There was a 100% concordance between the Abbott CT/NG Real-Time and the porA assay. The positivity rate was 1.2%, 1.7%, 8.1% and 5.8% for FVU/urethral swabs, endocervical, pharyngeal and rectal swabs, respectively. These results were compared to culture and discrepancies were found with nine pharyngeal and three rectal swabs. Seven of the 12 discrepant positive samples were sequenced and were confirmed ""true positives"". The sensitivity and specificity of the molecular assays was 100%. The sensitivity of the culture-based testing was 100% for urogenital samples but 36% and 75% for pharyngeal and rectal swabs, respectively. The combined Abbott CT/NG and porA assays provide a valuable alternative to culture and also generate a significant increase in the diagnosis of pharyngeal and rectal NG infection."

The Oxoid Dryspot kit (Oxoid Ltd., Basingstoke, Hampshire, United Kingdom) uses predispensed latex dried onto reaction cards or cardboard strips. All streptococci of groups A (85 strains), B (87 strains), C (30 strains), D (38 strains), F (23 strains), and G (65 strains) were correctly grouped by using these reagents. The Oxoid Dryspot Streptococcal Grouping kit is a reliable method for grouping of the beta-hemolytic streptococci encountered in clinical laboratories."

Studies involved 94 simulated and 60 clinical isolates of 83 streptococci. The Streptex and Strepslide kits had excellent sensitivity and specificity for group A, B, F, and G organisms, and the Phadebact kit had excellent sensitivity and specificity for groups B and G. Group C reactions usually occurred with all of the streptococcus kits with pneumococci and occasionally with alpha-hemolytic streptococci. Although these kits were unacceptable for group C and D organisms, enterococci which were common clinical isolates could be directly identified in blood cultures by a supplementary rapid L-pyrrolidonyl-beta-naphthylamide biochemical test. Direct application of the Phadebact pneumococcus kit to blood cultures was also assessed with 29 isolates of 20 organisms. The specificity was good, but the sensitivity was only 65.5%."
CD010502,0,2514570,0,Possible role of Streptococcus pyogenes in mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome. VIII. Immunological tolerance to S. pyogenes-associated antigens seems essential to induction of MCLS.,"In our previous studies, we attempted to show that new-born mice infected with an attenuated strain of Streptococcus pyogenes, and exposed to streptococcal antigens approximately one month later, failed to develop a humoral response to those antigens but were able to respond normally to other unrelated antigens. Since such immunological characteristics are identical to those of patients with the mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome (MCLS), the present studies were performed with the aim of assessing the antibody-forming activities of peripheral blood lymphocytes collected from MCLS patients. These lymphocytes were cultured in the presence of pokeweed mitogen, streptolysin-O and streptococcal C-polysaccharide, leading to their refractoriness to S. pyogenes-associated antigens coupled with normal responsiveness to unrelated antigens. The implication of such immunological responsiveness elicited from neonatal exposure to streptococcal antigens is discussed, particularly with reference to the induction of MCLS."
CD010502,0,3546364,1,Comparison of TestPack Strep A test kit with culture technique for detection of group A streptococci.,"Results obtained with Abbott Laboratories TestPack Strep A (TPSA), a 7-min enzyme immunoassay method, were compared with culture results to measure the ability of this assay to detect group A streptococci directly from 365 throat swabs. Our study demonstrated a sensitivity of 90.0% and a specificity of 97.4% for TPSA compared with cultures incubated for 48 h. The positive and negative predictive values of this assay versus the culture method were 92.8 and 96.3%, respectively. If specimens that provided fewer than 10 colonies per plate of group A streptococci are eliminated from the data, the sensitivity is increased to 95.6%. Additionally, 10 group A and 40 non-group A streptococcal isolates were tested directly with TPSA for the ability to distinguish group A from non-group A streptococci. All 50 isolates were correctly identified (100% accuracy). TPSA is a rapid, accurate, and easy-to-interpret method for detection and confirmation of group A streptococcal antigen directly from throat swabs and pure culture isolates."

CD010502,0,12405580,0,Primary bacterial pericarditis.,"Purulent pericarditis is rarely the primary site of bacterial infection. It is usually a complication of an infection originating elsewhere in the body, arising by contiguous spread or haematogenous dissemination.This paper, however, describes a previously healthy young man, who developed a purulent streptococcal pericarditis with no localizable primary focus. Although many possibilities were investigated, the entry site of the pericarditis remains unknown. The incidence of purulent pericarditis has decreased considerably since the antibiotic era. It is typically an acute and potentially lethal disease, necessitating rapid diagnosis and adequate therapy to improve prognosis. Standard treatment combines appropriate antibiotic therapy with surgical drainage. However, the exact timing and type of surgery is still under discussion. Our patient was treated with antibiotics, subxiphoidal tube drainage of the pericardial fluid and intrapericardial thrombolysis. After three weeks, he developed tamponade, requiring partial pericardiectomy. He recovered completely and resumed his normal activities after a two-month hospitalisation."
CD010502,0,2679905,0,[Monoclonal antibodies cross-reacting with fibroblasts of interstitial connective tissue of the myocardium and cell wall protein antigens of group A Streptococcus].,"Monoclonal antibodies (MCA) B6/5 and C5/3 were obtained after immunization of BALB/c mice with the protein non-type-specific antigens (NTSA) of streptococcal group A cell wall. MCA B6/5 in the indirect immunofluorescence react with human and animal interstitial connective tissue (ICT) of the myocardium and human fibroblast culture cells. MCA C5/3 react with the bands of muscle fibers of the myocardium. MCA B6/5 and C5/3 are autoantibodies. It was revealed that these MCA are directed to two streptococcal cross-reacting antigens (CRA). Production of B6/5 and C5/3, apparently, does not depend on the possibility of some streptococcal antigens to bind fibrinogen. Bound immunoglobulins were not revealed in the ICT and in the muscle fibres by the cultivation of the C5/3 monoclone. Firstly it was stated that, MCA B6/5, reacting with fibroblasts and with streptococcal CRA, are capable to fix in the ICT of myocardium, what is typical for the phenomenon described in rheumatic fever."

CD010502,0,3525671,1,Evaluation of a two-minute strep A direct swab test (SADST) on patients with pharyngitis at a primary care clinic.,"A two-minute strep A direct swab test (SADST) was used to detect the presence of Lancefield group A streptococci (GAS) from the throats of 207 patients with pharyngitis at a primary-care clinic. The results were compared with a standard culture method. Fifty-one specimens were positive and 156 specimens were negative for GAS by culture. The SADST had a sensitivity of 96% (49 of 51) and specificity of 98.7% (154 of 156). The predictive values of a positive and negative SADST, for GAS, were 96% and 98.7% respectively. The SADST showed negative reactions with five specimens containing beta-haemolytic streptococci other than GAS and 34 known stock cultures other than GAS. Our results indicate that SADST is a rapid, simple, convenient and reliable test to use for diagnosis of GAS pharyngitis at primary care clinics, physicians' offices and clinical laboratories."

CD010502,0,11598074,0,A 60-kilodalton immunodominant glycoprotein is essential for cell wall integrity and the maintenance of cell shape in Streptococcus mutans.,"We have demonstrated previously by Western blotting that in naturally sensitized humans, the serum or salivary antibody response to Streptococcus mutans was directed predominantly to a protein antigen with a size of approximately 60-kDa. To identify this immunodominant antigen, specific serum antibodies were eluted from immunoblots and five positive clones with inserts ranging in length from 3 to 8 kb from identical chromosomal loci were obtained by screening a genomic expression library of Streptococcus mutans GS-5. Amino acid sequencing established the identity of this immunodominant antigen, a 60-kDa immunodominant glycoprotein (IDG-60), to be a cell wall-associated general stress protein GSP-781, which was originally predicted to have a molecular mass of approximately 45 kDa based on the derived nucleotide sequence. Discrepancy in the molecular mass was also observed in recombinant his-tagged IDG-60 (rIDG-60) expressed from Escherichia coli. Glycosylation, consisting of sialic acid, mannose galactose, and N-acetylgalactosamine, was detected by lectin binding to IDG-60 in cell wall extracts from S. mutans and rIDG-60 expressed in vivo or translated in vitro. Despite the presence of multiple Asn or Ser or Thr glycosylation sites, IDG-60 was resistant to the effect of N-glycosidase F and multiple O-glycosidase molecules but not to beta-galactosidase. Insertional inactivation of the gene encoding IDG-60, sagA, resulted in a retarded growth rate, destabilization of the cell wall, and pleiomorphic cell shape with multifold ingrowth of cell wall. In addition, distinct from the parental GS-5 strain, the isogenic mutant GS-51 was unable to survive the challenge of low pH and high osmotic pressure or high temperature. Expression of the wild-type gene in trans within GS-51 from plasmid pDL277 complemented the growth defect and restored normal cell shape. These results suggested that IDG-60 is essential for maintaining the integrity of the cell wall and the uniformity of cell shape, both of which are indispensable for bacteria survival under stress conditions."
CD010502,0,1789905,0,Scarlet fever and types of erythrogenic toxins produced by the infecting streptococcal strains.,"Group A streptococcal strains were isolated from the throats of 46 children suffering from scarlet fever. For detection of erythrogenic toxins (ETs), the culture supernatants were concentrated 100 times by ethanol precipitation and solubilisation in acetate buffer. ELISA was used to identify ETA and double immunodiffusion to identify ETB and ETC. The presence of the ETA gene was detected by a specific DNA probe. ETA (alone or in combination with ETB and/or ETC) was found in 51.9% of the strains, ETB (alone or in combination with ETA and/or ETC) in 76.9% and ETC (in combination with ETA and ETB) in 28.9%. Only 5.8% of strains did not produce any detectable ET. In SDS-PAGE, supernatants of ETB-producing strains showed a pronounced band in either the region of the proteinase zymogen or the active proteinase. There was no correlation between the type of erythrogenic toxin and the serological M or T type of the producing strain. The mitogenic potency of culture supernatants did not differ significantly irrespective of the toxin type(s) present. Culture supernatants of strains without a detectable amount of the known ETs were highly mitogenic, indicating the production of other streptococcal mitogens. A correlation with clinical symptoms was determined with regard to exanthema and fever. Strains producing two or three toxins caused a more intense exanthema. Patient temperature was higher (greater than or equal to 38 degrees C) when the infecting strain produced ETB. The toxin-producing patterns of the strains of this study were compared with those isolated during the last epidemic outbreak of scarlet fever in East Germany."

Hybrid phage expressing M5 antigen (lambda M5) were detected in the gene bank at an unexpectedly high frequency. The cloned streptococcal DNA sequences from one lambda M5 phage were subcloned into an E. coli plasmid vector. The M5 gene (smp5) was mapped, and its transcriptional orientation was determined by isolating and characterizing deletion and transposon insertion mutants of the M5+ hybrid plasmid pMK207. This analysis indicated that the intact smp5 gene had been cloned. Anti-pep M5 sera reacted with five pMK207-encoded polypeptides having relative molecular sizes of 64,000, 56,000, 55,500, 52,500, and 50,000. All of these polypeptides were encoded by the same DNA sequences, and all reacted with antisera raised to a synthetic peptide corresponding to the amino-terminal end of pep M5, suggesting that proteolytic cleavage at the carboxy-terminal end of the smp5 gene product generates at least some of the lower relative molecular size forms. Southern blotting experiments with smp5 gene sequences as probes identified multiple copies of DNA sequences sharing homology with the smp5 gene in the type 5 group A streptococcal genome."

CD010502,0,11598078,0,Generation and surface localization of intact M protein in Streptococcus pyogenes are dependent on sagA.,"The M protein is an important surface-located virulence factor of Streptococcus pyogenes, the group A streptococcus (GAS). Expression of M protein is primarily controlled by Mga, a transcriptional activator protein. A recent report suggested that the sag locus, which includes nine genes necessary and sufficient for production of streptolysin S, another GAS virulence factor, is also needed for transcription of emm, encoding the M protein (Z. Li, D. D. Sledjeski, B. Kreikemeyer, A. Podbielski, and M. D. Boyle, J. Bacteriol. 181:6019-6027, 1999). To investigate this in more detail, we constructed an insertion-deletion mutation in sagA, the first gene in the sag locus, in the M6 strain JRS4. The resulting strain, JRS470, produced no detectable streptolysin S and showed a drastic reduction in cell surface-associated M protein, as measured by cell aggregation and Western blot analysis. However, transcription of the emm gene was unaffected by the sagA mutation. Detailed analysis with monoclonal antibodies and an antipeptide antibody showed that the M protein in the sagA mutant strain was truncated so that it lacks the C-repeat region and the C-terminal domain required for anchoring it to the cell surface. This truncated M protein was largely found, as expected, in the culture supernatant. Lack of surface-located M protein made the sagA mutant strain susceptible to phagocytosis. Thus, although sagA does not affect transcription of the M6 protein gene, it is needed for the surface localization of this important virulence factor."
CD010502,0,2030154,0,"Use of rapid carbohydrate utilisation test for identifying ""Streptococcus milleri group"".","A short series of biochemical and serological tests were developed for the rapid presumptive identification of ""Streptococcus milleri group"" isolates. One hundred and seventy seven streptococcal isolates were recovered from the mouths of 10 out of 12 healthy adult volunteers by use of a simple sampling procedure and a single selective medium. In all, 127 oral ""S milleri group"" isolates were identified by biochemical and serological tests, confirming the indigenous nature of these streptococci in the mouth. Most (70.1%) of ""S milleri group"" isolates were non-haemolytic, 26% were alpha-haemolytic, and 3.9% beta-haemolytic. Fifty four (42.5%) were serologically typable, of which 46 were Lancefield group F, suggesting that the mouth is an important source of Lancefield group F streptococci. A collection of group F streptococci from a range of sources was indistinguishable from a collection of oral ""S milleri group"" isolates on the basis of the tests used, supporting the general synonymity of group F streptococcus with the broader ""S milleri group"". The battery of tests was cheap and simple to perform, and was capable of identifying ""S milleri group"" isolates from a range of sources, including variants with wide sugar fermentation patterns."

Pharyngitis due to group A beta-hemolytic streptococci represents the major diagnostic concern in these patients. Organisms other than group A streptococci can cause pharyngitis, but their clinical importance and their diagnostic tests have not yet been established. For many years, physicians have used routine throat cultures to diagnose group A streptococcal pharyngitis. Rapid tests have recently been introduced that detect the group A streptococcal antigen on throat swab specimens. Because both tests have high sensitivity and specificity, the choice of tests may depend on test turnaround time. Rapid tests should improve management by decreasing both short-term morbidity and inappropriate use of antibiotics."

Novel C. psittaci-specific primers targeting the ompA gene were developed. The IC DNA contained the same primer-binding sites and had the same length and nucleotide content as the C. psittaci DNA amplicon, but had a shuffled probe-binding region. The lower limit of detection was 80 target copies/PCR, corresponding to 6,250 copies/mL in a clinical sample. Specificity was tested using reference strains of 30 bacterial species. No amplification was observed from any of these samples. Respiratory samples from eight patients were positive with this PCR. Six of these patients were confirmed as positive for C. psittaci with serological testing. Two patients had increasing antibody titres, but did not fulfil criteria proposed previously for serologically proven Chlamydia spp. infection. The real-time PCR described in this paper is a sensitive, specific and rapid method to detect C. psittaci DNA in human clinical respiratory samples."

CD010502,0,8675326,0,DNA sequencing and gene expression of the emm gene cluster in an M50 group A streptococcus strain virulent for mice.,"The strain B514, an M serotype 50 strain, is capable of causing a natural upper respiratory infection leading to death in mice, as reported by Hook et al. in 1960 (E. W. Hook, R. R. Wagner, and R. C. Lancefield, Am. J. Hyg. 72:111-119, 1960). Thus, this strain was of interest for use in developing an animal model for group A streptococcal colonization and disease. The emm gene cluster for this strain was examined by PCR mapping and found to contain three emm family genes and cluster pattern 5. PCR-generated fragments corresponding to the SF4 (mrp50), SF2 (emmL50), and SF3 (enn50) genes were cloned and the entire gene cluster was sequenced. The gene cluster has greater than 97% DNA identity to previously sequenced regions of the gene cluster of the M2 strain T2/44/RB4 if two small divergent regions that encode the mature amino terminus of the SF-2 and SF-3 gene products are not included. If expressed, the genes encode proteins which bind human immunoglobulin G (Mrp50 and EmmL50) or immunoglobulin A (Enn50). However, in isolates taken directly after passage in mice, the surface proteins arising from these genes were barely detectable. The transcription of each gene in the B514 strain was investigated by Northern (RNA) hybridization, and mRNA transcripts were detected and quantitated relative to those of the recA gene, a housekeeping gene. Transcription of all three emm family genes was found to be over 30-fold attenuated relative to transcription of the same genes in strain T2/44/RB4. This suggests that the positive regulator, Mga, either is not expressed in this strain or has a different requirement for activation; it also suggests that the capsule may be sufficient to inhibit phagocytosis under these circumstances."

CD010502,0,6822729,0,The serotyping of hospital strains of streptococci belonging to Lancefield group C and group G.,"A collection of more than 300 strains belonging to either Lancefield group C or group G was made. The cultures had been isolated either sporadically from patients with serious disease or as apparent clusters from various nosocomial outbreaks. T-protein antigens were sought. So far, nine distinct serotypes have been found among the group G streptococci and seven serotypes amongst the Streptococcus equisimilis (group C) strains. Of the sixteen serotypes, four were the original T-types 7, 16, 20 and 21 described by Griffith (1934). Because of the similarities of representatives of the two groups to Lancefield group A streptococci (Griffith, 1934; Maxted & Potter, 1967) a few strains not unexpectedly carried T antigens usually seen in group A streptococci. Using this scheme it has been possible to serotype 76% of S. equisimilis strains of human origin and 82% of group G streptococci from human clinical material. A small collection of group C and group G streptococci of animal origin could not be serotyped with the experimental T-antisera."

Nucleotide sequencing of the mga regulon of this strain showed the existence of two emm-like genes. The emm gene located upstream of the scpA gene comprises 1305 nucleotides encoding the putative precursor M protein of 435 amino acids in length with an M(r) of 49 kDa. or a predicted mature protein of 394 amino acids with an M(r) of 44.8 kDa. Another gene mrpST4547 was located upstream of the emm gene and downstream of the mga gene.

The sequences flanking the hyper-variable and C repeats of the emmST4547 gene showed high similarity to corresponding regions in the mga regulon of OF positive strains notably M15, M4, M22 and M50. In contrast, the sequence within the hyper-variable and C repeat regions of the emmST4547 gene revealed high similarity to equivalent regions in the OF negative strains.

CD010502,0,9509915,0,Streptococcal infection in the pathogenesis of Behçet's disease and clinical effects of minocycline on the disease symptoms.,"Although the precise pathoetiology of Behçet's disease (BD) remains obscure, patients with BD have a high incidence of chronic infectious foci, indicating an enhanced susceptibility to chronic tonsillitis, and dental caries. Sometimes, clinical symptoms appear after treatment of these foci in BD patients. It is believed that BD might be related to an allergic reaction to a bacterial infection in view of the many clinical symptoms, especially the presence of aphthous and genital ulcerations. An attempt to obtain cutaneous responses to bacterial antigens has been carried out using various vaccines developed from bacteria isolated from the ulcerative lesions and oral cavities of BD patients. BD patients often show intense hypersensitivity to various strains of streptococci, not only by their cutaneous reactions but also by in vitro testing. In this report, we describe our previous studies on the correlation between streptococcal antigens and the pathogenesis of BD and also discuss the recent reports of other authors. The intense hypersensitivity to streptococcal antigens acquired after streptococcal infection is thought to play an important role in the appearance of symptoms in BD patients since the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) was enhanced when stimulated with streptococcal antigen in a culture system. Minocycline, an antibiotic to which certain strains of streptococci are sensitive, reduced the frequency of clinical symptoms in BD patients as well as the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by BD-PBMC stimulated with streptococcal antigen."
CD010502,0,21648230,0,Preventing neonatal group B streptococcal infection. Intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis in some high-risk situations.,"Group B streptococci (GBS) are the leading cause of life-threatening neonatal bacterial infections in developed countries. The newborn is initially colonised during passage through the birth canal. Maternal vaginal carriage is usually asymptomatic. How safe and effective are strategies aimed at preventing severe neonatal GBS infection? To answer these questions, we conducted a review of the literature using the standard Prescrire methodology. In France, Group B streptococci are present in the vagina of about 10-15% of women towards the end of pregnancy. Mother-to-child transmission can occur when the membranes rupture, or during delivery. About one-third of infants born to mothers who carry Group B streptococci are colonised at birth. GBS colonisation rarely affects the newborn's health but, during the first 7 days of life, about 3% of colonised children develop a serious early-onset infection, particularly meningitis, which may be fatal or leave sequelae. Late-onset infections (after 7 days of life) do not appear to be linked to intrapartum colonisation. The risk of early neonatal GBS infection increases in cases of preterm delivery, maternal fever during delivery, and membrane rupture more than 18 hours before delivery. These situations account for 50% to 75% of early neonatal GBS infections. Several randomised trials suggest that intravenous antibiotic prophylaxis in women who carry Group B streptococci, from the onset of labour until delivery, reduces the risk of early-onset neonatal GBS infection from 4.7% to 0.4% (p = 0.02). Other antibiotic strategies are less well assessed or appear to be less effective. Penicillin G (benzylpenicillin) is the antibiotic of choice, while penicillin A (ampicillin or amoxicillin) is an alternative. In case of penicillin allergy, erythromycin or clindamycin are generally active against Group B streptococci and carry no particular risks for the infant. The greatest risk associated with penicillin, especially injectable forms, is an anaphylactic reaction, which can have severe consequences for both mother and child. The estimated frequency is about 5 cases per 10 000 treatments. The possible long-term adverse effects of antibiotic exposure during delivery are poorly documented in children. We found no randomised trials of standard vaginal screening for Group B streptococci between 35 and 38 weeks of gestation, or of a rapid PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test at the time of delivery. In a retrospective study conducted in the US, screening followed by antibiotic therapy if the results were positive was associated with a lower risk of early neonatal infection, but the methodology does not allow firm conclusions to be drawn. The risk-benefit balance has not been determined in terms of neonatal mortality. Widespread implementation of screening guidelines coincided with a decline in the incidence of early neonatal GBS infections in several countries. In the United Kingdom, systematic antibiotic therapy is recommended in high-risk situations, without systematic screening for Group B streptococci. In practice, the first priority is to identify situations in which there is a high risk of neonatal GBS infection, and to administer antibiotics during labour, after screening for GBS carriage, if possible. Outside of these situations, the risk of an anaphylactic reaction must be minimised by choosing the prophylactic antibiotic based on maternal allergy history, and by avoiding antibiotic prophylaxis altogether if the mother has a history of anaphylaxis, whatever the cause."

The results were as follows: 1) The strain ""Matsuyama 2166"" is OF (Opacity Factor) (+) and its serological components consist of M ""Matsuyama 2166"" antigen, which is unique in our collection of M-types, and T28 antigen as a major antigen along with T12 as a minor. 2) Out of the group A streptococci typed as MNT, 96.6% of the streptococci were types as T12-28 and 96.5% of T28 by conventional typing sera were strains to be typed as M ""Matsuyama 2166"" using the newly prepared M ""Matsuyama 2166"" typing serum, suggesting the great advantage to M-typing rate of T28 strains. 3) Group A streptococcus M ""Matsuyama 2166"" was also found in isolates from Thailand or Malaysia. It is interesting that T-types found in those isolates seems to be a little different from the T-types isolated in Japan. These results showed that there was the difficult problem when we did the speculation of M-type from the result of T-type."
CD010502,0,2472803,0,[Behavior of leukocyte elastase in chronic inflammatory tonsillar diseases].,"Inflammatory diseases may lead to local tissue injury due to an imbalance between leukocyte elastase and protease inhibitors (alpha-1-antitrypsin, alpha-2-macroglobulin). Hence, we determined the plasma level of elastase in patients with chronic tonsillitis using an enzyme-linked immunoassay and compared the results with those obtained from controls. There was a significant elevation of leukocyte elastase in patients with chronic inflammation of the tonsils compared with our controls. The sensitivity and specificity of the elastase assay characterise this method as a reliable one. Hence, the determination of leukocyte elastase in peripheral blood can be useful if the indication for tonsillectomy is in question."
CD010502,0,1452687,0,Functional and serological analysis of type II immunoglobulin G-binding proteins expressed by pathogenic group A streptococci.,"Bacterial immunoglobulin-binding proteins expressed on the surface of group A streptococci represent a heterogeneous family of functionally related proteins. In this report, we describe efficient methods for extracting immunoglobulin-binding proteins and classifying them functionally and antigenically. A common characteristic of immunoglobulin-binding proteins expressed by group A streptococci appears to be the absence of internal methionine residues in the binding protein. This has enabled development of a rapid, efficient, cyanogen bromide-based extraction procedure for solubilizing these molecules from intact bacteria. Studies carried out with a series of monospecific polyclonal antibodies prepared in chickens have identified two major antigenic classes of immunoglobulin-binding proteins. The methods described in this report facilitate a rapid functional and serological screening of immunoglobulin-binding proteins that should now enable detailed epidemiological studies of the importance of these molecules in group A streptococcal infections and their relationship to other surface proteins, in particular, the antiphagocytic M protein."

Symptoms include perianal rash, itching and rectal pain; blood-streaked stools may also be seen in one third of patients. It primarily occurs in children between six months and 10 years of age and is often misdiagnosed and treated inappropriately. A rapid streptococcal test of suspicious areas can confirm the diagnosis. Routine skin culture is an alternative diagnostic aid. Treatment with amoxicillin or penicillin is effective. Follow-up is necessary, because recurrences are common."
CD010502,0,8811073,0,Epitope mapping of homologous and cross-reactive antigens by monoclonal antibodies to streptococcal cell membrane (mAb to SCM).,"An approach to epitope mapping of a series of anti-streptococcal cell membrane (SCM) mAbs is described. Evaluations by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) of one control mAb HB-35 and 13 different anti-SCM mAbs were made on homologous SCM antigen and human basement membrane antigens isolated from glomeruli (GBM) and lung (LBM). These anti-SCM mAbs were previously shown to be cross-reactive in a variety of systems with both GBM and LBM. The binding capacities were measured for all 14 mAbs on ELISA plates sensitized with SCM antigen or the cross-reactive GBM or LBM antigens, at 5 micrograms/ml or approximately 20 pM/well. From the 50% binding capacity dilution the pM of mAb bound/pM antigen-well was calculated which translated into an estimate of the ratio-number of epitopes bound. Observations with the homologous and cross-reactive antigens showed multiple reactive epitope ratios to eight mAbs whereas the other five yielded a ratio value of one or two on the tested antigens. Plates blocked with a specific dilution of one mAb evaluated the binding by a second mAb providing both binding and specificity data. One mAb (I-F-3) blocked all the other anti-SCM mAbs on all three antigen plates. An additive effect was noted by three mAbs, I-G-8, II-C-4 and II-D-8 with most of the other mAbs. The order of placement, however, made distinctive differences; II-F-4 showed an additive or enhancement effect on I-B-5 but no reciprocal effect was seen. A similar effect was made with I-G-8 and II-C-4 or I-F-7. Possible interpretations are that each mAb is binding different epitopes each fully exposed, and the order of placement of the mAbs makes no difference. Where an enhanced effect was observed it is suggested that the binding of the first mAb changed the conformation of the antigen, thereby opening and exposing additional epitope(s) to the second antibody. Or, in contrast, where the second mAb was blocked by the first, a fixing of the protein conformation is suggested thereby occluding the other epitope, as seen with I-F-3 and II-C-4. These epitope mapping procedures confirmed that all 13 anti-SCM mAbs were binding at different epitopes. The nature of basement membrane collagens and how this relates to post-streptococcal sequelae will be discussed."

CD010502,0,10221878,0,Rapid molecular genetic subtyping of serotype M1 group A Streptococcus strains.,"Serotype M1 group A Streptococcus, the most common cause of invasive disease in many case series, generally have resisted extensive molecular subtyping by standard techniques (e.g., multilocus enzyme electrophoresis, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis). We used automated sequencing of the sic gene encoding streptococcal inhibitor of complement and of a region of the chromosome with direct repeat sequences to unambiguously differentiate 30 M1 isolates recovered from 28 patients in Texas with invasive disease episodes temporally clustered and thought to represent an outbreak. Sequencing of the emm gene was less useful for M1 strain differentiation, and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis with IS1548 or IS1562 as Southern hybridization probes did not provide epidemiologically useful subtyping information. Sequence polymorphism in the direct repeat region of the chromosome and IS1548 profiling data support the hypothesis that M1 organisms have two main evolutionary lineages marked by the presence or absence of the speA2 allele encoding streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin A2."
CD010502,0,10221877,0,emm typing and validation of provisional M types for group A streptococci.,This report discusses the following issues related to typing of group A streptococci (GAS): The development and use of the 5' emm variable region sequencing (emm typing) in relation to the existing serologic typing system; the designation of emm types in relation to M types; a system for validation of new emm types; criteria for validation of provisional M types to new M-types; a list of reference type cultures for each of the M-type or emm-type strains of GAS; the results of the first culture exchange program for a quality control testing system among the national and World Health Organization collaborating centers for streptococci; and dissemination of new approaches to typing of GAS to the international streptococcal community.
CD010502,0,6233529,0,Antibody to Pseudomonas aeruginosa mucoid exopolysaccharide and to sodium alginate in cystic fibrosis serum.,Antibodies in cystic fibrosis (CF) sera to Pseudomonas aeruginosa mucoid exopolysaccharide and to sodium alginate (a polysaccharide from seaweed chemically similar to mucoid exopolysaccharide) were measured in sera of CF patients to determine if the exopolysaccharide is immunogenic. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to test sera from 26 CF patients (18 colonized with pseudomonas and eight non-colonized) and 26 healthy controls. CF patients colonized with pseudomonas had more antibody to mucoid exopolysaccharide (P = 0.0008) and to sodium alginate (P = 0.0008) than did non-colonized CF patients. Virtually none was found in healthy controls. Duration of colonization was correlated with the level of antibody to sodium alginate (P = 0.003) but not with antibody to mucoid exopolysaccharide. Mucoid exopolysaccharide is immunogenic in patients with CF.
CD010502,0,2449305,0,Antibodies to basement membrane proteins nidogen and laminin in sera from streptococcal-related diseases and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis patients.,"Using the ELISA technique, antibodies against two different basement proteins, laminin and nidogen (ALNA), were determined in 226 children suffering from one of 37 different inflammatory or infectious diseases. These included 80 patients with streptococcal infection and 40 with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. Forty-eight percent of the streptococcus-infected patients (or 75% of those in the acute phase) and 60% of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis patients had significantly elevated ALNA levels compared with healthy controls. Interestingly 10 adult rheumatoid arthritis patients displayed normal ALNA levels, suggesting a particular immune process occurring in children affected by juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. By means of periodate oxidation and glycosidase treatments we have shown that ALNA positive sera recognized terminal alpha-galactose as the reactive epitope."
CD010502,0,3531385,0,Polyspecificity of antistreptococcal murine monoclonal antibodies and their implications in autoimmunity.,"mAbs produced by immunization of BALB/c mice with Streptococcus pyogenes M type 5 membranes were further characterized for their reaction with S. pyogenes pep M5 protein and with autoantigens associated with human cell lines. mAbs 36.2.2 and 54.2.8 simultaneously reacted with M protein and a membrane protein(s) of S. pyogenes. When cell lines were mixed with 54.2.8, we saw nuclear fluorescence along with staining of the cytoskeleton. Subsequent experiments revealed that 54.2.8 was an anti-DNA antibody that reacted with DNA, poly(I), poly(dT), and weakly with cardiolipin. Its reactivity with the cytoskeleton could be blocked with anti-vimentin. On the other hand, 36.2.2 reacted with the cytoskeleton, sparing the nucleus, and was inhibited by the alpha helical proteins myosin, actin, and keratin. mAb 54.2.8 was inhibited with myosin, but not with actin and keratin. None of the antibodies studied were inhibited by collagen, and none of them were rheumatoid factors. The results imply that Group A streptococci can activate B cell clones against myosin, alpha helical proteins, or DNA, thereby contributing to the enhancement of autoantibody production."

The availability of the test result while the patient is in the office can be a great improvement compared with waiting 1 to 2 days for a throat culture report. In addition, these rapid tests may be easier for office staff to read than traditional agar plates. A physician who incorporates rapid testing for streptococcal infection in the office laboratory should perform appropriate quality controls to be confident that the test method is working. The rapid streptococcal tests are the first of a new generation of microbiology immunoassays available to office laboratories."

Specific antiserum to type A streptococcal exotoxin reacted more strongly with staphylococcal enterotoxin B than with enterotoxin C1. The reactivity of type A streptococcal exotoxin with antiserum to staphylococcal enterotoxin B was greater than that of antiserum to enterotoxin C1. These results suggest that a conserved domain is present in the three exotoxins, which most likely originated from a common evolutionary ancestor."
CD010502,0,3895888,0,Evaluation of the Spot-CAMP test for the rapid presumptive identification of group B streptococci.,"A rapid Spot-CAMP test was evaluated for its ability to accurately identify colonies of Streptococcus agalactiae (Lancefield Group B) growing on primary sheep blood agar plates. The test uses a beta-lysin-containing filtrate, which is prepared from a broth culture of Staphylococcus aureus. A drop of beta-lysin filtrate is applied adjacent to a suspected group B Streptococcus (GBS) colony and the plate is incubated and then examined for a zone of synergistic hemolysis. The Spot-CAMP test demonstrated 100% correlation with both a Standard CAMP procedure and Lancefield serogrouping. The rapid Spot-CAMP test was easy to perform and inexpensive, and could presumptively identify within 30 minutes colonies of GBS growing on primary isolation plates."
CD010502,0,16584191,0,"Streptococcal M protein: structural studies of the hypervariable region, free and bound to human C4BP.","Streptococcus pyogenes is a Gram-positive bacterium that causes several diseases, including acute tonsillitis and toxic shock syndrome. The surface-localized M protein, which is the most extensively studied virulence factor of S. pyogenes, has an approximately 50-residue N-terminal hypervariable region (HVR) that plays a key role in the escape of the host immunity. Despite the extensive sequence variability in this region, many HVRs specifically bind human C4b-binding protein (C4BP), a plasma protein that inhibits complement activation. Although the more conserved parts of M protein are known to have dimeric coiled-coil structure, it is unclear whether the HVR also is a coiled coil. Here, we use nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to study the conformational properties of HVRs from M4 and M22 proteins in isolation and in complex with the M protein binding portion of C4BP. We conclude that the HVRs of M4 and M22 are folded as coiled coils and that the folded nucleus of the M4 HVR has a length of approximately 27 residues. Moreover, we demonstrate that the C4BP binding surface of M4-N is found within a region of four heptad repeats. Using molecular modeling, we propose a model for the structure of the M4 HVR that is consistent with our experimental information from NMR spectroscopy."
CD010502,0,19669658,0,Cost-effectiveness of rapid MRSA screening in surgical patients.,"This study investigates the effectiveness of a same-day polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for the rapid detection of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in a general screening of patients admitted to the trauma surgery and heart surgery department in a German university hospital. A total of 442 patients were screened over a 4-month period by using a PCR assay, compared to culture methods, for specimens from the nose and throat. The MRSA carriage rate on admission was 3.85% during the study period. The PCR results of 1,680 swabs showed a sensitivity of 85% and a specificity of 99.39% for swabs from the nares and for the throat 42.11% and 98.78%, respectively. A combination of specimens from the nose and throat from the same patient led to a sensitivity of 100% with a specificity of 98.29%. Cost calculation under the circumstances of a diagnosis-related groups (DRG) payment system found that the eight MRSA-positive patients created costs of 38,472 euros, i.e. 4,809 euros per patient, facing screening costs of 36.62 euros per sample. Screening patients by using the rapid PCR assay for a combination of specimens from the nose and throat would offer a safe and cost-effective way of MRSA screening on admission."
CD010502,0,2576626,0,Few-minutes tests for the identification of group A streptococci and enterococci with chromogenic substrates.,"The usefulness of paper strip tests for rapid identification of Streptococcus pyogenes and enterococci cultured on blood agar plates was investigated. The paper strips used contain dried chromogenic substrates for pyrrolidonyl peptidase (PYRase) and beta-glucosidase (beta-Gluc). Material from only a few colonies needed to be applied to the test strips. The reactions could be read after two min (PYRase) and 5-7 min (beta-Gluc), respectively. Results from testing 503 streptococcal strains were evaluated. The reactions proved very useful for rapid differentiation of S. pyogenes and enterococci from human sources. Nearly all strains of these streptococcal species showed positive reactions in the PYRase test whereas only the enterococci (E. faecalis and E. faecium) were positive for both enzymes."
CD010502,0,15576204,0,"Host-pathogen interactions in Streptococcus pyogenes infections, with special reference to puerperal fever and a comment on vaccine development.","Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococcus) causes a variety of diseases, including acute pharyngitis, impetigo, rheumatic fever and the streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. Moreover, S. pyogenes was responsible for the classical example of a nosocomial infection, the epidemics of puerperal fever (childbed fever) that caused the death of numerous women in earlier centuries. The most extensively studied virulence factor of S. pyogenes is the surface M protein, which inhibits phagocytosis and shows antigenic variation. Recent data indicate that many M proteins confer phagocytosis resistance because the variable N-terminal region has non-overlapping sites that specifically bind two components of the human immune system, the complement inhibitor C4b-binding protein (C4BP) and IgA-Fc. Concerning puerperal fever, molecular and epidemiological analysis suggests that the S. pyogenes surface protein R28 may have played a pathogenetic role in these epidemics. This article summarizes the properties of M protein and the R28 protein and considers a potential problem encountered in connection with the use of animal models for vaccine development."
CD010502,0,6606911,0,[Etiology of acute and chronic bronchopulmonary diseases in children. I. The results of a bacteriological and immunological study].,"The bacteriological study of tracheal aspirate, sputum and bronchial washings obtained from 130 children with acute pneumonia and pleuritis and from 186 children with chronic pneumonia was carried out. In the samples of pleural exudate, urine and blood serum from the patients with acute pneumonia and pleuritis the presence of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae antigens was determined by the method of countercurrent immunoelectrophoresis (CIE). S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae were found to be of different importance in the pathogenesis of acute and chronic bronchopulmonary diseases in children. In acute pneumonia and pleuritis in children who had not been treated with antibiotics pneumococci were isolated in 65.9% of cases and H. influenzae, in 20.4% of cases. In children with chronic pneumonia at the period of exacerbation H. influenzae dominated in the microflora (79%), while pneumococci were isolated 31.9% of cases. The use of CIE permitted the detection of pneumococcal antigen in 21.8% of those exudate samples which had shown no bacterial growth after inoculation. H. influenzae antigen was detected in pleural exudate in 5.4% of cases. In concentrated urine obtained from the children with acute pneumonia and pleuritis pneumococcal antigen was detected in samples from 29.6% of patients, and in nonconcentrated urine the occurrence of this antigen was reduced by half."

To develop a broadly protective vaccine, we analyzed the genome sequences of eight GBS isolates and cloned and tested 312 surface proteins as vaccines. Four proteins elicited protection in mice, and their combination proved highly protective against a large panel of strains, including all circulating serotypes. Protection also correlated with antigen accessibility on the bacterial surface and with the induction of opsonophagocytic antibodies. Multigenome analysis and screening described here represent a powerful strategy for identifying potential vaccine candidates against highly variable pathogens."

We investigated whether uropathogenic GBS can bind to bladder uroepithelium to initiate urinary tract infection. Uropathogenic GBS isolated from a patient with acute cystitis bound to human T24 bladder uroepithelial cells in close association with F-actin in statistically significantly higher numbers compared with nonuropathogenic GBS. In vivo modeling using transurethrally infected mice revealed superior fitness of uropathogenic GBS for bladder colonization and potent uropathogenic GBS-specific up-regulation of interleukin 1alpha during infection. Thus, binding of uropathogenic GBS to uroepithelium and vigorous induction of interleukin 1alpha represents the initial stages of GBS urinary tract infection."

The encouraging results of human trials with conjugate group B polysaccharide vaccines suggest that this approach will lead to a safe and effective method for preventing these devastating infections in newborn infants. The results of preclinical studies of the various strategies to develop group A streptococcal vaccines are also encouraging. Whether one approach will be more advantageous or efficacious than another will need to await clinical trials. Nevertheless, we predict that in the next decade we will make significant strides in preventing streptococcal infections and their complications."
CD010502,0,15819624,0,Mutational analysis of the group A streptococcal operon encoding streptolysin S and its virulence role in invasive infection.,"The pathogen group A Streptococcus (GAS) produces a wide spectrum of infections including necrotizing fasciitis (NF). Streptolysin S (SLS) produces the hallmark beta-haemolytic phenotype produced by GAS. The nine-gene GAS locus (sagA-sagI) resembling a bacteriocin biosynthetic operon is necessary and sufficient for SLS production. Using precise, in-frame allelic exchange mutagenesis and single-gene complementation, we show sagA, sagB, sagC, sagD, sagE, sagF and sagG are each individually required for SLS production, and that sagE may further serve an immunity function. Limited site-directed mutagenesis of specific amino acids in the SagA prepropeptide supports the designation of SLS as a bacteriocin-like toxin. No significant pleotrophic effects of sagA deletion were observed on M protein, capsule or cysteine protease production. In a murine model of NF, the SLS-negative M1T1 GAS mutant was markedly diminished in its ability to produce necrotic skin ulcers and spread to the systemic circulation. The SLS toxin impaired phagocytic clearance and promoted epithelial cell cytotoxicity, the latter phenotype being enhanced by the effects of M protein and streptolysin O. We conclude that all genetic components of the sag operon are required for expression of functional SLS, an important virulence factor in the pathogenesis of invasive M1T1 GAS infection."
CD010502,0,7914206,0,Restricted association between biotypes and serotypes within group A streptococci.,"Investigating individual variations between different isolates of group A streptococci, we observed a close correlation between biotypes and serotypes in 46 strains from pharyngitis patients. Biotyping, carried out with a commercially available rapid identification gallery, delineated 10 different associations of characteristics, designated biotypes 1 to 10, observed both in the manufacturer's (127 strains) and our personal (98 strains) collections of group A strains. Only the most frequent biotypes (biotypes 1 to 6) were observed in the pharyngitis cohort, but the overall frequencies of the biotypes did not display striking differences compared with the control collections. Serotyping of the pharyngitis strains showed that each M type was restricted to a sole biotype. For example, M types 1, 4, and 28 were found only in biotype 1 and M type 6 was found only in biotype 6 strains. This association was not due to an epidemiologic bias, since it was also observed in a control series consisting of reference strains and isolates from distant countries (the United States and Czech Republic versus France). An exception was for M type 78, which exhibited biotype 3 or biotype 4. Investigation of the heterogeneity of the strains at the DNA level showed no significant variations of the ribotype patterns between strains of different biotypes, confirming that group A streptococci belong to a unique and homogeneous species. This previously undescribed association between serotypes and biotypes is of interest for a rapid and preliminary characterization of strains isolated in individual patients or during an outbreak. A possible pathogenic association of some biotypic characteristics with specific M proteins is envisaged."
CD010502,0,6381528,0,Production of bacteriocin-like inhibitors by group A streptococci of nephritogenic M types.,"Application of a bacteriocin-typing scheme that had been designed to minimize the inhibitory effects of hydrogen peroxide and acidic metabolites demonstrated a high incidence (72%) of bacteriocin-like inhibitors belonging to 5 different production (P) types in 61 strains of group A streptococci isolated in association with the development of acute glomerulonephritis. By contrast, only 4 of 16 (25%) rheumatic fever-associated strains were inhibitor positive, and 3 of these strains were P type 604, a P type not detected in any of the nephritis isolates. The P type designation was found to be identical for all inhibitor-positive strains within each particular M serotype, regardless of whether the source was a nephritis patient or an individual having an uncomplicated streptococcal infection. The incidence of inhibitor-positive strains was particularly high in strains of M types 2, 4, 12, 25, 57, and 60; it was moderately high in M types 49, 52, and 55 and absent in M1 and M3. Although the results indicate that the bacteriocin-like inhibitors detected in this study are probably unlikely to have a direct pathogenetic role in either rheumatic fever or acute glomerulonephritis, it does seem that the present P-typing scheme is a useful epidemiological tool, particularly for the presumptive identification of and differentiation among group A streptococcus strains of nephritogenic serotypes."
CD010502,0,1607705,0,"Aspects of pathogenesis of serious group A streptococcal infections in Sweden, 1988-1989.","Serotypes of serious, sometimes fatal, streptococcal infections in Sweden during 1988-1989 were analyzed. The T1M1 type totally dominated, representing almost 70% of all group A streptococci from serious and uncomplicated infections at the peak of the outbreak. Immunoblots of isolates from various patient groups showed that all isolates produced high amounts of erythrogenic toxin (ET) B and high amounts of ET-C, whereas ET-A was released only in small amounts and from few isolates. ELISAs showed high antibody levels to these toxins and to the M1 antigen in patients with uncomplicated infections. Low antibody levels against M1 were seen in patients with bacteremia and in fatal cases; the latter also had low antibody levels against ET-B. It seems likely that a combination of production of large amounts of toxin and low antibody titers to it and to the M antigen of the infecting isolate are determining factors for the outcome of the infection. No signs of primary immune deficiency were noted."

Patients hospitalized with a severe GAS infection, i.e. cases with either invasive GAS (iGAS) disease or patients with a positive non-sterile site culture/rapid antigen test for GAS and clinically considered as having a critical disease, were included in the study. Common clinical presentations were skin and soft tissue infections (53%) and pneumonia (17%). Eight patients (27%) were diagnosed with streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. In 40% of the cases no relevant underlying disease was reported. Among the 16 patients with soft tissue infections, the upper chest, neck or upper arm area was frequently affected and the infection was associated with severe pain. Among the 20 collected isolates, the T1/emm1 type dominated (80%). The majority (86%) of 7 analysed acute sera lacked neutralizing activity against superantigens produced by the patients' own infecting isolate. The study underscores the association between T1/emm1 and outbreaks of serious GAS infections. This highlights the importance of surveillance for prompt identification of more aggressive isolates in the community, thereby increasing awareness among healthcare professionals of these life-threatening infections."
CD010502,0,2428914,0,Immunochemical localization and amino acid sequences of crossreactive epitopes within the group A streptococcal M6 protein.,"mAbs 10A11, 10B6, and 10F5, raised against the native group A streptococcal M6 protein, were examined for their crossreactivity with non-laboratory passaged clinical isolates, representing 58 M serotypes, by bacterial dot blot immunoassay. mAb 10A11 crossreacted with 9, mAb 10B6 with 30, and mAb 10F5 with 30 different non-M6 serotypes. To identify the epitopes for these antibodies, the native M6 protein was cleaved with pepsin or staphylococcal V8 protease. Resultant peptides were purified by HPLC, examined for binding to crossreactive mAbs in ELISA, and reactive peptides were subjected to amino acid sequence analysis. Peptides were aligned with the amino acid sequence of the entire M6 protein predicted by the DNA sequence of the M6 gene. Competitive inhibition studies using peptides synthesized on the basis of peptide and DNA sequences, in concert with selective blocking of amino acid residues, allowed for the further identification and placement of these crossreactive epitopes within the M6 molecule. The 10A11 epitope was located within the six amino acid residues at position 134-139, which repeat at positions 159-164 and 184-189 within the variable amino terminal half of the native molecule. The conserved 10B6 and 10F5 epitopes were positioned within a 15-amino-acid span at position 275-289, with the possibility that either epitope could have been repeated at residues 239-247. Chemical modification of amino acids within this sequence aided in the differentiation of these two epitopes. Such studies should aid in the recognition of a sequence(s) common to a greater number of M serotypes, which may be useful for future vaccine development or group A streptococcal identification."
CD010502,0,18927416,0,Distribution of emm type and antibiotic susceptibility of group A streptococci causing invasive and noninvasive disease.,"To determine the prevalence of macrolide antibiotic and levofloxacin resistance in infections with Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococcus or GAS), strains were collected from 45 medical institutions in various parts of Japan between October 2003 and September 2006. Four hundred and eighty-two strains from patients with GAS infections were characterized genetically. Strains were classified into four groups according to the type of infection: invasive infections (n=74) including sepsis, cellulitis and toxic-shock-like syndrome; acute otitis media (AOM; n=23); abscess (n=53); and pharyngotonsillitis (n=332). Among all strains, 32 emm types were identified; emm1 was significantly more common in invasive infections (39.2 %) and AOM (43.5 %) than in abscesses (3.8 %) or pharyngotonsillitis (10.2 %). emm12 and emm4 each accounted for 23.5 % of pharyngotonsillitis cases. Susceptibility of GAS strains to eight beta-lactam agents was excellent, with MICs of 0.0005-0.063 mug ml(-1). Macrolide-resistant strains accounted for 16.2 % of all strains, while the percentages of strains possessing the resistance genes erm(A), erm(B) and mef(A) were 2.5 %, 6.2 % and 7.5 %, respectively. Although no strains with high resistance to levofloxacin were found, strains with an MIC of 2-4 mug ml(-1) (17.4 %) had amino acid substitutions at either Ser-79 or Asp-83 in ParC. These levofloxacin-intermediately resistant strains included 16 emm types, but macrolide-resistant strains were more likely than others to represent certain emm types."
CD010502,0,1748481,0,Lack of IgG4 antibody response to carbohydrate antigens in patients with lymphatic filariasis.,"It has been suggested that humans are genetically restricted from making IgG4 antibody responses to carbohydrate antigens. To test this hypothesis we examined sera from 35 patients with bancroftian filariasis (an infection known to induce very high levels of IgG4 antibodies to the parasite and known to be associated with repeated streptococcal infections) as well as from 15 normal individuals for their IgG and IgG subclass responses to streptococcal protein [streptolysin-O (SO), deoxyribonuclease B (DB)] and carbohydrate [group A carbohydrate (GAC)] antigens. Levels of IgG antibodies to all three antigens were found to be significantly higher in the filariasis patients compared to normals (P less than 0.01), and the subclass composition of these antibodies proved heterogenous. Although responses to all three antigens included IgG1, IgG2 and IgG3 antibodies and although IgG4 responses to the proteins SO and DB were significantly higher in the filariasis patients than in normals (P less than 0.001), more importantly there were no detectable anti-GAC IgG4 antibodies in either study group. These observations, coupled with our earlier finding of the absence of IgG4 responses to phosphocholine (PC) in patients with lymphatic filariasis, suggest that even the chronic antigenic stimulation of filarial helminth infection, which leads to very prominent IgG4 responses to protein antigens, cannot overcome the genetic restriction in humans for making IgG4 antibodies to carbohydrate antigens, whether of parasite or non-parasite origin."
CD010502,0,3542359,0,Rapid identification of group A streptococci by the Strep-A-Fluor system.,"Group A streptococci can be rapidly identified by the Strep-A-Fluor system (Bio-Spec Inc., Dublin, CA), which uses a specific aminopeptidase to hydrolize L-pyrrolidonyl-beta-naphthylamide. In pure subcultured colonies and in isolated colonies from primary culture plates, the Strep-A-Fluor system had 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity compared with the results of Streptex latex agglutination (Wellcome Research Laboratories, Research Triangle Park, NC). However, in mixed culture from primary culture plates, the sensitivity and specificity were 73% and 95%, respectively. Furthermore, in a routine laboratory setting, the sensitivity was only 91% both from pure subcultured colonies and from isolated colonies from primary culture plates. Contamination with organism other than group A streptococci that are capable of hydrolyzing L-pyrrolidonyl-beta-naphthylamide may explain the low specificity in mixed culture. Deterioration of the buffer reagent due to prolonged use may account for the low sensitivity in a routine laboratory setting."
CD010502,0,10618101,1,Importance of inoculum size and sampling effect in rapid antigen detection for diagnosis of Streptococcus pyogenes pharyngitis.,"Current recommendations suggest that negative rapid Streptococcus pyogenes antigen tests be backed up with a culture, reflecting evidence that culture may have a higher sensitivity and also that testing of a second swab may yield a different (i.e., a positive) result because of variation in sample size or distribution. If the latter is common, the sensitivities of current antigen detection tests might be improved by simply increasing the amount of sample tested. The present study assessed the effect of antigen testing of two swabs extracted together compared to independent testing of each swab extracted separately for children with clinical pharyngitis. S. pyogenes grew from one or both swabs for 198 (37%) of 537 children. The combined culture was significantly (P < 0.05) more sensitive than culture of either swab alone. Compared to combined culture, antigen testing of two swabs extracted and tested together was significantly more sensitive than two single swab extractions (94.1 versus 80%; P = 0.03); however, the specificity was decreased (81.5 versus 89.8 to 92.7%; P < 0.05). This study suggests that sample size and/or uneven sample distribution may have influenced the apparent sensitivities of prior studies that compared antigen tests to a single plate culture. A strategy, such as the one used in the present study, that increases the sample size available for antigen testing (i.e., extraction of samples from both swabs) may improve detection rates to a level that will better approximate true disease status and obviate the need for backup cultures if specificity can be improved."

CD010502,0,8539545,0,Is penicillin the appropriate treatment for recurrent tonsillopharyngitis? Results from a comparative randomized blind study of cefuroxime axetil and phenoxymethylpenicillin in children. The Swedish Study Group.,"The efficacy of cefuroxime axetil compared with phenoxymethylpenicillin (PcV) was studied in group A beta-haemolytic streptococci (GAS) culture-proven tonsillitis in children aged 3-12 years with a history of at least 1 episode of tonsillopharyngitis requiring antibiotic therapy during the previous 3 months. This was a comparative, randomized, investigator-blind, multicentre study. A total of 236 children received either cefuroxime axetil suspension or PcV syrup. Inclusion criteria were a positive, rapid, group A strep test verified by bacteriological culture and clinical signs and symptoms of tonsillopharyngitis. Cefuroxime axetil treatment gave a significantly higher bacteriological eradication rate and clinical cure rate than PcV. At day 2-5 post treatment the eradication rates were 99/114 (87%) for cefuroxime axetil vs 61/109 (56%) for PcV (p < 0.001). The clinical cure rates were 98/114 (86%) and 73/109 (67%) respectively (p < 0.01). Up to 21-28 days post-treatment, 9/114 (8%) cefuroxime axetil patients and 37/109 (34%) PcV patients were treatment failures or had recurrence/reinfection of GAS tonsillopharyngitis (p < 0.001). More than 90% of the patients who experienced bacteriological treatment failure at either the first or second follow-up had the same serotype isolated pre- and post-treatment. During the study period, 21/114 (18%) patients in the cefuroxime axetil group and 50/109 (46%) patients in the PcV group received additional antibiotics (p < 0.001). No serious adverse events were noted and the mild adverse events were equally distributed among the patients in the 2 study groups: 15% for cefuroxime axetil and 14% for PcV."
CD010502,0,17307378,0,Variations in the distribution of genes encoding virulence and extracellular proteins in group A streptococcus are largely restricted to 11 genomic loci.,"Group A streptococcus (GAS) is a human pathogen associated with a wide range of human diseases that vary in symptoms and clinical severity. In this report we describe the use of a targeted low density array representing genes encoding classical virulence factors, purported virulence factors and other extracellular proteins to examine differences in the genetic profiles of 68 clinical GAS isolates. Of the 226 genes on the array (encoding 217 virulence factors or putative extracellular proteins and nine positive control house-keeping proteins) 62 had distributions that were statistically associated with specific GAS M-types. While 32 of these genes were bacteriophage related, the remaining 30 have not previously been described as bacteriophage associated. We show that these 'non-bacteriophage related' genes are found in 11 loci located in five greater chromosomal regions, often near classical GAS virulence factors, and often accompanied by genes associated with mobile genetic elements (MGEs). Many of these loci also demonstrated genetic variation within strains of the same M-type, suggesting these regions to be recombinatorial and mutational hotspots. Evidence for acquisition of genes from other species is also apparent in these loci. Our data suggests that imprecise recombination events involving MGEs not only result in acquisition of new genes, but can also result in deletion of flanking chromosomal genes. Thus MGE related events would appear to be the major contributor to variation of discrete virulence loci, which could account for the disease causing propensity of individual strains. We believe that profiling of the 11 loci could be a meaningful tool in epidemiological GAS typing studies."
CD010502,0,8727479,0,Mapping a conserved conformational epitope from the M protein of group A streptococci.,"The carboxyl terminus of the M protein of group A streptococci (GAS) is highly conserved and contains epitopes that have been shown to induce opsonic antibodies and protection against GAS infection. This region of the protein can also stimulate T cells, which can react in vitro with heart antigens. Since different segments of the carboxyl terminus may be involved in immunity to GAS and in the pathogenesis of autoimmune disease (rheumatic heart disease), it is important to precisely define critical epitopes. However, the M protein is known to be a coiled coil, and a critical immunodominant antibody-binding epitope within this region (peptide 145, a 20-mer with the sequence LRRDLDASREAKK-QVEKALE) is shown here to be conformational. Thus, small synthetic overlapping peptides of 8-12 amino acids in length that span peptide 145 (p145) were unable to capture antibodies present in p145-immune mouse sera or in endemic human sera, even though antibodies raised to these small peptides coupled to diphtheria toxoid could bind the smaller peptides and, in some cases, p145. A series of mutated peptides in which every residue of p145 was sequentially altered also failed to identify critical residues for antibody binding. We thus devised a strategy to produce chimeric peptides in which small peptides copying the M protein sequence were displayed within a larger 28-mer peptide derived from the sequence of the GCN4 leucine zipper DNA binding protein of yeast. A 12-amino-acid window of the p145 sequence was inserted into the GCN4 peptide in such a way as to preserve any potential helical structure. The window was moved along one residue at a time to give a series of peptides representing p145. Circular dichroism demonstrated that these larger chimeric peptides and p145, but not a shorter 12-mer peptide, displayed alpha-helical potential in 50% trifluoroethanol. Certain chimeric peptides efficiently captured antibodies specific for p145 and thus enabled us to map the minimal antibody-binding sequence. RRDLDASREAKK, referred to as J(1)2. The chimeric peptide containing this sequence, referred to as J2, was able to inhibit opsonization of GAS by human antisera containing anti-peptide 145 antibodies. The T-cell response from p145-immunized responder B10.BR mice to J2 and J(I)2 was much lower than the response to p145 and mapped to a different peptide."
CD010502,0,10843420,0,Emm gene polymorphism among temporally clustered group A streptococcal isolates in western Norway.,"Nineteen group A streptococcal isolates obtained in western Norway from patients with invasive disease during a period of high morbidity and mortality were examined for clonality and emm gene polymorphism. These isolates belonged to the prevalent serotypes during the outbreak, namely T1, T3 or T6. Restriction fragment length polymorphism and sequencing of the emm genes were used to compare these isolates with 14 isolates of the same serotype but from non-invasive infections. The restriction analysis did not identify specific invasive clones. The emm genes in three of the four T3 isolates from invasive disease had nucleotide substitutions inducing a charge difference in the N-terminal part of the M protein. The 4 T6 isolates had a longer emm amplicon when compared to 15 isolates from superficial infections and also showed nucleotide substitutions that could induce conformational changes in the hypervariable end of the M protein. Restriction analysis of the emm amplicon of the T6 isolates in order to estimate the number of A- and C-repeats is described. The emm gene sequence served as an epidemiological marker within the serotypes T3 and T6, but the significance of the emm polymorphism displayed by the isolates from invasive disease is uncertain at this stage."
CD010502,0,18174338,0,Degradation of complement 3 by streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin B inhibits complement activation and neutrophil opsonophagocytosis.,"Streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin B (SPE B), a cysteine protease, is an important virulence factor in group A streptococcus (GAS) infection. The inhibition of phagocytic activity by SPE B may help prevent bacteria from being ingested. In this study, we examined the mechanism SPE B uses to enable bacteria to resist opsonophagocytosis. Using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, we found that SPE B-treated serum impaired the activation of the classical, the lectin, and the alternative complement pathways. In contrast, C192S, a SPE B mutant lacking protease activity, had no effect on complement activation. Further study showed that cleavage of serum C3 by SPE B, but not C192S, blocked zymosan-induced production of reactive oxygen species in neutrophils as a result of decreased deposition of C3 fragments on the zymosan surface. Reconstitution of C3 into SPE B-treated serum unblocked zymosan-mediated neutrophil activation dose dependently. SPE B-treated, but not C192S-treated, serum also impaired opsonization of C3 fragments on the surface of GAS strain A20. Moreover, the amount of C3 fragments on the A20 cell surface, a SPE B-producing strain, was less than that on its isogenic mutant strain, SW507, after opsonization with normal serum. A20 opsonized with SPE B-treated serum was more resistant to neutrophil killing than A20 opsonized with normal serum, and SPE B-mediated resistance was C3 dependent. These results suggest a novel SPE B mechanism, one which degrades serum C3 and enables GAS to resist complement damage and opsonophagocytosis."
CD010502,0,17005792,0,Molecular characterization of clinical isolates of M non-typable group A streptococci from invasive disease cases.,"Currently there are 93 validated M serotypes of Streptococcus pyogenes, Lancefield group A streptococcus (GAS), and >130 emm genotypes. A marked increase in the number of non-typable GAS isolates (2 % in 2000, 4 % in 2001 and 9 % in 2002) from invasive disease cases referred to the authors' reference laboratory was noted during 2000-2002. A total of 217 (92 %) were from blood cultures, 14 (6 %) from deep abscesses and five (2 %) from aspirates. The clinical manifestations included bacteraemia, septicaemia, cellulitis, meningitis, necrotizing fasciitis and toxic-shock syndrome. In order to establish whether this increase was due to the emergence of novel types or the unavailability of M-typing sera, these isolates were subjected to emm sequencing. A total of 144 isolates (61 %) belonged to M types for which sera were no longer available; 112 (48 %) belonged to higher M types, including emm83.1 (9 %), emm94 (8 %) emm87 (6 %) and emm89 (6 %); and 32 (13 %) belonged to lower M types that were not commonly isolated in the UK, and included M25, M43, M49, M64, M73 and M74. Sixty-six (28 %) of the isolates belonged to newly designated emm types. Other isolates belonged to the novel emm types st2147, STNS1033 and st854, recently registered in the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) database by other laboratories. One novel emm type, st2161, was isolated from an injecting drug user. There were differences in the type distribution of these isolates according to geographic location. However, 90 % of emm93, one of seven predominant emm types identified amongst the collection of M non-typable (MNT) isolates, were isolated from the London region."
CD010502,0,12928595,0,Deoxyribonuclease-inhibitory antibodies in systemic lupus erythematosus.,"Deoxyribonucleases (DNases) are key enzymes for digesting DNA. Abnormalities in the function of these enzymes may contribute to the development of anti-DNA antibodies in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). In this study, we used bovine DNase 1-coated ELISA plates to screen anti-DNase antibodies in SLE patients. About 62% of the sera of SLE patients (63/101) were positive for anti-DNase antibodies compared to only 8% of normal controls (8/98). A positive correlation was also found between the concentrations of anti-DNase and anti-DNA antibodies in sera of SLE patients. Affinity-purified anti-DNase immunoglobulin G (IgG) from pooled sera of SLE patients bound to bovine DNase as well as DNA. A synthetic peptide, corresponding to the catalytic site of DNase, was able to completely inhibit the binding of anti-DNase IgG to DNase. In addition to bovine DNase, the anti-DNase IgG also bound to and inhibited the enzymatic activities of DNase present in streptococcal supernatants and human urine. Immunization of lupus-prone NZB/NZW mice with bovine DNase enhanced the production of anti-DNase and DNA antibodies, and accelerated the occurrence of proteinuria. Taken together, these results suggest that DNase-inhibitory antibodies which recognize a conserved epitope near the catalytic site of DNase may act in the pathogenesis of SLE."
CD010502,0,8816411,0,A highly variable region in members of the streptococcal M protein family binds the human complement regulator C4BP.,"Strains of Streptococcus pyogenes express one or more molecules that are members of the M protein family, a group of surface proteins implicated in virulence. A characteristic property of the molecules in this family is the presence of a highly variable N-terminal region, whose function is unknown. Here we show that human C4b-binding protein (C4BP), a regulatory component of the complement system, binds to the highly variable region of many members of the M protein family. Chimeric molecules, in which the N-terminal regions of four different C4BP-binding proteins were combined with the C-terminal part of the non-binding M5 protein, had intact C4BP-binding ability, as judged by binding assays and Scatchard analysis with highly purified molecules. Moreover, work with the C4BP-binding Arp4 protein showed that an N-terminal 52-residue fragment retained binding ability, and that a 21-residue synthetic peptide derived from the variable region completely inhibited the binding of C4BP. Computer-assisted analysis of the four C4BP-binding regions studied here (45-66 amino acid residues) indicated that they lack residue identities that could explain their ability to bind the same ligand, but differ from the nonbinding M5 protein in their lower propensity to form a coiled-coil. Thus, the variable C4BP-binding regions have an extraordinary capacity for sequence variation, while retaining the ability to bind C4BP. These data indicate that an important function of the variable region in members of the M protein family is to bind a host protein that down-regulates the complement system."
CD010502,0,22002182,0,Distribution of emm types in invasive and non-invasive group A and G streptococci.,"Our study describes the emm type distributions of invasive and non-invasive group A streptococci (GAS) and group G streptococci (GGS) strains in one of the biggest Health Districts in Finland. A total of 571 GAS or GGS were recovered from patients with invasive or non-invasive infections during a 1-year period in 2008-2009 in Pirkanmaa Health District in Finland. We describe here the emm type distributions of GAS and GGS collected from throat (n = 246), pus (n = 217), deep tissue (n = 56) and blood (n = 52). The most common emm types among GAS were emm77, emm1, emm28, emm89 and emm12. Among GGS, the most common emm types were stG480, stG643, stG6, stC6979 and stG485. Some emm types were found to associate with certain infection focus. In GAS, emm77 associated with pus isolates, whereas emm1 and emm12 were more frequent among throat isolates. In GGS, stG480 was more commonly found from throat isolates."
CD010502,0,16081955,0,Genetic diversity among type emm28 group A Streptococcus strains causing invasive infections and pharyngitis.,"Genome sequencing of group A Streptococcus (GAS) has revealed that prophages account for the vast majority of gene content differences between strains. Serotype M28 strains are a leading cause of pharyngitis and invasive infections, but little is known about genetic diversity present in natural populations of these organisms. To study this issue, population-based samples of 568 strains from Ontario, Canada; Finland; and Houston, Texas, were analyzed. Special attention was given to analysis of variation in prophage-encoded virulence gene content by a PCR-based method. Thirty and 29 distinct prophage-encoded virulence gene profiles were identified among pharyngitis and invasive infection isolates. Thirteen profiles, representing the majority of the strains, were shared between these two classes of isolates. Significant differences were observed in the frequency of occurrence of certain prophage toxin gene profiles and infection type. M28 strains are highly diverse in prophage-encoded virulence gene content and integration site, supporting the key concept that prophages are critical contributors to GAS genetic diversity and population biology. Nucleotide sequence variation in the emm gene (encodes M protein) was also examined. Only three allelic variants were identified in the hypervariable portion of the emm28 gene. All but one strain had the same inferred amino acid sequence in the first 100 amino acids of the mature M28 protein. In contrast, size differences in the emm28 gene and inferred protein due to variable numbers of C-terminal repeats were common. The presence of macrolide resistance genes (mefA, ermB, and ermTR) was analyzed by PCR, and less than 2% of the strains were positive."

Both the intact tubular epithelial cells and oedematous interstitium had strong positive signals, whereas only interstitial inflammation was dominant without tubular necrosis. Reflective of the nature of AIN is that the injury from the hypersensitivity reaction was specific for renal interstitium instead of tubules. SPE B is potentially allergenic and may confuse the clinicians due to its clinical mimicry of drug-induced AIN. Although very rare, AIN might be included into the differential diagnosis of patients with streptococcal sepsis and acute renal failure."

CD010502,0,6421209,0,[Rapid diagnosis of purulent meningitis].,"The cerebrospinal fluid of 589 subjects, 78 of whom were suffering from a purulent meningitis were examined. Comparatively by classical bacteriological techniques (direct examination and culture) and by electro-immunodiffusion, latex agglutination, and Limulus endotoxin assay. Soluble bacterial Haemophilus influenzae type B, Neisseria meningitidis group A, C, and Streptococcus pneumoniae antigens, were tested by electro-immunodiffusion and latex agglutination, and soluble bacterial N. meningitidis group B, Listeria monocytogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae antigens by electro-immunodiffusion. Specific antigens and endotoxin were found in 75.8 per cent of the specimens with a rapid answer (120 min). The three tests revealed also only the diagnosis in 29.1 per cent of cases of pneumococcal meningitis, in 33.3 per cent of meningococcal meningitis and in 47 per cent of Gram-negative bacteria meningitis. Only five cerebrospinal fluid from the 589 specimens tested were given a non-specific reaction. These two advantages--sensitivity and specificity--of these three tests render them techniques of the future in the diagnosis of purulent meningitis."
CD010502,0,2664456,0,Cell surface proteins of a group A streptococcus type M4: the IgA receptor and a receptor related to M proteins are coded for by closely linked genes.,"Two genes coding for cell surface proteins were cloned from a group A streptococcus type M4: the gene for an IgA binding protein and the gene for a fibrinogen binding protein. Both proteins were purified and partially characterized after expression in Escherichia coli. There was no immunological cross-reaction between the two proteins. The IgA binding protein, called protein Arp4, is similar to an IgA receptor previously purified from another strain of group A streptococci, but the proteins are not identical. Characterization of many independent clones showed that the two proteins described here are coded for by closely linked genes. Bacterial mutants have been found which have simultaneously lost the ability to express both genes, and a simple method to isolate such mutants is described. The existence of these variants indicates that expression of the two cell surface proteins may be coordinately regulated. Binding of fibrinogen is a characteristic property of streptococcal M proteins, and the available evidence suggests that the fibrinogen binding protein is indeed an M protein."
CD010502,0,15071004,0,Detection of multiple macrolide- and lincosamide-resistant strains of Streptococcus pyogenes from patients in the Boston area.,"Macrolide (including erythromycin and azithromycin) and lincosamide (including clindamycin) antibiotics are recommended for treatment of penicillin-allergic patients with Streptococcus pyogenes pharyngitis. Resistance to erythromycin in S. pyogenes can be as high as 48% in specific populations in the United States. Macrolide and lincosamide resistance in S. pyogenes is mediated by several different genes. Expression of the erm(A) or erm(B) genes causes resistance to erythromycin and inducible or constitutive resistance to clindamycin, respectively, whereas expression of the mef(A) gene leads to resistance to erythromycin but not clindamycin. We studied the resistance of S. pyogenes to erythromycin and clindamycin at an urban tertiary-care hospital. Of 196 sequential isolates from throat cultures, 15 (7.7%) were resistant to erythromycin. Three of these were also constitutively resistant to clindamycin and had the erm(B) gene. Five of the erythromycin-resistant isolates were resistant to clindamycin upon induction with erythromycin and had the erm(A) gene. The remaining seven erythromycin-resistant isolates were susceptible to clindamycin even upon induction with erythromycin and had the mef(A) gene. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis and emm typing demonstrated that the erythromycin-resistant S. pyogenes comprised multiple strains. These results demonstrate that multiple mechanisms of resistance to macrolide and lincosamide antibiotics are present in S. pyogenes strains in the United States."
CD010502,0,2327842,0,Clinical and microbiological evidence for endemic pharyngitis among adults due to group C streptococci.,"Group C beta-hemolytic streptococci cause rare epidemic outbreaks of pharyngitis, but their role in sporadic endemic pharyngitis has been uncertain. We addressed the question of whether non-group A beta-hemolytic streptococci are associated with endemic pharyngitis in two ways. First, we compared rates of isolation from throat swabs of group A, B, C, and G and ungrouped beta-hemolytic streptococci (""culture negative"") in adult patients vs those rates in controls. Second, we collected in standardized form clinical indexes of patients with pharyngitis: signs and symptoms graded for severity, the examining physician's subjective estimate of the probability of streptococcal pharyngitis, a logistic regression score predicting streptococcal pharyngitis, and whether antibiotic therapy was prescribed. After collecting data and cultures on 1425 patients with sore throats and cultures on 284 controls, we found the following: group C streptococci were isolated significantly more frequently in patients with sore throats than in controls (6% vs 1.4%); four clinical signs and two symptoms distinguished group C-associated pharyngitis as more severe than culture-negative pharyngitis; and six clinical signs and one symptom distinguished group C-associated pharyngitis as less severe than group A pharyngitis. Physicians' subjective estimates, logistic regression scores, and antibiotic treatment all characterized group C-associated pharyngitis as more severe than culture-negative sore throats but less severe than group A pharyngitis. From these data we present the first definitive evidence that group C streptococci are associated with endemic pharyngitis, show that clinical presentation distinguishes a group of patients with group C-associated pharyngitis from populations with culture-negative sore throats and from those with group A pharyngitis. Physicians' response to that presentation merits consideration in the context of rapid group-specific diagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis by group A antigen tests."

CD010502,0,15988608,0,Variations in the protective immune response against streptococcal superantigens in populations of different ethnicity.,"Superantigens (SAgs) from group A streptococcus (GAS) are potent T cell mitogens, and have been suggested to play a role in severe streptococcal disease. Neutralizing antibodies protect against SAg-mediated disease and their levels should therefore be inversely related to severe streptococcal infection. Neutralizing anti-SAg titers in patients with severe GAS infection and patients without disease were compared in two separate groups. The first group comprised patients with invasive GAS disease from New Zealand European, Maori, and Pacific Island descent. The second group comprised Aboriginal Australian individuals with rheumatic heart disease and/or a past history of acute rheumatic fever. Patients sera were tested for their ability to neutralize T cell mitogenicity of recombinant streptococcal SAgs as a measure of functional SAg-neutralizing antibody concentration. In both studies, no inverse correlation was observed between disease and the level of serum SAg-neutralizing activity. Notably, much higher levels of natural immunity to all streptococcal SAgs were found in New Zealand Maori, New Zealand Pacific Island, and Aboriginal Australian individuals, suggesting a high degree of natural exposure and seroconversion in these groups compared to the New Zealand European cohort. Levels of serum antibodies against SAgs could not be used to predict disease susceptibility in groups with existing high levels of SAg-neutralizing antibodies."

The results were compared with those obtained by virus isolation and serology. Altogether, 56 RS virus-positive (prospective study), 51 adenovirus-positive (retrospective study), and 27 negative (prospective study) samples were examined. The sensitivities of ELISA were 96 and 98% for RS virus and adenovirus antigen detection, respectively. No false-positive results were observed. It is concluded that the joint eluate from a nasal and a pharyngeal swab, properly taken and handled, serves well for the detection of RS virus and adenovirus acute respiratory infections by ELISA."
CD010502,0,8500480,0,Evaluation of two enzyme immunoassays for rapid detection of group B streptococci in pregnant women.,"The performance of two enzyme immunoassays for rapid detection of group B streptococci (GBS) was evaluated in comparison to culture using cervical swabs from 191 pregnant women. Ten percent of the women harboured GBS. There were two positive results in the Icon assay (Hybritech), both in women with heavy growth in the culture, and four positive results in the Quidel assay (Quidel), two in the women with heavy colonization and one each in women with moderate and light growth of GBS respectively. The sensitivity of both assays was low, being 11% (2/18) for the Icon assay and 24% (4/17) for the Quidel assay. The specificity of both assays was 100%. Both assays could detect > or = 10(6) group B streptococci per swab. A positive result justifies ampicillin prophylaxis due to the high risk for the newborn. A negative result should be confirmed by rapid culture techniques."
CD010502,0,11191152,0,Acute respiratory tract infections in Indian children with special reference to Mycoplasma pneumoniae.,"A total of 70 Indian children of either sex and under 5 years of age who were admitted to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi during a 1-year period (January 1994-December 1994) with complaints suggestive of acute respiratory tract infections (ARTI), were investigated for bacterial aetiology of infection with special reference to Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Microbial aetiology could be established in 44/70 (62.8 per cent) of cases of ARTI. Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection was seen in 21/70 (30 per cent), aerobic bacteria in 14/70 (20 per cent), Chlamydia pneumoniae in 2/70 (2.8 per cent), and mixed infection with mycoplasma either with bacteria and/or chlamydia in 7/70 (10 per cent). However, in 26/70 (37.1 per cent) cases no cause could be detected. Diagnosis of infection with M.pneumoniae was based on culture in 2/20 (10 per cent) cases, antigen detection in throat swab by indirect immunofluorescence assay using specific antibody in 16/70 (22.8 per cent) cases, and demonstration of IgM antibody in serum by serodia Myco II particle agglutination test in 17/70 (24.2 per cent). Streptococcus pneumoniae (9/70, 12.8 per cent) and Staphylococcus aureus (5/70, 7.1 per cent) were the aerobic isolates from blood in these patients. Results of this study indicate that M.pneumoniae plays a significant role in respiratory tract infection in an Indian paediatric population. Rapid diagnostic procedures, such as antigen detection and IgM antibody demonstration, should be used more widely to determine the infective aetiology early in the course of illness. The study also highlights the mixed aetiology in ARTI in children, which has important therapeutic implications."

Immunoglobulin-G class antibody titres to these organisms were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Serum levels in the patients were determined at day 1 and 42-56 days later. Significantly higher antibody levels to F. nucleatum and Pr. intermedia were found in the second serum sample of patients as compared to their first sample. The elevated antibody levels to F. nucleatum and Pr. intermedia, known oral pathogens, suggest a potential pathogenic role for these organisms in the pharyngo-tonsillitis associated with infectious mononucleosis."

CD010502,0,12791905,0,Evaluation of Copan swabs with liquid transport media for use in the Gen-Probe Group A Strep Direct Test.,"The Gen-Probe Group A Streptococcus Direct Test (GASDT), which detects the presence or absence of group A streptococci directly from pharyngeal specimens, utilizes a specific relative light unit (RLU) cutoff of 4,500 to differentiate between positive and negative test results. In response to a report by a manufacturer that the background RLU values for the Copan rayon swabs with liquid media were higher than the RLU values typically observed with Culturette swabs, we tested multiple lots of Copan rayon swabs with liquid media and determined that the swabs are unacceptable for routine use in the GASDT. The high background RLU values for the Copan rayon swabs appear to be a direct result of the gamma irradiation used to sterilize the swabs. We also performed a comparative clinical evaluation of Copan Dacron swabs with liquid media and Culturette swabs for use in the GASDT. Overall, there was 97.5% agreement between the results obtained with the Copan Dacron swabs and those obtained with the Culturette swabs. Compared to Culturette swabs, the Copan Dacron swabs had a sensitivity and a specificity of 97 and 98%, respectively. Copan Dacron swabs with liquid media are an acceptable alternative to the swabs currently qualified for use with the GASDT, but Copan rayon swabs with liquid transport media should not be used in the GASDT."
CD010502,0,10459477,1,Evaluation of the Strep A OIA assay versus culture methods: ability to detect different quantities of group A Streptococcus.,"The Strep A OIA assay by Biostar (Boulder, Co., USA) is a unique optical immunoassay system for the rapid detection of Group A streptococcal carbohydrate. As part of a community-based pediatric cohort study of Group A Streptococcus (GAS) persistence following antibiotic therapy of pharyngitis, the performance of the Strep A OIA assay was compared with the amount of growth from standard throat swab culture methods. A total of 363 throat swabs taken over the course of the study was evaluated from 248 children between 2 and 18 years of age. Two culture methods were performed: an agar plate with the throat swab using Columbia agar base with 5% sheep blood incubated under an anaerobic environment for 48 h and Todd-Hewitt broth (THB) enhancement. The Strep A OIA was then performed. A total of 144 of 363 (39.7%) samples was positive for GAS by one or more of the laboratory tests across study visits: agar culture detected 132 of 144 (91.7%), THB culture detected 128 of 144 (88.9%), and the Strep A OIA assay detected 129 of 144 (89.6%). Complete agreement among all three laboratory tests was found for 333 of 363 (91.7%) of the samples. Agar culture results were comparable to THB cultures with a sensitivity of 96.9%, specificity of 96.6%, a positive predictive value of 93.9%, and a negative predictive value of 98.3%. Although the performance of the Strep A OIA assay had similar specificity (96.5%) and positive predictive value (93.8%) compared with the combined results of the two culture methods, the sensitivity (89.0%) and negative predictive value (93.6%) were lower. A significant difference (p < 0.001) was found in the ability of the Strep A OIA assay to detect agar culture-positive swabs that had a light growth (1+ or 2+) (63.0%) versus a moderate (3+) or heavy (4+) growth (98.1%) of GAS. Although the Strep A OIA assay allows GAS throat swab results to be reported an average of 24 h sooner than either of the cultures, the rapid assay was not as sensitive in detecting light growth GAS-positive cultures."

CD010502,0,16514156,0,Genetic diversity of the C protein beta-antigen gene and its upstream regions within clonally related groups of type Ia and Ib group B streptococci.,"C protein beta antigen (Bac), a surface protein of group B streptococci (GBS), is known to concurrently bind the Fc portion of IgA and factor H (FH). The authors' previous work has demonstrated that mRNA expression levels show diversity among clonally related strains containing genes (bac) encoding Bac, with high expression noted in invasive strains. In this study, the bac gene and upstream regions containing putative promoters, three ORFs and an IS1381 insertion sequence were characterized. Three invasive strains showed high bac expression levels and did not show any notable mutations except one strain producing Bac that was able to bind FH but not IgA. A deletion of 51 amino acid residues, including part of the Bac IgA-binding region, was identified and hypothesized to contribute to the loss of the IgA-binding ability of this strain. A vaginal strain that showed somewhat higher bac expression levels and produced Bac lacking immunoreactivity contained an 11 bp deletion, which generated a premature termination codon, in the region preceding the IgA-binding region. In another vaginal strain that did not express bac, disruption of the upstream ORFs of the sensor histidine kinase and DNA-binding response regulator, due to frameshift mutations, was noted although it is not known whether these proteins directly affect bac expression levels. An IS1381 insertion into the promoter region was found in another vaginal strain that showed low expression levels and produced Bac with a significantly larger proline-rich repeat region. These results demonstrate considerable genetic diversity of the bac and upstream regions of invasive and noninvasive GBS, which may contribute to the variability of bac expression levels among those strains."

CD010502,0,9082821,0,Role of gamma delta-T cells in the palatine tonsil.,"Gamma delta-T cells in the tonsil were evaluated by flow cytometric analysis and immunohistological study using monoclonal antibodies to the gamma delta-T cell receptor. Flow cytometric analysis using TCR-gamma/delta-1 showed that 2.2%, of T cells in the tonsil obtained from patients with recurrent or chronic tonsillitis expressed the gamma delta-T cell receptor. Immunohistologically, gamma delta-T cells were found mainly in the extrafollicular area, i.e., the T-cell zone, and showed strong migration to the crypt epithelium in tonsils with infections. The comparison on number of gamma delta-T cells in cases with simple hypertrophic tonsil and in cases with recurrent or chronic tonsillitis showed that tonsils with repeated or chronic infections had a significantly greater number of gamma delta-T cells than tonsils without infection. To address the functional aspects of gamma delta-T cells in the tonsil, the production of IL-2 of separated gamma delta-T cells was measured by solid phase ELISA. Increased IL-2 production was observed with staphylococcal enterotoxin A and B stimulation, and this increase was blocked by antibody to the gamma delta-T cell receptor, indicating that the production of IL-2 may be triggered by the interaction between the gamma delta-T cell receptor and staphylococcal enterotoxin. Our results show that gamma delta-T cells in the tonsil, especially in the crypt epithelium, may be activated by various bacterial antigens or heat shock protein released from damaged epithelial cells. The activated gamma delta-T cells will produce cytokines including IL-2 and function as so-called 'first-layer' immunity."

Chlamydia cell culture is difficult and time-consuming to perform. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a more rapid but also more expensive technique used to identify Chlamydia in pharyngeal swab, but it can be performed only in few specialized laboratories. We tested a rapid enzyme immuno-assay to detect Chlamydia in 20 children with respiratory infections (mean age 3.29 years; male:female ratio = 12:8) and in 21 healthy children (mean age 4.70 years male:female ratio = 15:6). Prevalence of Chlamydia isolation from pharyngeal swab was very high in both patients and healthy children without a significative difference in the two considered groups (45% vs 42%, p = 0.8). Specific Chlamydia IgG antibodies were undetectable in all patients and healthy children. Nine out of 20 patients affected by acute respiratory disease were Chlamydia-positive and 11 out 20 were Chlamydia-negative: these two groups didn't differ in regard to clinical and laboratory features, whereas duration of symptoms was significantly longer in Chlamydia-positive patients (9.3 vs 5.5 days, p = 0.014). Our study suggests a high prevalence of Chlamydia pharyngeal swab positivity in both healthy and sick children. Diagnosis of Chlamydia infection was not feasible on the basis of the considered clinical and laboratory findings."

Eight different PFGE types were distinguished, and each emm type showed an individual PFGE pattern. Our results show that--similarly to results obtained in several other countries--emm type 1 strains predominate among invasive GAS isolates, and that emm 1 type strains recovered from severe streptococcal infections were associated with the presence of the speA gene. The rate for macrolide resistance proved low: only two isolates showed elevated MICs for erythromycin."

Although four species of the R antigen have been described for GBS, the R4 protein is the most prevalent in GBS isolates recovered from humans. This study examined the prevalence of antibodies against the R4 antigen by Western blot (immunoblot) (WB) in sera from 40 mothers colonized with GBS serotype II and III and from 26 noncolonized mothers; 92.5% of the colonized mothers had anti-R4 antibodies, compared with 54% of the noncolonized mothers (P < 0.001). Findings of antibodies in neonatal cord sera (n = 14) were concordant with maternal results by WB analysis for 71% of mother-infant pairs colonized with serotype II and for 57% of pairs colonized with serotype III. Of mothers known to be colonized with type II/R4 or III/R4, 100% (n = 12) had antibody against R4 by WB. This study also evaluated the prevalence of antibody to the GBS R4 antigen in 48 sera from individuals with high and low group A streptococcal anti-DNase B titers. Of those individuals with an anti-DNase B titer of > 640, 64% had a positive WB for anti-R4 antibody, compared with 30% of individuals with low anti-DNase B titers (P < 0.05). The R4 antigen of GBS had immunologic identity to the R4 antigen of group A streptococci. Overall, the findings suggested that antibodies to the streptococcal R4 antigen were commonly present in GBS-colonized mothers and that transplacental passage of these antibodies occurred. The presence of antibody to R4 in non-GBS-colonized individuals may be due to immunologic responses to past exposure to the R antigen present in GBS or other streptococcal groups."

Two-dimensional gel analysis was performed with material from four patients with HPL and five patients with CT. An average of approximately 600 spots were detected in each gel. A total of 127 different proteins were identified in 158 spots analyzed by mass spectrometry. Our study revealed disease-associated differences between protein abundance for two protein spots, an HSP27 isoform and UMP-CMP kinase. Both protein spots were more abundant in the CT group. HSP27 ELISA was performed for 32 patients, 12 belonging to the HPL group and 20 to the CT group. ELISA could not be used to differentiate HSP27 isoforms nor to distinguish CT from HPL. HSP27 was found to migrate to two further protein spots in the 2D gels. The differently expressed HSP27 isoform migrated as the most acidic of all the HSP27 isoforms detected, indicating the highest degree of phosphorylation. The sum of all three HSP27 abundances in the gels from the CT group was not different from that of the HPL group, consistent with the ELISA results. Our results suggest that phosphorylation differences caused the observed migration differences of HSP27. Together with the UMP-CMP kinase abundance differences, we conclude that kinase and/or phosphatase activity are different in CT and HPL."

SSA and SEB, however, do not compete for binding on the surfaces of cells expressing MHC class II molecules. This behavior had been ascribed to SSA and SEB binding to distinct sites on, or different subsets of, HLA-DR molecules. Here we demonstrate that SSA binds predominantly to HLA-DQ, rather than to HLA-DR molecules, and present the crystal structure of SSA at 1.85 A resolution. These data provide a structural basis for interpreting the interaction of SSA with HLA-DQ molecules as well as a foundation for understanding bacterial superantigen affinities for distinct MHC isotypes."

CD010502,0,15557185,0,Interaction between complement regulators and Streptococcus pyogenes: binding of C4b-binding protein and factor H/factor H-like protein 1 to M18 strains involves two different cell surface molecules.,"Streptococcus pyogenes, or group A Streptococcus, is one of the most frequent causes of pharyngitis and skin infections in humans. Many virulence mechanisms have been suggested to be involved in the infectious process. Among them is the binding to the bacterial cell surface of the complement regulatory proteins factor H, factor H-like protein 1 (FHL-1), and C4b-binding protein. Previous studies indicate that binding of these three regulators to the streptococcal cell involves the M protein encoded by the emm gene. M-type 18 strains are prevalent among clinical isolates and have been shown to interact with all three complement regulators simultaneously. Using isogenic strains lacking expression of the Emm18 or the Enn18 proteins, we demonstrate in this study that, in contradistinction to previously described S. pyogenes strains, M18 strains bind the complement regulators factor H, FHL-1, and C4b-binding protein through two distinct cell surface proteins. Factor H and FHL-1 bind to the Emm18 protein, while C4BP binds to the Enn18 protein. We propose that expression of two distinct surface structures that bind complement regulatory proteins represents a unique adaptation of M18 strains that enhances their resistance to opsonization by human plasma and increases survival of this particular S. pyogenes strain in the human host. These new findings illustrate that S. pyogenes has evolved diverse mechanisms for recruitment of complement regulatory proteins to the bacterial surface to evade immune clearance in the human host."

Quantitative detection of rotavirus and IgA was performed by an ELISA technique. The maximal rotavirus shedding was found between the second and fifth day and the maximal excretion of IgA antibody about the seventh day, which marked the clinical recovery of most children. Throat swabs were examined for both virus particles and specific IgA antibody to try to document the respiratory spread of rotavirus infection. Rotavirus antigen could not be demonstrated in the throat swabs, but specific IgA antibody was detected at levels comparable to the faecal specimens obtained at clinical recovery. The observations indicate that the presence of rotavirus secretory IgA limits the duration of diarrhoea and plays a major role in the intestinal resistance to infection."

Each of these genes encode proteins with an LPXTG amino acid motif that covalently links many virulence factors produced by gram-positive bacteria to the cell surface. Western immunoblot analysis of serum samples obtained from 80 patients with invasive infections, noninvasive soft tissue infections, pharyngitis, and rheumatic fever indicated that these four proteins are expressed in vivo. However, the level of gene transcript and the time of maximal gene transcription varied in representative serotype M1, M3, and M18 strains. Surface expression of two proteins was confirmed by flow cytometry. Studies using a mouse infection model suggest that antibodies specific for one of the proteins (Spy0843) may contribute to a protective host immune response against a serotype M1 infection. These results are additional evidence that postgenomic strategies provide new ways to identify and investigate novel bacterial proteins that may participate in host-pathogen interactions or serve as targets for therapeutics research."

However, there have been virtually no extensive reports and comparisons of diverse temporal and geographic community isolates from uncomplicated throat infections to confirm the hypothesis. A unique collection of such ""control"" strains allowed in-depth assessment of association of M serotypes 1, 3, and 28 ""clones"" with invasive infections. Clones were defined by using small-fragment chromosomal restriction-enzyme analysis, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, and M protein gene (emm) sequencing. After comparison with controls, no clone within these M serotypes had statistically increased association with invasive infections. The prevalence of specific virulence-associated clones appeared to essentially reflect their normal population prevalence. Although this does exclude other potential streptococcal factors, these findings suggest that host factors including individual and population-based immunity must also be significant in influencing infection potential."

In two studies, a total of 1,275 throat swabs were tested for the presence of this antigen with the Strep A OIA rapid detection system and the results were compared with those of standard culture methods. In both studies, the Strep A OIA yielded more positive results than plating of the throat swab onto a selective agar, Trypticase soy agar containing sheep blood, or an enriched broth. In one study, the sensitivity and specificity of Strep A OIA compared with those of the broth-enriched culture were 97.4 and 95.6%, respectively. In a second study a sensitivity of 98.9% and a specificity of 98.6% were achieved. It was also shown that the carbohydrate antigen could be detected in the absence of viable GAS organisms. The Strep A OIA is an easily interpretable method and was shown to be more sensitive than routine culture methods for detecting GAS infections directly from throat swabs."
CD010502,0,6312703,0,[Virus and other infections in pregnancy: diagnosis and prevention. 2].,"The various viral and other microbial infections represent only a small proportion (5-10%) of the noxae which threaten pregnancy and the fetus. However, interest is centered on them because methods of controlling them are now available. These include preventive measures, e.g., active immunization prior to pregnancy for measles, mumps, and rubella; passive prophylaxis with immunoglobulins when the pregnant women comes into contact with, e.g., rubella and varicella, and passive-active prophylaxis with hyperimmunoglobulin and simultaneous active immunization of the newborns from HBsAg and HBeAg-positive resp. anti-HBe-negative mothers and early therapy. The latter is possible for acute herpes simplex and toxoplasmosis infection; it is effective for lues and infections with gonococci, listeriae, beta-hemolytic streptococci, chlamydiae and mycoplasmas. In cases of acute rubella during the first 17 weeks of pregnancy termination of pregnancy must also be considered a prophylactic measure. Laboratory diagnosis today includes, in addition to the conventional tests for antibodies and pathogens, determination of IgG (permanent) and IgM (early) antibodies as well as demonstration of antigens. Depending on the type of pathogen and the diagnostic problem, several types of serologic tests must be combined for rapid determination of the immune status on contact or for detection of acute infections in pregnancy; necessitating in some instances also the isolation of the pathogen. Diagnostic procedures are similar for identifying prenatal and perinatal infection with and without abnormalities in the neonate. Modern laboratory diagnosis is therefore very important for prophylactic and therapeutic measures in pregnancy as well as for further management and supportive care of congenitally infected infants."

PBMC were stimulated in parallel with heat-killed group A streptococcal cells, E. coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and with concanavalin A (Con A) in certain experiments for comparative purposes. The cytokines were assayed in the supernatant fluids by ELISA. IL-13 expression was also determined by a quantitative competitive PCR. IL-3, IL-5, GM-CSF, IL-12 p40, IL-12 heterodimer and IL-13 expression was induced by SPE A in a time- and dose-dependent manner in rather substantial amounts except the IL-12 heterodimer, which was released in small quantities. In contrast to SPE A, IL-3, IL-5 and IL-13 were not or poorly elicited by streptococcal cells or LPS whereas these two stimulants induced relatively high amounts of GM-CSF. Interestingly, both IL-12 p40 and IL-12 heterodimer were released in much higher amounts by streptococcal cells. Con A induced IL-3, IL-5, GM-CSF and IL-13 production in amounts comparable to those elicited by SPE A. The possible pathophysiological relevance of the elicitation by SPE A and streptococcal cells of these cytokines is discussed."

Hyperproduction of IgA and IgA1 in tonsils could be caused by activation of the Ig class switching recombination (CSR). αGLT (germline transcripts) plays a critical role in the initiation of switching from Cμ to Cα, resulting in production of IgA. Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) is a molecule essential for CSR and Ig gene conversion. The aim of this study was to investigate IgA and IgA1 levels in the supernatant of tonsillar mononuclear cells (TMCs) and the expression of Iα-Cα germline transcript and AID in TMCs stimulated with lipopolysaccharide or hemolytic streptococcus in IgAN patients and chronic tonsillitis patients."

CD010502,0,2014239,0,"Assembly and analysis of a functional vaccinia virus ""amplicon"" containing the C-repeat region from the M protein of Streptococcus pyogenes.","Previous studies have shown that when inoculated intranasally into mice, vaccinia virus (VV) recombinants expressing the carboxyl half of the Streptococcus pyogenes M protein [which contains the C-repeat region (CRR)] could elicit a protective immune response against subsequent challenge by both homologous and heterologous serotypes of pathogenic group A streptococci. In the present study, an insertion plasmid was constructed that contained three tandem in-frame repeats of a 310-base-pair DNA sequence encoding the CRR from streptococcal M6 protein under control of a constitutive viral promoter. The plasmid was used to introduce the bacterial sequences into the VV genome by homologous recombination. Surprisingly, the recombinant VV:CRR3X virus that was isolated appeared to represent not an individual recombinant virus but a complex mixture of variants that contained from 1 to greater than 20 tandem copies of the CRR region at the insertion site. This genomic complexity was mirrored at the transcriptional level in that a nested set of coterminal transcripts was detected in VV:CRR3X-infected cells, which increased in size from 1400 to 6600 bases by increments of approximately 300 bases. All transcripts containing two or more CRR inserts appeared functional, as Western (immuno) blot analyses of VV:CRR3X-infected cell extracts revealed a family of CRR-related proteins with apparent molecular masses that increased from 30 kDa upward in increments of 10 kDa. All data are consistent with the hypothesis that variation in the VV:CRR3X recombinants is from random crossover events that occur within the CRR region during viral DNA replication. These results suggest that the genomic diversity generated by the ""recombinogenic"" properties of vaccinia recombinants containing tandem foreign inserts could be used to facilitate induction of a broadly protective immune response against antigenically diverse pathogenic agents."

CD010502,0,8586164,0,Regulation of host cell recognition in Streptococcus pyogenes.,"Protein F, a fibronectin-binding protein, and the M protein of Streptococcus pyogenes both play important roles in directing adherence to different populations of host cells in the skin. Expression of both proteins is regulated in response to alterations in atmosphere. Transcriptional control of mry, a positive-acting regulator of expression of the gene which encodes the M protein (emm) in response, to elevated levels of CO2, is a mechanism for control of emm expression in response to atmosphere. Expression of protein F is controlled at the level of transcription in response to the concentration of O2, and its expression is stimulated in the presence of superoxide. Further support for a role of superoxide in regulation of prtF expression comes from the observation that an S. pyogenes mutant which contains an insertionally inactivated gene for superoxide dismutase (sod) becomes hypersensitive to superoxide and will express prtF constitutively. A second strain also demonstrates constitutive expression of prtF but contains a functional sod. Complementation analyses in this strain using a prtF allele cloned from a regulating host and a novel method for shuttle mutagenesis which utilized the transposon mini-gamma delta have been used to identify rofA, a positive-acting regulator of prtF expression. A model for the role of the surface proteins, F and M and their regulatory genes mry and rofA in streptococcal infections of the skin will be discussed."

Although there are differences in the organization of the virR regulon in OF+ and OF- strains, expression of these surface proteins is dependent on a VirR protein. In addition, it appears that production of OF is dependent on virR. The contribution of OF to the pathogenesis of S. pyogenes is unknown. The greater association of OF+ strains with impetigo compared to the greater association of OF- strains with pharyngitis [2] may indicate that production of apoproteinase is a contributing factor to skin infections."
CD010502,0,9271167,0,Human IgG binding ability of streptococcal M3 protein: its related complement activation-dependent M3 protein polymerization.,"We previously showed that M3 protein bound both fibrinogen and human serum albumin. Here, I report that M3 protein also has affinity for human immunoglobulin G. In contrast, M3 protein did not show affinity for polyclonal immunoglobulin G from other mammalian species (rabbit and goat). On the human immunoglobulin G molecule, the Fab domain was mainly responsible for the interaction with M3 protein, although the Fc region had a low degree of interaction with the M3 protein. Also, since the 35 kDa C-terminal fragment of M3 protein bound human immunoglobulin G, the binding site for human immunoglobulin G on M3 protein is present in this portion of the protein. The M3 protein-human immunoglobulin G complexes initiated complement activation via both classical and alternative pathways in normal human serum. When C3 was precipitated in the fluid phase with anti-C3 antibody and analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, M3 protein coprecipitated with the complexes and was polymerized. However, there was no polymerization of M3 protein when incubated with normal human serum treated with magnesium-ethyleneglycol-bis-(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid in the presence of M3 protein. Thus, this polymerization is mostly mediated via the classical activation pathway. It is probably helpful for the understanding of the antiphagocytic activity of M protein."

CD010502,0,1782325,0,Hybridomas to specific streptococcal antigen induce tissue pathology in vivo; autoimmune mechanisms for post-streptococcal sequelae.,"A gross examination of organs from approximately 100 mice which were producing ascites fluids toward a series of streptococcal reactive monoclonal hybridomas showed, in some animals, what appeared to be autoimmune-like findings. A pattern of major lung pathology was associated with specific clones. These specific hybridomas led to the development of an experimental autoimmune animal model mimicking a Goodpasture's syndrome. Tissue injury was induced in mice, on a dose dependent basis, by the injection of monoclonal antibody generated against streptococcal cell membrane (SCM) antigens. A more severe onset of the pathology, also on a dose dependent bases, was induced by placement of the anti-SCM mAb secreting hybridoma cells into the peritoneal cavity of the host. Severity of observed lesions was dependent upon the number of cells injected (10(5), 5 x 10(5), 10(6) or 10(7], as well as the animals' sex. Severe and total hemorrhagic lungs were seen in animals challenged with 1 x 10(6) hybridomas cells when sacrificed on the tenth day. In all cases the lesions were greater in the female litter mate than the male. Gross and histologic observations were confirmed by lung/body weight ratios. Pulmonary hemorrhage ranged from slight, when mAb was injected at a low dose of 24 micrograms/g, to severe when 96 micrograms/g was injected. Reported findings were based on the review of approximately 300 mice. Immunochemical evaluations and ELISAs confirmed the ability of these anti-SCM mAb to react with glomerular basement membrane (GBM) antigens as well as lung basement membrane (LBM). Mitogenic experiments indicated that the parent immunogen (SCM) used to generate immunocytes was non-stimulatory to lymphocytes."
CD010502,0,3302906,0,Detection of group A Streptococcus: comparison of solid and liquid culture media with and without selective antibiotics.,"Eight hundred thirty-seven consecutive throat cultures from pediatric patients were cultured comparatively on conventional sheep blood agar and selective agar containing 1.25 micrograms/ml trimethoprim and 23.75 micrograms/ml sulfamethoxazole.

The selective plates inhibited normal upper respiratory flora but not Strep-A. An incubation time of 18 hours was significantly better than one of 4 hours for the detection of Strep-A antigen in cultures incubated in Todd-Hewitt broth alone or Todd-Hewitt-sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim broth, resulting in a 24% increase in positives. These studies demonstrate that Strep-A detection in throat swab specimens, by either culture or antigen detection, will be influenced by the use of selective antibiotics and incubation time."

Cultures from blood and nasopharyngeal secretions were positive in 27/179 (15%) and 42/158 (27%) cases, respectively. Pneumococcal antigen was detected in 33/169 (20%) urine specimens. In sputum samples, culture was significantly positive in 19/128 (15%), whereas a significant concentration of DNA was found by RQ-PCR in 34/127 (27%) cases (P < 0.001). In 28/34 (82%) patients with RQ-PCR-positive sputum samples, S. pneumoniae was also detected with other methods. In the 34 RQ-PCR-positive sputum samples, 17 were negative by sputum culture, out of which 14 were obtained from patients treated with antibiotics prior to sampling.

CD010502,0,10660058,0,Genetic organisation of the M protein region in human isolates of group C and G streptococci: two types of multigene regulator-like (mgrC) regions.,"In addition to beta-haemolytic streptococci belonging to Lancefield group A (Streptococcus pyogenes, GAS), human isolates of group C (GCS) and group G (GGS) streptococci (S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis) have been implicated as causative agents in outbreaks of purulent pharyngitis, of wound infections and recently also of streptococcal toxic shock-like syndrome. Very little is known about the organisation of the genomic region in which the emm gene of GCS and GGS is located. We have investigated the genome sequences flanking the emm gene in GCS by sequencing neighbouring fragments obtained by inverse PCR. Our sequence data for GCS strains 25287 and H46A revealed two types of arrangement in the emm region, which differ significantly from the known types of mga regulon in GAS. We named this segment of the genome mgrC (for multigene regulon-like segment in group C streptococci). In strains belonging to the first mgrC type (prototype strain 25287) the emm gene is flanked up-stream by mgc, a gene that is 61% identical to the mga gene of GAS. A phylogenetic analysis of the deduced protein sequences showed that Mgc is related to Mga proteins of various types of GAS but forms a distinct cluster. Downstream of emm, the mgrC sequence region is bordered by rel. This gene encodes a protein that functions in the synthesis and degradation of guanosine 3',5' bipyrophosphate (ppGpp) during the stringent regulatory response to amino acid deprivation. In the second mgrC type (prototype strain H46A), the genes mgc and emm are arranged as in type 1. But an additional ORF (orf) is inserted in opposite orientation between emm and rel. This orf shows sequence homology to cpdB, which is present in various microorganisms and encodes 2',3' cyclo-nucleotide 2'-phosphodiesterase. PCR analysis showed that these two mgrC arrangements also exist in GGS. Our sequence and PCR data further showed that both types of mgrC region in GCS and GGS are linked via rel to the streptokinase region characterised recently in strain H46A. A gene encoding C5a peptidase, which is present at the 3' end of the mga regulon in GAS, was not found in the mgrC region identified in the GCS and GGS strains investigated here."
CD010502,0,8293585,0,Management of group B streptococcal disease in pregnancy.,"GBS is a bacterium that may cause devastating disease. The puzzle of GBS management revolves around the fact that the organism colonizes 15-30% of women, yet produces infection in only 1-3% of the women who are colonized. Neonatal infection is acquired from the maternal genital tract. It ascends across the cervix into the amniotic cavity and also may be acquired during delivery. Manifestations of disease in the fetus and neonate may be out of proportion to those in the mother. Treatment strategies involve the screening all pregnant women with cultures at 26-28 weeks' gestation and rapid tests at the time of labor. Rapid testing has not proven successful, although current research should provide effective and sensitive rapid tests by the end of the decade. Once a woman is known to be GBS positive in labor, there are two options. Most investigators recommend giving chemoprophylaxis only to women who are at high risk for GBS infection--women with preterm labor, ruptured membranes for longer than 12-18 hours, or intrapartum fever higher than 37.5 degrees C. Others advocate treating all GBS carriers regardless of risk status. Treatment of mothers in labor eradicates vaginal carriage of GBS, though it does not eradicate GBS from the lower digestive tract. Intrapartum chemoprophylaxis decreases the incidence of neonatal colonization and significantly decreases the risk of infant disease. In the future, GBS infection probably will be prevented with immunoprophylaxis and vaccination."

CD010502,0,16734128,0,Role of humoral immune response to group A streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins in rheumatic fever.,"Group A streptococci (GAS) are known to be responsible for a wide range of human diseases. GAS pathogenesis is caused by several virulence factors including several pyrogenic exotoxins (Spes) such as SpeA, SpeB, SpeF, and SpeC. Spes are members of the superantigen (SAg) family that induces massive secretion of inflammatory cytokines. So far no direct evidence-has been reported on the participation of GAS proteins in the pathogenesis of acute rheumatic fever (ARF). In the present study the presence of neutralizing antibodies and total ELISA anti Spes antibodies were determined in plasma of 45 ARF patients in order to clarify the role of GAS SpeA, SpeB, SpeC and SpeF in Egyptian ARF patients. No difference was recognized in the level of total ELISA anti-Spes antibodies between ARF patients and healthy controls. On the other hand, percent inhibition to SpeA, by neutralizing antibodies, was significantly higher in plasma of ARF patients with arthritis than with carditis, while no SpeA neutralizing antibodies were recognized in plasma of healthy controls. It is concluded that antibody response to GAS Spes seems to have no direct role in the pathogenesis of RF/RHD. However, detection of neutralizing antibodies might help in identifying the Spes causing RF in a specific population."

CD010502,0,2481235,0,Isolation and partial characterization of antigens from basement membranes and streptococcal cell membrane (SCM) employing anti-SCM monoclonal antibody.,"Monoclonal antibodies (mAb) against streptococcal cell membrane (SCM) antigen were used to identify specific cross-reactive peptides prepared by trypsin digestion of purified glomerular basement membrane (GBM) and lung basement membrane (LBM). Anti-SCM mAb-coupled HPLC columns were used to affinity isolate soluble LBM, GBM, and SCM antigens which then were sized by HPLC. Alternatively, SCM, GBM, and LBM digests were subjected to an initial separation by HPLC into component polypeptides, followed by affinity purification and ELISA of these fractions using anti-SCM mAb. Comparison of the antigenic reactivities by ELISA of the sized polypeptides on a nanomolar basis permitted the estimation of their individual relative epitope densities. The results for SCM antigens showed increasing epitope density with increasing molecular size, which suggests that intact SCM consists of repeating epitopes. Low mol. wt GBM polypeptides in nanogram amounts inhibited mAb binding to SCM, indicating that these small GBM polypeptides may similarly contain more than a single cross-reactive epitope. The identification of these cross-reactive epitopes in LBM and GBM has important implications for the etiology of post-streptococcal sequelae."

CD010502,0,1614331,0,Lipoteichoic acid and M protein: dual adhesins of group A streptococci.,"The roles of lipoteichoic acid (LTA) and M protein in the adherence of group A streptococci to human cells were investigated. Both M+ and M- streptococci bound to pharyngeal and buccal epithelial cells in similar numbers. Streptococcal attachment was inhibited by LTA, but not by the pepsin-extracted, amino-terminal half of M protein (pep M), suggesting that M protein does not mediate attachment to these cells. However, a purified, recombinant, intact M protein did block attachment of streptococci to buccal cells. Using synthetic peptides, the inhibitory domain was localized to a region of intact M protein that is within or near the bacterial cell wall. Evidence is presented to suggest that on the surface of streptococci this region of the M protein is probably not accessible for interactions with host cell receptors and that M protein does not mediate attachment to buccal or pharyngeal cells. In contrast, approximately 10-times more M+ streptococci bound to Hep-2 cells than did M- streptococci and pep M protein blocked binding of streptococci to Hep-2 cells. The data suggest that at least two streptococcal adhesins, LTA and M protein, are involved in the adherence of streptococci to certain cells and that the relative contributions of these adhesins to the attachment process depends on the type of host cells used to study adherence."

Previous studies demonstrated that SzP is similar to M protein of group A Streptococcus in the structure and characteristics of antiphagocytosis. The M protein is an adhesin that can bind to the host cells, however it is not known whether the SzP of S. zooepidemicus also functions as an adhesin.

CD010502,0,18320500,0,[Invasive streptococcal infections].,"The severity of streptococcal infections depends upon different virulence of individual strains of its causative agent. The most important species are beta-haemolytic group A streptococci (GAS). Clinical manifestations include skin affections, respiratory tract infections and, in particular, serious systemic invasive infections. The pathogenicity of GAS is derived from cell wall components and extracellular products, especially toxins with properties of the so-called superantigens. Less invasive forms of the disease are include necrotizing fasciitis, myositis, pneumonia, sepsis without focus, arthritis, meningitis, puerperal sepsis, streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS) and severe course of erysipelas and cellulitis with blood culture positive for GAS. In most cases, soft tissue infections dominate, often accompanied by chronic diseases of lower extremities in elderly patients. The other clinical forms are rather rare. In children, the condition is clearly frequently related to chickenpox. The generally accepted therapeutic management comprises comprehensive intensive care, early administration of penicillin in combination with clindamycin, and surgical intervention. The use of intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG), elimination methods and hyperbaric oxygen are under discussion. The slight increase in cases and ineffective prevention require rapid assessment of diagnosis and adequate treatment as a protracted course of the condition is connected with a high mortality rate."

CD010502,0,10832648,0,emm and sof gene sequence variation in relation to serological typing of opacity-factor-positive group A streptococci.,"Approximately 40-60% of group A streptococcal (GAS) isolates are capable of opacifying sera, due to the expression of the sof (serum opacity factor) gene. The emm (M protein gene) and sof 5' sequences were obtained from a diverse set of GAS reference strains and clinical isolates, and correlated with M serotyping and anti-opacity-factor testing results. Attempts to amplify sof from strains with M serotypes or emm types historically associated with the opacity-factor-negative phenotype were negative, except for emm12 strains, which were found to contain a highly conserved sof sequence. There was a strong correlation of certain M serotypes with specific emm sequences regardless of strain background, and likewise a strong association of specific anti-opacity-factor (AOF) types to sof gene sequence types. In several examples, M type identity, or partial identity shared between strains with differing emm types, was correlated with short, highly conserved 5' emm sequences likely to encode M-type-specific epitopes. Additionally, each of three pairs of historically distinct M type reference strains found to share the same 5' emm sequence, were also found to share M serotype specificity. Based upon sof sequence comparisons between strains of the same and of differing AOF types, an approximately 450 residue domain was determined likely to contain key epitopes required for AOF type specificity. Analysis of two Sof sequences that were not highly homologous, yet shared a common AOF type, further implicated a 107 aa portion of this 450-residue domain in putatively containing AOF-specific epitopes. Taken together, the serological data suggest that AOF-specific epitopes for all Sof proteins may reside within a region corresponding to this 107-residue sequence. The presence of specific, hypervariable emm/sof pairs within multiple isolates appears likely to be a reliable indicator of their overall genetic relatedness, and to be very useful for accurate subtyping of GAS isolates by an approach that has relevance to decades of past M-type-based epidemiological data."

Humoral and cell-mediated immune response to erythrogenic toxins.,"Infection of rabbits with erythrogenic toxin producing streptococcal strains caused a marked increase of humoral antibodies, which was detected by immunoprecipitation and ELISA. An antibody response directed towards the erythrogenic toxin type A was demonstrated by fused rocket immunoelectrophoresis. All toxinogenic reference strains produced ET type A under in vivo conditions despite that this toxin was not always demonstrated under in vitro conditions. The infection resulted in an increase of mitogenic response of peripheral lymphocytes to the initial nonspecific mitogenic erythrogenic toxins, whereas the Con A stimulation was depressed starting 14 days after infection and lasting during a period of 90 days. Since a normal antibody response was evoked, it seems likely that the T helper cell function was not affected."
CD010502,0,1401004,0,M protein gene typing of Streptococcus pyogenes by nonradioactively labeled oligonucleotide probes.,"A new approach for the typing of Streptococcus pyogenes is described. Oligonucleotide probes of 30 nucleotides in length were derived from currently known sequences of the N-terminal regions of M protein genes (emm genes). The oligonucleotides were labeled with digoxigenin-dUTP and hybridized to dot-blotted genomic DNA from 116 group A streptococcal strains of serotypes M-1, M-2, M-3, M-5, M-6, M-12, M-18, M-19, M-24, and M-49. Hybridization reactions were visualized with a chemiluminescent substrate. In comparison with conventional serological typing of expressed M proteins, the binding of the probes to the corresponding emm genes exhibited 100% sensitivity and specificity. The results emphasize the high degree of type-specific conservation of the N-terminal regions of emm genes from reference strains and epidemiologically unrelated U.S. and European clinical isolates. The existence of two distinct genetic subgroups among eight investigated M-49 strains was unequivocally shown by hybridization assays and further confirmed by nucleotide sequence data obtained from four selected M-49 strains. Because oligonucleotide probes are relatively easy to prepare, easy to handle, and known to give consistent interlaboratory results, the ""oligotyping"" technique appears to offer potential advantages over conventional serological typing methods."

Panning of the Tomlinson libraries I and J resulted in the isolation of nine distinct clones. Of the four clones which had full-length scFv, three contained stop codons. The remaining five clones were truncated, with four missing the heavy chain, and one missing most of the light chain. The full-length clones exhibited better binding to native C. parvum proteins and recombinant S16 than the truncated clones, with the exception of one truncated clone. None of the selected clones cross-reacted with Giardia lamblia, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus pyogenes, Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus or another immunogenic target of C. parvum, P23. Clones expressed as the soluble scFv-gIIIp construct were able to detect C. parvum native proteins and sporozoites.

CD010502,0,8515117,0,Superantigens associated with staphylococcal and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome are potent inducers of tumor necrosis factor-beta synthesis.,"The role of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha) in the pathogenesis of severe bacterial infections has been studied extensively. However, the role of TNF beta, a lymphokine with biologic activities similar to those of TNF alpha, has received little attention. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine the production of TNF beta by peripheral blood mononuclear cells in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and the superantigens staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 (TSST-1) and streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin A (SPEA). Though LPS was a more potent inducer of TNF alpha than was TSST-1 or SPEA, TSST-1 and SPEA were both more potent inducers of TNF beta. The superantigens TSST-1 and SPEA were more potent inducers of total TNF (TNF alpha and TNF beta) than was LPS. These data suggest that the induction of TNF beta synthesis may be a unique pathway by which superantigens associated with severe streptococcal and staphylococcal infections mediate shock and multiorgan failure characteristic of toxic shock syndrome."

The biochemical basis of lymphocyte stimulation by a type M5 protein polypeptide fragment (pep M5) was investigated. Optimal blastogenic doses of pep M5 or phytohemagglutinin stimulated the phosphorylation of several cellular proteins. However, pep M5 but not phytohemagglutinin induced the phosphorylation of 28- and 35-kDa proteins. The 28-kDa protein was shown to be phosphorylated only at serine residues, whereas the 35-kDa protein was phosphorylated only at tyrosine residues. Stimulation of peripheral blood lymphocytes with pep M5 caused a two-fold increase in the CD8+ and CD4+ 4B4+ subpopulations of T lymphocytes. The phosphorylation of the 28-kDa protein appeared to be confined to the CD4+ T cell subpopulation."
CD010502,0,17452467,0,Dynamics in prophage content of invasive and noninvasive M1 and M28 Streptococcus pyogenes isolates in The Netherlands from 1959 to 1996.,"Invasive group A streptococcal (GAS) disease re-emerged in The Netherlands in the late 1980s. To seek an explanation for this resurgence, the genetic compositions of 22 M1 and 19 M28 GAS strains isolated in The Netherlands between 1960s and the mid-1990s were analyzed by using a mixed-genome DNA microarray. During this four-decade period, M1 and especially M28 strains acquired prophages on at least eight occasions. All prophages carried a superantigen (speA2, speC, speK) or a streptodornase (sdaD2, sdn), both associated with invasive GAS disease. Invasive and noninvasive GAS strains did not differ in prophage acquisition, suggesting that there was an overall increase in the pathogenicity of M1 and M28 strains over the last four decades rather than emergence of hypervirulent subclones. The increased overall pathogenic potential may have contributed to the reemergence of invasive GAS disease in The Netherlands."
CD010502,0,9374163,0,Effect of radiotherapy on the levels of secretory immunoglobulin A against indigenous and virulent streptococci.,"It is well known that the frequency of upper respiratory infection is clinically increased after radiotherapy of the head and neck region. This study found higher antibacterial secretory immunoglobulin A (S-IgA) activity against three indigenous streptococci (Streptococcus mitis, S. salivarius, and S. sanguis I) and S. pneumoniae in patients who had undergone radiation therapy of the head and neck region than in control subjects. This showed no relation to the extent of the radiation field. Compared with before radiotherapy, the S-IgA titer against S. pneumoniae and its ratio to the activities against the indigenous streptococci were significantly higher in patients with fully irradiated major salivary glands. These results indicated that the radiotherapy promoted the antigen-specific S-IgA production of virulent streptococci in most patients with head and neck cancer, even more than 6 months after radiotherapy. The resulting altered balance in the S-IgA system of normal indigenous streptococci may also impair the ability to maintain the stable bacterial interference between normal indigenous and virulent streptococci in the oropharyngeal cavity."
CD010502,0,2446327,0,"Identification of a gene that regulates expression of M protein, the major virulence determinant of group A streptococci.","By using Tn916 insertional mutagenesis, we have identified mry (M protein RNA yield), a gene required for high-level expression of the M protein, an essential virulence determinant of the group A streptococcus. The mry::Tn916 mutation causes a reduction by a factor of approximately equal to 50 in the amount of M protein produced, in the original strain and in a nonmutagenized host to which the mutation was transferred by transduction. The insertion is located approximately 1.8 kilobases upstream of the structural gene for M protein (emm) and its promoter. The genomic region including mry::Tn916 and emm was cloned on a cosmid vector and introduced into Escherichia coli. When the transposon excised precisely from the chimeric cosmid in E. coli, the resulting streptococcal DNA showed the same restriction pattern as the homologous chromosomal region in the parental nonmutagenized streptococcus. The sequence of the promoter for emm was not altered in the mry mutant. The reduction in protein correlates with a decrease in the amount of M protein-specific mRNA, indicating that mry regulates transcription of emm."

In order to study the relationship between superantigen production, cytokine levels in patient sera, and clinical GAS manifestation we examined acute-phase sera and strains from 25 patients with GAS bacteremia. The patients had various disease manifestations, including STSS (44%), erysipelas (28%), septicemia (24%), wound infections (16%), and pneumonia (12%). Serotype T1M1 dominated, representing 56% of the isolates, but also strains of other serotypes were identified. The strains were found to produce the streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins (Spe) A, B, and F, as determined by immuno-blot analyses. There was no difference in amounts of toxin produced between strains isolated from patients with different manifestations of disease. Levels of TNF alpha, IL1 alpha, IL6, IL8, and IFN gamma in acute-phase sera were determined by use of ELISA and RIA assays. The analyses showed higher levels of IL6 in sera from patients with STSS than in sera from patients with bacteremia without shock. TNF alpha was elevated in sera from patients with STSS, as compared to sera from patients with uncomplicated pharyngotonsillitis. No increase in the levels of IL1 alpha, IL8, and IFN gamma could be found in the patient sera and there was no difference in the level of those cytokines between the various patient categories."

Age distribution in children and the relation to Kawasaki disease.,"We describe a new method to measure human serum antibody against streptococcal erythrogenic toxins that uses inhibition of lymphocyte mitogenicity of the toxins as the indicator. Sera from 53% of 53 Kawasaki disease patients contained specific inhibitory activity against A toxin, whereas only 15% had serum inhibitory activity against B toxin. The specific anti-A toxin serum inhibitor was found in 10% of 118 age-matched control patients suffering from various infections and allergic diseases (p = 0.001, compared to Kawasaki disease patients). Serum inhibitory activity was detected in a small number of patients with beta-hemolytic streptococcal infection (3/19) and in none of the age-matched healthy children (0/17). However, four of seven cord blood sera samples and five of 13 sera samples from healthy neonates contained the inhibitor, a result suggesting passive transfer from mothers. Most of the antimitogen-positive sera were also positive by ELISA of IgG antibody against A toxin, and IgG fractions of the positive sera remained positive in both assays. Thus, it is possible that the specific serum inhibitor detected by the antimitogen assay represents anti-A toxin antibody. The role of toxin-producing bacteria in the pathogenesis of Kawasaki disease remains to be investigated."

He had been diagnosed to have asymptomatic hematuria syndrome at the age of 6 during school screening. At 12 years of age, he was found to have macrohematuria and overt proteinuria with hypocomplementemia 2 months after streptococcal pharyngitis. Renal biopsy showed endocapillary proliferative glomerulonephritis with double contours of the glomerular basement membrane. Hypocomplementemia and proteinuria were sustained for over 8 weeks. He was suspected to have dense deposit disease due to intramembranous deposits in the first and the second biopsies. 1 month after treatment with methylprednisolone pulse therapy, proteinuria decreased to a normal level. Microscopic hematuria disappeared 2 years later, but mild hypocomplementemia persisted for more than 7 years. Nephritis-associated plasmin receptor (NAPlr), a nephritic antigen for acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis, was found to be positive in the glomeruli for more than 8 weeks. DDD is suggested to be caused by dysgeneration of the alternative pathway due to C3NeF and impaired Factor H activity. A persistent deposition of NAPlr might be one of the factors which lead to complement dysgeneration. A close relationship was suggested to exist between the streptococcal infection and dense deposit disease in this case."
CD010502,0,1401945,0,Use of defined oligosaccharide epitopes in an ELISA for group B streptococcus.,"A single-site ELISA for group B streptococcal polysaccharide based on a monoclonal antibody against an immunodominant trirhamnoside epitope was inhibited at high capture antibody coating densities. The inhibition was eliminated when less antibody was coated or when high antigen concentrations were tested. This antigen is polyvalent with respect to the terminal trirhamnoside epitope and therefore it appears that closely spaced capture antibodies bound the epitope completely, leaving no sites for attachment of the enzyme-labeled second antibody with the same specificity. To make use of the trirhamnoside epitope feasible, a two-site ELISA was evaluated with this monoclonal antibody and a polyclonal antibody isolated by affinity chromatography. ELISA inhibition studies using oligosaccharides derived from the group B polysaccharide were used to evaluate the specificity of the polyclonal antibody. This showed that the antibody recognized both alpha-L-rhamnose (1----3)-D-galactose and alpha-L-rhamnose(1----3)-D-glucitol side chains, which together represent 30 potential binding sites per antigen molecule. A two-site ELISA with the anti-trirhamnoside monoclonal antibody to capture the antigen and the polyclonal antibody as enzyme conjugated second antibody reacted with only group B streptococci when tested against a panel of bacteria representative of the vaginal flora and was able to detect 3 x 10(4) cfu/test of group B streptococci. This two-site ELISA, based on well defined oligosaccharide epitopes had the sensitivity and specificity necessary to identify women at risk of infecting their newborns with group B streptococcus."

To facilitate studies of this regulatory unit, we constructed a new shuttle vector with a staphylococcal chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) reporter box which replicates in S. pyogenes. We cloned polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-derived potential promoter regions of the virR, M protein (emm12), and ScpA (scpA) genes from an M type 12 S. pyogenes, strain CS24. Promoter activity was assessed by measurements of specific mRNAs, transacetylase activity, and minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for chloramphenicol resistance. We demonstrated that VirR is a necessary but not always sufficient positive trans-acting regulator of emm12 and scpA expression; however, virR is not autoregulated. A potential virR-binding consensus sequence is postulated for emm12, scpA and other M-like protein genes. Promoter activity of the structural genes was found to be dramatically influenced by growth conditions such as anaerobiosis. Levels of control, over and above the requirement for virR, are realized. The virR and scpA promoters were mapped for the first time using primer extension analysis. The observed mRNA start sites did not completely agree within the sequence predicted start sites. Data suggest that scpA could be subject to transcription attenuation."

CD010502,0,9370946,0,Expression of vascular endothelial growth factor in lymphomas and Castleman's disease.,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is one of the main angiogenic cytokines in human solid tumours and inhibition of VEGF-induced angiogenesis suppresses tumour growth. Some groups of malignant lymphoma, including peripheral T-cell lymphomas and Hodgkin's disease, are characterized by a conspicuous proliferation of small vessels. To test the hypothesis that VEGF may also be involved in the angiogenesis in lymphomas and other lesions of the lymphoid system, VEGF expression was analysed in tissues, employing in situ hybridization with a 35S-labelled RNA probe specific for this cytokine. Significant expression of VEGF transcripts was observed in Hodgkin's disease and peripheral T-cell lymphomas, particularly of the angioimmunoblastic type. In contrast, expression of this cytokine was minimal or absent in follicle centre lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia of B-cell type. VEGF was mainly observed in reactive non-lymphoid CD68-negative cells, which probably represent fibroblasts or myofibroblasts. In normal and ulcerated tonsils, VEGF was expressed in the squamous epithelium but only rarely found in the lymphoid tissue. Although infectious mononucleosis tonsils contained high numbers of VEGF-positive cells in the interfollicular zone, expression of this cytokine was not found in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-infected cells, as determined by simultaneous in situ hybridization for VEGF and EBV-encoded small nuclear RNAs (EBER). In 5/8 cases of Castleman's disease, germinal centres containing small vessels also showed expression of VEGF, in contrast to normal tonsillar germinal centres which are devoid of both vessels and VEGF transcripts. It is concluded that VEGF may be involved in the induction of the angiogenesis of both peripheral T-cell lymphomas and Hodgkin's disease, but not in low-grade B-cell lymphomas. In contradistinction to solid tumours, in which this cytokine is commonly secreted by the tumour cells themselves, in malignant lymphoma VEGF is not a product of neoplastic cells. Vascularization of germinal centres in Castleman's disease may also be a consequence of abnormal local expression of VEGF."
CD010502,0,9593131,0,Fosfomycin reduces CD15s-related antigen expression of Streptococcus pyogenes.,"We have previously shown the immunological mimicry of human sialyl-Lewis(x) (CD15s) by a surface antigen of Streptococcus pyogenes. This mimicking surface antigen may act as a ligand to the selectin family and may induce antibody production against CD15s on host cells, suggesting a possible role in the pathogenesis of S. pyogenes. In this study, the effects of antibiotics on the CD15s-related antigen expression of S. pyogenes were examined at a concentration below the MIC (sub-MIC). The amounts of CD15s on the surfaces of S. pyogenes cells and on the surfaces of S. pyogenes biofilms were determined by a whole-cell enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and by laser scanning fluorescence microscopy, respectively, by using an anti-CD15s monoclonal antibody. At the sub-MICs, fosfomycin (1R,2S-1,2-epoxypropyl phosphonic acid), its enantiomer (1S,2R-1,2-epoxypropyl phosphonic acid), and benzylpenicillin significantly inhibited the CD15s expression of all strains studied. The effects of fosfomycin and its enantiomer on biofilms were also observed by scanning electron microscopy. Incubation of S. pyogenes with the sub-MIC of fosfomycin or its enantiomer, which has no antibacterial activity, reduced the amount of CD15s on the biofilm surface and made it smooth.

To determine if these organisms have genes similar to the M protein genes of Streptococcus pyogenes (group A), DNA from independent group G isolates of human and animal origin were tested for homology to probes representing sequences encoding the carboxy-terminus and leader peptide of the type 12 M protein (M12) of group A streptococci. All eight human-associated group G strains tested had DNA homologous to the carboxy-terminal probe. Six of these strains also had DNA that hybridized with the leader peptide probe. Using probes representing the group A M12 gene (emm12) and adjacent 5' sequences, we found that one of these strains, known to produce an M12 antigen, had a nearly complete duplication of the group A emm12 gene, differing only in 0.26 kb of sequence at the 5' end. The other human-associated strains did not hybridize with emm12-specific sequences. None of the group G strains had homology to 5' proximal sequences thought to be associated with group A emm12 regulation, but all the human-associated strains had DNA homology to a 1.5 kb DNA segment which mapped 2.5 kb upstream of the emm12 gene in group A streptococci. None of the twelve animal-associated strains tested hybridized with any of the probes used in this study. These results suggest that human but not animal-associated group G isolates have group A-related M protein genes. We propose that expression of these genes are critical for infection of the human host and that group A and G shared upstream sequences could encode additional virulence factors."
CD010502,0,17305559,0,T cell response in rheumatic fever: crossreactivity between streptococcal M protein peptides and heart tissue proteins.,Molecular mimicry between streptococcal and human proteins has been proposed as the triggering factor leading to autoimmunity in rheumatic fever (RF) and rheumatic heart disease (RHD). In this review we focus on the studies on genetic susceptibility markers involved in the development of RF/RHD and molecular mimicry mediated by T cell responses of RHD patients against streptococcal antigens and human tissue proteins. We identified several M protein epitopes recognized by peripheral T cells of RF/RHD patients and by heart tissue infiltrating T cell clones of severe RHD patients. The regions of the M protein preferentially recognized by human T cells were also recognized by murine T cells. By analyzing the T cell receptor (TCR) we observed that some Vbeta families detected on the periphery were oligoclonal expanded in the heart lesions. These results allowed us to confirm the major role of T cells in the development of RHD lesions.
CD010502,0,7594672,0,The etiology of community-acquired pneumonia among hospitalized patients during a Chlamydia pneumoniae epidemic in Finland.,"The etiology of community-acquired pneumonia during a Chlamydia pneumoniae epidemic was studied among 125 hospitalized patients. Etiologic investigations included blood and sputum cultures, pneumococcal antigen detection, and serologic investigations for common respiratory viruses and for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Mycoplasma pneumococcal antigen detection, and serologic investigations for common and for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydia species. A specific microbial agent was identified in 110 patients (88%). Some 48% of the patients had mixed infections. S. pneumoniae was the most common pathogen (55%), followed by C. pneumoniae (43%). C. pneumoniae was found both as a single etiologic agent and as a mixed infection, most often with S. pneumoniae. In conclusion, S. pneumoniae is the most common cause of community-acquired pneumonia, even during a C. pneumoniae epidemic. The organism, alone or with other pathogens (especially S. pneumoniae), may cause community-acquired pneumonia that requires hospital treatment."

Bacteriological, vaginal and anal smears were taken from mothers at the beginning of parturition, as well as the amnion and the aspirated stomach contents of the newborn, employing, in each case, conventional culture methods and a latex agglutination test as a rapid testing method. Smears from the ears were also taken from the newborn for bacteriological examination. The vertical transmission and its possible influencing variables were examined in 1,328 mother/child pairs of the first observation year. Surface contamination of the newborn was confirmed in 10% in at least one smear. In the group of mothers with B streptococci colonisation, the amnion showed the highest rate of contamination (43%), followed by the aspirated stomach contents (26%) and the ear smears (taken from each side separately) with 28% and 30% respectively. Vertical transmission was decisively influenced by vaginal maternal colonisation (50% of the cases resulting in contamination of newborn), whereas anal colonisation, if it was the only site of colonisation, resulted in contamination of newborn in only 32% of the cases. The rate of contamination of newborn dropped significantly from 50% to 20% after intrapartal antibiotic prophylaxis, the latter appearing to be meaningful only after at least 6 hours of exposure. In this group, the surface contamination could be reduced from 61% to 8%. A group of newborn suffering from early onset of sepsis (0.4%), was compared with a group of 13 newborn at risk of infection (0.9%) with established surface contamination and clinical or laboratory chemistry confirmation of infection.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD010502,0,2807728,0,Influence of ions on cyclization of the amino terminal glutamine residues of tryptic peptides of streptococcal PepM49 protein. Resolution of cyclized peptides by HPLC and characterization by mass spectrometry.,"RPHPLC of the tryptic digest of lysine blocked group A streptococcal PepM49 protein (DHP-PepM49) consistently yielded, among others, two pairs of peptides which were well resolved, eluted in tandem, and had identical amino acid compositions. In each pair, the earlier eluting peptide was readily amenable to sequencing and yielded an amino-terminal glutamine whereas the later eluting peptide could not be sequenced. Mass spectral analysis revealed that each of these pairs of peptides differed in mass corresponding to the loss of ammonia. These data suggested that the later eluting peptide in each pair is a result of cyclization of the amino-terminal glutamine residue to pyroglutamic acid, which apparently leads to an increase in the hydrophobicity of the peptide. A kinetic analysis of the tryptic digestion of the DHP-PepM49 protein revealed that the cyclized form of the peptides were essentially absent during the initial time and increased with time of incubation, with a concomitant decrease in the uncyclized form. In 0.2 M ammonium bicarbonate at 37 degrees, nearly 44% conversion of the glutaminyl peptides to the pyroglutamyl peptides was observed in 24 h. This conversion was accelerated in sodium phosphate buffer relative to that in ammonium bicarbonate whereas it had a significantly lower rate in ammonium acetate buffer. The conversion was also temperature dependent, with essentially no cyclization at 0 degree, in all the three buffers. Thus, an extended digestion at 0 degree or a brief digestion at 37 degrees in ammonium acetate was found to be a suitable condition for limiting the cyclization of amino-terminal glutamine residues of PepM49 peptides.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Numbers of T gamma cells were similar in AGN and normal controls but were significantly lower (P less than 0.05) than those in skin-sore culture-positive streptococcal infection controls. Numbers of T mu cells were similar in AGN and normal controls but were lower (P less than 0.05) than those observed in streptococcal controls. Percentages of T mu cells were similar in AGN and normal controls but were lower (P less than 0.05) than those recorded in streptococcal infection control groups. Proportions of T cells were reduced during AGN (P less than 0.05). Lymphocytes capable of binding type 12 group A streptococcal membranes were increased (30.4%) in patients with AGN as compared to normal controls (4.1%). Subjects with streptococcal infection alone showed elevated but intermediate relative numbers (10.5%) of lymphocytes binding group A membranes. Increased relative numbers of both B and T lymphocytes binding group A streptococcal membranes were present in both AGN and non-nephritogenic streptococcal infection controls.

The Working Group for Group A Streptococci in Japan.","To clarify the relationship between the epidemics of severe invasive group A streptococcal infections (streptococcal Toxic Shock-Like Syndrome: TSLS) and common group A streptococcal infections in Japan, we examined the T serotypes of S. pyogenes strains (group A streptococci) isolated from clinical specimens of the streptococcal infections (17999 cases) in the period 1990-5, including the severe infections (TSLS) (29 cases) in the period 1992-5. Characteristic points of the analyses were: (1) dominant serotypes of the infections in these periods were T12, T4, T1, T28 and TB3264, which were consistently isolated; (2) isolates of T3 rapidly increased through 1990 to 1994 while T6 decreased in the period 1990-3; (3) when Japanese area was divided into three parts, T3 serotype tended to spread out from the north-eastern to the south-western area; (4) strains of T3 and T1 serotypes were dominant in the TSLS. Dominant-serotype strains of streptococcal infections did not always induce severe infections and dominance of T3 serotype in the TSLS seemed to be correlated with the increase of T3 in streptococcal infections. These results may indicate that certain clones of S. pyogenes are involved in the pathogenesis of the TSLS."
CD010502,0,15681141,0,Neutrophil and lymphocyte responses to oral Streptococcus in Adamantiades-Behçet's disease.,"Immune reactions against microorganisms play an important pathogenic role in Adamantiades-Behçet's disease. We had previously obtained Streptococcus sanguinis (strain BD113-20), isolated from the oral cavity of patients with Adamantiades-Behçet's syndrome. To investigate the pathogenesis of this isolate, we examined neutrophil reactions and levels of cytokine production by lymphocytes after stimulation with the strain. The reactions of neutrophils were examined by chemiluminescence assay using whole blood. The amounts of interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) and interleukin (IL)-4, IL-8, IL-10 and IL-12, produced by peripheral blood mononuclear cells, were measured by ELISA. Strain BD113-20 activated neutrophils from Adamantiades-Behçet's patients and healthy volunteers, and, in addition it increased the IFN-gamma production by lymphocytes. Lymphocytes from Adamantiades-Behçet's patients showed a dominant T helper-1 immune response. Results indicated that both bacterial stimulation and host hypersensitivity might be involved in the symptoms and pathogenesis of Adamantiades-Behçet's disease."

Previous work has shown that FH binds to group A streptococci and that the interaction does not interfere with the complement-inhibitory capacity of FH. In this work, we report a molecular analysis of this interaction. In absorption experiments with human plasma, M protein-expressing group A streptococci bound both FH and FH-like protein-1 (FHL-1), an active 42-kDa splice product of the FH-gene transcript comprising the first 7 of its 20 short consensus repeat (SCR) domains. rFHL-1 also bound to M protein-expressing streptococci, but rFH fragments containing SCR 1-5 or SCR 1-6 did not. rFHL-1 bound to purified M5 protein with an affinity that was higher than the value calculated for the interaction between FH and M5 protein. The binding of radiolabeled rFHL-1 to immobilized M5 was blocked completely by unlabeled rFHL-1, but was inhibited only partially by SCR 1-6, emphasizing the importance of SCR 7 for the interaction. In experiments with the FH-related proteins FHR-3 and FHR-4, only the former bound to M protein-expressing streptococci, again pointing to an involvement of SCR 7, since FHR-3, but not FHR-4, contains a domain that is similar to SCR 7. Finally, the interaction between rFHL-1 and purified M5 protein was inhibited by heparin, which binds FH via SCR 7. Together, these data indicate that the interaction between streptococcal M proteins and FH or FHL-1 requires SCR 7."

To assess the clinical utility of this test, we reviewed all LA tests performed over a 10-month period at two sites, a major university-based referral center and a private specialty pediatric hospital. Samples were assayed either individually or as a panel for the group B streptococcus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and three sets of Neisseria meningitidis serogroups (A and Y, C and W135, and B and Escherichia coli K1). Of 5,169 assays performed on 1,268 clinical samples (786 urine and 478 cerebrospinal fluid, 3 pleural fluid, and 1 synovial fluid sample), 57 (1.1%) were positive, including 1.7% of urine and 0.3% of cerebrospinal fluid samples. All LA true-positive cerebrospinal fluid samples showed the causative microorganisms by Gram stain. Detailed chart review of these 57 positive samples showed that the LA result was false-positive in 31 (54%), true-positive in 22 (38%), and indeterminate in 4 (7%) samples. Therapy was not altered on the basis of any of the true-positive LA results. The 31 false-positive results led to additional cost, prolonged hospitalization, and some clinical complications. Total patient charges were $175,000 ($7,954 per true-positive), with no detectable clinical benefit. Our retrospective study does not support the current use of LA for rapid antigen detection. What, if any, specific indications exist for this test remain to be elucidated."

Several respiratory specimens were obtained for the detection of Chlamydia pneumoniae by cell culture and PCR. Three serum samples were obtained from each patient. Serological diagnosis of a C. pneumoniae infection was determined by the microimmunofluorescence (MIF) test, the complement fixation (CF) test, and recombinant lipopolysaccharide (LPS) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; referred to as the rDNA LPS ELISA). Twenty-three patients (15%) had serological results compatible with acute C. pneumoniae infection; nine (39%) of these subjects were C. pneumoniae PCR positive. Twenty-two patients (14%) had positive PCR results without serological evidence of an acute C. pneumoniae infection. An attempt was made to calculate the sensitivities and specificities of the MIF test, rDNA LPS ELISA, and PCR for the diagnosis of chlamydial community-acquired pneumonia. Several ""gold standards"" were defined. Generally, the sensitivities of the rDNA LPS ELISA and MIF were comparable, while the sensitivity of the CF test was shown to be very low. Independent of the gold standard used, the best PCR results were obtained with nasopharyngeal specimens. However, the predictive value of a positive C. pneumoniae PCR result for patients with community-acquired pneumonia remains unknown and may be low. Although a widely accepted gold standard is still lacking, the rDNA LPS ELISA may currently be the preferred tool for diagnosing acute respiratory Chlamydia infections in routine clinical practice. However, the MIF test remains the method of choice for determining the prevalence of C. pneumoniae infections in a given community."

The virus strains were characterized by enzyme immunoassay, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and immunofluorescence procedures. During the first infection, 10 children had subgroup A strains and 3 had subgroup B strains. Of the 10 children with subgroup A strains during their first infection, 6 had subgroup B and 4 had subgroup A strains during the second infection. Of the three children with subgroup B strains during their first infection, one had subgroup A and two had subgroup B strains during their second infection. No child experienced unusually severe respiratory tract illnesses during second infections with respiratory syncytial virus. Fourfold or greater rises in serum antibody as determined by enzyme immunoassay were as common after the first infection as after the second infection among the seven children tested. Thus, second infections with strains of either subgroup of respiratory syncytial virus did not potentiate respiratory illness, and infection with subgroup A strains of respiratory syncytial virus provided some protection from a second infection with the homologous, but not the heterologous, subgroup of the virus."

The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of neutrophils and their secretion products in M1 protein-induced lung damage. The degranulation of neutrophils by M1 protein was studied in whole blood using marker analysis for individual granule subsets. In mice, M1 protein was injected intravenously and the lung damage was assessed by histology, electron microscopy, cell count in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and analysis of lung vascular permeability. Comparisons were made in mice with intact white blood count, neutropenic mice and neutropenic mice injected with the secretion of activated neutrophils. In whole blood, M1 protein forms complexes with fibrinogen that bind to beta(2)-integrins on the neutrophil surface, resulting in degranulation of all four subsets of neutrophil granules. Intravenous injection of M1 protein into mice induced neutrophil accumulation in the lung, increase in vascular permeability and acute lung damage. Depletion of neutrophils from the circulation completely abrogated lung injury and vascular leakage. Interestingly, the lung damage was restored by injecting neutrophil secretion. The present data suggest that neutrophil granule proteins are directly responsible for lung damage induced by the streptococcal M1 protein."

A complex picture is emerging in which host-pathogen crosstalk involves a high number of proteins, often with redundant functions. In the present study, we investigated the potential of protein microarrays to simultaneously scan interactions between surface proteins from two main human streptococcal pathogens, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae, and three human ligands, fibronectin, fibrinogen, and C4 binding protein, known to play an important role in streptococcal pathogenesis. By using this technology, we confirmed interactions described in the literature and detected a novel set of streptococcal proteins with binding capacities for the human ligands. The observations were validated by Western blot and ELISA techniques. Three of the newly identified proteins were isoforms of a group B streptococcus-secreted component named Fib and displayed differential binding capacities for fibronectin, fibrinogen, and C4BP. The protein regions involved in the interaction with each ligand were identified by constructing fragments of one of the Fib variants. The approach proved valuable for the acquisition of novel insights into the complex network of protein-protein interactions occurring during microbial infection."

In different strains of streptococci, there are over 80 serologically different M proteins and there are additional M-like proteins, some of which bind immunoglobulins. Although the sequence of the M molecules differs among different S. pyogenes strains, all M proteins, and some of the immunoglobulin-binding molecules, have at least two copies of the C repeat region. We describe construction of a deletion mutation in S. pyogenes, which has only one C repeat copy, and show that the mutant strain is still resistant to phagocytosis. The mutation was constructed in vitro and used to replace the resident emm allele in an S. pyogenes strain. To facilitate homologous recombination into the streptococcal chromosome, we adapted a shuttle vector which is temperature sensitive for replication in Gram-positive bacteria but not in Gram-negative hosts. This new method for delivery of a homologous DNA fragment to the S. pyogenes chromosome is efficient and reproducible and should be of general use."
CD010502,0,20375578,0,M1 protein allows Group A streptococcal survival in phagocyte extracellular traps through cathelicidin inhibition.,"M1 protein contributes to Group A Streptococcus (GAS) systemic virulence by interfering with phagocytosis and through proinflammatory activities when released from the cell surface. Here we identify a novel role of M1 protein in the stimulation of neutrophil and mast cell extracellular trap formation, yet also subsequent survival of the pathogen within these DNA-based innate defense structures. Targeted mutagenesis and heterologous expression studies demonstrate M1 protein promotes resistance to the human cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide LL-37, an important effector of bacterial killing within such phagocyte extracellular traps. Studies with purified recombinant protein fragments mapped the inhibition of cathelicidin killing to the M1 hypervariable N-terminal domain. A survey of GAS clinical isolates found that strains from patients with necrotizing fasciitis or toxic shock syndrome were significantly more likely to be resistant to cathelicidin than GAS M types not associated with invasive disease; M1 isolates were uniformly resistant. We conclude increased resistance to host cathelicidin and killing within phagocyte extracellular traps contribute to the propensity of M1 GAS strains to produce invasive infections."

The API system (bioMérieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France) was used as a comparator. Molecular methods (sequencing of 16S rRNA and zwf and gki genes and ddl gene amplification) were used to investigate discordant results. Upon resolution of discrepancies, correct species ID was achieved by the Phoenix system for 121/129 (93.8%) streptococci and 63/70 (90.0%) enterococci. Excellent results were obtained for S. pneumoniae (45/45) and beta-hemolytic streptococci (49/50). With regard to viridans streptococci, the accuracy of the Phoenix system was 83.9%. Among the latter organisms, the best performance was obtained with isolates of the Streptococcus sanguinis group and Streptococcus anginosus group; problems were instead encountered with the Streptococcus mitis group. Four E. faecium and three E. faecalis isolates were misidentified as Enterococcus casseliflavus/Enterococcus gallinarum or Enterococcus durans. Thus, these isolates were identified only at the genus level. Compared with commercially available systems, the Phoenix system appears a reliable diagnostic tool for identifying clinically relevant streptococci and enterococci. The SMIC/ID-2 panel proved particularly effective for beta-hemolytic streptococci and pneumococci."

CD010502,0,16687599,0,Identification of novel cps locus polymorphisms in nontypable group B Streptococcus.,"Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is an important pathogen responsible for a variety of diseases in newborns and the elderly. A clinical GBS isolate is considered nontypable (NT) when serological methods fail to identify it as one of nine known GBS serotypes. Eight clinical isolates (designated A1-A4, B1-B4) showed PFGE profiles similar to that of a GBS serotype V strain expressing R1, R4 surface proteins. These unique isolates were further characterized by immunologic and genetic methods. Rabbit sera to isolates A1 and A2 reacted weakly with concentrated HCl extracts of A1-A4 isolates, but not with those of B1-B4 isolates. In addition, a type V capsular polysaccharide (CPS) inhibition ELISA revealed that cell wall extracts from isolates A1-A4, but not from B1-B4, expressed low but measurable amounts of type V CPS. Molecular serotyping with PCR analysis showed that all eight isolates contained a type V-specific CPS gene (cpsO) and harboured the gene encoding the surface protein Alp3. Multilocus sequence typing identified isolate A1 as belonging to a new sequence type (ST) designated ST-173, whereas the other seven isolates keyed to ST-1. Sequencing of the 18 genes (17 736 bp) in the cps locus showed that each NT isolate harboured one to three unique polymorphisms, and also identified an IS1381 element in cpsE of the B4 isolate. Collectively, genetic and immunologic analyses revealed that these NT isolates expressing R1, R4 proteins have a genetic profile consistent with that of type V, an emergent, antigenically diverse and increasingly prevalent GBS serotype."

The surface M protein of GAS binds CD46 and mediates GAS adherence to keratinocytes. In the present study, we studied the role of CD46 in GAS invasion of human lung epithelial cells, A549. Anti-CD46 antibody which specifically blocks the domain to which M protein binds inhibited adherence to and invasion of A549 cells by GAS. Moreover, downregulation of CD46 expression on A549 by RNA interference resulted in reduced invasion of these cells by GAS. A mutant form of CD46 with a deletion in the cytoplasmic domain was overexpressed in A549 cells, which resulted in partial inhibition of invasion. This indicates that the cytoplasmic tail is required for CD46 to promote invasion by GAS. Invasion assays with Lactococcus lactis that express M protein demonstrated the dependence of CD46-promoted invasion on interaction with M protein. In addition, CD46-mediated invasion was also found to be dependent on the extracellular matrix protein fibronectin."

Early diagnosis permits patient education as well as treatment that may delay disease progression. Triple-combination antiretroviral therapy should be started immediately and continued indefinitely. Compliance with medication regimens is essential to maximize benefit and discourage the development of viral resistance."
CD010502,0,16325550,0,Lack of mitogenic activity of speG- and speG(dys)-positive Streptococcus dysgalactiae subspecies equisimilis isolates from patients with invasive infections.,"In recent years, Streptococcus dysgalactiae subspecies equisimilis has been isolated with an increasing frequency as the cause of invasive streptococcal diseases. For 46 S. dysgalactiae subspecies equisimilis isolates from invasive infections and four isolates from superficial infections, the presence of emm/emmL genes and of genes encoding various different streptococcal superantigens was determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Subsequently, PCR products were identified by DNA sequencing, and the expression of mRNA from superantigen genes was assessed by reverse transcriptase-PCR. The mitogenic activity of S. dysgalactiae subspecies equisimilis was assessed by [3H]thymidine incorporation into human lymphocytes and compared with that of Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus pyogenes. All S. dysgalactiae subspecies equisimilis isolates studied harbored an emm/emmL gene. Only in six of the S. dysgalactiae subspecies equisimilis isolates from invasive infections, speG was detected by PCR, two of which were further identified as speGdys by sequencing of the PCR product. None of the S. dysgalactiae subspecies equisimilis isolates harbored any of the genes speA, speB, speC, speF, speH, speI, speJ, speK, speL, speM, smeZ, or ssa of S. pyogenes. In contrast to S. pyogenes, no expression of speG or speGdys mRNA, respectively, was detected in the reverse transcriptase-PCR assay for any of the speG- or speGdys-positive S. dysgalactiae subspecies equisimilis isolates. Moreover, S. dysgalactiae subspecies equisimilis and S. agalactiae revealed no or very low mitogenic activity, while S. pyogenes was a very powerful inducer of proliferative responses. These findings support the hypothesis that the pathogenicity of S. dysgalactiae subspecies equisimilis may be associated in part with the presence of emm/emmL genes, and suggest that the severity of S. dysgalactiae subspecies equisimilis invasive infections is not mediated by superantigen-induced mitogenicity."
CD010502,0,12668143,0,Differential expression of the enolase gene under in vivo versus in vitro growth conditions of Aeromonas hydrophila.,"Aeromonas hydrophila is an emerging human pathogen that leads to gastroenteritis and other invasive diseases. By using a murine peritoneal culture (MPC) model, we identified via restriction fragment differential display PCR (RFDDPCR) five genes of A. hydrophila that were differentially expressed under in vivo versus in vitro growth conditions. The gene encoding enolase was among those five genes that were differentially up regulated. Enolase is a glycolytic enzyme and its surface expression was recently shown to be important in the pathogenesis of a gram-positive bacterium Streptococcus pyogenes. By Western blot analysis and Immunogold staining, we demonstrated secretion and surface expression of enolase in A. hydrophila. We also showed that the whole cells of A. hydrophila had strong enolase activity. Using an enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay and sandwich Western blot analysis, we demonstrated binding of enolase to human plasminogen, which is involved in the fibrinolytic system of the host. We cloned the A. hydrophila enolase gene, which exhibited 62% homology at the DNA level and 57% homology at the amino acid level when compared to S. pyogenes enolase. This is a first report describing the increased expression of enolase gene in vivo that could potentially contribute to the pathogenesis of A. hydrophila infections."
CD010502,0,9722711,0,"Helicobacter pylori: the mouth, stomach, and gut axis.","The aim of this study was to identify the natural reservoir and route of transmission of Helicobacter pylori infection. Two hundred eight (208) dyspeptic patients (114 males, 94 females; peak age of cohort, 50-59.9) were recruited. Specimens were collected from saliva, supra- and subgingival dental plaque, tongue scrapings, and oropharyngeal swabs. At subsequent endoscopy, gastric antral biopsy was performed for the rapid urease test (RUT), microbiological culture, and, in some patients, histology. Gastric juice samples were aspirated, and in 50 patients duodenal aspirate was collected. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with primers targeted to the 16S rRNA sequence of H. pylori was also employed for each of the specimens. In those patients where H. pylori was detected from multiple sites (dental plaque, gastric juice, gastric biopsy, and duodenal aspirate), restriction endonuclease digestion with Hae III was performed to determine if they were epidemiologically linked. The results indicated that 15/208 patients (7%) tested positively for H. pylori by PCR in dental plaque; only 2 samples were positive by culture. In none of the other oral sites sampled was H. pylori detected by any test used in the study. Gastric juice and gastric biopsy specimens from 36/ 208 patients (17%) and 114/208 patients (55%), respectively, were positive by PCR. Duodenal aspirate from 6/50 patients (12%) also tested positively by PCR. All specimens tested by restriction endonuclease digestion with Hae III (15/15 patients) were positive in both antral biopsy and gastric juice specimens, as well as 5 specimens from the duodenal aspirate. Four of the dental plaque strains had restriction patterns similar to those of the stomach and duodenal sites, providing evidence that these sites were infected with the same strain of H. pylori. In conclusion, the results suggest that H. pylori selects the gastric mucosa as its preferred site. The detection in dental plaque could indicate that the oral cavity may act as a reservoir or sanctuary for the organism. Whether H. pylori is a resident or transient oral microorganism is still unclear, although it is more likely to be transient in nature."

CD010502,0,3045713,0,Rapid detection of group A streptococcal antigen for the clinician and the epidemiologist: accurate? cost-effective? useful?,"Reviewing the literature describing rapid antigen detection for the diagnosis of group A streptococcal upper respiratory tract infections, one can conclude that the rapid aspect of these tests is clearly advantageous. To be able to have an answer in 5-20 minutes has distinct advantages with regard to therapy for patients. The specificity of most of these tests is acceptable for group A streptococci, although one must recognise that group C and group G streptococci can cause upper respiratory tract infection, and would not be detected by any group A antigen test. A remaining problem appears to be that of sensitivity. Although the range of sensitivity with various techniques and in the hands of different investigators may vary, it is difficult to ignore the fact that the sensitivity for many tests does not appear to be optimal. Furthermore, appropriate technical skill is required before these tests can be recommended for use in the hands of inadequately trained individuals, either in an office laboratory or in peripheral health care stations. There is also the concern that the cost for these diagnostic tests, unless purchased in large quantities, generally is greater than for the throat culture. This could have significant implications in some health care situations. One potential alternative for the office practitioner to consider is that if a rapid antigen test is negative, he or she should also perform a throat culture. This is the routine carried out in many practising clinicians' offices.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

CD010502,0,8686004,0,[Primary HIV infection].,"Up to 70% of individuals with primary HIV infection will develop symptoms of an acute illness. The most common symptoms reported are fever, generalized lymphadenopathy, arthralgia and myalgia, headache, pharyngitis, enanthema, skin rash, diarrhoea, and mucocutaneous ulcerations. More rarely, oesophageal candidiasis, meningoencephalitis, rhabdomyolysis and epiglottitis have been reported. The diagnosis of the acute HIV infection syndrome can be established by demonstrating antibodies to HIV or by demonstration of HIV antigen positivity. Detection of virus through culture or PCR may prove to be more sensitive, but are not yet used as routine methods. The course of the primary infection has prognostic importance for the subsequent course of HIV infection. This probably reflects the importance of both the viral phenotype and of the initial immune response to HIV. Primary HIV infection should be considered in any patient with possible exposure to HIV presenting with fever of unknown cause."
CD010502,0,10411737,0,"The R28 protein of Streptococcus pyogenes is related to several group B streptococcal surface proteins, confers protective immunity and promotes binding to human epithelial cells.","The R28 protein is a surface molecule expressed by some strains of Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococcus). Here, we present evidence that R28 may play an important role in virulence. Sequence analysis demonstrated that R28 has an extremely repetitive sequence and can be viewed as a chimera derived from the three surface proteins Rib, alpha and beta of the group B streptococcus (GBS). Thus, the gene encoding R28 may have originated in GBS. The R28 protein promotes adhesion to human epithelial cells, as shown by experiments with an R28-negative mutant and by the demonstration that antibodies to highly purified R28 inhibited adhesion. In a mouse model of lethal intraperitoneal S. pyogenes infection, antibodies to R28 conferred protective immunity. However, the virulence of an R28-negative mutant was similar to that of the parental strain in the intraperitoneal infection model. Together, these data indicate that R28 represents a novel type of adhesin expressed by S. pyogenes and that R28 may also act as a target for protective antibodies at later stages of an infection. We consider the hypothesis that R28 played a pathogenetic role in the well-known epidemics of childbed fever (puerperal fever), which were caused by S. pyogenes. A role for R28 in these epidemics is suggested by epidemiological data."

CD010502,0,15583289,0,Direct identification of gram-positive cocci from routine blood cultures by using AccuProbe tests.,"Rapid and reliable identification of bacteria directly from blood cultures is important in clinical practice to guide appropriate antibiotic therapy. In this study, the performance of the AccuProbe (Gen-Probe, Inc., San Diego, Calif.) in direct identification of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococci, and group A and B streptococci from positive blood culture bottles was evaluated by using 6-year routine clinical laboratory blood culture material from Paijat-Hame Central Hospital, Lahti, Finland. With the enterococcal and group A and B streptococcal probes, the diagnostic performance of the test was excellent at a cutoff value of 50,000 relative light units (RLU) as recommended by the manufacturer. However, with the S. aureus probe, although the specificity was very high (99.8%), the sensitivity was low (72.4%). To improve the clinical usability of the direct AccuProbe identification, optimal cutoff values for the individual AccuProbe tests were defined by using receiver-operating characteristic analysis. Consequently, cutoff values for S. aureus and S. pneumoniae tests were adjusted to 30,000 RLU and for enterococci and to 55,000 RLU for group A and B streptococci. With these adjustments, the performance of the AccuProbe tests, especially that for S. aureus, was significantly improved."
CD010502,0,7867308,0,Rapid detection of hyaluronic acid capsules on group A streptococci by buoyant density centrifugation.,"One of the virulence factors of group A streptococci is the hyaluronic acid polysaccharide capsule. A rapid method for ascertaining the status of the capsule phenotype in Streptococcus pyogenes is described. Bacteria with a capsule have a lower buoyant density than acapsular or hyaluronidase-treated cells. Early log phase cultures were underlaid with 65% Percoll and centrifuged at 500-1000 g for 5 min. Upon visual examination, encapsulated cells were observed at the interface, whereas acapsular cells appeared in the pellet. Cultures that produced at least 7 micrograms/ml of hyaluronic acid per A600 unit of cells were detected at the interface; this level of polysaccharide is only about 0.5%-4% of that found for most mucoid strains. Therefore, this procedure can detect capsules around strains that do not appear to be encapsulated by light microscopy or do not possess mucoid colony morphology. Furthermore, this method reduces dependence on other expensive assays that use labile radioactive reagents to detect hyaluronic acid."

Considering the preocupating increase of bacterial resistances and the disponibility of performane Group A Beta-Hemolytic Streptococcus Rapid Diagnostic Test (Negative Predictive Value above 95%), the new management strategy is proposed in two ways. Firstly, the free delivery of RDT to practitioners which was associated in Burgundy with a dramatic prescription decrease to 41% without benefice lost for patients. Considering these good results the French authorities decided the generalization of RDT use in 2002 and more than 15,000 practitioners have been concerned by the formations delivered in 3 months.

Comparison of DNA fingerprints proved to be a very useful tool for studying the epidemiology of isolates from various outbreaks of streptococcal disease. Patterns of DNA fragments from HindIII digests of samples of total DNA were conserved among strains of the same M serotype yet were easily distinguished from those of different M serotypes. Different M types were associated with specific restriction enzyme profiles. DNA fingerprints of strains of the same M type were stable enough to establish a clonal relationship between strains obtained from an isolated outbreak of disease or strains endogenous to people geographically isolated by continent. Strains of the same serotype from different continents had very similar, but distinguishable, restriction profiles. Those strains unable to be typed with standard typing sera were also amenable to comparison because they yielded unique fingerprints."

The ELISA was performed with gonococcal pili of a Rotterdam strain (1443) as antigen, the IHA with pilus antigen of an American strain (2686, Buchanan), and the GCFT with whole gonococci of a single strain (46695, Oliver) as antigen. The tests were performed on sera from the same groups of Dutch patients; samples of sera were taken at the first examination and generally 11-22 days later. The ELISA and the IHA were more sensitive than the GCFT. The specificity of the tests was equal in low-risk groups, but the GCFT was slightly more specific in high-risk groups. The ELISA and the IHA did not differ in sensitivity and specificity. The agreement between the ELISA and IHA for patients with uncomplicated gonorrhoea was low (chi = 0.44), but the agreement between the GCFT and the two pilus assays was less (chi = 0.26 and 0.20).

CD010502,0,10972839,0,Virulent aggregates of Streptococcus pyogenes are generated by homophilic protein-protein interactions.,"Many strains of the important human pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes form aggregates when grown in vitro in liquid medium. The present studies demonstrate that this property is crucial for the adherence, the resistance to phagocytosis and the virulence of S. pyogenes. A conserved sequence of 19 amino acid residues (designated AHP) was identified in surface proteins of common S. pyogenes serotypes. This sequence was found to promote bacterial aggregation through homophilic protein-protein interactions between AHP-containing surface proteins of neighbouring bacteria. A synthetic AHP peptide inhibited S. pyogenes aggregation, reduced the survival of S. pyogenes in human blood and attenuated its virulence in mice. In contrast, mutant bacteria devoid of surface proteins containing AHP-related sequences did not aggregate or adhere to epithelial cells. These bacteria are also rapidly killed in human blood and show reduced virulence in mice, underlining the pathogenic significance of the AHP sequence and S. pyogenes aggregation."

Although a throat culture was more specific (97%) than the EIA (89%), the sensitivity (87%) and negative predictive value (97%) of a single EIA was the same as that of a single throat culture. A follow-up throat culture was more accurate than a follow-up EIA. We conclude that the office EIA tested results in more false positives but misses no more true positives than a single throat culture processed by a well-controlled microbiology laboratory. If a follow-up technique is used for an initially negative EIA rapid streptococcal antigen detection test, the throat culture is the superior test and would be equally applicable following an initially negative throat culture or EIA."
CD010502,0,9129980,0,"Streptococcus pyogenes type 5 M protein is an antigen, not a superantigen, for human T cells.","M proteins are coiled-coil dimers expressed on group A streptococcal cell surfaces. They have an important role in host antistreptococcal immunity and in poststreptococcal autoimmune sequelae. Controversy has arisen regarding whether type 5 M proteins are superantigenic for human T cells. To investigate this, we have produced and tested M5 in the form of two novel recombinant proteins. We found no evidence of superantigenicity using either recombinant whole M5 protein (rM5) or recombinant pep M5 protein (rpepM5) to activate peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from healthy adult volunteers. Short-term, rM5-specific T-cell lines from different subjects were uniformly self-APC restricted and showed no consistent pattern of TCR V beta usage. A synthetic peptide of M5 residues 217-237 was found to contain epitope(s) recognized by some rM5-specific human T cells. PBMC responses to rM5 and rpepM5 in 3- and 7-day proliferation assays were characteristic of antigenic rather than superantigenic stimulation. We conclude that type 5 M protein activates human T cells as a conventional antigen."

G. Caparon and J. R. Scott, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 84:8677-8681, 1987). In the present work, we show that this insertion mutation, mry-1, is 244 bp upstream of an open reading frame encoding a protein we call Mry. This protein is visible on a gel after transcription and translation in vitro. We have developed a technique for complementation analysis in S. pyogenes and have used it to show that the wild-type mry gene is dominant to two mutant alleles. This dominance indicates that Mry acts in trans as a positive regulator of the emm6 gene. The translated DNA sequence of mry has two regions of similarity to the motif common to the receptor protein of two-component regulatory systems. In addition, the N terminus of Mry has two regions resembling a helix-turn-helix motif. Mry does not appear to be a global regulator of virulence determinants in the group A streptococcus because there is no effect of the mry-1 mutation on production of the hyaluronic acid capsule or streptokinase."
CD010502,0,11454069,0,Streptococcal inhibitor of complement (SIC) inhibits the membrane attack complex by preventing uptake of C567 onto cell membranes.,"Streptococcal inhibitor of complement (SIC) was first described in 1996 as a putative inhibitor of the membrane attack complex of complement (MAC). SIC is a 31 000 MW protein secreted in large quantities by the virulent Streptococcus pyogenes strains M1 and M57, and is encoded by a gene which is extremely variable. In order to study further the interactions of SIC with the MAC, we have made a recombinant form of SIC (rSIC) in Escherichia coli and purified native M1 SIC which was used to raise a polyclonal antibody. SIC prevented reactive lysis of guinea pig erythrocytes by the MAC at a stage prior to C5b67 complexes binding to cell membranes, presumably by blocking the transiently expressed membrane insertion site on C7. The ability of SIC and clusterin (another putative fluid phase complement inhibitor) to inhibit complement lysis was compared, and found to be equally efficient. In parallel, by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay both SIC and rSIC bound strongly to C5b67 and C5b678 complexes and to a lesser extent C5b-9, but only weakly to individual complement components. The implications of these data for virulence of SIC-positive streptococci are discussed, in light of the fact that Gram-positive organisms are already protected against complement lysis by the presence of their peptidoglycan cell walls. We speculate that MAC inhibition may not be the sole function of SIC."
CD010502,0,17375516,0,Erythema nodosum: a sign of systemic disease.,"Erythema nodosum, a painful disorder of the subcutaneous fat, is the most common type of panniculitis. Generally, it is idiopathic, although the most common identifiable cause is streptococcal pharyngitis. Erythema nodosum may be the first sign of a systemic disease such as tuberculosis, bacterial or deep fungal infection, sarcoidosis, inflammatory bowel disease, or cancer. Certain drugs, including oral contraceptives and some antibiotics, also may be etiologic. The hallmark of erythema nodosum is tender, erythematous, subcutaneous nodules that typically are located symmetrically on the anterior surface of the lower extremities. Erythema nodosum does not ulcerate and usually resolves without atrophy or scarring. Most direct and indirect evidence supports the involvement of a type IV delayed hypersensitivity response to numerous antigens. A deep incisional or excisional biopsy specimen should be obtained for adequate visualization. Erythema nodosum represents an inflammatory process involving the septa between subcutaneous fat lobules, with an absence of vasculitis and the presence of radial granulomas. Diagnostic evaluation after comprehensive history and physical examination includes complete blood count with differential; erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein level, or both; testing for streptococcal infection (i.e., throat culture, rapid antigen test, antistreptoly-sin-O titer, and polymerase chain reaction assay); and biopsy. Patients should be stratified by risk for tuberculosis. Further evaluation (e.g., purified protein derivative test, chest radiography, stool cultures) varies based on the individual. Erythema nodosum tends to be self-limited. Any underlying disorders should be treated and supportive care provided. Pain can be managed with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs."
CD010502,0,12603711,0,Relationship between group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis and asthma.,"Increasing morbidity due to asthma in children and antimicrobial resistance among human pathogens are both major public-health concerns. Frequent use of antibiotics during childhood might be a factor underlying the rising severity and prevalence of asthma and other allergic disorders. The objective of the study was to determine if pediatric patients with asthma or allergic rhinitis have an altered rate of group A beta hemolytic streptococcal (GABHS) tonsillopharyngeal infection which might support any change in guidelines for antibiotic prescription. A prospective analysis of all patients presenting a clinical feature of GABHS pharyngitis with a sore throat in two pediatric clinics located in Detroit, MI, USA and San Antonio de Areco, Buenos Aires, Argentina. Eligible patients aged between 2 and 18 years were screened for the presence of asthma and/or allergic rhinitis and administered a test (rapid strep test) and throat culture to determine GABHS infection. At the Redford Medical Center, Detroit, 500 patients met the eligibility criteria, with 168 (33.6%) having a positive strep test. At the San Antonio de Areco's Hospital, in a rural area 100 km away from Buenos Aires, 188 patients met the eligibility criteria, with 41 (21.8%) having a positive strep test or GABHS throat cultures. In both the Detroit [odds ratio (OR) = 1.36; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72-2.57] and Buenos Aires clinics (OR = 0.50; 95% CI 0.23-1.07), patients with asthma or allergic rhinitis were not at an increased risk for true GABHS tonsillopharyngeal infections when compared with the general pediatric population. These results suggest that children with asthma do not differ from the normal population in their risk of developing GABHS tonsillopharyngeal infection and should not be liberally prescribed antibiotics."

CD010502,0,10699034,0,Epidemiological analysis of non-M-typeable group A Streptococcus isolates from a Thai population in northern Thailand.,"Infection with group A streptococci (GAS) can lead to the development of severe postinfectious sequelae such as rheumatic fever (RF). In Thailand, RF and rheumatic heart disease (RHD) remain important health problems. More than 80% of GAS circulating in this population are non-M antigen typeable by conventional M serotyping methods. In this study, we determine the M protein sequence types of GAS isolates found in northern Thailand. The emm genes from 53 GAS isolates, collected between 1985 and 1995 from individuals with pharyngitis, impetigo, acute RF (ARF), RHD, or meningitis as well as from individuals without infections, were amplified by PCR and sequenced. Thirteen new sequence types that did not show homology to previously published sequences were characterized. Six of these sequence types could be isolated from both skin and throat sites of impetigo and pharyngitis/ARF patients, respectively. In many cases we could not specifically differentiate skin strains or throat strains that could be associated with ARF or acute glomerulonephritis. Antigenic variations in the emm gene of the isolates investigated, compared to published M protein sequences, were predominantly due to point mutations, small deletions, and insertions in the hypervariable region. One group of isolates with homology to M44 exhibited corrected frameshift mutations. A new M type isolated from an RHD patient exhibited nucleotide sequence corresponding to the N terminus of M58 and the C terminus of M25, suggesting that recombination between the two types may have occurred. This study provided epidemiological data relating to GAS endemic to northern Thailand which could be useful for identification of vaccine candidates in a specific region of endemicity."

The LeapStrep (Organon Teknika, Malvern, Pa.) and Check-Spectra (Diagnostic Technology, Hauppauge, N.Y.) tests had low sensitivities for detecting ASO (35.3 and 21.4%, respectively) and ADB (22.2 and 33.3%, respectively)."
CD010502,0,19951329,0,Methods for screening for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus carriage.,"Screening patients for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) carriage at hospital admission is widely accepted as an essential part of MRSA control programmes. It is assumed, although not proven, that rapid reporting of screening results will improve MRSA control, provided that a clear action plan for positive cases is in place and is being followed. An effective culture screening method is direct inoculation of pooled nose, throat and perineal swabs on a well-performing MRSA-selective chromogenic agar; presumptive MRSA colonies can be confirmed rapidly by latex agglutination with antibodies directed against penicillin-binding protein 2a. This method will usually produce a positive result after 24 h of incubation in >95% of true-positive cases, and will be sufficient for most initial treatment and infection control decisions; full antimicrobial susceptibilities will be available on the next day. Inoculation of selective enrichment broth containing a colorimetric growth indicator is an alternative overnight culture method, but there may be problems with overgrowth of other organisms, such as enterococci. PCR methods are now available that can produce same-day results, provided that samples reach the laboratory in time for batch processing, but cultures are required for susceptibility testing. In comparison with culture-based methods, PCR tests are costly, and some have relatively high false-positivity rates; definitive evidence of their clinical cost-effectiveness is lacking. New point-of-care PCR tests are being introduced that are potentially even more rapid but are even more expensive; studies on the clinical cost-effectiveness of these very rapid tests are awaited."
CD010502,0,20675378,0,An engineered alpha1 integrin-binding collagenous sequence.,"Collagen is an extracellular matrix structural component that can regulate cellular processes through its interaction with the integrins, α1β1, α2β1, α10β1, and α11β1. Collagen-like proteins have been identified in a number of bacterial species. Here, we used Scl2 from Streptococcus pyogenes serotype M28 strain MGAS6274 as a backbone for the introduction of discrete integrin-binding sequences. The introduced sequences GLPGER, GFPGER, or GFPGEN did not affect triple helix stability of the Scl (Streptococcal collagen-like) protein. Using ELISA and surface plasmon resonance, we determined that Scl2(GLPGER) and Scl2(GFPGER) bound to recombinant human α1 and α2 I-domains in a metal ion-dependent manner and without a requirement for hydroxyproline. We predicted a novel and selective integrin-binding sequence, GFPGEN, through the use of computer modeling and demonstrated that Scl2(GFPGEN) shows specificity toward the α1 I-domain and does not bind the α2 I-domain. Using C2C12 cells, we determined that intact integrins interact with the modified Scl2 proteins with the same selectivity as recombinant I-domains. These modified Scl2 proteins also acted as cell attachment substrates for fibroblast, endothelial, and smooth muscle cells. However, the modified Scl2 proteins were unable to aggregate platelets. These results indicate that Scl2 is a suitable backbone for the introduction of mammalian integrin-binding sequences, and these sequences may be manipulated to individually target α1β1 and α2β1."

CD010502,0,20146737,0,Epidemiology of invasive Streptococcus pyogenes disease in Germany during 2003-2007.,"A nationwide laboratory-based surveillance study of invasive Streptococcus pyogenes infections was conducted in Germany. Invasive isolates (n=586) were obtained between 2003 and 2007. Most isolates were obtained from blood (53.9%) or skin lesions (17.6%). The most common emm types were emm 1 (30.5%), emm 28 (18.3%) and emm 3 (9.6%). Overall, speA was positive in 45.9%, speC in 44.7% and ssa in 14.8% of isolates. SpeA was common in emm type 1 (100%) and emm type 3 (96.4%), whereas speC was often observed in emm type 28 (93.5%). The most frequent clinical manifestations included sepsis (40.1%), necrotizing fasciitis (20.8%) and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (16.6%). All isolates were susceptible to penicillin G, cefotaxime and levofloxacin. Tetracycline shows the highest rate of resistant or intermediate isolates with 11.6%, followed by clarithromycin (5.5%) and clindamycin (1.2%). The most prominent trend is the reduction of tetracycline-nonsusceptible isolates from 18.6% in 2003 to 8.9% in 2007."

The present authors hypothesised that CS would reduce cellular proliferation and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in a tonsil/adenoid mixed-cell culture system. Dissociated tonsils or adenoids harvested intra-operatively from children with polysomnographically diagnosed OSA were cultured in control medium (CO) or after stimulation with lipopolysaccharide and concanavalin A (STIM), and incubated with dexamethasone (DEX; 10(-5)-10(-7) M), fluticasone (FLU; 10(-5)-10(-14) M) and budesonide (BUD; 10(-4)-10(-14) M). Proliferation and apoptosis were assessed, and supernatants were assayed for the cytokines tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8. STIM increased tonsillar and adenoidal proliferation compared with CO (1,976+/-133 versus 404+/-69 counts min(-1); n = 54). DEX, FLU and BUD reduced cellular proliferation rates, and exhibited dose-dependent effects, with the potency being FLU>BUD>DEX (n = 25 per group). Conversely, CS increased cellular apoptosis (n = 20 per group). Furthermore, TNF-alpha, IL-8 and IL-6 concentrations in the supernatant were increased by STIM, and markedly reduced by all CS (n = 48 per group). Whole tissue cell cultures of adenoids and tonsils provide a useful approach for in vitro assessment of therapeutic efficacy of corticosteroids in the management of lymphadenoid hypertrophy that underlies obstructive sleep apnoea in children."

The first part of the investigation was a double-blind placebo-controlled study of 12 healthy volunteers; counts of cells containing immunoglobulins and cells producing specific antibodies were higher in the individuals given the oral ribosomal vaccine than in the placebo-treated controls. In the second part of the investigation, analysis of the kinetics of apparition of the immunoglobulin-containing and specific antibody-producing cells suggested prompt stimulation of Peyer patch B lymphocytes following ingestion of the vaccine. Lastly, a study of 5 children given the vaccine on a long-term basis demonstrated increased counts of both above-described cell types after one month treatment."

CD010502,0,7734189,0,"Markers of foamy virus infections in monkeys, apes, and accidentally infected humans: appropriate testing fails to confirm suspected foamy virus prevalence in humans.","Foamy viruses (FVs) persist in healthy individuals of various mammalian species, including nonhuman primates. Laboratory markers of FV infection are (1) virus in throat epithelium or peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs), (2) proviral DNA sequences in PBLs and various solid organs, and (3) antibodies reactive to viral antigens on Western blots, in radioimmunoprecipitation tests, and in immunofluorescence assays. Using PCR and serological tests, we readily detected FV markers in naturally infected African green monkeys, rhesus monkeys, and chimpanzees, as well as in accidentally infected humans. Transmission of simian foamy viruses to humans (by bite or inadvertent laboratory infection) leads to viral markers, without affecting the recipient. Reports on FV-associated clinical disorders (e.g., thyroid or neurological) have remained controversial. In this study we failed to detect, by PCR, viral sequences in the samples from 223 patients, including 16 HIV-infected Africans, 46 Graves' disease patients, and 28 patients with the de Quervain's thyroiditis. Evaluation of 2688 sera from suspected high-risk areas (e.g., Central and East Africa, or high-risk groups such as HIV-infected individuals and patients with AIDS, thyroid, and neurological disorders) did not reveal FV-specific antibodies in a single case. Previously reported FV seroprevalence in various populations has never been verified by appropriate confirmatory tests. The strain of ""human foamy virus"" has remained a unique isolate. In conclusion, FVs are unlikely--at present--to circulate in human populations."
CD010502,0,12232470,0,Effect of tonsillectomy on serum concentrations of interleukins and TNF-alpha in patients with chronic tonsillitis.,"We investigated serum interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha levels in 17 children aged 5-12 years (mean 7) with chronic tonsillitis before and after tonsillectomy. Cytokine concentrations were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. IL-1beta and IL-6 levels were significantly higher than the control levels (p < 0.05) in preoperative serum samples. Other cytokine levels were within normal limits. After tonsillectomy, IL-1beta and IL-6 levels were significantly reduced (p < 0.05). It is suggested that IL-1beta and IL-6 may be mediators which have a role in chronic tonsillitis disease and that tonsillectomy has a significant effect on preoperative IL-1beta and IL-6 serum levels."
CD010502,0,16980693,0,"Streptococcal mitogenic exotoxin, SmeZ, is the most susceptible M1T1 streptococcal superantigen to degradation by the streptococcal cysteine protease, SpeB.","Superantigens (SAgs) play an important role in the pathogenesis of severe invasive infections caused by Group A Streptococcus (GAS). We had shown earlier that the expression of streptococcal cysteine protease SpeB results in partial loss of the immune-stimulating activity of the native secreted GAS SAgs, namely the streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins produced by the globally disseminated M1T1 GAS strain, associated with invasive infections worldwide. In this study, we examined the susceptibility of each of the M1T1 recombinant SAgs to degradation by rSpeB. Whereas SmeZ was degraded completely within 30 min of incubation with rSpeB, SpeG, and SpeA were more resistant and SpeJ was completely unaffected by the proteolytic effects of this protease. Proteomic analyses demonstrated that the order of susceptibility of the M1T1 SAgs to SpeB proteolysis is unaltered when they are present in a mixture that reflects their native physiological status. As expected, the degradation of SmeZ abolished its immune stimulatory activity. In silico sequence disorder and structural analyses revealed that SmeZ, unlike the three other structurally related SAgs, possesses a putative SpeB cleavage site within an area of the protein likely to be exposed to the surface. The study provides evidence for the effect of subtle structural differences between highly similar SAgs on their biological activity."

The majority (61.2%) were under 2 years of age. The focus of infection was pneumonia, pharyngitis or undetermined in 28.6%, 18.4% and 20.4%, respectively. Diseases that had probably predisposed them to pneumococcal bacteraemia (mainly nephrotic syndrome) were encountered in 24.5% of cases. Forty-five per cent of the cases occurred during the summer season and in 29% the disease was nosocomially acquired. No death was recorded in this series and the reasons for this are discussed. Detection of pneumococcal antigens from blood taken for culture was successful in 96% of cases; this test is important in the diagnosis of pneumococcal bacteraemia in partially treated patients. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing showed 20.4% of the isolates to be relatively penicillin-resistant. Resistance to other antimicrobial agents was also recorded and multiple resistance was noted in 22% of isolates. There was a significant difference between the ceftriaxone MIC of the relatively penicillin-resistant strains compared with penicillin-sensitive strains.

Culture supernatants of tonsillar lymphocytes in RT group had antibodies to respiratory syncytial (RS) virus at greater positive rate (26.3%) than that of SHT group (16.7%). About 70% of patients with RT had serum antibodies to viral capsid antigen (VCA) of EBV in high titre over 160X, but only 30% in SHT group. Furthermore, in RT group 2 patients possessed IgM antibody to VCA and IgG antibody to early antigen (EA). In RT group, IgG, IgM and IgA antibodies to VCA and IgG antibody to EA presented in the supernatant in 58%, 17.6%, 11.7% and 17.6% respectively. In the 35 tonsillar lymphocyte suspensions tested 20% contained EBNA-positive lymphocytes. In RT group, 5 of 21 patients (23.8%) had EBNA-positive lymphocytes, but only one of 9 (14.3%) in SHT group. These results suggest that EBV infection and its reactivation in the palatine tonsil may be one of major mechanisms in recurrent episodes of tonsillitis."

CD010502,0,2579187,0,Location of variable and conserved epitopes among the multiple serotypes of streptococcal M protein.,"In studies primarily confined to the amino-terminal region of the fibrillar group A streptococcal M protein, only limited immunological crossreactions have been observed among M serotypes. In this investigation, two monoclonal antibodies generated against nearly the entire M6 molecule (LysM6) were used to determine the extent of crossreactions among M serotyping strains and to localize their epitopes on the M molecule. Colony blot and immunoblot analyses revealed that an epitope responsible for crossreactions among 5 of the 56 strains of different M serotypes tested is located in the amino-terminal half of the molecule, distal to the cell surface. In contrast, a more common crossreactive epitope, reacting with 20 of the 56 strains, is located near the middle of the M molecule. These studies also reveal that the more conserved determinant, located more proximally to the cell surface, is accessible to the immune system, even on the whole organism, and, thus, may be useful in devising means to protect against infections by multiple group A streptococcal M serotypes."
CD010502,0,17634303,0,"Molecular epidemiology and distribution of serotypes, surface proteins, and antibiotic resistance among group B streptococci in Italy.","Group B streptococci (GBS) comprising three different sets of isolates (31 invasive, 36 noninvasive, and 24 colonizing isolates) were collected in Italy during the years 2002 to 2005. Clonal groups were established by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), and selected isolates were studied by multilocus sequence typing (MLST). GBS isolates were also characterized by classical and molecular techniques for serotyping and protein gene and antibiotic resistance profiling. Some serotypes were significantly associated with a particular isolate population: serotype Ia more frequently corresponded to invasive strains than other strains, serotype V was more frequently encountered among noninvasive strains, and nontypeable strains were more common among isolates from carriers. Four major clonal groups accounted for 52.7% of all isolates: PFGE type 1/clonal complex 1 (CC1) comprised mainly serotype V isolates carrying the alp3 gene, PFGE type 2/CC23 encompassed serotype Ia isolates with the alp1 or alpha gene, PFGE type 3/CC17 comprised serotype III isolates carrying the rib gene, and PFGE type 4/CC19 consisted mainly of serotype II isolates possessing the rib gene. The same serotypes were shared by isolates of different clonal groups, and conversely, isolates belonging to the same clonal groups were found to be of different serotypes, presumably due to capsular switching by the horizontal transfer of capsular genes. Erythromycin resistance (prevalence, 16.5%; 15 resistant isolates of 91) was restricted to strains isolated from patients with noninvasive infections and carriers, while tetracycline resistance was evenly distributed (prevalence, 68.1%; 62 resistant isolates of 91). Most erythromycin-resistant GBS strains were of serotype V, were erm(B) positive, and belonged to the PFGE type 1/CC1 group, suggesting that macrolide resistance may have arisen both by clonal dissemination and by the horizontal transfer of resistance genes."
CD010502,0,2579184,0,Human immune response to group A streptococcal carbohydrate (A-CHO). I. Quantitative and qualitative analysis of the A-CHO-specific B cell population responding in vitro to polyclonal and specific activation.,"The immune response to the group-specific carbohydrate of group A streptococci (A-CHO) provides an informative in vitro model for the investigation of several aspects of human anticarbohydrate immune responses. A-CHO-specific B cells can be polyclonally activated by pokeweed mitogen (PWM), and, specifically, by in vitro immunization with streptococcal vaccine. High levels of A-CHO-specific antibodies, mainly directed to the immunodominant side chain N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc), occur in healthy adult individuals. Serum antibody levels are reflected in high frequencies of precursor B cells among peripheral blood lymphocytes. In one particular case, greater than 15% of all B cells activated by PWM for IgM production were found to produce IgM anti-A-CHO antibodies, as determined in limiting dilution experiments, as well as by analyzing Ig concentrations in bulk culture experiments. The case with the lowest proportion observed had 0.3% A-CHO-specific B cells among IgM-producing B cells. Preferential PWM activation of anti-A-CHO-producing B cells could be excluded. The comparison of the proportions of anti-A-CHO IgM produced in vivo, and of B cells producing antibodies of this specificity in peripheral blood, suggests a similar distribution of specific precursor B cells in the antibody-producing lymphoid tissue compartments and in peripheral blood. However, nearly all specific antibodies produced in vitro belong to the IgM isotype, whereas IgG anti-A-CHO in high amounts, mostly exceeding the specific IgM, was found only among anti-A-CHO antibodies produced in vivo. Low anti-A-CHO IgG production was seen in polyclonally activated as well as in antigen-activated cultures, whereas, in contrast, total IgG was produced in considerable amounts after polyclonal activation. This suggests a different distribution pattern, and/or diverse differentiation requirements for anti-A-CHO-producing B cells, compared with other B cell species."
CD010502,0,19039059,0,Hemoglobin and Streptococcus suis cell wall act in synergy to potentiate the inflammatory response of monocyte-derived macrophages.,"Streptococcus suis, a major swine pathogen world-wide, can trigger macrophages to secrete large amounts of proinflammatory cytokines, which increase the permeability of the blood-brain barrier. In this study, we hypothesized that hemoglobin may potentiate the inflammatory response of human macrophages stimulated with a S. suis cell-wall preparation. Monocyte-derived macrophages were stimulated with the S. suis cell-wall preparation in the presence or absence of human hemoglobin, and the secretion of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-6, and IL-8 was analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The cell-wall preparation induced dose-dependent IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-8 responses in macrophages. Hemoglobin potentiated the cell-wall induced inflammatory response, resulting in a significantly higher secretion of all the cytokines. The S. suis cell-wall preparation in combination with hemoglobin activated macrophage intracellular kinases involved in inflammatory signaling pathways. In conclusion, hemoglobin, which may be released in vivo by the action of S. suis suilysin on red blood cells, contributes to raising the levels of pro-inflammatory mediators by acting in synergy with S. suis cell-wall components. This phenomenon may contribute to the development and the severity of meningitis."
CD010502,0,18462210,0,Cytotoxic T lymphocyte and natural killer cell responses to non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae.,"Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) and natural killer (NK) cells have a key role in host defence against infectious pathogens, but their response to bacteria is not well characterized. Non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae is a major cause of respiratory tract infection including otitis media, sinusitis, tonsillitis and chronic bronchitis (especially in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and bronchiectasis). This bacterium is also present in the pharynx of most healthy adults. The primary factor that may determine whether clinical disease occurs or not is the nature of the lymphocyte response. Here we examined the CTL cell and NK cell responses to nontypeable H. influenzae in healthy control subjects and in subjects who had bronchiectasis and recurrent bronchial infection with this bacterium. Cells were stimulated with live H. influenzae and intracellular cytokine production and release of cytotoxic granules measured. Control subjects had significantly higher levels of interferon gamma production by both CTL and NK cells, while levels of cytotoxic granule release were similar in both groups. The main lymphocyte subsets that proliferated in response to H. influenzae stimulation were the CTL and NK cells. The results suggest that CTL and NK cell responses may be important in preventing disease from nontypeable H. influenzae infection."

The objective of our work was to investigate T-cell-mediated immunity in WG by testing proliferative responses on bacterial antigens and particularly Staphylococcus aureus. We investigated the bulk proliferative response of peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) from patients with clinically active WG to gram-positive bacteria and purified proteinase 3 (PR-3), the major target antigen of c-ANCA. We generated S. aureus-specific PBL-derived T-cell lines and T-cell clones (TLC). In two WG patients 27 TLC were characterized in terms of reactivity to bacterial antigens/PR-3, phenotype, HLA class II restriction and pattern of cytokine secretion. Compared to coagulase-negative Staphylococci and beta-haemolytic Streptococci A, reactivity to S. aureus was significantly increased in all patients with WG. Using purified PR-3, we found a PBL proliferation in five out of 25 WG patients. The TLC were S. aureus-specific and did not cross-recognize Streptococci or coagulase-negative Staphylococci. The S. aureus-specific TLC were of the alphabeta-TCR+ CD4+ phenotype and HLA-DR-restricted. These TLC predominantly showed a Th2-type of cytokine secretion. Interestingly, seven of the S. aureus-reactive TLC also recognized the PR-3 antigen. From these data we conclude that Staphylococci-specific HLA-DR-restricted CD4+ T cells may play a key role in the initial triggering of immune responses in WG."

The clinical features of three other cases treated in Southeast Queensland in the past 2 years and 12 previously reported cases are summarised. The widespread availability of rapid diagnostic testing for this entity should allow for increased recognition, enabling appropriate use of low plasma volume blood products with improved patient outcome."
CD010502,0,7905016,0,Selective anergy of V beta 8+ T cells in human immunodeficiency virus-infected individuals.,"We have analyzed the V beta usage by CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals in response to an in vitro stimulation with the superantigenic erythrogenic toxin A (ETA) of Streptococcus pyogenes. ETA amplifies specifically CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from control donors expressing the V beta 8 and the V beta 12 elements. When peripheral T cells from asymptomatic HIV-infected individuals were stimulated with ETA, there was a complete lack of activation of the V beta 8+ T cell subset, whereas the V beta 12+ T cell subset responded normally to the superantigen. This V beta-specific anergy, which was also observed in response to staphylococcal enterotoxin E (SEE), affected both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and represented an intrinsic functional defect rather than a specific lack of response to bacterial superantigens since it was also observed after a stimulation with V beta 8 monoclonal antibodies. The V beta 8 anergic T cells did not express interleukin 2 receptors (IL-2Rs) and failed to proliferate in response to exogenous IL-2 or IL-4, suggesting that this anergy was not a reversible process, at least by the use of these cytokines. The unresponsiveness of the V beta 8 T cell subset is frequent since it was found in 56% of the patients studied, and comparison of the clinical status of responder vs. anergic patients indicated that the only known common factor between them was HIV infection. In addition, it is noteworthy that the anergy of the V beta 8 subset may be a very early phenomenon since it was found in a patient at Centers for Disease Control stage I of the disease. These data provide evidence that a dominant superantigen may be involved in the course of HIV infection and that the contribution of HIV has to be considered."
CD010502,0,2808674,0,Detection of influenza virus by centrifugal inoculation of MDCK cells and staining with monoclonal antibodies.,"Two methods for detection of influenza virus in 451 clinical respiratory specimens were compared: (i) 24-well-plate centrifugation with Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells and staining with monoclonal antibody pools to influenza viruses A and B (Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, Ga.) in an indirect immunofluorescence assay after incubation for 40 h, and (ii) conventional tissue cell culture with primary monkey cells and hemadsorption. For 100 of these specimens, direct examination of smears by the direct fluorescence assay with monoclonal antibodies (Boots Cell Tech/API Analytab Products, Plainview, N.Y.) was also performed. Influenza A virus was recovered from 28 specimens by tissue cell culture after incubation for an average of 4.75 days (range, 2 to 14 days). Influenza B virus was recovered from 35 specimens by tissue culture after incubation for an average of 5.4 days (range, 3 to 14 days). By the centrifugation assay, 23 specimens were positive for influenza A virus and 30 were positive for influenza B virus. All specimens positive by the centrifugation assay were also positive by conventional tissue cell culture. The sensitivities of the centrifugation assay were 82% for detection of influenza A virus and 86% for influenza B virus (84% overall); the specificity of the assay was 100%. Of the 100 specimens studied by direct examination, 15 were positive for influenza virus by both conventional culture and centrifugation assay; however, the direct-smear results for these 15 specimens were negative in 13 cases and inconclusive in 2. The centrifugation assay is a rapid and specific method for detection of influenza A and B viruses in clinical specimens, and it can serve as a valuable and cost-efficient adjunct to conventional culture methods."

CD010502,0,9253413,0,Crystal structure of the streptococcal superantigen SPE-C: dimerization and zinc binding suggest a novel mode of interaction with MHC class II molecules.,"Bacterial superantigens are small proteins that have a very potent stimulatory effect on T lymphocytes through their ability to bind to both MHC class II molecules and T-cell receptors. We have determined the three-dimensional structure of a Streptococcal superantigen, SPE-C, at 2.4 A resolution. The structure shows that SPE-C has the usual superantigen fold, but that the surface that forms a generic, low-affinity MHC-binding site in other superantigens is here used to create a SPE-C dimer. Instead, MHC class II binding occurs through a zinc binding site that is analogous to a similar site in staphylococcal enterotoxin A. Consideration of the SPE-C dimer suggests a novel mechanism for promotion of MHC aggregation and T-cell activation."
CD010502,0,3290876,0,Streptococcal pharyngitis. What's new.,"Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis continues to be a major problem and accounts for a large number of physician visits. The recent resurgence of acute rheumatic fever in several areas in the United States underlines the need to accurately diagnose and correctly treat streptococcal pharyngitis. Appropriate treatment with antibiotics effectively prevents rheumatic fever. Early institution of treatment also leads to prompt alleviation of symptoms. The ""gold standard"" for diagnosing group A streptococcal pharyngitis is the throat culture. Newer rapid diagnostic tests may be used, but the clinician must recognize that there are a substantial number of false-negative tests (low sensitivity). Therefore, patients with negative rapid tests should have standard throat cultures as well. Patients with positive rapid tests should be treated with appropriate antibiotics, as should patients with positive throat cultures. Patients with signs and symptoms that are highly suggestive of streptococcal pharyngitis can also be treated, pending throat culture results. Penicillin continues to be the drug of choice for treatment, and American Heart Association guidelines suggest the use of oral penicillin V for ten days or intramuscular benzathine penicillin G. Alternative antibiotics commonly used include erythromycin and various cephalosporins. Throat cultures need not be obtained from most patients after therapy. However, some patients may seem to be having frequent streptococcal infections or may be recognized as asymptomatic carriers. Carriers may be considered for therapy with intramuscular benzathine penicillin G plus oral rifampin."
CD010502,0,11158111,0,"Unusual occurrence of M type 77, antibiotic-resistant group A streptococci in southern Sweden.","For many years group A streptococci of T type 28 (T28) have been common in southern Sweden; however, since 1995 resistance to both macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B (MLS) antibiotics and tetracycline was observed among T28 isolates, which prompted the present studies on clonal relatedness of antibiotic-resistant T28 strains. By extended T typing, 95 of 100 examined tetracycline-resistant strains showed the combination T9-T13-T28; of these, 94 belonged to M type 77 (M77) and one belonged to M73. Three strains were T28-M28 and two were T28-M nontypeable. The serological M77 was confirmed by PCR capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, emm amplicon restriction profiling, and emm sequence typing. Fifty strains were examined for superantigen genes: speA was detected in three blood isolates only, whereas all isolates harbored speB, and only two of the strains were negative for speC. Eighty-nine of the 100 strains were also macrolide resistant, of which 59 were inducibly MLS resistant (IR) and 21 were constitutively MLS resistant (CR), 6 were noninducibly resistant (NI), and 3 had novel subphenotypes recently reported by our group. Resistance genes were determined by PCR and hybridization methods. Eighty-four of the 100 strains harbored tetM. ermB was detected in all CR and IR strains, and mefA was found in all NI strains; both ermB and mefA were identified in two strains with novel subphenotypes. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis showed that these antibiotic-resistant M77 strains belonged to at least five different clones."

Microbiologic diagnosis of many of these cases was hindered by delayed presentation for care and by prior antibiotic therapy. In a retrospective investigation, we used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays to measure antibody titers to components of anthrax edema toxin (edema factor [EF] and protective antigen [PA]), lethal toxin (lethal factor [LF] and PA), and poly-D-glutamic acid capsule. Electrophoretic-immunotransblots (EITB, Western blot) were used to detect antibodies to PA and LF. Nine patients with cutaneous anthrax, 10 patients with oral-oropharyngeal anthrax, and 43 healthy unexposed Thai control villagers were studied. Over all, EITB was positive in 13/18 patients (sensitivity 72%) and 0/43 controls (specificity 100%). The sensitivity of the ELISA was 72% for PA, 42% for LF, 26% for EF, and 95-100% for capsule. Although a few control sera had apparent false positive titers to PA, the specificity of the ELISA confirmed by EITB (100%) demonstrated the applicability of these tests for the diagnosis of anthrax."

CD010502,0,21458695,0,[Prudent use of antibiotics and suggestions for improvement in the primary health care system].,"A third of all primary care (PC) visits are due to infectious diseases and more than half of these are due to respiratory tract infections. In most cases, data from the clinical history and physical examinations do not help discern whether the aetiology of the infection is bacterial or not and, when in doubt, the family doctor tends to prescribe antibiotics despite the marginal effect that these drugs have on most respiratory infections. Moreover, PC physicians overestimate the proportion of patients with infections who expect to receive antibiotics and according to the scientific literature this perception is often wrong. In addition, patient expectations are often based on false assumptions or experiences from previous visits. Various strategies have proven useful in promoting more prudent use of antibiotics in PC. Delayed prescription of antibiotics is recommended mainly in non-serious infections of suspected viral aetiology in patients who express a preference for antibiotics. Improving communication skills has also proven useful in reducing prescriptions of antibiotics as has the use of rapid diagnostic tests in the doctor's office, mainly rapid antigen techniques for diagnosis of strep throat and determination of C-reactive protein. The results of the Happy Audit study recently conducted in Spain confirm these findings."

CD010502,0,10491315,0,Prevalence of circulating antibodies against a streptokinase C-terminal peptide in normal blood donors.,"Streptokinase (SK) is a streptococcal protein widely used as a thrombolytic agent. Anti-SK antibodies (Abs) are found in most individuals due to common streptococcal infections. The presence of these Abs increases the possibility of allergic reactions and may reduce the thrombolytic efficacy of SK upon a first therapy. Previous studies report on the immunodominance of the SK C-terminus and the role of this region in plasminogen (Plg) activation. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of circulating Abs to the SK C-terminus in normal blood donors. Sera from 1008 subjects aged 30 to 60 years were tested by Ultra-Micro-ELISA using a synthetic peptide resembling the SKC-2 C-terminus. An overall prevalence of 30. 4% was found. Prevalence was significantly higher among male than among female donors (RR = 1.70, 1.13 < CI < 2.55). No age effect was observed. This is the first extensive study about Abs directed against a particular region of SK in normal subjects."
CD010502,0,21204934,0,Induction of protective immune response against Streptococcus suis serotype 2 infection by the surface antigen HP0245.,"Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (SS2) is an emerging zoonotic pathogen. Prevention and control of the diseases caused by SS2 bacteria are hampered by the lack of effective vaccines. We report that an in vivo-induced protein HP0245 was located at the cell surface of SS2. The extracellular peptide of HP0245 was produced in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). Its immunogenicity was compared with SS2 bacterin. Like SS2 bacterin, protein HP0245(EC) formulated in aluminum hydroxide adjuvant provided 100% protection in mice challenged with a low dose (2 × LD(50) ) of SS2. However, 80% and 50% survival rates were observed in mice vaccinated with HP0245(EC) and SS2 bacterin, respectively, challenged with a high dose (5 × LD(50) ) of SS2. Immunization with HP0245(EC) induced significantly higher IgG2a titers compared with SS2 bacterin, which was more effective for opsonophagocytosis. No obvious histopathological change was found in the HP0245(EC) -vaccinated mice after challenge with the low dose of SS2, whereas a mild lesion was observed in the meninges of the mice vaccinated with SS2 bacterin. Homologous hp0245 genes with the highly conserved coding sequence of the extracellular peptide exist in all sequenced SS2 strains as well as most S. suis reference strains. Thus, HP0245 could be considered as a promising vaccine candidate for SS2."

However conventional microbiogical techniques of bacterial identification, culture and isolation of pathogenic bacteria, identification by biochemistry and serological assay, are time-consuming and require intensive labor. On the basis of special gene sequence, PCR provides simple and rapid way to identify bacteria. But it is difficult to identify all of bacteria species which are suspicious of pathogenic agents. Oligonucleotide arrays provide a powerful tool for parallel detection of target genes. The objective of this study was to test a reverse oligonucleotide assay, which hybridize with the PCR product of 16SrDNA using a pair of universal primers, to rapidly identify common infant pathogenic bacteria."

Early diagnosis could facilitate the institution of penicillin prophylaxis resulting in the prevention of recurrences of rheumatic fever. An overlapping biotinylated peptide bank of 82 peptides, based on the known sequence of Streptococcus pyogenes M24 protein, was used in a standard enzyme immunoassay. A total of 82 sera were tested from both aboriginal and non-aboriginal subjects with clinically proven rheumatic fever, rheumatic heart disease and matched controls. Two peptides with significant sequence homology at the C-terminal end were found to be discriminatory between aboriginal cases and controls. It is proposed that these peptides could be the basis of a serological test for rheumatic fever."
CD010502,0,8335938,0,Localization of an immunologically functional region of the streptococcal superantigen pepsin-extracted fragment of type 5 M protein.,"Ten overlapping synthetic peptides, spanning the entire amino acid sequence of pepsin-extracted type 5 M protein, (pep M5), were used to delineate regions within this molecule that are important for the mitogenic activity of this streptococcal superantigen. Two of the overlapping peptides, SM5-8 and SM5-10, blocked the response of T cells to pep M5 in a dose-dependent manner. Neither peptide was toxic to T cells, but SM5-8 exhibited nonspecific inhibition of the T-cell response to either superantigen or polyclonal mitogens. In contrast, the inhibition by SM5-10 was pep M5-specific. Analysis of TCR V beta gene usage of the pep M5 response in the presence and absence of SM5-10 revealed that this peptide preferentially blocks the expansion of pep M5-specific V beta elements. The degree of inhibition of V beta expansion varied from one individual to the other, reflecting their TCR repertoire. SM5-10 did not significantly inhibit the response of T cells to other streptococcal superantigens. The data suggest that the region represented by SM5-10 of the pep M5 is important for superantigenic activity. In addition, the ability of this synthetic peptide to inhibit the response to pep M5 provides evidence that the mitogenic response is indeed mediated by this superantigen and is not a result of contamination with other streptococcal superantigens."

Pertinent literature has also been reviewed. Two hundred pregnant women at gestational week 17 were included. Swabs from the uterine cervix were tested for GBS by ICON Strep B immunoassay and ordinary cultures on blood agar. Additional swabs from the rectum were tested by cultures. The percentage of women with GBS in cervical secretions was 13.5% (27/200) by cultures and 4% (8/200) by the ICON Strep B immunoassay. The overall sensitivity of the immunoassay was 7.4%, and the specificity 96.5%. In conclusion, the sensitivity of rapid enzyme immunoassays is too low for accurate screening of GBS in the genital tract of pregnant women."

With this agent, western blot readily detected PrP(sc) in 263K scrapie hamster and C57Bl/6 wild-type mice challenged with C506M3 scrapie strain. Our aim was to evaluate this new diagnosis procedure in the field of human transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs). First, we had confirmed the ability of streptomycin to precipitate PrP(res) from human brain of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) patient. Second, we compared the detection of PrP(res) with streptomycin against three other protocols using other precipitations. Then we assessed PrP(res) detection with streptomycin in 98 brain tissue samples from various aetiologies of human TSEs and 52 brain samples from other dementia. Finally, we applied this protocol for tonsils examination of five patients suspected of variant CJD (v-CJD). Sensitivity and specificity obtained with the streptomycin protocol were both 100% on brain tissue. For tonsil tissues, PrP(res) was clearly identified in the two post-mortem confirmed v-CJD cases, whereas no characteristic three-band pattern was seen in the three confirmed non-v-CJD samples. In this study, streptomycin demonstrated its efficiency to detect PrP(res) both in the central nervous system and in the lymphoid tissue without practical difficulty and with rapid preparation. Because of its ability to act as a good agent for PrP(sc) examination in different tissues, recovery of PrP(sc) in biological fluids using streptomycin should open further perspectives of applications in CJD diagnostics. Streptomycin effects in vivo might thus also be questioned."

Bacterial nasopharyngitis has been described in children. This entity possibly exists also in adults. Traditional viral cultures are rarely positive and are not recommended in the daily routine. In children, antigen detection for adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza and influenza virus are recommended to confirm the viral etiology or for epidemiological surveillance.

CD010502,0,3323030,0,"Identification of the site on IgG Fc for interaction with streptococci of groups A, C and G.","The interaction between living groups A, C and G streptococci and IgG Fc was studied using human IgG, IgG Fc and IgG Fc-intermediate (Fci) fragments, chemically modified human IgG and fragment D of staphylococcal protein A (SPA). Diethylpyrocarbonate modification of His or N-acetylimidazole modification of Tyr of human IgG resulted in the loss of its capacity to inhibit the binding of radiolabelled human IgG Fc to the group A streptococci types M1 and M55, and to the group C strain SC-1, indicating that the amino acids His and Tyr are involved in the binding. Lys seems not to participate in the binding of IgG to these bacteria, however, since reductive methylation of Lys did not reduce its inhibitory capacity. Fragment D of SPA also inhibited the binding of radiolabelled human IgG Fc to strains M1, M55 and SC-1. We have previously shown that these bacteria do not bind to IgG fragments consisting of only the C gamma 2 or C gamma 3 domains. On the basis of these results, and the known relative positions in space of the His and Tyr residues on IgG Fc, it is speculated whether streptococci with IgG Fc receptors, like SPA and rheumatoid factors, interact with IgG in the interface between the C gamma 2 and C gamma 3 domains and involve His 435 and one or more of Tyr 436, His 433 and His 310.

In an empirical material of 2016 patients, 3 different bacteriological methods (traditional culture, slide culture, and latex agglutination test) for the detection of group A beta-hemolytic streptococci (GAS) were compared. Sensitivity analyses were done for several variables, including GAS test performance, testing frequencies, medication rates, and accuracy of clinical evaluation. The amounts of unnecessary medication varied from 19 to 33%, and there were 2.2-8.9% of untreated GAS infections. Strategies based on bacteriology achieved more rational and economic results than treating no one, treating all patients, or using clinical evaluation without bacteriology. The cost-effectiveness of the latex agglutination test depended on the sensitivity of the test. The results were further sensitive to sick leave lengths, cost of antibacterials, and clinical accuracy, but not to GAS test cost. Rapid tests for GAS detection can be recommended, if the sensitivity of the test in the actual working conditions is acceptable."

All 44 patients with IgA nephropathy and 2 of 39 patients with other glomerular diseases showed mesangial deposition of OMHP antigens (p < 0.001). Patients with IgA nephropathy had significantly more IgA antibody against H parainfluenzae than did patients with other glomerular diseases. IgA antibody in the sera of patients with IgA nephropathy recognised by immunoblotting the same four components of OMHP as recognised by rabbit antiserum.

In 88 cases of various tonsillar diseases, i.e., PPP, chronic tonsillitis, and sleep apnea syndrome, distribution of immunocompetent cells, i.e., B cells having various immunoglobulin isotypes (IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD, IgE, IgA1, and IgA2) on their surfaces and T cell subsets, helper/inducer (CD4+) T cell and suppressor/cytotoxic (CD8+) T cell were investigated immunohistologically using monoclonal antibodies and ABC method. The proportion of the immunocompetent cells in four anatomical sites in tonsil (germinal center, mantle zone, interfollicular area, and subepithelial area) were quantitatively studied by the image analyzer (CUE-2, Olympus, USA) and compared among various age groups and among three groups of tonsillar diseases. The difference of immunocompetent cells in tonsils between the effective group (showing marked improvement of skin lesions of PPP after tonsillectomy) and the not-effective group (showing no improvement of skin lesions after tonsillectomy) was also investigated. The results were summarized as follows. 1) Every type of Ig-positive cells in tonsils was decreased in proportion to age, especially the changes of IgG-, IgM-, and IgD-positive cells were inversely proportional to age with statistical significance. On the other hand, changes to T cell subsets with age were smaller in comparison with those of Ig-positive cells, especially the proportion of CD4-positive cells showed almost no changes in accordance with age. 2) Eighty percent of cases with PPP were classified into the effective group, whereas only 20% of them into the not-effective group. 3) IgG-, IgM-, and IgD-positive cells in tonsils of PPP were found to be significantly increased in the effective group compared to the not-effective group. In addition, in the effective group, CD4-positive cells were significantly increased in the interfollicular area and the subepithelial area of the tonsil. These results indicate that the image analysis will be a breakthrough in quantitative study on the immunohistology of the tonsil and give us useful informations in terms of the mechanism of tonsillar focal infections, i.e., immunological abnormalities in tonsils may play one of the important roles in the pathogenesis of PPP."

This is as accurate as ""flipping a coin"". Similar figures were found with regard to the individual symptoms (accuracy 0.38-0.68) and clinical findings (accuracy 0.36-0.65). Taking the duration of symptoms into account and applying discriminant function analysis did not significantly improve these figures. In order to obtain a sufficiently accurate diagnosis in general practice, the use of the new rapid agglutination test for streptococcal identification is recommended."

The disease progresses rapidly, causing severe necrosis and hydrolysis of soft tissues. Histopathological analysis of necrotic tissue debrided from two patients (one with necrotising fasciitis and one with myonecrosis) showed large quantities of bacteria but no infiltrating neutrophils. We aimed to investigate whether the poor neutrophil chemotaxis was linked with the ability of group A streptococcus (GAS) to degrade host chemokines."

CD010502,0,16386410,0,[Tonsillectomy in 2005].,"During the past years, the number of tonsillectomies (only palatine tonsils are taken off) has decreased, indications for surgery have changed. A multi-disciplinal group of paediatricians tried to elaborate the state of the art in the field. Tonsils are the first line defense of high respiratory tract. The immune functions of their lymphoid tissue are multiple: mucosal antigens capture, presentation to lymphocytes, antigens specific proliferation of lymphocytes T and B, differentiation of lymphocytes in effectors lymphocytes and immune lymphocytes. Epithelial cells on the tonsils' surface express non-specific defense. These facts explain partly tonsils' hypertrophy. Tonsillectomy has no general immune consequences. In 2002, in France, 75,000 tonsillectomies were realized, of which 90% were in children. Tonsil's hypertrophy is the major indication, mandatory when sleep apnoeas exist. The main historical tonsillectomy indication for recurrent tonsillitis should decrease due to a more precise diagnostic (rapid test at bed site), an efficient antibiotics therapy and better care for pain. Other indications are scarce. Surgery, feasible from 9 months of age, requires a brief general anaesthesia and has very few contra-indications. The technique, operator dependent, relies on his experience. The only potentially severe complication is an haemorrhage due to scab fall between the eighth and twelfth days. It requires explanation and a written note given to parents. The possibility of lack of feeding and voice modification, usually transitory, should be known. Multiple consequences of tonsillectomy especially allergy have been alleged. Since the years 1980, it is well established that pre-existing allergy or asthma are not a contraindication. More, its deleterious impact on allergic children has not been demonstrated. Last, a gain of weight post-tonsillectomy is possible and could become a risk if excessive."

All tests were performed by American Society of Clinical Pathology-registered technologists in a large clinical laboratory. A total of 11,088 throat swabs were tested; 9,161 belonged to pediatric patients and 1,927 to adults. For TestPack Strep A, the study demonstrated a sensitivity value of 0.91 and a specificity value of 0.96; positive predictive value and negative predictive values were 0.82 and 0.98, respectively. These data indicate that even when performed by experienced technologists, in a laboratory setting, approximately 1 of 10 patients with group A streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis will be missed if physicians rely solely on this direct antigen test. A backup culture on all patients who are negative by a rapid antigen detection test is recommended."
CD010502,0,3050865,1,Rapid group A streptococcal antigen detection kit: effect on antimicrobial therapy for acute pharyngitis.,"Newly introduced rapid diagnostic tests for group A streptococcal pharyngitis should facilitate appropriate antimicrobial use in patients with group A streptococcal pharyngitis. Because of high rates of acute pharyngitis in Tuba City, AZ, at the Navajo Indian reservation, the use of rapid diagnostic test was prospectively evaluated. The sensitivity and specificity of the test was measured and changes in physician prescribing patterns attributable to use of the test were correlated. Of 320 patients with pharyngitis enrolled during the present 3-week study, 86 met the study's definition of a patient with streptococcal pharyngitis and 163 met the study's definition of a patient with nonstreptococcal pharyngitis. The rapid test was 62.8% sensitive and 96.9% specific in identifying patients from whom group A streptococci were isolated. Although treatment of patients with streptococcal pharyngitis at the time of the first visit increased from 36.5% in a retrospective sample to 72.5% during the study, treatment of patients in whom cultures were negative remained the same. Further analyses showed that physicians tended to treat patients with signs characteristic of streptococcal pharyngitis and, as the study progressed, to rely less on negative rapid test results as a reason to withhold antimicrobial agents. It was concluded that rapid tests with good specificity but limited sensitivity may improve treatment of patients with streptococcal pharyngitis by allowing earlier specific therapy. A more sensitive test with a higher negative predictive value would be necessary to prevent treatment of persons with nonstreptococcal pharyngitis."
CD010502,0,6754613,0,Transduction of the genetic determinant for streptolysin S in group A streptococci.,"The genetic determinant for streptolysin S production (SLS+) was successfully transduced to two naturally occurring nonhemolytic strains of group A streptococci (Streptococcus pyogenes), an M-type 18 strain associated with an outbreak of rheumatic fever and an M-negative variant of a type 49 strain isolated from a skin lesion. Attempts to transduce this determinant to a nonhemolytic M-type 68 strain and a nonhemolytic T-type 12 strain were not successful. Transduction was accomplished with a double temperature-sensitive mutant bacteriophage. Cellular antigenic characters and the phage sensitivity of the transductants remained unaltered. The donor strain also transduced streptomycin resistance well when the nonhemolytic type 49 strain was used as a recipient. There was no evidence of cotransduction of the determinants for streptolysin S and streptomycin resistance."
CD010502,0,15731068,0,Characterization of a novel leucine-rich repeat protein antigen from group B streptococci that elicits protective immunity.,"Group B streptococci (GBS) usually behave as commensal organisms that asymptomatically colonize the gastrointestinal and urogenital tracts of adults. However, GBS are also pathogens and the leading bacterial cause of life-threatening invasive disease in neonates. While the events leading to transmission and disease in neonates remain unclear, GBS carriage and level of colonization in the mother have been shown to be significant risk factors associated with invasive infection. Surface antigens represent ideal vaccine targets for eliciting antibodies that can act as opsonins and/or inhibit colonization and invasion. Using a genetic screen for exported proteins in GBS, we identified a gene, designated lrrG, that encodes a novel LPXTG anchored surface antigen containing leucine-rich repeat (LRR) motifs found in bacterial invasins and other members of the LRR protein family. Southern blotting showed that lrrG was present in all GBS strains tested, representing the nine serotypes, and revealed the presence of an lrrG homologue in Streptococcus pyogenes. Recombinant LrrG protein was shown in vitro to adhere to epithelial cells in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that it may function as an adhesion factor in GBS. More importantly, immunization with recombinant LrrG elicited a strong immunoglobulin G response in CBA/ca mice and protected against lethal challenge with virulent GBS. The data presented in this report suggest that this conserved protein is a highly promising candidate antigen for use in a GBS vaccine."
CD010502,0,17166966,0,Evaluation of NucliSens easyMAG for automated nucleic acid extraction from various clinical specimens.,"The objectives of this study were to evaluate the performance of the NucliSens easyMAG platform for nucleic acid extraction from different clinical specimens compared to NucliSens miniMAG platform and manual QIAGEN extraction. The NucliSens easyMAG and the NucliSens miniMAG showed equal performance on 215 throat swabs since real-time nucleic acid sequence-based amplification scored the same samples positive for Mycoplasma pneumoniae (n=9) and Chlamydia pneumoniae (n=5) RNAs, although internal control RNA was slightly better detected with the NucliSens easyMAG (99.3% versus 96.8%). NucliSens easyMAG extracted nucleic acids more efficiently (higher recovery and/or fewer inhibitors) compared to QIAGEN extraction by showing, on average, lower Ct values in real-time LightCycler PCR, although 4 individual specimen out of 45 were found positive only with QIAGEN. For nine M. pneumoniae-positive throat swabs, the mean difference in Ct values between NucliSens easyMAG extraction and QIAGEN extraction was -2.26 (range, -5.77 to +0.60); for the detection of five C. pneumoniae-positive throat swabs, the average difference in Ct values between the two methods was -3.38 (range, -6.62 to -2.02); and for the detection of cytomegalovirus in 24 blood samples, the mean difference in Ct values between the two methods was -0.95 (range, -5.51 to +1.68). The NucliSens easyMAG is considerably easier to perform, efficiently extracts nucleic acids from throat swabs and whole blood, is automated, and has high throughput."
CD010502,0,7993377,0,[Noninstrumental immunoanalysis based on dyed polyacrolein latexes. Determination of a group-specific polysaccharide from Streptococcus pyogenes].,"Non-instrumental immunoassays based on immunofiltration and microtiter particle agglutination (MPA) techniques have been developed using coloured polyacrolein latex. These methods have been applied to the quantification of the group-specific polysaccharide (PS) of S. pyogenes (group A streptococcus) and compared with standard ELISA tests. The most efficient method was MPA; as little as 0.05 ng A-PS/ml could be detected in 1.5 h. In comparison with ELISA test, the sensitivity of MPA was 10 times higher and the procedure was much simpler. The sensitivity of immunofiltration assay using both enzyme and latex conjugates was shown to be the same (50 ng/ml A-PS) and the duration of the assay 3-5 min. No cross-reactions of latex conjugates with non A streptococcus cell lysates have been observed. The developed methods are rapid, robust, easy to perform, don't need any sophisticated equipment and specially trained staff."

GBS sepsis was defined as early (< 48 hours) signs of sepsis in a neonate colonised with GBS. Neonates of 26 weeks' gestation or more, considered at risk for sepsis, were prospectively investigated for one year. Investigations included culture of superficial swabs to assess colonisation, blood culture, and the Wellcogen Strep B latex particle agglutination test on urine. Of 188 neonates investigated, 17 (9%) had GBS sepsis. The urine antigen test had a sensitivity of 88% and specificity of 98%. The positive predictive value was 79% and the negative predictive value 99%. Blood culture was positive in only five neonates (29%). The annual incidence of GBS sepsis was 4.0 per 1000 and of blood culture positive GBS disease was 1.2 per 1000 live births. Three neonates died. The application of the urine antigen test of clinical neonatal practice is discussed."

MATERIALS AND METHODS. 2 groups of patients with bacteriologically confirmed SGA infection (50 cases of angina - group 1 and 51 case of soft tissue infection - group 2) were examined for the presence of ASL-O by using Architect ci8200 analyzer (Abbott, USA) and IgM against SGA A-PSC by EIA. RESULTS. In group 1, 23 (46%) individuals were recognized as positive by ASL-O level, and in group 2 - 20 (39%; p>0.05); conditionally significant exceeding of normal values (more than 1.5 times) was detected in 25% of patients of each group. Increased level of antibodies against SGA A-PSC was detected in 43 (86%) patients of group 1, and in 30 (59%) of patients of group 2 (p<0.05). In group 1 exceeding of normal values of anti-A-PSC IgM was noted mostly by 1.5 +/- 0.5 times (74%). In group 2 in 43% of patients the level of anti-A-PSC IgM was above normal more than 2 times and in most cases in uncomplicated variants of disease course. In 45% of patients with severe form of soft tissue infection this parameter did not exceed normal values (p<0.05). CONCLUSION. In acute period of disease with simultaneous determination of ASL-O and IgM against A-PSC sensitivity of serologic diagnostics of SGA etiology angina and SGA infection of soft tissues was established to reach 92% and 72%, respectively, and humoral immune response to cellular AG in each form of SGA has its features."

A collection of 32 invasive and 150 non-invasive isolates were recruited for analysis. emm1 (34.4%) and emm12 (40.0%) predominated in the invasive and non-invasive isolates, respectively. The peak incidence of invasive GAS infection (IGASI) occurred between 2002 and 2003. emm4 and emm12 were the major types among clinical isolates before 2001, and was replaced by emm1 during 2002-2003. All emm1 isolates were clonal relatedness. The declined prevalence of erythromycin resistance occurred in the major shift of the endemic isolates to emm1 strains during 2002-2003 in the community."
CD010502,0,9488384,0,Immunoglobulins to group A streptococcal surface molecules decrease adherence to and invasion of human pharyngeal cells.,"The M protein is one of the most important virulence factors of group A streptococci (Streptococcus pyogenes) and may play an important role in the first steps of streptococcal infection. Since acute pharyngitis is a frequently occurring infectious disease caused by these bacteria, we wished to know whether antibodies to the M protein or other surface components inhibit adherence and internalization of streptococci to pharyngeal cells. We investigated the role of whole human secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA), M6 protein-specific sIgA, and M6 protein-specific serum IgG in the inhibition of streptococcal adherence and internalization to cultured human pharyngeal cells. S. pyogenes D471, which produces a type 6 M protein (M+), and its isogenic M-negative (M-) derivative JRS75 were tested. Purified whole sIgA, M protein-specific sIgA, and sIgA preabsorbed with M protein were able to decrease significantly the adherence of streptococci to pharyngeal cells. Purified IgG against the M6 protein did not diminish the attachment of streptococci to the pharyngeal cells but did reduce internalization. Thus, our data suggest that secretory IgA may play a key role in preventing streptococcal infection at mucosal surfaces by blocking adherence while affinity-purified anti-M protein-specific IgG blocks epitopes responsible for invasion."

CD010502,0,8300205,0,M protein mediates streptococcal adhesion to HEp-2 cells.,"Streptococcus pyogenes adheres to human epithelial cells in vitro and in vivo. To identify adhesins, cell wall components were extracted from S. pyogenes M6 with alkali or by treatment with mutanolysin and lysozyme. HEp-2 cells were incubated with extracts of S. pyogenes M6 and then analyzed by Western blot (immunoblot) assays, using antibodies to S. pyogenes. Only one streptococcal component (62 kDa) was bound to HEp-2 cells and was identified serologically as M6 protein. Experiments with pepsin-cleaved fragments of M protein indicated that the binding site was located at the N-terminal half of the molecule. M protein was bound selectively to two trypsin-sensitive surface components, 97 and 205 kDa, of HEp-2 cells on nitrocellulose blots of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. Tritium-labeled lipoteichoic acid bound to different HEp-2 cell components, 34 and 35 kDa, in a parallel experiment, indicating that lipoteichoic acid was not complexed with M protein and does not mediate M-protein binding. The four HEp-2 components were unrelated to fibronectin since they did not react with specific antibodies. An M-protein-deficient (M-) strain of streptococcus (JRS75), grown in chemically defined medium, showed 73% less adhesion activity to HEp-2 monolayers than an M+ strain (JRS4). Streptococcal adhesion was insensitive to competitive inhibition by selected monosaccharides. These results indicate that M protein binds directly to certain HEp-2 cell membrane components and mediates streptococcal adhesion."

These cell lines were stimulated with either PHA or streptococcal antigens. Proliferation assays revealed that both valvular and peripheral blood T cell lines reacted to cell wall (CW) and cell membrane (CM) antigens obtained from rheumatic fever associated group A streptococci and not to nephritogenic strains. None of the cell lines reacted to M protein, myosin or other mammalian cytoskeletal proteins. The unique reactivity of rheumatic fever T cell lines only to cellular structures obtained from rheumatogenic strains suggests that these lines react to epitopes specific for antigens obtained from these strains."

Clinicopathologic study of 68 cases.,"The clinical and pathologic findings were studied in 68 patients with primary lymphoma of Waldeyer's ring (WR). The initial sites included: tonsil (51%; 9% bilateral), nasopharynx (35%), base of tongue (9%), and multiple areas (4%). The mean age was 58 years, with a male to female ratio of 1.1:1.0. Tonsillar and base of tongue lesions presented with sore throat and dysphagia, whereas nasopharyngeal lymphomas most commonly presented with nasal, auditory, and cranial nerve sympatomatology. A neck mass was the sole presenting symptom in 12% of patients. Work-up showed 42% Stage I, 47% Stage II, 4% Stage III, and 7% Stage IV. All were non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Diffuse architecture predominated (71%) and 70% had a histiocytic or large cell morphology (diffuse histiocytic 51%, nodular histiocytic 19%). The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Working Formulation grades were 13% low, 81% intermediate, and 6% high. In difficult cases, detection of monoclonal immunoglobulin, absence of keratin staining, and lack of epithelial features by electron microscopy were useful adjuncts aiding in diagnosis. Following complete remission, 28 patients relapsed, 75% of these within 2 years (median, 10 months). Thirty-seven (54%) patients died with disease (median survival, 27 months). Of these, 89% had disseminated lymphoma. Local-regional disease was the direct cause of death in 13%. Recurrence or persistence of disease in WR occurred in 9% of cases, most with initial clinical evidence of soft tissue extension. Stage I patients had a significantly better median survival (67 months) than Stage II patients (20 months) (P = 0.03). Prognostically favorable histologic parameters included lower NCI Working Formulation grade and follicular architecture. Ten patients (15%) developed extranodal disease, eight involving the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and all died within 1 year of its occurrence. The findings indicate that stage and certain histologic parameters are important prognostic factors in WR lymphoma. The study confirms the association of primary WR lymphoma with other extranodal disease, particularly involving the GI tract, and emphasizes the poor prognosis of patients in whom this occurs."

Our studies were undertaken to determine whether streptococcal M protein, the major virulence factor of group A streptococci, evoked antibodies that cross-react with human brain. Rabbits were immunized with pepsin-extracted M protein from rheumatogenic type 6 streptococci. Immune sera were screened for the presence of antibodies that cross-reacted with human brain by indirect immunofluorescence tests and immunoblot analyses. Type 6 M protein evoked antibodies that cross-reacted with several brain proteins and antibody binding to these proteins was completely inhibited by type 6 M protein and partially inhibited by types 5 and 19 M proteins, suggesting that these heterologous M proteins contain conserved brain-cross-reactive epitopes. Using synthetic peptides from several serotypes of M proteins, the conserved brain-cross-reactive epitopes were localized to a decapeptide contained within the covalent structure of the B repeat region of type 6 M protein. These peptides also inhibited brain-cross-reactive antibodies in the serum of a patient with active Sydenham's chorea. Our data indicate that streptococcal M proteins contain brain-cross-reactive epitopes that could potentially be involved in the pathogenesis of Sydenham's chorea."

Human blood containing group A streptococci was placed on small pieces of sterile paper towelling and allowed to dry at room temperature. At periods of 2, 8, 15 and 20 weeks later, the paper with the dried blood was placed in Todd-Hewitt broth and incubated at 37 degrees C overnight. All the samples tested at 2 weeks grew in broth, and with only one exception, grew in fresh human blood provided by five donors. At 8 weeks only two of the 10 strains failed to grow in broth; seven of the eight viable cultures also grew in blood. At 15 and 20 weeks after drying the eight cultures were still viable. Since seven were able to grow in fresh blood as well as in broth it is assumed that their virulence factor(s) had been retained."
CD010502,0,9987154,0,Multivalent group A streptococcal vaccine designed to optimize the immunogenicity of six tandem M protein fragments.,"One of the major challenges in the development of group A streptococcal M protein-based vaccines is the multiplicity of M types expressed by these organisms. Previous studies have shown that multivalent vaccines containing as many as eight M protein fragments in tandem were immunogenic and evoked opsonic antibodies. It was also noted that the C-terminal fragments of these hybrid proteins were often not immunogenic or evoked only low levels of opsonic antibodies, suggesting that the C-terminus of the molecule may have been preferentially degraded or altered in vivo. In the present studies, we designed a hexavalent vaccine containing protective M protein peptides from types 24, 5, 6, 19, 1, and 3 group A streptococci. In order to ""protect"" the carboxy-terminal components, the amino-terminal M24 fragment was reiterated on the carboxy-terminal end of the construct. The hexavalent vaccine was immunogenic in laboratory animals and evoked high titers of antibodies against each of the native M proteins represented in the vaccine and bactericidal antibodies against all six sterotypes of group A streptococci. The vaccine was equally immunogenic when delivered in alum or in complete Freund's adjuvant. None of the immune sera contained antibodies that crossreacted with human heart tissue. Our results show that complex multivalent group A streptococcal vaccines can be designed in such a way that each M protein fragment is immunogenic and evokes protective antibodies."
CD010502,0,2594465,0,Evaluating the impact of a home screening test for streptococcal pharyngitis.,"Home screening tests must be evaluated as an aid to self-referral to a physician and should not be judged as if they were diagnostic procedures, i.e. the sole determinants of a therapeutic decision. The performance characteristics of a test are properly compared to those of the patient or parent, operating in the absence of the test. For streptococcal pharyngitis there would be a net increase in the number of cases correctly treated whenever the sensitivity of the home test (multiplied by the probability that the patient will act upon the test results) exceeds the a priori probability that the patient will be seen by a physician in the absence of the test. Use of home screening tests is likely to increase the number of patient-physician contacts among persons with sore throats and will do so proportionately more frequently among those with streptococcal pharyngitis."
CD010502,0,1385809,0,Architecture of the vir regulons of group A streptococci parallels opacity factor phenotype and M protein class.,"Group A streptococci have traditionally been categorized into two broad groups based on the presence or absence of serum opacity factor (OF). Recent studies show that these two groups vary in a number of properties in addition to the OF phenotype, including sequence variations in the constant region of the antiphagocytic M protein genes, the presence or absence of immunoglobulin G Fc receptor proteins, and the presence or absence of multiple M protein-like genes situated in a tandem array. The M protein genes (emm) in OF- streptococcal strains are known to be part of a regulon of virulence-related genes controlled by the trans-acting positive regulatory gene, virR, situated just upstream of emm. In OF+ strains, however, the region adjacent to virR is occupied by an M protein-related, type IIa immunoglobulin G Fc receptor gene (fcrA), and the relative position of emm has not been determined. To further define the vir regulon in OF+ streptococci, we used the polymerase chain reaction to show that fcrA49 is situated immediately upstream of emm49 in the OF+ type 49 strain CS101. This result shows for the first time the separate identity and genetic linkage of these two genes in the vir regulon of an OF+ group A streptococcal strain and confirms our previous hypothesis that emm49 exists as the central gene in a trio of emm-like genes. Additionally, using DNA hybridizations, we found considerable sequence divergence between OF- and OF+ group A streptococci in virR and in the noncoding sequences between virR and the emm or fcrA expression site. We found, however, a high degree of sequence conservation in this region within each of the two groups of strains."
CD010502,0,8735096,0,Molecular epidemiology of impetiginous group A streptococcal infections in aboriginal communities of northern Australia.,"Group A streptococcal infections among the Aboriginal communities of the Northern Territory of Australia are endemic, with a concurrently high rate of the postinfection sequelae of rheumatic fever and acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis. The majority of the group A streptococcal isolates from the Northern Territory are not typeable by M typing. We recently developed a novel genotyping method, Vir typing. A preliminary study using this method discriminated all the M-nontypeable (MNT) isolates. Vir typing is based on restriction fragment length polymorphisms of the 4- to 7-kb Vir regulon of group A streptococci, which contains a number of genes, including emm (the gene for M protein). A total of 407 isolates of group A streptococci obtained from four Aboriginal communities over a 4-year period were typed by this genotyping method. Forty-two distinct genotypes were found among the isolates, including 22 among the MNT isolates. The correlation between Vir type and M type was good. This genotyping method allows the characterization of all group A streptococcal isolates from Aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory. We also propose that Vir typing be used in conjunction with M typing for epidemiological surveillance in geographical regions where the majority of isolates are MNT."
CD010502,0,3317744,0,Bacterial adherence: the attachment of group A streptococci to mucosal surfaces.,"It is now recognized that bacteria bind to and colonize mucosal surfaces in a highly selective manner. After the organisms penetrate the nonspecific mechanical and cleansing forces, ligands (or adhesins) on the surface of the bacteria interact in a lock-and-key (or induced-fit) fashion with complementary receptors on mucosal surfaces of the host. The adhesins are usually composed of proteins in the form of fimbriae or fibrillae and the receptors of glycolipids or glycoproteins. In group A streptococci the adhesin, lipoteichoic acid (LTA), is anchored to one or more proteins on the surface of the bacterial cells and interacts through its lipid moiety with fibronectin molecules deposited on and bound to the epithelial cells. In an attempt to locate the region of fibronectin recognized by LTA and group A streptococci, fibronectin was cleaved with thermolysin and the fragment mixture adsorbed with Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes. Staphylococci adsorbed several high-molecular-weight fragments as well as a 28-kilodalton and a 23-kilodalton fragment, whereas S. pyogenes cells adsorbed only the 28-kilodalton fragment completely. The adsorption of the fragments by S. pyogenes was blocked by LTA. Antibodies raised against a synthetic peptide copying the NH2 terminus of fibronectin reacted in a western blot with the 28-kilodalton fragment; this result indicated that S. pyogenes and its LTA react with the NH2-terminal region of fibronectin at a site distinct from that at which S. aureus reacts. Our findings are consistent with the idea that LTA mediates the attachment of group A streptococci to fatty acid binding sites of fibronectin deposited on mucosal epithelial cells."

During the two-year period 1 March 1987 to 28 February 1989, testing for Chlamydia trachomatis (EIA-technique) was added in all infants with clinical conjunctivitis. During the period concerned there were 332 cases of conjunctivitis among 4,520 live born infants, an incidence of 7.3%. The incidence was higher for infants staying in the nursery (8.2%) than for those admitted to the neonatal unit (3.5%) (p less than 0.01). 90% of the infections were diagnosed during the first week of life. 468 isolates were identified by routine bacteriological investigation, 452 gram-positives (96.6%), and 16 gram-negatives (3.4%). The following strains were found: Staphylococcus aureus 171 (51.5% of the patients), Staphylococcus epidermidis 153 (46.1%), Streptococcus viridans 106 (31.9%), diphteroids 11 (3.3%), beta-hemolytic streptococci seven (2.1%), Streptococcus pneumoniae two (0.6%), enterococci two (0.6%), Hemophilus influenzae six (1.8%), Escherichia coli five (1.5%), Proteus two (0.6%) and Branhamella catarrhalis one (0.3%). Not a single case of gonococcal ophthalmia was diagnosed. Positive tests for Chlamydia were found in 13 infants (3.9% of all infants with conjunctivitis), an incidence of 0.3% for the whole population of live born infants. Six of the chlamydia infections (46%) occurred within the first week of life. Expenses for chlamydia testing were estimated to be NOK 1,020 per positive test. Preventing conjunctivitis in our nursery and neonatal unit calls for strategies to protect newborn infants from colonization with pathogenic bacteria, especially S. aureus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Some of these strains bear the protein antigen c or R, as do other GBS serotypes. The capsular type polysaccharide is sialylated and this residue is involved in the immunodeterminant structure. All type VII strains examined were virulent in CD-1 mice; the LD50 after intraperitoneal (i.p.) challenge was 4.57 (SD 0.12) x10(7) cfu for the reference strain and 5.49 (SD 1.5) x10(7) cfu for clinical isolates. A particular feature of this serotype was the ability to induce septic arthritis not only when injected intravenously (i.v.), but also when injected i.p. Rabbit antiserum against the capsular type VII polysaccharide exhibited opsonic activity in a phagocytosis assay and protective activity against infection."

CD010502,0,6994834,0,[Study of cross reactions between group A streptococcal antigens and cardiac interstitial connective tissue fibroblasts of different species of mammals].,It has been revealed by indirect immunofluorescence that sera of rabbits immunized with group A streptococcal non-type-specific antigens and F (ab')2 fragments of IgG obtained from these sera intensively react with fibroblasts of interstitial connective tissue (ICT) of the myocardium of humans and different mammalian species with the exception of rabbits. Negative or weak reactions with the same sera and F (ab')2 fragments were observed with fibroblasts of ICT of nonimmunized rabbits. Myocardial ICT of immunized animals showed bound immunoglobulins. This model can be used for making clear the reason for presence in sera of rheumatic patients circulating antibodies only to heterologous but not to homologous ICT of the myocardium regardless of the revealing bound immunoglobulins in the ICT of these patients.

CD010502,0,2456272,0,Conservation of protective and nonprotective epitopes in M proteins of group A streptococci.,"Carefully controlled hybridization experiments with probes from a cloned serotype 5 M protein (M5) gene (smp5) were performed with DNA isolated from heterologous M types of group A streptococci, and the homologies detected by hybridization were compared with the ability of anti-pepM5 serum to cross-opsonize heterologous M types. As previously reported (J.R. Scott, S.K. Hollingshead, and V.A. Fischetti, Infect. Immun. 52:609-612, 1986), extensive structural homologies exist among the 3' ends of heterologous M protein genes, but there appears to be an increase in sequence variation as one moves towards the 5' ends. However, a clear, predictive correlation between the hybridization patterns and cross-opsonization was not observed. Antibodies raised to a synthetic peptide corresponding to central, conserved sequences adjacent to the C-terminal sides of the pepsin cleavage sites in M5, serotype 6 M protein, and serotype 24 M protein cross-reacted with heterologous acid-extracted M antigens but were not protective and did not bind to intact streptococcal cells, indicating that these epitopes are inaccessible on the intact cell surface. Removal of the N-terminal half of M5, serotype 6 M protein, or serotype 24 M protein by pepsin exposed the conserved epitope on the cell surface. These results suggest that immunoaccessible protective epitopes are confined to the highly variable N-terminal halves of M proteins and that a single, broadly conserved protective M protein epitope does not exist."

A 1-year prospective study of reliability and cost in primary care centres.,"The impact of introducing the rapid antigen detecting test for the diagnosis of group A streptococcal pharyngitis in primary care centres and the direct and comprehensive cost-effectiveness of four alternative strategies for the management of group A streptococcal pharyngitis and the prevention of rheumatic fever were assessed in a 1-year prospective randomized study, carried out in children between the ages of 5 and 14 years. Data from the study showed that the test was easy to perform and reliable when introduced as a service in primary care. The strategy of using the rapid antigen detecting test and a 10-day oral penicillin course for diagnosis and treatment proved to be the safest and most cost-effective. If compliance with a 10-day course of oral penicillin is unlikely to be achieved, the strategy of introducing the test and treatment by intramuscular benzathin penicillin G proved to be the second best cost-effective alternative. In developing countries, where acute rheumatic fever is still common and the cost of the test and a 10-day course of penicillin may prove to be formidable, a strategy of treating all children with pharyngitis with intramuscular benzathin penicillin G seems to be the most cost-effective. The strategy of diagnosing group A streptococcal pharyngitis on clinical grounds proved to be the worst."

One aim of strep-EURO was to improve the quality of GAS characterization by standardization of methods. An external quality assurance study (EQA) was therefore carried out to evaluate current global performance. Eleven strep-EURO and seven other streptococcal reference centers received a panel of 20 coded GAS isolates for typing. Conventional phenotypic typing (based on cell surface T and M protein antigens and opacity factor [OF] production) and molecular methods (emm gene typing) were used either as single or combined approaches to GAS typing. T typing was performed by 16 centers; 12 centers found one or more of the 20 strains nontypeable (typeability, 89%), and 11 centers reported at least one incorrect result (concordance, 93%). The 10 centers that tested for OF production achieved 96% concordance. Limited availability of antisera resulted in poor typeability values from the four centers that performed phenotypic M typing (41%), three of which also performed anti-OF typing (typeability, 63%); however, concordance was high for both M (100%) and anti-OF (94%) typing. In contrast, the 15 centers that performed emm gene sequencing achieved excellent typeability (97%) and concordance (98%), although comparison of the performance between centers yielded typeability rates from 65 to 100% and concordance values from 83 to 100%. With the rapid expansion and use of molecular genotypic methods to characterize GAS, continuation of EQA is essential in order to achieve international standardization and comparison of type distributions."

The N-terminal amino acid sequence of SPEX was found with LEVDNNSLLR to be identical to the recently described acidic superantigen SMEZ. Although SPEX/SMEZ genes were present in all of the streptococcal strains tested, a toxin production could only be detected in a small number of strains. The produced toxin concentration in the culture supernatants of positive strains differed between 0 and 20 ng ml(-1).

In the mouse, these ligands, collectively termed the peripheral lymph node addressin (PNAd), have been shown to contain fucose, sialic acid, and sulfate and to include several HEV glycoproteins including GlyCAM-1, CD34, and MAdCAM-1. Monoclonal antibody (MAb) MECA-79, which binds a sulfate-dependent epitope, recognizes PNAd in both mouse and man. In humans, only CD34 has been identified among the glycoprotein species that react with MECA-79. Although P-selectin is highly expressed in tonsil HEVs, it was not found to react with MECA-79 or to support L-selectin-mediated lymphocyte rolling. To further characterize human PNAd, MAbs were developed against purified PNAd immunoisolated from human tonsil. MAbs JG-1, JG-5, JG-9, and JG-10, like MECA-79, bind HEVs in human tonsil and react similarly in Western blots, and JG-9 and JG-10 also block lymphocyte rolling on purified PNAd. In addition, by competitive ELISA on purified tonsil PNAd, all MAbs were found to react with overlapping epitopes. However, JG-1, JG-5, JG-9, and JG-10 do not recognize mouse PNAd, and unlike MECA-79, they recognize determinants that are sensitive to neuraminidase. Strikingly, the epitope recognized by JG-1, although abundant in tonsil and peripheral lymph node, is absent from appendix HEVs or HEVs in some samples of chronically inflamed skin, even though these HEVs are MECA-79 reactive. Moreover, although JG-5 and JG-9 react well with tonsil, peripheral lymph node, and inflamed skin HEVs, they react only with occasional endothelial cells in appendix tissues. These findings point to significant diversity in the carbohydrate determinants expressed by HEVs and recognized by L-selectin and demonstrate their differential representation in different sites in vivo. These antibodies should be useful in probing the precise structure of human L-selectin ligands."

The annual incidence of invasive GAS (iGAS) bacteraemia showed a general increase during the study period, from 1.1 to 2.5 per 100 000 population. Serotype T28 remained among the most common serotypes, in addition to serotypes TB3264 and T1. The serotype T28 isolates were found to be distributed across six distinct emm types: emm28, emm77, emm53 (including subtypes 53.2 and 53.4), emm87, emm2 and emm4. The serotype distribution and the emm type distribution of serotype T28 fluctuated over time. Within the study period, the proportion of T28/emm28 isolates became the most prominent. During periods of low emm28 incidence, emm types 77 and 53 seemed to show a resurgence. emm typing revealed T28 isolates to be a genetically heterogeneous group harbouring a variety of distinct M proteins. This study confirms that T serotyping alone is not a sufficient method for epidemiological surveillance of iGAS."
CD010502,0,7591107,0,Mitogenicity of M5 protein extracted from Streptococcus pyogenes cells is due to streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin C and mitogenic factor MF.,"M proteins of Streptococcus pyogenes are virulence factors which impede phagocytosis, bind to many plasma proteins, and induce formation of cross-reactive autoimmune antibodies. Recently, it has been reported that some M proteins, extracted with pepsin from streptococci (pep M), are superantigens. One of these, pep M5, was investigated in detail and was shown to stimulate human T cells bearing V beta 2, V beta 4, and V beta 8. In the present study, we extracted and purified M5 protein by different biochemical methods from two M type 5 group A streptococcal strains. The crude extracts were fractionated by affinity chromatography and ion-exchange chromatography. All fractions were tested in parallel for M protein by immunoblotting and for T-cell-stimulating activity. Although several crude preparations of M5 protein were associated with mitogenicity for V beta 2 and V beta 8 T cells, the M5 proteins, irrespective of the extraction method, could be purified to the extent that they were no longer mitogenic. The mitogenic activity was not destroyed during the purification procedures but was found in fractions separated from M protein. In these fractions, streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin C and mitogenic factor MF could be detected by protein blotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Moreover, anti-M protein sera did not inhibit the mitogenic activity of crude extracts, but antisera which contained anti-streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin C antibodies showed inhibition. The inability of M5 protein to stimulate T cells was confirmed with recombinant pep M5 produced in Escherichia coli. Our data strongly suggest that the mitogenic activity in M protein preparations is caused by traces of streptococcal superantigens different from M protein."
CD010502,0,18541661,0,Screen for leukotoxin mutants in Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans: genes of the phosphotransferase system are required for leukotoxin biosynthesis.,"Aggregatibacter (formerly Actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans is a pathogen that causes localized aggressive periodontitis and extraoral infections including infective endocarditis. Recently, we reported that A. actinomycetemcomitans is beta-hemolytic on certain growth media due to the production of leukotoxin (LtxA). Based on this observation and our ability to generate random transposon insertions in A. actinomycetemcomitans, we developed and carried out a rapid screen for LtxA mutants. Using PCR, we mapped several of the mutations to genes that are known or predicted to be required for LtxA production, including ltxA, ltxB, ltxD, and tdeA. In addition, we identified an insertion in a gene previously not recognized to be involved in LtxA biosynthesis, ptsH. ptsH encodes the protein HPr, a phosphocarrier protein that is part of the sugar phosphotransferase system. HPr results in the phosphorylation of other proteins and ultimately in the activation of adenylate cyclase and cyclic AMP (cAMP) production. The ptsH mutant showed only partial hemolysis on blood agar and did not produce LtxA. The phenotype was complemented by supplying wild-type ptsH in trans, and real-time PCR analysis showed that the ptsH mutant produced approximately 10-fold less ltxA mRNA than the wild-type strain. The levels of cAMP in the ptsH mutant were significantly lower than in the wild-type strain, and LtxA production could be restored by adding exogenous cAMP to the culture."

In our study overlapping synthetic peptides copying the entire sequence of PepM5 protein were used to map the myosin cross-reactive epitopes of streptococcal M protein recognized by mouse and human mAb and affinity purified myosin-specific antibodies from acute rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease sera. Overlapping M protein peptides SM5(164-197)C and SM5(184-197)C inhibited the murine mAb reactions with PepM5 protein. The human mAb and affinity purified myosin-specific antibodies reacted exclusively with SM5(184-197)C. However, one of the five different purified myosin-specific antibodies not only reacted with SM5(184-197)C but also reacted with SM5(84-116)C. The synthetic subpeptides SM5(175-184)C and SM5(188-197C) did not react with any of the antibodies to PepM5 and myosin demonstrating a requirement of the 184-188 amino acid sequence for antibody recognition. A heptapeptide containing the sequence SM5(183-189) was also found to inhibit selected human myosin-specific antibodies and a human antimyosin mAb. Therefore, the majority of mouse and human myosin crossreactive antibodies recognized an epitope within the 14 residue carboxy terminus of PepM5 which appeared to involve the GLN-LYS-SER-LYS-GLN sequence."

Two collections of GAS type M49 strains isolated from invasive (22 strains) and noninvasive (16 strains) clinical cases have been studied for the presence of phage and phage-associated virulence genes. All the GAS strains carried from at least two to six phage genomes as determined by the number of known phage integrase genes found. A sampling of the invasive M49 strains showed that they belonged to the same multilocus sequence typing type, carried two specific integrase genes (int5 and int7), and contained the toxin genes speA, speH and speI. Other invasive strains lacking this gene profile carried the prophage integrating in mutL-mutS region and inducing the 'mutator' phenotype. We suggest that this specific phage-related virulence gene constellation might be an important factor increasing M49 GAS pathogenicity."
CD010502,0,21672083,0,Neonatal group B streptococcal disease: from pathogenesis to preventive strategies.,"Streptococcus agalactiae, or group B streptococcus (GBS), remains the leading cause of neonatal sepsis and meningitis, as early-onset or late-onset diseases (EOD, LOD). Where consensus guidelines to detect and treat intrapartum women with GBS colonization have been widely adopted, incidence of neonatal EOD has dramatically declined. In response to both successful impacts on the incidence of GBS-EOD and analyses of missed opportunities, the first American guidelines for prevention issued in the 1990s have since been adapted in several stages to improve their efficacy. In some countries in Europe, nationwide guidelines, whether screening-based or risk-based, for the prevention of neonatal GBS diseases have also been issued and adopted, with the expected impact on incidence of GBS-EOD. In spite of universal screening, in spite of the great progress that has been made, GBS-EOD continues to occur and the GBS burden remains a significant public health issue. Continuous efforts to improve screening for GBS status continue to be important and may be able to take advantage of new rapid diagnostic technologies. The current screening-based strategy for prevention is highly effective but imperfect. Given the challenges, limitations and potential complications of maternal intrapartum prophylaxis, a new approach is still needed. Maternal immunization against GBS is an attractive alternative for the prevention of not only neonatal diseases but also stillbirths and maternal diseases. Vaccines against GBS may become the most effective and sustainable long-term preventive strategy."

The average incidence rate was 3.1 cases per 100,000 individuals. The most prevalent sequence types (STs) were STs 52, 28, and 334. In association with emm types 28, 77, and 87, the serotype T-28 comprised 24.8% of the strains. emm types 28, 1, and 82 were dominating. In 2007, a sharp increase in the number of emm-6 strains was noted. All strains were sensitive to penicillin and quinupristin-dalfopristin, while 3.4% and 6.1% of the strains were resistant to macrolides and tetracycline, respectively. Furthermore, the emm-6 strains had intermediate susceptibility to ofloxacin. Isolates displayed a wide variety of gene profiles, as shown by the presence or absence of the Spe genes, smeZ, and ssa, but 48% of the isolates fell into one of three profiles. In most cases, an emm type was restricted to one gene profile. Although the incidence decreased during this study, invasive GAS disease still has a high endemic rate, with involvement of both established and emerging emm types displaying variability in virulence gene profiles as well as differences in gender and age group preferences."

CD010502,0,11823235,0,Production and targeting of the Brucella abortus antigen L7/L12 in Lactococcus lactis: a first step towards food-grade live vaccines against brucellosis.,"Brucella abortus is a facultative intracellular gram-negative bacterial pathogen that infects humans and animals by entry mainly through the digestive tract. B. abortus causes abortion in pregnant cattle and undulant fever in humans. The immunogenic B. abortus ribosomal protein L7/L12 is a promising candidate antigen for the development of oral live vaccines against brucellosis, using food-grade lactic acid bacteria (LAB) as a carrier. The L7/L12 gene was expressed in Lactococcus lactis, the model LAB, under the nisin-inducible promoter. Using different signals, L7/L12 was produced in cytoplasmic, cell-wall-anchored, and secreted forms. Cytoplasmic production of L7/L12 gave a low yield, estimated at 0.5 mg/liter. Interestingly, a secretable form of this normally cytoplasmic protein via fusion with a signal peptide resulted in increased yield of L7/L12 to 3 mg/liter; secretion efficiency (SE) was 35%. A fusion between the mature moiety of the staphylococcal nuclease (Nuc) and L7/L12 further increased yield to 8 mg/liter. Fusion with a synthetic propeptide (LEISSTCDA) previously described as an enhancer for heterologous protein secretion in L. lactis (Y. Le Loir, A. Gruss, S. D. Ehrlich, and P. Langella, J. Bacteriol. 180:1895-1903, 1998) raised the yield to 8 mg/liter and SE to 50%. A surface-anchored L7/L12 form in L. lactis was obtained by fusing the cell wall anchor of Streptococcus pyogenes M6 protein to the C-terminal end of L7/L12. The fusions described allow the production and targeting of L7/L12 in three different locations in L. lactis. This is the first example of a B. abortus antigen produced in a food-grade bacterium and opens new perspectives for alternative vaccine strategies against brucellosis."

However, hyperresponsiveness to cardiac antigens stemming from the shared antigenic determinants with streptococcal antigens is believed to play a role only in the pathogenesis of ARF. A Profile of IgM and IgG immune responses to soluble myocardial antigen (SMA) and myosin was evaluated in ARF, AGN and SAP. A modified ELISA measuring the area under curve (AUC) for quantitation of antibodies to SMA and rabbit muscle myosin was employed. Proteins in the SMA were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Immune responses to a major protein band of congruent to 205 kD, corresponding to the molecular weight of the heavy chain of cardiac myosin was also evaluated. In the ARF group while a significant elevation of both IgM and IgG anti-SMA antibody levels was observed, only antibodies of IgG isotype were elevated against rabbit muscle myosin and 205 kD protein of human cardiac tissue in comparison with normal controls, AGN and SAP groups. There was a significant positive correlation of antibodies against skeletal muscle myosin with antibodies against 205 kD protein of human cardiac tissue for both IgM and IgG specificities in ARF alone. The incidence of positive sera (values greater than mean + 2SD of control values) for IgM and IgG anti-SMA and antimyosin antibodies was higher in ARF than in AGN and SAP. None of the AGN and SAP sera had elevated levels of antibodies against SMA whereas low incidence of positive sera for antimyosin antibodies was observed in these groups. Although group A streptococcus etiology is associated with ARF, AGN and SAP, differential profiles of immune responses to cardiac antigens is observed in these diseases. Elevated IgG specific response to myosin and 205 kD cardiac protein was demonstrated in ARF and not in other groups with a similar etiology. It may be worthwhile, therefore to explore the possibility of using this as an additional parameter in diagnosis of ARF."
CD010502,0,8120408,0,Characterization of unique human TCR V beta specificities for a family of streptococcal superantigens represented by rheumatogenic serotypes of M protein.,"The M protein of Streptococcus pyogenes plays a major role in the virulence of these bacteria. Members of the M protein superfamily are characterized by the presence of tandem segments of repeated amino acid sequences. The NH2-terminal end of the M proteins is a hypervariable region that harbors the type-specific epitopes of the molecule. Pepsin cleaves the molecule into a highly conserved carboxyl terminal half and a variable amino terminal portion referred to as pep M. In some individuals, infection with certain serotypes of group A streptococci is followed by autoimmune disorders such as rheumatic fever and acute glomerulonephritis. The serotypes of M protein that show a high degree of association with acute rheumatic fever are referred to as rheumatogenic serotypes. We have reported that one such serotype, type 5, is a superantigen to human T cells, specifically stimulating T cells bearing V beta 2, V beta 4, and V beta 8 elements. Here we extend our studies by examining other rheumatogenic serotypes for superantigenic properties. Studies with types 6, 18, 19, and 24 M proteins revealed that they are all superantigens to human T cells. The specificity to V beta 4 was shared by the rheumatogenic M proteins tested; however, each pep M serotype has its unique characteristic set of V beta specificity and these are distinct from those reported for the streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins. The non-rheumatogenic serotype, pep M2, only stimulated V beta 2-bearing T cells. This study establishes that the structurally related M proteins represent a family of streptococcal superantigens analogous to the structurally related family of staphylococcal enterotoxin superantigens."

Some strains of group A streptococci (GAS) have preference for the throat and others for the skin depending on M protein type. A study in three remote communities provided 350 GAS isolates for emm sequence typing, 244 were also emm pattern typed. There was 100% correlation between emm sequence and pattern type. Patterns D and E (non-throat tropic) made up 71% of throat and 87% of skin isolates although patterns A-C (throat tropic) were more common in the throat than the skin (RR 2.3, 95% CI 1.4-3.8) whilst the opposite was found for pattern D (RR 2.2, 95% CI 1.7-3.0). Pattern E favoured the throat (RR 1.4, 95% CI 1.1-1.8). Where environmental factors predispose to skin infection, emm pattern types D and E prevail, whatever the recovery site."
CD010502,0,8613373,0,Colonization in the rectum and uterine cervix with group B streptococci may induce specific antibody responses in cervical secretions of pregnant women.,"We have studied the relationships between genital or rectal carriage of group B streptococci (GBS) with the levels of systemic and mucosal antibodies to GBS in 200 women at about week 17 of pregnancy. Secretions from the uterine cervix were collected with absorbent cylindrical wicks for quantification of antibody levels with whole cell enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. GBS were cultured from the cervix (with or without concomitant rectal colonization) of 13.5%, from the rectum (with or without concomitant cervical colonization) of 12%, and from both culture sites of 8.5% of the women. Serotypes Ia, II, and III were predominant. Compared with culture-negative women, the group of women colonized rectally had markedly elevated levels of both immunoglobulin A (IgA) and IgG antibodies to GBS in cervical secretions and also had a moderate but significant elevation of IgA antibodies in sera. Women colonized only in the cervix had increases of specific IgA and IgG antibodies in cervical secretions, but their serum antibody levels were not elevated. In cervical secretions, the increase in antibody levels in the groups of colonized women was most pronounced for the IgG isotype, indicating a mucosal immune response involving IgG as well as IgA. A close correlation was found among the levels of antibodies to each of the three GBS serotypes tested. Evidence for such cross-reacting antibodies to different serotypes of GBS, as well as to group A streptococci, was also obtained from absorption experiments. Altogether, our results show that undiluted secretions for antibody determination can be easily collected from the uterine cervix with absorbent wicks and demonstrate that colonization of GBS in the rectum and the uterine cervix may induce a systemic as well as a pronounced local immune response in the female genital tract. The findings may have implications for the development of a mucosal vaccine against GBS disease."
CD010502,0,7042747,0,Diagnosis of group A streptococcal infections directly from throat secretions.,"The diagnosis of group A streptococcal disease still relies on isolation of group A streptococcal strains on sheep blood agar followed by presumptive identification based on bacitracin sensitivity or the results of the more precise serogrouping methods such as the Lancefield precipitin test. A technique that would permit rapid identification of streptococcal infections directly from throat secretions would allow immediate appropriate antimicrobial therapy for the management of streptococcal infections to be started. We have been able to identify soluble group A antigen directly from throat secretions by using a latex agglutination test. In a clinical trial in which latex (Streptex group A) and conventional culturing techniques were used, 53 throat secretion cultures were tested: 26 were positive by both procedures, 5 were positive by culture only, 3 were positive by the latex agglutination test only, and 19 were negative by both tests."

This precipitate was removed by trypsin treatment of the extract and on addition of anti-M12 typing serum but not of five other typing sera to the extract. The streptococcal component responsible for this precipitate was eluted from a CM-cellulose ion exchange column at pH 6.5. These findings demonstrated that the precipitate was caused by the M12 antigen. Crossed immuno-electrophoresis of hot hydrochloric acid extracts of three different type 12 group A streptococci showed that the electrophoretic mobility of the M12 antigens was similar in the three extracts. A linear correlation was obtained between the concentration of the M12-antigen and the height of the precipitate obtained in the electro-immuno assay using different dilutions of a standard type 12 extract. M12 antigen could thus be quantitated by the electro-immuno assay. In quantitation experiments, uniformly prepared extracts of five randomly selected, freshly-isolated type 12 strains were found to contain from 130 to 1850% of M12 antigen, respectively (expressed in % of the content of the standard type 12 extract)."

We present 19 older patients, aged 13-72 (mean 44.7 years), with acute epiglottitis. A most important finding was the relatively long time from onset of symptoms until diagnosis, averaging 2.5 days. All the blood and throat cultures were negative, except for a single throat culture which yielded Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The most common presenting symptoms were severe sore-throat and dysphagia; half presented with some respiratory distress. Diagnosis was usually made on indirect laryngoscopy, but lateral X-ray of the soft tissues of the neck was found to be highly reliable. Treatment was usually conservative, including antibiotics, rehydration and steroids to alleviate edema.

CD010502,0,11876760,0,Age-dependent preference in human antibody responses to Streptococcus pneumoniae polypeptide antigens.,"Vulnerability to Streptococcus pneumoniae is most pronounced in children. The microbial virulence factors and the features of the host immune response contributing to this phenomenon are not completely understood. In the current study, the humoral immune response to separated Strep. pneumoniae surface proteins and the ability to interfere with Strep. pneumoniae adhesion to cultured epithelial cells were analysed in adults and in children. Sera collected from healthy adults recognized Strep. pneumoniae separated lectin and nonlectin surface proteins in Western blot analysis and inhibited on average 80% of Strep. pneumoniae adhesion to epithelial cells in a concentration-dependent manner. However, sera longitudinally collected from healthy children attending day care centres from 18 months of age and over the course of the following 2 years revealed: (a) development of antibodies to previously unrecognized Strep. pneumoniae surface proteins with age; (b) a quantitative increase in antibody responses, measured by densitometry, towards separated Strep. pneumoniae surface proteins with age; and (c) inhibition of Strep. pneumoniae adhesion to epithelial cells, which was 50% on average at 18 months of age, increased significantly to an average level of 80% inhibition at 42 months of age equalling adult sera inhibitory values. The results obtained in the current study, from the longitudinally collected sera from healthy children with documented repeated Strep. pneumoniae colonization, show that repeated exposures are insufficient to elicit an immune response to Strep. pneumoniae proteins at 18 months of age. This inability to recognize Strep. pneumoniae surface proteins may stem from the inefficiency of T-cell-dependent B-cell responses at this age and/or from the low immunogenicity of the proteins."

Levels of maternal serum IgG GBS Ia antibodies, measured by ELISAs in 45 case patients (neonates with EOD caused by GBS Ia) and in 319 control subjects (neonates colonized by GBS Ia but without EOD) born at > or =34 weeks gestation were compared. The probability of developing EOD declined with increasing maternal levels of IgG GBS Ia antibody (P = .03). Neonates whose mothers had levels of IgG GBS Ia antibody > or =5 microg/mL had an 88% lower risk (95% confidence interval, 7%-98%) of developing type-specific EOD, compared with those whose mothers had levels < 0.5 microg/mL. A vaccine that induces IgG GBS Ia antibody levels > or =5 microg/mL in mothers can be predicted to confer a high degree of type-specific immunity to EOD to their infants."

CD010502,0,20132182,0,Detection of invasive protein profile of Streptococcus pyogenes M1 isolates from pharyngitis patients.,"Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS) is a re-emerging infectious disease in Japan and many other developed countries. Epidemiological studies have revealed that the M1 serotype of Streptococcus pyogenes is the most dominant causative isolate of STSS. Recent characterization of M1 isolates revealed that the mutation of covS, one of the two-component regulatory systems, plays an important role in STSS by altering protein expression. We analyzed the M1 S. pyogenes clinical isolates before or after 1990 in Japan, using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). PFGE profiles were different between the isolates before and after 1990. Markedly different profiles among isolates after 1990 from STSS and pharyngitis patients were detected. Sequence analysis of two-component regulatory systems showed that covS mutations were detected not only in STSS but also in three pharyngitis isolates, in which proteins from the culture supernatant displayed the invasive type. The mutated CovS detected in the pharyngitis isolates had impaired function on the production of streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin B (SpeB) analyzed by 2-DE. These results suggest that several covS mutations that lead to the malfunction of the CovS protein occurred even in pharyngeal infection."
CD010502,0,11532146,0,Group A streptococcal phagocytosis resistance is independent of complement factor H and factor H-like protein 1 binding.,"Factor H (FH) and factor H-like protein 1 (FHL-1) regulate complement activation through the alternative pathway. Several extracellular bacterial pathogens, prime targets for the complement system, bind FH and FHL-1, thereby acquiring a potential mechanism for minimizing complement deposition on their surface. For group A streptococci (GAS), surface-bound antiphagocytic M proteins mediate the interaction. To study the role of the FH-FHL-1 interaction for complement deposition and opsonophagocytosis of GAS, we first constructed a set of truncated M5 protein variants and expressed them on the surface of a homologous M-negative GAS strain. Binding experiments with the resulting strains demonstrated that the major FH-FHL-1 binding is located in a 42-amino-acid region within the N-terminal third of M5. Measurement of bacteria-bound complement factor C3 after incubation in plasma showed that the presence of this region had little impact upon complement deposition through the alternative pathway. Moreover, streptococci expressing M5 proteins lacking the major FH and FHL-1 binding sequence resisted phagocytosis in human blood as efficiently as bacteria expressing the wild-type protein. Consequently, the data suggest that the binding of the regulators of the alternative pathway is of limited importance for GAS phagocytosis resistance."

Latex particle agglutination (LPA) tests are not approved for detection of GBS in HAF. Two LPA systems, Patho-Dx Strep B and Wellcogen Strep B, were used to test unfiltered sterile HAF and filtered HAF containing concentrations of GBS carbohydrate from 0.2 to 100 micrograms/ml. Four different processing techniques were used to prevent nonspecific LPA: EDTA, nitrous acid, enzyme, and nitrous acid-heat. GBS (10(2) CFU/ml) was inoculated into filtered HAF, incubated, sampled serially, processed with enzyme, and tested by LPA. Unprocessed, unfiltered HAF showed 33% nonspecific agglutination when tested by LPA. Processing of HAF removed nonspecific agglutination and improved GBS antigen detection. Without processing, LPA could not detect less than 100 micrograms of GBS carbohydrate per ml. With nitrous acid or enzyme processing, as little as 0.2 microgram/ml could be detected. Results were easier to read after enzyme processing than after nitrous acid processing. Although both LPA systems were equally efficient, testing was easier with the Patho-Dx system. After enzyme processing, LPA could detect as few as 10(4) CFU/ml when agglutination was read with a 4 X hand lens. Substances in HAF induce false-positive reactions during LPA testing. Processing removes the interference and improves the detection of GBS. LPA testing of HAF may allow earlier identification and treatment of infants at risk for serious GBS infection."

Geometric mean concentrations of alpha C-specific IgM and IgG were similar by ELISA in sera from 58 alpha C GBS strain colonized and 174 age-matched non-colonized women (IgG 245 and 313 ng/ml; IgM 257 and 229 ng/ml, respectively), but acute sera from 13 women with invasive alpha C-expressing GBS infection had significantly higher concentrations (IgM 383 and IgG 476 ng/ml [p=0.036 and 0.038, respectively]). Convalescent sera from 5 of these women 16-49 days later had high alpha C-specific IgM and IgG concentrations (1355 and 4173 ng/ml, respectively). In vitro killing of alpha C-expressing GBS correlated with total alpha C-specific antibody concentration. Invasive disease but not colonization elicits alpha C-specific IgM and IgG in adults."
CD010502,0,18817494,0,A remote fuzzy multicriteria diagnosis of sore throat.,"A sore throat (also known as pharyngitis or tonsillitis) is most commonly caused by a contagious viral infection (such as the flu, cold, or mononucleosis), although more serious throat infections can be caused by a bacterial infection (such as strep, mycoplasma, or Haemophilus). Bacterial sore throats respond well to antibiotics, whereas viral ones do not. However, strep throat remains a leading cause for physician visits, and researchers have long struggled to determine how best to treat it. The current practice guidelines offer different management options for adult patients presenting with a sore throat. Thus, when a physician treats a patient with acute pharyngitis, the clinical decision that usually needs to be made is whether the pharyngitis is attributable to group A streptococci. The key concern is the degree to which the clinical possibility of a group A streptococcal infection should affect clinician's decisions. To determine the best treatment of pharyngitis, we conducted a multicriteria decision analysis using fuzzy reasoning for remote health service delivery between a healthcare provider and patients. The approach can be adopted for interactive phone use or online system application. Five alternative treatment options were considered, particularly: (a) no test no Rx, (b) rapid strep, (c) culture, (d) rapid strep and culture, and (e) empiric Rx. Fuzzy reasoning is used to examine the signs/symptoms and their ratings. The study includes seven criteria factors that can be rated according to each alternative clinical treatment using linguistic statements. The model shows that no test no Rx is the best option for the cases of low prevalence of group A streptococcal infection. Two strategies--culture and treat if positive and rapid strep with culture of negative results--are equally preferable for patients with moderate prevalence likelihood. Rapid strep and culture of negative results is the best management strategy for patients with high population prevalence of group A streptococcal infection. In conclusion, the best clinical management of patients with sore throat depends on both the clinical probability of group A streptococcal infection and clinical judgments that incorporate the importance ratings of the individual patients as well as practice circumstances."
CD010502,0,19395219,0,"Macrolide resistance in Streptococcus pyogenes: prevalence, resistance determinants, and emm types.","To investigate the antimicrobial resistance trends and the distribution of emm types of group A streptococci (GAS), we examined 1160 clinical isolates of GAS collected between 2003 and 2006. Susceptibilities to commonly used antimicrobial agents were determined by Etest, and macrolide resistance genes were detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). GAS isolates were typed by polymerase chain reaction PCR and sequencing of emm gene. The rates of resistance to erythromycin (ERY), clindamycin, azithromycin, tetracycline, and chloramphenicol were 14.9%, 1.4%, 14.9%, 18.9%, 0.6%, respectively. None of the isolates exhibited resistance to penicillin, ceftriaxone, linezolid, moxifloxacin, rifampicin, or vancomycin. Macrolide resistance increased from 12.1% in 2003 to 18.8% in 2006 (P = 0.02). Of 173 ERY-resistant GAS isolates, 93 (53.7%) harbored the mefA gene, 70 (40.4%) the ermA, and 10 (5.8%) the ermB. Eighty percent of the observed emm types are covered by the proposed 26-valent GAS vaccine. Among 173 ERY-resistant isolates, the predominant emm types were 12 (19.5%), 77 (17.9%), and 4 (16.8%), and among 770 ERY-susceptible isolates, the predominant types were 1 (18.8%), 12 (17.5%), 28 (13.8%). The observed antimicrobial resistance trends and the distribution of specific emm types have implications in guiding empiric therapy and in developing vaccine strategies to prevent GAS infections."

CD010502,0,3511784,1,Rapid diagnosis of group A strep pharyngitis in the emergency department.,"Two ten-minute rapid tests for diagnosing Group A streptococcal pharyngitis in 147 emergency department patients with a complaint of sore throat were evaluated using positive throat cultures as the marker for disease. Treatment was initiated solely on the basis of clinical judgment. Sensitivity and specificity were 78% and 93%, respectively, for the rapid test and 69% and 56%, respectively, for clinical judgment. The rapid test was significantly better than clinical judgment alone in determining the presence of disease (P less than .05). The predictive values of the positive and negative and were 78% and 93%, respectively, for the rapid test and 38% and 85%, respectively, for clinical judgment. In the ED setting in which adequate followup is difficult, the rapid test can identify more accurately than can clinical judgment alone those patients who need therapy."

Technologic advances in molecular biology, not thought possible two decades ago, have given additional insight into the immunologic aspects of the disease. On the clinical side echocardiography has proved to be a marvelous, non-invasive technique to evaluate cardiac anatomy and function. We are now able to gain a closer correlation of the clinical presentation and the autoimmune response.

CD010502,0,10076836,0,Immunoreagents based on polymer dispersions for immunochemical assays.,"Immunoreagents based on polymer dispersions consisting of unimodal polyacrolein (PAL) microspheres with diameters in the range 0.3-2.0 microns have been prepared and evaluated by various immunoassay techniques such as immunoradiometric assay of ferritin and microtitre particle agglutination and immunofiltration dot assay of group-specific polysaccharide of S. pyogenes (A-PS) in comparison with conventional carriers and methods. The antibodies were covalently or indirectly bound to the PAL. The coupled antibodies to ferritin retained a high average affinity (Ka = 4.5 x 10(9) M-1). In comparison with microcrystalline cellulose-based immunosorbent, more than an order-of-magnitude lower amount of PAL-IgG was necessary for the analysis of ferritin. Use of PAL-IgG gave a higher sensitivity of assay with a detection limit of 0.7 x 10(-13) M l-1 and a wider concentration range of antigen detection (about four orders of magnitude) without manifestation of the high-dose hook effect. Particle agglutination assay of A-PS in microtitre plate was shown to be a simple, demonstrative and highly sensitive one-step analytical method with a detection limit of 0.05 ng A-PS/ml or 10(4) cells/ml. The sensitivity of immunofiltration assay using both enzyme and latex markers was shown to be approximately the same (50 ng A-PS/ml) and the duration of the assay was 3-5 min. No cross-reaction of latex conjugates with non-A Streptococcus cell lysates were observed."
CD010502,0,2565813,0,Reliable five-minute test strip method for identification of Streptococcus pyogenes.,"A novel and rapid method (Strep Strip, Lab M) for identification of Streptococcus pyogenes was evaluated. The method combines the established test for pyroglutamyl aminopeptidase (PYR) with a rapid chromogenic test for beta-glucosidase on a paper strip. The test was evaluated with 274 clinical isolates and 237 culture collection isolates of beta-haemolytic streptococci. Streptococcus pyogenes was identified with 100% specificity. Six isolates identified as Lancefield group A and which might therefore be assumed to be Streptococcus pyogenes were shown by the test strip method not to be this species. The beta-glucosidase test on the test strip allowed differentiation between enterococci and Streptococcus pyogenes (both PYR positive) in all cases. The test strip method represents an economical and accurate method for identification of Streptococcus pyogenes in clinical material."

CD010502,0,3534131,0,Conversion of an M- group A streptococcus to M+ by transfer of a plasmid containing an M6 gene.,"An M28-derived group A streptococcal strain deleted for the gene encoding M protein was converted to M+ by introduction of a plasmid carrying emm6, the structural gene for type 6 M protein from strain D471. The reconstituted M+ strain, JRS2, resists phagocytosis in human blood and is opsonized by anti-M6 hyperimmune serum, but not by anti-M28 serum. Immunofluorescent microscopy and ELISA demonstrate the presence of M protein on its surface. In addition, JRS2 removes opsonic antibodies from hyperimmune rabbit sera generated by immunization with purified ColiM6 protein and with a synthetic amino-terminal peptide derived from M6. Immunization of rabbits with JRS2 generates opsonic anti-M6 antibodies. These results indicate that the cloned emm6 gene contains the information necessary to convert a phagocytosis-sensitive streptococcus to phagocytosis resistance. Furthermore, it also contains the determinants for M type specificity and those required to elicit opsonic antibodies. It thus appears to determine all the traits associated with M protein."
CD010502,0,11687448,0,Antibodies against Streptococcus agalactiae proteins c(alpha) and R4 in sera from pregnant women from Norway and Zimbabwe.,"Group B streptococci (GBS) express strain-variable and surface-localized proteins, which are important serotype markers and targets of protective antibodies. These include the c(alpha) and R4 proteins, one or the other of which is expressed by approximately 75% of clinical GBS isolates. These proteins have been considered vaccine candidates. In this study, the c(alpha) and R4 proteins were extracted by trypsin digestion of GBS and purified by sequential precipitation with trichloroacetic acid and ammonium sulfate followed by gel filtration chromatography. The proteins were used as antigens in an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to measure the levels of c(alpha)- and R4-reactive antibodies in sera from pregnant women from Norway (n = 100) and from Zimbabwe (n = 124). Antibody levels in the Norwegian group of women were significantly higher than in the Zimbabwean group, and a higher proportion of the Norwegian women contained appreciable levels of antibodies against both proteins. The antibodies traversed the placental barrier. With individual sera, a significant correlation between the anti-c(alpha) and anti-R4 antibody levels was observed and each of the two protein antigens effectively competed for human serum antibodies both against itself and against the other antigen. Inhibition ELISA results demonstrated specificity for each of the proteins of immune antibodies raised in rabbits. These results demonstrate that (i) the majority of women of childbearing age have antibodies against c(alpha) and R4, (ii) the levels of these antibodies differ among pregnant women in different parts of the world, and (iii) the normal human serum antibodies may target a common c(alpha) and R4 protein site, whereas immune antibodies targeted a different site(s) specific for each protein."

Antigen detection tests for Haemophilus influenzae type b meningitis are of value primarily as an adjunct to traditional procedures, whereas antigen detection tests for the rapid diagnosis of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis could, in the near future, replace the blood agar culture. This comparison demonstrates that the evaluation of a new diagnostic test should include not only a determination of its accuracy, but, in addition, a determination of its advantages over current methods, the frequency with which the test will be performed, the consequences of a false-negative or false-positive test result, and the potential impact on patient care resulting from use of the test."

The serum IgG antibody levels to alpha-streptococci, Str. sanguis and Str. salivarius were significantly higher in patients with PPP (n = 44) than in patients with recurrent tonsillitis (RT: n = 25) and in healthy adults (n = 17). Serum antibody IgG level to Str. pyogenes was not different among the 3 groups. The IgA antibody levels against any Streptococcus strain were not different among the 3 groups. The IgM antibody levels to Str. pyogenes were significantly higher in patients with RT than in patients with PPP. In western blot analysis, the serum IgG antibodies against 25-27 kDa protein from whole cell body of Str. sanguis, Str. salivarius and Str. mitis were found more frequently in patients with PPP than in healthy adults. However, the western blot profile in Str. pyogenes was not different between PPP and healthy adults. No significant difference was seen in the western blot profile of IgM or IgM antibodies to any streptococcal whole cell bodies. These data suggest that systemic hyper immune response to alpha-streptococci may be present in patients with tonsil-related PPP and the 25-27 kDa protein of the organism may be the target for this immunologic abnormality."

The antibody PM II 40 recognized a protective epitope on a glomerulonephritis-associated M type 1 strain. A 23 kD streptococcal surface protein extracted by limited pepsin digestion reacted with PM II 40 in the Western immunoblot. The aminoterminal sequence of this peptide was identical to the known aminoterminal amino acid sequence of type 1 M protein. Human renal podocytes carry the cross-reactive antigen of the antibody PM II 40 as could be shown by electron microscopy. The podocytes cultured from isolated human glomeruli showed a fibrillar pattern with the antibody in the immunofluorescence test. An anti-vimentin antibody and the antibody PM II 40 recognized the same proteins with molecular weights of 54, 52 and 43 kD of SDS-extracted isolated human glomeruli suggesting that vimentin is the glomerular antigen. The antibody PM II 40 not only react with vimentin but also with desmin suggesting that the recognized epitopes are distinct from that described by Kraus et al. for vimentin and type 1 M protein."
CD010502,0,10155274,0,"Economic evaluation of immunoprophylaxis in children with recurrent ear, nose and throat infections.","This study compares the costs of immunoprophylaxis versus no immunoprophylaxis in children with recurrent ear, nose and throat (ENT) infections (otitis media and rhinopharyngitis) using ribosomal immunotherapy ('Ribomunyl'). The per-patient cost of ribosomal immunotherapy (FF297) is offset by direct savings garnered through the prevention of many acute infectious episodes. The net 6-month per-patient savings associated with immunoprophylaxis range from FF272 to FF1704, depending on the indication and the type of treatment-cost estimate. Saved healthcare resources include physician consultations and visits, laboratory tests, medicotechnical services (audiometric tests) and antibiotic therapy. Sensitivity analysis of efficacy and treatment-cost estimates enabled threshold ranges of incremental efficacy to be identified. Cost-equivalence between the 2 treatment options was found to exist when the incremental efficacy of immunoprophylaxis lay between 7.4 and 17.5% (recurrent otitis media), and between 8.9 and 26.1% (recurrent rhinopharyngitis). Thus, even when clearly lower incremental efficacy rates than those reported in controlled clinical trials (approximately 40 to 60%) are assumed, ribosomal immunotherapy can still be expected to be cost effective. An analysis of the perspectives of the various payers in the French healthcare system demonstrated that net savings occurred for all payers involved. However, social security insurance would gain most from an immunoprophylaxis programme. Based on the evidence presented here for France, physicians and payers should give increased attention to this treatment option."

CD010502,0,19845763,0,Antibiofilm activity of coral-associated bacteria against different clinical M serotypes of Streptococcus pyogenes.,"Streptococcus pyogenes is the frequent cause of purulent infections in humans. Formation of a biofilm is one of the important aspects of its pathogenicity. Streptococcus pyogenes biofilm communities tend to exhibit significant tolerance to antimicrobial challenge during infections. Exploring novel targets against biofilm-forming pathogens is therefore an important alternative treatment measure. We attempted to screen marine bacteria, especially coral-associated bacteria (CAB), for antibiofilm activity against streptococcal biofilm formation. The bacterial biofilms were quantified by crystal violet staining. Of 43 CAB isolates, nine clearly demonstrated antibiofilm activity. At biofilm inhibitory concentrations (BIC), biofilm formation was reduced up to 80%, and sub-BIC (0.5 and 0.25 BIC) significantly reduced biofilm formation by up to 60% and 40-60%, respectively. Extracts of Bacillus horikoshii (E6) displayed efficient antibiofilm activity. As quorum sensing (QS) and cell surface hydrophobicity (CSH) are crucial factors for biofilm formation in S. pyogenes, the CAB were further screened for QS inhibition properties and CSH reduction properties. This study reveals the antibiofilm and QS inhibition property of CAB."

We present 10 patients with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) associated with Group A beta hemolytic streptococcal infection. The clinical phenotype was novel, with 50% having a dystonic extrapyramidal movement disorder, and 70% a behavioral syndrome. None of the patients had rheumatic fever or Sydenham's chorea. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, Western immunoblotting, and immunohistochemistry were used to detect ABGA. Neurological (n = 40) and streptococcal (n = 40) controls were used for comparison. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay results showed significantly elevated ABGA in the patients with poststreptococcal ADEM. Western immunoblotting demonstrated ABGA reactivity to three dominant protein bands of 60, 67, or 80 kDa; a finding not reproduced in controls. Fluorescent immunohistochemistry demonstrated specific binding to large striatal neurones, which was not seen in controls. Streptococcal serology was also significantly elevated in the poststreptococcal ADEM group compared with neurological controls. Magnetic resonance imaging studies showed hyperintense basal ganglia in 80% of patients with poststreptococcal ADEM, compared to 18% of patients with nonstreptococcal ADEM.

A total of 124 beta-hemolytic streptococcal isolates were tested, which included 77 from group A, 15 from group B, 10 from group C, 1 from group F, and 21 from group G. All were tested from subculture, and 74 (60%) were also tested from primary isolation plates. For Meritec-Strep, usually one colony was directly applied to the reaction card for testing each grouping reagent, while for Streptex, five colonies were tested after a 1-h extraction process. Complete agreement was obtained for all isolates tested from subculture with the kits. From primary isolation plates, Meritec-Strep correctly identified 97.3% of the isolates compared with 94.6% correctly identified for Streptex. Meritec-Strep produced a false-negative for one group A isolate and positive reactions for group A and F reagents with another group A isolate. A diphtheroid contaminant caused the positive group F reaction. Streptex produced false-negative results for one group A and three group C isolates. Most positive reactions were strong and rapid (less than 30 s) for both kits. The negative test control provided in the individual group A and B kits was nonreactive for all isolates. Meritec-Strep accurately identified isolated colonies of beta-hemolytic streptococci on primary isolation and subculture plates. It provided faster results than Streptex by eliminating the time and manipulation of antigen extraction and needed fewer colonies when individual group A or B reagents were used."

Comparative studies were performed in which specimens were inoculated in parallel into BHK-21 hamster kidney cells, which were examined by IP staining at 5 days, and into BK-13 and BS-C-1 cells, which were examined in two ways, viz., by subpassage at 7 days into BHK-21 cells and IP staining 3 days later and by subpassage at 7 days into BS-C-1 cells followed by interference testing and immunofluorescence (IF) staining on positive materials (standard method). Direct inoculation into BHK-21 cells with IP staining at 5 days permitted detection and identification of 59% of the 63 positive specimens. Toxicity of some specimens preserved with sorbitol and of certain tissue specimens reduced the number of satisfactory examinations which could be performed in this system. Virus detection and identification by IP staining on subpassaged RK-13 and BS-C-1 materials, requiring a total of 18 days, was comparable to the longer interference-IF method, requiring 17 days. Results obtained by IP staining and interference-IF showed 98% correlation on RK-13 materials and 97% correlation on BS-C-1 materials. IP staining on inoculated BHK-21 cells can be a useful method for rapid identification of a relatively high proportion of rubella-positive specimens, particularly if sorbitol-preserved specimens are avoided, and IP staining on subpassaged RK-13 and BS-C-1 materials is a highly satisfactory alternative to the longer interference-IF method."

Although this strain harbours the speA gene and is efficiently internalized by human epithelial cells, clinical isolates often fail to express the erythrogenic toxin under laboratory growth conditions. Cultures of strain 90-131 were observed to phase vary between small, dry, compact and larger, more mucoid colonies. The former were shown to be poorly internalized by epithelial cells. Analysis of RNA by Northern hybridization demonstrated that the emml, hasA and speA genes were weakly transcribed in cultures derived from the small colonies and highly transcribed in those derived from the large colonies. An insertion mutation in mga (the multigene activator) downregulated the invasion of epithelial cells and the transcription of emm1 and hasA, but had little impact on the transcription of speA. These are the first data to suggest the existence of a common regulatory circuit linking intracellular invasion, M protein, hyaluronic acid capsule and erythrogenic toxin expression by group A streptococcus. Moreover, the genetic instability of toxin expression exhibited by this serotype may impact on laboratory studies that attempt to associate toxin production with toxic shock."

CD010502,0,7927767,0,Analysis of the role of M24 protein in group A streptococcal adhesion and colonization by use of omega-interposon mutagenesis.,"We recently concluded that M protein mediates adherence of group A streptococci to HEp-2 tissue culture cells, because the N-terminal half of M protein blocked adherence and M+ strains attached in greater numbers than M- streptococci. To further assess the role of M protein in adhesion, an M-, isogenic mutant of M type M-, isogenic mutant of M type 24 group A streptococci was constructed by insertional inactivation of the emm24 gene with the omega-interposon flanked by emm24 gene sequences. Southern blot analysis confirmed that the omega-element inserted only into emm24. The M- isogenic mutant M24-omega 3 did not react with antiserum to M24 protein, not did it survive in whole human blood. Electron micrographs of M24-omega 3 showed a diminution of surface fibrillae and reduced binding of plasma components compared with the parent strain. The adhesion of the M+ parent to HEp-2 cells and to mouse oral epithelial cells was dramatically greater than the adhesion of the M24-omega 3 mutant, although there was no difference between the two in adhesion to human buccal cells. In addition, the parent strain was dramatically more effective than the M24-omega 3 mutant in colonizing the oral cavity of mice. These results indicate that the M24 protein can serve as an adhesin in streptococcal attachment to human cells in tissue culture and is important in the colonization of mouse mucosal surfaces."
CD010502,0,18337173,0,A possible role of histone-like DNA-binding protein of Streptococcus intermedius in the pathogenesis of bile duct damage in primary biliary cirrhosis.,"Bacterial infection has become a focus of attention in the pathogenesis of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC). It was reported that anti-histone autoantibody was detected in PBC, suggesting that bacterial histone-like DNA-binding protein (HLP) may be involved in the pathogenesis of PBC. To identify bacterial species in PBC to confirm this possibility, serum reactivity to bacterial cells was studied by ELISA. The IgM class Streptococcus intermedius titers were significantly higher in PBC than chronic hepatitis due to hepatitis C virus (CH-C) and healthy subjects. Among the streptococci, S. intermedius was selected for further study. The antigenic peptide of S. intermedius of HLP was synthesized to examine the serum reactivity to Si-HLP. IgM class anti-Si-HLP peptide titers were significantly higher in PBC. Immunoreactivity to anti-Si-HLP was detected in the cytoplasm of biliary epithelial cells and inflammatory cells in the portal area in PBC patients' livers. Streptococci, especially S. intermedius, might play a key role in the pathogenesis of PBC, possibly involving HLP."
CD010502,0,12111911,0,The predictive value of microbiologic diagnostic tests if asymptomatic carriers are present.,"If a proper gold standard is not available, then the predictive value of a test cannot be estimated. In this paper the concept of etiologic predictive value (EPV) is introduced. It is a quantity that will yield the predictive value of a test to predict presence of a specified disease in situations for which no proper gold standard is available. This is achieved by using information obtained from a healthy control population. This quantity requires that the marker in our test is present in all individuals having the specified disease, as in the case where the marker is the aetiologic factor for the specified disease. Furthermore this quantity requires that asymptomatic carriers are present. This means that not all individuals with the marker has the specified disease. EPV is developed with special reference to the evaluation of bacterial cultures, or rapid tests to detect a bacterium, but the quantity might be used in other circumstances as well. EPV is applied to an example in which conventional throat culture is evaluated. Further information concerning EPV can be found at http://www.infovice.se/fou/epv."

The ratio of polymeric IgA (p-IgA) to total IgA was calculated from the formula, the p-IgA index = IgA activity after absorption/IgA activity before absorption. In early-convalescent-phase sera from primary cases, the p-IgA indices were 0.5-0.9, whereas in recurrent or provoked cases, they were lower than 0.2. There results indicate that the p-IgA index may be useful for rapid and simple differentiation of primary from non-primary HSV infections."
CD010502,0,8997476,0,Chemoprophylaxis for group B streptococcus transmission in neonates.,"GBS causes infection in 1.35-5.4 neonates per 1000 live births. Early-onset GBS infection in neonates develops rapidly and has a high mortality rate. Preventing the transmission of GBS to neonates is of considerable value to avert neonatal morbidity and mortality. Although some controversy exists regarding who should receive chemoprophylaxis and when, AAP guidelines suggest that all pregnant women be screened between 26 and 28 weeks' gestation for GBS colonization by obtaining swabs form vagina and anorectal areas and culturing them or testing by rapid antigen test. According to the latest guidelines from the CDC, any pregnant woman who tests positive for GBS and who has one or more risk factors should be given intrapartum penicillin 5 million units i.v. as the first dose and then 2.5 million units q6h until delivery. Ampicillin, in a dosage of 2 g as the first dose and then 1 g every 4-6 hours may be used as an alternative. Patients who are allergic to penicillin can be given either erythromycin 500 mg i.v. q6h or clindamycin 600 mg i.v. q8h. The chemoprophylaxis is primarily effective for early-onset GBS infection; for late-onset infection, aggressive treatment of the neonate should be initiated promptly with ampicillin and gentamicin. Although many studies have been published that establish the efficacy of ampicillin for intrapartum GBS prophylaxis, there is a need for large-scale studies to show the efficacy of both erythromycin and clindamycin. Various vaccines are under development for maternal administration to prevent the transmission of GBS to neonates. When one is available, it will be an added weapon against GBS."
CD010502,0,2443452,0,Expression of M type 12 protein by a group A streptococcus exhibits phaselike variation: evidence for coregulation of colony opacity determinants and M protein.,"Three major categories of colony opacity were observed for natural variants of the M type 12 (M12) group A streptococcus strain CS24. Colony opacity variants that switched between two alternative categories at significantly high frequencies were identified and are referred to as switching between more opaque (Op+) and less opaque (Op-) phenotypes. Twenty lineages of such variants were derived for analysis and were assessed for resistance to phagocytosis, acid-extractable M12 antigen, and M12 mRNA, criteria which define the M protein-positive phenotype (M+). Transition from the M+ to the M protein-negative phenotype (M-) correlated with a change from Op+ to Op-. Reversion to the Op+ phenotype was accompanied by reversion to the M+ state in all variants except one and occurred at a higher frequency than the forward M+ to M- switch. These data demonstrate the existence of M12 protein phaselike switching in the group A streptococcus strain CS24. The discovery of an Op+ M- revertant confirmed that colony opacity and M protein can be expressed independently and are distinct gene products. We suggest that coregulation of colony opacity and M protein expression accounts for their association among descendents of strain CS24. Southern blot hybridization analyses of digested genomic DNA from 27 M- variants and 15 M+ revertants were performed with DNA probes containing M12 protein and adjacent upstream sequences. DNA deletions were identified only in two stable M- variants, approximately 1.3 and 1.4 kilobases upstream from the M12 gene, respectively, whereas all unstable M- variants lacked detectable rearrangements. This suggests that deletions within or adjacent to the structural gene are unlikely to be responsible for the reversible switch in M protein expression. However, the association with the stable M- phenotype and the location of these deletions, as well as two other deletions, approximately 0.5 kilobase upstream from the M12 promoter in two previously described variants of strain CS24 suggests that a second gene product is required for full expression of M12 protein synthesis in this strain."
CD010502,0,2443450,0,Monoclonal antibody to human renal glomeruli cross-reacts with streptococcal M protein.,"Two murine monoclonal antibodies (immunoglobulin M) evoked against human kidney tissue were examined for cross-reactivity with group A streptococci. A glomerulus-specific antibody, PMII.40.H.2, cross-reacted in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with purified pepsin-extracted M proteins from type 6 and 12 streptococci, but not type 1, 3, 5, 19, and 24 M proteins. The cross-reactive monoclonal antibody also opsonized type 6 and 12 streptococci, indicating that it was directed against protective M protein epitopes that were exposed on the surfaces of these organisms. A control antibody, which was tubule specific, did not cross-react with any of the purified M proteins, nor did it opsonize any of the serotypes of streptococci tested. Western immunoblot experiments identified the glomerular cross-reactive antigen as a 43-kilodalton protein. The results demonstrate that M protein of group A streptococci and glomerular antigens of the human kidney possess cross-reactive determinants."

CD010502,0,8390824,0,Time-resolved fluoroimmunoassays with monoclonal antibodies for rapid identification of parainfluenza type 4 and mumps viruses.,"Monoclonal antibodies were prepared to the F and M proteins of parainfluenza 4A and 4B and to mumpsvirus to obtain reagents that could be configured into type-specific yet broadly-reactive IFA, EIA, and TR-FIA tests. Several antibodies to parainfluenza 4A also detected subtype 4B, although to a somewhat lower signal, and thus were well suited to generic parainfluenza type 4 tests that were comparable to similar tests previously described for parainfluenza types 1, 2, and 3. Monoclonals to subtype 4B were less able to detect 4A because of high background problems in one or another test. Monoclonals to mumpsvirus F protein were completely type-specific. These antibodies were screened by IFA and EIA for broad reactivity with diverse strains of each virus and were configured into optimized EIA and TR-FIA tests. The all-monoclonal tests were then compared to polyclonal tests in terms of their ability to detect virus in clinical specimens. The all-monoclonal TR-FIA was uniformly the most sensitive, detecting virus in 80% of culture-positive parainfluenza 4A specimens, 67% of parainfluenza 4B specimens, and 90% of mumps specimens, compared to 40-67% for the monoclonal EIA tests and 33-60% for the polyclonal EIA tests. For parainfluenza 4 TR-FIA, mean P/N values were 379 for subtype 4A cell culture fluids (228 for subtype 4B cultures) and 57 for 4A clinical specimens (43 for 4B specimens). For mumpsvirus TR-FIA, mean P/N values were 27 for culture fluids and 32 for clinical specimens. The sensitivities of the TR-FIA were determined with purified virus to be 0.28 ng virus per well for parainfluenza 4A and 0.70 ng virus per well for mumpsvirus."
CD010502,0,2451662,0,"Complete amino acid sequence of streptococcal PepM49 protein, a nephritis-associated serotype. Conserved conformational design among sequentially distinct M protein serotypes.","The complete amino acid sequence of PepM49, a peptic fragment of the group A streptococcal type 49 M protein, the antiphagocytic cell surface molecule of the bacteria, is described. This fragment retains the opsonic antibody epitope of the native molecule. The sequence of PepM49, as determined by automated Edman degradations of the uncleaved molecule, and its tryptic and chymotryptic peptides, consists of a total of 143 residues (Mr = 17,187). PepM49, a nephritis-associated M protein serotype, exhibits significant internal homology in its sequence. However, identical sequence repeats of the kind seen in the rheumatic fever-associated serotypes M5, M6, and M24, are absent in PepM49. PepM49 exhibits varying degrees of homology with the M5, M6, and M24 proteins, which is consistent with the existence of variable and conserved regions in the M protein molecule. Predictive analysis as well as CD measurements revealed a high propensity of the PepM49 molecule to assume an alpha-helical conformation. Furthermore, a heptad periodicity of the nonpolar residues, a characteristic of alpha-helical coiled-coil proteins, extends over the entire length of the PepM49 protein. The differences in the nonpolar residue distribution divide the PepM49 sequence into three distinct domains, similar to those seen earlier in the M5 and M6 proteins. Together, these studies establish a conserved conformational design for the sequentially diverse M protein serotypes. However, the pattern of heptad periodicity in the PepM49 protein is quite distinct from that present in the PepM5 and M6 proteins, suggesting distinct differences in structural features among conformationally similar M protein serotypes. This may have relevance to the pathological differences associated with these M protein serotypes."

Early onset disease showed the following clinical characteristics: 1. frequent lack of risk factors for infection in obstetric history, 2. very early onset of symptoms of respiratory distress, 3. rapid development of shock after only minor or missing clinical signs of infection, and 4. unspecific findings on chest radiography. Neutropenia or marked leukocyte left shift as well as the presence of gram-positive cocci in gastric or tracheal aspirate proved to be useful diagnostic clues. The latex agglutination test for the detection of GBS-antigen in urine yielded in our hands many false positive results and unspecific reactions. Given the big difficulties of early diagnosis of early onset GBS-sepsis, the relatively liberal use of antibiotics in newborns with respiratory distress is probably unavoidable. Hereby prior culturing of blood and early termination of antibiotic therapy with negative cultures (of blood, CSF, tracheal aspirate) seems essential to us. The clinical significance of newer therapeutic (granulocyte transfusions, exchange transfusions, immunoglobulins) and prophylactic (intra-partum antibiotics, vaccination) modalities is according to the current literature still not clear in many respects."

We performed genetic emm sequence and serological T-antigen typing of 819 mostly invasive GAS isolates recovered in Israel during 1996-2005. Of the 72 emm types found, the six most prevalent types (1, 81, 89, 14, 28, 5) comprised 30.2% of all isolates, and emm-type changes were observed over the years. The predicted coverage of the 26-valent S. pyogenes vaccine formulated for usage in the USA was predicted to be only approximately 60%. On the basis of different emm-T antigen type associations, some Israeli strains are probably different clonal types than those found in USA. About 2% of GAS had emm types that were originally associated with S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis emm genes. Therefore, routine emm typing allows meaningful GAS strain surveillance, and provides data relevant to better vaccine coverage."
CD010502,0,15615463,0,[Value of a rapid test for identification of beta-hemolytic streptococcus antigens in children with streptococcal pharyngitis].,"Beta-hemolytic group A streptococcus (Streptococcus pyogenes) is the most common bacterial agent associated with the upper respiratory tract infections in humans. The most frequently group A streptococcus-associated disease is pharyngitis. Males and females are equally affected by group A streptococcus. There is seasonal increase in the prevalence of group A streptococcus-associated pharyngitis. Streptococcal pharyngitis is most prevalent in winter and early spring with higher incidence of disease observed in crowded population such as school children. Early diagnosis and treatment of group A streptococcal pharyngitis has been shown to reduce the severity of symptoms and further complications such as rheumatic fever and glomerulonephritis. The conventional methods used for identification of group A streptococci depend on isolation and identification of the organism on blood agar plates. These methods usually require 18-24 hours of incubation at 37 degrees C. Such delay in identifying the group A streptococcus has often made physicians to administer therapy without first disclosing the etiological agent. Development of immunologic tests, capable of detecting the group A streptococcal antigen directly from the throat swabs, produced rapid test results employed for better treatment of patients. STREP A test is a rapid immunochromatographic test for the detection of group A streptococci from throat swabs or culture. The accuracy of the test does not depend on the organism viability. Instead, group A strep antigen is extracted directly from the swab and identified using antibodies specific for the group A carbohydrates. We compared rapid test with conventional throat swab in 40 children, who met Centor criteria for streptococcal pharyngitis (absence of cough, high fever, purulent pharyngitis, enlarged and painful cervica lymph nodes). Overall congruence of rapid test and culture was 94%. Test is easy to perform and it is recommended as the first diagnostic test for management of children with streptococcal pharyngitis. In children with negative test, but with characteristics highly suggestive of streptococcal infection, throat culture should be performed."

A protein(s) near a molecular mass of 60 kDa in extracts of five group A streptococcal serotypes and the M-negative strain reacted with the MAbs. A study of human antibody responses to purified membranes of S. pyogenes indicated a hyperreactivity to a 60-kDa protein in acute rheumatic fever. Since MAbs 36.2.2 and 54.2.8 are known to cross-react with myosin or actin and streptococcal M protein, the data suggest that a homology or conformation is shared between the 60-kDa antigen and M protein. Therefore, the 60-kDa antigen is a new heart- or tissue-cross-reactive antigen of S. pyogenes that shares immunologic epitopes with but is distinct from M protein."

Respiratory symptoms improved from the first month in the Immucytal treated children, but not in the placebo group, with a reduction in the incidence of infections in the upper and lower airways. No changes were noted in respiratory function parameters. Treatment with Immucytal significantly increased serum immunoglobulin A (P less than 0.02) and immunoglobulin M (P less than 0.01) and enhanced skin response to the in vivo lymphocyte blastization test, but there was no significant change in the circulating lymphocyte subpopulations.

Prolonged immunization in the majority of cases revealed antibodies to cross-reactive determinant of A-PS reacting with human and mouse epithelium of the thymus and basal skin layer. These antibodies belong to autoantibodies. Later on, after the beginning of immunization some animals produced antibodies reacting with cellular nuclei. The formation of autoantibodies to nuclei is not related to crossreactions with A-PS, because A-PS do not inhibit these reactions. No antibodies reacting with the epithelial cells or with cellular nuclei have been observed upon immunization with A-PS in Freund adjuvant or with PEL alone. The production of autoantibodies to cellular nuclei is probably a result of immunoregulatory disorders associated with the damage of thymus epithelium by autoantibodies during immunization with A-PS conjugated with PEL."

In addition to sore throat and cough, fatigue, headache, dyspnoea and vertigo were the most frequent symptoms. The patients received standard treatment with 100 mg of doxycycline b.i.d. for 14 days. In 38.8% of cases symptoms were alleviated after 1-2 weeks of treatment, and in 22.4% of cases after 2-3 weeks of treatment. Pretreatment throat washings and sera were sampled for Chlamydia. Sera were drawn for Chlamydia, Mycoplasma and adenovirus serology. Cell culture (Hep-2) and 3 different serological methods-microimmunofluorescence (MIF), enzyme immunoassay with a recombinant glycoconjugate antigen (r-EIA) and immunoperoxidase assay (IPA)-were used. Cell culture was found to have too low a sensitivity to be of diagnostic value. Acute infection was demonstrated in 13% by MIF IgM and in an additional 21% by MIF IgG (titre rises). Enzyme immunoassay IgM was found in 17% and IPA IgM in 19% of individuals without MIF IgM antibodies. Microimmunofluorescence was found to be the most useful test for serodiagnosis.

CD010502,0,12034109,0,Protection of mice from group A streptococcal infection by intranasal immunisation with a peptide vaccine that contains a conserved M protein B cell epitope and lacks a T cell autoepitope.,"Infection with group A streptococci (GAS) can lead to rheumatic fever (RF) and rheumatic heart disease (RHD) which are a major health concern particularly in indigenous populations worldwide, and especially in Australian Aboriginals. A primary route of GAS infection is via the upper respiratory tract, and therefore, a major goal of research is the development of a mucosal-based GAS vaccine. The majority of the research to date has focused on the GAS M protein since immunity to GAS is mediated by M protein type-specific opsonic antibodies. There are two major impediments to the development of a vaccine-the variability in M proteins and the potential for the induction of an autoimmune response. To develop a safe and broad-based vaccine, we have therefore focused on the GAS M protein conserved C-region, and have identified peptides, J8 and the closely related J8 peptide (J14), which may be important in protective immunity to GAS infection. Using a mucosal animal model system, our data have shown a high degree of throat GAS colonisation in B10.BR mice 24h following intranasal immunisation with the mucosal adjuvant, cholera toxin B subunit (CTB), and/or diptheria toxoid (dT) carrier, or PBS alone, and challenge with the M1 GAS strain. However, GAS colonisation of the throat was significantly reduced following intranasal immunisation of mice with the vaccine candidate J8 conjugated to dT or J14-dT when administered with CTB. Moreover, J8-dT/CTB and J14-dT/CTB-immunised mice had a significantly higher survival when compared to CTB and PBS-immunised control mice. These data indicate that immunity to GAS infection can be evoked by intranasal immunisation with a GAS M protein C-region peptide vaccine that contains a protective B cell epitope and lacks a T cell autoepitope."

In this study an experimental model of aerogenous infection and induction of septicemia with S. suis serotype 2 was established in microbiologically defined Göttingen minipigs. Ten animals were exposed to aerosolized S. suis after previous exposure to mild acetic acid in aerosol. Six of the animals were immunosuppressed with prednisolone acetate on different days. All the animals were monitored clinically until euthanasia on days 6 to 13 after exposure. Necropsy was performed and samples were taken for microbiology, histopathology, and immunohistochemistry Three out of four animals immunosuppressed on days 5 to 7 after exposure developed S. suis septicemia, and S. suis could be detected in the tonsil of the soft palate and/or the nasal cavity of all exposed animals. Thus, using the presented model, local as well as systemic infection with S. suis serotype 2 was established in the Göttingen minipig. Since this breed is defined as free of S. suis and a range of other endemic porcine pathogens, the experimental model could prove useful in the study of this infection."

CD010502,0,7577960,0,Structure and stability of protein H and the M1 protein from Streptococcus pyogenes. Implications for other surface proteins of gram-positive bacteria.,"M proteins and other members of the M protein family, expressed on the surface of Streptococcus pyogenes, bind host proteins such as immunoglobulins, albumin, and fibrinogen. Protein H and the M1 protein are expressed by adjacent genes and both belong to the M protein family. In this work, the structure and stability of these two proteins have been investigated. As judged from sequence analysis and circular dichroism spectroscopy, the proteins are almost entirely in an alpha-helix conformation. The amino acids are arranged in a seven-residue (heptad) repeat pattern along the greater part of the proteins. These observations support the previously accepted model of M proteins as coiled-coil dimers. However, it was also found that the structures of both proteins were thermally unstable; i.e., the content of helix conformation was greatly reduced at 37 degrees C as compared to 25 degrees C or below. Together with previous findings that these proteins appear as monomers at 37 degrees C and dimers at low temperatures, the results suggest that the coiled-coil dimers are unfolded at 37 degrees C. The heptad patterns of protein H and the M1 protein showed a nonoptimal distribution of residues expected for a coiled-coil conformation. This is a possible explanation for the low thermal stability of the proteins. It was also demonstrated that the proteins were stabilized in the presence of the ligands IgG and/or albumin. Protein H and M1 protein show a high degree of sequence similarity in their C-terminal regions, and a fragment from this region displayed a high content of helix conformation, whereas fragments from the nonsimilar N-terminal parts did not adopt any stable folded structure. Thus, the C-terminal parts, which are conserved within the M protein family, may constitute a framework for the formation of the parallel helical coiled-coil structure, and we propose that the less stable N-terminal part may also participate in antiparallel interaction with M proteins on adjacent bacteria. The results suggest that temperature fluctuations in the environment could change the properties of bacterial surface proteins, thereby affecting the molecular interactions between the bacterium and its host."

CD010502,0,20056836,0,Tissue deposits of IgA-binding streptococcal M proteins in IgA nephropathy and Henoch-Schonlein purpura.,"IgA nephropathy (IgAN) and Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) are diseases characterized by IgA deposits in the kidney and/or skin. Both may arise after upper respiratory tract infections, but the pathogenic mechanisms governing these diseases remain unclear. Patients with IgAN (n = 16) and HSP (n = 17) were included in this study aimed at examining whether IgA-binding M proteins of group A streptococci could be involved. As M proteins vary in sequence, the study focused on the IgA-binding-region (IgA-BR) of three different M proteins: M4, M22, and M60. Renal tissue from IgAN and HSP patients and skin from HSP patients were examined for deposits of streptococcal IgA-BR by immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy using specific antibodies, and a skin sample from a HSP patient was examined by mass spectrometry. IgA-BR deposits were detected in 10/16 IgAN kidneys and 7/13 HSP kidneys. Electron microscopy demonstrated deposits of IgA-BRs in the mesangial matrix and glomerular basement membrane, which colocalized with IgA. Skin samples exhibited IgA-BR deposits in 4/5 biopsies, a result confirmed by mass spectrometry in one patient. IgA-BR deposits were not detected in normal kidney and skin samples. Taken together, these results demonstrate IgA-BR from streptococcal M proteins in patient tissues. IgA-BR, would on gaining access to the circulation, encounter circulatory IgA and form a complex with IgA-Fc that could deposit in tissues and contribute to the pathogenesis of IgAN and HSP."

CD010502,0,1722063,0,Group A streptococcal antigens and vaccine potential.,"Attempts over the past seventy years to produce an effective vaccine to protect humans against group A streptococcal infections and their immunologically mediated sequelae (acute rheumatic fever and post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis) have been frustrated by two basic problems, first, the ability of the highly protective cell-surface M proteins to elicit potentially harmful host reactions and second, the existence of a large number of distinct serovars of M proteins and the fact that human immunity to group A streptococcal infections is predominantly M serovar-specific. In recent years, progress towards overcoming these problems has been greatly facilitated by an increased understanding of the structural and immunological properties of protective group A streptococcal antigens, which has emerged from molecular biology studies. This article reviews these studies and discusses the potential for developing an effective group A streptococcal vaccine."
CD010502,0,8389565,0,Comparison of Virapap filter hybridization with polymerase chain reaction and Southern blot hybridization methods for detection of human papillomavirus in tonsillar and pharyngeal cancers.,"A method using a commercial dot filter hybridization kit, Virapap, was compared with Southern blot hybridization and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the detection of human papillomavirus (HPV) types 16 and 18 in pharyngeal and tonsillar cancers of 12 patients as well as tonsillar biopsies from 28 patients with chronic tonsillitis. Concordant results between Virapap and PCR, Virapap and Southern hybridization, and PCR and Southern hybridization methods were obtained respectively in 41.7%, 58.3% and 83.3% of the cancer cases, and 67.9%, 67.9% and 85.7% of the control (tonsillitis) cases. Virapap false-positive results were found in 5 cancer cases and 5 control cases. Although the Virapap method is reported to be useful for detecting HPV in gynecological tissues, this method cannot be recommended for the detection of HPV in pharyngeal and tonsillar cancers."
CD010502,0,18754319,0,"Distribution of emm types and subtypes among noninvasive group A, C and G streptococcal isolates in western Norway.","Characterization of the reservoir of beta-hemolytic streptococci in a community may shed light on the pathogenesis of severe infections caused by these bacteria. We used emm sequence typing to characterize group A streptococci (GAS), group C streptococci (GCS) and group G streptococci (GGS) in community isolates associated with noninvasive disease in western Norway. A total of 165 isolates during a 13-month period were examined. Skin and throat isolates accounted for 123 and 16, respectively, and the remaining 26 isolates were from other non-sterile sites. We identified 18 previously validated emm types and one novel subtype, emm11.7, among the 101 GAS isolates. The two predominant types, emm28 and 12, were found in 40.6% of the GAS isolates. Compared to other recent studies of noninvasive GAS infections from elsewhere in the world, we found a higher frequency of emm82 (5.9%) and emm87 (12.9%) and a lower frequency of emm1 (4.0%) and emm3 (4.0%). We found a different distribution of GAS emm types compared to a previous study from western Norway. Among the 64 isolates of GCS and GGS, 15 previously described emm types and four novel subtypes, stC1400.5, stCK401.3, stG6.3 and stG652.3, were found, stG6, stG643 and stG485 were the most prevalent types and accounted for 59.4% of the GCS and GGS isolates. The high proportion of skin isolates in the present study may indicate the existence of GAS, GCS and GGS strains with predominantly skin and soft tissue tropism in our community."
CD010502,0,1563779,0,Evidence consistent with horizontal transfer of the gene (emm12) encoding serotype M12 protein between group A and group G pathogenic streptococci.,"Human isolates of Lancefield group G streptococci harbor sequences homologous with the structural gene (emm) encoding M protein, a major virulence factor in Streptococcus pyogenes (a group A Streptococcus species). We used DNA-DNA hybridization, restriction endonuclease chromosomal profiling, and multilocus enzyme electrophoresis to examine genetic relationships between group A and group G streptococcal strains expressing homologous serologic type 12 M (M12) protein. All M12 group A strains studied had very similar restriction endonuclease genomic profiles and multilocus enzyme genotypes. In contrast, the restriction enzyme genomic profile and multilocus enzyme genotype of the M12 group G strain CS140 were strikingly different from those characterizing the M12 group A organisms. DNA-DNA hybridization studies revealed, on average, 57% genomic similarity between the M12 group A and group G strains. Taken together, our data demonstrate that a gene encoding M12 protein occurs in two highly divergent chromosomal backgrounds, a result suggesting that an episode of horizontal gene transfer and recombination has occurred between two streptococcal lineages."

Testing of the preparation with a set of rabbit anti-sera by enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and passive hemagglutination reaction (PHR) revealed its antigenic specificity both in direct experiments and in N-acetyl-D-glucosamine absorption. Forty-seven sera of EIA-studied individuals and 35 sera of PHR-studied ones, all with group-specific polysaccharide antigen, were examined. Immune reactions showed the broad spectrum of antibody titres in the studied sera. Complete correlation of anti-polysaccharide antibodies detected by the two techniques was observed in the sera with high specific antibody titres. A possibility to use the obtained group-A specific polysaccharide antigen to detect anti-polysaccharide antibodies in the sera of streptococcal infection patients is discussed."
CD010502,0,12112857,0,Identification of Staphylococcus aureus exotoxins by combined sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry.,"Staphylococcus aureus is an important human pathogen whose pathogenesis involves the synthesis of cell wall associated virulence factors and secreted toxins with damaging effects on the host cells. Most of these pathogenic factors are synthesized in a growth-phase dependent manner as a response to environmental stress like heat, lack of nutrients or other deleterious conditions. Conventional identification of these pathogenic factors is based on Western blot analysis or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and is limited by the commercial availability of antibodies against these toxins. We report here the use of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry for monitoring the pathogenic factors of S. aureus. For the identification of pathogenic factors, a methicillin sensitive strain of S. aureus, ATCC-29213, was grown at 37 degrees C or 42 degrees C in brain-heart infusion broth and harvested during the early stationary phase of growth. Secreted proteins were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, enzymatically digested with trypsin and analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. When grown at 42 degrees C, alpha- and beta-hemolysins were found to accumulate in S. aureus supernatants while the concentration of protein A was slightly decreased. The identity of some of these toxins was confirmed by Western-blot analysis. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry combined with sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis represents a rapid and simple approach to characterize the virulence of S. aureus strains which seems to be particularly valuable for the identification of S. aureus exotoxins for which ELISA is not established."
CD010502,0,17325055,0,"Determination of the relationship between group A streptococcal genome content, M type, and toxic shock syndrome by a mixed genome microarray.","Group A streptococci (GAS), or Streptococcus pyogenes, are associated with a remarkable variety of diseases, ranging from superficial infections to life-threatening diseases such as toxic-shock-like syndrome (TSS). GAS strains belonging to M types M1 and M3 are associated with TSS. This study aims to obtain insight into the gene profiles underlying different M types and disease manifestations. Genomic differences between 76 clinically well characterized GAS strains collected in The Netherlands were examined using a mixed-genome microarray. Inter-M-type genomic differences clearly outweighed intra-M-type genome variation. Phages were major contributors to observed genome diversification. We identified four novel genes, including two genes encoding fibronectin-binding-like proteins, which are highly specific to a subset of M types and thus may contribute to M-type-associated disease manifestations. All M12 strains were characterized by the unique absence of the citrate lyase complex and reduced growth under hypoxic, nutrient-deprived conditions. Furthermore, six virulence factors, including genes encoding a complement-inhibiting protein (sic), an exotoxin (speA), iron(III) binding factor, collagen binding factor (cpa), and fibrinogen binding factor (prt2-like), were unique to M1 and/or M3 strains. These virulence factors may contribute to the potential of these strains to cause TSS. Finally, in contrast to M-type-specific virulence profiles, we did not identify a common virulence profile among strains associated with TSS irrespective of their M type."
CD010502,0,19655299,0,Antiinflammatory effects of a red orange extract in human keratinocytes treated with interferon-gamma and histamine.,"Red oranges are an important component of the so-called Mediterranean diet and they have been used by traditional medicine for their health protective properties, particularly to heal sore throat and cough, suggesting an interesting antiinflammatory activity. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the antiinflammatory activity of a red orange (Citrus sinensis varieties: Moro, Tarocco, Sanguinello) complex (ROC), characterized by high levels of anthocyanins, flavanones, hydroxycinnamic acids and ascorbic acid, on the human keratinocyte line NCTC 2544 exposed to interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and histamine. The expression of immunomodulatory membrane molecules such as inter-cellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) by Western blot analysis, and the release of chemokines such as monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) through ELISA kits, were determined. ICAM-1 modulates the permanence and activation of T lymphocytes in the epidermis. MCP-1 is a specific chemoattractant for monocytes and dendritic cells. IL-8 is important for the recruitment of both neutrophils and T lymphocytes. Addition of ROC at different concentrations together with IFN-gamma and histamine induced a dose-dependent inhibition of ICAM-1 expression and MCP-1 and IL-8 release. ROC shows interesting antiinflammatory properties in human keratinocyte cells NCTC 2544. This natural complex could have a topical employment and mitigate the consequences of some skin pathologies."
CD010502,0,16822689,0,"Rapid detection of the ""highly virulent"" group B Streptococcus ST-17 clone.","Group B streptococcus (GBS) is a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) revealed that the sequence type ST-17 defines a ""highly virulent"" serotype III clone strongly associated with neonatal invasive infections. Our aim was to identify a target sequence enabling rapid, simple, and specific detection of this clone by a real-time PCR assay. Conventional methods for DNA manipulation and gene analyses were used to characterize the gbs2018 gene variant specific for ST-17 clone and to design ST-17- and GBS-specific primers. Conventional and real-time PCR assays were developed to detect GBS and ST-17 clones in bacterial cultures and directly on clinical samples. One hundred and fifty-six French GBS strains from various geographical areas in France isolated between 1990 and 2005 were screened by PCR with ST-17-specific primers. Forty strains were positive, and all were validated by MLST as ST-17. A representative sampling of 49 ST-17-PCR-negative strains was confirmed by MLST as non-ST-17. Real-time PCR was further used to directly test 85 vaginal samples. Among these, 13 were GBS-positive, and one was identified as ST-17. The association between strain invasiveness and ST-17 lineage in neonates with late onset disease was highly significant: 78% (P<0.0001) of strains isolated were ST-17. In conclusion, an ST-17-specific gbs2018 allele was identified and used to develop a sensitive and specific rapid-screening molecular assay for identifying ST-17 ""highly virulent"" GBS. Using this technique, accurate identification of women and neonates colonized by ST-17 can be readily achieved within less than 2 h."
CD010502,0,1500178,0,Group G streptococcal M protein exhibits structural features analogous to those of class I M protein of group A streptococci.,"We have previously studied a collection of group G streptococcal strains isolated from bacteremic human infections and demonstrated that such strains resist phagocytosis by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes but are type specifically opsonized by homologous antiserum. We have now performed Southern hybridization analysis on genomic DNA from eight blood isolates. All eight isolates showed DNA homology to a group A emm24 gene probe. The M-protein gene of one of the isolates, strain 1750, has now been isolated. This gene (emmG1) encodes a polypeptide of 67 kDa (MG1) which is reactive with antibodies to the partially purified M protein of the parent strain. The predicted amino acid structure of MG1 demonstrates significant identity with the carboxy terminus (C, D, and anchor domains) of M6 and M24 but only limited identity with the amino terminus (variable portion) of these group A M proteins. Southern hybridization of genomic DNA of the eight group G blood isolates with an emmG1 gene probe indicated there were at least four emm alleles associated with these strains. These studies indicate that M proteins of group G streptococci, like those of group A, are genetically heterogeneous. Moreover, MG1 appears to conform to the recently proposed class I structure of M-protein molecules and thus shares certain distinct structural features with the M proteins of well-established rheumatogenic group A streptococcal serotypes. Further comparison of the structures of group G and group A M proteins of throat and skin isolates may cast light on those configurations of the M protein molecules which are and are not critical for the expression of rheumatogenicity."
CD010502,0,7714192,0,M or M-like protein gene polymorphisms in human group G streptococci.,"Many group G streptococci (GGS) isolated from infected humans (but not from animal sources) express M or M-like proteins with biological, immunochemical, and genetic features similar to those of group A streptococci (GAS). To further elucidate the recently proposed M-like protein gene (emmL gene) polymorphisms in GGS, Southern blots of genomic DNAs from 38 epidemiologically unrelated GGS strains isolated from human specimens and 12 GGS strains recovered from animal sources were hybridized with oligonucleotide probes designed to specifically detect GAS M class I and M class II M protein (emm) genes. All human-associated GGS strains showed DNA homology to the GAS M class I emm gene probe, whereas no hybridization was found with DNA from any of the animal-associated strains. The emmL genes from all human isolates were amplified by PCR, and the complete sequence of the emmL gene of the Rebecca Lancefield grouping strain D166B was determined. Again, this gene exhibited the structural features typical for emm genes of M class I GAS. The 5' regions of the PCR-amplified emmL genes of the remaining 37 human GGS strains were sequenced. This region showed a sequence diversity similar to that known for GAS emm genes. When strains whose N-terminal emmL gene sequences showed a homology of > 95% were defined as belonging to one genetic type, 30 strains were segregated into six distinct genetic types, whereas the remaining 8 strains each exhibited a unique emmL gene sequence. A high degree of homology between the N-terminal emmL gene segments of six GGS strains and the corresponding regions of either the emm12 or the emm57 gene of GAS was found, suggesting a horizontal gene transfer between strains of these species of beta-hemolytic streptococci. Besides a further understanding of the evolution of GGS emmL genes, the observed emmL gene polymorphisms in GGS could provide the basis for a molecular subspecies delineation of strains and offers the potential of typing GGS for epidemiological purposes."
CD010502,0,6424406,0,Surface characteristics of group A streptococci with and without M-protein.,Twenty M protein-positive and eight M protein-negative strains of group A streptococci were investigated with respect to surface hydrophobicity and amount of lipoteichoic acid (LTA). Surface hydrophobicity as determined in polymer two-phase systems varied substantially between individual strains and there was no correlation to the presence of antiphagocytic M protein. The amount of LTA on the surface of the bacteria varied with hydrophobic affinity of the cells. Strains with a high content of surface LTA were found among both M-positive and M-negative streptococci. Cellular and extracellular LTA was estimated on six strains by the ability of hot phenol extracts and culture fluids to sensitize erythrocytes and by rocket immunoelectrophoretic quantitation. Differences in content of surface LTA did not correlate to differences in the total amount of cellular LTA. Pepsin digestion of M-positive group A streptococci at suboptimal pH resulted in a loss of M antigen whereas surface LTA and the hydrophobic interaction liability was retained. The results indicate that the degree of surface hydrophobicity as measured by two-phase partitioning is not correlated to either the type-specific or the antiphagocytic moiety of M protein. The results support the correlation between surface LTA and surface hydrophobicity of group A streptococci.
CD010502,0,3881538,0,Human antibody to the group-specific polysaccharide of group B Streptococcus.,"IgG antibody to purified group polysaccharide of group B Streptococcus was detected with a specific, reproducible enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in sera of 178 human subjects: 106 parturient patients, 67 of their healthy infants, and 5 adults with invasive infection. Antibody concentrations in 44 parturient carriers of group B streptococci were significantly greater than in 44 noncarriers (geometric mean level, 3.5 and 1.2 micrograms/ml, respectively). Cord serum levels agreed closely with maternal serum levels. The sera of 18 mothers of infants with early-onset streptococcal infection contained levels (geometric mean level, 5.5 micrograms/ml) similar to those of carriers and significantly higher than noncarriers. Of five adults with invasive group B streptococcal infection, three demonstrated significant increases in antibody titer in consecutive sera, and four had antibody concentrations greater than most (93%) noncarriers. These findings suggest that group B polysaccharide is immunogenic in humans and that levels of specific IgG antibody increase with colonization or infection of adults with group B streptococci."

Most antibodies from nine fetal and six patient myosin-reactive B cell clones were multireactive (reacting with cardiac myosin, Streptococcus pyogenes, and rat cardiac myocytes) which supports a role for molecular mimicry in stimulation of these autoantibodies. Sequence analysis revealed that fetal and patient anti-myosin repertoires were composed of unrelated clones with diverse V gene usages. Fetal and patient antibodies had reduced VH CDR3 length on average and reduced light chain N region addition with a low rate of somatic mutation in the variable region genes, characteristics generally associated with fetal B cells but also with some adult B cells. Five of six myosin-reactive patient clones used VH3, whereas only two of nine fetal clones used VH3, suggesting skewing from the average 50-60% VH3 gene usage found in randomly selected adult and fetal antibodies."

CD010502,0,15596052,0,[Advances in the diagnosis and treatment of acute human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection].,"According the WHO there are about 14,000 new HIV infections a day. However, in a few cases the diagnosis will be made in the acute phase of the disease. Acute HIV infection is the period between infection with the virus and complete seroconversion, defined by a positive Western blot test. This period lasts approximately 30 days and most patients (40-90%) have mild clinical manifestations (fever, rash, pharyngitis, mucosal ulcers, among others) for 2 weeks which, because they are nonspecific, can be confused with other community-acquired infections. Microbiological diagnosis is based on the absence of serum antibodies (negative ELISA test) together with a positive HIV viral load in plasma (> 10,000 copies/ml). Diagnosis of acute HIV infection is important for several reasons: firstly, from the epidemiological point of view, this is the period with the highest rates of HIV transmission and identification of new HIV infections reveals the growth of the epidemic and the transmission rates of resistant HIV strains, which in Spain is about 10%; secondly, from the immunopathological point of view, this period provides a unique opportunity to study the virological, immunological and genetic mechanisms that play a role in the transmission and pathogenesis of this disease; and thirdly, therapeutically, starting antiretroviral therapy during this phase could alter the natural history of the disease. However, this is a controversial issue and currently most guidelines recommend treatment only if these patients can be included in clinical trials or if they show lasting or severe clinical manifestations."

CD010502,0,8722579,0,Immunological mimicry between retinal S-antigen and group A streptococcal M proteins.,"Immunological mimicry between host and microbial proteins has been suggested as a potential mechanism in the development of uveitis in humans. In this study immunological crossreactivity between anti-streptococcal monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) and the human eye was investigated. In indirect immunofluorescence, we demonstrated novel immunological crossreactivity of two anti-streptococcal MAbs (27 and 112) with the rod outer (and inner) segments of the retina of the human eye. In further studies, retinal S-Ag, a uveitogenic protein in the rod outer (and inner) segments, was found to react with the anti-streptococcal MAbs. In addition, several uveitogenic peptides of S-Ag were recognized by the anti-streptococcal MAbs. In the ELISA and Western immunoblot, anti-S-Ag MAbs crossreacted with group A streptococci and the streptococcal M protein further demonstrating sites of antigenic similarity. Homology between the retinal S-Ag and streptococcal M protein was observed in amino acid sequences repeated in the B repeat region of the streptococcal M5 protein. These data show that retinal S-antigen has immunological similarities with streptococcal M protein, a major virulence determinant and strong bacterial cell surface antigen."
CD010502,0,7630322,0,Group A streptococci: evaluation of in vitro resistance to two macrolides.,"In recent years an increase in severe group A streptococcal infections has been observed. The possible relation between the failure of therapy and an increase of resistance to antibiotics, which are often used for streptococcal infections (clarithromycin and erythromycin), has been assessed in vitro. Streptococcus pyogenes strains tested for susceptibility were isolated in different years from pharyngotonsillar swabs of symptomatic children and typed; another nine strains came from the American Type Culture Collection. The evaluation of antimicrobial activity demonstrated that the percentage of resistance of these bacteria to the two macrolides was 4, 4.4 and 15.5%, respectively, for strains isolated in 1990, 1991 and 1994. Clarithromycin showed a better antistreptococcal, above all bactericidal, activity. The presence of M protein in streptococci does not seem to modify the kinetic activity of the two drugs, while a slower bactericidal effect was observed against capsulated strains. The resurgence of severe group A Streptococcus infections may be due to an increase in the circulation of strains with a capsule expression, which is critical also for resistance to phagocytic killing."

The GPs obtained duplicate throat swabs, one for processing with the ADT kit, the other for culture reference at The Streptococcus Laboratory (Bacteriological Department, Statens Seruminstitut, Copenhagen). A total of 1389 patients were enrolled in the study, thirty percent of whom were infected by group A streptococci. The following results were obtained: Abbott: Sensitivity: 76%, specificity: 99%, positive predictive value: 97%, negative predictive value: 91%. Concise: Sensitivity: 82%, specificity: 95%, positive predictive value: 86%, negative predictive value: 92%. Kodak: Sensitivity: 84%, specificity: 87%, positive predictive value: 73%, negative predictive value: 93%. As a follow-up to the main study, each GP filled in a questionnaire, stating his opinion about the investigated ADT kit. Considering the practical handiness, Concise scored higher than Abbott, which in turn scored higher than Kodak. In conclusion, Abbott and Concise are recommended for the diagnosis of group A streptococcal pharyngotonsillitis in general practice."
CD010502,0,2145360,0,Target cell lysis and IL-2 secretion by gamma/delta T lymphocytes after activation with bacteria.,"Peripheral blood T lymphocytes from healthy donors were stimulated with Mycobacterium tuberculosis in vitro and afterward analyzed phenotypically. Marked expansion of the gamma/delta T cell population (3- to 21-fold) was observed in 15/21 donors 7 to 10 days after stimulation. In addition to M. tuberculosis, Mycobacterium leprae (six of eight) as well as the gram-positive bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus (two of six), group A streptococci (seven of nine), and Listeria monocytogenes (four of eight) augmented gamma/delta TCR expression in peripheral blood T cells of many donors. gamma/delta T lymphocytes expressed IL-2R and secreted IL-2 upon restimulation with M. tuberculosis. Stimulation with M. tuberculosis evoked specific cytolytic activities in gamma/delta T lymphocytes because: gamma/delta T cells lysed M. tuberculosis pulsed but not unpulsed targets; high concentrations of TCR delta 1 mAb facilitated killing of unpulsed target cells; and low doses of anti-TCR delta 1 mAb blocked killing of pulsed targets. Furthermore, gamma/delta T cells from four donors, after activation with M. tuberculosis or with group A streptococci, respectively, only lysed targets pulsed with the homologous agents, whereas in other donors some cross-reactivity was observed. We conclude that, upon contact with mycobacteria and perhaps other microorganisms, gamma/delta T cells are activated which contribute to immunity against infection via IL-2 secretion and specific target cell lysis."

Monoclonal antibody 54.2.8 stained the nuclei and cytoplasm of cells within the epidermis and epidermal appendages, as well as cells scattered throughout the dermis. In contrast, monoclonal antibodies 49.8.2 and 36.2.2 labeled the cytoplasm of epidermal cells and epidermal appendages but did not react with nuclei. No difference in the staining patterns of control skin and uninvolved skin from patients with psoriasis was observed. However, skin from psoriatic lesions contained large amounts of cross-reactive skin component(s). Sera from patients with guttate psoriasis did not react differently with normal or psoriatic skin when compared with normal sera. Western immunoblots of skin extracts demonstrated that monoclonal antibody 54.2.8 reacted with a family of proteins in the molecular weight range of 60-70K. The results indicate that component(s) in human skin share cross-reactive epitopes with group A streptococci. Immunologic cross-reactions between group A streptococci and human skin may play an important role in the exacerbation of certain skin disorders following streptococcal infections."
CD010502,0,11380148,0,Non-M protein(s) on the cell wall and membrane of group A streptococci induce(s) IFN-gamma production by dermal CD4+ T cells in psoriasis.,"Recently we have demonstrated that a disease-specific subpopulation of CD4+ T cells isolated from skin lesions of chronic plaque psoriasis produces interferon-gamma in response to group A streptococcal (GAS) antigens. To determine if these T cells recognize M or non-M protein, extracts from cell wall of type M6 GAS (M6W) and its isogenic M gene deletion mutant (M-W), M6 membrane extract (M6M) and recombinant M6 protein (rM6) were used to stimulate GAS-reactive T-cell lines from nine patients with chronic plaque psoriasis. T-cell lines were incubated with or without streptococcal extracts for 18 h in the presence of a transport inhibitor, stained for surface CD4 and intracellular cytokine expression, and analysed by flow cytometry. Variable numbers (0.2-34%) of CD4+ T cells produced interferon-gamma, in all but one of the T-cell lines tested, in response to M6W, M-W and M6M extracts. No significant difference between the response to M6W and M-W extracts was detected. In addition, rM6 protein failed to increase CD4+/interferon-gamma+ T-cell numbers in seven of nine T-cell lines compared to medium alone. For the group, there was a highly significant correlation between the responses to the three extracts (M6W vs M-W, P = 0.0005; M6W vs M6M, P = 0.0003; M-W vs M6M, P = 0.0001). Low or minimal numbers of interleukin-4- and interleukin-10-producing CD4+ T cells were occasionally induced. These findings suggest that a subpopulation of CD4+ T cells isolated from skin lesions of chronic plaque psoriasis patients produces interferon-gamma in response to non-M protein(s) present on the cell wall and membrane of GAS."
CD010502,0,3279882,1,[Rapid diagnosis of streptococcal pharyngo-tonsillitis in a primary care unit].,"One of the main consulting motives in ambulatory pediatric practice is acute pharyngotonsillitis. This work values the efficacy of a test to confirm rapid diagnosis (30 minutes) of streptococcal pharyngitis. Authors selected 100 children in a office of primary health care whose ages were between two and seven years, from February to July in 1986. They have considered classical clinical symptoms of pharyngitis and have applied a throat culture and rapid test in all. After comparing test results and culture results, obtained sensibility and specificity have been 80% and 95% (p less than 0.01) respectively. According to these results, they believe on the necessity of a test that permits a rapid diagnosis and which enables to treat acute pharyngitis in a more suitable way in ambulatory pediatrics."
CD010502,0,8307615,0,Binding ability of complement receptor CR1 to C3 bound on the surface of M+ group A streptococci.,"A previous study demonstrated that although M+ bacteria bound C3, mainly C3b and iC3b, via the classical pathway of complement activation, they were not phagocytosed by polymorphonuclear leucocytes (PMN). To elucidate this mechanism, we attempted to distinguish between the possibilities that M+ bacteria are effectively adhering to PMN but are not being endocytosed, or that the C3 deposited on M+ bacteria is not able to interact with the complement receptors on PMN. In the present study, we studied the interaction of C3-coated M+ bacteria with complement receptor CR1, which was isolated from the stroma of human erythrocytes. We show that the isolated complement receptor CR1 can associate with C3-coated M+ bacteria as well as with C3-coated M- bacteria, and the C3 deposited on M+ bacteria is cleaved and releases a C3 fragment in the presence of factor I and liquid-phase CR1. These results suggest that the C3 bound on the surface of M+ bacteria is able to promote adherence to the complement receptor CR1 on PMN. We also studied the distribution of C3 deposited on M+ bacteria in normal human serum (NHS) or normal human plasma (NHP). By immunofluorescence, we show that the C3 bound to M+ bacteria in NHS was deposited uniformly over the surface of the bacteria. On the other hand, the C3 bound to M+ bacteria in NHP was deposited at both ends between adjacent daughter cocci. The results suggest that an additional factor contained in NHP is related to the enhancement of anti-phagocytic activity of M+ bacteria."
CD010502,0,2054063,0,The amino-terminal region of group A streptococcal M protein determines its molecular state of assembly and function.,"Group A streptococcal M protein, a major virulence factor, is an alpha-helical coiled-coil dimer on the surface of the bacteria. Limited proteolysis of type 57 streptococcus with pepsin released two fragments of the M57 molecule, with apparent molecular weights of 32,000 and 27,000 on SDS-PAGE. However, on gel filtration under nondenaturing conditions, each of these proteins eluted as two distinct molecular forms. The two forms corresponded to their dimeric and monomeric state as compared to the gel filtration characteristics of known dimeric coiled-coil proteins. The results of sedimentation equilibrium measurements were consistent with this, but further indicated that the ""dimeric form"" consisted of a dimer in rapid equilibrium with its monomer, whereas the ""monomeric form"" does not dimerize. The monomeric form was the predominant species for the 27 kD species, whereas the dimeric form predominated for the 32 kD species. Sequence analysis revealed the 27 kD species to be a truncated derivative of the 32 kD PepM57 species, lacking the N-terminal nonheptad region of the M57 molecule. These data strongly suggested that the N-terminal nonheptad region of PepM57 is important in determining the molecular state of the molecule. Consistent with this, PepM49, another nephritis-associated serotype, which lacks the nonheptad N-terminal region, also eluted as a monomer on gel filtration under nondenaturing conditions. Furthermore, removal of the N-terminal nonheptad segment of the dimeric PepM6 protein converted it into a monomeric form. The dimeric molecular form of both the 32 kD PepM57 and the 27 kD PepM57 did not represent a stable state of assembly, and were susceptible to conversion to the corresponding monomeric molecular forms by simple treatments, such as lyophilization. The 27 kD PepM57 exhibited a greater propensity than the 32 kD species to exist in the monomeric form. The 32 kD species contained the opsonic epitope of the M57 molecule, whereas the 27 kD species lacked the same. This is consistent with the previous reports on the importance of the N-terminal region of M protein for its opsonic activity. Together, these results strongly suggest that, in addition to its importance for the biological function, the N-terminal region of the M protein plays a dominant role in determining the molecular state of the M molecule, as well as its stability."
CD010502,0,16818781,0,Streptococcal M protein: a multipotent and powerful inducer of inflammation.,"Severe infections with Streptococcus pyogenes, an important human pathogen, are associated with massive inflammatory reactions in the human host. Here we show that streptococcal M protein interacts with TLR2 on human peripheral blood monocytes. As a consequence, monocytes express the cytokines IL-6, IL-1beta, and TNF-alpha. This response is significantly increased in the presence of neutrophil-derived heparin-binding protein (HBP), which co-stimulates monocytes by interacting with CD11/CD18. Analysis of tissue biopsies from patients with necrotizing fasciitis revealed recruitment of neutrophils and monocytes to the infectious site, combined with the release of HBP. The results show that M protein, in synergy with HBP, evokes an inflammatory response that may contribute to the profound pathophysiological consequences seen in severe streptococcal infections."

The sequence of the mga gene reveals three amino acid changes in the gene product that might affect protein function.

CD010502,0,2461405,0,Correlation between symptoms and the threshold for release of mediators in nasal secretions during nasal challenge with grass-pollen grains.,"Nasal challenges with pollen grains represent one of the techniques of provocation. However, the clinical criteria of positivity are not clearly established. Nasal challenges with increasing numbers of orchard-grass pollen grains were performed in 60 patients allergic to grass pollens and 20 normal subjects. Before any challenge, the nose was washed three times with saline and then lactose, and 50, 150, 450, 1350, and 4050 orchard-grass pollen grains were insufflated into the nostrils until a symptom score of 5 was reached. This score was mainly based on major symptoms of allergic rhinitis, for example, rhinorrhea, nasal obstruction, sneezes, and to a lesser extent, on minor symptoms, such as pruritus, conjunctivitis, and pharyngitis. Nasal secretions were obtained after each challenge by lavage. Histamine was titrated by a radioimmunoassay with a monoclonal antibody against acylated histamine. Prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) was assayed with an enzyme immunoassay with a polyclonal antibody against PGD2 methoxamine. None of the normal subjects had a symptom score greater than 2; 55/60 patients had a positive challenge. The release of PGD2 was significantly (p less than 0.001, Kruskal-Wallis test) correlated with a symptom score of 5; 74.5% of patients had a significant release of PGD2 in nasal secretions. In contrast, although 58.2% of patients had a release of histamine in nasal secretions when the challenge was positive, the correlation with symptom scores was not significant. PGD2 in nasal secretions increased 3.7-fold after a positive nasal challenge.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD010502,0,7883882,0,Pneumococci in nasopharyngeal samples from Filipino children with acute respiratory infections.,"The presence of Streptococcus pneumoniae in the upper respiratory tract was studied in 318 Filipino children less than 5 years old with an acute lower respiratory tract infection. Nasopharyngeal samples were obtained from 292 children. With both quantitative bacterial culture and detection of capsular polysaccharide antigens by coagglutination, counterimmunoelectrophoresis, and latex agglutination, pneumococci were found in 160 (70%) of the 227 samples eligible for analysis. Culture was positive in 115 samples and antigen was positive in 140 samples. The culture isolation rate was significantly lower if the patient had received antimicrobial agents in the 48 h prior to the sampling. The seven most common types or groups of pneumococci were 6, 14, 19, 23, 15, 7, and 11, which together accounted for 64% of all pneumococcal findings."
CD010502,0,21730084,0,Investigations on the pattern recognition molecule M-ficolin: quantitative aspects of bacterial binding and leukocyte association.,"M-ficolin is a PRM of the innate immune system, found in serum and associated with leukocytes. We used the soluble form to study specificity toward Gram-positive bacteria and characterized and quantified cell-associated M-ficolin. The binding of M-ficolin to capsulated and noncapsulated strains of Streptococcus agalactiae (GBS) and Staphylococcus aureus was investigated. We did not observe binding of M-ficolin to any of 13 serotypes of S. aureus. Dose-dependent binding of M-ficolin was demonstrated for all of the capsulated GBS strains. The binding was abolished by prior treatment of the bacteria with sialidase, indicating that sialic acid is the ligand for M-ficolin on these bacteria. GlcNAc could inhibit the binding, suggesting that M-ficolin binds via its FBG. M-ficolin was found associated with the complement-activating enzyme in serum, and M-ficolin bound to GBS mediated activation of the complement system. M-ficolin expression on leukocytes was evaluated by flow cytometry with anti-M-ficolin mAb. Total M-ficolin of different leukocytes was quantified in detergent extracts. Monocytes and granulocytes showed similar M-ficolin surface expression, 1.1 × 10(5) and 0.7 × 10(5) M-ficolin molecules/cell, respectively. The total M-ficolin content of the cells was 1.5 × 10(6) molecules/monocyte and approximately one-third of this for granulocytes. Lymphocytes contained <1.5% of the amount estimated for monocytes, and none was revealed on the surface of lymphocytes by flow cytometry. Immunohistochemical analysis of the distribution of M-ficolin in 25 tissues revealed staining of only granulocytes and monocytes. Reported M-ficolin expression by type II pneumocytes could not be verified. We demonstrate the specific binding of M-ficolin to sialic acids in the capsule of GBS and give quantitative aspects of the cell-associated M-ficolin."
CD010502,0,1370521,0,Epitopes of group A streptococcal M protein that evoke cross-protective local immune responses.,"The present studies were undertaken to identify conserved epitopes of group A streptococcal M proteins that evoke cross-protective mucosal immune responses. Two synthetic peptides copying conserved regions of type 5 M protein, designated SM5(235-264)C and SM5(265-291)C, were covalently linked to carrier molecules and their immunogenicity was tested in laboratory animals. Rabbit antisera against both peptides cross-reacted with multiple serotypes of group A streptococci, indicating that the peptides contained broadly cross-reactive, surface exposed M protein epitopes. Serum antipeptide antibodies adsorbed to the surface of heterologous type 24 streptococci passively protected mice against intranasal challenge infections. Mice that were actively immunized intranasally with each synthetic peptide covalently linked to the B subunit of cholera toxin were protected against colonization and death after intranasal challenge infections with type 24 streptococci in the absence of serum opsonic antibodies. These data confirm and extend previous observations that conserved M protein epitopes evoke cross-protective local immunity and may serve as the basis for broadly cross-protective M protein vaccines."
CD010502,0,11418555,0,Design of a protein-targeting system for lactic acid bacteria.,"We designed an expression and export system that enabled the targeting of a reporter protein (the staphylococcal nuclease Nuc) to specific locations in Lactococcus lactis cells, i.e., cytoplasm, cell wall, or medium. Optimization of protein secretion and of protein cell wall anchoring was performed with L. lactis cells by modifying the signals located at the N and C termini, respectively, of the reporter protein. Efficient translocation of precursor (approximately 95%) is obtained using the signal peptide from the lactococcal Usp45 protein and provided that the mature protein is fused to overall anionic amino acids at its N terminus; those residues prevented interactions of Nuc with the cell envelope. Nuc could be covalently anchored to the peptidoglycan by using the cell wall anchor motif of the Streptococcus pyogenes M6 protein. However, the anchoring step proved to not be totally efficient in L. lactis, as considerable amounts of protein remained membrane associated. Our results may suggest that the defect is due to limiting sortase in the cell. The optimized expression and export vectors also allowed secretion and cell wall anchoring of Nuc in food-fermenting and commensal strains of Lactobacillus. In all strains tested, both secreted and cell wall-anchored Nuc was enzymatically active, suggesting proper enzyme folding in the different locations. These results provide the first report of a targeting system in lactic acid bacteria in which the final location of a protein is controlled and biological activity is maintained."

Direct final rule.,"The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is removing the regulation applicable to the status of specific products; Group A streptococcus. FDA is removing the regulation because the existing requirement for Group A streptococcus organisms and derivatives is both obsolete and a perceived impediment to the development of Group A streptococcus vaccines. The regulation was written to apply to a group of products that are no longer on the market. We are taking this action as part of our continuing effort to reduce the burden of unnecessary regulations on industry and to revise outdated regulations without diminishing public health protection. We are issuing the removal directly as a final rule because it is noncontroversial, and there is little likelihood that we will receive any significant adverse comments. Elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register, we are publishing a companion proposed rule under our usual procedures for notice and comment in the event that we receive any significant adverse comments on the direct final rule. If we receive any significant adverse comments that warrant terminating the direct final rule, we will consider such comments on the proposed rule in developing the final rule."
CD010502,0,3293699,1,Rational decisions in managing sore throat: evaluation of a rapid test.,"Sixty nine general practitioners recorded what they had prescribed for a total of 1189 episodes of sore throat. Antibiotics were prescribed in 763 (64%) episodes and broad spectrum antibiotics in 161 (21%) of these. If there was dysphagia, hoarseness, cervical adenopathy, and inflamed or purulent tonsils a prescription was more likely to be written. An enzyme immunoassay rapid test was evaluated as a means of rationalizing prescribing. Among 23 general practitioners and 250 patients the sensitivity of the test was 63% and the specificity 91.7% compared with 74% and 58% for clinical assessment alone. Test results rarely caused previous prescribing decisions (34 [corrected] (13%) episodes) to be altered. We suggest that the time is not ripe for the use of the enzyme immunoassay rapid test on a wide scale in the routine assessment of sore throats."

CD010502,0,10629675,0,Occult bacteremia in young febrile children.,"The evaluation of nontoxic-appearing, young, febrile children has been a subject of considerable debate. Of young, nontoxic-appearing children aged 3 to 36 months with temperatures of 39 degrees C or more and no clear source, approximately 2% to 3% have occult bacteremia. Of these bacteremias, approximately 90% are caused by S. pneumoniae, 5% by nontyphoidal Salmonella sp., and 1% by N. meningitidis. Most children with occult pneumococcal bacteremia improve spontaneously, but approximately 25% of untreated patients have persistent bacteremia or develop new focal infections, including 3% to 6% who develop meningitis. Occult meningococcal bacteremia, although rare, has frequent complications, including meningitis in approximately 40% and death in approximately 4%. Less is known about the natural history of untreated occult nontyphoidal Salmonella bacteremia. Empiric antibiotic treatment of children with occult bacteremia decreases the rate of complications, including meningitis. Few disagree that febrile, young children at risk for occult bacteremia require a careful clinical evaluation and close follow-up. The benefits of laboratory screening and selective empiric antibiotic treatment of febrile children at risk for occult bacteremia have to be weighed against the costs of screening tests and blood cultures, inconvenience, temporary discomfort to patients, risk for side effects of antibiotics, and the role of antibiotics in the development of bacterial resistance. Although great debate exists concerning the role of empiric antibiotics, a strategy for obtaining blood cultures and empirically administering antibiotics on the basis of an increased ANC, in addition to close clinical follow-up, may be effective in reducing the frequency and severity of uncommon but adverse sequelae. A highly effective S. pneumoniae bacterial conjugate vaccine will soon be available, which will benefit all children, and will alter the ways that clinicians evaluate fully immunized young, febrile children."

Genomic DNA from 22 isolates representing 14 M serotypes was selected for the study. Primers which corresponded to the observed N-terminal signal sequence and the variable C-terminal sequences of emm6, emm49 and ennX were used. PCR products using emm6 and emm49 oligonucleotides were classified into two mutually exclusive groups which correspond to the presence or absence of serum opacity factor. These findings support the concept of limited heterogeneity in the C-terminal sequences of the M protein."

CD010502,0,17215045,0,UK malaria treatment guidelines.,"Malaria is the tropical disease most commonly imported into the UK, with 1500-2000 cases reported each year, and 10-20 deaths. Approximately three-quarters of reported malaria cases in the UK are caused by Plasmodium falciparum, which is capable of invading a high proportion of red blood cells and rapidly leading to severe or life-threatening multi-organ disease. Most non-falciparum malaria cases are caused by Plasmodium vivax; a few cases are caused by the other two species of Plasmodium: Plasmodium ovale or Plasmodium malariae. Mixed infections with more than 1 species of parasite can occur; they commonly involve P. falciparum with the attendant risks of severe malaria. Management of malaria depends on awareness of the diagnosis and on performing the correct diagnostic tests: the diagnosis cannot be excluded until 3 blood specimens have been examined by an experienced microscopist. There are no typical clinical features of malaria, even fever is not invariably present. The optimum diagnostic procedure is examination of thick and thin blood films by an expert to detect and speciate the malarial parasites; P. falciparum malaria can be diagnosed almost as accurately using rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) which detect plasmodial antigens or enzymes, although RDTs for other Plasmodium species are not as reliable. The treatment of choice for non-falciparum malaria is a 3-day course of oral chloroquine, to which only a limited proportion of P. vivax strains have gained resistance. Dormant parasites (hypnozoites) persist in the liver after treatment of P. vivax or P. ovale infection: the only currently effective drug for eradication of hypnozoites is primaquine. This must be avoided or given with caution under expert supervision in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PD), in whom it may cause severe haemolysis. Uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria can be treated orally with quinine, atovaquone plus proguanil (Malarone) or co-artemether (Riamet); quinine is highly effective but poorly tolerated in prolonged dosage and is always supplemented by additional treatment, usually with oral doxycycline. ALL patients treated for P. falciparum malaria should be admitted to hospital for at least 24 h, since patients can deteriorate suddenly, especially early in the course of treatment. Severe falciparum malaria, or infections complicated by a relatively high parasite count (more than 2% of red blood cells parasitized), should be treated with intravenous therapy until the patient is well enough to continue with oral treatment. In the UK, the treatment of choice for severe or complicated malaria is currently an infusion of intravenous quinine. This may exacerbate hypoglycaemia that can occur in malaria; patients treated with intravenous quinine therefore require careful monitoring. Intravenous artesunate reduces high parasite loads more rapidly than quinine and is more effective in treating severe malaria in selected situations. It can also be used in patients with contra-indications to quinine. Intravenous artesunate is unlicensed in the EU. Assistance in obtaining artesunate may be sought from specialist tropical medicine centres, on consultation, for named patients. Patients with severe or complicated malaria should be managed in a high dependency or intensive care environment. They may require haemodynamic support and management of acute respiratory distress syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulation, renal impairment/failure, seizures, and severe intercurrent infections including gram-negative bacteraemia/septicaemia. Falciparum malaria in pregnancy is more likely to be severe and complicated: the placenta contains high levels of parasites. Stillbirth or early delivery may occur and diagnosis can be difficult if parasites are concentrated in the placenta and scanty in the blood. The treatment of choice for falciparum malaria in pregnancy is quinine; doxycycline is contraindicated in pregnancy but clindamycin can be substituted for it, and is equally effective. Primaquine (for eradication of P. vivax or P. ovale hypnozoites) is contraindicated in pregnancy; after treatment for these infections a pregnant woman should take weekly chloroquine prophylaxis until after delivery when hypnozoite eradication can be considered. Children are over-represented in the incidence of malaria in the UK, probably because completely susceptible UK-born children accompany their overseas-born parents on visits to family and friends in endemic areas. Malaria in children (and sometimes in adults) may present with misleading symptoms such as gastrointestinal features, sore throat or lower respiratory complaints; the diagnosis must always be sought in a feverish or very sick child who has visited malaria-endemic areas. Children can be treated with most of the antimalarial regimens which are effective in adults, with appropriate dosage adjustment. Doxycycline plus quinine should not be given to children under 12 years as doxycycline is contraindicated in this age group, but clindamycin can be substituted for doxycycline, and pyrimethamine-sulfadoxine (Fansidar) may also be an effective substitute. An acute attack of malaria does not confer protection from future attacks: individuals who have had malaria should take effective anti-mosquito precautions and chemoprophylaxis during future visits to endemic areas."

Although distribution of emm types of GAS in India has been described, there is a lack of data describing either the comparative distribution of emm types in throat versus skin isolates, or the distribution of certain virulence factors amongst these isolates. Therefore in the present study we have monitored the emm type pattern of Group A streptococcus throat and skin isolates from India. Additionally, the association of these isolates with closely related sic (crs), a multifunctional compliment binding virulence factor, was also explored."
CD010502,0,6754620,0,Type-specific antibodies to structurally defined fragments of streptococcal M proteins in patients with acute rheumatic fever.,"Group A streptococci of M protein type 5 have been epidemiologically related to acute rheumatic fever in a number of reported outbreaks. Preliminary bacteriological evidence suggests that M5 may be an important ""rheumatogenic"" type in Santiago, Chile. To assess further the relationship of this streptococcal serotype to rheumatic fever in Chile, sera of 34 patients with rheumatic fever and an equal number of age-, sex-, and race-matched controls were assayed for antibodies to types 5, 6, and 24 in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with purified pepsin extracts of the respective M proteins as solid-phase antigens. Sera of 11 rheumatic fever patients (32%) were positive (titer greater than 1:800) for type 5 antibodies, but only 1 (3%) of the matched controls was positive (P less than 0.01). Neither the patients nor the controls had antibodies to type 24. Although 38% of the patient sera contained antibodies to type 6, 29% of the control sera also had such antibodies (P greater than 0.20). The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay served as an accurate predictor of which sera contained type 5 opsonic antibodies as measured by the opsonophagocytic test. Although antigenic cross-reactivity exists between M protein type 5 and type 6 group A streptococci, this phenomenon is unlikely to have accounted for the preferential occurrence of type 5 antibodies in rheumatic fever sera. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and opsonic antibody results suggest that M5 is an important rheumatogenic type in Chile."

Of the 344 specimens positive by culture, 277 were DGAST positive (sensitivity, 81%). Of the 1563 specimens negative by culture, 1511 were DGAST negative (specificity, 97%). Nineteen isolates of non-group A beta-hemolytic streptococci were recovered, primarily group C, B and G. The DGAST is easy to perform, rapid and very specific, but lower sensitivity indicates that a back up traditional culture is still necessary, especially in pediatric patients."

To determine whether Streptococcus pyogenes superantigen (SAg) genes commonly exist within these organisms, 20 recent invasive GCSE and GGSE human isolates and one group G Streptococcus canis human isolate were tested for the presence of SAg genes speH, speJ, speL, speM, ssa and smeZ by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Prior to this work, sequence-based evidence of the speM, ssa, and smeZ genes in GCSE, GGSE, and S. canis had not been documented. Eleven of the 21 isolates were PCR-positive for the presence of one to two of the SAgs speM, ssa, or smeZ, with four of these isolates carrying ssa+speM or ssa+smeZ. No isolate was positive for speH, speJ and speL. All six ssa-positive GGSE strains harbored the ssa3 allele, previously only found among S. pyogenes strains. All three smeZ-positive GGSE isolates carried one of two smeZ alleles previously only found within S. pyogenes, however the single S. canis isolate carried a new smeZ allele. All five GCSE and GGSE speM-positive isolates harbored a newly discovered speM allele. The identification of these SAgs within S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis and S. canis with identical or near-identical sequences to their counterparts in S. pyogenes suggests frequent interspecies gene exchange between the three beta-hemolytic streptococcal species."

The emm and sof genes were sequenced, the presence of the speA and speC genes was investigated, and the macrolide resistance phenotypes and genotypes were determined. A limited number of emm/sof genotypes was found, and the most prevalent types were different from those found in a previous study from Rome. Macrolide resistance was found in the most prevalent clones, suggesting that the spread of mobile antibiotic resistance genes among the fittest clones in the community was the main mechanism influencing macrolide resistance rates in different emm types."
CD010502,0,15572852,0,The effect of surgical treatment of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome on the plasma TNF-alpha levels.,"Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is defined as intermittent complete or partial upper airway obstruction during sleep, causing mental and physical effects. Both the local and systemic inflammation observed in OSAS induce certain potent pro-inflammatory mediators, which may contribute to the development of cardiovascular consequences. The present study was designed to evaluate the plasma levels of TNF-alpha, which is one of the known pro-inflammatory cytokines, in patients with OSAS and to assess the effect of surgical treatment on the levels of TNF-alpha levels. Twenty seven patients diagnosed to have OSAS, 7 non-apneic patients with chronic tonsillitis (non-OSAS patients), and 4 healthy subjects were enrolled in this study. Blood samples were collected one week preoperatively and postoperatively, and the plasma TNF-alpha levels were measured using high-sensitivity ELISA. The plasma TNF-alpha levels in patients with OSAS were significantly elevated in comparison to normal healthy subjects. In contrast, there was no difference between the patients with non-OSAS and healthy subjects. Moreover, the surgical treatment to enlarge the upper airway in patients with OSAS significantly decreased the levels of TNF-alpha levels. Surgical treatment of patients with OSAS reduces the plasma TNF-alpha levels, thereby ameliorating the systemic inflammation and preventing the development of cardiovascular consequences."
CD010502,0,12971528,0,Streptococcus suis infection: clinical features and diagnostic pitfalls.,"Eight cases of Streptococcus suis (S. suis) infection between 1993-1999 were retrospectively studied. There were 6 cases of meningitis and 2 cases of endocarditis. Acute meningitis with early sensorineural hearing loss was the characteristic feature and the most common presentation of S. suis infection. S. suis endocarditis is a rare presentation in Thailand. This organism was often mistaken for Streptococcus pneumoniae or Streptococcus viridans. In this study, this was true in five cases in whom S. suis was identified later. However, the rapid diagnosis of S. suis meningitis may rely on Gram stain of the CSF in the setting of acute meningitis with hearing loss. These cases were treated with intravenous penicillin or ampicillin with a mean duration of 4 weeks. This treatment was very effective and there was no relapse among these patients."

CD010502,0,1528877,0,Two major classes in the M protein family in group A streptococci.,"The M protein family of molecules in the group A streptococcus comprises a number of cell surface proteins that interact with the immune system of the host. One of the proteins in this family is the IgA receptor Arp4, which has C repeats similar to those that characterize the known M proteins. The streptococcal strain expressing Arp4 also expresses a second immunoglobulin-binding protein, Mrp4, which is shown here to be encoded by a gene located immediately upstream of the gene for Arp4. In addition to binding IgG, Mrp4 also binds fibrinogen, a property ascribed to M proteins. DNA sequence analysis demonstrated that the Mrp4 protein indeed is a member of the M protein family, but it was unexpectedly found to have a type of repeat that is identical to the A repeat described for FcRA76, a partially sequenced streptococcal Fc receptor. Purified FcRA76 was shown to bind fibrinogen and IgG, like Mrp4. These data show that the known molecules in the M protein family can be divided into two classes, A and C, according to the type of repeat region found. Hybridization studies with a panel of clinical isolates indicate that many streptococcal strains express class A and class C proteins, whereas some strains express only class C proteins. Class A molecules show amino-terminal sequence variation, like class C molecules, which suggests that proteins of both classes are targets for the immune response."

CD010502,0,7995079,0,Isolation and characterization of Aeromonas from seafoods in Taipei.,"A total of 124 fresh seafoods and 158 processed seafoods collected from the retail markets and supermarkets in Taipei were tested for the contamination with motile Aeromonas spp. Of the fresh seafoods analyzed, 88% displayed the presence of Aeromonas. The isolation rates of various samples were as follows: 100%, freshwater fish; 95%, seawater fish; 78%, fish fillets; 84%, shrimp and crab of the crustacea group; 83%, bivalve shellfish and 84%, non-bivalve shellfish of the mollusca group, and 100%, seaweed. Of the 158 processed seafoods, 11% were contaminated by Aeromonas. The isolation rates were as follows: 0%, canned, dried, or frozen fresh seafood; 18%, salted seafood; 30%, fish cake; 7% vacuum-packaged fish cakes; 14%, frozen seafood dumplings; 8%, cooked seafoods. One hundred and eighty-three Aeromonas strains isolated in this survey were characterized to species level and tested for their ability to produce beta-hemolysin. Ninety-eight percent (98%) of the A. hydrophila produced beta-hemolysin on 5% blood agar, 94% of the A. sobria and 33% of the A. caviae produced beta-hemolysin. Thus it is likely that fresh seafoods are potentially significant sources of the virulent Aeromonas species and may play an important role in the epidemiology of Aeromonas-associated gastroenteritis."

They received antibiotic treatment for 10 days, followed by 10 days of alpha-streptococcal or placebo spray treatment in the ratio of 2 : 1. Pharyngeal status, throat culture and adverse events were investigated up to 75 days after treatment. The frequency of bacteriologically verified clinical recurrence was 13% in the alpha-streptococcal group and 15% in the placebo group at the follow-up on day 22. The corresponding figures at the last valid visit after 45-75 days were 19% and 30%, respectively, a statistically significant difference (p = 0.037). Furthermore, at the last valid visit 5% of subjects in the alpha-streptococcal and 12% in the placebo group were healthy carriers, bacteriological treatment failures, of GAS (p = 0.029). Treatment with alpha-streptococci and placebo spray were equally well tolerated. Thus, re-colonization with alpha-streptococci seem to hinder late recurrences of GAS pharyngotonsillitis."

Nucleotide sequence of the serotype 5 M protein gene and its relationship with genes encoding types 6 and 24 M proteins.,"The 1479-base pair (bp) nucleotide sequence of the serotype 5 M protein gene (smp5) from Streptococcus pyogenes contains three distinct types of tandemly repeated sequences, designated A, B, and C. Repeat A (21 bp x 6, in the 5'-half of smp5), shares no homology with the types 6 or 24 M protein genes (Hollingshead, S. K., Fischetti, V. A., and Scott, J. R. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 1677-1686; Mouw, A. R., Beachey, E. H., and Burdett, V. (1988) J. Bacteriol., in press). Repeat B (75 bp x 3.6, in the center of smp5) is also present in the M6, but not in the M24 gene. Repeat C (105 bp x 2.7, just distal to the B repeats) shares homology with repeats in both the M6 and M24 genes. All three genes share extensive homology in their 3'-halves and in 5' sequences encoding the N-terminal signal peptides, but between these two regions there are highly variable sequences that are responsible for antigenic diversity. These relationships suggest that both intergenic and intragenic recombination has occurred during the evolution of distinct M protein serotypes. All three M proteins contain conserved hydrophobic and proline-rich sequences at their C-terminal ends, suggestive of a membrane anchor and a peptidoglycan spanning region."
CD010502,0,3538721,0,Streptococcal group A polysaccharide antibodies assayed by an ELISA determination of antibodies in rabbit hyperimmune sera; normal levels in man and comparison with levels in patients with rheumatic fever and with poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis.,"An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was adapted to measure antibodies to streptococcal group A polysaccharide. The components of the reaction were studied, including the concentration of the polysaccharide antigen, the suppression of non-specific reactions, optimal conjugate binding conditions and the most suitable plates. The specificity of this test was documented by studies using immune sera and polysaccharide antigens of various groups of beta-hemolytic streptococci. In addition dynamics of the antibody response in animals as well as in man were investigated. The upper limit of normal level of this antibody in normal healthy persons was determined by this technique. We found that 80% of patients with rheumatic fever and acute glomerulonephritis showed an elevation of the group A polysaccharide antibody titer. Determination of this antibody response by the ELISA technique is clinically useful in evaluation patients with the nonsuppurative sequelae of group A streptococcal infections."
CD010502,0,17631691,0,High burden of invasive beta-haemolytic streptococcal infections in Fiji.,"We undertook a 5-year retrospective study of group A streptococcal (GAS) bacteraemia in Fiji, supplemented by a 9-month detailed retrospective study of beta-haemolytic streptococcal (BHS) infections. The all-age incidence of GAS bacteraemia over 5 years was 11.6/100,000. Indigenous Fijians were 4.7 times more likely to present with invasive BHS disease than people of other ethnicities, and 6.4 times more likely than Indo-Fijians. The case-fatality rate for invasive BHS infections was 28%. emm-typing was performed on 23 isolates: 17 different emm-types were found, and the emm-type profile was different from that found in industrialized nations. These data support the contentions that elevated rates of invasive BHS and GAS infections are widespread in developing countries, and that the profile of invasive organisms in these settings reflects a wide diversity of emm-types and a paucity of types typically found in industrialized countries."
CD010502,0,8304264,0,Group B streptococcal disease in the perinatal period.,"Group B streptococcus is the major cause of neonatal sepsis in the United States. It is estimated that 2,000 infants die annually of syndromes related to group B streptococcus infection. In the early-onset syndrome, transmission is from mother to child, either in utero or during birth. Pneumonia is the most common presentation in infants who develop symptoms during the first seven days of life. The principal manifestation of late-onset infection is meningitis, which occurs in 85 percent of this group. Although group B streptococcus infection is normally remediable with penicillin therapy, rapid diagnosis and treatment are necessary to prevent the serious consequences of the disease. A vaccine is under development, although the cost-effectiveness of a widespread immunization program for a disease with such a low frequency is still unknown. The potentially serious outcomes of this infection, however, make it a major problem for physicians involved in neonatal care."
CD010502,0,19717514,0,Neutrophil-derived hyperresistinemia in severe acute streptococcal infections.,"The concept of neutrophil activation and degranulation as important contributors to disease pathology in invasive group A streptococcal infections has recently been emphasized. This study focuses on two of the most severe streptococcal manifestations, toxic shock syndrome and necrotizing fasciitis, and the newly described proinflammatory molecule resistin, known to derive from adipocytes and monocytes. We demonstrate for the first time that these conditions are characterized by hyperresistinemia in circulation as well as at the local site of infection. Importantly, analyses of patient tissue biopsies and whole blood revealed that neutrophils represent a novel and dominant source of resistin in bacterial septic shock. This was confirmed by the identification of resistin within neutrophil azurophilic granules. In vitro assays using primary neutrophils showed that resistin release was readily triggered by streptococcal cell wall components and by the streptococcal M1 protein, but not by the potent streptococcal superantigens. This is the first report demonstrating that resistin is released from neutrophils in response to microbial stimuli, which adds resistin to the neutrophil granule proteins that are likely to contribute to the pathologic inflammatory responses associated with severe streptococcal infections."

Both native and recombinant SDM expressed in Escherichia coli significantly activated human V beta 1+ and V beta 23+ T cells in association with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules on accessory cells, indicating that SDM possesses superantigenic properties. The sdm gene consists of two segments encoding a signal peptide and a mature 25 kDa protein composed of 212 amino acids. Three of 34 S. dysgalactiae strains but none of 28 Streptococcus pyogenes strains examined carried sdm. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that SDM belongs to a family distinct from established bacterial superantigens. SDM showed around 30% homology with other superantigens at the amino acid sequence level. The tertiary structure of SDM was predicted by modelling onto streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin C and streptococcal mitogenic exotoxin Z-2, both of which share highly homologous structure-determining regions. SDM showed overall structural similarity to both these superantigens. This is the first study to characterize fully a bacterial superantigen from S. dysgalactiae."
CD010502,0,6389805,0,Latex agglutination tests for rapid identification of group A streptococci directly from throat swabs.,"A comparison of the accuracy and practicality of two new latex agglutination tests for the rapid identification of group A beta-hemolytic streptococci directly from throat swabs was performed in a busy pediatric office. The Directigen Group A Strep Test kit had a sensitivity of 84%, specificity 99%, positive predictive value 99%, and negative predictive value 93% when compared with blood agar cultures. The Culturette Brand 10-Minute Group A Strep ID Kit had a sensitivity of 83%, a specificity 99%, positive predictive value 97%, and negative predictive value 93% when compared with blood agar cultures. When cultures with less than 10 colonies of group A beta-hemolytic streptococci per plate were not considered positive, both rapid tests had a sensitivity of 95%. The Culturette Brand test required considerably less time, equipment, supplies, and skill than the Directigen test. Only the Culturette Brand test appeared to be practical for routine use in a pediatrician's office. Further investigations of the accuracy of both of these rapid tests need to be performed before either is accepted as a substitute for the throat culture."
CD010502,0,8702550,0,Identification of a family of streptococcal surface proteins with extremely repetitive structure.,"The group B Streptococcus (GBS) causes the majority of life-threatening bacterial infections in newborn children. Most GBS strains isolated from such infections express a surface protein, designated Rib, that confers protective immunity and therefore is of interest for analysis of pathogenetic mechanisms. Sequence analysis demonstrated that Rib has an exceptionally long signal peptide (55 amino acid residues) and 12 repeats (79 amino acid residues each) that account for >80% of the sequence of the mature protein. The repeats are identical even at the DNA level, indicating that an efficient mechanism operates to maintain a highly repetitive structure in Rib. The structure of Rib is similar to that of alpha, a previously characterized surface protein that is common among GBS strains lacking Rib. However, highly purified preparations of Rib and alpha did not cross-react immunologically, although the two proteins show extensive amino acid residue identity (47% in the repeat region). When analyzed in Western blots, Rib and alpha give rise to a regularly spaced ladder pattern, apparently due to hydrolysis of acid-labile Asp-Pro bonds in the repeats. We conclude that Rib and alpha are members of a novel family of streptococcal surface proteins with unusual repetitive structure."

Of 519 swabs processed for both culture and the OIA test, 114 were culture-positive for GABHS compared with 133 positive by the OIA test, for an agreement of 94%. OIA test sensitivity compared with culture was 96%, and specificity was 94%. Forty-seven percent of all study patients were empirically placed on antibiotics. In-clinic OIA testing could have reduced inappropriate therapy and been a cost-effective alternative to culture."
CD010502,0,15258094,0,Rapid diagnosis of pharyngitis caused by group A streptococci.,"Although commercial rapid antigen detection tests (RADTs) are more expensive than blood agar plate (BAP) cultures, the advantage they offer is the speed with which they provide results. Rapid identification and consequent prompt treatment of patients with pharyngitis due to group A beta-hemolytic streptococci (GABHS) can reduce the risk of spread of GABHS, can allow patients to return to school or work sooner, and may reduce the acute morbidity of this illness. In most studies, RADTs have been compared with BAP cultures as the criterion standard. However, these comparisons are complicated by the fact that there is no universally accepted procedure for performing a BAP culture. The great majority of the RADTs that are currently available have a high specificity (i.e., 95% or greater) and a sensitivity of between 70 and 90% compared with BAP cultures. Few published studies have compared the performance of various RADTs to each other or examined the performance of various RADTs in the office setting. There is also relatively little published information about how physicians in practice actually use RADTs, but the available information suggests that many physicians do not follow recommended guidelines. While the development of easy-to-perform RADTs for the diagnosis of GABHS pharyngitis has altered clinical practice substantially, only limited data about cost-effectiveness are currently available."

A total of 21 emm types and 56 PFGE patterns were identified. The most frequent emm types were emm1 (29.2%), emm4 (24.1%), emm12 (19.0%), emm6 (15.8%), stIL103 (5.7%), and emm22 (1.9%). Antimicrobial resistance profiles were determined, and resistance to erythromycin (24.6%), clindamycin (2.0%), and chloramphenicol (1.3%) was detected. Five major emm types (emm4, emm12, emm1, emm22, and emm6) accounted for 95.6% of the erythromycin-resistant isolates. The decreased prevalence of erythromycin-resistant emm12 strains coincided with the overall decrease in erythromycin resistance from 32.1% in 2001 to 21.1% in 2002 in Taiwan. Five major clones (emm4/2000, emm12/0000, emm4/2010, emm1/1000, and emm22/8100) represented 72.1% of the erythromycin-resistant isolates.

CD010502,0,7806351,0,Location of the complement factor H binding site on streptococcal M6 protein.,"The surface M protein of group A streptococci binds factor H, a regulatory protein of the alternative complement pathway, which may contribute to the antiphagocytic activity of the M molecules. To locate the factor H binding domain in the alpha-helical coiled-coil structure of the M molecule, the M protein was cleaved with pepsin at pH 5.8, which separates the molecule approximately in half. Western blot (immunoblot), amino acid sequence, and mass spectrometric analyses revealed that factor H bound to a 14.6-kDa C-terminal fragment of the M molecule. Competitive inhibition of factor H binding to the 14.6-kDa fragment with M protein peptides localized the binding site to amino acids 256 to 292. This segment is located within the surface-exposed region of the M6 protein, identified as the C-repeat region, whose sequence is conserved among heterologous M and M-like molecules. These studies also identified a second pepsin-susceptible site with the sequence ELAK located within the cell wall-associated region of the M molecule."

The serological study of sera from patients with rheumatism and chronic tonsillitis, as well as hyperimmune rabbit sera, indicated that the antigenic activity of the cytoplasmic preparations was almost completely determined by the high-molecular fraction.

CD010502,0,9652434,0,Protein F1 is required for efficient entry of Streptococcus pyogenes into epithelial cells.,"It was recently reported that strains of Streptococcus pyogenes are capable of inducing entry of the bacterium into epithelial cells; however, nothing is known regarding the gene(s) and the underlying mechanism(s) involved. Using isogenic mutants of S. pyogenes JRS4 strain that are defective in the expression of each of the surface proteins F1 and M6, it was demonstrated that both are required for efficient internalization. Expression of F1 on the surface of a poorly invading S. pyogenes strain significantly enhances its internalization efficiency. Protein F1-mediated internalization is inhibited by UR, the nonrepetitive fibronectin-binding domain of this protein, and to a lesser extent, by the repetitive fibronectin-binding domain, RD2. Polyclonal anti-human fibronectin antibodies completely abolish F1-mediated internalization; increasing fibronectin concentrations result in a significant enhancement of bacterial uptake. The findings shown here suggest that protein F1 mediates streptococcal internalization and that the M6 protein is required for more efficient entry of the bacterium."
CD010502,0,18608177,0,Antigenic complementarity between coxsackie virus and streptococcus in the induction of rheumatic heart disease and autoimmune myocarditis.,"A variety of clinical, epidemiological, and experimental data suggest that rheumatic heart disease and autoimmune myocarditis are not only similar in their pathogenesis, but may often be due to combined infections with coxsackie virus (CX) and streptococcus A bacteria (SA). This paper reviews the evidence for this hypothesis, provides some new experimental data supporting the hypothesis, and suggests specific experiments for testing it. While, it is well-established that the M protein of SA mimics myosin, we demonstrate using homology search tools that various CX proteins mimic actin. We further demonstrate that antibody against CX recognizes actin as an antigen, and that anti-actin antibodies recognize CX antigen. Thus, anti-CX antibodies may also target muscle. Moreover, since myosin and actin are molecularly complementary, it follows that some SA and CX proteins may be molecularly complementary. Some antibodies against these complementary proteins in SA and CX should therefore act like idiotype-antiidiotype antibodies. We show that, indeed, CX and SA antibodies precipitate each other. Thus, it is possible that combined CX-SA infections produce more severe disease by producing pairs of idiotypic antibodies that act like antiidiotypic antibodies as well, thereby, disregulating immune control and triggering an autoimmune reaction against both myosin and actin simultaneously. We predict that combinations of the appropriate actin- and myosin-like antigens from CX and SA will, therefore, be much more autoimmunogenic than antigens from CX or SA alone, and that the combination will not require use of adjuvants or self-proteins that many current protocols require. It is possible that co-infections involving CX or SA with other infectious agents may produce similarly enhanced disease."

Antibodies to OF-antigens 58, 62, and 63 were not detected. The distribution of OF-antibodies was found to vary with sex, occurring in females 1.5 times more frequently than in males, and with age, accumulating in subjects aged 21-30 and 31-40. The distribution of antibodies to different OF serotypes did not depend on the blood serum streptolysin O titers."

In a series of 1609 hospitalized adult patients, without symptoms of acute or chronic streptococcal rheumatism, the level of antistreptococcal antibodies was measured, using three technical methods: the traditional one, i.e., antistreptolysim titer (ASLO); streptozyme titer (STZ) and the anti-C-polysaccharide technique (Microstreptokit, MSK); by the mutual comparison of these three antigens it was possible to ascertain some differences of the antibody response. In a mass survey it appears useful the use of two methods, i.e., ALSO and MSK; in investigations aiming at recognizing the cases with cardiac or rheumatic silent lesions the couple MSK-STZ appears to be more reliable. To ensure a more sure covering of the whole field of streptococcal silent infections, the three methods should be used together."

Three swab-sample-processing protocols with different time-to-result (TTR) values were compared: (i) direct smearing of fresh swabs onto microscope slides (n=153, TTR 2.5 h), (ii) further extraction and concentration of cells from these same swabs (n=153, TTR 2.7 h), and (iii) short-term LIM broth enrichment culture incubation (7 h, 37 degrees C) of fresh swabs (n=120, TTR 9.5 h). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value for GBS PNA FISH for sample processing procedures, with TTR values of 2.5, 2.7 and 9.5 h, were 68, 100, 100 and 95 %; 91, 100, 100 and 98 %; and 100, 100, 100 and 100 %; respectively.

Little is known about the critical epidemiologic parameter of genetic relatedness between isolates. We determined the emm types of 65 Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis isolates. We formulated multilocus sequence typing (MLST) primers with 6 of the 7 loci corresponding to the Streptococcus pyogenes MLST scheme. We performed MLST with 69 S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis isolates to represent each emm type identified. These strains were further analyzed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) typing. Sixteen emm types were observed. Eighteen unique combinations of allelic profiles (sequence types [STs]) were obtained with 12 profiles each accounting for multiple isolates. Forty-one MLST STs were observed. Analysis of the PFGE patterns generated revealed 10 clones. Over 80% of the isolates were distributed in 3 large clones. Isolates within 16 redundantly represented S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis emm types shared identical or nearly identical STs and subtypes of PFGE, demonstrating concordance between the emm type and genetic relatedness. It is conceivable that some particular characteristics in the genomes of these strains are responsible for their predominance in different regions."

Eighty percent of these isolates had emm sequences and T-antigen types in agreement with previously recorded M- and T-antigen associations. Most of the remaining strains either were T nontypeable (11%) or contained emm genes encoding M proteins for which T-antigen associations have not been made (6%). One newly encountered emm gene, designated ST2974, from each of 13 isolates had the T type 8/25/Imp19. Another new emm gene, ST2967, from 8 of 11 isolates was T nontypeable. Six other unique emm gene sequences from seven isolates were encountered. Sequencing of the variable region of the emm gene of GAS isolates (emm typing) is effective for surveying the sequence variability of the M virulence protein, and combined with T typing, emm typing is useful for monitoring GAS strain diversity."
CD010502,0,3055203,0,"Structure, function, and genetics of streptococcal M protein.","Streptococcal M protein is a coiled-coil fibrillar structure extending about 60 nm from the cell wall. From DNA sequencing of the M6 protein gene, it has been determined that the C-terminal end contains a membrane anchor and an adjacent cell wall stabilization domain, both of which are similar to C-terminal regions of surface proteins in other gram-positive organisms. Studies with monoclonal antibodies revealed that the C-terminal half of the protein is conserved among M proteins of different serotypes, whereas the N-terminal half varies. The M protein contains tandem repeats, which, through homologous recombination, are responsible for the observed size variation of the M proteins from different streptococcal strains. M protein size mutants occur in a laboratory-grown culture at a frequency of 1/2,000 colony-forming units. DNA sequence analysis of the M gene in size mutants derived from a single strain suggests that sequence changes which result from homologous recombination may play a role in the antigenic variation of M protein."
CD010502,0,3055205,0,Surface-localized protein antigens of group B streptococci.,"There are three major surface-localized protein antigens of group B streptococci: c, R, and X. Their precise role in human immunity to group B streptococci has not been defined. Studies of the c protein suggested that type II strains possessing both trypsin-resistant and trypsin-sensitive components of the c protein were less easily killed in vitro and were more virulent in an infant rat model of infection as compared with type II strains that do not bear these proteins. The c protein components were immunogenic in mice and rabbits. Polyclonal rabbit antisera were protective in the infant rat model of bacteremia/sepsis and facilitated killing of type II strains bearing the c protein in an in vitro opsonophagocytic bacterial killing assay. The role of the IgA-binding capacity of the c protein in altering the interaction of group B streptococcal strains with host defenses remains undefined at this time."
CD010502,0,7718212,0,Superantigens and their role in infectious disease.,"Although the exact mechanisms by which superantigens may contribute to the pathogenesis of diseases are unknown, it seems increasingly likely that they have a role in the induction and pathogenesis of disease. The studies described here demonstrate that in several different diseases either bacterial or viral superantigens can be isolated from patients. There is also a preferential expansion of particular V beta T-cell subsets, which is a common feature of superantigen stimulation. From the work that has been done to date it can be hypothesized that superantigens may act in several ways. They may stimulate and activate T cells that are autoreactive and lead to the induction or exacerbation of autoimmune disease, as in RA. Alternatively, they may lead to the depletion of T-cell subsets based on V beta expression, thereby resulting in the severe reduction in lymphocytes in certain immunodeficiency diseases such as AIDS. But perhaps the most likely contribution of superantigens to disease pathogenesis is seen indirectly by their effect on the immune system-particularly the stimulation of large numbers of T lymphocytes expressing the same V beta domain. Thus it is likely that the direct effect of various T-cell-derived inflammatory mediators (i.e., interleukins and other cytokines) released by these activated T lymphocytes is the primary cause of disease pathology via response to superantigen stimulation. In addition to the diseases discussed here, there are a number of other diseases in which a potential role for superantigens is being studied. These include autoimmune diseases seen after group A streptococcal infections in which the streptococcal M protein has been postulated to act as a superantigen such as scarlet fever, rheumatic heart disease, and poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis. Other diseases being studied include psoriasis, lupus-like disease, and lymphoproliferative diseases (reviewed in Kotzin et al.). In the coming years the exact role of superantigens and the specific mechanisms by which they contribute to disease should be more clearly defined. Our understanding of these molecules could also lead to new therapies for the treatment of these diseases."

CD010502,0,3025903,0,The diagnosis of mononucleosis in the office laboratory.,"Infectious mononucleosis has been known for a long time to be a common infection in young adults. It also infects children. In particular, children under the age of 2 years may not express the illness clinically. Diagnostic criteria vary but in young adults usually include the symptoms of fever, exudative tonsillitis, and cervical lymphadenopathy. Usually, there is a relative and absolute lymphocytosis, with 10 to 20 per cent or greater atypical lymphocytes. Rapid slide tests are accurate and economical and support the diagnosis when positive. False-positive results are known to occur with several other important disease processes; therefore, the clinical presentation and laboratory results must be interpreted in their appropriate context. Quality control is essential even for the rapid slide tests, and experienced examiners are required to review blood smears. The morphology of atypical lymphocytes varies greatly. In addition, morphology interpretation can be hampered by problems in preparation of slides or the holding of blood samples awaiting slide preparation. EBV-specific serodiagnosis has significantly enhanced our ability to study further and differentiate heterophil-negative syndromes that share clinical features with infectious mononucleosis. Acute, past, chronic, and no EBV infection can now be differentiated. Further diagnostic tests for other etiologic agents are necessary when all EBV tests are negative and the clinical situation requires appropriate diagnosis."

M6c was also detected in the culture medium. The pip-emm6c allele was integrated into the chromosome and stably expressed without antibiotic selection. The level of cell-associated surface expression of PipM6c was 0.015% of total cellular protein. The amount of PipM6c on the cell surface was increased about 17-fold by expressing pip-emm6c from a high-copy-number plasmid. Replacing the native pip promoter with stronger promoters isolated previously from Lactobacillus acidophilus increased surface expression of PipM6c from the high-copy-number plasmid up to 27-fold. Concomitantly, the amount of PipM6c in the medium increased 113-fold. The amount of PipM6c did not vary greatly between exponential- and stationary-phase cultures. Western blots indicated that the full-length PipM6c protein and most of the numerous proteolytic products were found only on the cell surface, whereas only one proteolytic fragment was found in the culture medium."

CD010502,0,3536986,0,Serial studies on the cellular immune response to streptococcal antigens in acute and convalescent rheumatic fever patients in Trinidad.,"Acute rheumatic fever (ARF) has the characteristics of an autoimmune disease, triggered by cross-reactive antigens shared by the group A streptococcus and a variety of tissues including the heart, endothelium, and basal ganglia. Using two parameters of cellular reactivity, migration inhibition and blastogenic transformation, ARF patients from Trinidad show significant lymphocyte reactivity to streptococcal antigens, particularly those from an ARF associated streptococcal strain. This reactivity, studied over a 2-year period, peaked at 1 to 6 months after the acute onset and remained significantly elevated for at least 2 years. The reactivity is directed mainly toward a nonionic detergent extractable material in the cell membrane. These studies suggest a possible streptococcal strain specificity in ARF and demonstrate persistent sensitization, which explains the increased susceptibility to recurrences in the 2 years following the acute episode."

Demographical and clinical information concerning the patients was obtained from the medical files. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to determine risk-factors for fatal outcome. Invasive isolates were obtained from 475 patients, with 251 (52.8%) of the isolates cultured from blood. The most frequent emm types were emm1 (36.4%), emm28 (8.8%) and emm3 (8%). The speA, speC and ssa genes were present at variable frequencies in different emm types. The highest frequencies of speA and speC were found in emm1 (speA, 93.6%) and emm4 (speC, 94.7%), respectively. The estimated annual incidence of invasive GAS disease for 1997-2002 was 0.1 cases/100 000 individuals. This apparently low incidence rate might be explained by the voluntary nature of the surveillance system, resulting in relatively few cases being referred to the laboratory. Complete clinical information was available for 165 cases. The overall case fatality rate was 40.6%, and was highest (65.2%) in the group aged 60-69 years. Shock, an age of >or=30 years and adult respiratory distress syndrome were predictors of a fatal outcome in a multiple logistic regression analysis. Overall, 6.7% of the cases were considered to be nosocomial, and nine cases of puerperal sepsis were observed. The study underscores the importance of invasive S. pyogenes disease in Germany."

Out of 906 isolates, 872 isolates were divided into 20 T serotypes, and 34 isoltes were T nontypeable (TNT). T12, T1, and T4 were dominant among 699 throat isolates; on the other hand, T11, T28, TB3264, and TNT were dominant among 80 skin isolates. The emm types of 190 isolates were determined following specific PCR amplification and sequencing of the products. Twenty T serotypes were divided into 34 T type/emm type combinations. Thirty-four TNT isolates were divided into 14 emm types, in which emm58 was the most common (38%). Among 82 throat isolates randomly selected, predominant T types T12, T1, and T4 isolates were of the respective same numbers in emm type. T11/emm89, T28/emm28, TB3264/emm13w, and TNT/emm58 were predominant among 80 skin isolates. emm-type distribution observed in the present study was that usually reported in the western world.

The reaction of the sodium dodecyl sulfate-extracted proteins of whole S. mutans, serotype b), and S. rattus with the mAb revealed that the shared cross-reactive antigens were near m.w. 62,000 to 67,000. Several higher m.w. proteins in S. mutans Ingbritt 175 reacted with the mAb but were not observed in the other two strains of streptococci. Cytoplasmic membranes of S. rattus BHT reacted with these mAb in the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot. The most reactive BHT membrane component detected by these mAb was a 62-kDa polypeptide that was similar in m.w. to the membrane component recognized by these antibodies in purified S. pyogenes membranes. The reactivity of the mAb with BHT membranes in the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was absorbed by rabbit skeletal muscle myosin.

CD010502,0,12183536,0,Streptococcal inhibitor of complement inhibits two additional components of the mucosal innate immune system: secretory leukocyte proteinase inhibitor and lysozyme.,"Streptococcal inhibitor of complement (SIC) is a 31-kDa extracellular protein of a few, very virulent, strains of Streptococcus pyogenes (particularly M1 strains). It is secreted in large quantities (about 5 mg/liter) and inhibits complement lysis by blocking the membrane insertion site on C5b67. We describe investigations into the interaction of SIC with three further major components of the innate immune system found in airway surface liquid, namely, secretory leukocyte proteinase inhibitor (SLPI), lysozyme, and lactoferrin. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays showed that SIC binds to SLPI and to both human and hen egg lysozyme (HEL) but not to lactoferrin. Studies using (125)I-labeled proteins showed that SIC binds approximately two molecules of SLPI and four molecules of lysozyme. SLPI binding shows little temperature dependence and a small positive enthalpy, suggesting that the binding is largely hydrophobic. By contrast, lysozyme binding shows strong temperature dependence and a substantial negative enthalpy, suggesting that the binding is largely ionic. Lysozyme is precipitated from solution by SIC. Further studies examined the ability of SIC to block the biological activities of SLPI and lysozyme. An M1 strain of group A streptococci was killed by SLPI, and the antibacterial activity of this protein was inhibited by SIC. SIC did not inhibit the antiproteinase activity of SLPI, implying that there is specific inhibition of the antibacterial domain. The antibacterial and enzymatic activities of lysozyme were also inhibited by SIC. SIC is the first biological inhibitor of the antibacterial action of SLPI to be described and may prove to be an important tool for investigating this activity in vivo. Inhibition of the antibacterial actions of SLPI and lysozyme would be advantageous to S. pyogenes in establishing colonization on mucosal surfaces, and we propose that this is the principal function of SIC."

Typical symptoms of these infections are hypotension, edema formation, tissue necrosis, and bleeding disorders. Here we report that components of the coagulation system including fibrinogen, factors V, XI, and XII, and H-kininogen, are assembled at the surface of S. pyogenes through specific interactions with bacterial surface proteins. In plasma environment, absorption of fibrinogen by S. pyogenes causes a hypocoagulatory state resulting in prolonged clotting times and impaired fibrin network formation. Moreover, the binding of coagulation factors and the subsequent activation of the coagulation system at the bacterial surface lead to the formation of a fibrin network covering S. pyogenes bacteria adhering to epithelial cells. The results suggest that interactions between S. pyogenes and components of the coagulation system contribute to some of the symptoms seen in severe infections caused by this important human pathogen."

CD010502,0,14522456,0,Role of M3 protein in the adherence and internalization of an invasive Streptococcus pyogenes strain by epithelial cells.,"Streptococcus pyogenes utilizes multiple mechanisms for adherence to and internalization by epithelial cells. One of the molecules suggested of being involved in adherence and internalization is the M protein. Although strains of the M3 serotype form the second largest group isolated from patients with severe invasive diseases and fatal infections, not much information is known regarding the interactions of M3 protein with mammalian cells. In this study we have constructed an emm3 mutant of an invasive M3 serotype (SP268), and demonstrated that the M3 protein is involved in both adherence to and internalization by HEp-2 cells. Fibronectin promoted both adherence and internalization of SP268 in an M3-independent pathway. Utilizing speB and speB/emm3 double mutants, it was found that M3 protein is not essential for the maturation of SpeB, as was reported for the M1 protein. Increased internalization efficiency observed in both the speB and emm3/speB mutants suggested that inhibition of S. pyogenes internalization by SpeB is not related to the presence of an intact M3 protein. Thus, other proteins in SP268, which serve as targets for SpeB activity, have a prominent role in the internalization process."
CD010502,0,14770076,0,Defining the optimum treatment regimen for azithromycin in acute tonsillopharyngitis.,"Pharyngitis is one of the most common infectious diseases affecting children. Group A streptococci are the leading bacterial cause of pharyngitis in children and adults. Because inappropriate antibiotic treatment for pharyngitis is becoming a major issue, only true group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS) infections, proven by rapid antigen test or culture, should be treated with antibiotics. GABHS pharyngitis is often a mild and self-limiting infection in the absence of antimicrobial therapy. However, antimicrobial treatment must be administered to eradicate the pathogen from the throat, limit the spread of the infection and prevent possible progression to rheumatic fever, suppurative disease or toxin-mediated complications. Penicillin V for 10 days is the standard therapy and is effective in the management of GABHS pharyngitis. However, there are drawbacks to penicillin V therapy, including the length of the dosing regimen, which are leading to decreasing penicillin prescription rates in many countries. In addition bacteriologic treatment failures have been documented in up to 35% of GABHS patients treated with penicillin V, particularly in children <6 years old. A number of mechanisms may be responsible for these failures, but poor compliance with the standard 10-day penicillin treatment is likely to be a major factor. There is growing evidence to suggest that children with GABHS pharyngitis can be effectively treated with non-penicillin V antibiotics, which have the advantage of simpler and shorter dosing regimens compared with penicillin V. Among the antibiotics that have been tested clinically, azithromycin is the most widely studied. A total dose of 60 mg/kg azithromycin, given either as 12 mg/kg once daily for 5 days or 20 mg/kg once daily for 3 days, provides the best rate of GABHS eradication. Thus a total dose of 60 mg/kg azithromycin given during 3 or 5 days constitutes an alternative treatment to standard penicillin therapy in cases of penicillin hypersensitivity, when patient nonadherence to a 10-day penicillin regimen is suspected or for patients who fail therapy with a beta-lactam."
CD010502,0,6423540,0,Type-specific capsular antigen is associated with virulence in late-onset group B Streptococcal type III disease.,"Strain differences have been postulated to explain the observation that group B Streptococcus type III (GBS III) late-onset disease occurs in only a fraction of colonized infants. To determine the distribution of type-specific polysaccharide antigen (Ag) in GBS III, Ag was measured by rocket immunoelectrophoresis in both supernatant fluids and EDTA extracts and by radial immunodiffusion in multiple HCl extracts of the pellet from cultures of 10 strains of GBS III. Capsular Ag was defined as the sum of Ag in EDTA extracts + Ag in multiple HCl extracts. Both Ag in EDTA extracts and Ag in supernatant fluids correlated with capsular Ag (r = 0.94). GBS III strains were obtained from the blood of 19 infants with late-onset sepsis, from the cerebrospinal fluid or blood of 22 infants with late-onset meningitis, and from mucosal surfaces of both 18 infants and 12 mothers of infants with low levels of type-specific antibody and asymptomatic colonization. Mean values of Ag in supernatant fluids in strains from infants with late-onset sepsis (1.50 +/- 0.08 micrograms/ml) and late-onset meningitis (1.67 +/- 0.09 micrograms/ml) were significantly greater than those in asymptomatic colonization strains (1.14 +/- 0.05 micrograms/ml; P less than 0.001). The number of organisms required for a 50% lethal dose in the chick embryo, determined in 29 strains, was inversely related to Ag in supernatant fluids (r = -0.60). The demonstration that the quantity of capsular Ag produced by GBS III strains is related to their virulence in chick embryos and to their invasiveness in susceptible infants supports the hypothesis that Ag is a virulence factor in humans."

CD010502,0,8576332,0,Molecular subtyping of prevalent M serotypes of Streptococcus pyogenes causing invasive disease.,"Reproducible methodologies and a scheme for high-resolution genotyping of Streptococcus pyogenes were defined with respect to a study of six predominant M serotypes causing invasive group A streptococcal disease in the United Kingdom. Serotype reference strains were compared with nine clinical isolates of each serotype from patients with diseases such as pneumonia, puerperal sepsis, toxic shock-like-syndrome, cellulitis, or necrotizing fasciitis. Four enzymes were evaluated for their discriminatory power in 16S rRNA gene-specific ribotyping. Discriminatory power was greatest with EcoRI, which generated serotype-specific ribotypes, and with SacI, which could subdivide strains of the same M serotype. Twenty-five combined ribotypes were found among the 60 strains, and the indices of discriminatory power (D values) of this method varied from 0.51 within serotype M1 to 0.98 within strains of serotype M5. Macrorestriction with the rarely cutting endonuclease SmaI and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis gave D values varying from 0.37 within serotype M1 to the maximal 1.0 within serotype M5. Comparison of macrorestriction profiles revealed various degrees of genetic heterogeneity within M serotypes. Strains of M1, M3, M6, and M11 exhibited clonally related macrorestriction profiles, while those of R28 and M5 strains were consistent with polyphyletic origin."
CD010502,0,14715751,0,Characterization of group C and G streptococcal strains that cause streptococcal toxic shock syndrome.,"Twelve strains (the largest number ever reported) of group C and G(1) streptococci (GCS and GGS, respectively) that caused streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS) were collected and characterized. Eleven strains were identified as Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis, and one strain was identified as Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus. We found that it was the first reported case of STSS caused by S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus. Cluster analysis according to the 16S rRNA gene (rDNA) sequences revealed that the S. dysgalactiae strains belonged to clusters I and II, both of which were closely related. The emm types and the restriction patterns of chromosomal DNA measured by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis were highly variable in these strains except BL2719 and N1434. The 16S rDNA sequences and other characteristics of these two strains were indistinguishable, suggesting the clonal dissemination of this particular S. dysgalactiae strain in Japan. As the involvement of superantigens in the pathogenesis of group A streptococcus-related STSS has been suggested, we tried to detect known streptococcal superantigens in GCS and GGS strains. However, only the spegg gene was detected in seven S. dysgalactiae strains, with none of the other superantigen genes being detected in any of the strains. However, the sagA gene was detected in all of the strains except Tokyo1291. In the present study no apparent factor(s) responsible for the pathogenesis of STSS was identified, although close genetic relationships of GCS and GGS strains involved in this disease were suggested."

CD010502,0,1386839,0,Fibronectin-binding protein of Streptococcus pyogenes: sequence of the binding domain involved in adherence of streptococci to epithelial cells.,"The sequence of the fibronectin-binding domain of the fibronectin-binding protein of Streptococcus pyogenes (Sfb protein) was determined, and its role in streptococcal adherence was investigated by use of an Sfb fusion protein in adherence studies. A 1-kb DNA fragment coding for the binding domain of Sfb protein was cloned into the expression vector pEX31 to produce an Sfb fusion protein consisting of the N-terminal part of MS2 polymerase and a C-terminal fragment of the streptococcal protein. Induction of the vector promoter resulted in hyperexpression of fibronectin-binding fusion protein in the cytoplasm of the recombinant Escherichia coli cells. Sequence determination of the cloned 1-kb fragment revealed an in-frame reading frame for a 268-amino-acid peptide composed of a 37-amino-acid sequence which is completely repeated three times and incompletely repeated a fourth time. Cloning of one repeat into pEX31 resulted in expression of small fusion peptides that show fibronectin-binding activity, indicating that one repeat contains at least one binding domain. Each repeat exhibits two charged domains and shows high homology with the 38-amino-acid D3 repeat of the fibronectin-binding protein of Staphylococcus aureus. Sequence comparison with other streptococcal ligand-binding surface proteins, including M protein, failed to reveal significant homology, which suggests that Sfb protein represents a novel type of functional protein in S. pyogenes. The Sfb fusion protein isolated from the cytoplasm of recombinant cells was purified by fast protein liquid chromatography. It showed a strong competitive inhibition of fibronectin binding to S. pyogenes and of the adherence of bacteria to cultured epithelial cells. In contrast, purified streptococcal lipoteichoic acid showed only a weak inhibition of fibronectin binding and streptococcal adherence. These results demonstrate that Sfb protein is directly involved in the fibronectin-mediated adherence of S. pyogenes to epithelial cells."
CD010502,0,9201959,0,C repeats of the streptococcal M1 protein achieve the human serum albumin binding ability by flanking regions which stabilize the coiled-coil conformation.,"The M and M-like proteins of Streptococcus pyogenes are fibrous cell surface proteins. They have multiple binding sites for several human proteins and are composed of the C-terminal anchor domain, the alpha-helical coiled-coil domain, and the N-terminal non-coiled-coil domain. The coiled-coil domain of the M1 protein consists of repeat units called B, C, and D and a spacer unit S between B and C. Recombinant fragments A-B-S-C-D, A-B-S, B-S-C, S-C, S-C-D, C-D, and C of the coiled-coil domain were studied by analyzing their secondary structures and binding affinities to human serum albumin (HSA). As shown by circular dichroism, all fragments are in an alpha-helical conformation. C-D and S-C-D form coiled coils at room temperature and bind below 37 degrees C with high affinity to HSA. C-D and S-C-D unfold in two steps with Tm values of approximately 31 and approximately 65 degrees C; complex formation with HSA increases the unfolding temperatures. B-S-C has a lower alpha-helical content, a less pronounced coiled-coil conformation, and a reduced thermal stability, binds HSA weaker, and is only slightly stabilized by HSA binding in comparison to C-D and S-C-D. C and S-C are less stable than the other fragments and are not organized as coiled coils showing some features of alpha-helical single strands only below 20 degrees C, and binding of HSA was not observed. The results indicate that the formation of coiled-coil structures, supported by flanking D regions and, to a lesser extent also B regions, is essential for the binding of C repeat units to HSA."
CD010502,0,3908467,0,Lack of reliability of primary grouping of beta-hemolytic streptococci by culture of throat swabs with streptocult supplemented with bacitracin disks in general practice.,"Fifty-eight general practitioners took throat swabs from 434 patients with sore throats. Office cultures were performed on Streptocult supplemented with bacitracin disks in an attempt to carry out primary grouping of beta-hemolytic streptococci (BHS). In 424 cases the findings were compared with those obtained in a microbiological laboratory. Streptocult showed a sensitivity of 75% and a specificity of 84% in the detection of BHS. The office-performed grouping procedure of the correctly detected BHS, however, only had a sensitivity of 65% and a specificity of 87%. Overall, as many as 45% of the patients with BHS group A were misdiagnosed. The unsatisfactory results obtained with primary grouping of BHS may be due partly to incorrect determinations of the diameter of the inhibition zone around the bacitracin disks and partly to an inappropriate choice of breakpoint. It is concluded that cultures of throat swabs on Streptocult in general practice should not be accompanied by attempts to carry out primary grouping with bacitracin disks. A laboratory investigation showed that incubation at room temperature for 48 h and at 35 degrees C for 24 h gave identical BHS positivity rates."
CD010502,0,6370570,0,Clinical evaluation of the improved streptex method for grouping streptococci.,"The improved Streptex method for serogrouping streptococci incorporates a new extraction enzyme and a simplified procedure requiring no centrifugation. A total of 114 clinical isolates of beta-hemolytic streptococci were serogrouped from primary plates, isolation plates, and Todd-Hewitt broth cultures using this system. Results were compared to those of the heat extraction Lancefield precipitin method. An additional 33 stock culture isolates of related streptococcal species and 5 strains of Listeria were serogrouped to assess the specificity of the test. Agreement between the two methods was 82.5% with primary plates and 96.5% with both isolation plates and broth cultures. Four isolates from three different serogroups were nongroupable by the Lancefield method, but did agglutinate in specific Streptex antisera; therefore, the enzyme extraction procedure appeared more sensitive than the heat extraction method. Streptex accurately grouped five isolates of gamma-hemolytic group B streptococci, but failed to detect antigen in 33% of the group D streptococcal extracts tested. In addition, cross-reactions were observed with strains of alpha-hemolytic streptococci. Streptex produced fewer ambiguous results and required fewer repeat tests. When used with isolation plates or broth cultures, Streptex is both sensitive and specific for the grouping of beta-hemolytic streptococci of groups A, B, C, F, and G."
CD010502,0,7037956,0,Restricted deposition of C3 on M+ group A streptococci: correlation with resistance to phagocytosis.,"In this report, the mechanism of resistance to phagocytosis by group A streptococci and the participation of M protein in this process were studied. A quantitative fluorometric immunoassay was used to determine the amount of the opsonic third component of complement, C3, fixed by group A streptococci in the presence and absence of M protein. In the absence of M protein, phagocytosis was found to be dependent on the amount of C3 fixed. However, when M protein was present, the streptococci still bound sufficient C3 to have promoted phagocytosis, yet none was observed. Further investigation using immunofluorescent microscopy demonstrated that the C3 fixed to M+ chains was confined to dense patches, interspaced by areas devoid of detectable C3. This uneven distribution of C3 was dependent on the presence of a trypsin-sensitive structure; most likely the M protein. The significance of this restricted C3 deposition with respect to resistance to phagocytosis by group A streptococci is discussed."

CD010502,0,6752032,0,Type-specific protection of neonatal rats from lethal group B streptococcal infection by immune sera obtained from human volunteers vaccinated with type III-specific polysaccharide.,"Sera obtained from human volunteers at 6 weeks after vaccination with highly purified type III polysaccharide antigen prepared from a group B Streptococcus, strain M732, were found to protect neonatal rats from otherwise lethal infection by the homologous strain. The specific antibody content of the sera, expressed in micrograms of antibody protein per milliliter, was determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in conjunction with quantitative precipitin analysis. For two sera studied in detail, the protective dose of antibody for 50% of the animals was 0.4 micrograms. Immune serum obtained from a volunteer who received type II polysaccharide vaccine was not protective against type III infection. Absorption of anti-type III serum by quantitative precipitation of antibodies with type III polysaccharide completely removed the passive protective activity of the serum. The results show that antibodies induced in humans by purified type II polysaccharide give serotype-specific protection in an animal model of neonatal infection."
CD010502,0,15282372,0,Genome-wide molecular dissection of serotype M3 group A Streptococcus strains causing two epidemics of invasive infections.,"Molecular factors that contribute to the emergence of new virulent bacterial subclones and epidemics are poorly understood. We hypothesized that analysis of a population-based strain sample of serotype M3 group A Streptococcus (GAS) recovered from patients with invasive infection by using genome-wide investigative methods would provide new insight into this fundamental infectious disease problem. Serotype M3 GAS strains (n = 255) cultured from patients in Ontario, Canada, over 11 years and representing two distinct infection peaks were studied. Genetic diversity was indexed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, DNA-DNA microarray, whole-genome PCR scanning, prophage genotyping, targeted gene sequencing, and single-nucleotide polymorphism genotyping. All variation in gene content was attributable to acquisition or loss of prophages, a molecular process that generated unique combinations of proven or putative virulence genes. Distinct serotype M3 genotypes experienced rapid population expansion and caused infections that differed significantly in character and severity. Molecular genetic analysis, combined with immunologic studies, implicated a 4-aa duplication in the extreme N terminus of M protein as a factor contributing to an epidemic wave of serotype M3 invasive infections. This finding has implications for GAS vaccine research. Genome-wide analysis of population-based strain samples cultured from clinically well defined patients is crucial for understanding the molecular events underlying bacterial epidemics."

Localization, purification, and comparison with streptococcal-derived M protein.","Type 6 streptococcal M protein produced by E. coli bearing plasmid pJRS42.13 (ColiM6) accumulates in the periplasmic space of this new host. No immunoreactive M protein was found either on the surface of the organism or in the culture medium. The ColiM6 protein was purified from the periplasm and the final preparation consisted of three protein bands of apparent molecular weight 55,000, 57,000, and 59,000. These three bands were identical in migration in SDS PAGE to that of the M protein present in freshly prepared crude periplasm. The amino acid composition of the ColiM6 protein was nearly identical to that of M protein isolated from streptococci with phage lysin (LysM6). Furthermore, except for the amino terminal residue of the LysM6 molecule, the amino terminal sequence of the ColiM6 molecule was identical to those of both LysM6 and M protein released from the streptococcus by limited peptic digestion (PepM6). These results reveal that the molecule produced in the E. coli and transported into the periplasm may be the complete M protein as it exists on the streptococcus. The results also indicate that the systems that process M protein for transport through the cytoplasmic membrane are similar in the streptococcus and E. coli. The purified ColiM6 protein was able to remove opsonic antibodies from both human and rabbit serum, as well as to stimulate the production of opsonic antibodies in rabbits, indicating that the immunodeterminants on this molecule are the same as those found on streptococcal-derived M molecules."
CD010502,0,6368736,0,Common protective antigens of group A streptococcal M proteins masked by fibrinogen.,"The influence of fibrinogen on the opsonization of Group A streptococci by type-specific and cross-reactive anti-M protein antisera was investigated. As previously reported for type 24 streptococci, fibrinogen inhibited the complement-mediated opsonization of types 5, 6, and 19 organisms. Rabbit antisera against large peptide fragments of purified homologous M proteins (pep M proteins) overcame the anti-opsonic effect of fibrinogen in a dose-dependent manner. In the presence of optimal amounts of antibody, bacterial uptake by PMN was equal in serum and plasma, and greater than could be obtained in serum in the absence of antibody. Polyclonal anti-pep M sera contained antibodies directed against fibrinogen-binding as well as fibrinogen-nonbinding sites or regions of the M protein molecule. Three cross-reactive anti-pep M sera included antibodies directed against fibrinogen binding sites or regions of the cross-reacting M proteins. In the two sera studied in detail, these antibodies accounted for a large part of the cross-reacting anti-M antibody present in the sera. We suggest that fibrinogen binding sites on different serotypes of M protein may be structurally and therefore antigenically similar. Conservation of fibrinogen binding sites on M proteins may be related to their protective anti-opsonic function."

The case-list was divided in 4 groups, years 0-2. 2-4. 4-8. 8-12 for the evaluation of the age-related normality range. Under 2 years normal values between 60 and 120 U, from 2 to 12 years normal values under 240 U. In streptococcal infections identical patterns for the pathological values in the 4 age-ranges considered, with positivity percentage from 85% to 95%, thus confirming the same antibody response also in breast-fed children, unlike what occurs for ASO under 2 years, when the response is present only in 25% of the cases and in the 2-4 years age-range in 33.3%. Evident diagnostic superiority of MSK as compared with ASO in adenitis, pyodermic infections, bronchopneumopathies, acute tonsillitis at the onset of symptomatology. In rheumatic disease the percentage of positivity for MSK and ASO is similar, in post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis and in Schoenlein-Henoch syndrome the percentage of positivity for MSK is higher than for ASO. It is suggested the utility of insertion of MSK test in the routine assay for streptococcal infections diagnosis above all in children under 4 years and in infections with low or slow antigenic charge for 0-streptolysin."
CD010502,0,11716272,0,Invasive streptococcal infection of the periorbita and forehead.,"Recent epidemiological reports suggest an increased frequency of invasive streptococcal infections linked to the appearance of a dominant group A Streptococcus serotype. Necrotizing streptococcal infections involving the skin and soft tissues of the face are uncommon. This case demonstrates the aggressive and invasive nature of these infections. The patient presented with symptoms of angioedema and was treated with corticosteroids. Her condition worsened and plastic surgery was consulted. There was extensive necrosis of the periorbital and forehead soft tissue, requiring extensive debridement to control the invasive process. Multiple reconstructive procedures were performed to close the defects and to preserve function of the facial muscles and eyelids. The literature indicates less than 50 reported cases of necrotizing streptococcal infections limited to the periorbita. This case reflects the importance of rapid diagnosis, and emphasizes the need for prompt and appropriate surgical treatment."
CD010502,0,19752034,0,A naturally occurring Rgg variant in serotype M3 Streptococcus pyogenes does not activate speB expression due to altered specificity of DNA binding.,"The transcriptional regulator Rgg of Streptococcus pyogenes is essential for expression of the secreted cysteine protease SpeB. Although all isolates of S. pyogenes possess the speB gene, not all of them produce the protein in vitro. In a murine model of infection, the absence of SpeB production is associated with invasive disease. We speculated that naturally occurring mutations in rgg, which would also abrogate SpeB production, may be present in invasive isolates of S. pyogenes. Examination of the inferred Rgg sequences available in public databases revealed that the rgg gene in strain MGAS315 (a serotype M3 strain associated with invasive disease) encodes a proline at amino acid position 103 (Rgg(103P)); in contrast, all other strains encode a serine at this position (Rgg(103S)). A caseinolytic assay and Western blotting indicated that strain MGAS315 does not produce SpeB in vitro. Gene-swapping experiments showed that the rgg gene of MGAS315 is solely responsible for the lack of SpeB expression. In contrast to Rgg(103S), Rgg(103P) does not bind to the speB promoter in gel shift assays, which correlates with a lack of speB expression. Despite its inability to activate speB expression, Rgg(103P) retains the ability to bind to DNA upstream of norA and to influence its expression. Overall, this study illustrates how variation at the rgg locus may contribute to the phenotypic diversity of S. pyogenes."
CD010502,0,14688145,0,Acquisition of host plasmin activity by the Swine pathogen Streptococcus suis serotype 2.,"In this study, the plasminogen-binding activity of Streptococcus suis serotype 2 was investigated.

Both human and porcine plasminogen were bound by S. suis. Binding was inhibited by epsilon-aminocaproic acid, and the plasminogen receptor was heat and sodium dodecyl sulfate resistant. One of the receptors was identified as glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. S. suis-associated plasmin activity was capable of activating free plasminogen, which in turn could contribute to degradation of fibronectin. This is the first report on the plasminogen-binding activity of S. suis. Further studies may reveal a contribution of this activity to the virulence of S. suis."

A rapid and sensitive method for the detection of GBS colonization in pregnant women at delivery could make intrapartum screening for GBS possible. A real-time PCR method targeting the sip gene of GBS in pregnant women at delivery has been evaluated. The performance of the real-time PCR was compared with optimized GBS culture. Separate vaginal and rectal swabs were collected from women hospitalized at the delivery department at St Olavs Hospital, Trondheim, Norway, from January 15 through May 2005. The specimens were cultured on selective blood agar plates and in selective broth and examined by real-time PCR. Of samples from 251 women, 87 (34.7%) were GBS positive by culture and 86 (34.3%) were positive by PCR. Using GBS culture as the 'gold standard', the sensitivity of real-time PCR was 0.97 (95% confidence interval 0.90-0.99) and specificity was 0.99 (95% confidence interval 0.97-1.00). In two women the PCR was positive and the culture negative. Additional analysis using cylE PCR substantiates that these two women were true GBS carriers with negative GBS culture. The rate of GBS colonization was lower in vaginal specimens than in rectal specimens both by culture and PCR. The real-time PCR assay is fast, highly sensitive and specific for detecting GBS colonization in pregnant women at delivery, and has the potential for intrapartum detection of GBS colonization. Both vaginal and rectal samples are required to achieve highest possible detection rate."

They were characterized by their antimicrobial susceptibility, phenotype (using triple-disc and induction tests), resistance genotype, emm genotyping (M typing) and phylogenetic analysis. Erythromycin resistance was observed in 23% of isolates. Inducible phenotype was the most common (iMLS, 51%, 26 strains), followed by the constitutive phenotype (cMLS, 31%, 16 strains) and the M phenotype (18%, 9 strains). Eight of twenty-six iMLS isolates exhibited the iMLS-C phenotype. The remaining 18 isolates gave small inhibition zones (<12 mm) around all three discs, and mild blunting of the spiramycin and clindamycin zones of inhibition proximal to the erythromycin disc. They showed remarkable inducibility in erythromycin and clindamycin resistance. The MIC90 of erythromycin and clindamycin rose from 8 to >128 microg ml-1 and from 0.5 to >128 microg ml-1, respectively. Their resistance characteristics did not fit into any known iMLS subtype reported so far in the literature. So, it was named as an iMLS-D, new subtype. All of these iMLS-D strains harboured the erm(B) gene, demonstrated the emm12 genotype, except one, and formed a tight cluster in a phylogenetic tree, with 89.2 to 100% sequence homology, suggesting that they are closely related. Nine of sixteen cMLS strains had the emm28 genotype, which had been reported to be associated with multiple drug resistance."
CD010502,0,3510006,0,A study of anti-group A streptococcal monoclonal antibodies cross-reactive with myosin.,"Anti-group A streptococcal monoclonal antibodies were obtained from BALB c/BYJ mice immunized with purified membranes from M type 5 Streptococcus pyogenes. Two of the anti-streptococcal monoclonal antibodies were previously shown to cross-react with muscle myosin. In this study the monoclonal antibodies were reacted with tissue sections of normal human heart and skeletal muscle. Antibody binding was estimated by indirect immunofluorescence and immunoperoxidase techniques. Both of the monoclonal antibodies (36.2.2 and 54.2.8) investigated in this report reacted with heart and/or skeletal muscle sections. When evaluated by immunofluorescence, monoclonal antibody 54.2.8 demarcated the periphery of cardiac striated muscle cells and reacted to a lesser degree with subsarcolemmal components. Monoclonal antibody 36.2.2 failed to react with heart sections, but both of the monoclonal antibodies reacted strongly with skeletal muscle sections. Results similar to those observed with indirect immunofluorescence were obtained with the immunoperoxidase technique. By Western immunoblotting and competitive inhibition assays, monoclonal antibodies 36.2.2 and 54.2.8 both were found to react with the heavy chain of skeletal muscle myosin. However, only 54.2.8 reacted with the heavy chain of cardiac myosin. The specificity of the monoclonal antibodies for subfragments of skeletal muscle myosin indicated that monoclonal antibody 36.2.2 was specific for light meromyosin fragments, whereas 54.2.8 reacted with both heavy and light meromyosin. The data demonstrated that two monoclonal antibodies against streptococci were specific for skeletal muscle and/or cardiac myosin and for subfragments of the myosin molecule. The reactions of the monoclonal antibodies with human tissue sections were consistent with the immunochemical reactions of the monoclonal antibodies with both denatured and native myosin."
CD010502,0,20624906,0,Novel conserved group A streptococcal proteins identified by the antigenome technology as vaccine candidates for a non-M protein-based vaccine.,"Group A streptococci (GAS) can cause a wide variety of human infections ranging from asymptomatic colonization to life-threatening invasive diseases. Although antibiotic treatment is very effective, when left untreated, Streptococcus pyogenes infections can lead to poststreptococcal sequelae and severe disease causing significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. To aid the development of a non-M protein-based prophylactic vaccine for the prevention of group A streptococcal infections, we identified novel immunogenic proteins using genomic surface display libraries and human serum antibodies from donors exposed to or infected by S. pyogenes. Vaccine candidate antigens were further selected based on animal protection in murine lethal-sepsis models with intranasal or intravenous challenge with two different M serotype strains. The nine protective antigens identified are highly conserved; eight of them show more than 97% sequence identity in 13 published genomes as well as in approximately 50 clinical isolates tested. Since the functions of the selected vaccine candidates are largely unknown, we generated deletion mutants for three of the protective antigens and observed that deletion of the gene encoding Spy1536 drastically reduced binding of GAS cells to host extracellular matrix proteins, due to reduced surface expression of GAS proteins such as Spy0269 and M protein. The protective, highly conserved antigens identified in this study are promising candidates for the development of an M-type-independent, protein-based vaccine to prevent infection by S. pyogenes."
CD010502,0,14557923,1,External quality control of direct antigen tests to detect group A streptococcal antigen.,"Presented here are the results of an external quality control survey organized by the Swiss Center for Quality Control (CSCQ) to evaluate the performance of direct antigen tests (DATs) widely used in Swiss medical practices and laboratories for the diagnosis of group A streptococcal pharyngitis. Twice yearly over a 4-year period, just over 100 participants were requested to analyze positive, weakly positive and negative samples provided to them by the CSCQ with their routinely used DATs and to send the results to the CSCQ. For 1,620 samples distributed, the CSCQ received 1,484 (91.6%) results obtained with 17 different DATs. The specificity of all DATs for negative samples was >91%. For samples containing abundant group A streptococcal antigen, sensitivities ranged from 59.1% to 95.5%; however, for samples containing low levels of antigen, the sensitivity was much lower for all DATs, ranging from 8.7% to 69.8%. Therefore, negative DAT results should be verified with well-performed cultures in order to assure the optimal care of patients with pharyngitis."
CD010502,0,8618805,0,Comparison of M and T type antigen testing to field inversion gel electrophoresis in the differentiation of strains of group A streptococcus.,"Recent clusters of patients with acute rheumatic fever and invasive group A Streptococcus (GAS) have stimulated renewed interest in the epidemiology of streptococcal infections. We compared conventional serotyping for M and T antigens and serum opacity factor with field inversion gel electrophoresis (FIGE) for distinguishing among GAS. Fifteen pairs of throat isolates obtained from children positive for GAS before and after therapy were evaluated by conventional serotyping and by FIGE after SmaI digestion. Ten of the 15 pairs were identical by serotyping. FIGE correctly identified the 10 concordant and 5 discordant pairs. Individual clones were identified within each M type tested, including analysis performed on additional isolates of M1 and M3 obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This preliminary experience suggests that FIGE can successfully determine whether serial isolates from a given patient represent persistence of one strain or acquisition of a new strain of GAS and that this method might provide an alternative typing system for GAS."
CD010502,0,2687231,0,Identification of a divergent M protein gene and an M protein-related gene family in Streptococcus pyogenes serotype 49.,"The antigenically variant M protein of Streptococcus pyogenes enhances virulence by promoting resistance to phagocytosis. The serum opacity factor (OF), produced by a subset of M serotypes, is also antigenically variant, and its antigenic variability exactly parallels that of M protein. OF-positive and OF-negative streptococci are also phenotypically distinguishable by a number of other criteria. In order to study the differences between OF-positive and OF-negative streptococci, we cloned and sequenced the type 49 M protein gene (emm49), the first to be cloned from an OF-positive strain. This gene showed evolutionary divergence from the OF-negative M protein genes studied previously. Furthermore, emm49 was part of a gene family, in contrast to the single-copy nature of previously characterized M protein genes."
CD010502,0,11934500,0,Chromosomal analysis of group B streptococcal clinical strains; bac gene-positive strains are genetically homogenous.,"A collection of 45 epidemiologically unrelated Streptococcus agalactiae strains (group B Streptococcus, GBS), belonging to different serotypes, isolated from pregnant women in China and Russia was studied. Strains were characterized by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) employing hybridization with nine genes potentially involved in virulence. Molecular sizes of GBS genomes varied from 2030 to 2290 kb. Location of the genes under study bac, bca, glnA, scpB, cyl, hylB, lmb, scaA and cfb on the GBS genomes was found to be conserved irrelevant to the serotype. Potential virulence genes scpB, hylB, lmb were located on a 91-kb SmaI fragment that is equal to 4.5% of total genome. Ribotyping of the strains under study revealed three different HindIII, nine EcoRI and 12 PvuII ribotypes among 45 strains. A strong correlation between the PvuII ribotype and the presence of the bac gene was observed, with 21 of 22 bac-positive strains belonging to the same PvuII ribotype P1. PFGE patterns of bac-positive strains were also similar. The possibility of close genetic relatedness of all bac-positive strains is discussed."
CD010502,0,8158045,0,The presence of M protein in nontypeable group A streptococcal upper respiratory tract isolates from Southeast Asia.,"Previous studies have suggested that group A streptococcal strains from southeast Asia, serotypically different from temporally related North American and European isolates, may represent unrecognized M serotypes. Sixty non-M typeable group A streptococcal upper respiratory tract isolates from Thailand were evaluated for the presence of M protein using a modification of the direct serum bactericidal test. Of them, 59 (98%) grew rapidly in human blood. Typeability by T agglutination and opacity factor production did not influence their growth in blood. It was concluded that these isolates produce M protein and likely represent previously uncharacterized M serotypes. Identification of such non-M typeable strains is important in understanding the epidemiology and pathogenesis of group A streptococcal infections and their sequelae in areas of the world where they remain a significant health problem and will also be necessary in the development of a vaccine with global efficacy."

CD010502,0,7592441,0,Specific binding of the activator Mga to promoter sequences of the emm and scpA genes in the group A streptococcus.,"Transcription of the surface-associated virulence factors of the group A streptococcus (GAS) Streptococcus pyogenes, M protein (emm) and the C5a peptidase (scpA), is activated by a protein called Mga (formerly Mry or VirR). To determine whether Mga binds directly to the promoters of the genes it regulates, a protein resulting from the fusion of Mga to the C-terminal end of maltose-binding protein was purified from Escherichia coli. Specific binding to the promoter regions of the scpA and emm alleles of the type M6 GAS strain JRS4 was demonstrated by electrophoresis of the DNA-protein complex. Competition studies showed that the region upstream of scpA bound MBP-Mga with a slightly higher affinity than did the region upstream of emm. DNase I protection experiments identified a single 45-bp binding site immediately upstream of and overlapping the -35 region of both promoters. Sequences homologous to the protected regions were found in the promoters of many emm, scp, and emm-like genes from strains of different serotypes of GAS, and a consensus Mga binding site was deduced."

In the other 44 children, the cause of tonsillitis was identified in 16 (beta-hemolytic streptococci or Epstein-Barr, parainfluenza, or herpes simplex viruses). The clinical picture of adenoviral tonsillitis was difficult to differentiate from that of streptococcal disease; 20 of the patients had originally been given antibiotics. In 68% of patients without complications, the serum concentration of C-reactive protein was less than 20 mg/L, suggesting a viral disease. No other hematologic test was found helpful in identifying the adenoviral tonsillitis. The rapid detection of adenovirus antigen permitted withdrawal of unnecessary and ineffective antibiotic treatment in most patients."
CD010502,0,1500854,0,A major surface protein on group A streptococci is a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate-dehydrogenase with multiple binding activity.,"The surface of streptococci presents an array of different proteins, each designed to perform a specific function. In an attempt to understand the early events in group A streptococci infection, we have identified and purified a major surface protein from group A type 6 streptococci that has both an enzymatic activity and a binding capacity for a variety of proteins. Mass spectrometric analysis of the purified molecule revealed a monomer of 35.8 kD. Molecular sieve chromatography and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-gel electrophoresis suggest that the native conformation of the protein is likely to be a tetramer of 156 kD. NH2-terminal amino acid sequence analysis revealed 83% homology in the first 18 residues and about 56% in the first 39 residues with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) of eukaryotic or bacterial origin. This streptococcal surface GAPDH (SDH) exhibits a dose-dependent dehydrogenase activity on glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate in the presence of beta-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide both in its pure form and on the streptococcal surface. Its sensitivity to trypsin on whole organism and its inability to be removed with 2 M NaCl or 2% SDS support its surface location and tight attachment to the streptococcal cell. Affinity-purified antibodies to SDH detected the presence of this protein on the surface of all M serotypes of group A streptococcal tested. Purified SDH was found to bind to fibronectin, lysozyme, as well as the cytoskeletal proteins myosin and actin. The binding activity to myosin was found to be localized to the globular heavy meromyosin domain. SDH did not bind to streptococcal M protein, tropomyosin, or the coiled-coil domain of myosin. The multiple binding capacity of the SDH in conjunction with its GAPDH activity may play a role in the colonization, internalization, and the subsequent proliferation of group A streptococci."
CD010502,0,18754783,0,Superantigen gene profile diversity among clinical group A streptococcal isolates.,"This study examines the diversity of superantigen gene profiles between and within emm-genotypes of 92 clinical group A streptococcal isolates (30 STSS, 24 sepsis, 25 erysipelas, and 12 tonsillitis) collected in Sweden between 1986 and 2001. The emm-genotype and the distribution of smeZ, speG, speJ, speA, speC, speH, speI, speK/L, speL/M, speM, and ssa genes, and the smeZ allelic variant were determined using PCR and DNA sequencing. Forty-five emm1 isolates revealed 10 superantigen gene profiles. One profile dominated and was identified in 22 isolates collected over 14 years. The results indicate that a selective advantage maintained this genotype in circulation. The superantigen content among the emm1 isolates ranged from three to seven, with smeZ-1, speG, and speA present in all but one profile. The 47 isolates of 27 other emm-genotypes exhibited 29 superantigen gene profiles. Thus, the distribution of superantigen genes was highly variable within isolates regardless of emm-genotype. Two novel emm1 subtypes and 14 novel smeZ allelic variants were identified. The 22 smeZ alleles were generally linked to the emm-genotype. The results of the investigation show that superantigen gene profiling is useful for tracking spread of clones in the community."

CD010502,0,11710843,0,Genetic dissection of the Streptococcus pyogenes M1 protein: regions involved in fibronectin binding and intracellular invasion.,"Entry of serotype M1 Streptococcus pyogenes into host cells depends on binding of the host glycoprotein fibronectin (Fn) by the bacterial M1 protein. The present study was undertaken to localize the Fn binding region in M1 and assess other potential functions of M1. A set of recombinant M1 protein fragments were assayed for their capacities to bind Fn and inhibit ingestion of streptococci by epithelial cells. M1 protein, M6 protein and internally-deleted derivatives of M1 were expressed on the surface of Lactococcus lactis. Lactococci that expressed M1 or M6 protein bound Fn and were efficiently taken up by epithelial cells. Deletion of both the N-terminal A and B repeats regions of M1 abrogated Fn binding and intracellular invasion. Deletion of either the A domain (M1DeltaA) or B repeats (M1DeltaB) significantly reduced, but did not completely eliminate, Fn binding indicating that M1 protein may possess two independent Fn binding sites. Fn binding by the M1DeltaA or M1DeltaB proteins was insufficient for efficient invasion, however, suggesting that M protein binding alters the structure of Fn that, in turn, affects the interaction between Fn and epithelial cells. Although expression of M1, M6 or M1DeltaB proteins led to aggregation of lactococcal cells, aggregation did not significantly contribute to invasion efficiency."
CD010502,0,3550680,0,Evaluation of a commercially available latex agglutination test for rapid diagnosis of group B streptococcal infection.,"We studied the clinical value of Wellcogen, a latex particle agglutination test designed to diagnose rapidly Group B streptococcal infections in 620 infants. The sensitivity and specificity were 18 of 20 (90%) and 18 of 22 (81%), respectively. False negatives were documented in 2 patients and false positive tests occurred in 4. Also 10 of 620 (1.6%) infants had detectable antigen in the absence of proved infection. In addition, in 4 other infants with Group B streptococcal bacteremia, antigenemia was absent in serum obtained on the day of hospitalization but antigen was detected in specimens obtained subsequently. We also assayed the sera of 102 randomly chosen hospitalized adults; 4 (4%) contained ""antigen"" but none had Group B streptococcal infection. None of 50 urines obtained from other randomly chosen hospitalized adults contained ""antigen."" In patients with Group B streptococcal meningitis cerebrospinal fluid and unconcentrated urine uniformly contained antigen but in bacteremia without focality, assay of blood and urine were both necessary to diagnose correctly all 7 patients with the Wellcogen test. We conclude that despite acceptable sensitivity and specificity, the interpretation of the Wellcogen test must be performed with caution and knowledge of its limitations."
CD010502,0,7790427,0,Evaluation of a modified nitrous acid extraction latex agglutination kit for grouping beta-hemolytic streptococci and enterococci.,"The rapid and accurate identification of the Lancefield group of beta-hemolytic streptococci and enterococci is an important procedure in clinical laboratories. Latex agglutination techniques are more rapid and technically less demanding than traditional extraction-precipitation methods. Prolex (Pro-Lab Diagnostics, Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada) is a latex agglutination kit which contains modified nitrous acid reagents to extract antigens and can be used to detect group D antigen in streptococci and enterococci, as well as group A, B, C, F, and G antigens. A total of 302 strains of streptococci and enterococci were tested with this kit. All streptococci of groups A (41 strains), B (39 strains), C (35 strains), D (3 strains), F (10 strains), and G (48 strains) were correctly grouped, as were 125 (97%) of 129 strains of enterococci. Prolex is a reliable method for grouping the beta-hemolytic streptococci and enterococci most frequently encountered in clinical laboratories."

Duplicate cultures and duplicate rapid antigen tests were performed in two laboratories. The sensitivity and the specificity of the test were high, supporting the validity of this technique in diagnosing streptococcal pyoderma. Of importance, however, was the documentation of a learning curve effect on the sensitivity and specificity. There was a significant difference between the early samples and the later samples in one laboratory which had less previous experience with the rapid antigen detection test. By the time the later samples were collected, the proficiency of the first laboratory was equal to that of the second laboratory for both sensitivity and specificity. Although a learning curve effect on sensitivity and specificity of rapid antigen detection tests for Group A streptococci has been suspected, this is the first documentation of such an effect. This finding has important clinical implications for using rapid antigen detection tests for Group A streptococcal infections."
CD010502,0,22516912,0,Mucosal immune function comparison between amenorrheic and eumenorrheic distance runners.,"This study examined the effects of amenorrhea on mucosal immune function and susceptibility to upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) in elite female distance runners. Based on their menstrual cycles during the prior year, 21 elite, collegiate, female distance runners were designated as eumenorrheic runners (ERs; n = 8; 19.9 ± 0.8 years) or amenorrheic runners (ARs; n n = 13; 20.0 ± 0.3 years). Resting saliva and blood samples were collected in the morning. The secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA) concentration was measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The SIgA secretion rate was calculated. Serum 17β-estradiol concentrations and serum progesterone concentrations were measured using radioimmunoassay. Subjects reported the appearance of URTI symptoms (sore throat, headache, runny nose, coughing, or fever), if any, during the prior month. The serum estradiol concentration and salivary SIgA secretion rate were significantly lower for ARs than for ERs (p < 0.05). Serum progesterone concentration was not significantly different between groups. Higher frequencies of headache, runny nose, coughing, and fever were observed in ARs than in ERs. Results show that athletic amenorrhea with low estrogen might accelerate downregulation of mucosal immune function in athletes and enhance susceptibility to infection."
CD010502,0,7035391,0,Use of radioimmunoassay for the detection of circulating antistreptococcal antibody in patients with glomerulonephritis.,"A method of radioimmunologic quantitation of antibodies to streptococcal antigen separated from the cell wall extract of group A type T12 strain has been developed. The highest values of radioactive antigen binding were observed in acute glomerulonephritis (75%), as compared to chronic glomerulonephritis in which values of 25% to 56% were found depending on the morphology of renal changes. It was shown that none of the patients with pyelonephritis, Alport's syndrome, lupoid nephritis and polycystic renal disease had elevated antistreptococcal antibody levels. In contrast to this, all patients with tonsillitis and proteinuria exhibited increased titre of this antibody. It was shown that the antigen is related neither to M-protein nor to group A polysaccharide and that it is not type-specific because the binding of antigen T12 may be inhibited by the antigen produced from strain T5. Although the antigen is not type-specific, some differences in the response to antigens prepared from various types of streptococci in patients with different forms of chronic glomerulonephritis are observed."

Evidence for multiple cross-reactive epitopes.,"Association of group A streptococci with acute rheumatic fever and valvular heart disease is well established; however the basis of valve injury remains unclear. In this study, anti-streptococcal monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) cross-reactive with myocardium were reacted with sections from 22 rheumatic valves, nine normal, five endocarditic, one 'floppy,' and one Marfan valve. In immunohistochemical studies, MAb reactivity was observed with cardiac myocytes, smooth muscle cells, cell surface and cytoplasm of endothelial cells lining valves, and valvular interstitial cells. Endothelial basement membrane and elastin fibrils reacted with the MAbs, whereas collagen was unreactive. Similar reactivity was seen with sera from acute rheumatic fever patients. The anti-streptococcal MAbs reacted with intravalvular myosin and vimentin in Western blots, and purified elastin competitively inhibited the binding of the anti-streptococcal MAbs to whole group A streptococci. The data show that human heart valves have numerous sites of immunoreactivity with anti-streptococcal MAbs and acute rheumatic fever sera of potential importance in the pathogenesis of rheumatic valvular injury."

CD010502,0,21795693,0,Human Siglec-5 inhibitory receptor and immunoglobulin A (IgA) have separate binding sites in streptococcal beta protein.,"Sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectins (Siglecs) are receptors believed to be important for regulation of cellular activation and inflammation. Several pathogenic microbes bind specific Siglecs via sialic acid-containing structures at the microbial surface, interactions that may result in modulation of host responses. Recently, it was shown that the group B Streptococcus (GBS) binds to human Siglec-5 (hSiglec-5), an inhibitory receptor expressed on macrophages and neutrophils, via the IgA-binding surface β protein, providing the first example of a protein/protein interaction between a pathogenic microbe and a Siglec. Here we show that the hSiglec-5-binding part of β resides in the N-terminal half of the protein, which also harbors the previously determined IgA-binding region. We constructed bacterial mutants expressing variants of the β protein with non-overlapping deletions in the N-terminal half of the protein. Using these mutants and recombinant β fragments, we showed that the hSiglec-5-binding site is located in the most N-terminal part of β (B6N region; amino acids 1-152) and that the hSiglec-5- and IgA-binding domains in β are completely separate. We showed with BIAcore(TM) analysis that tandem variants of the hSiglec-5- and IgA-binding domains bind to their respective ligands with high affinity. Finally, we showed that the B6N region, but not the IgA-binding region of β, triggers recruitment of the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 to hSiglec-5 in U937 monocytes. Taken together, we have identified and isolated the first microbial non-sialic acid Siglec-binding region that can be used as a tool in studies of the β/hSiglec-5 interaction."
CD010502,0,9021233,0,Incidence and studies on antigenic specificities of antineutrophil-cytoplasmic autoantibodies (ANCA) in poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis.,"Sera from 210 patients with Acute Poststreptococcal Glomerulonephritis (APSGN) and 14 patients with streptococcal impetigo without glomerular disease were tested for the presence of IgG-ANCA using an indirect immunofluorescence assay (IIF) on ethanol fixed normal human neutrophils. In the group of nephritic patients, ANCA were detected by IIF in 9% (18 out of 210 cases) in an atypical diffuse cytoplasmic pattern (a-ANCA) in 14 cases and in a (p-ANCA) perinuclear staining in the remaining 4 cases. Longitudinal studies performed on six IIF positive patients, showed persistence of the phenomenon for up to six months, without relationship with activity of disease. No patient with streptococcal impetigo showed positivity on the IIF assay. Positive sera were analyzed on ELISA plates for their IgG reactivity against specific purified ANCA antigens: Proteinase-3 (PR3), Myeloperoxidase (MPO). Cathepsin-G and Bactericidal/Permeability Increasing Protein (BPI). Anti-MPO antibodies were present in 4 cases (3 a-ANCA and 1 p-ANCA). No reactivity was identified against PR-3, BPI and Catepsin-G in any of the samples. The presence of ANCA was significantly associated with a more severe glomerular disease as assessed by the serum creatinine and the crescents formation. Further studies are required to identify other antigenic specificities of these autoantibodies. Their absence in the streptococcal impetigo control group might suggest that their presence in APSGN could play some pathogenic role in kidney disease."
CD010502,0,9021234,0,Circulating levels of cytokines in poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis.,"Cellular immune mechanisms are important in the pathogenesis of acute glomerulonephritis, as underlined by recent demonstrations of cytokine activity in the urine and in the renal tissue of some of these patients. Therefore, we decided to study circulating levels of IL-6, TNF alpha and PDGF measured by ELISA in 12 patients with acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN) on admission, at the time of discharge from the hospital, 45 days and 3 months later. We also studied 9 patients with acute streptococcal pharyngitis without nephritis, during acute infection, 8 and 21 days later and 20 normal children (control group). On admission, patients with PSGN had increased IL-6 levels (12.4 +/- 4 pg/ml vs control = 2.57 +/- 0.34 pg/ml, p < 0.05) which returned to normal at the time of discharge from the hospital, 8 to 17 days later. TNF alpha was also elevated in the acute phase (8.11 +/- 1.19 pg/ml vs 3.74 +/- 1.4 pg/ml in controls, p < 0.005) but significant individual variation was detected in serial determinations. Levels of PDGF were always normal. In acute streptococcal tonsillitis without nephritis, IL-6 and TNF alpha were increased at the time of active infection, but levels of IL-6 fell to the normal range after 1 week while the increase observed in association with PSGN develops 2 to 3 weeks after infection and followed the clinical course of the disease."

CD010502,0,18225491,0,[T-cell responsiveness to specific group A streptococcus antigens in patients with primary erysipelas].,"Peripheral blood leukocytic migratory activity (LMA) was studied in 63 patients with primary erysipelas. To reveal LMA, a screening cell migration test (SCMT) was used as an indicator of the cooperation of T- and B-lymphocytes and macrophages in the stimulation with polysaccharide A, surface proteins, L-antigen, hyaluronidase, streptolysin O, a complete S. pyogenes antigen complex after Grasse. The prognostic value of MAL parameters was established at week 1 after the onset of erysipelas. A rapid transition of LMA from the phase of acceleration to that of inhibition was shown to characterize the formation of an adequate response, to correspond to the good course of the disease, and to be followed by the low likelihood of recurrences. The probability of a subsequent recurrence is much higher than that when LMA tends to transit from suppression to acceleration and when LMA parameters are constant in the phase of suppression or acceleration. No transition of LMA to the phase of suppression in early convalescence suggests that the formation of an immune response to streptococcus is delayed."
CD010502,0,6384047,0,Murine monoclonal antibodies reactive with human heart and group A streptococcal membrane antigens.,"Ten selected murine hybridoma cell lines that produce monoclonal antibodies against M type 5 Streptococcus pyogenes and human heart antigen were isolated. All of the monoclonal antibodies studied were determined to be the immunoglobulin M isotype. The antibodies were characterized on the basis of their reactions with Triton X-100-extracted whole human heart antigens, sodium dodecyl sulfate-extracted sarcolemmal antigens, and whole streptococci or their membranes. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and Western immunoblotting techniques were used to compare the reactivity of the monoclonal antibodies. All 10 of the antibodies were first selected for their reactivity with Triton X-100-extracted heart antigens and whole group A, M type 5 streptococci. These antibodies were then divided into two categories: strong reactors or weak reactors with human sarcolemmal and streptococcal membranes. Among the strong reactors, two different types of monoclonal antibodies were observed on the basis of their immunobanding patterns with sarcolemmal and streptococcal membranes on Western blots. Monoclonal antibodies that were strong reactors with sarcolemmal and group A streptococcal membrane antigen were directed against a determinant on a family of proteins. The major reactants of sarcolemmal extracts were high-molecular-weight proteins near 200,000. Some monoclonal antibodies demonstrated more specificity for the heart than did others when reacted with separated Triton X-100-extracted tissue antigens from the heart, kidney, and skeletal muscle. One of the monoclonal antibodies that reacted with group A streptococci reacted with a Triton X-100-extracted heart antigen ca. 40,000 daltons in size. None of these monoclonal antibodies opsonized type 5 Streptococcus pyogenes, and in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays most of the antibodies were found to react to a lesser degree with other groups of streptococci. Monoclonal antibody was used to probe normal and rheumatic sarcolemma for differences in reactivity. Although the rheumatic heart reacted more intensely, no major differences between the immunobanding patterns of normal and rheumatic hearts were observed."

Although H. pylori infects up to more than half of the world's population, to date the precise modes of transmission has not been fully understood yet. Therefore a study was planned to investigate whether the tonsils and the adenoid tissue were the reservoir or the gate for the entrance of H. pylori."
CD010502,0,9882576,0,"SPEX, a system for the expression of recombinant proteins from gram-positive bacterial vectors.","Using a conserved pathway for surface protein extrusion, a system has been developed for the expression and secretion of proteins from gram-positive bacteria. As proof-of-concept, the Streptococcus gordonii Challis strain has been engineered to express a series of recombinant proteins fused to the conserved region of the M6 protein of Streptococcus pyogenes. In the prototype surface protein expression system, the recombinant M6 protein is anchored to the surface of S. gordonii cells expressing it. In order to overexpress the protein and easily purify it away from the bacteria, the protein was modified to enable it to be secreted into the medium. To accomplish this, a stop codon was introduced into the gene just prior to the anchor region using site-directed mutagenesis. Using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, it was possible to quantitate the amount of protein expressed using this system. With little or no optimization, 3 mg of protein per liter of culture was expressed and secreted into the medium of a bacterial culture grown to an OD600 equal to 1.0. This system should be broadly applicable for the expression and secretion of a variety of proteins (antigens, hormones, and enzymes) directly into the medium."

CD010502,0,2578835,0,[Determination of antibodies to Streptococcus group A polysaccharide in human sera by an immunoenzyme method].,Use was made of the ELISA to develop a highly sensitive quantitative method for detection of antibodies against Streptococcus group A polysaccharide (polysaccharide A) in human sera. The main advantage is that one can use only one optimal dilution of the sera together with the reference serum. Sera of 53 healthy volunteers and 77 patients with a history of Streptococcus group A infections were screened for the presence of polysaccharide A antibodies. Highly reproducible results were obtained in 97% of cases. The specificity of the method was shown with the polysaccharide A-induced inhibition of the reaction. Positive reactions obtained with the tested sera in gel immunodiffusion correlated with the data derived by the ELISA. Using the latter high level of specific antibodies was found in some of the sera that yielded negative reactions when tested by gel immunodiffusion. This may be associated with the presence of non-precipitating antibodies.
CD010502,0,3884656,0,Evaluation of a rapid method for the detection of streptococcal group A antigen directly from throat swabs.,"Throat swabs from 196 pediatric patients were processed by a direct extraction-latex agglutination method (Group A Strep Direct Antigen Identification Test [DAI]) that detects group A streptococci in the specimen. The method requires a 45-min enzymatic extraction period at 37 degrees C and a 4-min reaction period with antibody-linked latex particles. The results were compared with those of the culture and fluorescent antibody methods and the clinical presentation of the patient for pharyngitis. Ninety-three percent of the specimens resulted in agreement by all tests, and 28% were culture positive for group A streptococci. Compared with the culture method, the DAI had a sensitivity and a specificity of 83% and 99%, respectively. The positive predictive values were 98% versus the culture method and 93% versus the fluorescent antibody method, whereas the negative predictive values were 94% versus both other methods. Of the 14 discrepant results when both clinical presentation of an acute pharyngitis and the test results were compared, the culture method provided the best correlation. An additional 64 specimens were processed by the DAI and another direct extraction-latex agglutination method (Culturette Ten-Minute Group A Strep ID Test), and the results were compared with those of the culture method. This group had a 40.6% culture isolation rate for group A streptococci. The sensitivity and specificity of the DAI and Strep ID methods versus the culture method were 81 and 100%, and 77 and 97%, respectively. These results indicate that the DAI is accurate for diagnosing group A streptococcal pharyngitis directly from throat swabs. However, negative results in the presence of a symptomatic patient must be confirmed by standard culture techniques."

Twenty-four patients were considered to have an acute myocarditis, 14 had a suspected myocarditis, while in 19 patients myocarditis was excluded. Episodes of frequent supraventricular and/or ventricular extrasystoles during hospital stay were seen in 8/24 cases (33%) with myocarditis and in 1/19 cases (5%) without myocarditis. On follow-up 1 month later, no supraventricular extrasystoles were observed in either group.

CD010502,0,11782509,0,Immunological response mounted by Aboriginal Australians living in the Northern Territory of Australia against Streptococcus pyogenes serum opacity factor.,"Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A streptococcus) interacts with host fibronectin via a number of distinct surface components. The streptococcal serum opacity factor (SOF) is a cell-surface protein of S. pyogenes which causes opalescence of human serum and mediates bacterial binding to fibronectin. In this study, hexahistidyl-tagged fusion proteins encompassing full-length SOF, and domains of SOF encompassing opacity factor activity and fibronectin-binding regions, were used in the characterization of the Aboriginal immune response to SOF. Anti-SOF serum IgG responses were found to be significantly higher (P<0.0001) in Aboriginal adults and children when compared to a non-Aboriginal adult group. The Aboriginal immune response against the fibronectin-binding region of SOF was significantly reduced when compared to the response against the whole SOF protein and N-terminal domains examined in this study (P<0.001). This pattern of immune response was also observed in rabbits immunized with recombinant SOF. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of SOF from a number of common Australian isolates with other SOF sequences revealed that the N-terminus of SOF exhibits sequence similarity values ranging from 42.9% to 96.5%. The C-terminus containing the fibronectin-binding domain and membrane-spanning regions was more highly conserved, exhibiting sequence similarity values ranging from 84.6% to 100% within the fibronectin-binding repeats. These data suggest that the immune response against SOF is directed toward the variable N-terminus of the SOF protein. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the sof genes of S. pyogenes do not exhibit geographical variation."
CD010502,0,19239491,0,Association of Mycoplasma pneumoniae and asthma among Indian children.,"The role of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection as a trigger for asthma exacerbations is well supported in previous studies. This study was designed to investigate the role of M. pneumoniae infection in acute exacerbation of asthma in children. A total of 150 patients (110 males, 40 females) were studied and immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies to M. pneumoniae were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and PCR amplification was performed for the P1 gene to associate M. pneumoniae infection with asthma. As compared with 33 children with asthma, only two of the control subjects had positive IgM titers for M. pneumoniae, which was statistically significant (P=0.002). A total of 15 children with asthma were positive by PCR for the P1 gene while none of the controls had a positive PCR. Of these positive cases, 24 cases were positive only by ELISA, six were positive only by PCR and nine patients were found to be positive by both ELISA and PCR. All the clinical characteristics of the patients at baseline were comparable between the moderate and the severe group of patients statistically, except for the peak expiratory flow rate. Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection was found to have a significant association with acute exacerbation in the moderate group of asthma patients by PCR (P=0.01). These data suggest that M. pneumoniae infection may contribute to asthma exacerbation."
CD010502,0,3251614,0,Asymptomatic poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis in relatives of patients with symptomatic glomerulonephritis. Diagnostic value of endostreptosin antibodies.,"Our previous studies have shown that endostreptosin (ESS), a cytoplasmic protein of group A streptococci, in all probability is the causative agent of poststreptococcal acute glomerulonephritis (PSAGN). Elevated antibody levels to ESS have been shown to be diagnostic for PSAGN and to correlate well with the course of the pathologic disease process. One hundred and twenty-one completely asymptomatic family members of 29 index patients with overt PSAGN were studied. Of these 121 asymptomatic family members, 26 (21.5%) had two or more abnormalities warranting a diagnosis of asymptomatic glomerulonephritis (GN): proteinuria/hematuria (18), low C3 (10 less than 85 mg/dl), high antibody titers to streptolysin O (15). Twenty-three (88.5%) of these family members with evidence of asymptomatic GN had a significant elevation of ESS antibody titers. The mean arithmetic titer for the complement fixation test was 1:24 (normal less than 1:7.5) and the mean ELISA value 0.154 (normal less than 0.075). With a certain percentage of PSAGN cases, especially adults, progressing to chronicity, the ESS antibody determinations by complement fixation and/or ELISA may be simple methods to detect and to follow-up such asymptomatic patients at risk. The high incidence of asymptomatic PSAGN (26/121) in family members of patients with overt PSAGN makes these data very significant in respect to the question of the origin of chronic glomerulonephritis without a history of overt PSAGN. Since chronic PSAGN is probably a sequel of an undiagnosed, asymptomatic disease, it may contribute materially to the contingent of end-stage renal disease."
CD010502,0,20045502,0,Structure-activity relationship of lipopeptide Group A streptococcus (GAS) vaccine candidates on toll-like receptor 2.,"Incorporation of lipoamino acids (LAAs) into peptide structures effectively imparts self-adjuvanting activity onto otherwise ineffective immunogens. Our fully synthetic lipopeptide vaccine candidates against group A streptococcus (GAS) were composed of J14 as a target GAS B-cell epitope alongside a universal helper T-cell epitope (P25) and a LAA-based lipid moiety. In the current study, we investigated the ability of our lipopeptides to activate nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) in a toll-like receptor-2 (TLR2)-dependent manner as the possible mode of action and reported the structure-function requirements for novel TLR2 targeting lipopeptides based on LAAs. The NF-kappaB activation was dependent on the dose and the length of the alkyl chains of the incorporated lipid moieties with the hierarchy LAA 3 (16 carbons)>LAA 2 (14 carbons)>LAA 1 (12 carbons). The position of the lipid moiety (C-terminus vs. N(epsilon)-terminus of the central lysine residue) does not significantly affect NF-kappaB activation. Lipopeptides containing different copies of LAA 3 were synthesized and the di-lipidated analogue was the most effective in NFkappaB activation."
CD010502,0,8345202,0,Recombinant tetravalent group A streptococcal M protein vaccine.,"Previous studies have shown that the amino-terminal regions of group A streptococcal M proteins contain primarily protective (opsonic) epitopes and not tissue-cross-reactive epitopes. Limited primary structures from multiple serotypes of M protein containing only protective epitopes could potentially be linked together to form a broadly protective vaccine. The present studies were undertaken to determine the protective immunogenicity of a recombinant, multivalent hybrid molecule containing amino-terminal subunits of types 24, 5, 6, and 19 M proteins. Polymerase chain reaction primers were designed to amplify emm gene fragments ranging from 35 to 113 codons. The PCR products were ligated in tandem and inserted into pKK223-3. The tetravalent M protein that was purified from extracts of Escherichia coli migrated as a single band on SDS-PAGE with an apparent m.w. of 31 kDa. In immunoblot analyses, the hybrid protein reacted with serotype-specific antisera indicating that it contained all four M protein subunits. Rabbits immunized with the purified tetravalent M protein developed significant antibody levels against all four serotypes of native M proteins represented in the hybrid protein. None of the antisera cross-reacted with human tissues. The immune sera also opsonized all four serotypes of group A streptococci. Our data show that a hybrid protein containing subunits from multiple M proteins can evoke broadly protective immune responses without tissue-cross-reactive antibodies."

Although prophylactic measures have contributed to a substantial reduction in the number of infections, development of a vaccine remains an important goal. While much work in this field has focused on the S. agalactiae polysaccharide capsule, which is an important virulence factor that elicits protective immunity, surface proteins have received increasing attention as potential virulence factors and vaccine components. Here, we summarize current knowledge about S. agalactiae surface proteins, with emphasis on proteins that have been characterized immunochemically and/or elicit protective immunity in animal models. These surface proteins have been implicated in interactions with human epithelial cells, binding to extracellular matrix components, and/or evasion of host immunity. Of note, several S. agalactiae surface proteins are related to surface proteins identified in other bacterial pathogens, emphasizing the general interest of the S. agalactiae proteins. Because some S. agalactiae surface proteins elicit protective immunity, they hold promise as components in a vaccine based only on proteins or as carriers in polysaccharide conjugate vaccines."

Under culture conditions without any stimulus, a certain amount of interferon (IFN)-gamma, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and interleukin (IL)-6, was detected in the supernatant culture fluids from all 29 donors tested and just detectable levels of IL-1alpha and IL-2 were identified in 5 of 12 donors tested; but IL-4 and IL-5 were not detected in any supernatants from 21 donors tested. In 16 patients with pustulosis palmaris et plantaris (PPP), all three alpha-streptococcal antigens from Streptococcus, (S.) sanguis, S. salivarius and S. mitis induced production of IL-6. IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha by tonsillar mononuclear cells at a significant level. However, no significant induction of such cytokines by alpha-streptococcal stimulus was seen in 13 donors without PPP. No significant difference in cytokine production by tonsillar mononuclear cells was seen between the PPP and non-PPP subjects, when stimulated with S. pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus Cowan I and pokeweed mitogen. In the experiments using tonsillar cell subsets, the cytokine inductions by alpha-streptococcal stimulus were found in monocyte-depleted cells as well as in purified T-cells. but not in B-cells. These data suggest that IL-6, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha may play an important role in immunological reactions in the tonsils and that a hyper-immune response to some of alpha-streptococcal antigens through increased production of such cytokines by tonsillar mononuclear cells, to which T-cells mainly contribute, may play a key role in the pathogenesis of PPP."

The sensitivity of the kit in the laboratory was 80% for all specimens and 94% for specimens with more than 10 colony-forming units of group A streptococci; the specificity was 99%. After initial training, emergency department pediatricians and nurses achieved sensitivities of 72% and 69% respectively. The specificity achieved by the pediatricians was 76% initially but 96% after further training. Untrained residents achieved a sensitivity of 58%.

Nasopharyngeal swabs for real-time polymerase chain reaction for 7 types of influenza virus, rhinovirus, respiratory synctial virus, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus, coronavirus, and enterovirus were obtained. Diagnoses of viral infections were established according to positive results in real-time polymerase chain reaction and influenza rapid diagnostic testing, and based on a fourfold increase in antibody titer of influenza virus antibody in paired sera. Overall, a pathogen was identified in 74 patients (59.8%). Of these pathogens, 47 (37.6%) were bacterial, 17 (13.6%) were viral, and 10 (8.0%) were mixed virus and bacterial infection. Influenza virus (n = 12; 9.6%), rhinovirus (n = 8; 6.4%), respiratory syncytial virus (n = 8; 6.4%), and parainfluenza virus (n = 6; 4.8%) were detected. Adenovirus, coronavirus or enterovirus was not detected. Sore throat was more frequently found in patients with viral pneumonia than in those with non-viral pneumonia. Higher age and pneumococcal pneumonia were factors which contributed to severity in the present cases. It is difficult to distinguish viral pneumonia from non-viral pneumonia by clinical findings, and there were few clinically meaningful differences in presentation and severity, and no differences in severity or outcomes according to either the presence or absence of viral infection. Further studies are needed to clarify the possible significance of viral infection in CAP."

Both reported sore throat and dysphagea. In case 1, throat examination showed a bulging abscess at the posterior wall of the pharynx. X-ray examination of the neck showed a massive soft tissue swelling on the lateral view. As soon as the diagnosis was established, prompt focal aspiration was done since the increasing danger of grave respiratory distress was expected. And moreover, surgical incision and drainage of retropharyngeal abscess were indicated. In case 2, intraoral midline incision through the posterior wall of the pharynx was administered because the abscess was small and limited. Though various tuberculous statics and antibiotics are available, tuberculous retropharyngeal abscess still occurs and should be considered to ensure rapid adequate attention to diagnosis and treatment."
CD010502,0,15490293,0,Identification and immunoreactivity of proteins released from Streptococcus agalactiae.,"The aim of the present study was to identify released proteins of Streptococcus agalactiae and to investigate their immunoreactivity with human sera to determine whether such proteins might be viable as carrier proteins in conjugate vaccines. Infections with S. agalactiae are the leading cause of sepsis and meningitis in neonates. Vaccination of women of childbearing age would be a desirable alternative to intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis, but factors that mediate S. agalactiae invasive disease and virulence are poorly defined. Capsule-based vaccines have shown only low immunogenicity to date, and interest has shifted towards S. agalactiae proteins, either as candidate vaccine antigens or as carrier proteins for serotype-specific S. agalactiae polysaccharides. In this study, some major released proteins of S. agalactiae could be identified, including molecules known to be present on the surface of bacterial cells but not previously described as released proteins, such as CAMP factor, a phosphocarrier protein, aldolase, enolase, PcsB, and heat-shock protein 70. Serotype-specific differences in the protein patterns of extracellular products and immunoreactivity with human sera could be detected by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. The identification of unexpected released proteins may indicate secondary functions for these proteins. In addition, the widespread immunoreactivity of these proteins with human sera as shown by Western blot indicates that released proteins may be promising candidates as carrier proteins in conjugate vaccines."

All streptococcal strains possessing the group A antigen were correctly identified with 31 different lots of reagents in the 18 antigen detection systems. The specificities of the 31 different lots of reagents ranged between 88.5 and 100%. A limited number of nonspecific reactions were observed with Enterococcus gallinarium, group C Streptococcus strain C23, and Staphylococcus aureus F49 and Cowan 1. The antigen detection kits that used enzymes as the extraction reagent gave slightly more specific results than did the kits that used chemical extraction reagents. The reagents in the five kits designed to detect the enzyme pyroglutamic acid arylamidase in Streptococcus pyogenes reacted positively with S. pyogenes (group A streptococcus); however, the reagents also reacted positively with all group D enterococcal streptococci and with about half of the staphylococcal strains treated. The nonspecificity of tests based on pyroglutamic acid arylamidase detection would seem to limit the usefulness of these kits with mixed cultures."

Pht proteins function as protective antigens against S. pneumoniae infection. A search of the GAS genome database identified a novel protein, HtpA, possessing five histidine triad motifs. The htpA gene was shown to encode a 92.5-kDa protein located downstream of the fbaA and lbp genes, while Western blot analyses revealed that HtpA protein was expressed on the cell surfaces of all group A, B, C, and G streptococcal isolates tested. Immunization of mice with rHtpA induced antigen-specific antibody production and was effective after a single immunization, with antibody titers remaining constant for at least 84days. In addition, HtpA-immunized mice survived after challenge with GAS strains isolated from patients with streptococcal toxic shock syndrome for significantly longer periods than sham-immunized mice. In that experiment, the HtpA-specific antibody was effectively induced by a single immunization and the specific antibody titer remained constant for at least 84days. These results indicate that the novel histidine triad protein HtpA is a candidate vaccine for GAS infection."

The interactions between the microorganisms and the host are very dynamic, thus allowing the complex interplay between host molecules and bacterial antigens. In this article, we focus on the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of and host responses to two oral pathogens: the Gram-negative bacterium Porphyromonas gingivalis, implicated in the etiology of periodontal disease, and the Gram-positive Streptococcus mutans, a primary agent involved in dental caries formation. Furthermore, we address mechanisms involved in the ability of select adjuvants and delivery systems to potentiate mucosal and systemic immune responses to microbial vaccine antigens."

We have examined the presence of EBV in palatine tonsils and relationship between EBV-DNA quantity in tonsil tissues and VCA-IgG quantity in autologous sera. Tonsils were obtained from 36 patients, male 20 (55.6%), female 16 (44.4%) (mean age 7.96 ± 6.97 years), who underwent tonsils removal because of recurrent tonsillitis. Tissues were processed for real-time PCR and patient's sera were assayed to determine VCA-IgG by VCA-IgG ELISA. In 27 out of 36 cases (75%), positive EBV-DNA reaction was found. However, statistical analysis showed no correlation between EBV-DNA quantity and VCA-IgG quantity. We conclude that tonsils of children can be colonized by EBV and that virus may have a direct and indirect role in recurrent tonsillitis and nasopharyngeal carcinoma."

Relevance of species identification.,"Over a 4-year-period, 104 isolates belonging to the viridans streptococci were recovered from the blood and identified to the species according to Beighton and co-workers. Streptococcus oralis was the species most frequently recovered from patients in the hematology unit [29 of 39 (74%)]. Streptococcus mitis ranked second [seven of 39 (18%)]. Both species were associated with oromucositis. Isolates presently identified as S. oralis are mainly those previously identified as S. mitis or Streptococcus sanguis II. Streptococcus milleri was most frequently isolated in the patients from the general hospital population [28 of 65 (43%) isolates]: Streptococcus anginosus (n = 20), Streptococcus constellatus (n = 4), and Streptococcus intermedius (n = 4). In 14 episodes from the general hospital population, clinical significance was judged questionable. From this part of the laboratory, clinical significance could not be predicted from the number of blood cultures grown, nor from the delay of growth detection. The Rapid ID 32 Strep system agreed well with the identifications according to the scheme of Beighton et al., whereas the API 20 Strep system did not."

Swab specimens are often transported to a clinical laboratory for processing. In these studies, specimen transport was simulated by inoculating swabs with GBS and storing them at selected temperatures and with or without transport medium. The recovery of viable GBS was assessed by agar culture. GBS antigen was detected immunologically with an Optical ImmunoAssay (OIA) method. Swabs that were stored with transport medium harbored viable but rapidly declining numbers of GBS. In contrast, a strong OIA signal was maintained. Recovery of viable GBS organisms declined more quickly when swabs were stored in the absence of transport medium, whereas detection of GBS antigen remained consistent. Both methods were tested for interference from either antibiotics or feminine hygiene products. These compounds inhibited the detection of GBS by culture but had no detrimental effect on the OIA result."
CD010502,0,15715517,0,Massive soft tissue infections: necrotizing fasciitis and purpura fulminans.,"Necrotizing fasciitis and purpura fulminans are two destructive infections that involve both skin and soft tissue. Necrotizing fasciitis is characterized by widespread necrosis of subcutaneous tissue and the fascia. Historically, group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus has been identified as a major cause of this infection. However, this monomicrobial infection is usually associated with some underlying cause, such as diabetes mellitus. During the last two decades, scientists have found that the pathogenesis of necrotizing fasciitis is polymicrobial. The diagnosis of necrotizing fasciitis must be made as soon as possible by examining the skin inflammatory changes. Magnetic resonance imaging is strongly recommended to detect the presence of air within the tissues. Percutaneous aspiration of the soft tissue infection followed by prompt Gram staining should be conducted with the ""finger-test"" and rapid-frozen section biopsy examination. Intravenous antibiotic therapy is one of the cornerstones of managing this life-threatening skin infection. Surgery is the primary treatment for necrotizing fasciitis, with early surgical fasciotomy and debridement. Following debridement, skin coverage by either Integra Dermal Regeneration Template or AlloDerm should be undertaken. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy complemented by intravenous polyspecific immunoglobulin are useful adjunctive therapies. Purpura fulminans is a rare syndrome of intravascular thrombosis and hemorrhagic infarction of the skin; it is rapidly progressive and accompanied by vascular collapse. There are three types of purpura fulminans: neonatal purpura fulminans, idiopathic or chronic purpura fulminans, and acute infectious purpura fulminans. Clinical presentation of purpura fulminans involves a premonitory illness followed by the rapid development of a septic syndrome with fever, shock, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. The diagnosis and treatment of these conditions is best accomplished in a regional burn center in which management of multiple organ failure can be conducted with aggressive debridement and fasciotomy of the necrotic skin. The newest revolutionary advancement in the treatment of neonatal purpura fulminans is the use of activated protein C."

CD010502,0,16929299,0,Signal sequence directs localized secretion of bacterial surface proteins.,"All living cells require specific mechanisms that target proteins to the cell surface. In eukaryotes, the first part of this process involves recognition in the endoplasmic reticulum of amino-terminal signal sequences and translocation through Sec translocons, whereas subsequent targeting to different surface locations is promoted by internal sorting signals. In bacteria, N-terminal signal sequences promote translocation across the cytoplasmic membrane, which surrounds the entire cell, but some proteins are nevertheless secreted in one part of the cell by poorly understood mechanisms. Here we analyse localized secretion in the Gram-positive pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes, and show that the signal sequences of two surface proteins, M protein and protein F (PrtF), direct secretion to different subcellular regions. The signal sequence of M protein promotes secretion at the division septum, whereas that of PrtF preferentially promotes secretion at the old pole. Our work therefore shows that a signal sequence may contain information that directs the secretion of a protein to one subcellular region, in addition to its classical role in promoting secretion. This finding identifies a new level of complexity in protein translocation and emphasizes the potential of bacterial systems for the analysis of fundamental cell-biological problems."

We conducted active, laboratory, population-based surveillance in 5 US states (total population, 13,214,992). From 1 July 1995 through 31 December 1999, we identified 2002 episodes of invasive GAS (3.5 cases per 100,000 persons).

CD010502,0,3601520,1,Febrile exudative tonsillitis: viral or streptococcal?,"A prospective 1-year study of acute febrile exudative tonsillitis in 110 children was carried out. Viral infection was associated with 42% of the cases, beta-hemolytic streptococci with 31% (12% group A), Mycoplasma pneumoniae with 5%, and unknown cause with 35%. More than one agent was implicated in 14% of the cases. Adenovirus was the viral agent most frequently (19%) recorded. Other viruses involved were Epstein-Barr virus, parainfluenza, influenza A, herpes simplex, and respiratory syncytial viruses. The responsible agent was found by rapid viral antigen detection in 20% of all cases and by rapid test for group A streptococcal antigen detection in 10%. Age was the most important factor in predicting the causative agent. Viral tonsillitis was most common in children younger than 3 years of age and group A beta-hemolytic streptococci tonsillitis in children 6 years of age or more. Clinical analysis of the illness, WBC count, and ESR did not reveal differences that could help in differentiating bacterial from viral tonsillitis. All patients were treated with a regimen of oral penicillin. Fever associated with group A beta-hemolytic streptococci tonsillitis responded to penicillin therapy significantly more rapidly than fever associated with viral infections. These observations demonstrate the prominent role of viruses in the etiology of febrile exudative tonsillitis, especially in young children, and reinforce the benefit of rapid tests before antibiotic therapy is started."
CD010502,0,22384827,0,The nature of innate and adaptive interleukin-17A responses in sham or bacterial inoculation.,"Streptococcus pyogenes is the causative agent of numerous diseases ranging from benign infections (pharyngitis and impetigo) to severe infections associated with high mortality (necrotizing fasciitis and bacterial sepsis). As with other bacterial infections, there is considerable interest in characterizing the contribution of interleukin-17A (IL-17A) responses to protective immunity. We here show significant il17a up-regulation by quantitative real-time PCR in secondary lymphoid organs, correlating with increased protein levels in the serum within a short time of S. pyogenes infection. However, our data offer an important caveat to studies of IL-17A responsiveness following antigen inoculation, because enhanced levels of IL-17A were also detected in the serum of sham-infected mice, indicating that inoculation trauma alone can stimulate the production of this cytokine. This highlights the potency and speed of innate IL-17A immune responses after inoculation and the importance of proper and appropriate controls in comparative analysis of immune responses observed during microbial infection."

CD010502,0,12600750,0,Naturally occurring immune response against bacteria commonly involved in upper respiratory tract infections: analysis of the antigen-specific salivary IgA levels.,"Lyophilized bacterial lysates, which actively stimulate the immune response, are widely used as vaccines or 'biological response modifiers' in subjects with recurrent bacterial respiratory infections. Since vaccines are indicated in the absence or in the presence of a weak constitutive immune response activity, a better knowledge on the 'naturally' occurring antibacterial immune response at the oropharingeal level should be helpful. A study was, therefore, designed to quantify the presence of salivary IgA directed against surface antigens bacteria frequently involved in the pathogenesis of upper respiratory tract infections: Klebsiella pneumoniae (KP), Staphylococcus aureus (SA), Streptococcus pyogenes (SPy), Morraxella catarrhalis (MC), Haemophylus influenzae (HI), and Streptococcus pnumoniae (SPn). In 34 volunteers (21 adults and 13 children), salivary fluid was collected and the presence of microorganism-specific IgA antibodies evaluated by a novel enzyme immuno-assay. In the whole population only 29 and 24% of subjects had IgA directed, respectively, to KP and SA, while the immune-response against other microbes was detectable in a small population ranging from 12 to 15% of all subjects studied. We found higher proportions of individuals with strain specific salivary IgA in the adult than in the pediatric population for all the microorganism evaluated. In addition, in children, the only strain inducing a significant production of specific IgA at oropharingeal level was KP. Interestingly, only ten out of 21 adults and two out 13 children have at least one significantly high antibody titer against one of the bacteria evaluated. Nevertheless, when a group of healthy donors was treated with a polyvalent mechanical bacterial lysate (Ismigen t.), the large majority developed a specific immune-response in the salivary fluid. These results are thus consistent with the good features of the novel enzyme-immunoassay and with a poor frequency of naturally induced specific anti-microbe antibodies in children and in adults despite the presence on recurrent respiratory infections in their clinical history."

Widespread lymphadenopathy and blood smears indistinguishable from those typically encountered in the acute phase of infectious mononucleosis were present in all cases. There were also varying combinations of fever, sore throat, and malaise, as well as mild abnormalities of hepatic function and elevated cold agglutinins (anti-I). Anti-HIV was detected by both enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot techniques in all cases, with increasing titers noted in two of three serially studied cases. In one patient, a dual infection with the hepatitis B virus was also documented. Diagnostic possibilities in patients with acute mononucleosis-like illnesses dominated by prominent lymphadenopathy should include primary seroconversions to HIV."
CD010502,0,1383324,0,Conserved T and B cell epitopes on the M protein of group A streptococci. Induction of bactericidal antibodies.,"To identify conserved T and B cell epitopes on the M protein of group A beta-hemolytic streptococci, overlapping synthetic peptides that span the conserved carboxyl-terminal segment of the M-5 protein were constructed and used to immunize a panel of H-2 congenic mice. Proliferative T cell epitopes were identified and, in many cases, mice immunized with these peptides produced high titer antibodies to the same peptides indicating that these proliferative epitopes could also stimulate Th cells. Peptide-specific T cells and antisera were tested for their reactivity with porcine myosin, tropomyosin, human heart myosin synthetic peptides, and extracts of human pericardial and atrial heart tissue. Although there was minimal response of M peptide-specific T cells to any of these Ag, certain M peptide-specific antisera reacted to immunoblotted porcine myosin and to an immunoblotted extract of human atrial heart tissue. However, two conserved peptides, LRRDLDASREAKKQVEKALE and KLTEKEKAELQAKLEAEAKA, stimulated peptide-specific antibodies in B10.BR and B10.D2 mice respectively, which reacted minimally if at all with human atrial heart tissue extract. Furthermore, antisera to the former peptide, in a bactericidal assay involving human monocytes, could mediate killing of streptococci (82% of bacteria). Although this level of killing is less than that produced by antisera to the highly polymorphic type-specific aminoterminus (up to 100% killing), it provides evidence that conserved epitopes can be the targets of bactericidal antibodies. These conserved epitopes may be useful in a vaccine because they also stimulate T cells, thus allowing development of immunologic memory and natural boosting of an immune response after natural exposure."

Since no data were available from Iran, we tested 1,335 throat isolates from two different regions of the country for their antibiotic susceptibilities and, for comparison, a collection of 80 strains isolated from 1989 to 1991. Erythromycin resistance was uncommon (0.6%), whereas an overall high rate of tetracycline resistance was found, increasing between 1989-1991 and 1995-1997 from 23 to 42%. The tetracycline-resistant strains belonged to more than 10 different T types, the majority being types 4, 11, and B3264. By conventional M typing of 406 tetracycline-resistant isolates, more than 20 different M types were found. Approximately 50% of the strains were nontypeable by T agglutination as well as serological M typing; however, by genotyping by a combined PCR-capture-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, many of these strains were successfully emm typed. We conclude that the high rate of tetracycline resistance among Iranian S. pyogenes isolates is due to multiclonal dissemination of resistance within the streptococcal population rather than epidemic spread of single clones."

Attempts to identify disease specific anti-striatal antibodies in the serum of affected patients have focused on the use of Western immunoblotting and ELISA methodologies. In this study, immunohistochemical techniques were used to identify serum anti-striatal antibody reactivity. In positive samples, double staining with anti-GFAP (glial) and anti-MAP2 (neuronal) was used to establish localization of the immunofluorescence. No significant differences in immunofluorescence or localization were identified in patients with PANDAS (n=30) and TS (n=30) as compared to controls (n=30). IF reactivity did not correlate with tic severity or elevated titers of antistreptococcal antibodies. Further comparisons showed no correlation between autoreactivity determined by immunofluorescence and the presence of previously measured immunoblot reactivity against human caudate or putative antigens (pyruvate kinase M1 and aldolase C). These results confirm an inability to distinguish patient populations by antibody measurements and raise further concerns about the presence of an autoimmune mechanism in PANDAS and TS."
CD010502,0,8613367,0,Defining antibody targets in Streptococcus oralis infection.,"Immunoblotting of sera from 12 neutropenic patients with Streptococcus oralis septicemia and 18 patients with endocarditis due to viridans group streptococci revealed immunodominant S. oralis antigens at 85 and 180 kDa. The former cross-reacted with a mouse monoclonal antibody to hsp90. The latter was identified by sequencing positive clones obtained by screening a genomic expression library of S. oralis with pooled sera from patients who had been infected with S. oralis. Antibody eluted from one of these clones reacted with the 180-kDa antigen of S. oralis. Southern blotting confirmed the origin of the clone from S. oralis. The derived amino acid sequence showed 76.2% homology with the PAc protein precursor of Streptococcus mutans and 73.8% homology with the SpaA protein precursor of Streptococcus sobrinus. Epitope mapping of the derived amino acid sequence with sera from patients with viridans group streptococcal endocarditis delineated nine epitopes. Peptides 1 (TMYPNRQPGSGWDSS) and 2 (WYSLNGKIRAVDVPK), representing two of these epitopes, and peptide 3 (YEVEKPLEPAPVAPS), representing the repeat proline region, were synthesized. These three peptides were used to screen a phage antibody display library derived from a patient who had recovered from S. oralis infection. Two of the human recombinant antibodies produced (SORAL 3 and SORAL 4 against peptide 3) and a human recombinant antibody (B3.7) against the conserved epitope (LKVIRK) of hsp90 gave statistically significant protection, compared with control groups, in a mouse model of lethal S. oralis infection."

A retrospective chart review at the University of South Alabama Family Practice Center was undertaken to assess changes in physician prescribing and testing patterns since the advent of rapid testing of streptococcal pharyngitis (rapid strep tests [RST]). Charts for study were identified by encounter form coding of a diagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis or pharyngitis not otherwise specified. Control and test groups were formed based on the availability of the RST, and a stratified sample was drawn from each group. In the group of patients studied after the RST became available, data analysis showed a significantly increased likelihood that patients received antibiotics with a positive RST (odds ratio [OR] = 6.42), whereas those patients with a negative or no RST were significantly less likely to receive antibiotics (OR = 2.50 and 2.48, respectively). Group assignment was a significant predictor of test-ordering behavior (P less than 0.05). A higher than expected rate of streptococcal pharyngitis was noted in the group of patients who had the RST available to them. The RST plays an important though not fully defined role in the current management of pharyngitis."
CD010502,0,8167552,0,Human B cell interleukin 10.,"Interleukin 10 (IL-10) is a novel lymphokine which exhibits strong DNA and amino acid sequence homology to BCRF1, an open reading frame in the Epstein-Barr virus genome. Using a wide panel of EBV positive and EBV negative cell lines, it has been shown that EBV positive B cell lines derived from patients with AIDS and Burkitt's lymphoma (AABCL) secrete large quantities of B cell IL-10, compared with EBV-positive B cell lines obtained from patients with undifferentiated lymphomas of Burkitt's and non-Burkitt's types. In contrast, EBV-negative B cell lines do not express IL-10 by Northern blot analysis, ELISA or even PCR. B cell IL-10 is confined to a narrow window in the B cell differentiation pathway, and whereas IL-10 expression is detected in mature and preplasmacytic stages, none of the pro-B, pre-B, or myeloma cell lines produce IL-10. EBV exerts direct effect on the production of B cell IL-10, and purified tonsillar B cells infected with EBV were triggered to secrete IL-10. The large amount of IL-10 secreted by B cells derived from AIDS-related lymphomas suggests that HIV-1 also exerts direct effect on IL-10 secretion. B cell IL-10 may function as autocrine growth factor for B cell lymphomas, and both IL-10 and BCRF1 seem to be involved in the pathophysiology of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas."
CD010502,0,15271946,0,Proapoptotic effect of proteolytic activation of matrix metalloproteinases by Streptococcus pyogenes thiol proteinase (Streptococcus pyrogenic exotoxin B).,"Streptococcus pyogenes thiol proteinase, also known as streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin B (SpeB), has been suggested to be a major virulence factor in S. pyogenes infection. SpeB was reported to induce apoptosis of host cells, but its mechanism of action is not yet fully understood. In this study, we examined the involvement of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in SpeB-induced apoptosis. We first developed a large-scale preparation of recombinant SpeB and precursors of human MMP-9 and -2 (proMMPs) by using Escherichia coli Rosetta (DE3)pLysS and baculovirus-insect cell expression systems, respectively. Treatment with SpeB induced effective proteolytic activation of both proMMP-9 and -2. When RAW264 murine macrophages were incubated with SpeB-activated proMMP-9, the level of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) in conditioned medium (CM), assessed by an enzyme immunoassay, was elevated. This increase was completely inhibited by addition of the MMP inhibitor SI-27 to the cell culture. The CM also produced marked induction of apoptosis of U937 human monocytic cells. Similarly, soluble Fas ligand (sFasL) was detected in CM of cultures of SW480 cells expressing FasL after treatment with SpeB-activated proMMPs; this CM also induced apoptosis in U937 cells. SpeB had a direct effect as well and caused the release of TNF-alpha and sFasL from the cells. SpeB-dependent production of MMP-9 and -2 and proapoptotic molecules (TNF-alpha and sFasL) was evident in a murine model of severe invasive S. pyogenes infection. These results suggest that SpeB or SpeB-activated MMPs contribute to tissue damage and streptococcal invasion in the host via extracellular release of TNF-alpha and sFasL."

To try to separate toxic from immunological reactions minute amounts of peptidoglycan in four different preparations were applied to humans by intracutaneous injections. Peptidoglycan, an immunologically well defined wall components of almost all bacteria and which is therefore ubiquitous, was isolated from staphylococci and streptococci. The skin reactions were evaluated by macroscopical, microscopical and immunohistological observations, as well as by electromicroscopy and statistical means. Several findings indicate the involvement of immunological factors in the observed skin reactions. In some cases no measurable reaction was seen, whereas in others typical skin reactions occurred. Similar reactions were produced by the antigenically related peptidoglycans isolated from Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermis. These reactions differed, however, from those elicited by peptidoglycan preparations from Streptococcus pyogenes type A. Patients with chronic bacterial infections and who were injected by four bacterial preparations demonstrated a significant increase in delayed hypersensitivity reaction compared with two other groups of patients (atopic patients without chronic infection). Because of the very low test dose, necrotic skin reactions, which occur in animal experiments, were not observed."

Starting from the observation that efficacious vaccines are constituted by conserved, surface-associated and/or secreted components, the strategy contemplates the parallel application of three high throughput technologies, i.e. mass spectrometry-based proteomics, protein array, and flow-cytometry analysis, to identify this category of proteins, and is based on the assumption that the antigens identified by all three technologies are the protective ones. When we tested this strategy for Group A Streptococcus, we selected a total of 40 proteins, of which only six identified by all three approaches. When the 40 proteins were tested in a mouse model, only six were found to be protective and five of these belonged to the group of antigens in common to the three technologies. Finally, a combination of three protective antigens conferred broad protection against a panel of four different Group A Streptococcus strains. This approach may find general application as an accelerated and highly accurate path to bacterial vaccine discovery."

Although a number of clinical features have been associated with enhanced severity of disease, the role of soluble immune complex formation in group B streptococcal infection has not been evaluated. We determined the frequency with which circulating immune complexes occurred in 16 infants with nonfatal type III, group B streptococcal meningitis, using an immunoglobulin-specific C1q enzyme immunoassay. Ten healthy, age-matched infants served as a control group. Elevated levels of immunoglobulin M (IgM)-containing immune complexes were present in the sera of four (25%) patients with group B streptococcal meningitis. Group B antigen was detected in precipitated IgM immune complexes from each of these four infants by competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In addition, IgG-containing immune complexes were present in 56% of sick and 60% of control infants. Group B antigen was demonstrated in the serum of a sick neonate containing only IgG immune complexes but not in controls. Our findings indicate that a subset of infants with type III, group B streptococcal meningitis develop IgM immune complexes containing group B-specific antigen, and these may persist for up to 3 months in some patients."

CD010502,0,11731942,0,Extension of the Lancefield classification for group A streptococci by addition of 22 new M protein gene sequence types from clinical isolates: emm103 to emm124.,"Classic M protein serotyping has been invaluable during the past 60 years for the determination of relationships between different group A streptococci (GAS) strains and the varied clinical manifestations inflicted by these organisms worldwide. Nonetheless, during the past 20 years, the difficulties of continued expansion of the serology-based Lancefield classification scheme for GAS have become increasingly apparent. By use of a less demanding sequence-based methodology that closely adheres to previously established strain criteria while being predictive of known M protein serotypes, we recently added types emm94-emm102 to the Lancefield scheme. Continued expansion by the addition of types emm103 to emm124 are now proposed. As with types emm94-emm102, each of these new emm types was represented by multiple independent isolates recovered from serious disease manifestations, each was M protein nontypeable with all typing sera stocks available to international GAS reference laboratories, and each demonstrated antiphagocytic properties in vitro by multiplying in normal human blood."

CD010502,0,18576885,0,Single-chain variable fragment antibodies selected by phage display against the sporozoite surface antigen P23 Of Cryptosporidium parvum.,"Cryptosporidium parvum, an apicomplexan parasite transmitted via animal fecal wastes, is the causative agent of cryptosporidiosis. Clones were selected from 2 synthetic naïve human single-chain variable fragment (scFv) phagemid libraries that bound to the recombinant P23 protein of C. parvum. Panning the Tomlinson I and J phagemid libraries resulted in 6 distinct clones. Two clones had full-length scFv sequences, while the remaining clones were either truncated or missing a section of the heavy chain. Despite these differences, all clones were able to detect both native C. parvum proteins and recombinant P23. None of the selected clones cross-reacted with Escherichia coli, Streptococcus pyogenes, Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus, Giardia lamblia (cysts or trophozoites), or with S16, another dominant surface antigen on C. parvum sporozoites. Clones expressed as the scFv-gIIIp fusion construct in soluble form detected C. parvum. Panning from naïve libraries is a useful method for isolation and identification of recombinant antibodies that have the potential for use in pathogen detection and immunotherapy."

CD010502,0,9008306,0,Significance of antibodies to streptococcal M protein in psoriatic arthritis and their association with HLA-A*0207.,"Psoriatic arthritis (PA) is an immune disease associated with HLA-A2 in the Japanese population. To investigate mechanisms the association between HLA-A2 and PA, we examined in vivo immune responsiveness to Streptococcus pyogenes. Recombinant M proteins for the subtype specific N-terminal half (AB region) and conserved C-terminal half (C region) were produced separately. IgG antibody level against each region was measured by ELISA in 31 PA patients, 88 patients with psoriasis vulgaris, 6 patients with rheumatoid arthritis and 77 healthy controls. We found that IgG antibody levels against the C region were markedly higher in the PA patient group than in the other disease groups or controls. Further, IgG antibody levels were higher in PA patients with spondylitis and polyarticular arthritis than in PA patients with rheumatoid-like arthritis and arthritis mutilans. In contrast, no significant difference in the IgG antibody levels against the AB region was observed among the tested groups. HLA-A2 DNA typing showed that HLA-A*0207 was associated with PA (RR = 17.6; pcorr < 0.01) and the IgG antibody responses to the C region correlated well with the presence of HLA-A*0207. These results suggest that streptococcal infection may be involved in the pathogenesis of PA by participating in the HLA-linked immune responsiveness."

Of the two techniques described, latex agglutination was more sensitive than countercurrent immunoelectrophoresis. Concentrated urine was the best body fluid to test with 100% containing antigen. Though no false-positive reactions were noted, this is a potential problem. Gram-positive cocci in the gastric aspirate were associated with severe systemic infections with these organisms in almost half of the neonates with clinical signs of infection or respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). There was only a 4% infection rate in clinically similar neonates without Gram-positive cocci in the gastric aspirates. Apnea and/or hypotension was seen commonly in both early onset GBS pneumonia and RDS, making this finding alone of little clinical use."
CD010502,0,3513139,0,Rapid latex agglutination compared with the throat culture for the detection of group A streptococcal infection.,"The Culturette Brand rapid latex agglutination test was compared with the throat culture for accuracy in detecting Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci (GABHS) on paired throat swabs from 1047 children with suspected streptococcal pharyngitis. In this comparison the rapid latex agglutination test had a sensitivity of 78%, a specificity of 88%, a positive predictive value of 52% and a negative predictive value of 96%. In 45 study patients from whom it was possible to obtain paired acute and convalescent sera, the latex agglutination test and the throat culture were compared against each other for detection of infection due to GABHS as evidenced by a 4-fold or greater titer rise of serum antistreptococcal antibodies. The latex agglutination test detected and failed to detect the same number of infections as the throat culture. Thus although a significant number of false positive latex agglutination tests occurred when compared to the throat culture, there is limited evidence in this study that the latex agglutination test is equal to the throat culture in detecting patients who have serologically confirmed infection due to GABHS."
CD010502,0,8296654,0,Antineutrophil-cytoplasmic-autoantibodies in poststreptococcal nephritis.,"Sera from 210 patients with APSGN, were tested for the presence of ANCA (IgG-isotype). Indirect immunofluorescence (IF) on ethanol fixed human PMNs was used, and for those positive sera, ELISA kits for PR3 (Proteinase 3) and MPO (Myeloperoxidase) was performed. ANCA were detected in 9% (18 out of 210 cases) in a predominantly diffuse cytoplasmic staining pattern in 14 cases (77%), and in a perinuclear pattern in the remaining 4 cases (22%). Anti-MPO was found in 4 cases (C-ANCA 3; P-ANCA 1) and anti-PR3 was always negative. The presence of ANCA was significantly associated with a more severe glomerular disease as assessed by the serum creatinine value and the crescents formation. Longitudinal studies performed in 11 cases have shown that raised levels of these autoantibodies may persist for at least six months, without relationship with disease activity. Further studies are required to dilucidate the specificity of these autoantibodies, and if its presence is either an epiphenomenon of the heterogeneous humoral immune response in streptococcal infection, or they play some pathogenic role in APSGN."

CD010502,0,3856248,0,Presence of two distinct regions in the coiled-coil structure of the streptococcal Pep M5 protein: relationship to mammalian coiled-coil proteins and implications to its biological properties.,"The complete amino acid sequence of Pep M5, a biologically active 197-residue fragment comprising nearly half of the group A streptococcal M5 protein, has structural features characteristic of an alpha-helical coiled-coil protein. Fourier analyses of the nonpolar residues show strong periodicities based on repeats of 7 residues (7/2 and 7/3). Except for the nonhelical NH2-terminal 12-residue segment, the 7-residue periodicity in the distribution of nonpolar residues extends through the remainder of the Pep M5 molecule, with some discontinuities and irregularities. The molecule contains two distinct regions that differ in the pattern of distribution of the nonpolar and charged residues. The 7-residue pattern ""a, b, c, d, e, f, g"" in region 13-121 is atypical in that position ""a"" is predominantly occupied by asparagine, rather than nonpolar residues. On the other hand, the periodicity in region 122-196 is more typical of that found in other coiled-coil proteins, such as the myosin rod region, keratin, desmin, and vimentin, rather than tropomyosin. Although the periodicity in nonpolar residues is not highly regular, the predominance of basic and acidic residues in the inner ""e"" and ""g"" positions, respectively, suggests that ionic interactions between chains may contribute significantly to the stability of the coiled-coil. The distribution of charged residues in the outer positions within the two regions of the molecule is also distinct. The NH2-terminal region carries a significantly higher net negative charge than the COOH-terminal region, suggesting that the former region may play an important role in some of the biological functions of the Pep M5 molecule."

This assay was based on specific amplification of internal fragments of genes encoding D-alanine:D-alanine ligases which are species specific and ubiquitous in prokaryotes possessing peptidoglycan. The specificity of this assay was tested on 9 reference strains and 91 characterized clinical isolates. This assay offers a specific and rapid alternative to phenotypic or DNA-DNA hybridization methods for identification of clinically relevant viridans group streptococci."
CD010502,0,3105365,0,Role of rapid tests for streptococcal pharyngitis in hospital infection control.,"Rapid streptococcal antigen detection tests are now an alternative to throat cultures for diagnosing group A streptococcal pharyngitis. Used alone, they are not suitable for hospital infection control applications because of the risk that individuals with streptococcal pharyngitis and a falsely negative test will spread the infection within the institution. However, a rapid test may be an economical method for screening employees with pharyngitis, provided that a throat culture is performed for everyone with a negative test. Compared with the use of throat cultures alone, this strategy reduces the number of missed diagnoses and the number of work days lost. Cost-benefit analysis shows that over a wide range of streptococcal prevalence and carrier rate the total cost is also less with the use of rapid tests first. If the prevalence of streptococcal pharyngitis is very low, the use of cultures alone is more cost-effective."

CD010502,0,18034863,0,Characterisation of invasive group B streptococci based on investigation of surface proteins and genes encoding surface proteins.,"The joint distributions of the six genes bca, bac, epsilon/alp1, alp2, alp3 and rib (encoding alpha-C-protein, beta-C-protein, epsilon/Alp1, Alp2, Alp3, and Rib, respectively) and the proteins alpha-C-protein, beta-C-protein and Rib were investigated in invasive isolates of group B streptococcus (GBS). In total, 297 invasive isolates (123 from neonates, 174 from adults) from south-west Sweden were collected during a 13-year period. Genes were detected using multiplex and specific PCRs, and expression of the surface proteins was demonstrated using monoclonal antibodies. The genes studied were found alone or in combinations in 294 (99%) of the invasive isolates. The most common genes were rib (n = 127 isolates, 43%), alp3 (n = 78, 26%) and epsilon/alp1 (n = 42, 14%). The bac gene was never found alone, but was found in combination with one other gene in 36 isolates. The surface proteins studied were detected alone or in combinations in 152 (51%) isolates, with the most common being Rib (n = 80, 27%), alpha-C-protein (n = 68, 23%) and beta-C-protein (n = 24, 8%). Several genes were associated significantly with particular serotypes (e.g., epsilon/alp1 with serotype Ia; bca and bac with serotypes Ib and II; rib with serotype III; alp3 with serotype V). Overall, it was concluded that demonstration of different genes and surface proteins of GBS strains can be useful in epidemiological studies and in formulation of vaccines, but disappointingly, no single gene or surface protein included in the study was sufficiently common for it to be considered as the basis for a successful GBS vaccine."
CD010502,0,12795239,0,"Pharmacokinetics, biologic activity, and tolerability of alefacept by intravenous and intramuscular administration.","Alefacept, human LFA-3/IgG1 fusion protein, is currently under clinical development for the treatment of chronic plaque psoriasis and other T cell mediated disorders. This recombinant protein binds CD2 on T cells and Fc gamma RIII on accessory cells (e.g., natural killer cells, macrophages), inhibiting T cell activation/proliferation and inducing selective T cell apoptosis. These effects are associated with selective reductions in memory-effector (CD4+ CD45RO+ and CD8+ CD45RO+) T cells. Two open-label studies were conducted in healthy male volunteers to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, biologic activity, and tolerability of a single dose of alefacept when administered as a 0.15 mg/kg 30-sec i.v. bolus (n = 12), 0.04 mg/kg intramuscular (i.m.) injection (n = 8), or 0.04 mg/kg 30-min intravenous (i.v.) infusion (n = 8). i.v. infusion produced a higher Cmax (0.96 +/- 0.26 mcg/ml vs. 0.36 +/- 0.19 mcg/ml) and a shorter Tmax (2.8 +/- 1.9 hr vs. 86 +/- 60 hr) when compared to i.m. injection. Based on AUC0-last and AUC0-infenity values, the relative bioavailability of i.m. to i.v. infusion was approximately 60%. After absorption from the i.m. injection was complete, the rate of alefacept elimination from the serum appeared consistent with the i.v. infusion half-life (approximately 12 days). Biologic activity was demonstrated by transient reductions in absolute number of CD2+ lymphocytes, with notable specificity for memory T-cell subsets. Alefacept was well tolerated; the most common adverse effects were headache, pharyngitis, rash, and myalgia. IM administration was not associated with significant local reactions. Results of these studies support i.v. bolus or i.m. administration of alefacept. An i.m. dose of approximately 150 to 200% of the i.v. dose is an appropriate and convenient alternative to i.v. administration."
CD010502,0,2556561,1,Sore throat in family practice: comparison of blood agar throat culture with a rapid enzyme immunoassay test for diagnostic purposes.,"The Ventrescreen (Ventrex) rapid enzyme immunoassay test for detecting group A streptococcal antigen directly from a throat swab was compared with conventional blood agar throat culture in the diagnosis of beta haemolytic streptococcal infection among 311 patients with a sore throat attending a large suburban Jerusalem primary care clinic. Using the throat culture as the 'gold standard' the Ventrescreen test had a sensitivity of 82%, a specificity of 50%, a positive predictive value of 49%, and a negative predictive value of 82% for beta haemolytic streptococcal infection. These results are not good enough for the test to be considered a reliable substitute for throat culture in such a setting. The negative predictive value, however, supports the use of a negative test result to identify those patients in whom antibiotic therapy could be withheld until the result of their throat culture became available. These conclusions are at variance with recommendations from other studies of similar tests in different population groups, and stress the need for the careful evaluation, especially in primary care clinics, of any such rapid test which claims to be able to replace throat culture in the detection of beta haemolytic streptococcal infection."

CD010502,0,6227199,0,Immunohistological study of tonsil. Distribution of T cell subsets.,"Employing a series of monoclonal antibodies directed against T cell subsets and the ABC (avidin-biotin complex) method as the immunoperoxidase technique, we studied the distribution of T cell subsets in frozen tissue sections of tonsils in 8 cases with various tonsillar lesions. Anti-Leu 1 and anti-Leu 4 antibodies, which react with all peripheral T cells, stained a majority of interfollicular cells and mononuclear cells in the lymphoepithelial symbiosis (LES). Approximately 80% of Leu 1+ and Leu 4+ cells were reactive with anti-Leu 3a antibody, which defines the helper/inducer T cell subset. Small lymphocytes in the mantle zone of the tonsillar follicle had IgD and IgM on their surface, whereas the cells in the germinal center showed membrane and/or cytoplasmic staining with anti-IgM serum. In addition, Leu 3a+ cells were found in the germinal center, especially on the capsular side showing a linear distribution. On the other hand, anti-Leu 2a antibody, which defines the suppressor/cytotoxic T cell subset, stained only a minority of lymphocytes in the interfollicular area and in the LES. Leu 2a+ cells were rarely found in the germinal centers. Anti-HLA-DR-positive cells were found with two types of staining pattern, i.e., with membrane staining found in the small lymphocytes in the mantle zone and the germinal center and with membrane and/or cytoplasmic staining found in large cells with dendritic processes in the germinal center, in the LES, and in the interfollicular areas. These findings demonstrate the presence of intimate cellular interactions in T cells, B cells, and macrophages in the tonsil, and indicate that immunohistological study of the tonsil may provide new insights into the pathogenesis of tonsillar lesions."

CD010502,0,20638606,0,Macrolide-resistant Streptococcus pyogenes from Chinese pediatric patients in association with Tn916 transposons family over a 16-year period.,"To investigate changes in the antimicrobial susceptibility of Streptococcus pyogenes isolates over a 16-year period, 456 group A streptococci isolates were collected from Chinese pediatric patients among 1993 to 1994 and 2005 to 2008. Susceptibilities to antibiotics were performed using agar dilution methods. The macrolide resistance genes ermB, ermTR, mefA, and tetracycline-resistant gene tetM and the int and xis genes of Tn916 family were detected by polymerase chain reaction. All 456 strains were analyzed by emm typing. Selected strains representing each emm type were further characterized by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. The resistance rates of erythromycin and clindamycin both significantly increased during the 2 sample periods (79.7% versus 94% for erythromycin and 75.4% versus 96.9% for clindamycin). Telithromycin resistance rate increased from 20.37% to 87.93%. Among the macrolide resistance strains, the rate of strains with the genes int, xis, tetM, and ermB increased with time (16.05% versus 86.91%, P < 0.05). The emm1 and emm12 isolates had high rates of ermB gene, which increased after 16 years (65.2% versus 86.23% for emm1 and 7.7% versus 91.8% for emm12). This study demonstrates the increase in macrolide resistance in S. pyogenes in Chinese children over a 16-year period. The phenomenon may be related not only with the shift in the emm types but also with the change of macrolide-resistant mechanisms. The change of Tn916 family among the isolates may be related with the increased resistance."

CD010502,0,2732345,0,Hyaluronidase production in Streptococcus milleri in relation to infection.,"One hundred and seven (41%) of 262 isolates of Streptococcus milleri, from human sources, produced hyaluronidase. Hyaluronidase production was commoner in beta haemolytic isolates 32 of 39 (82%), many of which were of Lancefield group F. But hyaluronidase was also found in alpha and non-haemolytic isolates, and in groups A, C, G, and non-groupable isolates. There was a strong association between hyaluronidase production and isolation from known internal abscesses (48/58, 83%) compared with isolates from the normal flora of uninfected sites (24/97, 25%). Isolates from 15 patients with endocarditis were uniformly negative, although 13 of 25 (52%) isolates from dental plaque produced the enzyme. Production of hyaluronidase may therefore be an important determinant in the pathogenicity of infection by S milleri and could be helpful in predicting the likelihood of deep purulent lesions in isolates from blood culture."

CD010502,0,9484889,0,Streptolysin O and adherence synergistically modulate proinflammatory responses of keratinocytes to group A streptococci.,"In contrast to a mutant adhesin-deficient Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococcus), its isogenic parental strain binds to human keratinocytes and promotes a vigorous proinflammatory response, characterized by enhanced expression of several cytokines, a more rapid release of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and damage to keratinocyte membranes. However, adherence alone is not sufficient to induce these responses. In this study, we have begun to examine the contribution of other streptococcal products in interactions with keratinocytes by the construction and evaluation of mutants deficient in expression of the secreted pore-forming haemolysin, streptolysin O (SLO). Inactivation of SLO did not prevent the streptococci from adhering to cultured HaCaT keratinocytes or from expressing an unrelated second streptococcal haemolysin, streptolysin S, during infection of keratinocytes. As measured by a quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay, inactivation of SLO also did not have a marked effect on the expression of interleukin 1alpha (IL-1alpha) during infection. However, the lack of the ability to produce SLO was associated with a considerable reduction in expression of IL-1beta, IL-6 and IL-8 by infected keratinocytes. Measurement of the release of PGE2 by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay demonstrated that the SLO-deficient mutants were also not capable of promoting the rapid high level of PGE2 release characteristic of the adherent SLO-producing parental strain. Finally, analyses using the fluorescent probe ethidium homodimer-1 and measurements of release of keratinocyte lactate dehydrogenase indicated that the failure of the SLO-deficient mutants to induce responses was associated with the failure of these mutants to damage the integrity of the keratinocyte membrane. These data implicate SLO as a factor that acts synergistically with an adhesin to modulate the signalling responses of keratinocytes during infection."

CD010502,0,2010271,0,Evaluation of a rapid method for diagnosing streptococcal pharyngitis in a rural community clinic.,"Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis is a common ailment whose accurate diagnosis is dependent on laboratory testing. Transport problems common to rural practices, for laboratory testing, could be resolved by a reliable rapid test. Laboratory evaluations of rapid streptococcal tests, performed mostly in research settings, indicate that the tests have acceptable specificity and sensitivity. This paper describes a comparison study of 248 consecutive throat swab specimens using a commercially available agglutination test with routine throat culturing. All agglutination testing was done by the office staff under actual working conditions, in a rural primary care clinic. The cultures were processed in the main regional microbiology laboratory. As a result of transportation delay, swabs were plated either within 6 h from collection or after 6 h. The test sensitivity (72%) and specificity (88%) compared well with that reported in the literature from microbiology laboratories, especially for swabs plated within six hours (80% and 93% respectively). The rapid test is an acceptable alternative to the standard culture technique in the family practice office under normal working conditions, provided that patients with negative results follow up with throat cultures."

The optimal concentration of the enzyme-treated whole cells used to coat the wells was 2 x 10(7) cells per well. Rabbit antiserum diluted to 1:12,800 and human serum diluted to 1:1,000 were found to be the optimal concentrations for antibody measurement. Antibody that reacted with enzyme-treated whole cells in rabbit antiserum was absorbed with group A streptococcal whole cells, purified C carbohydrate, and N-acetylglucosamine only. Enzyme-treated whole cells did not react with anti-lipoteichoic acid antibody, and rabbit antiserum did not react with lipoteichoic acid. There was a highly significant correlation between the anti-C carbohydrate antibody titrated with enzyme-treated whole cells and that with purified C carbohydrate as antigen. The correlation coefficient for the immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies was r = 0.75, and for the IgG antibodies it was r = 0.77. When the IgG antibody titers to the enzyme-treated whole cells of the sera of patients with acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis and rheumatic fever were compared with those of sera of healthy individuals, the sera of patients with poststreptococcal sequelae had significantly higher titers than did healthy individuals. Although anti-C carbohydrate antibody in human sera mostly belonged to the IgG2 subclass, there was anti-C carbohydrate antibody that belonged to the IgG3 subclass in a certain percentage of patients with rheumatic fever and acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis."

An initial component was isolated (GLCM) which was soluble in aqueous buffer, but was heavily contaminated with LIS. Dialysis of GLCM vs. 0.01 M Tris-EDTA (TE) buffer yielded a weakly antigenic component, TE-GLCM, with negligible contamination by LIS. Subsequent dialysis of TE-GLCM vs. isotonic calcium chloride produced two fractions, a soluble one (CMS) and a precipitate (CMP).

CMS was shown to be a calcium dependent antigen, and immunologically related to human glomerular basement membrane (GBM) antigens."
CD010502,0,14523534,1,[Reliability and general practice value of 2 rapid Streptococcus A tests].,"Rapid streptococcal-A-antigen detection assays have good specificity (over 90 percent) but moderate sensitivity (between 80 and 90 percent), when the tests are compared with a standard throat culture. Contradictory results have been found for one of the more recent tests, the optical immune assay Strep A OIA MAX, while for 6 years, we have been using the immune assay Strep A Plus. Results of the optical immunoassay and the conventional immune assay Strep A Plus were compared in 65 patients with acute pharyngitis. A standard culture was used as reference and confirmed by enhanced broth culturing and nucleic acid hybridization assay (Gen-Probe) when the two detection assays produced contradictory results. While both assays were equally sensitive (78.3%), Strep A OIA MAX and Strep A Plus had a similar specificity of 95.2% and 100%, respectively. Four and nine steps were required for Strep A Plus and for Strep A OIA MAX test procedures, respectively with results being available in 4-5 min and in 9-10 min, respectively. We conclude that both rapid immunoassays have a similar reliability while the handling of the Strep A Plus is much simpler than the handling of the Strep A OIA MAX. Neither rapid immunoassays are sensitive enough to eliminate the need for backup cultures."

The 5' sequence of spa36 was highly variable compared to spa18, while the 3' sequence was conserved. Antisera against Spa36 opsonized type 36 streptococci but not type 18 streptococci, indicating that the opsonic Spa epitopes were type-specific. Antisera against the conserved carboxy-terminal half of Spa18 were used to identify Spa or Spa-like proteins expressed on the surface of 25 of 70 different serotypes of GAS. Spa proteins may represent a new family of type-specific surface antigens that function in concert with M proteins to elicit protective immune responses."
CD010502,0,21976764,0,Epidemiology of invasive Streptococcus pyogenes infections in France in 2007.,"Invasive group A streptococcal (GAS) infections cause significant morbidity and mortality. A national survey was initiated to assess the burden of invasive GAS infections in France, describe their clinical characteristics, and assess the molecular characteristics of GAS strains responsible for these infections. The survey was conducted in 194 hospitals, accounting for 51% of acute care hospital admissions in France. Clinical data, predisposing factors, and demographic data were obtained, and all GAS isolates were emm sequence typed. We identified 664 cases of invasive GAS infections, with an annual incidence of 3.1 per 100,000 population. The case-fatality ratio was 14% and rose to 43% in the case of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. Bacteremia without identified focus (22%) and skin/soft tissue infections (30%) were the most frequent clinical presentations. Necrotizing fasciitis was frequent in adults (18%) and uncommon in children (3%). The 3 predominant emm types were emm1, emm89, and emm28, accounting for 33%, 16%, and 10% of GAS isolates, respectively. The emm1 type was associated with fatal outcomes and was more frequent in children than in adults. Six clusters of cases were identified, with each cluster involving 2 invasive cases due to GAS strains which shared identical GAS emm sequence types. Four clusters of cases involved eight postpartum infections, one family cluster involved a mother and child, and one cluster involved two patients in a nursing home. Invasive GAS infection is one of the most severe bacterial diseases in France, particularly in persons aged ≥ 50 years or when associated with toxic shock syndrome."

We compare the characteristics of these strains with those of strains isolated from patients with non-invasive infections. SmaI-digested pulsed-field gel electrophoresis profiles of the isolates were almost indistinguishable between these groups, however, we found that ska (streptokinase gene) transcriptional levels in the strains isolated from patients with severe invasive infections were significantly higher than those in non-invasive infections."
CD010502,0,20886095,0,Post-streptococcal auto-antibodies inhibit protein disulfide isomerase and are associated with insulin resistance.,"Post-streptococcal autoimmunity affects millions worldwide, targeting multiple organs including the heart, brain, and kidneys. To explore the post-streptococcal autoimmunity spectrum, we used western blot analyses, to screen 310 sera from healthy subjects with (33%) and without (67%) markers of recent streptococcal infections [anti-Streptolysin O (ASLO) or anti-DNAse B (ADB)]. A 58 KDa protein, reacting strongly with post-streptococcal sera, was identified as Protein Disulfide Isomerase (PDI), an abundant protein with pleiotropic metabolic, immunologic, and thrombotic effects. Anti-PDI autoantibodies, purified from human sera, targeted similar epitopes in Streptolysin O (SLO, P51-61) and PDI (P328-338). The correlation between post-streptococcal status and anti-human PDI auto-immunity was further confirmed in a total of 2987 samples (13.6% in 530 ASLO positive versus 5.6% in 2457 ASLO negative samples, p<0.0001). Finally, anti-PDI auto-antibodies inhibited PDI-mediated insulin degradation in vitro (n = 90, p<0.001), and correlated with higher serum insulin (14.1 iu/ml vs. 12.2 iu/ml, n = 1215, p = 0.039) and insulin resistance (Homeostatic Model Assessment (HOMA) 4.1 vs. 3.1, n = 1215, p = 0.004), in a population-based cohort. These results identify PDI as a major target of post-streptococcal autoimmunity, and establish a new link between infection, autoimmunity, and metabolic disturbances."

CD010502,0,11766395,0,[Infection of herpes simplex virus (HSV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in acute tonsillitis--histopathological assessment by optical and electron microscopic observation of biopsy specimens of tonsils].,"Infection with HSV or EBV was studied by measuring serum antiviral antibody titers in adults with acute tonsillitis, and results were compared to light and electron microscopy findings of tonsil biopsy specimens. The clinical and laboratory features of acute tonsillitis caused by HSV or EBV were also studied. Subjiects were 42 patients with acute tonsillitis treated at the Department of Otorhinolaryngology at Tokyo Women's Medical University Daini Hospital between August 1997 and March 2000. They had failed to respond to antimicrobial agents prescribed by a physician, and had severe oropharyngeal mucosal lesions, liver dysfunction, skin eruptions, or cervical lymphadenopathy, with hospitalization required because of impaired food intake due to sore throat or deterioration in general condition. Subjects were 24 men (mean age: 30.8 years) and 18 women (mean age: 28.3 years) aged 16 to 78 years (mean: 29.8 years). A underwent, bacteriological and hematology tests and palatine tonsil biopsy specimens were obtained to examine tissue changes by light microscopy and electron microscopy due to detect HSV antigen by immunohistochemistry and EBV nucleic acids by EBV-encoded small nuclear RNA 1 and 2 (EBER) in situ hybridization (ISH). Among patients, the serum antiviral antibody profile indicated that 4 (9.5%) had acute tonsillitis due to primary HSV infection and 5 (11.9%) had acute tonsillitis due to primary EBV infection. The findings characteristic of acute tonsillitis due to primary HSV infection included stomatitis, skin eruptions, atypical lymphocytes, and liver dysfunction. Findings characteristic of acute tonsillitis due to primary EBV infection included petechiae of the soft palate, an increase of lymphocytes, atypical lymphocytes, and liver dysfunction. At the initial test, serum anti-HSV antibody was positive in 14 patients (33.3%), and more than half had no history of prior infection. Anti-EBNA antibody was positive in 32 (76.2%), and many had been infected previously. It should be noted that a decrease in positive HSV antibody means that acute tonsillitis due to primary HSV infection is not uncommon in adults and is expected to increase steadily. Light microscopy revealed histological changes in 2 patients. HSV antigen was positive in 2 (50%) with acute tonsillitis due to primary HSV infection, while EBER cells were positive in 5 (100%) with acute tonsillitis due to primary EBV infection, so special staining of the tissues was found to be useful. Electron microscopy failed to detect viral particles in ultrathin sections and no differences were seen in morphological changes or tissue damage between patients with positivity for HSV antigen and with EBER-positive cells. Detection of HSV antigen and EBV nucleic acids in pathological specimens from patients with acute tonsillitis requires careful judgment, but is considered useful for making an early diagnosis and for making a diagnosis in patients without an increase of the antiviral antibody titer and in those with reinfection or reactivation. Pathological examination (including special staining) and careful observation of clinical features may help to identify HSV or EBV infection and allow decisions to be made with regard to the therapeutic strategy and prevention of complications."
CD010502,0,21308380,0,Diagnosis and management of acute pharyngitis in a paediatric population: a cost-effectiveness analysis.,"Acute pharyngitis is one of the most frequent causes of primary care physician visits; however, there is no agreement about which is the best strategy to diagnose and manage acute pharyngitis in children. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the recommended strategies to diagnose and manage acute pharyngitis in a paediatric population. A decision tree analysis was performed to compare the following six strategies: ""treat all"", ""clinical scoring"", ""rapid test"", ""culture"", ""rapid test + culture"" and ""clinical scoring + rapid test"". The cost data came from the Spanish National Health Service sources. Cost-effectiveness was calculated from the payer's perspective. Effectiveness was measured as the proportion of patients cured without complications from the disease and did not have any reaction to penicillin therapy; a sensitivity analysis was performed. The findings revealed that the ""clinical scoring + rapid test"" strategy is the most cost-effective, with a cost-effectiveness ratio of 50.72 <euro>. This strategy dominated all others except ""culture"", which was the most effective but also the most costly. The sensitivity analysis showed that ""rapid test"" became the most cost-effective strategy when the clinical scoring sensitivity was <91% and its specificity was ≤9%. In conclusion, the use of a clinical scoring system to triage the diagnoses and performing a rapid antigen test for those with a high score is the most cost-effective strategy for the diagnosis and management of acute pharyngitis in children. When the clinical scoring system has a low diagnostic accuracy, testing all patients with rapid test becomes the most cost-effective strategy."

CD010502,0,7864482,0,Group A streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis: cost-effective diagnosis and treatment.,"Most patients who seek medical attention for sore throat are concerned about streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis, but fewer than 10% of adults and 30% of children actually have a streptococcal infection. Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci (GAS) are most often responsible for bacterial tonsillopharyngitis, although Neisseria gonorrhea, Arcanobacterium haemolyticum (formerly Corynebacterium haemolyticum), Chlamydia pneumoniae (TWAR agent), and Mycoplasma pneumoniae have also been suggested as possible, infrequent, sporadic pathogens. Viruses or idiopathic causes account for the remainder of sore throat complaints. Reliance on clinical impression to diagnose GAS tonsillopharyngitis is problematic; an overestimation of 80% to 95% by experienced clinicians typically occurs for adult patients. Overtreatment promotes bacterial resistance, disturbs natural microbial ecology, and may produce unnecessary side effects. Existing data suggest that rapid GAS antigen testing as an aid to clinical diagnosis can be very useful. When used appropriately, it is sensitive (79% to 88%) in detecting GAS-infected patients and is specific (90% to 96%) and cost-effective. Penicillin has been the treatment of choice for GAS tonsillopharyngitis since the 1950s; 10 days of treatment are necessary for bacterial eradication. A single IM injection of benzathine penicillin is effective and obviates compliance issues. Until the early 1970s, the bacteriologic failure rate for the treatment of GAS tonsillopharyngitis ranged from 2% to 10% and was attributed to chronic GAS carriers. Since the late 1970s, the penicillin failure rate has frequently exceeded 20% in published reports. Explanations for recurrent GAS tonsillopharyngitis include poor patient compliance; reacquisition from a family member or peer, copathogenic colonization by Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, anaerobes that inactivate penicillin with beta-lactamase, or all these organisms; suppression of natural immune response by too-early administration of antibiotics; GAS tolerance to penicillin; antibiotic eradication of normal pharyngeal flora that normally act as natural host defenses; and establishment of a true carrier state. When therapy fails, milder symptoms may occur during the relapse. Several antimicrobials have demonstrated superior efficacy compared with penicillin in eradicating GAS and are administered less frequently to enhance patient compliance. In previously untreated GAS throat infections, cephalosporins produce a 5% to 22% higher bacteriologic cure rate; after a penicillin treatment failure, these differences are greater. Amoxicillin/clavulanate and the extended-spectrum macrolides clarithromycin and azithromycin may also produce enhanced bacteriologic eradication in comparison to penicillin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

CD010502,0,11422184,0,Psoriasis vulgaris--a sterile antibacterial skin reaction mediated by cross-reactive T cells? An immunological view of the pathophysiology of psoriasis.,"The understanding of the pathogenesis of psoriasis vulgaris has advanced significantly since the therapeutic efficacy of immunosuppressive drugs has drawn attention to the role of immune mechanisms in psoriasis manifestation. Today, the results of many experimental studies provide evidence that psoriasis is largely a T-cell mediated disorder. It may result from antigen-specific activation of T cells in the skin of genetically predisposed individuals. These T cells apparently have a particular functional differentiation and promote the psoriatic skin changes by secreting a certain set of cytokines. Based on the fact that streptococcal throat infections are a trigger of guttate psoriasis, the putative psoriatic antigens are assumed to be in keratinocyte proteins that share structural homologies with streptococcal proteins and thus induce cross-reactive responses of antibacterial T cells against skin components. Together with the particular phenotype of psoriatic skin lesions these findings suggest that psoriasis represents a sterile antibacterial tissue reaction, which is mediated by streptococci-specific T cells that cross-react against epidermal autoantigens."
CD010502,0,19727784,0,Human beta-Defensins in different states of diseases of the tonsilla palatina.,"Tonsils are believed to play an important role during the development of the immune system. Although diseases of the tonsils like hypertrophy of the tonsil, acute tonsillitis, chronic tonsillitis or peritonsillar abscess are common, little is known about the underlying pathophysiology. Little is known about antimicrobial peptides produced by the tonsils. The human beta-Defensins 1-3 (hBD1-3) are naturally produced ""antibiotics"" with antimicrobial activity against different bacteria, fungi, and viruses. The objective of the study was to determine the concentrations for hBD1-3 in different states of diseases of the tonsilla palatina. After tonsillectomy and tissue fixation in formalin, total proteins were isolated from 38 samples (11 hypertrophy of the tonsil, 8 acute tonsillitis, 11 chronic tonsillitis, 8 peritonsillar abscesses). The protein concentration was determined and ELISA for hBD1-3 were performed. We also conducted immunofluorescence double stainings for the co-expression of streptococcus group A and hBD1-3. We could verify a significant difference for the mean hBD1 score of the acute tonsillitis in comparison to the hyperplastic tonsil, the chronic tonsillitis, and the peritonsillar abscess. There was no statistically significant difference in the hBD2 and hBD3 concentrations between the four groups. The immunofluorescence stainings showed that hBD1-3 and the streptococcus group A in the same place. We conclude that in the hyperplastic tonsilla palatina hBD1-3 play an important role. The mouth is constantly faced with a high bacterial load. During a tonsillitis, the hBD1 concentration is lower than in the non-acute infected tonsil because hBD1 is being consumed for fighting the bacterial infection. But, the existence of hBD1-3 in the tonsil cannot prevent the tonsillitis to become chronic."
CD010502,0,17012384,0,The plasminogen-binding group A streptococcal M protein-related protein Prp binds plasminogen via arginine and histidine residues.,"The migration of the human pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococcus) from localized to deep tissue sites may result in severe invasive disease, and sequestration of the host zymogen plasminogen appears crucial for virulence. Here, we describe a novel plasminogen-binding M protein, the plasminogen-binding group A streptococcal M protein (PAM)-related protein (Prp). Prp is phylogenetically distinct from previously described plasminogen-binding M proteins of group A, C, and G streptococci. While competition experiments indicate that Prp binds plasminogen with a lower affinity than PAM (50% effective concentration = 0.34 microM), Prp nonetheless binds plasminogen with high affinity and at physiologically relevant concentrations of plasminogen (K(d) = 7.8 nM). Site-directed mutagenesis of the putative plasminogen binding site indicates that unlike the majority of plasminogen receptors, Prp does not interact with plasminogen exclusively via lysine residues. Mutagenesis to alanine of lysine residues Lys(96) and Lys(101) reduced but did not abrogate plasminogen binding by Prp. Plasminogen binding was abolished only with the additional mutagenesis of Arg(107) and His(108) to alanine. Furthermore, mutagenesis of Arg(107) and His(108) abolished plasminogen binding by Prp despite the presence of Lys(96) and Lys(101) in the binding site. Thus, binding to plasminogen via arginine and histidine residues appears to be a conserved mechanism among plasminogen-binding M proteins."

After numerous serial subcultures in the cell wall-defective state, this stable L phase continued to produce hemolysin, hippuricase, and CAMP factor in addition to the group- and type-specific antigens. Hemolysin production by the L-phase cells was observed on solid and in liquid media containing sheep erythrocytes. Washed whole L-phase cells hydrolyzed hippuric acid. CAMP factor was detected by the characteristic hemolysis produced on blood agar by L-phase cells or filtered culture supernatants. CAMP factor activity was quantitated by an agar well diffusion system and a macrotube assay with partially purified preparations of CAMP factor and staphylococcal beta-hemolysin. Hyperimmune cow serum neutralized the CAMP activity of the L phase and parent bacterial phase to the same degree, suggesting identity of the CAMP factors. Production of hemolysin, hippuricase, and CAMP factor confirmed the bacterial origin of this L phase. Assay for these biological markers could be used to identify L-phase organisms derived from group B streptococci."
CD010502,0,10742155,0,New multi-determinant strategy for a group A streptococcal vaccine designed for the Australian Aboriginal population.,"Infection with group A streptococci can result in acute and post-infectious pathology, including rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease. These diseases are associated with poverty and are increasing in incidence, particularly in developing countries and amongst indigenous populations, such as Australia's Aboriginal population, who suffer the highest incidence worldwide. Immunity to group A streptococci is mediated by antibodies against the M protein, a coiled-coil alpha helical surface protein of the bacterium. Vaccine development faces two substantial obstacles. Although opsonic antibodies directed against the N terminus of the protein are mostly responsible for serotypic immunity, more than 100 serotypes exist. Furthermore, whereas the pathogenesis of rheumatic fever is not well understood, increasing evidence indicates an autoimmune process. To develop a suitable vaccine candidate, we first identified a minimum, helical, non-host-cross-reactive peptide from the conserved C-terminal half of the protein and displayed this within a non-M-protein peptide sequence designed to maintain helical folding and antigenicity, J14 (refs. 8,9). As this region of the M protein is identical in only 70% of group A streptococci isolates, the optimal candidate might consist of the conserved determinant with common N-terminal sequences found in communities with endemic group A streptococci. We linked seven serotypic peptides with J14 using a new chemistry technique that enables the immunogen to display all the individual peptides pendant from an alkane backbone. This construct demonstrated excellent immunogenicity and protection in mice."

The authors studied whether after infection of the child's body T. gondii does or does not determine the chronic course of tonsillitis. In 712 children with chronic tonsillitis serological examinations for toxoplasmosis were carried out by means of RVK, NIR and ELISA. Low titers of toxoplasme antibodies were found in 8.0% of the children examined. In light of the following findings the authors conclude that toxoplasme tonsillitis did not occur in their series: toxoplasma antibodies failed to be increased; their titers in seropositive children were low; toxoplasma was not isolated from tonsillar tissue; no direct microscopic evidence of the parasite could be established in smears of cell aspirate from lymph nodes regional to the palatine tonsils; the same smears failed to present the cytopathologic picture characteristic of nodal toxoplasmosis. In our ecologic conditions T. gondii is presumably not involved in the etiology of chronic tonsillitis, or it may be involved but to an epidemiologically not appreciable extent. (Tab. 10, Ref. 18)."

All strains changed their M protein production and/or opacity factor (OF)-activity during the passages. The capacity of each strain to adhere to a pool of buccal cells from six healthy individuals was studied both before and after passage. Five of six strains with decreased OF-activity/M protein production diminished significantly in adherence capacity, whereas one of two strains with increasing OF-activity adhered better to the epithelial cells.

CD010502,0,21920830,0,[Consensus document on the diagnosis and treatment of acute tonsillopharyngitis].,"Acute tonsillopharyngitis is one of the most common childhood diseases. Viruses are the most frequent origin. Group A Streptococcus (Streptococcus pyogenes) is the main bacterial cause. A culture or a rapid antigen-detection test of a throat-swab specimen should only be done on the basis of clinical scores, in order to avoid over-diagnosis of bacterial origin and unnecessary antibiotic prescription. The objectives of treatment are: the reduction of symptoms, reduce the contagious period, and prevent local suppurative and systemic complications. Ideally, only confirmed cases should receive antibiotics. If there is no possibility to perform a rapid antigen-detection test, or in some cases if the result is negative, it is recommended to perform a culture and, if there is high suspicious index, to prescribe antibiotics. Penicillin is the treatment of choice, although amoxicillin is also accepted as the first option. Amoxicillin/clavulanate is not indicated in any case as empirical treatment. Macrolides are not a first choice antibiotic, and should be reserved for those patients with immediate penicillin allergy reaction or for the treatment of streptococcal carriers. It is of primordial importance to adapt the prescribing of antibiotics to the scientific evidence."
CD010502,0,21123536,0,"Persistence, replacement, and rapid clonal expansion of meningococcal carriage isolates in a 2008 university student cohort.","A study of meningococcal carriage dynamics was performed with a cohort of 190 first-year students recruited from six residential halls at Nottingham University, United Kingdom. Pharyngeal swabs were obtained on four occasions between November 2008 and May 2009. Direct plating and culture on selective media were succeeded by identification and characterization of meningococci using PCR-based methodologies. Three serogroup Y clones and one serogroup 29E clone were highly prevalent in particular residential halls in November 2008, which is indicative of rapid clonal expansion since the start of the academic year. Persistent carriage of the same meningococcal strain for at least 5 to 6 months was observed in 45% of carriers, with infrequent evidence of antigenic variation in PorA. Sequential carriage of heterologous meningococcal strains occurred in 36% of carriers and involved strains with different capsules and antigenic variants of PorA and FetA in 83% of the cases. These clonal replacement strains also exhibited frequent differences in the presence and antigenic structures of two other surface proteins, NadA and HmbR. This study highlights the low level of antigenic variation associated with persistent carriage but, conversely, the importance of alterations in the repertoire of antigenic variants for sequential carriage of meningococcal strains. Rapid clonal expansion of potentially pathogenic strains in residential halls has implications for the implementation of public health interventions in university populations."

Cationic, extracellular streptococcal antigens were detected in 8 of 18 renal biopsies from patients with acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (APSGN). The antigen was found mainly in earlier biopsies in which both IgG and IgM were present. Patients' sera taken at the time of biopsy contained antibody to cationic, streptococcal antigens. Cationic moieties are known to have affinity for the glomerular basement membrane and it is possible that the type of antigen described here initiates APSGN via in situ immune complex formation."

Laboratory records of the Elmwood Pediatric Group (EPG), Rochester, NY, were retrospectively reviewed to identify all patients with pharyngeal RAD tests for GAS performed from January 1996 through May 1999. From January 1996 through October 1997 (study period 1), EPG physicians used either a RAD test or a throat culture to identify GAS; from November 1997 through May 1999 (study period 2), RAD tests were used as the primary test on all patients. Rapid antigen detection test negative results were confirmed with culture. During the 3-year study 11,427 RAD tests were performed. 8,385 (73.4%) were negative and 3,042 (26.6%) were positive. In study period 1, 3,547 (73.2%) were negative and 1,299 (26.8%) were positive; in study period 2 4,837 (73.5%) were negative and 1,743 (26.5%) were positive. Of the 8,385 negative tests, 8,234 (98.2%) were followed up with throat cultures.

A cost analysis was performed for study period 2, which showed that abandoning throat culture confirmation would generate a cost saving of $13,521 per year to the practice. Throat culture confirmation of RAD test negative results in pharyngitis patients may not be medically necessary for most patients with currently available RAD tests and is costly."
CD010502,0,1797029,0,Binding profiles of anticardiolipin antibodies in sera from patients with SLE and infectious diseases.,"Inhibition experiments were performed to study the specificity of IgG-class antibody, binding to cardiolipin immobilized onto a polystyrene surface, in sera from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or infection. Six different phospholipids (three anionic: cardiolipin, phosphatidylserine and phosphatidic acid, and three neutral: phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine and platelet activating factor), lipopolysaccharide from Salmonella Minnesota (ReLPS), strain Re595 and lipoteichoic acid from Streptococcus pyogenes were used as inhibitors, in the form of liposomes. Eight of fifteen SLE sera exhibited strong reactivity to phosphatidylserine liposomes; other anionic phospholipids, cardiolipin and phosphatidic acid, were less effective inhibitors. The binding was inhibited effectively only by cardiolipin in three of the SLE sera, and by none of the anionic phospholipids tested in the remaining four SLE sera. In most sera from patients with bacterial infections (including syphilis), anti-cardiolipin antibodies (ACA) were inhibited only by cardiolipin, but in some cases also by phosphatidic acid. In Gram-negative infections, ACA were inhibited by ReLPS more effectively than by cardiolipin. ReLPS also inhibited ACA in two of five chlamydial sera. Appreciable inhibition of ACA by phosphatidylserine did not occur in infections. Thus, in contrast to previous studies, broad reactivity to anionic phospholipids occurred in only about half of SLE sera. This pattern of polyreactivity was not seen in infections."

Opsonization and phagocytosis are important defence mechanisms employed by the host to destroy group A streptococci. Antisera against the cell-surface M protein, of which over 150 different types have been identified, are opsonic and contribute to disease protection. In this issue of Molecular Microbiology, Sandin and colleagues have comprehensively analysed the regions of M5 protein that contribute to phagocytosis resistance and opsonization. Human plasma proteins bound to M5 protein B- and C-repeats were shown to block opsonization, an observation that needs to be carefully considered for the development of M protein-derived vaccines. While safe and efficacious human group A streptococcal vaccines are not commercially available, candidate M protein-derived vaccines have shown promise in murine vaccine models and a recent phase 1 human clinical trial."
CD010502,0,3314472,1,Comparison of the TestPack Strep A enzyme immunoassay system with anaerobically incubated cultures for detection of group A streptococci from oropharyngeal swabs.,"To find a rapid and sensitive test for detection of Group A streptococci (GABS), the performance of the TestPack Strep A (TPSA; Abbott) was compared with culture with the use of rayon-tipped throat swabs from symptomatic patients six months to 90 years of age. Each swab was first inoculated to a 5% sheep blood agar plate and then tested for GABS antigen with the use of the TPSA and the manufacturer's instructions. Cultures were incubated anaerobically at 35 degrees C for 36-48 hours unless positive results were obtained after one night. GABS were identified with a fluorescent antibody method or a latex antibody test. From 1,616 throat swabs, 296 (18.3%) of the cultures contained GABS. The sensitivity and specificity of the TPSA were 73.3% and 94.8%, respectively, whereas the predictive values of positive and negative results were 75.9% and 94.1%, respectively. Results varied significantly, however, with different production lots of TPSA. The TPSA does not appear to provide a sensitive alternative to an anaerobic culture for detection of GABS."

The purpose of this study was to verify the reliability and rapidity of these tests and to give some information to the users about their analytical criteria and practicability characteristics. The analytical study has been performed on a same panel of four reference strains of Streptococcus pyogenes dilutions to determine the limit of detection of all the reagents in the same condition of methodology. The limit of detection has been calculated with the results expressed in colony forming unit by ml (CFU/ml). The practicability study has permitted to analyze the quality of the presentation, the easiness of the final reading and of performing tests. A score has been established for each rapid test. A classification of the analytical sensitivity (limit of detection) and practicability (score) of these 16 devices has been established. The limit of detection of the reagents giving the best results allows the detection of the lowest bacterial concentration of the panel which is 10(5) CFU/ml. Regarding practicability, the results suggest that, the immunochromatographic strip methods have the best score in a view with the use by a non medical laboratory."
CD010502,0,16359315,0,Binding of human plasma proteins to Streptococcus pyogenes M protein determines the location of opsonic and non-opsonic epitopes.,"Antibodies directed against a pathogenic microorganism may recognize either protective or non-protective epitopes. Because antibodies elicited by a vaccine must be directed against protective epitopes, it is essential to understand the molecular properties that distinguish the two types of epitope. Here we analyse this problem for the antiphagocytic M protein of Streptococcus pyogenes, using the opsonizing capacity of antibodies to estimate their ability to confer protection in vivo. Our studies were focused on the M5 protein, which has three surface-exposed regions: the amino-terminal hypervariable region (HVR) and the B- and C-repeat regions. We first analysed the role of different M5 regions in phagocytosis resistance under non-immune conditions, employing chromosomal mutants expressing M5 proteins with internal deletions, and demonstrate that only the B-repeat region is essential for phagocytosis resistance. However, only antibodies to the HVR were opsonic. This apparent paradox could be explained by the ability of fibrinogen and albumin to specifically bind to the B- and C-repeats, respectively, causing inhibition of antibody binding under physiological conditions, while antibodies to the HVR could bind and promote deposition of complement. These data indicate that binding of human plasma proteins plays an important role in determining the location of opsonic and non-opsonic epitopes in streptococcal M protein."

CD010502,0,16333101,0,Use of phylogenetic and phenotypic analyses to identify nonhemolytic streptococci isolated from bacteremic patients.,"The aim of this study was to evaluate molecular and phenotypic methods for the identification of nonhemolytic streptococci. A collection of 148 strains consisting of 115 clinical isolates from cases of infective endocarditis, septicemia, and meningitis and 33 reference strains, including type strains of all relevant Streptococcus species, were examined. Identification was performed by phylogenetic analysis of nucleotide sequences of four housekeeping genes, ddl, gdh, rpoB, and sodA; by PCR analysis of the glucosyltransferase (gtf) gene; and by conventional phenotypic characterization and identification using two commercial kits, Rapid ID 32 STREP and STREPTOGRAM and the associated databases. A phylogenetic tree based on concatenated sequences of the four housekeeping genes allowed unequivocal differentiation of recognized species and was used as the reference. Analysis of single gene sequences revealed deviation clustering in eight strains (5.4%) due to homologous recombination with other species. This was particularly evident in S. sanguinis and in members of the anginosus group of streptococci. The rate of correct identification of the strains by both commercial identification kits was below 50% but varied significantly between species. The most significant problems were observed with S. mitis and S. oralis and 11 Streptococcus species described since 1991. Our data indicate that identification based on multilocus sequence analysis is optimal. As a more practical alternative we recommend identification based on sodA sequences with reference to a comprehensive set of sequences that is available for downloading from our server. An analysis of the species distribution of 107 nonhemolytic streptococci from bacteremic patients showed a predominance of S. oralis and S. anginosus with various underlying infections."
CD010502,0,3547290,0,Streptozyme test for antibodies to group A streptococcal antigens.,"The ability of the Streptozyme test to identify significant antibody rises in 46 patients with streptococcal pharyngitis was comparable to, but no greater than, that of the antistreptolysin O or antideoxyribonuclease B test and inferior to that of the combined use of both the antistreptolysin O and antideoxyribonuclease B tests. Serum specimens were also simultaneously analyzed with three different lots of Streptozyme reagent. Lot-to-lot variation in the reagent resulted in a significant difference in antibody titer for 18 (19%) of the 92 sera tested. Differences among the three lots also produced variation in determining whether a significant rise in titer had occurred from the acute phase to the convalescent phase serum for a given patient. These observations raise concerns about the standardization of the Streptozyme reagent and document the need for precise identification and quantitation of the streptococcal antigens used in this product."

CD010502,0,2582066,0,Seroepidemiological studies of group B Streptococcus type II.,"In the course of prospective epidemiological studies of group B streptococcal (GBS) colonization and infection, we surveyed 401 paired maternal and cord sera (obtained at delivery) and 23 sera from patients with systemic type II infection for IgG antibody to GBS type II. Type II carriers were more likely to have antibody (greater than 2 micrograms/ml) than were those carrying other GBS types, whereas noncolonized patients were the least likely to have antibody. The overall prevalence of levels of antibody greater than 2 micrograms/ml was estimated to be approximately 6%, on the basis of assay results of the 401 maternal-cord pairs and adjusted for known-colonization status for the entire population of 8,928 deliveries that occurred during the study period. The majority of patients with infection had antibody levels less than 2 micrograms/ml. Five patients, however, had antibody present at levels ranging from 2.7 to 5.8 micrograms/ml. These findings suggest that ""antibody deficiency"" was widespread and was not by itself a useful determinant of risk for disease caused by GBS type II."
CD010502,0,7584694,0,Exposure to superantigens as an immunogenetic explanation of type I diabetes mini-epidemics.,"Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) is considered to be an autoimmune disease. Autoimmune diseases result from the breakdown of self-tolerance elicited by environmental factors on a susceptible genetic background. This reduced tolerance allows immunocompetent cells to attack normal structures present on an individual's tissues. The study of the T cells present in the islets of patients who died at the onset of the disease allowed the recognition of ""superantigens"" as etiopathogenetic factors in the development of IDDM. Since superantigens are the product of bacteria or viruses able to quickly stimulate a large number of the peripheral T cells sharing the same T cell receptor V beta segments once presented by certain HLA class II molecules, a number of observations in genetics, immunology, virology and epidemiology can now find a unifying explanation."

CD010502,0,10523570,0,Rapid identification of Burkholderia pseudomallei in blood cultures by a monoclonal antibody assay.,"Burkholderia pseudomallei is the causative agent of melioidosis. In northeast Thailand, this gram-negative bacterium is a major cause of mortality from septicemia. The definitive diagnosis of this disease is made by bacterial culture. In this study, we produced a monoclonal antibody (MAb) specific to the 30-kDa protein of B. pseudomallei by in vivo and in vitro immunization of BALB/c mice with a crude culture filtrate antigen. The MAb could directly agglutinate with all 243 clinical isolates of B. pseudomallei but not with other gram-negative bacteria, except for one strain of Burkholderia mallei. However, the MAb cross-reacted with the gram-positive Bacillus sp. and Streptococcus pyogenes. B. pseudomallei in brain heart infusion broth (BHIB) subcultured from a BacT/Alert automated blood culture system could be identified by simple agglutination with this MAb assay. The sensitivity and specificity of direct agglutination compared to the ""gold standard,"" the culture method, were 94.12 and 98.25%, respectively. However, the MAb adsorbed to polystyrene beads or latex particles directly identified the bacterium in blood culture specimens and in BHIB subcultured from a BacT/Alert automated blood culture system. The sensitivity of the latex agglutination test was 100% for both blood culture and BHIB specimens. The specificity was 85.96 and 96.49% for the blood culture and BHIB specimens, respectively. The specificity could be increased if the nonspecific materials in the blood culture broths were eradicated by centrifugation at low speeds. Thus, a combination of blood culture and the agglutination method could be used for the rapid diagnosis of melioidosis in the routine bacteriological laboratory. This method could speed up detection of the bacterium in blood culture by at least 2 days, compared to the conventional bacterial culture method. In addition, the MAb is stable at room temperature for 2 weeks and at 4, -20, and -70 degrees C for at least 1 year. The latex reagent was stable for at least 6 months at 4 degrees C."

CD010502,0,14532198,0,emm typing of M nontypeable invasive group A streptococcal isolates in Israel.,"We performed emm typing of M nontypeable invasive group A streptococcal (GAS) isolates collected in a prospective population-based study in Israel. One hundred twenty of 131 isolates (92%) had emm sequences compatible with GAS, consisting of 51 different emm types. Eleven isolates were found to be group G streptococcus. Of the 120 isolates, 55 (46%) belonged to 32 types for which there were no typing sera available in the Streptococcal Reference Laboratory in Israel. The other 65 (64%) isolates, consisting of 19 types, had sera available and therefore could have been serotyped. Forty-three isolates had T and emm types which were not correlated according to standard M-typing protocols and were therefore missed. The principal effect of emm typing was the addition of 32 types not previously identified in Israel and the discovery of new associations between emm and T types. emm typing did not significantly change the proportion of M types; the five most common types were 3, 28, 2, 62, and 41. Twenty different types comprised 80% of all isolates. No new emm sequences were discovered. emm typing emphasized the unusually low incidence of M1 strains causing severe disease in Israel. As serological typing of GAS becomes more problematic due to lack of sera and the appearance of new emm types, reference laboratories should replace M typing with emm sequence typing. Development of a GAS vaccine relies on the emm type distributions in different geographical locations. In our study, 7% of isolates (types 41 and 62) are not included in a 26-valent vaccine that is being studied."

However, the importance of association of M. pneumoniae with episodes of AECOPD still remains doubtful. The present study was therefore undertaken to delineate the extent of involvement of M. pneumoniae in patients with AECOPD at a referral hospital in Delhi, India. Sputum samples and throat swabs from a total of 100 AECOPD patients attending the Clinical Research Center of Vallabhbhai Patel Chest Institute, Delhi, were collected during a 2-year period (January 2004-June 2006). The samples were investigated for the presence of aerobic bacterial pathogens and M. pneumoniae. Diagnosis of infection with M. pneumoniae was based on culture, serology, direct detection of M. pneumoniae specific antigen and PCR. Bacterial aetiology could be established in 16 of the 100 samples studied. Pseudomonas spp. were recovered from eight cases, Streptococcus pneumoniae from four and Klebsiella spp. from two cases. Acinetobacter sp. and Moraxella catarrhalis were isolated from one case each. Serological evidence of M. pneumoniae infection and/or detection of M. pneumoniae specific antigen were seen in 16 % of the cases. One case with definite evidence of M. pneumoniae infection also had coinfection with Pseudomonas spp. However, no direct evidence of M. pneumoniae infection was found in our study population as defined by culture isolation or PCR. In conclusion, although the serological prevalence of M. pneumoniae infection in our study population was significantly higher than in the control group, there was no direct evidence of it playing a role in AECOPD."

CD010502,0,20501965,0,Roles of oral bacteria in cardiovascular diseases--from molecular mechanisms to clinical cases: Cell-surface structures of novel serotype k Streptococcus mutans strains and their correlation to virulence.,"Streptococcus mutans is generally known as a pathogen of dental caries, and it is also considered to cause bacteremia and infective endocarditis (IE). S. mutans was previously classified into 3 serotypes, c, e, and f, due to the different chemical compositions of the serotype-specific polysaccharides, which are composed of a rhamnose backbone and glucose side chains. We recently designated non-c/e/f serotype S. mutans strains as novel serotype k, which is characterized by a drastic reduction in the amount of the glucose side chain. A common biological feature of novel serotype-k strains is a lower level of cariogenicity due to alterations of several major cell surface protein antigens. As for virulence in blood, these strains survive in blood for a longer duration due to lower antigenicity, while the detection rate of all strains carrying the gene encoding collagen-binding adhesin has been shown to be high. Furthermore, molecular biological analyses of infected heart valve specimens obtained from IE patients revealed a high detection rate of serotype-k S. mutans. Together, these findings suggest that serotype-k S. mutans strains show low cariogenicity but high virulence in blood as compared to the other serotypes, due to alterations of several cell surface structures."
CD010502,0,7828392,0,Indium-111 labelled leucocyte uptake in aortitis.,"Inflammatory conditions of the aorta may present with non-specific clinical features, including unexplained fever. Indium-111 labelled leucocyte imaging may be performed in such patients to look for the presence of occult sepsis or to assess the activity of a known vasculitis. Of approximately 1100 patients to undergo leucocyte scintigraphy for these indications over a 5 year period, three had focal leucocyte uptake in the aorta. The final diagnoses were: (1) periaortitis in Wegener's granulomatosis; (2) aortic dissection in giant cell arteritis; and (3) streptococcal aortitis with impending rupture. In all three cases the uptake was initially not thought to be in the aorta, but in bowel, a paravertebral abscess and in the lumbar spine respectively. Further imaging with CT and MRI led to the correct diagnoses. As the aorta is a rare site of focal leucocyte uptake, errors in image interpretation are likely. The rapid diagnosis of inflammatory conditions of the aorta is essential, however, as they may be life-threatening if unrecognized; therefore awareness of the aorta as a potential site of uptake is important. Urgent referral for further imaging is imperative in these cases as a false or delayed diagnosis may lead to avoidable morbidity and mortality."

The lymphocyte cytotoxicity of melanoma patients was similar to that of normal donors and control patients with benign skin disease. Furthermore, the lymphocyte cytotoxicity of melanoma patients was not correlated to the stage of the disease. Similarly, lysis of K562 cells by monocytes isolated by adherence to autologous serum-coated plastic dishes in melanoma patients was comparable to that of controls and not associated with the stage of the disease. Positive monocyte reactions were recorded in 10 of 30 (33%) melanoma patients, seven of 21 (33%) normal donors and three of 10 (30%) control patients. There was no correlation between lymphocyte cytotoxicity and monocyte cytotoxicity. Overnight treatment of monocytes and lymphocytes with OK432 resulted in an increase in cytotoxicity. Significant augmentation of cytotoxicity by OK432 was observed in 28% of the monocyte samples and 86% of the lymphocyte samples, while partially purified human interferon augmented cytotoxicity in 63% of the monocyte samples and all the lymphocyte samples. These results suggest that neither lymphocyte nor monocyte cytotoxicities are depressed in melanoma patients as compared with normal donors and patients with benign disease and that OK432 has a stronger stimulatory effect on lymphocytes than on monocytes."

Although the guidelines appear to make widely diverging recommendations, we show that the controversy centers on only a small proportion of patients: those presenting with severe pharyngitis. We examine recently published data to illustrate that this seemingly simple problem of strep throat remains a philosophical issue: should we give primacy to relieving acute time-limited symptoms, or should we emphasize the potential societal risk of antibiotic resistance? We accept potentially over treating a minority of adult pharyngitis patients with the most severe presentations to reduce suffering in an approximately equal number of patients who will have false negative test results if the test-and-treat strategy were used."

CD010502,0,7955625,0,Infection and molecular mimicry in autoimmune diseases of childhood.,"The etiopathogenesis of childhood chronic autoimmune disease is, in most cases, unknown. Most likely, several factors overlap in determining the loss of tolerance toward certain autoantigens that become the target of the disease and the main cause of its perpetuation. Infectious agents have often been implicated in the pathogenesis of these diseases, but, to date, compelling evidence for a horizontal transmission or for localized epidemics is lacking. Human pathogens may nevertheless play a role in determining the loss of tolerance toward certain self-antigens by means of mechanisms other than classic infection. It is common knowledge that human pathogens often express proteins with high antigenic potential with important homologies with human proteins. Evolutionary pressures based upon the necessity of escaping the host's specific immune responses may have determined this phenomenon, called ""molecular mimicry"". It is reasonable to assert that certain individuals can develop abnormal immune responses upon contact with an antigen that mimics a self-protein. These responses may ultimately lead to self-reactivity and autoimmune disease. In this model of molecular mimicry, self-reactivity is triggered by cross-recognition of a self and an exogenous protein that bear the same sequence. A disease triggered by such a mechanism should present with: i) some form of an acute or chronic autoimmune clinical manifestation; ii) a documented clinical correlation between contact with a human pathogen and the autoimmune disease; iii) immune cross-reaction between a protein from a pathogen and a homologous human protein. Acute rheumatic fever, Reiter's syndrome and the other reactive arthritides fulfill the above conditions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD010502,0,3532629,0,Albumin bound to the surface of M protein-positive streptococci increased their phagocytosis by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the absence of complement and bactericidal antibodies.,"Using a phagocytosis assay (Leijh 1980, Infect. Immun. 30, 421), determination of chemiluminescence, and transmission electron microscopy, the influence of the binding of albumin to M protein-positive group A streptococci on their phagocytosis by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNL) was investigated. Coating of streptococci with albumin in the absence of other serum components enhanced phagocytosis but not killing of the bacteria. Complement had no additional effect on engulfment. Fibrinogen reduced the enhancing effect of albumin. Albumin had no additional effect on the high phagocytosis rate of an M-protein-negative strain. It could be demonstrated that human PMNL bound human serum albumin-gold conjugate. The results are discussed with regard to the role of plasma proteins in the phagocytosis of streptococci under in vivo-conditions."
CD010502,0,15016372,0,"M protein, a classical bacterial virulence determinant, forms complexes with fibrinogen that induce vascular leakage.","Increased vascular permeability is a key feature of inflammatory conditions. In severe infections, leakage of plasma from the vasculature induces a life-threatening hypotension. Streptococcus pyogenes, a major human bacterial pathogen, causes a toxic shock syndrome (STSS) characterized by excessive plasma leakage and multi-organ failure. Here we find that M protein, released from the streptococcal surface, forms complexes with fibrinogen, which by binding to beta2 integrins of neutrophils, activate these cells. As a result, neutrophils release heparin binding protein, an inflammatory mediator inducing vascular leakage. In mice, injection of M protein or subcutaneous infection with S. pyogenes causes severe pulmonary damage characterized by leakage of plasma and blood cells. These lesions were prevented by treatment with a beta2 integrin antagonist. In addition, M protein/fibrinogen complexes were identified in tissue biopsies from a patient with necrotizing fasciitis and STSS, further underlining the pathogenic significance of such complexes in severe streptococcal infections."

CD010502,0,11703674,0,Binding of human C4BP to the hypervariable region of M protein: a molecular mechanism of phagocytosis resistance in Streptococcus pyogenes.,"The amino-terminal hypervariable region (HVR) of streptococcal M protein is required for the ability of this virulence factor to confer phagocytosis resistance. The function of the HVR has remained unknown, but the finding that many HVRs with extremely divergent sequences bind the human complement regulator C4b-binding protein (C4BP) has suggested that this ligand may play a role in phagocytosis resistance. We used the M22 system to study the function of bound C4BP and provide several lines of evidence that C4BP indeed contributes to phagocytosis resistance. First, the ability of anti-HVR antibodies to cause opsonization correlated with their ability to inhibit binding of C4BP. Secondly, a short deletion in the HVR eliminated C4BP binding and also reduced the ability of M22 to confer phagocytosis resistance. Thirdly, the addition of an excess of pure C4BP to a phagocytosis system almost completely blocked the effect of opsonizing anti-HVR antibodies. Together, our data indicate that binding of C4BP to the HVR of M22 plays an important role in phagocytosis resistance, but other properties of M22 also contribute. This study provides the first molecular insight into the mechanisms by which the HVR of an M protein confers phagocytosis resistance."

One of nine rabbits immunized with a peptide fragment of type 5 M protein (pep M5) produced antibody that cross-reacted by immunofluorescence with sarcolemmal membranes of human heart. The cross-reactive antibody could be removed by absorbing the antiserum with sarcolemmal membranes, types 5 and 19 streptococci, or their pepsin-extracted M proteins, but with no other serotypes tested. Although each of the pep M5 immune sera was opsonic for type 5 streptococci, only the heart-reactive antiserum opsonized type 19 streptococci. The opsonization of type 19 streptococci was abolished by absorbing the antiserum with sarcolemmal membranes isolated from human heart tissue. Purified heart-reactive antibodies eluted from sarcolemmal membranes opsonized both types 5 and 19 streptococci, indicating that the heart cross-reactive determinant of type 5 M protein is cross-protective. The cross-reactive antigen was purified by affinity chromatography from detergent extracts of sarcolemmal membranes and determined to be a complex protein composed of four subunits apparently linked by disulfide bonds."

A study including clinical characteristics and molecular epidemiology of the outbreak was initiated. Relevant clinical information was obtained from the medical records of the patients. Nine of the 16 patients had soft tissue infection, and seven of these had streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS). Mortality, both overall and among those with STSS, was 25%. Streptococcal isolates from these patients were characterized by serogrouping and emm sequence typing. The emm amplicons were further characterized by sequence analysis and restriction fragment length polymorphism (emm RFLP) analysis. The streptococci were identified as group A streptococcus (GAS) in 11 patients and group G streptococcus (GGS) in four patients. The patients with GGS infection were older than the patients with GAS infection, and all patients infected with GGS had predisposing comorbidities. Isolates from 13 patients were available for emm gene analysis and found to belong to nine different emm types. Similar differentiation was obtained with emm RFLP in GAS. Hence, the outbreak was polyclonal. Results suggestive of horizontal gene transfer and recombination between the emm genes of GAS, group C streptococcus and GGS were found in the isolates from seven patients. Such genetic recombination events suggest a possible role in pathogenesis."

CD010502,0,7680689,0,Type M12 protein from Streptococcus pyogenes is a receptor for IgG3.,"Streptococcus pyogenes, serotype M12, was discovered to express a human IgG3 binding protein. Western blot analysis of partially purified M12 protein, exposed to IgG3 myeloma protein, showed that both M12 Ag and the receptor protein were the same apparent size. A lambda clone (lambda 4.1) containing the emm12 open reading frame expressed both the M12 Ag and the IgG3 binding protein. The emm12 open reading frame was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction and subcloned into the expression vector pJLA602. Based on Western blot analysis, one recombinant Escherichia coli (pD3) expressed M12 protein with IgG3 binding activity. This result confirmed that the M12 protein from strain CS24 is also an IgG3 receptor. Deletion analyses showed that a truncated M12 protein encoded by an internal PvuII fragment was sufficient for IgG3 binding activity. Further deletion studies suggested that the IgG3 binding domain was located in a 200 amino acid internal fragment containing two directly repeated sequences. Other experiments suggest that the receptor did not bind to the same IgG3 domain as that recognized by protein G. The M12 protein did not bind human IgG1, IgG2, IgG4, or Ig from several other animal species."

Antibodies to streptococcal A polysaccharide (SAP) and lypoteichoic acid (LTA) were examined by ELISA, to streptolysin O by standard technique. SAP antibodies in high titers persisted from 5 to 12 months in ARF and rheumatic carditis patients especially when RHD was developing. High titers of antibodies to LTA and SLO persisted for 3 months since ARF onset, then fell (p < 0.05). ELISA proved sensitive in determination of antibodies to SAP and LTA. Its combination with determination of the titers to SLO antigens confirmed Streptococcus A infection involvement in emergence of ARF in all the cases including insidious or late-onset carditis and chorea. High levels of antibodies to SAP and LTA were more frequently detected in patients with RHD than in healthy persons (p < 0.001).

We evaluated two PYRase systems [Strep-A-Chek (SAC), E-Y Laboratories, San Mateo, CA; Strep-A-Fluor (SAF), BioSpec, Inc., Dublin, CA) for the presumptive identification of enterococci. Initially, 40 enterococcal and 21 nonenterococcal streptococci were tested, retrospectively. A prospective comparison of SAC and SAF to bile-esculin reaction (BE) was then incorporated into our routine procedure for the identification of non-beta-hemolytic streptococcal colonies from cultures. All isolates were speciated using standard biochemical tests. We encountered 85 enterococcal and 26 nonenterococcal isolates. Tests were performed on colonies from primary plates whenever possible (77 isolates). Sensitivity and specificity of both SAC and SAF were greater than 96% in identifying enterococci from routine cultures. These PYRase tests were cost-effective, easily adaptable to work-flow, and yielded results within 30 min. Thus, PYRase testing appears to be a reasonable alternative for the identification of enterococci in the clinical laboratory."

In this prospective study, 206 students at the age of 15 to 19 years were monitored from October 2002 to March 2003. Nasopharyngeal and laryngeal swabs were sampled in one-month intervals and cultured on a selective medium. All colonies detected in primary culture were saved for the study, a maximum of 20 colonies in cases of massive growth. A total of 1,242 isolates were obtained, all of them being examined by a molecular biology method RAPD (randomly amplified polymorphic DNA analysis). By other methods (determination of phenotype by slide agglutination and whole-cell ELISA test, the determination of sequence type, ST by multilocus sequence typing, testing of susceptibility to antibiotics) were always tested the first isolates from individual carriers and isolates from the same carrier with different RAPD characteristics, being 35 altogether. There were thirty three carriers of N. meningitidis detected among the 206 students (16%). The carriage of N. meningitidis was of long-term duration. The study of strains of N. meningitidis with molecular biology methods made it clear that the carrier population of meningococci is heterogeneous. The population of carrier meningococci was of clonal character and mostly non-virulent ST-complexes were detected. Multiple carriage of different clones of N. meningitidis is rare and usually of short-term duration. The colonization of upper respiratory tract by a single clone of N. meningitidis does not protect from colonization by other clone."
CD010502,0,20107486,0,Erysipelas caused by group A streptococcus activates the contact system and induces the release of heparin-binding protein.,"Bacterial skin infections, such as erysipelas or cellulitis, are characterized by fever and a painful erythematous rash. Despite the high prevalence of these infections, little is known about the underlying pathogenic mechanisms. This is partly due to the fact that a bacterial diagnosis is often difficult to attain. To gain insight into the pathogenesis of erysipelas, we investigated the samples obtained from infected and noninfected areas of skin from 12 patients with erysipelas. Bacterial cultures, detection of specific streptococcal antibodies in convalescent sera, and immunohistochemical analyses of biopsies indicated group A streptococcal etiology in 11 of the 12 patients. Also, electron micrographs of erythematous skin confirmed the presence of group A streptococcal cells and showed a limited solubilization of the surface-attached M protein. Degradation of high-molecular-weight kininogen and upregulation of the bradykinin-1 receptor in inflamed tissues indicated activation of the contact system in 11 patients. Analyses of release of the vasoactive heparin-binding protein (HBP) showed increased levels in the infected as compared with the noninfected areas. The results suggest that group A streptococci induce contact activation and HBP release during skin infection, which likely contribute to the symptoms seen in erysipelas: fever, pain, erythema, and edema."

CD010502,0,3898306,0,Group B streptococcal vaccines.,"In recent years group B Streptococcus (GBS) has been recognized as a major perinatal pathogen. As with other encapsulated bacteria, protective immunity appears to correlate with serum antibody specific for the homologous capsular polysaccharide antigen of each serotype. Since susceptibility of the young infant to disseminated GBS infection relates to type-specific antibody deficiency in maternal serum, immunization of women with purified GBS type-specific polysaccharides has been proposed as a method for the prevention of infant disease through placental transport of protective antibodies. Candidate native polysaccharides from GBS have been purified, immunochemically and structurally characterized, and employed as immunogen in healthy adult volunteers. Native type Ia, II, and III polysaccharides have been shown to be nontoxic, safe, and immunogenic in approximately 65%, 95%, and 70%, respectively, of nonimmune adults. Antibody response to immunization approaches 100% in previously immune volunteers. Vaccine-induced type-specific antibodies to these candidate polysaccharide vaccines promote in vitro opsonophagocytosis, protect animals given a lethal challenge of homologous organisms, and are predominantly of the IgG isotype. Once similar results can be documented in women immunized during the last half of pregnancy, efficacy of these candidate GBS polysaccharide vaccines in the prevention of neonatal and young infant GBS disease should be evaluated."

In this preliminary study the feasibility of a rheumatic heart disease primary prevention strategy was examined. Throat swabs were taken from 667 school-aged children and tested for group A streptococci (GAS) by a rapid antigen detection test (RADT): a subset was also tested by conventional culture, so as to compare the RADT with the reference (conventional culture) test. GAS was detected in 124% of the children tested by either rapid antigen test or conventional culture; for RADT alone the detection rate was 11.5% and for culture alone the detection rate was 9.4%. Detection rate of GAS was analyzed in symptomatic and asymptomatic subgroups. The subgroups were compared using Fisher's exact method. The identification of children with GAS allows for their further examination and treatment so that the prevalence of GAS in this vulnerable population, currently with an annual incidence of rheumatic fever of 50-134/100,000, may be reduced. The routine testing of school-aged children appears to be possible with current resources in Kosrae and can be a cost-effective public health measure."

The latter procedure removed contaminating lipoteichoic acid (LTA) from the T protein, which consisted of a heterogeneous mixture of polypeptides resistant to digestion by trypsin and ranged in molecular size from 160,000 to 200,000 daltons. Threonine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, lysine, and valine were the most predominant amino acids. The binding of LTA to an affinity column of T protein was reversible with increasing concentrations of ethanol but not with increasing ionic strength. T protein bound less palmitic acid and LTA than did fatty acid-free bovine albumin and did not stimulate human peripheral lymphocytes. Because the surface and cell wall distribution of the T proteins and LTA appear similar, the possibility exists that T proteins and LTA may interact in situ by weakly hydrophobic bonds. Such ligand-ligand interaction may be indirectly involved in the adherence of group A streptococci to host cell membranes that is known to be mediated by LTA."

CD010502,0,21228138,0,A novel monoclonal antibody against FbaA can inhibit the binding of the complement regulatory protein factor H to group A streptococcus.,"Some microbial pathogens utilize human complement regulatory proteins, such as factor H (FH) and factor H-like protein 1 (FHL-1), for immune evasion. FbaA is an FHL-1 and FH binding protein expressed on the surface of group A streptococcus (GAS), a common agent of pharyngeal, skin, and soft tissue infections. In this study, we prepared monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against FbaA, assayed them for specificity, and located their binding domains in FbaA. We found an MAb called FbaA MAb2, which demonstrated the highest affinity to GAS among all of the MAbs. Based on the binding with component peptides, the detected epitope, which was specific for FbaA MAb2, was the amino acid residues 95 to 118 of FbaA; on the other hand, it did not bind with the truncated protein of the internally deleted residues of the segment from 95 to 118 of FbaA. Furthermore, the predominant amino acids specific for FbaA MAb2 screened by phage display epitope library were I, T, P, D, and L, corresponding to the amino acid residues 101, 103, 105, 106, and 110 of FbaA, respectively. The binding location of FbaA with FH and FHL-1 was a 16-amino-acid region corresponding to amino acid residues 97 to 112 of FbaA, which overlapped the FbaA MAb2 binding domain, as confirmed by competitive inhibition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunofluorescence microscopy. Based on the results of the invasion assay, FbaA MAb2 can inhibit the binding of FH to GAS."

Here, we report the approximately 3 angstrom resolution structure of a GAS M1 fragment containing the regions responsible for eliciting type-specific, protective immunity and for binding fibrinogen, which promotes M1 proinflammatory and antiphagocytic functions. The structure revealed substantial irregularities and instabilities throughout the coiled coil of the M1 fragment. Similar structural irregularities occur in myosin and tropomyosin, explaining the patterns of cross-reactivity seen in autoimmune sequelae of GAS infection. Sequence idealization of a large segment of the M1 coiled coil enhanced stability but diminished fibrinogen binding, proinflammatory effects, and antibody cross-reactivity, whereas it left protective immunogenicity undiminished. Idealized M proteins appear to have promise as vaccine immunogens."

This B cell marker does not segregate with any known HLA or DR phenotype. We have examined the reactivity of D8/17 with a broad assortment of human tissues, using indirect immunofluorescence. Strong positive reactivity of D8/17 was observed with cardiac muscle, skeletal muscle, and smooth muscle of blood vessels. Positive fluorescent staining was also noted in cell membranes of hepatocytes and cells lining bile canaliculi as well as in epithelial cells of skin, esophagus, and cervix. D8/17 mAb binding to cardiac muscle was markedly diminished by preincubation of mAb with KH B cell line originally established from an RHD patient. D8/17 mAb binding to human heart was also inhibited by preincubation with myosin and tropomyosin but not by actin. Using the D8/17 mAb in immunoblots, positive binding was noted by the antibody to recombinant type M6 protein, vimentin, and myosin. Our findings indicate that the B cell antigen reacting with mAb D8/17 may be related to contractile proteins present in heart, skeletal and smooth muscle, and may also share epitopes with some components of group A streptococci."

To determine the cytokine profile (interferon-gamma, interleukin-4 and interleukin-10) of these T cells in response to streptococcal antigens, T cell lines were cultured from untreated lesional skin of 13 patients with chronic plaque psoriasis and 12 patients with other inflammatory skin diseases. T cell lines were incubated with or without a sonicated heat-killed mixture of group A streptococcal isolates for 18 h in the presence of a transport inhibitor, stained for surface CD4 or CD8 and intracellular cytokine expression, and analyzed by flow cytometry. Psoriatic T cell lines were grown from 10 of 13 patients and were predominately CD4+ (64%-85%) with 10%-32% CD8+ T cells. Variable numbers of CD4+ T cells produced interferon-gamma (0.8%-35%, median 13.9) in eight of 10 T cell lines (p < 0.02). In contrast, CD4+ T cells in five of 12 T cell lines obtained from disease controls did not produce or produced minimal interferon-gamma in response to group A streptococcal isolates; this was significantly different from the psoriatic T cell lines (p < 0.05). Small numbers of interleukin-10 positive (0.8%-1.3%) and interleukin-4 positive (2.1%-2.5%) CD4+ T cells induced by group A streptococcal isolates were also present in two out of five and three out of five psoriatic T cell lines, respectively. This was significantly less in each case than the numbers of CD4+/interferon-gamma+ T cells (p < 0.05). Cytokine-positive CD8+ T cells were rarely observed. These findings demonstrate that a subpopulation of CD4+ T cells in chronic plaque psoriasis skin lesions produces interferon-gamma in response to streptococcal antigens and may be relevant to the pathogenesis of psoriasis."

The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (CCL2/MCP-1) and interleukin-8 (CXL8/IL-8) in APSGN with special emphasis on their role in the clinical course of renal disease. Twenty-one children with APSGN were studied. Serum and urinary CCL2/MCP-1 and CXL8/IL-8 levels were measured by ELISA. The relationships between urinary chemokines and the degree of proteinuria were investigated. Serum and urinary CCL2/MCP-1 levels were significantly higher in the acute phase than in the resolution phase and in controls ( P<0.05). Urinary CCL2/MCP-1 levels in the control group were significantly lower than in both the acute and resolution phases ( P=0.01 and P =0.001, respectively). In the acute phase, urinary CCL2/MCP-1 correlated with the extent of proteinuria ( r=0.58, P =0.006) but not with serum CCL2/MCP-1 levels ( r=0.21, P =0.36). Urinary and serum CXL8/IL-8 levels were significantly elevated in the acute phase compared with the resolution phase and controls ( P<0.05). A consistent increase in urinary CCL2/MCP-1 was found in the acute phase of patients with APSGN, and this correlates with the degree of proteinuria.

Regression analysis revealed that the RSS result was an important independent predictor for the posttest decision to treat with antibiotics and for the estimated probability of disease. The mean absolute log-likelihood ratio was used to quantify the effect of the RSS on diagnostic certainty; a greater contribution to diagnostic certainty occurred when the RSS was positive. Physicians would have prescribed an antibiotic 49 times without the benefit of the RSS and prescribed an antibiotic 48 times given the RSS result. Without the RSS, the treatment decision contradicted the throat culture result in 25 cases. With the RSS, this occurred in 26 cases. The RSS, while influencing decision making, especially when positive, did not decrease the use of antibiotics."
CD010502,0,6223878,0,[Immunopathology of the kidney. Immunohistochemical findings in inflammatory kidney disease].,"The immunohistological evaluation of kidney biopsies is essential for the diagnosis of inflammatory lesions caused by immunological processes. It enables the differentiation between glomerulonephritis caused by the action of antibodies against glomerular basement membrane (autoimmune-glomerulonephritis) and glomerulonephritis caused by deposition of circulating immune complexeses. The larger group of immunecomplex-glomerulonephritides can further be differentiated behalf of the topography of immunoglobulin and complement deposits within the glomerulus. Some immunohistological findings correlate with histologically characterized glomerulonephritides (acute postinfectious, perimembranous, membrano-proliferative glomerulonephritis, dense deposits disease). Morphologically similar glomerular lesions e.g. autoimmune-glomerulonephritis, immune-complex-glomerulonephritis or IgA-nephropathy can be characterized according to their underlying immunopathogenesis. Since immunopathological lesions may occur at a time when histologically no or only minimal lesions are evident, as e.g. in perimembranous glomerulonephritis or in early stages of lupus nephritis immunohistological examinations should be performed as early as possible. Later in the course of glomerulonephritis secondary phenomena like nonspecific insudations of immunoglobulins or complement factors make interpretations difficult. Besides the definition of immunopathogenesis immunohistological examinations may lead to answer etiological and therefore therapeutical questions by the detection of antigens within immune complexes."
CD010502,0,7024311,0,Cellular immune responses to extracellular streptococcal products in rheumatic heart disease.,"The lymphocyte transformation responses to purified preparations of two extracellular products of group A streptococci (blastogen A and nuclease B), to phytohemagglutinin, and to Candida albicans antigen were measured in tonsillar and peripheral blood lymphocytes from patients with rheumatic heart disease (RHD) and suitably matched nonrheumatic (control) subjects. The mean phytohemagglutinin dose responses of tonsillar and peripheral lymphocytes from RHD patients were essentially indistinguishable from those of controls. In contrast, the responses of tonsillar and peripheral blood lymphocytes to the two extracellular products of group A streptococci were significantly lower in RHD patients than in nonrheumatic control subjects. Candida antigen produced very little stimulation of lymphocytes in any of the subjects. The geometric means of antibody levels against streptolysin O, nuclease B, and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotidase showed no consistent differences between the control group and the group of RHD subjects. Group A streptococci were isolated from the tonsils of approximately 25% of both groups of subjects. The RHD patients clearly had a depressed cellular immune response to the two purified streptococcal extracellular antigens. The equal frequency in recovery of group A streptococci from tonsils and the absence of consistent difference in titers of humoral antibodies to streptococcal extracellular antigens, particularly nuclease B, suggest that this differential response is not due to a lower level of stimulation by repeated exposure to group A streptococcal products."
CD010502,0,8580905,0,Purification and characterization of M3 protein expressed on the surface of group A streptococcal type 3 strain C203.,"Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been produced by immunizing BALB/C mice with whole M+ bacteria in incomplete Freund adjuvant and the resulting mAbs for M3 protein have been selected by an indirect immuno-fluorescent technique using formaldehyde-fixed M+ and M- bacteria. Four mAbs reacted with a 65 kDa protein in an extract obtained from the cell wall of M+ bacteria after treatment with N-acetyl muramidase and lysozyme. The purified 65 kDa protein neutralized the phagocytic activity of rabbit anti-M3 antibody. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the 65 kDa protein was identical with that of protein generated by the M3 gene which has been previously cloned and sequenced. The evidence indicates that the 65 kDa protein is M3 protein. The M3 protein bound not only human fibrinogen but also human serum albumin (HSA). When the M3 protein was purified by gel-filtration and ion-exchange chromatography in the absence of phenylmethyl sulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), four fragments (35 kDa, 32 kDa, 30 kDa, and 25 kDa) in addition to the intact molecule appeared. N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis showed that 35 kDa and 25 kDa fragments were ANAAD and DARSV, respectively, being identical at positions 1-5 and 198-202 to the M3 gene derived protein. Therefore, the 35 kDa and 25 kDa fragments, which were presumed to be cleavage products, may be derived from the C-terminal part and N-terminal part of the intact molecule, respectively. When the effect of purified M3 protein in the bactericidal activity of normal human blood in the presence of M- bacteria was investigated, the M3 protein was responsible for the organism's resistance to attack by phagocytic cells."

CD010502,0,2660476,0,[Ecologic and epidemiologic features of the circulation of streptococcus group B at a maternity clinic].,"In a maternity clinic the circulation of group B streptococci among the newborns, their mothers and the personnel was established during the period of 1982-1985. Group B streptococci were detected at different biotypes of newborns (the pharynx, the imbilical stump, external suditory meatus, nasal and oral mucosa, eyes and feces), their mothers (the vagina, the perianal area, breast milk, the pharynx, urine, the umbilical cord, amniotic fluid) and in the pharynx of the personnel. In this maternity clinic 15 combinations of type antigens were detected, two combinations (1a/c and 1 b/c) prevailing among them. These results confirmed earlier data concerning two possible ways of transferring infection to newborn infants: vertical, i.e. from the mother to the child during parturition, and nosocomial, i.e. from contaminated newborns or members of the personnel."
CD010502,0,10648001,0,TNF-alpha release by monocytic THP-1 cells through cross-linking of the extended V-region of the oral streptococcal protein I/II.,"We tested the hypothesis of a conserved activation mode of monocytic THP-1 cells by proteins I/II expressed by several species of oral streptococci through the specific role of the extended V-region. We studied the binding and modulating activities of six proteins I/II purified from strains representing four different species of oral streptococci, and of expression products of polymerase chain reaction-amplified sequences encoding corresponding extended V-regions. We found that the different proteins I/II bound to THP-1 cells in a sugar-dependent mode involving the extended V-region. Furthermore, all the proteins I/II stimulated THP-1 cells to produce tumor necrosis factor alpha, indicating that these properties are not strain- or species-specific. Despite the weak stimulation of THP-1 cells by the extended V-region alone, we obtained evidence that cross-linking of this region can be one of the mechanisms involved in monocytic cell activation by proteins I/II."

The data indicate that the M5 and M18 proteins can confer resistance to phagocytosis, that fibrinogen is required for this resistance, and that these M proteins can mediate adhesion to HEp-2 cells."
CD010502,0,6985640,0,Studies on group A streptococcal M-proteins: purification of type 5 M-protein and comparison of its amino terminal sequence with two immunologically unrelated M-protein molecules.,"M-protein was isolated from group A, type 5, streptococci by limited proteolysis with pepsin and purified by chromatography on DEAE-Sephadex followed by gel filtration. The protein thus purified (Pep M5) was homogeneous by SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis (apparent m.w.: 19,000), retained the capacity to remove opsonic antibodies from type 5 antiserum, and was capable of eliciting opsonic antibodies in rabbits. Its amino acid composition was very similar to that reported for M-proteins from other streptococcal types. The sequence of the first 29 amino terminal residues of Pep M5 was determined and compared with the reported amino terminal sequences of two immunologically unrelated M-proteins, namely, Pep M6 and Pep M24. The results revealed that, although the amino terminal sequences fo these three proteins differed from each other, some amino acid residues appeared to be conserved, suggesting a certain degree of structural relatedness among these M molecules. The possibility that this feature forms the molecular basis for the common antiphagocytic behavior of immunologically unrelated M-proteins is discussed."

CD010502,0,16126952,0,Rheumatic fever: how S. pyogenes-primed peripheral T cells trigger heart valve lesions.,"The pathogenesis of rheumatic fever (RF) is related to autoimmune humoral and cellular responses against human tissues triggered by Streptococcus pyogenes. CD4(+) T cells are the ultimate effectors of chronic heart lesions in rheumatic heart disease (RHD). Heart-infiltrating CD4(+) T cell clones are able to recognize heart tissue and streptococcal antigens by molecular mimicry. The streptococcal M5(81-103) region, an immunodominant region, was recognized by both intralesional and peripheral T cell clones (62% and 38%, respectively). Peripheral T lymphocytes from Brazilian patients with severe RHD preferentially recognized the M5(81-96) peptide, in the context of HLA-DR7(+) and DR53(+) molecules. HLA-DR7 seems to be related to the development of multiple valvular lesions in RHD patients from different countries. In addition, the fact that peripheral and intralesional T cells recognized the M5(81-103) region points to this region as one of the streptococcal triggers of autoimmune reactions in RHD. T cell repertoire analysis from peripheral and intralesional T cell lines derived from RHD patients showed several oligoclonal expansions of BV families. Major expansions were found in the heart lesions, suggesting that such T cell populations preferentially migrate from the periphery to the heart. Some cross-reactive intralesional T cell clones displayed the same T cell receptor (TCR) BVBJ and CDR3 sequences, showing a degenerate pattern of antigen recognition. Heart tissue-infiltrating cells from myocardium and valvular tissue produced TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL-10, and IL-4, whereas few cells from valvular tissue produced IL-4, showing that the lack of regulation in the valves could be responsible for the permanent and progressive valvular lesions."
CD010502,0,15727397,0,Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis in children.,"Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS) is the most common bacterial cause of acute pharyngitis in children. Because clinical findings can be nonspecific, even experienced physicians cannot reliably diagnose GABHS pharyngitis solely on the basis of clinical presentation. Suspected cases should be confirmed by a throat culture or a rapid antigen detection test before antibiotic therapy is initiated. Microbiologic testing is generally not necessary in patients with pharyngitis whose clinical and epidemiologic findings are not suggestive of GABHS. Clinical score systems have been developed to help physicians decide which patients should undergo diagnostic testing and to reduce the unnecessary use of antibiotics. Antibiotic therapy should be initiated as soon as the diagnosis is confirmed. Penicillin V remains the drug of choice. Alternative therapy, e.g., with cephalosporin or macrolide, is often sought because of penicillin allergy, noncompliance, and treatment failure."
CD010502,0,3701832,0,A new scheme for serotyping group-G streptococci.,"Ten antisera, prepared against nine selected strains of group-G streptococci and a strain of group-A streptococci of M-type 12, were used to serotype 102 isolates of group-G streptococci by means of precipitation reactions between the sera and hot-acid extracts of the streptococci. Fifty-six (54.9%) of the streptococci could be typed; eight serotypes were identified, of which type VIII was the most common (18.6%). The M12 and the R28 antigens, previously recorded in group-G streptococci, were not detected. The type antigens were trypsin sensitive and resembled the M antigens of group-A streptococci."
CD010502,0,7959039,0,Characterization and distribution of insertion sequence IS1239 in Streptococcus pyogenes.,"The human pathogenic bacterium Streptococcus pyogenes causes pharyngitis, acute rheumatic fever, glomerulonephritis and toxic-shock-like syndrome. The bacterium synthesizes several extracellular products, including the recently described streptococcal superantigen SSA, a molecule that shares considerable homology with several Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxins. While studying allelic variation at the ssa locus, six isolates expressing serotypes M4, M23, M33, M41, M43, and provisional type PT4854, were identified that had PCR products about 40-bp larger than expected, and one isolate (M15) had an amplified fragment that was more than 1-kb larger than expected. All six isolates have a 34-bp insert located 103 bp 5' of the ssa start codon. The larger product is a result of a 1110-bp insertion at the analogous location. The complementary strand of this insert has a 981-bp open reading frame that potentially encodes a 326-amino-acid polypeptide with substantial homology to the Escherichia coli IS30 transposase. Results of Southern blot analysis showed that at least twelve copies of the sequence are present in the serotype M15 S. pyogenes isolate. This element, designated IS1239, is the first simple insertion sequence described in group-A streptococci. Results of PCR screening showed that 26 of 78 (33%) S. pyogenes isolates expressing distinct M protein serotypes contained sequences with homology to IS1239, which means that the element is widely distributed in the species."
CD010502,0,3324026,0,Immunohistochemical localisation of neuron-binding antibodies in rheumatic heart disease.,"Neuron-binding antibodies and heart-reactive antibodies (HRA) have been investigated in the sera of patients with acute rheumatic fever (ARF) and chronic valvular rheumatic heart disease (both active and inactive by means of immunoperoxidase technique. The incidence of neuron-binding antibodies was highest in ARF (61.1%) in comparison with 54.2% in active chronic valvular disease with activity and 21.1% in inactive chronic valvular disease. In active chronic valvular disease the labelling of neurons was commoner than labelling of myofibres (p less than 0.01). In the other two groups (ARF and inactive chronic valvular disease) no difference in staining of neurons and myofibres was observed. Morphological localisation of binding sites of antibodies in the caudate nucleus neurons showed a definite pattern, which varied from a peripheral crescentic to a diffuse staining within the neuronal cytoplasm, often extending into the dendritic processes. Antibodies binding to caudate nucleus neurons were significantly commoner in ARF and active chronic valvular disease than in inactive chronic valvular disease (p less than 0.05)."
CD010502,0,3304089,0,Secretory IgA and serum type IgA in nasal secretion and antibody activity against the M protein.,"We studied IgA immunoglobulins in nasal secretions in order to clarify mucosal immunity of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses during chronic nasal infection. Secretory IgA and serum type IgA of 165 samples of nasal secretions were analyzed quantitatively by use of electroimmunodiffusion techniques, and the specific antibody activity of secretory IgA against the M protein of Streptococcus pyogenes was investigated by use of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results show that although the secretory IgA content in nasal secretions was elevated in chronic sinusitis, its specific antibody activity against the M protein was lower than that in normal subjects. This evidence suggests that nonspecific secretory IgA antibodies are predominantly produced in chronic sinusitis, and that mucosal immunity preventing the adherence of bacteria is impaired in the diseased mucosa."
CD010502,0,6392320,0,Detection of group B streptococcal antigen in body fluids by a latex-coupled monoclonal antibody assay.,"A commercially available latex agglutination reagent, Directigen (Hynson, Westcott & Dunning, Div. Becton Dickinson & Co., Baltimore, Md.), in which a murine monoclonal antibody to group B streptococcal (GBS) antigen is the active component, was evaluated by using body fluid specimens from 94 sick infants. Antigen was detected in one or more admission specimens from 18 of 19 (94.7%) infants with symptomatic GBS infection. In 15 patients with GBS meningitis, cerebrospinal fluid, serum, and 10-fold-concentrated urine specimens were positive in 87, 50, and 100%, respectively. GBS antigen was detected in 50% of unconcentrated urines, but in no sera from infants with nonmeningitic GBS sepsis. Among specimens from 27 infants with invasive infection due to organisms other than GBS and from 48 culture-negative sick infants, false-positive latex agglutination reactions occurred in only 4 (9.5%) urine specimens and in no cerebrospinal fluid or serum specimens. The 94.7% sensitivity and specificity of the Directigen GBS test indicate that it is a useful reagent for the rapid diagnosis of invasive GBS infection in young infants."

Although very severe diseases such as streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS) were observed, a general increase in invasive infections was not found. Isolates of GAS were classified by M protein genotyping (emm typing) and analysed according to their origin from invasive and non-invasive infections. The predominant emm types were types 1, 4 and 12, followed by types 3, 6 and 28. During the study period the proportion of isolates of types 1 and 12 fell, while other types (3, 6, 22, 28 and 77) appeared. Isolates from invasive and non-invasive infections shared several emm types; however, most invasive strains belonged to five types only (types 1, 4, 12, 28 and 77), while non-invasive isolates were generally more heterogeneous."
CD010502,0,2642529,0,Evidence for two distinct classes of streptococcal M protein and their relationship to rheumatic fever.,"The antigenic relatedness of surface-exposed portions of M protein molecules derived from group A streptococcal isolates representing more than 50 distinct serotypes was examined. The data indicate that the majority of serotypes fall into two major classes. Class I M protein molecules share a surface-exposed, antigenic domain comprising the C repeat region defined for M6 protein. The C repeat region of M6 protein is located adjacent to the COOH-terminal side of the pepsin-susceptible site. In contrast, Class I M proteins display considerably less antigenic relatedness to the B repeat region of M6 protein, which lies immediately NH2-terminal to the pepsin site. Surface-exposed portions of Class II M proteins lack antigenic epitopes that define the Class I molecules. Studies in the 1970s demonstrated that M protein serotypes can be divided into two groups based on both immunoreactivity directed to an unknown surface antigen (termed M-associated protein) and production of serum opacity factor. These two groups closely parallel our current definition of Class I and Class II serotypes. Both classes retain the antiphagocytic property characteristic of M protein, and Class II M proteins share some immunodeterminants with Class I M proteins, although the shared determinants do not appear to be exposed on the streptococcal surface. Nearly all streptococcal serotypes associated with outbreaks of acute rheumatic fever express M protein of a Class I serotype. Thus, the surface-exposed, conserved C repeat domain of Class I serotypes may be a virulence determinant for rheumatic fever."
CD010502,0,15465260,0,[Evaluation of Prolex for the rapid identification of streptococci isolated in medical microbiology].,"The need to rapidly identify streptococci responsible for acute infectious diseases has led to the development of agglutination techniques that are able to identify streptococcal group antigens (A, B, C, D, F, and G) directly from primoculture colonies on blood agar. The Prolex agglutination tests (Pro-Lab Diagnostics, Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada), distributed in France by i2a, have been used for the determination of group antigens of 166 isolates of streptococci and enterococci previously identified in the National Reference Center for Streptococci. The results obtained with the Prolex reagents have permitted to correctly identify all pyogenic beta-hemolytic streptococci (23 Streptococcus pyogenes, 21 Streptococcus agalactiae, 33 Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis including 6 group C and 27 group G, and 5 Streptococcus porcinus including 4 group B). Four differences between unexpected agglutinations (A or F) and species identifications have been obtained. These differences were observed for four non-hemolytic isolates of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus infantarius, and Streptococcus suis. The anti-D reagent has been of value as a marker for isolates of enterococci. Thus, these results confirm the abilities of these agglutination tests for the grouping of beta-hemolytic streptococci. Moreover, the use of Prolex has the advantage to be rapid because of the non-enzymatic but chemical extraction of streptococcal antigens."
CD010502,0,3553232,0,High levels of antibodies to streptococcal cell membrane antigens specifically bound to monoclonal antibodies in acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis.,"We produced 15 immunoglobulin G class monoclonal antibodies against antigens of the streptococcal cell membrane (SCM) of Streptococcus pyogenes (T type 12, Tanaka strain) and determined the levels in human sera of antibodies against Triton-X-extracted antigens specifically bound to each of these 15 monoclonal antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Sample sera were obtained from 10 normal controls (group 1), 10 patients with streptococcal pharyngitis without sequelae (group 2), and 8 patients with acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (APSGN) (group 3). Anti-streptolysin O (ASO) titers of the sera increased in the order of groups 1, 2, and 3. There was no relationship between ASO titer and the level of anti-SCM antibodies, and there was no significant difference in the level of anti-SCM antibodies determined with each of the 15 monoclonal antibodies between group 1 and group 2 sera. Group 3 sera had higher levels of antibodies to SCM antigens specifically bound to each of 14 of these 15 monoclonal antibodies than group 1 or group 2 sera did. Of these 14 monoclonal antibodies, 9 reacted with the four SCM antigens separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrophoretically transferred to a nitrocellulose sheet. These results suggest that high levels of antibodies to SCM antigens are related to the development of APSGN and that the systemic immune response to SCM antigens is involved in the pathogenesis of APSGN."

CD010502,0,1965005,0,Conjugative mobilization of the cloned M6 protein gene from Streptococcus pneumoniae to Streptococcus pyogenes.,"The host-vector system omega 6001-pDP36 was used to transfer the M6 protein gene (emm-6.1) of Streptococcus pyogenes to other S. pyogenes strains, isogenic and nonisogenic to D471, the strain from which emm-6.1 was originally cloned. The first step was to subclone emm-6.1 into the insertion vector pDP36. The resulting plasmid, pRMB20, was used as donor in transformation to insert emm-6.1 into the conjugative transposon omega 6001. Streptococcus pneumoniae DP1322, carrying omega 6001 integrated into the chromosome, was the recipient in the transformation experiment. omega 6001 containing emm-6.1 was then transferred by conjugation from S. pneumoniae to the chromosomes of M+ and M- S. pyogenes strains. S. pyogenes transconjugants contained one intact copy of emm-6.1 integrated into the chromosome, but no expression of M6 protein could be detected by Western blot analysis. We found no evidence of the positive transacting regulation of emm gene expression postulated by other authors. In fact, the cloned emm-6.1 was not expressed in three strains expressing their own M proteins (M5, M17 and a shorter M6). In these partial diploids M protein genes were expressed only when present in the original chromosomal locus."

An identity of 92 to 93% was observed in the flaA sequences of the different species. Polyhistidine-tagged recombinant FlaA (rFlaA) proteins were produced in Escherichia coli and used as antigens in Western blotting (WB) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In immunoglobulin G (IgG) WB, 71% (10 of 14) of the sera from neuroborreliosis and 86% (12 of 14) of those from Lyme arthritis patients reacted with one to three rFlaAs. In IgG ELISA, 74% (14 of 19) and 79% (15 of 19) of patients with neuroborreliosis and arthritis, respectively, were positive. The immunoreactivity in local European patient sera was stronger against rFlaA from B. garinii and B. afzelii than against rFlaA from B. burgdorferi sensu stricto. Neither IgG nor IgM ELISA was sensitive in the serodiagnosis of erythema migrans. Serum samples from patients with syphilis and systemic lupus erythematosus showed mild cross-reactivity in IgG tests. Sera from Yersinia enterocolitica or beta-hemolytic Streptococcus infections showed only occasional responses. With IgM ELISA, 58% (11 of 19) and 37% (7 of 19) of patients with neuroborreliosis and arthritis, respectively, were positive. Cross-reactive antibodies to FlaA, especially in serum samples from patients with rheumatoid factor positivity and Epstein-Barr virus infection, reduced the specificity of IgM serodiagnosis. Therefore, rFlaA seems to have a limited role for IgM serodiagnosis, yet rFlaA might be useful in the IgG serodiagnosis of disseminated Lyme borreliosis."
CD010502,0,20655859,0,NMR backbone dynamics of VEK-30 bound to the human plasminogen kringle 2 domain.,"To gain insights into the mechanisms for the tight and highly specific interaction of the kringle 2 domain of human plasminogen (K2(Pg)) with a 30-residue internal peptide (VEK-30) from a group A streptococcal M-like protein, the dynamic properties of free and bound K2(Pg) and VEK-30 were investigated using backbone amide (15)N-NMR relaxation measurements. Dynamic parameters, namely the generalized order parameter, S(2), the local correlation time, tau(e), and the conformational exchange contribution, R(ex), were obtained for this complex by Lipari-Szabo model-free analysis. The results show that VEK-30 displays distinctly different dynamic behavior as a consequence of binding to K2(Pg), manifest by decreased backbone flexibility, particularly at the binding region of the peptide. In contrast, the backbone dynamics parameters of K2(Pg) displayed similar patterns in the free and bound forms, but, nonetheless, showed interesting differences. Based on our previous structure-function studies of this interaction, we also made comparisons of the VEK-30/K2(Pg) dynamics results from different kringle modules complexed with small lysine analogs. The differences in dynamics observed for kringles with different ligands provide what we believe to be new insights into the interactions responsible for protein-ligand recognition and a better understanding of the differences in binding affinity and binding specificity of kringle domains with various ligands."
CD010502,0,12496168,0,Cleavage of antigen-bound immunoglobulin G by SpeB contributes to streptococcal persistence in opsonizing blood.,"Group A streptococci (GAS) express a superantigen, SpeB, having cysteine protease activity. SpeB exhibits several properties that might contribute to virulence, the most recently discovered being the ability to cleave immunoglobulin G (IgG) in a manner similar to that of papain. In the present study, we confirmed this latter finding and found that the irreversible inhibition of SpeB protease activity completely abolishes IgG cleavage. SpeB cleavage of IgG was not species restricted since SpeB cleaved both human, rabbit, and mouse IgG. In order to investigate the nature of the SpeB cleavage of IgG, antibodies were immobilized prior to exposure to SpeB, either by unspecific binding of the Fc to GAS surface proteins or by antigen-specific binding. Analysis of the IgG molecules by SDS-PAGE showed that SpeB could cleave antigen-bound antibodies, while the IgG bound to IgG-binding proteins was protected from cleavage. In a phagocytosis assay using whole blood, the M49 GAS strain NZ131 showed a significantly higher survival than its isogenic speB mutant. Furthermore, the addition of extracellular supernatant derived from an overnight culture of native NZ131 increased the survival of its isogenic speB derivative. This indicates that SpeB's ability to cleave off the Fc part of antigen-bound IgG contributes to GAS escape from opsonophagocytosis while not interfering with the formation of a host-like coat by unspecific IgG binding."

Therefore, the need to identify innovative approaches for development of novel anti-infectives and new therapeutic targets is of high priority in global health care. The detection of small RNAs (sRNAs) in bacteria has attracted considerable attention as an emerging class of new gene expression regulators. Several experimental technologies to predict sRNA have been established for the Gram-negative model organism Escherichia coli. In many respects, sRNA screens in this model system have set a blueprint for the global and functional identification of sRNAs for Gram-positive microbes, but the functional role of sRNAs in colonization and pathogenicity for Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis and Clostridium difficile is almost completely unknown. Here, we report the current knowledge about the sRNAs of these socioeconomically relevant Gram-positive pathogens, overview the state-of-the-art high-throughput sRNA screening methods and summarize bioinformatics approaches for genome-wide sRNA identification and target prediction. Finally, we discuss the use of modified peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) as a novel tool to inactivate potential sRNA and their applications in rapid and specific detection of pathogenic bacteria."
CD010502,0,8039929,0,Streptococcus pyogenes type M12 protein shows selective binding to some human immunoglobulin G3 myeloma proteins.,"Purified, recombinant M12 protein from Streptococcus pyogenes CS24 has recently been demonstrated to bind human immunoglobulin G3 (IgG3). The binding site for IgG has been localized to an internal peptide encoded by a PvuII fragment of the gene emm12. We have investigated the ability of an isolated recombinant M12 protein consisting of the peptide encoded by the PvuII fragment to bind various monoclonal human IgG3 myeloma proteins representing a number of both Caucasian and Oriental IgG3 Gm(allotypic) phenotypes. Of nine Caucasian IgG3 myeloma proteins, only two bound strongly to the recombinant M12 protein in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The allotypic phenotypes of the reactive proteins were IgG3m(b+)(g-) and IgG3m(b-)(g+). No binding was seen for seven IgG3 myeloma proteins of Oriental origin with G3m(st+)(u-)(b+)(g-), G3m(st-)(u+)(b+)(g-), G3m(st-)(u+)(b-)(g+), and G3m(st-)(u-)(b-)(g+) phenotypes. The binding of human IgG3 to M12 protein seems to be related to features other than its Gm allotypic markers. Selective reactivity of IgG3 myeloma proteins with M12 protein may provide another way to subclassify human IgG3 molecules. The biological significance of the selective reactivity is not known."
CD010502,0,7741176,0,Serologic evidence of respiratory and rickettsial infections among Somali refugees.,"Somali refugees living in a camp located in Djibouti were studied in October 1991 and May 1992. The refugees had been living at the camp for about two years. The median age of volunteers was 25 years, of whom 69% were female. Paired sera obtained seven months apart were evaluated by complement fixation, microimmunofluorescence, indirect fluorescent antibody, streptococcal antibody, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay techniques for evidence of pathogen infection. Fifty-two percent, 31.3%, 8.0%, 5.9%, and 25.4% of the volunteers had serologic evidence for pre-enrollment infection with Chlamydia pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Rickettsia typhi, R. conorii, and Coxiella burnetti, respectively. Similarly, 43.5%, 5.2%, 6.1%, 10.7%, 15.8%, and 11.9% of the volunteers studied had serologic evidence for new infection with Streptococcus pyogenes, C. pneumoniae, M. pneumoniae, R. typhi, R. conorii, and Cox. burnetii, respectively. These data suggest that the studied pathogens may be endemic in displaced populations living in the Horn of Africa."

Her knee pain and redness increased. She was diagnosed with acute osteomyelitis and subperiosteal abscess based on MRI. We started intravenous antibiotics and punctured and drained the abscess. S. pyogenes was isolated from blood and puncture pus culture and a rapid group A beta hemolytic Streptococcal antigen test was positive in a throat swab. After 10 days' drainage and 28 days' antibiotics treatment, she was discharged. Viral superinfections aggravate S. pyogenes infection both in animal models and human cases. This case gives futher evidence that superinfectious influenza A virus is a risk factor for severe S. pyogenes infection."
CD010502,0,3899945,0,Evaluation of a rapid latex agglutination test (Directigen) for the direct detection of group A streptococci from throat swabs.,"A rapid group A beta-hemolytic streptococci (GAS) antigen detection test using latex agglutination (Directigen, Becton Dickinson) was compared with a conventional culture method for the direct detection of GAS from throat swabs. One throat specimen was collected from each of 229 patients. After standard inoculation onto sheep blood agar plates, all swabs were tested for GAS antigen. Of the 229 specimens tested, 46 (20%) were GAS-positive by culture. Direct latex agglutination agreed with culture in 222 of them (97%). The sensitivity of the test was 93% (43/46), the specificity 98% (179/183), the positive predictive value 91%, and the negative predictive value 98%. The detection of GAS antigen by coagglutination (Phadebact, Pharmacia) was also carried out. 81% (35/43) of the cultures and Directigen-positive specimens gave a positive coagglutination for GAS. 100% (179/179) of the cultures and Directigen-negative specimens were also negative by the coagglutination test. We conclude that the Directigen rapid latex agglutination test for the direct detection of GAS from throat swabs compares favorably with culture and has the advantage of providing same-day results."
CD010502,0,12454137,0,M types of group a streptococcal isolates submitted to the National Centre for Streptococcus (Canada) from 1993 to 1999.,"The National Centre for Streptococcus (NCS) (Canada) determined the group A streptococcal (GAS) M types of 4,760 Canadian isolates submitted between 1993 and 1999 by classic serotyping. The 10 most frequently identified M types were M1 (26.4%), M12 (9.8%), M28 (8.9%), M3 (6.8%), M4 (6.2%), M11 (4.8%), M89 (3.1%), M6 (3.0%), M2 (2.6%), and M77 (1.9%). Nontypeable isolates accounted for 15.4% of the collection. The province of Ontario submitted 51.1% of the isolates, followed by Quebec (21.2%) and Alberta (13.9%). Together, these three provinces constituted 71.3% of the Canadian population in 1996. The numbers of M types M1, M12, M28, and M3 occurred most frequently in subjects whose ages were <1 to 15 years and 25 to 45 years, as well as in the elderly (60 to 90 years). Further analysis found that the four most frequently identified M types from blood, brain, and cerebrospinal fluid were M1 (28.2%), M28 (9.2%), M12 (9.1%), and M3 (8.2%), with 13.4% of isolates being nontypeable. The four isolates from throats most frequently identified were M1 (19.5%), M12 (15.3%), M3 (8.6%), and M28 (5%) with 19.4% of isolates being nontypeable. The sic gene of a subset of M1 strains (9.5% of the M1 collection) was sequenced. Of 36 sic types identified, the four most common were sic1.01 (22.8%), sic1.02 (14.9%), sic1.135 (10.5%), and sic1.178 (9.6%). Together these four sic types further characterized nearly 60% of the M1 strains sequenced. In summary, from the years 1993 to 1999, the NCS detected 54 M types, of which 10 different M types constituted 73.5% of the collection. M1 was the most common GAS M type circulating in the Canadian population, responsible for more than a quarter of the isolates typed. The most common throat isolates differed in M-type and proportion from those of invasive isolates. Sequencing the sic gene further characterized the most common M-type serotype 1 in a fashion that may be useful for epidemiologic investigations."
CD010502,0,10932715,0,Prevention of nonspecific reactions on reversed passive latex agglutination assay (RPLA) for detecting low amounts of staphylococcal enterotoxins.,"The SET-RPLA, from Denka Seiken Co. Ltd., Tokio, a commercial reversed passive latex agglutination test kit, has been recommended to establish the enterotoxicity capacity of some staphylococcal strains, implicated in food poisoning outbreaks that produce low levels of enterotoxins (SE). Despite the RPLA specificity, the occurrence of nonspecific reactions when testing low-SE-producing is common. In order to control these nonspecific reactions the addition of purified normal rabbit IgG purified was applied on approximately 350 staphylococcal isolates from human milk and anatomic sites of healthy dental student carriers. The results indicated that addition of 5% (v/v) of purified normal rabbit IgG (0.74 mg/mL) to the culture supernatant fluid is a simple and reliable tool for the controlling of nonspecific reactions in the RPLA assay."

A case report.,"Cicatricial pemphigoid (CP) is a chronic subepidermal bullous dermatosis which primarily involves the mucous membranes. The oral cavity and the eye are most frequently involved. Since extension of the lesion into the pharynx and esophagus causes sore throat and dysphagia and progressive ocular lesions may cause blindness, early and valid diagnosis is very important. Here we present a case of cicatricial pemphigoid with onset at age 45 in a patient who manifested severe periodontal disease and showed the lesion on the mucous membranes of the mouth (desquamative gingivitis), skin, and eyes. Since definite diagnosis is very important, we describe how we made a differential diagnosis from other diseases which also accompany desquamative gingivitis. We examined the clinical manifestations, blood test results, HLA-genotype, histopathologic findings of the affected tissue, and immunological findings in relation to autoimmunity. Since many of the CP cases are first referred to periodontists or dentists, we believe that the diagnostic strategy described in the present study will be quite informative for making rapid and definite diagnoses of similar cases."

CD010502,0,21707691,0,Similar superantigen gene profiles and superantigen activity in norwegian isolates of invasive and non-invasive group a streptococci.,"Group A streptococcus (GAS) harbours several virulence factors, including M protein (coded by the emm gene) and superantigens (SAgs). SAgs are extracellular toxins that directly activate the immune system by cross-binding to the HLA class II molecule and T cell receptor (TCR), thereby causing activation of up to 30% of the T cells and subsequent massive secretion of cytokines. Forty-eight GAS strains isolated from patients at Norwegian hospitals between 1988 and 2004 were included in this study. Of these, 24 were invasive streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS) or necrotizing fasciitis (NF) isolates and 24 were non-invasive pharyngitis isolates, matched for having the same T-type and year of isolation as the invasive isolates. The isolates were characterized by emm sequence typing, multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and SAg gene profiles. A correlation between T-type, emm type, sequence type and SAg gene profile was revealed. No difference between invasive and non-invasive isolates regarding serotype or genotype was demonstrated. Selected invasive and non-invasive isolates with identical SAg gene profiles were analysed for SAg activity in bacterial growth culture media with and without human cell culture media added. A human T cell proliferation assay was used as measurement for SAg activity and simultaneously we also measured the cytokine content in normal human peripheral blood leucocyte cell culture media. The results revealed that invasive and non-invasive isolates did not differ significantly in SAg activity as it is present in semipurified bacterial culture medium."
CD010502,0,19275067,0,Diagnosis and treatment of streptococcal pharyngitis.,"Common signs and symptoms of streptococcal pharyngitis include sore throat, temperature greater than 100.4 degrees F (38 degrees C), tonsillar exudates, and cervical adenopathy. Cough, coryza, and diarrhea are more common with viral pharyngitis. Available diagnostic tests include throat culture and rapid antigen detection testing. Throat culture is considered the diagnostic standard, although the sensitivity and specificity of rapid antigen detection testing have improved significantly. The modified Centor score can be used to help physicians decide which patients need no testing, throat culture/rapid antigen detection testing, or empiric antibiotic therapy. Penicillin (10 days of oral therapy or one injection of intramuscular benzathine penicillin) is the treatment of choice because of cost, narrow spectrum of activity, and effectiveness. Amoxicillin is equally effective and more palatable. Erythromycin and first-generation cephalosporins are options in patients with penicillin allergy. Increased group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS) treatment failure with penicillin has been reported. Although current guidelines recommend first-generation cephalosporins for persons with penicillin allergy, some advocate the use of cephalosporins in all nonallergic patients because of better GABHS eradication and effectiveness against chronic GABHS carriage. Chronic GABHS colonization is common despite appropriate use of antibiotic therapy. Chronic carriers are at low risk of transmitting disease or developing invasive GABHS infections, and there is generally no need to treat carriers. Whether tonsillectomy or adenoidectomy decreases the incidence of GABHS pharyngitis is poorly understood. At this time, the benefits are too small to outweigh the associated costs and surgical risks."
CD010502,0,12030021,0,[M protein gene (emm) typing of Streptococcus pyogenes].,"T-agglutination typing and M protein gene (emm) typing were determined on the isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes taken from patients in Osaka and neighboring districts during 1996-2000. A total of 701 isolates were classified to 15 kinds of T types and type untypable. In all isolates, T 12 was revealed as the most dominant serotype, followed by T1, T4 and T2. The isolation rates of T 12 strains were high through these five years, and these of T1 or T4 strains formed epidemic waves showing the peak to be from 1997 to 1999 and 1998 to 2000, respectively. These of T2 strains were high in 1996 and 1997 and decreased rapidly. In 2000 T2 strain has not been detected. A total of 304 isolates were examined for emm typing. We are able to determine the emm type of all isolates including T-untypable (UT) isolates and to classify 21 kinds of emm types. T1, T2, T4, T6, T9, T11, T12, T22, T25 strains exhibited one T-type and emm type pattern association respectively such as T1/emm1, T2/emm2, T4/emm4, T6/emm6, T9/emm9, T11/emm11, T12/emm12, T22/emm22, T25/emm75. Whereas T13 strains had varied T/emm pattern associations such as T13/emm73, T13/emm77, T13/emm101. Similarly, T28, TB3264, UT had varied T/emm pattern associations. emm28 and emm87 were seen in T28, emm89 and emm94 in TB3264, emm2, emm12, emm22, emm58, emm75, emm77 and emm112 in UT. The emm typing method did not require many kinds of M typing antisera, and were successful by using the two highly conserved primers to amplify the emm gene and direct sequencing. Therefore, this method was a useful tool for typing Streptococcus pyogenes isolates."

CD010502,0,8613352,0,Hyaluronate capsule and surface M protein in resistance to opsonization of group A streptococci.,"The major virulence determinant of group A streptococci is the ability to resist opsonization and phagocytic ingestion. The present studies were performed to compare the mechanisms of resistance to opsonization of type 18 and type 24 streptococci and to determine the relative roles of M protein-fibrinogen interaction and the hyaluronate capsule in preventing phagocytic ingestion and killing. By use of parent strains and acapsular transposon mutants in the presence and absence of fibrinogen, we show that type 18 and type 24 streptococci rely on somewhat different mechanisms for resistance to opsonization. Type 24 streptococci bound fibrinogen avidly to their surfaces, and encapsulated organisms were completely resistant to opsonization only in the presence of fibrinogen. In contrast, type 18 streptococci bound 10-fold less fibrinogen than type 24 streptococci and were fully resistant to phagocytosis only when they expressed capsule. The general structural characteristics of the amino-terminal halves of type 18 and type 24 M proteins differed in that type 18 M protein contained only one complete B repeat, whereas type 24 M protein contained five complete B repeats, a structural difference which could potentially be related to the differences in fibrinogen binding between the two serotypes. Immunofluorescence assays of complement deposition were used in combination with 125I-C3 binding assays to show that encapsulated type 24 streptococci were fully resistant to opsonization by C3 only in the presence of plasma. Encapsulated and unencapsulated type 18 streptococci were equally opsonized by C3 in either plasma or serum, yet only encapsulated organisms resisted phagocytic killing in blood. The results of this study indicate that opsonization by C3 does not necessarily lead to phagocytic ingestion and that the hyaluronate capsule and M proteins are variably important in resistance to different group A streptococci to opsonization and phagocytic killing."

This study was designed to determine the expression of inflammatory cytokines in children by the severity of Streptococcus pyogenes (group A Streptococcus [GAS]) infections. The study population consisted of 16 invasive, 20 noninvasive, and 24 pharyngeal colonization, and 21 healthy controls. All children underwent the laboratory tests and cytokine measurement. GAS isolates were analyzed for emm gene typing. Patients with invasive GAS diseases had significantly higher interferon (IFN)-gamma, interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and IL-18 than those with noninvasive diseases, colonization, and healthy controls. There was no difference in tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, IL-12, and IL-2 levels among the groups. Elevated white blood cell counts and levels of C-reactive protein and C3 were detected only in patients with invasive diseases. emm1 and emm12 predominated in invasive disease and colonization. Children with invasive GAS infections exhibited significant up-regulation of plasma levels of IFN-gamma, IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and IL-18, and suppression of TNF-alpha and IL-12 during the acute phase of their illness. An exuberant cytokine response was associated with the severity of illness."
CD010502,0,12443847,0,CD4+ T-cells from peripheral blood of a patient with psoriasis recognize keratin 14 peptide but not 'homologous' streptococcal M-protein epitope.,"Psoriasis has been recognized as an immunologically mediated inflammatory skin disease that has been associated with group A, beta-haemolytic streptococcal infections. Notably cross-reactive autoimmune mechanism, which is mediated by T cells reacting to epitopes that are common to streptococcal M-protein and keratin, has been proposed in psoriasis. In order to investigate this possibility, peptides corresponding to M-protein and human epidermal keratin, which share some amino acid sequence between them, were synthesized and tested for their ability to stimulate T-cells of patients with psoriasis. Among five cases examined, we isolated a CD4(+) T-cell line that recognized the type I keratin (K14)(p168-181) when it was presented by the patient's HLA-DR molecules from a single psoriatic patient, whose MHC allele was HLA-A2/A26, -B27/B16, -DR4/DR8, -DQ8. Further analysis disclosed that the critical peptide recognized by the T-cell line was 10-mer keratin(p171-180) (DLRNKILTAT). However, corresponding M6 protein with homology to K14 did not stimulate the T-cell response and no evidence for cross-reactivity was obtained. The K14-responsive T cell line produced IFN-gamma, but little IL-4 when stimulated with irradiated autologous PBMC pulsed with this peptide. Thus, the finding that human epidermal keratin peptide is immunogenic in a psoriasis patient may provide the evidence that T lymphocytes play an important role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis as an autoimmune disorder participated with Th1 like cells. However, the keratin-responsive T cell line was detected in only one of five cases of psoriasis examined, suggesting that such T cell line appears to be not so popular in psoriatic patients. No evidence for cross-reactivity to streptococcal M protein also suggests that the contribution of streptococci may simply be inducing proliferation of various repertoire of T cells (including K14-responsive T cells) possibly through a superantigen-dependent process."
CD010502,0,1573935,0,[TWAR infection is a common diagnosis in outpatient clinics].,"Infections caused by Chlamydia pneumoniae were first described in 1985.

Examination can indicate serous otitis media, sinusitis, laryngitis, bronchitis and pneumonia. The course can be long and relapsing. The recommended drugs for treatment are tetracycline or erythromycin for at least two weeks. Five verified cases are described in the article, four of them with symptoms from the upper respiratory tract only. It is concluded that Chlamydia pneumoniae is a not unusual cause of upper airway diseases. Up to now the diagnosis can best be verified by micro immunofluorescence. The authors call for a rapid and reliable test for use in physician's office. It is proposed that infections caused by Chlamydia pneumoniae be termed TWAR."
CD010502,0,15612147,0,Antibiotics for acute group A streptococcal pharyngitis.,"(1) Since the 1940s, a large number of comparative randomised placebo-controlled trials have evaluated antibiotic therapy for pharyngitis, initially parenteral benzathine benzylpenicillin, then oral phenoxymethylpenicillin (penicillin V). Our literature search identified a Cochrane meta-analysis of all these trials, with the exception of one published in 2003. (2) When group A betahemolytic streptococci (group A streptococci) are present in the throat, antibiotic therapy accelerates symptom relief (particularly fever and pain) by a day or two. This has been shown with 7-day treatments but not with 3-day treatments. There is no convincing evidence that antibiotics relieve symptoms in children. (3) According to the Cochrane meta-analysis, signs of progression to locoregional suppuration were noted in 1% of patients receiving placebo, compared to 0.09% of patients receiving antibiotics in the most recent trials (statistically significant difference). (4) Comparative trials done in the 1950s showed that benzathine benzylpenicillin helped prevent acute rheumatic fever, reducing the risk by about 75%. Since 1985 nearly 1000 patients with pharyngitis have been given a placebo in clinical trials, and none have developed acute rheumatic fever. (5) There is no firm evidence that antibiotics reduce the risk of acute glomerulonephritis. (6) The adverse effects associated with most antibiotics are mild. This is especially true for penicillin. However, there is a risk of rare but serious adverse effects: anaphylaxis is estimated to occur in 5 per 10 000 patients treated with injectable penicillin, while the risk associated with oral penicillin used to treat pharyngitis has not been quantified. Moreover, antibiotics affect the bacterial ecology, encouraging resistance among some bacterial species other than group A streptococci. (7) A strategy based on the use of a clinical diagnostic score, followed by a rapid test if the score is intermediate, seems to be the best way of restricting antibiotics to patients with pharyngitis due to group A streptococci. (8) In patients with group A streptococcal pharyngitis, a strategy of starting antibiotics only after 48 hours of symptoms delays symptom control but seems to reduce the risk of relapse. According to a clinical trial in patients with pharyngitis from all causes, advising patients to postpone antibiotic therapy reduces antibiotic use by about 85%, without increasing the risk of serious clinical complications. (9) In practice, immediate antibiotic therapy is justified for patients with severe symptoms or signs of progression to locoregional suppuration, and when the local incidence of acute rheumatic fever is high. In other situations, whether or not group A streptococci are involved, antibiotic therapy should be started only if symptoms do not begin to improve after 48 hours of symptomatic treatments."
CD010502,0,9573118,0,Opsonic antibodies to the surface M protein of group A streptococci in pooled normal immunoglobulins (IVIG): potential impact on the clinical efficacy of IVIG therapy for severe invasive group A streptococcal infections.,"The surface M protein of group A streptococci (GAS) is one of the major virulence factors for this pathogen. Antibodies to the M protein can facilitate opsonophagocytosis by phagocytic cells present in human blood. We investigated whether pooled normal immunoglobulin G (IVIG) contains antibodies that can opsonize and enhance the phagocytosis of type M1 strains of GAS and whether the levels of these antibodies vary for different IVIG preparations. We focused on the presence of anti-M1 antibodies because the M1T1 serotype accounts for the majority of recent invasive GAS clinical isolates in our surveillance studies. The level of anti-M1 antibodies in three commercial IVIG preparations was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and the opsonic activity of these antibodies was determined by neutrophil-mediated opsonophagocytosis of a representative M1T1 isolate. High levels of opsonic anti-M1 antibodies were found in all IVIG preparations tested, and there was a good correlation between ELISA titers and opsonophagocytic activity. However, there was no significant difference in the levels of opsonic anti-M1 antibodies among the various IVIG preparations or lots tested. Adsorption of IVIG with M1T1 bacteria removed the anti-M1 opsonic activity, while the level of anti-M3 opsonophagocytosis was unchanged. Plasma was obtained from seven patients with streptococcal toxic shock syndrome who received IVIG therapy, and the level of anti-M1 antibodies was assessed before and after IVIG administration. A significant increase in the level of type M1-specific antibodies was found in the plasma of all patients who received IVIG therapy (P < 0.006). The results reveal another potential mechanism by which IVIG can ameliorate severe invasive group A streptococcal infections."

They comprised 30 parents and 61 sibs (32 with rheumatic disease and 29 without). Fifty healthy unrelated subjects served as controls. A history was taken and clinical examination carried out. Rheumatic activity was determined and HLA typing was carried out for nine A antigens, 15 B antigens, and six DR antigens. The immune response of lymphocytes to streptococcal polysaccharide antigen of the cell wall of group A beta haemolytic streptococci in vitro was studied by tritiated thymidine uptake. The results were statistically and genetically analysed. It was found that (a) all subjects with rheumatic disease were highly responsive to the streptococcal polysaccharide antigen of the cell wall, the sib pairs being mostly HLA identical; (b) all low responders had no rheumatic disease and their phenotypes were mostly different from those of the rheumatic member of their sib pair; (c) correlation of immune responsiveness (high or low) between HLA-identical sibs was significant, but insignificant between haplotype identical and non-identical sibs; (d) the gene responsible for high responsiveness to the streptococcal polysaccharide antigen of the cell wall is recessive and closely linked to HLA. In conclusion, it was found that exposure to pharyngeal infection with group A beta haemolytic streptococci may lead to acute rheumatic fever in those with an inherited recessive gene responsible for high responsiveness to the streptococcal polysaccharide antigen of the cell wall."

CD010502,0,9514571,0,Binding of complement subcomponent C1q to Streptococcus pyogenes: evidence for interactions with the M5 and FcRA76 proteins.,"Binding of C1q, the first component of the complement system, to some human pathogens has been earlier reported. In the present study, direct binding of C1q to group A streptococci (GAS) of various serotypes as well as some other Gram-positive and Gram-negative species was demonstrated. The interaction between C1q and GAS was investigated more in detail. In hot neutral extracts of a number of GAS strains two components of 64 and 52 kDa, respectively, bound C1q; alkaline and SDS extracts yielded the 52 kDa component as the main C1q-binding substance. Trypsin treatment of the SDS extracts of two GAS strains suggested the C1q-binding component(s) to be of protein nature. C1q-binding material purified from the SDS extract of an avirulent strain, type T27, was separated in 12% SDS-PAGE and probed in Western blot with human C1q and fibrinogen, conjugated to horse radish peroxidase (HRP) as well as rabbit IgG antibodies complexed to HRP (PAP system). The 52 kDa component was non-reactive with fibrinogen or rabbit IgG. However, C1q-binding components purified from the alkaline extracts of two M-positive strains revealed strong binding of either fibrinogen (type M5) or both fibrinogen and rabbit IgG (type M76); the molecular mass of these components. 55 kDa and 43-40 kDa, respectively, was in agreement with the reported molecular mass of the M5 and FcRA76 proteins. Our findings suggest that C1q may interact with GAS through certain M-family proteins as well as by a so far unidentified surface factor of protein nature occurring in most GAS strains. The involvement of M-family proteins, regarded as virulence factors of these organisms, may suggest the interaction of GAS with C1q as biologically important."
CD010502,0,15845483,0,Immunological and protective effects of diepitopic subunit dental caries vaccines.,"As a prelude to development of broader-spectrum vaccines for dental caries, we explored the immune potential of constructs combining epitopes from mutans streptococcal glucosyltransferases (GTF) and glucan binding protein B (GbpB). Two diepitopic peptide constructs were synthesized in a multiple antigenic peptide (MAP) format. Both constructs contained SYI, a 20-mer GbpB peptide that included a sequence having major histocompatibility complex class II binding characteristics. One diepitopic construct (SYI-CAT) also contained a 22-mer sequence from the catalytic domain of GTF. Another diepitopic construct (SYI-GLU) contained a 22-mer sequence from the glucan binding domain of GTF. To assess the ability of each construct to induce antibody reactive with GbpB and GTF native proteins, rats were injected subcutaneously with SYI-CAT, SYI-GLU, or the constituent monoepitopic constructs. Only the SYI-CAT construct induced significant levels of serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgA antibody to both pathogenesis-associated proteins. Also, immunization with SYI-CAT significantly (P < 0.001) enhanced the antibody response to the CAT peptide. Experiments then compared experimental dental caries after immunization with SYI-CAT, SYI, or CAT MAP constructs, followed by infection with Streptococcus mutans strain SJr. Dental caries were lower in each peptide-immunized group than in the sham-injected group. The level of protection after SYI-CAT immunization was similar to that after immunization with constituent MAP constructs. In another experiment, rats were infected with Streptococcus sobrinus strain 6715 under an identical protocol. Significant protection was observed on buccal surfaces in both SYI-CAT and CAT construct-immunized, but not in the SYI construct-immunized, groups. Thus, addition of the GbpB-derived SYI peptide to the GTF-derived CAT peptide construct not only enhanced the immunological response to CAT and GTF epitopes, but also extended the protective effect of the construct to include both S. mutans and S. sobrinus."

Post-streptococcal sequelae included several episodes of reactive arthritis and orchitis whose outcome was favorable with corticosteroid therapy. Invasive streptococcal infections are increasingly reported and may associate septic, toxinic, and immunological diseases. High-grade systemic inflammation may induce nonsuppurative complications and autoimmune diseases by molecular mimicry. Among them, reactive arthritis has been recognized as a separate entity from acute rheumatic fever and post-streptococcal orchitis has not been described before. Treatment should be quickly started and should be effective on the etiologic agent but also on its toxins due to the severity of the invasive infections associated with the spread of highly virulent bacterial clones and the potential development of multifocal nonsuppurative sequelae."

CD010502,0,15001317,0,Development of a sandwich-dot enzyme linked immunosorbent assay for Streptococcus pneumoniae antigen detection in cerebrospinal fluid.,A new sandwich dot-enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (sdot-ELISA) was developed using omniserum prepared against different strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae as capture antibody and also as second or revealing antibody after its conjugation with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) for detection of pneumococcal antigen in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). A total of 103 CSF samples of different categories were screened with newly developed dot-ELISA and results were compared with commercially available latex agglutination (LA) kit. The newly developed sdot-ELISA was more sensitive than LA test and can be used as an alternative diagnostic tool in laboratory and in field conditions. An added advantage of this ELISA system was that it did not require antibodies produced in two different animal species.

The new kit is Prolex-Blue (Pro-Lab Diagnostics) and the comparators are Streptex (Murex), PathoDx (DPC), Streptococcus Grouping kit (Oxoid) and Prolex-White (Pro-Lab Diagnostics). A total of 302 consecutive clinical isolates are tested against all five kits, following the individual manufacturer's protocol, for both accuracy and speed. In addition, the data produced permits determination of the strengths or weaknesses of the kits against individual serotypes. Prolex-Blue proved to be both accurate and rapid, with a sensitivity of 99% and a specificity of 100%. Furthermore, average time to agglutination was substantially less than achieved by three of the other four kits evaluated."

Two technical modifications (a reverse dot blot and a reverse line blot hybridization assay) of a novel approach for the type-specific identification of emm genes have been developed. Both procedures involved amplification of an emm gene by polymerase chain reaction. The non-radioactively labeled amplicon was subsequently hybridized to a membrane carrying an array of immobilized emm gene-specific oligonucleotide probes, thus allowing the simultaneous analysis of the gene polymorphism in a single hybridization reaction. The feasibility of these rapid and easy to perform methods was shown for the unequivocal identification of reference strains and clinical isolates belonging to 16 different M serotypes."

CD010502,0,1579816,0,[Acute pharyngitis: value of the bacteriological diagnosis].,"The aetiological diagnosis of acute pharyngitis relies upon laboratory examinations, but these are difficult to obtain in routine general practice. While taking throat swabs is mandatory in some clinical situations (membranous or ulcerous pharyngitis, special investigations in some patients) where it provides essential diagnostic data, it is in fact seldom performed in patients with common acute pharyngitis. Penicillin is systematically administered for fear of the severe sequelae of group A streptococci pharyngitis, but this type of infection occurs in only 10 to 20% of the cases so that on statistical grounds routine antibiotic therapy is not fully justified. For this reason, rapid diagnostic tests without cultures and feasible at the patient's bedside have been devised. These tests have excellent specificity, but their sensitivity is not so good. In addition, their use by general practitioners raises a problem of medical responsibility, and they are not reimbursed by the french Sécurité sociale. The future of these fast methods will depend on the solution of these two problems."
CD010502,0,3322754,0,Upper respiratory tract infections in children: antibiotic treatment.,"Upper respiratory tract infections, particularly pharyngitis and acute otitis media (AOM) are the commonest diseases in children. Although viruses are the main causative agents, bacteria may play an important role. With regard to antibiotic therapy, clinicians must solve two problems: differentiation between viral and bacterial aetiology and choice of the optimal drug for each bacterial disease. In patients with pharyngitis the identification of group A haemolytic streptococci as the causative agent may be very difficult if only clinical and haematological data are considered. Throat culture is time consuming and difficult to perform in ambulatory practice; the recent techniques for rapid detection of streptococcal antigens are a possible answer to this problem. In bacterial pharyngitis a single injection of benzathine penicillin is considered to be first choice. However local pain and the significant increase of the relative risk of allergic problems in comparison with the decrease of incidence of rheumatic fever may shift therapeutic preference towards macrolides. The recently marketed ones, especially miocamycin, seem to offer easier administration, fewer side-effects and better efficacy. With regard to AOM, the differentiation between bacterial and viral disease is less important because over 70% of cases are of bacterial origin. Besides, an exact aetiological diagnosis is possible only by tympanocentesis, an invasive method. In Italy amoxicillin is still the drug of choice: a twice-daily regimen has been demonstrated to be as effective as the traditional thrice-daily schedule."

Interleukin (IL)-1 alpha, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, interferon (IFN)-gamma and tumor necrotizing factor (TNF)-alpha were measured. The stimulation index of IFN-gamma production was significantly higher in tonsillar lymphocytes from PPP than that from RT when cultured with alpha-streptococci (stimulation index: the ratio of cytokine level produced by tonsillar lymphocytes with bacterial antigens to that without antigens). The same results were seen in the case of TNF-alpha, but IL-4 and IL-5 were not detected in any supernatants. These data suggest that increased production of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha in tonsillar lymphocytes may play a key role in this kind of immunologic abnormalities."
CD010502,0,20980578,0,Temporal characterization of carrot broth-enhanced real-time PCR as an alternative means for rapid detection of Streptococcus agalactiae from prenatal anorectal and vaginal screenings.,"Analysis of overnight carrot broth culture using the BD GeneOhm StrepB assay (carrot broth-enhanced PCR) yields increased sensitivity compared to that of carrot broth culture alone for the detection of Streptococcus agalactiae. We investigated the prospect of reducing the carrot broth incubation time prior to PCR performance. In vitro experimentation demonstrated that carrot broth-enhanced PCR nominally detected 10 CFU S. agalactiae after 4 h of carrot broth incubation with competitive flora. Detection rates improved with inocula of 100 and 1,000 CFU S. agalactiae, with the majority of these aliquots demonstrating detection after 2 h of carrot broth incubation. Carrot broth was prospectively inoculated with clinical vaginal/anorectal swabs, with 500-μl aliquots collected. Early aliquots from 227 specimens were subjected to carrot broth-enhanced PCR (early-aliquot carrot broth-enhanced PCR) in instances of subsequent positive carrot broth culture or positive overnight clinical carrot broth-enhanced PCR. The S. agalactiae detection rate by early-aliquot carrot broth-enhanced PCR (66.1%) exceeded that observed for 227 remnant swabs retrospectively tested by direct swab PCR (56.4%; P=0.03). Early-aliquot carrot broth-enhanced PCR detection rate differences were most pronounced in aliquots from 83 carrot broth aliquots collected after 6 h (84.3%) compared to detection rates from either direct swab PCR of these samples (51.8%; P<0.0002) or early-aliquot carrot broth-enhanced PCR of 144 carrot broth aliquots collected after fewer than 6 h of incubation (55.6%; P<0.0002). Enhanced sensitivity of early-aliquot carrot broth-enhanced PCR versus direct swab PCR suggests that this assay could serve as a surrogate rapid detection method facilitating the prevention of group B streptococcal disease."
CD010502,0,11385345,0,Principles of appropriate antibiotic use for acute pharyngitis in adults: background.,"The following principles of appropriate antibiotic use for adults with acute pharyngitis apply to immunocompetent adults without complicated comorbid conditions, such as chronic lung or heart disease, and history of rheumatic fever. They do not apply during known outbreaks of group A streptococcus. 1. Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS) is the causal agent in approximately 10% of adult cases of pharyngitis. The large majority of adults with acute pharyngitis have a self-limited illness, for which supportive care only is needed. 2. Antibiotic treatment of adult pharyngitis benefits only those patients with GABHS infection. All patients with pharyngitis should be offered appropriate doses of analgesics and antipyretics, as well as other supportive care. 3. Limit antibiotic prescriptions to patients who are most likely to have GABHS infection. Clinically screen all adult patients with pharyngitis for the presence of the four Centor criteria: history of fever, tonsillar exudates, no cough, and tender anterior cervical lymphadenopathy (lymphadenitis). Do not test or treat patients with none or only one of these criteria, since these patients are unlikely to have GABHS infection. For patients with two or more criteria the following strategies are appropriate: (a) Test patients with two, three, or four criteria by using a rapid antigen test, and limit antibiotic therapy to patients with positive test results; (b) test patients with two or three criteria by using a rapid antigen test, and limit antibiotic therapy to patients with positive test results or patients with four criteria; or (c) do not use any diagnostic tests, and limit antibiotic therapy to patients with three or four criteria. 4. Throat cultures are not recommended for the routine primary evaluation of adults with pharyngitis or for confirmation of negative results on rapid antigen tests when the test sensitivity exceeds 80%. Throat cultures may be indicated as part of investigations of outbreaks of GABHS disease, for monitoring the development and spread of antibiotic resistance, or when such pathogens as gonococcus are being considered. 5. The preferred antibiotic for treatment of acute GABHS pharyngitis is penicillin, or erythromycin in a penicillin-allergic patient."
CD010502,0,11167998,0,Serial analysis of serum and ascitic fluid levels of soluble adhesion molecules and chemokines in patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.,"The aim of this work was the evaluation of serum and ascitic fluid levels of chemokines (IL-8, growth-regulated oncogene (Gro-alpha), and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1)), and of soluble adhesion molecules (P-selectin, E-selectin, L-selectin, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1)) in patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). These compounds were serially analysed in serum and ascitic fluid by ELISA in patients with SBP (n = 20), non-infected cirrhotic controls (n = 12), and healthy controls (n = 15). Infected and non-infected cirrhotic patients showed significantly higher serum levels of adhesion molecules. SBP was associated with significantly higher serum and ascitic fluid levels of IL-8, Gro-alpha and ICAM-1 and with ascitic fluid concentrations of MCP-1. Significantly elevated serum levels of both ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 were detected in patient non-survivors after SBP. Thus, higher ascitic fluid levels of chemokines could be implicated in the peritoneal infiltrate in patients with SBP. Prognostic significance can be attributed to serum levels of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 in these patients."

CD010502,0,8188363,0,M12 protein from Streptococcus pyogenes is a receptor for immunoglobulin G3 and human albumin.,"We previously showed that M12 protein from opacity factor-negative Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococci) CS24 is responsible for immunoglobulin G3 (IgG3) binding activity. Here, we report that this M protein binds human serum albumin (HSA). Deletion analysis showed that the C repeats are sufficient for binding HSA, although upstream regions may be required for optimal binding. Like protein G, IgG3 and HSA bind to independent domains in the M protein. Experiments showed that bound IgG3 did not inhibit HSA binding to the M protein. The interaction between M12 protein and HSA is specific. M12 protein does not bind chicken egg and bovine serum albumins. Alignments of C1 and C2 repeats of M12 protein to sequences at the carboxy termini of other M proteins and Ig receptors revealed highly homologous sequences in the FcRV, M5, M6, ML2.1, and M57 proteins, suggesting that all could bind HSA. As predicted from the alignment, M5 protein and M6+ streptococci bound HSA, whereas an isogenic M6- mutant did not bind HSA. Furthermore, M2 protein from an opacity factor-positive strain also bound HSA."

We have used a serum HIV antigen (HIV-Ag) enzyme immunoassay (EIA) to diagnose acute HIV infection in four high-risk patients. The clinical syndrome in these four patients was characterized by fever (four), rash (three), myalgias-arthralgias (three), and pharyngitis (two). All patients had spontaneous resolution of their symptoms within eight to 12 days. Serum HIV antibody, as measured by a commercially available screening EIA and by Western blot analysis, was negative in all patients at time of presentation and all seroconverted on subsequent testing. Human immunodeficiency virus was isolated from two of two patients during the acute illness. Initial serum samples from all four patients were positive for HIV-Ag. Serum samples of three of four patients became negative for HIV-Ag and positive for HIV antibody. These data suggest that serum HIV-Ag detection by EIA may be useful in the diagnosis of the acute syndrome caused by HIV infection."
CD010502,0,8188369,0,Cloning and sequence analysis of a gene encoding a 67-kilodalton myosin-cross-reactive antigen of Streptococcus pyogenes reveals its similarity with class II major histocompatibility antigens.,"The group A streptococcal sequela acute rheumatic fever (ARF) has been associated with immunological cross-reactivity between streptococcal and heart proteins. To identify Streptococcus pyogenes genes that encode a myosin cross-reactive antigen(s) recognized by ARF sera, a genomic library from an emm deletion strain (T28/51/4) was screened with a single ARF serum. A positively identified lambda EMBL3 clone (T.2.18) produced a protein which reacted with myosin-specific antibodies affinity purified from individual ARF sera. The recombinant protein was initially estimated to be 60 kDa in size by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; however, upon sequence analysis it had a molecular mass equivalent to 67 kDa. Sera from patients with streptococcal infections, acute glomerulonephritis, and ARF were reactive with the recombinant 67-kDa protein. However, individual sera from healthy persons were negative or demonstrated low levels of reactivity with the 67-kDa antigen. The gene encoding the 67-kDa myosin-cross-reactive antigen was subcloned, and its nucleotide sequence was determined by using a combined strategy of DNA sequencing of the cloned gene and N-terminal amino acid sequencing of the protein expressed in Escherichia coli. The amino-terminal sequence deduced from the nucleotide sequence of an open reading frame was identical to that determined from the 67-kDa protein expressed in E. coli. The gene encoded 590 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 67,381. No cleavable signal peptide was detected with the 67-kDa protein expressed in E. coli. The deduced amino acid sequence of the 67-kDa protein did not exhibit significant similarity to any known streptococcal proteins. However, it was found to be 19% identical and 62% similar over 151 amino acid residues to the beta chain of mouse major histocompatibility complex class II antigen (I-Au). Similar degrees of homology to the beta chains of other murine and human class II haplotypes were found. Mouse anti-IA sera reacted with the recombinant 67-kDa protein about five times more strongly than normal mouse sera in the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Southern hybridization experiments using a probe for the gene encoding the 67-kDa protein showed that the gene was present and conserved among pathogenic groups A, C, and G of streptococci. These data suggest that the streptococcal protein, which is distinct from the M protein, may have structural features in common with the beta chain of the class II antigens, as well as myosin, and may play an important role in the pathogenesis of streptococcal infections."

Intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis of GBS-colonized women decreases vertical transmission and EOD due to GBS. Nevertheless, no intervention has been developed to reduce the risk of EOD related to E. coli.

CD010502,0,2016540,0,Epitopes of group A streptococcal M protein shared with antigens of articular cartilage and synovium.,"Rabbit antisera evoked by purified pepsin-extracted group A streptococcal M proteins were screened for the presence of joint cross-reactive antibodies by indirect immunofluorescence using thin sections of mouse knee joints. Pep M1, M5, and M18 antisera contained antibodies that cross-reacted with chondrocytes, cartilage, and synovium. Immunofluorescence inhibition assays showed that some of the joint cross-reactive epitopes were shared among the three heterologous serotypes of M protein. The pep M5 joint cross-reactive epitopes were localized to three different synthetic peptides of the C-terminal region of pep M5. Immunoblot analyses showed that the M5 joint cross-reactive antibodies recognized two proteins of human synovium and cartilage of molecular mass 56 and 58 kDa. The cross-reactive antibodies binding to the 56-kDa protein were inhibited by purified vimentin in immunoblot inhibition experiments. M protein-specific antibodies from patients with acute rheumatic fever were also shown to cross-react with joint tissue in a pattern similar to the rabbit antisera. Rabbit and human M protein-specific antibodies that were bound to articular cartilage activated significant levels of complement when compared to control serum, suggesting that M protein joint cross-reactive antibodies could potentially be involved in the pathogenesis of ARF and arthritis."

In the sera obtained from all groups of erysipelas patients a significant rise in the levels of antibodies to ribosomes and peptidoglycan in comparison with the controls was revealed. An increase in the level of antibodies to polysaccharide A was revealed only in patients with frequently relapsing and secondary erysipelas.

Cross reaction was seen between M. pneumoniae and M. genitalium. Throat swabs from hamsters infected with M. pneumoniae were positive on 7th and 14th day after infection. Although the cross reaction was seen between M. pneumoniae and M. genitalium, this method could be useful for rapid diagnosis of M. pneumoniae infection."
CD010502,0,10632671,0,Immune response of tonsillar lymphocytes to Haemophilus parainfluenzae in patients with IgA nephropathy.,"The pathogenesis of IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is unclear. We have previously shown glomerular deposition of Haemophilus parainfluenzae (HPI) antigens and the presence of IgA antibody against HPI antigens in patients with IgAN. We examined the immune response to HPI antigens in tonsillar lymphocytes from patients with IgAN. Lymphocytes isolated from the palatine tonsils of 13 IgAN patients and 16 patients with chronic tonsillitis but without renal disease were used as controls. We examined lymphocyte proliferation and production of IgA antibody against HPI antigens by measuring thymidine uptake and IgA antibody in culture supernatants after lymphocyte incubation with HPI antigens. Patients with IgAN showed a significantly higher stimulation index to HPI antigens (thymidine incorporation in tonsillar lymphocytes with HPI/thymidine incorporation in unstimulated tonsillar lymphocytes) than controls (P < 0.002). Lymphocytes from patients with IgAN also showed a significantly higher level of IgA antibody and IgA1 antibody against HPI antigens in culture supernatants than lymphocytes from controls (P = 0.0002 and P = 0.004, respectively). Our results suggest that HPI antigens stimulate tonsillar T and B lymphocytes in patients with IgAN and that an immune response to HPI antigens may play a role in the pathogenesis of this disease in some cases."
CD010502,0,17944378,0,[Development and characterization of monoclonal Antibody against M-like protein of Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus from pig].,"Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus belongs to lancefield group C streptococcus, which can cause disease both in animals and humans. It has been associated with a wide variety of serious infections, including meningitis, pneumonia, septic arthritis and mastitis. The M like proteins on the surface of S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus have an antiphagocytic role analogous to that of group A streptococcal M proteins that are essential in establishing infection. In the present study, the M-like gene without partial signal peptide sequence was amplified from genomic DNA of S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus ATCC35246 strain isolated from pig by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Then the amplified fragment was cloned in the proper orientation into the site between EcoR I and Xho I of pET32-a(+) via restriction endonuclease EcoR I and Xho I. The recombinant plasmid was verified by restriction endonuclease analysis and nucleotide sequencing, then transformed into E. coli BL21. An fusion protein was expressed in BL21 after induced by IPTG, SDS-PAGE analysis showed that the recombinant protein had a molecular weight of 60 kD, Western blotting showed a positive reaction with the antiserum against ATCC35246. To prepare the monoclonal antibodies (McAbs) against the M-like protein, 6-8 weeks old BABL/c mice were immunized endermicly with purified recombinant M-like protein by Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography. Splenocytes from the immuniszed mice were fused with SP2/0 and indirect ELISA was used to screen hybridoma cells. 12 hybridoma cell lines secreting McAbs against M-like protein of Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus were generated, and indirect ELISA confirmed that these McAbs only reacted with M-like protein, but not reacted with other bacteria such as group A Streptococci, Streptococcus suis type 2, Streptococcus equi. The indirect ELISA titers of these 12 ascites McAbs were about 2.56 x 10(4) to 1.01 x 10(5) , and the subtype of these McAbs belong to IgG2b, IgG1, IgM. The results of adhersion inhibition showed McAbs 2C8 could inhibit the adhersion of M-like protein to HEp-2 cell."

The Breese scoring system, modified by eliminating the count of peripheral WBC, was used in the study. At enrolment, cases of AP observed by office-based pediatricians were judged on a clinical basis as possibly of streptococcal or of non-streptococcal origin and a clinical score recorded. At the end of the visit and following completion of the clinical score to document the presence/absence of a group A beta haemolytic streptococcus (GABHS), a confirmatory RADT was performed. In RADT negative cases a standard throat swab and culture were performed. In all, 629 children presenting with AP were enrolled in the study. A correct clinical diagnosis was predicted on the basis of the clinical observation in 74.2% of cases (with a sensitivity of 81.1% and specificity of 70.5%). In cases judged as ""streptococcal"", a mean score of 27.6 was recorded both in those patients with a positive or negative RADT/throat swab for GABHS. By contrast, among cases considered of non-streptococcal aetiology, negative RADT/culture had a mean score of 24.3 compared to a mean score of 25 in those with a positive RADT/culture. Intragroup score differences were not significant, while intergroup differences were highly significant. Optimization of AP treatment requires careful identification of streptococcal cases, avoiding unnecessary antibiotic treatment which would contribute to enhancing antibiotic resistance and increase medical treatment costs. We document that clinical observation alone, although performed by skilled pediatricians, will misdiagnose a sizeable percentage of cases. As indicated by this study, scores may suffer from a subjective interpretative bias in grading the severity of signs and symptoms."

Of 188 specimens, 90 were positive for CMV in centrifugation culture. The fluorescein-conjugated MAb detected CMV in 86 of 90 (95%) specimens at 16 h postinoculation, and 88 of 90 (98%) were positive at 36 h. The fluorescein-conjugated MAb can be used in a direct immunofluorescence assay that can be completed in 15 min following cover slip fixation. Use of this antibody in centrifugation culture provides a convenient and rapid assay for the identification of CMV."
CD010502,0,15784582,0,Clinical and microbiological responses of volunteers to combined intranasal and oral inoculation with a Streptococcus gordonii carrier strain intended for future use as a group A streptococcus vaccine.,"Streptococcus gordonii shows promise as a live mucosal vaccine vector for immunization against respiratory pathogens. In preparation for clinical trials to evaluate S. gordonii engineered to express group A streptococcal M protein antigens, we characterized the responses of 150 healthy volunteers to combined nasal and oral inoculation with approximately 1.5 x 10(9) CFU of SP204(1-1), an S. gordonii strain not bearing vaccine antigens. SP204(1-1) was selected for resistance to streptomycin and 5-fluoro-2-deoxyuridine to distinguish it from indigenous flora. In two antibiotic treatment studies, we performed serial culturing of nose, mouth, and saliva samples from 120 subjects treated with azithromycin beginning 5 days after inoculation to determine whether SP204(1-1) could be rapidly eliminated should safety concerns arise. A natural history study was performed to assess the time until spontaneous eradication in the remaining 30 subjects, who did not receive the antibiotic and who were monitored with repeated culturing for 14 weeks after inoculation. SP204(1-1) was generally well tolerated. Symptoms reported most often within 5 days of inoculation were nasal congestion (36%), headache (30%), and sore throat (19%). The strain was detected by culturing in 98% of subjects. A single dose of azithromycin eliminated colonization in 95% of subjects; all subjects receiving a 5-day course of an antibiotic showed clearance by day 11. Without the antibiotic, 82% of subjects showed spontaneous eradication of the implanted strain within 7 days, and all showed clearance by 35 days. The results of these clinical trials provide encouragement that the use of S. gordonii as a live mucosal vaccine vector is a feasible strategy."

CD010502,0,9534234,0,Extensive genetic diversity among clinical isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes serotype M5.,"The genetic diversity of clinical isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes serotype M5 has been characterized. Strain genotypes were defined by macrorestriction profile, 16S ribotype, emm gene subtype, insertion element IS1239 profile, and exotoxin gene determinant. By these criteria, clinical isolates of M5 constituted a multiplicity of strain clusters rather than a homogeneous population as found for certain serotypes. Distance matrices and an unrooted tree were constructed from macrorestriction data with three rarely cutting endonucleases, determined by PFGE. A single IS1239 profile was common to 85% of isolates but there was great diversity of both ribotype and macrorestriction profile, and 18 different emm gene subtypes were detected by PCR-RFLP. DNA sequence analysis of the antigen-coding 5' (hypervariable) region of emm gene amplicons (about 240 bp) showed that 14/18 exhibited up to 6% divergence. Four amplicons had highly divergent sequences--corresponding to those previously determined for emm6, emm11, emm18 and emm77. Further serological and hybridization studies were used to analyse the discrepancy between the Lancefield serotype of these strains (M5) and their emm genotype. Overall, this study shows a high degree of genetic diversity in serotype M5, with implications for the Lancefield scheme itself, for the epidemiology of group A streptococci, and for recombinant DNA strategies for M protein-based vaccine development."

In this study we evaluated a screening procedure for Neisseria gonorrhoeae (GC) from all sample sites in a low-prevalence setting. A total of 69,252 specimens submitted for Chlamydia trachomatis testing were also examined for GC on the BD Viper™ platform using the BD Probetec ET system. In order to avoid false-positive results all GC BD reactive samples were re-tested using a PCR method with the porA pseudogene as target. Using this method we screened 170% more samples for GC than in the previous year, in the same population, and diagnosed more than twice as many GC-positive episodes. The BD system can be used successfully to screen extra-genital as well as genital specimen types for GC in a low-prevalence area if it is combined with a validated confirmatory PCR test."
CD010502,0,8778565,0,Biological properties of a Streptococcus pyogenes mutant generated by Tn916 insertion in mga.,"The mga regulon of Streptococcus pyogenes contains genes which contribute to the pathogenicity and virulence of this significant human pathogen. Transposon insertional inactivation of the regulatory mga gene in a S. pyogenes strain of the clinically important M1 serotype, blocked the expression of four genes located downstream of mga. These genes encode the M1 protein, the IgG-binding protein H, protein SIC which is an extracellular inhibitor of complement, and the C5a peptidase which interferes with granulocyte migration. The wild-type strain is resistant to phagocytosis and adheres to human skin tissue sections; properties that were lost in the transposon mutant. Moreover, the mutant was less virulent to mice but more cytolytic to human lymphocytes, the latter due to an increased activity of streptolysin S, whereas the production of streptolysin O, another toxin of S. pyogenes, was not affected. The mga mutation was complemented in trans with an intact mga gene which restored the phenotype of the wild-type strain."
CD010502,0,15279944,0,Application of oligonucleotide array technology for the rapid detection of pathogenic bacteria of foodborne infections.,"A rapid and accurate method for detection for common pathogenic bacteria in foodborne infections was established by using oligonucleotide array technology. Nylon membrane was used as the array support. A mutation region of the 23S rRNA gene was selected as the discrimination target from 14 species (genera) of bacteria causing foodborne infections and two unrelated bacterial species. A pair of universal primers was designed for PCR amplification of the 23S rRNA gene. Twenty-one species (genera)-specific oligonucleotide detection probes were synthesized and spotted onto the nylon membranes. The 23S rRNA gene amplification products of 14 species of pathogenic bacteria were hybridized to the oligonucleotide array. Hybridization results were analyzed with digoxigenin-linked enzyme reaction. Results indicated that nine species of pathogenic bacteria (Escherichia coli, Campylobacter jejuni, Shigella dysenteriae, Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Proteus vulgaris, Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes and Clostridium botulinum) showed high sensitivity and specificity for the oligonucleotide array. Two other species (Salmonella enterica and Yersinia enterocolitica) gave weak cross-reaction with E. coli, but the reaction did not affect their detection. After redesigning the probes, positive hybridization results were obtained with Staphylococcus aureus, but not with Clostridium perfringens and Streptococcus pyogenes. The oligonucleotide array can also be applied to samples collected in clinical settings of foodborne infections. The superiority of oligonucleotide array over other tests lies on its rapidity, accuracy and efficiency in the diagnosis, treatment and control of foodborne infections."

CD010502,0,22345598,0,Identification of conserved antigens from staphylococcal and streptococcal pathogens.,"The design of vaccines containing epitopes shared between different human pathogens may lead to cross-species protection. In order to identify potentially conserved bacterial antigens, bacteriophage expression libraries of genomic DNA from Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes were probed with human sera from Staphylococcus aureus-infected and healthy individuals. By comparison with previous screening data from Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staph. aureus, putative antigenic, conserved domains across the genera were identified. In particular, three potentially antigenic conserved regions were identified based on the N-terminal domain of SACOL0609 (SdrD), the C-terminal domain of SACOL0723 (ScaB) and the C-terminus of SACOL1140 (IsdA) from Staph. aureus. The three domains were overexpressed, recombinant proteins were purified and polyclonal antisera raised against them recognized cell surface-located proteins from both staphylococcal and streptococcal species. The antisera were also able to opsonize both Staph. aureus and Strep. agalactiae thereby increasing their phagocytic uptake by human neutrophils. The conserved antigenic domains therefore represent potential cross-protective vaccine candidates."

CD010502,0,18538421,1,Diagnostic value of rapid antigen detection test for streptococcal pharyngitis in a pediatric population.,"Acute upper respiratory tract infections in children may result in overuse of antibiotics as throat culture cannot be performed in every setting and results cannot be obtained early. A rapid and reliable test might decrease unnecessary antibiotic usage. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of group A beta-hemolytic Streptococcus (GABHS) infections in different pediatric age groups and to assess the diagnostic value of rapid antigen detection test (RADT) for streptococcal pharyngitis. This study was performed in a pediatric outpatient clinic. All children who were admitted with signs and symptoms of acute upper respiratory tract infections were included in the study. Throat culture and RADT were performed and prevalence of GABHS was assessed. Diagnostic value of RADT was determined. This study included 1248 children with a mean age of 6.3+/-3.6 years. There were 655, 518, and 75 children in age groups of 0-6, 7-12 and 13+ years, respectively. The overall prevalence of GABHS was 38.1% (475/1248), as judged by throat culture. The prevalence was highest in the 7-12-year age group (53.9%) and lowest in the 0-6-year age group (25.2%). Considering all patients, RADT gave a sensitivity of 89.7%, specificity of 97.2%. The sensitivity and specificity of RADT were similar in different age groups (p values >0.05). Diagnostic value of RADT is high and can be used safely in populations where streptococcal pharyngitis and its complications such as acute rheumatic fever and acute glomerulonephritis are common."

The sensitivity and specificity of 3 commercially available Strep A tests were determined in 2 private pediatric office settings. Acceava Strep A, Genzyme OSOM Strep A, and the Quidel QuickVue Strep A tests were the representative rapid tests for detection of Streptococcus pyogenes.

CD010502,0,12682191,0,drs (Distantly related sic) gene polymorphisms among emm12-type Streptococcus pyogenes isolates.,Twenty-eight emm12-type Streptococcus pyogenes isolates from patients with invasive and noninvasive infections or from asymptomatic carriers were genetically typed. Sequencing of drs (distantly related sic [streptococcal inhibitor of complement]) genes identified two novel alleles and revealed a polymorphism for drs similar to that of sic. No association was observed between the five different drs alleles and the five restriction patterns of the vir regulon for the isolates studied. These data suggest that drs sequencing may be useful for further differentiation of S. pyogenes isolates with emm12 and identical vir regulon restriction patterns.
CD010502,0,6413107,0,Immunological studies of post-streptococcal sequelae: serological studies with an extracellular protein associated with nephritogenic streptococci.,"Using the Ouchterlony double diffusion and the crossed-immunoelectrophoresis techniques the reactivity to a purified extracellular product of nephritogenic group A streptococci (NASP) was examined with both acute and convalescent sera obtained from patients with documented post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis and patients with documented acute rheumatic fever. The streptococcal antigen utilized in these studies was first purified on SDS gels and then eluted from the gel, resulting in a single protein band on SDS electrophoresis. Double diffusion studies revealed that only nephritis patients reacted to this extracellular product associated with nephritogenic strains, whereas rheumatic fever sera produced no line of precipitation. An assay of serial bleedings from nephritis patients suggested that the antibody reactive to the NASP was in higher titre in the acute phase of the disease and decreased with convalescence. In confirmation of these findings, crossed-immunoelectrophoresis experiments were conducted with a battery of sera from acute nephritic and non-nephritic patients against the NASP antigen. A striking increase was detected in the reactivity of nephritis patients (96%) compared to non-nephritis sera (15-20%). Comparison between acute and convalescent sera using this technique confirmed the finding of decreasing antibody titre with resolution of disease. These findings of a specific humoral response in patients with acute post-streptococcal nephritis to the NASP of nephritogenic strains further implicates an aetiological function to this protein."

Even in health human volunteers lymphocyte proliferation, lymphokine production and immunoglobulin synthesis is induced by high concentrations of streptococcal cell components following a pattern of polyclonal lymphocyte activation. We were interested in the special cellular requirements in this particular model. In cell separation and restitution experiments the observed B-cell activation was identified as the consequence of a primary monocyte-dependent polyclonal T-cell activation. Furthermore, lymphocyte proliferation and lymphokine production proved to be a monocyte- and T-cell-dependent process as well. Thus, lymphocyte activation induced by somatic streptococcal structures in humans depends upon a pattern of cell cooperation of mononuclear subpopulations well-known in a series of classical mitogen-induced lymphocyte activation."

CD010502,0,11971006,0,Identification of the streptococcal M protein binding site on membrane cofactor protein (CD46).,"Adherence of group A streptococcus (GAS) to keratinocytes is mediated by an interaction between human CD46 (membrane cofactor protein) with streptococcal cell surface M protein. CD46 belongs to a family of proteins that contain structurally related short consensus repeat (SCR) domains and regulate the activation of the complement components C3b and/or C4b. CD46 possesses four SCR domains and the aim of this study was to characterize their interaction with M protein. Following confirmation of the M6 protein-dependent interaction between GAS and human keratinocytes, we demonstrated that M6 protein binds soluble recombinant CD46 protein and to a CD46 construct containing only SCRs 3 and 4. M6 protein did not bind to soluble recombinant CD46 chimeric proteins that had the third and/or fourth SCR domains replaced with the corresponding domains from another complement regulator, CD55 (decay-accelerating factor). Homology-based molecular modeling of CD46 SCRs 3 and 4 revealed a cluster of positively charged residues between the interface of these SCR domains similar to the verified M protein binding sites on the plasma complement regulators factor H and C4b-binding protein. The presence of excess M6 protein did not inhibit the cofactor activity of CD46 and the presence of excess C3b did not inhibit the ability of CD46 to bind M6 protein by ELISA. In conclusion, 1) adherence of M6 GAS to keratinocytes is M protein dependent and 2) a major M protein binding site is located within SCRs 3 and 4, probably at the interface of these two domains, at a site distinct from the C3b-binding and cofactor site of CD46."

The diagnostic informativeness of these methods was found higher than that of antistreptolysin-O determination.

The study was performed to determine whether the Genzyme test was a more sensitive rapid test than the currently used Quidel test. A highly sensitive rapid test would eliminate the need to perform backup cultures, thus saving time and facilitating faster diagnosis and treatment. The study revealed that the Genzyme test was more sensitive (85.5%) than the Quidel test (79.5%). However, the difference was not statistically significant using the McNemar chi(2) tool and was attributable to random variability. Therefore, future comparative studies need to be performed to find a rapid antigen test with sensitivity comparable to that of throat culture, for use at the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base pediatric clinic."

In the present paper the mechanism of the plasmid effect of the SOR expression has been studied. The filter mating transfer of the plasmid pEL1 and pAM beta 1 into the recipient strain 154(8-3)SOR+ (cured of EmR) but not into the strain CSLL2SOR+ resulted in two types of transconjugants obtained: EmRSOR+ (90%) and EmRSOR- (10%). It was found in DNA-DNA hybridization experiments that the OF-EmR transconjugants but not OF+EmR ones carry the same pEL1 plasmids that are harboured by the donor strain SM60ERL1. Mutation to SOR- is considered to be the results of the plasmid of transposon DNA insertion into the homologous region of the recipient strain 154(8-3).
CD010502,0,17060694,0,Outbreak of respiratory tract infections on an islet in Korea: possible Chlamydia pneumoniae infection.,"In March 2004, we experienced an outbreak of Chlamydia pneumoniae infection on an islet of Korea. In order to assess the significance of the epidemic, we performed a mass examination of 137 students (7-16 years old; male, 69; female, 58) at a school. The examination consisted of a questionnaire inquiring about respiratory symptoms, a serum antibody test for C. pneumoniae using a microimmunofluorescence (MIF) method and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and nasopharyngeal swab tests to detect of the organism by specific PCR and cell culture. The results demonstrated that 72 (58.3%) of the students had respiratory symptoms such as rhinorrhea, a sore throat, and/or cough or fever. The PCR positivity of acute-phase patients was 63% (12/19) and PCR positivity using the culture sample was 94% (18/19). However, the existence of the organism was not confirmed fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC). ELISA, one of the serological methods utilized, demonstrated, in the same patients, 48% (13/27) positive IgM antibodies at the acute phase of the outbreak, and 16% (3/19) positive IgM antibodies during the convalescent phase. The index value (ID) 3.0 for single-sera IgG was 19% (5/27) and that for IgA was 4% (1/27) at the acute phase; the corresponding percentages in the convalescent phase were 11% (2/19) and 5% (1/19), respectively. However, as regards paired sera, no patient demonstrated a 1.35 ELISA ID value at 2 weeks, or an increased value of 1.0 at 8 weeks after the onset of the outbreak. In the MIF experiment, the percent positivity of unpaired IgM from the acute phase was 58% (11/19). At convalescent phase, this percentage was 47% (9/19); however, the positivity of paired serum IgG was 26% (5/19). In the same sample, the percentage of positive cases demonstrated by both ELISA and MIF approaches for single IgM was 37% (7/19) at the acute phase and 11% (2/19) at the convalescent phase. We were unable to isolate C. pneumoniae by cell culture, but we did obtain sufficient serological and PCR data to consider C. pneumoniae as the causative agent of the outbreak. Meaningful results were acquired in terms of serology, and were compared to the healthy population in Korea. Although it remains necessary to investigate the possibility of co-infection and to determine whether or not this outbreak coincides with the prevalence of influenza, it was unequivocally concluded that this outbreak of C. pneumoniae infection has occurred on an islet of Korea."

The following conclusions can be made in regard to our study. The percentage of T cells decreases in all compartments of the tonsils with increasing episodes of tonsillitis as well as with infectious mononucleosis and Streptococcal tonsillitis. Similarly, the percentage of HLA-DR positive cells decreases with increasing episodes of tonsillitis and is statistically significant in the mantle zone. The percentage of IgM B cells and IgD B cells tends to increase in the extrafollicular zone and decrease in the mantle zone with increasing episodes of tonsillitis as well as with increasing age. The percentage of IgG and IgA plasma cells is highest in children who have had 3-5 episodes of tonsillitis, but markedly decreases in the follicle and extrafollicular compartments in patients who have had more than 5 episodes of tonsillitis. FACS analysis of B cells in the tonsils and peripheral blood show a marked decrease in IgD in both the tonsil and the peripheral blood and a significant increase of IgG in the peripheral blood. These findings may suggest late clonal expansion of B cells in recurrent tonsillitis and Streptococcal tonsillitis. Finally, the distribution of immunocompetent cells in recurrent tonsillitis, Streptococcal tonsillitis and tonsillitis associated with infectious mononucleosis appears to be independent of age."

Severe invasive group A streptococcal infections: a subject review.,"The course of severe invasive group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal (GABHS) infections is often precipitous, requiring prompt diagnosis and rapid initiation of appropriate therapy. Therefore, physicians must have a high index of suspicion of this disease, particularly in patients at increased risk (e.g., those with varicella or diabetes mellitus). Although a relationship between the use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and severe invasive GABHS infections has been suggested, at present data on which to base a clinical decision about the use or restriction of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs in children with varicella are insufficient. When necrotizing fasciitis is suspected, prompt surgical drainage, debridement, fasciotomy, or amputation often is necessary. Many experts recommend intravenously administered penicillin G and clindamycin for the treatment of invasive GABHS infections on the basis of animal studies. Some evidence exists that intravenous immunoglobulin given in addition to appropriate antimicrobial and surgical therapy may be beneficial. Although chemoprophylaxis for household contacts of persons with invasive GABHS infections has been considered by some experts, the limited available data indicate that the risk of secondary cases is low (2.9 per 1000) and data about the effectiveness of any drug are insufficient to make recommendations. Because of the low risk of secondary cases of invasive GABHS infections in schools or child care facilities, chemoprophylaxis is not indicated in these settings. Routine immunization of all healthy children against varicella is recommended and is an effective means to decrease the risk of invasive GABHS infections."

Five hundred asymptomatic patients with intact membranes who were in labor at term underwent sterile speculum examination. Secretions from the endocervix and vagina were collected with sterile swabs. One swab was inoculated directly onto a blood agar plate for culture. The other was initially placed into a Culturette transport system and then transferred into a test tube containing an enzyme extraction reagent. After a 60-minute incubation at 37C, the latex fixation test was performed on the residual liquid in the tube. The frequency of positive cultures in our population was 5.0%. The sensitivity and specificity of the rapid slide test were 88 and 99.6%, respectively. The positive and negative predictive values were 91.7 and 99.4%, respectively. The group B streptococci latex fixation test appears to be a rapid and reliable means of detecting group B streptococci in the lower genital tract of term patients with intact membranes. Use of this method should permit a more selective approach to the intrapartum chemoprophylaxis of women colonized with group B streptococci."

CD010502,0,19758136,0,Autoantigens identified by screening a human heart cDNA library with acute rheumatic fever sera.,"Acute rheumatic fever (ARF) is an autoimmune sequela of group A streptococcal infection mostly affecting school-aged children. Recurrent episodes of ARF can result in the development of rheumatic heart disease (RHD). One in 40 indigenous Australians in the Northern Territory is affected by RHD. This disease mostly impacts young people; 45% of those who require heart valve surgery in Australia due to RHD are younger than 25 years old. ARF is characterized by autoimmune attack of the heart; therefore, the presence of the autoantibodies involved could potentially be used to diagnose ARF. To this end, a human heart cDNA library was screened with serum from a patient with ARF, and 12 autoreactive human heart antigens were identified. They include five different IgG heavy chains and a range of tissue-specific cell-signaling proteins, species of which have been implicated in other autoimmune diseases. Preliminary ELISA results show that ARF patients have significantly higher levels of antibodies recognizing the cardiac autoantigens than controls. These antigens are promising candidates for the development of a serological assay for the diagnosis of ARF. The nature of the proteins identified has exciting implications for future research into the pathogenesis of ARF."

Because ELR(+) CXC chemokines are expressed in different types of tonsillitis we investigated the role of the surface/crypt epithelium of human tonsils in producing ELR(+) CXC chemokines: interleukin (IL)-8 (CXCL8), ENA-78 (CXCL5), GRO-alpha (CXCL1) and GCP-2 (CXCL6). Tonsillar tissue was obtained from patients undergoing tonsillectomy and chemokine expression was investigated by means of immunohistochemistry. A549 cells were used as a model to study kinetics of chemokine expression in epithelial cells. Cells were stimulated with tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and supernatants derived from aerobic/anaerobic Staphylococcus aureus strains. Chemokine expression was measured by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). We observed epithelial expression of IL-8, GRO-alpha and GCP-2 in different types of tonsillitis, whereas ENA-78 was rarely expressed. In A549 cells abundant expression of ENA-78 was detected. IL-8 and GCP-2 are expressed in an acute type of tonsillitis whereas GRO-alpha was frequently detectable both in chronically and acutely inflamed tonsils. ENA-78 does not seem to play a pivotal role in tonsillitis in vivo."
CD010502,0,16493599,0,Peptidoglycan and peptidoglycan-specific Th1 cells in psoriatic skin lesions.,"We have previously demonstrated, in psoriatic skin lesions, the presence of a subset of dermal CD4+ T cells that produce interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) in response to a mixture of cell wall proteins extracted from group A streptococci. However, the identity of the antigen(s) involved is unknown. To investigate the hypothesis that peptidoglycan (PG), the major constituent of the streptococcal cell wall, acts as a T cell activator in psoriasis, we performed in situ analysis to detect antigen-presenting cells containing PG in lesional versus non-lesional skin, and determined proliferation and IFN-gamma responses of lesional skin T cells. Increased numbers of PG-containing cells were detected in the dermal papillae and cellular infiltrates of guttate and chronic plaque skin lesions compared with normal and non-lesional psoriatic skin. A varying proportion of these were CD68+ macrophages, but the remaining cells did not double stain for either Langerhans' or dendritic cell markers. Psoriatic dermal streptococcal-specific CD4+ T cell lines proliferated and produced IFN-gamma in a self HLA-DR allele-restricted manner in response to streptococcal PG, excluding mitogenic or superantigenic stimulation, but were unresponsive to staphylococcal PG. Similarly, psoriatic staphylococcus-specific T cell lines recognized staphylococcal, but not streptococcal, PG by IFN-gamma production. The presence of PG-containing macrophages in close association with PG-specific CD4+ T cells in lesional skin suggests that PG may be responsible, at least in part, for T cell activation in psoriasis."
CD010502,0,8879762,0,Microbiology and laboratory diagnosis of upper respiratory tract infections.,"In the article that follows, Carroll and Reimer address a number of issues related to the clinical and laboratory diagnosis of upper respiratory tract infections. These syndromes occur with great frequency in both adults and children and have tremendous economic impact, related not only to lost productivity in the workplace but also to the frequent prescription by physicians of antibiotics, even when the etiologic agents of infection almost certainly are not bacteria. Most of these infections are diagnosed clinically, and specimens for microbiological identification are not obtained. Indeed, the difficulty in obtaining microbiological specimens that are not contaminated by resident colonizing flora often results in laboratory culture reports of dubious clinical value. As the authors note, the most standardized procedures are for the diagnosis of pharyngitis due to Streptococcus pyogenes. The preferred culture methods are reviewed as are the sensitivities, specificities, and limitations of rapid direct tests for group A streptococcal antigens. Currently, as the authors emphasize, a negative direct test mandates a conventional culture for S. pyogenes. More problematic are requests for isolation of other streptococci, Haemophilus species, corynebacteria, and gram-negative bacteria. Given limited resources, cost-containment imperatives, and the absence of clear evidence that these organisms are pharyngeal pathogens associated with important sequelae, my laboratory does not attempt to isolate these bacteria unless the ordering physician has directly consulted with me (the laboratory director). Carroll and Reimer emphasize that nasopharyngeal cultures have no place in the microbiological diagnosis of otitis media and that diagnostic tympanocentesis is the only procedure for obtaining specimens that yield reliable microbiological findings. They also point out the futility of using swabs to obtain material for the diagnosis of otitis externa, since the external auditory canal cannot be decontaminated sufficiently to obtain a meaningful culture result. Finally, the authors address the available methods for obtaining specimens to establish the etiology of sinusitis. For microbiological diagnosis, direct antral puncture has been the method of choice for many years. However, otorhinolaryngologists now obtain many specimens endoscopically. It probably is not possible to obtain specimens by this method without contamination by normal upper respiratory flora. Thus, results of cultures of endoscopic specimens are more difficult to interpret. For patients with complicated illnesses, use of the diagnostic ""gold standard"" of antral puncture, as well as biopsy with histopathologic correlation, should be encouraged."
CD010502,0,16672557,0,Oral EBV and KSHV infection in HIV.,"The gamma herpesviruses, Kaposi's-sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), are tightly associated with the development of AIDS-associated oral disease and malignancy during immune suppression. The objective of this investigation was to characterize oral infection and pathogenesis in healthy and immune-suppressed individuals. To characterize oral EBV and KSHV infection, we examined throat washings and oral epithelial cells from HIV-positive and HIV-negative individuals. Quantitative/real-time polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) assays, transmission electronmicroscopy, immunostaining, and sequence analysis were used to identify viral infection. Virus was isolated from throat-wash samples and was used to infect epithelial and lymphoid cell lines. We detected EBV and KSHV in the oral cavity in healthy and immune-suppressed individuals. Viral strain analysis of KSHV K1 in multiple clones from the oral cavities of healthy persons and immunosuppressed patients detected several strains previously detected in KS lesions, with minor strain variation within individuals. Immunoelectron microscopy for multiple viral antigens detected consistent expression of viral proteins and oral epithelial specimens. In oral epithelial cells infected with wild-type KSHV in vitro, the K8.1 glycoprotein associated with lytic KSHV infection was detected in both primary and telomerase immortalized oral epithelial cultures by 24 hours post-infection. Virions were detected, subsequent to infection, by scanning electron microscopy. Oral epithelial cells were also infected in vitro with wild-type EBV originating from throat washes. Analysis of these data suggests that, like EBV, KSHV infection is present in the oropharynx of healthy individuals, is transmissible in vitro, and may be transmitted by saliva."

CD010502,0,9874566,0,Identification and characterization of novel superantigens from Streptococcus pyogenes.,"Three novel streptococcal superantigen genes (spe-g, spe-h, and spe-j) were identified from the Streptococcus pyogenes M1 genomic database at the University of Oklahoma. A fourth novel gene (smez-2) was isolated from the S. pyogenes strain 2035, based on sequence homology to the streptococcal mitogenic exotoxin z (smez) gene. SMEZ-2, SPE-G, and SPE-J are most closely related to SMEZ and streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin (SPE)-C, whereas SPE-H is most similar to the staphylococcal toxins than to any other streptococcal toxin. Recombinant (r)SMEZ, rSMEZ-2, rSPE-G, and rSPE-H were mitogenic for human peripheral blood lymphocytes with half-maximal responses between 0.02 and 50 pg/ml (rSMEZ-2 and rSPE-H, respectively). SMEZ-2 is the most potent superantigen (SAg) discovered thus far. All toxins, except rSPE-G, were active on murine T cells, but with reduced potency. Binding to a human B-lymphoblastoid line was shown to be zinc dependent with high binding affinity of 15-65 nM. Evidence from modeled protein structures and competitive binding experiments suggest that high affinity binding of each toxin is to the major histocompatibility complex class II beta chain. Competition for binding between toxins was varied and revealed overlapping but discrete binding to subsets of class II molecules in the hierarchical order (SMEZ, SPE-C) > SMEZ-2 > SPE-H > SPE-G. The most common targets for the novel SAgs were human Vbeta2.1- and Vbeta4-expressing T cells. This might reflect a specific role for this subset of Vbetas in the immune defense of gram-positive bacteria."

CD010502,0,6773882,0,Immunogenetics of response to a purified antigen from group A streptococci. II. Linkage of response to HLA.,"Employing an in vitro blastogenesis model, evidence has been set forth for a major gene locus which controls response to a purified, extracellular antigen from group A streptococci. Response to this antigen is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Analysis of the data for linkage to HLA was done with the computer program LINKAS which can resolve pleiotropy from linkage and can detect and estimate recombination in the presence of etiological heterogeneity. Maximum likelihood estimation and likelihood ratio tests were used to assess the relative support for competing hypotheses. The results of this analysis indicate that at least two loci are involved in one of two ways: one locus that is closely linked to HLA and one locus that is unlinked; or a two-locus system of complementary alleles which are both tightly linked to HLA."

The recently described serotype IV was the commonest (35.1%) among the strains isolated. Three methods for the rapid detection of heavy colonization by group B streptococci in neonates were compared: Gram stain of the pharyngeal aspirate collected immediately post-partum; direct application of latex agglutination to the first post-partum pharyngeal aspirate; and application of latex agglutination to selective Todd Hewitt broth, inoculated with pharyngeal aspirate and body swabs, after five hours of incubation. It seems that both latex agglutination methods can rapidly detect a considerable proportion of neonates heavily contaminated with group B streptococci intra-partum; therefore both methods deserve further evaluation."
CD010502,0,7995956,0,"Ig-binding surface proteins of Streptococcus pyogenes also bind human C4b-binding protein (C4BP), a regulatory component of the complement system.","Streptococcus pyogenes, an important human pathogen, expresses several proteins that interact with the immune system of the host. Among the proteins isolated from different bacterial strains are antiphagocytic M proteins, Ig Fc-binding proteins and exotoxins that act as superantigens. Here we report a novel interaction between S. pyogenes and the human immune system, the ability of most S. pyogenes strains to bind human C4BP (C4b-binding protein), a 570-kDa serum protein that inhibits the classical pathway of complement activation. Molecular analysis of three different streptococcal strains demonstrated that C4BP binds to protein Arp or protein Sir, two Ig-binding cell surface molecules that are members of the M protein family. These bacterial proteins have separate high affinity binding sites for Ig and for C4BP, as demonstrated by inhibition tests and binding assays with purified components. A single streptococcal cell surface molecule, Arp or Sir, therefore combines the abilities to bind Ig and C4BP, two high m.w. components of the immune system. Two bacterial strains expressing Arp or Sir were shown to selectively bind C4BP in whole human serum, suggesting that S. pyogenes also binds C4BP in the infected host. When bound to streptococcal cells, C4BP retained its ability to act as a cofactor in the degradation of C4b by factor I. These results indicate that many strains of S. pyogenes interfere with the classical pathway of complement activation by binding C4BP to the bacterial cell surface."

CD010502,0,8315878,0,[C3 production by peripheral blood monocytes in patients with membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis and poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis].,"Peripheral blood monocytes (PBM) and T cells from patients with membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) and poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSAGN) were measured for the production on C3 and interferon-gamma respectively using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Testing of MPGN and PSAGN patients at acute stage showed that C3 levels by PBM were significantly higher than those of normal controls, whereas the levels of PSAGN patients at convalescent stage dropped within the range of normal controls. Levels of C3 production by PBM inversely correlated with serum C3 in both MPGN and PSAGN patients. Interferon-gamma production by T cells of MPGN patients were significantly higher than those of normal controls, while in PSAGN patients the levels, although not significantly elevated at acute stage, increased significantly at convalescent stage. These results suggest that hyperproduction of C3 by PBM in both hypoC3 disorders is likely due to activation of the cells by not yet determined antigens or immune complexes, but the effects of T cells on the activated PBM in MPGN differ from in PSAGN patients probably due to distinct antigens or immune complexes."

Infection with GBS was defined by a positive blood culture while colonisation was defined by GBS cultured from any other site. The combination of infection and colonisation was used as the gold standard for the LA test. Although the LA test had a sensitivity of 90%, the specificity was only 70%, the positive predictive value 12% and the false positive rate 30%. The overall accuracy was only 71%.

We propose a framework of measures for the quantitative assessment of correspondences between different typing methods as a first step to the global mapping of type equivalences. A collection of 325 macrolide-resistant Streptococcus pyogenes isolates associated with pharyngitis cases in Portugal was used to benchmark the proposed measures. All isolates were characterized by macrolide resistance phenotyping, T serotyping, emm sequence typing, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), using SmaI or Cfr9I and SfiI. A subset of 41 isolates, representing each PFGE cluster, was also characterized by multilocus sequence typing (MLST). The application of Adjusted Rand and Wallace indices allowed the evaluation of the strength and the directionality of the correspondences between the various typing methods and showed that if PFGE or MLST data are available one can confidently predict the emm type (Wallace coefficients of 0.952 for both methods). In contrast, emm typing was a poor predictor of PFGE cluster or MLST sequence type (Wallace coefficients of 0.803 and 0.655, respectively). This was confirmed by the analysis of the larger data set available from http://spyogenes.mlst.net and underscores the necessity of performing PFGE or MLST to unambiguously define clones in S. pyogenes."
CD010502,0,3122461,0,Streptococcal outbreaks and erythrogenic toxin type A.,"Reference strains of Streptococcus pyogenes and strains from recent epidemics and sporadic cases of scarlet fever were examined for their ability to produce erythrogenic toxin type A (ET A) by ELISA and double immunodiffusion (Ouchterlony) using an anti-ET A antibody purified by affinity chromatography. Of the reference strains (most of them isolated before 1945) 16/51 produced more or less ET A (Table 1). ET A synthesis is strain-specific, but not type-specific. Well-known toxin producers like the strains NY-5; 594 or ""Smith"" produce up to 16.000 micrograms/l under optimal culture conditions. Type 3 strains isolated from scarlet fever patients during the outbreak 1972/73 seem to belong to one clone as evidenced by the uniform SDS-PAGE pattern: They were found to produce 5-200 micrograms/l (mean 68 micrograms/l) ET A only. Type 3 strains from sporadic cases, isolated 10 years later, produced 0-138 micrograms/l (mean 30 micrograms/l). Strains of the type 1 clone, causing the epidemic in 1982/83 produced only 0.75-10 micrograms/l (mean 8 micrograms/l) ET A (Table 3). Only a few strains of S. pyogenes isolated 1984 or later synthesized ET A but they were found more often to produce ET B (proteinase precursor) in batch cultures. S. pyogenes strains seem to have lost their ability to produce large amounts of ET A during the last decades. Because this toxin must be considered as a pathogenicity factor the decrease in toxin production may be one reason for the present mild form of scarlet fever."

The site of insertion of Tn917 into the chromosome and the surrounding sequence, the pel region (pleiotropic effect locus), was determined. Phage A25 transduction confirmed that the pleiotropic changes in phenotype could be cotransduced with Tn917. The pel region was cloned and sequenced, and the transposon was found to be inserted upstream of a single open reading frame which led to a failure to transcribe a 500-base mRNA. The loss of this transcript decreased the transcription of emm and speB genes and reduced the secretion of streptokinase. Enhanced Pel expression from a nisin-inducible plasmid resulted in increased message levels for emm in a wild-type organism. Characterization of the pel mutant provides evidence for the coordinated regulation of secreted and surface proteins and suggests the existence of a new global regulatory factor in S. pyogenes."

Three enzymes were necessary to increase the discrimination of ribogroups formed by each enzyme. A total of 40 ribogroups and 38 emm sequences (not counting allelic variations) were identified. Multilocus sequence typing was performed on a sampling of the isolates, and those results were consistent with those of both emm typing and ribotyping. Correlations were observed among all three methods."
CD010502,0,12950680,0,Selective response of dermal Th-1 cells to 20-50 kDa streptococcal cell-wall proteins in chronic plaque psoriasis.,"We have recently described a dermal Th-1 subset in skin lesions of psoriasis which recognizes cell-wall extract isolated from group A streptococci (GAS). As a first step in the identification of the streptococcal proteins involved, dermal T-cell lines (TCL) cultured from the lesional skin of 12 human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-typed psoriasis patients were stimulated with GAS cell-wall extract and 14 fractions (MWt approximately 20-100 kDa) separated from the cell-wall extract by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and electroelution, stained for intracellular interferon-gamma(IFN-gamma) expression and analysed by flow cytometry. All the TCL responded to GAS cell-wall extract to varying extents (3.5-27.6% IFN-gamma+). This response was consistently directed against 20-50 kDa cell-wall fractions and inhibited by anti-HLA-DR antibody. TCL with higher responses to GAS cell-wall extract recognized a larger number of fractions within this range than the lower responder TCL. No difference between the level and pattern of response to the fractions was observed for TCL from HLA-DR7+ (n = 6) and HLA-DR7- (n = 6) individuals. This preliminary study has shown a selective response to lower MWt proteins expressed on GAS cell wall by skin Th-1 cells in psoriasis. Further studies are required to identify the proteins involved."

Sections from neonatal necropsies in which postmortem lung cultures were positive for group B streptococci showed positively stained intra- and extra-cellular cocci in the alveolar exudate. Many hyaline membranes contained intact organisms whereas some membranes showed only diffuse positive staining. One case of neonatal death was evaluated in which there was a clinical diagnosis of group B streptococcal infection, but postmortem cultures were not obtained. Group B streptococci were identified in the lung by the PAP method. This method may be of assistance in the postmortem evaluation of certain infectious diseases such as those due to group B streptococci."

A search of aa sequence databases identified four additional proteins with > 50% similarity to this consensus sequence. All of these proteins demonstrated protein G-inhibitable IgG3-binding activity. Taken together, these results identify a signature sequence that predicts the presence of a protein G-inhibitable IgG3-binding domain(s) in group-A streptococcal IgG-binding proteins."
CD010502,0,11962613,0,Application of immuno-mass spectrometry to analysis of a bacterial virulence factor.,"Here we describe a novel antibody-based assay that combines specificity of antibody with precision of mass spectral analysis. The assay is carried out in three steps using a single antigen capture and transfer reagent. The first step of the assay involves antibody immobilization. The second step is antigen capture and washing to remove unbound proteins. The third step involves the analysis of the captured antigens by surface enhanced laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The assay is facilitated by the ability of a single nonviable bacterial preparation expressing immunoglobulin-binding proteins that enable antibody immobilization, specific capture of fluid-phase antigen, and direct sample transfer to a protein chip for mass spectral analysis. Proof-of-concept studies using a model Streptococcus pyogenes virulence factor, the secreted cysteine protease SpeB, are presented."
CD010502,0,11123326,0,Borrelia burgdorferi and other bacterial products induce expression and release of the urokinase receptor (CD87).,"The urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR, CD87) is a highly glycosylated 55- to 60-kDa protein anchored to the cell membrane through a glycosylphosphatidylinositol moiety that promotes the acquisition of plasmin on the surface of cells and subsequent cell movement and migration by binding urokinase-type plasminogen activator. uPAR also occurs in a soluble form in body fluids and tumor extracts, and both membrane and soluble uPAR are overexpressed in patients with tumors. uPAR may be a factor in inflammatory disorders as well. We investigated whether Borrelia burgdorferi could stimulate up-regulation of cell membrane uPAR in vitro. B. burgdorferi, purified native outer surface protein A, and a synthetic outer surface protein A hexalipopeptide stimulated human monocytes to up-regulate membrane uPAR as measured by immunofluorescence/FACS and Western blot. The presence of soluble uPAR in culture supernatants, measured by Ag capture ELISA, was also observed. LPS from Salmonella typhimurium and lipotechoic acid from Streptococcus pyogenes also induced the up-regulation of both membrane and soluble uPAR protein by monocytes. Up-regulation of uPAR was induced by conditioned medium from B. burgdorferi/monocyte cocultures. The up-regulation of uPAR by B. burgdorferi was concomitant with an increase in uPAR mRNA, indicating that synthesis was de novo. The expression and release of uPAR in response to B. burgdorferi and other bacterial components suggests a role in the pathogenesis of Lyme disease as well as in other bacterial infections."

CD010502,0,17242788,0,Production of monoclonal antibodies against Streptococcus mutans antigens.,"Several studies have been conducted in the last decades aiming to obtain an anti-caries vaccine, however some studies have demonstrated cross reactivity between Streptococcus mutans surface antigens and the human cardiac tissue. In this work, the reactivity of five anti-Streptococcus mutans monoclonal antibodies (MoAb) (24A, 56G, C8, E8 and F6) was tested against oral streptococci, cardiac antigens and skeletal and cardiac myosins, aiming to evaluate the specificity of these MoAb. The hybrid producers of immunoglobulins of the IgG2b class were cloned by limit dilution and expanded in vivo. MoAb were tested by ELISA. The hybrid 24A reacted with S. mutans CCT 1910, S. salivarius CCT 0365 and S. pyogenes T23. No reactivity difference was observed among the tested species. Cross reactivity with heart and cardiac myosin was not confirmed and only reaction with myosin of skeletal muscle was observed (p = 0.0381). The hybrid 56G reacted with all the tested microorganisms and there was statistically significant difference between S. mutans and S. pyogenes T23 (p < 0.001). This hybrid also reacted with myosin of skeletal muscle (p = 0.0095). C8, E8 and F6 presented low reactivity against oral streptococci strains and no reactivity against cardiac antigens. The data of this study showed that the 24A and 56G anti-S. mutans MoAb presented reactivity with S. pyogenes and S. salivarius, reinforcing the occurrence of common antigens between these species. The tested MoAb presented low cross-reactivity with myosin of skeletal muscle, but anti-heart activity could not be confirmed."

The recommended method for detecting GBS carriage in pregnant women is to culture vaginal and anorectal swabs in a selective broth medium and to subculture them onto blood agar. This method was compared with the use of GBS agar and GBS broth, both of which produce an orange pigment in response to GBS strains. A total of 319 women in labor were screened. Among the 638 specimens tested, 134 (21%) were positive in the selective Todd-Hewitt broth subcultured onto sheep blood agar, 133 (20.8%) were positive on the GBS agar and 126 (19.7%) were positive in the GBS broth. Altogether, 89 (27.9%) women in labor were found to be colonized with GBS; 87 (97.8%) of them were identified as carriers using the Todd-Hewitt broth, 87 (97.8%) with the GBS agar and 86 (96.6%) with the GBS broth. These results indicate that both GBS agar and GBS broth are reliable methods that can be used to screen for maternal and neonatal GBS colonization."

Seven hundred thirty-four strains of aerobic and facultatively anaerobic, catalase-negative, non-beta-hemolytic gram-positive cocci were tested for susceptibility to vancomycin (Vans) by a screening procedure and production of leucine aminopeptidase (LAPase) and pyrrolidonylarylamidase (PYRase) in disk tests. Three unique patterns of activity in response to the three disks (30 micrograms of vancomycin, PYRase, and LAPase) can be used to presumptively identify the vancomycin-resistant (Vanr) enterococci (Vanr and PYRase and LAPase positive), leuconostocs (Vanr and PYRase and LAPase negative), and pediococci (Vanr, PYRase negative, and LAPase positive). The results indicate that, together with Gram stain characteristics and the catalase test, the vancomycin, LAPase, and PYRase disk tests can be used to presumptively identify Vanr strains of enterococci as well as Leuconostoc and Pediococcus strains from human infections."
CD010502,0,18819445,0,[Studies on the possible application of molecular methods in diagnosing carriers and in similarity analysis of group B streptococci (Streptococcus agalactiae)].,"The most popular method of GBS identification in Poland currently is by culturing on enriched agar and verifying the Lancefield Group using special latex agglutination kits. However, the classical methods are time-consuming and their sensitivity is insufficient therefore it is becoming more common to try and apply molecular methods which are characterized by high sensitivity and rapid results. Moreover, molecular methods give us the possibility to carry out epidemiological investigations and gene detection, for instance for antibiotic resistance. It was confirmed that PCR and FISH procedures may be effective in rapid detection of GBS. Thanks to RAPD methods we showed that newborns born to colonized mothers were colonized by GBS strains which originated from the mother, irrespective of the way and the course of labour. Additionally, we detected GBS colonization in children who were born to mothers who were not colonized by GBS. These children were probably colonized with strains coming from hospital environment. More studies are needed to elucidate the route of transmission and the role of colonization of the medical staff. Using multiplex PCR we showed the presence of ermA, ermB and ermC genes in phenotypically confirmed MLS, GBS strains."
CD010502,0,3537652,0,Passive protection by human sera in mice against challenge with strains of group B streptococci.,"The passive protective activity of 100 human sera in mice challenged with strains of group B streptococci (GBS), types Ia, Ib, Ic, II and III, was investigated. The number of sera which offered protection against type strains III, II and Ib were 10, 6 and 1, respectively, while 5 sera gave protection against type strains Ia and Ic. The activity was 2-mercaptoethanol sensitive while anti-human IgG, IgA and IgM rabbit sera were capable of negating the protective activity. Furthermore, type antigens removed the protective activity, resulting in the reduction of the amounts of IgG, IgA and IgM in normal human serum. These findings suggest that the protective activity of human sera is related to specific immunoglobulins against type antigens of GBS."
CD010502,0,1889180,1,Evaluation of the modified Visuwell Strep-A enzyme immunoassay for detection of group-A Streptococcus from throat swabs.,"The modified Visuwell Strep-A enzyme immunoassay (EIA) was compared with culture for detection of group-A Streptococcus from throat swabs. Throat swabs in modified Stuarts medium obtained after culture at two institutions were tested in Visuwell. Cumulative results were n = 417, sensitivity 87.8%, specificity 89.9% predictive value positive (PVP) 67.9%, predictive value negative (PVN) 96.8%, and accuracy 89.5%. At another site, swabs were delivered to the laboratory without transport medium, cultured, and subsequently tested by Visuwell (n = 202, sensitivity 79.6%, specificity 84.5%, PVP 65.2%, PVN 91.9%, accuracy 83.2%). When 1+ culture-positive specimens were considered negative, the sensitivity and PVN increased from 79.6% to 90.2% and 91.9% to 97.1% respectively. Overall performance of the modified Visuwell was comparable with that of the initial assay for throat swabs transported with or without modified Stuarts medium. Cross reaction with organisms other than group-A Streptococcus normally found in the oropharynx was negligible in Visuwell and the limit of detection of group-A Streptococcus was 5 x 10(4) colony-forming units."

The methods compared were Wellcogen latex agglutination, Phadebact coagglutination, and counterimmunoelectrophoresis (CIE). We tested urine, with or without serum, and tracheal or gastric aspirates from 176 neonates admitted to Columbus Children's Hospital, with suspected GBS disease. Wellcogen and Phadebact were equally sensitive indicators of neonatal GBS sepsis (100%) as compared to CIE which was only 30% sensitive. CIE, however, did not produce any false-positives (100% specificity) while Phadebact coagglutination and Wellcogen latex agglutination were approximately 98% specific. As a side bar to the main study, we also set out to determine whether tracheal or gastric aspirates would be consistent and convenient sources of antigen as compared to urine. Consequently we determined that neither aspirate is a good source of antigen as performed by our method."
CD010502,0,8244925,0,Analysis of Streptococcus pyogenes promoters by using novel Tn916-based shuttle vectors for the construction of transcriptional fusions to chloramphenicol acetyltransferase.,"We have developed a series of shuttle vectors based on the conjugative transposon Tn916 that have been designed for the analysis of transcriptional regulation in Streptococcus pyogenes and other gram-positive bacteria. Designated the pVIT vectors (vectors for integration into Tn916), the vectors are small, stable plasmids in Escherichia coli to facilitate the fusion of promoters from cloned S. pyogenes genes to a promoterless gene which encodes chloramphenicol acetyltransferase. The vectors each contain one or more small regions of Tn916 to direct the integration of the transcriptional fusion into the transposon via homologous recombination following transformation of S. pyogenes or other suitable gram-positive hosts. Integration can be monitored by the inactivation or replacement of an antibiotic resistance determinant in modified derivatives of Tn916. Promoter activity can then be quantitated by the determination of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase-specific activity. In addition, since integration is into loci that do not disrupt the conjugative transpositional functions of Tn916, the vectors are useful for analysis of regulation in strains that are difficult or impossible to transform and can be introduced into these strains by conjugation following transformation of an intermediate host. The promoters for the genes which encode both the M protein and protein F of S. pyogenes were active in pVIT vectors, as was the region which controls transcription of mry, a trans-acting positive regulator of M protein expression. However, neither of the two characterized promoters for mry demonstrated activity when independently analyzed in pVIT-generated partial diploid strains, suggesting that regulation of mry is more complex than predicted by current models. The broad host range of Tn916 should make the pVIT vectors useful for analysis of regulation in numerous other bacterial species."

Bacterial cultures and rapid tests can allow for antibiotic prescription abstention in high-income regions. These techniques are not feasible in many low-resources settings, and antibiotics often are prescribed for any pharyngitis episode. However, judicious antibiotics prescription in the community also is of concern in low-income countries. The objective of this study was to develop a clinical decision rule that allows for the reduction of empirical antibiotic therapy for children with pharyngitis in low-resources settings by identifying non-group A streptococcus pharyngitis."

This group A latex reagent kit contains the reagents for the micronitrous acid extraction of throat swabs and does not require a centrifugation step in its protocol. There was a 99.3% (553 of 557) total agreement between the direct nitrous acid extraction-latex agglutination method and the standard culture method. The direct extraction method yielded an identification of 95.1% (78 of 82) of the group A streptococci identified by the standard method. Throat swabs used for standard culture may also be extracted with nitrous acid for the detection of group A antigen. A 5-min nitrous acid extraction destroys the viability of bacteria associated with normal throat flora as well as group A streptococci and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. This highly rapid method is simple to perform and requires no costly instrumentation. Accordingly, it would be most applicable in a hospital laboratory as well as in a physician's office."

Reference strain types 9 to 13, 15, 16, and 22 were isolated from diseased pigs, whereas types 17 to 19 and 21 came from clinically healthy pigs; type 14 was isolated from a human case of meningitis, and type 20 was isolated from a diseased calf. The group T streptococcus of de Moor has been included in the typing system as type 15. Two-way cross-reactions between types 6 and 16 and a one-way cross-reaction between types 2 and 22 have been demonstrated. In addition, several cross-reactions probably not due to capsular material were detected among different types by using the coagglutination test.

CD010502,0,17344934,0,Increased blood levels of IgG reactive with secreted Streptococcus pyogenes proteins in chronic plaque psoriasis.,"A pathogenic role for Streptococcus (S) pyogenes infections in chronic plaque psoriasis is suspected but poorly defined. We separated cellular and supernatant proteins from S. pyogenes cultures by high-resolution two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, and used immunoblotting to demonstrate the diversity of serum or plasma IgGs that react with elements of the proteome of this bacterium. We have shown that a substantial proportion of IgG-reactive proteins from cultured S. pyogenes are secreted. The total secreted protein fraction, including diverse IgG-binding elements, was subsequently used in an ELISA to measure blood titers of reactive IgG. This ELISA showed that blood samples from patients with chronic plaque psoriasis contained significantly higher titers of reactive IgG than samples from age- and sex-matched healthy controls (P=0.0009). In contrast, neither a standard assay measuring antistreptolysin O titers nor ELISAs measuring titers of IgG reactive with protein fractions from Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, were able to distinguish between blood samples from the two groups. These findings justify the hypothesis that S. pyogenes infections are more important in the pathogenesis of chronic plaque psoriasis than has previously been recognized, and indicate the need for further controlled therapeutic trials of antibacterial measures in this common skin disease."

CD010502,0,21048104,0,Superantigen-induced proliferation of human CD4+CD25- T cells is followed by a switch to a functional regulatory phenotype.,"Bacterial superantigens are potent T cell activators. In humans they cause toxic shock and scarlet fever, and they are implicated in Kawasaki's disease, autoimmunity, atopy, and sepsis. Their function remains unknown, but it may be to impair host immune responses increasing bacterial carriage and transmission. Regulatory (CD25(+)FOXP3(+)) T cells (Tregs) play a role in controlling inflammatory responses to infection. Approximately 2% of circulating T cells are naturally occurring Tregs (nTregs). Conventional Ag stimulation of naive FOXP3(-) T cells induces Ag-specific Tregs. Polyclonal T cell activation has been shown to produce non-Ag-specific Tregs. Because superantigens are unique among microbial virulence factors in their ability to trigger polyclonal T cell activation, we wanted to determine whether superantigen stimulation of T cells could induce non-Ag-specific Tregs. We assessed the effect of superantigen stimulation of human T cells on activation, regulatory markers, and cytokine production by flow cytometry and T cell suppression assays. Stimulation of PBMCs with staphylococcal exotoxin A and streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins A and K/L resulted in dose-dependent FOXP3 expression. Characterization of this response for streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin K/L confirmed its Vβ specificity, that CD25(+)FOXP3(+) cells arose from CD25(-) T cells and required APCs. These cells had increased CTLA-4 and CD127 expression, typical of the recently described activated converted Treg-like cells, and exhibited functional suppressor activity comparable to nTregs. Superantigen-stimulated CD25(+)FOXP3(+) T cells expressed IL-10 at lower superantigen concentrations than was required to trigger IFN-γ production. This study provides a mechanism for bacterial evasion of the immune response through the superantigen induction of Tregs."

R protein was extracted with 1% trypsin from cells grown in a semidefined medium. The extracts were tested by immunodiffusion in agarose with a panel of antisera for detection and precise identification of the four species of R protein described by Wilkinson. R antigen was present in 49 of 131 (37%) of the strains tested. Analysis by serotype revealed that 0 of 2 type Ia, 0 of 11 Ib, 1 of 16 (6%) Ia/c, 12 of 15 (80%) II, 0 of 20 II/c, 35 of 49 (71%) III, 0 of 6 IV, and 1 of 12 (8%) nontypeable strains produced R antigen. Production of the R protein and the trypsin-resistant or alpha component of the c protein appeared to be mutually exclusive. R antigen was more prevalent in isolates from blood (50%) than in those from mucosal sites (27%) for type II strains; no difference was seen for type III strains from these sites. Concordant results were obtained with five paired body fluid-mucosal surface isolates from individual patients and with isolates from 17 mother-baby pairs. The most frequent species of R antigen was R4 (45 of 49), followed by R1 (4 of 49). These two species of R protein were biochemically (trypsin resistant and pepsin sensitive) and immunologically identical to the R-protein antigens produced by prototype strains of groups A, B, and C streptococci."

Although each test could be performed relatively quickly, the ease of performance and level of sensitivity (10(5) to 10(8) CFU/ml) varied markedly. Quantitative cultures obtained from 17 known GBS carriers showed concentrations ranging from less than 10(2) to greater than 10(8) CFU/gm of vaginal material. Since only 40% of the women had greater than or equal to 10(5) CFU/gm of vaginal material, it appears that many colonized women would not be identified by these rapid tests."

Undiluted and concentrated urine specimens were unsuitable for LA because of the many false-positive reactions that resulted from nasal carriage of H. influenzae type b and nasal carriage of the cross-reactive S. pneumoniae type 6. CIE for the detection of H. influenzae type b had a sensitivity of only 44% (four of nine) in concentrated urine."
CD010502,0,8077715,0,Relation between low capacity of human sera to inhibit streptococcal mitogens and serious manifestation of disease.,"The proliferative response of lymphocytes induced by a new streptococcal mitogenic factor (MF) and the streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins (Spe) A and B was determined in sera from 6 healthy persons. Responses were compared to those obtained from reference serum that lacked mitogen-specific ELISA antibodies. The sera showed individual variations in the levels of MF- and Spe-specific antibodies, as determined by ELISA. The experiments showed that most human sera, which contained mitogen-specific antibodies, could neutralize the mitogenicity of the proteins. However, there were sera that contained mitogen-specific antibodies but that did not inhibit the toxin-induced proliferation. Thus, the ELISA antibody titer did not always equal the neutralizing capacity. Sera from 27 patients with group A streptococcal bacteremia had significantly lower neutralizing ability against MF and SpeB than did sera from 25 uncomplicated tonsillitis cases."

CD010502,0,8207299,0,Cloning and nucleotide sequence of type 3 M protein gene (emm3) consisting of an N-terminal variable portion and C-terminal conserved C repeat regions: relation to other genes of Streptococcus pyogenes. Streptococcal Diseases Study Group.,"The structural gene for type 3 M protein of Streptococcus pyogenes, which consists of an N-terminal variable portion and C-terminal conserved repeat regions, has been cloned by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with two primers (K-1 and K-2). They were selected from the best conserved region of the leader sequences and of the C-terminal portion near the Hexapeptide (LPSTGE) sequence found in different M proteins. From the nucleotide sequence of the product, 1645 base pairs were determined, including 32 amino acids of the leader sequences, the complete N-terminal variable region and the conserved C repeat region. Analysis of the deduced amino acids of the sequence revealed the existence of two major repeat regions, the B and C repeat regions. Comparison of the C-repeat regions among M3 and other M proteins showed them to be more than 90% identical. The two B repeat blocks in M3 protein are also similar to those in M12 protein. Predictive secondary structure analysis of M3 protein reveals a strong alpha-helical potential. The algorithm also shows that the beta-sheet and turn potential for region 23-42 in M3 protein are similar to those for region 28-50 in M12 protein. The results indicate that M3 protein is closely related to M12 protein."

Types 6 and 24, but not type 18, M protein were found to mediate attachment of GAS to soft palate or skin keratinocytes, but this interaction was prevented by the hyaluronic acid capsule on highly encapsulated, or mucoid, strains. Monoclonal antibody to CD44, the principal hyaluronic acid-binding receptor on keratinocytes, inhibited attachment of both highly encapsulated and poorly encapsulated wild type strains of GAS, but not the attachment of acapsular mutants. Transfection of K562 cells with cDNA encoding human CD44 conferred the capacity to bind each of six wild-type strains of GAS, but not to bind acapsular mutants. Because, in contrast to other potential adhesins, the group A streptococcal capsule is both highly conserved and surface-exposed, it may serve as a universal adhesin for attachment of diverse strains of GAS to keratinocytes of the pharyngeal mucosa and the skin."

CD010502,0,18779749,0,Lysates of S. pyogenes serotype M49 induce pancreatic tumor growth delay by specific and unspecific antitumor immune responses.,"Treatment of pancreatic cancer by active unspecific bacterial immunotherapy is a promising new strategy. Recently, we showed that a single intratumoral injection of wildtype Streptococcus pyogenes M49 results in complete regression of pancreatic carcinoma in mice mediated both by unspecific cytotoxicity and by specific immune reactions against tumor cells. As for potential clinical use, conditioning and especially inactivation of bacteria would abolish the risk of systemic bacterial infections; we here explored the potential of a streptococcal lysate prepared by bacteriophage lysine to affect pancreatic carcinoma growth in vivo. Application of the lysate into established Panc02 tumors resulted in pronounced growth cessation accompanied by raises in levels of circulating monocytes, granulocytes, and natural killer cells. Detailed analysis of splenocyte subsets revealed lysate-induced transient increases in pre-B cells followed by raised levels of activated T cells. Moreover, blood levels of proinflammatory, T helper-1-type cytokines were significantly elevated. These systemic immunologic effects were accompanied by massive infiltrations of cytotoxic T cells into the tumors. Concomitantly, lymphocytes obtained from treated mice specifically recognized Panc02 tumor cells in IFN-gamma-enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot and in cellular cytotoxicity assays. In rechallenge experiments, these immunologic effector cells were found to delay, but not completely prevent growth of secondary tumors. However, when considering the notoriously depressed immune status of individuals suffering from pancreatic carcinoma, the orchestrated antitumoral immune responses we analyzed here in detail significantly strengthen the potential usefulness of microbial compounds as active unspecific immunotherapeutic agent for treatment of pancreatic carcinoma."
CD010502,0,6234370,0,Suppression of cellular reactivity to group A streptococcal antigens in patients with acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis.,"Lymphocyte reactivity to group A streptococcal antigens was studied in patients with acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (AGN) in Trinidad. When compared with controls, patients with AGN had significantly lower responses. This finding was most prominent in the patients who were greater than 10 years of age at onset of disease. The total number of T lymphocytes was found to be decreased in patients with AGN, and in particular, the percentage of cells bearing Fc receptors for IgG (T gamma) was low. Removal of the T gamma-cell population abrogated the lymphocyte response to streptococcal antigens. However, removal of the adherent cells resulted in enhancement of the response to the level of the normal control population. The presence of suppressor activity in the adherent cell population of older patients with AGN may be an important factor in progression of AGN to chronic disease."

High frequency internalization of cultured epithelial cells by the M1inv+ strain 90-226 is dependent upon the M1 protein. Invasion of HeLa cells was blocked by an anti-M1 antibody, invasion by an M1- strain (90-226 emm1::km) was greatly reduced, and latex beads bound to M1 protein were readily internalized by HeLa cells. Beads coated with a truncated M1 protein were internalized far less frequently. Scanning electron microscopy indicated that streptococci invade by a zipper-like mechanism, that may be mediated by interactions with host cell microvilli. Initially, internalized streptococci and streptococci undergoing endocytosis are associated with polymerized actin. Later in the internalization process, streptococcal-containing vacuoles are associated with the lysosomal membrane glycoprotein, LAMP-1."

CD010502,0,14632102,0,Acute streptococcal pharyngitis in pediatric medicine: current issues in diagnosis and management.,"Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS) is the most common bacterial cause of acute pharyngitis. Although children infected with GABHS will recover clinically without antibiotics, treatment is recommended in order to prevent acute rheumatic fever and probably suppurative complications, hasten resolution of clinical signs and symptoms, and prevent transmission to close contacts. Streptococcal pharyngitis usually cannot be reliably distinguished from other etiologies on the basis of epidemiologic or physical findings, and therefore a throat culture or a rapid antigen detection test is generally necessary to confirm the diagnosis. All isolates of GABHS are sensitive to penicillins and cephalosporins, whereas resistance to macrolides has been identified in some geographic regions. The recommended first-line therapy for streptococcal pharyngitis is a 10-day course of penicillin V, usually given 2 or 3 times per day. A number of alternatives to penicillin V are available, including other penicillins, macrolides, and cephalosporins. As a class, the cephalosporins are noteworthy because they may provide somewhat higher bacteriologic eradication rates than penicillin V. Many cephalosporins can be administered twice daily, but they also must be given for 10 days. Two third-generation cephalosporins, cefdinir and cefpodoxime proxetil, are approved for use in a more convenient 5-day dosing schedule, thus possibly increasing the likelihood of adherence to the full course of therapy. Palatability is also an important consideration when prescribing antibiotics to children. In a series of studies, children preferred the pleasant strawberry-cream taste of cefdinir to that of amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefprozil, and azithromycin. Cefdinir may offer an alternative to penicillin V for children with streptococcal pharyngitis, particularly when compliance is a clinical concern."
CD010502,0,2445730,0,Streptococcus pyogenes type 12 M protein gene regulation by upstream sequences.,"A partial nucleotide sequence that included 1,693 base pairs of the M12 (emm12) gene of group A streptococci (strain CS24) and adjacent upstream DNA was determined. Type 12 M protein-specific mRNA of strain CS24 is transcribed from two promoters (P1 and P3) separated by 30 bases. The transcription start sites of the emm12 gene were located more than 400 bases downstream of a deletion that causes decreased M-protein gene transcription in strain CS64. Deletion analysis of M protein-expressing plasmids indicated that an upstream region greater than 1 kilobase is required for M-protein gene expression. The M-protein gene transcriptional unit appears to be monocistronic. Analysis of the emm12 DNA sequence revealed three major repeat regions. Two copies of each repeat, A and B, existed within the variable 5' end of the gene; repeat C demarcated the 5' end of the constant region shared by emm12 and emm6."
CD010502,0,17513792,0,Tubulin is a neuronal target of autoantibodies in Sydenham's chorea.,"Sydenham's chorea is a CNS disorder and sequela of group A streptococcal infection where deposition of Abs in brain may result in movement and neuropsychiatric abnormalities. We studied human mAbs 24.3.1, 31.1.1, and 37.2.1 derived from chorea and selected for cross-reactivity with group A streptococci and brain Ags. Our novel findings reveal that Sydenham's chorea mAbs target a 55-kDa brain protein with an N-terminal amino acid sequence of MREIVHLQ corresponding to beta-tubulin. Chorea mAb specificity for purified brain tubulin was confirmed in ELISA and Western immunoblot, and significant levels of anti-tubulin IgG were found in acute chorea sera and cerebrospinal fluid. Lysoganglioside G(M1) inhibited binding of chorea mAbs to tubulin and mAb reactivity with human caudate and putamen brain sections was blocked by anti-tubulin mAb. The chorea mAbs labeled both intra- and extracellular Ags of a neuronal cell line providing evidence suggesting mimicry between intracellular brain protein tubulin and extracellular lysoganglioside. In addition, chorea mAb 24.3.1 and acute chorea sera induced calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II activity in human neuronal cells. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the chorea mAb V(H) genes revealed that mAb 24.3.1 V(H) gene was encoded by the V(H)1 germline gene family which encodes other anti-ganglioside V(H) genes associated with motor neuropathies. mAb recognition of tubulin and the neuronal cell surface with initiation of cell signaling and dopamine release supports an emerging theme in autoimmunity whereby cross-reactive or polyreactive autoantibodies against intracellular Ags recognize cell surface epitopes potentially leading to disease."

CD010502,0,17470542,0,Recombinant group B streptococcus Beta C protein and a variant with the deletion of its immunoglobulin A-binding site are protective mouse maternal vaccines and effective carriers in conjugate vaccines.,"Immunogenic vaccines against group B Streptococcus (GBS) have been created by coupling the GBS capsular polysaccharides (CPS) to carrier proteins. The GBS beta C protein (BCP) serves as an effective carrier while inducing protective immunity against BCP-expressing strains. BCP also binds human immunoglobulin A (IgA), a characteristic that may be undesirable for use in humans. Here, we examined the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of a recombinant GBS BCP (rBCP), an rBCP modified to eliminate its IgA-binding site (rBCP(DeltaIgA)), and their corresponding GBS serotype III CPS conjugates (III-rBCP and III-rBCP(DeltaIgA)). Deletion of the IgA-binding site or conjugation to CPS did not alter antigenic BCP epitopes. Recombinant proteins and conjugates elicited specific, high-titered IgG in mice. Antisera to rBCP, rBCP(DeltaIgA), III-rBCP, and III-rBCP(DeltaIgA) opsonized GBS strains A909 (Ia/BCP(+)) and H36B (Ib/BCP(+)) for killing by HL-60 cells; antiserum to III-rBCP and III-rBCP(DeltaIgA) also opsonized strain M781 (III/BCP(-)). Vaccination of female mice with either rBCP or rBCP(DeltaIgA) protected approximately 40% of their pups challenged with GBS strain A909. Pups born to III-rBCP- or III-rBCP(DeltaIgA)-vaccinated dams survived at rates of 56% and 66%, respectively. Over 90% of pups born to dams that received the type III CPS conjugates survived challenge with GBS strain M781. In summary, rBCP and rBCP(DeltaIgA) proteins and the conjugates containing them were immunogenic in mice, inducing both CPS- and protein-specific functional IgG. These results suggest that the rBCP(DeltaIgA) could be used as a carrier to augment the immunogenicity of the CPS while expanding coverage to GBS strains bearing BCP."
CD010502,0,16971645,1,Performance of rapid streptococcal antigen testing varies by personnel.,"Rapid carbohydrate antigen tests are frequently used to diagnose group A streptococcal (GAS) pharyngitis. Despite evidence of modest sensitivity in medical settings, rapid antigen tests are available to the public for self-testing. We sought to determine if the personnel performing a rapid streptococcal antigen test influence the test's performance characteristics. Throat swabs of pediatric patients performed for GAS pharyngitis in a tertiary-care children's hospital network were included during two study periods in 2004 and 2005. The performance characteristics of a rapid carbohydrate antigen test were evaluated in three clinical settings against a nucleic acid probe test method according to the personnel performing the test (laboratory technologist versus nonlaboratory personnel). Between the study periods, nonlaboratory personnel from one site underwent retraining. Subsequently, the performance characteristics of the rapid antigen test were reassessed. The sensitivity of the rapid antigen test varied widely among the different testing sites (56 to 90%). Notably, test sensitivity was consistently greater when the test was performed by laboratory technologists than when it was performed by nonlaboratory personnel (P < 0.0001). Although the rapid antigen test sensitivity significantly improved after nonlaboratory personnel at one testing site were retrained (sensitivity before versus after retraining; P < 0.0001), the sensitivity remained greater in the laboratory technologist cohort (P < 0.0001). These data confirm the important relationship of the operator performing a rapid streptococcal antigen test with the test's accuracy, even in a clinical setting, where operator training is mandated. Therefore, its use outside the medical setting by lay persons cannot be recommended without culture backup."

Ulterior data on the comparison of 2 methods (streptozyme and antistreptolysin O].,"Increasingly thorough analysis of the antigen structures of Group A beta-haemolytic streptococci has revealed the presence of antigen components with differentiated immune responses in relation to common streptococcal conditions. It is therefore extremely useful in laboratory practice to have a multiple antigen that reveals the immune response to a streptococcal infection so that we can study the serological behaviour of individual streptococcal pictures with their complications and sequelae. Research conducted to date indicates that the streptozyme test can explore the five main streptococcal isoenzymes both for rapid screening and for the quantification of the degree of antibody response. This is confirmed by the results obtained by numerous Authors over the past 15 years, results that demonstrate the high sensitivity of STZ (Streptozyme) at antibody level that single antibody reactions are apparently not capable of revealing. The polyvalent antigen represented by STZ seems to be the best tool for the demonstration of responses to the individual isoenzymes of the very numerous streptococcal strains in circulation (Group A, C and G beta-haemolytics). The possibility of using microtiter techniques for serum assays is also emphasised. These techniques have given repeatable results and are also easy to read."

A correct diagnosis by clinical criteria is only achievable in 72% of patients with streptococcal pharyngitis. Additional criteria such as diagnosis by culture are, therefore, mandatory. Time is a major disadvantage of traditional culture methods. Slide agglutination tests show an acceptable sensitivity of 92% and a specificity of 93%. Due to the possibility of false negative test results, with consequent withholding of adequate antimicrobial chemotherapy, these test results should be used only as a valuable guide.

CD010502,0,10759357,0,Group A streptococci in the 1990s.,"The last decade has witnessed a remarkable change in the epidemiology of group A streptococcal infections. There has been a marked increase globally in the reporting of invasive infections caused by Streptococcus pyogenes, Lancefield group A streptococci. Many of these cases were deep-seated infections associated with shock and multi-organ failure and are defined as streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. In addition, reports of streptococcal sequelae, in particular, acute rheumatic fever, have re-emerged and remain a serious health threat in developed countries. It appears that these infections are related to the type distributions of the organism among the general population, with the re-emergence of more 'virulent' strains, such as the M1 serotype which in earlier decades was primarily seen in cases of either superficial disease or scarlet fever. Population-based surveillance studies have clearly indicated the importance and relevance of type identification for epidemiological purposes. There have also been suggestions that certain extracellular products and toxins play a major role in the so-called 'increased virulence' of the organism; these include cell surface molecules such as the M protein, opacity factor, the hyaluronic acid capsule, C5a peptidase and streptococcal inhibitor of complement (SIC), in addition to secreted proteins, pyrogenic exotoxins, cysteine proteinase, streptolysins O and S, hyaluronidase, streptokinase and other enzymes. All these factors, and events during the last decade, strongly emphasize the need for a better understanding of the epidemiology, pathogenesis, treatment and prevention of group A streptococcal infections."

Patients were recruited based on the presence of pharyngitis, no antibiotic therapy in the preceding 2 weeks, and a positive latex agglutination (LA) for group A beta hemolytic streptococci (GABHS) antigen on pharyngeal swab. Diagnosis was confirmed by positive GABHS culture on blood agar plates. Twenty-five of these children were also tested for GABHS antigen by enzyme-linked immunoassay (EIA). After 18-24 hours of oral antibiotic therapy, only 10 patients had a positive test for GABHS on throat swab. Five of 29 subjects (17%) remained positive by blood agar plate (BAP) culture, eight of 29 (29%) by LA, and four of 23 (17%) by EIA. GABHS antigen was undetectable by LA or EIA in the urines of any of these patients, either prior to or after initiation of treatment, even in specimens concentration as high as 100 fold. Clinicians should routinely seek a history of prior antibiotic therapy in assessing pharyngitis. Neither of the kits tested are reasonably accurate for GABHS disease by detection of antigen in the pharynx after partial treatment or in the urine at any time."
CD010502,0,10499280,0,"SfbII protein, a fibronectin binding surface protein of group A streptococci, is a serum opacity factor with high serotype-specific apolipoproteinase activity.","Serum opacity factor (SOF) is produced by group A streptococci belonging to certain M types. SOF cleaves the apolipoprotein component of the high density lipoprotein fraction of serum rendering it insoluble which in turn leads to serum opacity. SfbII protein, a fibronectin binding surface protein cloned from group A streptococci, was obtained from a strain of M75. Here we show that this protein has a second functional domain responsible for SOF activity. The fibronectin binding region was located in the C-terminal end of the protein. Deletion analysis showed that the remainder of the protein was required for SOF activity. Sequence analysis of SfbII, when compared with the published sequence of SOF22, showed 99% identity with a difference of only four amino acids. In spite of this high homology, SOF from M75 was type-specific and antibody evoked specifically inhibited only SOF produced by M75. Antibodies found in human serum following natural infection also inhibited the SOF of SfbII in a type-specific manner. The results showed that the SfbII protein from M75 is SOF with a high serotype-specific enzyme activity."

The deduced sequence of multiple Ig-binding proteins and M proteins were compared to distinguish between two evolutionary models. Did these functionally distinct genes originate in the distant past from duplication of a common ancestral gene and then functionally evolve independently or did they evolve more recently, one from the other by duplication of a fixed gene? Multiple alignments of conserved sequences of these proteins are consistent with the former hypothesis. Comparison of N termini of Ig-binding proteins revealed less diversity than that of the M proteins' N termini, suggesting that these proteins are under less selective pressure to change."

We have recently shown that GAS cell adhesion and biofilm formation is associated with the presence of pili on the surface of these bacteria. GAS pilus proteins are encoded in the FCT (Fibronectin-Collagen-T antigen) genomic region, of which nine different variants have been identified so far. In the present study we undertook a global analysis of GAS isolates representing the majority of FCT-variants to investigate the effect of environmental growth conditions on their capacity to form multicellular communities. For FCT-types 2, 3, 5 and 6 and a subset of FCT-4 strains, we observed that acidification resulting from fermentative sugar metabolism leads to an increased ability of the bacteria to form biofilm on abiotic surfaces and microcolonies on epithelial cells. The higher biofilm forming capacity at low environmental pH was directly associated with an enhanced expression of the genes encoding the pilus components and of their transcription regulators. The data indicate that environmental pH affects the expression of most pilus types and thereby the formation of multicellular cell-adhering communities that assist the initial steps of GAS infection."
CD010502,0,21491059,0,[Optimization of screening methodologies for the detection of Streptococcus agalactiae in pregnant women].,"Streptococcus agalactiae is a significant worldwide cause of morbidity and mortality in pregnant women and their newborn infants. The objective of this work was to determine the usefulness of bioMerieux chromogenic medium chromID Strepto B (CR) for detecting S. agalactiae in pregnant women from the selective Todd-Hewitt broth (sel-THB ) against the methods proposed by the CDC . A total of 1924 swabs were analyzed, 962 from vaginal introitus and 962 rectal, belonging to 962 women in weeks 35-37 of pregnancy. The swabs were directly seeded in CR. Both swabs were later placed in sel-THB with 15 µg/ml supplement of nalidixic acid and 10 µg/ml colistin. After 24 h of incubation, subcultures in CR medium and agar containing 5% sheep blood (SBA) were performed. The prevalence found was 17.4%. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of sel-THB subcultures with CR supplement and 48 h incubation were: 98.8, 100, 100 and 99.7%, respectively. The corresponding values of direct harvest of the sample were 57.8, 100, 100, and 90%, respectively. Sensitivity of sel-THB in SBA was 85%. Sel-THB subculture performance in CR was outstanding in comparison with the method proposed by the CDC."
CD010502,0,15213143,0,"Characterization of a complement-binding protein, DRS, from strains of Streptococcus pyogenes containing the emm12 and emm55 genes.","An extracellular protein of Streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcal inhibitor of complement (SIC), and its variant, called DRS (distantly related to SIC), are expressed by some S. pyogenes strains. SIC from type 1 (M1) isolates of S. pyogenes interferes with complement-mediated cell lysis, reportedly via its interaction with complement proteins. In this study we demonstrate that S. pyogenes strains carrying emm12 and emm55 (the genes for the M12 and M55 proteins, respectively) express and secrete DRS. This protein, like SIC, binds to the C6 and C7 complement proteins, and competition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay experiments demonstrate that DRS competes with SIC for C6 and C7 binding. Similarly, SIC competes with DRS for binding to the complement proteins. Despite this, the recombinant DRS preparation showed no significant effect on complement function, as determined by lysis of sensitized sheep erythrocytes. Furthermore, the presence of DRS is not inhibitory to SIC activity."

Exudative pharyngitis was more common in children whereas prolonged fever was more common in adults. Prominent lymphadenopathy and exudative pharyngitis, however, were less frequent in children with CMV mononucleosis than in those with EBV mononucleosis. Nevertheless, children with CMV mononucleosis are more likely to resemble those with EBV mononucleosis than adults with CMV mononucleosis."
CD010502,0,2809234,0,The presence of M proteins in outbreak strains of Streptococcus equisimilis T-type 204.,"Cultures of Streptococcus equisimilis (Lancefield group C) from three outbreaks of illness were found to carry the T-protein antigen 204. Strains of this type were not otherwise represented in a collection of 743 cultures of these 'pyogenes-like' streptococci isolated from other outbreaks of infection or as random isolates. Two of the three outbreaks were of pharyngitis. The third arose in a maternity unit where the organism was isolated from mothers with puerperal fever, from staff and also from the environment. Representative strains were found to carry M-protein antigens as judged by their ability to survive and multiply in fresh normal human blood. Comparison of absorbed rabbit antiserum to the M antigens in opsonic and precipitin tests showed that a distinct M antigen was present on isolates from one outbreak of sore throat and that all cultures from the other two incidents shared a common M antigen. Samples of serum were also available from patients in the outbreak of puerperal sepsis. Most patients developed antibodies to one or more streptococcal antigens including the M protein, streptolysin O, streptokinase and the hyaluronidase specific for strains of group C and group G streptococci."
CD010502,0,15502412,0,Consideration of cysteine protease activity for serological M-typing of clinical Streptococcus pyogenes isolates.,"Clinical isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes were classified by serological typing of their surface M protein. Non-M typeable strains with the emm1 gene were characterized as the degradation of M protein caused by overproduction of the extracellular cysteine protease, SpeB. These events are dependent on the growth phase. M protein produced prior to expression of SpeB is degraded in the stationary phase when the active form of SpeB is detected. The proteolytic degradation of M protein should be considered for precise M typing analysis."
CD010502,0,3083059,0,"Relationship between fibronectin and lymphoid cells in buccal mucosa, labial salivary glands and palatine tonsil.","The distribution of fibronectin in human buccal mucosa and labial salivary glands and its relationship to lymphoid cells was studied using an immunoperoxidase technique and monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies. In all specimens fibronectin was associated with basement membranes of epithelia, vascular endothelium and perineural sheaths. In histologically normal areas of buccal mucosa fibronectin was distributed as a sparse network in the superficial lamina propria. A more extensive network of fibronectin was found within the lamina propria of mucosal specimens infiltrated with T lymphocytes, whereas fibronectin was absent in areas occupied by B lymphocytes. A similar relationship between lymphocyte type and the presence of a fibronectin network was found in labial glands and palatine tonsil. Fibronectin was not detected within oral, salivary gland, tonsillar crypt or capsular epithelium."
CD010502,0,8992850,0,Age-related occurrence of inhibitory antibodies to streptococcal pyrogenic superantigens.,"Several bacteria, such as staphylococci and streptococci, can produce superantigens (SA) that induce the activation of T cells in humans. Although these organisms are the major causes of infection in children, the evidence that T cells are vigorously activated by SA produced by such organisms has not been reported except for toxic shock syndrome. In a previous paper, we demonstrated that inhibitory IgG antibodies (Ab) to SA in humans may protect against SA stimulation. In the present study, we investigated the occurrence of these inhibitory Ab to SA in 94 healthy children by the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay technique and the suppressive effect on T cell stimulation by SA. The positivity of Ab to streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin (SPE)-A, SPE-C and staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) increased with age. The age at which more than 50% of children exhibited Ab to SA was 1 year for SEB, 6 years for SPE-C and 11 years for SPE-A. Sera from these children were inhibitory to T cell proliferation elicited by SA in proportion to the concentration of IgG Ab to each SA. Sera supplemented with IgG Ab to SA by gamma-globulin therapy became inhibitory to T cell proliferation by SA. We conclude that, as children grow, they can develop Ab to SA that may play a role in protecting them against vigorous T cell activation by SA."
CD010502,0,15373909,0,Peripheral blood T cell responses to keratin peptides that share sequences with streptococcal M proteins are largely restricted to skin-homing CD8(+) T cells.,"The association of psoriasis with Streptococcus pyogenes throat infections suggests a potential antigenic target for the T cells that are known to infiltrate psoriatic skin. Streptococcal M protein share an extensive sequence homology with the human epidermal keratins. Keratin 17 (K17), while being mostly absent from uninvolved skin, is up-regulated in psoriatic lesions. Consequentially, M-protein-primed T cells may recognize up-regulated keratin epitopes via molecular mimicry. Using in vitro lymphocyte culture and cytokine flow cytometry we demonstrate that HLA-Cw*0602(+) psoriasis patients had significant CD8(+) T cell interferon (IFN)-gamma responses to peptides from the K17 and M6 protein selected on the basis of sequence homology and predicted HLA-Cw*0602 binding. These responses were about 10 times more frequent in the skin-homing cutaneous lymphocyte-associated antigen-expressing (CLA(+)) subset of CD8(+) T cells. CD4(+) T cells showed only borderline responses. CLA(+) CD8(+) T cells from Cw6(+) non-psoriatic individuals responded to some M6 peptides but rarely to K17 peptides. Cw6(-) psoriasis patients showed a response that was intermediate between Cw6(+) patients and controls. These findings indicate that psoriatic individuals have CD8(+) T cells that recognize keratin self-antigens and that epitopes shared by streptococcal M proteins and human keratins may be targets for the CD8(+) T cells that infiltrate psoriatic skin lesions."
CD010502,0,9712763,0,The specificity patterns of human immunoglobulin G antibodies in serum differ from those in autologous secretions.,"The specificity patterns of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies to streptococcal antigens in serum and autologous secretions were compared in order to determine whether IgG found in human secretions is exclusively of serum origin or can also be locally produced irrespective of the systemic immune system. Surface antigens from a type 6 M-protein strain of Streptococcus pyogenes were extracted by cell wall digestion and subjected to sodium lauryl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions. After being blotted onto nitrocellulose, the antigens were incubated with purified IgG from various body fluids: saliva, cervicovaginal secretions, seminal fluid, and colostrum. Binding was then revealed with labeled antibodies to human Fcgamma fragments. The antibody specificity patterns obtained by computer-assisted analysis were compared with those of paired sera. Major variations were observed between serum and secretions, as well as between different secretions from the same subject. These results are in favor of IgG-associated local immunity within different tissue compartments. This IgG response to mucosal antigens can complement that of secretory IgA in the defense against pathogens and should be taken into account during topical vaccinations."

CD010502,0,18708515,0,Differentiation of Streptococcus pneumoniae conjunctivitis outbreak isolates by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry.,"Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus [Pnc]) is a causative agent of many infectious diseases, including pneumonia, septicemia, otitis media, and conjunctivitis. There have been documented conjunctivitis outbreaks in which nontypeable (NT), nonencapsulated Pnc has been identified as the etiological agent. The use of mass spectrometry to comparatively and differentially analyze protein and peptide profiles of whole-cell microorganisms remains somewhat uncharted. In this report, we discuss a comparative proteomic analysis between NT S. pneumoniae conjunctivitis outbreak strains (cPnc) and other known typeable or NT pneumococcal and streptococcal isolates (including Pnc TIGR4 and R6, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes) and nonstreptococcal isolates (including Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus aureus) as controls. cPnc cells and controls were grown to mid-log phase, harvested, and subsequently treated with a 10% trifluoroacetic acid-sinapinic acid matrix mixture. Protein and peptide fragments of the whole-cell bacterial isolate-matrix combinations ranging in size from 2 to 14 kDa were evaluated by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. Additionally Random Forest analytical tools and dendrogramic representations (Genesis) suggested similarities and clustered the isolates into distinct clonal groups, respectively. Also, a peak list of protein and peptide masses was obtained and compared to a known Pnc protein mass library, in which a peptide common and unique to cPnc isolates was tentatively identified. Information gained from this study will lead to the identification and validation of proteins that are commonly and exclusively expressed in cPnc strains which could potentially be used as a biomarker in the rapid diagnosis of pneumococcal conjunctivitis."

CD010502,0,6408976,0,[Characterization of the antigen in circulating immune complexes and application to the detection of streptococcal antigens in human infectious endocarditis].,"Immune complexes from patients with subacute endocarditis were used to develop a methodology for characterization of the antigen involved in human circulating immune complexes. This model was chosen because it permits isolation of the causative agent of the streptococcal infection thought to contain the antigen present in the immune complex. A comparison was made between two methods for characterization of bacterial antigen bound to antibody. In the first, animals were immunized with purified immune complexes and the production of antistreptococcal antibodies was investigated. In the second method, a sandwich ELISA was developed, implying the double specificity of the immune complex (human immunoglobulin and streptococcal antigen). The latter method gave the best results, detecting antigen in the immune complexes of 8 out of 10 patients' sera. The application of this method to other immunopathological situations is discussed."
CD010502,0,3276665,0,Molecular evolution of streptococcal M protein: cloning and nucleotide sequence of the type 24 M protein gene and relation to other genes of Streptococcus pyogenes.,"The structural gene for the type 24 M protein of group A streptococci has been cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The complete nucleotide sequence of the gene and the 3' and 5' flanking regions was determined. The sequence includes an open reading frame of 1,617 base pairs encoding a pre-M24 protein of 539 amino acids and a predicted Mr of 58,738. The structural gene contains two distinct tandemly reiterated elements. The first repeated element consists of 5.3 units, and the second contains 2.7 units. Each element shows little variation of the basic 35-amino-acid unit. Comparison of the sequence of the M24 protein with the sequence of the M6 protein (S. K. Hollingshead, V. A. Fischetti, and J. R. Scott, J. Biol. Chem. 261:1677-1686, 1986) indicates that these molecules have are conserved except in the regions coding for the antigenic (type specific) determinant and they have three regions of homology within the structural genes: 38 of 42 amino acids within the amino terminal signal sequence, the second repeated element of the M24 protein is found in the M6 molecule at the same position in the protein, and the carboxy terminal 164 amino acids, including a membrane anchor sequence, are conserved in both proteins. In addition, the sequences flanking the two genes are strongly conserved."

The new types were designated st204, st211, st213, st809, st833, st854, st2904, st2911, st2917, st2926, st3757, st3765, and st6735. All isolates were susceptible to the antimicrobial agents tested, except to tetracycline. They all carried the speB gene, and 94.6% produced detectable SpeB. Most strains belonging to a given emm type had similar or highly related pulsed-field gel electrophoresis profiles that were distinct from profiles of strains of another type. The other characteristics were variable from isolate to isolate, although some associations were consistently found within some emm types. Unlike the other isolates, all type st213 isolates were speA positive and produced SpeA. Strains belonging to st3765 were T6 and opacity factor (OF) negative. Individual isolates within OF-positive emm types were associated with unique sof gene sequence types, while OF-negative isolates were sof negative by PCR. This report provides information on new emm sequence types first detected in GAS isolates from a geographic area not extensively surveyed. Such data can contribute to a better understanding of the local and global dynamics of GAS populations and of the epidemiological aspects of GAS infections occurring in tropical regions."
CD010502,0,11327431,0,Management of Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis.,"Bacteria are responsible for approximately 5 to 10 percent of pharyngitis cases, with group A beta-hemolytic streptococci being the most common bacterial etiology. A positive rapid antigen detection test may be considered definitive evidence for treatment; a negative test should be followed by a confirmatory throat culture when streptococcal pharyngitis is strongly suspected. Treatment goals include prevention of suppurative and nonsuppurative complications, abatement of clinical signs and symptoms, reduction of bacterial transmission and minimization of antimicrobial adverse effects. Antibiotic selection requires consideration of patients' allergies, bacteriologic and clinical efficacy, frequency of administration, duration of therapy, potential side effects, compliance and cost. Oral penicillin remains the drug of choice in most clinical situations, although the more expensive cephalosporins and, perhaps, amoxicillin-clavulanate potassium provide superior bacteriologic and clinical cure rates. Alternative treatments must be used in patients with penicillin allergy, compliance issues or penicillin treatment failure. Patients who do not respond to initial treatment should be given an antimicrobial that is not inactivated by penicillinase-producing organisms (e.g., amoxicillin-clavulanate potassium, a cephalosporin or a macrolide). Patient education may help to reduce recurrence."
CD010502,0,15768789,0,Immunity of tonsil and IgA nephropathy--relationship between IgA nephropathy and tonsillitis.,"Our study hypothesized that cytokines or chemokines induced in tonsils by infectious stimulations play an important role on the exacerbation of the glomerular injuries in patients with IgA nephropathy (IgAN). Tonsils from six patients with IgAN diagnosed by renal biopsy were studied after getting their written informed consents Tonsils from six patients with tonsil disorders with non-renal disorders were examined as controls. Tonsillar mononuclear cells (TMCs) were isolated and resuspended with RPMI 1640 with 10% FCS. These cells were incubated for 48 h with staphlococcus enterotoxin-B (SEB) or lipopolysaccaride (LPS). The levels of IL-6, IL-8, IL-12 and MCP-1 in the supernatants were measured by solid-phase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits. The actual cytokine concentrations were calculated by determining the standard curves. The experiments were performed in duplicate, and the mean value was calculated. We found that tonsillar mononuclear cells of IgA nephropathy produced mesangial proliferative chemokines (MCP-1, IL-8) in higher amounts compared to tonsils from non-IgA nephropathy. This result suggests that upper respiratory tract infections such as tonsillitis may be one of the risk factors of the aggravation in patients with IgA nephropathy."
CD010502,0,2521510,0,Cellular and biochemical responses of human T lymphocytes stimulated with streptococcal M proteins.,"Purified group A streptococcal M proteins, pep M5 and pep M6, bearing heart cross-reactive epitopes were compared with pep M24, which lacks such epitopes, in their ability to induce functional differentiation of human T lymphocytes. Lymphocytes activated by pep M5 and pep M6 demonstrated cytotoxic activity against cultured heart cells, whereas pep M24-activated cells differentiated into suppressor T cells, which specifically blocked cytotoxic T lymphocytes against cultured human myocardial cells and not NK cell activity against K562 cells. Pep M5 and not pep M24 induced an increase in the number of CD4, 4B4, helper/inducer T cells. In addition, these M proteins appear to induce different biochemical changes in T lymphocytes. Both pep M5 and pep M24 induced the phosphorylation of a 35-kDa cytoplasmic protein; however, only pep M5 induced the phosphorylation of a 28-kDa membrane protein, primarily in CD4 T cells. These data indicate that the virulent M protein Ag of group A streptococci may exert their effect on the human immune system via different mechanisms. Determining these mechanisms and the biochemical pathways involved in T cell differentiation triggered by these Ag may be important in understanding the pathogenesis of post-streptococcal diseases."

Immunological cross-reactivity between K. pneumoniae and bovine vitreous humour has been studied by 2 different antibody binding techniques: I125-labelled antigen binding assay with and without carrier, and beta-galactosidase enzyme-immunoassay. Sera from rabbits immunised with whole klebsiella micro-organisms or klebsiella extracts were found to bind labelled vitreous humour antigens to a greater extent (p less than 0.001) than sera from rabbits immunised with Escherichia coli, Streptococcus pyogenes, and phi X 174 virus or sera from the same rabbits before immunisation. It is suggested klebsiella micro-organisms may carry antigenic determinants which resemble vitreous humour antigens."
CD010502,0,2181100,0,Significance of a positive urine group B streptococcal latex agglutination test in neonates.,"We assessed the clinical significance of a reactive urine latex agglutination (LA) test in neonates without bacteriologically confirmed group B streptococcal (GBS) infection. In a retrospective review of a 3 1/2-month period, during which 367 urine specimens from newborn infants evaluated for suspected sepsis were tested by LA, 25 infants (6.9%) with sterile blood cultures but positive urine LA test results were compared with a control group of 112 infants with both blood cultures and urine LA test results negative for GBS. When the data were studied with stepwise discriminant analysis, the only variables significantly associated with a positive urine LA test result were immature to total neutrophil ratios greater than or equal to 0.16 at 0 and 12 hours. The influence of mucosal GBS colonization on urine LA test results was then investigated prospectively in 98 healthy infants (83 born to mothers colonized with GBS and 15 born to mothers with negative GBS cultures). Eight (8.2%) of the infants studied, or 8 of 52 (15.4%) infants colonized with GBS, had a positive urine LA test result. GBS was isolated from urine cultures of all infants with a positive urine LA test result. A positive urine LA test result was associated with positive GBS rectal and vaginal cultures and with increased density of colonization at those sites. We conclude that contamination of bag specimens of urine with GBS from perineal and rectal colonization may produce a positive urine LA test result in an infant with no systemic sign of infection."

CD010502,0,3523299,0,[Diagnostic problems in spontaneous bacterial peritonitis].,"In spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) the ascitic fluid culture (certain criterion of diagnosis) may be negative despite an evident clinical and biochemical picture. Therefore the diagnosis may be sometimes more ""probable"" than ""certain"". The authors performed a comparative analytical study--from a clinical, biochemical and prognostic point of view--between a group of 10 ""probable"" SBP (10 cirrhotic pts.) and 9 ""certain"" SBP (9 cirrhotic pts.). 115 ""normal ascitic fluids"" (negative culture in absence of any SBP-symptoms), collected from 82 cirrhotic pts., were used as control group. The ascitic concentration of white blood cells (WBC)/mmc and polymorphonuclear cells (PMN)/mmc was significantly different between the SBP and control group (p less than 0.001) and between the ""certain"" and ""probable"" SBP (p less than 0.02). The latter have a mean WBC and PMN/mmc count that is lower than the ""certain"" SBP and on the contrary a significantly higher ascitic glucose content (p less than 0.05). Probably that means a lower ascitic bacterial inoculum, which is below the threshold of detectability by current culture techniques. Serum laboratory tests showed no differences between the ""probable"" and the ""certain"" SBP groups, although, however they were worse than the control group. The symptoms and the prognosis resulted nearly the same in both groups. In spite of a high rate of recovery (57.9%) the global survival at the follow-up (10 +/- 5.2 months, range 6-19) was only 26.3%. The wide clinical, biochemical and prognostic overlap of the two groups leads us to consider as ""certain"" all the cases of ""probable"" SBP. Owing to the fact that only an early recognition and therapy are known to affect the prognosis significantly, the obvious conclusion is that in the SBP the suspicion is more important that the diagnostic certainty. Furthermore--in agreement with previous studies--the cutoff limit of 250 PMN/mmc has shown the best statistical diagnostic value for a rapid diagnosis (sensibility 100%, diagnostic accuracy 92.5%, negative predictive value 100%, likelihood ratio 1.9)."
CD010502,0,8483419,0,Positive transcriptional control of mry regulates virulence in the group A streptococcus.,"Transcription of the antiphagocytic M protein in the group A streptococcus (Streptococcus pyogenes) is environmentally regulated in response to CO2 and requires Mry, a trans-acting positive regulatory protein. We have examined the role of Mry in environmental regulation by analysing the factors that regulate expression of the gene that encodes Mry (mry). By employing a strategy that utilizes integrational plasmids, it was found that expression of mry requires the participation of DNA sequences that extend 473 base pairs upstream of the Mry coding region. Transcription of mry, as analysed in S1 nuclease protection assays, is initiated from two separate promoters located within this extended regulatory region. Construction and analysis of transcriptional fusions between the mry promoters and a promoterless chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene demonstrated that mry is autoregulated and environmentally regulated in response to the level of CO2. These data suggest a model for the regulation of virulence in S. pyogenes where positive transcriptional control of mry in response to environmental stimuli regulates the expression of the M protein."
CD010502,0,19095947,0,Elevated expressions of 15-lipoxygenase and lipoxin A4 in children with acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis.,"Anti-inflammatory effects of the 15-lipoxygenase (15-LO) derivatives lipoxin A(4) (LXA(4)) and 15-S-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15-S-HETE) have been documented in many experimental models of acute inflammation. However, the expression levels of 15-LO and its products in human renal diseases remain unknown. This study investigated the expression levels of LXA(4), leukotriene B(4) (LTB(4)), and 15-LO in leukocytes and glomeruli obtained from 22 children with acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (APSGN), and determined the modulatory effects of both 15-S-HETE and LXA(4) on LTB(4) synthesis in leukocytes and LTB(4)-evoked chemotaxis of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) obtained from children during the first 3 days after onset of APSGN. Expression levels of both LXA(4) and 15-LO in leukocytes and glomeruli were up-regulated during the acute phase of disease, further peaking between days 10 and 14, and remained increased after 6 to 8 weeks of APSGN onset. In contrast, blood and urinary levels of LTB(4) as well as the number of glomerular PMNs peaked during the acute phase of disease and then decreased during the resolution phase. Administration of both 15-S-HETE and LXA(4) in vitro inhibited LTB(4)-induced chemotaxis of PMNs and production of LTB(4) from leukocytes obtained from patients with APSGN. The current study provides further support for an anti-inflammatory role for 15-LO products in human nephritis through both antagonism and inhibition of leukotriene synthesis and its biological activity."
CD010502,0,2228225,0,Immunological cross-reactivity between Streptococcus mutans and human heart tissue examined by cross-immunization experiments.,"Hyperimmunization of rabbits with Streptococcus mutans or other related cariogenic streptococci sometimes induces serum antibodies that react with human heart muscle. To determine whether antigen I/II (AgI/II), a major surface protein antigen present in most human isolates of these organisms, was responsible for inducing cross-reactive antibodies, we tested it for antigenic similarity to heart components, exploiting the ability of immune systems to mount anamnestic responses to antigens previously encountered. Mice immunized with a strain of Streptococcus pyogenes type M6, known to be heart cross-reactive, or with intact S. mutans cells developed antibodies that could be detected on a human heart sarcolemmal preparation. However, mice immunized with AgI/II and boosted with sarcolemma were unable to develop significant antisarcolemmal antibodies attributable to prior sensitization by AgI/II. Similarly, AgI/II was unable to recall antisarcolemmal responses in mice previously immunized with sarcolemma. Nevertheless, strong immunoglobulin G antibody responses to AgI/II were detected at the single-cell level in spleens and as circulating antibodies in all mice immunized with AgI/II or AgI/II-bearing S. mutans. We conclude that the ability of S. mutans to induce heart-reactive antibodies is not due to antigenic similarity between AgI/II and components of human heart but may be caused by other cross-reactive antigens in the bacterial cells or by nonspecific stimulation of the immune system."
CD010502,0,15575308,0,Evaluation of recombinant antigens for the measurement of antibodies to streptolysin O and streptococcal DNase B on the Beckman Coulter IMMAGE system and comparison with a method employing conventional antigens.,"The performance of a newly devised method employing recombinant antigens for the determination of antibodies to streptolysin O and DNase B on the Beckman Coulter IMMAGE System was compared with a nephelometric assay using conventional antigens. Sera from 114 patients with or without evidence of streptococcal infection were analysed by the two techniques. The results obtained with the new method correlated well with those of the reference test. The sensitivity of a combination measurement of antibodies to streptolysin O and DNase B was higher than that obtained when measuring each parameter alone. Handling of the tests was easier on the Beckman Coulter IMMAGE System. In conclusion, the new test from Beckman Coulter for the measurement of antibodies to streptolysin O and DNase B performs well and equals measurements using conventional antigens on a nephelometer."

Cefixime Study Group].,"154 children aged 2 to 12 years with clinical diagnosis of bacterial pharyngitis and/or tonsillitis and--in most of the patients--a positive enzyme immunoassay for group A beta-hemolytic streptococci before therapy were enrolled in this open controlled randomized and multicenter trial. The children received either 8 mg/kg bodyweight cefixime once daily or 20,000 I.E. pencillin V/kg bodyweight t.i.d. Clinical evaluation and microbiological tests were carried out before treatment and 1-5 days after end of the treatment. 3-4 weeks after end of the treatment the rate of relapses was evaluated. The data of 149 children could be evaluated for clinical efficacy. In the cefixime group 93.3% of the children were cured and 6.7% improved compared to 89.2% and 10.8%, respectively, in the penicillin V group. Complete microbiological data were obtained from 136 patients. The eradication rate was 82.7% in the cefixime group and 77% in the group of patients treated with penicillin V. At follow up relapses were seen in 7 of the cefixime treated patients and in 6 of those receiving penicillin V. Mild side effects were reported by 4 patients in the cefixime group and by 3 children treated with penicillin V (1 drop out each). These results show that cefixime once daily is at least as effective as penicillin V t.i.d. in pharyngitis and tonsillitis in children. Both compounds are well tolerated."
CD010502,0,3881479,0,Clinical evaluation of a fluorescent antibody test for the serological diagnosis of streptococcal endocarditis.,"Serum fluorescent streptococcal antibody tests were carried out on 71 patients with clinically suspected infective endocarditis, and a final diagnosis of endocarditis was obtained in 46 patients. A serological diagnosis of streptococcal endocarditis was obtained in 10 patients who had persistently negative blood cultures, as fluorescent streptococcal antibody titres equal to or greater than 400 were detected against at least one of four strains of streptococci used as heterologous antigens. There were no false positive fluorescent antibody results with heterologous antigens during tests on 29 patients who had either non-streptococcal endocarditis, a final diagnosis other than endocarditis, or streptococcal sepsis not associated with endocarditis. A negative result with the heterologous antibody test could not, however, exclude a diagnosis of streptococcal endocarditis as six of 11 patients with endocarditis due to Streptococcus viridans or Str bovis confirmed on blood culture had serum fluorescent antibody titres less than 400 against all the heterologous streptococcal antigens tested. Homologous fluorescent streptococcal antibody titres equal to or greater than 400, using the patient's own blood culture isolate as the antigen, were found in the serum samples of 14 of 15 patients with endocarditis caused by viridans streptococci, three patients with enterococcal endocarditis, two patients with endocarditis caused by Str pneumoniae, and one patient with Str bovis endocarditis. In contrast, all five patients who had clinically insignificant streptococcal bacteraemias had serum fluorescent homologous antibody titres of only 100 or less. These results showed that the homologous serum fluorescent streptococcal antibody test could help to decide the clinical importance of a streptococcus which is initially isolated from only one or two of a number of inoculated blood culture bottles."

CD010502,0,1520765,0,"Superantigens, T cells, and microbes.","It is well recognized that toxins of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes are responsible for a wide range of clinical conditions, although their precise mode of action remains unclear. Recently, there has been a resurgence of interest in these toxins, now grouped with superantigens, because they cause profound alterations in the immune system homeostasis. Superantigens are molecules, including endogenous retroviral gene products and microbial toxins, that share a unique set of characteristics. They bind with high affinity to major histocompatibility complex class II at regions distinct from the conventional antigen binding groove and cause prolific activation or anergy of T cells with certain T cell receptor variable-region gene families. Whilst most of the superantigens described to date are products of bacteria or viruses, the presence of superantigens in parasites and their role in disease pathogenesis remain to be defined. It is probable that associations are present between superantigen-induced proliferation or anergy of peripheral blood T cells and clinical manifestations of human infectious diseases. The identification of these may pave the way toward a better understanding of disease pathogenesis and the possible development of newer immunotherapeutic regimes. This review summarizes the current thinking on microbial superantigens, their association with human T cells, and speculations about their significance."

CD010502,0,1728090,0,Culture and antigen detection tests for streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis.,"A throat culture is necessary for accurate diagnosis of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis. The use of penicillin therapy in every patient with sore throat results in overtreatment of 85 percent of children and 95 percent of adults presenting to family physicians with the complaint of sore throat. Indiscriminate use of penicillin also increases the risk of drug side effects and subjects some patients to unnecessary alterations of microbial ecology. The signs and symptoms of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis are nonspecific, and reliable clinical diagnosis is difficult. Throat culture is cost-effective and, if properly obtained and processed, more than 95 percent accurate. Antigen detection tests (rapid strep tests) are a viable laboratory alternative to throat cultures if these tests are properly performed and if negative test results are confirmed with traditional throat culture."

CD010502,0,6758372,0,Epidemiology of group A streptococcal infections--their changing frequency and severity.,"The frequency and severity of streptococcal infections and their sequelae have declined dramatically in the past century, yet the prevalence of streptococcal infections is still high. The reasons for this decline must be intimately related to host resistance, virulence of the agent, and environmental factors, especially crowding. Close examination of these fundamental influences does not reveal any evidence that humans have become less resistant to streptococcal infections, but they react less violently. There is some evidence that the agent may have lost a degree of its virulence. The decline in morbidity and mortality due to streptococcal infections began long before antibiotics, especially penicillin, were available. However, penicillin has proved to be an important factor in prevention of streptococcal infections, especially in rheumatic fever prophylaxis. There are certain indications that repeated streptococcal infections due to similar M types, occurring in young children over the past several decades, have resulted in some degree of immunity as well as the possible evolution of less virulent, but not less infectious, strains of group A streptococci. Also, a decrease in crowding would be expected to result in fewer streptococcal infections. Although there are more people in the world than at any other time in the history of man, urban population density in the western world, at least, is less than in the late 1800s and early 1900s."
CD010502,0,3074105,0,The sore throat. Pharyngitis and epiglottitis.,"Sore throat can be caused by different microorganisms and diseases. Most cases of acute pharyngitis are caused by group A streptococcus or viruses; however, uncommon organisms may be suggested by other clinical information or the persistence of symptoms. A thorough history and physical examination are essential for the appropriate selection of diagnostic tests for sore throat. Routine testing for the uncomplicated case should consist of a pharyngeal culture in most patients, with rapid streptococcal antigen testing only for the more severe cases. Those with positive streptococcal tests should be treated to prevent rheumatic fever and mitigate symptoms in severe cases. Sore throat caused by viruses usually resolves spontaneously. Cases that persist should be thoroughly re-evaluated, with alternative causes being considered. Acute epiglottitis is a medical emergency and requires treatment with appropriate antibiotics for Hemophilus influenzae type b and intubation."
CD010502,0,6758375,0,Pathogenesis of neonatal group B streptococcal infections.,"Infections of the neonate due to the group B Streptococcus have been recognized since the 1930s, but it was during the 1970s that their incidence grew alarmingly throughout the world. A research effort stimulated by this problem has yielded significant new information about many facets of the pathogenesis of these infections. Immunologic investigations have pinpointed a lack of transplacentally acquired antibody as a significant risk factor. In the laboratory, assays of antibody which have a functional endpoint have demonstrated that the type-specific carbohydrate antigens play a major role in stimulating the development of protective antibody. These assays have been shown to correlate with certain tests of primary antigen-antibody interaction which do not have a functional endpoint, but are simpler to use in larger scale epidemiologic studies. These tools may be useful in filling the gaps in our current knowledge of the pathogenesis of this infection."
CD010502,0,3055968,0,The pathogenetic potential of environmental antigens in IgA nephropathy.,"Patients with IgA nephropathy (IgAN) can be considered high responders for IgA production; data which indicate a generalized hyperreactivity of the immune system include autoantibody production, increased response to viral vaccination, and high titers of antibodies to various common respiratory and gastrointestinal microbes. From clinical and experimental observations, two types of antigen seem to be most involved in the pathogenesis of IgAN, ie, environmental respiratory or gastrointestinal infectious agents and dietary antigens. A role played by microbes has been suggested because macroscopic hematuria shortly follows a pharyngitis or a gastrointestinal disturbance. Antibodies to a wide spectrum of viral and bacterial infectious agents have been detected in sera from patients with IgAN. The possible role of dietary antigens has been demonstrated experimentally in animal models. In human IgAN, antibodies to various dietary antigens have been detected in sera; antibodies have also been found in IgA immune complexes and renal eluates. In human IgAN, a significant decrease in serum levels of IgA-containing circulating immune complexes after a gluten-free diet has been observed. The present experience accounts for 27 IgAN patients followed for 6 months to 3 years on a gluten-free diet. A decrease in serum levels of IgA-containing circulating immune complexes was observed in 64% of the patients whose initial levels were high during a period of unrestricted diet. Patients with basal high levels also had significantly high levels of IgA antibodies to dietary antigens, including bovine serum albumin, ovalbumin, and various gluten fractions. After 1 year of gluten-free diet the levels significantly decreased. A disappearance of antigliadin IgA, observed in 80% of the cases, was paralleled by a decrease in titers of the other antibodies to dietary components. These data support the hypothesis that in patients with IgAN, gluten may act as a toxic lectin, increasing the permeability of the intestinal mucosa to various dietary antigens."

After evaluation of specific and control reagents and their dilutions, the guinea pig/rabbit or the rabbit/chicken method were equally practicable and sensitive as the three-layer method with rabbit serum and superior to two other methods. By testing about 100 stool samples and 74 throat swabs containing adenoviruses, it turned out that the sensitivity (1 ng/ml hexon) appears satisfactory for stool specimens in adenovirus enteritis of infants, but is much less sensitive than isolation in cell culture for adenoviruses in throat swabs.

CD010502,0,9082719,0,[The structure of the determinants of streptococcal group A polysaccharide common to epidermal antigens to which antibodies are formed at different stages of the rheumatic process].,"Several epidermal antigens containing carbohydrate determinants (DT), common with those of group A streptococcal polysaccharide (A-PS), were identified: basal-cell antigen (1), antigens of the cytoplasm (2) and perinuclear zone (3) of the cells of the differentiated epidermal layers, as well as antigen characteristic of all layers of skin epithelium (4). As shown for the first time, in addition to N-acetyl-D-glucosamine, cross-reacting DT of A-PS, antibodies to which were detected in rheumatism, also contained the remnants of rhamnose joined by bonds 1=> 2 and/or 1=>3. At the same time DT, common for A-PS and antigen 1, was found to contain N-acetylflucosamine and residues of rhamnose, joined by bond 1 reversible 2. N-acetylglucosamine was also contained in DT of A-PS, common with antigen 3. In addition, the epitopes of antigens 2 and 4, cross-reacting with A-PS, seemed to contain no N-acetylglucosamine and were characterized by some specific features of rhamnosides which they contained. It was at interest that at different stages of the rheumatism, simultaneously with autoantibodies having the same specificity, autoantibodies to different epidermal antigens were detected in the blood of patients. The determination of the spectrum of autoantibodies to epidermal antigens may be used both for diagnostic purposes and for the prognostication of the course of the rheumatism."

Throat swabs from 277 patients suspected of having streptococcal pharyngitis were examined. By DNA probe alone, 10 specimens were positive, 51 were positive by both assays, and 8 were positive by culture alone. Thus, DNA probe sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were 86, 95, 84, and 96%, respectively. Including an indeterminate category, sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were 89, 96, 86, and 97%, respectively. After discrepancy testing, these values for the raw data improved to 90, 98, 93, and 97%, respectively. None of the 24 specimens that grew non-S. pyogenes beta-hemolytic streptococci in culture were positive by the DNA probe. Because mucoid S. pyogenes strains are more virulent than nonmucoid strains, 24 isolates were retrospectively tested with the DNA probe to ensure that both types would be detected equally well. Isolates were examined in pure cultures as well as mixed with representative normal oral flora. There was no statistical difference in detection of any of the four groups. Group A Streptococcus Direct Test is a rapid, sensitive, and specific test for S. pyogenes."
CD010502,0,19156548,0,Molecular detection of Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis.,"We developed molecular diagnostic assays for the detection of Streptococcus pyogenes (GAS) and Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis (SDSE), two streptococcal pathogens known to cause both pharyngitis and more invasive forms of disease in humans. Two real-time PCR assays coupled with an internal control were designed to be performed in parallel. One assay utilizes a gene target specific to GAS, and the other utilizes a gene target common to the two species. Both assays showed 2-3 orders of magnitude improved analytical sensitivity when compared to a commercially available rapid antigen test. In addition, when compared to standard culture in an analysis of 96 throat swabs, the real-time PCR assays resulted in clinical sensitivity and specificity of 91.7 and 100%, respectively. As capital equipment costs for real-time PCR can be prohibitive in smaller laboratories, the real-time PCR assays were converted to a low-density microarray format designed to function with an inexpensive photopolymerization-based non-enzymatic signal amplification (NESA) method. S. pyogenes was successfully detected on the low-density microarray in less than 4 h from sample extraction through detection."
CD010502,0,21870706,0,[Utility of clinical differentiation and microbiological examination for appropriate antibiotic therapy of acute pharyngotonsillitis in children].,"The differentiation between streptococcal pharyngotonsillitis and that of viral etiology is crucial, since it allows to discriminate patients who need to be treated with the use of antibiotics from those who only need symptomatic treatment. For that purpose, Centor/Mclssac's scale, based on the clinical examination and a history of a patient, is suggested by ""Polish Recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of community-acquired respiratory tract infections 2010"". In patients who have obtained two or more points according to this scale, a definitive diagnosis of streptococcal pharyngotonsillitis depends on the identification of the bacterium, which can be performed by throat swab culture or by rapid antigen detection test. The aim of the study was to evaluate utility of clinical differentiation, rapid antigen detection test and throat swab culture for appropriate antibiotic therapy of acute pharyngotonsillitis in children. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey of this type carried out in Poland."

CD010502,0,9496695,0,Cervical secretions in pregnant women colonized rectally with group B streptococci have high levels of antibodies to serotype III polysaccharide capsular antigen and protein R.,"Group B streptococci (GBS) colonizing the female genital tract will often infect newborn infants during delivery. In 200 pregnant women studied, 14% were colonized with GBS in the cervix, 12% in the rectum, and 9% in both cervix and rectum. We have previously reported that antibody levels to GBS serotypes Ia, II, and III in sera and cervical secretions were increased in women colonized in the rectum and/or cervix, when analyzed by a whole-cell ELISA. Here, we report the levels of antibodies to GBS serotype III capsular polysaccharide antigen (CPS III) and to protein antigen R4, which are present in most GBS III strains. Compared to culture-negative women, the group of women colonized rectally had markedly elevated levels of immunoglobulin (Ig)A and IgG antibodies in cervical secretions to both CPS III and protein R4 (P < 0.01 and P < 0.001, respectively). In sera, the corresponding differences between culture-negative and culture-positive women were less pronounced, or not present. In contrast to antibody levels to whole-cell GBS, antibody levels to CPS III and protein R4 in cervical secretions were not significantly increased in women colonized only in the cervix, except that IgA antibodies to protein R4 were slightly elevated (P < 0.05). These findings suggest that capsular type-specific polysaccharides and protein R4 in a mucosal vaccine might induce protective antibodies against GBS colonization of the uterine cervix."
CD010502,0,16110216,0,Immunogenicity and protective efficacy of a targeted fusion DNA construct against dental caries.,"Targeting antigens to antigen-presenting cells by fusion to cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA4) has been shown to be a highly efficient method to enhance the efficacy of DNA vaccines. The purpose of this study was to determine the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of the targeted fusion DNA construct pGJA-P, which contains the signal peptide and extracellular regions of human CTLA4 gene, the hinge and Fc regions of human Iggamma1 gene, the glucan-binding domain of the Streptococcus mutans gtfB gene and the A-P fragment of the S. mutans pac gene, compared with the fusion DNA construct pGLUA-P, which contains only the glucan-binding domain of the S. mutansgtfB gene and the A-P fragment of the S. mutans pac gene. BALB/c mice were immunized with pGJA-P, pGLUA-P, or pCI (vector) by the intramuscular or intranasal route. Specific anti-PAc and anti-GTF-I serum IgG and salivary IgA antibody responses were assessed by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Wistar rats were orally challenged with S. mutans and immunized with pGJA-P, pGLUA-P, or pCI intramuscularly or intranasally, and caries activity was evaluated by the Keyes method. pGJA-P induced accelerated and increased serum and salivary antibody responses in mice compared with pGLUA-P. Rats immunized with pGJA-P had significantly fewer caries lesions than rats immunized with pGLUA-P (p < 0.01). Thus, this study demonstrates that the targeted DNA construct pGJA-P can enhance both systemic and mucosal immunity and may be a useful strategy for improving the protective efficacy of anticaries DNA vaccines."
CD010502,0,15380273,0,Evaluation of a real-time fluorescent PCR assay for rapid detection of Group B Streptococci in neonatal blood.,"Streptococcus agalactiae (Group B Streptococcus: GBS) is the major causative agent of neonatal sepsis. Neonates at risk for GBS infections are empirically administered broad-spectrum antibiotics for at least 48 h pending blood culture results. A rapid assay to expedite detection of GBS would facilitate initiation of specific antibiotic therapy. Conversely, expeditious proof of absence of infection will avoid unnecessary antibiotic use. Using the LightCycler, we evaluated a hybridization probe polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay to detect GBS-specific cfb gene target DNA sequence in blood specimens. Both sensitivity and specificity of the real-time PCR assay was 100%. The assay demonstrated 100% specificity when tested against 26 non-GBS bacteria. This method is capable of detecting as few as approximately 100 copies or 10 pg of GBS genomic DNA. This real-time PCR method is rapid, sensitive, and specific for the detection of GBS in neonatal blood samples and holds great promise in its utility in the diagnostic laboratory."
CD010502,0,2410530,0,Epitopes of streptococcal M proteins shared with cardiac myosin.,"We present evidence that M proteins from three different serotypes of group A streptococci share epitopes with cardiac myosin. Rabbit antisera evoked by a purified fragment of type 5 M protein crossreacted with myosin, but not alpha-tropomyosin, actin, or myosin light chains. In enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, the myosin-crossreactive antibodies were totally inhibited by type 5 M protein and partially inhibited by types 6 and 19 M proteins. The affinity-purified myosin antibodies opsonized type 5 streptococci, indicating that they were directed against protective M protein epitopes on the surface of the organisms. Immunoblot analyses demonstrated the binding of the crossreactive antibodies to myosin heavy chains. Sera from patients with acute rheumatic fever showed significantly stronger reactions with myosin than did sera from their siblings, hospitalized controls, or patients with poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis."
CD010502,0,22432746,0,Guideline for the management of acute sore throat.,"The European Society for Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases established the Sore Throat Guideline Group to write an updated guideline to diagnose and treat patients with acute sore throat. In diagnosis, Centor clinical scoring system or rapid antigen test can be helpful in targeting antibiotic use. The Centor scoring system can help to identify those patients who have higher likelihood of group A streptococcal infection. In patients with high likelihood of streptococcal infections (e.g. 3-4 Centor criteria) physicians can consider the use of rapid antigen test (RAT). If RAT is performed, throat culture is not necessary after a negative RAT for the diagnosis of group A streptococci. To treat sore throat, either ibuprofen or paracetamol are recommended for relief of acute sore throat symptoms. Zinc gluconate is not recommended to be used in sore throat. There is inconsistent evidence of herbal treatments and acupuncture as treatments for sore throat. Antibiotics should not be used in patients with less severe presentation of sore throat, e.g. 0-2 Centor criteria to relieve symptoms. Modest benefits of antibiotics, which have been observed in patients with 3-4 Centor criteria, have to be weighed against side effects, the effect of antibiotics on microbiota, increased antibacterial resistance, medicalisation and costs. The prevention of suppurative complications is not a specific indication for antibiotic therapy in sore throat. If antibiotics are indicated, penicillin V, twice or three times daily for 10 days is recommended. At the present, there is no evidence enough that indicates shorter treatment length."

In the collecting office and in the hospital laboratory, one swab from each patient was first inoculated to sheep blood agar (incubated at 35 degrees C aerobically for 2 days) and then tested for group A streptococcal antigen by using the SMART enzyme immunoassay technique (New Horizons Diagnostics Corp) incubated for up to 24 hours. Group A streptococci were recovered in culture (from one or both swabs) and serologically identified from 444 (42.9%) of the patients. Pediatric offices numbers 1, 2, and 3 detected 84.4%, 84.6%, and 82.2%, respectively, of their patients who had positive cultures (in the office and/or laboratory) by using their own culture system and 82.6%, 71.1%, and 84.9%, respectively, of these same patients by using the SMART technique. In the laboratory, SMART test sensitivity and specificity were 71.4% and 98.7%, respectively, after 5 minutes of test incubation. However, SMART test sensitivity improved to 86.5% after overnight incubation of the immunoassay and to 91.3% if the data from one defective lot of seven SMART production lots studied were excluded. SMART test results which are negative after 5 minutes of incubation should therefore be confirmed both by reincubation of the antigen test up to 24 hours and by culture."
CD010502,0,1512202,0,Environmental regulation of virulence in group A streptococci: transcription of the gene encoding M protein is stimulated by carbon dioxide.,"We have found that different atmospheres can have significant effects on the transcription of emm, the gene that encodes M protein, the major virulence factor of the group A streptococcus (Streptococcus pyogenes). Expression of emm was monitored by constructing a transcriptional fusion of the promoter for emm6.1 from S. pyogenes JRS4 to a promoterless chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene. Transcription, as measured by determining chloramphenicol acetyltransferase specific activity, was stimulated by as much as 25-fold by increased carbon dioxide tension. Expression was greater in the latter stages of growth and was not affected by growth at 30 instead of 37 degrees C. Insertional inactivation of mry, a gene encoding a positive regulator of emm6.1, reduced chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity below the detectable level. We conclude that expression of emm is influenced by environmental factors and that the level of carbon dioxide is one signal that may influence expression of M protein during infection."

Paired vaginal swabs obtained from women in labor were rapidly transported to the laboratory and used for culturing (both swabs) and LPA testing (one swab by each method). GBS growth was estimated semiquantitatively and further designated as light or heavy growth. Performance specifications for each method were determined by comparing LPA and culture results from the same swab. A total of 4,251 paired swabs were evaluated during the study period. The performance specifications for detecting GBS growth of any degree for Bactigen and Directigen, respectively, were as follows: sensitivity, 20 and 24%; specificity, 99 and 99%. The performance specifications for heavy colonization for Bactigen and Directigen, respectively, were as follows: sensitivity, 57 and 62%; specificity, 99 and 99%. Neither LPA kit was a sensitive indicator of vaginal colonization with GBS or neonatal infection."

This clinical isolate formed beta-hemolytic large colonies on sheep blood agar, and was catalase-negative gram-positive cocci carrying Lancefield's group A antigen. Therefore, Streptococcus pyogenes and this clinical isolate could not be classified by the conventional method on the basis of Lancefield's group antigen. In addition, the rapid detection system of group A streptococci based on group A antigen detection techniques could not divide into two species. Recently, S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis with Lancefield's group G antigen has been isolated from severe invasive streptococcal infection in an increasing frequency in Japan. A possibility that group A S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis cause a serious infection from now on cannot be denied. Thus the discrimination of S. pyogenes from group A S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis is very important. To identify beta-hemolytic streptococci, it is necessary to consider a serogrouping test as one of characteristics of streptococci, and to identify by checking biochemical tests like the PYR test."
CD010502,0,2179263,0,Direct detection of group B streptococci from vaginal specimens compared with quantitative culture.,"Determination of prenatal vaginal carriage of group B streptococci (GBS) is important in the management of newborns. A pronase extraction-latex particle agglutination method (Streptex; Wellcome Diagnostics, Dartford, England) was used to rapidly detect GBS species-specific antigen directly from vaginal specimens. It was compared with quantitative and broth enrichment cultures. A total of 434 vaginal swab specimens were obtained before delivery. GBS cultures were positive for 14.7% of the specimens (64 of 434). Colony counts ranged from 2 to greater than 10(6) CFU per swab. The sensitivities of the direct antigen analysis were 19% (12 of 64) for all cultures and 63% (12 of 19) for specimens heavily colonized with GBS (greater than 10(4) CFU per swab). The specificity of the antigen test was 99.7%, with only one false-positive. There were three false-negative tests with colony counts of greater than 10(6) CFU per swab. The predictive values were 92% for a positive antigen test and 88% for a negative antigen test. The direct immunochemical detection of GBS antigen can be useful in a population of heavily colonized women. Direct latex particle agglutination does not appear to be salutary for a lightly colonized population and does not appear to be able to replace either culture or antigen detection after growth amplification at this time."

A total of 452 throat swabs was evaluated, of which 261 (57.7%) and 191 (42.3%) were compared with culture using nonselective and selective media, respectively. Of 261 specimens evaluated on nonselective media, 71 (27.1%) were culture positive for GAS. TPPSA demonstrated a sensitivity of 91.6% and a specificity of 94.2% with positive and negative predictive values of 85.5% and 96.8%, respectively. Of 191 specimens evaluated on selective media, 44 (23.0%) were culture positive for GAS. TPPSA demonstrated a sensitivity of 93.2% and a specificity of 98.0% with positive and negative predictive values of 93.2% and 98.0%, respectively. The performance of TPPSA when compared with nonselective and selective media demonstrated a similar sensitivity, but a higher specificity was seen when compared to selective media. Overall, TPPSA was extremely easy to perform, had built-in procedural controls, required minimal technologist time, and was easy to interpret. With an accuracy of 93.5% when compared with nonselective media and 96.9% when compared with selective media, TPPSA could be recommended as a reliable method for detection of GAS."
CD010502,0,10829824,1,Rapid streptococcal testing in Vietnamese children with pharyngitis.,"Streptococcal pharyngitis has been a significant public health problem in Vietnam for many years. Accurate diagnosis of the infection, however, has been difficult. We carried out a clinical trial of a rapid streptococcal antigen detection test (Quick-Vue (R) Flex Strep A) on a population of 777 children with pharyngitis seen at the Institute for the Protection of Children's Health (Children's Hospital) in Hanoi, Vietnam. Bacterial culture was performed in parallel with the rapid test on simultaneously obtained throat swab specimens. The rapid test was found to be 89% sensitive and 92% specific (96% in children not on prior antibiotics) compared to culture. The test was also found to be convenient and acceptable to patients and clinicians. A significant benefit of the test is that those children found positive are more likely to be treated with penicillin rather than a broad spectrum antimicrobial, which in turn will reduce the likelihood of resistant infections in the future."
CD010502,0,7868273,0,Genetic diversity and relationships among Streptococcus pyogenes strains expressing serotype M1 protein: recent intercontinental spread of a subclone causing episodes of invasive disease.,"Chromosomal diversity and relationships among 126 Streptococcus pyogenes strains expressing M1 protein from 13 countries on five continents were analyzed by multilocus enzyme electrophoresis and restriction fragment profiling by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. All isolates were studied for the presence of the gene encoding streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin A by PCR. Strain subsets were also examined by automated DNA sequencing for allelic polymorphism in genes encoding M protein (emm), streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin A (speA), streptokinase (ska), pyrogenic exotoxin B (interleukin-1 beta convertase) (speB), and C5a peptidase (scp). Seven distinct emm1 alleles that encode M proteins differing at one or more amino acids in the N-terminal variable region were identified. Although substantial levels of genetic diversity exist among M1-expressing organisms, most invasive disease episodes are caused by two subclones marked by distinctive multilocus enzyme electrophoretic profiles and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) types. One of these subclones (ET 1/RFLP pattern 1a) has the speA gene and was recovered worldwide. Identity of speA, emm1, speB, and ska alleles in virtually all isolates of ET 1/RFLP type 1a means that these organisms share a common ancestor and that global dispersion of this M1-expressing subclone has occurred very recently. The occurrence of the same emm and ska alleles in strains that are well differentiated in overall chromosomal character demonstrates that horizontal transfer and recombination play a fundamental role in diversifying natural populations of S. pyogenes."
CD010502,0,15823960,0,Cell-surface display of E7 antigen from human papillomavirus type-16 in Lactococcus lactis and in Lactobacillus plantarum using a new cell-wall anchor from lactobacilli.,"The human papillomavirus type-16 (HPV-16) E7 protein is considered a major viral oncoprotein involved in cervical cancer (CxCa) and a potential candidate for the development of a vaccine against this neoplasia. Here, two lactic acid bacteria (the model one Lactococcus lactis and a probiotic one Lactobacillus plantarum) were engineered to deliver an E7 mutant protein (E7mm), which has a reduced transforming activity and consequently, could fit better to therapeutic use in humans than the native form of E7. An efficient cell-surface display of E7mm was obtained in L. lactis using an expression cassette encoding a precursor composed of (i) the signal peptide and the first 15 amino acids of the mature part of the lactococcal Usp45 protein; (ii) E7mm and (iii) the cell-wall anchor of the Streptococcus pyogenes M6 protein (CWA(M6)). This hybrid precursor was produced but not cell-wall anchored in Lb. plantarum. We thus replaced CWA(M6) by the cell-wall anchor of a Lb. plantarum protein which allows an efficient cell-wall anchoring of E7mm in this bacterium. The E7mm production and cell-surface display in both L. lactis and a probiotic bacterium, Lb. plantarum, represent one more step towards the development of a safe and effective treatment against CxCa."

CD010502,0,21907752,0,"HLA class II transgenic mice develop a safe and long lasting immune response against StreptInCor, an anti-group A streptococcus vaccine candidate.","Streptococcus pyogenes infections remain a health problem in several countries because of post-streptococcal sequelae, such as rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease. We developed a vaccine epitope (StreptInCor) composed of 55 amino acid residues of the C-terminal portion of the M protein that encompasses both T and B cell protective epitopes. Recently, by using human blood samples, we showed that the StreptInCor epitope is able to bind to different HLA class II molecules and that it could be considered a universal vaccine epitope. In the present work, we evaluated the immune response of HLA class II transgenic mice against aluminum hydroxide-absorbed StreptInCor. After a period of one year, several organs were analyzed histologically to verify the safety of the candidate vaccine epitope. Our results showed that StreptInCor is able to induce robust and safe and long lasting immune response without deleterious reactions in several organs. In conclusion, the results presented here indicate that StreptInCor could be considered a safe vaccine against severe streptococcus-induced diseases."
CD010502,0,3284898,0,In vitro method to differentiate isolates of type III Streptococcus agalactiae from symptomatic and asymptomatic patients.,"Streptococcus agalactiae (group B streptococci) isolates from infected infants have been demonstrated to have three- to fourfold or higher levels of cell-associated lipoteichoic acid than isolates from asymptomatically colonized infants, suggesting a role for this cell surface polymer in the relative virulence of these organisms. The present study indicates that symptomatic isolates of type III group B streptococci can be readily differentiated from asymptomatic strains by their response to various levels of phosphate in a chemically defined medium (FMC). Both classes of isolates had the same doubling time (TD of 30 to 35 min) in FMC containing 65 mM sodium phosphate. However, levels of phosphate greater than 125 mM distinguished the two classes of strains. Asymptomatic strains pregrown in 65 mM phosphate to the stationary phase rapidly initiated growth at elevated phosphate levels, while symptomatic strains initiated growth only after a prolonged incubation period (greater than 400 min). These results suggest that the physiological growth response of clinical isolates of group B streptococci to phosphate can serve as a diagnostic aid in screening potentially virulent strains in pregnant women and newborn infants."
CD010502,0,16775954,0,[Investigation of bactericidal effect and cytokine response of the oral epithelial cells against different antigenic doses of Streptococcus pyogenes].,"Epithelial cells (EC) have an important role in the constitution of both innate and acquired immune responses. The aim of this study was to investigate the alterations of bactericidal effects and cytokine production patterns of human oral epithelial cells (OEC) against different doses of Streptococcus pyogenes. For this purpose, OEC have been stimulated with S. pyogenes with an effector/target (E/T) cell ratio of 1/1, 1/100, 1/1.000 and 1/10.000, and bactericidal effects and interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8 and IL-10 levels were detected in the first and sixth hours of incubation. The mean rates of bactericidal effect detected in the first and sixth hours were 38.7% and 54.5%, respectively. The bactericidal effects observed at 1/1 E/T cell ratio in the first hour, and at 1/1 and 1/100 E/T cell ratio in the the sixth hour were found significantly higher then the other cells ratios (p<0.05). Time- and dose-depended differences were detected in the cytokine responses of OEC for different S. pyogenes concentrations. IL-6 levels produced by stimulated OEC were found higher, and IL-8 levels were found lower then the levels which were produced by unstimulated OEC (p<0.05, p<0.001, respectively) in the first hour, while there were no change in IL-10 levels after stimulation with different bacterial concentrations (p>0.05). At the sixth hour there were no differences in the IL-6 levels produced by stimulated and unstimulated cells, while the levels of IL-8 produced by stimulated cells were found lower then the levels produced by unstimulated cells in the E/T cell ratio of 1/100, 1/1000 and 1/10.000 (p<0.05, p<0.01, p<0.01, respectively). Nevertheless IL-10 levels in the E/T cell ratio of 1/100 and 1/1.000 were statistically higher then the levels produced by unstimulated cells (p<0.05, p<0.05). As a result OEC stimulated with S. pyogenes showed dose dependent manner in bactericidal effect and cytokine production. It is suggested that epithelial cells stimulation with different doses of antigen contributed to the immune system activation or tolerance."
CD010502,0,8958254,0,Type-specific antibodies to purified streptococcal M proteins from potentially rheumatogenic M-types in patients with rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease.,"This study was designed to identify the predominant serotypes of group A streptococci (GAS) responsible for rheumatic fever (RF) and rheumatic heart disease (RHD) in India. RF and RHD sera were screened for antibodies to M proteins retrospectively against known rheumatogenic M types and M types isolated from patients with acute RF. All GAS strains isolated from four patients with acute RF in a short outbreak of RF, were identical - serum opacity factor (SOF) negative, T-pattern 3/13 B3264 and M-non-typable. Because of this, M protein was isolated from only one of these four M-non-typable strain (S-399). This was done by limited pepsin digestion and purification by ion-exchange chromatography on DEAE-Sephadex, followed by gel filtration. Purified M protein was found to be homologous on SDS-PAGE (mol.wt 20 kDa), immunogenic in rabbits and to retain its antigenic structure. This purified M protein from an M-non-typable strain (pep-MNT) was used as an antigen to screen RF and RHD sera retrospectively by ELISA for the prevalence of the M-non-typable GAS strain. The prevalence of the M-non-typable strain was compared with that of the known rheumatogenic M types. Results suggest that the M-non-typable strain could be a provisional new rheumatogenic M type in India and could be a candidate for a multivalent M-protein vaccine to control RF and RHD."
CD010502,0,10933708,0,Detachment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 from germinal centers by blocking complement receptor type 2.,"After the transition from the acute to the chronic phase of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, complement mediates long-term storage of virions in germinal centers (GC) of lymphoid tissue. The contribution of particular complement receptors (CRs) to virus trapping in GC was studied on tonsillar specimens from HIV-infected individuals. CR2 (CD21) was identified as the main binding site for HIV in GC. Monoclonal antibodies (MAb) blocking the CR2-C3d interaction were shown to detach 62 to 77% of HIV type 1 from tonsillar cells of an individual in the presymptomatic stage. Although they did so at a lower efficiency, these antibodies were able to remove HIV from tonsillar cells of patients under highly active antiretroviral therapy, suggesting that the C3d-CR2 interaction remains a primary entrapment mechanism in treated patients as well. In contrast, removal of HIV was not observed with MAb blocking CR1 or CR3. Thus, targeting CR2 may facilitate new approaches toward a reduction of residual virus in GC."
CD010502,0,9746555,0,Streptococcus pyogenes serotype M1 encodes multiple pathways for entry into human epithelial cells.,"The ability of a serotype M1 strain of Streptococcus pyogenes to efficiently invade A549 human lung epithelial cells was previously shown to be dependent on bacterial exposure to human or bovine serum proteins or synthetic peptides containing the sequence RGD. In this study, stimulation by invasion agonists was determined to be dependent on expression of the streptococcal cell surface protein, M1. Fetal bovine serum (FBS), fibronectin (Fn), the extracellular matrix protein laminin (Lm), and RGD-containing peptides were tested for their abilities to promote epithelial cell invasion and adherence by isogenic M1(+) and M1(-) strains of S. pyogenes. In the absence of an agonist, invasion and adherence were comparable for the two bacterial strains. FBS, Fn, and Lm stimulated invasion of the M1(+) strain as much as 70-fold but failed to significantly affect invasion by the M1(-) mutant. Adherence of the wild-type strain was stimulated by these same agonists. Epithelial cell adherence by the M1(-) strain, however, was unaffected by the presence of Fn or Lm. Several RGD-containing peptides were found to promote invasion independently of M1 expression. Binding of 125I-Fn was reduced 88% by the M1(-) mutation and Fn was found to bind purified M1 protein, suggesting that Fn mediates invasion by direct binding to M1. To determine if host integrins might be involved in internalization of streptococci, several anti-integrin monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) were tested for their abilities to inhibit invasion. Antibody directed against integrin beta1 inhibited FBS-, Fn-, and Lm-mediated invasion but did not abrogate RGD-peptide-stimulated invasion. MAb directed against the epithelial cell Fn receptor, integrin alpha5beta1, inhibited Fn and FBS-mediated invasion but did not specifically inhibit Lm-mediated invasion. These results indicate that S. pyogenes has evolved multiple mechanisms for invasion of eukaryotic cells, at least two of which involve interactions between M1 protein, host integrins, and integrin ligands."
CD010502,0,3679253,0,The isolation of cross-reactive monoclonal antibodies: hybridomas to streptococcal antigens cross-reactive with mammalian basement membrane.,"Based upon the assumption that post-streptococcal sequelae are the result of cross-reactive antibodies, hybridomas were prepared from the spleens of mice immunized with Group A type 12 streptococcal cell membranes (SCM) specifically to screen for such cross-reactive antibodies. One fusion produced a cell population displaying antibodies reactive to both SCM and glomerular basement membrane (GBM) antigens as demonstrated by ELISA technique. Ascites produced by this cell population also showed reactivity to lung basement membrane (LBM). Limiting dilution procedures have produced 15 monoclonal hybrids with both anti-SCM and anti-GBM activity. Confirmation of the cross-reactive and monoclonal nature of the antibody was accomplished by both direct and indirect competitive ELISA. These observations have established that unique cross-reactive antibody-secreting hybrid cells with reactivity to both SCM and basement membrane (BM) antigens can be isolated by standard cloning procedures."
CD010502,0,16825355,0,Molecular characterization of nontypeable group B streptococcus.,"Traditionally, the capsular polysaccharide (CPS) antigen has been used to distinguish between the nine known serotypes of group B streptococcus (GBS) by classical antibody-antigen reactions. In this study, we used PCR for all CPSs and selected protein antigens, multilocus sequencing typing (MLST), and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) to molecularly characterize 92 clinical isolates identified as nontypeable (NT) by CPS-specific antibody-antigen reactivity. The PCR and MLST were performed on blinded, randomly numbered isolates. All isolates contained the cfb gene coding for CAMP factor. While most (56.5%) contained a single CPS-specific gene, 40 isolates contained either two or three CPS-specific genes. Type V CPS-specific gene was present in 66% of the isolates, and all serotypes except types IV, VII, and VIII were represented. Most (44.5%) of the isolates contained a single protein antigen gene (bca, bac, rib, alp1, or alp3), and the remaining isolates had multiple protein antigen genes. Of the 61 isolates that had the V CPS-specific gene, 48 (78.6%) had the alp3 gene. PFGE analysis classified the isolates into 21 profile groups, while MLST analysis divided the isolates into 16 sequence types. Forty-two (69%) of 61 isolates with the V CPS-specific gene were in PFGE profile group 4; 41 of these 42 were sequence type 1 by MLST. These data shed new light on the antigenic complexity of NT GBS isolates, information that can be valuable in the formulation of an effective GBS vaccine."

CD010502,0,6986441,0,Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay of antibodies in human sera to streptococcal DNase B.,"An ELISA method for determining the streptococcal anti--DNase B titers in human sera is presented. The details of this technique, a method for converting A493 readings into titers, and a standardization procedure are discussed. Anti--DNase B titers of 20 sera determined by ELISA were compared with titers determined by the microtechnique. A correlation coefficient of 0.96 between the two methods was obtained. The reproducibility of the ELISA method was established by comparing titers obtained from two separate determinations on the 20 sera. Twenty-four pairs of acute and convalescent sera were assayed for anti--DNase B titers by both ELISA and microtechnique to compare the ability of the two techniques to identify significant titer rises. The ELISA was as specific and possibly more sensitive than the microtechnique in identifying significant anti--DNase B titer rises. This ELISA method is simple and rapid and has the potential for automation."
CD010502,0,8455186,0,Rapid detection of Mycoplasma pneumoniae in clinical samples by the polymerase chain reaction.,"A DNA amplification method was used to detect Mycoplasma pneumoniae in clinical samples. M. pneumoniae 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequences were selected as the amplification target region. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with purified DNA fragments as templates yielded an expected 88-bp fragment from M. pneumoniae but not from other Mycoplasma spp. nor from any of the other bacteria assayed. With this method, the 88-bp product specific for M. pneumoniae could be obtained from a minimum of 0.05 pg of M. pneumoniae DNA. Subsequently this PCR technique was used for the detection of M. pneumoniae in throat-swab samples. Twenty-two of 30 culture-positive clinical samples gave positive results in the PCR test. Thirty-two culture-negative clinical samples and 33 samples from healthy volunteers, of which only one was culture-positive, gave negative results in the same PCR test. This PCR method is useful for the direct detection of M. pneumoniae in clinical samples."
CD010502,0,22355321,0,"IGD motifs, which are required for migration stimulatory activity of fibronectin type I modules, do not mediate binding in matrix assembly.","Picomolar concentrations of proteins comprising only the N-terminal 70-kDa region (70K) of fibronectin (FN) stimulate cell migration into collagen gels. The Ile-Gly-Asp (IGD) motifs in four of the nine FN type 1 (FNI) modules in 70K are important for such migratory stimulating activity. The 70K region mediates binding of nanomolar concentrations of intact FN to cell-surface sites where FN is assembled. Using baculovirus, we expressed wildtype 70K and 70K with Ile-to-Ala mutations in (3)FNI and (5)FNI; (7)FNI and (9)FNI; or (3)FNI, (5)FNI, (7)FNI, and (9)FNI. Wildtype 70K and 70K with Ile-to-Ala mutations were equally active in binding to assembly sites of FN-null fibroblasts. This finding indicates that IGD motifs do not mediate the interaction between 70K and the cell-surface that is important for FN assembly. Further, FN fragment N-(3)FNIII, which does not stimulate migration, binds to assembly sites on FN-null fibroblast. The Ile-to-Ala mutations had effects on the structure of FNI modules as evidenced by decreases in abilities of 70K with Ile-to-Ala mutations to bind to monoclonal antibody 5C3, which recognizes an epitope in (9)FNI, or to bind to FUD, a polypeptide based on the F1 adhesin of Streptococcus pyogenes that interacts with 70K by the β-zipper mechanism. These results suggest that the picomolar interactions of 70K with cells that stimulate cell migration require different conformations of FNI modules than the nanomolar interactions required for assembly."

Interaction between septicemic GBS and confluent monolayers of human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAECs) was analyzed by genome wide expression profiling. In total, 124 genes were differentially expressed (89 upregulated, 35 downregulated) based on a more than 3-fold difference to control HCAEC. Regulated genes are involved in apoptosis, hemostasis, oxidative stress response, infection, and inflammation. Regulation of selected genes and proteins identified in the gene array analysis was confirmed by Real-time RT-PCR assay (granulocyte chemotactic protein 2), ELISA (urokinase, cyclooxygenase 2, granulocyte chemotactic protein 1), and western blotting (Heme oxygenase1, BCL2 interacting protein) at various time points between 4 and 24 hours.

The isolates from the remaining 65 cases were assigned to 26 other emm types. Erythromycin resistance (12 isolates) was primarily mef(A)-mediated, although all emm type 1 strains were susceptible. Tetracycline resistance, due mostly to tet(M), was detected in 26 isolates.

CD010502,0,3878751,0,Influence of TPA (12-O-tetradodecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate) on human B lymphocyte function.,"The effect of the tumour-promoting agent TPA (12-0-tetra-dodecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate) on the proliferation and Ig secretion response of blood and tonsil lymphocytes was investigated and compared to that of the T-cell-dependent polyclonal activators pokeweed mitogen (PWM) and group A streptococcal cell membranes (A-ScM) or the T-cell-independent B cell mitogen Staphylococcus aureus Cowan I (SAC) and a T-cell-independent B cell activator Klebsiella pneumoniae (Klebs M). In blood mononuclear cells (MNC), a rather weak, monocyte-dependent DNA synthetic response was observed after exposure to TPA, in comparison to PWM, A-ScM or SAC. Whereas highly purified B cells did not respond to TPA, purified T cells proliferated to a similar degree as unseparated MNC; moreover, the addition of T to B lymphocytes enhanced proliferation rates proportionally to the number of T cells added. This suggests that TPA acts as a polyclonal T cell activator (PTA) for human blood and tonsil cells. Similarly, TPA induced only small amounts of Ig secretion in blood and in tonsil MNC, as determined by an ELISA assay, and no significant Ig secretion in highly purified B cells. The rather weak B cell differentiation response was not due to a monocyte suppressor effect, since partially monocyte-depleted MNC or B cells responded similarly to the non-depleted cells. Thus, TPA cannot be considered as an alternative to other B cells stimulators, both with regard to DNA synthesis and Ig secretion."

These activities could not be absorbed by cell membrane of Micrococcus luteus, Streptococcus pyogenes or Actinomyces viscosus. These findings suggested the existence of species-specific antigens of cell membrane. The membrane antigens of L-form related to the metabolic and growth inhibiting activities were stable to trypsin, heating and periodate, and were not solubilized by trypsin. A large part of the antigen in a typsin-insoluble membrane precipitate of L-form could be extracted by acetone and the subsequent use of chloroform-methanol (2: 1). A fractionation study of chloroform-methanol extract by using silicic acid calum indicated that more than two components were involved in metabolic and growth inhibiting activities."
CD010502,0,7523828,0,Streptococcus pyogenes type IIa IgG Fc receptor expression is co-ordinately regulated with M protein and streptococcal C5a peptidase.,"Streptococcus pyogenes is an important agent of human disease which expresses a variety of proteins and polysaccharides on its surface. Surface molecules M protein and streptococcal C5a peptidase (SCPA) are virulence factors which undergo concurrent phase variation and are under the co-ordinate control of the virR locus. Most opacity factor-positive (OF+) strains of S. pyogenes also express IgG Fc receptor proteins on their surface. These studies were initiated to determine whether the type IIa Fc receptor on the surface of S. pyogenes phase-varies with members of this regulatory circuit. Several methods were applied to M+ and M- variant strains to evaluate this question. (i) Immunoblot assays quantified Fc receptors on whole cells by using human IgG myeloma protein and receptor-specific antibody. M+ strains bound IgG and antibody specific for Fc protein, whereas M- strains did not. (ii) Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays quantified Fc receptor antigen expression and showed that M+ strains produce more Fc receptor protein than their M- derivatives. (iii) Quantitative RNA dot blots showed that the message for the Fc receptor gene (fcrA) was reduced in M- strains. RNA from M+ strains hybridized to the fcrA probe at a greater dilution than that from their M- counterparts. (iv) Northern hybridization showed that the fcrA transcript is 1200 nucleotides in size and distinct from transcripts for M and SCPA proteins. These data are evidence for the co-ordinate transcriptional control of the Fc receptor, M protein, and SCPA and show that these proteins co-ordinately phase-vary within the same regulatory circuit."

In comparison with culture isolation, the sensitivities and specificities of the IFA, Directigen FLU-A, and Prima EIA were 92.5 and 97.2%, 86.8 and 99.1%, and 92.5 and 98.1%, respectively. In contrast to EIA, IFA was labor intensive and required a high degree of technical expertise, and the results of IFA were difficult to interpret. These factors may preclude the use of IFA for testing large numbers of specimens. A retrospective epidemiologic survey of influenza infection was done in six geriatric institutions which had used either rapid and culture testing or culture alone. Preventable cases of influenza A virus infection ranged from 9 to 38% of all cases in facilities which used culture testing only and which had not instituted amantadine prophylaxis. The use of direct specimen testing is recommended as an adjunct to culture isolation for the identification of influenza A virus. Use of a combination of these methods permits the timely administration of appropriate antiviral therapy and infection control measures, while it also permits the antigenic surveillance of circulating influenza strains, which is necessary for present vaccine efficacy evaluations and the creation of future effective vaccine formulations."

Binding appears to be mediated by M protein, since a large peptide of this molecule (pep M24) bound to fragments containing the terminal domains of the fibrinogen molecule (D, X, and Y), but not fragment E, and pep M24 inhibited the binding of digested fibrinogen to streptococcal cells. An M protein-binding site occurs on fragment D3 and, therefore, differs from several functional sites present on D1 but not D3, including the fibrin polymerization site, the two gamma chain crosslink sites, and the bindings sites for platelet fibrinogen receptor, staphylococcal clumping factor, and ionized calcium. Bound fibrinogen degradation products prevented deposition of C3 on the streptococcal cell surface, and, in consequence, prevented phagocytosis by neutrophils in nonimmune blood. The average affinity of D fragments for the streptococcal cell surface was approximately 30 times lower than that of native fibrinogen, and a terminal plasmic digest was approximately 50 times less potent in inhibiting opsonization by C3. However, physiologic concentrations of digested fibrinogen sufficed to inhibit opsonization and phagocytosis completely. Digests of crosslinked fibrin clot also inhibited opsonization, although slightly less effectively than did fibrinogen digests. The antiopsonic effect of fibrin(ogen) degradation products may be relevant to circumstances in which fibrin(ogen)olysis is occurring, e.g., exudation and suppuration."
CD010502,0,9331800,0,Nonneutralizing antibody to erythrogenic toxin A alpha(NY5ETA) in human sera.,"A solid phase adsorption experiment was performed to detect anti-ETA alpha(NY5 strain ETA) nonneutralizing antibody. Toxin was applied to the Protein A-Sepharose column retaining IgG bound after pretreatment with test serum. Mitogenic activity recovered in the effluent and in the eluate containing the IgG was measured separately in rabbit lymphocyte culture. A significantly increased recovery in the eluate was found in combination with decreased recovery in the effluent of three sera from Kawasaki disease and one from Streptococcus pyogenes infection among 13 ELISA-positive, antimitogen assay (AMA)-negative sera tested. The nonneutralizing antibody may play an important role in the immune protection against ETA by binding to nonmitogenic epitope(s) on ETA and enabling to handle the toxin not as a superantigen but as a conventional peptide antigen."

CD010502,0,3905230,0,Rapid methods in clinical microbiology. Clinical situations in which rapid methods may best be applied.,"Utilization of rapid microbiologic methods could improve both the quality of patient care and help to reduce patient health care costs through more efficient patient management. Medically urgent situations such as meningitis, endocarditis, bacteremia, some soft tissue infections, ocular infections, and pneumonia in immunocompromised hosts are obvious areas for application of rapid methods. However, efficient management of outpatient infections such as group A streptococcal pharyngitis, bacteriuria, diarrhea, and sexually transmitted diseases could also benefit from rapid test results. Rapid methods for detection of slow growing or unculturable microorganisms represent a promising area for development of new test methodologies. Realization of the potential of various rapid microbiology tests, however, requires that several difficult questions be addressed. Acceptable test rapidity and accuracy must be established by concensus of microbiologists and clinicians. Moreover, new approaches to reduce total test turn-around time and novel means to facilitate physician use of rapid test results must be sought in the immediate future."
CD010502,0,14532204,0,Six-month multicenter study on invasive infections due to group B streptococci in Argentina.,"There is little information about invasive infections by group B streptococci (GBS) and their antimicrobial susceptibilities in Latin America. We performed a prospective multicenter study to determine the serotype distribution and the antimicrobial susceptibility of GBS in Argentina. We identified 58 cases, but only 44 had sufficient data to be evaluated. Eight early-, four late-, and one fatal late, late-onset neonatal infections due to GBS were found. A total of 31 patients were adults with bacteremia, skin and soft tissue infections, osteomyelitis, arthritis, meningitis, abdominal infections, and renal abscess. Serotype III was prevalent in late-onset neonatal disease, and several serotypes (Ia/c, III, Ia, and II) were involved in early-onset neonatal infections. Serotypes II, Ia/c, III, and IV were commonly found in adults, with serotype II prevalent in younger adults (18 to 69 years old) and serotype Ia/c prevalent in elderly adults (>70 years old). The mortality rate attributable to GBS infections was 10.8%. All GBS were susceptible to penicillin and ceftriaxone. Resistance to clindamycin (1.7%), erythromycin (5.2%), azithromycin (5.2%), minocycline (69%), and tetracycline (72.4%), to high levels of kanamycin and amikacin (1.7%), and to intermediately high levels of gentamicin (1.7%) was observed. The bifunctional enzyme AAC6'-APH2"" was detected in the isolate resistant to aminoglycosides, and other genetic determinants were identified in other resistant isolates: tetM and tetO in tetracycline-resistant streptococci and mefA and ermTR for efflux-mediated and inducible macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B-resistant streptococci, respectively. For clinical purposes and rapid and easy detection of high-level aminoglycoside-resistant GBS, a screening method that used 1,000- micro g kanamycin disks is proposed."
CD010502,0,20152073,0,The infections of the upper respiratory tract in children.,"Upper respiratory tract infections in children are common and usually self-limiting conditions, which include acute otitis media (AOM), acute rhinosinusitis (ARS), and acute pharyngitis (AP). Management of pediatric AOM considers observation strategy for selected and uncomplicated cases, older than 2 years of age, only when adequate follow-up can be ensured. Otherwise, an antibiotic treatment should be prescribed. Amoxicillin should be preferred as the first-choice therapy. Switch therapy to ceftriaxone is suggested if amoxicillin regimen failure occurs within 48-72 hours. The diagnosis of ARS is established by the persistence of purulent nasal of post-nasal draining lasting at least 10 days especially if accompanied by supporting symptoms and signs. Amoxicillin is the first choice drug for mild ARS in children. When symptoms persist or worsen, amoxicillin/clavulanate or cefpodoxime proxetil, or ceftriaxone are recommended. Clinical criteria alone are not sufficiently accurate in children with AP to distinguish bacterial and viral etiology. Thus microbiological evaluation is needed and positive throat culture or rapid antigen detection test are required to establish the diagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis and consequently to prescribe antibiotic treatment. The first choice treatment in European countries still remains amoxicillin or amoxicillin/clavulanate."

Genome scale analysis has revealed a complex regulatory network including 13 two-component regulatory systems and more than 100 additional putative regulators, the majority of which remain uncharacterized. Among these is the streptococcal regulator of virulence, Srv, the first Group A Streptococcus member of the Crp/Fnr family of transcriptional regulators. Previous work demonstrated that the loss of srv resulted in a significant decrease in Group A Streptococcus virulence. To begin to define the gene products influenced by Srv, we combined microarray and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis analysis. Loss of srv results in a chromosome wide reduction of gene transcription and changes in the production of the extracellular virulence factors Sic (streptococcal inhibitor of complement) and SpeB (cysteine proteinase). Sic levels are reduced in the srv mutant, whereas the extracellular concentration and activity of SpeB is increased. These data link Srv to the increasingly complex GAS regulatory network."

Based on current concepts a guideline for the management in general practice is developed. If the typical symptoms of streptococcal pharyngo-tonsillitis are present--serious sore throat, fever more than 38.5 degrees C, purulent tonsillar exsudate, painful cervical lymphadenopathy, lack of cough or rhinorrhea--without any other diagnostic procedure penicillin is given for ten days.

CD010502,0,2010631,0,Group B streptococcal C protein-associated antigens: association with neonatal sepsis.,"The c protein (Ibc) of group B streptococci (GBS) is associated with at least four antigens (alpha, beta, gamma, delta). To assess the virulence potential of these antigens, 255 GBS isolates recovered from septic neonates, healthy neonates, and pregnant women were serotyped and surveyed for reactivity with sera to c protein and the four associated antigens. A radioimmunoassay using intact bacteria was used to detect the GBS antigens. In contrast to earlier reports, most (66%) of the type III strains expressed the c protein. Except for the gamma antigen, none of the other c protein-associated antigens showed an increased association with pathogenic strains independent of the polysaccharide antigens. The gamma antigen was expressed by 15 of 41 c protein-positive early-onset strains and by 4 of 38 c protein-positive late-onset strains (P = .007). This association was independent of the type-specific antigen, suggesting a potential role for the gamma antigen as a virulence factor in GBS strains causing early-onset sepsis."

CD010502,0,10191240,0,Type-specific opsonophagocytosis of group A Streptococcus by use of a rapid chemiluminescence assay.,"A whole-blood chemiluminescence (CL) assay was developed to determine the presence of type-specific opsonic antibodies against group A streptococcus (GAS). Convalescent sera with high bactericidal activities against an M-1 serotype were used to opsonize different M-types of GAS. CL responses were monitored for 20 min, and results were expressed as integral counts/minute per phagocyte. CL responses of phagocytes incubated with M-1 GAS opsonized with homologous (M-1) serum were significantly higher than responses of phagocytes incubated with heterologous (M-3) GAS. Adsorption of convalescent serum against the homologous, but not the heterologous, strain markedly reduced the CL response, demonstrating type specificity. The CL assay showed a high correlation with the indirect bactericidal test (r=0.90). In conclusion, this CL assay is a rapid, highly sensitive, specific, and reproducible method for quantifying type-specific opsonic antibodies against GAS and will be a useful tool for future clinical, basic science, and epidemiological studies."

CD010502,0,3327952,0,Study of antibody response to 4 streptococcal antigens in rheumatic fever and Kawasaki disease with or without cardiovascular lesions.,"Patients with rheumatic fever (RF) and Kawasaki disease (MCLS) were divided into two groups, one with and the other without cardiovascular lesions, and their sera were examined for antibodies to 4 streptococcal antigens: anti-streptococcal polysaccharide (ASP), anti-deoxyribonuclease B (ADN-B), anti-streptolysin O (ASO) and anti-streptokinase (ASK) in order to clarify the relationship between group A streptococci and these two diseases. In RF the frequency of positive levels of ASP at its early stage was lower than those of the other 3 antibodies, but the ASP titer tended to persist at elevated levels. The frequency of ADN-B in patients with rheumatic heart disease (RHD) was higher than that in those without RHD, but with regard to the other antibodies no difference was found between the two. Of the 4 antibodies the frequency of at least one positive level was 100% in all the sera of RF patients within 3 months from onset. The differences in the frequencies of positive levels of all 4 antibodies in both MCLS and the controls did not prove to be significant. The frequencies of ASP, ADN-B and ASO in the sera of patients without cardiovascular lesions tended to be slightly higher than those in patients with cardiovascular lesions."
CD010502,0,18619201,0,[T-cell responsiveness to specific group A streptococcus antigens in patients with recurrent erysipelas].,"Peripheral blood leukocytic migratory activity (LMA) was studied in 51 patients with recurrent erysipelas versus 63 patients with primary erysipelas. To reveal LMA, the authors employed in vitro a screening cell migration test as an indicator of the cooperation of T and B lymphocytes and macrophages, by stimulating with polysaccharide A, surface proteins, L-antigen, hyaluronidase, streptolysine-O, and a complete set of Grasse S. pyogenes. In patients with recurrent erysipelas, undulating LMA changes were found in the course of the disease in response to the stimulation with partial specific S. pyogenes antigens. There were differences in the time course of LMA changes, when stimulated with specific surface streptococcus antigens and with components of streptococcus with toxic activity. Significant LMA differences were found in relation to the pattern of a local process: active LMA changes from acceleration to suppression in the erythematous-hemorrhagic form and hyperergic reactions of LMA acceleration in the bullous-hemorrhagic one."
CD010502,0,6368549,0,The complete amino acid sequence of a biologically active 197-residue fragment of M protein isolated from type 5 group A streptococci.,"The complete amino acid sequence of a peptic fragment (Pep M5) of the group A streptococcal type 5 M protein, the antiphagocytic cell surface molecule of the bacteria, is described. This fragment, comprising nearly half of the native M molecule, is biologically active in that it has the ability to interact with opsonic antibodies as well as to evoke such an antibody response in rabbits. The sequence of Pep M5 was determined by automated Edman degradations of the uncleaved molecule and its enzymatically derived peptides. The primary peptides for Edman degradation were the arginine peptides obtained by tryptic digestion. The tryptic cleavage of Pep M5 was limited to the arginyl peptide bonds by derivatizing the epsilon-amino groups of lysine residues by reductive dihydroxypropylation. The overlapping peptides were generated by digestion of the unmodified Pep M5 with chymotrypsin, V8 protease, and subtilisin. The sequence thus established for the Pep M5 molecule consists of a total of 197 residues (Mr = 22,705). The Pep M5 protein contains some identical, or nearly so, repeating sequences: four 7-residue segments and two 10-residue segments. However, extensive sequence repeats of the kind previously reported within the partial sequence of another M protein serotype, namely Pep M24, were absent. The Pep M5 sequence is distinct from, but exhibits some homology with, the partial sequences of two other M protein serotypes, namely, Pep M6 and Pep M24. Furthermore, the 7-residue periodicity of the nonpolar and charged residues, an alpha-helical coiled-coil structural characteristic that was previously observed within the partial sequences of M proteins, was found to extend over a significant part of the Pep M5 sequence. The implication of these results to the function and immunological diversity in M proteins is discussed."

CD010502,0,6084283,0,Autoimmune mechanisms in the pathogenesis of rheumatic fever.,"The etiologic agent of acute rheumatic fever is the group A streptococcus; however, its role in the pathogenesis of this disease is not well understood. Epidemiologic and immunologic evidence suggests that there is a population at risk and that the nature of the host response to streptococcal antigens and the physicochemical nature of the streptococcal antigens all play a significant role in determining the natural history of the disease process. Furthermore, the genetic control of the interaction of the host with the streptococci is clearly involved in a set of events--as yet obscure--that result in acute rheumatic fever. Neither antibody-mediated nor cell-mediated hypersensitivity reactions have been demonstrated in vivo or in vitro that wholly reproduce the characteristics of this disease. Additional studies of the regulation of the immune response and of human immunogenetics are essential for gaining further insight into the pathogenesis of acute rheumatic fever."
CD010502,0,10655391,0,Specific and rapid detection by fluorescent in situ hybridization of bacteria in clinical samples obtained from cystic fibrosis patients.,"We report on the rapid and specific detection of bacteria commonly isolated from clinical specimens from cystic fibrosis (CF) patients by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). On the basis of comparative sequence analysis, we designed oligonucleotide probes complementary to species-specific 16S rRNA regions of these microorganisms and demonstrated the specificities of the probes by hybridization of different remotely related as well as closely related reference strains. Furthermore, in a pilot project we investigated 75 sputum samples and 10 throat swab specimens from CF patients by FISH and detected Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cepacia, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Haemophilus influenzae, and Staphylococcus aureus within these specimens. The specificity of FISH was 100% in comparison to the results of conventional microbial culture. In contrast, the sensitivity of standard laboratory cultivation was moderately higher, since the limit for microscopic detection of bacteria within sputum samples by FISH was approximately 4 x 10(5) CFU/ml of sputum (resulting in a 90% sensitivity for FISH). Moreover, we demonstrated that FISH will be useful for the rapid detection of bacteria that cause acute pulmonary exacerbations in CF patients, as demonstrated in patients with H. influenzae, S. aureus, and P. aeruginosa exacerbations. Therefore, FISH is a valuable additional method for the rapid and specific detection of bacteria in clinical samples from CF patients, in particular, patients with pulmonary exacerbations."
CD010502,0,3053759,0,Microtechnique for serum opacity factor characterization of group A streptococci adaptable to the use of human sera.,"We have developed a microtechnique for detection of streptococcal serum opacity factor (OF) and for typing of group A streptococci by inhibition of OF. This technique, which involves the use of single wells of standard 96-well tissue culture plates, offers several advantages over previous methods: no advance test preparation is required, allowing tests to be quickly and easily performed; only small quantities of reagents are required; results can be determined visually (qualitative) or by using a photometric enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate reader (quantitative); and human serum samples may be quickly and easily screened for OF-inhibitory antibody and subsequently used in place of difficult-to-produce and expensive hyperimmune animal sera for OF characterization of group A streptococci. Fifty-eight samples of normal adult human serum were tested by this new microtechnique for anti-OF antibodies, and 49 (84%) were found to have antibody against 1 or more of the 27 recognized OF-positive serotypes. OF antibodies to M-4, M-2, M-75, and M-48 were most common in these individuals. These 58 human serum samples collectively contained antibody to 25 of the 27 different OF-producing serotypes. Serum samples from four individuals were tested for persistence of OF antibody. OF antibodies to eight different serotypes present in the serum samples collected 7 to 12 years previously were present in the freshly collected sera, indicating that OF antibody persists in human antisera for many years. This new technique has distinct advantages and makes it possible for many laboratories to use this technique to characterize group A streptococci."

Since all group A Streptococcus pyogenes (GAS) strains examined express the sib 35 gene, we evaluated the Sib 35 as a vaccine candidate against GAS infections. We detected significantly higher anti-Sib 35 IgG antibody titers in sera from patients with GAS infections than from healthy volunteers. Immunization of mice with Sib 35 induced antigen-specific IgG antibodies in their sera, and rabbit Sib 35-specific antiserum showed opsonic activity. Immunization with Sib 35 enhanced survival rates in mice challenged with a GAS strain, while exhibiting no toxicity in hosts. We conclude that Sib 35 is a promising vaccine for prevention of GAS infections."
CD010502,0,10931141,0,Autoantibodies in the sera of patients with rheumatic heart disease: characterization of myocardial antigens by two-dimensional immunoblotting and N-terminal sequence analysis.,"The concept of antigenic mimicry in autoimmune diseases such as rheumatic fever has been under investigation for decades and the range of cross-reactive tissue antigens for streptococcal-induced antibodies identified in rheumatic heart disease is still expanding. To identify heart tissue-reactive antigens which may be implicated in the secondary immunopathogenesis of rheumatic fever, sera from 56 patients with acute rheumatic heart disease were probed in two-dimensional Western blots for reactivity against heart tissue antigens. After two-dimensional immunoblot analysis, proteins were submitted to N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis. This analysis identified creatine kinase, two mitochondrial proteins and, at a low level, various stress proteins as cross-reactive myocardial antigens. Therefore, in addition to myosin, creatine kinase may represent another major antigen for autoreactive antibodies in rheumatic heart disease. Mitochondrial proteins have been implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory heart disease for some years, and in this study we have identified two mitochondrial proteins as relevant antigens in rheumatic heart disease."
CD010502,0,14638753,0,"Genomic location and variation of the gene for CRS, a complement binding protein in the M57 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes.","All isolates of serotype M1 of group A streptococci possess a gene for streptococcal inhibitor of complement (SIC) in the mga regulon, which harbors genes for other virulence factors, such as M and M-like proteins, C5a peptidase, and a regulator. In serotype M57 the gene for a protein that is closely related to SIC (crs57) is located outside the mga regulon. We mapped the location of the crs57 gene in six strains of emm57 (gene encoding the M57 protein) sequence types to an intergenic region between the ABC transporter gene (SPy0778) and the gene for a small ribosomal protein (rpsU). The noncoding sequences on both sides of crs57 exhibited high degrees of identity to the corresponding regions of sic from M1 strains. This included one of the inverted repeat sequences of IS1562 but not the insertion element itself. These observations suggest that crs57 was recently acquired by serotype M57 or its progenitor via horizontal acquisition from serotype M1. The six emm57 sequence type isolates analyzed in this study belong to two distinct molecular types (vir types VT8 and VT101). Although the crs57 sequences from VT8 strains had very few substitution mutations, the VT101 crs57 sequence had a large number of such mutations. The CRS57 proteins from these strains are secretory products and have the ability to bind to complement proteins. All these proteins contain several tryptophan-rich repeats designated DWS motifs and internal repeat sequences. In all of these structural and biochemical characteristics CRS57 resembles SIC from M1 strains. Hence, CRS57 has a functional role similar to that of SIC in an M1 strain."

The FA test was performed in parallel with established confirmation procedures on all organisms growing on 773 primary culture plates of modified Thayer-Martin agar. All N. gonorrhoeae isolates reacted with the FA reagent and produced a bright, easily interpretable fluorescence. The FA test correctly identified 533 N. gonorrhoeae isolates from 474 patients and did not react with 90 N. meningitidis or with 213 non-Neisseria isolates. In one city (Baltimore), Gonochek II (Du Pont Co., Wilmington, Del.) failed to identify four N. gonorrhoeae isolates reactive with the FA reagent and confirmed as N. gonorrhoeae by Phadebact (Pharmacia Inc., Piscataway, N.J.) and acid production from sugars.

CD010502,0,7620771,0,[The determination of antistreptokinase by an immunoenzyme method].,"The sensitivity of enzyme immunoassay (EIA) of antistreptokinase, a new method for its measurements, is 10 times higher than the sensitivity of the prototype method. EIA is more sensitive than the prototype method, the incorrectness of the latter being ruled out; endogenous substrates, patients's blood fibrinogen and plasminogen, are used, whose concentrations vary in streptococcal diseases. Effects of nonspecific blood proteinase which, together with streptokinase, may cause a proteolytic effect, on the results of analysis are also ruled out. Microquantities of blood serum are needed for EIA of streptokinase, whereas at least 2 ml of plasma is required for the prototype test. The suggested method is more informative, since it detects the diagnostic titers in a wider range, vs. the prototype technique, and is more diagnostically valuable in comparison with other tests for the diagnosis of streptococcal infection, detection of antistreptolysin 0 and antihyaluronidase."

Polyclonal rabbit antiserum against partially purified antigen from elementary body (EB) antibody and horse-radish peroxidase conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody were used as the primary and secondary antibody respectively. The developed EIA could detect protein of partially purified EB at the lowest concentration of 250 ng/ml. The assay was evaluated against the cell culture (CC), DNA hybridization assay (PACE2 system: Gen-Probe, San Diego, CA, USA) and a commercial enzyme immunoassay (kEIA) (Bioquest, NSW, Australia). The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of the developed EIA (dEIA) were 87, 96.2, 80, 97.7 for the specimens from females and 90.9, 90.7, 71.4, 97.5 for the specimens from males repectively. Cross reaction was not found with Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter anitratus, beta-Streptococcus group A, Enterobacter spp, Enterococcus, Lactobacillus spp, Neisseria spp, but it was found with Candida albicans and herpes simplex virus type 1. The developed EIA can be applied successfully for both genders, particularly males. The cost per test is less than those for CC, kEIA and PACE2."

CD010502,0,9149166,0,Immune responses against Streptococcus pyogenes in human palatine tonsils.,"We investigated cellular immunity against Streptococcus pyogenes in human tonsils by measuring antigen-specific immunoglobulin-secreting cells and the production of cytokines from CD4+ T cells in response to M proteins. The incidence of S pyogenes in tonsils was significantly higher in patients with recurrent tonsillitis (RT) than in patients with tonsillar hypertrophy (TH). M protein-specific immunoglobulin A (IgA) and immunoglobulin G spot-forming cells were increased in patients with RT compared with patients with TH. In RT the number of M protein-specific IgA spot-forming cells was significantly greater in the S pyogenes-negative subjects than in the S pyogenes-positive subjects. Proliferation of CD4+ T cells and production of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and interleukins -2, -4, -5, and -6 (IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, and IL-6) from those T cells were observed in response to M protein. The concentrations of IFN-gamma and IL-4 were higher in RT than in TH. These findings suggest that S pyogenes is associated with the pathogenesis of RT and that immune responses against M protein may play an important role in preventing the colonization of this bacteria in tonsils."

CD010502,0,3298593,1,Performance of an enzyme immunoassay test and anaerobic culture for detection of group A streptococci in a pediatric practice versus a hospital laboratory.,"The ability of pediatricians and hospital laboratory personnel to detect group A streptococci in patients with suspected streptococcal pharyngitis was evaluated using the TestPack Strep A and anaerobic culture. Duplicate throat specimens (for similar processing by both the pediatricians and laboratory technologists) were simultaneously collected on rayon-tipped swabs from patients with symptoms of pharyngitis. Each swab was first inoculated to a 5% sheep blood agar plate, then tested for group A streptococcus antigen using the TestPack Strep A according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cultures were incubated anaerobically at 35 degrees C for 2 nights unless positive after 1 night. Group A streptococci were identified using specific antisera. Pediatric office or laboratory cultures from 112 (31.3%) of the 358 patients contained group A streptococci. Of the patients with positive cultures, 96 (85.7%) and 107 (95.5%) were detected by the pediatricians and laboratory, respectively. Respective findings with the TestPack Strep A by the pediatricians and laboratory were sensitivity 68.8% and 74.8%, specificity 94.3% and 95.6%, predictive value of a positive result 81.5% and 87.9%, and predictive value of a negative result 89.2% and 89.9%. Anaerobic culture was significantly more sensitive than the TestPack Strep A for detection of group A streptococci by both the pediatricians (P less than 0.005) and laboratory personnel (P less than 0.05)."

CD010502,0,7007421,0,Hemolysin and K antigens in relation to serotype and hemagglutination type of Escherichia coli isolated from extraintestinal infections.,"Escherichia coli isolated from cases of bacteremia and from a variety of urinary tract infections were characterized according to serotype (O:H antigenicity), K type (possession of K1, K2, K3, K12, or K13), hemagglutination (HA) type, and production of beta-hemolysin. Results obtained with the bacteremia and urinary tract infection isolates were similar except for more hemolytic isolated from urine than from blood (42 versus 29%) and more K1+ isolates from blood than from urine (50 versus 29%). A close correlation was found between Ha type VI (production of fimbriae which mediate mannose-resistant HA of human and African green monkey erythrocytes) and the production of hemolysin or K1 capsular antigen or both. Most (95 of 98, or 95%) of the HA type VI+ blood isolates and most (146 of 164, or 89%) of the HA type VI+ urine isolates produced hemolysin or K1 or both, in contrast to 22 and 26%, respectively, of those belonging to HA types other than HA type VI. Also, 76% of all hemolytic and 70% of all K1+ isolates belonged to HA type VI. Remarkably few of the HA type VI+ isolates (13%) and even fewer of the HA type VI- isolates (3%) produced both K1 and hemolysin; these belonged mainly to serotypes O16:H6, O18:H7 and O2:H4. Other major serogroups were usually K1+/hemolysin- (O1, O7) or K1-/hemolysin+ (O2, O4, O6). At least 74% (262 of 351) and possibly as many as 83% (293 of 351) of those isolates which produced mannose-resistant HA of human erythrocytes were classified as HA type VI+; 31 isolates produced mannose-resistant HA with all erythrocytes tested. Taking serogroup and serotype into consideration, we conclude that the E. coli fimbrial hemagglutinin(s) responsible for the HA type VI phenotype will prove to be the same as the virulence-associated mannose-resistant adhesins of uropathogenic E. coli which other investigators have characterized as unique fimbrial antigens detectable by mannose-resistant HA of human erythrocytes."
CD010502,0,6337096,0,Human neutrophil chemotactic response to group A streptococci: bacteria-mediated interference with complement-derived chemotactic factors.,"The influence of M protein on the capacity of group A streptococci to generate neutrophil chemotactic activity in normal human serum was examined. Incubation of serum with M- bacteria for up to 10 min led to the production of chemotactic activity. In contrast, incubation of serum with M+ bacteria did not elicit serum chemotactic activity over a 1-h period, even though complement was activated to completion. Further experiments revealed that both M+ and M- bacteria could inhibit the chemotactic activity of serum preexposed to zymosan. However, the M+ bacteria possessed a 130-fold-greater inhibitory capacity in this regard than the M- bacteria. This antichemotactic property was not detectable in the fluid phase of serum incubated with bacteria, thereby ruling out neutrophil-directed effects. Treatment of the bacteria with trypsin resulted in the release of the inhibitory molecule, suggesting that proteins are involved in its maintenance at the cell surface. However, the resistance of the chemotactic factor inactivator to pepsin and trypsin indicated that the protease-sensitive M protein was not involved. These results demonstrate a heretofore uncharacterized activity of group A streptococci that may contribute to virulence through modulation of the host chemotactic response."
CD010502,0,3314258,0,Group B streptococci in the milk of lactating mothers.,"A total of 1132 samples of maternal milk expressed from the disinfected breast on the first days after parturition were subjected to microbiological examination. Contamination by group B streptococci (Streptococcus agalactiae) was demonstrated in 40 samples (3.53%). Strains carrying the antigens Ia, Ia/c, Ib/c, II, III and R were represented among the isolates. Type Ia/c was the commonest; antigens II and III were always combined with the R antigen. The milk was either very strongly contaminated with almost pure culture demonstrable by direct cultivation of the milk sediment, or only isolated colonies were obtained in primary culture, often not until after enrichment. If the first samples gave dense growths, second-sample cultures were also positive. The strains isolated from samples of the individual mothers milk differed by their antigenic type structure; this gave evidence that the infection was not of nosocomial origin. Immunoglobulin levels in the whey of positive samples were not different from the whey of mothers not shedding group B streptococci. The health of both mothers and infants did not deviate from the general average for normal mothers and infants. No signs common to all the mothers shedding group B streptococci in their milk and no marked effect on the infants' health up to the age of 1-2 years were established."
CD010502,0,2201548,0,Ontogeny of the humoral response to group A streptococcal carbohydrate: class and IgG subclass composition of antibodies in children.,"We determined isotypes of natural antibodies to streptococcal group A carbohydrate (A-CHO) in sera from 101 children between 1 and 16 years of age, using a calibrated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system. Anti-A-CHO IgM could be detected in all but one sera. Median levels increased with age and were highest between 8 and 12 years. IgG antibodies were present at low concentrations up to the age of 4 years, and consisted predominantly of the IgG1 subclass. Between 4 and 8 years, concentrations of anti-A-CHO IgG markedly increased and median levels continued to increase through age 12-16. Anti-A-CHO IgG1 levels closely followed the pattern of IgG antibody concentrations. The number of IgG2 antibody positive sera was low in young children, as expected. In the 8-12 year age group and later, anti-A-CHO IgG2 was present in more than half of the samples, and in children between 12 and 16, medians of IgG2 and IgG1 antibodies were similar. Sera containing anti-A-CHO IgG3 were rare in children up to 4 years of age, but in the group of 4-8-year-old children, this subclass was detectable in 36% and later in up to 77% of the sera. Thus, the IgG response to A-CHO showed a clear maturation during childhood, involving the subclasses IgG1, IgG2 and IgG3. There were no significant differences in A-CHO levels between boys and girls."
CD010502,0,2107199,0,Serological response in Enterococcus faecalis endocarditis determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.,"Enterococcus (Streptococcus) faecalis expresses three species-specific surface protein antigens of molecular weights 73,000, 40,000, and 37,000. On Western blotting (immunoblotting), they were detected strongly by immunoglobulin G (IgG) in sera from patients with E. faecalis endocarditis, but not in sera from patients with other E. faecalis infections or with endocarditis due to other streptococci. We developed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system to measure IgG, IgM, and IgA levels to these antigens and evaluated its potential as a serodiagnostic test for E. faecalis endocarditis. The test correctly diagnosed E. faecalis endocarditis in 15 of 16 cases. Of 10 cases of endocarditis due to other streptococci and 10 E. faecalis infections other than endocarditis, 9 and 8, respectively, gave negative results. The test should prove particularly useful in culture-negative cases, for which choice of appropriate antibiotic therapy for E. faecalis endocarditis is vital."
CD010502,0,20132259,0,Epidemiological markers of Streptococcus pyogenes strains in Tunisia.,"To further understand the epidemiology of Streptococcus pyogenes or group A streptococcus (GAS) infections in Tunisia, phenotypic and genomic markers of GAS isolates, including antibiotic susceptibility, biotypes, T and emm types and toxin gene profiles, have been characterized. A total of 103 isolates, collected between 2000 and 2006, were investigated; 47 were recovered from invasive infections, and 56 from non-invasive infections. Rates of resistance to tetracycline, erythromycin, clindamycin and rifampin were 70.8%, 4.8%, 4.8% and 0.9%, respectively. High levels of resistance to streptomycin and kanamycin were observed in 1.9% and 4.8% of isolates, respectively. Biotype 3 was most common. Twenty different T patterns were observed, with a predominance of T3/13/B3264, and 38 different emm types. In both invasive and non-invasive isolates, emm118 (9.7%), emm42 (8.7%), emm1 (7.8%), st432 (6.8%), emm28 (5.8%) and emm76 (5.8%) were the most prevalent types; emm1, emm76 and emm18 were mainly observed among invasive infections, whereas emm118 (12.5%), emm42 (10.7%) and emm28 (8.9%) were predominant among non-invasive infections. The speB gene was detected in all isolates, but there were variable frequencies of speA, speC and ssa (20.3%, 32% and 25.2% respectively). Significant associations of emm1, emm18 and emm3 with speA and of emm4 and st432 with ssa were found. This first report from Tunisia revealed a unique emm distribution of GAS that differs from those of other regions. This information on the distribution of such emm types will be useful for the development of an appropriate vaccine in a country where the incidence of rheumatic fever remains high."
CD010502,0,6337099,0,Lipoteichoic acid is the major cell wall component responsible for surface hydrophobicity of group A streptococci.,The contribution of lipoteichoic acid (LTA) to the hydrophobic surface properties of group A streptococci was investigated in aqueous dextran-polyethylene glycol two-phase systems. Enzymatic digestions were performed to characterize the hydrophobic surface structure. The results obtained indicated that LTA is a major factor responsible for the hydrophobic character of the cell surface of group A streptococci. This was further supported by the similarity of partition in polymer two-phase systems between whole group A streptococci and tritiated LTA extracted from a group A streptococcal strain. Surface LTA was also determined on intact organisms by a new method measuring the adsorption of antibodies to LTA to the bacterial surface. A correlation was found between the content of surface LTA and the hydrophobicity of the group A streptococci. We conclude that surface-associated LTA is the major factor determining surface hydrophobicity of group A streptococci.

The rates of detection of the pneumococcal antigens in the urine or serum of the patients with pneumococcal pneumonia, pneumococcal bacteremia and pneumococcal meningitis were 0.38, 0.47 and 0.5, respectively. The overall detection rate for H. influenzae infections was 0.92 and for group B streptococcal infections 0.87. Serum and urine from 100 non-infected patients were also tested for the presence of group B streptococcus, S. pneumoniae, N. meningitidis and H. influenzae type b antigens with only 1 false positive (H. influenzae type b)."

Swabs of nose, ear and throat of divers and their tank regulators, i.e. the divers and their diving gear, were taken before and after routine dives. Blood samples were collected before and 30-60 days after each dive to measure IgG and IgA titers against the whole cell antigen of V. cholerae O1. Nine strains of V. cholerae O1 and nine strains of V. cholerae non-O1 were isolated during this study. These isolates were identified by conventional biochemical tests and indirect fluorescent antibody staining methods, using fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled monoclonal antibody, COLTA, prepared against the 'A' antigenic factor of the lipopolysaccharide of V. cholerae O1, and serotyped by slide agglutination. Seven of the nine strains of V. cholerae O1 isolated and successfully cultured during the studies, were toxigenic by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and polymerase chain reaction. Analyses of IgG and IgA antibodies of the divers showed that most of the divers had prior exposure to V. cholerae O1. V. cholerae serotype non-O1 strains isolated during the study were found to be non-toxigenic."
CD010502,0,7583928,0,Distinct profiles of immunoglobulin G-binding-protein expression by invasive serotype M1 isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes.,"Analysis of immunoglobulin G (IgG)-binding-protein expression by invasive group A streptococcal isolates of the M1 serotype collected as part of a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention surveillance study revealed two distinct phenotypes. One group of type M1 isolates expressed a surface protein reactive with all four human IgG subclasses (type IIo), while a second group expressed a surface protein demonstrating significant reactivity only with human IgG3 (type IIb). The functional forms of IgG-binding protein were antigenically related, and both were recognized by a rabbit polyclonal antiserum to serotype M1 but not by normal rabbit serum. While the quantities of antigenic M1 protein present in the extracts of representative isolates displaying each phenotype differed, the functional differences were found to be qualitative and not solely quantitative. The IgG-binding properties of these antigenically related M1 proteins could be readily distinguished from those of another IgG-binding protein, protein H. Type M1 isolates of the IIb phenotype differed from those of the IIo phenotype by secreting larger amounts of a casein-hydrolyzing protease into culture supernatants."
CD010502,0,7852559,1,"Evaluation of two rapid antigen assays, BioStar Strep A OIA and Pacific Biotech CARDS O.S., and culture for detection of group A streptococci in throat swabs.","Two rapid methods, BioStar Strep A OIA (OIA; BioStar, Inc., Boulder, Colo.), an optical immunoassay, and CARDS O.S. (O.S.; Pacific Biotech, Inc., San Diego, Calif.), a color immunochromographic assay, and two culture methods, one with 5% sheep blood agar (SBA) and one with Todd-Hewitt broth (TH; Remel, Lenexa, Kans.), were evaluated for use in the detection of Streptococcus pyogenes from pharnygeal swabs. Seven hundred forty-six double swabs (Culturette II) were processed, with OIA and SBA culture performed on one swab and O.S. and SBA culture performed on the other swab. The pledget from the Culturette II was incubated overnight in TH and was subcultured onto SBA for an additional 48 h in ambient air. All beta-hemolytic streptococci from culture were tested by a direct fluorescent-antibody test (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, Mich.). Specimens with discordant fluorescent-antibody test and rapid test results were also tested by using the Streptex latex agglutination reagent (Murex Diagnostics Limited, Dartford, England). The results obtained by all testing methods were compared with a combined test result (""gold standard""), which was defined as any positive culture detected by the SBA or TH culture methods and confirmed by Streptex latex agglutination or, in the case of negative results by both culture methods, a concomitant positive result by OIA and O.S. antigen testing. Sensitivity and specificity results for each of the methods were as follows, respectively: OIA, 81.0 and 97.5%; O.S., 74.4 and 99.0%; SBA culture, 92.3 and 98.3%; and TH culture, 86.4 and 100%. Both OIA and O.S. are suitable screening methods for detecting S. pyogenes directly from throat swabs but are of insufficient sensitivity to eliminate the need for backup cultures for specimens with negative OIA and O.S. results."
CD010502,0,2028828,0,Experience with rapid latex agglutination testing for group A streptococcal pharyngitis in a pediatric group office laboratory.,"We evaluated 2401 patients with suspected streptococcal pharyngitis with the Culturette 10-minute Group A Strep ID test during a 6-month period in order to determine its suitability for rapid diagnosis in a busy private office practice. Duplicate throat swabs were obtained for each child, and latex agglutination was performed within 15 minutes. In children with negative latex agglutination results, the second swab was cultured. All latex agglutination results were available within 20 minutes of collection, while the patients waited in the office. Seven hundred thirty-eight specimens were positive by latex agglutination. Seventy-eight of the 1663 latex negative specimens contained group A streptococci on culture (sensitivity 90 percent). Approximately 60 percent of these latex-negative, culture-positive specimens demonstrated 3(+)-4+ growth in culture, unlike previous studies ascribing false-negative latex results to low colony count specimens. Fifty percent of bacitracin-susceptible streptococci tested were not group A, indicating a relatively high occurrence of nongroup A beta-hemolytic streptococcal carriage in this patient population. The use of latex agglutination for detection of group A streptococcal pharyngitis was well-suited to our office practice, even during an extremely busy winter season. Although this assay appears to have a relatively high sensitivity, it is still prudent to culture latex-negative swabs to exclude group A streptococcal infection. The significance of nongroup A beta-hemolytic streptococci in our patient population was unclear. Further refinements are necessary."
CD010502,0,12379699,0,Acquisition of regulators of complement activation by Streptococcus pyogenes serotype M1.,"Opsonization of bacteria by complement proteins is an important component of the immune response. The pathogenic bacterium Streptococcus pyogenes has evolved multiple mechanisms for the evasion of complement-mediated opsonization. One mechanism involves the binding of human regulators of complement activation such as factor H (FH) and FH-like protein 1 (FHL-1). Acquisition of these regulatory proteins can limit deposition of the opsonin C3b on bacteria, thus decreasing the pathogen's susceptibility to phagocytosis. Binding of complement regulatory proteins by S. pyogenes has previously been attributed to the streptococcal M and M-like proteins. Here, we report that the S. pyogenes cell surface protein Fba can mediate binding of FH and FHL-1. We constructed mutant derivatives of S. pyogenes that lack Fba, M1 protein, or both proteins and assayed the strains for FH binding, susceptibility to phagocytosis, and C3 deposition. Fba expression was found to be sufficient for binding of purified FH as well as for binding of FH and FHL-1 from human plasma. Plasma adsorption experiments also revealed that M1(+) Fba(+) streptococci preferentially bind FHL-1, whereas M1(-) Fba(+) streptococci have similar affinities for FH and FHL-1. Fba was found to contribute to the survival of streptococci incubated with human blood and to inhibit C3 deposition on bacterial cells. Streptococci harvested from log-phase cultures readily bound FH, but binding was greatly reduced for bacteria obtained from stationary-phase cultures. Bacteria cultured in the presence of the protease inhibitor E64 maintained FH binding activity in stationary phase, suggesting that Fba is removed from the cell surface via proteolysis. Western analyses confirmed that E64 stabilizes cell surface expression of Fba. These data indicate that Fba is an antiopsonic, antiphagocytic protein that may be regulated by cell surface proteolysis."
CD010502,0,8873386,0,"Recombinant, octavalent group A streptococcal M protein vaccine.","One of the major obstacles to the development of group A streptococcal M protein vaccines is the multiplicity of M serotypes expressed by these organisms. In this study, we have constructed a recombinant, hybrid M protein that contains type-specific aminoterminal fragments of eight different M proteins. We show that the purified hybrid recombinant protein is immunogenic in rabbits and evokes antibodies that react with native M proteins from the respective streptococcal serotypes. In addition, the immune sera evoked by the octavalent protein opsonized six of the eight serotypes of streptococci, indicating that the majority of the M protein fragments contained protective epitopes that retained their native conformations in the hybrid protein. None of the antisera raised against the octavalent protein crossreacted with human heart tissue. These studies indicate that multivalent, hybrid M proteins may be used to elicit broadly protective immune responses against multiple serotypes of group A streptococci."

CD010502,0,1468160,0,Failure to detect unique reactivity to streptococcal streptokinase in either the sera or renal biopsy specimens of patients with acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis.,"Using purified group A streptokinase (SKA) as the antigen, ELISA assays were carried out on the sera of normal unaffected children, acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis patients (APSGN) and acute rheumatic fever patients (ARF). The results demonstrate that antibody titers to SKA increase with age in normal children and by age 8 years the vast majority of children have antibodies to SKA. APSGN patients did not demonstrate unique reactivity to SKA when compared to ARF patients either at time of onset of disease or during convalescence. Polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies to SKA which recognize both group A and C streptokinase failed to detect the presence of streptokinase in the biopsy sections obtained from ten well-documented APSGN patients. We conclude that there is no unique reactivity to group A streptokinase in the sera of APSGN patients. Furthermore, we failed to demonstrate the presence of streptokinase in the biopsy specimens of an early case of APSGN patients."

CD010502,0,7505389,0,VirR and Mry are homologous trans-acting regulators of M protein and C5a peptidase expression in group A streptococci.,"Transcription of the group A streptococcal M12 protein gene (emm12) and the C5a peptidase gene (scpA), which encodes an inhibitor of complement-mediated chemotaxis, was previously shown to depend on a third genetic locus, designated virR. A 1.6 kb region of DNA which is 200 bp upstream of emm12 and is thought to contain the virR locus, was sequenced. An open reading frame which overlaps deletion mutations that define virR was identified. The sequence of the encoded VirR protein, which was deduced to contain 499 amino acids, is characteristic of cytoplasmic proteins. Comparison of the VirR protein to a variety of DNA binding proteins, such as lambda Cro, revealed a DNA binding motif. VirR was also compared to the M6 positive regulator, mry, and found to be 98% homologous. The predicted virR promoter is preceded by two sets of inverted repeats, in contrast to mry which is preceded by one repeat. Introduction of virR on the shuttle vector pAM401 into a strain of group A Streptococcus with a deletion in the chromosomal virR gene demonstrated that the VirR protein activated transcription of both emm12 and scpA genes in trans. Analysis of RNA by Northern blot using virR-specific probes identified two virR transcripts, a 1.6 kb transcript which corresponds to the predicted size of the gene, and a second transcript, 3.5 kb, which also overlaps virR. These results demonstrate that virR and mry are structurally and functionally very similar and show that the former is a trans activator of both M protein and C5a peptidase synthesis."
CD010502,0,10438388,0,Synthesis and preclinical evaluation of glycoconjugate vaccines against group B Streptococcus types VI and VIII.,"Group B Streptococcus (GBS) types VI and VIII are prevalent among serotypes isolated from pregnant women in Japan. Maternal vaccination with a safe and effective GBS vaccine has been proposed as a rational approach to prevent neonatal GBS disease. Because antibody specific for the capsular polysaccharide (CPS) antigens of GBS is protective, vaccines were developed with purified type VI and VIII CPS coupled to tetanus toxoid. In rabbits the newly synthesized conjugate vaccines elicited high-titered, type-specific antibody that was opsonically active in vitro. Moreover, litters born to mice actively vaccinated with the conjugate vaccines, in contrast to uncoupled CPS or saline, were protected against an ordinarily lethal challenge of GBS of homologous serotype. GBS types VI and VIII conjugate vaccines of the design presented may be important components of a multivalent GBS vaccine for use in regions where these serotypes predominate."

CD010502,0,11500404,0,T-cell reactivity against streptococcal antigens in the periphery mirrors reactivity of heart-infiltrating T lymphocytes in rheumatic heart disease patients.,"T-cell molecular mimicry between streptococcal and heart proteins has been proposed as the triggering factor leading to autoimmunity in rheumatic heart disease (RHD). We searched for immunodominant T-cell M5 epitopes among RHD patients with defined clinical outcomes and compared the T-cell reactivities of peripheral blood and intralesional T cells from patients with severe RHD. The role of HLA class II molecules in the presentation of M5 peptides was also evaluated. We studied the T-cell reactivity against M5 peptides and heart proteins on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from 74 RHD patients grouped according to the severity of disease, along with intralesional and peripheral T-cell clones from RHD patients. Peptides encompassing residues 1 to 25, 81 to 103, 125 to 139, and 163 to 177 were more frequently recognized by PBMC from RHD patients than by those from controls. The M5 peptide encompassing residues 81 to 96 [M5(81-96) peptide] was most frequently recognized by PBMC from HLA-DR7+ DR53+ patients with severe RHD, and 46.9% (15 of 32) and 43% (3 of 7) of heart-infiltrating and PBMC-derived peptide-reactive T-cell clones, respectively, recognized the M5(81-103) region. Heart proteins were recognized more frequently by PBMC from patients with severe RHD than by those from patients with mild RHD. The similar pattern of T-cell reactivity found with both peripheral blood and heart-infiltrating T cells is consistent with the migration of M-protein-sensitized T cells to the heart tissue. Conversely, the presence of heart-reactive T cells in the PBMC of patients with severe RHD also suggests a spillover of sensitized T cells from the heart lesion."
CD010502,0,18648827,0,An investigation of antistreptococcal antibody responses in guttate psoriasis.,"In two-thirds of patients with guttate psoriasis (GP), there is good evidence that the eruption is triggered by a streptococcal throat infection. We attempted to determine if a specific epitope of the bacterial pathogen was associated with the humoral immune response in GP patients. Antibody titres against beta-haemolytic streptococci (BHS) extracts in sera from 14 patients with GP, 10 healthy controls and 10 chronic plaque psoriasis (CPP) patients were determined by ELISA. Antibody BHS reactivity was investigated using immunoblotting, followed by epitope mapping using peptide-phage display. The highest GP antibody titres (10,000-25,000) were found in sera that had a matching streptococcal isolate, three sera had high (5,000-12,500) and seven had raised titres (500-5,000). In the healthy control group, three had relatively high and seven lower titres. All the CPP sera had very low titres (<500). In the immunoblots, three major bands were recognised by all the GP sera, and, to a lesser extent, by four healthy controls. No GP-specific protein was identified. Epitope mapping identified 10 phage clones that specifically bound 2 or 3 GP sera, displaying five different peptide sequences that were not streptococcal in origin. These findings suggest that the antigen specificity of the humoral response to BHS in GP does not differ from that of non-psoriatic individuals."
CD010502,0,17373325,0,[Therapeutic effects and prognostic factors in tonsillectomy patients with IgA nephropathy].,"Because upper respiratory tract infections, particularly tonsillitis, often precede IgA nephropathy (IgAN), IgAN is now recognized as a tonsil-related disease, and reports have shown that tonsillectomy is effective in preventing disease progression in IgAN patients. IgA may thus play an important role in IgAN pathogenesis and development. B cell activation factor belonging to the TNF family (BAFF) is expressed by monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells, and may be the mechanism by which macrophages and dendritic cells directly regulate human B-cell activation. BAFF acts as a potent B-cell growth factor and costimulator of immunoglobulin production, including IgA. We studied therapeutic effects and serum BAFF levels as prognostic factors."
CD010502,0,16702013,0,Streptococcus pyogenes induces epithelial inflammatory responses through NF-kappaB/MAPK signaling pathways.,"Innate immunity involves a cascade of inflammatory events, resulting in the secretion of chemokines and cytokines to recruit mediator cells in adaptive immunity. To study epithelial inflammatory responses initiated by Streptococcus pyogenes infection, we investigated chemotaxis ability in the supernatant of infected human respiratory epithelial HEp-2 cells. Our results showed that these supernatants showed significantly increased ability to attract monocytes, implying the release of inflammatory chemoattractants into the medium. Expression of interleukin (IL)-8 and IL-6 in HEp-2 cells was significantly increased at both the mRNA and protein levels after infection with S. pyogenes. Electrophoretic mobility shift and reporter-gene assays demonstrated that the transcription factors NF-kappaB and AP-1, regulated by mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase, were activated after streptococcal infection. The increases in mRNAs for IL-8 and IL-6 were abrogated by addition of NF-kappaB and MAP kinase inhibitors, suggesting that the upregulation of IL-8 and IL-6 is mediated through NF-kappaB and MAP kinase signaling pathways. Taken together, our results indicate that S. pyogenes infection of epithelial cells induces the secretion of pro-inflammatory chemokines/cytokines through activation of NF-kappaB and MAP kinase signaling pathways. These early innate responses initiated by S. pyogenes-infected respiratory epithelial cells may recruit immune cells to the airway and induce inflammation."

CD010502,0,10669348,0,Invasive group A streptococcal disease in the Netherlands: evidence for a protective role of anti-exotoxin A antibodies.,"As part of a nationwide surveillance in The Netherlands during 1994-1997, 53 patients with invasive group A streptococcal (GAS) infections were evaluated for medical history, symptoms, and outcome. Patients' isolates were tested for the production of pyrogenic exotoxins A (SPE-A) and B (SPE-B). Acute-phase sera from all patients and convalescent sera from 12 patients were investigated for the presence of antibodies against SPE-A and SPE-B. Twenty-three patients developed toxic shock-like syndrome and 16 died. Absence of antibodies against SPE-A and/or SPE-B was a risk factor for developing invasive streptococcal disease. Toxic shock and mortality were associated with a lack of anti-SPE-A antibodies (P<.025). Anti-SPE-A antibodies were found in convalescent sera from all patients infected by speA-positive isolates. Virtually all invasive speA-positive streptococci expressed SPE-A protein in vitro. Thus antibodies against SPE-A appeared vital for mediating the outcome of invasive GAS disease in this population."

CD010502,0,10678929,0,Role of group A streptococcal virulence factors in adherence to keratinocytes.,"To evaluate the role of putative group A streptococcal virulence factors in the initiation of skin infections, we compared the adherence of a wild-type M49-protein skin-associated strain to that of a series of 16 isogenic mutants created by insertional inactivation of virulence genes. None of the mutants, including the M-protein-deficient (emm mutant) strain, displayed reduced adherence to early-passage cultured human keratinocytes, but adherence of the mutant lacking hyaluronic acid capsule expression (has mutant) was increased 13-fold. In contrast, elimination of capsule expression in M2-, M3-, and M18-protein has mutants increased adherence only slightly (1.3- to 2.3-fold) compared to their respective wild-type strains. A mutant with inactivation of both emm and has displayed high-level adherence (34.9 +/- 4.1%) equal to that of the has mutant strain (40.7 + 8.0%), confirming the lack of involvement of M49 protein in attachment. Moreover, adherence of the M49-protein-deficient (emm mutant) and wild-type strains was increased to the same level (57 and 55%, respectively) following enzymatic digestion of their hyaluronic acid capsule. Adherence of mutants lacking oligopeptide permease (Opp) expression was increased 3.8- to 5.5-fold, in association with decreased cell-associated hyaluronic acid capsule. Finally, soluble CD46 failed to inhibit adherence of M49- and M52-serotype skin strains. We conclude that (i) bacterial M protein and keratinocyte CD46 do not mediate adherence of M49 skin-associated Streptococcus pyogenes to epidermal keratinocytes, (ii) hyaluronic acid capsule impedes the interaction of bacterial adhesins with keratinocyte receptors, (iii) modulation of capsule expression may be important in the pathogenesis of skin infections, and (iv) the molecular interactions in attachment of skin strains of S. pyogenes to keratinocytes are unique and remain unidentified."
CD010502,0,19794915,0,Functional dissection of Streptococcus pyogenes M5 protein: the hypervariable region is essential for virulence.,"The surface-localized M protein of Streptococcus pyogenes is a major virulence factor that inhibits phagocytosis, as determined ex vivo. Because little is known about the role of M protein in vivo we analyzed the contribution of different M protein regions to virulence, using the fibrinogen (Fg)-binding M5 protein and a mouse model of acute invasive infection. This model was suitable, because M5 is required for mouse virulence and binds mouse and human Fg equally well, as shown here. Mixed infection experiments with wild type bacteria demonstrated that mutants lacking the N-terminal hypervariable region (HVR) or the Fg-binding B-repeat region were strongly attenuated, while a mutant lacking the conserved C-repeats was only slightly attenuated. Because the HVR of M5 is not required for phagocytosis resistance, our data imply that this HVR plays a major but unknown role during acute infection. The B-repeat region is required for phagocytosis resistance and specifically binds Fg, suggesting that it promotes virulence by binding Fg. However, B-repeat mutants were attenuated even in Fg-deficient mice, implying that the B-repeats may have a second function, in addition to Fg-binding. These data demonstrate that two distinct M5 regions, including the HVR, are essential to virulence during the early stages of an infection. In particular, our data provide the first in vivo evidence that the HVR of an M protein plays a major role in virulence, focusing interest on the molecular role of this region."

An immune-complex pathogenesis is accepted, but the causative antigen(s) is still controversial. In recent years, 2 streptococcal antigens, the cationic cysteine proteinase exotoxin B (SPE B) and the plasmin receptor, a glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (Plr, GAPDH) have attracted attention because: (1) they were localized in glomeruli in patients with acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (APSGN); and (2) serum antibody to these antigens was associated with nephritogenic streptococcal infections.

Conducted in 2006, this study aimed at characterizing clinical manifestations and microbial features of isolates obtained from invasive Streptococcus pyogenes disease. Clinical and demographic data were collected prospectively. Isolates were biotyped, T typed, emm sequenced, and tested for antibiotic susceptibility. Detection of the speA, speB, speC, and ssa genes was also carried out. The estimated annual incidence of invasive S. pyogenes disease in 2006 was high at 38 cases/100,000 inhabitants in New Caledonia. Invasive isolates were obtained from 90 patients with necrotizing fasciitis (41 cases), bacteremia with no identified focus (12 cases), myositis (10 cases), septic arthritis (9 cases), erysipelas (8 cases), postpartum infection (4 cases), myelitis and osteomyelitis (3 cases), severe pneumonia (2 cases), and endocarditis (1 case). The most frequent associated comorbidities were skin lesions (71%) and obesity (29%). Thirty-one different emm types were identified, and the following six accounted for 54% of the isolates: emm15 (15.5%), emm92 (12.2%), emm106 (8.9%), emm74 (6.7%), emm89 (5.6%), and emm109 (5.6%). The speA, speC, and ssa genes were expressed at different frequencies in the various emm types. The first epidemiological study of invasive S. pyogenes disease in New Caledonia highlights that emm type distribution is particular and should be taken into account in the development of an appropriate vaccine. These findings support the prevention of pyoderma and other cutaneous lesions in order to limit the development of both invasive disease and poststreptococcal sequelae in the South Pacific."

The optimal concentration of enzyme-treated whole bacterial cells to coat wells was 2 x 10(8) cells/ml and for purified ACHO antigen the optimal concentration was 1 microgram/ml. Sera from patients with acute rheumatic fever and acute glomerulonephritis were screened for the presence of C-carbohydrate antibodies. Patients with acute post-streptococcal complications showed significantly higher titres of antibody when compared with normal healthy individuals. ELISA results were also compared with purified ACHO as an antigen; this showed a highly significant correlation (r = 0.73).

In order to determine their immune response to S. pyogenes T4, S. pyogenes T12, S mitis, S. salivarius, S. sanguis I, S. sanguis II and S. pneumoniae, tonsillar lymphocytes from patients with PPP, CT, and sleep apnea syndrome (control) were cultured with formalinized streptococcal cellular antigens. Blastoid transformation was investigated by [3H] -thymidine uptake, while antistreptococcal antibody production were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The results were as follows. 1. Tonsillar lymphocytes from PPP patients underwent blastoid transformation and accelerated the production of immunoglobulin G following the addition of S. sanguis I, S. sanguis II S. mitis, S. pyogenes T4, and S. pyogenes T12, while those form CT patients and controls did so only with S. pyogenes T4 and S. pyogenes T12. 2. The spontaneous production of specific IgG against various streptococci, including S. sanguis I, S. sanguis II and S. mitis by tonsillar lymphocytes from patients with PPP was already higher than that from CT patients and controls. The specific IgM production was also increased above that in PPP patients without any antigens. 3. S. sanguis I, S. sanguis II and S. salivarius antigens stimulated antigen-specific IgM production in tonsillar lymphocytes from PPP patients. 4. The levels of specific IgG production against S. sanguis I and S. sanguis II by tonsillar lymphocytes from PPP patients showed a relationship with the serum levels of the PPP patients. These results suggested that the sensitization of alpha-streptococci, especially S. sanguis, in the tonsillar lacunae may lead to the specific production of anti-S. sanguis antibodies in patients with PPP, and these may be involved in the pathogenesis of PPP."
CD010502,0,9745311,0,Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal infections.,"GABHS is the most common bacterial cause of tonsillopharyngitis, but this organism also produces acute otitis media; pneumonia; skin and soft-tissue infections; cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, and lymphatic infections; bacteremia; and meningitis. Most children and adolescents who develop a sore throat do not have GABHS as the cause; their infection is viral in etiology. Other bacterial pathogens produce sore throat infrequently (e.g., Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae), and when they do, other concomitant clinical illness is present. Classic streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis has an acute onset; produces concurrent headache, stomach ache, and dysphagia; and upon examination is characterized by intense tonsillopharyngeal erythema, yellow exudate, and tender/enlarged anterior cervical glands. Unfortunately only about 20% to 30% of patients present with classic disease. Physicians overdiagnose streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis by a wide margin, which almost always leads to unnecessary treatment with antibiotics. Accordingly, use of throat cultures and/or rapid GABHS detection tests in the office is strongly advocated. Their use has been shown to be cost-effective and to reduce antibiotic overprescribing substantially. Penicillin currently is recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics and American Heart Association as first-line therapy for GABHS infections; erythromycin is recommended for those allergic to penicillin. Virtually all patients improve clinically with penicillin and other antibiotics. However, penicillin treatment failures do occur, especially in tonsillopharyngitis in which 5% to 35% of patients do not experience bacteriologic eradication. Penicillin treatment failures are more common among patients who have been treated recently with the drug. Cephalosporins or azithromycin are preferred following penicillin treatment failures in selected patients as first-line therapy, based on a history of penicillin failures or lack of compliance and for impetigo. GABHS remain exquisitely sensitive to penicillin in vitro. There are several explanations for penicillin treatment failures, but the possibility of copathogen co-colonization in vivo has received the most attention. Treatment duration with penicillin should be 10 days to optimize cure in GABHS infections. A 5-day regimen is possible and approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for cefpodoxime (a cephalosporin) and azithromycin (a macrolide). Prevention of rheumatic fever is the primary objective for antibiotic therapy of GABHS infections, but a reduction in contagion and faster clinical improvement also can be achieved. Development of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome and necrotizing fasciitis (""flesh-eating bacteria"") are rising concerns. The portal of entry for these invasive GABHS strains is far more often skin and soft tissue than the tonsillopharynx."

Recent success with the prophylactic use of intravenous gamma globulin (IVIg) in newborns suggests that use of IVIg may be an additional therapy for infants with severe GBS disease. Eighty-four infants with GBS antigen in serum, urine, and in some cases spinal fluid were identified by a rapid latex agglutination assay. Twenty-four of these infants had both neutropenia and serum GBS antigen titers of 1:10 or greater and had the highest risk of dying from their infection. Before the availability of IVIg, seven of the first 12 of these infants identified with the highest risk factors died (58%). Twelve additional patients with these highest risk factors have been treated with IVIg. Two of these 12 died (17%), p less than 0.01 when compared with the previous highest risk group. In surviving patients in both IVIg-treated and non-IVIg-treated groups, the time for recovery from neutropenia was 2 to 4 days. Our study suggests a possible beneficial effect of IVIg as adjunct therapy in severe GBS disease."

Direct fluorescent-antibody testing of a 2-h enrichment broth (FA/EN) was an accepted method for same-day results before the advent of rapid antigen tests. We compared FA/EN in Todd-Hewitt Broth (THB) with conventional culture and a rapid antigen test, TestPack Strep A (TPS). Nine hundred seventy specimens were evaluated in this study. Cultures were performed for 48 h on sheep blood agar (SBA) incubated aerobically and on a selective agar for group A streptococci (SSA) incubated in 5 to 10% CO2. Following a 2-h incubation, the fluorescent-antibody test was performed. A subculture of the centrifuged sediment from the THB enrichment was also done. In comparison with a positive culture on SBA or SSA or subculture of the THB pellet, the sensitivities and specificities of the different methods were as follows: SBA, 92 and 100%; SSA, 92 and 100%; TPS, 68 and 99%; FA/EN, 88 and 98%. The FA/EN method offers the potential for definitive finalized reports on the same day as specimen collection with greater sensitivity than TPS. This study included sequential plating and rapid antigen testing of a single swab. In a separate set of experiments to validate this study design, it was shown that recovery of streptococci from swabs plated sequentially on five plates did not vary with the order of plating and the actual proportion of organisms recovered from a swab on a single plate was only 1%."

Therefore, laboratory diagnosis of this virus and development of diagnostic serological techniques for HSV-1 is of particular importance. In the present study, pTrc His2A-gG1 plasmid, containing the full-length glycoprotein G (gG) protein, was produced in a prokaryotic system for the first time. Upon confirmation of a 37-kDa gG-1 protein production in a prokaryotic system based on western blotting and monoclonal antibodies, the protein was produced at a large scale and purified by ion-exchange chromatography using DEAE-sepharose.

CD010502,0,2012103,0,The role of infections in the rheumatic diseases: molecular mimicry between bacterial and human stress proteins?,"Infections can cause or exacerbate the rheumatic diseases in several ways, including immune cross-reactivity between bacterial heat shock proteins and similar proteins in normal human tissues. This may lead to autoimmunity in rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus. In addition, increased activation of the gene regulating the synthesis of a heat shock protein has been found in scleroderma fibroblasts. As an infection-induced model for other rheumatic diseases, rheumatic fever (RF), with its well-established link to prior group A streptococcal infection, will be revisited. The lessons learned from RF and other rheumatic diseases directly linked to infection will be applied to ankylosing spondylitis, rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogren's syndrome and polymyositis, for which a mounting body of circumstantial evidence suggests a probable infectious cause. The interplay of genetic susceptibility and infection with particular organisms and the implications of this new information for present and future therapy of the rheumatic diseases will also be presented."

Middle ear fluid IL-1 concentrations were determined using ELISA kits. Ninety-eight middle ear fluid samples were obtained by tympanocentesis at enrollment (day 1) and 43 samples were collected on days 4-5. Ninety-two pathogens were isolated in 77/98 samples obtained on day 1: 55 Haemophilus influenzae, 34 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 2 Moraxella catarrhalis and 1 Streptococcus pyogenes. Among 37 paired samples initially culture-positive, eradication of the pathogen was achieved on day 4-5 in 20 while pathogens were still present in 17. On day 1, IL-1 was detected in 61/77 (79%) culture-positive samples vs 9/21 (43%) culture-negative ones (P = 0.003). The mean +/- SD middle ear fluid concentration of IL-1 on day 1 was significantly higher in culture-positive (316 +/- 508 pg/ml) than in culture-negative samples (111 +/- 245 pg/ml) (P = 0.01). When paired samples were evaluated, IL-1 decreased on days 4-5 in 13/20 (65%) ears where bacterial eradication was achieved, but also in 11/19 (58%) with persistent or new infection. The mean IL-1 concentrations decreased on days 4-5 in the 20 samples from ears where bacterial eradication was achieved (330 +/- 460 vs 118 +/- 294 pg/ml, P = 0.1) but also in the 17 samples where it was not (465 +/- 660 vs 232 +/- 289 pg/ml, P = 0.02). No significant differences were found between day 1 and days 4-5 in the mean IL-1 concentrations measured in patients with H. influenzae vs S. pneumoniae or concomitant H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae. It was concluded that: 1) IL-1 was detected in the middle ear fluid of most patients with acute otitis media; 2) significantly higher IL-1 concentrations were found in patients with culture-positive than in those with culture-negative acute otits media; 3) IL-1 concentrations decreased on days 4-5 of antibiotic therapy, whether the pathogen was eradicated or not."

These results suggest that A549 cells are more susceptible to adenovirus infection and at least as susceptible to HSV infection compared with the other cell cultures evaluated. Detracting factors for the use of A549 cells were a slight loss of sensitivity to adenovirus at passage 120 and a concurrent change in the morphology of the cells. The A549 cell line proved to be an efficient, practical, and economical alternative cell system for the isolation of adenovirus and HSV in particular. Initial indications are that other clinically significant viruses may be grown in A549 cells; however, additional studies need to be performed."

CD010502,0,2358781,0,Superantigenicity of streptococcal M protein.,"M proteins that define the serotypes of group A streptococci are powerful blastogens for human T lymphocytes. The mechanism by which they activate T cells was investigated and compared with the conventional T cell mitogen phytohemagglutinin, and the known superantigen staphylococcal enterotoxin B. Although major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules are required for presentation, there is no MHC restriction, since allogeneic class II molecules presented the bacterial protein to human T cells. Type 5 M protein appears to bind class II molecules on the antigen-presenting cells and stimulate T cells bearing V beta 8 sequences. Our results indicate that this streptococcal M protein is a superantigen and suggest a possible mechanism of its role in the pathogenesis of the postinfectious autoimmune sequelae."

Among the 25 GAS and 26 GCS/GGS emm subtypes identified, only emm3.1 was significantly associated with invasive disease. M protein size variation within GAS and GCS/GGS emm types was frequently identified. Two non-invasive and one invasive GGS possessed emm genes that translated to truncated M proteins as a result of frameshift mutations. Results suggestive of recombinations between emm or emm-like gene segments were found in isolates of emm4 and stG485 types. One non-invasive GGS possessed speC, speG, speH, speI and smeZ, and another non-invasive GGS harboured SlaA. speA and SlaA were over-represented among invasive GAS, probably because they were associated with emm3. speG(dys) was identified in 83% of invasive and 63% of non-invasive GCS/GGS and correlated with certain emm subtypes. Our results indicate the invasive potential of isolates belonging to emm3, and show substantial emm gene diversity and possible lateral gene transfers in our streptococcal population."
CD010502,0,10816375,0,Analysis of plasminogen-binding M proteins of Streptococcus pyogenes.,"Group A streptococci are common human pathogens that cause a variety of infections. They express M proteins which are important cell wall-bound type-specific virulence factors. We have found that a set of strains, associated primarily with skin infections, express M proteins that bind plasminogen and plasmin with high affinity. The binding is mediated by a 13-amino-acid internal repeated sequence located in the N-terminal surface-exposed portion of these M proteins. This sequence binds to kringle 2 in plasminogen, a domain that is not involved in the interaction with streptokinase, a potent group A streptococcal activator of plasminogen. It could be demonstrated that plasminogen, absorbed from plasma by growing group A streptococci expressing the plasminogen-binding M proteins, could be activated by exogenous and endogenous streptokinase, thereby providing the bacteria with a surface-associated enzyme that could act on the tissue barriers in the infected host."
CD010502,0,14513891,0,Clinical experience of acute ferric chloride poisoning.,"Ferric chloride is both a corrosive acid and iron compound; reports of poisoning in humans are rare. A retrospective study was conducted to evaluate patients with ferric chloride exposure reported to Poison Control Center-Taipei Veterans General Hospital during 1990-2001. After exclusion of incomplete records, 16 patients with ferric chloride exposure were analyzed (9 male, 7 female aged 12 to 70 y). The exposures were occupational inhalation (18.7%), suicidal ingestion (56.3%), and accidental ingestion (25.0%). Major symptoms and signs were nausea/vomiting (68.8%), sore throat (68.8%), abdominal pain (37.5%), oral ulcers (37.5%), metabolic acidosis (25.0%), aspiration pneumonia (18.8%), respiratory failure (12.5%), diarrhea (12.5%), and hypotension (12.5%). The severity of poisonings were fatal 6.3%, severe 18.8%, moderate 31.2%, mild 37.5%, and asymptomatic 6.3%. Deferoxamine therapy was given in 9 hospitalized patients with good recovery; however the fatal case did not receive deferoxamine due to rapid deterioration and a late diagnosis. The serum iron level known in 7 cases ranged from 40 to 2440 microg/dL. Ingestion of ferric chloride may result in serious morbidity and mortality. Inappropriate labeling and storage lead to accidental swallowing or misdiagnosis. Early diagnosis is important, especially in seriously poisoned patients."
CD010502,0,10760814,0,Assessment of the interaction of human complement regulatory proteins with group A Streptococcus. Identification of a high-affinity group A Streptococcus binding site in FHL-1.,"Group A Streptococcus (GAS), the most frequent bacterial cause of suppurative infections in humans, expresses on the cell surface M proteins with capacity to bind factor H, FHL-1 and C4b binding protein (C4BP). This has been interpreted as a mechanism developed by this pathogen to decrease phagocytosis by macrophages and polymorphonuclear cells. We report the analysis of the capacity to bind factor H, FHL-1 and C4BP of 69 clinical isolates from 19 different serotypes. We show that strains binding complement regulators (30/69) belong to specific M serotypes. Of these, M18 strains are relatively frequent and interact with all three complement regulators simultaneously. However, the most virulent M1 and M3 strains did not bind complement regulators in our assays. The relevance of the interaction between complement regulators and S. pyogenes was analyzed using different approaches with the conclusion that under physiological conditions only FHL-1 and C4BP bind to streptococci. We show that FHL-1 presents a higher binding affinity for S. pyogenes than factor H because it carries a hydrophobic, high-affinity, GAS binding site in addition to the heparin binding site in SCR7. Using synthetic peptides we provide evidence that the high-affinity GAS binding site in FHL-1 involves the hydrophobic tail (Ser-Phe-Thr-Leu) that distinguishes FHL-1 from factor H."

CD010502,0,18080417,0,Secretory immunity following mutans streptococcal infection or immunization.,"Salivary IgA antibody responses to mutans streptococci can be observed in early childhood, sometimes even before permanent colonization of the oral biofilm occurs. Many of these early immune responses are directed to components thought to be essential for establishment and emergence of mutans streptococci in the oral biofilm. Initial responses are likely to be modulated by antigen dose, by immunological maturity, and by previous encounters with similar antigenic epitopes in the pioneer commensal flora. Our understanding of these modulating factors is modest and is an opportunity for continued investigation. Under controlled conditions of infection, experimental vaccine approaches have repeatedly shown that infection and disease can be modified in the presence of elevated levels of antibody in the oral cavity. Protection can be observed regardless of antibody isotype or method used to actively or passively provide the immune reagent. Limited clinical trials have supported the utility of both of these approaches in humans. Refinements in antigen formulation, delivery vehicles, enhancing agents and routes of application, coupled with approaches that are timed to intercept most vulnerable periods of infection of primary and permanent dentition may well provide the healthcare practitioner with an additional tool to maintain oral health."

CD010502,0,6436293,0,Comparison of latex agglutination and immunofluorescence for direct Lancefield grouping of streptococci from blood cultures.,"Simulated positive blood cultures with 84 known stock strains of streptococci were used to comparatively evaluate the direct identification of these organisms by fluorescein-tagged antibody staining (immunofluorescence [IF]) and latex agglutination (LA). IF was not evaluated for Lancefield group D strains (a total of 81 strains tested) and had 89% sensitivity and 91% specificity. IF was least sensitive for the identification of Lancefield group F, in which three of seven strains showed no fluorescence with the group F reagent. Since LA was more convenient and revealed comparable sensitivities and specificities on 84 simulated cultures, we tested this procedure using an additional 29 fresh positive clinical blood cultures, for a total of 113 cultures tested by this technique. Of 11 Streptococcus pneumoniae strains, 9 reacted with the LA group C reagent, a problem not observed with IF. However, all these strains were identified by a rapid modified bile solubility test. Of the 12 Streptococcus faecalis strains, 4 were falsely negative with the group D reagent, but all were correctly identified by a rapid litmus milk reduction test. Of 12 group A strains, 1 was not detected. Of all 113 strains tested by LA, eliminating S. faecalis and S. pneumoniae, the sensitivity and specificity were 97 and 98%, respectively. LA was simple and reliable in the rapid identification of streptococci from blood cultures and appeared to be preferable to IF. When LA is used, the group D reagent should not be used, and all samples reacting with the group C reagent should be tested by a modified rapid bile solubility test to exclude S. pneumoniae."

CD010502,0,6436292,0,Evaluation of rapid identification of gram-positive cocci in positive blood cultures by use of the AutoMicrobic system Gram-Positive Identification Card.,"Because rapid identification of gram-positive organisms from blood cultures may provide valuable information for patient care and because the AutoMicrobic system Gram-Positive Identification (AMS-GPI) Card (Vitek Systems, Inc., Hazelwood, Mo.) is designed for the identification of these organisms in 4 to 13 h, we designed this study to evaluate the performance of the AMS-GPI Card in the direct identification of gram-positive organisms upon detection of growth in blood culture bottles. We compared direct identification by the AMS-GPI Card with the final AMS-GPI Card identification and with our standard identification methods. We evaluated 51 gram-positive organisms from clinical blood cultures as well as 49 simulated blood cultures. The isolates included Streptococcus pneumoniae (17), Streptococcus pyogenes (13), group D enterococci (12), Streptococcus agalactiae (11), viridans streptococci (10), coagulase-negative staphylococci (21), Staphylococcus aureus (15), and Listeria monocytogenes (1). The AMS-GPI Card identified all of the group D enterococci, viridans streptococci, and coagulase-negative staphylococci and all but one each of the Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae isolates. L. monocytogenes was also correctly identified. However, the AMS-GPI Card identified only 12 of 17 Streptococcus pneumoniae and 9 of 15 Staphylococcus aureus isolates by direct inoculation. We therefore conclude that the results of direct identification of gram-positive organisms by the AMS-GPI Card may be used cautiously for rapid direct identification of gram-positive organisms from positive blood cultures."

After 6 h of culture, SPEA production by S. pyogenes was higher in broths containing ampicillin (715.7 +/- 296.4 pg/10(6) cfu) than in broths containing clindamycin (167.1 +/- 31.9 pg/10(6) cfu), a difference that was not significant (P = 0.25). Promitogenic activity of bacterial supernatants was also greater in ampicillin-treated cultures (467.5 +/- 17.2 ccpm/10(6) cfu) than in clindamycin-treated cultures (169.2 +/- 8.9 ccpm/10(6) cfu), a difference that was highly significant (P = 0.0001).

Western blot analysis of the purified proteins with sera from individuals with streptococcal diseases demonstrated that 29 out of 36 sera tested were reactive with GroEL and eight recognized DnaK. Rabbit antiserum against myosin recognized both GroEL and DnaK. Antibodies raised against purified F2GroEL and DnaK reacted with myosin in the ELISA but not in a Western immunoblot. These data indicate that the S. pyogenes GroEL and DnaK may be important immunogens during streptococcal infections. Furthermore, we provide evidence of an immunogenic relatedness of the GroEL and DnaK proteins with myosin that could play a role in the pathogenesis of streptococcal non-suppurative sequelae."
CD010502,0,3530567,0,Incidence of circulating immune complexes in patients with acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis and in patients with streptococcal impetigo.,"In an attempt to further study the possible contribution of circulating immune complexes (CIC) in the pathogenesis of acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis, 61 patients with APSGN were studied during the first three weeks of the disease, and 13 patients with noncomplicated streptococcal impetigo as a control group. C1q solid phase ELISA and Conglutinin (K) solid phase ELISA were used to measure the levels of immune complexes. The incidence of CIC in a single serum sample from patients with APSGN was 48%. Elevated levels of immune complexes were found in 46% of the patients with streptococcal impetigo. The absolute levels of CIC were comparable in both groups of patients. No correlation was found among the presence of CIC and the clinical, immunoserological or pathological findings of the disease. Our results do not support the hypothesis that trapping of the circulating immune complexes play an important role on the renal injury poststreptococcal infection. Instead, we suggest that CIC are an epiphenomena present in APSGN, and may represent rather a systemic inflammatory immune response in patients with group A streptococcal infection."
CD010502,0,6403501,0,Hydrophobic interactions of group A streptococci with hexadecane droplets.,"The adherence of Streptococcus pyogenes cells to hexadecane droplets was measured by vortexing water suspensions of streptococci with hexadecane. It was found that adherence of the organisms to hexadecane droplets was abolished by pretreating the organisms with trypsin, pepsin at pH 4.5, or HCl solutions at 95 degrees C. Streptococcal adherence was best expressed in organisms harvested during the stationary phase of growth and was inhibited by fatty acid-free albumin because of the interaction of the protein with the streptococcal surfaces. The data suggest that adherence to hexadecane droplets measures the availability on the surface of S. pyogenes cells of lipophilic residues that are either hydrophobic regions of surface protein structures or, more likely, glycolipids complexed with and oriented by surface proteins."

A total of 11 antigens were identified but the density of immunoprecipitates was varied and only seven could be reliably detected, one of which dominated the immunoprecipitate pattern by its intensity. The antigens were partially characterized by immunological, chemical and cell-location methods. Five of the antigens contained carbohydrate and two of those were sensitive to trypsin and probably represent cell-wall compounds. Of the three most prominent antigens, one was surface located and represented the type and shared type antigens (Iabc), one was a cell-wall carbohydrate and very sensitive to periodate, and one was a protein/carbohydrate complex which was heat-labile and trypsin sensitive. Group B epitopes were detected in three immunoprecipitates. Cross-reactions between type Ia and other serotypes and streptococci were recorded."

Altogether, significant increases in TNF alpha, IL-8 and IL-6 levels were observed in the acute phase as compared to the data found during and after treatment. No significant differences were observed for the other cytokines. Elevations of one or more of the inflammatory cytokines were observed in 9 of 12 patients with RFA, and 12 of 15 with RHD. Increase of TNF alpha (6/9) and IL-8 (5/9) levels were higher in RHD patients with cardiac failure.

CD010502,0,17662041,0,Severe streptococcal infection is associated with M protein-induced platelet activation and thrombus formation.,"Disturbed haemostasis is a central finding in severe Streptococcus pyogenes infection. In particular, microthrombi are found both at the local site of infection and at distant sites. Platelets are responsible for maintaining vascular function and haemostasis. We report here that M1 protein of S. pyogenes triggers immune-mediated platelet activation and thrombus formation. M1 protein is released from the bacterial surface and forms complexes with plasma fibrinogen. These complexes bind to the fibrinogen receptor on resting platelets. When these complexes also contain immunoglobulin G (IgG) against M1 protein, this will engage the Fc receptor on the platelets and activation will occur. Activation of the platelets leads to platelet aggregation and the generation of platelet-rich thrombi. Neutrophils and monocytes are in turn activated by the platelets. Platelet thrombi are deposited in the microvasculature, and aggregated platelets, IgG and M1 protein colocalize in biopsies from patients diagnosed with S. pyogenes toxic shock syndrome. This chain of events results in a pro-coagulant and pro-inflammatory state typical of severe S. pyogenes infection."

There is evidence that vertical transmission, the major route of neonatal acquisition, may be interrupted by administration of antibiotics during the intrapartum period. A modified starch serum medium has been developed that will allow the rapid identification of group B streptococci, by observation of a color change, in vaginal and rectal swabs. This medium was compared to a ""gold standard"" of routine culture. The sensitivity and specificity of the test were found to be 100% and 99%, respectively, in 237 specimens from women attending different clinics who submitted vaginal swabs. All color changes occurred within 6 hours. Vaginal and rectal carriage of the organism were found in 8% and 12%, respectively, of women in preterm labor. In this population the sensitivity and specificity of the test for vaginal specimens were 97% and 98%, respectively. The corresponding values for rectal swabs were 94% and 100%. The test can potentially select carrier mothers who could benefit the most from intrapartum antibiotics. This medium may also be used for transport to enhance detection of colonization."
CD010502,0,8010973,0,M1 protein and protein H: IgGFc- and albumin-binding streptococcal surface proteins encoded by adjacent genes.,"M1 protein and Protein H are surface proteins simultaneously present at the surface of certain strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, important pathogenic bacteria in humans. The present study concerns the structure, protein-binding properties and relationship between these two molecules. The gene encoding M1 protein (emm1) was found immediately upstream of the Protein H gene (sph). Both genes were preceded by a promoter region. Comparison of the sequences revealed a high degree of similarity in the signal peptides, the C repeats located in the central parts of the molecules and in the C-terminal cell-wall-attached regions, whereas the N-terminal sequences showed no significant similarity. Protein H has affinity for the Fc region of IgG antibodies. Also M1 protein, isolated from streptococcal culture supernatants or from Escherichia coli expressing emm1, was found to bind human IgGFc. When tested against polyclonal IgG from eight other mammalian species, M1 protein and Protein H both showed affinity for baboon, rabbit and pig IgG. M1 protein also reacted with guinea-pig IgG, whereas both streptococcal proteins were negative in binding experiments with rat, mouse, bovine and horse IgG. The two proteins were also tested against other members of the immunoglobulin super family: human IgM, IgA, IgD, IgE, beta 2-microglobulin, and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class-I and class-II antigens. M1 protein showed no affinity for any of these molecules whereas Protein H reacted with MHC class-II antigens. M1 protein is known to bind albumin and fibrinogen also. The binding sites for these two plasma proteins and for IgGFc were mapped to different sites on M1 protein. Thus albumin bound to the C repeats and IgGFc to a region (S) immediately N-terminal of the C repeats. Finally, fibrinogen bound further towards the N-terminus but close to the IgGFc-binding site. On the fibrinogen molecule, fragment D was found to mediate binding to M1 protein. The IgGFc-binding region of M1 protein showed no similarity to that of Protein H. Still, competitive binding experiments demonstrated that the two streptococcal proteins bound to overlapping sites on IgGFc."

Palivizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against the respiratory syncytial virus fusion protein, is currently the only licensed product in Europe available for prophylaxis of respiratory syncytial virus lower respiratory tract infection. This study was conducted to obtain additional European data on the safety of palivizumab in preterm infants 29-32 weeks' gestational age without chronic lung disease. Subjects less than 6 months old were enrolled between October 2000 and April 2001. Demographic information was obtained and physical examination was performed at enrollment. Subjects received 15 mg/kg palivizumab intramuscularly every 30 days for the duration of the respiratory syncytial virus season. Subjects hospitalized for respiratory illness were tested for respiratory syncytial virus infection with respiratory syncytial virus rapid antigen tests. At monthly visits, interim history for adverse events/respiratory illness and physical exam was performed. A total of 285 subjects were enrolled from 35 centers in 18 countries. The mean (+/-SD) gestational age was 30.8+/-1.1 weeks, the mean birth weight 1.5+/-0.4 kg, and 56% were <12 weeks of age at enrollment. Over 80% of patients received at least four palivizumab doses; all received at least one dose. The most commonly reported adverse events (>5%) were rhinitis, increased cough, fever, pharyngitis, bronchiolitis, and diarrhea. Only six subjects reported adverse events that were considered possibly related to palivizumab. No deaths were reported. Twenty subjects were hospitalized during the study; six of these were respiratory syncytial virus positive.

The overall rate of agreement between the two systems for species level identification was 95.8% and 96.3% for Gram-negative bacilli and Gram-positive cocci, respectively. Enterococcus and Streptococcus species both achieved a 100% rate of species level agreement. The genus level agreement was >99% overall. Arbitration of the 8 Gram-negative bacilli disagreements resolved with 7 in agreement with the Phoenix identification. For the 5 Gram-positive cocci disagreements, 3 resolved in agreement with Phoenix. Overall, 3688 antimicrobial/organism combinations were evaluated in both systems. For Gram-negative isolates, the rate of essential agreement for the MICs was 98.5%, while the categorical agreement rate was 95.9%. Arbitration of 13 Gram-negative disagreements resolved with 11 in agreement with the Phoenix system. For Staphylococcus spp. and Enterococcus spp. isolates, the essential agreement rates were 96.4% and 99% respectively. Categorical agreement rates for both genera were 94.7% and 96.1%, respectively.

Significant differences were found between hospital and pediatric practices in the percentage of patients with a negative rapid antigen detection test who actually had group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (3.5% to 9.8%). This study supports the recommendation of culture confirmation of a negative rapid antigen detection test and validation of results within an individual practice if confirmatory cultures are not being performed. This study showed a high false-negative rate of the negative rapid antigen detection test and variation among hospital and pediatric practices for rates of positive culture after a negative rapid antigen detection test."
CD010502,0,3324041,0,Impact of rapid antigen tests for group A streptococcal pharyngitis on physician use of antibiotics and throat cultures.,"Using case scenarios and an interview guided by a decision tree diagram, the clinical strategies of 150 physicians (50 private pediatricians, 50 health maintenance organization pediatricians and 50 pediatric residents) were assessed for the management of pharyngitis under three conditions: (1) no rapid antigen detection test available for diagnosing Group A streptococcal disease; (2) antigen test result available in 20 minutes; and (3) antigen test result available in 4 hours. The sensitivity of the antigen test was designated as 0.95 if the growth of rare or few Group A streptococci on throat culture was discounted and 0.82 if any growth was considered significant, and the specificity was set at 0.98. In a standardized pediatric case with a prior probability of Group A streptococcal disease of 0.58, 84% of clinicians would order a 20-minute test and 39% would order a 4-hour test. The 20-minute test would reduce throat culture use by 54%, reduce the proportion of patients exposed to antibiotics from 86% to 65% and reduce total antibiotic treatment days by 13.8%. Effects would be less pronounced for a low probability case or if results of antigen testing were not available for 4 hours. Provided a test with a documented high sensitivity and specificity were used, a rapid antigen test with results promptly available would substantially reduce throat culture use and unnecessary antibiotic exposures in children with a moderate prior probability of streptococcal disease."
CD010502,0,7783451,0,Variation of multifunctional surface binding proteins--a virulence strategy for group A streptococci?,"Variation in surface antigens has been well recognized as a mechanism by which pathogenic organisms can avoid elimination and remain as potential pathogens in immunocompetent individuals. A variety of viral and parasitic organisms elude the immune system by varying their surface antigenic structures. Other persistent human pathogens, for example group A streptococci, are associated with cyclic variation in the severity of infections without any major change in their surface antigenic structures. Recent analysis of group A streptococcal proteins, in particular surface M and M-like proteins, has documented the existence of an array of multifunctional surface proteins which have the ability to bind to a variety of normal human plasma proteins, extracellular matrix components and human cells. The ability to change the functional activities of these surface molecules by genetic recombination among members of a closely related M protein supergene family has now been reported. In this paper, the potential importance of generating functional heterogeneity in surface binding proteins of group A streptococcus is discussed. The role of these proteins in enabling an organism to sense its environment and express the appropriate virulence factors is proposed as an explanation for the periodic changes in the frequency and severity of invasive group A streptococcal infections that can occur in the absence of a toxic-shock-like syndrome."
CD010502,0,20513870,0,Invasive group A streptococcal infection: an update on the epidemiology and orthopaedic management.,"Invasive group A streptococcus (iGAS) is the most common cause of monomicrobial necrotising fasciitis. Necrotising infections of the extremities may present directly to orthopaedic surgeons or by reference from another admitting specialty. Recent epidemiological data from the Health Protection Agency suggest an increasing incidence of iGAS infection in England. Almost 40% of those affected had no predisposing illnesses or risk factors, and the proportion of children presenting with infections has risen. These observations have prompted the Chief Medical Officer for the Central Alerting System in England to write to general practitioners and hospitals, highlighting the need for clinical vigilance, early diagnosis and rapid initiation of treatment in suspected cases. The purpose of this annotation is to summarise the recent epidemiological trends, describe the presenting features and outline the current investigations and treatment of this rare but life-threatening condition."
CD010502,0,16549667,0,A unique serine-rich repeat protein (Srr-2) and novel surface antigen (epsilon) associated with a virulent lineage of serotype III Streptococcus agalactiae.,"Group B streptococci (GBS) are pathogens of both neonates and adults, with serotype III strains in particular being associated with invasive disease and meningitis. In this study, a novel GBS surface antigen, epsilon, was found to be co-expressed with the previously reported delta antigen on an identical subset of serotype III GBS. Expression of delta/epsilon on the surface of serotype III GBS was shown to distinguish the restriction digest pattern (RDP) III-3 and multilocus sequence typing (ST)-17 lineage. epsilon-Specific antibodies were reactive with a unique, high-molecular-mass, serine-rich repeat protein (Srr-2) found exclusively in RDP III-3 strains. The gene encoding Srr-2 was located within a putative accessory secretory locus that included secY2 and secA2 homologues and had a genetic organization similar to that of the secY2/A2 locus of staphylococci. In contrast, serotype III delta/epsilon-negative strains and strains representative of serotypes Ia, Ib, Ic and II shared a common Srr-encoding gene, srr-1, and an organization of the secY2/A2 locus similar to that of previously reported serotype Ic, delta/epsilon-negative serotype III and serotype V GBS strains. Representative serotype III delta/epsilon-positive strains had LD(90) values 3-4 logs less than those of serotype III delta/epsilon-negative strains in a neonatal mouse model of infection. These results indicate that the RDP III-3/ST-17 lineage expresses Srr-2 and is highly virulent in an in vivo model of neonatal sepsis."

CD010502,0,2912117,0,Rapid streptococcal antigen detection in experimental keratitis.,"We assessed the role of commercially available immunodiagnostic procedures in comparison to Gram stain and culture in experimental bacterial keratitis. Rabbit corneas were inoculated with Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, S. faecalis, or Haemophilus influenzae. Corneal scrapings were processed before and during antibacterial therapy using a coagglutination assay to detect pneumococcal capsular antigen (Phadebact Pneumococcus test) and an enzyme immunoassay to detect group A streptococcal cell-wall antigen (TestPack Strep A test). In untreated infected eyes, both immunoassays were highly specific and as sensitive as Gram stain for detection of the respective microorganisms. For S. pneumoniae keratitis, the sensitivity of coagglutination was 82% and Gram stain, 73%. For S. pyogenes keratitis, the sensitivity of enzyme immunoassay was 100% and Gram stain, 62%. Immunoassays and Gram stain were less sensitive than culture during antibacterial therapy. Successful clinical application of the coagglutination assay in a patient with pneumococcal keratitis permitted early use of specific cephalosporin treatment."

Chilean National Committee for Meningococcal Disease.","A meningococcal group B (15:P1.3) outer membrane protein vaccine was tested for efficacy in a randomized, double-blind controlled study in Iquique, Chile. A total of 40 811 volunteers, ages 1-21 years, enrolled in the study. Volunteers received two doses of vaccine six weeks apart by jet injector. Both the experimental vaccine and the control vaccine (Menomune, A, C, Y and W135 meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine) were well tolerated with minor side-effects. Active surveillance for suspected cases of meningococcal disease was conducted for 20 months in Iquique. Eighteen cases of group B meningococcal disease were confirmed during the 20 months. Efficacy was estimated to be 51% (p = 0.11) for all ages combined. In children aged 1-4 no protection was evident, but in volunteers aged 5-21 vaccine efficacy was 70% (p = 0.045). The IgG antibody response by ELISA was characterized by a large booster effect after the second dose, followed by a substantial drop in antibody levels by 6 months. The youngest children had the highest responses. The bactericidal antibody response, on the other hand, was characterized by the lack of a significant booster response, higher responses in the older children, and an increase in the geometric mean titer in the later months of the study in the older children."
CD010502,0,9331709,0,Molecular markers for throat and skin isolates of group A streptococci.,"In summary, the emm chromosomal patterns distinguish between the two principal tissue site reservoirs of group A streptococci--the nasopharyngeal mucosa and impetigo lesion. Strains derived from normally sterile tissue sites are probably transmitted to new hosts by respiratory droplets, at least in the Connecticut population. The speA gene provides an example of how genetic exchange between different strains of group A streptococci may be limited to a single tissue site or to a subset of emm chromosomal patterns."

CD010502,0,9331705,0,Proteins M6 and F1 are required for efficient invasion of group A streptococci into cultured epithelial cells.,"Group A streptococci were recently shown to be capable of invading human epithelial cell monolayers. Cell invasion might be an important virulence trait of streptococci that enable the pathogen to gain entry into deeper tissues after initial binding to host cells. Nothing is known concerning the nature of streptococcal components that mediate invasion. Using isogenic mutants of strain JRS4 that are defective in the expression of either M6 protein or protein F1, or both proteins, it was demonstrated that both adhesins are required for efficient invasion. Further more, expression of protein F1 on the surface of a non-invasive strain rendered the latter invasive, suggesting that protein F1 is directly involved in the invasion process."

CD010502,0,8945544,0,Roles of the bacterial cell wall and capsule in induction of tumor necrosis factor alpha by type III group B streptococci.,"Group B streptococci (GBS) are the major cause of sepsis and fatal shock in neonates in the United States. The precise role of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) in the development of human GBS sepsis has not been defined; however, whole GBS have been shown to induce the production of this inflammatory cytokine. We sought to determine which bacterial cell wall components of GBS are responsible for triggering TNF-alpha production. Human cord blood monocytes were stimulated with encapsulated (COH1) or unencapsulated (COH1-13) whole type III GBS or with purified bacterial components, including type III capsular polysaccharide (III-PS), group B polysaccharide (GB-PS), lipoteichoic acid (LTA), or peptidoglycan (PG). Lipopolysaccharide from Escherichia coli served as a control. Supernatants were harvested at specific timed intervals, and TNF-alpha levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Monocytes exposed to COH1 and COH1-13 induced similar amounts of TNF-alpha. III-PS, GB-PS, LTA, and PG each induced TNF-alpha in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. However, TNF-alpha release was significantly greater after stimulation by the GB-PS or PG than after stimulation by III-PS or LTA (P < 0.05). Our findings indicate that GB-PS and PG are the bacterial cell wall components primarily evoking TNF-alpha release. These, alone or in concert with other factors, may be responsible for septic shock accompanying GBS sepsis."
CD010502,0,9377028,0,[Immunoenzyme test system for detecting antibodies to group-specific antigens of group A Streptococcus on the base of conjugated N-acetylglucosamine and its use in medical practice].,"Enzyme immunoassay kit has been created for detecting antibodies to group A Streptococcus, based on N-acetylglucosamine. N-acetylglucosamine was selected as the group-specific determinant due to the structure of group A Streptococcus polysaccharide, in which this monosaccharide residue is lateral to the main polysaccharide chain and hence more available for antibodies. Water-soluble polyacrylamide is the carrier in this kit, for this carrier is stable and not liable to nonspecific reaction with proteins. In addition, the synthesis of polyacrylamide conjugates ensures reproducible results. Use of this kit permits the identification of group A streptococcal etiology of the disease and thus carry out appropriate therapy; moreover, it helps predict the outcome of an acute streptococcal infection and detect the poststreptococcal complications in the early period of the disease."
CD010502,0,2989764,0,Adenoviral diseases in children: a study of 105 hospital cases.,"The clinical findings for 105 children hospitalized with adenoviral infection were studied prospectively. In 82 children, the diagnosis was based on the detection of adenovirus antigen in the nasopharyngeal specimens and in 17 children in the feces. In the remaining six patients, findings from nasopharyngeal specimens were negative but a significant increase in CF (complement fixation) titers was detected. The clinical picture of adenoviral infection was characterized by high-grade (mean 39.4 degrees C) and prolonged fever (mean duration 5.4 days). Tonsillitis, otitis, and gastroenteritis were the most common illnesses. In 17% of the patients, no identifiable focus of infection could be demonstrated; nine children with no identifiable focus of infection had febrile convulsions. The WBC count and ESR varied from normal values to values seen in bacterial infections; thus it was difficult to distinguish adenoviral disease from a bacterial disease. Forty-five children were referred to the hospital due to infection unresponsive to antimicrobial therapy. The rapid detection of adenovirus antigen in nasopharyngeal specimens or feces proved to have a great clinical value in the diagnosis of adenoviral infections."

Both serotype M6 and serotype M1 mutants in 12 of the 13 identified sptR genes exhibited levels of emm transcripts and Mga protein comparable to those of the wild type during exponential and stationary phases of growth. Thus, temporal control of these virulence genes does not require Spt response regulators."

These included 282 throat isolates and 107 isolates from normally sterile sites. Of the other isolates, 38 were recovered from other miscellaneous infections. A total of 31 different emm types were found, revealing a broad overlap between commonly occurring emm types in Mexico and the United States. The information obtained in this study is consistent with the possibility that multivalent, M type-specific vaccines prepared for GAS strain distribution within the United States could theoretically protect against the majority of GAS strains causing disease in the two cities surveyed in Mexico."
CD010502,0,1550713,0,Streptococcal skin diseases in children.,"Infections with streptococcal bacteria continue to be a common problem in children. They can produce cutaneous manifestations via three main mechanisms: (1) direct infection of the skin; (2) toxin-mediated disease; and (3) immunologically mediated disease. This review updates a variety of streptococcal diseases involving the skin. The changing bacteriology of impetigo is addressed, as well as the resurgence of rheumatic fever. A new manifestation of invasive streptococcal infection, termed streptococcal toxic shocklike syndrome, is also presented. Many changes in the epidemiology of streptococcal infections during the 1980s can be traced to the reemergence of more virulent strains of the organism. The impact of this natural occurrence is discussed. Therapeutic recommendations are presented for each disease, and the value of rapid streptococcal tests is reviewed."
CD010502,0,10724481,0,Characterization of group A streptococcal strains Sv and Su: determination of emm gene typing and presence of small vir regulon.,"The emm gene typing of GAS (group A streptococcus) strains Sv and Su and the molecular structure of the vir regulon were decided. An emm(-like) gene from the chromosomal DNA of GAS strain Sv was amplified with forward and reverse primers, which were selected from the best conserved portion in leader sequences of different strains and the C-terminal conserved portion, respectively, for determination of the M protein gene type. Strain Sv was defined as serotype M23, because deduced N-terminal amino acid positions of the products are identical to those of the M type 23 (emml) gene derived from GAS strain M23-MEMPHIS (M serotype 23, GenBank accession number U11953). When the vir regulon of strain Sv was examined by polymerase chain reaction mapping and compared with that of GAS strain Su, they had a similar size in length. In addition, when sequencing analysis of the DNA fragment of 4791 base pairs (bp) encoding three open reading frames (orf, mga, and emm) and the upstream region of scpA from genomic DNAs of both strains was performed, the sequence of the DNA from strain Sv was, except for 1 bp (T for C at position 4124), identical to that of the DNA from strain Su. These data show that both strains possess the genes in the order of mga (virR or mry) -emm -scpA designated as the small vir regulon. The effect of the formation of alternative pathway C3 convertase of complement on the GAS strains Sv and Su was also examined. When GAS strains Sv and Su were incubated in NHS containing radiolabeled C3 in the presence of Mg-EGTA, binding of C3 to Su bacteria was dose-dependent, whereas less binding of C3 to Sv bacteria was seen. Taken together, the data suggest that M protein could be expressed on the surface of the Sv bacteria, but not on the Su bacteria."
CD010502,0,15906537,0,Acute guttate psoriasis patients have positive streptococcus hemolyticus throat cultures and elevated antistreptococcal M6 protein titers.,"To further study the role of Streptococci hemolyticus infection and streptococcal M6 protein in the pathogenesis of acute guttate psoriasis, streptococcal cultures were taken from the throats of 68 patients with acute guttate psoriasis. PCR technique was applied to detect M6 protein encoding DNA from those cultured streptococci. Pure M6 protein was obtained by Sephacry/S-200HR and Mono-Q chromatography from proliferated Streptococcus hemolyticus. Antistreptococcal M6 protein titers were measured in the serum of patients with acute guttate psoriasis, plaque psoriasis and healthy controls by ELISA. A high incidence of Streptococcus hemolyticus culture was observed in the guttate psoriatic group compared with the plaque psoriasis and control groups. Fourteen strains of Streptococcus hemolyticus were cultured from the throats of 68 acute guttate psoriasis patients. Of these, 5 strains contain DNA encoding the M6 protein gene as confirmed by PCR technique. More than 85% purification of M6 protein was obtained from Streptococcus pyogenes. Applying our pure M6 protein with the ELISA methods, we found that the titer of antistreptococcal M6 protein was significantly higher in the serum of guttate psoriasis patients than in the control or plaque psoriasis groups (P < 0.01). We verified that patients of acute guttate psoriasis have a high incidence of Streptococcus hemolyticus in their throats and raised titers of antistreptococcal M6 protein in their sera."

CD010502,0,8245833,0,"Conserved and variable regions in protein Arp, the IgA receptor of Streptococcus pyogenes.","The streptococcal M protein family, a number of cell surface molecules that interact with the human immune system, can be divided into two major classes, A and C, characterized by different types of repeats in the central part of the molecule. Class A and class C molecules are known to have a variable N-terminal region and a more conserved C-terminal region, but little is known about the mechanisms that give rise to this structural variation. In this report, we show that two variants of protein Arp, an IgA receptor in class C of the M protein family, have virtually identical signal sequences and C-terminal halves, but unrelated N-terminal sequences. Comparison of the sequences of the two genes and their flanking regions also demonstrates the presence of well-defined variable and conserved regions. Our results strongly suggest that the N-terminal sequence variation between the two variants of protein Arp was generated through an intergenic recombination event, rather than through intragenic recombination or accumulation of mutations."
CD010502,0,1370269,0,Nucleotide sequences of two adjacent M or M-like protein genes of group A streptococci: different RNA transcript levels and identification of a unique immunoglobulin A-binding protein.,"M protein is a key virulence factor present on the surface of group A streptococci. M protein is defined by its antiphagocytic function, whereas M-like proteins, while structurally related to M proteins, lack an established antiphagocytic function. Group A streptococci can be divided into two main groups (class I and II) on the basis of the presence or absence of certain antigenic epitopes within the M and M-like molecules, and importantly, the two classes correlate with the disease-causing potential of group A streptococci. In an effort to better understand this family of molecules, a 2.8-kb region containing the two M protein-like genes from a class II isolate (serotype 2) was cloned and sequenced. The two genes lie adjacent to one another on the chromosome, separated by 211 bp, and have many structural features in common. The emmL2.1-derived product (ML2.1 protein) is immunoreactive with type-specific antiserum, a property associated with M proteins. The cloned product of the downstream gene, emmL2.2 (ML2.2 protein), is an immunoglobulin A (IgA)-binding protein, binding human myeloma IgA. Interestingly, the RNA transcript levels of emmL2.1 exceed that of emmL2.2 by at least 32-fold. Northern (RNA) hybridization and primer extension studies suggest that the RNA transcripts of emmL2.1 and emmL2.2 are monocistronic. The ML2.1 and ML2.2 proteins exhibit 53% amino acid sequence identity and differ primarily in their amino termini and peptidoglycan-spanning domains and in a Glu-Gln-rich region present only in the ML2.1 protein. However, the previously described M-like, IgA-binding protein from a serotype 4 isolate (Arp4) displays a higher level of amino acid sequence homology with the ML2.1 molecule than with the IgA-binding ML2.2 protein. Amino acid sequence alignments between all M and M-like proteins characterized to date suggest the existence of two fundamental M or M-like gene subclasses within class II organisms, represented by emmL2.1 and emmL2.2. In addition, IgA-binding activity can be found within both types of molecules."
CD010502,0,7628193,1,Superiority of conventional culture technique over rapid detection of group A Streptococcus by optical immunoassay.,"An optical immunoassay (OIA) has been reported to be more sensitive than conventional culture for the detection of Group A Streptococcus, eliminating the need for culture. We attempted to confirm the sensitivity and specificity through a laboratory quantitation study and a clinical trial. OIA did not detect Group A Streptococcus below 10(5) colony forming units (CFU). Culture detected Streptococcus to 10(2) CFU from the inoculated swab. In the clinical study, throat swabs were obtained from 77 patients in an outpatient clinic. Compared with culture, the sensitivity of OIA was 78% and the specificity was 90%. These results demonstrate that OIA was less sensitive than culture in seeded experiments and missed 22% of positives in clinical practice. Our study, contrary to previous reports, suggests that OIA is not sensitive enough to be used as the sole assay for Group A Streptococcus pharyngitis."
CD010502,0,1563763,0,Separation of T-cell-stimulating activity from streptococcal M protein.,"The superantigenic properties of M protein type 5 of Streptococcus pyogenes have been implicated as an important pathogenicity factor in streptococcal autoimmune diseases. Here we show that after a single purification step by affinity chromatography on immobilized albumin or fibrinogen, M protein has no mitogenic activity for T cells. We demonstrate that the superantigenicity of M proteins of type 5 and type 1 is due to contamination with the highly potent pyrogenic exotoxins of S. pyogenes in the range of 0.1 to 0.01%. These results raise a general caveat for work with these extremely active T-cell mitogens, because the mitogenicity of other streptococcal or staphylococcal proteins could be due to similar minute contamination with potent superantigens that are undetectable by any biochemical method but extremely effective in stimulating sensitive T cells."

Liquoid alone at 10-30 micrograms/2 X 10(5) leukocytes also triggers intense CL responses in the absence of a carrier. Strong CL can also be triggered, and at the same levels, when the various polyelectrolytes are simply mixed with the bacteria or zymosan and added to the leukocyte suspensions. The CL responses induced by the polyelectrolyte-bacteria complexes greatly exceed those triggered in leukocytes by antibody-complement-coated particles. Liquoid also shows a unique property of markedly augmenting CL signals which have already been induced by other ligand-coated bacteria or zymosan particles. Streptococci and staphylococci were found to be much superior to zymosan, Gram-positive bacilli, or E. coli as carriers for the various polyelectrolytes in the CL reaction. Neither protamine sulfate, lysozyme, myeloperoxidase, crystalline ribonuclease (all cationic in nature), chondroitin sulfate, heparin, nor alginate sulfate acted as ligands for triggering CL, when used to opsonize bacteria or zymosan. The induction of CL in blood leukocytes by the various ligand-coated bacteria is markedly inhibited by azide, KCN catalase, aminotriazole, and EDTA, agents known to inhibit the production of oxygen radicals following stimulation of leukocytes by opsonized bacteria. Two children diagnosed for chronic granulomatous diseases (CGD) of childhood and an apparently healthy sister of one of the male patients completely failed to respond with CL either to the polyelectrolyte-bacteria complexes, liquoid or antibody-coated bacteria and zymosan. It is proposed that liquoid be employed for the rapid screening of defects in certain oxygen-dependent metabolic processes in both PMNs and macrophages. It is also suggested that polyelectrolytes like the ones described in this study may markedly enhance the bactericidal properties of leukocytes and macrophages towards both extracellular and intracellular microorganisms and may perhaps also augment the tumoricidal effects of activated macrophages."

ATPSA specimens were repeatedly obtained until ATPSA turned negative during or after the treatment. The percentage of positive ATPSA specimens reached the lowest value (9.2%) on the fourth day of the course of the treatment, which indicates the acquisition from an infected individual is probably uncommon after the initial treatment. Bacteriological treatment failure (positive ATPSA after 14 days of treatment) occurred in 4.1% of the children. Out of 953 subjects studied, 216 (22.7%) had recurrent infections. More than 30% of the recurrent infections occurred within 2 months after initial infection.

PG were isolated by 4 M guanidine-HCl extraction of whole glomeruli, followed by DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B ion exchange chromatography. The anionic fractions were further purified by chromatography on Sepharose CL-4B. Biochemical analysis of the two resulting peaks revealed the presence of high molecular weight anionic material containing protein, uronic acid, glucosamine, and galactosamine. Enzymatic and chemical susceptibilities indicated the presence of heparan sulfate PG and a galactosamine-containing PG. Immunologic studies revealed the presence of anti-PG antibodies to both PG peaks of the Sepharose CL-4B column in glomerulonephritis sera. Inhibition studies using an ELISA demonstrated that heparan sulfate was a major antigenic determinant. Cross-reactivity with both mammalian and streptococcal hyaluronate was noted. Inhibition studies also indicated the presence of a second antigenic site containing N-acetylgalactosamine, possibly representing chondroitin or dermatan sulfate PG."

CD010502,0,15768791,0,Infection of Haemophilus parainfluenzae in tonsils is associated with IgA nephropathy.,"We investigated the functions of tonsillar mononuclear cells (TMC) regarding whether a Haemophilus parainfluenzae (HP) outer membranes antigen (HPOM) enhances IgA-related cytokine (IFN-gamma, IL-10. and TGF-beta) production in vitro by TMC in IgA nephropathy (IgAN) patients. In addition, we examined the effect of synthetic oligodeoxynucleotide and HPOM stimulation by TMC on IgA production, whether the constant region antisense to IgA inhibits the production of IgA in vitro by TMC. Eighteen patients with IgAN and 25 patients with chronic tonsillitis (CT) from 6 to 45 years (mean age of 20.9 years) participated in this study. TMC were obtained from resected tonsils, and total and HP-specific IgA levels, along with the concentration of TGF-beta, IL-10 and IFN-gamma in the supernatant of stimulated TMC were measured by ELISA. Isolated TMC were cultured with HPOM in the presence of 23 oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs), and the induction of total IgA and HP-specific IgA in the supernatant was also measured using ELISA. To investigate the inhibition of IgA production, TMC were cultured with HPOM and antisence to IgA. We found that IgA-related cytokine (IFN-gamma, IL-10, and TGF-beta) production by unstimulated or stimulated TMC was higher in IgAN patients than CT patients. Two types of synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides produced higher HP-specific IgA than with HPOM stimulation alone. HPOM and antisence IgA inhibited the production of total IgA and HP-specific IgA in dose-depend manner. In conclusion, IFN-gamma, TGF-beta, and IL-10 influence each other in the pathogenesis of IgAN, and infection by not only HP but other bacteria or viruses which possess specific DNA sequences such as CpG motifs induce the production of HP-specific IgA by TMC."

CD010502,0,9794423,0,Role of the hypervariable region in streptococcal M proteins: binding of a human complement inhibitor.,"Antigenic variation allows pathogenic microorganisms to evade the immune system of the infected host. The variable structure must play an important role in pathogenesis, but its function is in most cases unknown. Here, we identify a function for the surface-exposed hypervariable region of streptococcal M5 protein, a virulence factor that inhibits phagocytosis. The hypervariable region of M5 was found to bind the human complement inhibitor FHL-1 (factor H-like protein 1), a 42-kDa plasma protein. Plasma absorption experiments with M5-expressing bacteria showed that the interaction with FHL-1 occurs also under physiologic conditions. Studies of another extensively characterized M protein, M6, indicated that this protein also has a binding site for FHL-1 in the hypervariable region. The complement-inhibitory function of FHL-1 was retained after binding to streptococci, suggesting that bound FHL-1 protects bacteria against complement attack. All available data now indicate that FHL-1, or another human complement inhibitor, binds to the hypervariable region of M proteins. These findings provide insights into the forces that drive antigenic variation and may explain why the hypervariable region of M protein is essential for phagocytosis resistance. Moreover, these data add to a growing body of evidence that human complement inhibitors are major targets for pathogenic microorganisms."

A wound culture grew Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter anitratus, Enterobacter cloacae, and Candida albicans and a blood culture grew group A beta-Streptococcus hemolyticus. The patient's lymphocyte counts were low and his lymphocytes were unable to produce IgG and IgA in vitro. The immunoglobulin-bearing cell studies also failed to demonstrate IgG and IgA bearing cells. Active Tac+ T cells, total T cells, and T cell subsets were at very low levels. Lymphoproliferative response to mitogens was also poor. Migration inhibitory factor production to Candida antigen was also decreased. The initial lymph node biopsy demonstrated no follicular formation and extensive depletion of lymphocytes in both thymic-dependent and thymic-independent areas. After Thymostimulin (a specific bovine thymic extract, TP-1) treatment, the second lymph node biopsy demonstrated germinal centers containing IgA-bearing cells and IgM-bearing cells and, subsequently, cortical and medullary differentiation. Serum IgG, IgA, and IgM became detectable at low levels and IgG-, IgA-, and IgM-bearing lymphocytes appeared in the peripheral blood. This also correlated with in vitro immunoglobulin synthesis. Active Tac+ T cells, total T cells, T cell subsets and lymphoproliferative response to mitogens increased gradually after thymostimulin therapy. This investigation demonstrated the therapeutic effectiveness of Thymostimulin in combined immunodeficiency both histologically and immunologically and the successful reconstitution of B cell function that did not require continued therapy."

The clinical syndrome may mimic gonococcal sepsis. The histologic changes in the skin are those of Sweet's syndrome. The syndrome remits spontaneously in most cases, but it may recur intermittently over a period of years. Treatment with low-dose steroids, tetracycline, or metronidazole suppresses symptoms in most cases, and restoration of normal bowel anatomy is curative. Skin testing with Streptococcus pyogenes antigen causes an excerbation of symptoms, or may provoke the entire syndrome de novo. Bacterial peptidoglycans, especially those of group A streptococci, produce similar arthritis and skin lesions in animal models. Peptidoglycans from numerous intestinal bacteria share common structural and antigenic features with S. pyrogenes peptidoglycan and are suggested as causative of the toxic and immunologic features of this syndrome."

Factors associated with an increased risk of GBS transmission to the neonate include prematurity, premature spontaneous rupture of the membranes before 37 weeks of gestational age, prolonged (> 12 h) rupture of the membranes at full term, fever in the mother, multiple pregnancy, and a history of GBS infection. A study was conducted to evaluate the performance characteristics of a rapid GBS screening test comparatively with conventional microbiological cultures. The 113 high-risk women admitted for delivery to the obstetrics department of the Charleville-Mézières Hospital from January to May 1998 were included in the study. Vaginal specimens were examined by both the Strep B OIA test (International Microbio) and by conventional culturing. Comparison of the results of these two methods showed that sensitivity and specificity of the Strep B OIA test were satisfactory. The Strep B OIA test is a rapid test suitable for use in emergency situations. A positive result should lead to intrapartum prophylactic antimicrobial therapy."

This study questions whether several surface proteins of an OF+ culture are regulated by the positive regulatory protein VirR, in a manner similar to OF- strains. Interruption of the virR region of an OF+ S. pyogenes (strain CS101, M type 49) was performed using a temperature-sensitive plasmid containing a fragment of virR. Interruption of the virR region produced cultures with undetectable amounts of M49 and ScpA proteins, and reduced the yield of FcRA protein. In addition, mutants had a significant reduction in detectable opacity factor. These results suggest that virR functions as a positive regulator of a variety of surface proteins in OF+ strains."
CD010502,0,18257468,0,Detection of dual-infected cases of adenoviruses and coxsackieviruses type B by real-time PCR but not by the conventional viral culture technique.,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the applicability of diagnostic methods for dual-infected cases of human adenoviruses (AdVs) and coxsackieviruses type B (CBs). For this purpose, 100 nasopharyngeal samples from patients with acute exudative tonsillitis and clinically suspected AdV infection were analyzed. Using PCR and real-time PCR techniques for AdVs and CBs, we found 86 AdVs-only positive samples; we also found five dual-infected samples containing 5.4 x 10(5) to 7.1 x 10(8) copies/mL of AdV genomes and 1.4x104 to 1.3 x 10(9) copies/mL of CB genomes. By viral culture using A549 cells, two co-infected samples, which contained over 10(8) copies/mL of AdV genomes and <10(5) copies/mL of CB genomes, became AdV dominant, while three samples with less than 2.0 x 10(6) copies/mL of AdV genomes became CB dominant. An immunochromatography kit for diagnosing AdVs at the bedside was positive for 3/5 dual-infected patients, and PCR techniques for AdVs and CBs were both positive for 5/5. Viral culture is usually considered to be the gold standard for AdV diagnosis, but our results demonstrate the importance of PCR applications for the detection of AdV and CB genomes, particularly in clinical cases of suspected AdV infection. Even though the sample size of dual infection (n=5) is small, our results show the existence of dual infection cases which were difficult to diagnose by viral culture alone."
CD010502,0,3548719,0,"Relation of streptococcal M protein with human and rabbit tropomyosin: the complete amino acid sequence of human cardiac alpha tropomyosin, a highly conserved contractile protein.","Partial sequences of group A streptococcal M proteins exhibit up to 50% sequence identity with segments of rabbit skeletal tropomyosin. It is well recognized that rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease in humans are sequelae of group A streptococcal infection. To examine whether the human cardiac tropomyosin would exhibit greater homology with the streptococcal M proteins, we have now determined its complete amino acid sequence. The amino acid sequence of human cardiac tropomyosin was established from sequence analyses of its peptides derived by enzymic and chemical cleavages, and comparison of these sequences to the reported sequence of rabbit skeletal tropomyosin. These studies have revealed that the amino acid sequence of human cardiac alpha tropomyosin is identical to that of the rabbit skeletal alpha tropomyosin, but for a single conservative substitution of Arg/Lys at position 220. This observation increases the significance of the previously observed sequence homology between streptococcal M protein and rabbit skeletal tropomyosin and may have relevance to the pathogenesis of rheumatic fever. Furthermore, these results rank tropomyosin as one of the most highly conserved contractile proteins between vertebrate species reported thus far."

Lower and borderline antibody titers yet may be found in up to 63% of the population. Only 17% of these persons have clinical symptoms; in the majority infection remains silent. HHV-6 infection apparently occurs already quite early in life, and initial symptoms can occur, such as short-term high fever, sore throat, local lymphadenopathy and skin rash. Lesions disappear without specific treatment. The frequency of positive antibody tests at higher titers rises in patients with immune deficiency and with atypical lymphoproliferative diseases to 60 and 75%. The rise in antibody titers is associated in patients with immune deficiency by characteristic shifts of blood lymphocyte populations, essentially by increase in immature T-lymphocytes. Highest titers are found in patients with lymphoproliferative syndromes, yet the percentage of atypical lymphoid cells harboring the viral genome is low (about 2% of seropositive patients). Thus it appears, that HBLV, similar to other herpesviruses such as Epstein-Barr virus, usually causes a silent seroconversion, yet may be associated with variable clinical pathology when persisting in an active state. Its pathogenic effect might be rather a cofactor contributing to immune disturbance than overt oncogenicity."
CD010502,0,3302145,0,What a difference a day makes: a decision analysis of adult streptococcal pharyngitis.,"With the availability of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal (GABHS) antigen detection tests, the management of adult pharyngitis is being reassessed. A decision analytic model was developed which considered four strategies: immediate treatment, no treatment, performing a rapid antigen test, or obtaining a bacterial culture. Patient outcomes were expressed in ""well"" days, which were reduced by the ""sick"" days associated with adverse reactions to treatment or complications of GABHS infection. When immediate test results are available, testing is the optimal strategy for probabilities of GABHS between 1 and 49 per cent. This range includes almost all patients, using probability estimates based on clinical criteria. The absolute benefit of testing was 0.1 days. The major advantage of a rapid test is the avoidance of penicillin reactions. Variations in the symptomatic benefits of treatment had minimal effects on the analysis. The analysis supports the use of an antigen test for adult patients with pharyngitis."

CD010502,0,7020343,0,Binding of aggregated IgG in the presence of fresh serum: strong association with type 12 group A streptococci.,"Highly selected group A streptococci, 108 strains isolated from different groups of individuals, were tested for binding of aggregated human IgG which had been pre-incubated in fresh human serum. All strains displayed resistance to phagocytosis typical of M-producing strains. Among 73 strains isolated from sporadic cases of acute glomerulo-nephritis (AGN), 34 (47 per cent) bound the aggregates. All of 26 type 12 group A streptococci but none of 15 type 49 strains proved positive in the test system. Furthermore, one type 1 and one type 18 strain were positive. All 9 type 49 strains isolated in a minor epidemic of AGN proved negative. Twenty-six strains of type 12 group A streptococci were isolated during three different prospective studies in which no cases of AGN had occurred; all these strains bound aggregates in the presence of fresh serum. Thus, it was found that the capacity to bind aggregates in the presence of fresh serum was strongly associated with--though not limited to--group A streptococci carrying the type 12 antigen. However, this characteristic is not common to all nephritogenic strains, since all type 49 group A streptococci were negative in the test system."

Peripheral blood lymphocytes from members of eight nuclear families and one kindred of three generations were isolated and purified by F-icoll-Isopaque flotation and cultured together with varying concentrations of antigen. A summary measure of the antigen response data (measured as CPM) was constructed through a weighted regression analysis of response on dose.

Segregation analysis confirmed that response to this antigen is controlled by a major gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner."

In the model, estimates of test sensitivity and specificity, disease prevalence, treatment rates after positive test results, rates of complications for treated and untreated patient-cases, rates of antibiotic-induced complications, treatment effectiveness, and direct dollar costs of diagnosis and therapy were used. Results were expressed in terms of severe penicillin reactions per disease case prevented and dollars per complication prevented. Sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the impact of changes in parameter estimates on model outcomes. With treat all, 90% of streptococcal complications were prevented and there were low short-term direct dollar costs. However, treat all is associated with a high rate of penicillin allergy (70% of which occurs in uninfected children) and is the least cost-effective strategy when the costs of treating complications are included. The marginal cost of antigen test + culture is less than the cost of either one-test strategy. Antigen test + culture is the most cost-effective strategy when the costs of managing the complications of streptococcal infection are considered. Antigen test + culture is the most clinically effective strategy, and its benefits are obtained at a modest marginal cost relative to the one-test strategy."
CD010502,0,11564804,0,Isolated hypervariable regions derived from streptococcal M proteins specifically bind human C4b-binding protein: implications for antigenic variation.,"Antigenic variation in microbial surface proteins represents an apparent paradox, because the variable region must retain an important function, while exhibiting extensive immunological variability. We studied this problem for a group of streptococcal M proteins in which the approximately 50-residue hypervariable regions (HVRs) show essentially no residue identity but nevertheless bind the same ligand, the human complement regulator C4b-binding protein (C4BP). Synthetic peptides derived from different HVRs were found to retain the ability to bind C4BP, implying that the HVR corresponds to a distinct ligand-binding domain that can be studied in isolated form. This finding allowed direct characterization of the ligand-binding properties of isolated HVRs and permitted comparisons between different HVRs in the absence of conserved parts of the M proteins. Affinity chromatography of human serum on immobilized peptides showed that they bound C4BP with high specificity and inhibition experiments indicated that different peptides bound to the same site in C4BP. Different C4BP-binding peptides did not exhibit any immunological cross-reactivity, but structural analysis suggested that they have similar folds. These data show that the HVR of streptococcal M protein can exhibit extreme variability in sequence and immunological properties while retaining a highly specific ligand-binding function."

In this study, anti-basal ganglia antibodies (ABGA) were measured in 15 children with the diagnosis of pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorder associated with streptococcal infection (PANDAS) and compared with those in 15 controls. ELISA and Western immunoblotting (WB) methods were used to detect ABGA against supernatant (S1), pellet (P2), and synaptosomal preparations from adult postmortem caudate, putamen, and globus pallidus. ELISA optical density values did not differ between PANDAS patients and controls across all preparations. Immunoblotting identified multiple bands in all subjects with no differences in the number of bands or their total density. Discriminant analysis, used to assess mean binding patterns, showed that PANDAS patients differed from controls only for the caudate S1 fraction (Wilks' lambda = 0.0236, P < 0.0002), with PANDAS-primarily tic subjects providing the greatest discrimination. Among the epitopes contributing to differences between PANDAS and control in the caudate S1 fraction, mean binding to the epitope at 183 kDa was the most different between groups. In conclusion, ELISA measurements do not differentiate between PANDAS and controls, suggesting a lack of major antibody changes in this disorder. Further immunoblot analyses using a caudate supernatant fraction are required to completely exclude the possibility of minor antibody repertoire differences in PANDAS subjects, especially in those who primarily have tics."

These proteins stimulate CD4(+)- and CD8+ T-lymphocytes by cross-linking the T-cell-antigen receptor with MHC-class-II molecules on accessory or target cells. They are functionally bivalent molecules having distinct interaction sites for variable parts of the T-cell receptor and for nonpolymorphic parts of MHC-class-II molecules. Due to their preferential action on T cells expressing certain V beta-parts of the T-cell receptor the designation ""superantigens"" has been proposed. The mechanism of T-cell stimulation has apparently been conserved in evolution and has been adapted to the host's T-cell-receptor repertoire. The T cells stimulating activity apparently contributes to the pathogenesis of certain infectious diseases. Noteworthy, mice express endogenous ""superantigens"" that have similar properties."

This study compared the CDC recommended sampling and culture method with two qPCR methods for detecting GBS colonization. For a total of 100 pregnant women at 35-37 weeks of gestation, one rectovaginal ESwab each was collected. Eswab medium was inoculated into Lim broth, incubated for 24 h and plated onto chromID™ Strepto B agar (ChromAgar). DNA was extracted with the bioMérieux easyMAG platform, either directly from the rectovaginal ESwab or from Lim broth enrichment culture. Two different qPCR formats were compared, i.e. the hydrolysis probe format (Taqman, Roche) targeting the sip gene and the hybridization probe format (Hybprobe, Roche) targeting the cfb gene. Both qPCR techniques identified 33% of the women as GBS-positive. Only one culture-positive sample was qPCR-negative. QPCR directly on the sample significantly increased the number of women found to be GBS-positive (27%) compared to culture (22%). Moreover, the sensitivity of qPCR after Lim broth enrichment (33%) was again significantly higher than qPCR after DNA extraction directly from the rectovaginal swabs (27%). In conclusion, for prenatal screening of GBS from rectovaginal samples of pregnant women, our results are in accordance with CDC guidelines, which suggest using qPCR after Lim broth enrichment in addition to conventional (culture-based) detection. qPCR after Lim broth enrichment further increased the percentage of GBS-positive women, as detected by direct qPCR, from 27 to 33%, although the bacterial inoculum was low for these subjects."

Affinity-purified antibodies from patient's sera directed against the bacterial AP (anti-alpha) were also shown to react with human and animal AP, which have different structures. Anti-alpha are IgG subtype 3 immunoglobulins, and their light chains are of the kappa type. Upon isoelectric focussing, the anti-alpha formed a scalariform pattern with five to seven bands in the pH range 7-9. The anti-alpha have an opsonic activity and cause a five- to eightfold increase of phagocytosis of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.

Therefore, in this work, the antibody levels in the sera of glaucoma patients, and HSP60 antigenic sites were determined. Analysis by the Hopp and Woods method with GENE 2.2 software identified the possible antigenic sites in the amino acid regions 200-213, 226-237, 278-290, 357-368 and 418-427 of Streptococcus pyogenes HSP60 (HSP60Sp). According to these, polypeptides were generated truncating the hsp60Sp gene by PCR. Antibody levels to HSP60Sp and the generated polypeptides were measured by ELISA in serum of glaucomatous patients and in healthy subjects. Glaucomatous patients showed higher antibody levels to rHSP60Sp (p=0.002) than healthy subjects. We found that the high anti-rHSP60Sp antibody levels are associated with the disease (OR=5.2; IC95% of 1.6-16.7; p<0.05). Here we report that amino acid regions 357-368 and 418-427 of HSP60Sp are the main antigenic sites, because when they are absent the level of anti-HSP60 antibodies decreased around 80%. These results suggest that the regions 357-368 and 418-427 of HSP60Sp could be associated with glaucoma."

Of the group D streptococci, 98% of the Enterococcus species and 100% of the group D non-Enterococcus species were correctly identified. Of the commonly occurring viridans group Streptococcus species, 93% were correctly identified, and 79% of the less frequently occurring viridans group Streptococcus species were correctly identified. All of the Streptococcus pneumoniae and Aerococcus strains tested were correctly identified."
CD010502,0,3882750,0,Ten-minute detection of group A streptococci in pediatric throat swabs.,"A 10-min latex agglutination test kit, Culturette Brand Ten-Minute Group A Strep ID (Marion Scientific, Div. of Marion Laboratories, Inc., Kansas City, Mo.), was assessed for the rapid detection of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus directly from a throat swab. Four hundred and thirty-five throat swab specimens from children with suspected group A streptococcal infection were tested by the Ten-Minute Group A Strep ID and by concurrent conventional culture. The strep test was effective in detecting group A streptococcal infection; 90% (63/70) of culture-positive specimens gave positive latex tests. The specificity of the test was 99.2% (362/365). The predictive values were 95.5% for positives and 98.1% for negatives. Overall agreement with culture was 98% (425/435). This test offers a sensitive and specific method for the early detection of group A beta-hemolytic streptococci in throat swabs of children and would be most useful in a hospital laboratory or pediatrician's office."
CD010502,0,2450950,0,The importance of the location of antibody binding on the M6 protein for opsonization and phagocytosis of group A M6 streptococci.,"One of 19 mAbs against the native group A streptococcal M6 protein proved opsonic for type 6 organisms in a bactericidal assay. The opsonic and three nonopsonic antibodies were selected for isotype and complement fixation studies based on previous knowledge of their epitope site on the M6 molecule. While mAb 3B8 (IgG3), whose epitope is in the NH2-terminal hypervariable region of the molecule (distal from the cell), and mAbs 10B6 (IgG2a) and 10F5 (IgG2b), both located in the conserved central region of the molecule, all fix complement, 10A11 (IgG1) did not. Only mAb 3B8 was opsonic despite the fact that mAbs 10B6 and 10F5 both exhibited similar complement-fixing capacity, binding titer, and surface exposure of epitopes. Analysis of antibodies raised against synthetic peptides representing various regions of the M6 protein showed that only the amino-terminal peptide (residues 1-21) was capable of eliciting opsonic antibodies, despite the fact that peptides from other areas produced antibodies with high-binding titers to the native M6 protein and also with the ability to bind to intact streptococcal cells. These results not only support the observed type specificity of opsonic antibodies, but also clearly point to the importance of the location of antibody binding on the M molecule relative to the actual functional capacity of the antibody with respect to the opsonization and phagocytosis of M6 streptococci. These results may underscore the recently observed role of complement Factor H in the antiphagocytic activity of the M protein."
CD010502,0,3884556,0,[Comparative immunocytochemical studies of recurrent tonsillitis and infectious mononucleosis].,"72 patients suffering from recurrent tonsillitis, and ten with infectious mononucleosis were compared by morphological and immunological studies. The distribution of Ig-containing plasma cells (IgA, IgG, IgM), lambda- and kappa-chains, lysozyme and Alpha-1-antitrypsin in tonsils was determined by the unlabelled antibody peroxidase-antiperoxidase method and correlated with the structure of the tonsils (follicles, interfollicular area, and reticular epithelium). While recurrent tonsillitis was associated with slight follicular hyperplasia, infectious mononucleosis was characterised by a marked distortion of the tonsillar architecture, reduction in the number of follicles and a mixed cellular proliferation. The cellular infiltration was composed of small, well differentiated lymphocytes, atypical lymphocytes (Downey cells), plasma cells, immunoblasts, and a variable number of pleomorphic immunoblasts (Reed-Sternberg-like-cells). The binucleated or multinucleated immunoblasts contained IgA, IgG, and IgM. Ig-producing cells occurred in all compartments. In recurrent tonsillitis most were found in the reticular epithelium, but in infectious mononucleosis their density was highest in the interfollicular area. There was a general prominence of IgG cells, confirming that the tonsils resemble lymph nodes more closely than the lymphoid tissue of the alimentary tract. Cells containing lambda and kappa chains were found in all follicle centres and extra-follicular areas. They gave evidence of polyclonality in both diseases. Lysozyme and Alpha-1-antitrypsin were present only in the vessels."
CD010502,0,8724726,0,Evaluation of suprapubic bladder aspiration for detection of group B streptococcal antigen by latex agglutination in neonatal urine.,"Our objective was to determine whether urine collection by suprapubic bladder aspiration (SBA) improves the specificity of the group B streptococcal (GBS) latex agglutination (LA) test by avoiding contamination of urine with GBS from perineal and rectal colonization that can result in a positive LA test in an uninfected infant when the urine is collected by bag. Part 1 consists of a retrospective review of the medical records of 113 infants who had urine collected by SBA for GBS LA testing as part of evaluation for possible sepsis. The sensitivity and specificity of the urine LA test was assessed by comparing it with blood culture results. In part 2, a prospective analysis was performed of 19 newborns who had rectal and vaginal/penile cultures as well as urine by SBA and bag for GBS cultures and LA. Results of LA testing on urine collected by both of these methods were compared with results of urine, perineal, and rectal cultures. In the retrospective review of GBS LA testing performed on 113 consecutive urine specimens collected by SBA from neonates being evaluated for suspected sepsis, the sensitivity and specificity were 67% and 89%, respectively, when compared with blood culture results. Twelve infants who had a positive LA test result but a sterile blood culture (BC-,LA+) were compared with 95 infants with both blood cultures and urine LA tests negative for GBS (BC-, LA-). BC-, LA+ infants were more likely than those with BC-, LA- to have an immature to total neutrophil (I/T) ratio > or = 0.16 at 12 and 24 hours (p = 0.04 and 0.02, respectively). In the prospective study, we found that a positive GBS LA test can be due to perineal contamination and possibly to gastrointestinal absorption of GBS antigen. No false positive LA test results occurred on urine obtained by SBA; however, use of this method failed to detect the one infant with GBS bacteremia. Because of suboptimal sensitivity and specificity, use of the GBS LA test on urine obtained either by SBA or bag cannot be recommended for diagnosis of early onset GBS disease."
CD010502,0,19710271,0,emm1/sequence type 28 strains of group A streptococci that express covR at early stationary phase are associated with increased growth and earlier SpeB secretion.,"Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococcus [GAS]) is a versatile human pathogen, and emm1/sequence type 28 (ST28) is the most frequently isolated type from GAS infections. The emm1/ST28 strain is associated with necrotizing fasciitis and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. Growth-phase regulation is one of the important regulatory mechanisms in GAS, which controls gene expression at restricted phases of growth. CovRS, a two-component regulatory system, is considered the regulator of streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin B (SpeB) and is thought to be activated in the exponential phase of growth. In the present study, Northern hybridization analysis showed that 52% of the analyzed GAS strains expressed covR at the exponential phase, but 48% of the strains expressed covR at the early stationary phase of growth. Strains transcribing covR at the early stationary phase showed better growth and earlier SpeB expression than the other group of strains. Multilocus sequence typing and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis showed only emm1/ST28 strains (which comprise a clonal cluster) were expressing covR at the early stationary phase of growth, indicating that emm1/ST28 strains have special characteristics which may be related to their worldwide distribution."
CD010502,0,1410954,0,An evaluation of a commercial co-agglutination test for the diagnosis of group A streptococcal tonsillitis in a family practice.,"The result of a rapid co-agglutination test was compared with the clinical diagnosis of group A streptococcal tonsillitis, a laboratory culture from the throat serving as the correct result. The study was carried out in a family practice, with two GPs partaking: it included 105 consecutive patients. The outcome of the rapid test was significantly correlated to the degree of growth determined by throat culture, and it was superior to the clinical judgement. The statistical analysis of the results of the rapid test revealed (95% confidence limits in brackets) a specificity of 97% (91-100), sensitivity of 68% (48-84), a positive predictive value of 90% (70-99), and a negative predictive value of 89% (81-95). Although the co-agglutination test was superior to the clinical diagnosis, the sensitivity of this test is rather low when compared with other recently evaluated rapid tests for use in family practice."
CD010502,0,15258832,0,Laboratory detection of group B Streptococcus for prevention of perinatal disease.,"Group B Streptococcus (GBS) or Streptococcus agalactiae emerged in the 1970s as the leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. Today, GBS remains one of the leading causes of sepsis and meningitis in newborns despite important prevention efforts, including the issuance of recommendations for prevention of perinatal GBS disease by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the American Academy of Pediatrics in 1996/1997. The gastrointestinal tract is the natural human reservoir for GBS and is the likely source of vaginal colonization. GBS disease in newborns usually results from ascending spread of GBS into the amniotic fluid, which leads to neonatal colonization and to invasive disease in some infants. This review analyzes the various laboratory methods available for the detection of GBS from clinical samples collected from pregnant women and will discuss their impact in the prevention of neonatal GBS infections and in the rationalization of antibiotic use. The recent commercial availability of a rapid and highly sensitive real-time polymerase chain reaction assay suitable for the specific detection of GBS from vagino-rectal samples obtained from pregnant women during delivery, which is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, provides improvements in the accuracy and rapidity of GBS colonization screening compared to the standard culture-based method using the recommended selective enrichment broth."
CD010502,0,8825809,0,Persistent elevation of immunoglobulin G titer against the C region of recombinant group A streptococcal M protein in patients with rheumatic fever.,"To analyze the immune response to the C region of group A streptococcal M protein in patients with rheumatic fever (RF), we cloned the structural gene for the C region of type 12 M protein and produced recombinant C region of M protein. IgG titers against the C region of M protein were measured by ELISA from sera of patients with RF (n = 10), uncomplicated streptococcal pharyngitis (n = 26), and age-matched controls (n = 49). IgG titers against the C region were significantly higher in patients with RF than in controls or patients with uncomplicated streptococcal pharyngitis (43 versus 1.5 or 1.8 micrograms/mL, p < 0.01). Studies using overlapping synthetic peptides of the C region demonstrated that increased IgG reactivity was observed against the amino-terminal halves of the C repeat blocks (C1, C2) in RF, indicating that these domains are the main immunodominant epitopes in the C region."
CD010502,0,2670192,0,Streptococcal M protein: molecular design and biological behavior.,"M protein is a major virulence determinant for the group A streptococcus by virtue of its ability to allow the organism to resist phagocytosis. Common in eucaryotes, the fibrillar coiled-coil design for the M molecule may prove to be a common motif for surface proteins in gram-positive organisms. This type of structure offers the organism several distinct advantages, ranging from antigenic variation to multiple functional domains. The close resemblance of this molecular design to that of certain mammalian proteins could help explain on a molecular level the formation of epitopes responsible for serological cross-reactions between microbial and mammalian proteins. Many of the approaches described in the elucidation of the M-protein structure may be applied for characterizing similar molecules in other microbial systems."
CD010502,0,8929721,0,Mitral regurgitation may be related with previous streptococcal infection.,"We measured anti M protein antibody (AMPA) titres in children with idiopathic mitral regurgitation (MR), streptococcal infection, rheumatic fever (RF), post-streptococcal acute glomerulonephritis (AGN) and normal healthy children. We investigated the association of MR with streptococcal infection and whether high AMPA titres can be used as persisting evidence of previous streptococcal infection. AMPA titres were measured with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We found significantly higher antibody titres in patients with MR and in streptococcal infection, RF, and AGN than in healthy controls. In the MR group (n = 15), 54% patients had AMPA titres above the 90th percentile value that was found in normal controls. An elevated AMPA titre persisted for a long period even when the anti-streptolysin O titres had declined to normal in RF patients. Our data suggest that the high AMPA titres in MR should be further investigated to clarify the probable association with previous streptococcal infection."
CD010502,0,8077386,0,Comparison of Gen-Probe Group A streptococcus Direct Test with culture for diagnosing streptococcal pharyngitis.,"The Group A Streptococcus Direct Test (GP-ST test; Gen-Probe, Inc., San Diego, Calif.) was compared with culture for the detection of Streptococcus pyogenes from throat swabs of 767 patients with pharyngitis. Swabs were tested by the GP-ST test after inoculating a 5% sheep blood agar (SBA) plate. SBA plates were incubated at 35 degrees C in room air for 72 h. SBA plates with no evidence of beta-hemolytic colonies after 18 to 24 h of incubation were subcultured by taking a swipe across the primary inoculum from the SBA plate to an agar selective for Streptococcus spp. In a low-prevalence (11.9%) population and in comparison with the number of positive cultures detected by the 72-h single-culture method (SBA plate method), the GP-ST test had a sensitivity of 88.6%, a specificity of 97.8%, a positive predictive value of 83.9%, and a negative predictive value of 98.5%. In comparison with the growth of any colonies of S. pyogenes on the 72-h SBA plates plus a subculture onto selective blood agar, the sensitivities and specificities were as follows: 72-h SBA plate method, 96.7 and 100%, respectively; GP-ST test, 85.7 and 97.8%, respectively. The GP-ST test is an easy-to-perform, reliable test for batch screening of throat swabs for S. pyogenes."
CD010502,0,11173186,0,Community-acquired pneumonia in children due to Mycoplasma pneumoniae: diagnostic performance of a seminested 16S rDNA-PCR.,"A 16S rDNA-PCR assay for Mycoplasma pneumoniae applied to nasopharyngeal secretion (NPS) or pharyngeal swab (PS) from children with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) was prospectively compared to serological tests including complement fixation (CF) test, a mu-capture enzyme immuno assay (EIA) for the detection of specific IgM, and an EIA for the detection of specific IgG. During a 24-months-period diagnosis of active M. pneumoniae infection was established in 32 (12.6%) of 253 patients for whom paired sera were available. In the acute phase, the sensitivities of PCR from NPS and PS, CF test, IgM EIA, and IgG EIA were 90.0%, 79.3%, 46.9%, 78.1%, and 59.4%, respectively. The corresponding specificities were 98.1%, 98.6%, 97.6%, 87.1%, and 72.4%, respectively. Thus, the 16S rDNA-PCR assay provides a highly sensitive and accurate tool for the rapid diagnosis of M. pneumoniae infection in children with CAP."
CD010502,0,3540891,0,Diagnosis and management of children with streptococcal pharyngitis.,"Physicians must be aware that rheumatic fever can no longer be considered a disease of the past and be prepared to diagnose and treat promptly children with streptococcal pharyngitis. Although the rapid diagnostic kits for detecting Group A streptococci in pharyngeal swabs are not perfect, they can be useful to the practitioner if positive because the specificity of the test is excellent. Thus, a child with pharyngitis who has a positive rapid test should be treated immediately to shorten the period of morbidity and to reduce the risk of nonsuppurative sequelae. Upon completion of a 10-day treatment course there is usually no reason to reculture the pharynx if the child is asymptomatic. Recurrence of symptoms is an indication to perform another culture and to retreat with either benzathine penicillin G or erythromycin depending on compliance of the patient and the agent used initially for therapy. Eradication of Group A streptococci from the pharynx of children who are carriers is usually a difficult and unnecessary task. When eradication is indicated, such as when the carrier has had contact with a person who had rheumatic fever, rifampin should be added to the penicillin regimen (Table 4)."
CD010502,0,17009909,0,Rapid antigen detection testing in diagnosing group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis.,"Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS) is the most common bacterial cause of acute pharyngitis. Clinical criteria alone are not reliable enough to diagnose GABHS pharyngitis. Microbiological-testing is required for correct diagnosis. Although a throat swab culture remains the gold standard for documenting the presence of GABHS, a significant disadvantage of the culture is the delayed time of 1-2 days to obtain results. Most rapid antigen detection tests can provide results in less than 15 min. Rapid identification and treatment of patients with GABHS pharyngitis can reduce the risk of the spread of disease, may shorten the duration of symptoms, decrease the incidence of suppurative complications, decrease the amount of time lost from school/work, decrease the inappropriate use of antibiotics, reduce patient/parent dissatisfaction and alleviate the need for costly follow-up visits. All rapid antigen detection tests involve extraction of the group-specific carbohydrate antigen from the GABHS cell wall and identification of the antigen by an immunological reaction. There are numerous rapid antigen detection testing methods, namely latex agglutination, enzyme immunoassay, optical immunoassay, chemiluminescent DNA probes and PCR methods. Most of the rapid antigen detection tests that are currently in use have an excellent specificity of greater than 95% and a sensitivity of greater than or equal to 90%. Owing to the high specificity of the rapid antigen detection tests, a positive rapid antigen detection test is accepted as adequate for the diagnosis of GABHS pharyngitis. Conversely, confirmation of a negative antigen detection test with a throat culture result is necessary, unless the physician has ascertained in his/her practice that the sensitivity of the rapid antigen test used is comparable with that of a throat culture."
CD010502,0,3884659,0,Detection of group A streptococcal antigen directly from throat swabs with a ten-minute latex agglutination test.,"Results obtained with the Culturette brand 10-Minute Group A Strep ID system were compared with culture results to measure the ability of this system to detect group A streptococci directly from more than 800 throat swabs. Our study showed a sensitivity of 92.4% and a specificity of 92.8% for this acid extraction, latex agglutination method when compared with anaerobic culturing for group A streptococci. The results suggest that the 10-Minute Group A Strep ID method may prove to be a useful, very rapid and easy method for diagnosing group A streptococcal pharyngitis directly from throat swabs. Further studies are suggested to determine whether this diagnostic method could stand alone or would have to be used in conjunction with culture."

The present study demonstrated that emm1 strains were consistently responsible for about 20% of invasive GAS infections, while variations in the frequencies of the other types were noted, although the causes of most cases of invasive infections were restricted to emm1, emm3, emm4, emm6, emm12, and emm18. During the 1994 to 1996 surveillance period, an emm89 epidemic clone spread across the northern part of Italy. A restricted macrolide resistance phenotype-type distribution of the bacteriophage-encoded speA toxin as well as of macrolide resistance genes was noted over time. Indeed, the recent acquisition of macrolide resistance in previously susceptible emm types was observed."
CD010502,0,16517846,0,Sensitivities of antigen detection and PCR assays greatly increased compared to that of the standard culture method for screening for group B streptococcus carriage in pregnant women.,"Group B streptococcus (GBS) is a major cause of serious infections in neonates. The 2002 revised guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for the prevention of perinatal GBS disease recommend that all pregnant women be screened for GBS carriage at between 35 and 37 weeks of gestation and that intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis be given to carriers. We studied the performances of four different GBS detection assays in the context of antenatal screening. Between May and August 2004, the 605 vaginorectal swab specimens received at our bacteriology laboratory for GBS antenatal detection were tested by the four assays. The standard culture method was done according to the CDC recommendations. The three experimental assays performed with the growth from the selective enrichment (LIM) broth (Todd-Hewitt broth with 15 mug/ml nalidixic acid and 10 mug/ml colistin) after overnight incubation were a GBS antigen detection assay (PathoDx) and two PCR assays (for cfb and scpB). The most accurate assay was the scpB PCR (sensitivity, 99.6%; specificity, 100%), followed by the cfb PCR (sensitivity, 75.3%; specificity, 100%), GBS antigen detection (sensitivity, 57.3%; specificity, 99.5%), and standard culture (sensitivity, 42.3%; specificity, 100%). The GBS antigen detection assay was found to be more sensitive than the standard culture method, and moreover, the assay has a low cost and is easy to perform in all obstetrical centers which have access to the most basic of diagnostic microbiology services. We believe that antigen detection on incubated LIM broth should replace the standard culture method for screening for GBS carriage at 35 to 37 weeks of gestation. The impact of the greater sensitivities of PCR assays on the diminution of neonatal GBS infections remains to be demonstrated."

CD010502,0,17982224,0,Antimicrobial susceptibility patterns and macrolide resistance genes of beta-hemolytic viridans group streptococci in a tertiary Korean hospital.,"The aim of this study was to investigate antimicrobial susceptibilities and macrolide resistance mechanisms of beta-hemolytic viridans group streptococci (VGS) in a tertiary Korean hospital. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of seven antimicrobials were determined for 103 beta-hemolytic VGS isolated from various specimens. The macrolide resistance mechanisms of erythromycin-resistant isolates were studied by the double disk test and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The overall resistance rates of beta-hemolytic VGS were found to be 47.5% to tetracycline, 3.9% to chloramphenicol, 9.7% to erythromycin, and 6.8% to clindamycin, whereas all isolates were susceptible to penicillin G, ceftriaxone, and vancomycin. Among ten erythromycin-resistant isolates, six isolates expressed a constitutive MLS(B) (cMLS(B)) phenotype, and each of the two isolates expressed the M phenotype, and the inducible MLS(B) (iMLS(B)) phenotype. The resistance rates to erythromycin and clindamycin of beta-hemolytic VGS seemed to be lower than those of non-beta-hemolytic VGS in our hospital, although cMLSB phenotype carrying erm(B) was dominant in beta-hemolytic VGS."

The proportion of Ig-positive cells and T cell subsets in both tonsils were quantitatively studied by the image analyzer (CUE-2, Olympus, USA). The results were summarized as follows: 1) There was no significant difference in proportions of Ig-positive cells and T cell subsets between tonsils and adenoids. 2) IgG- and IgD-positive cells in the tonsils were significantly increased in cases with recurrent tonsillitis than in those with simple tonsillar hypertrophy. 3) Number of IgA2-positive cells were significantly changed, i.e., decreased in the subepithelial area of tonsils and increased in the interfollicular area of adenoids in cases complicated with otitis media with effusion. 4) In cases complicated with nasal allergy, IgE-positive cells were significantly increased in the interfollicular area in both of those tonsils and adenoids. These results indicate that the image analyzer will be a breakthrough in quantitative study on the immunohistology of tonsils and adenoids and give us useful informations about roles of the tonsil and the adenoid on the local immunity of the upper respiratory airway."

CD010502,0,2113792,0,Biological characterization of a new radioactive labeling reagent for bacterial penicillin-binding proteins.,"Radiolabeled penicillin G is widely used as the imaging agent in penicillin-binding protein (PBP) assays. The disadvantages of most forms of labeled penicillin G are instability on storage and the long exposure times usually required for autoradiography or fluorography of electrophoretic gels. We investigated the utility of radioiodinated penicillin V as an alternative reagent. Radioiodination of p-(trimethylstannyl)penicillin V with [125I]Na, using a modification of the chloramine-T method, is simple, high yielding, and site specific. We demonstrated the general equivalence of commercially obtained [3H]penicillin G and locally synthesized [125I]penicillin V (IPV) in their recognition of bacterial PBPs. Profiles of PBPs in membranes from Bacteroides fragilis, Escherichia coli, Providencia rettgeri, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, and Enterococcus faecium labeled with IPV or [3H]penicillin G were virtually identical. Use of IPV as the imaging agent in competition experiments for determination of the affinities of various beta-lactam antibiotics for the PBPs of E. coli yielded results similar to those obtained in experiments with [3H]penicillin G. Dried electrophoretic gels from typical PBP experiments, using IPV at 37.3 Ci/mmol and 30 micrograms/ml, exposed X-ray film in 8 to 24 h. The stability of IPV on storage at 4 degrees C was inversely proportional to specific activity. At 37.3 Ci/mmol and 60 micrograms/ml, IPV retained useful activity for at least 60 days at 4 degrees C. IPV represents a practical and stable reagent for rapid PBP assays."

Sixty others (controls) received only diphtheria-tetanus toxoid-pertussis vaccine at the same ages and were not subsequently immunized against Hib. We investigated Hib pharyngeal colonization using the antiserum agar method and the concentrations of serum IgG antibody to the type b capsule by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. At 4 years of age the Hib colonization rates in vaccinees and controls were 8% (5 of 60) and 5% (3 of 60), respectively. The children colonized with Hib had greater serum anti-capsular IgG concentrations than did noncolonized children (P < 0.001), and colonized vaccinees tended to have higher concentrations than colonized controls (P = 0.053). Regardless of Hib colonization status vaccinees had greater antibody concentrations than controls (P < 0.001). Forty-nine percent of vaccinees had an antibody concentration > 1 microgram/ml. There was an inverse relationship between the Hib colony count on culture and the serum IgG concentration. These data indicate that the increase in serum antibody concentration after immunization with an Hib conjugate vaccine is sustained and that immunization primes for a booster response on exposure to Hib. There may be a relationship between previous Hib conjugate immunization and the density of Hib colonization in children."

The infections diagnosed included Neisseria meningitidies, group A streptococcus, Rickettsia rickettsii, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Ehrlichia sp., Bacillus anthracis, Leptospira sp., Clostridium sp., Klebsiella sp., Legionella sp., Yersinia pestis, and Treponema pallidum. Bacteria were detected in the adrenal of 40 (61%) cases. Adrenal hemorrhage was present in 39 (60%) cases. Bacteria or bacterial antigens were observed in 31 (79%) of the cases with adrenal hemorrhage including 14 with N. meningitidis, four with R. rickettsii, four with S. pneumoniae, three with group A streptococcus, two with S. aureus, two with B. anthracis, one with T. pallidum, and one with Legionella sp. Bacterial antigens were observed in nine of 26 non-hemorrhagic adrenal glands that showed inflammatory foci (four cases), edema (two cases), congestion (two cases), or necrosis (one case). Hemorrhage is the most frequent adrenal gland pathology observed in fatal bacterial infections. Bacteria and bacterial antigens are frequently seen in adrenal glands with hemorrhage and may play a pathogenic role. Although N. meningitidis is the most frequent bacteria associated with adrenal gland pathology, a broad collection of bacteria can also cause adrenal lesions."
CD010502,0,12447611,0,Epstein-Barr virus and human papillomavirus infections and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas.,"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and human papillomavirus (HPV) are known to exhibit oncogenic potential. Target cells for both viruses include oropharyngeal elements. The present study investigated whether EBV or HPV infection are associated with palatine tonsil carcinoma (PTC) and/or tongue carcinoma (TC). The study included 28 adult patients with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma, including 14 patients with PTC and 14 patients with TC. The control group included 20 healthy adult volunteers. Sera of all patients and controls were tested for IgG anti-EA antibodies, IgG anti-VCA antibodies, and IgG anti-EBNA antibodies. DNA extracted from the tumors was tested for the presence of EBV DNA and HPV DNA using PCR-ELISA. In parallel, the presence of EBV DNA was tested in the peripheral blood in all healthy individuals and patients. In addition, attempts were made to detect HPV 16 and HPV 18 using other PCR amplification techniques. Serum anti-EBV antibodies were detected in 24 patients (12 patients with PTC and 12 patients with TC). The frequency of detection of the antibodies did not significantly differ between the groups of patients and the control individuals. Most positive patients and controls demonstrated a serological pattern typical for past EBV infection. EBV DNA was identified in 12 cases of PTC and in 12 cases of TC (altogether 86% cases). In 10 PTC patients, 8 TC patients, and only 2 healthy individuals EBV DNA was detected in peripheral blood. HPV DNA was detected in only 3 cases (1 sample of PTC and 2 samples of TC). These results suggest that the etiopathogenesis of oropharyngeal cancers may be associated with EBV infection much more frequently than with HPV infection."

CD010502,0,10969898,0,Acute glomerulonephritis.,"Acute glomerulonephritis (AGN) is a representative disease of acute nephritic syndrome characterized by the sudden appearance of edema, hematuria, proteinuria, and hypertension. The prototype of AGN is acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (APSGN). ""Nephritogenic streptococci"" are defined as organisms that are cultured from a patient who develops AGN. Although only a limited number of M-types of streptococci have been recognized as ""nephritogenic streptococci"", all M-types of streptococci may have nephritogenic potential because the genes for major putative nephritogenic antigens such as SPEB and NAPIr are found to be present in all group A streptococci thus far examined. Pathogenic mechanisms for APSGN involving both humoral and cell-mediated immunity have been recently proposed. The role of humoral immunity is presumed to be mediated by the in situ formation of nephritogenic streptococcal antigen-antibody complexes and circulating immune complexes. While in the cellular immune component a role for delayed-type hypersensitivity has been suggested to contribute to the pathogenesis of APSGN."
CD010502,0,7017016,0,Enhanced phagocytosis of group A streptococci M type 6 by oleic acid.,"M protein, located on the surface fimbriae of group A streptococci, is antiphagocytic by unknown means. It is known that oleic acid kills group A streptococci and distorts the fimbriae. The effect of oleic acid on phagocytosis of group A streptococci was examined. Phagocytosis of a strain possessing M protein (M+) and its M- variant was assessed by uptake of radiolabeled bacteria and by chemiluminescence. The M- but not the M+ streptococci were well phagocytized and induced chemiluminescence. Oleic acid-killed and heat-killed streptococci (both M+ and M-) were readily phagocytized and induced sustained chemiluminescence. M+ streptococci killed by ultraviolet irradiation were inefficiently phagocytized and did not induce chemiluminescence. Oleic acid-killed M+ streptococci absorbed type-specific antibody. An extract of M protein reduced the bactericidal capacity of oleic acid. It is proposed that oleic acid may bind to and alter the M protein of group A streptococci and thereby enhance phagocytosis."
CD010502,0,2997713,0,Detection of a unique human V kappa IV germline gene by a cloned cDNA probe.,"We have cloned the cDNA encoding the KIV chain of a human antibody with specificity against the major carbohydrate antigen of Streptococcus A. The cDNA has been used as a genetic probe to estimate the number of germline VKIV genes in human DNA. The presence of unique hybridizing bands on digestion of human DNA with several restriction endonucleases and the equivalence of the DNA in a band to a single gene per haploid genome point to the conclusion that there is a unique human VKIV germline gene. The corollary of this conclusion is that the diversity of human VKIV chains must be exclusively due to somatic mutation. This is supported by examination of the sequences of human KIV chain genes and their KIV chain products. Fusion of the unique germline VKIV gene (1) with one of several JK segments, followed by somatic mutations in the V region of the rearranged KIV gene, can account for the known sequences. The restricted germline gene repertoire may account for the small proportion of human KIV chains in the human K chain sequence library (2)."

New variants of the Sic protein arise very rapidly by positive selection in human populations during M1 epidemics. The human antibody response to Sic was analyzed. Of 636 persons living in diverse localities, 43% had anti-Sic serum antibodies, but only 16.4% had anti-M1 protein serum antibody. Anti-Sic antibody was also present in nasal wash specimens in high frequency. Linear B cell epitope mapping showed that serum antibodies recognized epitopes located in structurally variable regions of Sic and the amino terminal hypervariable region of the M1 protein. Phage display analyses confirmed that the polymorphic regions of Sic are primary targets of host antibodies. These results support the hypothesis that selection of Sic variants occurs on mucosal surfaces by a mechanism that involves acquired host antibody."
CD010502,0,3313608,0,Rapid throat-culture as diagnostic aid: ineffective in decreasing antibiotic prescriptions.,"An overnight slide-culture for the detection of group A streptococci was introduced in a Finnish health centre. The number of patients from whom a throat culture was obtained increased from 55% to 70% with the new method. Despite this increase, the prescribing habits of primary care physicians did not change. Treatment was in most cases (84-90% of those treated) still initiated before culture results were available, and antibacterial medication was discontinued only occasionally (1-3%). Physicians usually decided the treatment during the first consultation. These findings contradict earlier studies where prescriptions decreased during rapid culture. Use of throat cultures as diagnostic aid should be reconsidered, especially when more rapid methods now are available."

Strong relative segregation was recorded for 883 positive B cell typing in patients with rheumatic heart disease in both geographic locations as compared with that in normal unaffected controls. In patients with acute rheumatic fever, studies of actual B-lymphocyte membrane binding by anti-883 monoclonal antibody and sonicated group A streptococcal membrane antigens showed separate but contiguous localization on isolated cell surfaces. Although physically distinct, 883 B cell alloantigen and sonicated group A streptococcal membrane antigens moved together in cell capping studies after incubation at 37 degrees C. These findings reaffirm the apparent close association between 883 B cell alloantigen and rheumatic heart disease. They also demonstrate that the B cell alloantigen 883 itself is physically distinct from but very close to sites on antigen-reactive B cells actually binding to group A streptococcal membrane antigens."

CD010502,0,3899481,0,The detection of streptococcal antigens using monoclonal antibodies.,"Recent advances in hybridoma technology have allowed the development of homogeneous immunologic reagents of defined specificity, activity, and reproducibility. During the last few years, the number of monoclonal antibodies directed against bacteria has increased exponentially, and research investigations have focused on the use of monoclonal antibodies for the diagnosis and therapy of infectious diseases. Monoclonal antibody technology offers a rapid, specific diagnosis of bacterial infection, long before culture results are available. We have described the use of monoclonal antibodies for the detection of group B streptococcal (GBS) infections in mothers and infants at risk to develop invasive GBS disease. Specifically, we have used the anti-GBS monoclonal antibodies to detect GBS colonization, serotype bacterial isolates in the laboratory, and identify GBS antigens in body fluid specimens. We have also discussed the use of anti-GBS monoclonal antibodies to confer protection against fatal infection in mice. Monoclonal antibodies against group A streptococcus and Streptococcus pneumoniae have also been developed with the potential for the rapid diagnosis of serious and often life-threatening infections, particularly in immunocompromised individuals. With further refinements in monoclonal antibody technology in the future, streptococcal hybridomas may replace standard culture techniques for bacterial identification in the microbiology laboratory."

In the cases of cardiovascular system damage significant rise of Tp-I levels in 48,2%; and Ck-MB levels in 36.5% has been found. In 39% of cases positive was only Tp-I, (Ck-MB was negative in this 39% of cases). The study allows to use investigated markers as the diagnostic criteria of cardiovascular damage, to reveal the high risk group in children with tonsillitis and recurrent respiratory tract disease, as they really represent the candidates for future meaningful damage to cardiovascular system, which will require itself further monitoring of clinical and laboratory parameters and including of prevention activities in their life style."

CD010502,0,1996575,0,Plasma terminal complement complexes in acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis.,"In most instances of acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (APSGN), activation of the complement system occurs, as reflected by decreased levels of the complement proteins C3, C5, and properdin (P). Recent studies implicate terminal complement complexes (TCC) in the pathogenesis of glomerular injury. The fluid phase TCC, SC5b-9, reflects the formation of membrane-bound C5b-9 and has been used as a clinical marker in various diseases. Plasma concentrations of SC5b-9 were measured with an enzyme immunoassay using a monoclonal antibody to a neoantigen expressed on the SC5b-9 complex in 13 children who presented with clinical and pathologic features of APSGN. SC5b-9 was significantly elevated in all plasmas obtained within 30 days after onset of clinical glomerulonephritis. Concentrations of SC5b-9 in acute plasmas were significantly higher than those of paired convalescent samples. For individual patients, as SC5b-9 concentration returned to normal there was a coincident decrease in serum creatinine concentration and urinary protein excretion, signifying clinical improvement in glomerulonephritis. Thus, TCC generation commonly occurs in the early stages of APSGN and may be of importance in the pathogenesis of the condition."

CD010502,0,19193848,0,Nucleic acid amplification tests for diagnosis of Neisseria gonorrhoeae oropharyngeal infections.,"The optimal methods for the diagnosis of pharyngeal Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection are uncertain. The objective of this study was to define the performance of culture and nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) for the diagnosis of pharyngeal N. gonorrhoeae. In this cross-sectional study, males and females >15 years old who acknowledged performing fellatio or cunnilingus (in the previous 2 months) were recruited from three clinics (two human immunodeficiency virus clinics and one sexually transmitted diseases clinic) located in Birmingham, AL. The test performance of culture for N. gonorrhoeae, the Gen-Probe Aptima Combo 2 transcription-mediated amplification assay (TMA), the BD ProbeTec ET amplified DNA strand displacement assay (SDA), and the Roche Cobas Amplicor PCR was defined by using a rotating ""gold standard"" of any positive results by two or three of the three tests that excluded the test being evaluated. A total of 961 evaluable test sets were collected. On the basis of a rotating gold standard of positive results by two of three comparator tests, the sensitivity and the specificity were as follows: culture for N. gonorrhoeae, 50.0% and 99.4%, respectively; PCR, 80.3% and 73.0%, respectively; TMA, 83.6% and 98.6%, respectively; and SDA, 93.2% and 96.3%, respectively. On the basis of a rotating gold standard of positive results by three of three comparator tests, the sensitivity and specificity were as follows: culture for N. gonorrhoeae, 65.4% and 99.0%, respectively; PCR, 91.9% and 71.8%, respectively; TMA, 100% and 96.2%, respectively; and SDA, 97.1% and 94.2%, respectively. In conclusion, currently available NAATs are more sensitive than culture for the detection of pharyngeal gonorrhea in at-risk patients. PCR is substantially less specific than culture, TMA, or SDA and should not be used for the detection of pharyngeal gonorrhea."

As with most respiratory pathogens, rapid, sensitive, and specific diagnostic tests are not available; thus, early in the course of illness, diagnosis of S. pneumoniae infection is usually presumptive, and the choice of antimicrobial therapy is nearly always empiric. In the past, isolates of S. pneumoniae were uniformly susceptible to penicillin; however, penicillin-resistant and multidrug-resistant strains have begin to emerge in the United States and are widespread in some communities. The full impact of the problem is unknown because infection with drug-resistant S. pneumoniae (DRSP) is not a reportable condition for most of the United States. To develop a strategy for minimizing the impact of DRSP, in June 1994, CDC convened a working group of public health practitioners, clinical laboratorians, health-care providers, and representatives of key professional societies.

Established typing methods define most M1 isolates as members of a clone that has a worldwide distribution and that is strongly associated with invasive diseases. FAFLP analysis simultaneously sampled 90 to 120 loci throughout the M1 genome. Its discriminatory power, precision, and reproducibility were compared with those of other molecular typing methods. Irrespective of disease symptomatology or geographic origin, the majority of the clinical M1 isolates shared a single ribotype, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis macrorestriction profile, and emm1 gene sequence. Nonetheless, among these isolates, FAFLP analysis could differentiate 17 distinct profiles, including seven multi-isolate groups. The FAFLP profiles of M1 isolates reproducibly exhibited between 1 and more than 20 amplified fragment differences. The high discriminatory power of genotyping by FAFLP analysis revealed genetic microheterogeneity and differentiated otherwise ""identical"" M1 isolates as members of a clone complex."

Specimens from 953 children ranging in age from 4 months to 18 years were inoculated to selective blood agar plates containing sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim. Culture plates were incubated anaerobically for the first overnight period and aerobically in the presence of 10% CO2 for the second overnight period. The same specimens were tested within 24 h by DAS (phase 1) or CBTMSI (phase 2). One hundred thirty-five of 538 specimens (25.1%) tested by DAS and 150 of 415 specimens (36.1%) tested by CBTMSI were culture positive. DAS detected 87 of 135 (64.4%) and CBTMSI detected 93 of 150 (62.0%) culture-positive specimens. The specificities of DAS and CBTMSI were 96.5 and 99.6%, respectively. The predictive values of positive and negative results were 86.1 and 89.0% for DAS and 98.9 and 82.2% for CBTMSI.

CD010502,0,9524835,0,Varying titers of neutralizing antibodies to streptococcal superantigens in different preparations of normal polyspecific immunoglobulin G: implications for therapeutic efficacy.,"Inasmuch as normal intravenous polyspecific immunoglobulin G (IVIG) neutralizes the activity of a wide spectrum of superantigens, it may be an efficient adjunctive therapy for diseases associated with superantigen-producing organisms, including severe group A streptococcal diseases. The neutralizing activity against purified superantigens, streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins (Spe), and a mixture of superantigens present in culture supernatant of clinical group A streptococcal isolates was determined for five IVIG preparations. A significant variation among different IVIG preparations (P < .05) and different lots of the same IVIG brand (P < .044) was found. Neutralization of SpeA activity was significantly lower than that of other streptococcal superantigens (P < .05); however, there was no correlation between SpeA binding and SpeA neutralizing activity in different IVIGs. Plasma samples obtained from patients after IVIG infusion varied in their titers of neutralizing antibodies to culture supernatants prepared from their respective isolates, and this variation paralleled differences in the neutralizing titer of the IVIG lot administered to each patient studied. The study suggests that complete neutralizing activity may be achieved by optimizing the type and/or dose of IVIG used in treatment."

Throat swabs were taken in duplicate and rapid tests performed on one swab and culture on the other. Both latex agglutination and antibody capture assays showed a sensitivity of 100 per cent and specificity of > 98 per cent as compared to culture and isolation in symptomatic patients. However, among asymptomatic carriers sensitivity of 100 per cent and 87.5 per cent and specificity > 95 per cent were observed for latex agglutination and antibody capture assays respectively.

CD010502,0,1684795,0,Molecular analysis of pyrogenic exotoxins from Streptococcus pyogenes isolates associated with toxic shock-like syndrome.,"Toxic shock-like syndrome (TSLS) is characterized by hypotension or shock, fever, multiorgan system involvement, and a concurrent group A streptococcal infection. We analyzed 34 streptococcal strains isolated from patients with clinically well-documented TSLS for their pyrogenic toxin profiles and M-protein types. Although strains of nine different M types were represented in the sample, 74% of the isolates were of either M type 1 or 3. It was determined that 53% produced streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin type A under in vitro growth conditions and that 85% contained the gene encoding this toxin. These values are in contrast to the published value of 15% for the incidence of this gene in a sample of general group A streptococcal isolates. As has been found with all group A streptococci examined to date, regardless of disease association, 100% of TSLS-associated isolates contained the gene encoding pyrogenic exotoxin type B. This toxin was detectably produced by 59% of isolates. The gene encoding pyrogenic toxin type C was found in only 21% of isolates. We conclude that the pyrogenic exotoxin type A gene is associated with group A streptococcal strains isolated from patients with TSLS and may play a causative role in this illness. However, other factors are also likely to be important, since not all strains from patients with TSLS contained the A toxin gene."
CD010502,0,11786423,0,Induction of myocarditis and valvulitis in lewis rats by different epitopes of cardiac myosin and its implications in rheumatic carditis.,"Immune responses against cardiac myosin and group A streptococcal M protein have been implicated in the pathogenesis of rheumatic heart disease. Although cardiac myosin is known to produce myocarditis in susceptible animals, it has never been investigated for its role in production of valvular heart disease, the most serious sequelae of group A streptococcal infection in acute rheumatic fever. In our study, cardiac myosin induced valvulitis in the Lewis rat, and epitopes responsible for production of valvulitis were located in the rod region. Human and rat cardiac myosins induced severe myocarditis in the Lewis rats as expected. A purified S2 fragment (amino acid sequences 842 to 1295) produced the most severe myocarditis as well as valvulitis. Different regions of light meromyosin produced valvulitis (residues 1685 to 1936) or myocarditis (residues 1529 to 1611). Because streptococcal M proteins produced valvular heart disease in Lewis rats and have been linked to anti-cardiac myosin responses, we reacted myosin-sensitized lymphocytes isolated from the hearts of Lewis rats with peptides of streptococcal M5 protein in tritiated thymidine assays. Infiltrating lymphocytes responded most strongly to peptides within the B repeat region of streptococcal M protein. These data show direct evidence that immune responses against cardiac myosin lead to valvular heart disease and the infiltration of the heart by streptococcal M protein reactive T lymphocytes."

CD010502,0,9274026,0,Efficient secretion of the model antigen M6-gp41E in Lactobacillus plantarum NCIMB 8826.,"Four Lactobacillus strains (Lb. plantarum NCIMB 8826, Lb. paracasei LbTGS1.4, Lb. casei ATCC 393 and Lb. fermentum KLD) were tested for their ability to produce and secrete heterologous proteins. These strains were first screened with an alpha-amylase reporter under the control of a set of expression or expression/secretion signals from various lactic acid bacteria. With most of the constructions tested, the level of extracellular production was highest in Lb. plantarum NCIMB 8826, and lowest in Lb. paracasei LbTGS1.4. These two strains were next assayed using a model antigen consisting of the N-terminal part of the M6 protein from Streptococcus pyogenes fused to the linear epitope ELDKWAS from human immunodeficiency virus gp41 protein. Secretion of this heterologous protein was inefficient in Lb. paracasei LbTGS1.4, which accumulated a large intracellular pool of the unprocessed precursor, whereas Lb. plantarum NCIMB 8826 was able to secrete the antigen to a level as high as 10 mg l-1."

Throat culture results showed the mean sensitivity, specificity and predictive value of a positive Gram-stained smear of pharyngeal secretions as 70%, 89% and 69%.

CD010502,0,3931060,0,Management of streptococcal pharyngitis reconsidered.,"Adequate treatment of GABHS pharyngitis with penicillin shortens the course of illness, reduces the spread of streptococci and prevents suppurative complications. It has also been a major factor in the markedly accelerated decline in the incidence of acute rheumatic fever in this country. Difficulties in the clinical diagnosis of GABHS pharyngitis make bacteriologic confirmation highly desirable. Currently a properly performed throat culture is the best way to obtain this bacteriologic confirmation. However, it is possible that rapid antigen detection tests will replace the throat culture in the future. These diagnostic tools should be used more selectively and only in conjunction with clinical and epidemiologic data. Greater selectivity will help control costs and will increase the chances of identifying patients who are truly infected and are not merely streptococcal carriers. Penicillin is still the drug of choice and an oral preparation given twice daily is as effective as more frequent doses. Patients at risk for noncompliance should be treated with a single injection of benzathine penicillin combined with procaine penicillin to lessen the local discomfort. Routine follow-up cultures of asymptomatic patients should be abandoned. Persistence of GABHS following a course of treatment may no longer be an important risk factor for the development of rheumatic fever. However, there are exceptional cases, as noted in the text, in which eradication of GABHS carriage with a short course of rifampicin may be desirable."
CD010502,0,15004185,0,Streptococcal M5 protein prevents neutrophil phagocytosis by interfering with CD11b/CD18 receptor-mediated association and signaling.,"Group A streptococci (GAS) are common human pathogens that express major surface-associated virulence factors designated M proteins. In this study, we explored directly the cellular mechanisms behind their supposed ability to prevent phagocytosis. Isolated human neutrophils killed an M-negative GAS mutant (DeltaM5), but not the wild-type parent strain (M5). After 3 h, 3-4 times as many DeltaM5 as M5 bacteria were associated with the neutrophils, and more DeltaM5 than M5 bacteria were ingested. However, there was no statistically significant difference between DeltaM5 and M5 bacteria in regard to the percentage of the neutrophil-associated bacteria that were ingested, indicating that M5 protein prevents an adhesion receptor-dependent association with neutrophils and not the phagocytic machinery per se. Different Abs against CD11b/CD18 (CR3) blocked adhesion and killing of DeltaM5 bacteria, whereas the blocking of two other complement receptors, CD11c/CD18 (CR4) and CD35 (CR1), did not. The CD11b/CD18-mediated killing of DeltaM5 bacteria resulted in protein tyrosine phosphorylations and Cdc42 activation. Furthermore, inhibition of CD11b/CD18 receptor engagement or tyrosine kinase activity blocked the DeltaM5-induced activation of Cdc42 as well as the killing of these bacteria. We conclude that M5 protein interferes with the CD11b/CD18-dependent association between GAS and neutrophils, and thereby blocks subsequent ingestion of the bacteria."

Antibody titers to the three organisms were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in the 31 patients, as well as in 32 control patients who had not suffered from recurrent tonsillitis. None of the individuals in either group suffered from periodontal or dental illness. Significantly higher antibody levels to P intermedia were found in the study group as compared to controls (median 91.0 versus 72.5; p = .02). In contrast, the antibody titers to the other two organisms were generally low (less than 0.30), and no difference was found among the two study groups. The elevated antibody levels to P intermedia, a known oral pathogen that is also isolated from most recurrently inflamed tonsils, suggest a pathogenic role for this organism in recurrent tonsillitis."

CD010502,0,19897695,0,Role of non-group a streptococci in acute pharyngitis.,"The role of non-group A streptococci (non-GAS) as pathogens of acute pharyngitis is controversial. Data are limited and conflicting on whether these bacteria are true pathogens of pharyngitis and whether treatment is indicated in all cases or just select cases. However, non-GAS are well-documented as being pathogens of other diseases, including neonatal sepsis, pneumonia, endocarditis, and urinary tract infections. If non-GAS are pathogens of acute pharyngitis, treatment may speed recovery as well as prevent complications. The objective of this study was to determine whether, in cases of pharyngitis in which non-GAS is identified on culture, the clinical signs and symptoms resemble those of group A streptococcal pharyngitis thus implicating them as true pathogens or if they resemble culture-negative pharyngitis, suggesting these cases are viral in etiology."
CD010502,0,18710861,0,Shr is a broad-spectrum surface receptor that contributes to adherence and virulence in group A streptococcus.,"Group A streptococcus (GAS) is a common hemolytic pathogen that produces a range of suppurative infections and autoimmune sequelae in humans. Shr is an exported protein in GAS, which binds in vitro to hemoglobin, myoglobin, and the hemoglobin-haptoglobin complex. We previously reported that Shr is found in association with whole GAS cells and in culture supernatant. Here, we demonstrate that cell-associated Shr could not be released from the bacteria by the muralytic enzyme mutanolysin and was instead localized to the membrane. Shr was available, however, on the exterior of GAS, exposed to the extracellular environment. In vitro binding and competition assays demonstrated that in addition to hemoprotein binding, purified Shr specifically interacts with immobilized fibronectin and laminin. The absence of typical fibronectin-binding motifs indicates that a new protein pattern is involved in the binding of Shr to the extracellular matrix. Recombinant Lactococcus lactis cells expressing Shr on the bacterial surface gained the ability to bind to immobilized fibronectin, suggesting that Shr can function as an adhesin. The inactivation of shr resulted in a 40% reduction in the attachment to human epithelial cells in comparison to the parent strain. GAS infection elicited a high titer of Shr antibodies in sera from convalescent mice, demonstrating that Shr is expressed in vivo. The shr mutant was attenuated for virulence in an intramuscular zebrafish model system. In summary, this study identifies Shr as being a new microbial surface component recognizing adhesive matrix molecules in GAS that mediates attachment to epithelial cells and contributes to the infection process."
CD010502,0,2776849,0,Occupational exposure to Streptococcus suis type 2.,"Antibody titres to Streptococcus suis type 2 were measured with an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in four occupational groups in New Zealand. No veterinary students, 9% of dairy farmers, 10% of meat inspectors and 21% of pig farmers were seropositive to S. suis type 2. The development of antibody to S. suis type 2 was associated with occupational contact with pigs or their meat products. Subclinical infection with S. suis type 2 appears to occur in humans and the antibody produced is of only short duration. The annual incidence of subclinical infection and seroconversion in pig farmers may approach 28%. Thus S. suis type 2 may be one of the most infectious potentially zoonotic agents present in New Zealand, although very rarely resulting in clinical disease."

Most tests in routine use are haematology or biochemistry tests that are of low complexity. Microbiology POCT has been constrained by a lack of tests that are both accurate and of low complexity. We describe our experience of the practical issues around using more complex POCT for detection of Group B streptococci (GBS) in swabs from labouring women. We evaluated two tests for their feasibility in POCT: an optical immune assay (Biostar OIA Strep B, Inverness Medical, Princetown, NJ) and a PCR (IDI-Strep B, Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA), which have been categorised as being of moderate and high complexity, respectively. A total of 12 unqualified midwifery assistants (MA) were trained to undertake testing on the delivery suite. A systematic approach to the introduction and management of POC testing was used. Modelling showed that the probability of test results being available within a clinically useful timescale was high. However, in the clinical setting, we found it impossible to maintain reliable availability of trained testers. Implementation of more complex POC testing is technically feasible, but it is expensive, and may be difficult to achieve in a busy delivery suite."

Group M streptococci have not been proposed as a species to date. Four strains of the group M streptococci isolated from dog were located within the pyogenic group of the genus Streptococcus on 16S rRNA gene-based phylogenetic analysis; the group M strains were located a short distance away from all other members of the group. The homology values of 16S rRNA gene sequences between group M strains and all other streptococci were<95.6%. Group M strains exhibited low levels of DNA-DNA homology to other streptococcal species. Some biochemical traits, such as β-galactosidase activity and acid production from glycogen, could distinguish these group M strains from other closely related species. Thus, these strains are proposed to constitute a new species -Streptococcus fryi sp. nov. The type strain is PAGU 653(T) (=NCTC 10235(T)=JCM 16387(T))."

The serum concentrations of the IgA, IgG and IgM classes were measured by single radial immunodiffusion. When compared with sex- and age-matched controls, the concentrations of serum IgA (but not of IgG or IgM) were significantly increased in the three groups studied. The titers of ASO of the IgA and IgM classes, and those of ASP of the IgA and IgG classes, were significantly increased in Group A. In Group B, only the ASP titers of the IgA class were significantly increased. No significant difference was noted in the titers of either ASO or ASP of any class in Group C. Thus, increased antibody response in IgA nephropathy is not restricted to IgA. Anaphylactoid purpura with or without renal disease appears to be different in its humoral anti-streptococcal response from IgA nephropathy."

We investigated the effects of low-dose MTX on antigen-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells and explored through which cellular pathways these effects are mediated. We show that MTX caused a dose-dependent suppression of T cell activation and adhesion molecule expression, and this was not due to lymphocyte apoptosis. The suppression of intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 was adenosine and folate-dependent, while MTX suppression of the skin-homing cutaneous lymphocyte-associated antigen (CLA) was adenosine-independent. The effect of MTX on CLA, but not ICAM-1, required the constant presence of MTX in cultures. Thus, the suppression of T cell activation and T cell adhesion molecule expression, rather than apoptosis, mediated in part by adenosine or polyglutamated MTX or both, are important mechanisms in the anti-inflammatory action of MTX."

Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support may successfully rescue these severely ill patients. Here, we report the first case of severe novel H1N1 infection with multiorgan failure that was successfully treated with antiviral therapy and ECMO in Taiwan. A 32-year-old man had acute onset of fever, dry cough, rhinorrhea, and sore throat 2 days after returning from Dongguan, China. He attended Hospital A and chest radiography revealed bilateral lung consolidation. Rapid influenza antigen testing was negative. He was intubated 2 days later due to hypoxic respiratory failure and persistent shock refractory to conventional management. Because of compromised cardiopulmonary function, venoarterial ECMO support was started 4 days after the onset of symptoms and he was transferred to Hospital B on July 25, 2009. As history taking found clustering of influenza-like illness, oseltamivir was given immediately under the impression of severe influenza illness. Real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction of respiratory sample for novel H1N1 virus revealed positive results. In addition, blood cultures collected at Hospital A yielded Streptococcus pneumoniae, and beta-hemolytic Streptococcus other than group A, B or D. Hospital course was uneventful and he was discharged 26 days after transfer to Hospital B. This experience showed that ECMO can be life-saving for severe novel H1N1 infection."

It was identified according to the genotype using labeled hybridization probes complementary to six sequences of cagA and vacA genes. Different types of strains were found in isolates from gastrointestinal tract and patients suffering from thyroiditis. Six out of seven genotyped isolates from patients in our Department of Otorhinolaryngology and Head and Neck Surgery exhibited the same genotype, differing from isolates obtained from other patients; the 7th isolate originated from a patient who had undergone surgery for deviatio septi nasi, at the same time suffering from autoimmune thyroiditis, having confirmed gastric infection by H. pylori from biopsy. This data made it possible to formulate the hypothesis on probable association of specific H. pylori genotype with chronic tonsillitis and tonsillar cancer. We assessed commercial transport media and improved nucleic acid isolation techniques and the RT-PCR-based tests, which allowed us to skip a culture step and to test directly the patients' samples; however, for full confirmation of our hypothesis and explanation of possible mechanisms of the contribution of Helicobacter sp. to the pathogenesis of the disease further data are to be collected and evaluated."
CD010502,0,12695119,0,Dextran-binding human plasma antibody recognizes bacterial and yeast antigens and is inhibited by glucose concentrations reached in diabetic sera.,"Dextran-binding antibody was isolated in high yield from plasma of all 40 blood donors screened in a South Indian population. The antibody was purified by a single step affinity chromatography on Sephadex G100 using 1-O-methyl alpha-D-glucoside as eluant. Analysis of protein peaks obtained in size exclusion high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) revealed dominance of IgG and suggested the presence of polymeric IgA in this antibody. Methyl and para-nitrophenyl alpha-D-glucosides, in contrast to their beta-anomers, were very efficient inhibitors of binding of this antibody to dextran. Galactose and glucose were equally good inhibitors. Among disaccharide inhibitors sucrose was more efficient than maltose or melibiose. Hemoglobin artificially glycosylated to contain covalently-linked glucose or alpha-anomeric galactose was sugar-specifically recognized by this antibody. Galactose moieties in glycoproteins or polysaccharides were, however, not recognized. The dextran-binding antibody bound sugar-specifically to glycoconjugates from yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and to lipopolysaccharides from Klebsiella and group A Streptococci, but not to lipopolysaccharides from E. coli. Inhibition studies suggested glucose moiety with unsubstituted C2 and C4 and alpha-anomeric C1 as ideal for recognition by the dextran-binding antibody. Concentration of glucose required for 50% inhibition of binding of the purified antibody to polystyrene-coated dextran in phosphate buffered saline was above the glucose concentrations in normal sera, but well below those reached in diabetic sera. Binding of the antibody from dialysed plasma to immobilized dextran was lowered only marginally in presence of glucose at 4.5mM (which nears normal serum glucose concentrations), but substantially in presence of the sugar at 20mM and above which are reached in diabetic sera. If verified in vivo, inhibition of this antibody by high serum glucose may possibly be among reasons for the increased susceptibility of diabetics to infection."
CD010502,0,11901812,0,Molecular methods for rapid detection of group B streptococci.,"Group B streptococci (GBS) are an important cause of neonatal sepsis and meningitis. Implementation of selective intrapartum chemoprophylaxis based on either a screening-based approach or a risk-based approach has led to a substantial decrease in the morbidity and mortality of GBS disease. Current 'gold-standard' detection methods for GBS are selective broth cultures of combined vaginal and anal specimens collected at 35-37 week's gestation. Rapid immunological detection methods, including latex agglutination test, enzyme immunoassay and optical immunoassay, as well as hybridization-based test, are available. These methods are useful in rapid identification of heavily colonized women, but are unable to detect light GBS colonization due to poor sensitivity. Recent development of real-time PCR and fluorescence labeling technologies has provided new detection platforms for bacterial identification. GBS-specific PCR assays using these new technologies offer promising tools for sensitive and specific detection of GBS directly from clinical specimens. The application of these assays in the current prevention strategy will simplify the prevention practice and rationalize antibiotic use."

In some cases, antibodies developed against M proteins are cross-reactive with host tissue and have been implicated in rheumatic fever. Peptide fragments of several serotypes, namely type 24, 5 and 6 M proteins were chemically synthesized and tested for their ability to induce protective and tissue cross-reactive antibodies in rabbits. Two synthetic 35 residue peptides of type 24 M protein, S-CB3 and S-CB7 had previously been shown to evoke high ELISA titers as well as opsonic antibody titers in each of three rabbits. Neither contained host tissue cross-reactive antibodies when examined with human heart tissue. Subpeptides of CB7 were synthesized to identify the smallest protective epitope. Three synthetic subpeptides (S-CB7-(13-35), - (18-35) and - (23-35) C were covalently linked to tetanus toxoid and evoked opsonic antibodies in rabbits and thus protective immunity with no tissue cross-reactive epitopes.

This study was designed to analyse the presence of IgG anti-heart antibodies in sera from patients suffering from hypertrophic and dilatative forms of CMP as well as from patients with ischaemic heart disease and healthy individuals. Patients' sera were analysed for IgG reactivity to Western-blotted extracts prepared from human epithelial and endothelial cells, heart and skeletal muscle specimens as well as from Streptococcus pyogenes. The IgG subclass (IgG1-4) reactivity to purified human cardiac myosin was analysed by ELISA. While sera from CMP patients and healthy individuals displayed comparable IgG reactivity to a variety of human proteins, cardiac myosin represented the prominent antigen detected strongly and preferentially by sera from CMP patients. Pronounced IgG anti-cardiac myosin reactivity was frequently found in sera from patients with dilatative CMP and reduced ventricular function. ELISA analyses revealed a prominent IgG2/IgG3 anti-cardiac myosin reactivity in CMP sera, indicating a preferential Th1-like immune response. Elevated anti-cytomegalovirus, anti-enterovirus IgG titres as well as IgG reactivity to nitrocellulose-blotted S. pyogenes proteins were also frequently observed in the group of CMP patients. If further work can support the hypothesis that autoreactivity to cardiac myosin represents a pathogenic factor in CMP, specific immunomodulation of this Th1- towards a Th2-like immune response may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for CMP."

Although various antibiotics including penicillin are effective, antibiotic treatment failure in cases of streptococcal pharyngitis have been reported. Herein, we investigated mechanisms associated with recurrent streptococcal pharyngitis. Clinically isolated S. pyogenes strains showed serotype-specific features, with emm12 strains most frequently detected and emm6 strains more likely to produce biofilm. The architectures of formed biofilms were observed using a fluorescence microscope with Live/Dead staining. Furthermore, various cationic antimicrobial peptides were tested to evaluate their inhibitory activities toward biofilms formed by S. pyogenes. After treatments with high concentrations of antibiotics, S. pyogenes survived in biofilm even when dead bacterial cells covered the surface. Other findings demonstrated that some antimicrobial peptides have inhibitory effects on forming and formed biofilm. Moreover, emm4, emm6, and emm75 strains showed significantly higher levels of invasion capacity into Detroit 562 cells than strains with other genotypes. Additionally, more than half of the strains temporarily escaped killing by penicillin alone by internalization into epithelial cells, even when the antibiotic concentration used was greater than the 10-fold minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for planktonic S. pyogenes. Also, combined administrations of multiple antibiotics were more effective to eradicate strains more likely to be internalized. Finally, flow cytometric analyses demonstrated that emm12 strains with higher invasive capabilities expressed PrtF1 protein on the bacterial surface. These findings suggest that S. pyogenes isolated from patients with recurrent streptococcal pharyngitis have emm type-specific features that allow escape from eradication by antibiotics."

The stimulation resulted in a bacteriostatic effect, was non-type-specific and improved microphage potential to inactivate streptococci opsonized with anti-M antibodies in low titre. The microphages pre-exposed to anti-M sera remained unaffected, the effect was non-species-specific and nontype-specific and the stimulation resulted from the action of albumin fraction exoproducts. This seems to suggest that human mediators (lymphokines) may promote the activity of phagocytes. The cell-mediated immunity appears thus to have protective features even in the case of streptococci which are the typical extracellular parasites. The drawbacks of the model used, which make it difficult to quantify the found mechanism under in vivo conditions, are discussed in detail."

CD010502,0,9198283,0,M protein mediated adhesion of M type 24 Streptococcus pyogenes stimulates release of interleukin-6 by HEp-2 tissue culture cells.,"We investigated the contributions of lipoteichoic acid and M protein to reversible and irreversible adhesion of group A streptococci and the effects of such adhesion on release of interleukin-6. Streptococci in which lipoteichoic acid was masked by the hyaluronate capsule were readily washed from HEp-2 cells, indicating no attachment. Unencapsulated, M-negative streptococci in which lipoteichoic acid was exposed were removed more slowly, indicating loose attachment. Only unencapsulated streptococci that expressed both lipoteichoic acid and M protein remained stably adherent to HEp-2 cells throughout multiple washes. Streptococci expressing both M protein and lipoteichoic acid induced release of interleukin-6 from HEp-2 cells, whereas an isogenic, M-negative mutant failed to induce release of interleukin-6. These data suggest that lipoteichoic acid mediates reversible adhesion and that M protein is required for irreversible adhesion and for inducing release of interleukin-6 from HEp-2 cells."

Severe depression of these antibody titers was found in almost all patients with this disease not only during the presence of a nephrotic syndrome but for long periods up to 20 years following an episode of a nephrotic syndrome when the patients were in complete remission. Patients with a nephrotic syndrome due to chronic glomerulonephritis (5), S.L.E. (4), membranous nephropathy (5), diabetes mellitus (1) or amyloidosis (1) did not show abnormally low values for antibodies to Endostreptosin, Streptolysin O or Streptozyme.

Therapy with intravenous gamma-globulin (IVGG) results in rapid defervescence, disappearance of signs and symptoms of inflammation and prevention of coronary artery aneurysms. We hypothesized that IVGG might neutralize a bacterial toxin produced by a staphylococcus or streptococcus present in the nasopharynx. We further speculated that this toxin might be detectable in serum or urine of patients. The goal of this work was to identify microbial antigens in different materials taken from patients with a clinical diagnosis of KS. We tested 23 aerobic bacterial isolates from throat cultures from 15 patients with KS, acute serum from 121 patients and 38 acute urine specimens from patients with KS. The patients ranged in age from 1 to 6 years. Specimens were tested in a standard system of counterimmunoelectrophoresis and reacted against IVGG prepared in a 25% solution. Ten of 23 aerobic bacteria (43.5%) isolated from throat cultures demonstrated a precipitation reaction with IVGG. Counterimmunoelectrophoresis testing of IVGG against acute serum and acute urine specimens was uniformly negative. IVGG contains precipitating antibody against a limited number of aerobic throat organisms. It is possible that antigenic products of one of these bacteria may be involved in the pathogenesis of KS."

By means of the former technique a greater correlation was observed between surface hydrophobicity and production of M protein (above all in stationary phase of bacteria). Using the latter one, we noted differences depending on the growth phase, but not related to M protein. The pretreatment of bacteria with subCMI of clindamycin decreases their hydrophobicity, particularly in M+ strains and in stationary phase of growth. Less variations of surface were observed in M- strains and after treatment with subCMI of imipenem."

M proteins from partially purified bacteriophage lysates displayed precipitin lines of identity with a purified peptic extract of type 5 M protein (pep M5) in immunodiffusion assays. Immunoblot analyses of the M protein-positive lysates demonstrated that the cloned M protein component resided in five polypeptides with relative molecular weights of 57,900 (57.9K), 55.4K, 52.9K, 40.0K, and 32.6K. The hybrid lambda phage (lambda M5)-produced M protein contained immunoprotective epitopes; lambda M5 protein inhibited opsonization of type 5 streptococci by pep M5 antibodies, and antiserum raised against lambda M5 lysates opsonized type 5 streptococci. Each of the five antigenic polypeptides of the recombinant phage M protein also shared epitopes with human heart tissue, as demonstrated by the reactivity of immunoblots of lambda M5 antigens separated on sodium dodecyl sulfate gels with anti-pep M5 antibodies absorbed to and eluted from human heart sarcolemmal membranes. Moreover, antiserum raised against the lambda M5 lysates reacted with sarcolemmal membrane proteins with relative molecular weights of 200K, 59K, 55K, 53K, and 27K as determined by immunoblot analyses. These results demonstrate that the structural gene coding for type 5 streptococcal M protein which was inserted into lambda DNA expresses immunoprotective epitopes, some of which are shared with human heart tissue."

CD010502,0,7014632,0,Potentiation of opsonization and phagocytosis of Streptococcus pyogenes following growth in the presence of clindamycin.,"Streptococcus pyogenes, bearing M-protein on its surface, resists opsonization by normal human serum and subsequent phagocytosis by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Previous studies have shown that M-protein positive organisms are poorly opsonized by the alternate pathway of complement. In an attempt to define further the role of the surface components of S. pyogenes in this process, we examined the ability of clindamycin, an antibiotic that inhibits protein biosynthesis, to alter bacterial opsonization. An M-protein positive strain of S. pyogenes was grown in varying concentrations of clindamycin at levels lower than those which inhibited growth, i.e., at levels less than the minimal inhibitory concentration. These bacteria were incubated with purified human polymorphonuclear leukocytes and peripheral blood monocytes. Significant enhancement of bacterial opsonization, phagocytosis, and killing resulted. Measurement of complement consumption and binding of the third component of complement (C3) onto the bacterial surface demonstrated that organisms grown in the presence of clindamycin activated complement more readily and fixed more C3 on their surface. Electron microscopy revealed the probable basis for these findings. Streptococci exposed to clindamycin during growth were largely denuded of surface ""fuzz,"" the hairlike structures bearing M-protein. We conclude that the incorporation of clindamycin at concentrations that fail to inhibit growth of S. pyogenes nevertheless causes significant changes in the capacity of these bacteria to resist opsonization by serum complement. These findings support the hypothesis that M-protein inhibits bacterial opsonization by interfering with effective complement activation on the bacterial surface."

A truly rapid diagnostic test for identifying GBS would allow for more timely initiation of antibiotic prophylaxis and also reduce the administration of antibiotics for the prevention of early onset neonatal GBS infection. A stock culture was formed from a laboratory reference strain of GBS and was diluted from 10 (7) to 10 (1) bacteria/mL. Specific concentrations were used to inoculate nitrocellulose membranes (NCMs) that had been coated previously with polyclonal rabbit antibody against GBS. After specific times, the NCMs were removed from the sheep blood agar medium, and horseradish-peroxidase conjugate polyclonal antibody against GBS was added. Bound antibody was detected with diaminobenzidine. After 6 hours of incubation, GBS was detected at concentrations from 10 (7) through 10 (4) bacterial/mL. After 4 hours of incubation, GBS was detected at concentrations from 10 (7) through 10 (5) bacteria/mL. GBS was not detected at 2 hours of incubation. Rapid growth and detection of GBS can be performed, and the results can be reliably attained as early as 4 hours. This is in marked contrast to the 48 to 72 hours required by current methods."

Despite obtaining specimens from multiple sites for culture and using antigen detection tests only 64% of patients had an etiologic agent determined. Haemophilus influenzae type b was the most common causative agent identified and 82% of such cases occurred in children between 6 and 24 months of age. Infection due to Staphylococcus aureus was not confined to any age group. Results of laboratory tests which measure inflammatory response were not always abnormal. Platelet count and sedimentation rate frequently rose as clinical improvement occurred. Roentgenograms and radionuclide studies were of little benefit. Therapy included immediate decompression of the joint space, articular rest and use of antibiotics delivered parenterally. Ninety percent of 70 patients who were followed for 1 month to 5 years (mean, 15.5 months) were cured. Eight children had clinically significant sequelae which affected length of extremity, stability of articulations and range of movement.

Mean antibody activity, measured in arbitrary units, was of 184 U in JAS and 250 U in chronic iridocyclitis (p = NS). The results in both groups differed significantly from those found in healthy children (p less than 0.001 and p less than 0.01, respectively).

For practical purposes, these children can be divided into four main clinical categories: (1) a relatively large group of children with recurrent ear-nose and throat and lower respiratory tract infections, in some cases caused by deficiencies of antibodies or complement; (2) children with failure to thrive, intractable diarrhoea or an opportunistic infection which can be caused by a T-lymphocyte or combined immunodeficiency; (3) children with infections with pyogenic bacteria or fungi as seen in case of granulocyte/monocyte function deficiency; and (4) a small heterogeneous group of children with recurrence of particular infections. Also, acquired immunodeficiency becomes a more common problem in paediatric practice. Flow cytometric immunophenotyping of leucocytes appears to be an efficient and rapid tool in the diagnosis and follow-up of immunodeficient patients, supporting early recognition, before serious infections have compromised the child's general condition. This technique can now be performed in many hospitals. In this review, we give directions for the use of flow cytometric immunophenotyping of leucocytes in the diagnosis and follow-up of immunodeficient children according to the four main clinical categories."

CD010502,0,7515336,0,The presence of peptidoglycan-polysaccharide complexes in the bowel wall and the cellular responses to these complexes in Crohn's disease.,"Interestingly, using a monoclonal antibody, peptidoglycan-polysaccharide complexes (PPC) were detected intracellularly in the mucosa and submucosa of the bowel wall of Crohn's disease (CD) patients. PPC are the main constituents of the gram-positive bacterial cell wall. These PPC were however detected in the normal bowel wall also. Therefore, in this study the hypothesis that an enhanced immune responsiveness to bacterial antigens plays a pivotal role in the induction or the chronicity of CD was tested. As antigens, the peptidoglycan structures of intestinal bacteria (Eubacterium aerofaciens or fecal PPC) or of Streptococcus pyogenes, the 65-kDa heat shock protein and muramyl dipeptide (MDP), the smallest bioactive subunit of peptidoglycan, were used. The proliferative responses of peripheral blood (PB) mononuclear cells (MNC) of healthy subjects and patients in a remissive stage of CD or an active CD stage were examined. Of this last patient group the MNC responses of the mesenterial lymph nodes that drain the inflamed gut area were measured also. The responses of PB-MNC of the healthy subjects and the patients in a remissive CD stage were not different. Compared to the responses in remissive CD, the PB-MNC responses in active CD to the eubacterial cell wall and streptococcal cell wall antigen were significantly higher. At the inflammation site in active CD, the lymph nodes, the responses to most of the bacterial antigens were significantly higher than in the PB. In summary, the results show the presence of bacterial peptidoglycan in the bowel wall and the immune responsiveness, especially at the inflammation site, to these antigens in active CD and therefore present suggestive evidence for the role of peptidoglycan in the etiology and/or pathogenesis of CD."

Few, if any, PCNA+ cells were observed in normal glomeruli, but many cells were positive for PCNA in the acute phase of APSGN. Glomerular PCNA+ cells were observed either within glomerular tufts, or lining Bowman's capsule (parietal epithelial cells); the number of positive cells tended to decrease exponentially as the disease duration increased (r = -0.91, P < 0.0001). PCNA+ cells within glomerular tufts were further identified by double immunostaining. PCNA was not found in PMN or T cells, but a small proportion of macrophages were PCNA+. Most of the remaining PCNA+ cells were resident glomerular cells; the proportion of PCNA+ endothelial cells (CD31+) was over 80 per cent in the early phase, but as the disease continued the proportion of mesangial cells (alpha-smooth muscle actin+) increased to about half of the total PCNA+ cells within the tuft. These data indicate that the hypercellular glomeruli in APSGN are due not only to immune cell infiltration, but also to resident glomerular cell proliferation, probably induced by locally produced growth factors."
CD010502,0,3287371,0,Conformational characteristics of the complete sequence of group A streptococcal M6 protein.,"M protein is considered a virulence determinant on the streptococcal cell wall by virtue of its ability to allow the organism to resist attack by human neutrophils. The complete DNA sequence of the M6 gene from streptococcal strain D471 has allowed, for the first time, the study of the structural characteristics of the amino acid sequence of an entire M protein molecule. Predictive secondary structural analysis revealed that the majority of this fibrillar molecule exhibits strong alpha-helical potential and that, except for the ends, nonpolar residues in the central region of the molecule exhibit the 7-residue periodicity typical for coiled-coil proteins. Differences in this heptad pattern of nonpolar residues allow this central rod region to be divided into three subdomains which correlate essentially with the repeat regions A, B, and C/D in the M6 protein sequence. Alignment of the N-terminal half of the M6 sequence with PepM5, the N-terminal half of the M5 protein, revealed that 42% of the amino acids were identical. The majority of the identities were ""core"" nonpolar residues of the heptad periodicity which are necessary for the maintenance of the coiled coil. Thus, conservation of structure in a sequence-variable region of these molecules may be biologically significant. Results suggest that serologically different M proteins may be built according to a basic scheme: an extended central coiled-coil rod domain (which may vary in size among strains) flanked by functional end domains."

Thirty-three patients were studied over a 3-year period. Predisposing factors included intravenous drug abuse (30%), diabetes (21%), and obesity (18%). Severe pain (94%) and abnormal temperature (88%) were present, whereas laboratory data and x-ray were nonspecific. Gram-positive organisms were most frequently recovered (B-hemolytic streptococcus 45%). Treatment consisted of antibiotics, surgical debridement, re-exploration 24 hours before surgery, nutritional support, and early soft tissue coverage as needed. Mean duration from admission to operation was 43 hours. The average number of operative debridements was three and the average length of hospitalization was 47 days. Patients operated on less than 12 hours from admission or greater than 48 hours had shorter hospital stays (36 and 38 days). The critical time period was 12-48 hours after admission; all deaths and amputations were in this group and the average hospital stay was 62 days (p less than 0.05). The number of operations did not correlate to hospital stay. Despite antibiotics and aggressive debridement, significant morbidity exists if operation is delayed more than 12 hours. Methods of early detection such as local bedside diagnostic incision and fascial inspection may be needed in high risk patients to further reduce the morbidity and mortality."

CD010502,0,9673270,0,Production of stabilized virulence factor-negative variants by group A streptococci during stationary phase.,"Many of the virulence factors associated with fulminant group A streptococci (GAS) infection are expressed under in vitro exponential growth conditions. However, the survival of GAS in tissue and intracellularly, as well as colonization of asymptomatic carriers, has been reported for GAS. The bacteria associated with these niches may encounter high-density, low-nutrient-flowthrough conditions that may more closely mimic in vitro stationary-phase conditions than exponential growth. Therefore, the behavior of GAS in stationary-phase culture was examined. We observed that after 24 h in stationary phase, GAS serotypes M49 and M2 developed a unstable colony dimorphism of typical large and atypical small colonies. Between days 4 and 5, we isolated stabilized atypical small colonies which remained stable for up to nine passages (approximately 200 generations) on fresh medium before fully reverting to the large-colony phenotype. Upon analysis, the small colonies showed no difference in cell number per colony, growth rate, survival in prolonged stationary-phase culture, or antibiotic sensitivity. However, the small colonies showed decreased transcription of hyaluronic acid capsule, the global positive virulence factor regulator gene mga, the mga-regulated emm mRNA (M-protein structural gene), and speB (cysteine protease). Accordingly, the small colonies were completely sensitive in a traditional phagocytosis assay. The production of virulence factors and phagocytosis resistance of the small-colony isolates was recovered when, after several passages on fresh medium, the colony morphology began to revert."
CD010502,0,1575992,0,Metabolically active antigen presenting cells are required for human T cell proliferation in response to the superantigen streptococcal M protein.,"M protein from type 5 group A streptococci has been identified as a member of the family of polyclonal T cell activators termed superantigens because it preferentially stimulates T cells bearing specific V beta elements of the T cell receptor (TCR). In this study the molecular and cellular requirements for presentation of this protein to T cells were investigated. Only accessory cells (AC) expressing class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules were capable of supporting T cell activation in response to a 22 kDa fragment of M protein (pep M). Despite the need for class II elements, processing of pep M5 by the antigen-presenting cells (APC) was not required for T cell proliferation induced by pep M5. Fixation of APC by paraformaldehyde (PF) treatment impaired their ability to induce optimal T cell proliferation in response to pep M5 without significantly affecting interleukin (IL-2) production. In contrast, PF-fixation of cells from the B cell lymphoma line, Raji, did not affect their ability to present pep M5 to human T cells. Addition of rIL-1 and IL-6 to PF-treated APC restored pep M5-induced blastogenesis. Our data suggest that pep M5 directly associates with HLA class II molecules forming a complex that can induce IL-2 production but not optimal proliferation by T cells. Additional signals provided by the AC are required to trigger optimal T cell proliferation in response to this superantigen."

A streptococci was assayed in 408 serum samples from 68 children who acquired one or more of these types in the upper respiratory tract and/or skin lesions. M type 6, a classic pharyngitis strain, was isolated almost exclusively from the upper respiratory tract. Acquisition of this type resulted in the highest percentage of responders without antibody to M protein and in the greatest magnitude of type-specific bactericidal activity as compared with M types 31, 49, and 52, which were commonly associated with pyoderma lesions. Factors that appeared to influence the M type-specific antibody response included the streptococcal type, the age of the child, the number of culture-positive visits, and the stage of the outbreak. The site(s) of isolation by itself and the serum opacity reaction of the infecting strain did not appear to be important determinants of the M type-specific antibody response."

CD010502,0,10816380,0,The potential role for nephritis-associated plasmin receptor in acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis.,"Immunoglobulin G from a patient convalescing from acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (APSGN) bound specific antigenic sites in early APSGN glomeruli. A streptococcal cytoplasmic antigen (preabsorbing antigen, PA-Ag), could selectively preabsorb fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled IgG and prevented glomerular staining. The antigen was purified and identified as an M(r) approximately 43,000 protein with a pI of 4.7 that strongly activated complement C3 (N. Yoshizawa, S. Oshima, I. Sagel, J. Shimizu, and G. Treser, 1992, J. Immunol. 148, 3110-3116). In the present study, a nephritogenic antigen was purified by affinity chromatography using APSGN IgG-immobilized Sepharose followed by chromatography on an anion-exchange resin. Purification was monitored by ELISA and Western blotting using the binding characteristics of the specific antibodies present in APSGN serum. The molecular weight of the purified antigen, named nephritis-associated plasmin receptor (NAPlr), was an M(r) approximately 43,000 protein and the internal amino acid sequence was found to be homologous to those of the plasmin receptor (Plr) of group A streptococci strain 64/14 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) from Bacillus subtilis. The purified NAPlr exhibited GAPDH activity and plasmin(ogen) binding activity. Using FITC-labeled rabbit anti-NAPlr, the antigen was found to be present in the glomeruli of 22 of 22 patients in the early stage of APSGN. Bacterial Plr was also demonstrated in human APSGN glomeruli for the first time using monoclonal antibody to the recombinant Plr protein. Antibody to NAPlr was found in the sera of 46 of 50 (92%) patients within 3 months of onset. These results led us to speculate that NAPlr bound to the glomeruli may contribute to the pathogenesis of APSGN via plasmin and complement activation."
CD010502,0,1755322,0,Necrotizing fasciitis rapidly diagnosed by aspiration cytology.,"A case of necrotizing fasciitis caused by beta-hemolytic streptococci is reported. A 66-year-old man was admitted because of pain and swelling in the right buttock. Rapid application of aspiration cytology made it possible to diagnose necrotizing fasciitis with bacterial infection. Unfortunately, however, the patient died of cardiac arrest due to hyperpotassemia 11 h after admission. Mortality from this disease is most often related to failure in recognizing it early. Rapid diagnosis and early treatment is mandatory in order to save the patients' life. We emphasize the usefulness of rapid aspiration cytology, despite the unfortunate outcome in the present case."

The detection method was indirect immunofluorescence in human myocardial tissue sections. Positively reacting sera were absorbed with group A streptococcus cell walls and cytoplasmic membranes, the objective being to locate the cross-reacting antigen in the streptococcus cell under the given experimental conditions. Cell walls gave the better absorption results. Whether or not the streptococci possessed the Fc-reacting factor was without influence on the absorption result."
CD010502,0,19726894,1,The evaluation of SD Bioline Strep A rapid antigen test in acute pharyngitis in pediatric clinics.,Acute pharyngitis is a very common respiratory tract infection. Rapid antigen tests (RATs) that detect group A streptococci (GAS) have an advantage over conventional throat culture in determining the cause of acute pharyngitis quickly. The efficiency of RAT should be good enough to be used in the laboratory or in the clinics.
CD010502,0,8557371,0,Interactions of human mannose-binding protein with lipoteichoic acids.,"We explored the interaction of human recombinant mannose-binding protein and lipoteichoic acids (LTAs) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The best ligand was Micrococcus luteus lipomannan, followed by Enterococcus spp. LTA containing mono-, di-, and oligoglucosyl substituents. LTAs lacking terminal sugars (those of Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus) or containing galactosyl substituents (those of Listeria spp. and Lactococcus spp.) were poor ligands. These results are consistent with known structural requirements for binding through the mannose-binding protein carbohydrate recognition domain."
CD010502,0,22043981,0,Induction of contact-dependent CD8(+) regulatory T cells through stimulation with staphylococcal and streptococcal superantigens.,The bacterial superantigen exotoxins of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes are potent stimulators of polyclonal T-cell proliferation. They are the causes of toxic shock syndrome but also induce CD25(+)  FOXP3(+) regulatory cells in the CD4 compartment. Several studies have recently described different forms of antigen-induced regulatory CD8(+) T cells in the context of inflammatory diseases and chronic viral infections. In this paper we show that bacterial superantigens are potent inducers of human regulatory CD8(+) T cells. We used four prototypic superantigens of S. aureus (toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 and staphylococcal enterotoxin A) and Str. pyogenes (streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins A and K/L). At concentrations below 1 ng/ml each toxin triggers concentration-dependent T-cell receptor Vβ-specific expression of CD25 and FOXP3 on CD8(+) T cells. This effect is independent of CD4(+) T-cell help but requires antigen-presenting cells for maximum effect. The cells also express the activation/regulatory markers cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 and glucocorticoid-induced tumour necrosis factor receptor-related protein and skin homing adhesins CD103 and cutaneous lymphocyte-associated antigen. Superantigen-induced CD25(+)  FOXP3(+)  CD8(+) T cells were as potent as freshly prepared naturally occurring CD4(+) regulatory T cells in suppressing proliferation of CD4(+)  CD25(-) T cells in response to anti-CD3 stimulation. Although superantigen-induced CD8(+)  CD25(+) FOXP3(+) express interleukin-10 and interferon-γ their suppressive function is cell contact dependent. Our findings indicate that regulatory CD8(+) T cells may be a feature of acute bacterial infections contributing to immune evasion by the microbe and disease pathogenesis. The presence and magnitude of regulatory CD8(+) T-cell responses may represent a novel biomarker in such infections. Superantigen-induced regulatory CD8(+) T cells also have therapeutic potential.

CD010502,0,16475828,0,Glycerol monolaurate inhibits the effects of Gram-positive select agents on eukaryotic cells.,"Many exotoxins of Gram-positive bacteria, such as superantigens [staphylococcal enterotoxins, toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1), and streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins] and anthrax toxin are bioterrorism agents that cause diseases by immunostimulation or cytotoxicity. Glycerol monolaurate (GML), a fatty acid monoester found naturally in humans, has been reported to prevent synthesis of Gram-positive bacterial exotoxins. This study explored the ability of GML to inhibit the effects of exotoxins on mammalian cells and prevent rabbit lethality from TSS. GML (>or=10 microg/mL) inhibited superantigen (5 microg/mL) immunoproliferation, as determined by inhibition of (3)H-thymidine incorporation into DNA of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (1 x 10(6) cells/mL) as well as phospholipase Cgamma1, suggesting inhibition of signal transduction. The compound (20 microg/mL) prevented superantigen (100 microg/mL) induced cytokine secretion by human vaginal epithelial cells (HVECs) as measured by ELISA. GML (250 microg) inhibited rabbit lethality as a result of TSST-1 administered vaginally. GML (10 microg/mL) inhibited HVEC and macrophage cytotoxicity by anthrax toxin, prevented erythrocyte lysis by purified hemolysins (staphylococcal alpha and beta) and culture fluids containing streptococcal and Bacillus anthracis hemolysins, and was nontoxic to mammalian cells (up to 100 microg/mL) and rabbits (250 microg). GML stabilized mammalian cell membranes, because erythrocyte lysis was reduced in the presence of hypotonic aqueous solutions (0-0.05 M saline) or staphylococcal alpha- and beta-hemolysins when erythrocytes were pretreated with GML. GML may be useful in the management of Gram-positive exotoxin illnesses; its action appears to be membrane stabilization with inhibition of signal transduction."
CD010502,0,9082751,0,Systemic immune response to Streptococcal and Staphylococcal lipoteichoic acids in children with recurrent tonsillitis.,"The antibodies to LTA of Streptococcus pyogenes (S. pyogenes) and of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) in sera from 110 children with or without recurrent tonsillitis were assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The antibody of IgA class was not detected in any sera. There was a significant positive correlation between IgG and IgM antibody levels to LTA of S. pyogenes and those to LTA of S. aureus. There was no significant correlation between anti-LTA IgM antibody and age or episodes of tonsillitis. However, serum anti-LTA IgG levels in younger patients ( < or = 7 y.o.) were significantly lower than those in their elders (>7 y.o.) (anti-S. pyogenes; p = 0.0007, anti-S. aureus; p = 0.007). Serum anti-LTA IgG antibody levels correlated inversely with episodes of tonsillitis in younger patients ( < 7 y.o.) (S. pyogenes: r = -0.362, p = 0.0082, S. aureus: r = -0.276, p = 0.047). These findings suggest that systemic hyposensitivity to LTA of S. pyogenes and S. aureus may be a possible cause of habitualness of tonsillitis in young children."
CD010502,0,3119674,0,Role of immunoblotting in the diagnosis of culture negative and enterococcal endocarditis.,"Serum samples from patients with endocarditis and septicaemia due to Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus bovis, and Streptococcus sanguis were immunoblotted against antigenic extracts from all four species. In E faecalis endocarditis there was a strong IgM response to E faecalis antigenic bands of 112, 88-90, and 45-47 Kd and a strong IgG response to 88-90 and 45-47 Kd bands. In E faecium endocarditis there was a pronounced IgG response to an E faecium band of 82-90 Kd. For S bovis endocarditis, there was a strong IgG response to several components of S bovis including bands of 66, 58, 52 and 4 Kd. For S sanguis, there was a strong IgG response to bands of 80-82, 76, 60 and 45 Kd. These patterns of antibody production were absent in patients with uncomplicated septicaemia and in controls. The delineation of these patterns enabled confirmation of the final diagnosis in seven patients initially suspected of having culture negative endocarditis."
CD010502,0,3516547,0,Diagnosis of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis. Use of antigen detection tests.,"Early diagnosis and prompt initiation of antibiotic therapy for group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis can shorten the duration of the clinical illness and reduce the period of infectivity. This in turn may expedite a patient's return to school or day care, as well as a parent's return to work. Antigen detection tests are available that can provide a rapid diagnosis of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis and can facilitate the prompt initiation of antibiotic therapy. In addition, these antigen detection tests can provide a rapid exclusion of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis and thereby prevent the initiation of unnecessary antibiotics in patients with nonstreptococcal pharyngitis. However, before throat cultures on blood agar plates are totally abandoned and completely replaced by antigen detection tests, a number of additional studies are needed. The consequences of false-negative and false-positive antigen detection tests need to be determined. The accuracy of the antigen detection test as performed in physicians' offices needs to be compared with traditional culture methods performed in physicians' offices and not with an ""idealized"" standard. Finally, investigations need to be initiated to determine the impact of different antigen detection tests on the revenues and work flow in various practice settings, as well as their direct impact on patient care."
CD010502,0,17959766,0,Clinical and epidemiological aspects of invasive Streptococcus pyogenes infections in Denmark during 2003 and 2004.,"Active surveillance of invasive group A streptococcal (GAS) infections was conducted in Denmark during 2003 and 2004 as a part of the Strep-EURO initiative. The main objective was to improve understanding of the epidemiology of invasive GAS disease in Denmark. During the 2 years, 278 cases were reported, corresponding to a mean annual incidence of 2.6 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. The vast majority of isolates, 253 (91%), were from blood, with the remaining 25 (9%) being from cerebrospinal fluid, joints, or other normally sterile sites. The mean case fatality rate (CFR) was 20%, with the rate being higher in patients more than 70 years of age (36.5%). For streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS) and necrotizing fasciitis the CFRs were 53% and 25%, respectively. Out of 16 T types recorded, three predominated: T28 (23%), T1 (22%), and the cluster T3/13/B3264 (14%). Among 29 different emm types, emm28 and emm1 accounted for 51% of strains, followed by emm3 (11%), emm89 (7%), and emm12 (5.5%). Low resistance rates were detected for macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B (MLS(B)) antibiotics (3%) and tetracycline (8%); two isolates exhibited coresistance to tetracycline and macrolides. Of nine pyrogenic exotoxin (superantigen) genes examined, speA and speC were identified in 58% and 40% of the strains, respectively; either of the genes was present in all strains causing STSS. Most strains harbored speG (99%). ssa was present in 14% of the isolates only. In Denmark, as in comparable countries, GAS invasive disease shows a sustained, high endemicity, with involvement of both established and emerging streptococcal emm and T types."

High titers of antibodies to group A S. haemolyticus L-forms in patients with relapsing erysipelas at the absence of free antigen indirectly suggests that the antigen is incorporated into antigen-antibody complexes."
CD010502,0,17162355,0,Towards a vaccine against rheumatic fever.,"Rheumatic fever (RF) is an autoimmune disease which affects more than 20 million children in developing countries. It is triggered by Streptococcus pyogenes throat infection in untreated susceptible individuals. Carditis, the most serious manifestation of the disease, leads to severe and permanent valvular lesions, causing chronic rheumatic heart disease (RHD). We have been studying the mechanisms leading to pathological autoimmunity in RF/RHD for the last 15 years. Our studies allowed us a better understanding of the cellular and molecular pathogenesis of RHD, paving the way for the development of a safe vaccine for a post-infection autoimmune disease. We have focused on the search for protective T and B cell epitopes by testing 620 human blood samples against overlapping peptides spanning 99 residues of the C-terminal portion of the M protein, differing by one amino acid residue. We identified T and B cell epitopes with 22 and 25 amino acid residues, respectively. Although these epitopes were from different regions of the C-terminal portion of the M protein, they showed an identical core of 16 amino acid residues. Antibodies against the B cell epitope inhibited bacterial invasion/adhesion in vitro. Our results strongly indicated that the selected T and B cell epitopes could potentially be protective against S. pyogenes."

CD010502,0,17989851,0,[Presence of bacterial DNA in valvular tissue of patients with chronic rheumatic heart disease].,"Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) is a delayed consequence of a pharyngeal infection with Group A streptococcus (GAS), usually ascribed to a cross-reactive immune response to the host cardiac tissues. Acute rheumatic fever (ARF) and its ensuing valvular sequelae are thus considered the prototype of a post-infectious autoimmune disease, with no direct evidence of residual streptococcal antigen in diseased valvular tissues. However, recent studies concerning the antigenic specificity and clonality of intralesional lymphocytes have revealed oligoclonal expansions characteristic of an antigen specific response, that might be related to GAS."
CD010502,0,12862498,0,Perineal streptococcal dermatitis/disease: recognition and management.,"Perianal streptococcal dermatitis (PSD) is a pediatric dermatologic infectious disease predominantly affecting children, particularly younger children, which is most commonly caused by group A beta-hemolytic streptococci (GABHS). Although the clinical picture of a sharply demarcated erythema is very characteristic, PSD is often misdiagnosed for long periods of time and patients are subjected to treatments for a variety of differential diagnoses. Vulvar and penile involvement with similar signs and symptoms have been documented in several patients with PSD. The diagnosis is made by either a swab of the affected region submitted for microbiological analysis with the specific question for GABHS, or a rapid strep test. Systemic antibiotics such as penicillin, erythromycin, newer macrolides, or others, probably augmented by topical antiseptic or antibiotic ointments are the treatment of choice. Treatment duration should be at least 14 days or, even better, 21 days, and be dictated by clinical and microbiological cure. Therefore treatment success should be investigated not only by clinical examination but also by post-treatment perineal swabs as well as a urine analysis to monitor for post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis. The author of this review supports the recent suggestion to summarize GABHS-induced vulvovaginal and penile infections together with PSD under the inclusive term 'perineal streptococcal disease' because these conditions coincide, share important clinical characteristics and, therefore, represent manifestations of the same disease."
CD010502,0,3128449,0,Changes in the pattern of infection caused by Streptococcus pyogenes.,"The distribution of T- and M-protein antigens was determined in 12,469 cultures of Streptococcus pyogenes sent to a reference laboratory. Of these 7232 (58%) were isolates from hospital patients, 249 (2%) from hospital staff and 4988 (40%) from the community. The survey extended from January 1980 to June 1987. During this time the numbers of isolates of M-types 6, 49 and 81 rose then fell, being replaced by types 1, 3 and 28. The proportion of isolates of M-types 4 and 12 remained constant. Few strains were received from cases of nephritis or rheumatic fever but there has been an increase in the number of strains from serious infections and deaths. Forty-four of the 55 (80%) strains received since 1985 from fatal infections have belonged to M-type 1. All other strains, bar two, received from fatal infections in those years belonged to M-type 3. Representatives of M-type 1 were also associated with erysipelas. Types 3 and 4 predominated among the isolates from scarlet fever, types 1, 4, 12 and 49 from nephritis, types 49 and 81 from skin infections in meat workers and type 28 in cases of puerperal sepsis. The M-typability rate was 97% but new M antigens await definition among strains causing pyoderma."
CD010502,0,6398907,0,Clindamycin and its action on the susceptibility of pathogenic bacteria to phagocytosis.,"The role of various surface virulence factors in bacterial resistance to opsonophagocytosis has been investigated in relation to the effect of clindamycin at concentrations below those which inhibit growth (sub-MIC). In each case studied (Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacteroides fragilis) contact with the drug under these conditions potentiated complement-mediated opsonization of the bacterial cells resulting in a greater and more rapid deposition of C3 as C3b on the cell surface. Several other features of the phagocytic process were enhanced in consequence."
CD010502,0,2409199,0,Size variation of the M protein in group A streptococci.,"In addition to the type-specific antigenic variation that is a well-known characteristic for the group A streptococcal M protein, we have now found that the M molecules vary with respect to their molecular size, both between M types and within an M type. By the use of an M6 monoclonal antibody, which crossreacts with 20 different M protein types, and antibodies to the N-acetyl glucosamine determinant of the cell wall, we have been able to identify the M protein molecules released from the streptococcal cell wall with muralytic enzymes, particularly group C phage-associated lysin. Immunoblot analysis of the cell extract identified M protein molecules bound to various cell wall fragments, suggesting a peptidoglycan linkage for the M molecule. M protein extracted from 20 different streptococcal serotypes revealed size variations from 41,000 to 80,000 in molecular weight. This extreme variation is unusual for related proteins. Similar size variations in the M molecule were also found in random clinical isolates of type 6 streptococci. No size change was seen in M6 protein isolated from: (a) strains within a limited epidemic, (b) a strain passaged in mice 192 times, and (c) a strain passaged in the laboratory for 156 generations, suggesting that the observed variation is not a rapid process. The results indicate that, within the broad limits observed in this study, the size of the M protein may not be critical to the antiphagocytic activity of the molecule."
CD010502,0,6352733,0,Rapid diagnosis of group A streptococcal antigen extracted directly from swabs by an enzymatic procedure and used to detect pharyngitis.,"Coagglutination after enzymatic digestion is a widely used, rapid procedure for serogrouping isolated colonies of beta-hemolytic streptococci. We tried to determine whether the same procedure could be used for the detection of group A streptococcal antigen directly from swabs used to take throat samples. This was achieved by incubating the swabs immersed in a small quantity of lytic extract obtained from cultures of the Maxted strain of Streptomyces griseus and testing the supernatant fluid by coagglutination. Of 538 throat swabs tested, blindly comparing the results of conventional cultures and rapid antigen detection, both tests were negative in 480 and both were positive in 49 swabs. In six cases, culture was positive and the rapid test was negative, but only one swab was from a patient with acute pharyngitis. In three cases, cultures were negative but the rapid test showed a strongly positive reaction. No special instructions were given to the physicians taking the samples. We conclude that this rapid antigen detection test, giving results in approximately 1 h, is an economic and reliable procedure for the detection of group A streptococcal antigen directly from throat samples."
CD010502,0,18092720,0,[Pharyngitis in children].,"The care strategy of pharyngitis has been changed dramatically these last years. Because of evolution of antibiotic resistance, the attitude which prevailed of the systematic treatment of pharyngitis in order to prevent a hypothetical acute rheumatic fever, could not persist. Discrimination between pharyngitis due to group A streptococcus (GAS) and nonstreptococcal pharyngitis (usually of viral causes) cannot be made in a reliable way by the clinical signs and symptoms, even if clinical scores are used. The free availability to practitioners of GAS rapid diagnostic tests, sensitive (>90%) and specific (>95%), changes the rule by simplifying it: pharyngitis with positive test must be treated with antibiotics, those with negative test should not be received such treatment. A reduction of two thirds of antibiotics consumption for pharyngitis can be expected, while maintaining the benefit (improvement of the clinical signs, reduction of contagiousness and the complications) for the patients for whom it is necessary. Because of GAS resistance to macrolides and the absence of resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics, a compound belonging of this last family should be prescribed and for a short treatment duration: amoxicillin (50 mg/kg/j, b.i.d for 6 days), cefpodoxime proxetil (8 mg/kg/j b.i.d for 5 days), cefuroxime axetil (30 mg/kg/j b.i.d for 4 days)."
CD010502,0,15695691,0,Evidence of Borrelia autoimmunity-induced component of Lyme carditis and arthritis.,"We investigated the possibility that manifestations of Lyme disease in certain hosts, such as arthritis and carditis, may be autoimmunity mediated due to molecular mimicry between the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi and self-components. We first compared amino acid sequences of Streptococcus pyogenes M protein, a known inducer of antibodies that are cross-reactive with myosin, and B. burgdorferi and found significant homologies with OspA protein. We found that S. pyogenes M5-specific antibodies and sera from B. burgdorferi-infected mice reacted with both myosin and B. burgdorferi proteins by Western blots and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. To investigate the relationship between self-reactivity and the response to B. burgdorferi, NZB mice, models of autoimmunity, were infected. NZB mice infected with B. burgdorferi developed higher degrees of joint swelling and higher anti-B. burgdorferi immunoglobulin M cross-reactive responses than other strains with identical major histocompatibility complex (DBA/2 and BALB/c). These studies reveal immunological cross-reactivity and suggest that B. burgdorferi may share common epitopes which mimic self-proteins. These implications could be important for certain autoimmunity-susceptible individuals or animals who become infected with B. burgdorferi."
CD010502,0,3898717,0,Interaction of group A type 1 streptococcal M protein with fibrinogen.,Adsorption chromatography of streptococcal extracts on immobilized fibrinogen allows isolation of components that are linked to the corresponding receptors. In this study it is shown by an indirect bactericidal test that fibrinogen binds the M proteins of the streptococcal strains used. Phage-associated lysin extracts of group A type 1 streptococci precipitated with fibrinogen in a double-diffusion test. Fibrinogen reactive components of other streptococcal types inhibited this precipitation reaction. This suggests that the fibrinogen receptors in different types of group A streptococci have identical activity. The interaction between M protein and fibrinogen does not interfere with the interaction between M protein and the corresponding type specific antibodies. The streptococcal antigen components isolated by immobilized fibrinogen showed mitogenic activity in a lymphocyte transformation test.

Serum creatine kinase was excessively elevated and myoglobinuria occurred. Nerve conduction studies revealed evidence of axonal neuropathy. Recovery was satisfactory within 18 months. Sural nerve and peroneus muscle biopsies were performed in the 4th and 14th week of the disease. Light microscopy of the sural nerve showed an incipient axonal type of neuropathy in the first biopsy. Ultrastructurally, Wallerian degeneration and endoneurial inflammatory cells were present. In the muscle biopsy, few atrophic fibers and altered blood vessels without further anomalies were found. In the second sural nerve biopsy, macrophages were numerous, some of which were immunoreactive for HLA-DR, and only a few myelinated and some unmyelinated nerve fibers remained. Muscle fibers in the second biopsy showed high-grade atrophy and myofibrillar abnormalities. Immunohistochemistry revealed diffuse endoneurial immunoglobulin deposition in the first sample, while in the later biopsy specimen, deposits of IgG, and kappa and lambda light chains were visible in circumscribed endoneurial areas. Immune-mediated neuropathy and myopathy are not well-known complications of streptococcal disease. This is, to our knowledge, the first detailed report on morphological findings in muscle and nerve in such a disorder."

CD010502,0,9691092,0,"Molecular analysis of the role of the group A streptococcal cysteine protease, hyaluronic acid capsule, and M protein in a murine model of human invasive soft-tissue infection.","Human invasive soft-tissue infections caused by group A Streptococcus are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. To investigate the pathogenesis of these serious infections, we characterized the host response to bacterial challenge with an M-type 3 isolate recovered from a patient with necrotizing fasciitis, or with isogenic gene replacement mutants deficient in cysteine protease, hyaluronic acid capsule, or M protein in a murine model of human invasive soft-tissue infection. Animals challenged with the wild-type or cysteine protease-deficient strain developed spreading tissue necrosis at the site of inoculation, became bacteremic, and subsequently died. Histopathologic examination of the necrotic lesion revealed bacteria throughout inflamed subcutaneous tissue. Arterioles and venules in the subcutaneous layer were thrombosed and the overlying tissue was infarcted. In contrast, animals challenged with either an acapsular or M protein-deficient mutant developed a focal area of tissue swelling at the site of inoculation without necrosis or subsequent systemic disease. Histopathologic examination of the soft-tissue lesion demonstrated bacteria confined within a well-formed subcutaneous abscess. We conclude that the group A streptococcal hyaluronic acid capsule and M protein, but not the cysteine protease, are critical for the development of tissue necrosis, secondary bacteremia, and lethal infection in a murine model of human necrotizing fasciitis."
CD010502,0,2453502,0,Isolation and characterization of the cell-associated region of group A streptococcal M6 protein.,"DNA sequence analysis of the complete M6 protein gene revealed 19 hydrophobic amino acids at the C terminus which could act as a membrane anchor and an adjacent proline- and glycine-rich region likely to be located in the cell wall. To define this region within the cell wall and its role in attaching the molecule to the cell, we isolated the cell-associated fragment of the M protein. Assuming that the cell-associated region of the M protein would be embedded within the wall and thus protected from trypsin digestion, cells were digested with this enzyme, and the wall-associated M protein fragment was released by phage lysin digestion of the peptidoglycan. With antibody probes prepared to synthetic peptides of C-terminal sequences, a cell wall-associated M protein fragment (molecular weight, 16,000) was identified and purified. Amino acid sequence analysis placed the N terminus of the 16,000-molecular-weight fragment at residue 298 within the M sequence. Amino acid composition of this peptide was consistent with a C-terminal sequence lacking the membrane anchor. Antibody studies of nitrous acid-extracted whole bacteria suggested that, in addition to the peptidoglycan-associated region, a 65-residue helical segment of the C-terminal domain of the M protein is embedded within the carbohydrate moiety of the cell wall. Since no detectable amino sugars were associated with the wall-associated fragment, the C-terminal region of the M6 molecule is likely to be intercalated within the cross-linked peptidoglycan and not covalently linked to it. Because the C-terminal region of the M molecule is highly homologous to the C-terminal end of protein A from staphylococci and protein G from streptococci, it is likely that the mechanism of attachment of these proteins to the cell wall is conserved."
CD010502,0,7927999,0,Antibody-producing cells in peripheral blood and tonsils after oral treatment of children with bacterial ribosomes.,"The efficacy of ribosomal preparations as mucosal immunostimulants was examined in the peripheral blood and tonsils of 14 children, before and after 28 days of oral treatment with D-53, a preparation of ribosomes from Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pyogenes. Tonsils from 10 untreated children were used as controls. Immunofluorescence and ELISAspot were performed to analyse variations in the numbers of immunoglobulin-containing and immunoglobulin-secreting B-cells. Both isotypic and antigenic specificities of these two types of cells were investigated. Significant differences were observed after treatment in the peripheral blood as well as between tonsils from treated and untreated children. In the peripheral blood a significant increase in immunoglobulin-secreting cells directed against antigenic specificities of D-53 was the major change. In tonsils, higher numbers of specific immunoglobulin-containing and secreting cells, and higher numbers of IgA-secreting cells were induced in treated children. These data support the efficacy of D-53 as an oral immunostimulant."

CD010502,0,1903744,0,The prevalence of Mycoplasma pneumoniae in ambulatory patients with nonstreptococcal sore throat.,"Several studies have implicated Mycoplasma pneumoniae as an important cause of nonstreptococcal pharyngitis in certain clinical settings. This study was performed to determine the prevalence of M. pneumoniae infection in family practice patients with sore throats and to identify patient characteristics predictive of this infection. M. pneumoniae throat cultures were obtained from 419 patients aged five years or older who were seen in one of four family practice offices with a complaint of sore throat. The overall prevalence of M. pneumoniae infection was 13%. It was characterized by more frequent hoarseness and less frequent complaint of postnasal drip when compared with other nonstreptococcal infections. Compared to patients with streptococcal pharyngitis, M. pneumoniae patients revealed a strikingly dissimilar clinical presentation. In particular, while pharyngitis is predictive of streptococcal infections, its presence did not predict M. pneumoniae infection. Recently developed rapid office-based tests for M. pneumoniae may allow timely diagnosis of this common and formerly elusive pathogen. Further study is required to validate the utility of such methods and to evaluate the efficacy of treatment."

STREP B OIA identified 25 known fish and dolphin GBS isolates. Thirteen non-GBS negative control isolates from fish and other animals were negative, giving 100% analytical specificity and no cross-reactivity. Three groups of 6 Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) (mean weight of 40.60+/-1.70 g) each were inoculated intraperitoneally with either 10(6) colony-forming units (cfu) GBS/fish, 10(6) cfu Streptococcus iniae/fish or 100 microL of tryptic soy broth (TSB) and observed for mortality for 7 days. The nare and brain of all fish were swabbed and subjected to the STREP B OIA for detection of GBS antigen immediately after swabbing (0 h) or 24, 48 and 72 h post-swabbing and compared to conventional culture on trypticase soy agar with 5% sheep blood. The STREP B OIA method demonstrated a diagnostic sensitivity of 75.0% and a diagnostic specificity of 69.2% compared to direct TSA. The percent agreement between OIA and culture was 100%. GBS antigen could be retrieved by OIA following 72-h storage of swabs. These results demonstrate the utility of the STREP B OIA to identify GBS from culture and directly from swabs of clinically- infected fish."

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were used to detect specific IgA antibody activity, and an immunofluorescent assay was used for measurement of total IgA in parotid saliva. The salivary IgA response to S. mutans was compared with that against a noncross-reacting antigen preparation from Escherichia coli and with antibody responses in five sham-immunized subjects. No change in salivary IgA response to S. mutans was observed after oral administration of this organism. Significantly less streptomycin-resistant S. mutans could be recovered from the six test subjects than from the five controls after the first of two challenges with streptomycin-resistant microorganisms. At the day of the first challenge, a significantly higher IgA antibody response to all tested antigens was observed in the test group than in the control group. The data show that this difference was not related to the oral administration of S. mutans but rather was an occasional finding. The coincidence of a rapid elimination of the challenge strain and a high IgA antibody response to S. mutans supports the concept that salivary IgA antibodies could have a biological significance in the human defense against cariogenic microorganisms."

Sequence analysis of the att-L proximal region of phi149 showed that the phage had a mosaic nature. Remarkably, we successfully obtained lysogenic conversion of GAS clinical isolates of various M serotypes (M1, M3, M5, M12, M19, M28, and M94), as well as of group C Streptococcus equisimilis (GCSE) clinical isolates, via transfer of a recombinant phage phi149::Km(r). Phage phi149::Km(r) from selected lysogenized GAS and GCSE strains could be transferred back to M12 GAS strains. Our data indicate that horizontal transfer of lysogenic phages among GAS can occur across the M-type barrier; these data also provide further support for the hypothesis that toxigenic conversion can occur via lysogeny between species. Streptococci might employ this mechanism specifically to allow more efficient adaptation to changing host challenges, potentially leading to fitter and more virulent clones."

The French Study Group Clamorange.","We compared the efficacy and safety of amoxicillin 1 g b.i.d. for 6 days and penicillin V 1 MU t.i.d. for 10 days in the treatment of group A beta-haemolytic streptococcal (GABHS) tonsillitis in adults. 342 patients with acute tonsillitis and a positive test for streptococcal antigen were included in a multicentre, randomized, open-label study; 338 patients were evaluable in an intention-to-treat analysis, and 234 with a positive throat swab culture in a per-protocol analysis. In the per-protocol analysis, the GABHS eradication rate at the end of treatment was comparable in the two groups: 92% (115/125) on amoxicillin and 92.7% (101/109) on penicillin (p = 0.95), as were the clinical success rates of 96% and 95.4%, respectively (p = 0.92). At the follow-up visit (day 28-32), 90.8% of patients treated with amoxicillin and 92.6% of those treated with penicillin V were free of GABHS (p = 0.85). Sore throat disappeared significantly faster on day 2 (p = 0.039) in the amoxicillin group. The intention-to-treat analysis gave similar clinical results. Tolerability was good in both groups. The efficacy and safety of amoxicillin 1 g b.i.d. for 6 days were not statistically different from those of penicillin V 1 MU t.i.d. for 10 days in the treatment of streptococcal tonsillitis in adults."

Timely and accurate identification of colonized mothers is imperative so that antibioprophylaxis can be implemented during labour to reduce the risk of neonatal sepsis. We planned our study to analyse the diagnostic accuracy of an intrapartum PCR assay to identify GBS-colonized women and to allow the implementation of correct (i.e. at least 4 h) intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis based on the PCR results. We included 695 women in labour who were tested for rectovaginal GBS carriage by culture and PCR. Women were also screened at 35-37 weeks of gestation. Intrapartum GBS colonization was 19.3%. Assay sensitivity was 81.0% for antenatal culture and 85.0% for intrapartum PCR; p 0.72. GBS colonization (n = 107) was known at least 4 h before delivery in 68 (64%) and 73 (68%) women based on antenatal culture and intrapartum PCR, respectively. Among 43 women delivering preterm, correct status was known at least 4 h before delivery in 10 (23%) and 32 (74%) women according to antenatal culture and intrapartum PCR, respectively. These results support the concept that GBS screening can be performed routinely during labour in a clinical setting. The intrapartum approach is at least as accurate as the antenatal screening, with the additional advantage of identifying women delivering preterm or not followed during pregnancy."

It is an IgM class human MAb that possess unique protective activity against experimental infections caused by the predominant group B capsule serotypes III and I. Preliminary preclinical studies with the IgM human MAb were designed to provide initial information useful for predicting its safety and pharmacokinetic properties. Two neonatal Macaca fascicularis monkeys were infused with the human MAb at either 17.8 or 230 mg/kg. Safety was evaluated by visually monitoring postinfusion clinical status and by standard clinical chemistry analyses and quantitative hematology on blood samples collected for 30 d. The serum antibody levels were determined by ELISA and antibody functional activity in serum samples by opsonophagocytic assays. The IgM human MAb appeared safe (normal laboratory values and clinical status) with a half-life of 2.5 d, a period compatible with the 5-d half-life reported for human IgM in adult serum. In addition, the human MAb retained functional opsonic activity for at least 30 d. Human MAb may offer a safe alternative for treating severe bacterial infections."
CD010502,0,10509847,0,Comparison of cefdinir and penicillin for the treatment of pediatric streptococcal pharyngitis.,"This multicenter, randomized, controlled, investigator-masked study was performed to assess the efficacy and tolerability of cefdinir for the treatment of streptococcal pharyngitis. Children aged 1 through 12 years with signs and symptoms of pharyngitis and a positive result on a rapid screening test for Streptococcus pyogenes were randomly assigned to receive cefdinir 14 mg/kg QD, cefdinir 7 mg/kg BID, or penicillin V 10 mg/kg 4 times daily for 10 days. Seven hundred ninety-two patients were enrolled, and 682 were clinically and microbiologically assessable. All treatment groups had similar demographic characteristics (-50.0% male, predominantly white, median age 7 years). The eradication rates of S pyogenes, determined 4 to 9 days after completion of therapy, were 94.3% in the cefdinir QD group, 94.3% in the cefdinir BID group, and 70.0% in the penicillin V group (95% confidence interval [CI] 17.6%-30.9%, P < 0.001 for cefdinir QD vs penicillin; CI 17.5%-30.9%, P < 0.001 for cefdinir BID vs penicillin).

Adverse reactions occurred in 8.3%, 8.7%, and 7.6% of cefdinir QD, cefdinir BID, and penicillin patients, respectively (P = NS). Treatment with cefdinir, either QD or BID, was associated with higher eradication rates of S pyogenes and higher clinical cure rates. Both cefdinir and penicillin were well tolerated. Three patients, 1 receiving cefdinir BID and 2 receiving penicillin, discontinued the study drug because of adverse reactions."

The genetic relatedness of the whole surface-exposed part of M was investigated in well-characterized Belgian and Brazilian GAS isolates which belong to different epidemiological and clinical landscapes. Despite a small number of different emm-types and an apparent low diversity in the Belgian isolates (as revealed by the emm-typing method), our data showed that the overall genetic diversity of the M proteins was higher than expected. On the contrary, the M proteins from the Brazilian isolates were genetically highly related. Since M is a multi-functional protein, an analysis of the whole surface-exposed sequence that takes into account the different functional domains may provide tools for typing as well as for analyzing the molecular mechanisms of M virulence or defining vaccine strategies."
CD010502,0,9515063,0,The relationship between symptoms and IgG and IgE antibodies in an office environment.,"Airborne fungi have been postulated as a cause of symptoms among office workers. Using the MAST chemiluminescent system, this study evaluated 36 IgG and 36 IgE antibody levels in 47 office workers from an area with elevated airborne fungal concentrations and 44 office workers from an otherwise similar area with lower airborne fungal exposure. No difference was found in IgG antibody to fungi between the lower and higher exposure areas, but high IgG antibody to one or more of the fungi studied was detected in 67% of all the workers tested. IgE antibody to one or more antigens was detected in 40% of the participants. Workers who reported atopic symptoms (sneezing, runny nose, and itchy eyes) or ""sick building"" symptoms (any three of the following temporally related to work: headache, fatigue, stuffy nose, irritated eyes, or sore throat) were more likely to have one positive IgE antibody test. Type I hypersensitivity to aeroallergens besides fungi may play a role in some symptoms reported by some participants in this office building."
CD010502,0,16846863,0,Evaluation of the sensitivity of a rapid polymerase chain reaction for detection of group B streptococcus.,"The objective of this study was to compare detection of group B streptococcal (GBS) carriage using 'real-time' polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and microbiological standard culture. The study design was a test accuracy study comparing a novel molecular technique against the standard microbiological cultural technique in normal pregnant women. The setting and population consisted of 143 pregnant women with pre-labour rupture of the membranes, recruited from two large teaching hospitals in the UK. The study examined the efficacy of a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for screening pregnant women who presented with term rupture of the membranes. Low vaginal specimens were obtained from the women. The specimens were tested for GBS by conventional culture and with a GBS-specific real-time PCR assay. The main outcome measure was the sensitivity and specificity of the PCR assay with 95% confidence intervals (CI) compared with the standard culture. The length of time to obtain a result was also reported for both methods. Among the 143 women, the results of the culture were positive (at least one colony) for GBS in 20 women (14%). The PCR assay detected GBS carriage in 10 women (7%). As compared with the culture method, the sensitivity and specificity of the PCR assay were 45% and 99%, respectively. The positive and negative predictive values of the PCR assay were 90% and 92%, respectively. The length of time required to obtain results for the majority of women (94%) was <2.5 h for the PCR assay and at least 24 h for culture. While a rapid result (within 3 h) of carriage of GBS can be obtained by the PCR assay, at present, it cannot replace conventional culture without further optimisation of the DNA extraction method. The sensitivity may further be improved by testing both low vaginal and rectal specimens."

Bacteriological etiology was obtained only in 24 (40pc) patients by microscopic examination, culture and antigen detection. Streptococcus pneumoniae was the leading causative agent identified in 15 cases. Other etiologies were Klebsiella pneumoniae (3), Streptococcus pyogenes (2) Staphylococcus aureus (2), Haemophilus influenzae (1) and Moraxella catarrhails (1). Patients were started on ampicillin one gram twice daily, empirically, and treated for 10 days. There were 52(86.7pc) patients cured, two(3.3pc) patients improved and six (10pc) were therapeutic failures. The causative agents in patients with failures were: Klebsiella pneumoniae (1), Staphylococcus aureus (1), Streptococcus pneumoniae (1) and unknown in three cases. Only six of 60 patients still febrile after three days were switched to amoxycillin/clavulanic acid or cefaclor according to culture results and susceptibilities or to roxythromycin because no organisms were isolated. Side effects were observed in only one (1.7pc) patient who developed a mild skin rash. Due to its low cost and its high efficacy, ampicillin still appears to be the drug of choice in adult community acquired pneumonia in our region."

This totally synthetic polyvalent administered to mice with Freund complete adjuvant or in saline with murabutide (an adjuvant-active muramyl peptide) elicited high levels of antibodies which, in certain cases, were shown to be biologically active. The results indicated that these antibodies recognized specifically the four peptides. None of the epitopes were immunodominant. It was also demonstrated that the association of several peptides enhanced their respective immunogenicities as compared with those of their homopolymers. Finally, this study shows that a totally synthetic vaccine administered in saline with a synthetic adjuvant can be immunogenic in the absence of a protein carrier."
CD010502,0,9973578,0,Streptococcus pyogenes strains containing emm12 and emm55 possess a novel gene coding for distantly related SIC protein.,"Streptococcus pyogenes infection and acute glomerulonephritis (AGN), a non-suppurtave disease, are endemic in the Aboriginal people of the Northern Territory (NT) of Australia. Vir typing, a locus-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based typing method [Gardiner, Hartas, Currie et al PCR Meth Appl 1995 4: 288-93], has revealed high divergence among the NT streptococcal strains. A total of 76 Vir types (VTs) representing about 95% of the NT isolates were screened for sic, a gene for streptococcal inhibitor of complement function, by PCR and hybridization. This revealed that seven VTs are positive for sic, and there are two classes of the gene: those closely related to sic (CRS) originally described by Akesson, Sjoholm & Bjorck [ J. Biol. Chem. 1996 271: 1081-8] and those distantly related to sic (DRS). Among the CRS-positive VTs, VT16, VT78 and VT91 have emm (gene for M protein) encoding type 1 M protein or related specificity, and VT8 and VT101 contain emm57 or related alleles. Chromosomal location of CRS in emm57 is different from that in emm1 or related strains. The DRS-positive VT18 and VT52 contained emm55 and emm12 respectively, which are phylogenetically related. Strains of S. pyogenes types 1, 12, 55 and 57 are known to be associated with AGN. Restricted distribution of CRS and DRS among the M types historically associated with AGN suggests that these sic alleles may have a role in AGN pathogenesis."

Using the results of maternal screening at prenatal visits and the presence of perinatal risk factors during labour, neonatal group B streptococcal (GBS) early-onset disease can be prevented by selective intrapartum chemoprophylaxis. Possible variations on this strategy may employ semiquantitative tests for GBS colonization at prenatal visits or, possibly, rapid bacterial diagnosis intrapartum.

Three polypeptide fragments were purified by slab gel electrophoresis on sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) polyacrylamide followed by electroelution. The purified fragments migrated as 28-, 25-, and 23.5-kDa fragments, respectively. Each of the fragments inhibited opsonization of a diluted antiserum prepared in rabbits by immunization with whole type 1 streptococci. The amino-terminal sequences of the peptide fragments were confirmed by comparison with the primary structure predicted from the nucleotide sequence of the type 1 M protein structural gene. The 28-kDa fragment contained the NH2-terminal asparagine residue of the processed type 1 M protein, whereas the NH2-terminal sequences of the 25- and 23.5-kDa peptides began at residues 27 and 36, respectively. A seven-residue periodicity with respect to polar and nonpolar residues was observed beginning at residue 22 and, therefore, the secondary structural potential of type 1 M protein is similar to that reported for other M proteins. In contrast to the other M proteins, however, identical repeats were rare, the longest sequence identity consisting of a three-amino acid acid sequence Lys-Asp-Leu at positions 30-32 repeated once at positions 65-67. A 23-residue synthetic peptide of the amino-terminus of the type 1 M protein evoked opsonic antibodies against type 1 streptococci. These results indicate that the NH2-terminal region of type 1 M protein retains the secondary structural characteristics of other M serotypes. Moreover, it contains epitopes that evoke protective immune responses. Our studies may have bearing in the development of safe and effective vaccines against group A streptococcal infections."

CD010502,0,3929562,0,Binding of aggregated human serum albumin to M12 and some other types of group A streptococci.,"In radiobinding tests many group A, C and G streptococci react with IgG and IgA, irrespective of the antigen-combining sites, as well as with various other serum proteins, e.g. human serum albumin (HSA). The present study demonstrated that glutaraldehyde-aggregated, radiolabelled HSA (a*HSA), in comparison to monomeric HSA, binds more avidly to streptococci. Of group A streptococci, strains representing types M6, M12, M18, M46, M55 and M57 displayed pronounced binding of a*HSA whereas a number of other serotypes were non-reactive. The streptococcal sites involved proved to be relatively heat-resistant and highly sensitive to trypsin treatment. Human fibrinogen counteracted the binding of a*HSA. The uptake by M12 was inhibited strongly by rabbit antiserum raised against M12, whereas other antisera were less active. The results suggest that the bacterial structure binding a*HSA is a protein and that, in at least one serotype, M12, the binding occurs to the M-protein."

CD010502,0,17543400,0,Immunoglobulin cleavage by the streptococcal cysteine protease IdeS can be detected using protein G capture and mass spectrometry.,"The immunoglobulin degrading enzyme of Streptococcus pyogenes, IdeS, is an unusual cysteine protease produced by group A streptococci for which the only known substrate is immunoglobulin G (IgG). To date, IdeS has not been found to cleave any of the known synthetic substrates that other cysteine proteases hydrolyse, thus making the development of an IdeS detection assay difficult. Furthermore, at high doses of substrate, product generation is inhibited potentially due to the need for a dimeric enzyme complex with IgG. In this study we have developed a mass spectral assay for IdeS activity based on the detection of an Mr approximately 25,300 Fc fragment that retains the ability to bind streptococcal protein G. Using this assay procedure, evidence for a multimeric enzyme-substrate complex was obtained as well as identifying isolated heavy chains as a non-substrate inhibitor of IdeS activity. Under appropriate experimental conditions the assay could be used to detect IdeS activity in bacterial culture media or in human plasma without a requirement for purified reactants. The availability of a rapid and sensitive assay for IdeS should facilitate the detailed biochemical characterization of this unusual bacterial cysteine protease."

It is also a zoonotic agent leading predominantly to meningitis in humans working in close contact with pigs. In this study, we investigated the ability of S. suis to up-regulate the expression of adhesion molecules involved in inflammation, using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. S. suis serotype 2 stimulated the up-regulation of the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1, CD54), CD11a/CD18 and CD11c/CD18 on human THP-1 monocytes, but did not change that of ICAM-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1, CD106) and E-selectin (CD62E) on human endothelial cells. The up-regulation of adhesion molecules was time- and bacterial concentration-dependent, and cell wall components were largely responsible for such stimulation. To a lesser extent, purified haemolysin of S. suis also stimulated adhesion molecule expression. Stimulation of monocytes with strains of different origin showed that there was no clear tendency for human strains to induce a higher expression of adhesion molecules than strains from diseased pigs. Finally, monocytes stimulated with S. suis also showed an increase in adherence to endothelial cells. Hence, S. suis is capable of up-regulating important adhesion molecules involved in inflammation, which may result in an increased leucocyte recruitment into sites of infection, thus providing a possible mechanism for some of the inflammatory features of meningitis caused by this pathogen."

CD010502,0,12108578,0,"Molecular mechanisms of adhesion, colonization, and invasion of group A streptococci.","The initial step in establishing a bacterial infection is adhesion of the organism to the epithelium of the host. Group A streptococci use multiple adhesins to attach to host cells and the types of adhesins expressed by a particular strain will determine its tissue specificity. Expression of adhesins is regulated in response to changing environmental and growth conditions. Thus, the array of adhesins expressed by a group A streptococcus will depend on the complement of its adhesin genes and on the environment. Expression of some adhesins may trigger internalization of the streptococci by host cells, which may enable the streptococci to evade antibiotics and to facilitate the penetration of deeper tissues. In this review, we present the different molecular mechanisms of adhesion utilized by group A streptococci and how these interactions lead to colonization and invasion."

Four clinical features (fever [history of] > or = 38 degrees C, lack of cough, tonsillar exudate, and anterior cervical lymphadenopathy) are recorded in 355 patients aged four years to > or =15 years. A rapid antigen diagnostic test (RADT) is performed, as well as a throat culture. Antistreptolysin O (ASO) titre is performed in patients 11 years. GABHS from patients are tested for susceptibility to different antibiotics. Throat cultures were positive for GABHS in 19% patients. Rapid tests were positive in 24%. Compared with throat culture, the rapid test gave a sensitivity of 91%, specificity of 91%, positive predictive value of 73% and a negative predictive value of 98%.

A total of 70 GAS-infected cases were enrolled in our study from the period 1993 to 2002. Twenty one cases had invasive disease, and 49 were non-invasive. Their medical records were reviewed, and demographic data were collected for analysis. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was conducted according to the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards for Streptococcus spp. Isolates were subjected to chromosomal SmaI (Invitrogen) digestion of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), and emm typing was also performed. The mean age of the invasive group was 41.1 +/- 22.4 years compared with 13.0 +/- 16.6 years for the non-invasive group (p<0.05). Eighty one percent of the invasive group had underlying diseases. Diabetes and malignancy were the 2 most common medical conditions. All isolates were susceptible to penicillin. The resistance rate was 42.8% and 55.1% for erythromycin in the invasive and non-invasive groups, respectively. A total of 51 different PFGE types were identified among the GAS isolates without particular genotypes. Serotype M12 was the most common one (28.4%), followed by M4 (19.4%). Our study demonstrated that the patients in the invasive group were older, with more underlying diseases, and with a higher mortality rate. Antimicrobial susceptibility of the isolates was the same in both groups. There was no epidemic strain, nor did PFGE reveal a more invasive clone."

CD010502,0,9817856,1,Streptococcal pharyngitis: impact of a high-sensitivity antigen test on physician outcome.,"The purpose of the present study was to determine whether the availability of results from a high-sensitivity, rapid test for group A streptococci (Strep A OIA; BioStar, Inc., Boulder, Colo.) improves physician outcome. The study population included 465 consecutive patients with symptoms of acute pharyngitis seen in two outpatient clinics in a large suburban medical center; one clinic, a walk-in clinic (WIC), primarily saw adult patients, and one clinic, a pediatric and adolescent medicine clinic (PED), primarily saw pediatric patients. We measured improvement in physician outcome by comparing physician intent for prescribing an antibiotic based on clinical impression with physician practice once the results of the Strep A OIA were known. Based upon intent, the physicians seeing WIC patients (WIC physicians) would have prescribed an appropriate antibiotic course for 42% of patients with cultures positive for group A beta-hemolytic streptococci (GABHS) and 61% of patients with cultures negative for GABHS. After receiving the results of the Strep A OIA, WIC physicians prescribed an appropriate antibiotic course for 81% of patients with positive cultures and 72% of patients with negative cultures. Based upon intent, the physicians seeing PED patients (PED physicians) would have prescribed an appropriate antibiotic course for 35% of patients with positive cultures and 77% of patients with negative cultures. After receiving the results of the Strep A OIA, PED physicians prescribed an appropriate antibiotic course for 90% of patients with positive cultures and 81% of patients with negative cultures. Based on a 14.5% prevalence of GABHS among WIC patients, Strep A OIA improved the overall WIC physician outcome from 58 to 74%. Based on a 31.5% prevalence of GABHS among PED patients, Strep A OIA improved the PED physician outcome from 64 to 84%. Had Strep A OIA alone guided therapeutic choice, physicians would have prescribed an appropriate antibiotic course for 95% of the patients at the time of the initial encounter. We conclude that the use of Strep A OIA improves physician outcome."
CD010502,0,16514412,0,Role of IL-12B promoter polymorphism in Adamantiades-Behcet's disease susceptibility: An involvement of Th1 immunoreactivity against Streptococcus Sanguinis antigen.,"Adamantiades-Behcet's disease (ABD) is a chronic inflammatory multisystem disorder. Although the precise etiology is unclear, high prevalence of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B51 predisposition and predominantly involved T-helper type 1 cells (Th1)-type proinflammatory cytokines and extrinsic Streptococcal infection suggest a substantial association with an immunogenetic basis and strengthens the hypothesis that IL-12, a potent inducer of Th-1 immune reaction, is a putative candidate in its pathogenesis. These clinicopathological findings led us to examine interleukin 12 p40 (IL-12B) promoter polymorphism, for which the 4-base pair (bp) heterozygous insertion has been shown to affect the gene transcription and subsequent protein production. We analyzed IL-12B promoter genotypes in 194 Japanese subjects (92 with ABD and 102 normal controls) by PCR-based restriction enzyme digestion. The frequency of the insertion heterozygosity was significantly higher in patients than in controls (49/92, 53.3% vs 39/102, 38.2%, respectively). Comparing these with HLA haplotype data, this trend was more significant in HLA-B51-negative patients (29/42, 69.0% vs 20/50, 40.0%; P = 0.005). As assessed by semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR and ELISA, stimulation with Streptococcal antigens specifically increased expression of IL-12 p40 mRNA and protein, in conjunction with IL-12 p70 induction, in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from heterozygous patients. Our results provide evidence for anti-bacterial host response toward Th1-immunity mediated by IL-12 in patients with ABD, and the possible insight into the genetic susceptibility that is independent of HLA background."
CD010502,0,9788261,0,"Expression of MUC-1 glycoprotein in plasma cells, follicular dendritic cells, myofibroblasts and perineurial cells: immunohistochemical analysis using three monoclonal antibodies.","Normal and malignant plasma cells (PC), follicular dendritic cells (FDC), myofibroblasts (MFB) and perineurial cells (PNC) were investigated for the expression of MUC-1 glycoprotein (MUC-1gp) by immunohistochemical and immunoelectron microscopic techniques using monoclonal antibodies E29, 115D8, DF3 and a combination of the three. MUC-1 glycoprotein-positive PC detected by the combined antibodies were frequently seen in a variety of pathological lesions tested, including chronic cervicitis, chronic synovitis, Hodgkin's disease, allergic rhinitis and sinusitis, tuberculous lymphadenitis, foreign body granuloma, multiple myeloma, and chronic tonsillitis. In the lesions containing MUC-1gp-positive PC, the infiltration of immunoglobulin (Ig) E PC and/or IgE-bound mast cells was significantly increased, but MUC-1gp-positive PC did not contain any specific immunoglobulin heavy or light chains. The findings suggest that the expression of MUC-1 gp in PC, although not restricted to IgE-class cells, may be induced in an allergic status. Plasma cells and PNC mainly reacted with the antibodies E29 and 115D8, while FDC and MFB were principally reactive with the antibody DF3. In some cases of multiple myeloma, the neoplastic PC were predominantly immunoreactive with DF3. The results indicate: (i) the epitopic variability of MUC-1gp molecules expressed on the non-epithelial cells; and (ii) the epitopic alterations during malignant transformation. It should also be noted that the expression of MUC-1gp in the non-epithelial cells represents a pitfall in histopathological diagnosis."

Our recent conformational analysis of the complete sequence of the M6 protein led us to propose a basic model for the M protein consisting of an extended central coiled-coil rod domain flanked by a variable N-terminal and a conserved C-terminal end domains. The central coiled-coil rod domain of M protein, which constitutes the major part of the M molecule, is made up of repeating heptads of the generalized sequence a-b-c-d-e-f-g, wherein ""a"" and ""d"" are predominantly apolar residues. Based on the differences in the heptad pattern of apolar residues and internal sequence homology, the central coiled-coil rod domain of M protein could be further divided into three subdomains I, II, and III. The streptococcal sequelae rheumatic fever (RF) and acute glomerulonephritis (AGN) have been known to be associated with distinct serotypes. Consistent with this, we observed that the AGN associated M49 protein exhibits a heptad motif that is distinct from the RF associated M5 and M6 proteins. Asn and Leu predominated in the ""a"" and ""d"" positions, respectively, in subdomain I of the M5 and M6 proteins, whereas apolar residues predominated in both these positions in the M49 protein. To establish whether the heptad motif of M49 is unique to this protein, or is a general characteristic of nephritis-associated serotypes, the amino acid sequence of M57, another nephritis-associated serotype, has now been examined. The gene encoding M57 was amplified by PCR, cloned into pUC19 vector, and sequenced. The C-terminal half of M57 is highly homologous to other M proteins (conserved region). In contrast, its N-terminal half (variable region) revealed no significant homology with any of the M proteins. Heptad periodicity analysis of the M57 sequence revealed that the basic design principles, consisting of distinct domains observed in the M6 protein, are also conserved in the M57 molecule. However, the heptad motif within the coiled-coil subdomain I of M57 was distinct from M5 and M6 but similar to M49. Similar analyses of the heptad characteristics within the reported sequences of M1, M12, and M24 proteins further confirmed the conservation of the overall architectural design of sequentially distinct M proteins.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

From the reference strains one group G strain was incorrectly identified with the Api-Strep. The direct immunofluorescence test yielded a result in agreement with the precipitation method in 94% of the freshly isolated strains. Co-agglutination and latex agglutination gave corresponding results with the precipitation method in 99%, taking into consideration that the first method doesn't apply to groups D and F. The biochemical determination with Api-Strep gave correct results with all strains of groups A and B, but did not do so with some group G and most of the group C streptococcal strains. Therefore especially co-agglutination and latex agglutination can be recommended for routine diagnostic purposes as reliable, rapid, and simple methods."

CD010502,0,8605894,0,A two-domain mechanism for group A streptococcal adherence through protein F to the extracellular matrix.,"Streptococcus pyogenes binds to the extracellular matrix (ECM) and a variety of host cells and tissues, causing diverse human diseases. Protein F, a S.pyogenes adhesin that binds fibronectin (Fn), contains two binding domains. A repeated domain (RD2) and an additional domain (UR), located immediately N-terminal to RD2. Both domains are required for maximal Fn binding. In this study, we characterize RD2 and UR precisely and compare their functions and binding sites in Fn. The minimal functional unit of RD2 is of 44 amino acids, with contributions from two adjacent RD2 repeats flanked by a novel 'MGGQSES' motif. RD2 binds to the N-terminal fibrin binding domain of Fn. UR contains 49 amino acids, of which six are from the first repeat of RD2. It binds to Fn with higher affinity than RD2, and recognizes a larger fragment that contains fibrin and collagen binding domains. Expression of UR and RD2 independently on the surface-exposed region of unrelated streptococcal protein demonstrates that both mediate adherence of the bacteria to the ECM. We describe here a mechanism of adherence of a pathogen that involves two pairs of sites located on a single adhesin molecule and directed at the same host receptor."

On laboratory examination, mild increase of transaminases was found. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay showed that the serum had markedly high titers of IgG antibodies to GM2 (1:3,200) and Ga1NAc-GD1a (1:1,600). Serum IgM-EIA index and CF titer of cytomegalovirus were markedly high. In cerebrospinal fluid examination, protein was increased (110 mg/dl). Blink reflex indicated involvement of bilateral facial nerves. In limb motor and sensory nerves, conduction studies revealed the presence of both axonal degeneration and segmental demyelination. The diagnosis of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) with facial nerve paralysis, relatively unique to CMV infection, was made. In the fourth week following the initial neurologic symptom, weakness in facial and limb muscles and sensory disturbances in both limbs were gradually improved. In about three months, conduction studies of limb nerves and CSF protein were normalized. During the clinical course above, the titers of antibodies to GM2 and Ga1NAc-GD1a, IgM-EIA index and the titer of CF of CMV were significantly decreased. Anti-GM2 antibody was reported to be found in the sera from the patient of GBS associated with CMV infection. However, there is no report of GBS patient with CMV infection whose serum showed the presence of both anti-GM2 and anti-Ga1NAc-GD1a antibodies. In this patient, antibodies to CMV, GM2 and Ga1NAc-GD1a epitopes and other unexamined or/and unknown epitopes may be related to the neuropathy. The studies of the specific antibody to react with facial nerve in the serum from GBS patients with facial nerve paralysis and the molecular mimicry between the specific ganglioside and the structure of CMV are warranted in future."
CD010502,0,3048861,0,Demonstration of cross-reactions between pneumococci and alpha-streptococci using gold-labelled mono- and polyclonal antibodies and electron microscopy.,"Cross-reactions between alpha-streptococci and the pneumococcal C-polysaccharide (PnC) were investigated using electron microscopy and immunogold labelling of bacterial cells. Monoclonal antibodies against two different determinants of the PnC molecule were used, one directed against the chain sugar of the repeating unit 2-acetamido-4-amino-2,4,6-trideoxygalactose (Sug) and the other against the phosphorylcholine residue. Two different immunogold techniques were tested, either by direct labelling of the monoclonal antibody or by using an antimouse immunogold conjugate to demonstrate binding of the monoclonal antibodies. Antibodies against the ""Sug"" determinant reacted only with pneumococci, whereas antibodies against the phosphorylcholine determinant bound to cross-reacting streptococci as well as to pneumococci. These results indicate that the cross-reacting antigens of the alpha-streptococci contain phosphorylcholine residues, but that they are not identical to the C-polysaccharide molecule."
CD010502,0,3917638,0,Gonococcal infections.,"Gonorrhea may be the most extensively studied infection of the past 20 years. The gonorrhea epidemic in the United States began in the early 1960s and peaked in 1975. Ironically, since 1976 the declining overall incidence has been offset by the advent of plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase production by Neisseria gonorrhoeae and by a growing problem with outbreaks due to strains with chromosomally mediated penicillin and tetracycline resistance. This new antimicrobial resistance, coupled with the frequency of concurrent chlamydial infection in developed countries and concurrent syphilis in some developing countries, has created a need for new approaches to gonorrhea therapy. With the introduction of certain new antimicrobial agents, highly effective forms of therapy are again available. New approaches to rapid diagnosis are also becoming available, but require critical appraisal. Unfortunately, in most of the world's population, gonorrhea remains epidemic, diagnosis of gonorrhea in women is extremely difficult, and highly effective antimicrobial agents are no longer affordable. Thus, vaccine development remains an extremely important goal. Although no candidate gonococcal vaccine currently holds high promise, the increasing understanding of the biology of the gonococcus and the pathogenesis of gonorrhea will serve to focus future research on vaccine development."

Acid-extracted OF could be separated from M protein by Sepharose 4B chromatography, but some of the OF-positive fractions that did not precipitate with the absorbed homologous anti-M rabbit serum, were able to neutralise opsonic antibodies present in human serum. The isoelectric-focusing profiles of the two antigens showed partial similarity. Some strains of the OF-positive serotypes, e.g., M-types 22 and 49, lost both M antigen and OF activity on serial transfer in Todd-Hewitt broth, but this was not seen in a representative of M-type 60, and no M-negative OF-negative variants could be detected after six subcultures. Among the OF-negative serotypes some, e.g., M-types 5 and 6, were completely stable, whereas others, e.g., M-types 12, 55 and 57, lost their M antigens after serial subculture. One explanation is that the genes that code for M antigen are plasmid borne in some serotypes and, moreover, are carried on the same plasmid as the gene for OF in some OF-positive serotypes. However, analysis of cell lysates by agarose-gel electrophoresis failed to demonstrate the presence of plasmid DNA in any of the strains tested."
CD010502,0,8577238,0,Correlation of epithelial cell invasiveness of group B streptococci with clinical source of isolation.,"Neonatal infections caused by Group B streptococci (GBS) may lead to pneumonia, sepsis, or meningitis indicating that GBS are able to invade tissues and enter the bloodstream from infected sites. In this study, we showed that the tissue invasiveness of GBS may be related to their ability to invade epithelial cells in vitro by correlating the degree of GBS invasion of cultured human respiratory epithelial cells with the clinical source of isolation. Among 77 isolates tested, those from invasive infections of neonates and adults were significantly (P < 0.001) more invasive than those from vaginal carriers and colonised neonates without clinical symptoms. Furthermore, isolates from the blood were more invasive (P < 0.05) than those from other sites. GBS invasion seemed to be mediated by bacterial surface proteins since trypsin treatments of streptococci significantly reduced their invasion into epithelial cells and invasiveness was not limited to a certain capsular serotype. The two major GBS surface protein antigens c and R, however, were not involved in the invasion process. These results indicate that in vitro invasion of cultured human cells reflects the in vivo invasive property of GBS and involves bacterial surface components different from known virulence factors such as capsule or protein antigens c and R."

We conducted a study to define the sensitivity and specificity of RADT, using throat culture results as the gold standard, in 100 emergency department patients who presented with symptoms consistent with streptococcal pharyngitis. We found that RADT had a sensitivity of 68.2% (15 of 22), a specificity of 89.7% (70 of 78), a positive predictive value of 65.2% (15 of 23), and a negative predictive value of 90.9% (70 of 77). We conclude that RADT is useful in the emergency department when the clinical suspicion is GABHS, but results should be confirmed with a throat culture in patients whose RADT results are negative."
CD010502,0,3538770,0,Commercial kits are not equally sensitive in detecting the group antigen of group A streptococcus.,The relative sensitivities of four commercially available kits for the demonstration of the group antigen of group A streptococcus were estimated in laboratory experiments. Two kits gave positive reactions with swabs charged with approximately 10(5) colony-forming units of group A hemolytic streptococci of five common T-types. The two other kits required inocula ten times higher. Application of the antigen detection reagents from each kit to antigen extracts prepared by extraction reagents from the other kits revealed that the differences in sensitivity were largely attributable to differences in the extraction abilities. The four kits did not differ appreciably in their ability to demonstrate group A antigen in human pus mixed with group A streptococci; the minimum inoculum detectable was approximately 10(6) colony-forming units per 0.04 ml of pus.
CD010502,0,16760319,0,Antidiphtheria antibody responses in patients and carriers of Corynebacterium diphtheriae in the Arkhangelsk region of Russia.,"Diphtheria is under control in industrialized countries. However, single cases and outbreaks still occur and the disease is not completely understood. Forty-three individuals suspected of having diphtheria who were referred to the Infectious Disease Hospital of Arkhangelsk from December 1994 to March 1995 were included in this study. Fifteen patients were diagnosed as having diphtheria and received equine hyperimmune antidiphtheria toxin antiserum, and 28 were diagnosed as carriers, 12 with nondiphtherial tonsillitis or pharyngitis and 16 without symptoms. Serum samples were obtained on admission and during the course of the disease or during follow-up of carrier status. Samples were analyzed for antibodies against diphtheria toxin with both an in vitro neutralization test (NT) and a human-specific enzyme immunoassay. All of the cases but one were confirmed by a positive culture. Twelve patients had pharyngeal diphtheria, and three had combined laryngeal and pharyngeal disease. Half of the patients had life-threatening disease, and one died. On admission, the median antibody titers measured with the NT were 0.085 IU/ml for the patients, 5.12 IU/ml for the symptomatic carriers, and 10.24 IU/ml for the healthy carriers. All of the diphtheria patients but one and nine of the carriers (six symptomatic and three healthy) had increased antibody levels during the first 7 to 10 days after admission. No obvious correlation was revealed between the antibody level or its kinetics and the course of the disease. Antibody levels on admission of >1 IU/ml were associated with a low risk of diphtheria."

Because the use of cervical and neck computed tomography (CT) has become routine in the emergency setting, knowledge of the imaging findings of common acute conditions of the head and neck is essential to ensure an accurate diagnosis of these potentially life-threatening conditions, which include oral cavity infections, tonsillitis and peritonsillar abscess, sialadenitis, parotiditis, diskitis, thrombophlebitis, periorbital and orbital cellulitis, infectious cervical lymphadenopathy, and various neoplasms. Less common conditions that require rapid diagnosis and treatment include epiglottitis, invasive fungal sinusitis, angioedema, and deep neck abscess. Familiarity with these conditions enables the radiologist to make a prompt diagnosis, assess the extent of disease, and evaluate for potential complications. CT is the first-line imaging modality in the emergency setting; however, magnetic resonance imaging plays an important secondary role."
CD010502,0,3931412,0,"Genetic transformation in Streptococcus sanguis. Identification, surface spreading and competence of invasive strains of Streptococcus sanguis Lancefield groups H and W and other invasive viridans streptococci.","Of 46 viridans streptococci isolated from cases of probably true bacteremia, 26 strains or 56% could be grouped serologically in the Lancefield system. Eight strains (17%) were identified as serogroup H (characteristic of Streptococcus sanguis), ten strains (22%) as serogroup W (a new group antigen found in S. sanguis) and eight strains (17%) as serogroup K (related to S. mitis (mitior)). The high number of serogroupable viridans streptococci was specially due to the introduction of serogroup W and indicates the importance of this serogroup in cases of bacteremia. A set of six diagnostic tests (production of hydrogen peroxide, arginine and esculin hydrolysis, polysaccharide production, Voges-Proskauer reaction, mannitol fermentation) was used for speciation of the viridans streptococci; in addition, search for spreading zones around the colonies was included in the diagnostic procedure. Spreading zones were only present in S. sanguis and occurred more frequently in group H strains than group W strains. The 46 viridans streptococci were tested in genetic transformation. The prevalence of spontaneous competence in strains isolated from the blood was high, particularly in S. sanguis serogroup H (88%) and W (50%). For serogroup H, spontaneous competence was found as frequently among invasive strains as among carrier isolates previously studied."
CD010502,0,1500078,0,[Epidemiology and pathogenesis of streptococcal infection].,"The appearance of the ""streptococcal toxic shock-like syndrome"" led to a growing interest in infections caused by Streptococcus pyogenes (group-A-streptococci). Since 1987 some 800 cases with a lethality of 20% or more were observed. Contrary to toxic scarlet fever the site of primary infection are the lower respiratory tract or soft tissue infections. Erythrogenic toxins and low molecular weight mitogens, inducing cytokines (IL-2, IL-3, IL-6, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma) seem to be involved in the pathogenesis of these severe infections. Morphologically and culturally the strains isolated from cases of toxic shock-like syndrome cannot be differentiated from isolates of epidemic scarlet fever or sporadic cases. At the same time, when in Scandinavia an epidemic by S.pyogenes type 1 with many cases of toxic shock was observed, the same type caused a scarlet fever epidemic without complications in eastern Germany. Erythrogenic toxin type A or its toxoid, respectively, can be used for successful immunizations of rabbits. Another--antibacterial-immunization can be done with the M-protein of S.pyogenes, which is limited by its type-specificity. Streptococcal vaccination is required especially for developing countries with a high incidence of rheumatic fever. Infections due to Streptococcus agalactiae (group-B streptococci) are often underestimated though they have a first position in septicemia and meningitis of newborns. Taxonomy and nomenclature of streptococci are often changing; a list of the presently known species is presented in table I."

Group A-specific polysaccharide adsorbed onto treated polystyrene beads, in conjunction with rabbit antibody to S. pyogenes, was used to determine the presence of the polysaccharide antigen. Inhibition values in excess of 65% were observed with 10(4) or more CFU of S. pyogenes per test. An inhibition of 25% was demonstrated with as few as 10(3) CFU per test. Heterologous microorganisms tested at 10(6) CFU per test reacted at levels of inhibition less than 25%. Two types of bacterial transport medium and swabs of different fiber compositions did not alter the assay performance. Accurate identification of S. pyogenes was achieved by testing single colonies picked directly from blood agar plates which had been incubated for 18 to 24 h. In addition, the assay was performed on throat specimens from children and adults having pharyngitis. A single-swab, blind study was conducted in which enzyme immunoassay reactivity was compared with results of blood agar culture and bacitracin sensitivity. When there were discordant results, serological identification was used as the confirmatory test. At an optimal cutoff value of 40% inhibition, sensitivity and specificity by enzyme immunoassay were 97.0% and 97.9%, respectively, as compared with confirmed culture results. The assay has an incubation time of 3 h and is a sensitive and specific method for the detection of S. pyogenes antigen."
CD010502,0,8301200,0,Comparison of antibody activity against various microorganisms in intravenous immunoglobulin preparations determined by ELISA and opsonic assay.,"In the present study the level of antimicrobial antibodies and the phagocytosis-promoting activity in immunoglobulin preparations produced for intravenous use were assessed. The level of antibodies directed against various microorganisms in six immunoglobulin preparations was determined by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and was shown to be either equal to or higher than that of pooled normal human serum. All preparations were able to promote phagocytosis of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli K12, and Streptococcus pyogenes by human granulocytes. Substantial differences among the various preparations in antibody activity were noted. In particular, Intraglobulin, chemically modified by beta-propiolactone treatment, exhibited little activity in both the ELISA and the phagocytosis assay. In contrast, IVIG SRC, Gamimmune, Sandoglobulin (treated at low pH in presence or absence of trace amounts of pepsin), and Gammagard (treated by ion-exchange chromatography) showed good activity in both assays. Comparison of the results of the ELISA and phagocytosis assay for the various preparations indicated a good correlation except for S. aureus with a moderate (strain 42D) or high (strain Cowan I) protein A content. These data indicate that the antibody activity of immunoglobulin preparations against various microorganisms determined by ELISA can be used to predict their opsonic activity."

CD010502,0,8619422,0,Lymphoid changes of the nasopharyngeal and palatine tonsils that are indicative of human immunodeficiency virus infection. A clinicopathologic study of 12 cases.,"We report 12 cases in which the histomorphologic changes of the nasopharyngeal tonsils (adenoids) or palatine tonsils suggest infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The patients included 10 men and two women, aged 20 to 42 years (median, 33 years). The clinical presentation included airway obstruction, pharyngitis, fever, and a tonsillar or adenoidal mass lesion. Histologic evaluation of the excised adenoids or tonsils in 10 of the cases demonstrated a spectrum of changes including florid follicular hyperplasia, follicle lysis, attenuated mantle zone, and the presence of multinucleated giant cells (MGC). The latter characteristically localized adjacent to the surface or tonsillar crypt epithelium. Two of the 12 cases showed marked lymphoid depletion with absent germinal centers, plasmacytosis, and stromal vascular proliferation. Immunohistochemical evaluation for HIV p24 core protein showed reactivity in 10 of 12 cases localized to follicular dendritic cell network (FDC), the MGC, scattered interfollicular lymphoid cells, and cells identified within the surface or crypt epithelium. Localization of viral RNA by in situ hybridization paralleled the HIV p24 immunohistochemical findings. Additional significant findings included the presence of both CD-68 and S-100 protein in the MGC and the presence of S-100 protein in dendritic cells. Other than HIV, no microorganisms were identified. At the time of presentation, eight patients were not known to be a risk for HIV infection, nor were they known to be HIV infected or suffering from AIDS. In these patients, HIV infection was suspected on the basis of the histologic changes seen in the resected tonsillar and adenoidal tissue. Serologic evaluation (by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay), confirmed the presence of HIV infection. Our findings suggest the possibility of HIV dissemination through the upper aero-digestive tract mucosa via target cells, such as intraepithelial dendritic cells, submucosal macrophages, and T-lymphocytes. Subsequent presentation of viral antigens to the tonsillar and adenoidal lymphoid tissues results in enlargement of these structures that clinically may simulate a neoplastic proliferation but causes histomorphologic changes that are highly suspicious for HIV infection even in asymptomatic HIV-positive patients."

CD010502,0,1734045,1,Rapid detection of group A streptococci: comparative performance by nurses and laboratory technologists in pediatric satellite laboratories using three test kits.,"Rapid tests for detecting group A streptococci in throat swabs are often performed outside hospitals or commercial laboratories by individuals with little or no technical training. We compared the abilities of nurses and technologists to perform and interpret three commercial kits (Directigen 1-2-3, ICON Strep A, and Culturette Brand 10-Minute Strep A ID) in three hospital satellite locations (the emergency department, a walk-in emergency clinic, and a general pediatric clinic). When the three tests were compared with culture, the sensitivities of the tests as performed by nurses and technologists, respectively, were 39 versus 44% for Directigen, 55 versus 51% for Culturette, and 72 versus 39% for ICON. A significant difference in sensitivity was found only with ICON tests. This result was largely explained by the tendency of technologists to test moist swabs, while nurses generally processed dry swabs; ICON test sensitivity was significantly greater with dry swabs. The specificities of Directigen and ICON tests performed by nurses and technologists were high (97 to 100%). The difference in the specificities of the Culturette test as determined from results obtained by nurses and technologists (80 versus 98%) was due to the tendency of one nurse to overinterpret the latex agglutination reaction. Analysis of the accuracies of the tests during practice periods compared with the accuracies of the tests during the study periods revealed statistically significant improvement in test performance. We conclude that these tests are specific but not sensitive when performed by nurses and technologists in satellite laboratories. With one exception, nurses and technologists performed the tests with comparable accuracy after brief training periods."

Non-susceptibility is associated with various point mutations in the target-encoding genes and has only been described in a few emm types. We used a well-characterised GAS clinical paediatric collection from Brussels (Belgium) and Brasília (Brazil) to analyse the molecular basis of FQ non-susceptibility. GAS strains were tested for ciprofloxacin susceptibility and were screened for mutations in DNA gyrase- and topoisomerase IV-encoding genes. Genetic relationships between the different emm types were assessed by phylogenetic analysis of the whole surface-exposed part of the M protein. A high proportion (22.5%) of ciprofloxacin-non-susceptible isolates (minimal inhibitory concentration > or = 2mg/L) was found among the Belgian strains. They belonged mostly to emm type 6 (87%). In Brazil, 6% of the isolates, belonging to seven distantly related emm types, were non-susceptible. Our phylogenetic analysis showed that non-susceptibility may arise in various genetic backgrounds. Sequence comparison of the quinolone resistance-determining regions (QRDRs) of the ParC- and ParE-encoding genes from susceptible and non-susceptible isolates revealed that most of the mutations were found in both classes of isolates, indicating an emm type-linked polymorphism. In conclusion, we observed a clonal spreading of non-susceptible emm type 6 GAS strains in Brussels and a polyclonal distribution of non-susceptible isolates in Brazil. All the Brazilian and Belgian emm type 6 strains displayed a S79A/F mutation in parC that convincingly explains the non-susceptible phenotype."
CD010502,0,10706638,0,A nonpeptide integrin antagonist can inhibit epithelial cell ingestion of Streptococcus pyogenes by blocking formation of integrin alpha 5beta 1-fibronectin-M1 protein complexes.,"Streptococcus pyogenes can be efficiently internalized by a variety of human epithelial cells. beta-lactam antibiotics, commonly used to treat S. pyogenes infections, do not readily permeate mammalian cells. There is growing evidence that the ability of streptococci to enter host cells contributes to the frequent failure of antibiotics to eradicate the organism from infected individuals. Recent studies have suggested that host cell entry requires the formation of a complex of a bacterial fibronectin (Fn) binding protein (e.g., M1 protein or protein F1/SfbI), human Fn, and the epithelial cell Fn receptor, integrin alpha5beta1. We report here that a low molecular weight, nonpeptide antagonist of integrin alpha5beta1, SJ755, can inhibit internalization of streptococci by primary human tonsillar epithelial cells and immortalized human epithelial (A549) cells, thus increasing the extent of bacterial killing by antibiotics. SJ755 blocked Fn binding by human tonsillar epithelial and A549 cells, suggesting that integrin alpha5beta1 is the major Fn receptor expressed by both cell types. SJ755 did not affect Fn binding by purified M1 protein or M1(+) bacteria. Purified M1 protein failed to associate with integrin alpha5beta1 unless the integrin had been prebound by Fn. Also, SJ755 blocked formation of alpha5beta1-Fn-M1 complexes in vitro. These results support the previous proposal that Fn functions as a molecular bridge between M1 protein and integrin alpha5beta1. Furthermore, these results suggest that integrin antagonists may enhance the efficacy of antibiotics in treatment of S. pyogenes infections."

CD010502,0,9602866,0,Peripheral blood lymphocytes from psoriatic patients are hyporesponsive to beta-streptococcal superantigens.,"The strong association of acute guttate psoriasis and streptococcal throat infection, together with the preferential use of T cells expressing a particular T-cell receptor, has suggested a role for bacterial superantigens in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. We examined the proliferative responses of peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs), obtained from patients with psoriasis and from healthy controls, to streptococcal superantigens, cytoplasmic membrane-associated protein (CAP) and secretion-type CAP (SCAP), isolated from group A, beta-haemolytic streptococci. PBLs from patients with psoriasis showed significantly less response to SCAP and CAP than those from healthy controls. Because there was no difference between psoriatic patients and controls in the proliferative response of PBLs to staphylococcal enterotoxin A or E (SEA, SEE) or the mitogen phytohaemagglutinin (PHA), these findings strongly suggest that the reduced reactivity to the streptococcal superantigens seems to reflect anergy of a population of PBLs to the superantigens. As the CAP used in the present study stimulates V beta 8 T cells selectively, we further examined the proliferation of V beta 8 T cells after such stimulation using flow cytometry. V beta 8 T cells obtained from three of four psoriatic patients failed to proliferate in the presence of CAP, whereas they proliferated vigorously in the presence of SEE, which activates V beta 8 T cells, confirming the specific hyporesponsiveness of PBLs from psoriatic patients to streptococcal superantigens. We then determined the effects of serum factors on the suppressed response of PBLs to the streptococcal superantigens with SCAP or CAP. It was partially restored when PBLs were cultured with sera obtained from healthy subjects, although the responses were still significantly lower than those of the healthy controls. In contrast, psoriatic sera markedly suppressed the proliferative response of PBLs from healthy controls to CAP or SCAP, but showed no suppression of the proliferative response of PBLs to SEA. Because these findings suggest the presence of specific inhibitory factors in psoriatic sera, we examined whether the inhibitory effect was caused by antisuperantigen antibody. However, no significant increase was detected in antibody titre to CAP in psoriatic sera, as has been noted in sera from patients with poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis. The present results show for the first time the hyporesponsiveness of PBLs to streptococcal superantigens and the presence of serum inhibitors that specifically inhibit T-cell response to the superantigens in psoriatic patients. These findings suggest a pathological role for streptococcal infections in the pathogenesis of psoriasis."

CD010502,0,7861955,0,The fibronectin binding domain of the Sfb protein adhesin of Streptococcus pyogenes occurs in many group A streptococci and does not cross-react with heart myosin.,"Sfb protein, a fibronectin binding adhesin of Streptococcus pyogenes (Lancefield group A streptococcus), mediates streptococcal adherence to human epithelial cells via its fibronectin binding domain coded by a repetitive gene region named fnbr. In the present study, Southern blot analysis using the fnbr gene region as a probe to screen genomic DNA from 51 epidemiologically unrelated clinical isolates of S. pyogenes revealed that 70% carried a sequence homologous to the fnbr probe. Among ten other streptococcal strains belonging to serological groups B, C, and G, DNA from only two human S. equisimilis (group C) strains reacted with the probe. Further analysis by PCR-mediated amplification of the binding repeat coding sequences revealed that repeats of different S. pyogenes isolates were identical in size but varied in number, ranging from one to five. Most of the isolates were shown to carry multiple repeats. Presence of the probe-positive sequence correlated strongly with streptococcal binding to purified fibronectin and adherence to HEp2 human epithelial cells; of the 36 probe-positive isolates, 95% bound fibronectin and 89% adhered strongly to epithelial cells, whereas among the 15 probe-negative isolates only 27% had binding activities for fibronectin and 27% showed strong adherence to HEp2 cells. Antibodies raised against the fibronectin binding domain of Sfb protein recognized streptococcal fibronectin binding surface proteins in most of the clinical isolates but did not react with heart or skeletal muscle myosin in an enzyme immunoassay, as is the case with antibodies directed to M protein, another major surface protein of group A streptococci. The results of the present study suggest that Sfb protein could be a potential candidate for a streptococcal vaccine."

CD010502,0,2936307,0,Crosslinking of actin filaments and inhibition of actomyosin subfragment-1 ATPase activity by streptococcal M6 protein.,"M proteins are antiphagocytic molecules on the surface of group A streptococci having physical characteristics similar to those of mammalian tropomyosin. Both are alpha-helical coiled-coil fibrous structures with a similar seven-residue periodicity of nonpolar and charged amino acids. To determine if M protein is functionally similar to tropomyosin we studied the interaction of M protein with F-actin. At low ionic strength, M protein binds to actin weakly with a stoichiometry different from that of tropomyosin. M protein does not compete with tropomyosin for the binding to actin, indicating that it is functionally different from tropomyosin. M protein does compete with myosin subfragment-1 for binding to actin and induces the formation of bundles of actin filaments. The formation of actin aggregates is associated with a sharp reduction in the rate of ATP hydrolysis by subfragment-1. Intact streptococci having M protein on their surface are shown to bind to actin."

CD010502,0,8820681,0,[The differentiation of the antigens making up the circulating immune complexes].,"A simple method for the detection and analysis of circulating immune complexes (CIC) in specimens of biological fluids is proposed. The method was approved in the examination of patients with chronic infections caused by mycoplasmas and Streptococcus pyogenes L-forms. The method made it possible to diagnose infectious diseases accompanied by the formation of immune complexes and to study the dynamics of the processes of the accumulation and elimination of CIC in the course of the disease. Thus, the detection rate of specific antigens (Ag) incorporated into CIC in patients with mycoplasmal pneumonia exceeded 90 %. In children aged up to 1 year this rate decreased to 40 %. The diagnostic value of the determination of specific Ag incorporated into CIC was shown in streptococcal infections caused by S.pyogenes L-forms, viz. in frequently relapsing erysipelas, as well as in subacute rheumatism and in infectious allergic myocarditis."
CD010502,0,16177339,0,Functions of cell surface-anchored antigen I/II family and Hsa polypeptides in interactions of Streptococcus gordonii with host receptors.,"Streptococcus gordonii colonizes multiple sites within the human oral cavity. This colonization depends upon the initial interactions of streptococcal adhesins with host receptors. The adhesins that bind salivary agglutinin glycoprotein (gp340) and human cell surface receptors include the antigen I/II (AgI/II) family polypeptides SspA and SspB and a sialic acid-binding surface protein designated Hsa or GspB. In this study we determined the relative functions of the AgI/II polypeptides and Hsa in interactions of S. gordonii DL1 (Challis) with host receptors. For an isogenic mutant with the sspA and sspB genes deleted the levels of adhesion to surface-immobilized gp340 were reduced 40%, while deletion of the hsa gene alone resulted in >80% inhibition of bacterial cell adhesion to gp340. Adhesion of S. gordonii DL1 cells to gp340 was sialidase sensitive, verifying that Hsa has a major role in mediating sialic acid-specific adhesion to gp340. Conversely, aggregation of S. gordonii cells by fluid-phase gp340 was not affected by deletion of hsa but was eliminated by deletion of the sspA and sspB genes. Deletion of the AgI/II polypeptide genes had no measurable effect on hsa mRNA levels or Hsa surface protein expression, and deletion of hsa did not affect AgI/II polypeptide expression. Further analysis of mutant phenotypes showed that the Hsa and AgI/II proteins mediated adhesion of S. gordonii DL1 to human HEp-2 epithelial cells. Hsa was also a principal streptococcal cell surface component promoting adhesion of human platelets to immobilized streptococci, but Hsa and AgI/II polypeptides acted in concert in mediating streptococcal cell-platelet aggregation. The results suggest that Hsa directs primary adhesion events for S. gordonii DL1 (Challis) with immobilized gp340, epithelial cells, and platelets. AgI/II polypeptides direct gp340-mediated aggregation, facilitate multimodal interactions necessary for platelet aggregation, and modulate S. gordonii-host engagements into biologically productive phenomena."

The Streptex latex test kit for the detection of group B streptococcal (GBS) antigen in admission body fluid specimens was evaluated for sensitivity and specificity in 54 infants with meningitis and in 10 infants with normal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) parameters. GBS antigen was detected in 22 of 28 (78.6%) CSF specimens by latex agglutination and in 23 of 28 (82.1%) by countercurrent immunoelectrophoresis. Antigen was present in 21 of 28 (latex agglutination) and 19 of 26 (countercurrent immunoelectrophoresis) CSF specimens after the initiation of antimicrobial therapy. Heat-labile factors accounted for nonspecific agglutination reactions with latex suspensions other than group B in 3 of 28 CSF samples from patients with GBS meningitis. These nonspecific reactions were readily eliminated by heating specimens for 10 min at 100 degrees C. Fifteen patients with GBS meningitis had admission serum and urine samples collected in addition to CSF. Antigen was detected by latex agglutination and countercurrent immunoelelectrophoresis in 14 of 15 (93.3%) and 13 of 15 (86.7%) concentrated urine specimens, respectively, and in 12 of 15 (80%) CSF specimens and 4 of 15 (27%) sera by each method.

In each uveitis and controls, and between active and inactive stages of all uveitis, there were no differences between titers. In Behçet's disease, antibody formation to Streptococcus pyogenes L-form may be specifically disturbed."
CD010502,0,11035959,0,Expression and purification of histidine-tagged proteins from the gram-positive Streptococcus gordonii SPEX system.,"Streptococcus gordonii (S. gordonii) has been used as a gram-positive bacterial expression vector for secreted or surface-anchored recombinant proteins. Fusion of the gram-positive bacterial N-terminal signal sequence to the target protein is all that is required for efficient export. This system is termed SPEX for Surface Protein EXpression and has been used to express proteins for a variety of uses. In this study, the SPEX system has been further developed by the construction of vectors that express polyhistidine-tagged fusion proteins. SPEX vectors were constructed with an N-terminal or C-terminal histidine tag. The C-repeat region (CRR) from Streptococcus pyogenes M6 protein and the Staphylococcus aureus nuclease A (NucA) enzyme were tested for expression. The fusion proteins were purified using metal affinity chromatography (MAC). Results show that the fusion proteins were expressed and secreted from S. gordonii with the His tag at either the N- or C-terminal position and could be purified using MAC. The M6 fusions retained immunoreactivity after expression and purification as determined by immunoblots and ELISA analyses. In addition, NucA fusions retained functional activity after MAC purification. The M6-His and NucA-His fusions were purified approximately 15- and 10-fold respectively with approximately 30% recovery of protein using MAC. This study shows that the polyhistidine tag in either the N- or C-terminal position is a viable way to purify secreted heterologous proteins from the supernatant of recombinant S. gordonii cultures. This study further illustrates the value of the SPEX system for secreted expression and purification of proteins."
CD010502,0,16895610,0,Bactericidal activity of M protein conserved region antibodies against group A streptococcal isolates from the Northern Thai population.,"Most group A streptococcal (GAS) vaccine strategies have focused on the surface M protein, a major virulence factor of GAS. The amino-terminus of the M protein elicits antibodies, that are both opsonic and protective, but which are type specific. J14, a chimeric peptide that contains 14 amino acids from the M protein conserved C-region at the carboxy-terminus, offers the possibility of a vaccine which will elicit protective opsonic antibodies against multiple different GAS strains. In this study, we searched for J14 and J14-like sequences and the number of their repeats in the C-region of the M protein from GAS strains isolated from the Northern Thai population. Then, we examined the bactericidal activity of J14, J14.1, J14-R1 and J14-R2 antisera against multiple Thai GAS strains."

Except for very low levels to tropomyosin, antibodies to other antigens were not elevated in the sera of ARF patients relative to those of non-ARF patients, even though there was roughly equivalent exposure to group A streptococci. This suggests that antibodies to these molecules may not play a central role in the induction of ARF."

CD010502,0,19617361,0,The laminin-binding protein Lbp from Streptococcus pyogenes is a zinc receptor.,"The common pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes colonizes the human skin and tonsils and can invade underlying tissues. This requires the adhesion of S. pyogenes to host surface receptors mediated through adhesins. The laminin-binding protein Lbp has been suggested as an adhesin, specific for the human extracellular matrix protein laminin. Sequence alignments, however, indicate a relationship between Lbp and a family of bacterial metal-binding receptors. To further analyze the role of Lbp in S. pyogenes and its potential role in pathogenicity, Lbp has been crystallized, and its structure has been solved at a resolution of 2.45 A (R = 0.186; R(free) = 0.251). Lbp has the typical metal-binding receptor fold, comprising two globular (beta/alpha)(4) domains connected by a helical backbone. The two domains enclose the metal-binding site, which contains a zinc ion. The interaction of Lbp with laminin was further investigated and shown to be specific in vitro. Localization studies with antibodies specific for Lbp show that the protein is attached to the membrane. The data suggest that Lbp is primarily a zinc-binding protein, and we suggest that its interaction with laminin in vivo may be mediated via zinc bound to laminin."
CD010502,0,7045215,0,Why type streptococci? The epidemiology of group A streptococci in Oxfordshire 1976-1980.,"The results of typing all group A streptococci isolated in one laboratory in 5 years were reviewed to see if the collected information showed epidemiological patterns. The great majority of the 5858 streptococci typed came from patients seen in general practice: 72% from throat swabs and 11% from skin lesions. Eight types, M types 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12, 22 and type 28 R accounted for 65% of strains. These eight types had different patterns: types 2 and 6 caused small circumscribed outbreaks and were uncommon between epidemics; types 3, 4 and 12 caused larger, wider epidemics, whereas types 1, 22 and 28 R had a more stable pattern. Type 4 was more commonly resistant to tetracycline than most other types, a finding which affected the apparent incidence of tetracycline resistance in group A streptococci. Streptococci from superficial sites were more likely to have serum opacity factor and to lack a detectable M-antigen than strains isolated from the throat. Routine typing of streptococci helped to detect outbreaks of infection in special groups. It is concluded that regular streptococcal typing should be continued in some places."

CD010502,0,6418655,0,Induction of human gamma interferon by structurally defined polypeptide fragments of group A streptococcal M protein.,"The presence of interferon (IFN) has been demonstrated previously (i) in fluids obtained from the middle ears of children with Streptococcus pneumoniae infections, (ii) from the serum of mice injected intraperitoneally with either S. pneumoniae or Streptococcus pyogenes, and (iii) from human lymphoid cell cultures treated with a variety of bacteria. In this study, we showed that highly purified peptic extracts of three different serotypes of group A streptococcal M protein (pep M5, pep M6, and pep M24) stimulated human peripheral leukocytes to produce IFN. IFN production was apparent by 10 h and peaked 24 h after exposure. Dose-response experiments indicated that IFN could be detected in cultures treated with concentrations of M protein as low as 6 micrograms/ml, whereas maximum IFN production occurred at a concentration of 200 micrograms/ml. The IFN had antigenic and physicochemical characteristics of IFN-gamma. Preliminary leukocyte fractionation studies revealed that the IFN-producing cell was a nonadherent lymphocyte with receptors for sheep erythrocytes (T cell). Rabbit antisera specific for these structurally defined polypeptide fragments of streptococcal M protein (pep M5, pep M6, and pep M24) blocked IFN induction by each of the polypeptides. The data suggest that the different serotypes of streptococcal M protein may induce IFN by a common structural determinant shared by each of the polypeptide fragments tested."

Those with throat cultures positive for group A Streptococci (GAS) were followed for 5 weeks. Repeat throat swabs were obtained at weekly intervals for antigen detection and culture. GAS obtained were serotyped for T antigen. Twenty-two children were identified as having GAS and 50% had a positive antigen test and culture at least five times in 6 weeks. There was no consistent pattern in the typeable organisms. Most individuals had more than one T-type alternating with non-T-typeable organisms. We conclude that colonization may be a dynamic process involving numerous organism serotypes, which wax and wane."

The organisms were shown to produce endostreptosin, a recently discovered cytoplasmic antigen of certain beta-haemolytic streptococci that has been shown to be of prime importance in the development of poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN). Serological testing of the patients showed raised and persistent antibody tires to this substance. These findings substantiate the association, suggested by the epidemiological features of a similar outbreak that occurred in Rumania in 1968, between Strep zooepidemicus and nephritis. As in several previous reports of Strep zooepidemicus in man, infection appeared to have been acquired by the consumption of unpasteurized milk. This outbreak implicates non-group-A streptococci in the aetiology of PSGN."

The virus infection could also be demonstrated in all nonimmune family members, most of whom gave a history of recent mild febrile disease (pharyngitis, diarrhea). Enterovirus infections may be suspected in cases of neonatal meningitis or myocarditis associated with gastrointestinal signs, especially 1. when it is during the hot season July-October, 2. when there has been febrile illness in other family members recently. For an effective and rapid isolation of the agent, rectal swabs or stool specimens not only from the patient, but also from household contacts should be sent to the virus laboratory on several consecutive days. Meningitic infection may be proved by an early c.s.f. sample. For serodiagnosis a first blood specimen should be drawn as soon as possible, a second one some days later.

A total of 217 GAS isolates were included: 155 and 62 isolates from throat and skin, respectively. A total of 78 different emm/st types were detected among the 217 isolates. Of these, 166 (76.5%) belonged to 52 validated reference emm types, 26 (11.9%) belonged to 16 already recognized sequence types (st types) and 25 (11.5%) belonged to 10 undocumented new sequence types. Resistance to tetracycline (148 of 217) was not correlated to emm type. Isolation rate of the classical rheumatogenic and nephritogenic strains was low from cases of acute rheumatic fever (ARF) and acute glomerulonephritis (AGN), respectively. Instead, the recently discovered st types were overrepresented among isolates from patients with ARF (3 of 7) and AGN (9 of 16) (P < 0.01) compared to isolates from subjects with tonsillitis and from healthy carriers (10 of 57 and 16 of 90, respectively). In contrast to rheumatogenic strains from the temperate regions, more than half of the isolates from ARF (four of seven) carried the genetic marker for skin preference, emm pattern D, although most of them (six of seven) were isolated from throat. Of 57 tonsillitis-associated isolates, 16 (28%) belonged to emm pattern D compared to <1% in temperate regions. As in other reports emm patterns A to C were strongly associated with throat, whereas emm pattern D did not correlate to skin.

Signs and symptoms of pharyngitis or tonsillitis were evaluated and throat cultures were obtained before treatment, once during treatment and 4 to 6 days and 19 to 25 days posttreatment. All GABHS isolates were susceptible in vitro to clarithromycin. Successful clinical responses at the end of treatment were demonstrated in 169 of 176 (96%) evaluable clarithromycin-treated patients and 179 of 191 (94%) evaluable penicillin-treated patients. GABHS was successfully eradicated at end of treatment in 168 of 183 (92%) evaluable clarithromycin-treated patients compared with 162 of 199 (81%) evaluable penicillin-treated patients (P = 0.004). There were no significant changes in hematologic or serum chemistry parameters in either group. Both drugs were well-tolerated. The incidence and nature of adverse events were similar in the clarithromycin and penicillin groups, except for gastrointestinal complaints reported in 35 of 250 (14%) clarithromycin recipients compared with 12 of 256 (5%) penicillin recipients (P < or = 0.001). The results indicate that twice daily clarithromycin was as safe and effective as three times daily penicillin VK in the treatment of children with streptococcal pharyngitis or tonsillitis.

Results of a multicenter double-blind placebo-controlled study.","A multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted to investigate the efficacy of an immunostimulant, Ribomunyl, in the prevention of recurrences of infectious rhinitis in adults. This trial involved 327 patients (168 Ribomunyl treated and 159 placebo cases) with an average of 4.3 +/- 1.8 rhinitis episodes per patient recorded during the year preceding the study. The main criterion of efficacy was the cumulative number of recurrences of infectious rhinitis during a 6-month follow-up period, as analyzed by standard tests. An additional analysis of relative risk of recurrences used multivariate failure for time data. Ribomunyl was effective throughout the study period, starting from the first month of treatment: a mean of 1.0 +/- 1.1 recurrences was recorded in the Ribomunyl group as compared to 1.5 +/- 1.4 recurrences in the placebo group; this indicated one-third fewer infections (P = 0.001). The protective effect of Ribomunyl on the relative risk for recurrences was estimated to be 0.58 by multivariate analysis (95% CI: 0.43-0.78, P = 0.0001). Analysis of secondary criteria also favored Ribomunyl: 38.5% less antibiotic courses per patient (0.8 +/- 1.3 vs 1.3 +/- 1.6; P = 0.002) and the number of days with antibiotics (5.6 +/- 9.3 vs 9.1 +/- 12.1; P = 0.002)."

CD010502,0,16860908,0,Physiochemical and functional characterization of antigen proteins eluted from aluminum hydroxide adjuvant.,"We have characterized protein antigens after quantitative dissociation from aluminum hydroxide adjuvant. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) and a multi-antigen vaccine for Group A Streptococcus (GrAS Vaccine) were formulated on aluminum hydroxide, stored for > or =10 days then eluted with a 48-h treatment at 4 degrees C with 0.85% H(3)PO(4) plus 4M guanidine HCl (GnHCl). BSA is recovered from adjuvant at 92+/-2%. GrAS antigens are equally recovered from GrAS Vaccine (95+/-11% of total protein expected using multiple lots stored for up to 12 months). Recovery after elution is similar when determined by RP-HPLC, SEC-HPLC, UV absorbance, or Bradford methods. Eluted antigens are structurally and functionally intact as judged relative to both treated and untreated antigen controls by SDS-PAGE, RP-HPLC, SEC-HPLC, and after desalting by circular dichroism, bis-ANS binding, and antigenicity determined by ELISA. When formulated and stored for a few weeks, BSA has more dimer (31+/-5%) relative to the elution control (9% dimer) as detected by SEC-HPLC, suggesting that BSA microaggregation is promoted on aluminum. Antigens eluted from very aged GrAS Vaccine (>12 months) show marked changes by RP-HPLC. Structural changes in the antigens under elution conditions were evaluated using bis-ANS, a fluorescent probe of protein structure. Binding of bis-ANS increases fluorescence approximately 100-fold and is significantly diminished with increasing GnHCl concentrations indicating a progressive denaturing of the proteins. At 4M GnHCl (with or without 0.85% H(3)PO(4)) the GrAS antigens are fully denatured and BSA is partially denatured. Interestingly, the addition of 0.85% H(3)PO(4) increases bis-ANS binding on GrAS antigens and reduces the denaturing of GrAS antigens and BSA by chaotropes. Desalting or diluting the eluted antigens results in renaturing of the proteins as judged by bis-ANS fluorescence, circular dichroism and antigenicity testing. The elution method provides a novel approach for high recovery and characterization of GrAS Vaccine antigens and may be applicable to the study of many aluminum hydroxide-bound vaccines."

Bacterial antigens are suspect in the aetiology of rheumatic diseases. The responsiveness of the mononuclear cell fraction of peripheral blood and synovial fluid of patients with RA and of patients with rheumatic diseases other than RA to bacterial antigens such as cell wall fragments of the anaerobic intestinal flora, cell wall fragments of Streptococcus pyogenes, intestinal flora derived peptidoglycan polysaccharide complexes, the 65 kilodalton protein of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and muramyldipeptide was investigated. No significant difference in response was found to all these bacterial antigens in the synovial fluid of patients with RA compared with the responses in patients with other rheumatic diseases. The highest responsiveness in the synovial fluid of the patients with RA was to the streptococcal cell wall fragments and to the 65 kilodalton protein. Higher responses to several bacterial antigens in the synovial fluid of patients with RA were found compared with peripheral blood from the same patient group. The antigen presenting cell population of the synovial fluid in patients with RA and the patients with other rheumatic diseases was found to be stimulatory for autologous peripheral blood T cells even in the absence of antigen. This suggests an important role for the synovial antigen presenting cell in the aetiology of inflammatory joint diseases."
CD010502,0,10931281,0,Generation of a mature streptococcal cysteine proteinase is dependent on cell wall-anchored M1 protein.,"In the present study, we have generated a mutant strain of Streptococcus pyogenes, MC25, which lacks M protein on its surface, and we demonstrate that this strain is unable to generate a mature 28 kDa cysteine proteinase. Furthermore, we show that S. pyogenes bacteria of M1 serotype are dependent on cell wall-anchored M protein to cleave the secreted zymogen into a mature cysteine proteinase. We also show that MC25 secretes a 40 kDa zymogen, having a conformation different from that secreted by wild-type bacteria. We provide data showing that the cleavage site is not blocked but, presumably, the active site is. This suggests that M protein, when anchored to the cell wall, is involved in the unfolding of the zymogen and generation of a mature cysteine proteinase that can be activated under reducing conditions. Our data add new aspects to the interaction between two important virulence factors of S. pyogenes, the streptococcal cysteine proteinase and M protein."

In addition, a significant decrease was documented in both proportions and total numbers of OKT8(+) putative suppressor cells during acute rheumatic attacks. C-reactive protein binding to T-lymphocyte subsets showed no preferential reactivity in vivo for suppressor or helper T cells. Antigen-reactive T lymphocytes identified with the T29 mouse hybridoma reagent showed similar proportions and numbers in rheumatic children as were noted in controls. The present data indicate profound alterations in both helper- and suppressor-cell types in the peripheral blood profile of children with acute rheumatic fever."

The proteins were extracted by trypsin digestion and purified by precipitations and gel filtration and testing was based on enzyme immunoassays. The immune antibodies showed specificity for the corresponding protein, targeted that protein in Western blotting and recognized their targets after heat treatment (100 degrees C) of the proteins. Human antibodies in a commercial gammaglobulin preparation targeted a site(s) common to c(alpha) and R4. This target failed to bind the antibodies in Western blotting and was destroyed by heating. c(alpha)- and R4-reactive antibodies in sera from healthy pregnant women recognized the common, heat-labile determinant(s), but contained little or no antibodies against the heat-stable c(alpha)- or R4-specific determinants. These results are consistent with the notions that (i) the normal human antibodies and the immunization-induced animal antibodies targeted different sites on the c(alpha) and R4 proteins and that (ii) the natural human antibodies targeted conformational epitopes and the immune antibodies targeted linear epitopes. These findings are important for further clarification of GBS immunology and immunoprotection in humans."

CD010502,0,9788813,0,Streptococcal emm types associated with T-agglutination types and the use of conserved emm gene restriction fragment patterns for subtyping group A streptococci.,"The T-agglutination types were determined for a diverse collection of 1531 group A streptococci for which the 5' M protein gene (emm) sequences had been analysed. The majority of the T-agglutination types correlated with previously seen M/emm/T-type associations; however, several new associations were found. Analysis of a subset of this collection -- which included 1157 clinical isolates with multiply encountered emm types -- found that emm amplicon restriction profiles of isolates sharing identical T types and opacity factor phenotypes are useful for detecting groups of isolates with identical emm genes. Many emm genes of known 5' sequence display a highly conserved restriction pattern amongst clinical isolates widely separated both geographically and temporally."
CD010502,0,21655249,0,"The membrane bound LRR lipoprotein Slr, and the cell wall-anchored M1 protein from Streptococcus pyogenes both interact with type I collagen.","Streptococcus pyogenes is an important human pathogen and surface structures allow it to adhere to, colonize and invade the human host. Proteins containing leucine rich repeats (LRR) have been identified in mammals, viruses, archaea and several bacterial species. The LRRs are often involved in protein-protein interaction, are typically 20-30 amino acids long and the defining feature of the LRR motif is an 11-residue sequence LxxLxLxxNxL (x being any amino acid). The streptococcal leucine rich (Slr) protein is a hypothetical lipoprotein that has been shown to be involved in virulence, but at present no ligands for Slr have been identified. We could establish that Slr is a membrane attached horseshoe shaped lipoprotein by homology modeling, signal peptidase II inhibition, electron microscopy (of bacteria and purified protein) and immunoblotting. Based on our previous knowledge of LRR proteins we hypothesized that Slr could mediate binding to collagen. We could show by surface plasmon resonance that recombinant Slr and purified M1 protein bind with high affinity to collagen I. Isogenic slr mutant strain (MB1) and emm1 mutant strain (MC25) had reduced binding to collagen type I as shown by slot blot and surface plasmon resonance. Electron microscopy using gold labeled Slr showed multiple binding sites to collagen I, both to the monomeric and the fibrillar structure, and most binding occurred in the overlap region of the collagen I fibril. In conclusion, we show that Slr is an abundant membrane bound lipoprotein that is co-expressed on the surface with M1, and that both these proteins are involved in recruiting collagen type I to the bacterial surface. This underlines the importance of S. pyogenes interaction with extracellular matrix molecules, especially since both Slr and M1 have been shown to be virulence factors."
CD010502,0,6708085,0,M-associated protein antibodies in patients with rheumatic fever.,"Sequential serum samples obtained from 50 rheumatic fever subjects and from control individuals matched for time, age and geographical location were tested for antibodies against the M-associated protein antigens, MAP I and MAP II. Antibody titres were determined by the complement fixation test with a partially-purified extract of Streptococcus pyogenes serotype M30 as the MAP I antigen and an acid extract of serotype M48 as the MAP II antigen. Titres of MAP I antibody exceeded those of MAP II antibody in all but six rheumatic fever subjects. Anti-MAP I titres in excess of 40 were significantly more common in rheumatic fever subjects than in matched controls (p less than 0.001) or matched subjects with a diagnosis of acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (p less than 0.01). Peak MAP I titres were present at the time of admission to hospital in the sera of 40 of the 50 rheumatic fever subjects. In the remainder peak titres occurred within 10 days. Antibody titres were maintained for a mean of 10.3 weeks before declining. Changes in MAP antibody titres were independent of changes in antistreptolysin O and anti-DNAase B titres. Normal children aged between 6 and 15 had higher MAP antibody titres than 2-5-year-old children. Rheumatic fever subjects had significantly higher mean titres of MAP I antibody than matched controls in each age group."

Immunoglobulin G antibodies were found in 72% of sera from patients with SLO antibodies higher than 333 Todd units (TU), and IgA antibodies were also detected in 53%, but no IgM antibodies were demonstrable. High copositivity (0.94), conegativity (0.97), and positive (0.96) and negative (0.96) predictive values were observed when IgG and IgA findings were combined. The dot ELISA gave highly reproducible results. The present data suggest that the assay may be of practical value for routine detection of SLO antibodies when employed with an anti-human immunoglobulin light chain peroxidase conjugate."

CD010502,0,22433673,0,"Streptococcal M1 protein-provoked CXC chemokine formation, neutrophil recruitment and lung damage are regulated by Rho-kinase signaling.","Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome is frequently caused by Streptococcus pyogenes of the M1 serotype. The aim of this study was to determine the role of Ras-homologous (Rho)-kinase signaling in M1 protein-provoked lung damage. Male C57BL/6 mice received the Rho-kinase-specific inhibitor Y-27632 before administration of M1 protein. Edema, neutrophil accumulation and CXC chemokines were quantified in the lung 4 h after M1 protein challenge. Flow cytometry was used to determine Mac-1 expression. Quantitative RT-PCR was used to determine gene expression of CXC chemokine mRNA in alveolar macrophages. M1 protein increased neutrophil accumulation, edema and CXC chemokine formation in the lung as well as enhanced Mac-1 expression on neutrophils. Inhibition of Rho-kinase signaling significantly reduced M1 protein-provoked neutrophil accumulation and edema formation in the lung. M1 protein-triggered pulmonary production of CXC chemokine and gene expression of CXC chemokines in alveolar macrophages was decreased by Y-27632. Moreover, Rho-kinase inhibition attenuated M1 protein-induced Mac-1 expression on neutrophils. We conclude that Rho-kinase-dependent neutrophil infiltration controls pulmonary tissue damage in response to streptococcal M1 protein and that Rho-kinase signaling regulates M1 protein-induced lung recruitment of neutrophils via the formation of CXC chemokines and Mac-1 expression."
CD010502,0,1889172,0,Latex agglutination detection of group-B streptococcal inoculum in urine.,"It is not uncommon for a newborn to be blood culture negative, but urine latex particle agglutination (LPA) positive for group-B streptococcus (GBS). We hypothesized that whole-cell GBS contamination of urine, which is possible in bag-collected specimens, could cause LPA positivity. Serial tenfold dilutions through 10(-8) of an 18-hr broth suspension of GBS serotype III were prepared in sterile urine. Directigen (Becton-Dickenson Microbiologic Systems, Cockeyville, MD) LPA testing was performed on each sample at inoculation and, if negative, every 2 hr until becoming LPA positive. All tubes were quantitiatively cultured when becoming LPA positive. The assay was performed four times to evaluate independently the effects of urine sample centrifugation, volume, glucose content, and incubation temperature. An 18-hr GBS suspension dilution of 1:10,000 in urine and as few as 5.7 x 10(3) organisms/ml caused LPA positivity at time 0. Urine supported sufficient replication to enable log 0 concentrations (10(-8) dilution) to become LPA positive within 8 hr at 35 degrees C, a routine infant incubator setting. Alteration by centrifugation, volume, or glucose content had no effect on LPA positivity or time needed to become positive. We conclude that Directigen LPA can detect a relatively small concentration of GBS organisms in urine. Due to potential contamination from skin bacteria, positive LPA results from bag urine should be interpreted with caution in the absence of positive cultures."

At intervals up to 72 h incubation, the cultures were examined by conventional visual inspection and automated head-space gas-liquid chromatography (HS-GLC). Forty-six isolates including all those examined of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, S. faecalis, S. milleri, S. mitior, S. mitis, S. salivarius, S. sanguis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Serratia sp., Enterobacter cloacae, Bacterioides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, Candida albicans, C. krusei and Torulopsis glabrata, and three isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis, were detected by HS-GLC. HS-GLC failed to detect the growth of eleven isolates including all those of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Haemophilus influenzae, Corynebacterium sp. and two isolates of S. epidermidis. The growth of all 59 isolates were detected by visual inspection. No significant difference was found between HS-GLC analysis and visual inspection in the speed of detection of bacterial isolates. All the yeast isolates were detected by HS-GLC after 24 h incubation, indicating that it may be possible to detect fungemias earlier by HS-GLC analysis than by other methods."

Our objective was to describe the clinical characteristics of STSS in a series of children admitted to pediatric intensive care units (PICU). A multicenter, retrospective study of children with STSS admitted to 14 PICUs between January 1998 and December 2009 was conducted. Clinical information was obtained retrospectively by chart review. Data from 41 children were collected, 90% corresponding to the second half of the study period. Initial symptoms and signs were nonspecific. All patients developed shock and organ dysfunction, 78.0% developed coagulopathy, 70.7% neurologic dysfunction, and 68.3% respiratory failure. Rapid pharyngeal test for Streptococcus was positive in 78.0%. Initial leukocyte count was quite variable, with leukopenia present in 51.2% of patients and leukocytosis in 31.7%. Children were treated with antibiotics against group A Streptococcus (GAS), usually G penicillin or cephalosporin plus clindamycin. After a median PICU stay of 7 days (range 0-41), 65.8% of patients survived, 26.8% with sequelae. The cause of death of the 11 non-survivors was refractory shock and multi-organ failure."
CD010502,0,2970435,0,Adherence of Streptococcus sanguis to conformationally specific determinants in fibronectin.,"The adherence of Streptococcus sanguis to specific receptors exposed or deposited at the site of endothelial damage may play an important role in the development of infective endocarditis. Adherence of the Challis strain of S. sanguis to gelatin (or collagen) and gelatin-binding components of plasma was examined with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. S. sanguis adhered poorly to immobilized gelatin and to molecular or fibrillar collagen. However, in the presence of fresh human plasma, the adherence of S. sanguis to all three substrates increased as much as eightfold. Removal of gelatin-binding proteins eliminates the ability of plasma to enhance adherence of S. sanguis to the substrates. Addition of purified human plasma fibronectin (Fn) to the absorbed plasma restored the adherence-promoting ability in a dose-dependent manner. A similar dose-dependent increase in S. sanguis adherence was observed when increasing concentrations of Fn alone were added to the gelatin-coated assay wells. S. sanguis adherence to immobilized fibronectin could not be inhibited by preincubating either the bacteria or the gelatin-coated assay wells with Fn or by including excess soluble Fn in the assay mixture. Studies with peptides purified from trypsin digests of Fn indicated that the 160- to 180-kilodalton (kDa) fragments which retain both the gelatin-binding and the cell-binding regions of the intact molecule support adherence of S. sanguis to gelatin. The 160- to 180-kDa fragments inhibited the interaction of S. sanguis with immobilized Fn. In contrast, intact Fn and the 31-kDa amino-terminal fragment were unable to inhibit the adherence when used in equivalent or greater molar amounts. These in vitro results suggest that in the presence of whole plasma, S. sanguis binds to immobilized gelatin or collagen via Fn bound to the immobilized substrates. Our finding that adherence of S. sanguis to immobilized Fn can occur in the presence of large concentrations of Fn, whether in plasma or purified, indicates that a S. sanguis-binding domain is cryptic in the Fn molecule while in solution and is exposed by a conformational change when the Fn becomes bound to gelatin-coated plastic. The ability of peptide fragments of Fn to inhibit S. sanguis adherence is consistent with this hypothesis."

The protein was found to bind to the human plasma proteins, fibrinogen, IgG, and albumin. Analysis of eMP by Western blotting demonstrated a major band with a molecular weight of 49 kD which was responsible for binding of the three plasma proteins. The purified protein was found to bind selectively to human and primate polyclonal IgG, human and mouse albumin, as well as human fibrinogen which has been the only fibrinogen tested. Serological investigations revealed a close relation of eMP to streptococcal M1 protein. It showed a reaction of identity with cell-extracted M1 protein in immunodiffusion. Moreover, the 49 kD peptide responsible for binding, was recognized with an antiserum directed against the 20 amino acids comprising synthetic peptide (42VAL-61GLU) of the N-terminal part of the M1 protein sequence. The affinity of M protein to plasma proteins other than fibrinogen opens new approaches to its purification by affinity chromatography."

CD010502,0,3292998,1,Performance of a solid phase enzyme immunoassay for detection of group A streptococci in a pediatric office laboratory as refereed by a hospital laboratory.,"We evaluated the performance of a new rapid solid phase enzyme immunoassay, SUDS Group A Strep (MUREX Corp., Norcross, GA) for the detection of Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci in a pediatric office practice. Duplicate throat swabs were obtained from 341 children with pharyngitis. One swab was used in the SUDS test and the other was cultured in the office laboratory. Office SUDS and culture (sheep blood agar plate, aerobic 24-hour incubation) were compared with culture using reference techniques (sheep blood agar plate, anaerobic 48-hour incubation) in a hospital laboratory. Compared with hospital laboratory culture, the sensitivity of office SUDS (73.8%) was superior to that of office culture (66.6%) at P = 0.05. Specificities were 93.1 and 98.6%, respectively; positive predictive values were 86.1 and 96.6%; and negative predictive values were 85.9 and 83.5%. The sensitivity and specificity of SUDS compared with office culture were 88.5 and 87.8%, respectively, but would have been 93 and 94% had hemolyzed media not been used on several occasions in the office culture procedure. We conclude that SUDS Group A Strep was significantly more sensitive than throat cultures as performed in a typical pediatric practice although the performance of office cultures could have been improved by standard quality control techniques."
CD010502,0,9952369,0,Genetic linkage of exotoxin alleles and emm gene markers for tissue tropism in group A streptococci.,"In group A streptococci, genetic markers for principal tissue reservoir are located within emm genes, which encode surface proteins that have a role in virulence. A worldwide collection of 160 isolates was evaluated for two traits: chromosomal emm gene markers for tissue tropism (designated patterns A-E), and bacteriophage-associated genes (speA and speC) encoding pyrogenic exotoxins. The speA and speC alleles of organisms harboring the emm marker for a pharyngeal reservoir (pattern A-C) differ from spe alleles that predominate in organisms with the emm marker for impetigo (pattern D). However, organisms that display the emm marker for both tissue sites (pattern E) are not intermediate for the distribution of either speA or speC alleles, but instead resemble pattern A-C isolates for speA and pattern D strains for speC. Statistically significant nonrandom associations between exotoxin alleles and emm patterns were observed but cannot be readily explained by niche separation alone."

A significantly increased prevalence of serum anti-PG-GSP antibody was found in juvenile chronic arthritis and both seropositive and seronegative rheumatoid arthritis (RA), compared with ankylosing spondylitis, systemic lupus erythematosus, myeloma and healthy controls. Anti-PG-GSP antibody was always of the IgG class and there was no correlation of anti-PG-GSP levels with C reactive protein, rheumatoid factor (RF) or anti-streptolysin O titres. There was no direct cross-reaction of RF with PG-GSP, nor did the presence of IgM-RF significantly interfere with the assay. Examination of paired serum and synovial fluid samples offered no evidence for local production of anti-PG-GSP antibody in synovial tissue. These data are compatible with an increased systemic immunization by bacterial fragments in RA."

Bacterial colonies from Bordet-Gengou agar plates were blotted onto nitrocellulose filter disks, lysed by immersion in chloroform, and reacted with monoclonal antibodies. Following reaction with peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulin antisera and 4-chloro-1-naphthol, blue dots representing single colonies appeared on the filters. Blotting of single B. pertussis colonies could be performed after incubation for 40 h, i.e., before the colonies were visible by eye on the agar surface. Ten of ten B. pertussis strains showed positive blotting reactions with antibodies specific for B. pertussis FHA and LPS. Fourteen of fourteen B. parapertussis strains reacted with two of the FHA-specific antibodies but not with two of the LPS-specific antibodies. Strains of B. bronchiseptica showed a variable reaction pattern. No cross-reactions were observed with strains of Streptococcus mitis, S. pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Branhamella catarrhalis, or Klebsiella pneumoniae.

CD010502,0,8400049,0,Group B streptococcal infections during pregnancy.,"Group B streptococcus, acquired intrapartum from the female genital tract, is the leading cause of neonatal sepsis. Intrapartum maternal antibiotic prophylaxis administered to colonized parturients is efficacious in reducing neonatal colonization and morbidity. However, the optimal method of identifying mother-infant pairs at risk remains controversial. Universal antenatal screening has been effective in identifying colonized women for subsequent intrapartum therapy in research protocols. However, the cost-effectiveness and efficacy of this management scheme, in a general population, has not been determined. The predictive value of antenatal cultures for identifying intrapartum group B streptococcus colonization varies inversely with the interval between culture and delivery with generally low predictive values for cultures performed more than 10 weeks before delivery.

In this study, we demonstrated that the proportion of S. pyogenes strains carrying the pfbpI gene was significantly higher among asymptomatic carriers (80%) than among children with pharyngitis (53%; P<.05). With regard to the proportion of prtF1-positive strains, no significant differences were found between the 2 groups (70% vs. 69%, for asymptomatic carriers and children with pharyngitis, respectively). Another important finding is the significant association between macrolide resistance and protein F/SfbI (P<.001) in both groups. These results suggest that the presence of the pfbpI gene can be linked to the ability of S. pyogenes to persist in the throat of asymptomatic carriers."

Commercial POC tests are already widely available for the diagnosis of bacterial and viral infections and for parasitic diseases, including malaria. Infectious diseases specialists and clinical microbiologists should be aware of the indications and limitations of each rapid test, so that they can use them appropriately and correctly interpret their results. The clinical applications and performance of the most relevant and commonly used POC tests are reviewed. Some of these tests exhibit insufficient sensitivity, and should therefore be coupled to confirmatory tests when the results are negative (e.g. Streptococcus pyogenes rapid antigen detection test), whereas the results of others need to be confirmed when positive (e.g. malaria). New molecular-based tests exhibit better sensitivity and specificity than former immunochromatographic assays (e.g. Streptococcus agalactiae detection). In the coming years, further evolution of POC tests may lead to new diagnostic approaches, such as panel testing, targeting not just a single pathogen, but all possible agents suspected in a specific clinical setting. To reach this goal, the development of serology-based and/or molecular-based microarrays/multiplexed tests will be needed. The availability of modern technology and new microfluidic devices will provide clinical microbiologists with the opportunity to be back at the bedside, proposing a large variety of POC tests that will allow quicker diagnosis and improved patient care."
