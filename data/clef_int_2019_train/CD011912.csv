CD011912,0,21743269,0,Atrial septal stenting to increase interatrial shunting in cyanotic congenital heart diseases: a report of two cases.,"Aiming to increase mixing at the atrial level, atrial septal stenting was performed in two pediatric cases with cyanotic congenital cardiac diseases. The first case was a 3-month-old male infant with transposition of the great arteries. The second case was an 18-month-old male infant with increased central venous pressure due to postoperative right ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Premounted bare stents of 8 mm in diameter were used in both cases. The length of the stent was 20 mm in the first case and 30 mm in the latter. The procedure was accomplished without any complications. In the first case, oxygen saturation increased approximately 20-25% with no significant interatrial gradient. In the latter, central venous pressure decreased from 16 to 8 mmHg immediately after the procedure. The patient was weaned from the ventilator on the second day and discharged from intensive care unit on the fifth day. Follow-up echocardiograms of both patients showed patent stents with good position relative to the atrial septum. Stenting of the atrial septum seems to be a safe and effective method to create a reliable, nonrestrictive interatrial communication."

CD011912,0,2413096,0,"Long-term results of the ""palliative"" Mustard operation.","A long-term follow-up study after 41 palliative Mustard operations for transposition of the great arteries and pulmonary vascular obstructive disease is presented. The operations were performed from 1973 to 1980. Mean pulmonary arteriolar resistance was 13.96 +/- 6.7 Um2. A ventricular septal defect was not closed in 34 patients; in 7 it was created at operation. There were three hospital and two late deaths. Survivors were followed up for 3 to 10 years (mean 76.7 +/- 22.8 months). Before operation 4 children were in New York Heart Association functional class IV and 33 were in class III. Mean hemoglobin concentration was 19.43 +/- 3.14 g/dl and arterial oxygen saturation was 63.44 +/- 11.29%. After operation 18 patients were in functional class I, 17 in class II and only 1 in class III. Hemoglobin level decreased to 14.19 +/- 2.3 g/dl and arterial oxygen saturation improved to 89.12 +/- 7.25%. Cardiac catheterization in 21 survivors confirmed no change in pulmonary artery pressure and resistance. Effective pulmonary blood flow improved from 1.39 +/- 0.39 before to 2.6 +/- 0.78 liters/min per m2 after operation. The palliative Mustard operation carries a low risk and provides excellent symptomatic improvement up to 10 years in patients with transposition of the great arteries and pulmonary vascular disease."
CD011912,0,2396778,0,[Total intravenous general anesthesia during radical correction of tetralogy of Fallot].,"Three techniques of general intravenous anesthesia were compared, using mathematical parameters of the heart rhythm, hemodynamic and sympathoadrenal system responses, arterial blood Hb saturation with O2 (SaO2) and thermometry. It has been established that anesthesia with dipidolor ensures adequate protection against the operation stress both in patients with tetralogy of Fallot previously subject to interarterial anastomoses and patients with tetralogy of Fallot without anastomoses. Combined fentanyl and ketamine anesthesia ensures an adequate protection against the operation stress only in patients with tetralogy of Fallot without anastomoses. A more marked response of sympathetic autonomous nervous system and hemodynamics in patients with tetralogy of Fallot previously subject to anastomoses is, probably, mediated by a more intensive analgesic sequestration in the lungs in the presence of functioning anastomoses, which attenuates the analgetic effect. Anesthesia in patients with tetralogy of Fallot previously subject to interaortic anastomoses should be performed using higher doses of narcotic analgesics."
CD011912,0,3847415,0,"Hyperinflation, hyperventilation, and hyperoxygenation before tracheal suctioning in children requiring long-term respiratory care.","The findings reported failed to support a best method of pretreating subjects before tracheal suctioning to minimize oxygen desaturation. Conversely, all methods prevented significant desaturation. No subject's desaturation readings dropped during the study to such a point that they did not subsequently recover after 30 seconds and return to baseline by the end of the 20 minutes. Several subjects had oxygen saturation readings in the high 70s to low 80s as reported during CTP. After recovery from CTP ( in mot cases a 30-second time period), no clinically significant desaturation was noted from the 30-second time period to the end of the study. The results could not be reproduced when the trials were repeated on four subjects. If oxygenation is questionable, these children should be monitored noninvasively to prevent serious desaturation in an already compromised patient."
CD011912,0,27166202,0,Harnessing Teams and Technology to Improve Outcomes in Infants With Single Ventricle.,"Infants with single ventricle require staged cardiac surgery, with stage I typically performed shortly after birth, stage II at 4 to 6 months of age, and stage III at 3 to 5 years of age. There is a high risk of interstage mortality and morbidity after infants are discharged from the hospital between stages I and II. Traditional home monitoring requires caregivers to record measurements of weight and oxygen saturation into a binder and requires families to assume a surveillance role. We have developed a tablet PC-based solution that provides secure and nearly instantaneous transfer of patient information to a cloud-based server, with the capacity for instant alerts to be sent to the caregiver team. The cloud-based IT infrastructure lends itself well to being able to be scaled to multiple sites while maintaining strict control over the privacy of each site. All transmitted data are transferred to the electronic medical record daily. The system conforms to recently released Food and Drug Administration regulation that pertains to mobile health technologies and devices. Since this platform was developed in March 2014, 30 patients have been monitored. There have been no interstage deaths. The experience of care providers has been unanimously positive. The addition of video has added to the use of the monitoring program. Of 30 families, 23 expressed a preference for the tablet PC over the notebook, 3 had no preference, and 4 preferred the notebook to the tablet PC."
CD011912,0,22466710,0,Does treatment of patent ductus arteriosus with cyclooxygenase inhibitors affect neonatal regional tissue oxygenation?,"The effect of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) treatment with cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors (indomethacin [INDO] and ibuprofen [IBU]) on regional oxygenation requires further clarification. The authors hypothesized that both INDO and IBU reduce regional tissue oxygenation in preterm neonates with PDA but that the risk is not uniform for different tissues and other factors may contribute. Regional cerebral (rSO(2-C)), renal (rSO(2-R)), and mesenteric (rSO(2-M)) tissue oxygenation measured by near-infrared spectroscopy and peripheral arterial oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry were recorded simultaneously before, during, and after treatment with the first dose of INDO or IBU in very preterm-born infants with PDA. Tissue-specific fractional oxygen extraction (FOE) was calculated using the rSO(2-C), rSO(2-R), rSO(2-M), and corresponding SpO(2) measurements. The findings showed a significant reduction in rSO(2-C), rSO(2-R), and rSO(2-M) and an increase in regional FOE after treatment with COX inhibitors in approximately one third of the 38 enrolled infants, which were associated with increased baseline regional tissue oxygen saturation (p < 0.01). However, the infants with posttreatment reduction of tissue oxygenation had significantly lower baseline rSO(2-C) (66.7 ± 8.1 vs 69.7 ± 8.1 %), rSO(2-R) (55.2 ± 10.8 vs 62.7 ± 11.8 %) and especially rSO(2-M) (37.8 ± 11.4 vs 46.7 ± 16.0 %) than the neonates with unchanged or increased tissue oxygenation. The two groups did not differ in terms of the risk for posttreatment reduction in regional tissue oxygenation with respect to either INDO or IBU treatment and their respective blood levels. Treatment of PDA with either INDO or IBU is associated with a 30-40 % risk for a reduction in regional tissue oxygenation, which is more pronounced in mesenteric tissue than in cerebral or renal tissue. Despite the inconsistency, reduction of regional tissue oxygenation in preterm infants with PDA is more likely associated with the administration of INDO than with the administration of IBU."

CD011912,0,15850307,0,[Criss-cross heart: anesthetic considerations for total cavopulmonary shunt (Fontan procedure)].,"We report the anesthetic technique used for interatrial septal defect a 2-year-old girl weighing 11 Kg who presented with crossed atrioventricular connection (criss-cross heart), transposition of the great vessels, interatrial and interventricular septal defects, and subpulmonary and pulmonary valve stenoses. The patient was proposed for total cavopulmonary anastomosis with basal arterial oxygen saturation (SapO2) at 65%. Anesthesia was induced with inhaled agents and after intubation, hyperventilation was induced to achieve an end-tidal carbon dioxide pressure around 27 mm Hg. General anesthesia was provided in combination with spinal infusion of morphine chloride (100 microg Kg(-1)) for pain control. A Fontan procedure was carried out uneventfully with cardiopulmonary bypass. Milrinone was used at the extracorporeal circuit pump outlet. The patient was transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit where she was extubated without complications 90 minutes after admission. Anesthetic management is based on maintaining adequate preloading doses by administering volume, inhaled and/or intravenous agents, or use of vasoconstrictors and adjustment of ventilator parameters to modify pulmonary or systemic vascular resistance. We were able to maintain normal arterial pressure in our patient and provide adequate preloading through hyperventilation to reduce pulmonary vascular resistance."

CD011912,0,3134868,0,[Evaluation of aortic to pulmonary blood flow ratio by Doppler echocardiography in septal defects].,"Pulsed Doppler-echocardiography was used to measure systemic and pulmonary blood flows in 22 patients aged from 3 months to 62 years presenting with interatrial (n = 13) or interventricular (n = 9) septal defect. Calculations were based on echographic measurements of aortic and pulmonary orifice areas and on the integral of maximal aortic and pulmonary Doppler velocity curves. Section areas or the arteries, taken as being circular, were deduced from arterial diameter measurements effected above Valsalva's sinus. Doppler velocity curves were recorded at that level, looking for maximal velocities and assuming a flat velocity profile. Blood flow ratios evaluated from Doppler-echocardiography data were compared with data provided by oximetry and showed good correlations (r = 0.92; Y = 0.71x + 0.53; SEE = 0.24). Calculations by categories of lesions showed better results in patients with interatrial septal defect (r = 0.94; Y = 0.73x + 0.507; SEE = 0.22) than in patients with interventricular septal defect (r = 0.83; Y = 0.547x + 0.75; SEE = 0.25). The main difficulties encountered in measuring Doppler-echocardiography blood flow ratios concerned accurate measurement of pulmonary artery diameter, due to problems of lateral resolution, and accurate measurement of turbulent Doppler velocimetry curves. However, this new, non-invasive technique may be useful to determine the best indications for catheterization or even surgery."

CD011912,0,14670278,0,[Pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum associated with severe aortic stenosis].,"Pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum is the complete obstruction of the right ventricular outflow tract due to pulmonary valve atresia in the absence of ventricular septal defect. Pulmonary flow is dependent on the ductus arteriosus. Other morphological anomalies are also present. Aortic stenosis in association with pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum is extremely infrequent, and very few cases have been described. We report a 19-year-old primiparous woman in whom the fetal echocardiogram showed pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum. The neonate had low oxygen saturation and a systolic murmur originating in the aorta. An echocardiogram showed pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum and a bicuspid, thickened, stenotic aortic valve. Low cardiac output ensued and could not be controlled, and the infant died."

CD011912,0,18223350,0,Monitored anesthesia care with a combination of ketamine and dexmedetomidine during cardiac catheterization.,"No specific regimen has been universally accepted as ideal for sedation during cardiac catheterization in infants and children. We evaluated a combination of ketamine and dexmedetomidine for sedation during cardiac catheterization in children with congenital heart disease. The study design included a retrospective analysis of data sheets and hospital records. The protocol for sedation was standardized and data collected prospectively for an ongoing quality assurance project. Heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation were recorded every 1 minute for the first 5 minutes and then at 5-minute intervals. The efficacy of sedation was judged by the need for supplemental ketamine doses. The study cohort included 16 infants and children undergoing either diagnostic or therapeutic cardiac catheterization. Sedation was initiated with a bolus dose of ketamine (2 mg/kg) and dexmedetomidine (1 microg/kg) administered over 3 minutes followed by a continuous infusion of dexmedetomidine (2 microg/kg per hour for the initial 30 minutes followed by 1 microg/kg per hour for the duration of the case). Supplemental analgesia/sedation was provided by ketamine (1 mg/kg) as needed. The baseline heart rate was 103 +/- 21 beats/minute. After the bolus dose of ketamine and dexmedetomidine, the heart rate increased by 7 +/- 5 beats/minute. The greatest increase was 15 beats/minute. The low heart rate after the bolus dose of ketamine/dexmedetomidine or during the subsequent dexmedetomidine infusion was 91 +/- 20 beats/minute (P < 0.001 compared with baseline) and the high heart rate was 110 +/- 25 beats/minute (P < 0.01 compared with baseline). In two patients, the dexmedetomidine infusion was decreased from 2 to 1 microg/kg per hour at 12 to 15 minutes instead of 30 minutes as a result of a decreased heart rate. No clinically significant changes in blood pressure or respiratory rate were noted. Two patients developed upper airway obstruction, which responded to repositioning of the airway. No apnea was noted. During the procedure, the PaCO2 varied from 37.5 to 48 mm Hg and was > or =45 mm Hg in seven patients. No patient responded to local infiltration of the groin and placement of the arterial and venous cannulae. Three patients required a supplemental dose of ketamine (1 mg/kg) during the procedure. In two of these patients, this was required before changing the cannulae. Our preliminary data suggest that a combination of ketamine and dexmedetomidine provides effective sedation for cardiac catheterization in infants and children without significant effects on cardiovascular or ventilatory function."

CD011912,0,26370364,0,Optimal Graft Size of Modified Blalock-Taussig Shunt for Biventricular Circulation in Neonates and Small Infants.,"The modified Blalock-Taussig shunt (mBTS) is one of the most important palliative procedures in congenital heart surgery. However, in neonates and small infants, operative mortality and morbidity due to excessive pulmonary blood flow or shunt failure remains high. In this study, a small shunt graft (3.0-mm diameter) was estimated to determine the optimal shunt graft size of BTS as an initial palliation for ultimate biventricular circulation. Eighteen patients weighing an average 3.5 kg who underwent mBTS from July 2004 to January 2013 at our institute were reviewed. We divided the study cohort into two groups: group S (n = 10) included patients with 3.0-mm diameter shunt grafts, and group L (n = 8) included patients with 3.5-mm diameter shunt grafts. There were no hospital deaths or shunt occlusion in either group. One group L patient (12.5%) had cardiogenic shock due to excessive pulmonary blood flow. There were no differences in postoperative arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) between the groups. There were no differences in body weight at intracardiac repair (ICR) between the groups. During the interstage to ICR, body weight gain was significantly greater in group S than in group L (P = 0.008). The small shunt graft (3.0-mm diameter) in BTS was safe, provided adequate pulmonary blood flow, and led to significant weight gain between mBTS and ICR for ultimate biventricular circulation in neonates and small infants with low body weight."
CD011912,0,2163597,0,[Transposition of the great vessels in western Africa. Apropos of 17 cases observed at the Institute of Cardiology in Abidjan].,"During the last 10 years, 17 children with transposition of the great arteries (TGA) were admitted to the Cardiology Institute of Abidjan: 1 case between March 1978 and December 1985, 16 cases between January 1986 and December 1989. The average age was 58 days (range 5 to 270 days) at the first consultation, and 90 days (5 to 270 days) at the time of admission. The diagnosis was confirmed by echocardiography and hemodynamic investigation in 12 cases. There were 9 simple forms of TGA, 7 with ventricular septal defects (VSD) and 1 with VSD and pulmonary stenosis. Two children were taken back by their parents before any treatment was given. A Rashkind atrial septostomy was carried out in 11 children which increased aortic oxygen saturation from 35 +/- 18 percent to 57 +/- 19 percent; there were 3 unsuccessful procedures in children aged 2, 3 and 5 months with 2 deaths. Five patients later underwent surgical correction by a Senning procedure in 4 cases and anatomical correction in 1 case with VSD. All are well after an average 15 months follow-up (1 to 48 months). One of the 8 children awaiting surgery died. Therefore, TGA is not a rare abnormality in Black Africa; it represents 2 percent of the 887 cases of congenital heart disease observed during the same period. The inadequacy of means of diagnosis is certainly the cause of the relatively low incidence of this malformation, of the considerable delay in under specialist care and, as a consequence, of the greater difficulties in treatment, especially with regards to atrial septostomy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

CD011912,0,26205115,0,Screening for Critical Congenital Heart Disease in Newborns.,"CCHD affects more than 25% of neonates born with congenital heart disease. Patients with CCHD require timely intervention in the form of surgery or cardiac catheterization to survive. These interventions may improve survival and outcomes for these patients. There is strong evidence that performing newborn pulse oximetry screening after the first 24 hours of life may help to detect more than 1200 neonates in the United States each year with CCHD. Pulse oximetry screening for CCHD has been demonstrated to be reasonable to implement and seems to be cost-effective. There is evidence that asymptomatic patients with CCHD can be diagnosed before clinical presentation or cardiovascular collapse with this screening. Pulse oximeter screening has been endorsed by several national organizations as a valuable newborn screening tool. Implementation of pulse oximetry screening programs in a standardized manner with strong communication among all involved parties will likely improve outcomes as well. As we move forward, we as clinicians should work to have a centralized system of reporting positive CCHD results, prompt patient evaluation, and good follow-up for the families of those neonates with positive screening results. Achieving these objectives will likely help us to achieve the goal of improving outcomes of the most critical neonates with CCHD."

Between December 1995 and May 1996, 9 neonates (F:5, M:4) were admitted. Each study patient was assigned to clinical classes using a 1 to 4 classification. Ages ranged between 2 and 30 days (mean 18), weight between 2.25 and 3.65 kg (mean 2.89). A plastic hood, closed on the top with a plastic membrane and with the gas entrance open to room air was placed over the head of the patients. Patients increase pCO2 by rebreathing their own expired CO2. After 24 h of the onset of the treatment the media of points of congestive heart failure 1 to 4 classification decrease from a mean of 4 to a mean of 2.28+/-0.44 (p=0.001).

The study used a repeated measure design. A convenience sample of 11 premature infants in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) of a medical center were studied during 30 BC events. The subjects were of a gestational age of less than and 37 weeks, and postnatal age of less than one month, without known congenital abnormalities and without having been treated with sedatives during the study. Infant HR and SpO(2) were measured at a 30-second interval 10 minutes before and during, and 15 minutes after BC. Maximal lifting angles of BCs during the procedure were recorded. Based on the infant's individual responses to BC, 63.3% of BCs induced an increase in HR and a decrease in SpO(2), defined as the change in HR and SpO(2) greater than two standard deviations from the baseline. In addition, 30% of BCs resulted in cardiac decelerations. The extent of the difference found in these change patterns in HR or SpO(2) were all significant (p <.01) and their mean recovery times were longer than 10 minutes. More HR acceleration events occurred as the BC lifting angle exceeded </= 30 degrees, and more HR deceleration events were found as the angle > 30 degrees (p =.035). Buttock care can have a significant impact on premature infant physiological stability. The BC lifting angle may play an important role in HR acceleration or deceleration. Careful observation before and after BC for premature infants is recommended."

Left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV) and left ventricular systolic output (LVSO) were higher than normal in all 3 groups with an order of descending magnitude of group C (278 +/- 20% and 264 +/- 32%), group B (264 +/- 19% and 243 +/- 37%) and group A (189 +/- 14% and 190 +/- 13%). For the entire group A, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was normal (0.66 +/- 0.06 or 97 +/- 8%) with low systemic arterial oxygen saturation (SAO2) averaging 58%, but the LVEF of those infants less than 6 months with a mean SAO2 of 49% was lowered to 0.58 +/- 0.08 or 87 +/- 13% of normal. The ejection fraction was reduced to the greatest extent (0.50 +/- 0.04 or 81 +/- 6%) in group B patients who averaged 12.8 years of age and had undergone shunt procedures 10 months to 13.6 years, median 7.8 years previously. These findings indicate that a moderate degree of arterial desaturation appears to be better tolerated than a chronic volume overload in patients with tricuspid atresia."
CD011912,0,11994879,0,Postoperative management in patients with complex congenital heart disease.,"Life-threatening problems occur in the neonate and infant after cardiac surgery because of the interplay of diminished cardiac output (CO), increased metabolic demand, inflammatory responses to cardiopulmonary bypass, and maladaptive responses to stress. Therefore, the postoperative management of patients with complex congenital heart defects is directed at optimization of oxygen delivery to maintain end-organ function and promote wound healing. Traditionally, assessment of circulation in the postoperative congenital heart patient has depended on indirect assessment of CO using parameters such as blood pressure, pulses, capillary refill, and urine output. Because of the limitations of indirect and observer-dependent assessment of CO, we rely on objective measures of tissue oxygen levels for the complex postoperative patient. We have found that continuous monitoring of the mixed venous saturation (SvO2) allows for identification of acute changes in systemic oxygen delivery and frequently precedes other indicators of decreased CO. The postoperative patient can be expected to have a period of decreasing CO, and the need for intervention should be anticipated because critical low output syndrome will develop in a subset of patients. Strategies for postoperative care are developed based on the diagnosis and procedure, but optimizing SvO2 is a consistent goal. A uniform approach to airway maintenance, vascular access, and drug infusions, all universal concerns during the perioperative period, minimizes the potential for these predictable and necessary interventions to result in morbidity or mortality. Management of the postoperative single ventricle patient targets stabilization of the systemic vascular resistance through the use of vasodilators to improve systemic perfusion and simplify ventilator management. Management of any individual patient should be driven by objective analysis of available data and must include efforts to re-evaluate the treatment plan as well as to identify unanticipated problems."

CD011912,0,4035572,0,Hemodynamic effects of surface cooling-induced hypothermia on immature pigs with ventricular septal defects.,"Clinical interventions for repair of congenital heart defects, such as hypothermia and cardiopulmonary bypass, may cause changes in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) and systemic vascular resistance (SVR) leading to deleterious alterations in blood flow. Since the relationship between the pulmonary and systemic circulations in patients with ventricular septal defects (VSDs) is dynamic and susceptible to stimuli, we directly measured hemodynamic variables and blood flow distribution in infant pigs with VSDs during surface cooling. In 12 piglets (aged 4 weeks and weighing 4 kg), VSDs were created by caval occlusion, right ventriculotomy, and septal perforation, resulting in a 2.2 +/- 0.4:1 shunt. SVR and PVR were derived by both the flow probe (FP) and microsphere (microseconds) techniques. Systemic and pulmonary blood flow distribution were measured (microseconds). Qp/Qs ratios were derived by oximetry, FP, and microseconds techniques. Pigs were surface cooled in 28 degrees C while measurements were made at 37 degrees, 32 degrees, and 28 degrees C. SVR increased by FP (4034 +/- 55.4 to 10450 +/- 2132 dynes-sec/cm5 [p less than 0.05]) and by microseconds (3097 +/- 497 to 1022 +/- 2583 dynes-sec/cm5 [p less than 0.05]), while PVR remained unchanged. Qp/Qs ratios increased during hypothermia by FP (2.4 +/- 0.4:1 to 6.3 +/- 1.4:1 [p less than 0.05]), by microseconds (2.2 +/- 0.4:1 to 3.5 +/- 0.8:1 [p less than 0.05]), and by oximetry (1.4 +/- 0.1:1 to 2.6 +/- 0.3:1 [p less than 0.05]). Visceral flow (34.8 +/- 5 to 17.5 +/- 4 ml/100 gm/min [p less than 0.05]) and renal flow (127 +/- 21 to 53 +/- 11 ml/100 gm/min) [p less than 0.05]) both decreased during hypothermia. Systemic surface cooling-induced hypothermia in pigs with VSD causes an increase in SVR but no change in PVR resulting in an increased left to right intracardiac shunt confirmed by three measurement techniques. Redistribution of blood flow favors the lungs while lowering renal and visceral flow. Surface cooling-induced hypothermia and circulatory arrest in infants with VSDs may cause circulatory alterations leading to increased left to right shunt and decreased renal and visceral flow even before cardiopulmonary bypass and intracardiac repair."

CD011912,0,8276013,0,Hyperuricaemia in cyanotic congenital heart disease.,"This study examines the exacerbating factors of hyperuricaemia in patients with cyanotic congenital heart disease (CCHD). We studied 59 CCHD patients aged 1 month-30 years. The following variables were assessed: serum uric acid levels, red blood cell count, haemoglobin, hematocrit, partial oxygen pressure and arterial oxygen saturation. Uric acid excretion and renal function were also measured in ten patients with serum levels of uric acid greater than 8 mg/dl (hyperuricaemia group). Serum uric acid level correlated significantly with age and severity of polycythaemia. However, it did not correlate with partial oxygen pressure or arterial oxygen saturation. Uric acid excretion was measured in hyperuricaemia group. Urinary uric acid excretion (24 h) was within normal limits in infants but markedly lower in patients over 15 years of age. The aetiology of hyperuricaemia and decreased uric acid fractional excretion and clearance in infants appears to be secondary to diminished excretion of uric acid in concert with uric acid overproduction. Hyperuricaemia in adolescents and adults with CCHD, however, results mainly from age-related impairment of uric acid excretion."
CD011912,0,12667267,0,Therapeutic gases for neonatal and pediatric respiratory care.,"Though oxygen is the most frequently administered gas in respiratory care, the use of other specialty gases has become common practice in neonatal and pediatric intensive care and emergency departments across the United States. This report reviews the literature and evidence regarding 4 such specialty gases: heliox (helium-oxygen mixture), nitric oxide, hypoxic gas (ie, < 21% oxygen), and carbon dioxide. Because heliox is less dense than air or nitrogen, it offers less resistance and turbulence as an inhaled gas and therefore decreases the pressure and work of breathing necessary to ventilate the lung, which assists in the management of conditions that involve airway obstruction. Inhaled nitric oxide is a selective pulmonary vasodilator and during the last 2 decades research has focused on its potential value for treating disorders that involve pulmonary vasoconstriction. Hypoxic gas and carbon dioxide are used in the management of infants suffering hypoplastic left heart syndrome (a congenital heart defect), to equilibrate the pulmonary vascular resistance with the systemic vascular resistance, which is necessary to assure adequate oxygenation and tissue perfusion. Balancing the systemic and pulmonary vascular resistances requires increasing pulmonary vascular resistance and decreasing pulmonary blood flow; hypoxic gas does this by maintaining blood oxygen saturation at around 70%, whereas carbon dioxide does so by increasing P(aCO2) to the range of 45-50 mm Hg."

In children with congenital heart disease or other serious illness, there is often reluctance to use premedication. We sought to determine whether different premedication regimens produced significant cardiorespiratory effect. A randomized prospective study of the cardiovascular and respiratory effects of different oral, nasal, and rectal premedication regimens was conducted. Fifty-eight young children (average age 2.7 yr) were studied. Oral meperidine (3 mg/kg) with pentobarbital (4 mg/kg) decreased heart rate, mean arterial pressure, cardiac index, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. Stroke volume was maintained. Nasal ketamine (5 mg/kg) with midazolam (0.2 mg/kg) produced no significant cardiovascular or respiratory effects. Rectal methohexital (30 mg/kg) increased heart rate with a coincident decrease in stroke volume but had no other positive or negative cardiac or respiratory effect. This information documents disparate cardiorespiratory effects of different preanesthetic medications in normal children."

Age at surgery ranged from 1 to 18 days, and body weight ranged from 1.62 to 3.38 kg. The diagnosis was interrupted aortic arch in 4, hypoplastic left heart syndrome in 3, and coarctation complex in 3. A 3 mm polytetrafluoroethylene graft was anastomosed to the innominate artery, and the brain was perfused via this graft while the aortic arch was reconstructed. Regional cerebral oxygen saturation and the right and left radial artery pressures were monitored. There were 2 deaths: one because of low cardiac output syndrome after a Norwood operation; another from multiple organ failure due to preoperatively undetected congenital biliary atresia. Regional cerebral oxygen saturation was kept constant at over 40% during regional cerebral perfusion. There were no neurologic sequelae observed postoperatively. It was concluded that the regional cerebral perfusion technique can be safely applied during neonatal aortic arch reconstruction, and deep hypothermic circulatory arrest should be avoided."

Nine cases (8 in group A; 1 in group B) had surgical correction, with 3 long-term survivors. The surgical mortality was 66 per cent. The postoperative haemodynamic status of the 3 surviving patients is very satisfactory, though 1 had a residual atrial septal defect. Factors which adversely affected the surgical outcome were: (1) a critically ill infant, (2) small left atrium and left ventricle, (3) a patent foramen ovale rather than atrial septal defect, (4) systemic arterial oxygen saturation less than 70 per cent, and (5) pulmonary arterial pressure in excess of systemic arterial pressure.

CD011912,0,23691783,0,Correlation of a novel noninvasive tissue oxygen saturation monitor to serum central venous oxygen saturation in pediatric patients with postoperative congenital cyanotic heart disease.,"Using a novel noninvasive, visible-light optical diffusion oximeter (T-Stat VLS Tissue Oximeter; Spectros Corporation, Portola Valley, CA) to measure the tissue oxygen saturation (StO2) of the buccal mucosa, the correlation between StOz and central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2) was examined in children with congenital cyanotic heart disease undergoing a cardiac surgical procedure. Paired StO2 and serum ScvO2 measurements were obtained postoperatively and statistically analyzed for agreement and association. Thirteen children (nine male) participated in the study (age range, 4 days to 18 months). Surgeries included Glenn shunt procedures, Norwood procedures, unifocalization procedures with Blalock-Taussig shunt placement, a Kawashima/ Glenn shunt procedure, a Blalock-Taussig shunt placement, and a modified Norwood procedure. A total of 45 paired StO2-ScvO2 measurements was obtained. Linear regression demonstrated a Pearson's correlation of .58 (95% confidence interval [CI], .35-.75; p < .0001). The regression slope coefficient estimate was .95 (95% CI, .54-1.36) with an interclass correlation coefficient of .48 (95% CI, .22-.68). Below a clinically relevant average ScvO2 value, a receiver operator characteristic analysis yielded an area under the curve of .78. Statistical methods to control for repeatedly measuring the same subjects produced similar results. This study shows a moderate relationship and agreement between StO2 and ScvO2 measurements in pediatric patients with a history of congenital cyanotic heart disease undergoing a cardiac surgical procedure. This real-time monitoring device can act as a valuable adjunct to standard noninvasive monitoring in which serum SyvO2 sampling currently assists in the diagnosis of low cardiac output after pediatric cardiac surgery."

Infants with BPD discharged from the neonatal intensive care unit on diuretic therapy were identified and data were abstracted from clinical databases and medical records. BPD was defined as oxygen dependence at 28 days of life. Infants with chromosomal abnormalities or congenital heart disease and those requiring tracheostomy placement were excluded. Descriptive, univariate, and multivariate analyses were performed. Of 59 patients discharged on diuretic therapy, 10 were also discharged on oxygen. Median (25th, 75th percentiles) duration of outpatient diuretic therapy was 94 (69, 115) days and 30 (14, 84) days for duration of diuretic taper. Duration of therapy and duration of taper were significantly longer in infants discharged on oxygen. In Cox proportional hazards modeling, longer diuretic taper was associated with a higher dose of chlorothiazide at discharge, shorter interval to first outpatient visit, need for rehospitalization, and African-American race. Birth weight, gestational age, and various discharge therapies were not significantly associated with duration of taper after adjusting for these factors. In 58% of all patients, diuretics were tapered or discontinued at the first outpatient visit. This study demonstrated great variability in the duration of diuretic therapy and diuretic taper. Discharge on oxygen was associated with longer duration of diuretic therapy and taper. Active taper is successful in the majority of patients and should be considered in patients with stable BPD."

Maneuverability of the oximetry catheters was comparable to that of standard Swan-Ganz catheters. Pressure tracings were damped, but mean pressures were undistorted.

Should one treat the coarctation, the ventricular septal defect, or both? This dilemma was investigated by reviewing 39 successive patients, aged less than 4 months, undergoing coarctation repair without pulmonary artery banding. Twelve hospital deaths occurred. Ventricular septal defect size was graded ""blind"" according to preoperative angiocardiographic and haemodynamic findings. Of 14 patients classified as having a large ventricular septal defect, necropsy and operative findings in eight showed defects 7 to 12 mm in diameter. Factors associated univariately with significantly increased mortality were young age, raised atrial and ventricular end-diastolic pressures, low weight, high admission blood urea, preoperative ventilation, and a large ventricular septal defect. All but the last two were also closely associated with each other. A jack-knifed discriminant function based upon ventricular septal defect size, blood urea, pulmonary venous oxygen content, and inferior caval oxygen saturation correctly predicted outcome in 78.9% of patients. Combinations of these four giving a probability greater than 0.9 of survival were rare with blood ureas above 8 mmol/litre. Raised blood urea was associated with low descending aortic pressure and subsequent dialysis. Only patients with a large ventricular septal defect stand to benefit from pulmonary artery banding at initial operation.

Eisenmenger syndrome (increase of right to left shunt with worsening of cyanosis and fetal growth retardation); (3.) Marfan syndrome with enlarged aortic root (risk of aortic dissection). In women suffering from cyanotic congenital heart disease the main risk is fetal complications. These are correlated to oxygen saturation and to the type of maternal disease, particularly if a palliative shunt operation has never been performed. Women with left to right shunt, right outflow tract obstruction or previous correction of the disease can go through pregnancy with low risk of mortality. The complications (mainly heart failure and arrhythmias) can be well managed with medical treatment, and the fetal outcome is similar to that in the general population."

Recently, dexmedetomidine has been used as an anesthesia adjunct because of its sedative and analgesic properties and minimal ventilatory depressive effects. We tested the hypothesis that the combination of sevoflurane and dexmedetomidine is non-inferior to sevoflurane alone as it refers to hemodynamic measurements during diagnostic cardiac catheterization in children with a transplanted heart, one ventricle (Fontan procedure), or normal cardiac physiology. Patients were anesthetized with inhalation of sevoflurane in nitrous oxide/oxygen and, after baseline hemodynamic measurements, successive boluses of dexmedetomidine followed by continuous infusion were administered. In this study, non-inferiority was shown when differences at steady-state (dexmedetomidine + sevoflurane) compared to baseline (sevoflurane alone) and its associated 95% confidence interval fell completely within the range of plus or minus 20%. Forty-one (26 normal physiology, 9 cardiac transplantation, and 6 Fontan) patients were enrolled. Non-inferiority of sevoflurane + dexmedetomidine compared with sevoflurane alone was shown for heart rate, but not for arterial blood pressure in patients with normal and cardiac transplant physiology. In patients with normal cardiac physiology, non-inferiority was demonstrated for bispectral index. Therefore, while the lack of depressive respiratory effects and non-inferiority for heart rate are desirable, the lack of non-inferiority of dexmedetomidine + sevoflurane combination for arterial blood pressure do not justify the routine use of this combination compared with sevoflurane alone for children with congenital heart disease undergoing cardiac catheterization."

All of these 17 patients were definitively diagnosed by cardiac catheterization, as having 8 PPA; 3 ToF; 2 TGA + VSD + PA; 2 asplenia with PA; 1 TGA + VSD + PS; and 1 TA (no TGA type). The transcutaneous oxygen pressure pattern of these patients showed a sinusoidal change with a cycle length of 6-20 min with the maximum pressure not exceeding 50 torr and the minimum pressure occasionally close to 0 torr. This sinusoidal tcPO2 pattern was associated with various types of ductus-dependent congenital heart diseases and hence may be of diagnostic value. Transcutaneous oxygen pressure monitoring is also useful in evaluating the ductal response to PG. Other possible mechanisms underlying this phenomenon including biological oscillation should be considered."

CD011912,0,18813947,0,First experiences with intraoperative Levosimendan in pediatric cardiac surgery.,"Levosimendan is a calcium-sensitizing agent with effective inotropic properties. It has been shown to improve cardiac function, hemodynamic performance, and survival in adults with severe heart failure. However, the effect of Levosimendan in pediatric cardiac surgery has not yet been investigated. Thus, we report on our experience with the intraoperative application of Levosimendan in seven infants (body weight range 2.6-6.3 kg) with severe myocardial dysfunction after complex congenital heart surgery. During the administration of Levosimendan, the heart rate, mean arterial blood pressure, and central venous pressure did not change. The mean arterial lactate level significantly decreased 24 and 48 h after the first infusion compared to baseline. Central venous oxygen saturation increased significantly 24 and 48 h after the onset of Levosimendan infusion. We found intraoperatively administered Levosimendan to be well tolerated in the seven infants with severe myocardial dysfunction after complex congenital heart surgery. Levosimendan is a new rescue drug which has beneficial effects, even in pediatric cardiac surgery."

Fifty children underwent cardiac catheterization and peripheral contrast echocardiographic studies. The site, degree, and direction of shunting were established at catheterization by oximetry, indicator dilution analysis and/or angiography. Peripheral vein injections were performed from the right antecubital vein or the right saphenous vein. Right-to-left shunts were documented at catheterization in 27/50 patients; contrast echocardiographic studies indicated the presence and level of shunting in all 27 patients. The contrast echocardiographic technique using peripheral vein injections detects and localizes right-to-left intracardiac shunting. It is a safe and sensitive method to evaluate systemic desaturation in ambulatory and postoperative patients."
CD011912,0,12100647,0,Effects of sponge bathing on vagal tone and behavioural responses in premature infants.,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of sponge bathing on physiological (vagal tone, heart rate, heart period, oxygen saturation) and behavioural responses in newly born premature infants in the intensive care unit of a university hospital in South Korea. A convenience sample was taken of 40 infants who were between 27 and 36 weeks gestational age at birth and free of congenital defects. The infants' physiological parameters were recorded 10 min before, during and after bathing. To determine behavioural status, tools were modified from the instruments used in a previous study by Scafidi et al. (1990). Analysis of the results showed that the premature infants reacted to sponge bathing with decreases in vagal tone and heart period and increases in heart rate. Oxygen saturation did not demonstrate any remarkable alteration during bathing. Also, there were no significant differences in behavioural signs, motor activity and behavioural distress. Results of this study indicated that nurses in a neonatal intensive care unit should decide according to a premature infant's physiological state whether or not to give a sponge bath."
CD011912,0,27185674,0,Near-infrared spectroscopy provides continuous monitoring of compromised lower extremity perfusion during cardiac surgery.,"Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is more frequently used to monitor regional oxygenation/perfusion of the cerebral and somatorenal vascular bed during congenital heart surgery. However, NIRS probes can be placed elsewhere to assess regional perfusion. We report the intraoperative use of NIRS probes on both calves of an infant to continuously monitor changes in the regional oxygenation/perfusion of a lower extremity whose perfusion was compromised after femoral arterial line placement. The NIRS trend of the compromised limb was compared with the contralateral limb throughout congenital heart surgery including the period on cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Our case report illustrates that NIRS technology can be used to monitor ongoing lower extremity vascular compromise during congenital heart surgery when it is not practical to directly access and continuously assess the limb. Transient vascular compromise after invasive femoral arterial line or sheath placement for cardiac catheterization in small infants is not infrequent. NIRS technology in such circumstances may help to decide whether watchful waiting is acceptable or immediate interventions are indicated. Continuous NIRS monitoring showed that limb regional oxygenation remained depressed during CPB but dramatically increased in the post-CPB period."
CD011912,0,21336978,0,Feeding complications in hypoplastic left heart syndrome after the Norwood procedure: a systematic review of the literature.,"Gastrointestinal and feeding complications after the Norwood procedure in infants with hypoplastic left heart syndrome increases morbidity and mortality. These problems are the result of intraoperative challenges, shunt-dependent physiology, and the absence of best-practice guidelines. In response, a systematic review of feeding-related complications and management strategies was performed. A literature search from 1950 to March 2010 identified 21 primary research articles and 4 reviews. Dysphagia, necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), and poor nutritional status are significant feeding-related complications. Three studies directly compared the modified Blalock-Taussig shunt with the right ventricle-to-pulmonary artery conduit (RV-PA). Patients palliated with either shunt had impaired mesenteric blood flow. Mortality did not differ between shunt types. Three studies demonstrated improved outcomes, e.g., increased survival, decreased incidence of NEC, and decreased median time to recommended daily allowance of calories, with a postoperative feeding algorithm. Two studies showed increased survival between stage I and II surgical palliation after implementation of a home-monitoring system consisting of daily weight and systemic oxygen saturation measurements. The RV-PA shunt does not significantly alter mortality or increase mesenteric blood flow. A postoperative feeding algorithm and a home-monitoring system may improve outcomes and decrease average hospital length of stay (LOS). Additional studies are needed to determine which interventions, as part of a standardized protocol, improve survival and decrease complications."
CD011912,0,332408,0,Noninvasive detection and quantification of left-to-right shunts in children using oxygen-15 labeled carbon dioxide.,"A method for the detection and quantification of left-to-right intracardiac shunts is described which utilizes a single breath inhalation of oxygen-15 labeled carbon dioxide (C15O2). The inhaled gas rapidly crosses the alveolar membrane and the oxygen-15 label is exchanged through the carbonate cycle to form oxygen-15 labeled water within the pulmonary capillary blood. Pulmonary indicator clearance curves are measured by external scintillation probes. A simplified method of shunt flow quantification was developed from indicator dilution principles and used for the analysis of the clearance curves. Inhalation studies were performed with 62 children on the day prior to cardiac catheterization. The presence or absence of left-to-right shunt was confirmed by contrast angiography in all cases. Twenty-six children were found to have no shunts by C15O2 inhalation, oximetry or angiography. Of the 36 with shunts, 34 were detected by C15O2. Two of these were designated as equivocal because they were considered to be less than the threshold of definitive detection by C15O2 (having Qp/Qs less than 1.2); 32 were positive and there were two false negatives with small ventricular septal defects. There were no false positives by C15O2. The correlation coefficient between C15O2 and oximetry values of shunt flow for those patients with proven shunts was 0.82."

CD011912,0,8239209,0,[Perioperative management of systemic pulmonary shunts in the neonatal period].,"We have analyzed 36 newborns (19 males and 17 females), with cyanotic cardiopathies in whom a systemic-pulmonary shunt had been performed. These patients were admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unite between January 1985 and June 1990. We studied the perioperative events with the aim of describing the general features of this palliative surgery in the neonatal period and to determine the factors which indicate a bad prognosis. The age at admission was 10.5 +/- 16.5 days and at surgery was 19.5 +/- 20 days. Cardiopathy types included: 13 pulmonary atresias, 9 pulmonary stenoses, 6 D-transposition of the great arteries and 8 tetralogies of Fallot. Of these patients, 83% required prostaglandin administration before surgery. Cardiac catheterization was performed in 54% (in 1/3 balloon atrioseptostomy was performed). The mean diameter of the pulmonary branches was 3.5 +/- 0.7 mm. In 89%, a modified Blalock-Taussig shunt and in 11% a central aorto-pulmonary shunt were performed. The size of the prosthetic graft used was 4 mm in diameter in 77% of the cases, 5 mm in 20% and 3 mm in 3% of the patients. The mortality rate was 27% (intraoperative = 0%, early postoperative = 16%, late postoperative = 11%) with two critical periods: the initial 48 postoperative hours and the reoperation. Bad prognosis factors related to mortality are; preoperative (shorter gestational age and low newborn weight), operative (performance of a central aortopulmonary shunt, surgical ligation of the ductus during operation) and postoperative (arrhythmias, metabolic acidosis in the immediate postoperative period, lower oxygen saturation at 24 hours after the operation, hemorrhage). Our data are compared with other reports of systemic-pulmonary shunt in the neonatal period."
CD011912,0,1284712,0,"[The critical hemoglobin value in newborn infants, infants and children].","The optimum and critical hemoglobin concentrations are determined by the oxygen demand of the tissues and several oxygen transport parameters (i.e., blood flow, arterial oxygen saturation, oxygen affinity of hemoglobin, and the critical venous oxygen pressure). Most of the oxygen transport parameters change markedly during the first weeks after birth. Oxygen consumption and cardiac output in neonates are three times those of adults on a body weight basis. Due to the high oxygen affinity of fetal hemoglobin, the oxygen unloading capacity of hemoglobin in neonates is about 50% less than in adults. From oxygen transport parameters and oxygen consumption we have calculated the optimum and the critical hemoglobin concentrations for preterm and full-term neonates during the first weeks after birth. A hemoglobin concentration of 15 g/dl appears optimal for preterm and full-term infants at birth as well as for adults. The calculated minimum acceptable hemoglobin concentration is 6 g/dl for children and adults, 12 g/dl for preterm infants and 11 g/dl for full-term neonates at birth. Due to the postnatal decrease in oxygen affinity, the minimum acceptable hemoglobin concentration decreases by approximately 1 g/dl/week for the first 5-6 weeks until the minimum value of 6 g/dl for children and adults is reached. The minimum hemoglobin concentration should be 2 g/dl higher in patients who require increased oxygen or suffer from other serious disorders. A minimum hemoglobin concentration of 10 g/dl is recommended in children with leukemia or other oncological disease. In infants and children with chronic hypoxemia (cyanotic congenital heart disease) the minimum hemoglobin concentration should be increased by the percentage of arterial oxygen desaturation."
CD011912,0,14667612,0,Effects of controlled antegrade pulmonary blood flow on cardiac function after bidirectional cavopulmonary anastomosis.,"Bidirectional cavopulmonary anastomosis (BCPA) has been used as an intermediate stage in the treatment of patients with single-ventricle physiology. Leaving additional antegrade pulmonary blood flow has been shown to improve postoperative arterial blood oxygen saturations; however, controversy continues over whether the potential increase in systemic venous pressure is detrimental. We studied the effects of controlled antegrade pulmonary blood flow on cardiac function in patients after BCPA."
CD011912,0,9486276,0,Theoretical optimization of pulmonary-to-systemic flow ratio after a bidirectional cavopulmonary anastomosis.,"A univentricle with parallel pulmonary and systemic circulations is inherently inefficient because mixing of pulmonary and systemic venous return occurs. Thus a cavopulmonary anastomosis is used as a staged palliative procedure to reduce volume overload in patients with cyanotic congenital heart disease. On the basis of oxygen uptake and consumption, an equation was derived that related cardiac output, pulmonary venous oxygen saturation, upper body oxygen consumption, and superior-to-inferior vena caval blood flow ratio (QSVC/QIVC) to oxygen delivery. The primary findings were as follows. 1) As QSVC/QIVC increases, total body oxygen delivery and arterial and superior vena caval oxygen saturations increase. 2) As QSVC/QIVC increases, lower body oxygen delivery and inferior vena caval oxygen saturation initially increase, then peak, and then decrease. 3) As the percentage of lower body oxygen consumption increases, oxygen delivery and saturation decrease. 4) A cavopulmonary anastomosis decreases the required cardiac output for a given oxygen delivery. Thus we concluded that a high systemic arterial oxygen saturation after cavopulmonary anastomosis requires a high percentage of upper body oxygen consumption and a high QSVC/QIVC and that the cavopulmonary anastomosis reduces the volume load on the single ventricle."

Arterial pulse oximetry screening (foot and/or right hand) has been put forth as the most useful strategy to prevent circulatory collapse. The left hand, however, has always been ignored, as it was unclear if the ductus arteriosus influences left-hand arterial perfusion. The objective of our study was to evaluate the impact of the arterial duct on neonatal pulse oximetry saturation (POS) on the left hand."

Experience in the National Institute of Cardiology].,"Bidirectional cavopulmonary shunt is an alternative palliative procedure for patients with congenital cyanotic heart disease, specially those patients less than ""ideal"" candidates for a Fontan's procedure. We present our results with this shunt in patients with tricuspid atresia. Twenty patients with tricuspid atresia were operated on with this shunt, with these associated defects: 20 atrial septal defect, 17 ventricular septal defect, 10 pulmonary stenosis, 1 pulmonary atresia and 1 transposition of the great arteries. Sex: 10 males and 10 females; the age was 27 days to 6 years (mean 1.8 years), the weight was 3.2 kg to 24 kg (mean 10.7 kg), the mean pulmonary artery pressure was 11 to 24 mmHg (mean 17 mmHg), pulmonary vascular resistance was 1.5 to 5 UW (mean 3.1 UW). Postoperative oxygen saturation improved 15 to 120%. All patients survived the surgical procedure. Three patients died in the immediate postoperative period, 2 due to a complications in the postoperative period and 1 due to sepsis. There were two late deaths, 1 sudden death after 6 months of the shunt, and 1 due to sepsis after a Fontan's procedure. Four patients presented pleural effusion and 2 pericardial effusion, they resolved well. We have 15 patients alive and well, in functional class I, and minimal cyanosis. We can conclude that this surgical procedure is useful in the management of patients with tricuspid atresia."

Mathematical modeling of the HLHS circulation has been used to determine the relationship between oxygen kinetic parameters and DO2 and to determine how DO2 might be optimized. The model demonstrates that neither arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) nor mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) alone accurately predicts DO2.

CD011912,0,16777821,0,Summary proceedings from the cardiology group on postoperative cardiac dysfunction.,"As many as one third of the 35,000 to 40,000 infants born in the United States each year with significant congenital heart defects require surgery before the first year of life. Intraoperative support techniques, including cardiopulmonary bypass, can precipitate a complex, systemic inflammatory response that impairs the function of multiple organs and results in more hemodynamic instability and early morbidity in newborns than in older infants and children. Vasoactive agents are routinely used in the postoperative management of these patients either to treat or prevent hemodynamic instability and low cardiac output. However, the effectiveness of vasoactive agents used either individually or in combination in achieving specific therapeutic goals such as maintenance of a minimum cardiac index or arteriovenous oxygen saturation difference has not been systematically evaluated in preterm and term neonates. In addition, there are insufficient safety data for these agents in preterm and term neonates, both as individual agents and in combination. This article proposes a framework for developing prospective clinical studies to determine the efficacy of different vasoactive agents to promote adequate cardiac output and hemodynamic stability after neonatal cardiac surgery. The framework provides an overview of the issues relevant to the design of prospective clinical studies of vasoactive agents in the newborn patient population undergoing cardiac surgery. The issues identified by the cardiology group illustrate the difficulty of designing and executing clinical trials in vulnerable pediatric populations with limited numbers of patients, especially when standard practice is widely believed to be beneficial despite the lack of rigorous data to support such practice."

CD011912,0,8240229,0,Coexpression of alpha and beta myosin heavy-chain isoforms in atria of neonates and infants with congenital heart disease.,"The relative amounts of cardiac myosin heavy-chain isoforms (MyHC) in right atrial tissue (RA) of 16 neonates and children suffering from congenital heart disease have been investigated. Quantification of MyHC was based on one-dimensional gel electrophoresis and on histometrical evaluation of cyro-sections stained with monoclonal antibodies against alpha- and beta-MyHC. The mean right atrial pressures ranged from 2 to 14 Hg. The RA load was normal in eight patients (5.1 +/- 1.3 mm Hg) and overloaded in eight cases (10 +/- 2.5 mm Hg). The arterial oxygen saturation was normal in 12 and ranged between 85% and 89% in four cases. In all patients a large proportion of atrial myocytes coexpressed alpha- and beta-MyHC. However, in the cases with pressure overloaded RA the amount of beta-MyHC was found to be 1.6 times higher than in the cases with normal pressure. This indicates an adaptational response to overload, as was previously described for the adult human heart. In light of this finding, it seems important to conserve as much as possible of the trained right atrial wall during a Fontan type of operation."

A total of 1150 patients (546F, 604M) were studied; 264 were 7 d to 6 mo old (group I), 572 were 6 mo to 2-y-old (group II), and 314 were 2 to 6-y-old (group III). Thiopental sodium dissolved in 10 ml of water in a syringe to which a 6-F feeding catheter was attached was administered prior to echocardiographic examination to patients in groups I, II and III with doses of 50, 35 and 25 mg/kg, respectively in an emergency care environment. Length of time to achieve sedation (induction time), duration of sedation, length of time to return to normal activity (recovery time), whether sedation was successful and side effects were recorded. In the overall study population, sedation was successful in 1094 (95.1%) of the patients, the induction time was 16.34 +/- 3.69 min, the duration of sedation was 35.07 +/- 7.04 min, the recovery time was 63.25 +/- 10.17 min and the overall side-effect prevalence was 2%.

CD011912,0,2053785,0,Home monitoring of transcutaneous oxygen tension in the early detection of hypoxaemia in infants and young children.,"Twenty three patients (age range 0.5-40 months) with recurrent cyanotic episodes underwent physiological recordings, including transcutaneous oxygen tension (TcPO2) from a monitor modified for use at home (Kontron 821S). Of 69 episodes in which the arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2, Nellcor N200) was less than or equal to 80% for greater than or equal to 20 seconds and/or central cyanosis was present, the TcPO2 monitor alarmed (less than or equal to 20 mmHg or 2.67 kPa) in every episode. The pulse oximeter identified hypoxaemia in 62 out of 69 episodes, failing in seven episodes due to signal loss from movement artefact. In only seven of 69 episodes was there an accompanying apnoeic pause (greater than or equal to 20 seconds), and heart rate fell to less than or equal to 80 beats/minute in only five of 28 episodes in which an electrocardiogram was recorded. In 32 episodes in which SaO2 fell to less than or equal to 60%, the TcPO2 monitor alarmed after a median time interval of 16 seconds (maximum time interval 30 seconds). The TcPO2 monitor was then used in an uncontrolled trial at home in 350 patients at increased risk of sudden death and/or hypoxaemia. Indications for monitoring included apparent life threatening events or cyanotic episodes (n = 163), prematurity and prematurity related disorders (n = 86), and sudden unexpected death in one or more siblings (n = 122). The TcPO2 monitor detected cyanotic episodes at home in 81 patients, 52 of whom received vigorous stimulation and/or mouth to mouth resuscitation. Twenty one of these 52 patients had further hypoxaemic episodes documented in hospital with pulse oximetry. In 30 patients, the TcPo2 monitor also identified the gradual development of hypoxaemia, as confirmed by pulse oximetry. Twenty of these needed additional inspired oxygen and six subsequently needed ventilatory support in hospital. This TcPo2 monitor is a reliable detector of both sudden and gradual onset hypoxaemia and is able to be used by parents in the home."

We studied 13 patients (12 children, 1 adult) with congenital cyanotic heart defects; 12 had a surgical correction during nonpulsatile cardiopulmonary bypass and 1 had a palliative operation. Arterial and pulse oximeter measurements were simultaneously taken and compared during induction of anesthesia, surgery, and in some cases during the postoperative period. Pulse oximeter saturation values were recorded by an Ohmeda Biox 3700 pulse oximeter, and the corresponding arterial saturations determined with a CO Oximeter (OSM2 Hemoximeter, Radiometer). The values lay in the range of 43%-100% arterial oxygen saturation. The results were evaluated while taking into account the steady state and non-steady state situations (i.e., when there were rapidly changing pulse oximetric saturation readings and difficulties in coordinating the comparative arterial measurements time-wise), as well as the equipment's internal characterization of the signal quality (High Quality Signal (HQS)/Low Quality Signal (LQS]. The correlation analysis for all comparative measurements, under both steady state and non-steady state conditions, gave a result of r = 0.927. When the comparison was restricted to the measurements in the steady state conditions, r = 0.935 resulted. The pulse oximetry saturation values had a tendency to lie below the corresponding arterial values. The fact that the pulse oximetry values were designated with HQS or LQS was no indication of a better or worse correlation with the arterial value.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

CD011912,0,4094309,0,[Intracardiac hemodynamics in patients with different forms of complete transposition of the major vessels].,"Intracardiac hemodynamic data obtained at catheterization of the heart in 110 patients with complete transpositions of major vessels (CTMV) are reviewed. The patients were divided into 6 hemodynamic groups depending on the presence of concomitant heart diseases. The age of the patients varied between 22 hours and 12 years. Blood oxygen saturation and pressure inside the cardiac cavities and the major vessels, total pulmonary and total peripheral resistance, pulmonary and systemic blood flow, effective pulmonary blood flow and intercavity pressure gradient were measured. Hemodynamic changes in patients with CTMV were shown to be associated with concomitant heart diseases. Low left-ventricular systolic blood pressure, an interatrial pressure gradient and high oxygen saturation of the blood in a pulmonary artery, as compared to the respective values in a systemic artery were the most specific features in these patients."
CD011912,0,24894893,0,Splanchnic near-infrared spectroscopy and risk of necrotizing enterocolitis after neonatal heart surgery.,"Infants with critical congenital heart disease, especially patients with a single-ventricle (SV) physiology, are at increased risk for the development of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). Decreased splanchnic oxygen delivery may contribute to the development of NEC and may be detected by regional oximetry (rSO2) via splanchnic near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). This prospective study enrolled 64 neonates undergoing biventricular (BV) repair or SV palliation for CHD and monitored postoperative splanchnic rSO2 before and during initiation of enteral feedings to determine whether changes in rSO2 are associated with risk of NEC. Suspected or proven NEC was observed in 32 % (11/34) of the SV subjects and 0 % (0/30) of the BV subjects (p = 0.001). Compared with the BV subjects, the SV palliated subjects had significantly lower splanchnic rSO2 before and during initiation of enteral feedings, but the groups showed no difference after correction for lower pulse oximetry (SpO2) in the SV group. The clinical parameters were similar among the SV subjects with and without NEC except for cardiopulmonary bypass times, which were longer for the patients who experienced NEC (126 vs 85 min; p = 0.03). No difference was observed in splanchnic rSO2 or in the SpO2-rSO2 difference between the SV subjects with and without NEC. Compared with the patients who had suspected or no NEC, the subjects with proven NEC had a lower average splanchnic rSO2 (32.6 vs 47.0 %; p = 0.05), more time with rSO2 less than 30 % (48.8 vs 6.7 %; p = 0.04) at one-fourth-volume feeds, and more time with SpO2-rSO2 exceeding 50 % (33.3 vs 0 %; p = 0.03) before feeds were initiated. These data suggest that splanchnic NIRS may be a useful tool for assessing risk of NEC, especially in patients with an SV physiology."

CD011912,0,15213073,0,Clinical application of bidirectional Glenn shunt with off-pump technique.,"A study was conducted to evaluate the outcomes of the bidirectional Glenn shunt technique performed off-pump. Between April 1999 and April 2001, 36 patients underwent bidirectional Glenn shunt, unilateral in 28 patients and bilateral in 8 patients, without using cardiopulmonary bypass. The patients consisted of 25 males and 11 females with a mean age of 5.7 +/- 5.4 years and a mean body surface area of 0.72 +/- 0.34 m2. Preoperative percutaneous oxygen saturation was 75% +/- 7%, and pulmonary arterial pressure was 14.3 +/- 3.6 mmHg. There was no operative mortality. Chylothorax occurred in 1 patient in the early postoperative period. All the other patients were discharged without complications. Mean arterial oxygen saturation at discharge was 92.7% +/- 4.0%. This shunt technique is easy to perform and is helpful in the early management of patients with a functionally univentricular heart. However, much remains to be learned about this unusual physiological system."

Mathematical models suggest that maximal systemic oxygen delivery occurs with Q(p)/Q(s) of less than 1. Whether this applies to clinical practice is unclear. This study evaluates the level of Q(p)/Q(s) that correlates with best hemodynamic status in the first 48 postoperative hours.

Due to hypoplastic pulmonary arteries, all patients received palliative pulmonary artery reconstruction. During the perioperative period, they were allocated to receive either dexmedetomidine (bolus dose of 0.3 μg/kg followed by an infusion of 0.2-0.3 μg/kg/h, n = 15) or control drug (n = 10) intravenously. Any desaturation was recorded. Heart rate, mean arterial pressure, pulse oximetry, and arterial blood gas parameters were measured during the perioperative period.There were no significant differences between the groups in hemodynamic variables. The arterial oxygen saturation and arterial blood gas parameters increased in the dexmedetomidine groups (P < 0.05).These findings suggest that the injection of dexmedetomidine can attenuate hypoxemia during palliative pulmonary artery reconstruction in pediatric patients."

Most patients (67%) presented at birth with 3 cases diagnosed in utero. Mean systemic oxygen saturation was 62+/-12%. An atrial septal defect > or = 4 mm was noted in 20 patients (44%). The patent right ventricle to pulmonary artery connection was present in 10 (22%), and pulmonary atresia was functional in 25 (54%) and anatomic in 11 patients (24%). Fifteen patients (35%) underwent surgical interventions. Total mortality was 70% (vs 14% in acyanotic patients diagnosed during the same time period; p <0.0001) and was related to low cardiac output and hypoxia in 20 patients (62%), postoperative complications in 8 (25%), and sudden death in 4 (13%). Kaplan-Meier survival estimates were 61% at age 1 week (95% confidence interval [CI], 47% to 75%), 48% at age 1 month (95% CI, 34% to 62%), and 36% at both 1 and 5 years of age (95% CI, 22% to 50%). Mortality improved from 81% in 1954 to 1985 to 47% in 1986 to 1996 (p = 0.04). Significant independent predictors of mortality included an atrial septal defect > or = 4 mm (odds ratio [OR] 2.39; p = 0.04), reduced left ventricular function (OR 4.10; p = 0.002), and functional or anatomic pulmonary atresia (OR 2.44, p = 0.003; and OR 5.97, p = 0.004, respectively). An echocardiographic ratio of the combined right atrial and atrialized right ventricular area to the area of the functional right ventricle and left heart >1.0 was 100% predictive of mortality."
CD011912,0,2030922,0,Pulse oximetry versus measured arterial oxygen saturation: a comparison of the Nellcor N100 and the Biox III.,"Pulse oximetry is noninvasive, fast, and simple, making it a very popular way of assessing oxygenation in pediatric patients. However, there are few studies that establish the accuracy of this technology over a wide range of oxygen saturations in children. This study, done in 47 children aged from 1 day to 16 years with congenital heart disease and undergoing cardiac catheterization, compared the direct measurement of arterial oxygen saturation to values from pulse oximetry. Oxygen saturation was measured by an IL-282 Co-oximeter, which also measured carboxyhemoglobin and methemoglobin, and was compared to values obtained from both a Biox III and Nellcor N100. Both pusle oximeters gave values that closely correlated with the actual saturation (r = 0.91 and 0.93, respectively) with standard errors of the estimate of 4.1 and 3.2%, respectively. For both devices, the error increased with decreasing saturations, being progressively larger below a saturation of 80%. The difference between the actual saturation and that measured by pulse oximetry bore no relationship to the presence of carboxyhemoglobin, methemoglobin, fetal hemoglobin, bilirubin, cardiac index, or age of the patient. In conclusion, pulse oximetry, while a very useful technology in pediatrics, must be interpreted with some caution in children with severe cyanosis."
CD011912,0,26665231,0,Preventing cardiac diseases in childhood.,"The burden of cardiac disease in childhood is unknown. It will be a sum of 1% of living births in the general population, suffering from Congenital Heart Disease (CHD) + approximately 2.5% of the general population suffering from bicuspid aortic valve diseases + an unknown higher prevalence of acquired diseases. Cardiomyopathies, arrhythmias - sudden cardiac death (SCD), rheumatic heard disease, hypertension and accelerating atherosclerosis are among the most frequent. Adding on, genetic syndromes including cardiac defects, endocarditis and myocarditis we can address a large pediatric population worldwide, suffering from heart disease. Diagnosis and treatment of these diseases are not afforded in many countries worldwide due to luck of human and material resources. The aim of this paper is to describe how some of the above mentioned diseases can be either early detected or prevented. The working Group ""Cardiovascular Prevention"" of the Association of European Pediatric and Congenital Cardiology (AEPC) focused on some forms of them since its formation in 2011. These areas are: 1) some forms of critical CHD, 2) sudden cardiac death linked to sport activities and 3) detecting- preventing cardio vascular diseases CVD in the young. Methods-Populations: Measurements of pre and post ductal saturation of oxygen using pulse oximeters, after the first day from birth, can early and cheaply detect critical Ductal Arteriosus dependent pulmonary or systemic and cyanotic CHD, saving lives and decreasing significantly the cost of medical care. This screening test can be applied to all neonates as late as possible after their birth and before released to their homes. A combination of detailed medical history, physical examination and 12 lead ECG, during a pre-participation in sport activities medical screening test can prevent SCD, related to a variety of nosology. This combined screening test can be applied to all children before they are exposed to school or leisure sport activities. Screening to early detect and treating existent risk factors (RF) for CVD as well as preventing obesity and hypertension, contributes in lowering the burden of CVD. Specific screening tests as laboratory measurements of lipids, fasting glucose or regular measurements of Blood Pressure and waist to hip ratio in children with a family history of CVD or other co-morbidity that provokes accelerating atherosclerosis must be done on a regular basis."
CD011912,0,20195633,1,Effectiveness of neonatal pulse oximetry screening for detection of critical congenital heart disease in daily clinical routine--results from a prospective multicenter study.,"Pulse oximetry screening (POS) has been proposed as an effective, noninvasive, inexpensive tool allowing earlier diagnosis of critical congenital heart disease (cCHD). Our aim was to test the hypothesis that POS can reduce the diagnostic gap in cCHD in daily clinical routine in the setting of tertiary, secondary and primary care centres. We conducted a prospective multicenter trial in Saxony, Germany. POS was performed in healthy term and post-term newborns at the age of 24-72 h. If an oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) of <or=95% was measured on lower extremities and confirmed after 1 h, complete clinical examination and echocardiography were performed. POS was defined as false-negative when a diagnosis of cCHD was made after POS in the participating hospitals/at our centre. From July 2006-June 2008, 42,240 newborns from 34 institutions have been included. Seventy-two children were excluded due to prenatal diagnosis (n = 54) or clinical signs of cCHD (n = 18) before POS. Seven hundred ninety-five newborns did not receive POS, mainly due to early discharge after birth (n = 727; 91%). In 41,445 newborns, POS was performed. POS was true positive in 14, false positive in 40, true negative in 41,384 and false negative in four children (three had been excluded for violation of study protocol). Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value were 77.78%, 99.90%, 25.93% and 99.99%, respectively. With POS as an adjunct to prenatal diagnosis, physical examination and clinical observation, the percentage of newborns with late diagnosis of cCHD was 4.4%. POS can substantially reduce the postnatal diagnostic gap in cCHD, and false-positive results leading to unnecessary examinations of healthy newborns are rare. POS should be implemented in routine postnatal care."
CD011912,0,24898292,0,Blood pressure screening for critical congenital heart disease in neonates.,"Pulse oximetry (POx) screening for critical congenital heart disease (CCHD) in neonates is less effective in identifying aortic arch obstruction than in detecting other forms of CCHD. This study was performed to assess the use of neonatal blood pressure (BP) screening to detect CCHD. A retrospective review of BP and POx measurements performed at the age of 24 h or before discharge in asymptomatic term neonates was undertaken. The charts of infants readmitted younger than 30 days with a diagnosis of CCHD also were reviewed to identify infants with a missed diagnosis. The screening process was completed for 10,012 of 10,436 infants. Because of an abnormal initial result, 164 neonates required a repeat screening (139 due to abnormal BP). A total of 12 infants failed the BP screening component, and 1 infant failed both the BP and Pox components. The average final right arm-to-leg BP gradient was 25 mmHg in these 13 babies. For nine infants, CCHD was excluded by echocardiography. Three patients were normal at their 1-year well-child exam, and one patient was lost to follow-up evaluation. No infants were identified who had been discharged home with a missed diagnosis of CCHD. Neonatal BP screening to detect CCHD was responsible for more inappropriately performed screenings, repeated screenings, and screening failures than the POx component of the screening protocol and had a highest possible positive predictive value of 1 in 13. These data suggests that BP screening at the time of routine newborn hospital discharge is of limited value in the detection of unrecognized CCHD."

CD011912,0,16966856,0,Advantages of temporary venoatrial shunt using centrifugal pump during bidirectional cavopulmonary shunt.,"Single-ventricle palliation without the use of cardiopulmonary bypass carries advantages that reduce systemic edema and inflammatory responses; however, simple clamping of the superior vena cava (SVC) without a temporary shunt leads to increase in cerebral venous pressure and subsequent decrease in cerebral blood flow during bidirectional cavopulmonary shunt (BCPS). We report our experience of BCPS, using a centrifugal pump-assisted temporary shunt. The criteria included an unrestrictive interatrial communication, the absence of atrioventricular valve regurgitation, and the existence of an antegrade pulmonary blood flow. From August 2000, 14 children with single-ventricle physiology met the criteria. The mean age was 1.0 +/- 0.9 years, and the mean weight was 8.4 +/- 2.6 kg. A temporary shunt was established between the SVC and the right atrium with right-angle cannulae, which were connected to a centrifugal pump to accelerate the blood flow from the SVC to the right atrium. All patients tolerated the procedure. Mean central venous pressure was 17 +/- 4 mm Hg, and transcutaneous oxygen saturation was maintained at 77 +/- 8% during anastomosis. No patients required blood transfusion. There were no postoperative neurological complications. The centrifugal pump-assisted temporary shunt offered safer and more effective circulatory support than other shunt systems, with excellent venous drainage in pediatric patients undergoing BCPS."

Over a 4-year period, 21 patients with TAPVC without extracardiac obstruction presented from 1 day to 10 months of age (mean 2.6 months). Of 21 patients, 17 (81%) presented after 1 month of age with moderate to severe congestive heart failure. In the first week after birth 4 patients presented with minimal symptoms of congestive heart failure. A small patent foramen ovale (3 mm or less in diameter) was found in 19 of 21 patients (90%) by 2-dimensional echocardiography or angiography. Balloon or blade and balloon atrial septostomy was performed in these 19 patients and resulted in significant decreases in mean right to left atrial pressure gradient (from 2.8 to 0.25 mm Hg, p less than 0.001), systolic pulmonary to femoral artery pressure ratio (from 0.80 to 0.60, p less than 0.001), and systemic arterial oxygen saturation (from 84% to 79%, p less than 0.01). One patient had nonfatal complications. Surgery was performed in 19 patients from 2 weeks to 29 months (mean 12 months) after catheterization, with 1 operative death (5% mortality).

In 13 patients, palliative operations had been previously performed. There were 7 mortalities within 1 month after the operation. Seventeen of the 19 survivors were followed up for 5-122 months (mean, 27) with no late deaths. Fifteen patients were in the New York Heart Association functional class 1. Two patients required reoperations at 2 and 57 months postoperatively: the former for atrio-ventricular valvular regurgitation, and the latter for late-developing conduit obstruction and residual atrial right to left shunting. Fourteen patients underwent cardiac catheterization after 1-57 months (mean, 9.8) postoperatively. Two patients had a residual right to left shunt at the atrial level, while the oxygen saturation in the remaining 12 patients was above 90%. Thus, the modified Fontan operation offers an alternate surgical approach for patients with complex congenital heart disease for whom no other palliative procedure can be expected to obtain significant improvement. It can be performed with good clinical and hemodynamic results in selected patients."
CD011912,0,3095025,0,Evaluation of noninvasive measurements of oxygenation in stable infants.,"The accuracy with which transcutaneous measurements of oxygen tension reflect PaO2 in older infants has recently been questioned. We therefore examined the effect of maturation, i.e., age or skinfold thickness, on the accuracy of transcutaneous oxygen tension (PtcO2) and oxygen saturation (StcO2) measurements in 19 infants (age 1 to 61 wk) undergoing elective cardiac catheterization. Twenty-seven simultaneous arterial and transcutaneous measurements revealed a good correlation between PtcO2 and PaO2 (r = .91, slope .77, intercept 3.23 torr). The mean arterial-transcutaneous PO2 difference of 10 torr (range - 15 to 35) was independent of age but was significantly correlated with skinfold thickness (r = .45, p less than .05). There was also a good correlation between StcO2 and SaO2 (r = .95, slope .65, intercept 27.8%). The mean arterial-transcutaneous oxygen saturation of 1.4% (range - 17.3 to 14) was unaffected by age or skinfold thickness. However, neither PtcO2 or StcO2 measurements were accurate in patients with severe hypoxemia; StcO2 consistently overestimated the SaO2 when the SaO2 was below 70%. Thus, in this study the discrepant PtcO2 measurements in older infants were due to increasing skinfold thickness rather than age. PtcO2 monitoring still has an important role in oxygen monitoring and together with StcO2 provides valuable information on oxygenation."

CD011912,0,18179923,0,The influence of systemic hemodynamics and oxygen transport on cerebral oxygen saturation in neonates after the Norwood procedure.,Ischemic brain injury is an important morbidity in neonates after the Norwood procedure. Its relationship to systemic hemodynamic oxygen transport is poorly understood.
CD011912,0,11152839,0,Postoperative hemodynamics after Norwood palliation for hypoplastic left heart syndrome.,"Hemodynamics after Norwood palliation for hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) have been incompletely characterized, although emphasis has been placed on the role that an excess pulmonary-to-systemic blood flow ratio (Qp/Qs) may play in causing hemodynamic instability. Studies suggest that maximal oxygen delivery occurs at a Qp/Qs < 1. However, it remains unclear to what extent cardiac output can increase with increasing pulmonary perfusion. One approach is to use the oxygen excess factor omega, an index of systemic oxygen delivery, and compare omega with measured Qp/Qs. We measured Qp/Qs and omega in neonates after Norwood palliation for HLHS, and determined how they were related. In addition, we determined the temporal course of surrogate indexes of systemic perfusion in the early postoperative period. Arteriovenous oxygen saturation difference, blood lactate, and omega were recorded on admission and every 3 to 12 hours for 2 days in 18 consecutive infants with HLHS or variant after Norwood palliation. Three infants required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) 6 to 9 hours after admission. These infants had higher Qp/Qs, blood lactate, arteriovenous oxygen saturation difference, and lower omega than non-ECMO patients. In non-ECMO patients between admission and 6 hours, omega decreased significantly despite no appreciable change in Qp/Qs. We conclude that: (1) Oxygen delivery is significantly decreased at 6 postoperative hours unrelated to Qp/Qs. This modest decline in oxygen delivery is insufficient to compromise tissue oxygenation. (2) Patients requiring ECMO have significant derangements in oxygen delivery."
CD011912,0,24750107,0,Effect of additional preoperative administration of the neutrophil elastase inhibitor sivelestat on perioperative inflammatory response after pediatric heart surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass.,"Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) elicits a systemic inflammatory response. Our previous reports revealed that prophylactic sivelestat administration at CPB initiation suppresses the postoperative acute inflammatory response due to CPB in pediatric cardiac surgery. The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of sivelestat administration before CPB and at CPB initiation in patients undergoing pediatric open-heart surgery. Twenty consecutive patients weighing 5-10 kg and undergoing ventricular septal defect closure with CPB were divided into pre-CPB (n = 10) and control (n = 10) groups. Patients in the pre-CPB group received a 24 h continuous intravenous infusion of 0.2 mg/kg/h sivelestat starting at the induction of anesthesia and an additional 0.1 mg/100 mL during CPB priming. Patients in the control group received a 24-h continuous intravenous infusion of 0.2 mg/kg/h sivelestat starting at the commencement of CPB. Blood samples were tested. Clinical variables including blood loss, water balance, systemic vascular resistance index, and the ratio between partial pressure of oxygen and fraction of inspired oxygen (P/F ratio) were assessed. White blood cell count and neutrophil count as well as C-reactive protein levels were significantly lower in the pre-CPB group according to repeated two-way analysis of variance, whereas platelet count was significantly higher. During CPB, mixed venous oxygen saturation remained significantly higher and lactate levels lower in the pre-CPB group. Postoperative alanine aminotransferase and blood urea nitrogen levels were significantly lower in the pre-CPB group than in the control group. The P/F ratio was significantly higher in the pre-CPB group than in the control group. Fluid load requirement was significantly lower in the pre-CPB group.Administration of sivelestat before CPB initiation is more effective than administration at initiation for the suppression of inflammatory responses due to CPB in pediatric open-heart surgery, with this effect being confirmed by clinical evidence."

Another infant died later of cerebral complications from hypoxia, rendering a transport-related mortality of 0.7%. Twenty-two infants (7.7%) were severely hypoxic (oxygen saturation < or =65%) at arrival, and 12 of these infants suffered from transposition of the great arteries. During the second 2-year period increased use of intravenous prostaglandin E1 and transportation from tertiary-level units was associated with better transport outcome. During the same time period, overall 30-day postoperative mortality for pediatric cardiac surgery decreased from 4.0% to 1.2% in our hospital. When highly specialized treatment is centralized for quality reasons it is also important that risks associated with transport are considered and that the quality of transport is high. For some cardiac malformations antenatal diagnosis and referral of the mother for delivery to a center with pediatric cardiac surgery would probably further increase the chance of healthy survival in some infants."

CD011912,0,26107681,0,"Outcomes of Early Ligation of Patent Ductus Arteriosus in Preterms, Multicenter Experience.","Persistent ductal patency may have serious effects in preterm infants. Analysis of the results of different trials were inconclusive in determining whether medical or surgical closure of the ductus is preferable and what is the best timing for surgical intervention.The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of timing of surgical closure of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) on ventilatory, hemodynamic, and nutritional status of preterm infants.The authors retrospectively looked at the outcomes of surgical ligation of PDA from January 2010 to June 2014 at 2 Saudi neonatal intensive units at 2 tertiary care centers and the authors compared the results of early ligation (before 3 weeks) to the late ligation (after 3 weeks) regarding different hemodynamic, ventilatory, and nutritional parameters.A total of 120 preemies were included (75 preemies with early ligation and 45 with late ligation of PDA). The early ligation group had shorter duration of assisted ventilation of 10 (8-37) days as compared with 37 (26-90) days in the late ligation group (P < 0.05). The median fraction of inspired oxygen, needed to maintain good oxygen saturation in patients, was higher in the late ligation group [0.29 (0.21-0.70)] than in the early group [0.23 (0.21-0.55)] at 24  hours postoperatively. Full oral feeding was achieved earlier in the early ligation group than in the late group, 29 (15-73) days of life versus 53 (34-118) days of life, respectively (P < 0.05). Body weight at 36 weeks postconceptional age was higher in the early group--2100 (1350-2800) g--than in the late group-1790 (1270-2300) g--(P < 0.05).Our study demonstrated that earlier surgical ligation of the PDA in preterm infants has a more favorable nutritional and ventilatory outcome."
CD011912,0,1933572,0,Advances in echocardiography.,"Before the development of echocardiography, cardiac disease in the horse was diagnosed if a loud heart murmur (grade III-IV/VI or louder) and clinical signs of congestive heart failure (coughing, edema, venous distention, jugular pulsations) were detected on physical examination. Arrhythmias that persisted during and after exercise also indicated cardiac disease, which could be characterized electrocardiographically. Electrocardiography, thoracic radiography, angiography, cardiac catheterization, and oximetry could add only small pieces of information about the heart. M-mode echocardiography provided the first ""window"" with which to evaluate the heart and its intracardiac structures, albeit an ice-pick one-dimensional view. With M-mode echocardiography, the diameter of the aorta at the valves, the left ventricle, right ventricle, and left atrial appendage, as well as the thickness of the interventricular septum and left ventricular free wall, could be measured. Motion and thickness of the tricuspid, mitral, and aortic valves could be assessed, but only in a one-dimensional plane. Two-dimensional echocardiography provided an added dimension, resulting in visualization of all the intracardiac structures, aorta, and pulmonary artery. Two-dimensional echocardiography became the diagnostic technique of choice for the evaluation and characterization of congenital cardiac disease in critically ill neonates, as well as in adult horses. Two-dimensional echocardiography also improved the ability to diagnose valvular regurgitations, characterize valvular lesions (bacterial endocarditis, ruptured chorda tendineae), myocardial function (segmental wall motion abnormalities), atrial size, mass lesions (endocarditis, neoplasia, and thrombi), and pericardial effusion. Information about blood flow was obtained using contrast echocardiography but was limited to certain cardiac abnormalities (congenital cardiac defects and tricuspid regurgitation). This information about blood flow was limited to the detection of positive or negative contrast jets. Comprehensive information about blood flow was lacking until the application of Doppler echocardiography to equine cardiology. Pulsed-wave and color flow Doppler echocardiography resulted in precise localization of the abnormal blood flow and semiquantitation of the shunt flow or regurgitant jet. Color flow Doppler echocardiography sped up the localization and semiquantitation of the jet in many instances and provided some information about blood flow velocity in the enhanced and variance modes. The peak velocity of jets can be determined using continuous-wave Doppler echocardiography. This value then can be used to estimate pressure difference between cardiac chambers or to calculate cardiac output noninvasively if angles parallel to flow can be obtained. Thus, information about cardiac size, function, and blood flow can be combined to diagnose cardiac disease in horses and to formulate a prognosis for life and performance."

CD011912,0,7967251,0,[A new operative technique for pulmonary artery banding: adjustment of pulmonary artery bands by mitral valve flow velocity].,"We developed a new technique to adjust the pulmonary artery band at surgery by monitoring the mitral valve flow velocity, which is indirectly indicative of the pulmonary flow. We employed this technique for 10 consecutive patients aged from 5 days to 5 months (mean, 1 months) weighing from 2.7 to 4.4 kg (mean, 3.3 kg). Underlying disease was aortic coarctation or interrupted+ventricular septal defect in 7 patients, single ventricule in 1 patients and miscellaneous defects in 2 patients. The pulmonary artery was exposed through a left lateral thoracotomy and a 3 mm wide Teflon tape was placed around the main pulmonary artery. The transducer of the Doppler echocardiography was placed along the left sternal border. The band was tightened gradually until the maximum velocity of the mitral valve flow decreased to around 70% of the previous level. During banding procedure, arterial oxygen saturation, heart rate and left ventricular contractility were monitored continuously. If bradycardia, unacceptable hypoxemia or ventricular dysfunction occurred, the band was released. The mitral valve flow velocity decreased rapidly by just a little additional tightness of the band between the range of 50% to 80% of the previous level. This technique enabled a very fine adjustment (less than 0.5 mm plication) and postoperative management has become very easy. Although there is a limitation of this technique that monitoring of the mitral valve flow velocity cannot be applied to the patients with significant interatrial shunt or mitral regurgitation, we conclude that this technique is simple and useful to obtain the optimum constriction of the pulmonary artery with excessive pulmonary blood flow."

It is essential to stabilize the general condition of these infants until surgical intervention. We tried to regulate the pulmonary blood flow to control congestive heart failure by administering supplemental nitrogen inhalation therapy to six very low-birth-weight infants with PDA. After the inhalation of supplemental nitrogen gas was begun, the arterial oxygen saturation and partial oxygen pressure immediately decreased. Furthermore, the blood pH, systolic pressure, and urine output significantly increased. The infants were well stabilized. Furthermore, there were no complications related to nitrogen gas inhalation. Supplemental nitrogen inhalation therapy is an effective and feasible therapy for severe congestive heart failure in very low-birth-weight infants with PDA."

Left atrial dimension was expressed either as a function of the body surface area (LAD cm per m2 BSA), or as a multiple of the aortic root dimension (LAD/AR), and was compared with the shunt size as determined by oximetry. A highly significant (P less than 0-001) regression relation was found for the group as a whole. A significant relation also existed for each individual group: ventricular septal defect, ventricular septal defect with pulmonary hypertension, and persistent ductus arteriosus. Regression equations were derived for the whole group. The value of echocardiography is in separating large from small shunts and in adding a dimension to the follow-up of the individual patient."

CD011912,0,18043147,0,Moderate hypothermia with low flow rate cardiopulmonary bypass used in surgeries for congenital heart defects.,"Low flow rate perfusion has been recommended in profound hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) in recent years. However, most patients with congenital heart defects are still operated on under moderate hypothermic CPB, where high flow rate perfusion has been adopted by most perfusionists. Fifty patients with congenital heart defects, ranging from 1 to 11 yr of age and 6.5 to 25 kg of weight, were included in the trial. Once on CPB, a high flow rate of 2.37 +/- 0.39 L/min/m was used to cool the patient to 27.3 degrees C +/- 0.84 degrees C rectal temperature, followed by a low flow rate of 1.31 +/- 0.09 L/min/m until the main intracardiac repair was completed and rewarming started. High flow rate was still used in rewarming the patients to a rectal temperature of 35 degrees C-36 degrees C. The total CPB, cross-clamp, and low flow rate perfusion time were 86.4 +/- 26.6, 46.4 +/- 22.3, and 40.7 +/- 22.4 min, respectively. After 24-99 min low flow rate perfusion, venous oxygen saturation remained above 80% for all the patients, and lactate concentration did not increase. Only three patients showed slight metabolic acidosis during CPB and required an extra 6-12 mEq sodium bicarbonate. Average urine output was 199 +/- 155 (50-600) ml during CPB. All patients recovered well after operation. No surgical death or neurologic complications occurred. Low flow rate perfusion might be safely used in moderate hypothermic CPB as long as the oxygen saturation of returned venous blood was kept above 80%."

The patients were followed up for six months to find out how many of those without surgical intervention survived. Actuarial analysis showed that the six month survival rate among the patients with low available oxygen or oxygen unloading capacity was significantly lower (24% and 49%, respectively) compared with those with normal indices (90% and 96%, respectively). Both available oxygen and oxygen unloading capacity were superior to arterial oxygen saturation and arterial oxygen content as prognostic criteria. Haemoglobin and haematocrit were of little value in prognosis. Available oxygen appeared to be the best prognostic criterion for survival at six months. It is concluded that available oxygen and oxygen unloading capacity are useful prognostic criteria in children with cyanotic congenital heart disease. These new criteria, when used in conjunction with the conventional methods of assessing the cardiac lesion, may be of considerable help to the physician in evaluating the prognosis of the patient."

CD011912,0,12139125,0,Ventricular function determination during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) following Norwood operation: a case report.,"Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation has been used successfully to support both cardiac and pulmonary function following Stage I Norwood operation. Determination of the return of native cardiac function and pulmonary function can be easily accomplished because of the single ventricle physiology. The pulmonary function can be assessed while on full flow ECMO by isolating the membrane oxygenator gas compartment, allowing evaluation of native pulmonary gas exchange through the modified Blalock-Taussig shunt. Cardiac output can be calculated by using the following oxygen delivery equation: Total O2 delivery = ECMO oxygen delivery + ventricular oxygen delivery. The ventricular O2 saturation used in the formula for oxygen delivery is same as the mixed venous O2 saturation returning to the ECMO pump because of the large atrial communication following the Norwood operation. A 3.2 kilogram patient was placed on a pediatric ECMO circuit utilizing a heparin-coated centrifugal pump and a microporous membrane oxygenate after failure to wean from bypass because of a low oxygen saturation and poor ventricular function. On day 1 of support, the systemic arterial oxygen saturation was 100% and matched the ECMO arterial saturation. On day 2 of the support, the patient's arterial saturation decreased to 96%, and the ECMO mixed venous saturation was 87%. Using the oxygen delivery formula, the ventricular cardiac output was calculated to be 175 mL/min, with an ECMO flow of 400 mL/min for a total cardiac output of 575 mL/min. The native ventricular contribution was, therefore, 30% of total cardiac output. Calculation of cardiac output would normally require a left ventricular sample in a patient with biventricular physiology. The single ventricle physiology in the post-operative Norwood patient makes this calculation a useful tool for assessing return of ventricular function in these patients."

We present the case of a patient with tetralogy of Fallot with diminished pulmonary flow and complete proximal occlusion of a right-sided Blalock-Taussig shunt. Surgical repair was not possible because of relative contraindications, and the interventional shunt recanalisation attempt was unsuccessful. The coronary stent was implanted into arterial duct.

CD011912,0,19083139,0,Prostaglandin E2 after septostomy for simple transposition.,"In simple transposition of the great arteries (sTGA), balloon atrial septostomy is performed prior to arterial switch to improve mixing of systemic and pulmonary circulations. Following septostomy, some patients are also given prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) until surgical repair. The aims of our study were to identify how often PGE2 is given after septostomy, the indications for starting PGE2, and the effect this has on postoperative outcome. The study was a retrospective review of infants born with sTGA between 2000 and 2005, who underwent arterial switch at Yorkhill Children's Hospital, Glasgow. Over a 5-year period, 26 infants (16 male) with sTGA underwent septostomy. There was a significant rise in mean oxygen saturation following septostomy (mean, 61.4 +/- 11.5% before, 81.5 +/- 9.4% after; p < 0.05). Four of 26 (15%) did not receive PGE2 at all (group 1) and 8 of 26 (30%) received PGE2 before but not after septostomy (group 2). A total of 14 of 26 infants (54%) were given PGE2 following septostomy. This comprised 11 who received PGE2 before and after septostomy (group 3) and 3 who did not receive PGE2 prior to septostomy but did after (group 4). Groups 2 and 3 were compared directly, as they both received PGE2 before septostomy. In group 3, oxygen saturations were lower when PGE2 was started compared with saturations immediately after septostomy (45 +/- 23.6% vs. 80 +/- 10.3%; p < 0.05). Groups 2 and 3 showed no difference in atrial gap after septostomy (9.4 +/- 3 vs. 8 +/- 1 mm; p > 0.05). Fifty percent of infants in group 3 underwent echocardiography prior to restarting PGE2, which revealed a patent arterial duct in all but one patient. Despite PGE2, Group 3 had lower saturations at arterial switch compared with Group 2 (71 +/- 14% vs. 82 +/- 8%; p < 0.05). No difference was observed between group 2 and group 3 with regard to length of cardiopulmonary bypass (group 2, 173 +/- 101.4 min, vs. group 3, 157.9 +/- 42.1 min; p > 0.05). However, the Intensive Care Unit stay was longer for patients who received PGE2 following septostomy (8.5 +/- 10.3 vs. 5 +/- 0.93 days; p < 0.05). Total postoperative stay was also longer for infants who received PGE2 after septostomy (26.8 +/- 14.3 vs. 16.8 +/- 6.3 days; p < 0.05). In conclusion, the use of pulse oximetry has led to an increase in the administration of PGE2 after septostomy. PGE2 administration was associated with a longer ICU stay. The association between administration of PGE2 and longer postoperative stay supports the approach of early surgical repair with minimal preoperative medical intervention."

CD011912,0,3684368,0,Redistribution of regional blood flow and oxygen delivery in experimental cyanotic heart disease in newborn lambs.,"Redistribution of regional blood flow is an important compensatory response to acute hypoxemia which preserves oxygen delivery to the most vital organs. It is not known if this change in blood flow persists when hypoxemia is prolonged, as occurs in cyanotic congenital heart disease. Chronic hypoxemia was produced in newborn lambs by creating pulmonary stenosis and an atrial septal defect. Oxygen saturation was maintained at 60-70% of control for 2 wk. Distribution of cardiac output was then measured with radionuclide-labeled microspheres. As compared with control, chronic hypoxemia did not alter total cardiac output. Regional blood flow was redistributed, however, the pattern of this redistribution was different from that seen during acute hypoxemia. Myocardial and cerebral blood flows, which increase during acute hypoxemia, return to control levels during chronic hypoxemia. Renal, splenic, gastrointestinal, carcass, and skin blood flows remain decreased. Hemoglobin gradually increases so that after 2 wk of hypoxemia total systemic oxygen delivery returns toward control. However, oxygen delivery to all organs except the heart and brain is reduced. Thus, although cardiac output and total systemic oxygen delivery return toward normal during chronic hypoxemia, these measurements may not reflect important regional variations in blood flow and oxygen delivery. Decreased oxygen and substrate delivery to the gastrointestinal tract, liver, and carcass may account for the alterations of metabolism and growth seen in the newborn with cyanotic congenital heart disease."

However, due to differences in the patient-sensor interface, the results from those studies may not be transferable to the paediatric population. We therefore performed 123 simultaneous measurements (37 patients) of transcutaneous O2-saturation (StcO2) from 3 pulse oximeters and compared these with the arterial O2-saturation (SaO2) from a co-oximeter (Radiometer OSM 3). The median age of the 37 patients at the time of study was 2.0 months (range 1 day-5 years), their weight 4.7 kg (0.8-15.0 kg). The mean difference between StcO2 and SaO2 was -0.6% (SD 5.2%) for the Kontron 7840 pulse oximeter, -0.9% (SD 2.3%) for the Nellcor N200, and -1.2% (SD 3.5%) for the Radiometer OXI3 pulse oximeter. The corresponding 95% intervals were -7.4(-) + 9.6%, -5.7(-) + 4.3% and -7.0(-) + 6.3% for the Kontron, Nellcor and Radiometer instrument, respectively. These results demonstrate that neither of the 3 instruments systematically under- or overestimated SaO2. However, there were differences in precision, particularly in the low range of SaO2."
CD011912,0,23080524,0,Heat shock protein 27 is increased in cyanotic tetralogy of Fallot myocardium and is associated with improved cardiac output and contraction.,"Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) is a congenital heart condition in which the right ventricle is exposed to cyanosis and pressure overload. Patients have an increased risk of right ventricle dysfunction following corrective surgery. Whether the cyanotic myocardium is less tolerant of injury compared to non-cyanotic is unclear. Heat shock proteins (HSPs) protect against cellular stresses. The aim of this study was to examine HSP 27 expression in the right ventricle resected from TOF patients and determine its relationship with right ventricle function and clinical outcome. Ten cyanotic and ten non-cyanotic patients were studied. Western blotting was used to quantify HSP 27 in resected myocardium at (1) baseline (first 15 min of aortic cross clamp and closest representation of pre-operative status) and (2) after 15 min during ischemia until surgery was complete. The cyanotic group had significantly increased haematocrit, lower O2 saturation, thicker interventricular septal wall thickness and released more troponin-I on post-operative day 1 (p < 0.05). HSP 27 expression was significantly increased in the < 15 min cyanotic compared to the < 15 min non-cyanotic group (p = 0.03). In the cyanotic group, baseline HSP 27 expression also significantly correlated with oxygen extraction ratio (p = 0.028), post-operative basal septal velocity (p = 0.036) and mixed venous oxygen saturation (p = 0.02), markers of improved cardiac output/contraction. Increased HSP 27 expression and associated improved right ventricle function and systemic perfusion supports a cardio-protective effect of HSP 27 in cyanotic TOF."

CD011912,0,7362322,0,Long-term results of shunt procedures for tricuspid atresia.,"One hundred forty-eight infants and children with tricuspid atresia treated by one or more operations during a 31-year period were reviewed to indicate the long-term results of shunt procedures. In general, the Potts shunt was used most frequently in small infants while the Blalock anastomosis was preferred for children older than 3 to 6 months. The Glenn anastomosis appears to be a good secondary shunt but its use depends on specific anatomical features and the possibility of doing a Fontan procedure in the future. The duration of effective palliation for each shunt has been examined actuarilly by life-table analysis. It is essential that shunts not only maintain adequate oxygen saturation but also preserve the patency, size, and shape of the pulmonary arteries and normal pulmonary vascular resistance."

The age of the patients ranged from 9 months to 4 years. All patients previously had had a systemic-pulmonary artery anastomosis. Preoperative mean arterial oxygen saturation was 67.2%. A restrictive outlet foramen was enlarged in 3 patients. Infundibulectomy and enlargement of the outlet chamber with a Dacron patch were performed in 4 patients. A pulmonary valve commissurotomy alone was done in 1 patient. There were no hospital or late deaths (mean follow-up, 16 months). Four patients out of 5 have obtained symptomatic and documented (increase in partial pressure of oxygen) benefit. In 1 patient, arterial oxygen saturation failed to rise to a satisfactory level."
CD011912,0,9423944,0,Bidirectional cavo-pulmonary anastomosis with an additional flow source to the lungs: clinical experience in 21 cases.,"The Fontan operation is considered a palliative procedure for the treatment of complex congenital heart diseases with a morbidity and mortality that are not negligible, especially in high-risk patients. In these cases, a bidirectional cavopulmonary anastomosis with additional source of blood flow to the lungs can represent a valuable surgical option. Between November 1992 and December 1995, 21 patients with univentricular heart physiology were submitted to bidirectional cavopulmonary anastomosis with additional blood flow the additional flow consisted of an aortopulmonary shunt in 13 cases, pulmonary artery banding in seven cases, and pulmonary artery stenosis in one case. Mean age at operation was 35.5 months (range 4 months to 12 years) and mean body weight 10.9 (range 4-24.4) kg. Hospital mortality was zero. Morbidity (pleuropericardial effusions) was significant in one case. There were three late deaths (14%) caused by worsening atrioventricular valve regurgitation: two of these occurred in patients with right isomerism. Late haemodynamic evaluation documented a significant increase in cardiac output (P < 0.01) and oxygen saturation (P < 0.05) during pharmacological stress testing. Angiographic characterization of blood flow distribution to the lungs showed better results when the additional blood flow was represented by an anterograde source (pulmonary artery banding or native pulmonary artery stenosis). In conclusion, bidrectional cavopulmonary anastomosis with additional blood flow is a good alternative to classic or fenestrated Fontan technique in high-risk patients. Secondly, the diagnosis of isomerism could be a contraindication to this type of surgery, because the persistent volume overload could worsen atrioventricular valve regurgitation. Thirdly, the pharmacological stress testing shows a favourable behaviour of cardiac output and arterial oxygen saturation. Fourth, the type of additional blood flow seems to condition both pulsatility and distribution of pulmonary blood flow."

Herein, we report the case of an infant with pulmonary atresia, an intact ventricular septum, and multiple aortopulmonary collateral vessels. At 4 weeks of age, the infant developed necrotizing enterocolitis in association with significant mesenteric oxygen desaturation, as measured by means of near-infrared spectroscopy. With bowel rest and antibiotic therapy, the patient's mesenteric oxygen saturation and clinical status improved. This case highlights the importance of impaired mesenteric oxygen delivery consequential to congenital heart disease as a possible risk factor for necrotizing enterocolitis, and the use of near-infrared spectroscopy to measure tissue perfusion noninvasively in high-risk patients. To our knowledge, this is the 1st report of mesenteric oxyhemoglobin desaturation in association with necrotizing enterocolitis in a patient who also had congenital heart disease."

CD011912,0,9382008,0,Role of inverted buttoned device in transcatheter occlusion of atrial septal defects or patent foramen ovale with right-to-left shunting associated with previously operated complex congenital cardiac anomalies.,"Feasibility, safety, and effectiveness of transcatheter occlusion of atrial septal defect (ASD) with the buttoned device has been demonstrated. Despite its effectiveness in occluding secundum ASD with left-to-right shunt and patent foramina ovalia, presumably responsible for paradoxic embolism, it has limitations in effectively occluding ASD with evident right-to-left shunts. Therefore, the device was modified so that the square-shaped occluder component of the device is on the right atrial side, the inverted buttoned device. This study determines the feasibility, safety, and effectiveness of inverted buttoned device occlusion of atrial defects with right-to-left shunts. During a 17-month period ending August 1996, 12 patients, aged 1.6 to 39.0 years, underwent occlusion of residual ASD after repair of pulmonary atresia/stenosis with intact ventricular septum (n = 5), modified or fenestrated Fontan for tricuspid or pulmonary atresia (n = 5), and double-inlet left ventricle (n = 2). The systemic arterial oxygen saturation increased (p <0.001) from 82 +/- 7% (range 72% to 90%) to 94 +/- 3% (range 88% to 98%). There was no change in heart rate or cardiac index measured by Fick. Right atrial pressure increased by 1 to 4 mm in 5 of 12 patients (42%). There was trivial (n = 5) or no (n = 7) residual shunt by color Doppler study. Six- to 18-month (median 12) follow-up in all 12 patients revealed stable oxygen saturations (92 +/- 3%) by pulse oximetry. Color Doppler studies revealed small (n = 1), trivial (n = 1), or no (n = 10) residual shunt at follow-up. Based on these data, it is concluded that transcatheter occlusion of ASD with right-to-left shunts with inverted buttoned device is feasible in relieving arterial hypoxemia. Further clinical trials in a larger number of patients and careful evaluation of follow-up results are indicated to examine its safety and longer term effectiveness."
CD011912,0,8480939,0,[Percutaneous balloon valvotomy in neonatal obstructive cardiopathy.

The procedure was successful in seven of them (78%) in whom with a 1.22 + 0.2 balloon/annulus ratio the right ventricular systolic pressure decreased from 96 to 45 mmHg (p < 0.001), the transvalvular gradient from 65 to 23 mmHg (p < 0.001); and the systemic oxygen saturation increased from 69 to 86% (p < 0.001). In one patient the valve was not crossed. Two patients underwent surgery because unsuccessful balloon valvotomy result in the immediate and mid term period: hypoplastic right ventricle in one, and inferior vena cava thrombosis that prevent a second dilation in the other respectively. The mid term follow up showed a 62% (5/8) of successful result. Although the complex methodology and complications are not uncommon, the balloon pulmonary valvotomy is a safely and effective therapy for neonates with critical pulmonary stenosis."

CD011912,0,9636259,0,Utility of intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography in the assessment of residual cardiac defects.,"To investigate the accuracy of immediate postbypass transesophageal echocardiography in the assessment of residual cardiac defects, we compared intraoperative transesophageal echocardiograms with intra/postoperative data in 86 patients, aged 4 days to 30.7 years (median = 1.4 years), at risk for a total of 174 postoperative lesions: right (n = 55) or left (n = 26) ventricular outflow tract obstruction, ventricular septal defect (n = 65), aortic (n = 12) or mitral regurgitation (n = 8), or mitral stenosis (n = 8). Accuracy of intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography was evaluated based on comparison with (1) immediate post-bypass left (n = 4) or right (n = 9) ventricular outflow tract pressure gradients by pullback in the operating room, (2) direct surgical inspection of residual ventricular septal defects (n = 3), (3) pulmonary artery oxygen saturation (n = 49), (4) right ventricular outflow tract pullback gradient (n = 24), and (5) transthoracic echocardiogram (n = 51) performed within 40 days of surgery. The results indicate that intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography agreed with intra/postoperative data in 87% of patients at risk for right ventricular outflow tract obstruction, 96% at risk for left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, 97% at risk for ventricular septal defect, and 100% at risk for aortic regurgitation, mitral regurgitation, or mitral stenosis. Significant residual lesions led to immediate surgical revision in 11 cases: 3 ventricular septal defects, 6 right and 2 left ventricular outflow tract obstructions. Of these, intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography confirmed and quantified suspected residual lesions in 7 and identified unsuspected lesions in 4 cases. Immediate postbypass transesophageal echocardiography proved reliable for assessing residual ventricular septal defect, mitral stenosis, and mitral or aortic regurgitation. Although accurate for assessment of the left and right ventricular outflow tracts in most patients, transesophageal echocardiography may not reliably reflect the severity of obstruction in all cases."

Cardiac catheterization demonstrated a significant systolic pressure gradient between the ascending aorta and innominate artery (30-65; mean, 51 mm Hg) as the likely cause of diminished pulmonary blood flow in these patients. Routine angiography by itself was not conclusive in identifying a discrete area of obstruction, but selective angiography coupled with a knowledge of the obstruction did reveal the stenosis. All patients were successfully treated with balloon dilatation of the stenotic area, with the pressure gradient being reduced to 7-25 (mean, 17 mm Hg) immediately following dilatation. On follow-up catheterization in three patients, the systolic gradients were 3, 6, and 9 mm Hg. Arterial oxygen saturations rose from 63.5% predilatation to 77.3% immediately postdilatation and 81% on follow-up evaluation. In conclusion, innominate artery stenosis is an important cause of diminished blood flow through a modified right Blalock-Taussig shunt. Routine angiography will often miss the diagnosis. Pressure gradients and selective angiograms are necessary in order to make the diagnosis, although careful noninvasive assessment should also be diagnostic of this problem. Catheter dilatation is therapeutic in this situation and can be performed early after surgery in the absence of a fresh suture line."
CD011912,0,22673966,0,Clinical outcomes and resource use for infants with hypoplastic left heart syndrome during bidirectional Glenn: summary from the Joint Council for Congenital Heart Disease National Pediatric Cardiology Quality Improvement Collaborative registry.,"The National Pediatric Cardiology Quality Improvement Collaborative (NPC-QIC) registry captures information on interstage management of infants with hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS). The purpose of this study was to identify interstage risk factors for increased resource use and adverse outcomes during bidirectional Glenn (BDG) hospitalization. All infants in the NPC-QIC registry (31 United States hospitals) undergoing BDG surgery were included (December 2009 to August 2010). Patient demographics, interstage variables, operative procedures, and complications were recorded. Days of hospitalization, ventilation, inotrope use, and complications were surrogates of resource use. Logistic regression analysis determined the associations between predictor variables and resource use. Of 162 infants, 105 (65 %) were males. At BDG, the median age was 155 days (range 78-128), mean weight-for-age z-score was -1.6 ± 1.1, mean length-for-age z-score was -1.5 ± 1.7, and mean preoperative oxygen saturation was 78 % ± 7 %. Caloric recommendations were met in 60 % of patients, and 85 % of patients participated in a home-surveillance program. Median days of intubation, inotrope use, and hospitalization were 1, 2, and 7, respectively. There were 4 post-BDG deaths and 55 complications. In multivariate analysis, lower weight-for-age z-score, female sex, and aortic atresia with mitral stenosis were associated with a higher risk of BDG complications. Meeting caloric recommendations before BDG was associated with fewer hospitalization days. Lower weight-for-age z-score was an independent and potentially modifiable risk factor for BDG complications. HLHS infants who met caloric recommendations before BDG had a lower duration of hospitalization at BDG. These data justify targeting nutrition in interstage strategies to improve outcomes and decrease costs for patients with HLHS."

CD011912,0,1972434,0,Effects of indomethacin on cerebral haemodynamics in very preterm infants.,"Near infrared spectroscopy was used to investigate the effects of intravenously administered indomethacin (0.1-0.2 mg/kg) on cerebral haemodynamics and oxygen delivery in 13 very preterm infants treated for patent ductus arteriosus. 7 infants received indomethacin by rapid injection (30 s) and 6 by slow infusion (20-30 min). In all the infants cerebral blood flow, oxygen delivery, blood volume, and the reactivity of blood volume to changes in arterial carbon dioxide tension fell sharply after indomethacin. There were no differences in the effects of rapid and slow infusion. These falls in cerebral oxygen delivery and the disruption of cerebrovascular control might compromise cellular oxygen availability, particularly in regions of the brain where the arterial supply is precarious. Care should be taken to ensure that oxygen delivery is optimum before the administration of indomethacin to preterm infants."

CD011912,0,11054898,0,Congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation in the newborn: two case studies and review of the literature.,"Congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation (CCAM) is a congenital malformation of the lung that can present on imaging studies as abnormal air, air/fluid-filled cysts, or fluid-filled/solid-appearing cysts. The use of ultrasound in prenatal management has increased the number of cases diagnosed in utero. Early diagnosis is vital in the medical management of CCAM. Outcome varies from hydrops and fetal demise to complete resolution before birth. Many CCAMs diagnosed in utero may decrease in size even if substantial mediastinal shift and lung compression are noted at the time of diagnosis. Once the disorder has been diagnosed, use of serial ultrasound is helpful in providing medical management of the fetus. Two cases of CCAM in the newborn are presented that reflect characteristic clinical features but with distinctly different outcomes, one patient successfully responding to resection and ventilatory support, the other succumbing in the first day of life. The embryology, histology, prenatal and postnatal clinical presentation, and treatment of this malformation are discussed on the basis of a review of the literature. Recent developments in fetal diagnosis and treatment, including fetal surgery, are also presented. We conclude that CCAM should be considered in the differential diagnosis in the presence of respiratory distress and mediastinal shift. It is especially important for respiratory therapists, nurses, and other members of neonatal transport teams to consider CCAM in the differential diagnosis for any patient who presents with respiratory distress and a chest radiograph showing mediastinal shift. The treatment of choice for this lesion is surgical resection by either segmentectomy or lobectomy. Even in cases of relatively asymptomatic patients with CCAM, surgical resection should be considered because of the reported association of carcinoma and unresected CCAM. (IO2)) of 1.0 at a rate of 60-100 breaths per minute, there was slight improvement in oxygen saturation, to 50-70%. The postintubation radiograph showed bilateral haziness, with a mediastinal shift to the right. An umbilical venous catheter was placed and a venous blood gas study revealed a pH of 6.82, partial pressure of carbon dioxide of 100 mm Hg, and partial pressure of oxygen of 36 mm Hg. A needle aspiration of the left chest wall was performed to relieve the mediastinal shift; it produced approximately 40 mL of clear fluid. A repeat chest radiograph showed a possible pneumothorax on the left and continued mediastinal shift. A left-side chest tube was inserted and clear fluid continued to drain, but an additional chest radiograph was unchanged. Needle aspiration was then performed on the left side, and a large amount of air was removed. The S(pO2) increased to 88%, and the heart rate and blood pressure remained stable. The patient was then prepared for transport and placed on a Biomed MPV 10 (Bio-Med Devices, Guilford, Connecticut), intermittent mandatory ventilation rate 120, peak pressure 25 cm H(2)O, positive end-expiratory pressure 5 cm H(2)O (25/5), and F(IO2) 1.0. A venous blood gas study just before transport showed a pH of 7.1 and a P(CO2) of 45 mm Hg. The S(pO2) at that time was between 60% and 70%. To facilitate ventilation during transport, the patient was also given pancuronium (Pavulon) and morphine. On arrival at the neonatal intensive care unit, the patient was placed on a Sensormedics High-Frequency Oscillator (Sensormedics Corporation, Yorba Linda, California) with an initial amplitude of 70, airway pressure 25 cm H(2)O, inspiratory time 33%, Hertz 13, and F(IO2) 1.0. Three additional chest tubes were placed in the left hemithorax, which initially evacuated air, followed by serosanguineous fluid. The S(pO2) briefly increased to above 90%. A repeat chest radiograph again showed persistence of the left-sided collection of air and mediastinal shift. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)"
CD011912,0,11809429,0,Comparison of contrast echocardiography versus cardiac catheterization for detection of pulmonary arteriovenous malformations.,"Because clinical diagnosis of pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) is difficult and cardiac catheterization invasive, contrast echo has been used to aid in the diagnosis. Correlation between contrast echo and catheterization data in these patients remains poorly defined. We examined the ability to detect pulmonary AVMs by contrast echocardiography, pulmonary angiography, and pulmonary vein saturations in patients who have undergone cavopulmonary (Glenn) shunts. Pulmonary vein saturations were obtained from catheterization reports. Blinded observers reviewed angiographic and contrast echo data retrospectively in 27 patients who had undergone a Glenn shunt and in 19 controls with biventricular hearts. Contrast echo was positive in 68 of 99 lungs (69%). Angiography showed AVMs in 65 of 98 lungs (66%). Pulmonary vein desaturation was found in 13 of 45 lungs sampled (29%). Only 10 of 38 lungs with positive contrast echo had pulmonary vein desaturation, but only 1 patient had pulmonary vein desaturation without positive contrast echo. The degree of desaturation did not correlate with severity of contrast echo return; 6 of 11 patients with 3+ contrast echo studies had normal pulmonary vein saturations. In a control group of patients with biventricular hearts, only 1 of 19 (5.3%) contrast echos was weakly positive. Contrast echo correlates poorly with angiography and pulmonary vein saturation for evaluation of AVMs. Contrast echo is extremely sensitive and often positive despite normal pulmonary vein saturation. Assessment of pulmonary vein desaturation in 100% oxygen may improve its sensitivity and correlation with contrast echo. Additional studies are needed to follow patients with mildly positive contrast echo studies to enable determination of their clinical relevance."
CD011912,0,7494553,0,Differences between atrial and ventricular protein profiling in children with congenital heart disease.,"The purpose of the present study was to compare protein profiling of atria and ventricles in children operated for congenital heart disease. Tissue samples were obtained during surgery from patients with normoxemic (ventricular and atrial septal defects) and hypoxemic (tetralogy of Fallot) diseases. Protein fractions were isolated by stepwise extraction from both right ventricular and atrial musculature. The concentration of total atrial protein in the normoxemic patients exceeded the ventricular value (110 +/- 2.1 vs 99.9 +/- 4.0 mg.g-1 wet weight, respectively); in the hypoxemic group this atrio-ventricular difference disappeared. The concentration of contractile proteins in all cardiac samples was significantly higher in the ventricles as compared with atria, while the concentration of collagenous proteins was significantly higher in the atria (due to a higher amount of the insoluble collagenous fraction). The concentration of sarcoplasmic proteins (containing predominantly enzyme systems for aerobic and anaerobic substrate utilization), however did not differ between ventricles and atria. Furthermore, ventricular contractile fractions obtained from both normoxemic and hypoxemic patients were contaminated with the myosin light chain of atrial origin. Soluble collagenous fractions (containing newly synthesized collagenous proteins, predominantly collagen I and III), derived from all ventricular samples, were contaminated by low molecular weight fragments (mol. weight 29-35 kDa). The proportion of the soluble collagenous fraction was significantly higher in atrial but not in ventricular myocardium of hypoxemic children as compared with the normoxemic group. It seems, therefore, that lower oxygen saturation affects the synthesis of collagen preferentially in atrial tissue."

CD011912,0,27129499,0,Tocotrienol Treatment in Familial Dysautonomia: Open-Label Pilot Study.,"Familial dysautonomia (FD) is an autosomal recessive congenital neuropathy, primarily presented in Ashkenazi Jews. The most common mutation in FD patients results from a single base pair substitution of an intronic splice site in the IKBKAP gene which disrupts normal mRNA splicing and leads to tissue-specific reduction of IKBKAP protein (IKAP). To date, treatment of FD patients remains preventative, symptomatic and supportive. Based on previous in vitro evidence that tocotrienols, members of the vitamin E family, upregulate transcription of the IKBKAP gene, we aimed to investigate whether a similar effects was observed in vivo. In the current study, we assessed the effects of tocotrienol treatment on FD patients' symptoms and IKBKAP expression in white blood cells. The initial daily doses of 50 or 100 mg tocotrienol, doubled after 3 months, was administered to 32 FD patients. Twenty-eight FD patients completed the 6-month study. The first 3 months of tocotrienol treatment was associated with a significant increase in IKBKAP expression level in FD patients' blood. Despite doubling the dose after the initial 3 months of treatment, IKBKAP expression level returned to baseline by the end of the 6-month treatment. Clinical improvement was noted in the reported clinical questionnaire (with regard to dizziness, bloching, sweating, number of pneumonia, cough episodes, and walking stability), however, no significant effect was observed in any clinical measurements (weight, height, oxygen saturation, blood pressure, tear production, histamine test, vibration threshold test, nerve conduction, and heart rate variability) following Tocotrienol treatment. In conclusion, tocotrienol treatment appears significantly beneficial by clinical evaluation for some FD patients in a few clinical parameters; however it was not significant by clinical measurements. This open-label study shows the complexity of effect of tocotrienol treatment on FD patients' clinical outcomes and on IKBKAP expression level compared to in vitro results. A longitudinal study with an increased sample size is required in the future to better understand tocotrienol affect on FD patients."

In a series of 62 cases, approximately two thirds of patients had the great arteries in a side by side relation, and most (28 of 41) had the ventricular septal defect in a subaortic position. In double outlet right ventricle with malposition of the great arteries, the ventricular septal defect was either subpulmonary or subaortic. Four of the 13 patients with subpulmonary ventricular septal defect had a supracristal defect with side by side relation of the great arteries (Taussig-Bing anomaly), and 9 patients had malposition of the great arteries with an infracristal ventricular septal defect. In all patients with subpulmonary ventricular septal defect, pulmonary arterial oxygen saturation was greater than systemic arterial saturation regardless of the relation of the great arteries. Forty patients had subaortic ventricular septal defect. In 24 of these patients, including 7 with malposition of the great arteries, systemic arterial oxygen saturation was greater than pulmonary arterial saturation. However, in 9 patients (25 percent) the reverse was true, as seen in complete transposition of the great arteries and in Taussig-Bing anomaly. Thus, pulmonary arterial oxygen saturation greater than systemic arterial saturation is not reliable evidence of a Taussig-Bing anomaly. Of the 25 patients with such saturation, only 4 had the Taussig-Bing anomaly."
CD011912,0,25458107,0,Pulse Oximetry Screening for Critical Congenital Heart Disease: Bringing Evidence Into Practice.,"Congenital heart disease is the most common and serious type of infant birth defect. Pulse oximetry screening has been supported in the literature as a valuable tool to aid in the prompt detection of critical defects. Pulse oximetry is easily accessible, inexpensive, and noninvasive, and can be readily performed by clinical nurses at the infant's bedside; however, it remains a technology that is underutilized in newborns. Nurses can be leaders in addressing the need to translate knowledge into practice to improve the morbidity and mortality rates in the newborn population."

After local prostaglandin infusion through an end-hole catheter, the ductus was passed using a hydrophilic, high-support coronary guidewire. It was then stabilized by coronary stent implantation, after which the arterial oxygen saturation showed a sudden rise. In conclusion, ductus arteriosus recanalization and stenting can be successfully achieved within a few days after spontaneous closure as a cost-effective alternative to a surgical shunt for critical neonatal, duct-dependent Ebstein's anomaly."

In a preoperative vasodilator test with inhaled NO 20, 40 and 80 ppm and oxygen, mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) was at least 40 mmHg and/or the pulmonary vascular resistance index (PVRI) 4 Wood units. Preoperatively, NO 40 ppm and FiO2 0.9 reduced systolic pulmonary/systemic arterial pressure (PAPs/SAPs) from 0.89 (SD 0.10) to 0.80 (0.18) and pulmonary/systemic vascular resistance (PVR/SVR) from 0.26 (0.13) to 0.13 (0.08). Haemodynamic assessment was repeated in 11 patients postoperatively. NO treatment was started if PAPs/SAPs rose to 0.8 or the pulmonary oximetry fell below 40%. Postoperatively, eight of 11 patients, including 6 patients with Down's syndrome, needed NO. PAPs/SAPs decreased more than preoperatively: 48.5% vs 11.2, p = 0.0045. Pulmonary oximetry increased by 15.7%, p = 0.02. The degree of preoperative response to NO did not differ between the patients with postoperative pulmonary hypertension and the other children. Patients with early pulmonary hypertensive crisis (first 24 h; n = 6) had a higher PVRI (7.6 vs 4.4 Um2; p = 0.003) and PVR/SVR (0.34 VS 0.17; p = 0.02) preoperatively.

CD011912,0,23688937,0,Diagnosis and management of life-threatening cardiac malformations in the newborn.,"Approximately 1-2 per 1000 newborn babies have a cardiac defect that is potentially life-threatening usually because either the systemic or the pulmonary blood flow is dependent on a patent ductus arteriosus. A significant proportion of newborns with such cardiac defects are being discharged from well-baby nurseries without a diagnosis and therefore risk circulatory collapse and death. This risk is greatest for defects with duct-dependent systemic circulation, notably aortic arch obstruction, but is also significant in transposition of the great arteries, for example. The solution to this problem, apart from improving prenatal detection rates, is to introduce effective neonatal screening including routine pulse oximetry."

CD011912,0,3760365,0,Use of a venous assist device after repair of complex lesions of the right heart.,"Sixteen patients underwent hemodynamic evaluation of a venous assist device after complex operations on the right side of the heart. The device consists of an inflatable abdominal binder attached to a Jobst extremity pump causing intermittent external compression of the abdomen. In addition, six of these patients were evaluated using total lower body compression for comparison. Modifications of the Fontan procedure were performed in 14 patients, mitral valve anuloplasty and tricuspid valve replacement in 1 patient and reconstruction of the right ventricular outflow tract for treatment of pulmonary atresia with intact septum in 1 patient. The patients' ages ranged from 23 months to 31 years (mean 10.7 +/- 1.8 years). Systemic blood pressure, right and left atrial pressures, heart rate and arterial-mixed venous oxygen saturation difference were recorded in each patient with and without the device in place. With the venous assist device, mean systolic pressure increased from 95 +/- 4 to 122 +/- 3 mm Hg (p less than 0.05) and diastolic pressure rose from 57 +/- 3 to 70 +/- 3 mm Hg (p less than 0.05). Left atrial pressure increased from 7 +/- 1 to 15 +/- 1 mm Hg and right atrial pressure from 15 +/- 1 to 23 +/- 1 mm Hg (both p less than 0.05). In addition, arterial-mixed venous oxygen saturation difference decreased from 29% without the device to 23% with the device in place (p less than 0.05). Total lower body compression gave similar results to intermittent abdominal compression alone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

CD011912,0,6862701,0,Diminutive pulmonary artery growth following right ventricular outflow tract enlargement.,"We have assessed the clinical results and angiographic pulmonary artery growth following construction of the right ventricular outflow tract in 10 children with tetralogy of Fallot or pulmonary atresia. All cases were associated with diminutive pulmonary arteries and considered unsuitable for total corrective surgery. The mean age of the children was 34 months, mean weight 10 kg and mean body surface area 0.48 m2. The right ventricular outflow tract was constructed by insertion of a patch of dura mater (5 patients), pericardium (2 patients), homograft valved conduit (2 patients) and infundibulectomy (1 patient). The ventricular septal defect was not closed. Study of the patients between 13 and 37 months postoperatively revealed an increase in mean arterial oxygen saturation of 22% (P less than 0.01) and a fall in mean haemoglobin concentration of 1.6 g% (P less than 0.05). Overall change in pulmonary artery diameter compared to that of the trachea was insignificant although in individual cases a 50% increase in diameter was shown. Palliation of symptoms was equivalent to conventional shunting procedures. Closure of the ventricular septal defect was performed successfully in 2 patients at a later date."
CD011912,0,2716179,0,Analysis of acute and chronic heart failure in view of hepatic oxygen supply-demand relationship using hepatic venous oxygen saturation.,"The adequacy of hepatic circulation in terms of oxygen supply-demand relation was assessed by measuring hepatic venous oxygen saturation (Shvo2) in patients. Among those with congenital cardiac lesions (n = 11), Shvo2 during the early postoperative period was markedly low as less than 20% in Fontan operation group (n = 5) with subsequent clinical findings of acute hepatic dysfunction. Significant correlations were found between Shvo2 values early after surgery and subsequent peak values in serum hepatic enzymes. Serum total bilirubin and prothrombin time started to deteriorate when Shvo2 became below 30%. Cardiac index, hepatic perfusion pressure and mixed venous oxygen saturation showed positive linear correlations with Shvo2, and central venous pressure (CVP) with an inverse relation. In chronic valvular disease (n = 28), those with NYHA class IV patients showed lower Shvo2 (average; 47.4%) at cardiac catheterization than the others (class-I; 66.4%, class-II; 63.9%, p less than 0.05). These results indicate that Shvo2 monitoring appears to be useful to assess the hepatic perfusion in terms of oxygen supply-demand relation in acute and chronic heart failure, and Shvo2 of 30% seems to be a critical level."
CD011912,0,16479042,0,Pulmonary segmental artery ratio: an alternative to the pulmonary artery index in patients with tetralogy of fallot.,"The objective of this study was to determine a reliable, alternative ratio to the pulmonary artery (PA) index, which will help to estimate the adequacy of postoperative pulmonary blood flow in patients with tetralogy of Fallot. We propose the pulmonary segmental artery ratio (PSAR), which is an angiographic measure for the quantitative standardization of the total number of pulmonary segmental arteries in a patient. The expected value of the PSAR is 1 and it is constant after the 16(th) week of intrauterine life. Retrospective analysis of the PSAR and PA index calculations in patients with tetralogy of Fallot was conducted. Sixty-one patients were assigned to a moderate or low risk group according to their PSAR; the low risk group included 31 patients whose PSAR was between 0.75-1 (group 1) while the moderate risk group included 30 patients whose PSAR was between 0.50-0.75 (group 2). High risk patients whose PSAR was less than 0.50 were excluded from the study. Postoperative peak right ventricular pressure, the pulmonary artery to systemic pressure ratio, and peripheral arterial oxygen saturation preoperatively after cardiopulmonary bypass were analyzed separately in groups 1 and 2. Postoperative peak right ventricular pressure was lower in group 1 than group 2, while the pulmonary artery to systemic pressure ratio and peripheral arterial oxygen saturation were higher in group 1 than group 2 (P < 0.01). Based on the present findings, it is concluded that PSAR is not as reliable as the Nakata index. However, in cases in which the PSAR and PA index are not correlated, PSAR may be helpful for determining the adequacy of postoperative pulmonary blood flow and postoperative outcomes of patients with hypoplastic pulmonary arteries."

CD011912,0,2231215,0,Early ribavirin treatment of respiratory syncytial viral infection in high-risk children.,"A 3-year prospective, blinded, multicenter study was done to assess the efficacy of early ribavirin intervention in mild respiratory syncytial virus illness in children with bronchopulmonary dysplasia or with congenital heart disease. A cohort of 178 children younger than 36 months of age with bronchopulmonary dysplasia or congenital heart disease were followed. Forty-seven infants whose respiratory syncytial virus infection resulted in mild symptoms of less than or equal to 72 hours' duration received ribavirin (n = 20) or water placebo aerosol (n = 27) either in a hospital or at home. Outcome measures included respiratory and analog score, room air oxygen, saturation, and oxygen flow needed to maintain saturation at greater than or equal to 91%. No difference in age, gender, family size, passive smoking, baseline oxygen saturations in room air, or duration of symptoms before treatment was found between groups. After 3 days of therapy, ribavirin produced a greater rate of improvement of analog scores (p = less than or equal to 0.001), lower oxygen requirements (p = 0.01), and higher oxygen saturation (p = 0.01). Respiratory scores and total hospital days did not differ significantly between the groups. Treatment failure occurred in 2 of 20 children (10%) in the ribavirin group versus 5 of 27 children (18%) in the placebo group, a nonsignificant difference. No child required assisted ventilation or had an adverse reaction. We conclude that early ribavirin therapy may help to reduce morbidity from respiratory syncytial virus infection in high-risk young children."

Outcome of mother and fetus.,"In a series of 416 women with congenital heart disease seen in the Royal Brompton National Heart and Lung Hospital, London, and the Hospital Giovanni Bosco, Torino, Italy, there were 822 pregnancies. The outcomes of 96 pregnancies in 44 patients with cyanotic congenital heart disease were studied. Patients with the Eisenmenger reaction were excluded. Patients were divided arbitrarily into groups according to the type of maternal congenital cardiac anomaly, and factors influencing maternal and fetal outcome were evaluated. The incidence of maternal cardiovascular complications was high (32%), with one death from endocarditis 2 months after delivery. Forty-one (43%) of 96 pregnancies resulted in a live birth; 15 (37%) were premature. Mean weight of full-term infants was 2575 g. Univariate analysis suggested that maternal disease, Ability Index, hemoglobin, and arterial oxygen saturation before the pregnancy were factors that discriminated between successful and unsuccessful fetal outcome, with hemoglobin and arterial oxygen saturation being the most important predictors. Women with cyanotic congenital heart disease can go through pregnancy with a low risk to themselves, with frequent treatable complications, but there is a high incidence of miscarriage, premature births, and low birth weights. An incidence of congenital heart disease in the fetus of 4.9% (2 of 41 live births) is higher than that found in the normal population."

Between June 2007 and September 2009, 218 consecutive patients underwent off-pump bidirectional Glenn shunt institution for single ventricle with pulmonary stenosis complex. Their mean age was 4.72 ± 1.80 years (range, 4 months to 6 years) and median weight was 10.12 kg (range, 4.1-19 kg). A temporary shunt was created between the innominate vein and the right atrium, with a 3-way connector for de-airing. Fifty-five patients had bilateral cavae. The mean internal jugular venous pressure on clamping the superior vena cava was 24.69 ± 1.81 mm Hg. Continuous end-tidal CO₂ and O₂ saturation were monitored. Adequate oxygen saturation and blood pressure were maintained by optimizing inotropics, volume, and inspired oxygen. The mean duration of ventilation was 10.17 ± 8.96 h (range, 1-73 h). There were no gross neurological complications. Postoperative pleural effusion developed in 6 (2.75%) patients, and 4 (1.83%) had nodal rhythm.

CD011912,0,10763532,0,[SIDS and polygraphy].,"The description of an association between central apneas and the sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) by Steinschneider et al. in 1972 was followed by a sharp rise of polygraphic studies. The hope to use these as a screening method for an increased risk of SIDS could subsequently not be confirmed by prospective studies. Pathological alterations, such as obstructive apneas and hypoxemias, however, seem to have prognostical relevance. They thus represent a focus of current research even though being unable as well to reliably predict a predisposition to SIDS for an individual subject. Instead of being used as a diagnostic tool for SIDS, polygraphic studies have nowadays acquired an accepted role in the investigation of certain physical symptoms and signs such as unexplained 'apparent life threatening events' (ALTE) or cyanotic attacks. Basic technical requirements for a polygraphic laboratory include facilities to record thoracic/abdominal respiration, nasal air flow, ECG/heart rate, oxygen saturation, and to classify different stages of sleep. Registration of additional parameters (EEG, breath sounds, video etc.) is optional, but may prove helpful to arrive at an appropriate diagnosis. Recently, Austrian and German centres have been trying in cooperation to standardize performance conditions and evaluation criteria for polygraphic measurements in pediatric patients under the guidance of the German Association for Sleep Medicine, Pediatric Workgroup. Their aim is to establish common guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of sleep and arousal disorders in infancy and childhood."

It was found that during severe hypoxemia (tcPO2 less than 40 mmHg and saturation less than 80%) pulse oximetry showed a better correlation with arterial saturation than tcPO2 with arterial oxygen tension. During mild hypoxemia and normoxemia (tcPO2 40-90 mmHg and saturation 80-95%) tcPO2 and pulse oximetry both showed a good correlation with arterial values. Above 95% saturation and a corresponding tcPO2 of 70-120 mmHg, the correlation between arterial and transcutaneous PO2 was better than that between pulse oximetric and arterial saturation. Computer recording and analysis of tcPO2 and pulse oximetry improves the quality of both noninvasive oxygenation parameters in older infants with BPD."

The patients were divided into two groups: group I with intact ventricular septum and group II with ventricular septal defect. In 12 group I patients, there was an increase of systemic arterial oxygen saturation [83 +/- 8% (mean +/- SD) vs. 94 +/- 5%, P less than 0.001] and pulmonary-to-systemic flow ratio (0.7 +/- 0.1 vs. 1.0 +/- 0.2, P less than 0.001). Peak systolic pressure gradient across the pulmonary valve decreased (P less than 0.001) from 105 +/- 48 to 25 +/- 18 mm Hg. In 11 group II patients, arterial oxygen saturation (67 +/- 13 vs. 83 +/- 13%, P less than 0.01) and pulmonary-to-systemic flow ratio (0.7 +/- 0.4 vs. 1.2 +/- 0.5, P less than 0.02) increased following valvuloplasty. Peak systolic pressure gradient across the pulmonic valve (52 +/- 16 vs. 32 +/- 22 mm Hg, P less than 0.05) decreased while infundibular and total pulmonary outflow tract gradients were unchanged (P greater than 0.1). Immediate surgical intervention was avoided in all cases in both groups. On follow-up, 1 to 36 months after valvuloplasty, arterial oxygen saturation, pulmonary-to-systemic flow ratio, and pulmonary valve gradients remain improved in both groups. However, in group I, repeat balloon valvuloplasty was required in two children. In group II, six children with tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) underwent successful total surgical correction 4 months to 2 years after valvuloplasty.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

The use of other non-invasive or invasive technologies (for example, continuous impedance cardiography, transesophageal Doppler and continuous pulse contour methods) is, in fact, quite problematic in neonates in whom relevant hemodynamic changes are common during the transition to postnatal life. For these reasons, use of transthoracic echocardiography, performed by skilled pediatric intensivists, is increasing in several dedicated centers to guide treatment choices in hemodynamically unstable neonates."

CD011912,0,6830668,0,Left to right atrial shunting in tricuspid atresia.,"In tricuspid atresia, an obligatory right to left shunt occurs at the atrial level. We have observed several patients with left to right interatrial shunts. Data from cardiac catheterisation in 40 consecutive patients were reviewed to determine the frequency and mechanism of left to right shunting in tricuspid atresia. An increase of 6% or more in oxygen saturation between the superior vena cava and the right atrium in two or more sets of saturations, representing a left to right shunt, was present in 29 out of 50 (58%) catheterisations in which the data were adequate. In most, the shunt was also seen cineangiographically in the laevophase. In only two catheterisations was an anatomical cause (ostium primum atrial septal defect in one and anomalous pulmonary venous return in the other) found. In the remaining 27 catheterisations, no anatomical cause was found. Age, Qp:Qs, and mean atrial pressure difference were similar between the shunt and non-shunt groups. In the shunt group right atrial ""a"" waves were equal to or higher than left atrial ""a"" waves and left atrial ""v"" waves were equal to or higher than right atrial ""v"" waves. Simultaneous pressure recordings (in one patient with left to right atrial shunt) from the left atrium and right atrium with isosensitised miniature pressure transducers mounted 5 cm apart showed (1) a higher pressure in the right atrium than in the left atrium during atrial systole and (2) a higher pressure in the left atrium than in the right atrium during atrial disatole. It is concluded that (a) left to right shunt across the atrial septum occurs frequently in tricuspid atresia and (b) the left to right shunt is the result of instantaneous pressure differences between the atria."

Desaturation time was defined as the time which elapsed between the onset of apnea and a 4% decrease in SpO2 from baseline. The desaturation times averaged 24 +/- 12 s, 56 +/- 34 s, and 58 +/- 28 s for the cheek, finger, and toe, respectively (n = 40; P < 0.0001 for cheek versus finger or toe). Resaturation time was defined as the interval between the resumption of ventilation and a 4% increase in SpO2 above the nadir. Resaturation times averaged 12 +/- 8 s for the cheek, 40 +/- 36 s for the finger, and 47 +/- 25 s for the toe (n = 40; P < 0.0001 for cheek versus finger or toe). A comparison of the kinetics at two central sensor sites, cheek and tongue, respectively, revealed no significant differences in desaturation times (20 +/- 10 s vs 21 +/- 9 s) or resaturation times (10 +/- 6 s vs 7 +/- 3 s) (n = 13). The authors conclude that both desaturation and resaturation are detected earlier by centrally placed sensors."
CD011912,0,25220120,0,Evidence for CCHD screening and its practical application using pulse oximetry.,"Pulse oximetry screening is a highly specific, moderately sensitive test for detecting critical congenital heart defects (CCHDs) that meets the criteria for universal screening. The possibility of using pulse oximetry as a screening test was first investigated over 10 years ago and since then data from more than 370,000 screened babies have now been published. There is significant heterogeneity in published screening protocols but almost all demonstrate that the addition of pulse oximetry screening reduces the 'diagnostic gap' - i.e. those babies with CCHD who are missed by existing screening methods and discharged from hospital before the diagnosis has been established. This review considers the available evidence and assesses the practical options for the introduction of pulse oximetry screening."

CD011912,0,6496424,0,Impairment of urate excretion in patients with cardiac disease.,"The serum uric acid levels and uric acid clearance rates were evaluated in 28 patients who had congenital heart disease. Based on hemodynamic assessments, the patients were divided into three groups: group 1, with normal cardiac output and normal arterial oxygen saturation; group 2, with hypoxemia (normal cardiac output with a decreased arterial oxygen saturation); and group 3, with cardiomyopathy (decreased cardiac output). The blood levels of uric acid were elevated in group 3. The mean serum uric acid levels were as follows: group 1, 4.2 mg/dL; group 2, 4.8 mg/dL; and group 3, 11.7 mg/dL. All the patients in groups 2 and 3 had decreased uric acid clearance rates. The mean uric acid clearance rates were as follows: group 1, 10.1 mL/min/sq m; group 2, 4.2 mL/min/sq m; and group 3, 1.7 mL/min/sq m. The patients in group 3 had the most severe abnormalities. Patients with congenital heart disease may have marked impairment of their uric acid excretion, which can occur in the absence of significant renal disease, and may be found in acyanotic as well as cyanotic patients."

Regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO2) and cerebrovascular pulsatility index (PI) were measured by NIRS and TCD, respectively, in 111 pediatric patients undergoing bypass for CHD repair randomized to pulsatile (n = 77) or nonpulsatile (n = 34) perfusion. No significant differences in demographic and intraoperative data, including surgical risk stratification, existed between groups. Patients undergoing pulsatile perfusion had numerically lower decreases in rSO2 from baseline for all time points analyzed compared with the nonpulsatile group, with significant ∼12% lower decreases at 40 and 60 min after crossclamp. Patients undergoing pulsatile perfusion had numerically lower decreases in PI from baseline for the majority of time points compared with the nonpulsatile group, with significant ∼30% lower decreases between 5 and 40 min after crossclamp. Pulsatile flow has advantages over nonpulsatile flow as measured by NIRS and TCD, especially at advanced time points, which may improve postoperative neurodevelopmental outcomes."

CD011912,0,9680274,0,Effects of positive pressure ventilation and inspired oxygen on pulmonary vascular resistance and tissue oxygen delivery in neonatal pigs.,"Management of pulmonary vascular resistance in neonates with congenital heart disease is important for stabilization before and after surgical interventions. Thus, we determined which combination of positive end-expiratory pressure ventilation and fraction of oxygen in the inspired air increases pulmonary vascular resistance without compromising delivery of oxygen to the tissue. Eight piglets were anesthetized, intubated and ventilated. Pulmonary flow and pulmonary arterial and left atrial pressures were monitored continuously. At all levels of inspired oxygen (1.00, 0.21 and 0.15), ventilation at a pressure of 15 cm of water increased pulmonary vascular resistance. At all levels of positive pressure ventilation, a fraction of 0.15 of inspired oxygen increased pulmonary vascular resistance. The combination of a ventilatory pressure of 15 cm of water and inspired oxygen of 1.00, or ventilatory pressure at 5 cm of water and oxygen delivery of 0.15, produced similar changes in pulmonary vascular resistance (19.1 +/- 2.8 vs. 20.0 +/- 3.8 mmHg/(L/min)) and cardiac output (0.78 +/- 0.07 vs. 0.93 +/- 0.10 L/min) but, the higher level of positive pressure plus 1.00 inspired oxygen gave a significantly higher arterial oxygen saturation (0.99 +/- 0.03 vs. 0.72 +/- 0.19%) and delivery of oxygen to the tissues (13.7 +/- 2.9 vs. 7.4 +/- 1.5 ml O2/min, p < 0.05). Thus, both high positive pressure ventilation and hypoxia increase pulmonary vascular resistance. Only high pressure ventilation plus high concentrations of inspired oxygen, however, increased pulmonary vascular resistance without compromising delivery of oxygen, suggesting that this combination is a superior means of increasing pulmonary vascular resistance."
CD011912,0,7094234,0,Long-term results after atrial repair of transposition of the great arteries in early infancy.,"Fifty-two patients younger than age 100 days who had an intact interventricular septum or a small ventricular septal defect underwent atrial repair of d-transposition of the great arteries (d-TGA). No patient died. To assess long-term results, we evaluated all 36 patients who had been followed for at least 1.5 years (mean 2.7 years) after surgery. The physical findings, chest roentgenograms, ECGs and echocardiograms were reviewed. Catheterization was done 6-60 months (mean 15 months) after surgery in 28 patients. Growth was normal in all but three patients. Neurologic development was abnormal in six patients (delayed speech in one patient, learning disability in three patients and preoperative cerebral infarction in two patients). The ECG showed sinus rhythm in 24 patients, minor abnormalities in nine and major dysrhythmias in three. Catheterization showed a normal cardiac index in all 28 patients. No intracardiac shunt was detected in 19 of 24 patients in whom complete oximetry data were available. One patient required reoperation for persistent atrial shunt and subsequent pacemaker placement. Two patients required baffle revision for symptoms related to superior vena caval obstruction. Right ventricular end-diastolic pressure was less than 15 mm Hg in all of 18 patients evaluated. We conclude that atrial repair of d-TGA in early infancy can be performed with a low mortality rate and a low incidence of late complications."

CD011912,0,20523077,0,It is time for routine neonatal screening by pulse oximetry.,"Most pediatric cardiologists believe that pulse oximetry helps to diagnose critical congenital heart disease in neonates who might otherwise be discharged from the newborn nursery undiagnosed. Some of these patients develop catastrophic cardiac and multi-system failure after the ductus closes and die or suffer severe morbidity. Nevertheless, pulse oximetry is not universally used in the newborn nursery. Some pediatricians believe that they can always detect these patients from physical findings, many believe that oximeters are unreliable, and others are concerned about costs of investigating false positive tests. Recent studies, however, show that even cardiologists miss critical congenital heart defects, modern oximeters are stable and reliable, and that the false positive rate is very low, lower than the false positive rate based on physical examination. The benefits probably exceed the cost, and evidence is provided to confirm this. There is no reason not to use pulse oximetry routinely in the newborn nursery."
CD011912,0,16830075,0,Cytokine response in children undergoing surgery for congenital heart disease.,"Pediatric cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) induces a complex inflammatory response that may cause multiorgan dysfunction. The objective of this study was to measure postoperative cytokine production and correlate the magnitude of this response with intraoperative variables and postoperative outcomes. Serum samples from 20 children (median age, 15 months) undergoing cardiac surgery with CPB were obtained preoperatively and on postoperative days (POD) 1-3. Serum levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and IL-10 increased significantly on POD 1 (p < 0.01) vs pre-op values to 271 +/- 68, 44 +/- 9, 7.5 +/- 0.8 pg/ml, respectively, whereas serum IL-1beta, IL-12, and tumor neurosis factor -alpha were not significantly changed. The serum IL-6 and IL-8 levels correlated positively (p < 0.01) with the degree of postoperative medical intervention as measured by the Therapeutic Interventional Scoring System and indicated a greater need for inotropic support (p = 0.057). A negative correlation (p < 0.01) between IL-6, IL-8, and mixed venous oxygen saturation suggested compromised cardiopulmonary function. Patients with single ventricle anatomy had the highest levels of IL-6 and IL-8 (629 +/- 131 and 70 +/- 17 pg/ml, respectively), with a mean CPB time of 106 +/- 23 minutes. Thus, the proinflammatory response after surgery with CPB was associated with postoperative morbidity with increased need for medical intervention."
CD011912,0,1694938,0,The bidirectional cavopulmonary shunt.,"The bidirectional cavopulmonary shunt improves systemic arterial oxygen saturation without increasing ventricular work or pulmonary vascular resistance. Since 1983, 17 patients have undergone a cavopulmonary shunt procedure (five primary operations, 12 secondary operations). Diagnoses were single ventricle complex (n = 4), hypoplastic right heart syndrome (n = 10), and hypoplastic left ventricle (n = 3). Age at primary operation ranged from 3 1/2 to 30 months (median 6 months). Weight ranged from 3.5 to 9.7 kg. Age at secondary operation ranged from 10 months to 14 years (median 15 months). Seven cavopulmonary shunt operations were performed without cardiopulmonary bypass (six via thoracotomy and one via sternotomy) and 10, with cardiopulmonary bypass. All patients in the bypass group had additional procedures: takedown of modified Blalock-Taussig shunt, seven patients; revision of right ventricular outflow tract, four patients; reconstruction of pulmonary arteries, four patients; tricuspid valvuloplasty, one patient; and Damus procedure, one patient. There was one (1/17) operative death (Damus procedure). One patient required early revision. Follow-up ranges from 1 to 53 months (median 23 months). Twelve of 16 had a good to excellent late result, with a rise in mean arterial oxygen saturation from 69% to 83%. Three patients died late (4 to 53 months) (pulmonary vascular disease, pulmonary arteriovenous malformations, and pneumonia, one patient each). There was one late failure (converted to Glenn shunt). The cavopulmonary shunt is an excellent palliative procedure when right atrium-pulmonary artery connection (modified Fontan) must be deferred because of age, weight, or anatomic considerations. Five patients have undergone right atrium-pulmonary artery connection later. In addition, at the time of the modified Fontan operation, the cavopulmonary shunt approach may optimize the anatomic connection (eight additional patients)."

CD011912,0,16132313,0,Propofol and propofol-ketamine in pediatric patients undergoing cardiac catheterization.,"We investigated the effects of propofol and propofol-ketamine on hemodynamics, sedation level, and recovery period in pediatric patients undergoing cardiac catheterization. We performed a prospective, randomized, double-blind study. The study included 60 American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status II or III (age range, 1 month-13 years) undergoing cardiac catheterization for evaluation of congenital heart disease. Propofol and ketamine were prepared in 5% glucose solution to a final concentration of 5 and 1 mg/ml, respectively; similar injectors containing 5% glucose solution only were prepared. Fentanyl (1 microg/kg) and propofol (1.5 mg/kg) were given to both groups. Then, group 1 received 0.5 ml/kg of 5% glucose and group 2 0.5 ml/kg of ketamine solution by an anesthesiologist who was unaware of the groups of patients. Local anesthesia with 1% lidocaine was administered before intervention in all patients. The noninvasively measured mean arterial pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and peripheral oxygen saturation were recorded at the baseline, following drug administration, at 3, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 30 minutes and then at 15-minute intervals until the end of the procedure. Additional drug and fentanyl requirements to maintain a sedation level of 4 or 5 were recorded. After the procedure, the time to a Steward recovery score of 6 and adverse effects in the first 24 hours were recorded. The number of patients with more than a 20% decrease in mean arterial pressure was 11 in group 1 and 3 in group 2 (p < 0.05). The number of patients who experienced more than a 20% decrease in heart rate was 12 in group 1 and 5 in group 2 (p = 0.054). Ten patients in group 1 and 3 patients in group 2 required additional fentanyl doses (p = 0.057). The number of additional propofol doses was lower in group 2 (p < 0.05). Propofol combined with low-dose ketamine preserves mean arterial pressure better without affecting the recovery and thus is a good option in pediatric patients undergoing cardiac catheterization."

CD011912,0,26611664,0,The Coagulative Profile of Cyanotic Children Undergoing Cardiac Surgery: The Role of Whole Blood Preoperative Thromboelastometry on Postoperative Transfusion Requirement.,"The objective of this study is to evaluate the preoperative coagulation pattern and its association to postoperative blood products transfusion in children with congenital heart disease (CHD), focusing on cyanotic patients (oxygen saturation, SATO 2  < 85%). From January to August 2014, preoperative standard coagulation tests and rotational thromboelastometry assays were performed on 81 pediatric patients (<16 years old) who underwent surgery for CHD with the aid of cardiopulmonary bypass. Sixty patients (74%) were acyanotic and 21 (26%) cyanotic. Mean age at time of surgery was 7.9 months (interquartile range 2.9-43.6 months). Cyanotic patients had a significantly higher hematocrit (P < 0.001), a reduced prothrombin activity (PT) (P = 0.01) level, and a lower platelet count (P = 0.02) than acyanotic patients. An inverse linear association was found between patient's SATO2 and clot formation time (CFT) (INTEM, P = 0.001, and EXTEM, P < 0.0001). A direct linear association was found between patient's SATO2 and maximum clot firmness (MCF) (INTEM, P = 0.04, and EXTEM, P = 0.05). Preoperative cyanosis was also associated with a lower median MCF in FIBTEM (P = 0.02). Cyanotic patients required more frequent postoperative transfusions of fibrinogen (7/21 patients, 33% vs. 4/60 patients, 6.7%, P = 0.01) and fresh frozen plasma (14/21, 67% vs. 25/60, 42%, P = 0.08). Patients with a lower presurgery PT and platelet count subsequently required more fibrinogen transfusion P = 0.02 and P = 0.003, respectively); the same goes for patients with a longer CFT (INTEM, P = 0.01 and EXTEM, P = 0.03) and a reduced MCF (INTEM, P = 0.02 and FIBTEM, P = 0.01) as well. Cyanotic patients showed significant preoperative coagulation anomalies and required a higher postoperative fibrinogen supplementation. The preoperative MCF FIBTEM has become an important factor in our postoperative thromboelastometry-guided transfusion protocols."
CD011912,0,12878954,0,Sodium nitroprusside infusion after bidirectional superior cavopulmonary connection: preserved cerebral blood flow velocity and systemic oxygenation.,"Systemic hypertension is common in patients after bidirectional superior cavopulmonary connection. It can be treated with a vasodilator, such as sodium nitroprusside. However, it is possible that systemic hypertension is necessary to maintain cerebral blood flow in the face of cerebral venous hypertension. Furthermore, bidirectional superior cavopulmonary connection places the cerebral and pulmonary vascular beds in series. Thus treatment of systemic hypertension by lowering blood pressure might decrease cerebral blood flow, pulmonary blood flow, and systemic oxygen levels. The aim of the current study was to determine the effects of sodium nitroprusside on cerebral blood flow velocity and systemic oxygenation in patients after bidirectional superior cavopulmonary connection."
CD011912,0,3968910,0,Modified Blalock-Taussig shunt in infants and young children. Clinical and catheterization assessment.,"The effectiveness of 19 modified Blalock-Taussig shunts performed with expanded polytetrafluoroethylene was evaluated clinically and by cardiac catheterization with angiography 4 to 24 months after operation. Fifteen patients underwent operation in infancy. Conduit diameters included 4 mm (nine cases), 5 mm (eight cases), and 6 mm (two cases) sizes. Two of the 4 mm conduits failed after 1 year following implantation. The remaining 17 shunts (89%) remained widely patent. In patients with patent shunts, the oxygen saturation values were significantly improved from the preoperative values. Two children demonstrated associated subclavian artery occlusion distal to the graft anastomosis. There were no deaths. Thirteen children underwent more complete elective cardiac repair 5 to 24 months later. Although the modified Blalock-Taussig procedure is an effective short-term alternative to the classic Blalock-Taussig shunt, the effectiveness of the 4 mm diameter conduit may be limited without postoperative anticoagulant therapy."
CD011912,0,11299209,0,"Modeling of the Norwood circulation: effects of shunt size, vascular resistances, and heart rate.","Hypoplastic left heart syndrome is the most common lethal cardiac malformation of the newborn. Its treatment, apart from heart transplantation, is the Norwood operation. The initial procedure for this staged repair consists of reconstructing a circulation where a single outlet from the heart provides systemic perfusion and an interpositioning shunt contributes blood flow to the lungs. To better understand this unique physiology, a computational model of the Norwood circulation was constructed on the basis of compartmental analysis. Influences of shunt diameter, systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance, and heart rate on the cardiovascular dynamics and oxygenation were studied. Simulations showed that 1) larger shunts diverted an increased proportion of cardiac output to the lungs, away from systemic perfusion, resulting in poorer O2 delivery, 2) systemic vascular resistance exerted more effect on hemodynamics than pulmonary vascular resistance, 3) systemic arterial oxygenation was minimally influenced by heart rate changes, 4) there was a better correlation between venous O2 saturation and O2 delivery than between arterial O2 saturation and O2 delivery, and 5) a pulmonary-to-systemic blood flow ratio of 1 resulted in optimal O2 delivery in all physiological states and shunt sizes."
CD011912,0,10722910,0,Calculating blood flow from Doppler measurements in the systemic-to-pulmonary artery shunt after the Norwood operation: a method based on computational fluid dynamics.,"Hypoplastic left heart syndrome is currently the most lethal cardiac malformation of the newborn infant. Survival following a Norwood operation depends on the balance between systemic and pulmonary blood flow, which is highly dependent on the fluid dynamics through the interposition shunt between the two circulations. We used computational fluid dynamic (CFD) models to determine the velocity profile in a systemic-to-pulmonary artery shunt and suggested a simplified method of calculating the blood flow in the shunt based on Doppler measurements. CFD models of systemic-to-pulmonary shunts based on the finite element method were studied. The size of the shunt has been varied from 3 to 5 mm. Velocity profiles at proximal and distal positions were evaluated and correlations between maximum and mean spatial velocity were found. Twenty-one Doppler measurements in the proximal and distal part of the shunt were obtained from six patients with hypoplastic left heart syndrome. Combining Doppler velocities and CFD velocity profiles, blood flow rate in the shunt was calculated. Flow rate evaluated from aortic Doppler and oxygen saturation measurements were performed for comparison. Results showed that proximal shunt Doppler velocities were always greater than the correspondent distal ones (ratio equal to 1.15 +/- 0.11). CFD models showed a similar behaviour (ratio equal to 1.21 +/- 0.03). CFD models gave a V(mean)/V(max) ratio of 0. 480 at the proximal junction and of 0.579 at the distal one. The agreement between the flow evaluated in the proximal and distal areas of the shunt was good (0.576 +/- 0.150 vs. 0.610 +/- 0.166 l/min). Comparison of these data with saturation data and aortic Doppler measurements correlate less well (0.593 +/- 0.156 vs. 1.023 +/- 0.493 l/min). A formula easily to quantify shunt flow rate is proposed. This could be used to evaluate the effects of different therapeutic and pharmacological manoeuvres in this unique circulation."

CD011912,0,2741470,0,Pulse oximetry during shunt surgery in pediatric patients with tetralogy of fallot.,"Pulse oximetry is a noninvasive technique for measuring O2 saturation (SpO2) continuously. We applied pulse oximetry to 9 pediatric patients with tetralogy of Fallot during shunt surgery. Arterial oxygen tensions (PaO2) and saturations (SaO2) were also measured at the time of postinduction, just before the shunt, after the shunt and at the end of the operation. The SpO2 and SaO2 levels were identically changed in all 4 periods. The PaO2 was increased a little without statistical significance after the shunt procedure and at the end of the operation compared with the values before the shunt. However, SaO2 values increased with statistical significance after the shunt procedure and SpO2 values also showed similar increases with significance. In conclusion, continuous monitoring of SpO2 by pulse oximetry, instead of PaO2, is a very useful and reliable method to assess the improvement of perfusion after shunt, particularly in cyanotic cases."

The entry criteria for this study were preoperative hemoglobin value above 10 g/dl and expected CPB time of less than 120 minutes. Acyanotic heart diseases such as ventricular or atrial septal defect were the main lesion, but some cases of tetralogy of Fallot and single ventricle were also included in this study. Intraoperative saving of autologous blood and autotransfusion using cell saver were carried out in a part of the subjects. Acceptable lowest values for hemoglobin was 4-5 g/dl and 40% for mixed venous oxygen saturation. As the results, 18 patients tolerated CPB without transfusion and eventually 16 patients were discharged without transfusion at all. The body weight for those without transfusion was 13.9 kg in average and the lowest was 6.8 kg. The significant factor affecting the needs for homologous blood transfusion was prolonged CPB time over 120 minutes. Although there was a tendency that the patients with body weight less than 15 kg received transfusion more frequently than those with body weight more than 15 kg, the body weight was not necessarily a limiting factor. Pre-CPB blood saving and intraoperative autotransfusion were the positive factors for successful non-transfusion open heart surgery."

CD011912,0,19154627,0,The monitoring of venous saturations of oxygen in children with congenitally malformed hearts.,"Mixed venous saturation of oxygen has for some time been used as a tool to assess the adequacy of systemic delivery of oxygen in intensive care. In the post-operative child with cardiac disease, it is increasingly being used to assess adequacy of cardiac output. In many of these patients, true sampling of mixed venous saturation of oxygen is not possible due to the infrequent use of pulmonary arterial catheters, or the presence of intra-cardiac left to right shunting leading to mixing of systemic and pulmonary venous blood. The use of saturation of oxygen in the central venous blood as a surrogate for mixed venous saturation of oxygen has been widely investigated in adults, but its use remains controversial. In this review, we discuss the theory behind the use of mixed venous saturation of oxygen in evaluating cardiac output, the problems pertinent to those patients with congenitally malformed hearts, and explore the evidence for central venous saturation of oxygen as a surrogate for mixed venous saturation of oxygen, and its use as a therapeutic target to improve outcomes in this population of patients."
CD011912,0,2614871,0,Determination of left to right shunt by thermodilution in patients with ventricular septal defect.,"A modified thermodilution technique was used to determine the quantity of shunt in patients suffering from congenital heart disease with a left to right shunt. In our modification, the thermistor was placed within the pulmonary artery and an indicator was injected into both sides of the heart. In a series of 33 cardiac catheterizations in children (1-17 years) with ventricular septal defect (VSD), pulmonary blood flow (Qp), systemic blood flow (Qs) and the ratio of Qp to Qs (Qp/Qs) were determined by this and ordinary oximetry (Fick) methods. Correlation coefficients between indexes obtained by these methods were 0.54 (Qp), 0.78 (Qs), and 0.75 (Qp/Qs). The estimates of Qp and Qp/Qs obtained by thermodilution were smaller than those obtained by the Fick method. This modification of thermodilution is simple, rapid, and useful in clinical practice."
CD011912,0,6419575,0,Two-dimensional contrast echocardiography with carbon dioxide in the detection of congenital cardiac shunts.,"Medically pure (100%) carbon dioxide directly injected into a peripheral vein was used for 2-dimensional contrast echocardiography in 134 patients with an arteriovenous shunt demonstrated by cardiac catheterization and cineangiography, Qp/Qs ratios of 1.5 to 3.7, pulmonary-to-systemic peak systolic pressure ratios of 0.2 to 0.8 and no oximetrically demonstrable venoarterial shunt. Two patients with transposition of the great arteries, intact ventricular septum and a Senning operation as well as 30 normal subjects of comparable age also were studied. In patients with an atrial septal defect, the gas microbubbles opacified the left atrium. In patients with a ventricular septal defect, the gas microbubbles opacified the left ventricle, whereas the left atrium was free of contrast. In all patients with patent ductus arteriosus, the gas microbubbles opacified the abdominal aorta, whereas the left atrium, left ventricle, aortic root and aortic arch remained free of contrast. In 2 patients in whom an aneurysm of the sinus of Valsalva ruptured into the right ventricle, the ""negative"" contrast effect permitted localization of the shunt. In 2 patients with transposition of the great arteries, an intact ventricular septum and a Senning operation, the intracardiac flow pattern was clearly demonstrated. No complication was observed. We conclude that pure carbon dioxide directly injected into a peripheral vein is a safe and advantageous echocardiographic contrast material. Because of its greater diffusibility in comparison with oxygen and fluid contrast media, small venoarterial shunting can be detected in defects such as atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect and patent ductus arteriosus, in which only an arteriovenous shunt can be demonstrated by oximetry."
CD011912,0,25344148,0,Inter-society consensus document on treatment and prevention of bronchiolitis in newborns and infants.,"Acute bronchiolitis is the leading cause of lower respiratory tract infection and hospitalization in children less than 1 year of age worldwide. It is usually a mild disease, but some children may develop severe symptoms, requiring hospital admission and ventilatory support in the ICU. Infants with pre-existing risk factors (prematurity, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, congenital heart diseases and immunodeficiency) may be predisposed to a severe form of the disease. Clinical diagnosis of bronchiolitis is manly based on medical history and physical examination (rhinorrhea, cough, crackles, wheezing and signs of respiratory distress). Etiological diagnosis, with antigen or genome detection to identify viruses involved, may have a role in reducing hospital transmission of the infection. Criteria for hospitalization include low oxygen saturation (<90-92%), moderate-to-severe respiratory distress, dehydration and presence of apnea. Children with pre-existing risk factors should be carefully assessed.To date, there is no specific treatment for viral bronchiolitis, and the mainstay of therapy is supportive care. This consists of nasal suctioning and nebulized 3% hypertonic saline, assisted feeding and hydration, humidified O2 delivery. The possible role of any pharmacological approach is still debated, and till now there is no evidence to support the use of bronchodilators, corticosteroids, chest physiotherapy, antibiotics or antivirals. Nebulized adrenaline may be sometimes useful in the emergency room. Nebulized adrenaline can be useful in the hospital setting for treatment as needed. Lacking a specific etiological treatment, prophylaxis and prevention, especially in children at high risk of severe infection, have a fundamental role. Environmental preventive measures minimize viral transmission in hospital, in the outpatient setting and at home. Pharmacological prophylaxis with palivizumab for RSV bronchiolitis is indicated in specific categories of children at risk during the epidemic period. Viral bronchiolitis, especially in the case of severe form, may correlate with an increased incidence of recurrent wheezing in pre-schooled children and with asthma at school age.The aim of this document is to provide a multidisciplinary update on the current recommendations for the management and prevention of bronchiolitis, in order to share useful indications, identify gaps in knowledge and drive future research."

We examined 308 children with CCHD over an 8 years' period finding 39 cases (= 12,7) of NC. There were 5 hypoxic attacks and 3 brain abscesses. In 31 patients a cerebro-vascular accident was proven or probable. 56% of NC occured during the first year of life, most frequently in children with simple TGA. Mortality was not influenced by NC. Children without NC, surviving the first year of life represent the control group for comparison of the following hematologic parameters: erythrocytes, hematocrit, MCHC, hemoglobin, O2-saturation, platelets count. Only the last two were significantly lower in patients with NC, but no parameter allows to predict NC. The hypothesis of hypochromic, microcytic anemia as essential pathogenetic factor for cerebro-vascular accidents has no base in our material."
CD011912,0,3573778,0,Nitroprusside abolishes the deleterious effects of surface cooling-induced hypothermia on immature pigs with ventricular septal defects.,"The efficacy of systemic hypothermia in combination with cardiopulmonary bypass for the repair of congenital cardiac malformations is established. Surface cooling in infants with ventricular septal defects as a prebypass adjunct has been associated with visceral ischemic complications. Surface cooling in infant pigs with ventricular septal defects results in increased systemic vascular resistance and unchanged pulmonary vascular resistance with increased left-to-right shunting and a maldistribution of blood flow away from the viscera and kidneys. This study was to determine whether nitroprusside ameliorates the deleterious effects of increased systemic vascular resistance during hypothermia in infant pigs with ventricular septal defects. Nine neonatal pigs (4 weeks, 4 kg) had experimental ventricular septal defects resulting in a 2.3 +/- 0.3: 1 shunt. Systemic and pulmonary vascular resistances were determined by the flow probe and microsphere techniques. Systemic and pulmonary blood flow distributions were measured by the microsphere technique. Left-to-right shunt ratios were determined by oximetry, flow probe, and microsphere. The pigs were cooled to 28 degrees C and measurements were made at 37 degrees, 32 degrees, and 28 degrees C. We found that nitroprusside abolishes the deleterious effects of surface cooling by blocking the rise of systemic vascular resistance without significant changes in aortic pressure. As a result, the animals maintained control pulmonary-to-systemic flow levels and maintained control levels of oxygen delivery while showing a decline in oxygen consumption. Additionally, the vasodilatory effect allowed the animals to cool twice as fast as animals without nitroprusside. Regional blood flow distribution as percent cardiac output and absolute tissue flow were protected during surface cooling. This technique may have a role in cardiac operations on infants with left-to-right shunts."

CD011912,0,23986282,0,Early postoperative interventional ASD-closure for severe atrial right to left shunt in a neonate with common arterial trunk.,"Although closure of an atrial septal defect (ASD II) with an occluding device in the first year of life is not a routine procedure, it is a feasible treatment, even in neonates. Case reports on the off-label use of Amplatzer devices have been repeatedly published, but there are no reports on using the Amplatzer Duct Occluder (ADO) to close an atrial septal defect in a neonate. We report on a successful catheter closure of an ASD II with ADO in a severely cyanotic neonate, seven days after surgical repair of common arterial trunk. Due to progressive cyanosis and clinical signs of right ventricular failure, which developed after common arterial trunk repair, the neonate underwent cardiac catheterization. Diastolic filling impairment of the right ventricle (right ventricle hypertrophy, pulmonary regurgitation, and residual right ventricle outflow tract obstruction) was thought to be the cause of impaired right ventricle diastolic filling, resulting in the right-to-left shunt at the atrial level. Under transesophageal echocardiographic guidance, ADO was delivered through a 5 French sheath into the atrial septal defect. Amplatzer duct occluder closed the defect and proved to be stable in position after disconnection. During the procedure, the child was stable and then transferred to the intensive care unit with significantly improved oxygen saturation. This is the first report on placing a duct occluder in the atrial septal position, which is a novel procedure for-small neonates."

However, the cerebral oxygenation state has rarely been studied, and there is concern about neurologic development. In eight infants with CHD accompanied by increased pulmonary blood flow, hypoxia was induced after a 1-h baseline period in room air (FiO2, 0.21). The infants were simultaneously monitored in both the front-temporal region and the right-brachial region for 90 min using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). The minimum SaO2 (pulse oximetry) after hypoxic gas administration was 80.8 +/- 2.9% when the minimum FiO2 was 16.2 +/- 1.1%. With a decrease in SaO2, oxy-Hb (O2Hb) decreased and total Hb [cHb: O2Hb + deoxy-Hb (HHb)] increased in both regions in the majority of infants. HHb increased in both regions with a decrease in SaO2. The maximum change in the tissue oxygenation index (TOI: O2Hb/cHb x 100) was -8.3 +/- 2.6% in the front-temporal region and -3.6 +/- 2.3% in the right-brachial region. Cerebral oxygenation decreased despite an increase in cerebral blood flow during hypoxic gas management. The change in TOI was < or =10% when the SaO2 was > or =80%. Safer control of SaO2 should be maintained over 80% for hypoxia management in CHD based on the results of the present study."

CD011912,0,17203337,0,Cerebral near infrared spectroscopy is a reliable marker of systemic perfusion in awake single ventricle children.,"Clinical assessment of systemic perfusion in single ventricle patients with parallel circulation can be difficult in the outpatient setting. Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a noninvasive measure of cerebral oximetry. We measured vital signs, pulse oximetry, and NIRS in 20 single ventricle patients with parallel circulation prior to routine cardiac catheterization. These variables were evaluated to determine the best noninvasive predictor of the superior vena cava saturation (SVC(sat)) as a marker for the adequacy of systemic oxygen delivery. The mean age was 6.7 months [standard deviation (SD), 8.6] and mean weight was 6.5 kg (SD, 2.2). Diagnoses were hypoplastic left heart syndrome (8), tricuspid or pulmonary atresia (10), and double-outlet right ventricle variants (2), all prior to cavo pulmonary anastomoses or complete repairs. Stepwise multiple regression analysis generated a model in which only NIRS was a significant independent predictor of SVC(sat) (p = 0.009). These results support the conclusion that NIRS can be a useful tool to evaluate awake single ventricle patients in the outpatient setting."
CD011912,0,27530240,0,Newborn pulse oximetry screening in practice.,"The concept of using pulse oximetry (PO) as a screening test to identify newborn babies with critical congenital heart defects (CCHD) before life-threatening collapse occurs has been debated for some time now. Several recent large studies have consistently shown that PO screening adds value to existing screening techniques with over 90% of CCHDs detected. It can also help identify newborn babies with low oxygen saturations due to infection, respiratory disease and non-critical CCHD. Many countries have now introduced PO screening as routine practice, and as screening gains more widespread acceptance in the UK, we have focused more on the practical aspects of screening in this article. This includes case reports to demonstrate how the different screening modalities for CCHD work together and the experience of hospitals that have already introduced PO screening programmes (Birmingham Women's Hospital and others). Issues discussed include how and when to screen babies in hospital, what to do with a positive screen and how to screen babies born at home. The UK National Screening Committee is currently investigating the potential feasibility of routine PO screening in the UK, and so it is perhaps a suitable time for individual hospitals to consider the possibility of introducing such screening in their maternity units."

CD011912,0,369510,0,Radionuclide quantitation of left-to-right cardiac shunts in children.,"In order to evaluate the clinical usefulness of radionuclide methods measuring the magnitude of left-to-right cardiac shunts, a comparison has been made of the results obtained using these procedures with those estimated by cardiac catheterization. Seventy children in whom the presence or absence of a shunt had been established, were studied. Two methods for radionuclide shunt quantitation, the pulmonary to systemic blood flow ratio (Qp/Qs) of Maltz and Treves and their modified C2/C1, were evaluated. The former was found to be superior and showed a high correlation of shunt size with the catheter results. With attention to the performance of the investigation and in the data analysis, good discrimination can be achieved between normal patients and those with shunts. Because of the atraumatic nature of the investigation, it is concluded that the procedure is of value in the diagnosis of a cardiac murmur, the assessment of postoperative patients and the follow-up of patients known to have a small shunt."

Immediate and late results].,"Seventy one patients with complete transposition of the great arteries (TGA) who underwent balloon atrial septostomy (BAS) were studied, with the purpose to evaluate its early and late results within the first year of life. Fifty four patients were male (76,1%) and 17 female (23,9%), aged 2 days to 11 months (mean = 2,3 +/- 0,3%), being 46,5% less than 1 month old. Increase in mean aortic oxygen saturation (Ox. Sat.) after BAS was highly significant (p less than 0,001), irrespective of age and morphological features of TGA. Analysis of the group of 55 patients who underwent only BAS during the first year of life showed: mean age in the 13 non-survivors was 3,3 +/- 0,2 months; increase in Ox.Sat. was highly significant in the 42 survivors and not significant in the 13 patients who died; mortality in children with and without patent ductus arteriosus was 23,1% and 23,8%, respectively. Death directly related do BAS occurred in 2 patients (2,8%), without other complications being observed. We conclude that BAS is an effective and low-risk procedure, even in neonates with poor clinical condition. Early response to BAS is predictive of survival in the first year of life."
CD011912,0,10497674,0,Bidirectional cavopulmonary anastomosis.,"The Fontan operation has been used to palliate patients with a functional single ventricle. In many such patients the operative risk for a Fontan procedure is high. The bidirectional cavopulmonary anastomosis (BCPA) is a useful intermediate palliative procedure before Fontan correction. It may reduce the deleterious sequelae of chronic hypoxaemia and long-term ventricular overload, thus yielding a more suitable Fontan candidate. We reviewed our experience of 9 patients with univentricular hearts who were at the time of the BCPA not considered suitable candidates for conventional Fontan operation. Two patients had double inlet right ventricle (DIRV) with pulmonary stenosis (PS) and ventricular septal defect (VSD), 2 had univentricular heart, 4 had tricuspid atresia (TA) and hypoplastic right ventricle (RV), 1 patient had atrioventricular septal defect (AVSD) with double outlet right ventricle (DORV) with hypoplastic RV. Two of the 9 patients had bilateral superior vena cavae. All except one had undergone prior palliative operations. The mean age at BCPA was 4.7 years (range 1.5 years to 6 years) and the mean weight at surgery was 15 kg (range 7 to 22 kg). There were no operative deaths. The mean hospitalization stay was 8.5 days (range 5 to 13 days) with a mean follow up of 14 months. Median oxygen saturation improved from 78.7 +/- 6.3% to 85.9 +/- 3.9%. The BCPA is a useful palliative procedure to stage Fontan type reconstruction in selected patients with univentricular hearts."

We report 53 infants of d-TGA palliated with BAS in the period 1972 - 88 (mean age 2.03 +/- 1.32 months, mean weight 3.44 +/- 0.58 kg). 44 infants had an intact ventricular septum. The mean pre-BAS systemic oxygen saturation was 37.29 +/- 8.41% which rose to 53 +/- 13.6% after a successful septostomy. The procedure was successful in 83% of the infants and caused 3 deaths (5.7%) all part of our early experience. Balloon deflation failure (1) was encountered only in the earlier years. Follow up is available in 30 infants upto 2.8 years. Cynosis and congestive failure improved uniformly post procedure. The improvement was maintained at an average of 5 months. 5 deaths (16%) occurred at an average of 7.6 months. 5 patients underwent definitive repair. We conclude that BAS is safe and effective in palliation of infants with d-TGA and that the gain with BAS is at best a temporary measure before definitive surgery."
CD011912,0,7124637,0,Early assessment of hemodynamic status after repair of tetralogy of Fallot: a comparison of 24 hour (intensive care unit) and 1 year postoperative data in 98 patients.,"Hemodynamic data obtained in the intensive care unit, immediately after repair of tetralogy of Fallot, were compared with measurements obtained at 1 year postoperative catheterization in 98 infants and children. Eight of 12 patients who had pulmonary artery oxygen saturation of 80% or greater in the intensive care unit had a pulmonary to systemic flow ratio greater than 1.5 at catheterization; all 79 patients who had a pulmonary artery oxygen saturation of ess than 80% in the intensive care unit had a pulmonary to systemic flow ratio of 1.5 or less at catheterization. Five of six patients who had a right ventricular outflow tract pressure gradient greater than 40 mm Hg in the intensive care unit had a gradient greater than 40 mm Hg at catheterization; 7 of 61 patients who had a right ventricular outflow tract gradient of 40 mm Hg or less in the intensive care unit had a gradient greater than 40 mm Hg at catheterization. The addition of measurements of right ventricular pressure and the right ventricular to systemic arterial pressure ratio in the intensive care unit did not improve sensitivity in identifying patients with a right ventricular outflow tract gradient greater than 40 mm Hg at catheterization. Intensive care unit measurement of pulmonary artery oxygen saturation is valuable for determining the presence or absence of a significant left to right shunt after repair of tetralogy of Fallot and should be considered an adjunct to patient management. Intensive care unit measurement of the right ventricular outflow tract gradient identifies patients with a significant right ventricular outflow tract gradient at catheterization but is not highly sensitive."
CD011912,0,23305575,0,Novel fenestration designs for controlled venous flow shunting in failing Fontans with systemic venous hypertension.,"The Fontan procedure is employed as the final-stage palliation in single-ventricle congenital heart patients and results in diversion of venous blood directly to the pulmonary arteries. Fontan patients have been known to suffer from postoperative systemic venous hypertension, which in turn is associated with pleural effusions and protein losing enteropathy, leading to a decreased duration and quality of life. Despite the ongoing debate on its benefits, a circular fenestration hole (typically 4 mm) establishing a venous shunt to the common atrium is traditionally employed to relieve venous pressure in the Fontan conduit and improve early postoperative Fontan hemodynamics. However, these improvements come at the cost of reduced oxygen saturation due to excessive right-to-left shunting if the fenestration is permanent. The ideal ""selective"" fenestration would therefore limit or eliminate shunt flow at tolerable systemic venous pressures and allow increased flow at high pressures. The objective of this study is to introduce new fenestration designs that exhibit these desirable pressure-flow characteristics. Novel plus-shaped and S-shaped fenestration designs with leaflets are introduced as alternatives to the traditional circular fenestration, each having identical effective orifice areas at the fully open states. In vitro steady leakage flow tests were performed for physiological flow-driving pressures in order to obtain pressure-drop versus flow-rate characteristics. In addition, the leaflet opening kinematics of the plus-shaped fenestration was investigated computationally using finite element simulation. Fluid-structure interaction analysis was performed to determine leaflet displacements and pressure-flow characteristics at low pressures. Further, a lumped parameter model of the single-ventricle circuit was created to simulate pulsatile flow conditions For the plus-shaped fenestration, the flow rate was found to increase nonlinearly with increased driving systemic venous pressures at high physiological-pressure drops which did not cause the leaflets to fully open, and linearly for low driving pressures. These results indicate that leaflets of the plus-shaped fenestration design activated passively after a critical systemic venous pressure threshold. This feature is ideal for minimizing undesirable excessive venous shunting. A large variability in shunting flow rate may be obtained by changing the shape, thickness, size, and material of the fenestration to suit requirements of the patient, which can further limit shunt flow in a controlled manner."

CD011912,0,24259011,0,Relationships between left heart chamber dilatation on echocardiography and left-to-right ventricle shunting quantified by cardiac catheterization in children with ventricular septal defects.,"Left atrium and/or left ventricle dilatation on echocardiography is considered to be an indication for closure of ventricular septal defects (VSD). No study has addressed the accuracy of using dilated left heart chambers when defining significant left-to-right shunting quantified by cardiac catheterization in isolated small or moderate VSDs. In this study, the relation between dilated left heart chambers, measured by echocardiography, and left-to-right ventricle shunting, quantified by cardiac catheterization, was evaluated in patients with isolated VSD. The medical records of all patients with isolated VSD who had undergone catheterization from 1996 to 2010 were examined retrospectively. Normative data for left heart chambers adjusted for body weight (BW) and body surface area (BSA) were used. The pulmonary-to-systemic flow ratio (Qp:Qs) was calculated by an oximetry technique. A total of 115 patients (mean age 7.3 ± 5 years) fulfilled the inclusion criteria. There was a statistically significant difference in terms of Qp:Qs between the patient groups with normal and dilated left heart chambers, when adjusted for BW and BSA (p = 0.001 and p = 0.002, respectively). But the relationships between Qp:Qs and left heart chamber sizes on echocardiography were not strong enough to be useful for making surgical decisions, as left heart chamber dilatation was not significantly associated with Qp:Qs ≥ 2 (p = 0.349 when adjusted for BW, p = 0.107 when adjusted for BSA). Left heart chamber dilatation was significantly associated with Qp:Qs ≥ 1.5 only when it was adjusted for BSA (for BW p = 0.022, for BSA p = 0.006). As a result, left heart chamber dilatation measured by echocardiography does not show significant left-to-right ventricle shunting, as quantified by catheterization. We still advocate that catheter angiography should be undertaken when left heart chambers are dilated in echocardiography in order to make decisions about closing small- to moderate-sized VSD."

Despite antenatal screening and at least one examination before discharge infants with critical CHD (CCHD) are routinely not detected before discharge from the newborn nursery. Newborn screening for CCHD using pulse oximetry is widely endorsed however until recent efforts, CCHD screening programs had only been implemented at the individual hospital level. The purpose of this paper is to describe the implementation of CCHD screening across the entire Emirate of Abu Dhabi. The Health Authority-Abu Dhabi (HAAD), in collaboration with Children's National Medical Center (Children's National), successfully implemented CCHD screening at the emirate level using a ""train-the-trainer,"" two-tiered approach, starting with two pilot hospitals then rolling the program out to all birthing facilities. In the first year, CCHD screening was added as a mandatory test to the HAAD Newborn Screening Standard, has been implemented in most birthing facilities, and occurs for the majority of infants (86 %) in Abu Dhabi. This led to the identification of ten newborns with CCHD. Based on the successful identification and mitigation of barriers to implementation, the approach may be adapted for similar programs in other populations."

CD011912,0,18923862,0,Reversed differential cyanosis in the newborn: a clinical finding in the supracardiac total anomalous pulmonary venous connection.,"The newborn can experience two types of differential cyanosis (DC). The common type of DC occurs when oxygen saturation in the right hand is greater than in the foot. The second type of DC, reversed differential cyanosis (RDC), occurs when oxygen saturation is lower in the right hand than in the foot. This phenomenon is observed in transposition of the great arteries (TGA) with patent ductus arteriosis (PDA) and elevated pulmonary vascular resistance or in TGA with PDA and preductal aortic interruption or coarctation. This report describes a case of RDC not previously described involving an infant with supracardiac total anomalous pulmonary venous connection (TAPVC). In supracardiac TAPVC, RDC results from streaming of highly saturated superior vena cava (SVC) blood into the right ventricle, out the main pulmonary artery, through a PDA, and to the descending aorta, with streaming of more desaturated blood from the inferior vena cava (IVC) into the left atrium across the atrial septal defect (ASD)/foramen ovale. Therefore, as part of a neonatal examination to rule out congenital heart disease (CHD), simultaneous pre- and postductal oxygen saturations should be documented. The presence of RDC should initiate immediate full cardiac evaluation for CHD. Supracardiac TAPVC should be included in the differential diagnosis if RDC is observed."

There were 16 infants up to one week old, 39 infants--up to one month, and 10 infants more than one month old. There were 43 boys and 22 girls among them. Cardiac catheterization and B.A.S. were carried out in most children up to 24 hours following hospitalization under local anaesthesia and premedication with robenzperidol and dolantin. In 11 of the 65 infants after B.A.S. the saturation with oxygen in the right atrium under-went no significant changes; in 54 cases it increased by 10 to 49 per cent. Of the 65 infants in whom B.A.S. was performed, 37 are alive, 28 had died. In 20 children under constant outpatient cardiological follow up the observation period has amounted from 6 months to 3 years. Their motoric development and growth is retarded, there is moderate cyanosis, but no symptoms of congestive failure were found. All these children are administered digitalis in chronic maintenance doses. Respiratory infections occured frequently in these patients. As mentioned above, 28 infants died at the age of 2 days to 6 months. Post mortem examination revealed that the B.A.S. was unsufficient in 14 cases. However, 14 infants died in spite of the satisfactority performed atrioseptostomy. Pulmonary oedema or haemorrhagic-and-inflammatory changes in the lungs as well as generalized thrombosis were the most frequent causes of death. On the basis of their own experience the authors elaborated indications and instructions for B.A.S. in neonates and infants with congenital heart diseases. These directives are based on the Team Work of cardiologists, anaesthesiologists, cardiac surgeons and paediatric radiologists. Because ever greater numbers of neonates are being sent to the Institute of Paediatric of the Academy of Medicine from all over Poland, the authors organized continuous cardiological emergency service to carry out B.A.S. procedures as soon as possible, without delay."

CD011912,0,17992303,0,A novel adjustable pulmonary artery banding system for hypoplastic left heart syndrome.,"Hypoplastic left heart syndrome remains a challenge for worldwide surgeons. Initial palliation employing bilateral pulmonary artery banding along with ductal stent implantation and atrial septostomy has been proposed as an alternative approach. However, the surgically placed bands are fixed and may become inadequate after sternum closure or with somatic growth of the patient. We describe the first case in which a neonate with hypoplastic left heart syndrome was initially managed using a mini banding system that allows for fine percutaneous adjustments of pulmonary blood flow."
CD011912,0,23064839,0,Predictors of ductus arteriosus in-stent stenosis in the hybrid approach to hypoplastic left heart syndrome.,"The hybrid approach to palliation of hypoplastic left heart syndrome using pulmonary artery bands, a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) stent, and atrial septostomy has been well described. One potential complication of hybrid stage 1 palliation is the development of neointimal formation and in-stent stenosis (ISS). This study aimed to identify predictors of ISS development. Patients who underwent hybrid stage 1 palliation between 2002 and 2010 were included in the study. The clinical information included oxygen saturation, weight, vital signs, and medications. Echocardiographic data included ventricular function, degree of tricuspid regurgitation, and velocity through the PDA stent and pulmonary artery bands. Hemodynamic data from interstage catheterizations were similarly noted. Patients who developed clinically significant ISS requiring either transcatheter intervention or early stage 2 repair were compared with those who did not. Of the 66 patients included in the study, 40 were boys (61 %). The median age at hybrid palliation was 7 days (range, 1-93 days), and the median initial weight was 3.2 kg (range, 1.4-5 kg). In 13 patients (20 %), ISS developed. The mean initial weight was significantly greater in the ISS group (3.5 ± 0.5 vs. 3.0 ± 0.6 kg) (p = 0.03). The mean oxygen saturations did not differ significantly between the no-ISS group (82.2 % ± 5.7 %) and the ISS group (81.4 % ± 2.0 %) (p = 0.31). The mean PDA velocities were higher in the ISS group (2.7 ± 0.4 m/s) and increased at a faster rate than in the no-ISS group at (2.4 ± 0.4 m/s) (p = 0.01). The degree of tricuspid regurgitation, ventricular function, and pulmonary artery band gradients shown by echocardiography were similar in the two groups. The development of ISS after hybrid stage 1 palliation can lead to interstage interventions or earlier comprehensive stage 2 repair. Patients with greater initial weight and a lower stent-to-weight ratio are more likely to develop ISS. The cause of ISS is complex, and additional investigation of its etiology currently is ongoing."
CD011912,0,26760414,0,Newborn Respiratory Distress.,"Newborn respiratory distress presents a diagnostic and management challenge. Newborns with respiratory distress commonly exhibit tachypnea with a respiratory rate of more than 60 respirations per minute. They may present with grunting, retractions, nasal flaring, and cyanosis. Common causes include transient tachypnea of the newborn, respiratory distress syndrome, meconium aspiration syndrome, pneumonia, sepsis, pneumothorax, persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn, and delayed transition. Congenital heart defects, airway malformations, and inborn errors of metabolism are less common etiologies. Clinicians should be familiar with updated neonatal resuscitation guidelines. Initial evaluation includes a detailed history and physical examination. The clinician should monitor vital signs and measure oxygen saturation with pulse oximetry, and blood gas measurement may be considered. Chest radiography is helpful in the diagnosis. Blood cultures, serial complete blood counts, and C-reactive protein measurement are useful for the evaluation of sepsis. Most neonates with respiratory distress can be treated with respiratory support and noninvasive methods. Oxygen can be provided via bag/mask, nasal cannula, oxygen hood, and nasal continuous positive airway pressure. Ventilator support may be used in more severe cases. Surfactant is increasingly used for respiratory distress syndrome. Using the INSURE technique, the newborn is intubated, given surfactant, and quickly extubated to nasal continuous positive airway pressure. Newborns should be screened for critical congenital heart defects via pulse oximetry after 24 hours but before hospital discharge. Neonatology consultation is recommended if the illness exceeds the clinician's expertise and comfort level or when the diagnosis is unclear in a critically ill newborn."
CD011912,0,17449857,0,Should pulse oximetry be used to screen for congenital heart disease?,"Ten studies (44 969 newborns, 71 severe defects) evaluating the usefulness of neonatal pulse oximetry (PO) screening in timely detection of congenital heart disease (CHD) were reviewed. PO showed a high specificity (99.9-99.99%), and the overall rate of detection of 15 individual defects with PO was 72% (range 46-100%), exceeding that of the clinical examination 58% (9-86%). Similar results were obtained for cyanotic CHD (89% v 69%, respectively). Without PO, discharge of apparently healthy infants with unknown CHD was 5.5 times and 4.1 times more likely in cyanotic CHD and all serious CHD, respectively. The paper describes the technical and practical details of first day and later screening. Diagnosis is reached earliest with first day screening, but it requires more resources. PO screening is not sensitive enough to serve as an independent screen, but along with the clinical examination it helps minimise the morbidity and mortality associated with discharge without diagnosis. Further research is needed for precise delineation of populations that would benefit from PO screening."

Hemodynamics and plasma catecholamines].,"Sufentanil-nitrous oxide/oxygen anesthesia was compared to halothane-nitrous oxide/oxygen anesthesia in 44 infants and children undergoing cardiac surgery. Patients were randomly assigned to one of the two techniques studied, with 22 patients in each group. The mean weight was 8.3 (4.4-15.8) kg in the sufentanil (S) group and 11.7 (5.2-18) kg in the halothane (H) group. All patients were premedicated with IM atropine 0.01 mg/kg, morphine 0.2 mg/kg, and flunitrazepam 0.04 mg/kg. In the S group 1 micrograms/kg S was given intravenously for induction, followed by a cumulative dose of 4 micrograms/kg S until the beginning of surgery. In the H group anesthesia was induced with H 0.5-1.0 vol.% and for deepening of anesthesia increasing H concentrations of 0.5-1.0-1.5 vol.% were applied. Following intubation all patients were ventilated with nitrous oxide/oxygen (1:1). There were no significant differences between the two groups in systolic, diastolic and mean arterial blood pressures or in heart-rate response to induction and intubation. Peripheral arterial oxygen saturation increased significantly in cyanotic patients in both groups following induction. There were dose-dependent decreases in heart rate and small but significant decreases in mean and diastolic arterial pressure in the S group during deepening of anesthesia. There was a significantly greater decrease in systolic, diastolic and mean blood pressures during the same period in the H group whereas the reduction in heart rate was minimal. In addition, in 5 of 22 patients receiving H there were episodes of nodal rhythms with dramatic decreases in systemic arterial pressure and peripheral arterial oxygen saturation in cyanotic patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD011912,0,3774577,0,Total anomalous origin of the coronary arteries from the pulmonary artery.,"The clinicopathologic features of four patients with total anomalous origin of the coronary arteries from the pulmonary artery (TCAPA) are presented and compared with 21 previously reported cases. Patients with TCAPA usually present with left ventricular heart failure, angina, or associated cardiovascular anomalies. Of the 19 patients in whom a clinical history was available, 16 were symptomatic before three days of age. All patients died with 60% dying before two weeks of age. Longer survival was associated with additional cardiovascular anomalies that increased pulmonary arterial perfusion pressure, oxygen saturation, or both. Seventeen (68%) patients had additional cardiovascular anomalies, most commonly atrial (nine cases) or ventricular (eight cases) septal defects and tetralogy of Fallot or other variants of pulmonary atresia (four cases). Only five (22%) of 23 had noncardiovascular anomalies. The coronary arteries arose equally from either one ostium or from two, and the number of ostia was not related to either anomalous coronary artery distribution or to the presence of additional cardiovascular anomalies. Cardiomegaly was present in 56% of cases and the majority of patients had myocardial fibrosis or infarction. Embryology is reviewed and evidence is presented to support the theory of involution-persistence of coronary artery anlagen as the pathogenetic mechanism of TCAPA."

CD011912,0,8222032,0,Oral midazolam premedication for children with congenital cyanotic heart disease undergoing cardiac surgery: a comparative study.,"To determine whether oral midazolam is a safe and effective alternative to our current standard premedication for children with cyanotic congenital heart disease (CCHD), 30 children aged 1-6 yr, scheduled for elective cardiac surgery, were studied. The children were randomly assigned to one of two groups: Group I received oral midazolam 0.75 mg.kg-1 30 min before separation from their parents in the surgical waiting area, and Group II received oral or rectal pentobarbitone 2 mg.kg-1 at 90 min, and morphine 0.2 mg.kg-1 and atropine 0.02 mg.kg-1 im at 60 min before separation. Heart rate, haemoglobin oxygen saturation (SpO2) and anxiolysis and sedation scores were recorded at four times during the study: at baseline (immediately before premedication), immediately after administration of the premedication, at separation of children from parents in the waiting area and at the time of application of the face mask in the operating room. We found that in Group I, anxiolysis improved at separation from parents compared with baseline (P < 0.05) and sedation increased both at separation and on mask application (P < 0.05), whereas in Group II anxiolysis did not change at any time and sedation increased only at separation (P < 0.05). Intramuscular injection of morphine produced a transient decrease in mean SpO2 (from 84% to 76%) (P < 0.05) that did not occur after ingestion of oral midazolam. The results of this study indicate that oral midazolam is a safe and effective replacement for the standard premedication for children with CCHD undergoing cardiac surgery and avoids the decrease in SpO2 associated with im injections."

CD011912,0,64317,0,Palliation of cyanotic congenital heart disease in infancy with E-type prostaglandins.,"Prostaglandin-E (PGE) infusions have been used in an attempt to increase ductal patency in 11 infants aged one to 99 days with cyanotic heart disease. PGE1 was used in nine infants and PGE2 in two. Five patients had pulmonary atresia, four extreme pulmonary stenosis, one Ebstein's anomaly and one simple transposition of the great arteries. All but the oldest infant showed a satisfactory increase in oxygen saturation (average 36%) attributed to dilatation of the ductus. The failure in one infant may have been due largely to hypoplasia of the left pulmonary artery. The only important side effect was apnea in one infant receiving PGE2. The efficacy of this form of treatment is confirmed in infants dependent on ductal patency for survival. PGE is an important asset in saving the lives of neonates requiring an aorticopulmonary shunt operation. The recommended starting dose is 0.1 mug/kg/min of PGE1 given by constant infusion."

CD011912,0,8765629,0,Safety and efficacy of chloral hydrate sedation in children undergoing echocardiography.,"The purpose of this prospective study was to determine the safety and efficacy of chloral hydrate sedation in children with known or suspected congenital heart disease. The study population included 405 children with a median age of 13 months (3 weeks to 14 years). Cyanotic heart disease was present in 64 of the children. The median dosage of chloral hydrate given was 77 mg/kg, with a range of 25 to 125 mg/kg. Sedation was achieved in 397 (98%) of the children. The complete study time averaged 2.2 hours (range, 1.6 to 5.2 hours). The time to achieve sedation was 30 minutes or less in 82%, more than 30 but less than 60 minutes in 12%, and more than 60 minutes in 4%; 2% failed to achieve sedation. Children aged 3 years or younger were more likely to be successfully sedated with chloral hydrate (p = 0.003). The type of heart disease did not affect the success of sedation. No child had a clinically significant change in heart rate or blood pressure during sedation; however, oxygen saturation decreased in 24 (6%) of 397 children successfully sedated. Decreases in oxygen saturation occurred more commonly in children with trisomy 21 (7/13) than in children without genetic syndromes (17/384). Vomiting occurred in 23 (6%) of the 405 study subjects, usually immediately after drug administration.

The mean preoperative systolic pulmonary artery pressure was 70.5 (range 31-136) mm Hg and the calculated pulmonary vascular resistance ranged from 300 to 1680 dyn/s cm-5. A paracoronary right ventriculotomy was the approach of choice. Profound hypothermia and circulatory arrest were not used, even in 12 patients weighing under 10 kg. Among the older children and young adolescents there were 27 who had a calculated pulmonary vascular resistance of over 800 dyn/s cm-1 and their mortality was 22%, which is good when compared with that of other series. It is evident that both the early and the late death rate after surgery increase with the age of the patient, especially in those with associated pulmonary hypertension. In 69 patients studied after repair recatheterisation showed no residual defect by oximetry. The fall in the pulmonary artery pressures after surgery has been striking in most patients.

Patients were divided into two groups: group A (excellent or good outcome) and group B (poor outcome or death) based on the clinical course assessed up to 9.5 years postoperatively. Thirteen of 22 group A patients did not have prolonged, clinically significant, systemic venous hypertension and were not on long-term diuretic drug therapy. Nine of 22 group B patients either had clinically significant systemic venous hypertension, required long-term diuretic drug therapy or died (3 patients). Age at surgery, pulmonary arteriolar resistance, left ventricular ejection fraction, end-diastolic volume, end-diastolic pressure, systemic oxygen saturation and pulmonary to systemic blood flow ratio (Qp/Qs) were not statistically different between the two groups.

Fentanyl was used for anesthesia, except in cases without i.v. route in which sevoflurane with nitrous oxide in oxygen was used for induction of anesthesia. FIO2 was adjusted using air and oxygen. The lower FIO2 was applied to the patients for a closure of ventricular septal defect, a reconstruction of coarctation or interrupted aortic arch, and pulmonary artery banding, while the higher FIO2 was used for systemic-to-pulmonary artery shunts and the repair of tetralogy of Fallot. In the congenital heart disease with the intracardiac shunt, the magnitude of the shunt flow and hemodynamics can be altered by changing systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance which could be induced by various ways. Since alveolar oxygen tension is a known determinant of pulmonary vascular resistance, an appropriate FIO2 should be applied to each patient with different pathophysiology. A low FIO2 should be set for the cases with nonrestrictive left-to-right shunting, since a high FIO2 may cause a torrential pulmonary blood flow. A high FIO2 is preferable for the cases with right-to-left shunting and a concomitant decreased pulmonary blood flow."

On two-dimensional echocardiography, the right pulmonary artery (PA) appeared larger than left PA and the left atrium, left ventricle were dilated. The right heart chambers were in normal limits. A color flow Doppler echocardiogram revealed a turbulent flow due to a PAVM originating from medium branch of right PA, and continuous wave Doppler showed continuous flow pattern. Agitated saline injection resulted in the delayed appearance of the contrast in the left-side chambers three to four heart cycles after appearance in the right-side chambers; the study was considered positive and indicative of an intrapulmonary shunt. Selective angiography of the right PA confirmed the diagnosis of a large solitary PAVM in the right middle lobe with a feeding artery.

The ET-Pa(CO2) difference was < or = 2 mm Hg in 9 of 53 patients and < or = 5 mm Hg in 30 of 53 patients (P < .001). No variation in the TC-Pa(CO2) difference was noted based on the type of CHD (acyanotic vs cyanotic) or age. The ET-Pa(CO2) difference was greater in patients with cyanotic versus acyanotic CHD (7 +/- 3 mm Hg vs 4 +/- 2 mm Hg, P < .0001) and in patients < or = 1 year of age versus patients > or = 1 year of age (6 +/- 3 mm Hg vs 4 +/- 2, P = .008). In infants and children with CHD, TC monitoring provides a more accurate estimation of Pa(CO2) than ET monitoring."

Comparison of 3 techniques].,"A study was carried out to compare the haemodynamic and respiratory effects, as well as the quality of recovery, of anaesthesia with ketamine, sodium gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GOH) and etomidate in children undergoing cardiac catheterization. Thirty children, mean age 48 +/- 35 months, ranked ASA 2 or 3 on account of congenital heart disease, were assigned to one of three groups (n = 10). They were given: in group E1, a 0.3 mg.kg-1 bolus of etomidate, followed by 0.1 mg.kg-1.min-1 for 10 minutes, and 0.026 mg.kg-1.min-1 thereafter; in group G2, a 50 mg.kg-1 bolus of GOH, and in group K3, a 4 mg.kg-1 bolus of ketamine followed by a continuous infusion of 0.083 mg.kg-1.min-1. The patients breathed spontaneously. Monitoring included heart rate, systolic, diastolic and mean blood pressure, pulse oximetry, and capnography. Femoral venous or arterial catheterization was performed after local anaesthesia (with no more than 2 mg.kg-1 of lidocaine). Measurements were performed before induction, and then 1, 10, 30 and 60 minutes afterwards. The quality of anaesthesia was assessed according to Steward's scale. The investigation lasted between 50 and 100 min in all three groups. There were no significant differences in haemodynamic and respiratory parameters during the investigation between the groups. Recovery was shorter and of better quality in group E1. On the opposite, 30 minutes after the end of the catheterization, all the patients in group K3 were stuporous, with 5 of them displaying involuntary movements. The patients of the other two groups reacted correctly to stimuli, but those in group G2 went back to sleep very rapidly. There were no complications.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

The absence of physical signs and the difficulty assessing mild cyanosis means that the newborn baby check misses up to a third of babies. Fetal anomaly ultrasound scanning identifies an increasing proportion, but this screen is operator-dependent and therefore highly variable; although some units report very high detection rates, overall most babies with CCHD are still missed. Pulse oximetry screening (POS) is an additional test that meets the criteria for universal screening. POS increases overall detection of CCHD to over 90% and also identifies babies with noncardiac, hypoxemic conditions (such as congenital pneumonia, early-onset sepsis, and pulmonary hypertension), which are usually included in the false positives. There is a wealth of published data on the POS, both in a research setting and more recently in routine clinical practice, and consideration of POS is becoming increasingly widespread particularly among high-income countries. But a degree of controversy still remains, and debate continues regarding the most appropriate time to screen, the most effective screening pathway, and screening outside the well-baby nursery. So, should all newborn babies be screened with POS, if so, when and where should screening take place, what saturations are acceptable, and which conditions are we trying to identify? This review will look at the available evidence and try to suggest the way forward for those considering its introduction into their clinical practice."

Screening for the most critical forms (CCHD) using pulse oximetry was added to the Recommended Uniform Screening Panel in the United States in 2011. Since then, CCHD screening has become nearly universal in the United States. Nurses are ideally situated to contribute to the development of best practices for implementation and provide education to families on CCHD screening. Much of the standardization, advocacy, and development of national recommendations occurred with key input from nurses. Nurses often have responsibility for educating parents, performing the screening, interpreting the screening algorithm, and the documentation of results. The nurse role often includes implementing follow-up quality improvement initiatives to ensure that systematic and accurate screening occurs. Smooth implementation can be achieved by identifying champions early, obtaining input from a multidisciplinary team including both physician and nursing leaders, and identifying ways to integrate screening into already existing workflow. By knowing the basics of why screening is important, how to screen, current recommendations on the follow-up for positive screens and the limitations of CCHD screening, nurses can advocate for their patients and positively impact outcomes for infants born with CCHD through early identification before discharge."

CD011912,0,7978174,0,[The effect of different types of anesthetic respirators on oxygenation and ventilation in infants during short-term anesthesia. A study using transcutaneous PO2 and PCO2 monitoring].,"Monitoring of ventilation in infants is difficult and often not very reliable. In this study, transcutaneous measurement of blood gas tensions was used to investigate the influence of four different modes of ventilation on oxygenation and ventilation in anaesthetized infants. METHODS. In a randomised study, transcutaneously measured PO2 (tc-PO2) and PCO2 (tcPCO2) tensions were continuously registered in 42 ASA class I and II infants between 3 and 24 weeks of age undergoing minor surgical procedures (inguinal hernia repair). Two breathing systems combined with different modes of ventilation were evaluated: manual ventilation with Kuhn's T-piece system and face mask (group A; n = 11) or endotracheal tube (group B; n = 10); manual ventilation with paediatric circuit system and face mask (group C; n = 11); and mechanical ventilation with paediatric circle system, endotracheal tube, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) 3 cm H2O (group D; n = 10). Transcutaneous values were measured by a combined tcPO2/PCO2 electrode (E 5277, Radiometer). Anaesthesia was maintained by controlled ventilation with N2O/O2 (67%/33%) and halothane 0.5-1.5 vol.%. Surgical and anaesthetic techniques were standardized and the anaesthetist was blinded to the measured values. RESULTS. Preoperative mean tcPO2 values while spontaneously breathing air ranged between 69 and 75 mmHg in all patients. During anaesthesia and controlled ventilation (FiO2 = 0.33), there was a significant increase in tcPO2 (P < 0.01) in 3 groups: in groups A and D mean tcPO2 increased to 90-100 mmHg and in group C to 110-120 mmHg. In contrast, tcPO2 in group B reached only 75-80 mmHg, which was not considered significant. Postoperatively, tcPO2 immediately reached baseline values in all patients (Fig. 2). Compared to preoperative values, the alveolar-tcPO2 difference (AtcDO2) significantly increased during anaesthesia in all groups (Fig. 3). The tcPCO2 measurements revealed marked alveolar dysventilation, with hyperventilation supervening in groups A, B, and D; in group C, however, most (7 of 11) infants were normoventilated (Fig. 4). CONCLUSIONS. Adverse effects of anaesthesia on pulmonary function in infants are caused by loss of the PEEP effect induced by the physiological subglottic stenosis. Endotracheal intubation and the increase in chest wall compliance during anaesthesia lead to a decrease in functional residual capacity (FRC) associated with premature airway closure and ventilation/perfusion mismatch. These pathophysiological disturbances result in a marked increase in AaDO2 and low arterial PO2 values despite high FiO2, as could be observed when intubated infants had been ventilated with a high-flow T-piece system (group B). Mechanical ventilation with a paediatric circuit system and endotracheal tube allows the use of low PEEP levels (group D), which may replace the lost subglottic function and partially restore the FRC. Ventilation by mask does not disturb the functional subglottic stenosis, and the impairment of pulmonary function will depend solely on the decrease in FRC caused by increased chest wall compliance (group A). If mask ventilation is combined with a paediatric circuit system (group C), the pressure relief valve produces a low PEEP of 2 to 3 cm H2O, which may partially counteract the decrease in FRC. With regard to oxygenation, the paediatric circle system proved to be superior to the high-flow T-piece system independent of whether children were ventilated via a face mask or an endotracheal tube. The group-specific differences in degree of dysventilation with manual ventilation show that the type of breathing system is important with regard to the size of the tidal volume delivered. Thus, tidal volumes will be unintentionally increased by the high fresh gas flow needed when a T-piece system is used. The lower flow and preadjusted pressure limit may prevent the delivery of excessive tidal volumes with the paediatric circuit system..."
CD011912,0,10323533,0,Balloon dilation of the right ventricular outflow tract in tetralogy of Fallot: a palliative procedure.,"Fifteen patients requiring palliation for tetralogy of Fallot were treated by balloon dilation because of hypercyanotic spells. The mean age at dilation was 1.9 +/- 0.7 years (range 0.5-3), and the mean weight 9.8 +/- 2.1 kg (range 6.0-13.5). Dilation of the outflow tract was combined with dilation of the left and/or right pulmonary arteries in 5 patients. Successful dilation was achieved in 12 patients (80%), but failed in 3 patients with hypoplastic pulmonary arteries. In one patient, the stenosis of the right pulmonary artery could not be dilated because of a very sharp angle at the site of the stenosis. Two of the 3 patients in whom the procedure failed died of severe cyanotic spells within 24 hours of the unsuccessful procedure. No major complications occurred during or after the procedure in the cases undergoing successful dilation. The arterial oxygen saturation increased significantly, from 71 +/- 5.7% to 89 +/- 3.9%, immediately after the procedure (p < 0.005). During a period of follow up of 6 +/- 3.7 months (range 1-13), the procedure was repeated on 3 occasions, and successfully accomplished in 2 of these. In conclusion, balloon dilation is a satisfactory palliative procedure for tetralogy of Fallot in those units in which total correction is not performed under 2 to 3 years of age."
CD011912,0,10323535,0,Palliative balloon valvoplasty of the pulmonary valve in tetralogy of Fallot.,"Balloon dilation of the pulmonary valve was performed in 54 patients with tetralogy of Fallot with severe cyanosis, high haematocrit and severe valvar pulmonary stenosis. Clinical, echocardiographic, angiographic, and haemodynamic data were analyzed before and after the procedure. After balloon dilation, the systemic oxygen saturation increased from a mean value of 66% to 85%. The mean value of the haematocrit before dilation was 55 + 13, and decreased to 47 after dilation (p < 0.002) in 2 months follow-up. Balloon dilation increased the size of the pulmonary valvar orifice from a mean value of 9 + 5 mm to 11.5 + 2 mm (p < 0.005). The mean Z score of the pulmonary valves, which was -3 + 1.3 before dilation, increased to -1.1 + 1.1 immediately after the procedure (p < 0.05). The size of the right and left pulmonary arteries increased after dilation from 9 mm to 10 mm, and from 8.7 + 2.4 mm to 9.8 + 2.3 mm, respectively (p < 0.05). The comparable mean Z scores increased from -2.8 + 1.9 SD to -1.8 + 1.4 SD, and from -2.4 + 1.9 SD to -1.5 + 1.6 SD for the right and left branches, respectively (p < 0.05). In patients with stenosis at the bifurcation of the pulmonary trunk and hypoplasia of the left artery, successful dilation of the pulmonary valve lead to an increase of flow and improvement in size of the hypoplastic segment. In conclusion, initial balloon dilation of the pulmonary valve in tetralogy of Fallot resulted in increase of the Z score for the pulmonary valve and improved antegrade pulmonary blood flow, inducing growth of the pulmonary arteries and ameliorating the anatomic and physiologic preoperative condition."
CD011912,0,10323534,0,Balloon valvoplasty in infants with tetralogy of Fallot: effects on oxygen saturation and growth of the pulmonary arteries.,"Balloon valvoplasty was undertaken in 27 patients with tetralogy of Fallot for first-stage palliation. Indications were arterial saturation of oxygen < 80%, hypoxic spells and duct-dependant pulmonary perfusion. The dilation was performed following diagnostic heart catheterization. Saturations improved from 75% +/- 8.5 before valvoplasty to 85% +/- 8.4 after the procedure, and worsened little to 83% +/- 9.6 at follow-up after 3.4 months. The pulmonary valvar orifice was hypoplastic in most patients (Z = -3.3 +/- 1.2), and did not change after the procedure. The cross-sectional area of the pulmonary arteries was diminished initially, reflected by a Nakata index of 186 +/- 95 mm2/m2. After valvoplasty, we found widening of the vessels (Nakata index 225 +/- 100 mm2/m2). At follow-up no further growth of the arteries was observed (Nakata index 209 +/- 109 mm2/m2). The procedure was complicated by hypoxic spells in three patients which were controlled by intravenous propranolol, and deep venous thrombosis in four patients. Our data demonstrate that balloon valvoplasty is feasible for initial palliation in patients with tetralogy of Fallot. It does not, however, produce growth of the pulmonary arteries or of the pulmonary valve."

CD011912,0,7357986,0,Reversible central apnea in an infant with cyanotic heart disease.,"The purpose of this report is to present the findings in a neonate with tetralogy of Fallot and a history of prolonged sleep-related apnea requiring resuscitation. At a baseline arterial oxygen pressure of 46 mm Hg, his preoperative responses to carbon dioxide during non-REM sleep (26.1 and 26.6 ml/kg/min/mm Hg of alveolar carbon dioxide tension [PACO2]) were identical to those reported in near-miss sudden infant death syndrome. Following a systemic-pulmonary arterial shunt, the arterial saturation reached 95 percent, and no further apnea occurred. The prompt normalization of the response to carbon dioxide following surgery (75.2 and 75.4 ml/kg/min/mm Hg of PACO2) indicates that, unlike infants with the sudden infant death syndrome, a low sensitivity to carbon dioxide in infants with cyanotic heart disease may be dependent on hypoxemia and, thus, reversible."

CD011912,0,19282752,0,Near-infrared spectroscopy as a guide for an intermittent cerebral perfusion strategy during neonatal circulatory arrest.,"In view of the existing controversy concerning the best perfusion technique during deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA) for neonatal heart operations, we examined intraoperative rSO2 to help define an optimal interval for an intermittent antegrade cerebral perfusion (IACP) strategy. Records of patients undergoing stage 1 palliation (S1P) and repair of total anomalous pulmonary venous return (rTAPVR) from 1996 to 2004 were reviewed. A total of 16 patients were identified (11 S1P, 5 rTAPVR) with complete data and long periods of DHCA. A decline in rSO2 of either 20% or below a value of 50 was considered significant. The rSO2 for all patients was evaluated after 5, 10, 15, and 20 minutes of DHCA for significant cerebral desaturation. The average rSO2 at the start of DHCA ranged from 45 to 89 for S1P and 35-86 for rTAPVR. Significant cerebral desaturation was observed in 25%-31% of patients after 5 minutes; 42%-44% of patients after 10 minutes; 58%-69% after 15 minutes; and 75%-83% after 20 minutes. Each neonate has a unique baseline cerebral saturation. Also, the response to DHCA varies among subjects as the rate of decrease of rSO2 was not uniform. Universally applying the same interval after which to perfuse the brain permits significant cerebral desaturation in a large percentage of patients. Cerebral oximetry may provide a guide for developing an individualized cerebral perfusion strategy."
CD011912,0,19282750,0,Single center experience with a low volume priming cardiopulmonary bypass circuit for preventing blood transfusion in infants and small children.,"This retrospective study analyzed the current practice of blood transfusion-free open-heart surgery in 536 children weighing 5-20 kg undergoing surgery between 2004 and 2007. A miniaturized cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) circuit was used (priming volume; 300 ml for the flow rate <1,500 ml/min; 550 ml for the flow rate of 1500-2300 ml/min). Modified ultrafiltration was routinely performed. Criteria for blood transfusion during CPB included a hematocrit of <20% and/or mixed venous oxygen saturation of <65%. Transfusion during CPB was avoided in 264 (49.3%) of the 536 patients (5-10 kg group, 29.0%; 11-15 kg group, 67.4%; 16-20 kg group, 80.8%). There was no neurological complication related to hemodilution. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that body weight, preoperative hematocrit, priming volume of CPB circuit, CPB time, and lowest hematocrit during CPB predict requirement of blood transfusion (p < 0.01). Transfusion rate was lowest in the atrial septal defect group (5.6%) and highest in tetralogy of Fallot group (78.7%), being associated with complexity of diagnosis and procedure required. Blood transfusion-free open-heart surgery may be achieved in the half of the patients weighing 5-20 kg, and further miniaturization of CPB circuit and refinement of perfusion strategy might reduce transfusion rate in patients <10 kg and/or with complex congenital heart disease."

CD011912,0,6645588,0,Duration of circulatory arrest does influence the psychological development of children after cardiac operation in early life.,"Published works on intelligence quotient (IQ) and development following the use of profound hypothermia and circulatory arrest (TCA) to repair congenital heart defects in infants and young children suggest that little or no psychomotor impairment results. IQ scores derived from cognitive, memory, perceptual, quantitative, and verbal tests (McCarthy scale of the children's abilities, mean score 100, SD 16) were measured in 31 patients 5 years following operations performed with TCA between 1972 and 1976. These patients were compared with three control groups: (1) 19 patients with similar defects but operated upon using moderate hypothermia and continuous cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB); (2) 16 children who were the siblings of the TCA patients; and (3) 14 children who were the siblings of the CPB patients. The hypothermic temperatures reached were closely clustered around 15 degrees C in the TCA group and 28 degrees C in the CPB group. TCA time ranged from 22 to 71 minutes. Statistical analysis, which included, t test, chi square test of association, and Wilcoxon test, showed that the only baseline characteristic which differed between the two patient groups in respect to age at operation, age at testing, and preoperative physiological variables (level of cyanosis, weight, oxygen saturation, and hemoglobin concentration) was weight (p = 0.03). The mean score of the TCA group (91 +/- 4.0, SE) was significantly lower (p = 0.002) than that of their siblings (106 +/- 4.1, SE). The score for the CPB patients (102 +/- 5.2, SE) was not demonstrably different from that of their siblings (96 +/- 5.9, SE). The sibling and patient (TCA) IQ differences were associated with duration of arrest in verbal (p = 0.06), quantitative (p = 0.07), and general cognitive (p = 0.003) scores. A decrease of 0.53 point per minute of arrest time was estimated for the entire group of 31 patients; that is, in the 19 patients with siblings, for each minute increase in circulatory arrest time, the patients dropped 0.69 IQ point below their siblings. These results and analysis of other published data do not support the generally accepted view that TCA can be used entirely without penalty. We question the accepted ""safe"" limit of circulatory arrest of 60 minutes."

We report on a neonate with membranous pulmonary atresia and intact ventricular septum, in whom a large interatrial right-to-left shunt via the foramen ovale persisted after radiofrequency-assisted pulmonary balloon valvuloplasty on the 2nd day of life. The interatrial shunt prevented adequate right ventricular filling and antegrade pulmonary perfusion leading to severe cyanosis (transcutaneous oxygen saturation 40%). In order to increase pulmonary blood flow and raise left atrial pressure, the arterial duct was stented. After ductal stenting, prostaglandin was discontinued and the transcutaneous oxygen saturation remained stable around 89%. At follow up after 7 weeks the foramen ovale had decreased in size and only a small left-to-right shunt was present, documenting the effectiveness of this approach."

An angiocardiographic and hemodynamic study of 42 patients.,"To correlate anatomy with hemodynamics, the angiocardiographic findings were reviewed in 42 patients with common ventricle (CV). Nine had normally related great arteries (NRGA), 12 d-malposition, 21 l-malposition and 5 a common atrioventricular valve. Selective outlet chamber (OLC) angiocardiograms were available in 14 out of 29 patients with OLCs. OLC position varied from anterior and to the right of the CV to posterior and to the left of it; two categories (anterior and lateral OLC) were delineated by a line 45 degrees to theleft of anterior in the horizontal plane. The OLC was anterior in all patients with NRGA, lateral in most l-malpositions, and almost equally divided between anterior and lateral in d-malposition (P less than 0.05). Complete hemodynamic data were obtained in 29 patients. Complete mixing of venous return occurred in four patients with atresia of one valve. In the remainder complete mixing occurred in 36%, unfavorable streaming in 12% and favorable streaming in 52%. Semilunar valve position and pulmonary stenosis did not affect the nature of mixing. Systemic arterial (SA) minus pulmonary arterial O2 saturation was positive and significantly higher in patients with malposition with lateral OLCs than anterior OLCs (P less than 0.001). However 79% of SA O2 saturation variation could be predicted from pulmonary and systemic blood flow alone."

In 11 cases BAS was repeated after inadequate first BAS, but again without success. In 19 patients an atrial septectomy (Blalock-Hanlon) was performed later on, with 20% mortality. 3 children died during or immediately after BAS. The early mortality after BAS was 13% and the late mortality 17%. These values include the mortality of palliative operations which were necessary to bridge over the time until ""corrective"" operations could be performed. The operative mortality of Mustard operations was 10% for the simple TGA and 16% for all TGA cases operated on.

CD011912,0,4068741,0,Combined prostaglandin therapy and ductal formalin infiltration in neonatal pulmonary oligemia.,"Prostaglandins and ductal formalin infiltration, singly and together, have been used in efforts to improve pulmonary flow in very ill newborn infants with right ventricular outflow tract obstruction. To evaluate the efficacy of concurrent use of prostaglandins and ductal formalin infiltration, we have reviewed our experience with 25 infants with right ventricular outflow tract obstruction and prostaglandin-ductal formalin infiltration therapy. Prostaglandin therapy was begun 22 +/- 21 hours (range 20 to 93 hours) before and was continued 20 +/- 18 hours (range 0 to 62 hours) following ductal formalin infiltration; prostaglandin administration was initiated at a dose of 0.05 to 0.1 microgram/kg/min and tapered postoperatively. Clinical cyanosis was diminished in 20 of 25 infants (80%) postoperatively. Systemic arterial pH and oxygen saturation both improved following prostaglandin-ductal formalin infiltration therapy from 7.35 to 7.41 (p less than 0.001) and from 35.7 to 50.3 (p less than 0.001), respectively. Persistent ductal patency (mean 219 +/- 191 days) was observed in 17 survivors of the early postoperative period (more than 14 days). Two of five infants who died within 14 days of operation had a widely patent ductus with resultant progressive congestive heart failure. The other three infants died as a result of operative technical problems, dysrhythmias, and thrombotic ductal closure, respectively. No correlation was observed between duration of ductus patency and operatively determined size of ductus, total prostaglandin dose, or duration of prostaglandin infusion. Secondary operative intervention was delayed by 92 +/- 74 days with prostaglandin-ductal formalin infiltration therapy; thus prostaglandin-ductal formalin infiltration therapy may have a role in selected neonates with right ventricular outflow tract obstruction."

Between September 2009 and December 2011, 33 newborns and infants were subjected to patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) stenting as an alternative to a surgical shunt. Of the 33 patients, 20 had pulmonary atresia (PA) with a ventricular septal defect, 4 had PA with an intact ventricular septum, 5 had PA with a double-outlet right ventricle, and 4 had critical pulmonary stenosis. The McGoon ratio ranged from 0.8 to 1.9 (median 1.27). The ages of the patients ranged from 3 to 56 days, and their weight ranged from 2.7 to 4.1 kg. The oxygen saturation ranged from 45 to 61 %, and the pH ranged from 7.13 to 7.27. Premounted coronary stents with diameters of 3, 3.5, and 4 mm were used to cover the whole length of the ductus. The PDA was tortuous in 23 patients and straight in 10 patients. The mean ductal length was 12.2 ± 3.7 mm (range 7.8-23 mm). The mean stent length was 14.3 ± 3.4 mm (range, 8-23 mm), and the mean narrowest ductal diameter was 1.9 ± 0.6 mm (range, 0.8-2.9 mm). Immediately after the procedure, the oxygen saturation was increased from a mean of 75.1 ± 13.2-91.5 ± 6.3 % (p < 0.0001), and the PDA diameter was increased from a mean of 1.9 ± 0.6-4.3 ± 0.8 mm (p < 0.0001). Stent redilation was necessary in two patients 8 days after the procedure, and their oxygen saturation increased 79-88 %. The mean fluoroscopy time was 39.4 ± 15.5 min. Stent dislocation to the left main pulmonary artery was seen in one patient, with another stent placed in the arterial duct. No procedure-related mortality occurred. Two neonates died a few days after the procedure due to sepsis related to the procedure. The surviving patients were discharged home 8-30 days (median, 9.5 days) after the procedure. Stent patency was achieved for 8-550 days. The McGoon ratio increased and ranged from 1.6 to 2.8 (median, 1.87) before the surgical intervention. Glenn anastomosis was possible for 18 patients at the age of 6-8 months. Nine patients experienced worsening of cyanosis about 4 months after stent placemen. Six of these patients required a Blalock-Taussig shunt, whereas stent dilation was possible for the remaining three patients. Four patients died of severe dehydration while awaiting a Glenn shunt. The findings show that PDA stenting can be a good alternative to surgery for initial palliation, especially in infants who will need multiple surgeries. It is safe and feasible but its efficacy gradually lessens after 6 months due to intrastent endothelial hyperplasia."

Pulse oximetry screening was performed according to the proposed guidelines endorsed by the American Academy of Pediatrics at a center in Tucson, AZ, at an elevation of 2,643 ft (806 m). During a 10-month period in 2012, 1069 full-term asymptomatic newborns were screened ≥ 24 h after birth. The mean preductal oxygen saturation was 98.5 ± 1.3 % (range 92-100 %), and the mean postductal oxygen saturation was 98.6 ± 1.3 % (range 94-100 %). Of 1,069 patients screened, 7 were excluded secondary to protocol violations, and 1 screened positive. An echocardiogram was performed on the newborn with the positive screen, and it was normal with the exception of right-to-left shunting across a patent foramen ovale.

This rapid adoption occurred while there were still questions about the effectiveness of the recommended screening protocol and barriers to follow-up for infants with a positive screen. In response, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention partnered with the American Academy of Pediatrics to convene an expert panel between January and September 2015 representing a broad array of primary care, neonatology, pediatric cardiology, nursing, midwifery, public health, and advocacy communities. The panel's goal was to review current practices in newborn screening for CCHD and to identify opportunities for improvement. In this article, we describe the experience of CCHD screening in the United States with regard to: (1) identifying the target lesions for CCHD screening; (2) optimizing the algorithm for screening; (3) determining state-level challenges to implementation and surveillance of CCHD; (4) educating all stakeholders; (5) performing screening using the proper equipment and in a cost-effective manner; and (6) implementing screening in special settings such as the NICU, out-of-hospital settings, and areas of high altitude."

The objective of this study was to determine the clinical impact and outcomes of a staged surgical catheter-based management strategy. A retrospective analysis of 17 children with a hypoplastic right ventricle who had undergone cardiac catheterization and attempted device occlusion of an atrial defect was undertaken. Clinical data, anatomical diagnoses, previous surgeries, and interventions were noted. The clinical course and echocardiographic findings were compared before and after defect closure (6 +/- 4 months of follow-up). Nine children had pulmonary atresia with an intact ventricular septum, six had Ebstein's anomaly of the tricuspid valve, and two had isolated right ventricular hypoplasia. The mean age at defect closure was 6.6 +/- 3.4 years. Under general anesthesia, closure of the atrial defect was undertaken after initial temporary test occlusion. The Qp:Qs ratio before closure was 1.1 +/- 0.4. Oxygen saturation improved in all children from 91% +/- 1% to 98% +/- 1% (P < 0.0005). Mean right atrial pressure increased from 9 +/- 3 to 11 +/- 4 mm Hg after closure, but the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.2). Follow-up revealed an increased right ventricular length (P = 0.009) and Z-score (P = 0.02), although no significant increase in the diameter of the tricuspid valve annulus was observed in children with pulmonary atresia. Right ventricular systolic pressures or systolic function did not change significantly during follow-up (P = 0.5 and 0.29, respectively). Exercise tolerance improved in all children and clinical evidence of right ventricular decompensation was absent.

Such fetal conditions include various cardiac dysrrhythmias and some central nervous system abnormalities. Difficulties with intrapartum fetal welfare surveillance in such conditions often lead to operative delivery as a precautionary measure. We report 2 cases of intrapartum fetal oxygen saturation monitoring in the presence of congenital complete heart block (CCHB), using the Nellcor N400/FS14 oxygen saturation monitoring system. Mean intrapartum fetal oxygen saturation (FSpO2) was 32% (SEM +/- 1%) in the first case and 48% (SEM +/- 0.3%) in the second case. In both cases, vaginal delivery of otherwise healthy infants was achieved. Fetal pulse oximetry is a promising new technique which directly measures fetal oxygenation without reference to fetal heart rate patterns.

Fourteen patients (7 males and 7 females) who had undergone surgery for congenital heart disease were studied. The ages of the patients ranged from 2 months to 43 years old (mean 6.5 +/- 10.8 years old; median 3.0 years old). The diagnoses were Tetralogy of Fallot in seven, pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect (VSD) in three, complex anomalies in three, and VSD in one patient. Histological study and HSP analysis using Western blots and immunostaining with anti-HSP 72 monoclonal antibody were performed for right ventricular muscle samples resected during the surgery. The histological findings showed hypertrophic changes of ventricular cardiomyocytes in all samples studied. Western blots detected HSP 72 expression of various degrees in all specimens. Immunostaining using monoclonal antibody against HSP 72 showed that the protein was present in the nuclei and cytoplasm of cardiomyocytes. In conclusion, although it is difficult to determine the cause of the ""stress"" that triggers HSP 72 expression in cardiomyocytes, low O2 saturation and pressure overload might act as a ""stress"", and the only common factor that induced HSP 72 in every sample was hypertrophy."

A total of 120 questionnaires were returned from 114 centres. The factors that were considered important when removal of the patient's supplemental oxygen was being considered were: the oxygen saturation level in 100% responders; the respiratory rate in 62%; the heart rate in 37%; the length of time that the child had been in oxygen in 25%; changes on the chest radiograph in 22%; capillary blood gases in 18%, and arterial blood gases in 7%.

CD011912,0,10037842,0,[The role of bidirectional cavopulmonary shunt on selection of Fontan patients].,"There are no objection against that pulmonary vascular resistance index (PVRI) is one of the most important factors for completion of successful application of Fontan-type operation. However, calculated PVRI in single ventricle physiology in often unreliable because of difficulty in accurate measurement of pulmonary blood flow, especially in patients with decreased pulmonary blood flow. Although the role of bidirectional cavopulmonary shunt (BCPS) in such patients has been increasingly recognized, the impact of BCPS on PVRI has not been fully understood. Between November 1993 and November 1996, 24 patients, aged between 0.54 and 22.2 years, with a wide variety of cardiac malformations underwent BCPS, and were followed up for the mean of 15.1 months. There were four hospital deaths (16.7%) and three deaths in follow-up (12.5%). Serial catheterization revealed that significant increase in mean arterial oxygen saturation from 75.8% to 83.9% (p = 0.005), and decrease in mean Nakata's index from 433 to 311 (p < 0.0001). PVRI calculated by using formulas derived from Ohm's law before BCPS (Pulmonary flow was derived from Fick formula) was highly (greater than 10 u.m2) or moderately (between 4 and 10 u.m2) elevated in 6 and 7 patients, respectively. However, PVRI in these patients was normal after BCPS. Fourteen out of 24 patients underwent total cavopulmonary connection (TCPC) with 8 to 15 months of interval from BCPS, and have been currently surviving, and in NYHA functional class I or II, except 2 patients who underwent take-down. In conclusion, early and midterm outcome after staged operation appears to be excellent. BCPS is a good interim procedure, in part because one can more properly select patients undergoing Fontan operations from the PVRI point of view."

The percent change in each measure between the preoperative and postoperative study was calculated and compared to age, body surface area (BSA), cardiopulmonary bypass time, cross-clamp time, and number of cardioplegia (CP) doses. The pH, oxygen saturation, temperature, and hemoglobin concentration (Hb) were compared for those with and without increased flow characteristics. There was an overall increase in LAD flow parameters in subjects who underwent congenital cardiac surgery. There was a significant and positive correlation of percent change in VTI, VTIc, and VTIrrp with number of CP doses and lower Hb. We propose that this phenomenon is likely of multifactorial origin, involving autoregulatory mechanism disturbance. The imaging and measurement of LAD flow velocities are feasible, reliable, and is positively correlated with number of CP doses. Interpretation of postoperative LAD flow velocities should be made in the context of intraoperative events since heart rate, blood pressure, and Hb concentration also influence CA flow parameters."
CD011912,0,3351150,0,Determination of pulmonary to systemic blood flow ratio in children by a simplified Doppler echocardiographic method.,"Doppler echocardiographic determination of the pulmonary to systemic blood flow (Qp/Qs) ratio requires calculation of pulmonary artery and aortic luminal areas and integrals of the Doppler systolic velocity curves. To simplify the Doppler calculation of the Qp/Qs ratio, the square of the ratio of pulmonary to aortic luminal diameters, substituted for the ratio of vessel areas, was multiplied by the ratio of pulmonary to aortic peak flow velocities, substituted for the ratio of velocity time integrals. The Qp/Qs ratios were calculated by both the conventional and the simplified Doppler method in 42 children, 1 month to 16 years of age. Fifteen children had no evidence of shunt and 27 had an intracardiac left to right shunt at the atrial or ventricular level, or both. In children with a shunt, the Qp/Qs ratio obtained at cardiac catheterization by oximetry ranged from 1.4:1 to 4.3:1. Both the conventional and the simplified Doppler Qp/Qs ratios correlated well with the oximetric Qp/Qs ratios (r = 0.94 and 0.93, respectively). Since the pulmonary to aortic luminal area ratio and velocity time integral ratio varied in each patient, neither measurement alone correlated well with the oximetric Qp/Qs ratio and, therefore, neither alone could be used as an estimate of the Qp/Qs ratio. The simplified Doppler calculation of the Qp/Qs ratio, which requires less time and no computer facilities, provides an excellent estimate of the Qp/Qs ratio in children."

CD011912,0,8023126,0,[Doppler echocardiography assessment of hemodynamic values and additional heart defects in atrial septal defects].,"Due to the rapid progress in (Doppler-) echocardiography ""one must question whether cardiac catheterisation remains a necessary prelude to cardiac surgery in atrial septal defects"" (8). Although the estimation of the magnitude of the intracardiac shunt and the anatomical size of the defect ist possible by (Doppler-) echocardiography there remains the problem of associated disorders (e.g. anomalies of the pulmonary venous connection) which may not be detected by transthoracic echocardiography. In 25 children submitted to cardiac catheterisation studies in the period between 1990 and 1992, the anatomical size of an atrial septal defect was measured echocardiographically. The haemodynamic parameters Qp/Qs and Rp/Rs were employed to calculate the so-called effective resistance of the defect (Rd/Rs), which was derived from an electrical analogue and represents the ratio of the resistance of the defect (Rd) to the systemic vascular resistance (Rs). The echocardiographically measured anatomical size (expressed as the ratio of the area of the defect to the cross-sectional area of the ascending aorta) was related to the effective resistance of the defect. A significant (non-linear) correlation was found between Rd/Rs and the anatomical size of defect. Based on these data we developed a nomogram describing the relationship of the size of the defect to the haemodynamic parameters (Qp/Qs and Rp/Rs). If the data of a patient do not comply with this nomogram there is strong evidence of an additional cardiovascular malformation, necessitating further evaluation. A second cohort of four patients with associated defects (partial and total anomalous pulmonary venous connection and a corresponding sinus venosus defect) was clearly identified by the nomogram method."

The study used a cross-over experimental design, 32 premature infants with gestational age < 37 weeks, bodyweight <or= 2500 grams, and no diagnosis of congenital heart disease, deformity, sepsis or <or=Grade 3 intraventricular hemorrhage were selected as subjects. Each subject was randomly assigned to containment or swaddling once while undergoing two heelsticks in different time periods. Heart rate, oxygen saturation, facial expression and PIPP score were recorded from 5 minutes before to 11 minutes after heelstick. According to the paired t test, the results showed (1). that mean HR was higher and mean SpO(2) was lower than their respective baseline values under the two interventions after heelstick (p <.05), and that premature infants in swaddling returned to their baseline HR and SpO(2) values in shorter time periods compared to those in containment, though the variations of HR and SpO(2) between the two interventions exhibited no significant differences; and (2). that pain responses to heelstick under swaddling yielded lower scores than those under containment according to the total PIPP scores, but significant difference between the two interventions was only found at the 3rd and 7th minute. As a whole, there is little difference between the effects of swaddling and containment on attenuating physiological and behavioral stress caused by acute pain. The results of this study can serve as an evidence basis for nursing interventions in acute pain for premature infants. In clinical practice, containment and swaddling can be administered interchangeably according to patients' individual differences."
CD011912,0,1581087,0,Staged chest closure in pediatric cardiac surgery preventing typical and atypical cardiac tamponade.,"Chest closure after cardiac surgery occasionally results in cardiac compression leading to circulatory failure. In shunt-dependent circulation, the arterial oxygen saturation may decrease significantly due to the increase in pulmonary vascular resistance caused by chest closure. Temporary patch implantation with delayed sternal closure facilitates circulatory and/or pulmonary stabilization (temporary chest wall patch plasty, TCWPP). Between July 1986 and June 1991, 42 patients underwent staged chest closure (TCWPP) after open heart surgery for congenital lesions (4.9% of 854 patients). TCWPP was performed when either primary hemodynamic deterioration or an increase in cyanosis (palliative procedures only) followed by hemodynamic deterioration occurred during attempted or shortly after sternal closure. Overall mortality was 40.4% (17/42). It was 32.3% (11/34) when the patch was inserted primarily at the end of the operation. If the patch was inserted emergently 4-24 h postoperatively, mortality was 75% (6/8). Definite chest closure was performed from 4 h to 6 days (mean 72 h) postoperatively. In 2 patients closure had to be performed emergently (single ventricles); 7 patients died before chest closure. One mediastinal microbiology examination was positive. Deep sternal infection necessitating operative revision occurred in one other patient. In conclusion, TCWPP may considerably lower mortality of the illest patients after surgery for complex congenital heart disease. A timely decision as to the performance of staged chest closure is mandatory. This procedure rarely causes infection. We now apply this technique liberally, by cardio-mediastinal size judgement in over 30% of our TCWPP candidates even without a prior trial of primary closure."

CD011912,0,7296584,0,Determinants of systemic vascular resistance in children with congenital heart disease.,"It is well known on the basis of acute experiments that changes in systemic arterial oxygen saturation, haemoglobin concentration and acid-base state produce changes in systemic vascular resistance. However, it is not known whether the same changes occur in the chronic state. In order to investigate this problem, we measured systemic vascular resistance in a population in whom chronic changes in these variables are common, namely 195 subjects with congenital heart disease. The significance of these factors was assessed by their ability to predict systemic vascular resistance in a multiple regression equation which also took account of the size of the patient. No matter how the size of the patient was allowed for, haemoglobin concentration, systemic arterial pH (or non-respiratory pH) and systemic arterial oxygen saturation were significantly (P less than 0.025) and positively correlated with systemic vascular resistance. We conclude that, as far as these factors are concerned, the mechanisms operating in the acute state continue to function in the chronic state."
CD011912,0,6167010,0,Further experience with the two-stage anatomic correction of simple transposition of the great arteries.,"Between May 1976 and January 1981 a two-stage anatomic correction was performed in 25 patients with simple transposition of the great arteries, ranging in age from 41/2 to 46 1/2 months (mean 14.8). A first-stage operation, consisting of banding of the pulmonary artery to redevelop the left ventricle, including a Blalock-Taussig-anastomosis in 4 patients was performed prior to anatomic correction. Of 33 patients, who underwent first-stage correction there were 3 early deaths (9%). The interval between the first and second stages was 5 weeks to 9 months (mean 4.3 months). After the first-stage operation, the peak systolic left ventricular pressure rose from 34 +/- 11 mmHg to 80 +/- 16 mmHg with no significant change in enddiastolic pressure. After anatomic correction there were 5 early deaths (20%) of whom 4 were due to left heart failure. There was no correlation between death and the age of the patients at the time of anatomic correction. By our current criteria the ventricles were not adequately prepared for correction in these four patients. The coronary arteries, with different types of origin, could be reimplanted to the posterior vessels without kinking, tension or torsion in all cases. After correction, the ECG and vectorcardiogram rapidly changed toward normal. The arterial oxygen saturation was higher than 95% in all patients. Recatheterization performed in 11 patients, 3 weeks to 27 months after correction, showed normal left ventricular pressure at rest in all children, except in 2 recatheterized early after correction, who had moderately elevated left ventricular enddiastolic pressure. Right ventricular peak systolic pressure decreased to normal limits. The aortic and coronary anastomoses showed normal growth in cineangiography. Although the two-stage corrections of simple TGA may have its own problems, investigation suggests that results are encouraging."

CD011912,0,3802439,0,Systemic oxygen transport in patients with congenital heart disease.,"The physiology of oxygen delivery was studied in 118 stable patients from 3 months to 20 years old with congenital heart disease. During cardiac catheterization, oxygen consumption (VO2), arterial and venous blood gases and oxygen saturations (range 41% to 98%), hemoglobin concentration, diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG), and P50 levels were measured, and then cardiac output, systemic oxygen transport (SOT), arterial and venous oxygen contents, and the VO2/SOT ratio (fractional O2 extraction) were calculated. P50 averaged 31 mm Hg, compared with 27 mm Hg in 10 control children (p less than .01). The composite O2-hemoglobin dissociation curve in vivo was broad: Po2 varied from 37 to 65 mm Hg at 80% saturation. P50, 2,3-DPG, hemoglobin concentrations, and O2 saturation varied widely and inconsistently with Po2 and arterial and venous O2 content, but resulted in clustering of the arterial oxygen content near 165 +/- 23 (SD) ml/liter over a wide range of Po2 and hemoglobin concentrations. SOT varied in direct relation with flow (r = .82, p less than .001), but not with oxygen content, Po2, or P50. VO2 varied widely at normal or high levels of SOT, but decreased linearly at SOT levels below 400 ml/min/m2. Oxygen extraction varied inversely with venous O2 content, rising to about 50% and plateauing below venous contents of 100 ml/liter. O2 extraction did not correlate with Po2, arterial O2 content, or P50. These data suggest that: O2 saturation cannot be predicted or calculated accurately from measured Po2, but must be measured directly, 2,3-DPG, hemoglobin concentration, and P50 fluctuate to stabilize arterial oxygen content, SOT is determined primarily by cardiac output in subjects who are adapted chronically, O2 extraction rises, due to a fall in venous O2 content, to maintain VO2 as transport falls, below a critical level of SOT, O2 extraction ceases to rise and VO2 falls with further reduction in transport."

Qualitative and quantitative analysis (author's transl)].,"36 patients, less than two years old, affected by Fallot's tetralogy were studied by vectorcardiography. The configuration of the QRS loop in the three orthogonal planes, the voltage of the 0.10 sec spatial vector, RMSV and LMSV vectors, and their azimuth and elevation were evaluated. Such data have been correlated to arterial oxygen saturation. Qualitative analysis showed a clockwise or figure eight QRS loop on the H and F planes in the great majority of cases; and only in a counterclockwise loop on the H plane was the suspicion of an arterial oxygen saturation greater than 85% especially in cases older than two months. The terminal forces of the QRS loop on the H plane were always directed under the O point, Whereas in the valvular pulmonary stenosis, terminal forces are generally superior to the O point. Quantitative analysis demonstrated the constant increase of the RMSV and the direct relationship of the LMSV to arterial oxygen saturation, and so it was the principal parameter for evaluation of the left ventricular volume and the size of pulmonary flow and the degree of pulmonary stenosis. The relationship between the azimuth of 0.01 sec spatial vector to O2 saturation was highly significant, showing a progressive anterior development of the former, as the latter increased."

Hospital admission should be considered for children with pulse oximetry levels less than 95 percent at rest. Treatment consists of humidified oxygen, intravenous hydration and administration of nebulized albuterol. Infants with mild disease who are identified early in the course of illness should be reevaluated in 24 hours.

CD011912,0,24877491,0,A neonate with critical congenital heart disease.,"Critical congenital heart disease (CCHD) is defined as a ductal-dependent congenital heart defect requiring surgical or percutaneous intervention via cardiac catheterization before 1 year of age. Most cases of CCHD can be diagnosed with prenatal ultrasound or fetal echocardiogram. If not prenatally diagnosed, CCHD can be stable in the newborn nursery due to persistent ductal patency, and the patient may only be diagnosed after ductal closure and development of cardiac symptoms at home. In this case, a 6-day-old female presented to the emergency department (ED) floppy with agonal respirations, poor capillary refill, and absent femoral pulses. On the day of presentation, the patient became increasingly fussy, refused feeding, and began to gasp. The patient was transported to the ED for evaluation, where a bedside echocardiogram revealed interrupted aortic arch (IAA), ventricular septal defect, minimal flow through a thread-like ductus arteriosus, and severely depressed cardiac function. IAA is very rare, with an incidence of three cases per 1 million live births. Patients require neonatal supportive care, continuous prostaglandin E1 infusion, and urgent referral for neonatal surgical repair in the first days to weeks of life. To reduce the volume of undiagnosed CCHD in the immediate newborn period, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary's Advisory Committee on Heritable Diseases in Newborns and Children (SACHDNC) recommended that CCHD screening via pulse oximetry be added to the recommended uniform screening panel. A positive screen results in an immediate referral for an echocardiogram. Fetal diagnosis, newborn screening, and/or careful clinical examination may have resulted in detection of IAA in our patient prior to ductal closure."

Cardiac catheterization and angiography were performed at age 1 month to 5.8 years (mean 1.4 years). All patients had decreased pulmonary blood flow. The results were compared with data in 15 patients with no significantly greater than normal in 12 of the 13 patients. Left ventricular mass was significantly greater than normal, but ejection fraction was significantly less than normal. There was a positive correlation between ejection fraction and systemic oxygen saturation. Left ventricular systolic index was normal in 9 of the 13 patients preoperatively. After a shunt procedure, left ventricular end-diastolic volume and systolic index increased significantly in all four patients, and ejection fraction improved greatly in three of the four. After corrective surgery, left ventricular end-diastolic volume and left ventricular systolic index returned to the normal range and left ventricular ejection fraction improved. These findings suggest that patients with tricuspid atresia have impaired left ventricular function."
CD011912,0,18619872,0,The effect of changes in tPCO2 on the fractional tissue oxygen extraction--as measured by near-infrared spectroscopy--in neonates during the first days of life.,"The cerebral fractional oxygen extraction (FOE) reflects the balance between cerebral oxygen delivery (OD) and consumption (VO(2)). PCO(2) affects the cerebral blood flow (CBF): hypocapnia decreases CBF and OD and increases FOE. We recently showed that the fractional tissue oxygen extraction (FTOE) reflects FOE and hypothesized that a decrease in tPCO(2) increases FTOE. In this study we looked at the effect of changes in tPCO(2) on FTOE. We analysed 23 measurements in 13 neonates with birth weight below 1500 g and need for intensive care. Exclusion criteria were congenital malformations or cerebral complications. The tissue oxygenation index (TOI), tPCO(2), mean arterial blood pressure (MABP), heart rate (HR) and peripheral oxygen saturation (SaO(2)) were continuously recorded for 4h during the first days of life and FTOE was calculated. Over the whole group we found a significant negative (r=-0.227) correlation between tPCO(2) and FTOE and a significant positive (r=0.258) correlation between tPCO(2) and TOI. After correction for MABP these correlations remained significant. Over the whole group we found a significant positive correlation between tPCO(2) and TOI and a significant negative correlation between tPCO(2) and FTOE, which remained significant after correction for MABP. This implies that tPCO(2) influences the cerebral oxygenation independently of MABP. We therefore believe that for the interpretation of cerebral oxygenation in mechanically ventilated neonates during the first days of life continuous measurements of tPCO(2) are needed. Moreover we suggest FTOE to become a continuous parameter in the clinical setting for the non-invasive measurement of the neonatal brain oxygenation."

Various congenital anomalies in combination with ACD have been reported, except for subglottic stenosis. Therefore, we aim to report a novel association in a case of ACD with the combination of atypical duodenal atresia and subglottic stenosis. The male infant was scheduled for duodeno-duodenostomy because a double-bubble sign was observed on a chest radiograph. He arrived at the operating theater without any symptoms. After induction of general anesthesia, although mask ventilation was performed without difficulties throughout the entire procedure, oxygen saturation values of the upper and lower extremities dissociated after several attempts of intubation. Surgery was canceled because of instability of the respiratory condition. Respiratory insufficiency worsened progressively, and the infant died at 5 days of age. An autopsy confirmed ACD and revealed cartilaginous subglottic stenosis, which had made intubation difficult. This report highlights the hazards of the onset and worsening of ACD, and the importance of thorough echocardiography before surgery when atypical duodenal atresia is suspected. Anesthesiologists should also be prepared for the difficulty of intubation."

CDC partnered with the National Birth Defects Prevention Network (NBDPN) to conduct a survey designed to assess state birth defect surveillance programs' potential roles, capabilities, and readiness to assist with newborn screening activities for CCHD. States were surveyed in November 2010, after the initial SACHDNC recommendation, and again in November 2011, after the Secretary's approval. From 2010 to 2011, the number of birth defects surveillance programs involved in CCHD screening increased from one to 10. Barriers exist, such as the lack of legislative authority, staffing, funding, and informatics infrastructure. Sixty-seven percent of programs take an average of more than 12 months to collect complete data on birth defect cases, including congenital heart defects. An assessment of state birth defects programs' existing data and capability to lead the evaluation of screening for CCHD is warranted."

Studies indicate that blood lactate level is proportional to tissue oxygen debt, but information linking lactate levels with outcome in infants after operation is limited.

The effect of hypothermia or changes in CPP on rSO2, SjvO2, SvO2, and BIS were analyzed.Compared with postinduction baseline values, rSO2 significantly decreased at all-time points: onset of extracorporeal circulation, ascending aortic occlusion, 20 minutes after CPB initiation, coronary reperfusion, and separation from CPB (P < 0.05). Compared with measurements made following induction of anesthesia, SjvO2 significantly increased with initiation of CPB, ascending aortic occlusion, 20 minutes after initiating CPB, coronary reperfusion, and separation from CPB (P < 0.05). Compared with induction of anesthesia, BIS significantly decreased with the onset of CPB, aortic cross clamping, 20 minutes after initiating CPB, and coronary reperfusion (P < 0.05). Bispectral index increased following separation from CPB. There was no significant change in SvO2 during cardiopulmonary bypass (P > 0.05). Correlation analysis demonstrated that rSO2 was positively related to CPP (r = 0.687, P = 0.000), with a low linear correlation to temperature (r = 0.453, P = 0.000). Internal jugular bulb venous oxygen saturation was negatively related to temperature (r = -0.689, P = 0.000). Bispectral index was positively related to both temperature (r = 0.824, P = 0.000) and CPP (r = 0.782, P = 0.000). Cerebral oxygen saturation had a positive linear correlation with CPP and a low linear correlation to temperature. Internal jugular bulb venous oxygen saturation had a negative linear correlation to temperature.Pre-and and early postbypass periods are vulnerable times for adequate cerebral oxygenation. Anesthetic management must aim to optimize the supply and demand relationship."
CD011912,0,26264796,0,Implications of Using Pulse Oximetry to Screen for Critical Congenital Heart Disease in Newborns.,"In recent years, pulse oximetry screening for critical congenital heart disease (CCHD) in newborns has been added to the list of recommended uniform screening panels and recommended by several health care organizations. Most states use pulse oximetry to screen for CCHD. Studies have identified problems with compliance and higher failure rate at moderate altitudes than at sea level, suggesting the need for alternate algorithms. Altitude, time, health status of newborns and type of cardiac defect appear to affect results. Early detection of CCHD improves health outcomes and reduces morbidity and mortality. Barriers to screening include out-of-hospital births, cost and knowledge deficits among health care professionals."

Blood sugar levels (BSL), acid-base balance and oxygen saturation have been studies in 10 babies from 7.5 to 15 months of age, weighing less than 9kg, before, during and after open-heart surgery. Preoperative mean BSL in the anaesthetized patient was 76mg per cent. It rose slightly after the onset of surgery and further increased to an average of 205mg per cent during cardio-pulmonary bypass with the temperature stablized at 28-29 degrees C. In the early postoperative phase BSL normalized but slowly, reaching a mean value of 107mg per cent 20-24h after the end of surgery. These results demonstrate that, at least under the usual conditions of extracorporeal circulation and hypothermia at our clinic, hypoglycaemia is not a threat in babies undergoing open-heart surgery for total correction of congenital lesions. The possible mechanisms leading to the observed hyperglycaemia are discussed and the results compared with similar studies in adult patients."

In this patient group, the oxygen delivery to the myocardium depends on the oxygen saturation of the right ventricular cavity. We hypothesized that bidirectional Glenn shunt would improve the oxygenation of right ventricle-dependent coronary circulation relative to a systemic-pulmonary artery shunt. The reduction of systemic venous return to the right atrium due to a bidirectional Glenn shunt could increase the oxygen saturation of the right ventricle in the clinical setting, when the mixture of systemic and pulmonary venous blood is unchanged at the atrial level."

The purpose of this study was to develop, implement, and test the utility of a nurse-driven algorithm that would support and serve as a guide for detection of cCHD in asymptomatic newborns using POS prior to discharge home from the hospital. Results showed that this collaborative protocol was easily implemented in a community hospital. The universal algorithm enhances POS and clinical examination to identify asymptomatic infants with undiagnosed cCHD prior to discharge from the hospital."

Improved diagnosis and quantitation of left-to-right shunts using area ratio techniques in children.,"A comparison of several reported methods for detection and quantitation of left-to-right shunts by radionuclides was performed in 50 children. Count ratio (C2/C1) techniques were compared with the exponential extrapolation and gamma function area ratio techniques. C2/C1 ratios accurately detected shunts and could reliably separate shunts from normals, but there was a high rate of false positives in children with valvular heart disease. The area ratio methods provided more accurate shunt quantitation and a better separation of patients with valvular heart disease than did the C2/C1 ratio. The gamma function method showed a higher correlation with oximetry than the exponential method, but the difference was not statistically significant. For accurate shunt quantitation and a reliable separation of patients with valvular heart disease from those with shunts, area ratio calculations are preferable to the C2/C1 ratio."

CD011912,0,18758814,0,Differential diagnosis of apneas in preterm infants.,"Clinically relevant apneas, which are common in preterm infants, may adversely affect later neuropsychological condition in this group of patients. Pharmacotherapy to stimulate respiratory functions may be unsuccessful. Polygraphic recording may help in the differential diagnosis of these clinically relevant events. Twenty-nine preterm neonates born before 36 weeks of gestational age were examined using polygraphic recording (respiration--two channels, perioral electromyography, oxygen saturation, heart rate, electroencephalography, electrocardiography, electrooculography). The examination was ordered by the attending physician after an unsuccessful treatment of apnea by Aminophylline, and it should contribute to the clarification of the causes of these events. In the course of the polygraphic examinations, altogether 63 episodes were recorded during which the pulse oximeter alarm signal was set off. In 42 cases, the alarm signal was set off in events during which SaO(2) fell below 85%. In the remaining 21 cases, the alarm signal was set off in episodes during which early bradycardia below 90/min occurred. The onset of apnea was very often associated with the phasic increase of the perioral electromyography and with electroencephalography arousal reaction. Because of suspicion that these apneas may be triggered by episodes of gastroesophageal reflux, the interruption of the Aminophylline treatment and setting up an antireflux regimen were recommended. These therapeutic measures had a positive effect: The frequency of alarm signals decreased within 48 h by a statistically significant 50%. In cases where the pharmacotherapy of apnea by stimulation of respiratory functions is not successful, differential diagnostic analysis should be performed. Polygraphy may contribute to the clarification of the causes underlying clinically relevant apneas in a view of newly described polygraphic signs. It is feasible to suspect, based on these signs, that gastroesophageal reflux is the cause for clinically significant apneas in that case."

All patients (mean body weight, 11.4 +/- 4.2 kg; range, 6 to 20 kg; mean age, 32 +/- 21 months, range, 7 to 85 months) were premedicated with atropine, 0.02, mg/kg, morphine, 0.2, mg/kg, and flunitrazepam, 0.04 mg/kg, intramuscularly, 1 hour preoperatively. Anesthesia was induced with 1 microgram/kg of sufentanil (S) and pancuronium, 0.1 mg/kg, intravenously. Patients were ventilated with 100% oxygen. Hemodynamic parameters, heart rate (HR), systolic (SBP), diastolic (DBP) and mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), central venous pressure (CVP), and peripheral arterial blood oxygen saturation (SaO2) were recorded. Plasma concentrations of S, epinephrine (E), norepinephrine (NE), and blood gases were determined. To obtain a further depth of anesthesia, 10 patients (SM group) received 4 micrograms/kg of S and 10 patients (SF group) received 4 micrograms/kg of S in combination with flunitrazepam, 40 micrograms/kg, in a randomized manner. Measurements were made before and after induction of anesthesia, before and after anesthetic loading, 2 minutes after sternotomy, 15 minutes after initiation of extracorporeal circulation (ECC), and at sternal closure. Peak values for plasma S concentrations of 3.14 +/- 1.13 (SM group) and 3.45 +/- 97 ng/mL (SF group) were found before sternotomy. Following intubation HR, SBP, DBP, and MAP remained close to values measured before induction, but SaO2 increased significantly (P less than 0.01) in all patients. HR, SBP, and MAP decreased during anesthetic loading in both groups. Hemodynamics and plasma E and NE remained essentially unchanged after sternotomy in the SF group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD011912,0,145637,0,Right ventricular hypertrophy in tetralogy of Fallot.,"Histopathological studies were carried out on right ventricular myocardium in 104 patients with tetralogy of Fallot (T/F). Detailed analysis of the correlation between morphological and clinical data was performed. Right ventricular hypertrophy in T/F was found to initiate immediately after birth, and the diameter of right ventricular muscle fiber (D) increased with age (r = 0.74). There was a correlation between D and the hemoglobin level. There was, however, no correlation between D arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2), and pulmonary trunk/aorta diameter (PA/Ao) ratio. Histopathological alterations were related directly to D and to the age of the patient, and were unrelated to hemoglobin, SaO2, and PA/Ao ratio. Irreversible histopathological alterations were first observed when the D exceeded 15 micron, when most patients were four years old or more. From these findings, it is considered that the optimal age for corrective surgery to prevent irreversible alteration of the right ventricular muscle fibers in patients with T/F is less than three years."

CD011912,0,25311762,0,Propofol effect on cerebral oxygenation in children with congenital heart disease.,"Propofol is a short-acting, intravenously administered hypnotic agent which is used in procedural sedation in children. Propofol is known to decrease systemic vascular resistance, arterial blood pressure and can lead to desaturations and decreased systemic perfusion in children with cardiac shunting. This may result in a reduction in cerebral blood flow and oxygenation. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) can monitor cerebral tissue oxygenation in the frontal neocortex. The objective of our study was to measure the changes in cerebral oxygen and blood supply after Propofol infusion in children with congenital heart disease. Propofol infusion may reduce cerebral oxygenation in children with congenital heart disease. The study group consisted of 32 children (f:m = 18:14), with median age of 49 (5-112) months and median weight of 15 (5-34) kg. We performed NIRS derived continuous measurement of cerebral oxygenation and cardiac output using Electrical velocimetry for 5 min before and after sedation with Propofol (1-2 mg/kg i.v.) for cardiac catheterization. Simultaneously, non-invasive arterial blood pressure and transcutaneous oxygen saturation were measured. Propofol sedation led to a significant decrease in mean arterial pressure (79 ± 16 vs. 67 ± 12 mmHg) (p = 0.01) and cardiac index (3.2 ± 0.8 vs. 2.9 ± 0.6 ml/min/m(2)) (p = 0.03). In contrast, cerebral tissue oxygenation index, increased significantly from 57 ± 11 to 59 ± 10 % (p < 0.05). Sedation with Propofol increased cerebral tissue oxygenation despite a decrease in cardiac index and arterial blood pressure. This may be caused by a decreased oxygen consumption of the sedated brain with intact cerebral auto-regulation."

Sixteen patients had noncyanotic congenital heart disease and 17 patients had cyanotic congenital heart disease. In the noncyanotic congenital heart disease group, pulse oximeter saturations decreased from 98.1% +/- 1.5% (mean +/- SD), before premedication, to 96.5% +/- 1.5% following premedication. Although this decrease was statistically significant (P less than 0.05), it was determined to not be clinically meaningful. In the patients with cyanotic congenital heart disease, oxygen saturation increased from 73.5% +/- 11.8 to 74.7% +/- 10.2 following premedication, but this change was not statistically significant. The effect of premedication on SaO2 was highly variable in patients with cyanotic heart disease; although the group mean appeared to increase, 6 of the 17 patients had decreases in saturation and the decrease exceeded 10% in saturation in 3 of them. Therefore, oxygen saturation should be monitored following premedication in patients with cyanotic heart disease and oxygen administered as needed."

CD011912,0,23196891,0,Efficacy and predictors of success of noninvasive ventilation for prevention of extubation failure in critically ill children with heart disease.,"The study aimed primarily to evaluate the efficacy of noninvasive ventilation (NIV) and to identify possible predictors for success of NIV therapy in preventing extubation failure in critically ill children with heart disease. The secondary objectives of this study were to assess the efficacy of prophylactic NIV therapy initiated immediately after tracheal extubation and to determine the characteristics, outcomes, and complications associated with NIV therapy in pediatric cardiac patients. A retrospective review examined the medical records of all children between the ages 1 day and 18 years who sustained acute respiratory failure (ARF) that required NIV in the cardiovascular intensive care unit (CVICU) at Lucile Packard Children's Hospital between January 2008 and June 2010. Patients were assigned to a prophylactic group if NIV was started directly after extubation and to a nonprophylactic group if NIV was started after signs and symptoms of ARF developed. Patients were designated as responders if they received NIV and did not require reintubation during their CVICU stay and nonresponders if they failed NIV and reintubation was performed. The data collected included demographic data, preexisting conditions, pre-event characteristics, event characteristics, and outcome data. The outcome data evaluated included success or failure of NIV, duration of NIV, CVICU length of stay (LOS), hospital LOS, and hospital mortality. The two complications of NIV assessed in the study included nasal bridge or forehead skin necrosis and pneumothorax. The 221 eligible events during the study period involved 172 responders (77.8 %) and 49 nonresponders (22.2 %). A total of 201 events experienced by the study cohort received continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), with 156 responders (78 %), whereas 20 events received bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP), with 16 responders (80 %). In the study, 58 events (26.3 %) were assigned to the prophylactic group and 163 events (73.7 %) to the nonprophylactic group. Compared with the nonprophylactic group, the prophylactic group experienced significantly shorter CVICU LOS (median, 49 vs 88 days; p = 0.03) and hospital LOS (median, 60 vs 103 days; p = 0.05). The CVICU LOS and hospital LOS did not differ significantly between the responders (p = 0.56) and nonresponders (p = 0.88). Significant variables identifying a responder included a lower risk-adjusted classification for congenital heart surgery (RACHS-1) score (1-3), a good left ventricular ejection fraction, a normal respiratory rate (RR), normal or appropriate oxygen saturation, prophylactic or therapeutic glucocorticoid therapy within 24 h of NIV initiation, presence of atelectasis, fewer than two organ system dysfunctions, fewer days of intubation before extubation, no clinical or microbiologic evidence of sepsis, and no history of reactive airway disease. As a well-tolerated therapy, NIV can be safely and successfully applied in critically ill children with cardiac disease to prevent extubation failure. The independent predictors of NIV success include lower RACHS-1 classification, presence of atelectasis, steroid therapy received within 24 h after NIV, and normal heart rate and oxygen saturations demonstrated within 24 h after initiation of NIV."

The palliative Mustard procedure-a Mustard repair without VSD closure-is usually reserved for patients with pulmonary vascular obstructive disease (PVOD). In such cases, VSD closure would result in left ventricular failure. Each of our four patients had normal or only slightly elevated pulmonary resistance (1.0 to 5.2 Wood units). However, in each case a hypoplastic right ventricle precluded VSD closure. All four patients had transposition-like hemodynamics with unfavorable streaming to the great arteries, despite the fact that two patients had a levo arterial configuration. In each case, the ventricular relationship included a hypoplastic, superior right ventricle with a horizontal ventricular septum-the so-called ""upstairs-downstairs"" or ""superior-inferior"" heart. All patients had previous balloon atrial septostomy or open septectomy to improve atrial mixing. Two patients had previous pulmonary artery banding because of increased pulmonary flow. All four patients remain survivors of the palliative Mustard or Senning repair, which was performed at 10 months, 5 1/2, 12, and 16 years. In each case, there was a marked improvement of symptomatology with a decrease of hemoglobin (mean 21.1 gm/dl preoperatively to 15.3 gm/dl postoperatively) and an increase of arterial oxygen saturation (mean 78 vol % preoperatively to 93 vol % postoperatively). This is the first palliative Mustard or Senning repairs in patients with TGA, VSD, and hypoplastic right ventricle without PVOD. The procedure produces gratifying palliation for these patients."

PGE1 increased the arterial oxygen saturation, leading to stable intraoperative hemodynamics in the six infants in whom it was used. FID was used in all 13 patients. Four of these patients died in the hospital, all with the ductus open. Of the nine early survivors, all required an additional shunt procedure.

CD011912,0,8415214,0,Hemodynamic correlates of clinical severity in isolated ventricular septal defect.,"To test the hypothesis that the clinical assessment of severity in ventricular septal defect would be more related to variables which define tissue oxygen delivery than variables which define the left-to-right shunt, cardiac catheterization data from 40 children < 3 years of age were assessed. Variables which were considered indicative of clinical severity included the need for digoxin and diuretics, resting heart rate, and severity of growth failure. Variables measured at cardiac catheterization, including those which related to oxygen transport, and assessment of left-to-right shunt, were considered independently. Patients receiving digoxin and diuretics were more tachycardic (142 +/- 18 vs. 111 +/- 26 beats/min, p < 0.001) and had lower superior vena cava oxygen saturation (64 +/- 6 vs. 69 +/- 5%, p < 0.01). Variation in heart rate (r2 = 0.46) was best explained by oxygen consumption, hemoglobin concentration, cardiac index, and pulmonary vascular resistance. Variation in growth failure (r2 = 0.15) was related only to the left ventricular forward stroke index. These data suggest that variables related to oxygen delivery, including oxygen consumption, hemoglobin concentration, cardiac index, forward stroke index, and superior vena cava oxygen saturation, are the major contributors to the clinical assessment of severity in ventricular septal defect."
CD011912,0,2483339,0,Palliative Mustard operation: an expanded horizon.,"From March 1982 to December 1983, five patients with a mean age 7 years (4 months-16 years) underwent a palliative Mustard operation for complex cardiac anomalies. The diagnoses were: univentricular heart with pulmonary vascular obstructive disease (PVOD) (2 cases); criss-cross heart with intact atrial septum, ventricular septal defect (VSD), transposition of the great arteries (TGA) and moderate pulmonary stenosis; isolated atrioventricular discordance with VSD; TGA, diminutive right ventricle and multiple VSDs. Cardiac catheterization showed unfavourable direction of flow: the oxygen saturation in the aorta was lower than in pulmonary artery, with a mean difference of 13.5% (range 6% to 30%). In no case was anatomical or physiological repair considered advisable because of the unfavourable intracardiac anatomy or the presence of PVOD. In two patients the atrial rerouting was accompanied by pulmonary artery banding. There were no hospital or late deaths in a mean follow-up of 36 months (range 29 to 50 months). The mean post-operative arterial oxygen saturation was 95.4% (range 92% to 99%)."

CD011912,0,1852523,0,Comparative circulatory effects of isoproterenol and dopamine in lambs with experimental cyanotic heart disease.,"To determine whether the hemodynamic responses to adrenergic agonists are altered during chronic hypoxemia secondary to an intracardiac right to left shunt, we studied seven lambs with surgically created pulmonic stenosis and atrial septal defect and nine controls during infusions of isoproterenol at 0.1 and 0.5 micrograms/kg/min and dopamine at 5 and 20 micrograms/kg/min. Isoproterenol increased heart rate by 89 +/- 17% in control but only 46 +/- 6% in experimental lambs (p less than 0.05). However, because resting heart rate was higher in experimental lambs (213 +/- 7 versus 177 +/- 12 beats/min, p less than 0.05), maximal heart rates were similar (310 +/- 7 versus 326 +/- 6 beats/min; NS). Cardiac output increased during isoproterenol from 219 +/- 20 to 425 +/- 54 mL/min/kg in experimental lambs (p less than 0.05) and, similarly, from 180 +/- 20 to 425 +/- 71 in controls (p less than 0.05) (experimental versus control; NS). Dopamine also increased cardiac output similarly in both groups, at both doses, but without changing heart rate. Isoproterenol did not alter aortic oxygen saturation and increased systemic oxygen transport more than oxygen consumption. In contrast, dopamine at both doses decreased aortic oxygen saturation in experimental lambs (rest, 71 +/- 2% versus dopamine, 59 +/- 2%; p less than 0.05). With dopamine, the increase in systemic oxygen transport was equalled by an increase in oxygen consumption. Thus, circulatory responses to isoproterenol are similar in lambs with experimental cyanotic heart disease and controls, although higher resting heart rate in the experimental lambs reduces chronotropic reserve.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

CD011912,0,9763910,0,Balloon atrial septostomy under echocardiographic guidance. Case report.,"A seven-days-old male neonate was transferred to our institution in critically ill condition. Echocardiographic (ECHO) examination revealed the transposition of the great arteries (TGA) with a small ventricular septal defect. In the laboratory examination, arterial oxygen saturation was 29 percent and pH was 7.16. The poor condition of the neonate led us to decide to perform an immediate bedside balloon atrial septostomy (BAS) in the intensive care unit (ICU) with ECHO guidance. The umbilical vein was cannulated with a 5 Fr. Miller BAS catheter. Four balloon passes were performed resulting in large atrial septal defect. After the procedure, arterial oxygen saturation was measured at 40 percent. In TGA, the baby may present with severe hypoxia and may need management in the ICU. Emergency BAS may improve the clinical condition of the patient. Transferring the baby, who is mechanically ventilated (and is in openbed), to the catheterization laboratory takes time and can be harmful for him, and carries risk of extubation and heat loss. The limitations of transthoracic ECHO guidance of BAS include the possibility of a poor ECHO window in an ill neonate on assisted ventilation and possible interference with maneuverability for both echocardiographer and catheter operator. It also carries the risk of contamination of the sterile field. When the advantages and disadvantages of transthoracic ECHO guidance are considered, transferring the baby to the catheterization laboratory can cause problems and time loss. Thus, ECHO-guided BAS at bedside is an efficient and good alternative. The transumbilical approach may be easier in the first few days of life."

CD011912,0,22605877,0,A clue to the diagnosis of TAPVD.,Total anomalous pulmonary venous drainage (TAPVD) is a rare form of congenital heart disease where all four pulmonary veins drain to the systemic venous circulation. A term infant was found to have low oxygen saturations on the neonatal check and he was admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit. An increasing oxygen requirement necessitated invasive ventilation. A blood gas taken from the umbilical venous catheter (UVC) showed a pO(2) of 28.1kPa - a finding that at the time was considered to be erroneous. An x-ray showed the UVC tip was located in the liver. The following day the baby was transferred to a cardiology centre where a diagnosis of unobstructed infracardiac TAPVD was made on echocardiography. In retrospect the unusually oxygenated venous gas was consistent with pulmonary venous return draining directly to the hepatic venous system. This could have provided a vital clue to diagnosis in a situation where an echocardiogram was not available.

We have evaluated the results of patients who had definitively no shunt and who had been catheterized for other reasons. Based on statistical principles we developed formulas to calculate the oxygen saturation of the mixed venous blood. We examined three group of patients: a) Children up to 11 years catheterized during general anaesthesia (58 patients) b) Children up to 11 years catheterized after premedication but without general anaesthesia (53 patients) c) Adults catheterized without general anaesthsia (59 patients) We found that the formulas from the patients who had been catheterized during general anaesthesia were quite different from those without anaesthesia. In the patients without an anaesthesia the superior vena cava was coupled with a much higher factor than the inferior vena cava; in patients with anaesthesia, the contribution of the inferior vena cava was stronger. The age of the patients had no significant influence on our formulas."

Anecdotal reports in early 2012 suggested that some Georgia hospitals had begun screening for CCHD using pulse oximetry. To better understand the prevalence of routine CCHD screening, specific practices among screening hospitals, and barriers to screening among all birthing hospitals in the state, CDC and the Georgia Department of Public Health (DPH) conducted two surveys of Georgia hospitals in June 2012. Eleven pulse oximetry screenings at five hospitals also were observed to estimate screening time. The initial survey was sent to 89 birthing hospitals, among which 71 (80%) responded; 22 (31%) reported currently screening for CCHD and 20 (28%) planned to start in 2012. Barriers to screening included lack of a clear follow-up protocol for positive screening tests, uncertainty about reporting screening results to public health organizations, and cost concerns. Sixteen (73%) currently screening hospitals responded to the second survey. Only one third of screening hospitals followed the CCHD screening protocol endorsed by the American Academy of Pediatrics; the remaining hospitals screened at different times or had different criteria for a positive screen. Screening time averaged 10 minutes per newborn. In the absence of a state mandate, routine screening has begun in many Georgia hospitals. Use of a standardized screening protocol for CCHD could reduce current variation in screening practices among Georgia hospitals. Working agreements between hospitals also are needed to ensure access to echocardiography and follow-up of newborns with possible CCHD."

In January 2012, CDC responded to a request from the New Jersey Department of Health (NJDOH) to assist with an assessment of the implementation. Out of the 52 birthing facilities in New Jersey, a sample of 11 was selected. Staff interviews were conducted to assess screening and data collection processes, data flow and tracking procedures, electronic medical record (EMR) capabilities, and capacity to report data to NJDOH. Feedback also was obtained about the questionnaire being used to follow-up on positive screening results. All 11 facilities were screening for CCHD. Among the 11 facilities, three were electronically entering and maintaining data into an EMR, five were manually entering and maintaining data into paper charts and logs, and three were both electronically and manually entering and maintaining data. Facilities reported that implementation of newly mandated CCHD screening posed a low burden to hospital staff members. NJDOH receives aggregate pulse oximetry screening data from all New Jersey birthing facilities. During the first 3 months of screening, preliminary data indicated that 98.2% of 25,214 newborns were screened. Hospitals reported data on 12 newborns with positive screening results; two newborns were newly diagnosed with CCHD as a result of pulse oximetry screening. Because of state-specific factors, such as out-of-state referral patterns, these findings might underestimate the anticipated number of positive screens in states with varying referral patterns and use of prenatal diagnosis. Rapid implementation of universal CCHD screening posed a relatively low burden to hospitals in New Jersey."

Serial angiographic and hemodynamic examinations before and 17.6 +/- 1.6 months after bidirectional Glenn procedures were compared. At the follow-up study there was no significant change in diameter of the pulmonary artery ipsilateral to the bidirectional Glenn shunt, however, a significant decrease was noted in the diameter of the pulmonary artery contralateral to the bidirectional Glenn shunt (p = 0.04). There was also a 32% decrease in the Nakata index of total cross-sectional pulmonary artery area after the bidirectional Glenn procedure (p = 0.004). Total pulmonary blood flow and mean pulmonary artery pressure had decreased, and arterial oxygen saturation had increased at follow-up. These changes, however, did not correlate with the observed changes in pulmonary artery size. By linear regression analysis, a significant relationship was identified between the Nakata index before the bidirectional Glenn procedure and the absolute change in Nakata index (r = 0.83). A significant decrease in Nakata index occurred only in patients with a bidirectional Glenn shunt in place more than 15 months.

In this study, 39 patients (age 2 months to 12 years, mean 2.1 years) underwent an echocardiographic examination within 1 month of Qp:Qs shunt flow determination by oximetry at catheterization. Qp:Qs was determined by 4 methods that utilized: (1) velocity time integrals and luminal areas to estimate volume flow of the pulmonary artery and aorta; (2) the square of the ratios of pulmonary artery to aorta, multiplied by the ratio of pulmonary to aortic peak flow velocities; (3) inclusion of mitral and tricuspid valve volume flow to pulmonary and aortic volume flow; and (4) ventricular septal defect (VSD) diameter and velocity time integral to calculate left-to-right shunt, which, when added to aortic volume flow (Qs), can be used to estimate Qp. Each of the first 3 methods was statistically correlated to the oximetry Qp:Qs, with r values ranging from 0.54 to 0.66 (p < 0.001). However, the fourth method, based on direct computation of flow across the VSD, had the best correlation to catheterization data (r = 0.82), and further improved when 7 patients with a large VSD (> 9 mm/m2), all of whom had bidirectional shunting, were removed (r = 0.90). Thus, we concluded that this latter method demonstrated the best correlation to catheterization-derived shunt flow data, and because this method is somewhat less labor-intensive than the others, should provide clinically useful data well suited for serial evaluation in infants and children with VSD."

QRAC shunt quantitation was possible without DA in 70% of the cases and with DA in 95%. Among 21 patients with prolonged bolus injections, quantitation of the shunt was possible in 52% of the cases without DA an in all cases with DA. Correlation between oximetry and QRAC with DA was better than between oximetry and QRAC without DA. It is concluded that QRAC with DA is a more reliable, noninvasive means for detection and quantitation of left-to-right cardiac shunts than QRAC without DA."

CD011912,0,1699686,0,Bidirectional cavopulmonary anastomosis as interim palliation for high-risk Fontan candidates. Early results.,"Thirty-eight patients considered to be at increased risk for a Fontan repair underwent bidirectional cavopulmonary anastomosis. Twenty-one of the 38 had concurrent pulmonary artery reconstruction. Fontan risk factors included pulmonary artery distortion, elevated pulmonary artery resistance (greater than 2 Woods units) and/or pulmonary artery pressure (mean, greater than 18 mm Hg), atrioventricular valve regurgitation, systemic ventricular dysfunction, complex venous anatomy, and subaortic obstruction. There were no deaths, either early or late. Median arterial oxygen saturation increased from 79% to 84% (p less than 0.01). Median hospital stay was 8 days. No patient had pleural effusions after 7 days. Three patients had significant surgical complications. Five patients had inadequate relief of cyanosis; three of these had venous collaterals and two had severe ventricular dysfunction; the latter two patients subsequently had strokes. One of the patients with persistent cyanosis required a systemic-to-pulmonary artery shunt. We conclude that a bidirectional cavopulmonary shunt, with pulmonary artery reconstruction when indicated, provides adequate relief of cyanosis in most patients with single-ventricle lesions who are considered to be at increased risk for a Fontan repair. Relief of ventricular volume overload and pulmonary artery distortion may improve Fontan candidacy. Also, patients with persistent cyanosis after bidirectional cavopulmonary anastomosis should be catheterized for location and occlusion of venous collaterals. Further follow-up is necessary to determine the place of bidirectional cavopulmonary anastomosis in the management of patients at increased risk for a Fontan repair."
CD011912,0,7371127,0,Left ventricular function after repair of tetralogy of fallot and its relationship to age at surgery.,"Left ventricular (LV) work-function curves were used to assess LV performance in eight postoperative tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) patients who underwent repair before 2 years of age (group 1) and 12 patients who underwent repair after 2 years of age (group 2). All patients were without significant residual shunts or pulmonary stenosis. Results were compared with those in seven control patients. Left- and right-heart hemodynamics were measured at various levels of afterload induced by methoxamine while heart rate was maintained constant. Cardiac output was serially measured. The slope (m) for each patient's LV end-diastolic pressure (EDP) vs LV minute-work index (MWI) relationship was determined. There were no significant differences in resting cardiac index, LV systolic pressure, LVEDP, aortic oxygen saturation or MWI among the groups. However, with afterload stress, group 2 patients had abnormal work-function curves with depressed slopes (m = 0.21 +/- 0.04) compared with the values for group 1 patients (m = 0.89 +/- 0.13, p less than 0.001) or the control group (m = 1.13 +/- 0.12, p less than 0.001). Thus, LV dysfunction unmasked by an afterload stress was present in the older TOF patients but not in the patients repaired during infancy. These findings raise the possibility that early, definitive repair of TOF may help preserve postoperative LV function."

The infants were between 27-33 weeks gestational age at birth, and were free of congenital defects. Infants were videotaped during parent visits on up to three separate occasions during the first month of life. Parents were encouraged to interact with their infants as they usually would, and data on the infants' heart rates and O2 saturation levels were recorded every 6 seconds on a portable computer that was interfaced with the infants' monitors. Mean O2 saturation levels were significantly lower during parent touch than during baseline periods on 45% of the visits, and significantly higher during parent touch periods on 19% of the visits. O2 saturation variability was greater during periods of parent touch, and there were more abnormal O2 saturation values during parent touch than during baseline periods. Mean heart rates during parent touch were significantly lower compared to baseline on 17% of the visits, and were higher during parent touch on 43% of the visits. There were no overall differences in mean heart rates between baseline, parent touch and post-visit classifications, although heart rate variability was greater during periods of parent touch. The results indicate that preterm infants' responses to early parent touch are variable, and suggest that blanket policies that limit parent touch during the early weeks of life may not be appropriate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD011912,0,9002304,0,Left and right ventricular volume characteristics in tetralogy of Fallot and their relationship to arterial oxygen saturation and age.,"Left (LV) and right ventricular (RV) volume characteristics in 43 patients with tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) undergoing no prior surgical intervention, aged 3-50 months, were evaluated. The control group consisted of 45 patients with Kawasaki disease without cardiac lesions, aged 12-82 months. The TOF patients were divided into four groups: those having arterial oxygen saturation < 80% with an age at the time of study < 18 months (group 1a) or with that > or = 18 months (group 1b), and those with arterial oxygen saturation > or = 80% with an age < 18 months (group 2a) or with that > or = 18 months (group 2b). The results were compared with those in control subjects. In group 1a, each of LV end-diastolic volume (EDV), LV ejection fraction (EF), RVEDV and RVEF was reduced. In group 1b, LVEDV, LVEF and RVEF were decreased. In groups 2a and 2b, RVEF alone was depressed. From these results, the severity of hypoxemia was an important risk factor for ventricular dysfunctions. No influence of age on the volume characteristics was found. The investigations suggested that patients with TOF having an arterial oxygen saturation < 80% are probably candidates for early surgical intervention."

The objectives of this study were to examine the efficacy of the current screening protocol in a NICU setting and to determine the impact of a unit protocol on the use of POS. Charts of 250 infants previous (group 1) and 250 infants after (group 2) the protocol implementation were reviewed. The results of screening test and preductal and postductal SpO₂ were recorded for screened infants. A predischarge SpO₂ value was recorded if screening was not performed. No infant in group 1 had POS. All eligible infants in group 2 received screening and passed. Preductal and postductal oxygen saturations in preterm infants at discharge were similar to saturations in late preterm and term infants. These results show that oxygen saturations at discharge in late preterm and term infants requiring admission to the NICU are similar to infants with no morbidities and that the current POS protocol can be safely used for these infants at discharge from the NICU. This study also confirms that preductal and postductal oxygen saturations at discharge in preterm infants are not different from those in late preterm and term infants. A unit protocol is likely to be more effective than relying on individual providers to ensure that all infants undergo POS for detection of CCHD."

CD011912,0,7785753,0,[Anesthesia for heart transplantation in newborn and suckling infants. Special aspects of the hypoplastic left heart syndrome].,"Paediatric cardiac transplantation (pHTX) has gained widespread acceptance as a therapy in end-stage myocardial failure and some forms of congenital heart disease, particularly hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS). The major problems to the anaesthesiologist in these patients are induction of anaesthesia in infants with HLHS and treatment of pulmonary hypertension in the early post-bypass period. PATIENTS AND METHODS. Anaesthesia for pHTX was performed in 15 children < 1 year of age (4-237 days); 12 suffered from HLHS, 2 from endocardial fibroelastosis, and 1 from dilatative cardiomyopathy. Induction of anaesthesia in patients with HLHS IS a challenge to the anaesthesiologist, as he has to maintain the delicate balance between pulmonary and systemic blood flow. Anaesthesia was induced with fentanyl (10-15 micrograms/kg) and pancuronium (0.2-0.4 mg/kg) and maintained with fentanyl (total dosage 70-100 micrograms/kg). Modification of ventilatory parameters such as FiO2, PaCO2, and airway pressure (PEEP, I:E ratio) was used to influence systemic and pulmonary blood distribution in the pre-bypass period according to changes in haemodynamics (target: O2 saturation approximately 75%-80%, PaCO2 45-50 mmHg). Treatment of pulmonary hypertension in the weaning and early post-bypass period consisted of respiratory (PaCO2 < 30 mmHg) and metabolic alkalinisation (pH 7.45-7.55, BE > +3 mmol/l), the use of prostaglandin E1 (3-6-12 micrograms/kg.h), and the phosphodiesterase inhibitor enoximone (10-15 micrograms/kg.min). Additional positive inotropic support was achieved with dobutamine (5-10 micrograms/kg.min), adrenaline (0.1-0.5 micrograms/kg.min), and/or orciprenaline (0.1-0.2 micrograms/kg.min) and calcium chloride (25-100 mg/kg). RESULTS. Two children died intraoperatively and 1 on the 1st postoperative day from overwhelming pulmonary vascular resistance and right ventricular failure. Three children died between 3 and 4 weeks postoperatively, 1 from cytomegalovirus infection, 1 from sepsis, and 1 from acute rejection. Nine patients survived and are well up to 5.5 years after transplantation. CONCLUSION. Pulmonary hypertension in the weaning and early post-bypass period is the main anaesthesiological problem of pHTX, particularly in children with HLHS. A polypragmatic approach to this problem consisting of alkalinisation, pulmonary vasodilatation, and inotropic support is presented and seems to be effective. Further improvements in concepts of pHTX are limited by the lack of donor organs. Though the experience with pHTX in neonates and infants is growing slowly, it might be a routine procedure from the anaesthesiological point of view within a few years in some selected centres."

The indication for valvuloplasty was cyanotic heart defect not amenable to total surgical correction at the age and size at presentation but at the same time requiring palliation of pulmonary oligemia. After balloon valvuloplasty, there was an increase in the pulmonary blood flow index (1.83 +/- 0.55 to 3.14 +/- 1.38 L/min/m2; p less than 0.05), pulmonary-to-systemic flow ratio (0.55 +/- 0.35 to 1.19 +/- 0.63; p less than 0.05), and pulmonary artery pressure (15.5 +/- 6.6 to 29.1 +/- 12.1 mm Hg; p less than 0.02). Arterial oxygen saturation, although increased from 69.6 +/- 11.5% to 81.4 +/- 12.3%, did not attain statistical significance (p greater than 0.05). Immediate surgical intervention was avoided in all eight patients. At follow-up, 4 to 12 months after balloon valvuloplasty, all infants were thriving with decreased hypoxemia and polycythemia. Follow-up catheterization data were available from six patients, 3 to 10 months after valvuloplasty, and in all of them the immediate postballoon valvuloplasty improvement persisted or further improvement noted. These data suggest that pulmonary valvuloplasty offers excellent palliation of pulmonary oligemia in cyanotic heart defects, thus avoiding the risks of immediate surgical palliation and paving the way for a better result of eventual total surgical correction."

The gestational ages ranged from 25 to 36 wk (mean 30), and the birth weights ranged from 760 to 2010 g (mean 1274). The patients were divided into two groups on the basis of the indications for assisted ventilation. Group I consisted of 21 patients with severe hylanine membrane disease who required assisted ventilation during the first 2 days of life and could not be weaned off the respiratory by 10 days of age. Group II was composed of nine infants who required intermittent positive-pressure breathing after a mean age of 8 days because of repeated apneic spells secondary to uncontrollable heart failure. All infants in Group II survived the operation and left the hospital well. Fourteen of the 21 patients in Group I survived; the seven deaths were all due to underlying severe pulmonary disease (bronchopulmonary dysplasia). The value of PDA ligation in premature infants with uncontrollable heart failure is demonstrated in this study; this procedure also appears to be beneficial in neonates with severe respiratory distress syndrome."

CD011912,0,447189,0,Haemodynamics studies in patients with univentricular hearts.,"The catheterization data including angiocardiography of 30 infants and children with different types of univentricular heart were used to study the influence of pulmonary and systemic flow as well as the position of the outlet chamber on systemic arterial saturation. All patients with normally connected great arteries displayed favourable streaming and differed significantly from those with 1-TGA as well as d-TGA, who showed varying streaming characteristics. Taking into account, however, the position of the outlet chamber, favourable streaming could be demonstrated to occur in most patients with TGA and lateral outlet chamber, and significantly less in patients with TGA and anterior outlet chamber. The influence of pulmonary and systemic flow on systemic arterial oxygen saturation was obvious only in the group with complete mixing and not in those patients, where arterial saturation was affected favourably or unfavourably by interindividual streaming differences. As expected, in patients with pulmonary stenosis the pulmonary flow was determined primarily by the degree of obstruction between ventricle and pulmonary artery. Reduced perfusion of the lungs in pulmonary stenosis does not result in increased perfusion of the systemic circulation. These results indicate that in patients with univentricular heart and ventriculo-arterial discordance, a pulmonary stenosis combined with lateral outlet chamber offers the most favourable outlook with regard to natural history."
CD011912,0,7948797,0,Effect of preanesthetic medication on carbon dioxide tension in children with congenital heart disease.,"Hypercarbia during the postoperative period following repair of congenital heart defects in children has been associated with acute pulmonary hypertension. Because decreases in respiratory rate (RR) and digital pulse oximetry (SpO2) have been observed after preanesthetic medication of similar children, it is possible that hypercarbia and pulmonary hypertension may be unappreciated risks in premedicated children during the preoperative period. As the first step in addressing this question, changes in transcutaneous and end-tidal PCO2 (PtcCO2 and PetCO2) were examined after preanesthetic medication of children prior to cardiac surgery. Forty-four children were randomly assigned to receive either intramuscular morphine, 0.2 mg/kg, and scopolamine, 0.01 mg/kg, or oral midazolam, 0.75 mg/kg, 1 hour before anesthetic induction. PtcCO2, PetCO2, SpO2, RR, and sedation score were monitored. Significant sedation occurred after both premedication regimens. Following morphine/scopolamine, PtcCO2 increased from 36 +/- 4 (mean +/- SD) to 43 +/- 6 mmHg (P < 0.01), PetCO2 increased from 35 +/- 3 to 40 +/- 5 mmHg (P < 0.01), SpO2 decreased from 93 +/- 2 to 91 +/- 4% (P < 0.01), and RR decreased from 30 +/- 10 to 24 +/- 7 breaths/minute (P < 0.01). After midazolam, PtcCO2 increased from 35 +/- 4 to 40 +/- 6 mmHg (P < 0.01), PetCO2 increased from 34 +/- 5 to 39 +/- 3 mmHg (P < 0.01), SpO2 decreased from 93 +/- 6 to 90 +/- 7% (P < 0.01), and RR decreased from 33 +/- 13 to 30 +/- 13 breaths/minute (P < 0.01).

CD011912,0,2475072,0,Stage I palliation of hypoplastic left heart syndrome: the importance of neoaorta construction.,"After Norwood's initial report of successful first-stage palliation of hypoplastic left heart syndrome in neonates, the occurrence of distal aortic obstructions, shunt problems, and late deaths have led to modifications in the surgical technique. Between January 1986 and December 1987, 12 neonates from three to 16 days old underwent stage I palliation with the same objectives. An open atrial septectomy was always performed. The pulmonary artery bifurcation was transected from the main pulmonary artery and closed with an aortic homograft patch. The aortotomy was begun 2 cm below the patent ductus arteriosus insertion and extended across the transverse arch and down the ascending aorta. The neoaorta was constructed using the hypoplastic ascending aorta-transverse aortic arch, the main pulmonary artery, and an aortic homograft augmentation patch. The homograft is hemostatic and pliable, and molds well in forming the neoaorta. A 4-mm shunt was inserted between the right innominate artery and the right pulmonary artery in 5 patients and the neoaorta and the pulmonary artery bifurcation patch in 7 patients. The early systemic oxygen saturation was optimized at 75% to 80% with hyperventilation, high concentration of inspired oxygen, sodium bicarbonate, and the frequent use of vasopressors to maintain an arterial blood pressure of 65 to 75 mm Hg. Two patients (17%) died early after operation; 1 had severe right ventricular dysfunction and both had severe tricuspid regurgitation. There were 2 late deaths at 7 and 13 months, of sepsis and hypoxia. The 8 survivors (67%) continue to do well over follow-up.

However, the effects of this condition on the liver are poorly described. Between April 2005 and April 2010, 25 adults with cyanotic congenital heart disease were studied to determine clinical history, liver ultrasonographic data, and liver histological presentation. Twenty-five patients, with a median age of 28.7 ± 8.3 years and a basal tissue hemoglobin oxygen saturation of 83.3% ± 6.8%, were studied. Liver ultrasonographic examination showed abnormalities in 10 of 20 patients (50%): 6 patients (30%) had hepatomegaly, 2 patients (10%) heterogeneous parenchyma echo pattern, and 2 patients (10%) increased portal echogenicity. Ascites was found in 7 patients (28%): 4 patients had refractory ascites and 3 patients anasarca. Patients with anasarca responded well to oral and intravenous furosemide, but those with isolated ascites did not. No data to indicate severe ventricular dysfunction or severe valve regurgitation were seen. In patients with refractory ascites who had therapeutic paracentesis, serum-ascites albumin gradient in ascites was greater than 1.1 g/dL. No significant association was found between patients with or without ascites when laboratory data and New York Heart Association functional class were compared. Liver biopsy was performed in 6 patients (24%). The most remarkable liver histological finding, in those with refractory ascites, was the existence of periportal fibrosis associated with sinusoidal dilatation. Periportal liver fibrosis associated with congestive heart failure, sepsis, or a long-term Fontan procedure can trigger refractory ascites formation."

The patients with tricuspid atresia had a significantly depressed ejection fraction. Those who had a surgical shunt or who had had pulmonary artery banding had significantly lower ejection fractions than the remainder. There was no significant correlation between the ejection fraction and age, the arterial oxygen saturation, or the haemoglobin concentration.

CD011912,0,3863568,0,Pulmonary valvotomy under normothermic caval inflow occlusion.,"Pulmonary valve stenosis may require urgent surgical relief in infancy or elective valvotomy in childhood. A retrospective study has been made of 94 children who underwent pulmonary valvotomy for pulmonary valve stenosis between 1972 and 1983 using the technique of normothermic caval inflow occlusion. There were no early deaths nor late deaths. The group included 13 neonates less than 1 week old and 14 other infants under 1 year of age. The mean follow-up is 45 months. No child has had a second valvotomy for recurrent valvar stenosis. Two children have required re-operation for placement of a transannular right ventricular outflow patch for hypoplastic pulmonary annulus. Neonates who present early with critical pulmonary valve stenosis may remain moderately to severely cyanosed for several days after a satisfactory valvotomy but this is almost invariably followed by a progressive increase in oxygen saturation to an acceptable level. One neonate, who had a Blalock-Taussig shunt at 2 weeks of age for persistent postvalvotomy cyanosis, had the shunt ligated at 2 years. Pulmonary valvotomy under normothermic caval inflow occlusion is a safe, cost-effective technique which provides excellent early and late haemodynamic results. This operation sets a standard against which the newly introduced technique of percutaneous balloon pulmonary valvotomy should be assessed."

The therapy was considered effective in 36 (76.5%) patients, evaluated by clinical improvement, increase of arterial oxygen saturation greater than 15 vol. O2% and increased ductus diameter measured by echocardiographic study. In the correlation between the therapeutic result and the patient age, the greatest elevation of arterial oxygen saturation occurred until 21 days of age, especially up to 7 days of age where the elevation in this period was of 24.5 vol. O2%. The cardiac defects that best responded to PGE1 were pulmonary atresia with or without ventricular septal defect, Ebstein's anomaly, tricuspid atresia, pulmonic stenosis, double outlet right ventricle, and those that the arterial oxygen saturation increase was less than 10 vol. O2% such as the hypoplastic left heart syndrome, tetralogy of Fallot and transposition of the great arteries. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Continuous cardiovascular (HR, heart rate variability [HR-SD], BP, blood pressure variability [BP-SD], and oxygen saturation) and ventilatory (minute volume, airway pressure, and effective compliance) measurements were made on-line, using a computerized whole-body plethysmograph-incubator (Vital-trends, VT1000), in nine ventilated infants with CDH. Data collection commenced at birth and continued until surgery. Minute mean values for each variable were recorded. Hourly means were computed from the minute means, averaged across infants each hour over the first 50 hours of life, and regressed against postnatal age. Results showed a significant increase in BP (P < .01), BP-SD (P < .05), HR-SD (P < .04), and pH (P < .02) versus postnatal age, and a decrease in PaCO2 (P < .04), FIO2 (P < .001), Alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient (P < .003), and oxygenation index (P < .002). Infants with CDH show cardiopulmonary trends over the first 2 days of life that are qualitatively similar to those of normal newborn infants. Deviation from these idealized patterns may identify an infant who is not responding satisfactorily to the given therapy and who may require alternative treatment modalities."
CD011912,0,23286888,0,[Cerebral near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) in paediatric anaesthesia].,"Cerebral oximetry allows continuous real-time and non-invasive monitoring of cerebral oxygen saturation (cSO(2)), by measuring oxyhaemoglobin and deoxyhaemoglobin near infrared light absorption, similarly to pulse oximetry. cSO(2) measurement predominantly reflects brain venous compartment, and is correlated with jugular venous saturation. As jugular venous saturation, cSO(2) must therefore be interpreted as a measure of balance between transport and consumption of O(2) in the brain. Cerebral oximetry should be used as a trend monitoring, because its accuracy is insufficient to be considered as reliable measure of absolute value of ScO(2). In adult, correction of intraoperative cerebral desaturation reduces hospital stay, heavy morbidity and mortality, and serious postoperative neurocognitive impairment after cardiac and major abdominal surgery. In children, the occurrence of intra- and postoperative cerebral desaturations during congenital heart surgery is associated with increased neurological morbi-mortality. Cerebral oximetry could be a useful monitoring during anaesthesia of (ex) preterm neonates, due to the risk of impaired cerebral blood flow autoregulation in these patients."
CD011912,0,8501565,0,Congenital diaphragmatic hernia: long-term outcome in neonates treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.,"As more infants with congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) survive with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), it seems prudent to detail the longterm outcome in these medically complex infants. Eighteen children with CDH-treated with postoperative ECMO were recruited for participation in this study. The mean duration of ECMO was 193 hours (range 82 to 493 hours), mean time to extubation after ECMO was 142 hours (range 34 to 312 hours), and median duration of hospitalization was 46 days (range 30 to 181 days). Of the 18 infants, 4 (22%) were discharged home requiring oxygen therapy. At follow-up the notable findings were a high incidence of gastroesophageal reflux and failure to thrive. At both 1 and 2 years of age, 50% of infants were at less than the 5th percentile for weight. At 1 and 2 years of age, 39% and 21%, respectively, were at less than the 5th percentile for weight/length ratio. A total of 16 children (89%) had clinical evidence of reflux, and 8 (44%) were discharged home on a regimen of nasogastric feedings. Reherniation occurred in 4 children (22%) and was more frequent when a patch was used. An electrocardiogram showed right ventricular hypertrophy in 6 (43%); oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry was > 95% in all children, and pulmonary artery pressure was estimated by Doppler echocardiography to be normal in 12 of 14 children examined. The neurodevelopmental outcome (Bayley Scales or Stanford-Binet scale) at 1 to 4 years of age was not dissimilar from that of other ECMO-treated children. Given the severity of illness in the neonatal period, the general health and development of children with CDH surviving after ECMO are good. Surprisingly few children have long-term respiratory complications related to pulmonary hypoplasia. Follow-up in the first few years should be aimed at aggressive nutritional intervention to prevent the growth failure that appears to be prevalent in these children."

A total of 12 infants had chronic lung disease of prematurity or congenital heart disease. Infants in whom oxygen supplementation could not be discontinued for at least 5 min were excluded. A severity score was assigned for each of four categories (respiratory rate, retractions, wheeze, and general appearance). A total for each patient was obtained by summing the score for each category. Oxygen saturation was measured using a Nellcor oximeter. Agreement beyond chance was measured using the kappa statistic. The relationship between observers for total score and oximetry and the mean total score and mean oximetry value for each patient was expressed as a Pearson correlation coefficient. A total of 56 infants and children were studied: 2 had pneumonia, 11 had an exacerbation of pulmonary signs and symptoms with their underlying cardiac or pulmonary disease, and 43 had bronchiolitis. Kappa was 0.48 for general assessment, 0.38 for respiratory rate, 0.31 for wheeze, and 0.25 for retractions. All values were statistically significantly greater than 0 at p less than 0.01. Correlations for total score and for oximetry were 0.68 and 0.88, respectively. The median difference between oximetry readings was 1. The correlation coefficient between total score and oximetry was -0.04.

Although this cardiac dysfunction usually disappears without any after-effects, inotropic treatment is mandatory for a short time. There, however, is no easy way to monitor cardiac output in these small patients. Neither is there much universally recognized objective data available to help choose between these drugs available or between different protocols. Physiologically, infants are not small adults. In the neonatal period, the heart works virtually at its maximum, with little reserve : the stroke volume has a limited capacity to increase because of poor compliance, and the heart rate is high. Cardiac output is therefore rate dependent. To improve therapeutic adjustment, an attempt is made to rationalize the use of inotropic drugs in the postoperative period. Cardiac dysfunction can frequently be recognized already in theatre. It is of paramount importance to exclude faulty surgical repair by measuring the pressures and oxygen saturation in all the cardiac chambers and vessels. The severity of haemodynamic impairment will then have to be defined. As well as the usual clinical criteria (blood pressure, diuresis), the trend in the capnographic curve during a reduction of extracorporeal blood flow rate and acid-base measurements are most helpful. If no further immediate surgery is found to be necessary, the most serious cases are treated by cardiopulmonary support (right to left, or cardiac left to left, or exceptionally biventricular), usually for 1 to 3 h.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Tetralogy of Fallot is a congenital heart defect that is frequently associated with anomalies of the aortic arch and its branches. The association is even more common in patients with chromosome 22q11 deletion. We present the case of an 18-day-old male infant who had cyanosis and a heart murmur. After an initial echocardiographic evaluation, the patient was diagnosed with tetralogy of Fallot and right-sided aortic arch. The pulmonary annulus and the main pulmonary artery and its branches were slightly hypoplastic; the ductus arteriosus was small. Conventional and computed tomographic angiograms revealed a double aortic arch and an aberrant left subclavian artery. The right aortic arch branched into the subclavian arteries and continued into the descending aorta, whereas the left aortic arch branched into the common carotid arteries and ended with the patent ductus arteriosus. After evaluation of the ductal anatomy, we implanted a 3.5 × 15-mm coronary stent in the duct.

Of the 73 patients followed up 2 years after correction, 23 had experienced accelerated development in both weight and height, but 11 patients remained on or below the 3rd centile for weight and height. In terms of the age at shunting, the oxygen saturation immediately before total correction, the age at total correction, the number of ventriculotomy patch repairs, and the post-correction ventricular pressure ratios, no significant difference could be detected between those 23 patients who had undergone accelerated development and those 11 who had remained retarded.

Chronic hypoxemia has been suggested as the cause of poor growth in these patients, but the relationship between serum IGF-I levels and chronic hypoxemia is unclear. Serum IGF-I concentrations, oxygen saturation and nutritional status were evaluated in 29 patients with cyanotic congenital heart disease, and serum IGF-I levels were compared with a group of 20 well-nourished, age-matched control children to assess the relationship between IGF-I levels and chronic hypoxemia. The nutritional status of each patient was determined by using anthropometric parameters and calorie and protein intake ratios. The patients were divided into malnourished and well-nourished groups (21 and 8 patients, respectively) according to their nutritional status. Serum IGF-I concentrations were measured in the two patient groups and the controls. The malnourished group had the lowest IGF-I levels (48.14 +/- 21.8 ng/ml, p<0.05). However, the well-nourished group's IGF-I levels were significantly lower than the control subjects' despite improved nutritional status (85.5 +/- 30.2 and 107 +/- 19.7 ng/ml, respectively, p<0.05). In addition, we found a positive correlation between serum IGF-I levels and oxygen saturation of the patients (r=0.402, p<0.05). These findings indicate that chronic hypoxemia has a direct or indirect effect to reduce serum IGF-I concentrations and this may be a cause of the increased growth failure in patients with cyanotic congenital heart disease."

At catheterization, 30 were on prostaglandin (PGE1) therapy and 20 were intubated. The valve was successfully crossed and dilated in 34/36 (94%), including three with an echocardiographic diagnosis of valvar pulmonary atresia and a right ventricle of adequate size. The valve was first dilated with a 2- to 5-mm balloon and then with serially larger ones (up to 12 mm) to a final balloon/annulus value of 126%. The RV/systemic pressure value fell from 150 +/- 32 to 83 +/- 30%, O2 saturation rose from 91 +/- 6% to 96 +/- 4%, and PGE1 was discontinued at the end of the procedure. There were 11 complications (31%) including one early death from sepsis and necrotizing enterocolitis, endocarditis in another, two myocardial perforations, one femoral-iliac vein tear, and one transient pulse loss. A repeat BD was carried out in five patients, two of whom subsequently had surgery. At follow-up (33 +/- 23 months), the 31 patients managed by BD alone were well and had echocardiographic gradients of < 30 mm Hg in 90% and pulmonary regurgitation, considered mild in most, in 52%.

Growth failure during this high-risk period is associated with worse outcomes. This study evaluated the growth patterns of patients enrolled in the authors' interstage home-monitoring program (HMP), which uses a multidisciplinary team approach to nutrition management. From 2000 to 2009, 148 infants were enrolled in the HMP after S1P. Families recorded daily weights during the interstage period and alerted the interstage monitoring team about protocol violations of nutritional goals. Interstage monitoring and inpatient data from the S1P hospitalization were reviewed to identify risk factors for poor growth. Growth outcomes were compared with published norms from the Centers for Disease Control. Interstage survival for patients in the HMP was 98 % (145/148). Growth velocity during the interstage period was 26 ± 8 g/day. The weight-for-age z-scores decreased from birth to discharge after S1P (-0.4 ± 0.9 to -1.3 ± 0.9; p < 0.001) but then increased during the interstage period to the time of S2P (-0.9 ± 1; p < 0.001). The factors associated with improved growth during the interstage period included male gender, greater birth weight, full oral feeding at S1P discharge, and a later birth era. After S1P, infants enrolled in an HMP experienced normal growth velocity during the interstage period. Daily observation of oxygen saturation, weight change, and enteral intake together with implementation of a multidisciplinary feeding protocol is associated with excellent interstage growth and survival."

In this study, NTG and SNP were infused in the operating room to increase venous capacitance, reduce systemic and pulmonary afterload, facilitate weaning off cardiopulmonary bypass, stabilize hemodynamics for transport to the intensive care unit (ICU), and reduce the fluid resuscitation needed upon arrival in the ICU. Because of the risk for accumulation of methemoglobin (MetHb) and cyanmethemoglobin (cyan-MetHb) during prolonged continuous infusion of NTG and SNP, it was decided to (1) quantify ICU use, (2) measure % MetHb at 12-hour intervals, and (3) look indirectly for the accumulation of cyan-MetHb by comparing simultaneous pulse oximetry (SpO2) (Nellcor N-100 [Nellcor, Haywood, CO]) and CO-oximetry (SaO2) (Corning 270 [Corning, Medfield, MA]). A total of 69 arterial samples were obtained from 16 infants (median age 4.4 months) following cardiac surgery with bypass. Median doses of NTG, 6.0 mg/kg (range 0.7 to 27.5), and SNP, 3.3 mg/kg (range 0.6 to 33.4), were infused over a median of 64.5 hours (range 12 to 183) (N = 16 patients).

CD011912,0,7880992,0,Oxygen consumption following pediatric cardiac surgery.,"Metabolic responses during recovery from cardiac operations for various congenital heart defects were studied in 30 mechanically ventilated pediatric patients in two groups: infants 1 year or less (group I) and children more than 1 year old (group II). Oxygen consumption (VO2) and carbon dioxide production (VCO2) were measured using a pediatric metabolic monitor intermittently after induction of anesthesia, after skin closure, 2 to 4 hours postoperatively, and on the first postoperative morning in the pediatric intensive care unit. Energy expenditure and respiratory quotient were determined from respiratory gas measurements. Rectal and skin temperatures and hemodynamic variables were recorded at the same time. VO2 increased during rewarming 2 to 4 hours after the operation by 12 +/- 15% in group I and by 24 +/- 19% in group II, while rectal temperature increased by 2.0 +/- 1.2 degrees C and 1.8 +/- 1.4 degrees C, respectively. No further increase in VO2 occurred until the first postoperative morning. A hypermetabolic response was not seen in all cases despite marked thermal changes. High-dose fentanyl anesthesia partly explains the low responses. On the other hand, low cardiac output may also compromise oxygen supply. Sixty-three percent of infants were treated for cardiac failure before surgery and 75% needed inotropic support immediately after the operation. Low central venous oxyhemoglobin saturation values (ScvO2 < 60%) were observed during rewarming, indicating an increase in oxygen extraction secondary to an increased oxygen demand in the brain during recovery from anesthesia, and a low cardiac output or delayed restoration of cerebral blood flow after CPB and deep hypothermia."

Whereas an increased hematocrit was seen only at a difference in arteriovenous oxygen saturation of more than 30%, or a central venous saturation below 65%, a close correlation between 2,3-DPG concentration in erythrocytes and these parameters was obtained already in the normal range (r = 0.79, and r = 0.78, respectively). A relatively close correlation was also found between 2,3-DPG concentration and half-maximal oxygen saturation pressure (T50 value; r equals 0.73), and the T50 values and the central venous oxygen saturation (r equals 0.61), respectively. Because of the shift to the right of the O2-binding curve the functional oxygen transport capacity was increased by an average 15% in children with acyanotic heart defects (mean T50 value of 31.6 mm Hg), and by 40% in children with cyanotic heart defects (mean T50 value of 34.6 mm Hg), as compared to healthy children (mean T50 value of 28.1 mm Hg). A marked influence on the position of the O2-binding curve and hence on oxygen release of the blood in the periphery is therefore exerted by the 2,3-DPG concentration, whose effect was about twice that of the Bohr effect in the pH range measured."

Recently, reports have been published that associate preoperative brain injury in neonates with transposition of the great arteries with the performance of balloon atrial septostomy (BAS), a procedure that improves systemic oxygenation preoperatively. It is unclear whether BAS is the cause of brain injury or is a confounder, because neonates who require BAS are typically more hypoxemic. We sought to determine the relationship between preoperative brain injury in neonates with transposition of the great arteries and the performance of BAS. We hypothesized that brain injury results from hypoxic injury, not from the BAS itself."

Cardiac catheterization preceding the surgical repair revealed an elevated pulmonary artery pressure of 60/15 mmHg (mean pressure 40 mmHg). Pulmonary flow was 8.4 l/min.m2 and systemic flow was 5.5 l/min.m2. Pulmonary arteriolar resistance was elevated to 4.2 U.m2 with 64% left-right shunt and 25% right-left shunt. Arterial O2-saturation varied around 90%. After surgical repair (insertion of a Goretex patch), the patient required mechanical ventilation with 100% oxygen for adequate oxygenation. Cardiac catheterization was repeated on the first postoperative day. No residual shunts were found. The pulmonary artery pressure was 66/40 mmHg (mean pressure 50 mmHg), systemic arterial pressure was 85/62 mmHg (mean pressure 68 mmHg). Cardiac index was 2.8 l/min.m2, pulmonary vascular resistance was 12 U.m2. After administration of prostacyclin a significant decrease of pulmonary artery pressure was observed, but without changing the ratio between pulmonary and systemic pressure. The AaDO2 varied between 400 and 580 mmHg and the oxygenation-index (PaO2/FiO2) was less than 1.0. In this situation, an attempt with inhaled nitric oxide (NO) was performed. After adding 20 ppm NO to the inspired gas, the AaDO2 decreased significantly from 580 to 270 mmHg and the oxygenation-index (OI) rose from 0.9 to 1.5. The inspired fraction of oxygen could be reduced quickly to 60%. During the next days, the concentration of NO was reduced stepwise to 1 ppm. Finally, the AaDO2 was within the normal range (25-65 mmHg) and the OI rose to a level about 4.0. The FiO2 could be reduced to 30% and nitric oxide therapy could be stopped and the child could be extubated."

Nine case reports (author's transl)].,"Total anomalous pulmonary venous drainage is one of the cardiac malformations requiring early surgical correction. In our series of nine cases, 89% were under three months of age and none above six months. Clinically, two types were present: without obstruction and with obstruction to the pulmonary venous flow. In the non obstructive group, all had mild cyanosis, heart failure, cardiomegaly and systolic murmur. In the obstructive group, they had severe cyanosis, heart failure, small heart and pulmonary fields with a ""ground glass"" or mottled appearance on chest X-ray due to hypertension and edema. The second heart found was split in both groups. An increased right sided O2 saturation and pulmonary hypertension are due to the total anomalous pulmonary venous connection to the right atrium. Right atrium pressures were superior than left atrium pressures in two patients, requiring atrioseptostomy in one patient. Total surgical correction was performed in three patients, with one patient surviving; this patient is well one year after operation. It is noteworthy in our series the early symptomatology.

CD011912,0,22464211,0,Effect of endovascular stenting of right ventricle to pulmonary artery conduit stenosis in infants with hypoplastic left heart syndrome on stage II outcomes.,"There is growing awareness that the Norwood procedure with the Sano modification is prone to early right ventricular to pulmonary artery (RV-PA) conduit stenosis resulting in systemic oxygen desaturation, increased interstage morbidity, and death. We report our experience with endovascular stent placement for conduit stenosis and compare the outcomes at stage II surgery between stented and nonstented infants. The medical records of all patients with hypoplastic left heart syndrome who received an RV-PA conduit at Norwood palliation from May 2005 to January 2010 were reviewed. The preoperative anatomy, demographics, operative variables, and outcomes pertaining to the Norwood and subsequent stage II surgeries were obtained and compared between stented and nonstented infants. The pre- and post-stent oxygen saturation, stenosis location, type and number of stents implanted, concomitant interventions, procedure-related complications, and reinterventions were collected. Of the 66 infants who underwent the Norwood procedure with RV-PA conduit modification, 16 (24%) received stents. The anatomy, demographics, and outcome variables after the Norwood procedure were similar between the stented and nonstented infants. The age at catheterization was 93 ± 48 days, and the weight was 4.9 ± 1.2 kg. The oxygen saturation increased from 66 ± 9% before intervention to 82 ± 6% immediately after stenting (p <0.0001). No interstage surgical shunt revisions were performed in either group. Age, weight, pre-stage II echocardiographic variables, oxygen saturation, and operative and outcome variables, including mortality, were similar between the 2 groups. In conclusion, endovascular stent placement for RV-PA conduit stenosis after the Norwood procedure leads to improved systemic oxygen levels and prevents early performance of stage II surgery without compromising stage II outcomes."

The patient had been already intubated and ventilated on respirator. A echocardiography and cine-angiography demonstrated that the both sides aortic arch had almost identical sizes, originating common carotid arteries and subclavian arteries and PDAs respectively, and the descending aorta located on the left side of the mid-line. At the first surgery, the distal of the right aortic arch was divided just proximal to the descending aorta after complete tissue dissection around the arch. The divided right sided aortic arch was mobilized from posterior to anterior aspect of the bronchus. Then the right subclavian artery was divided and an original Blalock-Taussig shunt was employed. The right sided PDA was ligated. After the first surgery, respiratory dysfunction lasted for weeks mainly because of the PGE1 dependent left sided PDA. At the second surgery, left sided modified Blalock-Taussig shunt was constructed and the left sided PDA was divided. These procedures resulted in stable respiratory status and oxygen saturation.

Between November 1985 and March 1990 this central shunt was employed in 8 children with ages ranged between 4 days and 3 years, and weights between 2 and 12 kg. Diagnosis were Fallot's tetralogy in three; pulmonary atresia with intact septum in three; complete AV canal and Fallot's tetralogy in one, and univentricular heart and pulmonary atresia in 1 patient. There were no surgical deaths. Hospital mortality was present in 1 case (AV canal and Fallotś tetralogy) at the moment of reoperation 1 month later. Follow-up ranged between 2 and 46 months. One case, pulmonary atresia with intact septum, has undergone total correction. The remainder 6 cases are in good situation with O2 saturation above 70%. This central shunt has the advantages to provide a bidirectional blood flow to both pulmonary branches avoiding the risk of direct damage in the pulmonary arteries found with the conventional aorto-pulmonary shunts."

The etiology of these delays is unclear, but abnormal prenatal cerebral maturation and postoperative hemodynamic instability likely play a role. A better understanding of these factors is needed to improve neurodevelopmental outcome. In this study, we used bedside frequency-domain near infrared spectroscopy (FDNIRS) and diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) to assess cerebral hemodynamics and oxygen metabolism in neonates with single-ventricle (SV) CHD undergoing surgery and compared them to controls. Our goals were 1) to compare cerebral hemodynamics between unanesthetized SV and healthy neonates, and 2) to determine if FDNIRS-DCS could detect alterations in cerebral hemodynamics beyond cerebral hemoglobin oxygen saturation (SO 2). Eleven SV neonates were recruited and compared to 13 controls. Preoperatively, SV patients showed decreased cerebral blood flow (CBFi ), cerebral oxygen metabolism (CMRO 2i ) and SO 2; and increased oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) compared to controls. Compared to preoperative values, unstable postoperative SV patients had decreased CMRO 2i and CBFi , which returned to baseline when stable. However, SO 2 showed no difference between unstable and stable states. Preoperative SV neonates are flow-limited and show signs of impaired cerebral development compared to controls. FDNIRS-DCS shows potential to improve assessment of cerebral development and postoperative hemodynamics compared to SO 2 alone."

Median age and mean arterial blood oxygen saturation respectively were 4.2 years and 81% in CHD subjects and 4.8 years and 98% in controls. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) were measured in plasma using enzyme-linked immunoassay. Plasma VEGF levels in controls depended negatively on age (p < 0.0001) until 3 months, when VEGF was no longer elevated. No such age dependence was found for HGF. Although VEGF levels did not differ between CHD and control subjects up to the age of 3 months, VEGF was significantly elevated in CHD patients older than 3 months compared to controls of similar age (149 +/- 106 vs 65 +/- 23 pg/ml, p < 0.0001). Moreover, the VEGF levels were negatively correlated with oxygen saturation (p = 0.03) and positively correlated with hemoglobin (p = 0.004) in CHD patients aged between 3 months and 10 years. Although the physiologic elevation of VEGF in the neonatal period decreases rapidly if oxygen saturation is normal, VEGF elevations persist if systemic hypoxia is present."
CD011912,0,6548430,0,An automated algorithm for radionuclide angiocardiographic quantitation of circulatory shunting.,Circulatory shunting may be quantitated by analysis of time-activity curves obtained from radionuclide angiocardiography. A new automated algorithm for performing this analysis is proposed. The algorithm uses mathematical deconvolution techniques to increase the temporal separation of the components of this curve and thereby improves the accuracy of the analysis. The stability of the algorithm to random data errors was assessed by experiments on simulated time-activity curves degraded with pseudorandom noise. Excellent performance was obtained on a set of test problems previously used in the literature. The algorithm was used to quantitate left-to-right shunting in patients undergoing radionuclide angiocardiography during cardiac catheterization. A strong correlation (r = 0.96) was found between pulmonary to systemic flow ratios (Qp:Qs) obtained using the algorithm on radionuclide angiocardiographic data and Qp:Qs values obtained by oximetry at cardiac catheterization.

The patients showed a significantly higher percentage of apnoeic pauses followed by a hypoxaemic episode (25 vs. 6%, P less than 0.01), and a two-fold increase in the slope of the desaturation curve (8.4 vs. 4.3% per s, P less than 0.005) in periodic compared with non-periodic breathing. All other characteristic of oxygenation (baseline SaO2 before episodes of hypoxaemia, delay between onset of apnoeic pause and onset of desaturation, lowest SaO2 during episodes of hypoxaemia) were similar for periodic and non-periodic breathing patterns. Similar, but not significant, differences between isolated and periodic apnoeic pauses were also present in the controls. An analysis of episodes of bradycardia (less than or equal to 100 beats per minute (bpm] showed that out of 121 episodes in the patients 118 were accompanied by a fall in SaO2 to less than or equal to 80%, and in the remaining three SaO2 fell to 82%, 85% and 86%, respectively. Thus all episodes of bradycardia (less than or equal to 100 bpm) were associated with a fall in SaO2 detected by beat-to-beat pulse oximetry. Examination of hypoxaemic episodes and their relationship with bradycardia and with apnoeic pauses, periodic and non-periodic, may help the further understanding of the control of arterial oxygenation in preterm infants with cyanotic episodes."

PO2, PCO2 and pH (hydrogen ion concentration) were measured continuously via a femoral arterial sensor and compared with 100 simultaneous paired arterial blood-gas measurements. Data were analysed by Bland-Altman analysis for bias and precision. Sensors were placed in 10 children of median age 5.43 (range 0.03-45) months, median weight 3.74 (2.79-15.4) kg and remained in place for up to 27 h after operation. PO2 values were 2.5-8.2 kPa (median 5.3 kPa). Co-oximeter saturation ranged from 37.1% to 90.6% (median 75.8%). Bias and precision values were 0.04/0.87 kPa for PO2, -0.44/0.74 kPa for PCO2 and -2.61/6.98 nmol litre-1 for hydrogen ion concentration (i.e. 0.02/0.06 for pH).

Oxyhemoglobin saturation measured by pulse oximetry was 75-80% and polycythemia was found in complete blood count. We chose tracheal intubation for her airway management because of a large amount of sputum. General anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane, nitrous oxide and oxygen for ear tube surgery. During anesthesia she showed several episodes of desaturation which were well managed by frequent tracheal suctioning. Her circulation was stable with 50% N2O and sevoflurane 1.7-2.0%. The operation was performed uneventfully and the patient was discharged to the ward after tracheal extubation. Asplenia is frequently complicated with cyanotic congenital heart disease and increased susceptibility to bacterial infection. Anesthesia for these patients with upper respiratory infection should be managed with tracheal intubation even for a short surgery."

CD011912,0,25304248,0,A comparison of retesting rates using alternative testing algorithms in the pilot implementation of critical congenital heart disease screening in Minnesota.,"Prior to state-wide implementation of newborn screening for critical congenital heart disease (CCHD) in Minnesota, a pilot program was completed using the protocol recommended by the Secretary's Advisory Committee on Heritable Disorders in Newborns and Children (SACHDNC). This report compares the retesting rates for newborn screening for CCHDs using the SACHDNC protocol and four alternative algorithms used in large published CCHD screening studies. Data from the original Minnesota study were reanalyzed using the passing values from these four alternative protocols. The retesting rate for the first pulse oximeter measurement ranged from 1.1 % in the SACHDNC protocol to 9.6 % in the Ewer protocol. The SACHDNC protocol generated the lowest rate of retesting among all tested algorithms. Our data suggest that even minor modifications of CCHD screening protocol would significantly impact screening retesting rate. In addition, we provide support for including lower extremity oxygen saturations in the screening algorithm."

CD011912,0,8465565,0,[Interventional high frequency perforation and enlargement of the outflow tract of pulmonary atresia].,"In 18 patients with pulmonary atresia interventional perforation of the atresia was attempted using radiofrequency. All patients were referred for palliative surgery. The age ranged from 4 days to 19 years. After angiographic delineation of the relations between the right ventricular outflow tract and main pulmonary artery the tip of a radiofrequency perforation catheter (Cerablate-catheter, 2F, Osypka) was brought into contact with the atresia. The radiofrequency was applied in the unipolar fashion (radiofrequency-generator HAT 200, Osypka). Radiofrequency perforation was successfully performed in 14/18 patients, subsequent balloon dilatation was performed in 12 of these patients. In six patients with muscular atresia a Palmaz-stent was implanted into the right ventricular outflow tract. An inadvertent perforation of the right ventricular outflow tract occurred in three patients, of the pulmonary artery in two patients. However, these were tolerated without sequelae or clinical symptoms. The arterial oxygen saturation increased by 21%; in none of the patients was cardiac failure or pulmonary edema observed. Using the Cerablate-catheter even muscular atresias could be perforated. Implantation of a stent into the newly created right ventricular outflow tract results in a predictable communication between the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery. Although this interventional right ventricular outflow tract creation seems to be a promising new technique, experience is limited and there are no long-term results."
CD011912,0,26548105,0,[Screening of congenital heart defects in the newborn--time to unify the practices of oxygen saturation screening in Finland].,"Saturation screening of congenital heart defects in the newborn takes place in Finnish maternity hospitals. Saturation screening has been shown to be a cost-effective way to screen critical heart defects in the newborn. Screening aims to reveal the heart defect before potential circulatory collapse. Early diagnosis is important, as invasive therapeutic measures for congenital heart defects have been concentrated to one center. There are differences in the implementation of saturation screening. We therefore recommend unifying the screening system to conform with the recently published Nordic recommendation. Screening should be conducted during the first day of life by measuring the saturation values of both the right upper limb and one of the lower limbs."

Measurements were performed during the first 3 days of life. Four times a day, RR-intervals, respiration curve and rate, transcutaneously measured blood gases and observed body movements were recorded while the infants were asleep. All data were stored simultaneously in a micro-computer. Severity of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), patency of ductus arteriosus and periventricular haemorrhage were documented as well. Four sets of short- (STV) and long-term variability (LTV) indices were calculated. Severe RDS was associated with a significant decrease in LTV. The influence of RDS on LTV persisted after correction for conceptional age, postnatal age, behavioural state and variations in respiratory rate and in transcutaneous PO2. Infants with a symptomatic patent ductus arteriosus had lower LTV than controls with the same severity of RDS. STV was predominantly influenced by postnatal and conceptional age, and tended to be lower in infants with periventricular haemorrhage."

Use of a modified Qp/Qs ratio to assess adequacy of palliation of systemic-pulmonary artery shunts.,"The ability to assess changes in pulmonary blood flow, using a modified Qp/Qs ratio (Qp/Qsmod), was evaluated in 12 infants with congenital heart disease and complete intracardiac mixing who underwent modified Blalock-Taussig shunt procedures. At the various measuring stages there were no major changes in mean arterial pressure or heart rate. Arterial oxygen tensions and saturation increased (P less than 0.01) and the arterial to end-tidal carbon dioxide difference (PaCO2-PE'CO2) was significantly reduced (P less than 0.001) after completion of the shunt procedure. There was a significant increase in mean Qp/Qsmod after chest closure (P less than 0.001), which was seen to correlate well with early clinical outcome. Two patients who did not demonstrate any increase in Qp/Qsmod over the course of the procedure had failed shunts. The limitations of use of the Qp/Qsmod are discussed. A modified Qp/Qs ratio of less than unity after surgery is strongly indicative of inadequate palliation."

The patients' age ranged from 1 day to 72 months (median = 8 months) and weights ranged from 2.7 to 14.5 kg. In patients with transposition the systemic saturation increased from an average of 62% to 74.6% (p less than 0.001) and the inter-atrial mean pressure gradient was reduced from 7.74 +/- 5.3 to 1.4 +/- 2.04 mm Hg. Patients with mitral atresia had no significant increase in systemic arterial saturation but a significant decrease in the mean inter-atrial gradient from 19.6 +/- 12.4 to 3.8 +/- 5.3 mm Hg. In three patients the blade septostomy was unsuccessful for technical reasons and the condition of the patient. Complications included one death due to atrial laceration, blood loss requiring transfusion in 5 patients, transient CVA in one patient, and failure of the blade to close in one patient. We have found the palliative use of the blade catheter in conjunction with balloon atrial septostomy to be an effective and safe procedure."

Severe bleeding occurred during week 1 postpartum secondary to ruptured vaginal condylomas. The consequent anemia was accompanied by complaints of exercise intolerance that resolved with blood transfusion. Six weeks later, the patient was brought to the emergency department of the regional medical center, where she was found to be unresponsive, with a left-sided hemiparesis and with hypoxemia that failed to correct with assisted ventilation and 100% oxygen. A cardiology consultation was obtained, which identified the patient as having central cyanosis and heretofore unappreciated marked clubbing of fingers and toes. This suggested a diagnosis of right-to-left shunting, likely at the cardiac level, together with presumptive embolic stroke, which was documented by magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiography as a left pontine infarct. Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography identified anomalous drainage of the inferior vena cava into the left atrium, which was confirmed by a three-dimensional computed tomographic angiogram. Corrective surgery in the form of atrial septostomy and redirection of the inferior vena cava to the right atrium was performed.

DESIGN: Case report. SETTING: A pediatric intensive care unit at a university hospital. PATIENTS: Two neonatal patients with hypoplastic left heart syndrome admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit preoperatively. INTERVENTIONS: Nitrogen insufflation by using continuous-flow respiratory support. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We reduced the Fio2 in these patients by giving additional nitrogen to relieve pulmonary overcirculation and systemic hypoperfusion suspected by transcutaneous arterial oxygen saturation >90%, systemic arterial hypotension, and low urine output in the preoperative course. The improvement of systemic hemodynamics concomitant with decreases in transcutaneous arterial oxygen saturation <85% was accomplished by controlling Fio2 between 0.14 and 0.18. These infants were able to undergo Norwood's surgery after several days without complications relating to Fio2 reduction. CONCLUSION: Hypoxic gas therapy with nitrogen was effective clinically in preventing pulmonary overcirculation in neonatal patients with univentricular and parallel circulation."

We classified them into 2 groups; Group N: 8 cases without blood transfusion, Group H: 8 cases with blood transfusion. Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) system was a closed circuit and priming volume was 370 to 500 ml. There was no difference between the 2 groups in operative age, body weight, preoperative state, operation time, CPB time, aortic cross clamp time, bleeding and postoperative state. In Group N, CPB blood was returned to the patient as soon as possible after CPB was weaned, and postoperative hemodynamics were stable in both groups. In Group N, hematocrit (Ht) values were consistently lower than in Group H, from initiation of CPB to leaving the hospital. To accomplish safe CPB, we measured systemic venous oxygen saturation (SvO2). In 6 cases of Group N, SvO2 during rewarming was 48.1 +/- 16.0% and Ht value was 13.2 +/- 1.5%. It is thought that the safe CPB could be conducted in Group N. In addition, in Group N, respiratory index showed better values than in Group H during the postoperative period. It is thought that CPB without blood transfusion may be favorable to prevent lung injury after CPB. Retrospectively, it is thought that, to accomplish safe CPB without blood transfusion, preoperative Ht values of over 30% are desirable in patients weighing 6 kg and those of over 35% are desirable in patients weighing 5 kg."

PGE2 was infused prior to surgery, and in three patients, during surgery until a satisfactory aorto-pulmonary shunt was established. PGE2 produced consistently an immediate and persistent rise in arterial oxygen saturation, which could be ascribed to dilation of the ductus arteriosus. No major side effects occurred, except for pyrexia in two infants. All patients recovered well from surgery. We propose this treatment as preparation for surgery in any infant with congenital heart defects and ductus-dependent pulmonary blood flow. The same treatment may be useful preoperatively in patients with aortic interruption who also depend on continued patency of the ductus for blood supply to the lower half of the body."

The mean preoperative arterial oxygen saturation was 62% (range, 33 to 80%), and mean postoperative saturation was 87% (range, 78 to 90%). There were 5 late deaths, 1 probably caused by shunt failure. Nine long-term survivors have done well. Follow-up ranges from 1 to 36 months (18 months). Factors influencing conduit function are length, technical considerations, and pulmonary vascular resistance. Late restudy in 5 of 9 survivors confirms patency and demonstrates bidirectional pulmonary blood flow. Since PTFE shunt flow capability is fixed, the infant may require repair or a second shunt within 24 months of the initial procedure."
CD011912,0,26939749,0,Transcatheter stenting of the right ventricular outflow tract augments pulmonary arterial growth in symptomatic infants with right ventricular outflow tract obstruction and hypercyanotic spells.,"We retrospectively reviewed all the children with right ventricular outflow tract obstruction, hypoplastic pulmonary annulus, and pulmonary arteries who underwent stenting of the right ventricular outflow tract for hypercyanotic spells at our institution between January, 2008 and December, 2013; nine patients who underwent cardiac catheterisation at a median age of 39 days (range 12-60 days) and weight of 3.6 kg (range 2.6-4.3 kg) were identified. The median number of stents placed was one stent (range 1-4). The median oxygen saturation increased from 60% to 96%. The median right pulmonary artery size increased from 3.3 to 5.5 mm (-2.68 to -0.92 Z-score), and the median left pulmonary artery size increased from 3.4 to 5.5 mm (-1.93 to 0 Z-scores). Among all, one patient developed transient pulmonary haemorrhage, and one patient had pericardial tamponade requiring drainage. Complete repair of tetralogy of Fallot +/- atrioventricular septal defect or double-outlet right ventricle was achieved in all nine patients. Transcatheter stent alleviation of the right ventricular outflow tract obstruction resolves hypercyanotic spells and allows reasonable growth of the pulmonary arteries to facilitate successful surgical repair. This represents a viable alternative to placement of a systemic-to-pulmonary artery shunt, particularly in small neonates."

CD011912,0,11107205,0,Evaluation of ventricular septal defect repair using intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography: frequency and significance of residual defects in infants and children.,"Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography (IOTEE) is commonly used to assess for residual defect and the need to return to bypass after repair of ventricular septal defect (VSD). The frequency and significance of residual septal defects as noted on IOTEE has not been well defined. We evaluated the frequency of residual VSD via IOTEE and the relationship between size of a residual VSD and rate of reoperation. In addition, we looked at the relationship between the presence of a residual VSD via IOTEE and the presence of residual VSD at follow-up transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). Residual VSD was measured via the largest width of the Doppler color jet diameter originating at the left ventricular septal surface. Of the 294 patients evaluated with IOTEE after VSD repair, one-third had a residual defect by IOTEE Doppler color flow mapping. Two-thirds of these defects closed spontaneously on TTE by the time of hospital discharge. There was no difference in frequency of residual VSD between simple (VSD closure alone, n = 90) and complex (VSD with associated lesions, n = 204) repair. Return to bypass with immediate reoperation was undertaken in nine patients, all of whom had significant shunt via oximetry (Qp/Qs > 1.5:1.0). All had residual VSD color jet diameters > 3 mm. Seven patients had residual color jet equal to 3 mm; however, hemodynamic studies did not reveal a significant shunt and none of these had reoperation. Seven patients with no VSD or < 3 mm residual VSD via had late reoperation to close residual VSD at 4 days to 5 months after initial operation. These were due to patch dehiscence or development of an ""intramural"" VSD in patients with conotruncal anomaly. A residual defect on IOTEE color Doppler measuring > or = 4 mm predicts the need for immediate reoperation, while a 3 mm defect may be significant and requires additional intraoperative hemodynamic evaluation. The majority of small defects noted on IOTEE are not present at discharge TTE. Patients with conotruncal defect repair should be followed closely for development of late significant ""intramural"" defects."

CD011912,0,1907112,0,The relationship between the arterial to end-tidal PCO2 difference and hemoglobin saturation in patients with congenital heart disease.,"In right-to-left (RL) intracardiac shunting, the venous blood that is added to the oxygenated blood in the left heart is both poor in oxygen and rich in carbon dioxide. Thus, any given degree of arterial desaturation is associated with an obligatory arterial to end-tidal carbon dioxide tension difference (PaCO2--PETCO2). This paper presents a theoretical analysis of the relationship between PaCO2-PETCO2 and arterial hemoglobin saturation (SaO2) in cyanotic heart disease. Using the shunt equation as a starting point, a curvilinear, negative correlation between PaCO2-PETCO2 and SaO2 can be demonstrated. The slope of the regression of PaCO2--PETCO2 against SaO2 is shown to be positively correlated to Hb concentration, PaCO2, and the respiratory quotient R. The slope of the regression is also slightly increased at relatively high SaO2s and at high inspired oxygen fractions, although these latter factors are of lesser significance. However, in addition to the above primary effects of RL shunting, secondary effects may occur if pulmonary perfusion is reduced sufficiently to cause ""alveolar hypoperfusion,"" which also creates an alveolar dead space. Primary and secondary effects are additive. This theoretical analysis is illustrated with a study of 27 children with congenital heart disease. Their lungs were ventilated with a Servoventilator 900 C, and carbon dioxide single-breath tests were obtained on-line with the use of a computerized system based on the Siemens-Elema carbon dioxide analyzer 930. Blood was sampled for PaCO2 measurement and arterial Hb saturation was measured by pulse oximetry (SpO2).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD011912,0,1476572,0,Auditory brainstem responses in congenital heart disease.,"To evaluate the effect of chronic hypoxemia on brainstem maturation, auditory brainstem responses were examined in 70 children (32 with and 38 without cyanosis) who had congenital heart disease. Ninety-one age-matched normal children served as controls. At 1-3 months of age, the I-V interpeak latencies of cyanotic infants (mean +/- S.D.; 5.17 +/- 0.17 ms) were more prolonged than were those of controls (4.95 +/- 0.11 ms) and those without cyanosis (4.84 +/- 0.22 ms; P < .05; P < .01). At 4-11 months of age, the I-V interpeak latencies of cyanotic infants (4.85 +/- 0.13 ms) were more prolonged than were those of controls (4.67 +/- 0.19 ms) and those not experiencing cyanosis (4.5 +/- 0.17 ms; P < .05; P < .01). In the cyanotic children, there was a significant negative correlation between the I-V interpeak latency and oxygen partial pressure (P < .01) or oxygen saturation (P < .05). Three of the 70 patients (4.3%) with congenital heart disease had absent auditory brainstem response. These data indicate that chronic hypoxemia may be one of the factors in retarded brainstem maturation."

CD011912,0,2353187,0,Brain type creatine kinase in relation to oxygen desaturation in the blood of children with congenital heart disease.,"The concentration of brain type creatine kinase (CK-BB) was measured in blood from the internal jugular vein in 32 children (less than 1 year old) with congenital heart disease. In transposition of the great arteries the CK-BB levels were significantly higher than in children without cyanosis (10.1 +/- 4.1 vs. 3.0 +/- 0.5 ng/ml). A negative correlation was found for CK-BB concentration and arterial oxygen saturation (r = -0.41, p less than 0.02 for all children and r = -0.62, p less than 0.05 for those with tetralogy of Fallot). It is suggested that the increased CK-BB levels in the blood of cyanotic children reflect chronic cerebral hypoxia, which may explain other reports of reduced psycho-intellectual function in patients with cyanotic heart disease."

CD011912,0,23237812,0,Newborn piglet traits associated with survival and growth performance until weaning.,"Pre-weaning piglet mortality represents significant economic losses, and approximately half of this mortality occurs within the first 3 days after birth. Factors involved in postnatal mortality can also be associated with a poor growth performance until weaning. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of some variables measured right after birth on piglet survival during the first week of life and growth performance until weaning. Piglets included in the analysis (n=612) were born from 3 to 5 parity sows. Piglets were monitored for blood oxygen saturation (SatO2), heart rate (HR), blood glucose concentration, rectal temperature at birth (RT0 h) and at 24h after birth (RT24 h). Genetic line, birth following or not an obstetric intervention, birth order, sex, skin color, integrity of the umbilical cord, and time elapsed from birth until first attempts to stand were also recorded. Piglets were weighed at birth (BW), and at 7, 14 and 21 days after birth in order to evaluate their postnatal development. Cumulative mortality rates were 3.3%, 5.4% and 8.7% at 3, 7 and 21 days after birth, respectively. Body temperature at birth (RT0 h) did not affect (P>0.05) the survival nor the piglet growth performance. Piglets with cyanotic skin and those that took more than 5 min to stand showed higher chance of mortality (P<0.05) compared to normal skin piglets and to piglets which stood before 1 min, respectively. Piglets with broken umbilical cord had higher odds (P<0.05) of mortality up to 3 days after birth, respectively. Higher odds (P<0.05) of mortality up to 3 or 7 days were associated with later birth order (>9), low BW (<1275g), low (24-30 mg/dl) and high (45-162 mg/dl) blood glucose concentrations, or low RT24 h (<38.1°C). Piglets with BW<1545 g, low RT24 h (<38.6°C) and female piglets had higher odds of a low weight at weaning (P<0.05). Among the factors studied, cyanotic skin, delay for standing, broken umbilical cord, high birth order, low BW, low RT24 h, and both low and high blood glucose concentrations are indicators of a lower ability of piglets to survive during the first week after birth. The growth performance until weaning is compromised in piglets with a lower BW, a lower RT24 h and if they are female pigs."
CD011912,0,1692680,0,Palliative reconstruction of right ventricular outflow tract in tetralogy with hypoplastic pulmonary arteries.,"Twenty-five symptomatic patients with tetralogy of Fallot underwent palliative reconstruction of the right ventricular outflow tract without closure of the ventricular septal defect. Their ages ranged from 5 months to 20 years (mean age, 3.5 years). Eight patients had had 13 prior systemic-pulmonary arterial shunts. There were six hospital deaths (24%). Three patients needed a repeat right ventricular outflow reconstruction. There was one late death. The other patients manifested clinical improvement; hematocrit decreased from 0.54 to 0.43 (p less than 0.01) and arterial oxygen saturation increased from 63.0% to 83.2% (p less than 0.01). The size of the pulmonary artery, defined as the ratio of the sum of the diameter of the right and left pulmonary arteries to the diameter of the descending aorta, increased from 0.72 to 2.06 (p less than 0.01). Sixteen patients underwent a corrective operation 2.4 years after palliation. The results of palliative right ventricular outflow tract reconstruction suggest that it may be an optional strategy for the treatment of symptomatic patients who have tetralogy of Fallot with severely hypoplastic pulmonary arteries."
CD011912,0,21108550,0,New directions in device therapies among children and adults with congenital heart.,"Innovative, nonthoracotomy, catheter-delivered therapies have redefined the approach to and treatment of congenital heart defects. Starting in the 1960s with the creation of an opening in the atrial septum to permit effective blood mixing and improve oxygen saturation in cyanotic infants, interventional cardiac procedures continue to replace many of the time-honored surgeries that were the mainstay of repair or correction for infants and children with heart defects. Now as those children reach adulthood and still require modifications of their defects, catheter-based interventions are becoming more important. This article examines some of the more recent applications of device therapy currently available to patients with congenital heart, including heart failure, septal defects, vascular problems and heart valves. Device use in deference to surgery, risks and benefits as well as complications associated with such catheter-delivered therapies are discussed."

CD011912,0,2483978,0,Cavopulmonary anastomosis as long-term palliation for patients with tricuspid atresia.,"Prior to 1970, most patients with tricuspid atresia (TA) and reduced pulmonary blood flow were palliated by means of a systemic to pulmonary artery shunt (SPAS). In Birmingham between 1967 and 1988, 19 patients with TA (aged 16 days to 23 years, mean 3.8 years) have undergone side-to-side cavopulmonary anastomosis (CPA) with preservation of pulmonary artery continuity. One had undergone a previous right Blalock-Taussig shunt and in 1 patient with left and right SVCs, bilateral CPAs were performed. Nine patients were less than 1 year old at the time of operation. There were no operative deaths. One late death occurred due to pneumonia. Immediate clinical improvement occurred in all cases. Six symptomatic patients subsequently required further surgery (mean interval between operations 8.9 years, range 4.6-14.2 years). The remaining 12 patients have recently been reviewed. Mean follow-up was 9.5 years (range 5 weeks to 21 years). Exercise tolerance remains good (9 in NY-HA Class 1 or 2) and resting transcutaneous oxygen saturations are higher (mean 85%, range 70%-89%) compared with preoperative values (P less than 0.01). In small children, CPA avoids the complications of SPAS and, in some patients, may itself achieve adequate long-term definitive palliation."
CD011912,0,15818354,0,Postoperative management: the role of mixed venous oxygen saturation monitoring.,"The results of the Norwood operation have improved considerably over the last decade, due in part to improvement in postoperative care. Mixed venous oxygen saturation (MvO2) monitoring has been an important addition to postoperative management. Our use of MvO2 monitoring in Norwood patients has included 96 infants operated from 1996 to the present. This strategy has proven to be technically straightforward and adds information not provided by monitoring systemic saturation alone. MvO2 has a nadir at 6-12 hours after surgery and below a value of 30% is associated with anaerobic metabolism. It identifies patients at risk for early mortality. It also allows evaluation of management of treatment strategies that evolve over time and of specific interventions in individual patients. Optimizing MvO2 constitutes an important goal of postoperative management after the Norwood procedure."
CD011912,0,3154641,0,Hemodynamic effects of nifedipine and oxygen in children with pulmonary hypertension.,"Fourteen patients, 2 to 20 years old were investigated. Two had primary pulmonary hypertension, 11 had congenital heart disease and post-tricuspid shunts, and 1, a 20-year-old patient, was investigated after he had undergone surgical correction of truncus arteriosus I. Pulmonary arterial pressure, pulmonary flow index, peripheral systolic blood pressure and heart rate were measured before, and several times after intrapulmonary injection into the pulmonary artery of 0.5 microgram nifedipine/kg. Six patients were given an additional dose of 1 microgram nifedipine per kilogram into the pulmonary artery and hemodynamic measurements were repeated. In eight children, receiving 100% oxygen via a breathing mask, nifedipine effects were compared with oxygen effects. After 10 minutes under oxygen, the same hemodynamics were determined as after nifedipine. In addition, in four of these children aortic pressure and arterial oxygen saturation were also measured. Maximal effects occurred within 4 minutes. 0.5 micrograms nifedipine per kilogram caused a slight reduction in mean pulmonary arterial pressure (p less than 0.05), as well as increase in pulmonary flow index (p less than 0.005). However, no significant change in heart rate or in systolic blood pressure was observed. 1 microgram nifedipine per kilogram IP had almost the same effects. No adverse side effects occurred, besides mild headaches in one child. A comparison of nifedipine injected into the pulmonary artery with oxygen breathing in congenital heart disease combined with pulmonary hypertension, is reported for the first time. Nifedipine had a more pronounced and beneficial effect with a selective action on the pulmonary vascular bed."

We sought to determine the incidence of undetected CCHD in Tennessee and the diagnostic gap of CCHD in Middle Tennessee prior to screening implementation. The Tennessee Initiative for Perinatal Quality Care (TIPQC) Undetected CCHD Registry is a quality improvement initiative established to identify neonates discharged from the nursery with undetected CCHD. The TIPQC database was queried and a simultaneous review of all neonates with CCHD in the Middle Tennessee region was performed to define the incidence and identify the pre-screen diagnostic gap of undetected CCHD at the time of hospital discharge. In 2011, of 79,462 live births in Tennessee, 12 newborns had undiagnosed CCHD (incidence 15 per 100,000; 95 % CI 9-26 per 100,000). Nine of 12 (75 %) had coarctation of the aorta (CoA). There were no deaths due to undiagnosed CCHD. In the Middle Tennessee region, 6 of 45 neonates with CCHD were missed, for a diagnostic gap of 13 % (95 % CI 6-26 %). Prior to implementation of CCHD screening using pulse oximetry, 12 Tennessee neonates with CCHD were missed by prenatal ultrasound and newborn examination. CoA was the most common lesion missed and is also the CCHD most likely to be missed despite addition of screening using pulse oximetry. Continued evaluation of the diagnostic gap with particular attention to missed diagnoses of CoA should accompany institution of CCHD screening programs."
CD011912,0,7875704,0,Blade and balloon atrial septostomy for creation of an adequate interatrial communication.,"During a 7 year period from 1984 to 1991, 100 infants underwent either balloon atrial septostomy (BAS) (n = 92) or blade septostomy (BLS) (n = 8). The indication was complete transposition of the great arteries in all the patients. The mean age in the BAS group was 1.8 +/- 1.5 months while that in the infants requiring BLS due to a thick septum was 3.03 +/- 2.29 months. The degree of improvement in arterial oxygen saturation in both groups was satisfactory -27.16 +/- 14.06% in the BAS group vs 23.5 +/- 12.18% in the BLS group. There were no procedure related deaths in the BLS group, through only monoplane fluoroscopy was used in 6/8 patients. Three patients however died following balloon septostomy. We conclude that BLS is a safe and effective alternative to surgical septostomy when performed with due care. Two dimensional echocardiography during BAS enhances the speed and safety of the procedure and helps to identify patients who may require BLS due to a thick interatrial septum."

It represents a therapeutical screening of treatment in paediatric population. The aim of this retrospective study is to evaluate the validity of noninvasive technique for determination of oxygen concentration in cardiac and pulomological patients. The study included 221 patients, with a mean age of 39 months (1.5-192) who were hospitalised during the period of 1.6.2000. till 31.12.2002. at Pulmoalergology and Cardiorheumatology department of Paediatric clinic CCU Sarajevo. Three groups of patients were evaluated: first one, which included 194/221 patients with obstructive and inflammatory lung diseases, 17/221 patients formed II group of pts with congenital heart anomalies (CHA) and the third one which had 10/221 patients with CHA associated with lung diseases. In all patients the diagnostic-laboratory investigations were done including transcutaneous determination of oxygen saturation by pulsoxyimetry (PO) Nellcor and Johnson-Johnson, as well as capillary, with adequate treatment. The mean oxygen saturation (OS) in the first group of patients at admission by PO was 86%, capillary 73.6%, and after treatment OS PO was 91.6%. In the II group the mean OS at admission was 88.5% PO, capillary 83%, after treatment 94.9%. The mean OS at admission in third patient's group was 76%, and after treatment 91.2% which is statistically significant (F = 0.03) and is in concordance with modern therapeutical approach.

CD011912,0,572632,0,Clinical manifestations of dynamic left ventricular outflow tract stenosis in infants with d-transposition of the great arteries with intact ventricular septum.,"Four infants with d-transposition of the great arteries and intact ventricular septum who manifested early clinical symptoms and deterioration due to dynamic left ventricular outflow stenosis are presented. All four had an anatomically adequate atrial septal defect, made at the initial balloon atrial septostomy, that was later confirmed intraoperatively. Two infants continued to have a low arterial oxygen saturation level because of inadequate interatrial mixing, and one of these had severe persistent cyanosis and was treated with the Mustard operation at age 4 days. The other two infants subsequently presented with hypercyanotic spells at age 3 months. All four infants had features of dynamic left ventricular outflow stenosis on hemodynamic, angiocardiographic and echocardiographic studies. The left ventricular outflow pressure gradient was shown to increase after administration of isoproterenol in one infant, and relief of a cyanotic spell with reduction of left ventricular systolic pressure was achieved in another after intravenous administration of propranolol. The Mustard operation relieved symptoms in all infants. The effect of left ventricular outflow tract stenosis on the mechanisms responsible for interatrial mixing in d-transposition of the great arteries with intact ventricular septum is discussed."

Although we demonstrated that pulse oximetry (PO) screening for critical congenital heart disease is feasible in the Netherlands, it is unknown whether parents find the screening acceptable when performed in home birth setting. We assessed the acceptability of PO screening to mothers after screening in home setting. A questionnaire was sent electronically to mothers who gave birth and/or had postnatal care under supervision of a community midwife participating in the Pulse Oximetry Leiden Screening (POLS) study, a feasibility study of PO screening in the Dutch care system, performed in the Leiden region, the Netherlands. The questionnaire included questions based on satisfaction, general feelings, and perceptions of PO screening. A total of 1172/1521 (77%) mothers completed the questionnaire. Overall, mothers were happy with the performance of the test (95%), thought their baby was comfortable during the screening (90%) and did not feel stressed while the screening was performed (92%). Most mothers would recommend the test to others (93%) and considered the test important for all babies (93%)."

CD011912,0,2477828,0,Hypoplastic left heart syndrome: lack of correlation between preoperative demographic and laboratory findings and survival following palliative surgery.,"To determine whether preoperative demographic and metabolic variables correlated with early or late survival following palliative surgery for hypoplastic left heart syndrome, we reviewed the charts of 89 patients operated upon from October 1984 to January 1987. The variables analyzed were age at operation, lowest preoperative pH and H2CO3, highest preoperative arterial oxygen saturation, the occurrence of a preoperative cardiorespiratory arrest, and location of birth relative to the surgical institution. The data were evaluated by chi-squared, multivariate, and life-table analyses to the end of the first postoperative year. None of the factors analyzed significantly correlated with either short-term (less than or equal to 30 days) or long-term (greater than 30 days) survival. Thus, neither demographic nor metabolic factors including prior cardiorespiratory arrest should be considered contraindications to surgical palliation for hypoplastic left heart syndrome."
CD011912,0,21335618,0,Four-side near-infrared spectroscopy measured in a paediatric population during surgery for congenital heart disease.,"In this study we monitored renal, hepatic and muscular oxygen saturations by near-infrared spectroscopy and we evaluated the correlation with variables that could affect tissue oxygenation in 16 paediatric patients during surgical heart procedure. We considered the following phases: 1) basal time (after induction of anaesthesia and before median sternotomy), 2) before starting cardiopulmonary bypass, 3) 15 min after starting it, 4) at half time, 5) 15 min before the end, 6) at the end, 7) 15 min after the end, and 8) 10 min before paediatric intensive care unit admission. Heart rate, mean arterial pressure, peripheral oxygen saturation, serum lactate, haemoglobin, blood gas analysis, and rectal temperature were registered. We found a decrease of all monitored regional saturations (rSO(2)) (cerebral P = 0.006, hepatic P = 0.005) before starting the bypass. After this time, cerebral saturation gradually increased without reaching the basal value; renal and liver saturations increased after starting bypass; muscular rSO(2) increased in the second half (P = 0.005). A statistically significative inverse correlation between cerebral rSO(2) and pH was observed. In conclusion, during paediatric heart surgery a vulnerable period was identified. We underline the necessity to monitor this phase."
CD011912,0,26876122,0,Screening for Critical Congenital Heart Disease.,"Screening for critical congenital heart disease (CCHD) was added to the United States Recommended Uniform Screening Panel in 2011. Since that time, CCHD screening with pulse oximetry has become nearly universal for newborns born in the United States. There are various algorithms in use. Although the goal of the screening program is to identify children who may have CCHD, most newborns who have a low oxygen saturation will not have CCHD. Further study is needed to determine optimal guidelines for CCHD screening in special settings such as the neonatal intensive care unit, areas in high altitude, and home births."

Nitric oxide gas inhalation was commenced just after cardiopulmonary bypass together with intravenous phosphodiesterase III inhibitor administration. After oral intake was started, pulmonary vascular dilators such as beraprost, sildenafil, bosentan were given orally according to amount of chest drainage and patient's condition. After discharge, oxygen therapy at home was continued for three months. No hospital death occurred after surgery. All patients were followed by our institute and follow-up period was 44.2+/-26 (36-106.8) months. One late death occurred during this follow-up period after re-operation. Cardiac catheterization after the Fontan completion showed transpulmonary gradient of 5.9+/-2.4 mmHg, systemic output of 3.4+/-2.1 l/min m2. Arterial oxygen saturation (SaO(2)) at the latest outpatient visit was 94.4+/-3.8%. According to our clinical experience with two-staged total cavopulmonary connection using an extracardiac conduit without fenestration, fenestration in the Fontan circuit is not necessary when performing the Fontan completion. Two-staged extracardiac total cavopulmonary connection without fenestration can be satisfactorily completed with the aid of pulmonary vasodilation therapy."
CD011912,0,21444044,0,Objective assessment of cardiac output in infants after cardiac surgery.,"An accurate measurement of cardiac performance in infants after cardiopulmonary bypass has long been considered to be an important part of postoperative management. To be useful in clinical decision making, such measurements should ideally be reproducible, non invasive and accurately reflect tissue perfusion and oxygen delivery. Historically, we have relied on intermittent measurements of cardiac output using indicator dilution methods; and more recently, technologies that use pulse contour analysis, bio-impedance, or Doppler methodology. These all have the same shortcoming, that they provide a number that the information as to whether it provides adequate tissue perfusion. There is increasing emphasis being placed on the measurement of oxygen delivery either by mixed venous oxygen saturation and serum lactate, which are important markers of the adequacy of organ perfusion; and relating this to outcome, the development of organ dysfunction and length of ICU stay."

He was diagnosed with pulmonary atresia, ventricular septal defect and major aorto-pulmonary collaterals with severely hypoplastic true pulmonary arteries. A 3.5 mm Gore-Tex central shunt was anastomosed from the ascending aorta to the main pulmonary artery at 4 months of age and a weight of 3.5 kg. The left pulmonary artery measured 1-2 mm and the right pulmonary artery measured 1 mm. His saturations increased from 70% to 85% following placement of the central shunt. At 16 months of age, his oxygen saturation decreased to 68%. Cardiac catheterization, using a retrograde approach, and angiography demonstrated a moderate degree of stenosis within the distal shunt and a severe left pulmonary arterial stenosis. A 4 x 18 mm Multi-Link Vision coronary stent was implanted within the stenotic central shunt and angioplasty of the left pulmonary arterial stenosis was performed. The oxygen saturation improved to 84% after the procedure. Although stenting of the Blalock-Taussig shunt has been described previously, this represents one of the first reports of stenting of a central aortopulmonary shunt. This significantly improved the patient's oxygen saturation and allowed the potential for some further central pulmonary arterial growth prior to unifocalization procedure."
CD011912,0,8159035,0,Inhaled nitric oxide as a therapy for pulmonary hypertension after operations for congenital heart defects.,"Seventeen infants were treated with inhaled nitric oxide for critical pulmonary artery hypertension after operations for congenital heart defects. In all 17 patients conventional medical therapy consisting of hyperventilation, deep sedation/analgesia, and correction of metabolic acidosis had failed. All children were monitored with a transthoracic pulmonary artery catheter inserted at operation. Pulmonary artery hypertension was defined as an acute rise in pulmonary pressure associated with a decrease in oxygen arterial or venous saturation. After failure of conventional medical therapy, 20 ppm of inhaled nitric oxide was administered to the patient. In all patients the pulmonary pressures decreased (mean pulmonary arterial pressure decreased by -34% +/- 21%) without significant change in systemic arterial pressure, whereas the oxygen arterial saturation and oxygen venous saturation increased by 9.7% +/- 12% and 37% +/- 28%, respectively. Fifteen children were discharged from the intensive care unit at 10 +/- 6 days (range 3 to 26 days) and two died. This study demonstrates that inhaled nitric oxide exerts a selective pulmonary vasodilation without decreasing systemic arterial pressure in children with congenital heart disease. The increased values of mixed venous oxygen saturation and urinary output suggest that this selective lowering of pulmonary vascular resistance improved the overall hemodynamics. The potential toxic effects of nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide necessitate careful consideration of the risks and benefits of inhaled nitric oxide therapy."

CD011912,0,3905015,0,Measurements of left-to-right intracardiac shunting in adults: oximetric versus indicator dilution techniques.,"Of the various techniques that are available to assess the presence and magnitude of intracardiac shunting, oximetry and indicator dilution are used most frequently. This study was performed to compare these methods in adult patients with pure left-to-right intracardiac shunting. In 27 patients [12 men, 15 women, aged 32 +/- 12 (mean +/- SD) years], shunt magnitude was assessed in close temporal proximity by both techniques. The oximetric percentage left-to-right shunt averaged 55 +/- 16%, whereas the indocyanine green dye percentage shunt was significantly less (36 +/- 14%, p less than 0.001). The oximetric percentage shunt exceeded the indocyanine green dye percentage shunt in 26 and did so by greater than 20% in 23 patients. Thus, there is a substantial difference in shunt magnitude between the oximetric and the indicator dilution techniques. In infants, indicator dilution yields results that are larger than those obtained with the oximetric method. Conversely, in adults, the indicator dilution technique gives results that are consistently smaller than those obtained with oximetry. As a result, the decision regarding therapy of an intracardiac shunt should be made with this in mind."

CD011912,0,21114707,0,Benefits and risks of red blood cell transfusion in pediatric patients undergoing cardiac surgery.,"As the number of neonates and young infants undergoing cardiac surgery requiring cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) increases, red blood cell (RBC) transfusion will continue to be an integral part of the practice of pediatric cardiac anesthesiology. The decision of when to transfuse RBCs to these patients is complex and influenced by multiple factors such as size, presence of cyanotic heart disease, complexity of the surgical procedure, and the hemostatic alterations induced by CPB. The known benefits of RBC transfusion include an increase in the oxygen-carrying capacity of blood, improved tissue oxygenation, and improved hemostasis. Unfortunately, there is no minimum hemoglobin level that serves as a transfusion trigger for all pediatric patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Physiologic signs such as tachycardia, hypotension, low mixed venous oxygen saturation and increased oxygen extraction ratios can provide objective evidence of the need to augment a given hemoglobin level. Nevertheless, the benefits of RBC transfusion must be balanced against its risks and, in recent years, RBC transfusion has been subjected to intense scrutiny. The adverse consequences of RBC transfusion include the transmission of infectious diseases and immune-mediated and nonimmune-mediated complications. Advances in donor selection, infectious disease testing of donated blood, use of leukocyte reduction and irradiation of blood in defined situations have improved the safety of the blood supply in terms of infection transmission. However, a growing number of prospective randomized clinical trials are finding an association between RBC transfusion and an increased risk of morbidity and mortality even with the use of leuko-reduced blood. Thus, it is becoming increasingly important that the decision to transfuse RBCs be made with a thorough understanding of the benefit-to-risk ratio. This review addresses the benefits and risks of RBC transfusion, pertinent data acquired in the setting of congenital cardiac surgery and techniques designed to minimize the need for RBC transfusion."

CD011912,0,3367912,0,[Noninvasive determination of oxygen saturation using pulse oximetry in pediatric cardiology].,"Pulse oximetry is a relatively new noninvasive method to measure arterial oxygen saturation (SO2). We evaluated the reliability of a pulse oximeter (N-100, Nellcor/Drger, Lübeck) in single and continuous measurements of SO2. During cardiac catheterisation we compared pulse oximeter (puls.SO2) measurements to those in simultaneously taken arterial samples (art.SO2), and obtained 203 pair measurements in 85 patients, mostly newborns and infants; in 20 of them before and during the breathing of oxygen through a mask. We also have 67 pair measurements of capillary blood samples (kap.SO2) and puls.SO2. Continuous measurements with the pulse oximeter were carried out in 17 patients for up to 116 h. Our main results are: 1. In the puls.SO2 range of 66% to 100% the measurements with the pulse oximeter were accurate (r = 0.97, Syx = 2.1). Below 66% the puls.SO2 values were on average much higher than the art.SO2 values, with an increased variance. Intraindividual oxygenation changes before and during the breathing of oxygen were accurately measured. 2. Pulse oximetry is much more informative than kap.SO2 measurements, because its information about the SO2 before blood sampling (= resting value) and following SO2 changes during the painful procedure (= stress values). 3. Continuous measurements with the pulse oximeter are very simple and very reliable and are not associated with skin injury. Because the pulse oximeters responses rapid to oxygenation changes and does not need calibration it is very valuable in the assessment of therapeutic procedures in patients with cyanotic heart disease. We conclude that the pulse oximeter is a very important new diagnostic tool in pediatric cardiology."

Surgical treatment becomes more challenging when an extracardiac total anomalous pulmonary venous connection (TAPVC) requiring surgical repair neonatally is also present. We describe a successful staged Fontan operation for a neonate with a single ventricle, right atrial isomerism, pulmonary atresia with major aortopulmonary collateral arteries, a small central pulmonary artery and a supracardiac TAPVC. Unifocalization of the pulmonary vasculature was achieved by ligating all dual-supply major aortopulmonary collateral arteries at their origins, concomitant with supracardiac TAPVC repair and modified Blalock-Taussig shunt placement at 15 days. The patient underwent patch augmentation of the small stenosed central pulmonary artery at 8 months and bilateral bidirectional Glenn shunt at 14 months. The Fontan operation was completed at 27 months using an intra-extracardiac conduit with fenestration. One year later, catheter examination revealed good Fontan circulation with acceptable central venous pressure, oxygen saturation and cardiac function.

Although cardiovascular evaluation is a standard component of the diagnostic work-up in patients with Down syndrome, the value of routine neonatal echocardiography in this population is debated. We studied 114 neonates with Down syndrome who underwent both cardiac physical examination and echocardiography in the neonatal period to assess the accuracy of physical examination for identifying cardiovascular anomalies in this population. We retrospectively reviewed physical examination records and echocardiogram reports in 114 neonates with Down syndrome and trisomy 21. A patient was considered to have an abnormal cardiac physical examination if there was a pathologic cardiac murmur and/or cyanosis or an abnormal systemic arterial oxygen saturation. The median age at the time of physical examination was 2 days (1-30 days). Physical examination findings suggestive of cardiovascular pathology were noted in 77 patients (68%), with an abnormal cardiac murmur in 34 (30%), cyanosis and/or a pulse oximeter reading of < or = 92% in 35 (31%), and both in 7 (6%). The echocardiogram was abnormal in 75 patients (66%), with an atrioventricular septal defect in 33, tetralogy of Fallot in 13, both of these anomalies in 2, a ventricular septal defect in 17, a patent ductus arteriosus beyond 7 days of age in 7, and other anomalies in 2. The sensitivity of physical examination findings for detection of cardiovascular anomalies was 80% and the specificity was 56%. The positive predictive value of an abnormal physical examination was 78% and the negative predictive value of a normal physical examination was 59%. Fifteen patients had a normal physical examination but an abnormal echocardiogram, nine of whom eventually required surgery. Physical examination alone is not sufficient to identify cardiovascular anomalies in neonates with Down syndrome. In the newborn with Down syndrome, the potential benefits of early diagnosis, in the context of physical examination findings, should be considered in determining whether an echocardiogram should be performed in the neonatal period."

Erythropoietin values were in the normal range (10 to 30 microU/mL) in 73% (58 of 80) of the patients with and 82% (54 of 66) of those without cyanosis. Elevated erythropoietin values in cyanotic patients were associated with lower mixed venous oxygen saturation and tension than in cyanotic patients with normal erythropoietin levels, even though the degree of polycythemia was similar. In contrast, most of the acyanotic patients who had elevated erythropoietin levels were anemic. Of the blood oxygen measurements, mixed venous oxygen saturation and tension had the closest inverse correlation with erythropoietin values. The normal erythropoietin values in most patients are in accord with other observations that show that an elevation in erythropoietin level in response to hypoxia will be transient if it results in a rise in hemoglobin concentration ""appropriate"" to the degree of hypoxia. Persistent elevation of erythropoietin in patients with congenital heart disease may indicate harmful impairment of hemoglobin production that is potentially correctable."

Compared with the control group, the acyanotic group had a higher respiratory rate (66 +/- 19 breaths/min vs 35 +/- 6 breaths/min; p less than 0.01), a lower tidal volume (65% +/- 29% predicted vs 105% +/- 18% predicted; p less than 0.01), and a lower total respiratory compliance (59% +/- 18% predicted vs 106% +/- 30% predicted; p less than 0.01). A negative correlation existed between SaO2%T and aortic SaO2 (R2 = 0.64; p less than 0.01). We conclude that oxygen desaturation occurs during sleep in infants with congenital heart disease; the presence of desaturation appears to be related to the initial degree of hypoxemia and the presence of abnormal pulmonary function."

The monitor was not disturbed by differing hematocrit levels, the presence of fetal hemoglobin, or hypotension. We also found that the results of simultaneous transcutaneous arterial hemoglobin oxygen saturation (StcaO2) and transcutaneous oxygen tension (PtcO2) monitoring were predictably correlated over a wide range of hemoglobin saturations in preterm infants. When StcaO2 was between 80% and 95%, PtcO2 was at a safe level of 40 to 80 torr in 94% of the patients studied. StcaO2 monitoring as an index of arterial oxygenation has several advantages for the preterm infant."

ScO2 was monitored in 15 patients (4 neonates) during and after thoracic interventions or interventions involving manipulation of the liver. Oximetrix ScO2 is not more invasive than a catheter of common stiffness, but the size 4F remains large for neonates. The physiological or pathological signification of its variation has to be deduced from clinical evaluation. Interpretation may be easier during anesthesia and in the absence of sepsis.

CD011912,0,28149925,0,Automated detection of coarctation of aorta in neonates from two-dimensional echocardiograms.,"Coarctation of aorta (CoA) is a critical congenital heart defect (CCHD) that requires accurate and immediate diagnosis and treatment. Current newborn screening methods to detect CoA lack both in sensitivity and specificity, and when suspected in a newborn, it must be confirmed using specialized imaging and expert diagnosis, both of which are usually unavailable at tertiary birthing centers. We explore the feasibility of applying machine learning methods to reliably determine the presence of this difficult-to-diagnose cardiac abnormality from ultrasound image data. We propose a framework that uses deep learning-based machine learning methods for fully automated detection of CoA from two-dimensional ultrasound clinical data acquired in the parasternal long axis view, the apical four chamber view, and the suprasternal notch view. On a validation set consisting of 26 CoA and 64 normal patients our algorithm achieved a total error rate of 12.9% (11.5% false-negative error and 13.6% false-positive error) when combining decisions of classifiers over three standard echocardiographic view planes. This compares favorably with published results that combine clinical assessments with pulse oximetry to detect CoA (71% sensitivity)."

S. A.), which facilitates continuous measurement of central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2), may be useful for surgery for pediatric congenital heart disease. We used PediaSat during a bidirectional Glenn shunt. The patient was a 13-month-old boy. Under a diagnosis of left single ventricle (pulmonary atresia, right ventricular hypoplasia, atrial septal defect) and residual left aortic arch/left superior vena cava, a modified right Blalock-Taussig shunt was performed. Cyanosis deteriorated, so a bidirectional Glenn shunt was scheduled. After anesthesia induction, a 4.5 Fr double-lumen (8 cm) PediaSat was inserted through the right internal jugular vein for continuous ScvO2 monitoring. Furthermore, the probe of a near-infrared, mixed blood oxygen saturation-measuring monitor was attached to the forehead for continuous monitoring of the regional brain tissue mixed blood oxygen saturation (rSO2) (INVOS™ 5100C, Covidien; Boulder, CO, U. S. A.). Blockage of the right pulmonary artery and right superior vena cava decreased the oxygen saturation, ScvO2, and rSO2, but increased the central venous pressure. Although changes in ScvO2 were parallel to those in rSO2, the former showed more marked changes. A combination of ScvO2 and rSO2 for monitoring during Glenn shunt may be safer."
CD011912,0,55525,0,Right atrial partition and right ventricular exclusion: another surgical approach for complex cyanotic congenital heart disease.,"A 5-year-old child with asplenia, situs inversus, single ventricle, common atrium, severe subvalvular pulmonary stenosis, 1-transposition of the great arteries, and absent inferior vena cava presented with severe limitation (resting arterial saturation 74 per cent). At operation, the systemic venous atrium was partitioned with a Dacron baffle, so that hepatic venous and coronary sinus blood was enabled to drain with the pulmonary venous blood into the single ventricle and aorta. The superior portion of this atrium was anastomosed to the divided main pulmonary artery, so that most of the systemic venous blood was allowed to flow directly to the lungs. Intraoperative hemodynamic studies revealed a pulmonary artery pressure of 12/9 mm. Hg and a superior vena caval flow that was 88 per cent of the ascending aortic blood flow. Follow-up catheterization studies revealed an intact partition, no anastomotic gradient, superior vena cava pressure of 20 mm. Hg, arterial saturation of 84 per cent, and excellent flow of contrast from superior vena cava to atrium to pulmonary artery. Exercise tolerance was markedly improved, and chronic fluid retention was not observed. This operation offers a new alternative for long-term palliation of complex lesions amenable to exclusion of the right ventricle, such as single or common ventricle with unreconstructable anomalies of the atrioventricular valves."
CD011912,0,11155535,0,[Regional transcranial oximetry with near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) in comparison with measuring oxygen saturation in the jugular bulb in infants and children for monitoring cerebral oxygenation].,"Using a dual channel near infrared (NIR) in vivo optical spectroscopy (INVOS) system (INVOS 3100A, Somanetics Corp. Troy, MI, USA) we investigated the relationship between jugular venous oxygen saturation (SjvO2) and regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO2) in 30 infants and children (mean age 4.5 years) with congenital heart disease undergoing cardiac catheterisation. The NIRS-SomaSensor (emitter and dual receiver probe) was applied at a standardised right fronto-temporal location (over the right frontal cortex) on the infant's head and covered with an adhesive flexible bandage. Using NIR light (730 and 810 nm) and two source-detector spacings (3 and 4 cm from the transmitter), percentage values of rSO2 were calculated from detected haemoglobin saturations. Simultaneously, jugular venous oxygen saturation (SjvO2) monitoring was performed via a catheter placed in the right internal jugular vein with its tip positioned in the jugular bulb, as verified by fluoroscopy. To compare the reliability of NIRS measurement characteristics, jugular venous blood was analysed for SjvO2 as a reference measure of global cerebral oxygenation, by co-oximetry (OSM3-Hemoximeter, Radiometer Copenhagen, Denmark). Other measured variables included pulse oximetry, arterial blood pressure, and venous and arterial oxygen saturations. Over a jugular venous oxygen saturation range of 31-83%, a significant positive linear correlation was found between rSO2 (NIRS measurement) and SjvO2 (jugular bulb oximetry) (r = 0.93, p < 0.001). No significant correlation was observed between rSO2 values and arterial blood saturation or pulse oximetry. The quantitative correlation between rSO2 (haemoglobin oxygenation in a small hemi-elliptical area of the brain) and reference SjvO2 measurement (method for monitoring global cerebral oxygenation) suggests that NIRS measurement with subtraction algorithm should identify predominantly intracranial saturation in the pediatric age group, and will tend to reflect global oxygenation under physiological conditions. Transcranial oximetry using dual receiving channel NIRS offers a noninvasive, real-time, reliable and practicable means of monitoring cerebral haemoglobin oxygenation changes infants and children with cyanotic and noncyanotic congenital heart disease."

CD011912,0,10667726,0,Monitoring regional cerebral oxygen saturation using near-infrared spectroscopy during pulsatile hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass in a neonatal piglet model.,"Impairment of cerebral oxygenation in neonates and infants after hypothermic nonpulsatile cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) support is well documented. The objectives of this study were: 1) using a neonatal piglet model to continuously monitor the regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO2) by near-infrared spectroscopy during pulsatile hypothermic CPB; and 2) to quantify the pulsatile flow in terms of energy equivalent pressure (EEP). After initiation of CPB, all piglets (n = 5) were subjected to 15 minutes of core cooling, reducing the rectal temperature to 25 degrees C, followed by 60 minutes of hypothermic CPB, then 10 minutes of cold reperfusion, and 30 minutes of rewarming. During CPB, mean arterial pressures (MAPs) and pump flow rates were maintained at 40-45 mm Hg and 150 ml/kg/min, respectively. During normothermic CPB, the rSO2 was significantly increased, compared with the pre-CPB level (56.8 +/- 5.2% vs. 41.8 +/- 5.5%, p < 0.01). At the end of cooling, the rSO2 level was 76.8 +/- 8.6% (p < 0.001 vs. pre-CPB). After 60 minutes of hypothermic CPB and 30 minutes of rewarming, the rSO2 level was decreased to 38.6 +/- 4.2%, which was not significantly different compared with the pre-CPB level. The average increase in pressure (from MAP to EEP) was 5 +/- 1%, and the average increase in extracorporeal circuit pressure (from ECCP to EEP) was 13 +/- 2%. This extra pressure may help to provide better regional cerebral oxygen saturation. During pulsatile CPB, there was no rSO2 deficiency in this high flow model. Near-infrared spectroscopy responded well to changes in rSO2 during different stages of these experiments and might be a helpful tool for intraoperative monitoring."

CD011912,0,1101642,0,IV. Evaluation of dichromatic earpiece densitometry in children with left-to-right shunts.,Earpiece densitometry was performed in 60 infants and children with left-to-right cardiovascular shunts. The method was found to possess a high diagnostic sensitivity with respect to identification of the left-to-right shunt. Earpiece densitometry was in this respect clearly superior to conventional method using oxygen saturation figures. Quantitation of pulmonary blood flow by both densitiometric and oxygen content technique in a small number of patients indicates that the dye dilution technique gives values somewhat in excess of the Fick method. It is concluded that quantitation of the magnitude of the left-to-right shunt and pulmonary blood flow is disturbed by the fact that indicator material is recirculated before the ascending limb of the primary curve is fully inscribed.

CD011912,0,7847962,0,Extent of aortopulmonary collateral blood flow as a risk factor for Fontan operations.,"Between November 1987 and January 1990, 33 patients (tricuspid atresia, 9 patients; mitral atresia, 3; single ventricle, 15; others, 6) underwent Fontan operations. The rate of blood flow returning to the heart during aortic cross-clamping was measured as an indication of the extent of development of aortopulmonary collateral arteries. Percent cardiac return (calculated by dividing the blood flow rate returning to the heart by the cardiopulmonary bypass blood flow rate and expressing the value as a percentage), were 1% to 9%, 7 patients; 10% to 19%, 11; 20% to 29%, 9; 30% to 39%, 4; 40% to 49%, 1; and 50% to 59%, 1 patient. Percent cardiac return showed a significant correlation with postoperative mean systemic venous pressure (r = 0.6, p < 0.01). In those patients in whom percent cardiac return was more than 33%, the mean systemic venous pressure after operation was high (more than 17 mm Hg), and none of these patients survived. To predict percent cardiac return preoperatively, the conventional indices of systemic ventricular volume, pulmonary artery area index, arterial blood oxygen saturation, pulmonary blood flow index, and pulmonary vascular resistance were analyzed. None of these showed significant correlation with percent cardiac return. However, all the patients who had a high percent cardiac return (more than 30%) also had both high arterial blood oxygen saturation (more than 75% in room air) and small pulmonary artery area index (less than 55%). In addition, the age at operation showed good correlation (r = 0.6, p < 0.01) to percent cardiac return.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

CD011912,0,22653513,0,Cerebral oximetry monitoring during preoperative phlebotomy to limit allogeneic blood use in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.,"Preoperative phlebotomy can minimize the need for allogenic blood products. Frequently, removed blood is replaced with intravenous fluids to maintain euvolemia (acute normovolemic hemodilution [ANH]). During cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), ANH may present problems when the circuit prime causes further hemodilution and unacceptably low hemoglobin. This investigation aimed to demonstrate that minimum volume replacement after preoperative phlebotomy can be used safely when guided by cerebral oxygenation (rSO(2)) measured by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). This prospective study included patients undergoing surgery for congenital heart disease. After preoperative phlebotomy, fluid replacement was guided by mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate, and rSO(2), which were measured at baseline, immediately after phlebotomy, and 15 and 30 min after phlebotomy. This study enrolled 38 patients ages 3 months to 50 years. Preoperative phlebotomy removed 9.3 ± 2.9 mL/kg of blood, and 5.6 ± 5.1 mL/kg of crystalloid was administered intraoperatively. Within 30 min after phlebotomy, 23 patients had a MAP decrease of 20 % or more from baseline. This fall in MAP coincided with a decrease in rSO(2) of 20 or more at 2 of 114 measured points. Initially, rSO(2) decreased from 74 ± 9 to 68 ± 10 but thereafter remained constant. On five occasions, rSO(2) decreased 20 or more from baseline, but no patient's NIRS value was less than 45. A decrease in rSO(2) occurred more commonly in younger patients and those who had a larger volume of blood removed. Preoperative phlebotomy without significant volume replacement can be performed safely before CPB. Volume replacement may be more appropriately guided by rSO(2) than by hemodynamic variables."

CD011912,0,6858898,0,Cardiovascular effects of breathing 95 percent oxygen in children with congenital heart disease.,"The hemodynamic effects of breathing 95% oxygen were evaluated in 26 children with congenital heart disease. Aortic, pulmonary arterial, right atrial, and pulmonary arterial wedge pressure, aortic and pulmonary artery oxygen saturation, and blood gas, cardiac index, and heart rate were measured in room air and after each patient had breathed 95% oxygen for 10 (n = 26) and 20 (n = 5) minutes. Measurements were repeated with the patient again breathing room air for 10 (n = 11) and 20 (n = 6) minutes. After 10 minutes of 95% oxygen, arterial partial pressure of oxygen increased from 85 +/- 13 to 420 +/- 89 torr (p less than 0.001). Aortic mean pressure increased from 80 +/- 10 to 83 +/- 10 mm Hg (p less than 0.01), and systemic vascular resistance increased from 20 +/- 7 to 26 +/- 8 U (p less than 0.001). The cardiac index decreased by 21% from 3.96 +/- 0.94 to 3.12 +/- 0.74 liters/min/m2 (p less than 0.001) and the stroke index decreased by 11% (p less than 0.001). A 23% decrease in oxygen consumption (p less than 0.001) was observed, and oxygen transport decreased from 763 +/- 179 to 600 +/- 161 ml O2/min/m2 (p less than 0.001). Cardiac index, stroke index, and systemic vascular resistance did not return to normal until 20 minutes after cessation of oxygen breathing. To determine whether reflex bradycardia is responsible for these oxygen-induced hemodynamic changes, heart rate was kept constant by atrial pacing in a second group of 5 patients. In these children, significant decreases in cardiac index, stroke index, and oxygen consumption, and increases in systemic vascular resistance also occurred with 95% oxygen. Thus, in children with acyanotic congenital heart disease, hyperoxia increases aortic pressure and systemic vascular resistance and decreases cardiac index, stroke index, oxygen consumption, and oxygen transport."

The pulmonary time activity curve from the radionuclide study was analysed by the method of gamma variate fits. There was strong correlation between the two techniques; weaker correlation was found when the shunt was at atrial rather than ventricular level. This difference can be explained only by problems with the oximetric rather than the radionuclide technique. Although there are important limitations to the radionuclide method, it is the more precise and less invasive of the two and is to be preferred when the accurate measurement of left to right shunts is required."

We used the core of our fuzzy logic-based weaning platform and further developed parametrizable components for weaning newborns of differing body size and disease-state. The controller was validated on neonates recovering from congenital heart disease (CHD) while receiving synchronous intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV). We wished to compare the efficacy of this controller versus the bedside weaning protocol in children with respiratory syncytial virus pneumonitis/bronchiolitis (RSV) in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). The fuzzy controller evaluated the ""current"" and ""trend"" weaning status of the newborn to quantitatively determine the change in the SIMV integrated ventilatory setting. For the ""current"" status it used heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), tidal volume (VT) and oxygen saturation (SaO2), while for the ""trend"" status the differences of deltaRR/ deltat, deltaHR/ deltat, and deltaSaO2/ deltat recorded between two subsequent time points were utilized. The enumerated vital signs were fuzzified and then probability levels of occurrence were assigned. Individualized ""golden"" goals for SaO2 were set for each newborn. We retrospectively assessed the charts of 19 newborns, 113+/-128 days old, 5,546+/-2,321 gr body weight, weaning for 99+/-46 days, at 2-hour intervals. The SIMV levels proposed by the fuzzy controller were matched to those levels actually applied. In 60% of the time both values coincided. For the remaining 40%, the controller was more aggressive suggesting lower values of SIMV than the applied ones. The Area under the SIMV curves over time was 1,969+/-1,044 for the applied vs 1,886+/-978 for the suggested levels, respectively. The fuzzy controller adjusted for body size and disease-pattern can approximate the actual weaning course of newborns with RSV."

Soon after the examinations, the patient died suddenly during sleep at home. Since autopsy was not performed, a definitive diagnosis could not be made, but right ventricular dysplasia appeared likely.

Repeated balloon inflations cause many episodes of low cerebral oxygen delivery. This study is a prospective study to assess the effects of balloon dilatation on cerebral perfusion and oxygenation. The study included 11 patients scheduled for elective catheterization and balloon dilatation at a university pediatric hospital. Blood flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery (Vmca) and regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO2) were monitored by means of transcranial Doppler sonography and near infrared spectroscopy, respectively. In group 1, consisting of 6 patients without an intracardiac shunt, inflation of the balloon resulted in a decrease in Vmca followed by a minor decrease in rSO2. In group 2, consisting of 5 patients with an interatrial communication, inflation resulted in an increase in right-to-left shunt fraction, arterial desaturation. and a major decrease in rSO2 with minor changes in Vmca. Balloon dilatation causes an important decrease in cerebral oxygen delivery by different mechanisms. This may lead to serious morbidity and even mortality. Neuromonitoring is a useful tool in assessing the cerebral effects of balloon dilatation and brain recovery."

CD011912,0,1953128,0,Partial Fontan: advantages of an adjustable interatrial communication.,"Systemic venous hypertension after the Fontan procedure is a major cause of mortality and morbidity, accounting for 11 of 16 deaths in our series of 228 Fontan procedures. A partial Fontan with a residual atrial septal defect (ASD) would allow controlled right-to-left shunting to reduce venous pressure and improve cardiac output while maintaining a reduced but acceptable arterial oxygen saturation. This allows complete or graded closure of the ASD after the discontinuation of cardiopulmonary bypass in the operating room or at any time in the postoperative period by exposing the snare under local anesthesia. From 1987 to 1990, 36 patients undergoing the modified Fontan procedure had placement of an adjustable interatrial communication. Indications for placement of an adjustable ASD included increased pulmonary artery pressures, increased pulmonary vascular resistance, reactive airway disease, previously increased or unknown pulmonary vascular resistance, small pulmonary arteries, and borderline ventricular function. Fourteen patients had the adjustable ASD closed at the time of operation, 8 patients underwent narrowing, and 12 underwent closure of the ASD in the postoperative period. Eight patients were discharged with the ASD partially open, and 2 patients underwent delayed closure. The partial Fontan with an adjustable ASD may increase the safety of the Fontan procedure for high-risk groups such as those with increased pulmonary vascular resistance, pulmonary hypertension, and impaired left ventricular function and for infants, who tolerate venous hypertension poorly. The ability to adjust the ASD in stages depending on the hemodynamic response increases flexibility and safety."
CD011912,0,671169,0,Noninvasive estimation of arterial oxygenation in newborn infants.,"Two noninvasive methods of estimating arterial oxygenation were compared in a group of 48 infants ranging in birth weight from 870 to 4,000 gm, with diagnoses including apnea of prematurity, hyaline membrane disease, meconium aspiration, and congenital heart disease. Both transcutaneous oxygen measurements and ear oximetry gave reasonably accurate estimations of arterial oxygen levels within commonly used clinical ranges (PO2 50 to 70 mm Hg, arterial saturation 90 to 98%). Infants with shock demonstrated a wide range of values for transcutaneous oxygen levels, suggesting that this method has limited usefulness in this situation. Ear oximetry had limited ability to distinguish high, but safe, levels of arterial oxygen from excessively elevated levels. While neither method can be recommended for replacement of arterial oxygen sampling, both methods may be useful in a clinical setting if care is exercised in interpretation of the results and if the values obtained are checked against those from arterial blood."

CD011912,0,352532,0,Shunt quantification by mathematical analysis of indicator dilution curves.,"Mathematical models are presented for describing and analyzing indicator dilution curves recorded in patients with intracardiac and great vessel shunts. The models treat individual segments of the circulation as linear system blocks, each having, at its output, a characteristic time response to a rapid injection of indicator at its input. These blocks are combined in feedback and feed-forward configurations to simulate left-to-right, right-to-left, and bidirectional shunts. A shunt analysis algorithm, using discrete analogs of the linear system models, was implemented in a computer program and used to analyze thermodilution curves recorded in patients with congenital heart defects. Results are presented comparing shunt fractions obtained from thermodilution curve analyses with oximetrically determined values in 20 patients. Comparing left-to-right shunts measured by the two methods, the mean systematic difference was 0.7% of pulmonary flow and the standard deviation was 7.6% of pulmonary flow. Statistical validation of the bidirectional shunt method will require acquisition and analysis of more data; however, reasonable shunt fractions were computed in five cases studied and good agreement with oximetric determinations was obtained in two cases where complete oximetric data were available."

This study reports on pregnancy outcomes after the atrial repair of transposition of the great arteries. Record review and standardized questionnaires were used to ascertain the outcomes of 70 pregnancies reported in 40 women (36 Mustard procedures, 4 Senning procedures). Of the 70 pregnancies, 54 resulted in 56 live births, 10 in miscarriages, and 6 in therapeutic abortions. At pregnancy, 31 women were in New York Heart Association class I, 8 were in class II, and 1 was in class III. Thirty-nine percent of the infants were delivered prematurely and weighed 2,714 +/- 709 g; 28% were delivered by cesarean section, 8 for cardiac indications. Maternal complications included arrhythmias in 5 women and hemoptysis in 2 women. Heart failure occurred in 6 women, developing during the second and third trimesters. Postpartum cardiac events developed 2 to 9 days postpartum: heart failure in 5 women, atrial fibrillation in 1 woman, and decreased oxygen saturation due to a new atrial baffle leak in 1 woman. Severe right ventricular (RV) failure led to cardiac transplantation after delivery in 1 woman; another developed heart failure and then died suddenly 1 month after delivery. There was 1 late death, 4 years after the patient's last pregnancy. In conclusion, pregnancy after atrial repair carries a moderate degree of risk and should be undertaken with caution."

CD011912,0,2151973,0,[Pulse oximetry for noninvasive oxygen monitoring during dental treatment in children with congenital heart disease].,"Children with congenital heart disease (CHD) are prone to present abrupt changes in cardiovascular functions which cause hypoxic spells or acute heart failure, so that oxygen monitoring during dental treatment is of great importance in cyanotic CHD patients. Monitoring of arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2) by pulse oximetry has several advantages, including rapid response time, freedom from skin injury, self-calibration and continuous readout of the SpO2 value. In these studies, SpO2 was measured in 68 pediatric patients (55 were CHD children and 13 were normal children) during dental treatment at the Pediatric Dentistry, Hokkaido University Dental Hospital. In all of the normal patients, SpO2 did not desaturate less than 95%. On the other hand, SpO2 ranged from 56% to 98% in CHD patients, and in 22% (n = 12) of these, SpO2 desaturated below 80%. All of the SpO2 less than 80% patients had been diagnosed as cyanotic CHD. Classification of CHD cases (n = 144, the total number of measurements) on the pattern of the SpO2 variation revealed that in 11% (n = 16) of the CHD cases, SpO2 decreased during dental treatment. Twelve of these 16 cases could not readily accept dental treatment. We suggest that behavior management is the most important factor in CHD patients for keeping SpO2 stable. Motion artifact of the SpO2 value, which was easily evoked when a patient bent his elbow or shook his finger, often made the pulse oximetry useless. In our studies, the SpO2 value sometimes became inaccurate in fearful infants or handicapped patients. Pulse waveform displayed on the front panel of pulse oximetry was useful to identify the motion artifact. We conclude that pulse oximetry is an appropriate apparatus for continuous arterial oxygen monitoring in pediatric patients during dental treatment as far as motion artifact is effectively eliminated."
CD011912,0,16933075,0,An evaluation of acid-base changes following aortic cross-clamping using transcutaneous carbon dioxide monitoring.,"To investigate the cause of acidosis following release of an aortic cross-clamp, we measured tissue PCO2 using a transcutaneous (TC) CO2 monitor placed below the level of the cross-clamp in 10 patients undergoing aortic arch surgery. Following placement of the aortic cross-clamp, the TC CO2 value from the lower extremity increased from 41 +/- 4 to 92 +/- 41, whereas there was no change in the TC CO2 value from the upper extremity. With release of the cross-clamp, end-tidal CO2 increased by 6.2 +/- 1.9 mmHg, the upper TC CO2 increased by 8.4 +/- 4.8 mmHg, and the lower extremity TC CO2 value returned to baseline. During cross-clamping, there was an increase in the base deficit of 4.3 +/- 2.9 when comparing the baseline arterial blood gas value with the one obtained after cross-clamp release (p = 0.0004). These data demonstrate that the acidosis occurring during aortic cross-clamping is a mixed metabolic and hypercarbic acidosis. Appropriate treatment includes the provision of adequate minute ventilation to ensure CO2 removal and the use of sodium bicarbonate based on the degree of metabolic acidosis demonstrated by arterial blood gas analysis."

CD011912,0,26734736,0,Legal and Ethical Considerations in Allowing Parental Exemptions From Newborn Critical Congenital Heart Disease (CCHD) Screening.,"Critical congenital heart disease (CCHD) screening is rapidly becoming the standard of care in the United States after being added to the Recommended Uniform Screening Panel (RUSP) in 2011. Newborn screens typically do not require affirmative parental consent. In fact, most states allow parents to exempt their baby from receiving the required screen on the basis of religious or personally held beliefs. There are many ethical considerations implicated with allowing parents to exempt their child from newborn screening for CCHD. Considerations include the treatment of religious exemptions in our current legal system, as well as medical and ethical principles in relation to the rights of infants. Although there are significant benefits to screening newborns for CCHD, when a parent refuses for religious or personal beliefs, in the case of CCHD screening, the parental decision should stand."

CD011912,0,20054528,0,Postoperative use of oral sildenafil in pediatric patients with congenital heart disease.,"We sought to determine the efficacy of postoperative oral sildenafil therapy (OST) in pediatric patients with congenital heart disease (CHD). A retrospective review of 45 postoperative patients with CHD who received OST was performed. Patients were categorized into three groups according to clinical indications: (1) to stabilize pulmonary vascular reactivity after biventricular repair (group 1 [n = 15]), (2) to lower pulmonary vascular resistance after bidirectional cavopulmonary shunt (group 2 [n = 12]), and (3) to improve post-Fontan hemodynamics (group 3 [n = 18]). Thirty-four patients (34 of 45 [75.6%]) had received inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) while on OST. Mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP), mean systemic blood pressure (mSBP), and peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) were recorded during the first 24 hours after the initiation of OST. In group 1, the baseline mPAP/mSBP ratio (0.60 +/- 0.17) decreased significantly after the second (0.46 +/- 0.14, p = 0.004) and fourth (0.50 +/- 0.18, p = 0.025) doses of OST. In group 2, baseline SpO(2) (71.0 +/- 12.3%) increased after the fourth dose (75.1 +/- 12.3%, p = 0.04) of OST, without significant changes in mPAP. In group 3, baseline mPAP (14.8 +/- 3.3 mmHg) decreased significantly after the first (13.9 +/- 2.8 mmHg, p = 0.025) and second (13.3 +/- 1.9 mmHg, p = 0.016) doses of OST, without changes in SpO(2). In thirty-one (31 of 34 [92%]) subjects, iNO was discontinued within a median of 2 days after the initiation of OST, without rebound phenomena. There were no OST-related complications. Sildenafil citrate can be used safely in postoperative pediatric patients with CHD. Benefits from OST may be manifested differently in various clinical settings."

Very few cases have been reported in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). We present a case of complete CHB associated with a complex congenital heart defect in a neonate in Cameroon. A 1-month-old neonate in Cameroon was referred for the evaluation of bradycardia. The obstetrical ultrasound done during pregnancy revealed fetal bradycardia without further evaluation. Clinical examination showed well a developed neonate with bradycardia at 62 beats/minute, and mild cyanosis with oxygen saturation at 93% at room air. There were no signs of heart failure. Twelve lead electrocardiogram (ECG) demonstrated a complete atrioventricular conduction block with a junctional escape rhythm at 59/minute, left axis deviation and bi-ventricular hypertrophy. Two-dimensional echocardiography revealed a complex congenital heart disease with the following abnormalities: dextrocardia, complete atrioventricular canal with a single atrium and mild atrioventricular valve regurgitation and malposition of the great vessels with a posterior aorta and an anterior pulmonary artery. This case report highlights the challenges in the diagnosis and management of complex CHBs in low resource settings. A properly performed pregnancy follow-up with serial echocardiograms could aid in antenatal diagnosis and plan perinatal management when appropriate in order to optimize outcome.

Postoperative cardiac catheterisation was carried out in 10 patients including successful balloon angioplasty of the shunt and LPA in one patient. There was a significant improvement in oxygen saturation and a drop in haematocrit level at follow-up. Doppler echocardiography studies in 13 patients revealed functioning shunts in all cases with low velocity continuous flow. Thus BDG is a useful palliative procedure and could be undertaken as the first stage of total cavopulmonary connection in high-risk Fontan groups where biventricular repair is not feasible.

In children presumed iron sufficient and with oxygen saturation greater than 75%, multiple regression analysis showed that age (p less than 0.0001) and oxygen saturation (p less than 0.0001) were associated with hemoglobin. Significant correlations between hemoglobin and oxygen saturation were present for children less than 2 years (r = -0.50) and 2-11 years (-0.48), but not for patients greater than 11 years.

The reported sensitivities in asymptomatic patients have been less than expected and vary widely, bringing into question the reliability of the test. The purpose of this study was to assess whether routine pulse oximetry contributes to identifying patients with critical congenital heart disease and to determine the reliability of a single pulse oximeter reading in screening asymptomatic newborn infants. Between December 26, 2003, and December 31, 2005, three hospitals in west central Florida performed a pulse oximetry routinely on all newborns at the time of discharge. Patients diagnosed with critical congenital heart disease during the study period were identified to assess whether the pulse oximetry reading initiated their diagnosis. In one hospital, the pulse oximeter data were evaluated for reliability. Downloaded data were compared to a log compiled by the nursery personnel, first without (phase 1) and then with (phase 2) their knowledge and additional training. Results were characterized as reliable, probe placed but reading not verifiable, or no evidence of probe placement. Of the 7962 infants who received oximetry testing, there were 12 postnatal diagnoses of critical congenital heart disease. None was initially identified by routine pulse oximetry. Pulse oximetry reliability improved substantially between phase 1 and phase 2 (38 v. 60%, p < 0.0001). Optimal reliability (>95%) was obtained by a nurse with a degree of LPN or higher performing an assessment of at least 360 seconds. Routine pulse oximetry was neither reliable nor an important diagnostic tool in our cohort. Important human factors (probe placement time, oximetry training, and nursing degree) impact single determination pulse oximetry reliability. With routine surveillance and quality improvement, the reliability of this test can be increased. Future studies to determine the effectiveness of pulse oximetry screening for the diagnosis of congenital heart disease in the asymptomatic newborn population must address these factors. Until such a study demonstrates acceptable sensitivity and clinical value, universal screening should not be instituted."
CD011912,0,12753453,0,A combined stage 1 and 2 repair for hypoplastic left heart syndrome: anaesthetic considerations.,Therapy of hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) consists of the staged Norwood procedure or cardiac transplantation. Stenting the ductus arteriosus and subsequent banding of the pulmonary arteries allows the combination of neoaortic reconstruction with the establishment of a bidirectional cavopulmonary connection (combined stage 1 and 2 procedure) in a later session. We report the anaesthetic management in eight infants ranging from 107 to 195 days undergoing a combined stage 1 and 2 procedure. Nonselective pulmonary vasodilators and nitric oxide were needed in all cases to improve oxygen saturation in the postbypass period. Phosphodiesterase inhibitors and epinephrine were required in all patients for inotropic support during and after weaning off cardiopulmonary bypass. The procedure was successful in seven patients. One patient died intraoperatively because of right heart failure. The physiological changes of this new surgical strategy for palliation of HLHS offers a challenge for the anaesthetist primarily in the early postbypass period.

CD011912,0,26343176,0,Mesenteric near-infrared spectroscopy and risk of gastrointestinal complications in infants undergoing surgery for congenital heart disease.,"We hypothesised that lower mesenteric near-infrared spectroscopy values would be associated with a greater incidence of gastrointestinal complications in children weighing <10 kg who were recovering from cardiac surgery. We evaluated mesenteric near-infrared spectroscopy, central venous oxygen saturation, and arterial blood gases for 48 hours post-operatively. Enteral feeding intake, gastrointestinal complications, and markers of organ dysfunction were monitored for 7 days. A total of 50 children, with median age of 16.7 (3.2-31.6) weeks, were studied. On admission, the average mesenteric near-infrared spectroscopy value was 71±18%, and the systemic oxygen saturation was 93±7.5%. Lower admission mesenteric near-infrared spectroscopy correlated with longer time to establish enteral feeds (r=-0.58, p<0.01) and shorter duration of feeds at 7 days (r=0.48, p<0.01). Children with gastrointestinal complications had significantly lower admission mesenteric near-infrared spectroscopy (58±18% versus 73±17%, p=0.01) and higher mesenteric arteriovenous difference of oxygen at admission [39 (23-47) % versus 19 (4-27) %, p=0.02]. Based on multiple logistic regression, admission mesenteric near-infrared spectroscopy was independently associated with gastrointestinal complications (Odds ratio, 0.95; 95% confidence interval, 0.93-0.97; p=0.03). Admission mesenteric near-infrared spectroscopy showed an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.76 to identify children who developed gastrointestinal complications, with a suggested cut-off value of 72% (78% sensitivity, 68% specificity). In this pilot study, we conclude that admission mesenteric near-infrared spectroscopy is associated with gastrointestinal complications and enteral feeding tolerance in children after cardiac surgery."

Test accuracy can be influenced by targets definition, gestational age, timing of screening and antenatal detection of CCHD. Early screening can lead to more false positive screenings, but has the potential to detect significant pathology earlier. There is no apparent difference in accuracy between screening with post-ductal measurements only, compared with screening using pre-ductal and post-ductal measurements. However, adding pre-ductal measurements identifies cases of CCHD which would have been missed by post-ductal screening. Screening at higher altitudes leads to more false positives. Important non-cardiac pathology is found in 35-74% of false positives in large studies. Screening is feasible in neonatal intensive care units and out-of-hospital births. Training caregivers, simplifying the algorithm and using computer-based interpretation tools can improve the quality of the screening. Caregivers need to consider all aspects of screening to enable them to choose an optimal protocol for implementation of CCHD screening in their specific setting."
CD011912,0,10409597,0,Postnatal hemodynamic changes in very-low-birthweight infants.,"The purpose of this study was to characterize postnatal changes in regional Doppler blood flow velocity (BFV) and cardiac function of very-low-birthweight infants and to examine factors that might influence these hemodynamic changes. Mean and end-diastolic BFV of the middle cerebral and superior mesenteric arteries, cardiac output, stroke volume, and fractional shortening were measured in 20 infants birthweight 1,002 +/- 173 g, gestational age 28 +/- 2 wk) at 6, 30, and 54 h after birth and before and after feedings on days 7 and 14. Postnatal increases in cerebral BFV, mesenteric BFV, and cardiac output were observed that were not associated with changes in blood pressure, hematocrit, pH, arterial PCO(2), or oxygen saturation. The postnatal pattern of relative vascular resistance (RVR) differed between the cerebral and mesenteric vasculatures. RVR decreased in the middle cerebral but not the superior mesenteric artery. Physiological patency of the ductus arteriosus did not alter postnatal hemodynamic changes. In response to feeding, mesenteric BFV and stroke volume increased, and mesenteric RVR and heart rate decreased. Postprandial responses were not affected by postnatal age or the age at which feeding was initiated. However, the initiation of enteral nutrition before 3 days of life was associated with higher preprandial mesenteric BFV and lower mesenteric RVR than was later initiation of feeding. We conclude that in very-low-birthweight infants over the first week of life 1) systemic, cerebral, and mesenteric hemodynamics exhibit region-specific changes; 2) asymptomatic ductus arteriosus patency and early feedings do not significantly influence these postnatal hemodynamic changes; and 3) cardiac function adapts to increase local mesenteric BFV in response to feedings."

CD011912,0,27468253,0,Pulse oximetry screening: a review of diagnosing critical congenital heart disease in newborns.,"Congenital heart disease (CHD) is one of the most common birth defects, with an incidence of nine out of every 1,000 live births. The mortality of infants with CHD has decreased over the past 3 decades, but significant morbidity and mortality continue to occur if not diagnosed shortly after birth. Pulse oximetry was recommended as a screening tool to detect critical CHD in 2011 by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Heart Association. Pulse oximetry is a tool to measure oxygen saturation, and based on the presence of hypoxemia, many cardiac lesions are detected. Due to its ease of application to the patient, providing results in a timely manner and without the need for calibrating the sensor probe, pulse oximetry offers many advantages as a screening tool. However, pulse oximetry has also important limitations of which physicians should be aware to be able to assess the significance of the pulse oximetry measurement for a given patient. This review aims to highlight the benefits and shortcomings of pulse oximetry within the context of screening for critical CHD and suggests future avenues to cover existing gaps in current practices."
CD011912,0,15474777,0,Unsuspected neonatal killers in emergency medicine.,"A neonate presenting to the emergency department can present a challenge to even the most experienced clinician. This article has focused on four deceiving and potentially devastating neonatal diseases. 1. Neonatal herpes is a potentially devastating illness without pathognomonic signs or symptoms. Early recognition and therapy can reduce mortality markedly. Although no specific sign or symptom is diagnostic,the diagnosis should be strongly considered in the presence of HSV risk factors, atypical sepsis, unexplained acute hepatitis, or focal seizure activity. Acyclovir therapy should be initiated before viral dissemination or significant CNS replication occurs. 2. Pertussis is a disease in which infants are at greatest risk of death or severe complication. Neonatal pertussis often presents in an atypical manner, lacking the classic signs and symptoms such as the ""whoop.""More common signs and symptoms include cough, feeding difficulty,low-grade fever, emesis, increasing respiratory distress, apnea, cyanosis,and seizures. Management should include hospitalization, supportive care, and antibiotics. 3. Congenital heart defects, particularly ductal-dependent lesions, may have an initial asymptomatic period that culminates in a rapidly progressive and fatal course. A neonate with CHD presents with shock refractory to volume resuscitation or pressor support. Resuscitative efforts are ineffective unless PGE, is administered. 4. Inborn errors of metabolism often are unsuspected because of their protean and heterogeneous nature. Signs and symptoms are subtle,are nonspecific, and often mimic other, more common diseases.An elevated index of suspicion, along with application and correct interpretation of a select few laboratory tests, is the key to making a diagnosis. Therapy is relatively straightforward and focused on resuscitation followed by prevention of catabolism and correction of specifically identified abnormalities. Although these disorders are relatively uncommon, prompt diagnosis and therapy can lead to a decrease in morbidity and mortality. The key is to maintain a high index of suspicion."
CD011912,0,20019198,0,Fetal cardiac screening: why bother?,"Congenital heart disease (CHD) is a common form of congenital malformation associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Antenatal diagnosis of life-threatening forms of CHD may help to improve survival and morbidity as well as allowing parental choice and preparation. The diagnosis of CHD during fetal life can be made with a very high level of diagnostic accuracy in tertiary centres dealing with high-risk pregnancies. However, most cases of CHD will occur in low-risk groups and will only be detected by screening at the time of obstetric ultrasound scans. The concept of antenatal screening for CHD was introduced in the UK over 20 years ago, and current national guidelines recommend that the heart should be examined at the time of the obstetric anomaly scan. However, there remains a large regional variation in prenatal detection rates of CHD. Widespread teaching and training is required to achieve a more uniform standard but this will be associated with significant resource implications."
CD011912,0,1513163,0,The influence of pulmonary artery banding on outcome after the Fontan operation.,"Thirty-eight patients were selected from a total of 120 patients who underwent the Fontan operation between 1974 and 1988. They were classified into two groups. Group 1 consisted of 18 patients with previous pulmonary artery banding at a mean age of 7 months (2 days to 59 months), and group 2 comprised 20 patients with native pulmonary stenosis. In group 1, 10 children had tricuspid atresia (seven with normally connected and three with transposed great arteries), six had double-inlet ventricle, and two had complex heart malformations. Group 2 consisted of 12 patients with tricuspid atresia and normally connected great arteries, six with double-inlet ventricle, and two with complex malformations. The following clinical and hemodynamic parameters at cardiac catheterization and cineangiocardiography were determined in both groups before the Fontan operation: age and body surface area, hemoglobin concentration and hematocrit value, atrial and pulmonary artery pressures, end-diastolic pressure of the systemic ventricle, arterial oxygen saturation, pulmonary/systemic flow ratio, end-diastolic volume, ejection fraction and mass of the systemic ventricle, cardiac index, and Nakata index. After the Fontan operation in all patients, the presence or absence of pericardial and pleural effusions, ascites, protein-losing enteropathy, and liver and kidney dysfunction was assessed and the clinical status was classified according to New York Heart Association criteria. All preoperative and postoperative parameters were tested for differences between the two groups, and they were compared with normal values. Hematocrit value was higher in group 2 than in group 1 (57.8% versus 53.1%; p less than 0.05). Ventricular mass index was increased in group 1 when compared with group 2 (125.8 gm/m2 versus 87 gm/m2; p less than 0.05). Severe pericardial effusions in the early postoperative period were significantly more frequent in group 1 and were particularly prevalent in the subgroup with long-standing pulmonary artery banding (p less than 0.01). Subaortic stenosis was observed more frequently in group 1. The remaining parameters were not statistically different between the two groups. We conclude that the significant increment in ventricular mass after pulmonary artery banding may represent a risk for unfavorable outcome after the Fontan operation, which increases with time. Therefore, long-standing pulmonary artery banding as a palliative procedure for candidates for the Fontan operation should be avoided."
CD011912,0,1760182,0,Comparison of intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography to epicardial imaging in children undergoing ventricular septal defect repair.,"Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography was compared with epicardial echocardiography after ventricular septal defect repair. This comparison was made in 18 children aged 7 to 137 months (median, 32 months), weighing 6.3 to 49.1 kg (median, 10.8 kg) from November 1989 to January 1991. Ventricular septal defect types were perimembranous (six), malalignment (seven), supracristal (three), midmuscular (one), and inlet (one). Eight children had isolated ventricular septal defects, four had tetralogy of Fallot, three had double outlet right ventricle, two had double chambered right ventricle, and one had pulmonary stenosis. Patch interrogation was complete in 17 of 18 transesophageal echocardiography and 16 of 18 epicardial echocardiography studies. Inability to fully interrogate the ventricular septal defect patch by epicardial echocardiography occurred in two children as a result of anterior ventricular septal defect location, limited epicardial exposure, and surgical hardware interference. Incomplete transesophageal echocardiography patch interrogation occurred in the child with the midmuscular ventricular septal defect. Seven residual ventricular septal defects were documented by color flow Doppler in six patients. Five of seven residual defects were demonstrated by both real-time transesophageal echocardiography and epicardial echocardiography imaging. Transesophageal echocardiography and epicardial echocardiography missed 1 and 7 defects, respectively. The missed defects were different with each technique and were confirmed by postoperative surface echocardiography. No residual defects of sufficient size to require reoperation were found as determined by combination color flow jet analysis and intraoperative oximetry (no pulmonary to systemic flow ratio was greater than 1.50). Patches caused two-dimensional and Doppler signal masking, but this was not limiting because all residual defects were found at the margins of the ventricular septal defect patch.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD011912,0,12500624,0,[Pregnancy and congenital heart disease].,"Congenital cardiopathies currently represent the majority of cardiac anomalies observed during pregnancy. The latter leads to significant haemodynamic modifications which can sometimes be poorly tolerated in the case of severe cardiopathy. However, as a rule pregnancy is generally well supported if the functional state of the patient beforehand is satisfactory (class I or II of the NYHA). The type of cardiopathy also plays a role. Left-right shunts tolerate pregnancy well in most cases. On the other hand severe aortic stenoses expose serious complications. Above all it is the cyanogenic cardiopathies which are poorly tolerated by the mother and the fetus, and more so the lower the oxygen saturation. Eisenmenger's syndrome causes a major risk to life for the young mother and is a formal contra-indication to pregnancy, as is pulmonary arterial hypertension. Patients with a Fontan anastomosis or an intra-atrial repair of transposition of the great vessels can support pregnancy very well if the systemic ventricle has good function. In Marfan's syndrome the aortic diameter is the essential prognostic element. In most congenital cardiopathies pregnancy nevertheless has a favourable outcome for the mother and infant. Vaginal delivery should be the rule. A close cardio-obstetric collaboration is the principal condition to allow the young cardiac female to well endure a pregnancy."

CD011912,0,12463838,0,Fuzzy logic controller for weaning neonates from mechanical ventilation.,"Weaning from mechanical ventilation is the gradual detachment from any ventilatory support till normal spontaneous breathing can be fully resumed. To date, we have developed a fuzzy logic controller for weaning COPD adults using pressure support ventilation (PS). However, adults and newborns differ in the pathophysiology of lung disease. We therefore used our fuzzy logic-based weaning platform to develop modularized components for weaning newborns with lung disease. Our controller uses the heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), tidal volume (VT) and oxygen saturation (SaO2) and their trends deltaHR/deltat, deltaVT/deltat and deltaSaO2/deltat to evaluate, respectively, the Current and Trend weaning status of the newborn. Through appropriate fuzzification of these vital signs, Current and Trend weaning status can quantitatively determine the increase/decrease in the synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV) setting. The post-operative weaning courses of 10 newborns, 82+/-162 days old, were assessed at 2-hour intervals for 68+/-39 days. The SIMV levels, proposed by our algorithm, were matched to those levels actually applied. For 60% of the time both values coincided. For the remaining 40%, our algorithm suggested lower SIMV support than what was applied. The Area Under the Curve for integrated ventilatory support over time was 1203+/-846 for standard ventilatory strategies and 1152+/-802 for fuzzy controller. This suggests that the algorithm, approximates the actual weaning progression, and may advocate a more aggressive strategy. Moreover, the core of the fuzzy controller facilitates adaptation for body size and diversified disease patterns and sets the premises as an infant-weaning tool."

CD011912,0,8366562,0,[Anesthetic management of a neonate with critical pulmonary valve stenosis for balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty].,"We administered general anesthesia for balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty (BPV) to a 19 day-old male infant, weighing 2,789g, with critical pulmonary stenosis. The patient had severe cyanosis and mild right heart failure. Atropine (0.01 mg.kg-1) was administered intravenously immediately before induction of anesthesia. Pancuronium (0.4 mg) was used to facilitate endotracheal intubation and for the subsequent control of ventilation. Anesthesia was maintained with oxygen and enflurane (0.25 approximately 0.5%) supplemented with intravenous administration of fentanyl (1.5 micrograms.kg-1). During catheterization for balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty, SpO2 and blood pressure decreased temporarily to 35% and 50 mmHg, respectively. Several side effects of balloon inflation have been reported, such as bradycardia, arrhythmia, and the decrease in systemic blood pressure and arterial oxygen saturation, mainly due to the occlusion of pulmonary blood flow. Therefore, it might be recommended that BPV should be performed under stable state of general anesthesia with continuous monitorings of especially ECG, arterial blood pressure, central temperature, SpO2, ETCO2 and urine output."

CD011912,0,7236462,0,Factors influencing survival after balloon atrial septostomy for complete transposition of great arteries.,"Despite balloon atrial septostomy within the first days of life, some patients with complete transposition of the great arteries die before reaching elective definitive surgery in the second six months of life. To discover why, we analysed the fate of 144 patients who had balloon atrial septostomy after 1966, using a modified logrank survival test with multivariate capability. Patients were withdrawn ""alive"" on reaching definitive surgery. The following largely independent factors were associated with a statistically significant excess mortality: pulmonary hypertension, the presence and size of a ventricular septal defect of persistent ductus arteriosus, relative anaemia, absence of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, low arterial oxygen saturation, aortic stenosis and coarctation, and balloon atrial septostomy between 1 week and 1 month of life. Those of the above factors which can be determined at balloon atrial septostomy or at routine cardiac catheterisation at 3 months of age were then introduced into discriminant function analysis on survival to 6 months. Hence the probability of any individual patient dying in the first six months was calculated, allowing for these factors. This prediction was correct in 76 per cent of the patients studied. By offering earlier definitive correction to patients thus identified as being at high risk of premature death, it should prove possible to reduce overall mortality in transposition of the great arteries."

The present study was undertaken to investigate some aspects of glomerular function by measuring urinary total protein, microalbumin, and tubular function by assessing urinary alpha-1-microglobulin. The structural integrity of the renal proximal tubules was also studied by measuring urinary activities of the brush-border enzyme leucine-aminopeptidase and the lysosomal enzyme -acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase. The levels of hematocrit (Hct) and oxygen saturation were also investigated as predisposing factors for renal impairment in CCHD."
CD011912,0,8069991,0,Pulmonary hypertension and pregnancy: a series of eight cases.,"This is the report of a series of eight patients with pulmonary hypertension (primary and secondary) who delivered at the McMaster University Medical Centre between 1978 and 1987. Seven of the eight patients delivered vaginally and had a successful outcome. The eighth patient was admitted as an emergency and died shortly after Caesarean section under general anaesthesia, performed to save the infant. The other seven patients were all managed by a team, including anaesthetists, cardiologists and obstetricians, from about 25 wk. The patients were hospitalized pre-partum and received oxygen therapy and anticoagulation with heparin. Analgesia in labour was managed, once anticoagulation was reversed, by low concentrations of epidural bupivacaine (0.125%-0.375%) and fentanyl. The patients were monitored during labour and delivery with oximetry and arterial and central venous pressure lines. Pulmonary arterial lines were not used because of increased risk and questionable usefulness. Vaginal delivery was managed with vacuum extraction or forceps lift-out to minimize the stress of pushing. After delivery, all patients were monitored in an intensive care unit for several days, anticoagulation was restarted, and all patients were discharged home taking oral anticoagulant therapy. The successful management of pulmonary hypertension in pregnancy should include team management started early in pregnancy and controlled vaginal delivery utilizing epidural analgesia."
CD011912,0,7247545,0,Glenn shunt: long-term results and current role in congenital heart operations.,"Fifty cyanotic patients (aged 2 days to 22 years) underwent Glenn shunts for tricuspid atresia and other cyanotic heart defects. Thirteen of 15 operative deaths occurred in infants less than 4 months old, and only 1 death has occurred in the last 9 years. Results were poor in patients with Ebstein's anomaly, truncus arteriosus, transposition of the great vessels, and complex defects other than tricuspid atresia and univentricular heart. Of the 35 patients followed from 0.9 to 14.8 years, 12 were followed for more than 10 years. None of the 11 late deaths could be attributed to complications of the shunt. Minimal evidence of intrapulmonary shunting was found by angiography, pulmonary venous oximetry, or radioisotopic studies. Late deterioration due to venous collaterals and decreased flow to the opposite lung necessitated Blalock-Taussig shunts in 6 and Fontan procedures in 10. All survived the Fontan procedures with minimal morbidity. These data support the concept that Glenn shunts do not necessarily result in pulmonary abnormalities and may be indicated as a staged procedure in a few selected patients prior to a Fontan procedure."

One patient died late postoperatively from noncardiac causes. The 21 survivors are clinically well, and in 20 complete hemodynamic and electrophysiologic data were obtained by cardiac catheterization a mean of 13 months after repair. All patients have normal systemic arterial oxygen saturation. Left ventricular function and pulmonary artery pressures are normal in all. None had pulmonary venous obstruction. Narrowing at the junction of the superior vena cava and systemic venous atrium with mean pressure differences of 5 mm Hg or more was found in 4 of the 20 patients, but was clinically manifest in only 1 patient. No abnormality of atrioventricular conduction was seen in response to programmed electrical stimulation. Sinus node dysfunction was present in 6 patients, with abnormalities of both automaticity and sinoatrial conduction. Among these 6 patients were the 5 who were younger than 5 months at operation. The Senning procedure generally results in excellent hemodynamic and electrophysiologic status in patients who undergo operation after the newborn period. Identification of sinus node dysfunction, seen in patients in whom the procedure is performed in the first few months of life, is of concern and identifies a need for close follow-up of sinus node function in this cohort of patients."
CD011912,0,1266719,0,Percutaneous balloon atrial septostomy in infants with transposition of the great arteries.,"Initial experience with PBAS in early management of neonate with TGA is described. Standard percutaneous techniques were used and modified by a series of dilations designed to introduce a septostomy catheter into the femoral vein. Thirty infants with TGA were catheterized, and PBAS was accomplished in 25. The mean aortic oxygen saturation rose from 55 to 72 per cent. Twenty-four infants were clinically palliated for at least 3 months; however, five required pre-elective surgery thought due to inadequate atrial mixing. No severe complications followed PBAS. Twenty-three patients underwent follow-up catheterization, in 17 through the vein used for PBAS. When compared to patients with TGA who had cutdown insertion of balloon septostomy catheters, the group treated by PBAS was similar in patient material, and successful septostomy. Those ballooned percutaneously had fewer complications and required slightly less time for the procedure. We feel that PBAS is a relatively easy and safe palliative procedure when performed in an infant with TGA. It should be considered by all those performing percutaneous diagnostic catheterization in infants and children."
CD011912,0,25900899,0,"Preoperative Physiology, Imaging, and Management of Transposition of the Great Arteries.","Transposition of the great arteries (TGA) refers to hearts with concordant atrioventricular connections but discordant ventriculoarterial connections. In this lesion, the aorta arises from the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery arises from the left ventricle. As such, the pulmonary and aortic circulations run in parallel as opposed to in series, and this lesion is not compatible with survival without adequate mixing of these circulations. The management and outcomes of TGA parallels the field of pediatric cardiac surgery itself. Uniformly fatal in childhood, palliative procedures from the 1950s to 1970s offered survival, albeit at a high early and late cost. In the 1970s, the arterial switch operation (ASO) provided an anatomical ""cure,"" with survival to adulthood in the current era of around 90%. Detailed perioperative imaging, attention to associated lesions, and comprehension of the physiology are critical to medical and surgical management."
CD011912,0,866697,0,Neurological and electroencephalographic changes in newborns treated with prostaglandins E1 and E2.,"Six newborns with obstructive right heart lesions were examined neurologically and electroencephalographically during treatment with prostaglandin (PG) E1 or E2 given to maintain patency of the ductus arteriosus and to increase pulmonary blood flow. PG was administered intravenously or intraarterially in the aortic isthmus proximal to the ductus arteriosus. Besides a rise in arterial oxygen saturation, all patients had some sign of central nervous system involvement. The electroencephalogram showed minor changes suggestive of sedation. In addition, three patients in whom PG was given intravenously presented various combinations of neurological abnormalities (""myoclonic jerks"", apnoeic spells, hiccup) of subcortical origin. Side-effects subsided after stopping the treatment and posed no problem in the management of the patients. These findings confirm the usefulness and safety of the PG therapy and indicate that the intraaortic route of administration is preferable."

However, none of these studies focused on extracorporeal life support after failure of high frequency ventilation (HFV). In the present study, we determined variables associated with survival for pediatric respiratory failure patients who received HFV prior to extracorporeal life support, using data reported to the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization Registry from 1992 to 1998. Patients with neonatal diagnoses, immune compromising conditions, or congenital cardiac defects were excluded. The 243 patients who met inclusion criteria had a 58% survival rate (95% CI 48-66%). The mean age was 22 +/- 39 months. Mean duration of mechanical ventilation prior to extracorporeal life support was 6.6 +/- 5.8 days. Venoarterial extracorporeal life support was used in 72% of the patients; venovenous in 28%. The survival rate for the subset of patients with an oxygenation index greater than 42 cm H2O/torr on HFV (n = 122) was not significantly different from the overall sample. We determined that lower mean airway pressure, lower pressure amplitude, decreased oxygenation index, increased PaO2, and increased oxygen saturation on HFV were associated with increased survival in patients who were subsequently treated with extracorporeal life support."

We herein discuss the echocardiographic features of APVS, compare its two subtypes, and clarify some differences between APVS and TOF. From July 1998 to October 2011, 31 patients diagnosed with APVS at Fuwai Hospital underwent echocardiography, computed tomography, or cardiac angiography. APVS was clinically categorized as either infant-type or child-type. We compared the echocardiographic similarities and differences between APVS and TOF and between the two subtypes of APVS. Although enlargement or aneurysmal dilatation was present in the main pulmonary artery (PA) and its branch in most patients, pulmonary dysplasia or even an absent left PA was found in a few patients. Four important echocardiographic features of APVS useful for distinguishing this syndrome from TOF were (1) absence of the pulmonary valve or presence of pulmonary valve dysplasia, (2) concurrent stenosis and regurgitation at the pulmonary annulus, (3) significant aneurysmal dilatation in the areas of the PAs, and (4) increased rather than decreased PA pressure. 10 patients had infant-type APVS and 21 had child-type APVS. Compared with child-type APVS, infant-type APVS was usually characterized by a lower oxygen saturation, more dilated main PA and right PA, lower aorta-PA ratio, higher diastolic PA pressure, and lower incidence of an absent left PA. Echocardiography is important for diagnosing APVS and distinguishing it from TOF. There are minimal differences in the echocardiographic features between infant-type and child-type APVS."

These 2 babies were anesthetized during the first 3 weeks of life, one for patent ductus arteriosus ligation and the other for ventriculo-peritoneal derivation. SaO2 was maintained between 85-95% in the straight portion of hemoglobin dissociation curves, where PaO2 values are from 7 to 10 KPal. During anesthesia, FiO2 was kept between 21 and 30%. Oximeters which have a fast response time seem to be a useful tool for monitoring blood oxygenation when it is difficult to estimate normoxia but very important to avoid hypoxia or over-oxygenation."

Few data exist on its off-label use in paediatric patients. We therefore performed a systematic review updated in September 2013 of all the published articles describing the use of levosimendan in paediatric patients. We identified 24 studies published in the period 2004-2013 that included a total of 623 patients, the largest one being a case series of 293 patients. Most of the patients underwent cardiac surgery, other settings consisting of chronic heart failure, primary congenital heart diseases and sepsis and cancer-associated cardiac dysfunction. Most studies reported improvement in ventricular function, central venous oxygen saturation, serum lactate levels or cardiac index. The 5 randomized studies published so far have all been performed in cardiac surgery and suggest a beneficial effect on hemodynamic data with no effect on intensive care unit stay, hospital stay or survival. Side effects (e.g. hypotension) were reported. This inodilator merits to be investigated with further randomized trials focusing on clinically relevant outcomes."

CD011912,0,7942530,0,Maturational and hemodynamic factors predictive of increased cyanosis after bidirectional cavopulmonary anastomosis.,"Bidirectional cavopulmonary anastomosis (BCA) is thought to be beneficial in the palliation of patients with univentricular congenital heart disease considered at high risk for Fontan repair. Experience with patients undergoing BCA suggested that those who were older or larger at the time of surgery tended to be more cyanotic postoperatively than their younger and smaller counterparts. This study was designed to identify correlates of systemic arterial oxygen saturation after BCA. Specifically, it was postulated that maturational changes in blood flow distribution might be associated with decreasing arterial oxygen saturation. Database records of all 110 patients undergoing BCA at our institution from June 1988 until the end of 1991 were reviewed. Postoperative catheterization data were available for 66 patients. Twenty-one patients were excluded because they had potentially reversible causes of cyanosis yielding inestimable degrees of error in hemodynamic calculations. In the remaining 45 patients, univariate and multivariate regression analyses were used to identify correlates of systemic arterial oxygen saturation. Growth and maturation as represented by body surface area exhibited a highly significant inverse correlation with arterial oxygen saturation (p = 0.005), as did pulmonary vascular resistance (p = 0.003). Patients who underwent BCA when > 3.9 years of age or with body surface area > 0.65 m2 were at significantly increased risk for excessive postoperative cyanosis, defined as systemic arterial oxygen saturation < or = 75% (p < 0.005). The interval between surgery and catheterization correlated directly with arterial oxygen saturation (p = 0.002), indicating a tendency toward earlier study of more cyanotic patients. None of the other variables examined correlated significantly with arterial oxygen saturation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

CD011912,0,8249850,0,Hydrogen inhalation for detecting intracardiac left-to-right shunting in adults.,"The hydrogen inhalation technique is easily performed and exquisitely sensitive for detecting intracardiac left-to-right shunting. Previous studies of this technique relied heavily on data from infants and children, and the distinction between ""normal"" and ""abnormal"" was imprecise and somewhat arbitrary. The present study was done to assess the results of hydrogen inhalation in adults with and without intracardiac left-to-right shunting. In 45 adult subjects (15 men, 30 women, aged 18 to 72 years) (18 without and 27 with intracardiac left-to-right shunting), the elapsed time from hydrogen inhalation to its appearance in the pulmonary artery was measured. The 18 patients without shunting had an appearance time of 12 +/- 3 (mean +/- SD) seconds, and it was > or = 9 seconds in all. In contrast, the 27 subjects with shunting had an appearance time of 1.5 +/- 0.7 second, with only 1 of 27 being > or = 3 seconds. There was no relation between the magnitude of left-to-right shunting and the hydrogen appearance time. Thus, the hydrogen inhalation technique easily and reliably separates adult subjects with and without intracardiac left-to-right shunting, with no overlap between the 2 groups."
CD011912,0,7460252,0,Oral prostaglandin E2 in ductus-dependent pulmonary circulation.,"Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) was administered orally, in doses of 12-65 microgram/kg at intervals of 1-4 hours, to 12 neonates in whom the pulmonary circulation depended on patency of the ductus arteriosus. After an oral dose, both oxygen saturation (SaO2) and plasma PGE2 concentration increased consistently within 15-30 minutes, reaching values comparable to those during i.v. infusions. Treatment continued for 5 days to 4 months. In eight infants, PGE2 withdrawal resulted in a decrease of SaO2, from a mean of 75 +/- 7% to 57 +/- 10% (+/- SD). The ductus remained responsive for long periods--in four infants, for over 3 months. Consequently, surgery could be delayed until the infants and their pulmonary arteries had grown. Side effects during oral therapy were similar to those during i.v. infusion but were less severe in this series. The effectiveness and simplicity of oral PGE2 administration have advantages over i.v. administration, especially for long-term treatment."

Median age at operation was 20 months (range, 9 months to 19 years). Median follow-up time after the bidirectional Glenn operation was 4 years (range, 1 day to 11 years). The early mortality rate was 4/45 (8.9%); overall mortality was 24.4%. Actuarial survival after a bidirectional Glenn shunt was 73% +/- 8% at 5 years and 55% +/- 17% at 10 years. In multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis, heterotaxy syndrome and systemic right ventricle were independent predictors of mortality after the bidirectional Glenn shunt. Age at operation, oxygen saturation, previous surgery, a pulsatile Glenn shunt, cardiopulmonary bypass, postoperative pulmonary artery pressure, bilateral superior venae cavae, and Nakata index were not predictive of mortality. The presence of heterotaxy syndrome and systemic right ventricle in patients with a functional univentricular heart should lead to aggressive investigation and management strategies."

CD011912,0,8431577,0,Accuracy of pulse oximetry in children with cyanotic congenital heart disease.,"The use of a pulse oximeter to monitor arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) is considered accurate and reliable in the range of 90% to 100%. However, differing reports exist about the accuracy with desaturation. Thus, the suitability of pulse oximetry in desaturated patients was evaluated using a Nellcor N-100 oximeter. In 56 children with cyanotic congenital heart disease, the pulse oximeter reading was compared with the direct measurement of SaO2 by a CO-oximeter OSM 3. The influence of high hematocrit values on the accuracy at low saturation was also investigated. All oxygen saturation measurements (two per child) were carried out after induction of anesthesia (ketamine, fentanyl, pancuronium) during a ""steady state"" before the surgical procedure. The results indicate that at low levels of saturation (SaO2 below 80%), pulse oximetry is not as accurate as at higher saturations, and overestimates the true value. Bias and precision between saturations measured by the pulse oximeter and the CO-oximeter were 5.8 and 4.8 in the group with a saturation below 80%, and 0.5 and 2.5 in the group with a saturation over 90%, respectively. Because the margin of safety for a patient is small when arterial saturation levels are under 80%, it is advisable under this condition to check the SaO2 measurements by a CO-oximeter. High hematocrit levels did not seem to be responsible for impaired accuracy of pulse oximetry at saturation values below 80%."
CD011912,0,6700216,0,Creation of left-to-right shunts in the newborn pig: a new model.,"The closer to birth that congenital heart defects are simulated, the more valid the model. Unlike obstructive lesions such as pulmonic and aortic stenosis, which can be constructed in utero or in infancy, left-to-right shunts are more difficult to create due to the extreme friability of fetal and neonatal tissue. A method for creating left-to-right shunts in infant pigs using a pleural-sparing transverse sternotomy and direct side-to-side anastomosis between the redundant pulmonary artery and the ascending aorta has been introduced. The pigs developed palpable thrills, systolic and diastolic flow murmurs, and congestive heart failure. The average pulmonary-to-systemic flow ratio by the microsphere technique was 2.1:1 compared to 2.1:1 by oximetry. Left-to-right shunts can be constructed in infant pigs to simulate congenital heart defects."
CD011912,0,7957368,0,Effects of repeated indomethacin administration on cerebral oxygenation and haemodynamics in preterm infants: combined near infrared spectrophotometry and Doppler ultrasound study.,"The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effect of repeated indomethacin administration on cerebral oxygenation in relation to changes in cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) and other relevant physiological variables. Fourteen preterm infants with patent ductus arteriosus were studied during three subsequent indomethacin bolus administrations with intervals of 12 and 24 h. Changes in concentration of oxyhaemoglobin (cO2Hb), deoxyhaemoglobin (cHHb) and oxidized cytochrome aa3 (cCyt.aa3) in cerebral tissue and changes in cerebral blood volume (CBV) were measured by near infrared spectrophotometry; changes in mean CBFV in the internal carotid artery were measured by pulsed Doppler ultrasound. Simultaneously heart rate, transcutaneous pO2 and pCO2, arterial O2 saturation and blood pressure were measured. All variables were continuously recorded until 60 min after indomethacin administration. Within 5 min after each indomethacin administration, significant decreases in CBFV, CBV and cO2Hb and cCyt.aa3 were observed which persisted for at least 60 min, while cHHb increased or did not change at all. There were no changes in the other variables recorded. These data demonstrate that indomethacin administration is accompanied by a reduction in cerebral tissue oxygenation due to decreased cerebral blood flow. Therefore, low arterial oxygen content, either caused by low arterial O2 saturation or by low haemoglobin concentration, may be a contraindication for indomethacin treatment in preterm infants."
CD011912,0,6459278,0,Two-stage anatomic correction of complete transposition of the great arteries: ventricular volumes and muscle mass.,"Between 1976 and 1981, 27 patients with complete transposition of the great arteries, ranging from one month to 2 1/2 years, underwent two-stage anatomic correction and 7 patients first-stage operation only. There were three early deaths after the first-stage and five after the second-stage operation and no late deaths. In seven patients the results of repeat cardiac catheterization including quantitative analysis of ventricular angiocardiograms at the different stages of the procedure were available. In these patients peak systolic pressure in the left ventricle rose to systemic levels after banding of the pulmonary artery. Left ventricular end-diastolic and stroke volumes decreased to normal levels without significant reduction of arterial oxygen saturation. One to 2 1/2 years after anatomic correction left and right ventricular function was normal, as judged by normal end-diastolic pressure, ejection fraction and ratio left ventricular muscle volume/end-diastolic volume. Minimal aortic regurgitation in five patients, mild mitral insufficiency in two and a small VSD in two contributed to elevated end-diastolic volumes of the left ventricle, observed in six patients, and of the right ventricle, found in two patients.

We advise a strict monitoring of arterial oxygen tension (Pao2), preferably by a non-invasive technique and rapid resetting of the ventilator as indicated by changes in pulmonary compliance and lung aeration after surfactant administration. The goal should be to minimize the risks of air leakage, left-to-right shunt, and overloading of the pulmonary circulation.

Recently, the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) recommended that screening for CCHD be added to the uniform screening panel. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has been a strong advocate of early detection of CCHD and fully supports the decision of the Secretary of HHS. The AAP has published strategies for the implementation of pulse oximetry screening, which addressed critical issues such as necessary equipment, personnel, and training, and also provided specific recommendations for assessment of saturation by using pulse oximetry as well as appropriate management of a positive screening result. The AAP is committed to the safe and effective implementation of pulse oximetry screening and is working with other advocacy groups and governmental agencies to promote pulse oximetry and to support widespread surveillance for CCHD. Going forward, AAP chapters will partner with state health departments to implement the new screening strategy for CCHD and will work to ensure that there is an adequate system for referral for echocardiographic/pediatric cardiac evaluation after a positive screening result. It is imperative that AAP members engage their respective policy makers in adopting and funding the recommendations made by the Secretary of HHS."
CD011912,0,1372914,0,Decreased serum insulin-like growth factor-I associated with growth failure in newborn lambs with experimental cyanotic heart disease.,"To determine whether chronic hypoxemia results in alterations in endocrine function that may contribute to growth failure, we measured growth hormone (GH), somatomedins (insulin-like growth factors I and II, IGF-I and IGF-2), hepatic growth hormone receptors, and circulating IGF-binding proteins IGFBP-3 and IGFBP-2 in 12 newborn lambs with surgically created pulmonic stenosis and atrial septal defect, and in 10 controls. During chronic hypoxemia (oxygen saturation of 60-74% for 2 wk), weight gain was 60% of control (hypoxemic, 135 +/- 20 vs. control, 216 +/- 26 g/d, P less than 0.02). IGF-I was decreased by 43% (hypoxemic 253.6 +/- 29.3 SE vs. control 448.0 +/- 75.5 ng/ml, P = 0.01), whereas GH was unchanged (19.9 +/- 5.1 vs. 11.9 +/- 3.0 ng/ml, NS). The increase in IGF-1 was associated with a decrease in IGFBP-3 (hypoxemic, 5.09 +/- 1.25 vs. control, 11.2 +/- 1.08 arbitrary absorbency units per mm (Au.mm), P less than 0.01), and increase in IGFBP-2 (0.47 +/- 0.03 vs. 0.19 +/- 0.13 Au.mm, P less than 0.05), but no significant downregulation of hepatic GH receptors (hypoxemic, 106.1 +/- 20.1 vs. control, 147.3 +/- 25.9 fmol/mg, NS). Thus, chronic hypoxemia in the newborn is associated with a decrease in IGF-I and IGFBP-3 in the face of normal GH. This suggests peripheral GH unresponsiveness, similar to protein-calorie malnutrition or GH receptor deficiency dwarfism, but mediated at a level distal to the hepatic GH receptor."
CD011912,0,21422511,0,Automatic detection of apnoea of prematurity.,"The detection of the incidents of apnoea of prematurity (AP) in preterm infants is important in the intensive care unit, but this detection is often based on simple threshold techniques, which suffer from poor specificity. Three methods for the automatic detection of AP were designed, tested and evaluated using approximately 2426 h of continuous recording from 54 neonates (μ = 44 h and σ = 7 h). The first method was based on the cumulative sum of the time series of heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR) and oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) along with the sum of their Shannon entropy. The performance of this method gave 94.53% sensitivity, 74.72% specificity and 77.84% accuracy. The second method was based on the correlation between the time series of HR, RR and SpO(2), which were used as inputs to an artificial neural network. This gave 81.85% sensitivity, 75.83% specificity and 76.78% accuracy. The third method utilized the derivative of the three time series and yielded a performance of 100% sensitivity, 96.19% specificity and 96.79% accuracy. Although not optimized to work in real time, the latter method has the potential for forming the basis of a real time system for the detection of incidents of AP."

In many forms of congenital heart disease, the presence of an appropriate interatrial shunt is critical. After the first several weeks of life, balloon atrial septostomy is not effective, and success with other methods is limited. Clinical records, echocardiograms, and catheterization data in patients who had an atrial septal stent placed between 2001 and 2004 at UCLA were reviewed. Changes in atrial pressures and systemic saturations were analyzed. Follow-up data and explant pathology were reviewed as available. Thirteen patients had stenting of the atrial septum (four restrictive, nine nonrestrictive). In patients with elevated right and left atrial pressures, there was a mean reduction of 2.4 and 7.4 mm Hg in right atrial and left atrial pressures, respectively. In patients with transposition physiology, there was a mean increase in oxygen saturation of 11.3%. Follow-up echocardiograms revealed patent stents with excellent position relative to the atrial septum. In six cases, the stents were removed during subsequent surgery and appeared endothelialized and patent. Stenting of the atrial septum is safe and effective in selected cases, allowing for a reliable, long-lasting, restrictive or nonrestrictive interatrial communication."

One hundred nine patients were females and 92 were males--age of presentation varied from 3 months to 62 years (mean +/- standard deviation 19.23 +/- 12.62 years). A total of 12 different anatomic lesions were seen--the most common three being ventricular septal defect (33.33%), aterial septal defect (29.85%), and patent ductus arteriosus (14.23%). History, physical examination, chest skiagram and electrocardiogram established only the presence of pulmonary arterial hypertension except where differential cyanosis indicating ductus was discernible or the degree of splitting of second heart sound provided some clue to the level of shunt. Contrast echocardiography, completed in 25.4% established the level of shunt in all patients. In others the diagnosis was confirmed by cardiac catheterisation.

Mean age at operation was 49.5 +/- 43 months (ranging from 10 months to 12.5 years). Mean weight was 13.5 +/- 6.5 kg (range 6.2 to 30 kg) and mean body surface area was 0.6 +/- 0.2 m2. Mean preoperative hematocrit value was 47.6% +/- 11.1%, and mean preoperative arterial oxygen saturation ratio was 75.7 +/- 9.5. Six patients (30%) had prior systemic-pulmonary arterial shunts. Pulmonary arterial stenoses were congenital or iatrogenic (or both) and were located principally on the left pulmonary artery (63%), on the pulmonary bifurcation (15%), or separately on the left and right pulmonary arteries (21%). In all children the pulmonary arterial tree was repaired with the patient's own pedicled pericardium. Mean follow-up is 36 +/- 25.2 months (range 1 to 71 months). Hospital mortality rate was 0%. There was one late death, and two children were lost to long-term follow-up. No child required reoperation. Seventeen children returned for evaluation, consisting of physical examination, electrocardiogram, chest roentgenogram, and Doppler echocardiogram, and 11 underwent late catheterization or magnetic resonance imaging of the chest to evaluate the pulmonary arterial repair. All children were in New York Heart Association class I or II. Right ventricular function was normal by echocardiography in 100% with a mean right ventricular systolic pressure of 39.37 +/- 8.4 mm Hg. Mild to moderate pulmonary regurgitation was present in the majority of patients. The results of pulmonary arterial repair were good in 100%. There was no residual stenosis, and we observed uniform enlargement of the repaired pulmonary arteries over a 5-month to 6-year follow-up period. These results are of particular interest inasmuch as other materials previously used for repair of pulmonary arteries do not grow and may even shrink, resulting in residual stenosis."

We performed total cavopulmonary connection with baffle fenestration in five patients under four year of age (33 month of mean age at operation). All patients previously underwent palliative surgery (Blalock shunt in 3, PA banding in 2). Three patients weighed less than 10 kg. Pulmonary vascular resistance index (PARI) were 2.03 +/- 0.18 U/BSA and exceeded 2 U/SQm in 3 patients. Nakata's indice were ranged from 282 to 644 (mean 394) mm2/BSA. Bidirectional cavopulmonary shunt was considered to be alternative pathway for three patients in staged Fontan strategy. Postoperative hemodynamics were relatively stable in all patients and weaned from mechanical ventilation within 5 days with various arterial oxygen saturation. There was no pleural effusion lasting longer than 1 week. One patient died of ileus caused from congenital malrotation. Follow up catheter examination at 1 year showed 83 to 96% of SaO2 and survived patients were doing well.

CD011912,0,10973368,0,Palliative balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty in tetralogy of fallot: echocardiographic predictors of successful outcome.,"Although balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty (BPV) has been advocated as a means of palliating patients with tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), the results of this procedure were not uniformly good in this patient population. The purpose of this study was to review our institutionOs experience with BPV in patients with TOF, and to determine whether echocardiographic criteria exist that may be used to identify patients likely to derive prolonged benefit from this procedure. Between 1991 and 1999, nine patients with TOF, ages 0. 4Eth 26.1 weeks (mean, 7.4 +/- 7.6 weeks) underwent BPV due to cyanosis and other associated medical conditions (e.g., coronary artery anomalies, small size) that rendered immediate surgical intervention undesirable. Data from the catheterization and pre-BPV echocardiograms were analyzed. All patients had at least transient improvement in oxygen saturation. However, 4 patients (Group 1) required intervention (1 open-heart repair, 3 palliative shunts) within 5 weeks of BPV due to recurrent desaturation. In the remaining 5 patients (Group 2), open-heart repair was delayed 8Eth 36 weeks (mean, 23 +/- 13 weeks). Groups 1 and 2 did not differ regarding pulmonary valve annulus, main pulmonary artery or branch pulmonary artery diameter. However, the diastolic diameter of the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) was significantly smaller in Group 1 (18.3 +/- 3.5 mm/m2 versus 24.4 +/- 4.1 mm/m2 in Group 2; p < 0.05). Four out of five patients with a RVOT diameter < 23 mm/m2 were in Group 1, and all patients with RVOT diameter greater than 25 mm/m2 were in Group 2. We conclude that BPV can effectively palliate patients with TOF whose RVOT diastolic diameter is > 25 mm/m2. However, patients with a diastolic RVOT diameter < 23 mm/m2 are unlikely to have sustained improvement following BPV."
CD011912,0,15296623,0,Pulse oximetry in children with congenital heart disease: effects of cardiopulmonary bypass and cyanosis.,"The objective of this prospective, observational study with consecutive sampling was to assess the reliability, bias, and precision of Nellcor N-395 (N) and Masimo SET Radical (M) pulse oximeters in children with cyanotic congenital heart disease and children with congenital heart disease recovering from cardiopulmonary bypass-assisted surgery admitted to a cardiovascular operating suite and pediatric intensive care unit at a tertiary care community hospital. Forty-six children with congenital heart disease were studied in 1 of 2 groups: (1) those recovering from cardiopulmonary bypass with a serum lactic acid > 2 mmol/L, and (2) those with co-oximetry measured saturations (SaO(2)) < 90% and no evidence of shock. Measurements of SaO(2) of whole blood were compared to simultaneous pulse oximetry saturations (SpO(2)). Data were analyzed to detect significant differences in SpO(2) readout failures between oximeters and average SpO(2) - SaO(2) +/- 1 SD for each oximeter. A total of 122 SaO(2) measurements were recorded; the median SaO(2) was 83% (57 - 100%). SpO(2) failures after cardiopulmonary bypass were 41% (25/61) for N versus 10% (6/61) for M (P < .001). There was a significant difference in bias (ie, average SpO(2) - SaO(2)) and precision (+/- 1 SD) between oximeters (N, 1.1 +/- 3.3 vs M, -0.2 +/- 4.1; P < .001) in the postcardiopulmonary bypass group but no significant difference in bias and precision between oximeters in the cyanotic congenital heart disease group (N, 2.9 +/- 4.6 vs M, 2.8 +/- 6.2; P = .848). The Nellcor N-395 pulse oximeter failed more often immediately after cardiopulmonary bypass than did the Masimo SET Radical pulse oximeter. SpO2 measured with both oximeters overestimated SaO2 in the presence of persistent hypoxemia."
CD011912,0,8758560,0,[Percutaneous pulmonary valvuloplasty in neonates and infants with tetralogy of Fallot].,"Percutaneous pulmonary valvuloplasty remains controversial as a palliative procedure in Tetralogy of Fallot. This paper reports the results of this technique with respect to clinical improvement and growth of the pulmonary arterial tree. Between June 1990 and July 1995, valvuloplasty with a balloon catheter was performed in 25 neonates or infants with Tetralogy of Fallot (13 girls and 12 boys). All patients were symptomatic with severe cyanosis associated with anoxic malaise in 14 cases. At catheterisation, the children were aged 3.5 +/- 2.6 months and weighted 4.7 +/- 1.2 kg. After dilatation, cutaneous oxygen saturation increased from 75 +/- 11 to 88 +/- 8% (p = 0.001). However, 3 children were referred for early surgery (one complete correction and two systemico-pulmonary anastomoses because of persistent desaturation. There were no lethal complications. A control (catheterisation or surgery) allowed evaluation of the growth of the pulmonary tract, on average 5.5 +/- 4.3 months after dilatation. The pulmonary artery diameter increased from 6.17 +/- 1.26 mm to 8.66 +/- 1.22 mm (p = 0.0015). Expressed as a Z score, the annulus diameter changed from -3.93 +/- 0.91 to -2.54 +/- 1.2 SD (p = 0.0019). The mean Z score of the right pulmonary artery increased from -3.01 +/- 0.69 to -1.98 +/- 1.12 SD (p = 0.0251) and the Z score of the left pulmonary artery from -2.68 +/- 0.85 to -1.61 +/- 1.46 SD (p = 0.0357). At complete correction, 50% of patients had had correction of their malformation without section of the pulmonary annulus. In conclusion, pulmonary valvuloplasty in Tetralogy of Fallot enables growth of the annulus and pulmonary arteries and is a valuable alternative to palliative systemico-pulmonary anastomosis."
CD011912,0,8758561,0,[Percutaneous dilatation of the pulmonary tract in tetralogy of Fallot].,"When palliative treatment is indicated in tetralogy of Fallot, percutaneous endoluminal dilatation of the valvular pulmonary stenosis may represent an alternative to palliative surgery (systemico-pulmonary shunt) and its disadvantages. This paper sets out the clinical outcome and growth of the pulmonary arterial circulation after dilatation of the valvular pulmonary stenosis in children with tetralogy of Fallot. Twenty-five children (average age: 8 +/- 5.8 week; average weight: 6.7 +/- 2.4 kg) were included in this study. The dilatation resulted in an immediate decrease in the patients' cyanosis and a significant increase (+10%) in arterial oxygen saturation. However, this technique did not suppress the risk of anoxic malaise. Only 5 children (20%) required a palliative surgical shunt for persistence of anoxic malaise. From the anatomical point of view, the dilatation induced significant growth of the pulmonary annulus (7.6 mm vs 11.3 mm; p < 0.0001), of the main pulmonary artery (6.8 mm vs 10 mm); p = 0.008) and left pulmonary artery (7 mm vs 11 mm; p = 0.02). The need for a procedure to widen the right ventricular outflow tract at the time of complete correction was also reduced. The perioperative mortality of complete correction and postoperative pulmonary insufficiency were decreased. Percutaneous dilatation of the right ventricular outflow tract is therefore a valuable palliative alternative to surgical sytemico-pulmonary shunt."

Upon initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), the patient developed carboxyhemoglobinemia (11.1%). Potential sources for the unexpected acquired carboxyhemoglobinemia were sought quickly. Testing of residual blood from the unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) used to prime the CPB circuit revealed a carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) of 15.1 %. A decrease in cerebral oximetry (rSO(2)) on CPB was initially felt to be a result of the elevated COHb levels. When ventilation of the oxygenator with 100% oxygen (O(2)) failed to decrease COHb levels, a partial exchange transfusion was performed with reduction in COHb to 7.1%. The operation was completed successfully and the patient's COHb levels returned to normal within 75 minutes. Post case analysis of events and data collected during the case revealed a broader differential for explaining the compromised patient's O(2) delivery than the transient acquired carboxyhemoglobinemia. A partial obstruction of the superior vena cava could have triggered the drop in rSO(2) on CPB. Follow-up of the donor blood confirmed the donor had previously undiagnosed carboxyhemoglobinemia as a result of chronic carbon monoxide exposure from a faulty vehicle exhaust system."

Pulse oximetry is one of the most important advances in respiratory monitoring as its readings (SpO(2)) are used clinically as an indirect estimation of arterial oxygen saturation (SaO(2)). Sensors were placed frequently on the sole, palm, ear lobe or toes in addition to finger. On performing an extensive Medline search using the terms ""accuracy of pulse oximetry"" and ""precision of pulse oximetry"", limited data were found in congenital heart disease patients in the immediate post-corrective stage. Also, there are no reports and comparative data of the reliability and precision of pulse oximetry when readings from five different sensor locations (viz. finger, palm, toe, sole and ear) are analysed simultaneously.

The inhalation test was performed by doubling concentrations of histamine solution for 2 min at 1 min intervals. The respiratory threshold of histamine was defined as the minimal concentration causing a drop in transcutaneous oxygen tension greater than 10% from baseline. Six of 10 patients with congenital heart disease and all of 12 patients with bronchial asthma had bronchial hyper-responsiveness to histamine. The mean of histamine concentration was 2750 micrograms/mL and 937 micrograms/mL, respectively. During the histamine inhalation test, respiratory resistance gradually increased in congenital heart disease patients. This was measured by the linear slope of transcutaneous oxygen pressure (-1.08 +/- 0.75 mmHg/min), whereas in the bronchial asthma patients it rapidly decreased at the infection point (-4.19 +/- 1.86 mmHg/min). We conclude that children with congestive heart failure had bronchial hyper-responsiveness. We suggest bronchial hyper-responsiveness to inhaled histamine in congestive heart failure was caused by the gradual increased respiratory resistance, which was different from that of bronchial asthma."

Traditional management strategies have attempted to optimize circulatory efficiency by using arterial oxygen saturation (SaO(2)) as an index of pulmonary/systemic flow balance, attempting to maintain SaO(2) within a theoretically optimal critical range of 75% to 80%. This optimal range of SaO(2) has not been verified clinically, and strategies targeting SaO(2) may be limited by the fact that SaO(2) is a poor predictor of systemic oxygen delivery. We have previously reported higher venous saturation (SvO(2)), lower arteriovenous oxygen content difference, lower systemic vascular resistance, lower pulmonary/systemic flow ratio, and improved survival with the perioperative use of phenoxybenzamine and continuous monitoring of SvO(2). In this investigation, we tested the hypothesis that intense afterload reduction with phenoxybenzamine would modify the SvO(2)-SaO(2) relationship by preventing deterioration of systemic oxygen delivery at high SaO(2)."

The relation between cerebral NIRS readings and vital parameters has not been analyzed before at a fine temporal scale. This study analyzed this relation during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) surgery in 10 children (0-9 years, 1,770 min of data records) by using a novel random-coefficient model. The analysis indicated that a small number of patients is sufficient for obtaining significant results with this model. Changes of vital parameters explained 84.7 % of rSO2 changes and 90.7 % of HbT changes. Cerebral rSO2 correlated positively with perfusion pressure and inversely with body temperature (P < 0.05). Cerebral HbT correlated positively with perfusion pressure, central venous pressure, and temperature and inversely with arterial oxygen saturation (P < 0.05). During hypothermic circulatory arrest, the half-life of the exponential rSO2 decay correlated to the rSO2 reserve (P = 0.016). In conclusion, NIRS readings of cerebral hemoglobin content and tissue oxygen saturation correlate well to vital parameters during CPB surgery in children. NIRS may therefore become a monitoring device for the neuroprotective optimization of those vital parameters."

Accordingly, aside from continuous assessment of heart rate, blood pressure and arterial oxygen saturation, bedside monitoring of major determinants of cardiovascular function of significant clinical relevance such as cardiac output, systemic vascular resistance, organ blood flow distribution and tissue oxygen delivery and coupling has only recently become available. Without obtaining reliable information on the changes in and interactions among these parameters in the neonatal patient population during postnatal transition and later in the neonatal period, development of effective and less harmful treatment approaches to cardiovascular compromise is not possible. This paper briefly reviews the recent advances in our understanding of developmental cardiovascular physiology and discusses the methods of bedside assessment of cardiovascular function in general and organ perfusion, tissue oxygen delivery and brain function in particular in preterm and term neonates. The importance of real-time data collection and the need for meticulous validation of the methods recently introduced in the assessment of neonatal cardiovascular function such as echocardiography, electrical impedance cardiometry, near infrared spectroscopy, visible light and laser-Doppler technology are emphasized. A clear understanding of the accuracy, feasibility, reliability and limitations of these methods through thorough validation will result in the most appropriate usage of these methods in clinical research and patient care."

Two other industry standard oximeters, Nellcor and Ohmeda were also included in our study. We collected data on more than fifty patients on an average of eight hours per patient over a period of four months with major emphasis on low-saturation occurrences. The interpretation of the data was focused more on the realtime response anomalies on random cases than on ensemble statistical data evaluation. We found, that there are few factors in clinical environment which often influences the measurement of a pulse oximeter very strongly. Most often the anomalies were found during low saturation measurement.

After the administration of protamine, arterial oxygen saturation gradually decreased. We suspected that hypotension and decrease in cardiac output induced by protamine caused the decrease in pulmonary blood flow via central shunt. It is suggested that pulmonary blood flow should be maintained by using an inotropic agent and a selective pulmonary arterial dilator such as prostaglandin E1 in a patient with PA + VSD after the institution of aorto-pulmonary shunt, because the patient with excess pulmonary flow has been reported to have high pulmonary resistance due to pulmonary abnormalities such as stenosis and thrombosis."
CD011912,0,9363654,0,Platelet activation in congenital heart diseases.,"The research presented here investigated platelet activation in cyanotic and acyanotic congenital heart diseases (CHD). Children with cyanotic CHD are prone to both thrombosis and hemorrhage. However, patients with acyanotic CHD may also have a mild bleeding disorder. The platelet activation in CHD was investigated in support of a hypothesis that platelet activation may play a role in the hemostatic abnormalities reported in these patients. Platelet activation was determined by using flow cytometry with anti-CD62 monoclonal antibody (mAb), which has been shown to be a specific marker of platelet activation. Thirteen children with cyanotic CHD, 33 children with acyanotic CHD and 17 healthy children serving as controls were studied. Platelet activation was significantly higher in the cyanotic group and also in the acyanotic group compared with the healthy children (P = 0.0000 and P = 0.019, respectively). In the cyanotic group, platelet activation showed a direct correlation with arterial O2 saturation (SaO2) (P = 0.014). There was no correlation between platelet activation and erythrocyte related parameters in either group. Platelet activation occurs in CHD, particularly in patients with cyanotic CHD (even in patients with no evidence of clinical thrombosis) and it may play a role in the pathogenesis of thrombotic disorders seen in these patients."

CD011912,0,25991570,0,Sedation and Anesthesia in Pediatric and Congenital Cardiac Catheterization: A Prospective Multicenter Experience.,"Sedation/anesthesia is critical to cardiac catheterization in the pediatric/congenital heart patient. We sought to identify current sedation/anesthesia practices, the serious adverse event rate related to airway, sedation, or anesthesia, and the rate of intra-procedural conversion from procedural sedation to the use of assisted ventilation or an artificial airway. Data from 13,611 patients who underwent catheterization at eight institutions were prospectively collected from 2007 to 2010. Ninety-four (0.69 %) serious sedation/airway-related adverse events occurred; events were more likely to occur in smaller patients (<4 kg, OR 4.4, 95 % CI 2.3-8.2, p < 0.001), patients with non-cardiac comorbidities (OR 1.7, 95 % CI 1.1-26, p < 0.01), and patients with low mixed venous oxygen saturation (OR 2.3, 95 % CI 1.4-3.6, p < 0.001). Nine thousand three hundred and seventy-nine (69 %) patients were initially managed with general endotracheal anesthesia, LMA, or tracheostomy, whereas 4232 (31 %) were managed with procedural sedation without an artificial airway, of which 75 (1.77 %) patients were converted to assisted ventilation/general anesthesia. Young age (<12 months, OR 5.2, 95 % CI 2.3-11.4, p < 0.001), higher-risk procedure (category 4, OR 10.1, 95 % CI 6.5-15.6, p < 0.001), and continuous pressor/inotrope requirement (OR 11.0, 95 % CI 8.6-14.0, p < 0.001) were independently associated with conversion. Cardiac catheterization in pediatric/congenital patients was associated with a low rate of serious sedation/airway-related adverse events. Smaller patients with non-cardiac comorbidities or low mixed venous oxygen saturation may be at higher risk. Patients under 1 year of age, undergoing high-risk procedures, or requiring continuous pressor/inotrope support may be at higher risk of requiring conversion from procedural sedation to assisted ventilation/general anesthesia."
CD011912,0,24567022,0,Feasibility of critical congenital heart disease newborn screening at moderate altitude.,"Consensus guidelines have recommended newborn pulse oximetry screening for critical congenital heart disease (CCHD). Given that newborn oxygen saturations are generally lower at higher altitudes, the American Academy of Pediatrics and others recommend additional evaluation of the screening algorithm at altitude. Our objective was to evaluate the feasibility of newborn pulse-oximetry CCHD screening at moderate altitude (Aurora, CO; 1694 m). We hypothesized the overall failure rate would be significantly higher compared with published controls."
CD011912,0,23642507,0,Risk factors for profuse systemic-to-pulmonary artery collateral burden in hypoplastic left heart syndrome.,"Risk factors for developing systemic-to-pulmonary artery collaterals (SPCs) in hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) are unknown. We performed a retrospective case-control study to identify risk factors for developing a profuse SPC burden in HLHS. Angiograms of 439 patients with HLHS (performed <2 years of age) were reviewed using a previously published angiographic grading scale to identify cases (profuse SPC burden, n = 20) and controls (no or minimal SPC burden, n = 35). In univariate analyses, profuse SPC burden was associated with mitral atresia and aortic atresia subtype (MA/AA) (65% vs 14%, p <0.0001), use of a Sano shunt (70% vs 37%, p = 0.03), longer log-transformed durations of intensive care unit stay (p = 0.02), hospital stay (p = 0.002), pleural drainage (p = 0.008) after stage 1 palliation, lower oxygen saturation at discharge after stage 1 palliation (82 ± 4 vs 85 ± 4%, p = 0.03), and a history of severe shunt obstruction (37% vs 11%, p = 0.04). In a multivariate logistic regression model, profuse SPC burden was associated with MA/AA subtype (odds ratio 6.6), Sano shunt type (odds ratio 8.6), and log-transformed duration of hospital stay after stage 1 (odds ratio 7.9, model p <0.0001, area under the curve 0.88). Nonassociated parameters included fetal aortic valve dilation, severe cyanotic episodes, number of days with open sternum or number of additional exploratory thoracotomies after stage 1 palliation, pulmonary vein stenosis, and restrictive atrial septal defect. In conclusion, in the present case-control study of patients with HLHS, the development of a profuse SPC burden was associated with MA/AA subtype, Sano shunt type, and longer duration of hospital stay after stage 1 palliation."

CD011912,0,8064584,0,[Balloon atrioseptostomy under color flow Doppler echocardiography guidance].,"The clinical effectiveness and safety of balloon atrioseptostomy (BAS) under color flow mapping Doppler echocardiography (CFM) guidance was evaluated in 21 BAS procedures performed on 19 patients with cyanotic heart disease (d-TGA 15, PA 1, TA 2, Ebstein's anomaly PA + supramitral ring 1) in the cardiac catheterization laboratory (16 patients) or in the intensive care unit (ICU 3 patients). The indication for BAS was established based on CFM diagnosis. BAS was performed with combined CFM and X-ray guidance on 16 patients prior to cardiac catheterization, and with CFM guidance only on 3 patients in the ICU. A series of BAS was performed until satisfactory interatrial opening was obtained and a complete hemodynamic study was performed by CFM and catheterization after BAS, if possible. In all 19 patients BAS was performed very safely with positioning of balloon in the left atrium, selection of appropriate size of balloon, and the confirmation of the effect of BAS provided by CFM guidance at each step. The size of the interatrial opening was significantly increased from 2.6 to 8.1 mm (p < 0.01) after a series of BAS and the arterial oxygen saturation was significantly increased from 44 to 75% (p < 0.01). CFM provides effective diagnosis and guidance for BAS in severely cyanotic neonates with congenital heart disease, and should significantly contribute to the speed, efficacy, and safety of the procedure."
CD011912,0,17165310,0,Pulse oximetry during pulmonary artery banding.,"In children with a ventricular septal defect and congestive heart failure, banding of the pulmonary artery (PA) causes equalization of right and left ventricular pressures, reduces the volume of the left-to-right shunt, and diminishes the work of the left ventricle and the engorgement of the pulmonary vessels. However, banding the PA too tightly usually produces hypoxemia by reversing the left-to-right shunt and causes severe hemodynamic changes. A series of 14 infants is reported who underwent PA banding during which a pulse oximeter was used as an early indicator of excessively tight PA banding. Significant hemodynamic changes occurred in eight infants in whom the PA banding was too tight. This consisted of hypotension and bradycardia three to four minutes after the banding. The eight patients also showed significant desaturation of the blood after application of the band, with the arterial hemoglobin saturation (SaO2) dropping from a preband value of 98 +/- 6% to a postband value of 80 +/- 2%. The decrease in SaO2 preceded the hypotension and bradycardia by two to three minutes in all cases. When the band was removed, the hemodynamic and SaO2 changes returned toward baseline. Subsequently, a less tight band was applied; this was associated with a smaller decrease in SaO2, an elevation of blood pressure, and no bradycardia. This was considered to be acceptable banding. The right ventricle/PA pressure gradient significantly decreased after acceptable banding, and a gradient higher than 45 mmHg was usually associated with hypoxemia."

CD011912,0,8217307,0,[The percutaneous transluminal balloon valvuloplasty of valvular stenosis of the pulmonary artery in treating tetralogy of Fallot as an alternative to the surgery of applying a systemic-pulmonary anastomosis].,"From January 1991 to May 1992 transluminal balloon valvuloplasty [correction of vulvoplasty] of severe valvular stenosis of the pulmonary artery was performed in 14 patients with Fallot's tetrad at the Institute of Cardiovascular Surgery named after A. N. Bakulev. Five of them had pulmonary artery hypoplasia, 2 had stenosis and hypofunction of the systemic-pulmonary anastomosis applied by the Blalock-Taussig, which made them perform balloon angioplasty of the narrowed distal portion of the anastomosis. The patients' age ranged from 11 months to 14 years (mean age 6.8 +/- 1.1 years). Arterial blood oxygen saturation varied from 51 to 72% (mean 69.2 +/- 2.4%). The diameter of a valvular ring was 8-13 mm. The diameter of a balloon catheter exceeded that of the valvular ring by 20-25%. After dilation, arterial blood oxygen saturation increased from 69.86 +/- 2.5 to 85.1 +/- 1.2%. The angiometry performed after pulmonary artery valvuloplasty in patients with pulmonary hypoplasia showed an increase in sizes of all pulmonary arterial segments on an average by 22.5 +/- 4.1%. Later on 5 patients were radically operated on. Thus, with the ultimate goal of preparation of patients with severe Fallot's tetrad for radical surgery, transluminal balloon valvuloplasty in some patients with severe valvular stenosis of the pulmonary artery may be alternative to a systemic-pulmonary anastomosing operation."
CD011912,0,7508001,0,Balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty for infants with severe tetralogy of Fallot.,"Balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty was performed in 3 infants with severe tetralogy of Fallot at days 24, 54 and 86 because of progressive hypoxemia. In two patients, the balloon catheter (4 cm long, 5-8 mm diameter) could not pass through the pulmonary valve. This necessitated a smaller balloon and required a two-step procedure. Initially, a coronary artery balloon (2 cm long, 3.5 mm diameter) was used. Following balloon valvuloplasty, arterial oxygen saturation increased from 63 to 83% in case 1, from 69 to 85% in case 2 and 63 to 86% in case 3. Immediate postvalvuloplasty right ventricular cineangiography revealed that the maximal opening diameter of the pulmonary valve leaflets increased from 1-2 mm to 3-4 mm in cases 1 and 3, and from 2-3 mm to 4-5 mm in case 2. No significant complications occurred. Echocardiographic follow-up data showed that the diameter of the right ventricular outflow tract and pulmonary arteries increased with age. The present results show that the pulmonary valvuloplasty is an effective procedure for relief of pulmonary valve stenosis in tetralogy of Fallot and to improve oxygenation and growth of the pulmonary arteries and right ventricular outflow tract without the need of an immediate aortopulmonary shunt."
CD011912,0,22936600,0,Percutaneous embolization of a giant collateral vessel originating from the azygos vein via the inferior vena cava.,"We present the case of a 45-year-old man with univentricular heart, small outlet chamber, and L-transposition of the great vessels. As an infant, the patient underwent multiple palliative surgical interventions. He presented with worsening dyspnea and fatigue and was found to have systemic oxygen saturation of 85% on 2 L of oxygen by nasal cannula, whereas he had chronically remained between 90 and 95% throughout most of adulthood. There was no evidence of significant valvular regurgitation or stenosis, nor was there an overt intracardiac shunt by echocardiography. Cardiac CT and cardiac MRI revealed a large serpiginous systemic to pulmonary venovenous collateral located behind the left atrium. The collateral drained into the lower right pulmonary vein as it entered the left atrium. The tributary veins to the ""giant"" collateral were determined by these images modalities. The patient underwent a percutaneous embolization of this giant venovenous collateral via a remnant supracardinal vein originating from the infrarenal inferior vena cava using two Amplatzer Vascular Plug II. Immediately after the procedure the patient's oxygen saturation increased to 90% on room air at rest. At 2 months follow-up the patient had a marked clinical improvement with oxygen saturation as high as 95% on room air while walking. Our case illustrates a successful embolization of a giant collateral via an embryological venous remnant connecting the IVC to the azygos system."

We describe the clinical course and results of molecular genetic analysis of a boy who presented after birth with severe cyanosis. Arterial blood-gas analysis demonstrated a pronounced shift of the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve to the right and molecular genetic analysis revealed a γ-globin variant, Hb F-Sarajevo. The patient presented is the second reported case of neonatal cyanosis due to this mutation, which was first described in 2012 by Zimmermann-Baer and coauthors. With the introduction of universal screening for congenital heart disease, the finding of low oxygen saturation will uncover more neonates with hemoglobinopathies with low oxygen affinity."

CD011912,0,1416162,0,Kinetics of cerebral deoxygenation during deep hypothermic circulatory arrest in neonates.,"Brain injury associated with neonatal congenital heart operations performed during deep hypothermia and/or total circulatory arrest is often attributed to cerebral hypoxia. We studied the kinetic changes in cerebrovascular hemoglobin O2 saturation (HbO2%) and total hemoglobin concentration (Hbtotal) in 17 neonates undergoing cardiac surgery as they were cooled to 15 degrees C, underwent total circulatory arrest, and were rewarmed. HbO2% and Hbtotal in brain vasculature were monitored noninvasively by near-infrared spectroscopy. Neonates were cooled over 12 min and rewarmed over 15 min while being perfused using cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Total circulatory arrest lasted from 20 to 70 min. We found that HbO2% in brain vasculature increased during the initial 8 min of CPB as nasopharyngeal temperature decreased, and then remained constant until circulatory arrest. After the onset of circulatory arrest, cerebrovascular HbO2% decreased curvilinearly for 40 min; no further hemoglobin desaturation was observed from 40 to 70 min of arrest. The changes in cerebrovascular Hbtotal were quite different from those in HbO2%, as Hbtotal decreased during the initial minute of CPB and circulatory arrest and then remained constant until recirculation. Brain intravascular HbO2% and Hbtotal increased within 3 min after the onset of recirculation to prearrest levels, and during rewarming, HbO2% decreased to normothermic baseline values. The results demonstrate that cerebral oxygenation increased during CPB cooling; O2 was consumed by the neonatal brain during the initial 40 min of deep hypothermic circulatory arrest; and cerebral oxygenation was restored on recirculation. These observations may be important in identifying the etiologies of brain injury during neonatal congenital heart surgery."
CD011912,0,24193163,0,Effect of positive end-expiratory pressure on ductal shunting and systemic blood flow in preterm infants with patent ductus arteriosus.,"Left to right (L-R) shunting through a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) can reduce systemic and cerebral blood flow in preterm infants. To minimize this, the positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is often raised to increase pulmonary vascular resistance and reduce L-R shunting. The effects of this maneuver on systemic and cerebral hemodynamics and oxygenation are not well documented."
CD011912,0,18793291,0,Surgical closure of the patent ductus arteriosus and its effect on the cerebral tissue oxygenation.,"Surgical patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) ligation is considered after failure or contraindication of medical treatment. Till now ligation of the PDA has been associated with low morbidity and mortality although recently concerns have been raised about the possible association of ductal clipping and neurodevelopmental abnormalities later in life. By means of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), we analysed the changes in the cerebral tissue oxygenation index (TOI) and fractional tissue oxygen extraction (FTOE) at the time of clipping as well as after clipping."
CD011912,0,8378128,0,Monitoring neonatal peripheral circulation by electrocardiogram-to-oximeter pulse velocity.,"The plethysmo time interval (PTI) is the time interval between the beginning of QRS complex on ECG and the upstroke of the pulse wave on the plethysmogram as measured by a pulse oximeter. We examined whether measuring the PTI has clinical value for evaluating neonatal peripheral circulation. We correlated PTI values and measured, from the hand and foot, height and body weight of 14 neonates. PTI was strongly correlated with height (R2 = 0.85) and body weight (R2 = 0.78). Height was especially highly correlated, because PTI is principally affected by the distance from the heart to the measured site. We also measured PTI on three clinical cases (patent ductus arteriosus, hypovolemia, and persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn). PTI was shortened in cases of peripheral circulatory impairments, because pulse wave velocities increased due to the contraction of arterioles. We conclude that the PTI can evaluate the peripheral circulatory status of the neonate by applying a new principle of pulse oximeter that is widely used in neonatal intensive care units."
CD011912,0,8215659,0,Mid-term results after bidirectional cavopulmonary shunts.,"Despite the increasing use of the bidirectional cavopulmonary shunt, little is known about the late results, the duration of palliation, and the frequency with which this procedure allows later successful conversion to a Fontan type of procedure. We reviewed our experience (1984 to 1992) in 38 consecutive children, ages 4 months to 16 years (mean, 4.0 years), who underwent a bidirectional cavopulmonary shunt procedure. All had a single functional ventricle and represented high risks for the performance of a Fontan procedure based on anatomic and hemodynamic criteria. The oxygen saturation in these patients improved from a preoperative value of 75% +/- 7% to 82% +/- 7% (p < 0.05) at late cardiac catheterization by a mean of 24 months after operation. The actuarial survival, including early deaths and that associated with all secondary procedures, was 86% at 1 year and 81% at 6 years. Early deaths occurred in 5.3% (2/38) and late deaths in 11% (4/36). Late follow-up ranged from 5 to 90 months (mean, 37 months). Conversion to a Fontan or fenestrated Fontan procedure was accomplished in 21 early survivors (21/36; 58%) by a mean of 26 months after the bidirectional cavopulmonary shunt procedure, with one operative and no late deaths (1/21; 4.8%). Three additional patients have undergone late reoperation, including 2 requiring cardiac transplantation and 1 undergoing the late creation of an axillary artery-to-vein fistula for the treatment of cyanosis. The midterm survival after a bidirectional cavopulmonary shunt procedure appears to be excellent, and it serves as a good staging procedure for patients who represent high risks for a Fontan procedure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD011912,0,10886693,0,High frequency oscillatory ventilation during repair of neonatal congenital diaphragmatic hernia.,"We evaluated the use of high frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) during congenital diaphragmatic hernia repair. After preoperative stabilization, 22 newborn infants were ventilated with HFOV during surgery. Ventilatory settings, blood gas values and oxygenation index were recorded before, during and after surgical repair. No differences were noted for these variables. No complications related to ventilation were recorded. According to the surgeon, diaphragmatic repair during HFOV is facilitated. This study confirms that CDH can be safely repaired using HFOV during anaesthesia."
CD011912,0,14694949,0,Manipulating parallel circuits: the perioperative management of patients with complex congenital cardiac disease.,"In all patients undergoing cardiac surgery, the effective delivery of oxygen to the tissues is of paramount importance. In the patient with relatively normal cardiac structures, the pulmonary and systemic circulations are relatively independent of each other. In the patient with a functional single ventricle, the pulmonary and systemic circulations are dependent on the same pump. As a consequence of this interdependency, the haemodynamic changes following complex palliative procedures, such as the Norwood operation, can be difficult to understand. Comparison of the newly created surgical connections to a simple set of direct current electrical circuits may help the practitioner to successfully care for the patient. In patients undergoing complex palliations, the pulmonary and systemic circulations can be compared to two circuits in parallel. Manipulations of variables, such as resistance or flow, in one circuit, can profoundly affect the performance of the other circuit. A large pulmonary flow might result in a large increase in the saturation of haemoglobin with oxygen returning to the heart via the pulmonary veins at the expense of a decreased systemic flow. Accurate balancing of these parallel circulations requires an appreciation of all interventions that can affect individual components of both circulations."

Oxygen saturation was reduced to 65-74% for 2 wk. Eight lambs served as normoxemic controls. beta-receptor density (Bmax) and ligand affinity (KD) were determined with the radio-ligand [125I]iodocyanopindolol and adenylate cyclase activity determined during stimulation with isoproterenol, sodium fluoride (NaF), and forskolin. During chronic hypoxemia, Bmax decreased 45% (hypoxemic, 180.6 +/- 31.5 vs. control, 330.5 +/- 60.1 fmol/mg) in the left ventricle (exposed to hypoxemia alone) but was unchanged in the right ventricle (exposed to hypoxemia and pressure overload). KD was not different from control in either ventricle. Left ventricular isoproterenol-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity was decreased by 39% (30.0 +/- 4.3% increase vs. 44.1 +/- 9.5% increase) whereas right ventricular adenylate cyclase activity was unchanged. Stimulation of adenylate cyclase with NaF or forskolin was not different from control in either ventricle. Circulating epinephrine was increased fourfold whereas circulating and myocardial norepinephrine were unchanged. These data demonstrate a down-regulation of the left ventricular beta-adrenergic receptor/adenylate cyclase system during chronic hypoxemia secondary to an intracardiac right-to-left shunt."

The average oxygen saturation was 41%. PGE1 infusion, 0.1 mcg/kg/min, was successful in 17 of 19 patients, as it resulted in an increase in oxygen saturation from 41% to 79%, average increase 38%. Two patients did not respond to PGE1 infusion. One was 30 days of age and the other had no patient ductus arteriosus. All of the patients underwent a palliative shunt procedure. There were three hospital deaths in this group. No patient died of hypoxemia. Group II consisted of nine patients whose CHD was predominantly that of aortic obstructive disease with clinical manifestations of cardiac failure, hypoperfusion, and acidemia. Six of these patients had complicated coarctation of the aorta. Three patients had interruption of the aortic arch. The pH of these patients averaged 7.19. PGE1 infusion resulted in improvement of the pH to average of 7.37, improvement of congestive heart failure, and reappearance of femoral pulses. One patient failed to respond. All patients in Group II underwent operation. There were three hospital deaths in this group. No patient died intraoperatively. PGE1 infusion is a valuable aid to surgical treatment of desperately ill neonates with both cyanotic and acyanotic forms of CHD."
CD011912,0,25484461,0,Perinatal management of major congenital heart disease.,"Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common form of congenital anomaly. Prenatal diagnosis of CHD has been associated with decreased morbidity and mortality for some forms of major CHD. As most cases of major CHD are not identified prenatally, clinical examination of the newborn and pulse oximetry are also important means of identifying more cases. Clinicians must suspect CHD as a diagnosis in a cyanosed or shocked neonate and be familiar with appropriate management, namely the commencement of prostaglandin if a duct dependent cardiac lesion is suspected. Telemedicine can aid prompt diagnosis of CHD and therefore direct appropriate management."

In inspiration of increasing concentrations of O2 the TavO2 was progressively delayed below CA as compared to the region above CA, which reflected latent tissue oxygen deficiency. After CA correction the TavO2 values were practically the same in both regions.

CD011912,0,835481,0,Transposition of the great arteries with intact ventricular septum and patent ductus arteriosus.,"At the time of initial balloon atrial septostomy a patent ductus arteriosus was found with angiography in 39 of 81 infants with transposition of the great arteries with intact ventricular septum. By angiographic criteria the ductus shunt was considered small in 21 infants and large and significant in 18. In contrast to the usual clinical presentation of neonates with transposition and intact ventricular septum, 12 of these 18 infants with a significant patent ductus arteriosus had only slight cyanosis and 8 presented with tachypnea out of proportion to the degree of cyanosis. Ten of the 18 infants had no continuous murmur, bounding pulses, mid-diastolic rumble or differential cyanosis. Clinically occult narrowing or closure occurred, presumably gradually and relatively late, in six infants. Acute early narrowing or closure, spontaneous (six infants) or surgically produced (three infants), occurred usually within the 1st month of life and was associated with a marked decrease in arterial oxygen saturation in eight infants, often with a rapid clinical deterioration. Persistence of a large patent ductus arteriosus for several months appears to be associated with an increased incidence of early pulmonary vascular disease. Therapeutic considerations for the infant with a large patent ductus arteriosus after initial balloon atrial septostomy include: (1) careful initial follow-up of the infant in clinically stable condition in case the ductus arteriosus should acutely narrow or close and the patient require urgent palliative or corrective surgery; (2) urgent early closure of the ductus in the infant with overt left heart failure with concurrent atrial septectomy or preferably primary corrective surgery; and (3) elective closure of a persistent significant patent ductus arteriosus before age 4 months with concurrent corrective surgery in the infant in clinically stable condition."

CD011912,0,6827844,0,Intracardiac repair of dextro-transposition of the great arteries in the newborn period. Early and late results.,"Between November, 1978, and December, 1981, nine neonates with dextro-transposition of the great arteries (d-TGA) and intact ventricular septum underwent primary intracardiac repair (i.e., because of persistent hypoxemia following balloon atrial septostomy arterial Po2 between 17 and 27 mm Hg). Age and weight at operation ranged from 2 to 21 days (mean 6.7) and from 1,900 to 4,500 gm (mean 3,493), respectively. The Mustard procedure was used in the first three patients and the Senning technique in the last six. All operations were done with deep hypothermia and circulatory arrest lasting 43 to 88 minutes (mean 70). An associated patent ductus arteriosus was ligated in eight of the nine patients. There were no deaths. The patients have been followed up for an average of 23 months (range 1 to 36). All are asymptomatic and require no medication. In one patient, atrioventricular dissociation necessitated implantation of a pacemaker 2 weeks after operation. All others are in sinus rhythm with normal atrioventricular conduction. Hemodynamic and angiographic follow-up was obtained in seven patients 8 to 25 months postoperatively (average 14.5). Left ventricular pressure was less than 30 mm Hg and aortic oxygen saturation was greater than 90% in all patients. One of the patients who had the Mustard procedure had complete obstruction at the junction of the inferior vena cava and the lower limb of the baffle. No evidence of systemic venous obstruction was found in the patients who had the Senning procedure. Early primary intracardiac repair appears to be a satisfactory alternative in the treatment of neonates with persistent hypoxemia following balloon atrial septostomy."
CD011912,0,736728,0,[Effects of prostaglandin in heart abnormalities with needed patency of the arterial canal (clinical and histological study)].,"Eight infants with cardiac malformations that were dependent on the patency of the ductus, were treated with Prostaglandin E 1 to reverse the closure of the duct. There was clinical improvement in 7 out of the 8 infants, confirmed by improvement in oxygen saturation and/or blood gases. In four cases the opening of the duct was visualised by angiography immediately after the prostaglandin infusion. Side-effects observed were transient pyrexia, flush reactions, apnoeic spells and one case of renal shock. Microscopic examination revealed in the four cases studied conspicuous edema of the media of the dictus. Because of the edema, the ductal wall is friable which indirectly may account for the severe lesions observed in the ductal wall. Prostaglandine E1 has a place in paediatric cardiology but in view of the observations made on the ductal wall it seems advisable to administer the drug only in a low dose and for a short duration."
CD011912,0,8781088,0,Congestive heart failure during early infancy in patients with ventricular septal defect relative to early closure.,"The hemodynamic features of 44 patients requiring surgical closure of a ventricular septal defect (VSD) during early infancy were evaluated. The VSD was closed within the first 6 months of life in 29 patients (group A) and during the second 6 months in 15 patients (group B). The left-to-right (L-R) shunts were significantly greater in group A than in group B, although in all patients they were more than 50%. In contrast, the left ventricular end-diastolic volume was significantly greater in group B than in group A, whereas the right ventricular end-diastolic volume was greater in group A; the difference was not statistically significant. The step-up in blood oxygen saturation in the lower right atrium, which was significantly more in group A, indicated the L-R shunt across the patent foramen ovale (PFO). The L-R shunt across the VSD during diastole was also detected in all patients angiographically. With early infantile VSD, the larger the L-R shunt the greater was the likelihood of early surgery. Right ventricular volume overload caused by the L-R shunt across a PFO as well as through the VSD during diastole is a useful indicator of a large shunt in infants with VSD."

BNP was measured pre- and post-operatively (immediately, day 1) in 18 children undergoing corrective repair with concurrent echocardiography (pre-, post-op day 1) to assess right ventricular (RV) systolic dysfunction, restrictive physiology, wall motion and pulmonary regurgitation (PR). In the first 24 h postoperatively, BNP rose acutely in all patients (mean 34.9 vs 144.4 vs 716.9 pg/ml at pre-op, days 0 and 1; P < 0.001). Immediate postoperative BNP correlated with preoperative haematocrit (rho = 0.52, P = 0.03) and inversely with preoperative oxygen saturation (rho = -0.63, P = 0.007). All patients showed reduced RV systolic function and abnormal wall motion with at least moderate PR in six patients (33.3%) and restrictive physiology in four (24%). Subsequent BNP expression (post-op day 1) correlated with a low RV fractional area change (rho = -0.51, P = 0.04), high oxygen extraction ratio (rho = 0.56, P = 0.02) and high central venous pressure (rho = 0.79, P < 0.001). The LV function and wall motion remained preserved in all patients. The mechanism of BNP expression is likely to be multi-factorial in the presence of a complex postoperative RV physiology in tetralogy of Fallot. An acute BNP response in the early postoperative period reflects an important physiological role and may be used as an adjunct biomarker to assess the RV function."
CD011912,0,19766503,0,"Influence of two perfusion strategies on oxygen metabolism in paediatric cardiac surgery. Evaluation of the high-flow, low-resistance technique.","Paediatric cardiac surgery is often performed under hypothermic conditions, that is, with a reduced core body temperature. Certain interventions even require the circulation to be stopped. This can only be done at a body temperature of 18 degrees C, with no risk of neurological damage and harm to the brain and other organs. Vasoconstriction is a natural reaction of the body to cold, causing the blood vessels to contract. Such a reaction would lead to a clear rise in blood pressure on cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Since the blood pressure is regulated in the arteriolar loop of the capillary system, there is a marked increase in blood pressure and a suppression of free water into the surrounding tissue, which, in turn, may lead to the intra-operative development of oedemas. This study aimed to investigate whether the high-flow, low-resistance (HFLR) technique offers any benefits over conventional methods."
CD011912,0,18515672,0,Estimation of pulmonary vascular resistance with Doppler diastolic gradients.,"This study was undertaken to determine the diastolic Doppler echocardiographic correlates of pulmonary vascular resistance calculated on cardiac catheterization in patients with secondary pulmonary arterial hypertension. Thirty-eight consecutive patients with congenital heart disease, pulmonary artery hypertension and pulmonary regurgitation were studied. Continuous-wave Doppler-derived pulmonary artery diastolic gradients were measured at 3 points on the pulmonary regurgitant diastolic velocity slope: peak diastolic, end-diastolic (at the R wave on the electrocardiogram), and mid-diastolic (midway between the peak and end-diastolic points). Catheterization data included oximetry, measurements of pressure in the cardiac chambers and great arteries, and calculation of pulmonary vascular resistance index. Doppler-derived peak, mid, and end-diastolic pulmonary regurgitation gradients correlated best with catheterization-measured pulmonary artery systolic, mean and diastolic pressures, respectively. The best Doppler correlate of pulmonary vascular resistance index was the pulmonary artery end-diastolic gradient. Clinically useful information can be obtained from Doppler pulmonary artery diastolic gradients measured on the pulmonary regurgitant diastolic velocity slope, which can estimate the pulmonary arterial pressure as well as pulmonary vascular resistance obtained on cardiac catheterization."

Between June 1995 and December 1997, 14 PA-IVS neonates with tripartite right ventricle underwent an attempted pulmonary valvotomy. For perforation of the pulmonary valve, a guidewire was used in 4, and a radiofrequency guidewire in 10 patients. Two outcome groups were identified. Group I included those in whom transcatheter treatment achieved a definitive success; group II patients required surgery despite an initial successful valvotomy. The attempt failed in 3 patients, 1 of whom had pericardial effusion. Perforation of the pulmonary valve was achieved in 11 patients: 2 with a guidewire and 9 with a radiofrequency guidewire. A subsequent balloon valvuloplasty was performed in these 11 patients. After valvuloplasty, mean right ventricular pressure decreased from 124 +/- 24 to 60 +/- 15 mm Hg (p <0.01). One died of heart failure and infection 10 days later, despite successful weaning from prostaglandin E1. Group I patients (n = 6) were treated with transcatheter valvotomy alone. Group II patients (n = 4) required right ventricular outflow patch. Significant differences between the 2 groups (group I vs II) were identified in tricuspid valve Z value (0.52 +/- 0.37 vs -1.25 +/- 0.48, p <0.05), pulmonary valve Z value (-3.47 +/- 0.59 vs -5.43 +/- 0.94, p <0.05), and ratio of right-to-left ventricular area on the apical 4-chamber view (0.73 +/- 0.06 vs 0.49 +/- 0.03, p <0.05). There were no significant differences in hemodynamic characteristics between the 2 groups. After a follow-up period ranging from 7 to 35 months (mean 18 +/- 10.3), the most recent echocardiograms in the 10 patients showed a mean pressure gradient across the pulmonary valve of 17 +/- 15 mm Hg. All 10 patients had an oxygen saturation of >92%. Transcatheter valvotomy using a radiofrequency guidewire is a safe and effective treatment in selected patients with PA-IVS. Transcatheter valvotomy can be a definitive treatment in PA-IVS patients with a tricuspid valve Z value > or = -0.1, pulmonary valve Z value > or = -4.1 and ratio of right-to-left ventricular area > or = 0.65."

Immature myocardium, as in pediatric patients, is thought to be more dependent on extracellular calcium for optimal function. For this reason, intravenous calcium chloride infusions may improve myocardial function in the pediatric patient. The objectives of this study were to report the hemodynamic changes seen after administration of continuous calcium chloride to critically ill children. We retrospectively identified pediatric patients (newborn to 17 years old) with hemodynamic instability admitted to the cardiac ICU between May 2011 and May 2012 who received a continuous infusion of calcium chloride. The primary outcome was improvement in cardiac output, assessed by arterial-mixed venous oxygen saturation (A-V) difference. Sixty-eight patients, mean age 0.87 ± 2.67 years, received a total of 116 calcium infusions. Calcium chloride infusions resulted in significant improvements in primary and secondary measures of cardiac output at 2 and 6 h. Six hours after calcium initiation, A-V oxygen saturation difference decreased by 7.4 % (32.6 ± 2.1 to 25.2 ± 2.0 %, p < 0.001), rSO2 increased by 5.5 % (63.1 vs 68.6 %, p < 0.001), and serum lactate decreased by 0.9 mmol/l (3.3 vs 2.4 mmol/l, p < 0.001) with no change in HR (149.1 vs 145.6 bpm p = 0.07). Urine output increased 0.66 ml/kg/h in the 8-h period after calcium initiation when compared to pre-initiation (p = 0.003). Neonates had the strongest evidence of effectiveness with other age groups trending toward significance.

Postoperative course was uneventful and his oxygen saturation was maintained satisfactory. At the age of one year and nine months he underwent corrective surgery. The pulmonary valve was widely opened enough to perform the right ventricular outflow tract reconstruction with valvotomy and outflow patch.

CD011912,0,7515213,0,Usefulness of intermittent monitoring of mixed venous oxygen saturation after stage I palliation for hypoplastic left heart syndrome.,"Most deaths after stage I palliation for hypoplastic left heart syndrome have occurred within the first 24 hours after surgery. Efforts to improve 1-day survival should therefore have significant impact on improving overall survival. Early death has most often been attributed to low cardiac output and abnormalities of pulmonary to systemic flow ratio (Qp/Qs). Thirteen infants underwent stage I palliation and had a catheter inserted in the high superior vena cava (SVC) for intermittent measurement of SVC oxygen saturation. Calculation of Qp/Qs was achieved using SVC saturation as a mixed venous oxygen saturation, and estimating pulmonary venous oxygen saturation. Eleven patients survived, and 2 patients died within the first 24 hours. Abnormalities in Qp/Qs were noted in 12 of 13 patients after operation. In 10 of these 12 patients, there was a high Qp/Qs, which has been associated with poor outcome. High Qp/Qs was noted even in patients with acceptable arterial oxygen saturations (< 85%). SVC saturation increased in all survivors during the first 24 hours, and was associated with a decrease in Qp/Qs. Measurement of SVC oxygen saturation appears to be a valuable adjuvant in the postoperative management of infants after stage I palliation of hypoplastic left heart syndrome. Major abnormalities in Qp/Qs can be detected even with acceptable arterial saturations. With this information, early ventilator/pharmaceutical adjustments can be made which may improve stage I survival."

In pediatric cardiac surgery, dobutamine and dopamine are often used as inotropic support. Dopexamine is a synthetic catecholamine, which has positive inotropic and vasodilating properties. Because the hemodynamic effects of catecholamines are modified after cardiopulmonary bypass, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of dobutamine and dopexamine on cardiac index and systemic vascular resistance index after cardiopulmonary bypass in pediatric cardiac surgery."
CD011912,0,27279759,0,Universal Pulse Oximetry Screening for Early Detection of Critical Congenital Heart Disease.,"Critical congenital heart disease (CCHD) is a major cause of infant death and morbidity worldwide. An early diagnosis and timely intervention can significantly reduce the likelihood of an adverse outcome. However, studies from the United States and other developed countries have shown that as many as 30%-50% of infants with CCHD are discharged after birth without being identified. This diagnostic gap is likely to be even higher in low-resource countries. Several large randomized trials have shown that the use of universal pulse-oximetry screening (POS) at the time of discharge from birth hospital can help in early diagnosis of these infants. The objective of this review is to share data to show that the use of POS for early detection of CCHD meets the criteria necessary for inclusion to the universal newborn screening panel and could be adopted worldwide."

In addition to standard noninvasive monitoring, arterial blood pressure, central venous pressure, and cerebral oxygen saturation were monitored. Gastric distension resulting from positive pressure ventilation prevented laparoscopic gastrostomy tube placement. Thoracoscopy with a CO2 insufflation pressure of 6 mm Hg at low flow (1 L/min) was well tolerated hemodynamically despite hypercarbia and cerebral oxygen saturation was maintained. Careful monitoring and good communication were critical to the safe management of this single ventricle patient during thoracoscopic EA/TEF repair."
CD011912,0,688569,0,Clinical use of blade atrial septostomy.,"A cardiac catheter enclosing an extensible blade was used to enlarge the interatrial opening in seven patients. Two patients with transposition of the great arteries who had balloon atrial septostomy as newborns subsequently presented with clinical evidence of a restrictive interatrial opening at 1 and 4 months of age. Cardiac catheterization confirmed restenosis of the interatrial opening and inadequate intracardiac mixing. After blade atrial septostomy the systemic arterial oxygen saturation increased by 20% and 30%, respectively. Five patients with mitral atresia complex, ages 2 months-9 1/2 years, had a restrictive interatrial communication and severe pulmonary venous hypertension (mean left atrial pressures ranged from 20-38 mm Hg). Following blade atrial septostomy, the pressure gradient between the atria was almost completely abolished and prompt clinical improvement was observed in each patient. All patients tolerated the procedure without complications. Blade atrial septostomy was a safe, effective procedure for enlarging the interatrial communication in this limited series of patients with an interatrial septum too thick to permit adequate rupture by conventional balloon atrial septostomy."

Six infants had a critical valvular pulmonary stenosis with intact ventricular septum (group S), 5 infants had a pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum (group A), and 3 infants had a tetralogy of Fallot (group F). In 4 of the 5 patients of group A the BVP was preceded by operative opening of the pulmonary valve. In one case radiofrequency perforation of the valve during the first diagnostic cardiac catheterization could be carried out successfully. The average value of the ratio of the balloon diameter to the diameter of the pulmonary valve was 1.31 +/- 0.20. The systolic pressure in the right ventricle dropped 51 mm Hg (from 106 +/- 32 mm Hg to 55 +/- 9 mm Hg) in group S and 33 mm Hg (from 101 +/- 27 mm Hg to 68 +/- 19 mm Hg) in group A. In group F the arterial oxygen saturation increased 15%, however the pressure of the right ventricle was, after the BVP, slightly higher than before.

CD011912,0,2038202,0,Ebstein's anomaly appearing in the neonate. A new surgical approach.,"Ebstein's anomaly appearing during the neonatal period carries a high mortality rate. These infants exhibit cyanosis, acidosis, and congestive heart failure. The pathophysiologic characteristics consist of severe tricuspid regurgitation and functional pulmonary atresia. As a result of the inability of the right ventricle to generate forward flow through the pulmonary arteries, these infants remain dependent on ductal patency. Since May 1988, five newborn infants with severe Ebstein's anomaly have been admitted for treatment at our institution. At initial examination, they weighed 3.6 +/- 1.8 kg and had a mean oxygen tension of 29.6 +/- 2.3 mm Hg and a mean pH of 7.20 +/- 0.05. Chest roentgenography demonstrated a mean cardiothoracic ratio of 0.81 +/- 0.02. As determined by echocardiography, the right atria were massively enlarged, severe tricuspid regurgitation was present in all patients, and the pulmonary valves were not opening. All infants were dependent on prostaglandin E1 and attempts to wean them from this drug were unsuccessful. Palliative treatment consisted of tricuspid closure with autologous pericardium and an aortopulmonary shunt of 4 mm polytetrafluoroethylene tubing. There were no operative or late deaths. At discharge, mean oxygen tension was 42.2 +/- 0.85 mm Hg and mean systemic oxygen saturation was 83.2% +/- 1.94%. Infants have grown satisfactorily during the follow-up period. Three infants have since returned for further surgical intervention. One infant, at 11 months of age, underwent a Glenn anastomosis for progressive oxygen desaturation. Two infants have returned, at ages 23 and 22 months, for Fontan procedures, which represent their definitive operative management. We believe this new procedure offers excellent palliative treatment for Ebstein's anomaly in critically ill neonates. Feasibility of later definitive correction is demonstrated by the good results obtained with the Fontan procedure in two infants."

CD011912,0,21508828,0,Direct optical measurement of intraoperative myocardial oxygenation during congenital heart surgery.,"This study demonstrates use of novel technology to measure cellular oxygenation during corrective congenital heart surgery. Cellular oxygenation was measured using a custom-designed optical probe placed on the free wall of the right ventricle. Cellular oxygenation, determined from myoglobin saturation, was calculated using multiwavelength analysis. Timing of bypass, aortic cross-clamp, infusion of cardioplegic solution, and length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay were recorded. Baseline cellular oxygenation was approximately 50% just before aortic cross-clamp and decreased to approximately 20% during cardioplegia. Cellular oxygenation remained low throughout cardioplegia and returned toward baseline after bypass. In four cases, cellular oxygenation did not return as quickly to baseline as in the other three cases. Among the four patients demonstrating slow recovery, the average ICU length of stay was 2.25 days compared with an average stay of 1.33 days for those patients exhibiting rapid cellular oxygenation recovery (p = 0.06). The slow recovery group had an average cross-clamp time of 40.1 ± 28.4 minutes, compared with 26.0 ± 8.5 minutes for the fast recovery group (p = 0.34). This study demonstrates for the first time that myocyte cellular oxygenation can be measured intraoperatively during cardiac surgery. Measurement of cellular oxygenation may be useful for improving myocardial preservation techniques."

A new classification based on anatomical findings is proposed. Pulmonary stenosis or atresia is frequent in the type with transposition of the great arteries. The rare instances of normal or large left ventricle are due to a large ventricular septal defect, or to straddling or displaced tricuspid valve. The clinical, radiologic and electrocardiographic findings have been summarized and correlated with the different physiopathological situations. In our catheterized cases an oxygen saturation step-up was found in the right atrium together with left atrial hypertension. In seven cases mitral atresia was demonstrated by selective left atrial contrast injection. The average age at death was six months. Among the cases surviving one year or more, the association of atrial septal defects or pulmonary stenosis was frequent. Enlargement of the interatrial communication, accompanied by other palliative measures, is the only available surgical procedure."

Female patient had been already diagnosed as hydrocephalus during pregnancy and ventricular drainage was performed soon after the delivery. Prostaglandin E 1 was also applied for heart disease, but saturation of O2 decreased to 80% on arterial blood gas analysis. Blalock-Taussig operation and ligation of ductus arteriosus was done 41 days after the delivery and ventricle-peritoneal shunt was also made for the progressive hydrocephalus on the same day. Chromosome analysis showed no abnormality. The genesis of this complicated brain and heart anomaly is discussed from the viewpoint of neural crest cell abnormality."
CD011912,0,25754164,0,An unusual cause of neonatal cyanosis….,"We report a case of a female neonate whose pulse oximetry screening for congenital heart disease at 40 h of life was positive. The pregnancy was uneventful with no relevant family history. The neonate presented with bluish discolouration of the skin lasting until day 15. Cardiovascular examination and chest radiography were normal. Septic screening was negative. Oxygen therapy was started with poor response; investigations revealed a methaemoglobinaemia of 7.4%. The methaemoglobin level reached a peak of 15% on day 10, falling thereafter. The infant was discharged by day 20 with a normal physical examination and a methaemoglobinaemia of 11.4%. By 2 months of age this had fallen to 2.4%. Further investigation revealed a haemoglobin M variant: a heterozygous mutation of the γ globin gene known as Hb F-M Viseu. The mutation occurs in the γ chain, therefore the methaemoglobinaemia is transitory, resolving with the transition from fetal to adult haemoglobin."
CD011912,0,17165309,0,The effect of halothane/nitrous oxide/oxygen mask induction on arterial hemoglobin saturation in cyanotic heart disease.,"The effect of a halothane/nitrous oxide/oxygen mask induction on arterial hemoglobin saturation (SaO2) was studied in 25 patients with cyanotic congenital heart disease. During this induction the SaO2 increased from 80% +/- 2 (mean +/- SEM) in awake patients breathing room air to 86% +/- 1 after induction of anesthesia, with an average increase of 6.8% +/- 2 (absolute) (N = 25; P < .005). Patients were retrospectively divided into two groups, A and B. Group A patients had pulmonic infundibular stenosis (PIS) (N = 13) with the potential for variable pulmonary outflow tract obstruction. These patients had awake SaO, values of 76% +/- 3 that increased significantly after induction to 86% +/- 1, with an average increase of 10% +/- 4 (absolute) (P < .01). Group B patients did not have PIS; they had an awake SaO2 of 83% +/- 2, which rose insignificantly after induction to 87% +/- 1, with an average increase of 4% +/- 2 (absolute) (P > .1). Thus, the significant increase in SaO2 during induction for the entire group was primarily due to the large response of patients with PIS. No correlation was found between SaO2 and systolic blood pressure for the entire study population as well as for groups A and B separately. The lack of correlation between systolic blood pressure and SaO2 may indicate that relaxation of pulmonic infundibular stenosis is an important mechanism explaining the observed increase in SaO2 during anesthetic induction in group A (PIS) patients. Six patients had clinically important decreases in SaO2 during the induction of anesthesia, and airway obstruction was usually the cause. Anesthetic induction with halothane/nitrous oxide/oxygen leads to an increase in SaO2 in patients with many forms of cyanotic heart disease, but especially those with the potential for variable pulmonary outflow tract obstruction."

Cardiac catheterization revealed a step-up of oxygen saturation in right ventricle, L-R shunt 70.3%, R-L shunt 6.9% and pulmonary hypertension (PH). Since diagnosis of coronary sinus ASD was difficult, the operation was performed under diagnosis of VSD. Although the operation was success, cyanosis appeared after the operation.

Between January 1983 and June 1998, 21 of 355 neonates presenting with HLHS (5.9%) underwent cardiac catheterization at median age 1 day (range 0 to 25), for creation or enlargement of a restrictive or absent interatrial communication. One patient died during preliminary angiography. Three underwent blade septostomy with 2 procedure-related deaths, and 1 had balloon atrial septostomy (BAS); all 4 died before surgical intervention. Fifteen underwent Brockenbrough atrial septoplasty with transatrial needle puncture and serial balloon dilations of the new ASD, 5 after unsuccessful BAS. The most recent patient had a stent placed across the atrial septum after transatrial needle puncture. In the 16 patients treated with septoplasty or stent, oxygen saturation increased from 50 +/- 4% to 83 +/- 2% (p <0.0001) and transatrial pressure gradient decreased from 16 +/- 1 to 6 +/- 1 mm Hg (p <0.0001). One patient died awaiting transplantation, supportive care only was requested in 1, and 14 underwent stage 1 palliation. Eight of 14 (57%) survived to hospital discharge. Six of 7 (86%) survived bidirectional Glenn and the 3 who have undergone fenestrated Fontan are alive. In neonates with HLHS, a restrictive ASD resulting in profound cyanosis demands urgent intervention. BAS is frequently unsuccessful and blade septostomy has high mortality. Pulmonary venous hypertension can be adequately relieved by Brockenbrough atrial septoplasty or stenting, allowing stabilization before reconstructive surgery or while awaiting transplant."

CD011912,0,8578670,0,[Catheter therapy of congenital cardiovascular defects].,"The authors analyze the experience gained in catheter operations performed at their Department over the recent 28 years. A total of 500 balloon (Rashkind) and 35 knife (Park) atrioseptostomies were performed in critical patients with different ""blue"" congenital diseases over this period. An immediate hemodynamic effect at the operation table was attained in 95% of patients. Transluminal balloon valvuloplasty (TLBVP) was performed in 372 patients with valvular stenosis of the pulmonary artery. The results of this operation depend on the patient's age, anatomy of the defect, and correct choice of the diameter of balloon catheter. This intervention is particularly effective in patients aged under 1. In patients with combined valvular and infundibular stenosis the results of TLBVP depend on the severity of stenosis and age of patient. An attempt at TLBVP of congenital aortal stenosis was undertaken in 67 patients. Valvuloplasty was carried out in 57 patients. The operation was effective in 13 (62%) out of 21 patients aged under 1. The mortality in this group was 5.5%. Balloon valvuloplasty of the pulmonary artery was carried out in 71 patients with cyanotic congenital heart diseases. The intervention helped eliminate the critical state, rise the systolic pressure in the pulmonary artery, improve blood saturation with oxygen, and evade the operation for creation of a systemic-pulmonary anastomosis. Isolated and postoperative stenoses of pulmonary arteries were removed in 65 patients. Six Johnson and Johnson stents were effectively implanted to 3 patients with rigid postoperative stenoses; in 32 patients transluminal balloon angioplasty (TLBAP) for coarctation and recoarctation of the aorta brought about a satisfactory immediate hemodynamic effect. TLBAP of Blalock-Taussig's stenosed anastomosis were performed in 60 patients with various cyanotic congenital heart diseases. Its results were good in 39 (65%) patients, satisfactory in 19 (31.7%), and unsatisfactory in only 2 (3%) cases. Of the novel endocardial interventions, dilatation of the conduit following Rastrelli's operation, creation of a defect of the atrial septum after Fontain's operation, and embolization of the coronary-cardiac fistulas and of patent ductus arteriosus were carried out. This review demonstrates wide use of endocardial surgery methods in the treatment of some congenital heart diseases; in many cases such treatment may be an alternative to surgical interventions."
CD011912,0,3759271,0,Ventricular development and function in complete transposition: angiocardiographic evaluation.,"We studied 50 left ventricular cineangiograms and 41 right ventricular cineangiograms of 40 patients with usual atrial arrangement (situs solitus) together with concordant atrioventricular and discordant ventriculo-arterial connexions (complete transposition), catheterized between 1 day and 12 months of age. Our purpose was to evaluate ventricular development and function. The patients were subdivided on the basis of associated lesions into groups with intact ventricular septum; with ventricular septal defect; with ventricular septal defect together with pulmonary stenosis and with pulmonary stenosis in isolation. Each group was further separated according to age into those patients below and above 60 days. Ventricular volumes, ejection fraction and the ratio between systolic pressure and end-systolic volume were evaluated for both ventricles. The left ventricular mass, stress, and the ratio of stress to end-systolic volume were also calculated. A volume overload leads to increased left ventricular volume even at birth. With an intact ventricular septum, the left ventricle in patients with complete transposition is normal at birth and also during the first weeks of life. Myocardial mass, however, does not increase proportionately with increase in volume as the patient grows and it remains inadequate by the age of one year. The left ventricular mass is also inadequate in patients with associated anomalies when the left ventricular pressure is less than 60 mm Hg. Moreover, the left ventricle in presence of an intact ventricular septum presents a decrease in contractility during the first year of life despite the finding of a satisfactory arterial oxygen saturation. The right ventricle has a normal volume at birth which increases during the first year due to a greater diastolic filling following atrial septostomy. We noted a progressive decrease in ejection fraction, however, which is related to various factors including a reduction in contractility."
CD011912,0,16802735,0,[The effect of an endothelin receptor antagonist in Eisenmenger syndrome: a single-center experience of 11 patients].,"The Eisenmenger syndrome is a complication of congenital heart disease with significant left-to-right shunts, such as large ventricular septal defects, and corresponds to fixed pulmonary hypertension with shunt reversal. Bosentan, an inhibitor of endothelin A and B receptors, is a new molecule previously validated in the treatment of primary pulmonary hypertension. The authors report their monocentric experience of bosentan in 11 consecutive patients with the Eisenmenger syndrome treated for at least one year. This retrospective study comprised 7 females and 4 males with an average age of 34 years (range 17 to 51 years). The underlying lesion was ventricular septal defect (n = 4), atrial septal defect (n = 3), pulmonary atresia with septal defect (n = 4 of which 2 were treated palliatively). Before treatment, the patients were classified according to the NHYA functional class (I, II, IIIa and IIIb, IV or, respectively from 1 to 5) with a distribution in this series between Classes IIIa and IV (average 3.81 +/- 0.75) and from 3 to 10 on Borg's dyspnoea scale (average 6.54 +/- 2.29). The ambient oxygen saturation (SaO2) at rest was, on average 77 +/- 9%, the haemoglobin concentration 16.6 +/- 2.4 g/dl; hepatic transaminase levels were normal. The 6 minute walk test before treatment was 216 +/- 111 m with marked desaturation on exercise (49 +/- 18%). With Bosentan, patients were globally much better clinically with a decrease in dyspnoea, improvement in NHYA class and increased 6 minute walking perimeter. Improvement in NYHA class was observed from 3 months' treatment (3.0 +/- 0.8, p = 0.0002) and was sustained to one year (2.54 +/- 0.7, p< 0.001). An improvement of dyspnoea on Borg's scale was observed from the second month's treatment (5.56 +/- 1.65, p = 0.0201) and persisted throughout follow up to one year (3.81 +/- 1.32, p < 0.0001). Similarly, the 6 minute walking perimeter increased from the first control at 6 months (323 +/- 82 m, p < 0.0001) and at one year (322 +/- 62 m, p <0.0004). Finally, although a significant increase in SaO2 was observed at 6 months (p = 0.0032), this was hardly significant at one year (82 +/- 10 %, p = 0.0512). Transaminase levels did not rise significantly at the follow up visits (p = ns) and the haemoglobin concentration was unchanged. No patient died during the study period. This study showed a clear functional improvement in patients with Eisenmenger's syndrome treated with bosentan. The drug was well tolerated clinically with few adverse effects and a good safety margin of usage."
CD011912,0,15046289,0,Bradycardia and hypoxaemia due to position-dependent hypoperfusion of the brain stem in a preterm infant.,"The case is reported of a male baby with a decreased time average velocity of the basilar artery to 32%, measured by Doppler sonography in dextro-rotated head position. The decrease was due to a hypoplastic right vertebral artery with compression of the contralateral vertebral artery at the craniocervical junction during dextro-rotation of the head. This finding was more prominent in prone than in supine position. A decrease in oxygen saturation and heart rate to < 70% and 60 bpm, respectively, was monitored during dextro-rotation. The polysomnography also revealed postural-dependent bradycardia, decrease of the oxygen saturation, and rising carbon dioxide partial tension in prone position with dextro-rotation of the head."
CD011912,0,17462361,0,Oral sildenafil ameliorates impaired pulmonary circulation early after bidirectional cavopulmonary shunt.,"We report a case of successful administration of oral sildenafil (ie, a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor) in an infant for impaired pulmonary circulation that caused early clinical deterioration after a bicavopulmonary shunt. The transpulmonary pressure gradient (ie, a clinical indicator of pulmonary circulation) was initially normalized by inhaled nitric oxide; however, an increase in transpulmonary pressure gradient and oxygen desaturation occurred after extubation and discontinuation of inhaled nitric oxide on postoperative day 1. Subsequent administration of oral sildenafil in stepwise doses resulted in normalization of transpulmonary pressure gradient and improved oxygen saturation with successful discontinuation of intravenous vasodilators. Our results suggest that oral sildenafil may be a potent adjunctive therapy for impaired postoperative pulmonary circulation after right heart bypass surgery."
CD011912,0,10067267,0,[Hypoplastic left-heart syndrome. Initial intensive care experiences with the Norwood operation in Vienna].,"Palliative surgery of the hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS), whereby both pulmonary and systemic circulation are restored, was first described by Norwood in 1983. Careful ventilatory and pharmacologic modulation of the ratio of pulmonary to systemic vascular resistance are a crucial part of pre-, peri- and postoperative management. We report our experience in 3 of 7 newborns with HLHS who underwent the Norwood operation. Hemodynamic and respiratory parameters were evaluated retrospectively in these patients and we analysed the influence of diagnostic and therapeutic interventions on the course of disease before and after operation. During prostaglandin therapy two of three patients required mechanical ventilation preoperatively because of pulmonary hyperperfusion. Decreased myocardial contractility, oliguria and increased pulmonary vascular resistance characterized the postoperative course. The management included a careful application of inotropic support when necessary, adaptation of the ventilatory setting in order to modulate pulmonary perfusion and, in addition, institution of peritoneal dialysis. One patient died from staphylococcus aureus and superinfection with respiratory syncytial virus on day 41 after the operation. Maintaining an optimal balance between pulmonary and systemic blood flow is an essential aspect of postoperative management. Serum lactate and central venous oxygen saturation are helpful parameters in monitoring therapeutic measures in these patients. We conclude from our preliminary experience, that the Norwood operation might be an alternative therapeutic approach for newborns with HLHS in whom heart transplantation is not possible."
CD011912,0,1711062,0,Results of balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty as a palliative procedure in tetralogy of Fallot.,"Balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty was attempted in 67 patients with tetralogy of Fallot at a median age of 5 months (range 0.03 to 52 months) for relief of cyanosis. In three patients, the valve could not be crossed and an aortopulmonary shunt was performed. In 35 patients, follow-up angiography was performed 3 to 30 months (average 12) after valvuloplasty. In 24 of these 35 patients (group A), the stenosis had been adequately palliated by valvuloplasty; the other 11 patients (group B) had required an aortopulmonary shunt 1 month (range 0 to 3 months) after valvuloplasty. The two groups were similar (p greater than 0.1) with respect to age at valvuloplasty, pulmonary anulus diameter, ratio of pulmonary artery to descending aorta diameter before valvuloplasty and interval to follow-up angiography. In contrast to patients in group B, patients in group A had a significant immediate improvement in systemic arterial oxygen saturation (p less than 0.01) and a significant increase in pulmonary anulus diameter at follow-up angiography (p less than 0.001). The growth of the branch pulmonary arteries was similar (p greater than 0.1) in the two groups. Among 42 patients who have had surgical correction, a transannular patch for right ventricular outflow tract reconstruction was used in 27 (64%); there was no difference between groups A and B with respect to its use. Eight patients died (three after repair) and death could not be directly attributed to valvuloplasty in any. Balloon valvuloplasty promotes growth of the pulmonary valve anulus and pulmonary arteries and is a useful alternative to an aortopulmonary shunt in patients with small pulmonary arteries or associated complex intracardiac defects."

The advantages of BDG shunt are achieved by partially separating the pulmonary and systemic venous circuits, and include reduced ventricular preload and long-term preservation of myocardium. The benefits of additional pulsatile pulmonary blood flow include the potential growth of pulmonary arteries, possible improvement in arterial oxygen saturation, and possible prevention of development of pulmonary arteriovenous malformations. However, increase in the systemic venous pressure after BDG with additional pulsatile blood flow is known. We describe the peri-operative implications of severe flow reversal in the superior vena cava after pulsatile BDG shunt construction in a child who presented for surgical interruption of the main pulmonary artery."
CD011912,0,19136750,0,Changes in near infrared spectroscopy during deep hypothermic circulatory arrest.,"Monitoring cerebral oxygenation with near infrared spectroscopy may identify periods of cerebral desaturation and thereby the patients at risk for perioperative neurocognitive issues. Data regarding the performance of near infrared spectroscopy monitoring during deep hypothermic circulatory arrest are limited. The current study presents data regarding use of a commercially available near infrared spectroscopy monitor during deep hypothermic circulatory arrest in paediatric patients undergoing surgery for congenital heart disease. The cohort included 8 patients, 2 weeks to 6 months of age, who required deep hypothermic circulatory arrest for repair of congenital heart disease. The baseline cerebral oxygenation was 63 +/- 11% and increased to 88 +/- 7% after 15 min of cooling to a nasopharyngeal temperature of 17-18 degrees C on cardiopulmonary bypass. In 5 of 8 patients, the cerebral oxygenation value had achieved its peak value (either >or=90% or no change during the last 2-3 min of cooling on cardiopulmonary bypass). In the remaining 3 patients, additional time on cardiopulmonary bypass was required to achieve a maximum cerebral oxygenation value. The duration of deep hypothermic circulatory arrest varied from 36 to 61 min (43.4 +/- 8 min). After the onset of deep hypothermic circulatory arrest, there was an incremental decrease in cerebral oxygenation to a low value of 53 +/- 11%. The greatest decrease occurred during the initial 5 min of deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (9 +/- 3%). Over the entire period of deep hypothermic circulatory arrest, there was an average decrease in the cerebral oxygenation value of 0.9% per min (range of 0.5 to 1.6% decline per minute). During cardiopulmonary bypass, cooling and deep hypothermic circulatory arrest, near infrared spectroscopy monitoring followed the clinically expected parameters. Such monitoring may be useful to identify patients who have not achieved the highest possible cerebral oxygenation value despite 15 min of cooling on cardiopulmonary bypass. Future studies are needed to define the cerebral oxygenation value at which neurological damage occurs and if interventions to correct the decreased cerebral oxygenation will improve perioperative outcomes."

Car safety seat testing (< or =4 days prior to discharge) was retrospectively reviewed for 66 postoperative infants. Car safety seat testing was performed according to AAP guidelines. Failure of the test was defined as the occurrence of apnea, bradycardia, or oxygen desaturation. Average birth weight was 3.1 +/- 0.5 kg. Two patients were born <37 weeks of gestation. Surgical procedures included modified Blalock-Taussig shunt (15), arterial switch operation (12), Norwood-Sano modification (11), coarctation repair (8), repair of tetralogy of Fallot (6), repair of truncus arteriosus (4), repair of total anomalous pulmonary venous return (3), pacemaker (2), repair of interrupted aortic arch and ventricular septal defect (VSD) (1), repair of coarctation/VSD (1), orthotopic heart transplant (1), repair of VSD (1), and patent ductus arteriosus ligation (1). Average age at discharge was 28 +/- 21 days. Four patients (6%) failed car safety seat testing secondary to a decrease in oxygen saturation. One of four passed on retesting after parental education; three of 4 (75%) were discharged home in a supine car safety seat. There was no relationship between the type of surgery and car safety seat test failure. It may be beneficial to extend the AAP recommendations for car safety seat testing to include this high-risk patient population."
CD011912,0,10870004,0,Effects of docarpamine on hemodynamics after open heart surgery in children.,"Docarpamine is a dopamine prodrug which has been selected from a large number of dopamine derivatives in order to develop an orally effective dopamine. The pharmacokinetics after oral administration of docarpamine have not yet been studied in children undergoing open heart surgery. This study examined the effects of docarpamine on hemodynamics and evaluated its safety in 11 children undergoing open heart surgery for congenital heart disease. This study began when the patientOs postoperative condition was stabilized by continuous dopamine infusion into the vein at a rate of 5 micro g/kg/min. The patients were administered 40 mg/kg of docarpamine every 8 hours, and hemodynamics were measured every 4 hours for 16 hours after the initial docarpamine administration. Immediately after the initial docarpamine administration, the dose of dopamine was reduced to 3 micro g/kg/min. Infusion of dopamine was stopped 8 hours after the initial docarpamine administration. Systemic systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate showed no significant changes. Mean right atrial pressure decreased 4 hours after docarpamine administration. Mixed venous oxygen saturation and mean velocity of circumferential fiber shortening increased significantly after docarpamine administration. No significant changes were observed in urine volume. All patients could be weaned from dopamine within 8 hours. No changes were observed in ECG, and no arrhythmia-inducing action was noted. Our study indicates that 40 mg/kg oral doses of docarpamine produce plasma dopamine concentration equivalent to those of a 3 to 5 micro g/kg/min dopamine infusion. Our data suggest that docarpamine is a safe and effective drug for children who have undergone open heart surgery."

We compared this IM combination to oral (PO) ketamine/midazolam in children having cardiac catheterization. A total of 51 children, ages 9 mo to 10 yr, were enrolled and randomized in this double-blinded study. All children received an IM injection at time zero and PO fluid 15 minutes later. We observed acceptance of medication, onset of sedation and sleep, and sedative efficacy. The cardiorespiratory changes were evaluated. Sedation was supplemented with IV propofol as required. Recovery time, parental satisfaction, and patient amnesia were assessed. Ketamine/midazolam given PO was better tolerated (P < 0.0005), had more rapid onset (P < 0.001), and provided superior sedation (P < 0.005). Respiratory rate decreased after IM DPT only. Heart rate and shortening fraction were stable. Oxygen saturation and mean blood pressure decreased minimally in both groups. Supplemental propofol was more frequently required (P < or = 0.02) and in larger doses (P < 0.05) after IM DPT. Parental satisfaction ratings were higher (P < 0.005) and amnesia was more reliably obtained (P = 0.007) with PO ketamine/midazolam. Two patients needed airway support after the PO medication, as did two other patients when PO ketamine/midazolam was supplemented with IV propofol. Although PO ketamine/midazolam provided superior sedation and amnesia compared to IM DPT, this regimen may require the supervision of an anesthesiologist for safe use."

Before the initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass, it was noted that an abrupt decrease in the cerebral oximetry value occurred before pulse oximetry measured the decrease in oxygen saturation. This happened 4 times, and during all 4 of the hypercyanotic spells, the decrease of the cerebral oximeter value occurred 15 to 30 seconds before a change registered in the pulse oximetry value. For the first time, this case illustrates that cerebral oximetry monitoring may be able to identify the onset of hypercyanotic spells and desaturation before standard pulse oximetry. Cerebral oximetry may provide a quicker identification of acute changes in the clinical status of infants and children by identifying hypoxemia before pulse oximetry."

The study was done during the first 24 hours of life and the data were recorded continuously. The studies were 11.9 +/- 4.0- hours long, (mean +/- SD) and the difference between the pre- and postductal tcPO2 (delta TcPO2) was measured every 100 seconds. Of 9,872 determinations, the delta tcPO2 was less than or equal to 15 mm Hg in 90.1%, 16 to 29 mm Hg in 9.3%, and greater than or equal to 30 mm Hg in 0.6%. It was concluded that large differences between pre- and postductal oxygen tension are rare in infants with hyaline membrane disease. The results of this and other published data suggest that it is unlikely that measurement of PaO2 in the descending aorta or tcPO2 below the ductus places infants at an increased risk of having retinopathy of prematurity develop."
CD011912,0,1772678,0,Pulmonary hypertensive crises following surgery for congenital heart defects in young children.,"In this clinical study, 20 high risk infants and neonates were monitored to identify and characterize pulmonary hypertensive crises following surgery for congenital cardiac defects. Monitoring included right ventricular or pulmonary artery pressure catheters and transcutaneous oximetry. Eleven patients also had continuous analog recording of hemodynamic data so that antecedents of crises and the sequence of events following treatment could be reconstructed. Eleven of the 20 patients had one or more crises. Six of these ultimately died whereas 5 patients survived with aggressive vasodilator therapy. Four patients without crises but with episodic pulmonary hypertension benefitted from pulmonary vasodilator therapy to ease weaning from ventilatory support. Typically, each crisis was associated with a stress event. Crises were difficult to ablate if not rapidly treated and multiple crises would often cluster following an initial event. High dose narcotic (fentanyl) analgesia was found to be important in the postoperative management. Tolazoline and oxygen were the most consistently useful vasodilators, but isoproterenol and nitrates also played a role. Five of the children who died were examined post mortem: histologically, there was increased pulmonary arterial muscularization in 2, in none were there changes of fixed pulmonary vascular disease. The postoperative management must be individualized on the basis of monitored responses of pulmonary circulation."

In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effects of pulsatile perfusion (PP) and nonpulsatile perfusion (NP) on cerebral regional oxygen saturation (rSO₂) and endothelin-1 (ET-1) in pediatric tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) patients undergoing open heart surgery with CPB. Forty pediatric patients were randomly divided into the PP group (n = 20) and the NP group (n = 20). Pulsatile patients used a modified roller pump during the cross-clamp period in CPB, while NP patients used a roller pump with continuous flat flow perfusion. The subjects were monitored for rSO₂ from the beginning of the operation until 6 h after returning to the intensive care unit (ICU). We also monitored the hemodynamic status and ET-1 concentration and plasma free hemoglobin (PFH) in blood samples of all patients over time. Effective PP was monitored in PP patients, and pulse pressure was significantly higher in the PP group than in the NP group (P < 0.01). rSO₂ of the PP group was higher than that of the NP group (P < 0.01) during the cross-clamp period, and this advantage of PP would be maintained until 2 h after patients returned to the ICU (P < 0.05). ET-1 level in blood samples was lower at clamping off and CPB weaning and early ICU period in the PP group than in the NP group (P < 0.01), and ET-1 concentration remained at a normal level after patients were transferred to the ICU 24 h in all patients. PFH levels in the PP group at pre-clamp off and CPB weaned off were higher than those of the NP group (P < 0.05) in these cyanotic patients. PP can increase rSO₂ and improve microcirculation during cross-clamping period in TOF pediatric patients, while PP resulted in more severe hemolysis in these cyanotic patients than NP."

Eight cases underwent the operation under cardiopulmonary bypass and 7 of whom under no cardiac clamp. Seven cases received cavopulmonary anastomosis by flaring method and one case by end-side anastomosis. All the patients underwent the intracardiac tunnels to drain inferior vena cava and plus 4 mm fenestration except one. The results showed that 6 patients had postoperative oxygen saturation more than 90%, sinus rhythm, no anastomostic stoma obstruction, no flow regurgitation and CVP < 16 cmH2O. Two (25%) patients died postoperatively from high venous pressure of 18-20 cmH2O, finally from cardiac failure and anoxima. It was concluded that TCPC was an effective treatment for complex congenital cardiac diseases, especially with ventricular maldevelopment. Intracardiac tunnel plus 4 mm fenestration and flaring cavopulmonary anastomosis could prevent the postoperative complications. Larger anastomotic stoma, venous pressure less than 16 cmH2O and artery saturation more than 90% might indicate excellent TCPC procedures in our experience."

The significance of these studies remains debatable, as the ability of the anatomically normal neonatal heart to increase coronary flow is currently unknown. This study was designed to establish normal values for CFR in newborns after administration of adenosine [pharmacologic CFR (pCFR)] and as induced by acute hypoxemia (reactive CFR). Thirteen mechanically ventilated newborn lambs were studied. Coronary flow velocities were measured in the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery before and after adenosine injection (140 and 280 microg/kg i.v.) using an intracoronary 0.014-in Doppler flow-wire. Measurements were made at normal oxygen saturation (SaO(2)) and during progressive hypoxemia induced by lowering the fraction of inspired oxygen. CFR was defined as the ratio of hyperemic to basal average peak flow velocity. In a hemodynamically stable situation with normal SaO(2), pCFR was 3.0 +/- 0.5. pCFR decreased with increasing hypoxemia. Regression analysis showed a linear relation between SaO(2) and pCFR (R = 0.86, p < 0.0001). Reactive CFR obtained at severe hypoxemia (Sao(2) <30%) was 4.2 +/- 0.8, and no significant further increase in coronary flow velocity occurred by administration of adenosine. Newborn lambs have a similar capacity to increase coronary flow in response to both pharmacologic and reactive stimuli as older subjects. Administration of adenosine does not reveal the full capacity of the newborn coronary circulation to increase flow, however, as the flow increase caused by severe hypoxemia is significantly more pronounced."

Infants at higher risk of anomaly such as those born preterm are highlighted. Aspects of the examination itself are reviewed, such as detection of congenital heart disease, and the relatively poor detection rate which does not seem to be improving. Potential advantages of additional screening with pulse oximetry are covered. The paper also discusses screening for developmental dysplasia of the hip, which the UK national screening council is unsure of the benefit of, the difficulties of detecting all cases of cleft palate and problems with screening for the very important congenital cataract. The authors draw attention to the relative rarity of some conditions and reflected on how this complicates screening."

CD011912,0,7265800,0,[Non-invasive determination of oxygen saturation with the oxygenmet pulse wave oximeter. Comparison with the invasive reflectometric method (author's transl)].,"Oxygen saturation was determined non-invasively with the oxygenmet pulse wave oximeter 1471 and at the same time with the invasive reflectometric method. The determinations were carried out on 49 children (males = 24, females = 25) during 52 catherizations of the heart. Among these children aged between one week and 15 years were 11 children suffering from cyanotic heart disease. Depending on age and health condition 1-8 blood samples from different arterial regions were analysed reflectometrically. The comparison between the oxygen saturations determined non-invasively with the oxygenmet oximeter and the oxygen saturations obtained invasively with the aid of the reflectometric method, showed a very close correlation (r = 0.923), however the differences were statistically significant. The comparison of the calculated regression line with the ideal regression line revealed that the values of the two methods differed considerably, especially in the range of low oxygen saturations. The causes for these differences, especially the absorption effect of the skin and the subcutaneous tissue of cyanotic patients, were discussed."
CD011912,0,1713240,0,Percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty of stenotic standard Blalock-Taussig shunts: effect on choice of initial palliation in cyanotic congenital heart disease.,"To date, attempted balloon dilation of stenotic standard Blalock-Taussig shunts has been largely disappointing. It has been suggested that this may be due to the use of balloons of insufficient diameter. Balloon dilation of stenotic Blalock-Taussig shunts was attempted with use of relatively large balloons in five patients (11 to 67 months old) with cyanotic heart disease who were becoming progressively cyanotic and polycythemic (hemoglobin 17.9 +/- 1.1 g/dl) because of discrete shunt stenosis at the site of pulmonary anastomosis. Balloon diameters selected were equal to or within 1 mm of the unobstructed proximal shunt diameter. Before balloon dilation the diameter at the site of the stenosis was 2.8 +/- 0.8 mm (range 1.7 to 4); after balloon dilation it was 5.7 +/- 1.1 mm (range 4.5 to 7.5). The diameter increased in all patients (range 2.0 to 3.5 mm); the mean increase was 2.8 +/- 0.2 mm (p less than 0.005). Expressed as a percent, the increase in diameter at the stenosis ranged from 80% to 182.4% (mean 108.2 +/- 16.8%). Before balloon dilation the systemic oxygen saturation was 72.8 +/- 9.2% (range 55% to 80%) and after balloon dilation it was 83.6 +/- 2.9% (range 80% to 87%). A satisfactory increase (range 6% to 25%) in blood oxygen saturation was seen in all patients; the mean increase was 10.8 +/- 3.2% (p less than 0.01). At follow-up, the oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry was 85.8 +/- 2.9% (mean 5.8 +/- 1.7 months after balloon dilation) and the hemoglobin was 15.6 +/- 1.9 g/dl (mean 6.6 +/- 1.5 months after balloon dilation).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

CD011912,0,8445919,0,Staged Fontan operation for complex cardiac anomalies with subaortic obstruction.,"Ventricular hypertrophy is a recognized risk factor for the Fontan operation in cases of complex cardiac anomalies with unrestricted pulmonary blood flow and subaortic obstruction. Between 1986 and 1991 we have treated 23 such patients with a new type of palliation combining a main pulmonary artery-ascending aorta anastomosis with a bidirectional cavopulmonary anastomosis. Their ages averaged 57 +/- 36 months (7 to 155 months). Nine patients had (S,L,L) single ventricule with transposition and the other 14 had more complex cardiac anomalies unsuitable for biventricular repair. Subaortic obstruction was defined by a hemodynamic criterion (n = 6) or by a morphologic criterion (n = 17). There were five hospital deaths (21.7%): All three patients older than 7 years of age died (p = not significant). Follow-up averaged 28 +/- 21 months (range 1 to 58 months). Among the 18 hospital survivors, the proportions surviving 1 and 5 years after the operation were 78% and 63%, respectively. Control cardiac catheterization in 11 patients showed no or trivial subaortic gradient, a mean cavopulmonary pressure of 10 +/- 3 mm Hg, and a mean arterial oxygen saturation of 83%. Nine patients underwent secondary Fontan repair in our institution 21 +/- 4 months after palliation, without deaths. Another patient died elsewhere, 3.7 years after palliation, as a result of hemorrhage at sternal reentry during attempted Fontan operation (overall mortality at repair, 10%). The other eight patients are awaiting Fontan operation. This staged approach reduces both pressure and volume ventricular load and provides adequate oxygenation before the Fontan operation. In our experience, it resulted in reduced mortality at definitive repair."

CD011912,0,9279186,0,Use of methohexital for elective intubation in neonates.,"The effectiveness and safety of a short acting barbiturate, methohexital, was assessed for its use at the time of elective intubation in 18 newborn infants with severe respiratory or cardiac conditions. Evaluation included the speed of action and the degree of relaxation, sedation, and sleep in the first five minutes after administration. All newborn infants were intubated in a fully relaxed and somnolent state. In most infants recovery was completed within five minutes. A slight to moderate oxygen saturation drop was observed during the period of intubation, especially in patients with cyanotic heart disease. The side effects of the drug were twitching and a slight drop in blood pressure. In conclusion, methohexital seems to be a useful drug for short term anaesthesia in neonates, during which, short procedures like elective intubation can be safely performed."

CD011912,0,28043739,0,Canadian Cardiovascular Society/Canadian Pediatric Cardiology Association Position Statement on Pulse Oximetry Screening in Newborns to Enhance Detection of Critical Congenital Heart Disease.,"Congenital heart disease is the most common congenital malformation and approximately 3 in 1000 newborns have critical congenital heart disease (CCHD). Timely diagnosis affects morbidity, mortality, and disability, and newborn pulse oximetry screening has been studied to enhance detection of CCHD. In this position statement we present an evaluation of the literature for pulse oximetry screening. Current detection strategies including prenatal ultrasound examination and newborn physical examination are limited by low diagnostic sensitivity. Pulse oximetry screening is safe, noninvasive, easy to perform, and widely available with a high specificity (99.9%) and moderately high sensitivity (76.5%). When an abnormal saturation is obtained, the likelihood of having CCHD is 5.5 times greater than when a normal result is obtained. The use of pulse oximetry combined with current strategies has shown sensitivities of up to 92% for detecting CCHD. False positive results can be minimized by screening after 24 hours, and testing the right hand and either foot might further increase sensitivity. Newborns with abnormal screening results should undergo a comprehensive assessment and echocardiography performed if a cardiac cause cannot be excluded. Screening has been studied to be cost neutral to cost effective. We recommend that pulse oximetry screening should be routinely performed in all healthy newborns to enhance the detection of CCHD in Canada."
CD011912,0,26714814,0,Elevated Plasma Connective Tissue Growth Factor Levels in Children with Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Associated with Congenital Heart Disease.,"We aimed to investigate plasma connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) levels in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) associated with congenital heart disease (CHD) (PAH-CHD) in children and the relationships of CTGF with hemodynamic parameters. Plasma CTGF levels were calculated in 30 children with CHD, 30 children with PAH-CHD and 25 health volunteers, using the subtraction method. Cardiac catheterization was performed to measure clinical hemodynamic parameters. Plasma CTGF levels were significantly higher in PAH-CHD than in those with CHD and health volunteers (p < 0.01). In cyanotic PAH-CHD, plasma CTGF levels were significantly elevated compared with acyanotic PAH-CHD in the same group (p < 0.05). Plasma CTGF levels showed positive correlation with B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) in PAH-CHD (r = 0.475, p < 0.01), while oxygen saturation was inversely related to plasma CTGF levels (r = -0.436, p < 0.05). There was no correlation between CTGF and hemodynamic parameters. Even though the addition of CTGF to BNP did not significantly increase area under curve for diagnosis of PAH-CHD compared with BNP alone (p > 0.05), it revealed a moderately better specificity, positive predictive value and positive likelihood ratio than BNP alone. Plasma CTGF levels could be a promising diagnostic biomarker for PAH-CHD in children."
CD011912,0,16211399,1,The contribution of pulse oximetry to the early detection of congenital heart disease in newborns.,"Approximately half of all newborns with congenital heart disease are asymptomatic in the first few days of life. Early detection of ductal-dependant cardiac malformations prior to ductal closure is, however, of significant clinical importance, as the treatment outcome is related to the time of diagnosis. Pulse oximetry has been proposed for early detection of congenital heart disease. The aims of the present study were: 1) to determine the effectiveness of a pulse-oximetric screening performed on the first day of life for the detection of congenital heart disease in otherwise healthy newborns and 2) to determine if a pulse-oximetric screening combined with clinical examination is superior in the diagnosis of congenital heart disease to clinical examination alone. This is a prospective, multi-centre study. Postductal pulse oximetry was performed between six and twelve hours of age in all newborns of greater than 35 weeks gestation. If pulse-oximetry-measured arterial oxygen saturation was less than 95%, echocardiography was performed. Pulse oximetry was performed in 3,262 newborns. Twenty-four infants (0.7%) had repeated saturations of less than 95%. Of these infants, 17 had congenital heart disease and five of the remaining seven had persistent pulmonary hypertension. No infant with a ductal-dependant or cyanotic congenital heart disease exhibited saturation values greater or equal to 95%."

CD011912,0,24111376,0,Discovering hidden relationships in physiological signals for prediction of Periventricular Leukomalacia.,"This paper is concerned with predicting the occurrence of Periventricular Leukomalacia (PVL) using vital data which are collected over a period of twelve hours after neonatal cardiac surgery. The vital data contain heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), right atrium pressure (RAP), and oxygen saturation (SpO2). Various features are extracted from the data and are then ranked so that an optimal subset of features that have the highest discriminative capabilities can be selected. A decision tree (DT) is then developed for the vital data in order to identify the most important vital measurements. The DT result shows that high amplitude 20 minutes variations and low sample entropy in the data is an important factor for prediction of PVL. Low sample entropy represents lack of variability in hemodynamic measurement, and constant blood pressure with small fluctuations is an important indicator of PVL occurrence. Finally, using the different time frames of the collected data, we show that the first six hours of data contain sufficient information for PVL occurrence prediction."
CD011912,0,15298425,0,Cerebral saturations trend with mixed venous saturations in patients undergoing extracorporeal life support.,"Cerebral saturation (SCO2) monitors are noninvasive tools that continuously measure saturations in the cerebral cortex, a predominately venous bed. The purpose of this study was to see if a trend existed between measurements of SCO2 and mixed venous saturation values (SVO2) for patients on extracorporeal life support (ECLS). Six patients required ECLS for cardiac failure after congenital cardiac surgery, and one patient required ECLS for pulmonary failure. Patients were divided into two groups, those without systemic/pulmonary venous mixing (n = 3, Group I) and those with mixing due to an intraatrial shunt or left ventricular vent (n = 4, Group II). The age of patients was 0.4 +/- 0.5 years (mean +/- SD), weight was 5.2 +/- 2.3 kg, and time on ECLS was 8.3 +/- 4.8 days. No significant abnormalities were seen on head imaging. A total of 786 paired data points were collected. Mean values were different; however, there was a significant trend between SCO2 and SVO2 for the entire sample (R2 = 0.66, p < 0.001). Cerebral saturation trends follow mixed venous trends and, therefore, may be helpful in combination with other physical and laboratory findings in the care of the critically ill child."

In order to avoid repeated intubation and long-term mechanical ventilation or tracheotomy, we used nasal mask continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) as an alternative method for assisted ventilation. Within 24 hours the boy accepted the nasal mask and symptoms such as dyspnea and sweating disappeared. Respiratory movements became regular and oxygen saturation increased.

The mean follow-up period was 9.5 months (range 6 months to 1 year). The shunt was performed for cyanotic spells in 15 (75%) and hypoplastic pulmonary arteries in 5 (25%) patients. There were no immediate or late complications. None had cyanotic spell after the shunt. The mean arterial oxygen saturation improved from 66.47 +/- 11.9 to 76.97 +/- 8.16% (p = 0.0003) and mean hematocrit decreased from 51.55 +/- 9.5 to 46.5 +/- 9.7 (p = 0.002) after the shunt.

CD011912,0,11323338,0,The safety and efficacy of sevoflurane anesthesia in infants and children with congenital heart disease.,"We tested the hypothesis that sevoflurane is a safer and more effective anesthetic than halothane during the induction and maintenance of anesthesia for infants and children with congenital heart disease undergoing cardiac surgery. With a background of fentanyl (5 microg/kg bolus, then 5 microg. kg(-1). h(-1)), the two inhaled anesthetics were directly compared in a randomized, double-blinded, open-label study involving 180 infants and children. Primary outcome variables included severe hypotension, bradycardia, and oxygen desaturation, defined as a 30% decrease in the resting mean arterial blood pressure or heart rate, or a 20% decrease in the resting arterial oxygen saturation, for at least 30 s. There were no differences in the incidence of these variables; however, patients receiving halothane experienced twice as many episodes of severe hypotension as those who received sevoflurane (P = 0.03). These recurrences of hypotension occurred despite an increased incidence of vasopressor use in the halothane-treated patients than in the sevoflurane-treated patients. Multivariate stepwise logistic regression demonstrated that patients less than 1 yr old were at increased risk for hypotension compared with older children (P = 0.0004), and patients with preoperative cyanosis were at increased risk for developing severe desaturation (P = 0.049). Sevoflurane may have hemodynamic advantages over halothane in infants and children with congenital heart disease."

The history of the patient was nonsignificant. On the physical examination, oxygen saturation of the patient on room air was 84%, and cardiac activity and a 2/6 systolic murmur at the right sternal border were found. On electrocardiography, deep q's were determined in D2, D3, and aVF. On echocardiography, left atrial isomerism, dextrocardia, wide, high venosum atrial septal defect, double outlet right ventricle with intact ventricular septum, malposition of the great arteries, and moderate pulmonary stenosis were observed.

Despite a wide range of arterial blood pressure and hematocrits, arterial PO2 and transcutaneous PO2 were similar (slope, 0.963), except for 2 groups of sick infants. Some infants with severe, persistent pulmonary hypertension who were receiving an intravascular infusion of tolazoline and infants with mean arterial blood pressures more than 2.5 SD less than the predicted average had values for transcutaneous PO2 that were lower than PO2.

CD011912,0,23503930,0,Temporary atrial pacing for cardiac output after pediatric cardiac surgery.,"Pediatric cardiothoracic surgery is often associated with low cardiac output in the postoperative period. This study sought to determine whether increasing heart rate via temporary atrial pacing is beneficial in augmenting cardiac output. Patients younger than 18 years who underwent cardiothoracic surgery and had no perioperative arrhythmias were eligible for the study. Patients not paced postoperatively were atrial paced at a rate of 15 % above the intrinsic sinus rate (not to exceed 170 beats per minute, less for older patients) for 15 min. Patients paced for cardiac output postoperatively had their pacemakers paused for 15 min. Markers of cardiac output were measured before and after the intervention. Of the 60 patients who consented to participate, 30 completed the study. Failure to complete the study was due to tachycardia (n = 13), lack of pacing wires (n = 7), junctional rhythm (n = 4), advanced atrioventricular block (n = 3), and other cause (n = 3). Three patients were paced at baseline. There was no change in arteriovenous oxygen saturation difference, mean arterial blood pressure, central venous pressure, toe temperature, or lactate with atrial pacing. Atrial pacing was associated with a decrease in head and flank near-infrared spectroscopy (p = 0.01 and <0.01 respectively). Secondary analysis found an inverse relationship between mean arterial pressure response to pacing and bypass time. Temporary atrial pacing does not improve cardiac output after pediatric cardiac surgery and may be deleterious. Future research may identify subsets of patients who benefit from this strategy. Practitioners considering this strategy should carefully evaluate each patient's response to atrial pacing before its implementation."

We examined the changes of oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO2), deoxygenated hemoglobin (HHb), total hemoglobin (tHb) concentration, cytochrome oxidase (CytOx) oxygenation, and cerebral tissue oxygenation index (TOI) in 13 children. A significant increase in cerebral HbO2 and tHb at the beginning of i.v. sildenafil administration with a decrease in HHb was observed. These changes led to a significant elevation in cerebral TOI from 63.4 +/- 2.5% to 65.7 +/- 2.8%, whereas mean systemic arterial pressure and arterial oxygen partial pressure tended to decrease. In conclusion, we observed a reversible increase of HbO2, tHb, and hemoglobin oxygen saturation in the scanned tissue section after i.v. sildenafil administration. These findings may be clinically relevant because they indicate that after cardiac surgery, sildenafil may increase cerebral blood flow (CBF), probably due to general endothelial dysfunction after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB)."
CD011912,0,21414077,0,Cerebral oximetry for pediatric anesthesia: why do intelligent clinicians disagree?,"Reflectance near-infrared spectroscopy has been used to measure cortical tissue oximetry for more than 30 years. In that time, many centers have adopted the routine use of the cerebral oximeter for children having repair of congenital heart lesions, while some prominent academic centers have resisted routine use of these monitors citing lack of definitive evidence for outcome benefit. In this review, we provide an overview of the method used to measure cerebral oximetry, as well as validation and clinical outcome data that have accrued from the use of cerebral oximeters. We discuss the peculiarities of evidentiary review for monitoring devices, and the confounding errors that occur when a monitor is evaluated as a therapeutic intervention. We outline the physiologic basis of cerebral desaturation and the shifts in practice that have occurred with implementation of NIRS monitoring."

Of the total group, 26 (39%) of the patients remained in functional Class I or II and 41 (61%) progressed at some time into Class III or IV. Death occurred in 14 (21%) of the patients, and these were characterized by one or more of the following features: (1) they were in functional Class III or IV, (2) they had moderate to severe cardiomegaly with a cardiothoracic ratio greater than 0.65, (3) they had cyanosis or an arterial oxygen saturation of less than 90%, and (4) they were infants when the diagnosis was made (10 patients, of whom 5 died). In patients in Class III or IV, a comparison was made between patients treated medically (10) and those treated surgically--either with tricuspid valve replacement (15) or with a modified tricuspid annuloplasty (16). It appears that modified tricuspid annuloplasty is the procedure of choice, because despite an operative mortality of 25% (4 patients), 12 of the 16 patients so treated improved clinically or had a reduction in heart size."
CD011912,0,1402184,0,[Glucose tolerance and insulin secretion in infants with the left to right shunt congenital heart disease].,"Between 1980 and 1988, 32 infants under three years of age with left to right shunt congenital heart disease underwent cardiac catheterizations, and their glucose tolerance and insulin secretion were investigated. These patients were divided into three groups by weight and compared. Group I consisted of 11 patients whose weights were 80% or more of the ideal body weight (IBW) for their age. Group II consisted of 10 patients whose weights were between 70% and 80% of the IBW. Group III consisted of 11 patients whose weights were less than 70% of the IBW. The CTR and biochemical blood studies showed no difference. By cardiac catheterization, Group III showed higher pulmonary/systemic vascular pressure ratio (Pp/Ps) than Group I. The mixed venous O2 saturation (SvO2) were 69.5 +/- 6.41% in Group I, 64.8 +/- 5.78% in Group II, 57.2 +/- 3.59% in Group III. Group III showed the lowest SvO2 of the three. Group III also showed the lowest arterial O2 saturation (SaO2). This indicates that the patients of Group III had the most serious congestive heart failure. In the 0.5 g/kg intravenous glucose tolerance tests, the K values (glucose disappearance rates) were as follows: Group I: 3.30 +/- 0.597, Group II: 2.91 +/- 0.624, Group III: 2.48 +/- 0.417. Group III showed the lowest values of the three. This indicates the deterioration of glucose tolerance in Group III. In the examination of serum insulin secretion, Group III showed the lowest serum insulin levels: 26.6 +/- 18.3 mmu/ml at 3-minute intervals, 22.8 +/- 14.3 mmu/ml at 5-minute intervals. After cardiac catheterization, corrective operations were performed on 17 patients out of 32. Fifteen patients survived, though 2 patients of Group III died early postoperatively. The results of glucose tolerance test and serum insulin levels before and after operation in 12 survivors were compared. Although the K values had been 2.8 +/- 0.41 before operation, it rose up to 3.81 +/- 0.81 three to four weeks after operation. The serum insulin levels at 3, 5, 10 and 15-minute intervals also rose after operation. This indicates the improvement of glucose tolerance and insulin secretion due to the improved circulation. It is suggested that the adequate nutritional management before and after operation on infants with serious congestive heart failure, because they tend to have malnutrition before operation. Aggressive and careful nutritional management is advisable."
CD011912,0,2520636,0,The relevance of intraoperative pressure and oxygen saturation monitoring during pulmonary artery banding in infancy.,"Different methods have been used to define an effective and tolerable degree of pulmonary artery banding (PAB) intraoperatively. As the hemodynamic response determines the results, a reduction of risk could be expected by evaluating several selected parameters and adjusting the band accordingly. Between 1981 and 1986, PAB was performed in 12 infants, three with complex cardiac lesions and nine with complete atrioventricular canal defects. Pressures in the distal pulmonary artery, in a systemic artery or the aorta, and in a central vein were monitored, and oxygen saturation measurements in both great arteries were taken before, during, and after the procedure. Adequate, complicated, intolerable, and contraindicated constriction were recognized and shown on characteristic pressure traces and oxygen saturation shifts. The measurements provided an indirect but reliable indication of the change in intracardiac shunting, and predicted whether the banding would be hemodynamically tolerated. Postoperatively, ten of the infants improved significantly, especially the seven infants previously in a low cardiac output state. One infant died on the day of surgery from acute right heart failure (8% hospital mortality). The results suggest that hemodynamically controlled PAB is an effective palliative treatment with a lower risk than had been previously reported."

CD011912,0,17015513,0,Report of the Tennessee Task Force on Screening Newborn Infants for Critical Congenital Heart Disease.,"A member of the Tennessee state legislature recently proposed a bill that would mandate all newborn infants to undergo pulse oximetry screening for the purpose of identifying those with critical structural heart disease before discharge home. The Tennessee Task Force on Screening Newborn Infants for Critical Congenital Heart Defects was convened on September 29, 2005. This group reviewed the current medical literature on this topic, as well as data obtained from the Tennessee Department of Health, and debated the merits and potential detriments of a statewide screening program. The estimated incidence of critical congenital heart disease is 170 in 100,000 live births, and of those, 60 in 100,000 infants have ductal-dependent left-sided obstructive lesions with the potential of presentation by shock or death if the diagnosis is missed. Of the latter group, the diagnosis is missed in approximately 9 in 100,000 by fetal ultrasound assessment and discharge examination and might be identified by a screening program. Identification of the missed diagnosis in these infants before discharge could spare many of them death or neurologic sequelae. Four major studies using pulse oximetry screening were analyzed, and when data were restricted to critical left-sided obstructive lesions, sensitivity values of 0% to 50% and false-positive rates of between 0.01% and 12% were found in asymptomatic populations. Because of this variability and other considerations, a meaningful cost/benefit analysis could not be performed. It was the consensus of the task force to provide a recommendation to the legislature that mandatory screening not be implemented at this time. In addition, we determined that a very large, prospective, perhaps multistate study is needed to define the sensitivity and false-positive rates of lower-limb pulse oximetry screening in the asymptomatic newborn population and that there needs to be continued partnering between the medical community, parents, and local, state, and national governments in decisions regarding mandated medical care."

CD011912,0,3344685,0,Effect of iron deficiency on tissue oxygen delivery in cyanotic congenital heart disease.,"To test the hypothesis that tissue oxygen delivery would be affected by diminished oxygen stores in cyanotic congenital heart disease, serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, hemoglobin, red cell mean corpuscular volume (MCV), red cell 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (DPG), P50, blood gases, oxygen saturations and systemic oxygen transport were measured in 29 hypoxemic infants and children. For the group, aortic saturation was 81 +/- 9%, PaO2 was 50 +/- 12 mm Hg, hemoglobin 16.2 +/- 2.1 gm/dl and systemic oxygen transport 620 +/- 145 ml/min/m2. P50 was increased above normal values (28.8 +/- 2.3 vs 26.6 +/- 1.1 mm Hg, p less than 0.01), and DPG was 2.35 +/- 0.54 mumol/ml, at the upper limits of normal for this assay. Iron deficiency was present in 8. When patients with P50 greater than or equal to 30 mm Hg and P50 less than 30 mm Hg were compared, iron stores were diminished in the high P50 group: [serum ferritin (19 +/- 8 vs 53 +/- 48 ng/ml, p = 0.0006), transferrin saturation (11 +/- 6 vs 23 +/- 11%, p = 0.003) and MCV (79 +/- 8 vs 86 +/- 4 fl, p = 0.05)]. Hemoglobin, aortic oxygen saturation, PaO2 and systemic oxygen transport were similar in both groups. In children with iron sufficiency, 15 of 21 had MCV greater than 90th percentile for age and sex (p less than 0.001 versus expected distribution). Also, MCV greater than 90th percentile for age and sex had a positive predictive value of 0.88 for iron sufficiency. This study demonstrates that diminished iron stores in cyanotic congenital heart disease are associated with a more right-shifted oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve (increased P50).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD011912,0,1865701,0,Results of total cavopulmonary connection in the treatment of patients with a functional single ventricle.,"Total cavopulmonary connection was proposed as a modification of the Fontan procedure that might have greater benefits than previous methods. To assess this procedure we reviewed case histories of 38 patients (aged 17 months to 30 years) who underwent Fontan procedures with cavopulmonary anastomoses between January 1987 and December 1989. The group included 32 patients with univentricular heart, 2 with pulmonary atresia and intact ventricular septum, 3 with tricuspid atresia, and 1 with hypoplastic left heart syndrome. One or more previous palliative procedures were performed in 34 patients, including 19 systemic-pulmonary shunts, 16 pulmonary artery bandings, 7 atrial septectomies/septostomies, 7 Glenn shunts, and 1 patent ductus arteriosus ligation. Preoperative hemodynamics showed a pulmonary artery pressure of 12 mm Hg (range 6 to 22 mm Hg), pulmonary-systemic flow ratio of 1.6 (range 0.37 to 3.0), left ventricular end-diastolic pressure 9 mm Hg (range 3 to 15 mm Hg), and systemic arterial oxygen saturation of 82% (range 67% to 94%). Concomitant with cavopulmonary connection, 13 patients underwent additional procedures, including 9 atrioventricular valve annuloplasties, 4 Damus-Stansel-Kaye procedures, and 2 resections of subaortic membranes. Modifying the Fontan procedure in this fashion was particularly useful in the management of 2 patients with pulmonary atresia and intact ventricular septum who had right ventricular-dependent coronary blood flow. Cavopulmonary anastomosis and atrial septectomy were performed in both patients, with resultant inflow of oxygenated blood to the right ventricle and coronary arteries. Excellent postoperative results were noted in each. Postextubation hemodynamics for the entire group included a mean right atrial pressure of 13 mm Hg (range 11 to 17 mm Hg), a mean left atrial pressure of 6 mm Hg (range 3 to 12 mm Hg), and a room air oxygen saturation of 96% (range 92% to 98%). Seven patients had pleural effusions, 3 required postoperative pacemaker placement, and 2 required reoperation for tamponade. A venous assist device was required in one patient on the second postoperative day, but the patient was weaned successfully within 24 hours. One early death (2.6%) occurred in a patient who had intractable ventricular fibrillation 2 days after operation. There was one late cardiac death (2.7%) caused by ventricular failure and one late noncardiac death. These results demonstrate that total cavopulmonary connection provides excellent early definitive treatment, with low morbidity and mortality, for a variety of complex congenital heart lesions."
CD011912,0,16506004,0,Cerebral oxygenation and cerebral oxygen extraction in the preterm infant: the impact of respiratory distress syndrome.,"Haemodynamic factors play an important role in the etiology of cerebral lesions in preterm infants. Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), a common problem in preterms, is strongly related with low and fluctuating arterial blood pressure. This study investigated the relation between mean arterial blood pressure (MABP), fractional cerebral oxygen saturation (ScO2) and fractional (cerebral) tissue oxygen extraction (FTOE), a measure of oxygen utilisation of the brain, during the first 72 h of life. Thirty-eight infants (gestational age < 32 week) were included, 18 with and 20 without RDS. Arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2), MABP and near infrared spectroscopy-determined ScO2 were continuously measured. FTOE was calculated as a ratio: (SaO2-ScO2)/SaO2. Gestational age and birth weight did not differ between groups, but assisted ventilation and use of inotropic drugs were more common in RDS infants (P<0.01). MABP was lower in RDS patients (P<0.05 from 12 up to 36 h after birth), but increased in both groups over time. ScO2 and FTOE were not different between groups over time, but in RDS infants ScO2 and FTOE had substantial larger variance (P<0.05 at all time points except at 36-48 h for ScO2 and P<0.05 at 12-18, 18-24, 36-48 and 48-60 h for FTOE). During the first 72 h of life, RDS infants showed more periods of positive correlation between MABP and ScO2 (P<0.05 at 18-24, 24-36 36-48 48-60 h) and negative correlation between MABP and FTOE (P<0.05 at 18-24, 36-48 h). Although we found that the patterns of cerebral oxygenation and extraction in RDS infants were not different as compared to infants without RDS, we suggest that the frequent periods with possible lack of cerebral autoregulation in RDS infants may make these infants more vulnerable to cerebral damage."
CD011912,0,24165823,0,Splanchnic oxygen saturation immediately after weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass can predict early postoperative outcomes in children undergoing congenital heart surgery.,"This study compared the abilities of cerebral, renal, and splanchnic regional oxygen saturation (rSO2) immediately after weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) to predict early postoperative outcomes for children undergoing congenital heart surgery. The study enrolled 73 children (ages 0.1-72 months) undergoing corrective or palliative cardiac surgery requiring CPB. Laboratory and hemodynamic variables were analyzed at the time of successful weaning from CPB. Using near-infrared spectroscopy, cerebral, renal, and splanchnic rSO2 values were obtained simultaneously. Early postoperative outcome measures included the maximum vasoactive inotropic score (VIS(max)) during the first 36 postoperative hours, the duration of mechanical ventilation, and the postoperative hospital length of stay. In the univariate analysis, cerebral, renal, and splanchnic rSO2 values correlated significantly with early postoperative outcomes. However, splanchnic rSO2 was the only independent factor predicting VIS(max) (β = -0.302, P = 0.021), duration of mechanical ventilation (β = -0.390, P = 0.002), and postoperative hospital length of stay (β = -0.340, P = 0.001) by multivariate analyses. Splanchnic rSO2 had a larger receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (AUC) for determining high VIS(max), prolonged mechanical ventilation, and longer postoperative hospital stay (AUC 0.775, 0.792, and 0.776, respectively) than cerebral (AUC 0.630, 0.638, and 0.632, respectively) and renal (AUC 0.703, 0.716, and 0.715, respectively) rSO2. After weaning from CPB, splanchnic rSO2 may be superior to rSO2 measured from brain and kidney in predicting an increased requirement for vasoactive inotropic support, a prolonged mechanical ventilation, and a longer postoperative hospital stay for children."
CD011912,0,7097973,0,Surgical results and factors affecting operative mortality in total anomalous pulmonary venous drainage.,"Factors affecting the surgical results of total anomalous pulmonary venous drainage were evaluated in 17 patients in an attempt to establish an appropriate plan of management. The mortality rate correlated with age, size of interatrial communication, arterial oxygen saturation and left heart volume but not with pulmonary to systemic systolic pressure ratio, vascular resistance ratio and right ventricular volume. In cases where the symptoms appeared early in life, left heart volume was small and clinical features were severe. Four children with a left ventricular end-diastolic volume of less than 65% of normal died of low cardiac output syndrome. In those with an unusually small left heart, enlargement of the left atrium and/or delayed ligation of the anomalous vertical vein were considered more favorable. Left atrial and ventricular volumes were restored to normal after the surgery."

CD011912,0,1586172,0,Pulmonary and systemic arterial pressure in hyaline membrane disease.,"Systolic pulmonary arterial pressure was determined serially over the first 10 days of life in 33 babies with hyaline membrane disease by measuring the peak velocity of pansystolic tricuspid valve regurgitation, using Doppler ultrasound, and applying the Bernoulli equation. Results are presented in age groups 0-12, 13-36, 37-72, and 73-96 hours respectively. The incidence of tricuspid valve regurgitation was 92, 97, 80, and 64% (falling to 35% by day 10) compared with 53, 50, 31, and 0% in 17 healthy premature infants. In comparing healthy babies with those with hyaline membrane disease, no allowance was made for right atrial pressure. The derived 'right ventricle to right atrial (RV-RA) pressure difference', was expressed as a ratio of systemic arterial (systolic) pressure. Over the first three days, this ratio fell much faster in the healthy babies. Values were 0.78:1, 0.77:1, and 0.72:1 in babies with hyaline membrane disease and 0.87:1, 0.53:1, and 0.44:1 in healthy babies. Ductal patency was prolonged in babies with hyaline membrane disease (75% on day 4 compared with 6% in healthy babies). The incidence of bidirectional ductal flow, indicating balanced pulmonary and systemic arterial pressures, was 79, 53, 30, and 20%, and in healthy babies was 41% at 0-12 hours and zero thereafter. Pulmonary arterial pressure was then calculated by adding a right atrial pressure estimate of 5 mm Hg to the RV-RA difference when the babies were ventilated. Babies of lower gestation had lower values. The pulmonary: systemic arterial pressure ratio showed considerable temporal variability, but fell with age and was raised by high mean airway pressure and pneumothorax (through a reduction in systemic pressure), and less noticeably by carbon dioxide tension. It did not correlate significantly with other indices of disease severity. Hyaline membrane disease is associated with delayed postnatal circulatory adaptation characterized by pulmonary hypertension, systemic hypotension, and prolonged ductal patency."

CD011912,0,8544112,0,Oxygen saturations during breast and bottle feedings in infants with congenital heart disease.,"Bottle feeding is commonly advised for infants with congenital heart disease (CHD) based on the belief that breast feeding is too difficult for them. However, studies of preterm infants have shown that greater cardiorespiratory effort occurs during bottle feeding than during breast feeding. The purpose of this study is to determine if there is a relationship between feeding method (breast vs. bottle) and oxygen saturations (SaO2) in infants with CHD. In a correlational design, pulse oximetry measured SaO2 during one breast and one bottle feeding in each of 7 infants with CHD. SaO2 during breast feeding is significantly different from SaO2 during bottle feeding (F = 59.72, p < .0001). SaO2 during breast feeding is higher on average and less variable (M = 96.3%, SD = 2.2) than SaO2 during bottle feedings (M = 92.5%, SD = 6.9), indicating that there is less cardiorespiratory stress with breast feeding. None of the infants desaturated (SaO2 < 90%) during breast feedings, whereas four infants desaturated during bottle feedings."

CD011912,0,842463,0,Bronchopulmonary circulation in d-transposition of the great arteries: possible role in genesis of accelerated pulmonary vascular disease.,"Hemodynamic and angiograhic data from 209 patients with d-transposition of the great arteries were reviewed to estimate the incidence of prominent bronchopulmonary circulation and to explore its role in the genesis of accelerated pulmonary vascular disease in these patients. The degree of bronchopulmonary circulation was assessed visually by considering the extent of the pulmonary arterial opacification and the circulation to the left atrium. An initial survey study revealed a marked degree of collateral circulation in 20 of 138 patients with d-transposition having cardiac catheterization before age 2 years at the Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, between 1967 and 1972. Detailed analysis of 71 additional patients with d-transposition aged 1 week to 72 months (mean 17 months) studied at Children's Memorial Hospital, Chicago, between 1967 and 1974 showed collateral circulation of marked degree in 23 and of mild degree in 14. The bronchopulmonary collateral vessels were more freqently demonstrated in the patients with intact ventricular septum than in those with ventricular septal defect or left ventricular outflow tract stenosis. In a prospective study in 12 of 15 patients during cardiac catheterization the functional patency of the bronchopulmonary collateral circulation was demonstrated by obstructing pulmonary blood flow in the right or left pulmonary artery, or both, with an inflated balloon and obtaining from the pulmonary arterial segment distal to the occlusion blood with an oxygen saturation similar to that of the aorta. A hypothesis is presented concerning the role of systemic hypoxemia and local pulmonary hypoxemia induced by way of the bronchopulmonary collateral vessels and the bronchial arterial vasovasorum in promoting pulmonary vasoconstriction. It is suggested that increased pulmonary blood flow and pressure due to the physiologic features of ventricular septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus or transposition of the great vessels, in the face of this regionally increased hypoxemia results in accelerated pulmonary vascular disease."
CD011912,0,9462547,0,Effect of non-pulsatile renal blood flow on plasma erythropoietin.,"Erythropoietin is a hormone responsible for regulation of red blood cell production. Circulating erythropoietin values are regulated by renal oxygen supply, which is determined by hemoglobin concentration, hemoglobin oxygen saturation, and renal blood flow. Previous animal and human studies regarding erythropoietin regulation have assumed pulsatile renal blood flow. During cardiopulmonary bypass, non-pulsatile renal perfusion has been shown to result in decreased glomerular filtration rate and decreased renal blood flow in comparison to pulsatile perfusion. Repair of congenital heart disease during cardiopulmonary bypass is an attractive circumstance in which to study the effect of non-pulsatile blood flow on erythropoietin production. The hypothesis in this study was that non-pulsatile perfusion would result in increased erythropoietin production because of decreased renal oxygen supply. Fourteen children with congenital heart disease and without preoperative renal insufficiency or anemia were enrolled in the study. All patients underwent cardiopulmonary bypass with non-pulsatile flow. In addition, 10 control patients without congenital heart disease were enrolled. Six cardiopulmonary bypass patients had 1.5- to 6-fold increases in plasma erythropoietin concentrations from baseline. These patients had longer cardiopulmonary bypass times, more commonly performed under low flow deep hypothermic conditions. The remaining 8 patients with congenital heart disease, and all control patients, did not develop increased postoperative erythropoietin concentrations. The conditions under which cardiopulmonary bypass are performed appear to influence postoperative circulating erythropoietin concentrations."
CD011912,0,88172,0,Use of prostaglandin E1 in infants with d-transposition of the great arteries and intact ventricular septum.,Prostaglandin E1 was used to treat five infants with d-transposition of the great arteries and intact ventricular septum who had persistent severe hypoxemia after the creation of an interatrial communication. Three infants had a dramatic improvement in systemic arterial oxygen saturation associated with dilation of the ductus arteriosus; in two of the three cases urgent surgery was avoided. Two infants had no clinical evidence of increased ductal shunting and no improvement in oxygen saturation. A trial of prostaglandin E1 is recommended for treatment of severe hypoxemia in infants with d-transposition of the great arteries with intact ventricular septum if the presence of a large atrial septal defect is established.
CD011912,0,27160097,0,Pediatric Resident Attitudes and Knowledge of Critical Congenital Heart Disease Screening.,"This study aimed to understand the knowledge, attitudes and confidence level related to critical congenital heart disease (CCHD) screening among pediatric residents. Pediatric residents were assessed via an anonymous survey related to CCHD guidelines and procedures as set out by the New York State Department of Health. The survey was emailed to pediatric residents at a large academic institution. A teaching intervention was performed after the initial survey, which was followed by an identical after-intervention survey. Forty-two residents responded to the pre-intervention survey (n = 42), and forty post-intervention (n = 40). The mean composite knowledge score was 76 % pre-intervention and 92 % post-intervention, p < .001. Pre-intervention only 12 % of the respondents could answer all the questions correctly which increased to 60 % post-intervention. Confidence among residents regarding guidelines increased from 38 to 95 % post-intervention, p < .001. There was a positive correlation between the residents who felt confident of the guidelines and who answered correctly, r = .514, p < .001, n = 82. There was no significant difference between knowledge, attitudes or confidence level scores by year of training or the gender of the residents. Our study demonstrated a significant gap of knowledge among residents related to CCHD screening mandated by New York State health law. There was also a corresponding lack of confidence demonstrated by the residents in the guidelines. These data suggest that residents would benefit from further education on the proper implementation of a CCHD screening program. Further multicenter studies are warranted to assess similar gaps in other residency training programs in New York and wherever these screenings guidelines have been adopted."

CD011912,0,15283350,0,Home monitoring of infants after stage one palliation for hypoplastic left heart syndrome.,"Despite improved early results with the Norwood procedure (stage one palliation), patients remain with at-risk anatomy and interstage mortality continues to be a limitation of staged single ventricle palliation. Retrospective analyses have implicated residual or recurrent anatomic lesions as well as intercurrent illness as causes of interstage mortality. We hypothesized that potentially life-threatening anatomic lesions and illnesses would be manifest before serious physiologic impact by alteration in arterial saturation, failure to gain weight or in the case of dehydration, acute weight loss. As a result, we developed a home monitoring program of daily weights and oxygen saturations to earlier identify those patients at increased risk for interstage death. Frequent monitoring of these physiologic variables between stage one and two palliation identified life-threatening anatomic lesions and illness and permitted timely intervention that ultimately improved survival. All 36 survivors of the stage one palliation discharged from the hospital and entered into the home monitoring program survived the interstage period."
CD011912,0,27352321,0,The Optimum Level of Sevoflurane in Pediatric Echocardiography.,"Sevoflurane is shown to be safe and effective in pediatric echocardiography. This study explores the optimum level in pediatric echocardiography. One hundred and twenty children, with an age range of 35 days-3 years, were included in this study. The children with severe cyanotic congenital heart disease or severe pneumonia, which was Grade I or II according to the American College of Physicians Guideline Grading, were excluded. All children received the anesthesia with sevoflurane. The inhalation anesthesia level decreased from 2.5 to 1.0 %, with a decrement of 0.5 %. The induction time (T0), echocardiography time (T1), and time to awakening (T2) in each child were recorded, and the changes in the blood pressure, heart rate, breath, and oxygen saturation in each child were also monitored. The Ramsay scale scoring during anesthesia and the case number of failure in echocardiography in each group were also recorded. When the level of sevoflurane inhalation was maintained at 1.0 %, the childrens' scores were low, including 8 incompliant children, and p < 0.05 in comparison with other groups. The scores increased as the sevoflurane inhalation level increased. When the sevoflurane inhalation increased to 1.5 %, the children could sleep with stable blood pressure, and no dysphoria occurred during the echocardiography. When the sevoflurane inhalation level increased to 2.5 %, the Ramsay scores did not increase. However, the T2 significantly increased (p < 0.05). The blood pressure and heart rate in each group did not change significantly. With the premise of safety and efficacy in children, the optimum level of sevoflurane in pediatric echocardiography was 1.5-2.0 %."

CD011912,0,24326385,0,Cerebral oxygen metabolism in neonates with congenital heart disease quantified by MRI and optics.,"Neonatal congenital heart disease (CHD) is associated with altered cerebral hemodynamics and increased risk of brain injury. Two novel noninvasive techniques, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffuse optical and correlation spectroscopies (diffuse optical spectroscopy (DOS), diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS)), were employed to quantify cerebral blood flow (CBF) and oxygen metabolism (CMRO(2)) of 32 anesthetized CHD neonates at rest and during hypercapnia. Cerebral venous oxygen saturation (S(v)O(2)) and CBF were measured simultaneously with MRI in the superior sagittal sinus, yielding global oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) and global CMRO(2) in physiologic units. In addition, microvascular tissue oxygenation (StO(2)) and indices of microvascular CBF (BFI) and CMRO(2) (CMRO(2)(i)) in the frontal cortex were determined by DOS/DCS. Median resting-state MRI-measured OEF, CBF, and CMRO(2) were 0.38, 9.7 mL/minute per 100 g and 0.52 mL O(2)/minute per 100 g, respectively. These CBF and CMRO(2) values are lower than literature reports for healthy term neonates (which are sparse and quantified using different methods) and resemble values reported for premature infants. Comparison of MRI measurements of global S(v)O(2), CBF, and CMRO(2) with corresponding local DOS/DCS measurements demonstrated strong linear correlations (R(2)=0.69, 0.67, 0.67; P<0.001), permitting calibration of DOS/DCS indices. The results suggest that MRI and optics offer new tools to evaluate cerebral hemodynamics and metabolism in CHD neonates."

CD011912,0,1417234,0,Temperature monitoring during CPB in infants: does it predict efficient brain cooling?,"We examined jugular venous oxygen saturation data in 17 pediatric patients less than 1 year of age undergoing hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Jugular venous oxygen saturations (JvO2SATS) were measured before bypass and during the active core cooling portion of CPB. The study intervals during CPB included 1 minute after initiation of CPB, at a tympanic membrane temperature of 15 degrees C, and at a rectal temperature of 15 degrees C. During these measurement intervals, there were no significant changes in mean arterial pressure, pump flow rate, arterial oxygen saturation, mixed venous oxygen saturation, carbon dioxide tension, or hematocrit. Six of the 17 patients (29%) demonstrated a significantly lower JvO2SAT (87.1% +/- 6.3% versus 98.1% +/- 0.9%) at a tympanic membrane temperature of 15 degrees C. Patients demonstrating jugular venous desaturation could not be predicted from continuous monitoring of tympanic membrane and rectal temperatures or through on-line measurements of mixed venous oxygen saturation. Low JvO2SAT suggests higher levels of cerebral metabolism and cerebral uptake of oxygen. In the presence of deep hypothermic CPB and stable anesthetic levels, the most likely cause of a low JvO2SAT is inadequate cerebral cooling. We believe JvO2SAT monitoring may be an important adjunct to conventional temperature monitoring in the patient undergoing deep hypothermic CPB or total circulatory arrest."

Reported herein is the case of a 2-month-old boy who presented with refractory wheezing as a sign of cor triatriatum sinister (CTS) that culminated in overwhelming multiple organ failure in a short time. On the day of admission, oxygen saturation (SpO2 ) was <80%. Heart rate was 198 beats/min and respiratory rate 58 breaths/min. Chest radiogram showed pulmonary edema. Electrocardiogram showed right atrial enlargement and right ventricular hypertrophy. N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NTproBNP) was very high at >20,000 pg/mL. Two-dimensional echocardiography with Doppler showed CTS, which was complicated with severe pulmonary arterial hypertension due to flagrant pulmonary venous obstruction. Cardiac surgery was undertaken, after which pulmonary edema subsided, SpO2 increased to ≥96%, and NTproBNP dropped to normal.

CD011912,0,8534778,0,Acute effects of indomethacin on cerebral hemodynamics and oxygenation.,"Although an indomethacin-induced decrease of brain perfusion in preterm infants has been well established, the acute effects of this vasoactive drug on cerebral hemodynamics and oxygenation are not well documented. Using near infrared spectroscopy we monitored in 6 very preterm infants changes in cerebral blood volume (delta CBV) and cytochrome oxidase concentration (delta Cytaa3), used as relative measures of changes in brain perfusion and as an indicator for cellular oxygenation of brain tissue, during and up to 1 h after indomethacin infusion. delta CBV showed a quick blood-pressure-related increase as compared to baseline (preindomethacin values) during indomethacin infusion (averaged maximal increase 13%), followed by a sharp decrease below baseline values (averaged maximal decrease 24%). There was a sustained recovery to baseline during the registration period. delta Cytaa3 showed a small, early increase in 4 of 6 babies, followed by a substantial decrease below baseline in 5 babies. delta Cytaa3 showed only a partial recovery in those 5 babies during the study period. We conclude that a therapeutic dose of indomethacin may cause substantial swings in brain perfusion and a marked and rather longstanding decrease in Cytaa3, suggesting a decrease in cellular oxygenation of brain tissue. Awareness of these effects may be important in sick preterm babies during periods of pulmonary and cardiac instability."

CD011912,0,353242,0,Hemodynamics of congenital diaphragmatic hernia in lambs.,"Despite surgical treatment, congenital foramen of Bochdalek diaphragmatic hernia continues to carry a high mortality rate due to associated respiratory insufficiency. We studied the pathologic and hemodynamic changes that result from this condition in lambs. Surgical creation of diaphragmatic hernias in fetal lambs was performed in utero with subsequent delivery by cesarean section near term. Cardiac catheterization was performed on these newborn lambs immediately after delivery, before and after surgical repair of the defect. Data from five of these lambs were compared to data obtained from seven normal lambs. Pulmonary hypertension was found only in lambs with hernias. Pulmonary artery pressures and the mean ratio of pulmonary to systemic resistance were higher in experimental lambs. Oxygen saturation and average cardiac index were higher in normals. Lambs in the experimental group, but not in the control group, had large left-to-right shunts at the level of the ductus arteriosus in the early neonatal period. Arterial oxygen saturations were consistently low with no differences in pre- and post-ductal samples, which suggests right-to-left shunting at the atrial level or physiologic shunting across the unexpanded lungs. No further expansion of the hypoplastic lungs occurred following decompression by surgical hernia repair, but transient hemodynamic improvement was noted in some cases. Surgical ligation of the ductus arteriosus did not significantly alter the clinical condition of the lambs. Lungs in lambs with hernias were grossly abnormal, the left appearing more hypoplastic than the right."

CD011912,0,10731869,0,Balloon dilatation angioplasty of stenosed systemic-pulmonary artery shunts.,"Seven children and an adult patient with cyanotic congenital heart defects underwent balloon dilatation angioplasty (BDA) of a stenosed systemic-pulmonary artery shunt to improve arterial oxygen saturation. We attempted to perform BDA using the transvenous route in all patients in whom the aorta connected with the right ventricle, such as in tetralogy of Fallot or double outlet right ventricle, in an effort to avoid femoral artery injury. We could use the transvenous route (antegrade) in three children with tetralogy of Fallot and in one child with tetralogy of Fallot and pulmonary atresia (one of them was 6.6 kg). Following BDA, there was an increase in arterial oxygen saturation from a mean of 65.9 +/- 12.8% to a mean of 78.1 +/- 8.3% (p < 0.05). On follow-up three to 37 months (mean 16.5 +/- 11.2 months) after BDA, the condition of all patients had improved. Pulmonary hypertension developed in one patient during the follow-up period. It is concluded that BDA of stenosed systemic-pulmonary artery shunts is reasonable, effective and safe. Use of the transvenous route, if possible, to perform balloon dilatation angioplasty facilitates the safe advancement of the larger balloons in low-weight children."

CD011912,0,951140,0,Effects of acutely increasing systemic vascular resistance on oxygen tension in tetralogy of Fallot.,"Effects of phenylephrine hydrochloride on the degree of hypoxia were studied in six cyanotic patients with tetralogy of Fallot. Baseline aortic and right atrial oxygen saturations, blood gas tensions, pH, and indicator-dilution curves were obtained under stable conditions. Phenylephrine was infused while systemic arterial pressure was monitored continuously. Aortic and right atrial blood samples were measured at each 10 mm Hg systolic pressure increment and decrement and analyzed for pH, PO2, PCO2, and oxygen saturation. A 40 mm Hg peak systolic aortic pressure rise was the arbitrary end point for phenylephrine infusion and the indicator-dilution curve repeated. Aortic oxygen tensions rose in all from 4 to 28 mm Hg (mean, 14 mm Hg). The net right-to-left shunt decreased from 10% to 40% (mean, 25%) with phenylephrine infusion as compared to the shunt under basal conditions. The presumed mechanism related to the increase in systemic vascular resistance relative to right ventricular outflow obstruction with resultant augmentation of pulmonary blood flow. It is concluded that acutely raising systemic vascular resistance in patients with tetralogy of Fallot using phenylephrine infusion has a beneficial effect on systemic arterial oxygen level and might be the medical treatment of choice for protracted hypoxic spells."

CD011912,0,3411763,0,Factors affecting biventricular function following surgical repair of tetralogy of Fallot.,"Right and left ventricular functions were assessed in children following surgical repair of tetralogy of Fallot. The results were analyzed with regard to the relative contribution of preoperative, perioperative and postoperative factors to postoperative functional abnormalities. Pulmonary regurgination of our Grade 3 or more depressed right and left ventricular ejection fractions and enlarged right ventricular end-diastolic volume. Right and left ventricular ejection fractions in patients with residual right ventricular outflow pressure gradients over 30 mmHg were significantly lower than those in patients with pressure gradients of 30 mmHg or less. The majority of those pressure gradients were at the pulmonary annulus or central pulmonary artery. Right and left ventricular ejection fractions were significantly lower in patients with a preoperative aortic oxygen saturation of less than 80% than in patients with one of 80% or more. The 3 variables of pulmonary regurgitation, residual pulmonary stenosis, preoperative aortic oxygen saturation were statistically independent. Left ventricular ejection fraction and end-diastolic volume correlated with the right ventricular ejection fraction and end-diastolic volume, respectively (r = 0.63, r = 0.68). These results show that severe pulmonary regurgitation, significant annular or central pulmonary stenosis and preoperative hypoxia are major contributing factors to right ventricular dysfunction after surgical repair of tetralogy of Fallot. The postoperative left ventricular dysfunction can be largely attributed to dysfunction of the right ventricle."

CD011912,0,20886209,0,Do predictors exist for a successful withdrawal of preoperative prostaglandin E(1) from neonates with d-transposition of the great arteries and intact ventricular septum?,"Prostaglandin E(1) (PGE(1)) is given to neonates with d-transposition of the great arteries (d-TGA) to reduce cyanosis by reopening and maintaining the patency of the ductus arteriosus. To avoid side effects, this medication can be stopped for hemodynamically stable patients after balloon atrial septostomy (BAS). A consecutive series of neonates with d-TGA and an intact ventricular septum (IVS) presenting from 2000 through 2005 was analyzed retrospectively to search for side effects of PGE(1) and to identify predictors for a safe preoperative withdrawal. The medication was stopped for hemodynamically stable patients with transcutaneous oxygen saturations higher than 80% after BAS and reinitiated for patients with an oxygen saturation lower than 65%. Patients successfully weaned were compared with those who had failed weaning in terms of atrial septal defect (ASD) size, ductus arteriosus size, and the transcutaneous oxygen saturation. Prostaglandin E(1) was initiated for all 43 neonates with d-TGA. The median maintenance dose of PGE(1) was 0.00625 μg/kg/min (range, 0.00313-0.050 μg/kg/min) for a median duration of 6 days (range, 1-12 days). For 16 patients, PGE(1) was preoperatively withdrawn but then had to be reinitiated for 7 of the 16 patients. No predictors for a successful weaning of PGE(1) were found based on ASD size, ductus arteriosus size, or oxygen saturation. The adverse effects of PGE(1) were apnea in 10 patients and fever in 19 patients. Neither seizures nor necrotizing enterocolitis was documented. Prostaglandin E(1) was successfully withdrawn for a minority of hemodynamically stable patients with d-TGA. No predictors for a successful weaning could be identified. Because apnea and fever are common side effects, withdrawal of PGE(1) after BAS may improve patient safety and comfort. In this patient group, if PGE(1) withdrawal was not well tolerated, it could be safely reinitiated. There were no serious side effects of PGE(1.)."

The study group consisted of 18 children with cyanotic congenital heart disease (CHD) and 20 age-adjusted children with acyanotic CHD as controls. Serum VEGF and leptin levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The mean VEGF level was 149.25+/-42.93 pg/ml (range 80.66-217.00) in the cyanotic group and 88.18+/-20.94 pg/ml (range 48.44-112.71) in the acyanotic group (p<0.001). The mean leptin level was 7.55+/-1.46 ng/ml (range 4.08-10.25) in the cyanotic group and 6.89+/-1.43 ng/ml (range 2.67-8.57) in the acyanotic group (p=0.168). There was a significant positive correlation (r=0.723, p<0.001) between VEGF and leptin levels in the cyanotic group while there was no correlation (r=0.235, p=0.348) in the acyanotic group. Arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) was negatively correlated (r=-0.625, p<0.001) with VEGF, but not correlated with leptin (r=-0.207, p=0.211) in the cyanotic group. There was no correlation between VEGF, leptin and SaO2 in the acyanotic group. We conclude that it is likely that both VEGF and leptin have a role in the pathogenesis of angiogenesis in cyanotic CHD."

CD011912,0,2613373,0,Effect of hypoxaemia on enzymes supplying myocardial energy in children with congenital heart disease.,"The differences in energy metabolism of the myocardium in children with congenital cardiac malformations producing hypoxaemia (arterial oxygen saturation 77 +/- 2%) or normoxaemia (arterial oxygen saturation 94 +/- 2%) were analysed by measuring the activity of the representative energy-supplying enzymes. Right atrial and ventricular tissue samples were obtained during surgical interventions. We demonstrated that myocardial metabolism was significantly influenced by hypoxaemia: the aerobic capacity of the energetic metabolism was reduced both in the atriums and ventricles. Atrial myocardium was more affected: in addition to citrate synthase, the activity of enzymes connected with lactate uptake and carbohydrate catabolism was also significantly decreased. These results demonstrate that the human heart is able to adapt to hypoxaemia by changing its energetic metabolism."

CD011912,0,1561008,0,Alterations in postnatal intestinal function during chronic hypoxemia.,"Growth failure is a major complication of chronic hypoxemia, as seen in infants and children with cyanotic congenital heart disease. To determine whether chronic hypoxemia during infancy affects the gastrointestinal tract, we examined small intestinal growth and digestive enzyme activities in chronically hypoxemic newborn lambs and in age-matched controls. Chronic hypoxemia was produced by placing an inflatable occluder around the main pulmonary artery and performing a balloon atrial septostomy. Aortic oxygen saturation was reduced to 60-74% for 2 wk, after which the small intestine was removed for analysis. During chronic hypoxemia, somatic growth rate was decreased to 60% of control (hypoxemic, 135 +/- 20 versus control, 216 +/- 26 g/d, p less than 0.02). No differences in caloric intake were found (hypoxemic, 129 +/- 4 versus control, 128 +/- 4 kcal/kg/d). Chronic hypoxemia did not alter small intestinal growth, as measured by jejuno-ileal weight, jejuno-ileal length, mucosal weight, or mucosal protein or DNA contents. However, sp act of lactase, the principal disaccharidase of the infant lamb intestine, were significantly decreased (hypoxemic, 0.08 +/- 0.01 versus control, 0.146 +/- 0.03 units of enzyme activity/mg DNA, p less than 0.05), as were the total small intestinal contents of lactase (hypoxemic, 61.7 +/- 7.0 versus control, 120.6 +/- 21.7 units of enzyme activity, p less than 0.01). There also were decreases in specific and total activities of other digestive enzymes such as maltase, amino-oligopeptidase, and alkaline phosphatase in hypoxemic intestine that did not achieve statistical significance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

CD011912,0,23534437,0,Stenting of the right ventricular outflow tract in symptomatic neonatal tetralogy of Fallot.,"There is ongoing debate regarding the initial management of symptomatic neonates with tetralogy of Fallot. Although neonatal repair can be performed with low mortality, it is associated with increased morbidity and long-term impact on right ventricular performance. Traditionally, the modified Blalock-Taussig shunt remains the palliative procedure of choice. Differential pulmonary artery flow may occur and subsequently result in underdevelopment and distortion of pulmonary vessels. Transcatheter therapy was previously limited to balloon valvulotomy when the obstruction is predominantly at the pulmonary valve level. Stenting of the right ventricular outflow tract can enable adequate forward flow; however, pulmonary regurgitation may impact on right ventricular performance and cardiac output. Stenting of the right ventricular outflow tract with valve sparing placement of the stent thus treating the underlying pathophysiology of the hypercyanotic spells provides a safe and effective management strategy, improving arterial oxygen saturation, avoiding pulmonary regurgitation and encouraging pulmonary artery growth."

CD011912,0,11501491,0,Angiogenic growth factors in patients with cyanotic congenital heart disease and in normal children.,"Previous studies have demonstrated that the expression of angiogenic growth factors is induced in hypoxic models. However, little is known about these factors in patients with cyanotic heart disease. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between the plasma level of angiogenic growth factors and the severity of cyanosis. The study included 85 patients with cyanotic heart disease and age matched 81 controls. Median age was 4.2 years in the cyanotic group and 4.8 years in the control group. Mean systemic oxygen saturation was 80.6 +/- 7.3% in the cyanotic group and 98.1 +/- 0.5% in the control group. In the control group, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the neonatal period was significantly elevated, then rapidly decreased within 3 months after birth. After 3 months of age, VEGF levels remained at a plateau. In contrast, this age dependency did not occur in hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) levels. Although VEGF and HGF levels were not different between the cyanotic and control groups within 3 months after birth, the VEGF level in the cyanotic group after 3 months of age was significantly elevated compared to the levels measured in the control group (149.2 +/- 105.6 vs. 66.3 +/- 22.5 pg/ml, p < 0.0001). Moreover, the VEGF level was negatively correlated with oxygen saturation (y = 440.6-3.53x, R = 0.47, p < 0.0001) in cases more than 3 months old. In contrast, no correlation was found between HGF level and oxygen saturation. Although physiologically increased VEGF in the neonatal period was rapidly decreased under normal oxygen saturation, a higher VEGF level persisted if systemic hypoxia was present. Persistently higher VEGF level may be related to the development of systemic to pulmonary collateral arteries in patients with cyanotic heart disease."

Asymptomatic newborns were screened for CHD using pulse oximetry and clinical examination before their discharge from the nursery. Oxygen saturation > or =94% was considered normal. Echocardiography was done for newborns with abnormal readings and for those with significant murmurs. Data concerning undetected cases were collected from the pediatric referral hospital. A total of 5211 cases were screened. Echocardiographic evaluations were done based on low pulse oximetry in five cases and on murmur detection in ten others. The sensitivity of the combined method of screening was 77%, whereas it was 31% for oximetry alone and 46% for clinical examination alone. Specificity was approximately 100% for all methods. The positive predictive value of the combined tool was 66.7%. We conclude that combining pulse oximetry and clinical examination can enhance the clinician's ability to detect life-threatening CHD in a timely manner. This screening method should become a part of the discharge plan for every newborn."

Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) can detect changes in regional cerebral saturation index (rSO2i) during cardiac surgery. If rSO2i decreases significantly, treatment algorithms are used to restore baseline values, potentially avoiding neurological complications. The efficacy of bilateral NIRS monitoring in pediatric congenital heart surgery has been debated.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the medicament Prostaglandin, first time administrated to neonatal cardiac patients, in Bosnia and Hercegovina. During December 1997 till June 2000. at the Neonatal department of Pediatric Clinic in Sarajevo 1162 pts were admitted, of which 17 (1.4%) with congenital heart disease have received prostaglandin therapy, with the mean age of 4.5 days (45 minutes till 20 days). 13/17 (76.5%) pts were boys and 4/17 (23.5%) girls, with mean body weight of 3.125 gr (range: 1.250 g to 4.100 g), mean gestational age 40 weeks (range 34 to 42). The patients were admitted for: cyanosis, breathing difficulties or fatigue. Central cyanosis was evident at admission in 15/17 pts, whose oxygen saturation at admission was from 21% up to 76%. The diagnosis of congenital cyanotic heart anomalies was made in 15/17 pts (88%) by clinical examination, X ray, ECG and ultrasound examination and acyanotic duct dependent on 2/17 (12%) pts. The administration of prostaglandin's was necessary and of vital importance for life maintenance of these pts till the surgical correction of these congenital heart anomalies. Prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) was administrated by infusion pump with the mean doses of maintenance: 0.023 mcg/kg/min in 11/17 (65%), and Prostaglandin E2 PGE2 in 6 (35%) pts, maintenance doses of 0.38 mcg/kg/hour. The duration of the prostaglandin application was from 7 hrs up to 30 days, mean 12 days. Five (29.5%) pts were intubatued during the application of this medicament. The side effects of this therapy were present in 13 pts (76.4%): hyperpyrexis in 8, apnea in 2 and apnea + hyperpyrexis in 3 pts. 8/17 (47%) pts were operated and corrected abroad, they are now in good condition, and 9/17 (53%) pts died. The death causes were a part of complex congenital heart disease: impossibility of performing the heart surgery in the country when needed, impossibility of pts evacuation to the foreign cardiosurgical center on time, sepsis or persistent pulmonary hypertension."

The main effects upon hemodynamics were an increase of pulmonary blood flow and a decrease of systemic blood flow. At the same time systemic blood pressure decreased slightly and a rise in systemic vascular resistance was calculated. An aortogram before and 15--20 minutes after the infusion of Pg-E1 was started, demonstrated a marked increase of the pulmonary blood flow and a dilation of the ductus arteriosus. Together with these hemodynamic effects the arterial and central venous oxygen saturation rose. In one infant with severe Tetralogy of Fallot, the ductus had already closed and could not be reopened by PgE1. In this infant PG-E1-Infusion had no effect upon arterial oxygen saturation. From these observations it can be concluded that dilation of the ductus is responsible for the rise in arterial oxygen saturation. 3the different indications for therapy with PG-E1 in the neonate are discussed."

CD011912,0,2624783,0,Is cerebral blood flow/metabolic mismatch during rewarming a risk factor after profound hypothermic procedures in small children?,"The relation between cerebral blood flow and oxygen consumption was studied in six children during cardiac operations with profound hypothermia. A combination of topical cooling and core cooling was used to reduce the nasopharyngeal temperature to 15 degrees C. The alpha-stat principle for pH management was used. Blood flow and oxygen consumption decreased significantly with temperature. At a nasopharyngeal temperature of 15 degrees C, blood flow was reduced to 25% of the awake level, corresponding to 34% of the asleep value obtained 15-30 min after intubation. Oxygen consumption decreased to 25% of the asleep value. During stable profound hypothermia, venous saturation in the jugular bulb was at the same level as 15 min after intubation (70%). Markedly lower values were observed during topical cooling, and particularly during rewarming (down to 21%), indicating a mismatch between cerebral blood flow and oxygen consumption. The speed of rewarming correlated with the fall in venous oxygen saturation (rs = 0.82, P less than 0.05). It is suggested that periods of cerebral blood flow/metabolic mismatch during topical cooling and rewarming may explain postoperative cerebral dysfunction after deep hypothermic procedures. A moderate speed of rewarming is advocated."

This was a retrospective chart review. The setting was a pediatric cardiac intensive care unit at a tertiary care children's hospital. Fifty-nine patients <1 year of age with single-ventricle physiology who received a blood transfusion between December 2007 and April 2009 were analyzed. They received a total of 183 transfusions. Exclusion criteria included transfusions given within 72 h of cardiac surgery or transfusions given to patients with active bleeding. There were no interventions. The study population was divided into terciles based on pretransfusion hemoglobin (Hgb) concentration. The pretransfusion Hgb concentration in group A was 7.8 to 12.3 gm/dl, in group B was 12.4 to 13.2 gm/dl, and in group C was 13.3 to 15.7 gm/dl. Heart rate, blood pressure, arterial saturation, and cerebral near-infrared spectroscopy (cNIRS) values before transfusion, as well as at 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 h after transfusion, were collected. There was significant improvement in diastolic blood pressure, arterial saturation, and cNIRS in group A after 12 h. Transfusions given in group B also resulted in improvement in diastolic blood pressure and arterial saturation, with less robust response of cNIRS. In group C, only arterial saturation values increased significantly. RBC transfusions can improve hemodynamics and markers of oxygen delivery in infants with single-ventricle physiology, but further studies are needed to determine an optimal Hgb level in this population. Interventions to increase Hgb above this level may be of limited benefit."

We assessed hemoglobin levels, aortic oxygen saturation, iron stores, red cell 2,3-DPG, oxygen consumption, and systemic O2 transport in 19 hypoxemic patients, aged 3 months to 8 years. Low erythropoietin titers (less than 30 mU/dl) were found in 14 patients. Patients with high erythropoietin titers had lower Pao2 (36 +/- 7 vs 49 +/- 7 mm Hg, p less than 0.01), lower aortic saturation (68 +/- 12 vs 81 +/- 9%, p less than 0.01), and higher red cell 2,3-DPG (2.47 +/- 0.34 vs 3.23 +/- 0.73 mumol/ml, p less than 0.01). Aortic oxygen saturation higher than 80% was associated with a low erythropoietin titer and a hemoglobin level below that associated with hyperviscosity. The relationship between aortic oxygen saturation and hemoglobin concentration was strong (r = 0.77). These data suggest that for children less than 8 years of age, adequate compensation for moderate hypoxemia can occur with moderate increases in hemoglobin levels."

In 19 patients, postoperative studies were done electively and, in 6 patients, they were required to investigate symptoms of heart failure, these symptoms were temporary in 4 patients and progressive in 2. Both of the latter had pulmonary venous obstruction which was later relieved successfully by reoperation. After operation, systemic arterial oxygen saturation and blood pressure increased and polycythemia disappeared in every patient. However, several complications-some of them unsuspected clinically-were identified by cardiac catheterization: (a) patch detachment in 5 patients; (b) obstruction of superior vena caval return in 10 patients; (c) obstruction of inferior vena return in 1 patient; and (d) pulmonary venous obstruction in 2 patients. The incidence of pulmonary or systemic venous obstruction was higher in patients who had a Dacron intraatrial baffle (8 of 19 patients). Comparison of 21 sets of preoperative and postoperative right ventricular angiograms demonstrated an increase in right ventricular trabeculations in each patient, poorer right ventricular contractility in 12 patients, and development of tricuspid insufficiency in nine patients. None of the patients with poor right ventricular contractility had had surgical ventriculotomy. Although Mustard operation for transposition of the great arteries is effective in relieving cyanosis, it may be followed by obstruction to systemic or pulmonary venous return, intraatrial patch detachment, tricuspid insufficiency and angiocardiographic evidences of poor right ventricular contractility."
CD011912,0,81528,0,Pharmacologic dilatation of the ductus arteriosus with prostaglandin E1 in infants with congenital heart disease.,"Prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) has been used for successful palliation in nine infants with congenital heart disease. Seven patients had pulmonary atresia with ductal-dependent pulmonary blood flow. In this group, systemic O2 saturation increased from a mean value of 45% to 79% after infusion of PGE1, and surgical palliation was successfully done with the infants in stable condition, without hypoxemia or acidemia. An additional patient with coarctation of the aorta had marked ductal dilatation after PGE1 infusion as indicated by umbilical artery pulse pressure. The coarctation was repaired, with the infant in stable condition. The final patient had neonatal tricuspid insufficiency with right to left atrial shunting. Systemic O2 saturation was improved after PGE1 infusion, though the ductus was closed. The improved oxygenation was believed to be due to a reduction in pulmonary vascular resistance by PGE1. Prostaglandin E1 provides a powerful new tool for palliation of critical congenital heart disease in infants whose ductal constriction can markedly influence their clinical status."

CD011912,0,6161280,0,Syndrome of single ventricle without pulmonary stenosis but with left atrioventricular valve atresia and interatrial obstruction. Palliative management with simultaneous atrial septostomy and pulmonary artery banding.,"Case histories of four infants with single ventricle and left atrioventricular (AV) valve atresia, with interatrial obstruction but without pulmonic stenosis, are presented. Relief of interatrial obstruction by surgical or balloon atrial septostomy resulted in a marked fall in the left atrial pressure and the pulmonary artery mean pressure and resistance as well as a marked increase in the left-to-right interatrial shunt, pulmonary blood flow, and systemic arterial oxygen saturation. Because of this predictable fall in pulmonary vascular resistance, concomitant pulmonary artery banding was performed in each case with good results. There are only a few previously reported cases of single ventricle with left AV valve atresia. Interatrial obstruction is quite common in this lesion. The concept that relief of interatrial obstruction produces a rapid and predictable fall in the pulmonary vascular resistance and that concomitant pulmonary artery banding is necessary in these infants with complex congenital heart disease is emphasized."

Although surgical palliation in infants with this syndrome is widely agreed on in practice, variation occurs in both surgical and medical management. Perinatal factors that affect preoperative management include the subtype of the syndrome and the patient's birth weight, gestational age, and genetic abnormalities. The general aspects of perioperative stabilization and management are monitoring, use of vasoactive infusions, ventilatory support, and nutrition. Management strategies for balancing single-ventricle physiology are aimed at addressing the 3 major causes of desaturation: diminished pulmonary blood flow, low mixed venous oxygen saturation, and pulmonary venous desaturation."

CD011912,0,11370437,0,Chloralhydrate in children undergoing echocardiography.,"Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is a painless, noninvasive and risk-free diagnostic method in children with known or suspected congenital heart disease. Sedation is frequently required for an optimal achievement of this procedure. The purpose of this study was to determine the safety and efficacy of chloral hydrate (CH) sedation in undergoing TTE. The study population included 360 patients with a median age of 19 months. (2 weeks to 8 years). The median dosage of CH given was 75 mg/kg (ranging 50 and 100 mg), with either oral or rectal administration. Oral administration could not be achieved successfully in 90 patients (20%) because of the bitter taste of the drug, in the other 108 patients (30%), vomiting occurred immediately after drug administration. Prior to CH administration and until discharge; respiratory rate; heart rate, blood pressure and oxygen saturation were recorded. Sedation was successfully achieved in 342 (95%) of the patients. No child had a clinically significant change in heart rate, blood pressure and respiratory rate during sedation. There were also no significant differences in heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure and oxygen saturation before and after sedation. Although CH has a bitter taste and is a gastric irritant for oral medication, because of the minimal side effects and efficacy for sedation, it remains as a safe and successful drug for use in children for TTE."

CD011912,0,22447384,0,Short-term result of ductus arteriosus stent implantation compared with surgically created shunts.,"This report aims to compare the researchers' early experience with the safety, efficacy, short-term outcomes, and complications of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) stents in neonates having duct-dependent pulmonary circulation with those of surgically created shunts. Between April 2009 and April 2011, 18 infants with duct-dependent pulmonary circulation underwent cardiac catheterization for PDA stenting as the first palliative procedure in a referral center. For comparison, 20 infants who underwent surgical aortopulmonary shunt placement in another center were used. Follow-up assessment included clinical examination, echocardiography, oxygen saturation, and cardiac catheterization studies. Access and stenting for the PDA were successful in 15 patients (83.3 %). The mean procedure time was 58.43 ± 41.25 min, and the mean fluoroscopy time was 18.81 ± 5.64 min. Three patients (20 %) in the stented group and 6 patients (30 %) in the surgical group died (P = 0.09). After a 6-month follow-up period, none of the patients had significant stent stenosis requiring reintervention. The oxygen saturation increase did not differ significantly between the two groups either immediately after the procedure or 6 months later (P > 0.5). The left pulmonary artery diameter, McGoon ratio, and Nakata index did not differ significantly between the two groups (P > 0.05), but the right pulmonary diameter was larger in the stented group (5.01 ± 0.45 vs 4.1 ± 0.49 mm; P = 0.0001). Stenting for the PDA is an appropriate alternative to surgical shunt creation in many patients with duct-dependent circulation. In our sample, the two groups did not differ significantly in terms of outcome or mortality."
CD011912,0,10564307,0,Proposed entry criteria for postoperative cardiac extracorporeal membrane oxygenation after pediatric open heart surgery.,"While extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is being used increasingly after pediatric cardiac surgery, criteria are lacking for initiating ECMO after bypass weaning. To develop clinically useful ECMO entry criteria based on parameters readily available, children were examined at postoperative pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admission. Using hospital mortality as the primary outcome, univariate and multiple logistic regressions were performed to estimate the predictive value of clinical (age, weight, and diagnosis) and laboratory (arterial blood pressure, pH, lactate, creatine kinase, and arterial and central venous oxygen saturation [ScvO2]) variables. Data from 218 children over a 2 year period were analyzed retrospectively. Univariate regression demonstrated that age, weight, diagnosis, blood pressure, venous and arterial saturation, and lactate were significantly associated with postoperative mortality (p < 0.05). In multiple regression, ScvO2 and lactate level were found to be independent predictors and were used in a predictive model (ScvO2 odds ratio: 2.03-828.6, p = 0.016) (lactate odds ratio: 1.58 -4.20, p = 0.0002) (R2 = 0.70). Applying an 80% risk of mortality to establish entry criteria as in neonatal ECMO, PICU admission values of lactate > 70 mg/dl if ScvO2 < 60% or lactate >163 mg/dl if ScvO2 > 60% are proposed to serve as postoperative ECMO entry criteria if bypass weaning has been possible but is followed by low cardiac output."
CD011912,0,24705968,0,Volume guarantee ventilation during surgical closure of patent ductus arteriosus.,"Surgical closure of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is associated with adverse outcomes. Surgical exposure requires retraction of the lung, resulting in decreased aeration and compliance. Optimal respiratory support for PDA surgery is unknown. Experience with volume guarantee (VG) ventilation at our institution led us to hypothesize that surgery would be better tolerated with automatic adjustment of pressure by VG to maintain tidal volume (VT) during retraction."
CD011912,0,10564300,0,Intravenous prostacyclin mitigates inhaled nitric oxide rebound effect: A case control study.,"Although extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) improves oxygenation, pulmonary vascular resistance may be increased due to endothelial function impairment. Inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) is increasingly used for treatment of pulmonary hypertension after surgical repair of congenital heart defects, with or without ECMO. One of the main complications of its application is deterioration of oxygenation following withdrawal of iNO. To test whether intravenous prostacyclin applied prior to and during iNO withdrawal can mitigate this rebound effect, we conducted a retrospective case control study. The rebound effect was defined as a 5% decrease of oxygenation saturation within 4 h after iNO withdrawal. Twelve children suffering from pulmonary hypertension (2 after ECMO) and treated with iNO received 10 ng/kg/min prostacyclin intravenously 24 h prior to iNO withdrawal (Group 1). Twelve children treated with iNO (3 after ECMO) who received no prostacyclin prior to iNO withdrawal were matched as controls. The rebound effect occurred in 1 out of 12 children in Group 1 and in 8 out of 12 children in Group 2 (p = 0. 0039). We conclude that application of intravenous prostacyclin prior to and during iNO withdrawal may be able to mitigate the rebound effect."
CD011912,0,23809350,0,Global perfusion assessment and tissue oxygen saturation in preterm infants: where are we?,"Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) monitoring is a new challenge for clinicians who deal with early detection of dangerous hypoperfusion in the brain, as well as in splanchnic and renal districts in critically ill preterm infants. Previous studies performed on infants and children with congenital heart disease, demonstrated the efficacy of this non-invasive method in managing hypoperfusive states pre, post and during cardiac surgery. Its use has improved post surgery outcome. NIRS monitoring has been used also to assess therapeutic intervention utility. Early identification of silent hypoperfusion has made NIRS use in preterm infants very interesting for neonatologists, especially where other techniques have failed. In this work, literature on this topic has been carefully examined, particularly the ""two site NIRS"" use in preterm infants, to evaluate how regional splanchnic oxygen saturation changes, both in physiological events, such as enteral feeding and in hemodynamic disorders, that occur in patients with significant patent ductus and in hypoperfusive states that lead to necrotizing enterocolitis."
CD011912,0,11399341,0,Activation of circulating platelets and platelet response to activating agents in children with cyanotic congenital heart disease: their relevance to palliative systemic-pulmonary shunt.,"Abnormal platelet function has been hypothesised to play a role in the haemostatic abnormalities in cyanotic congenital heart disease (CCHD) patients. Using whole blood flow cytometry we found that platelets from cyanotic patients were hyperreactive and we related such hyperreactivity directly to young age, unoperated state, high haematocrit, reduced saturation with oxygen and low platelet count. Circulating platelets from CCHD children showed significantly enhanced P-selectin expression (P<0.004) and remained more reactive to 0.2 IU/ml thrombin, 1-8 microM TRAP and 2-4 microM ADP (P<0.04), especially in younger (0-3-year-olds) patients. Such a platelet 'priming' largely concerned CCHD children who were not subjected to modified Blalock-Taussig shunts in the past (non-MBTS). Only non-MBTS cyanotic children, but not MBTS-operated patients, showed significantly higher platelet reactivity compared to controls in response to ADP or 1 microM TRAP with respect to P-selectin expression (p<0.05) and in response to all examined agonists with respect to GPIb expression (P<0.045). The enhanced P-selection expression in MBTS-operated CCHD children and reduced GPIb expression in non-MBTS patients, especially in younger patients, were positively associated with the occurrence of the polymorphic variant Pl(A2) of platelet membrane glycoprotein IIIa gene. Altered blood morphology parameters (elevated RBC, Hb, Hct and MCHC, for all P<0.0005) in CCHD children correlated with the enhanced degranulation of circulating blood platelets and their hyperreactivity in response to some agonists (P<0.05). Overall, our data encourage the reasoning that circulating platelets are remarkably hyperreactive in non-MBTS cyanotic children, which are at higher risk to often encounter platelets activation in circulation. It seems unlikely that the apparently unchanged platelet reactivity in MBTS-operated children is due to the advantageous effects of the shunt, since these patients showed neither altered haematological parameters nor improved oxygen carrying capacity. Otherwise, it may rather result from more frequent episodes of platelet degranulation and preactivation in the past, and/or post-operative enhanced platelet consumption."
CD011912,0,11703965,0,Postoperative ectopic atrial tachycardia in children with congenital heart disease.,"The causes and significance of postoperative ectopic atrial tachycardia (EAT) remain unknown. To identify factors associated with postoperative EAT in children after cardiac surgery, we retrospectively studied pre-, intra-, and postoperative variables. The median age for postoperative EAT cases was younger than the general population admitted for cardiac surgical procedures (6 vs 17 months old, p = 0.09). Trends for EAT cases included lower preoperative oxygen saturation (84% vs 99%, p = 0.001), more pre- and postoperative inotropic support, and atrial septostomy (24% vs 6%, p = 0.08). EAT cases had longer cardiopulmonary bypass times and clamp times (115 vs 88 minutes, p = 0.08; 63 vs 46 minutes, p = 0.03, respectively) and had a prolonged intensive care unit stay (10 vs 3 days, p <0.001). Deaths were recorded in 2 of 17 EAT cases versus 0 of 36 randomly selected controls (p = 0.10). EAT resolved before discharge in 10 of 16 surviving patients. The etiology of EAT appears to be multifactorial, and may include disruption of atrial septum, longer pump times, need for inotropic support, and potassium depletion. Thus, young, ill, cyanotic patients were most at risk for postoperative EAT. Although EAT was associated with prolonged intensive care, it resolved in most cases over time."

CD011912,0,25764508,0,Combined Cerebral and Renal Near-Infrared Spectroscopy After Congenital Heart Surgery.,"The maintenance of an adequate oxygen supply to tissues after congenital heart surgery is essential for good outcomes. The objective of this study was to assess the usefulness of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) for estimating central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2) using both cerebral and renal measurements, explore its relation with cardiac output measurements and check its ability to detect low cardiac output. A prospective observational pilot study was conducted in patients weighing <10 kg undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass surgery. Spectroscopy probes were placed on the forehead and renal area, and serial cardiac output measurements were obtained by femoral transpulmonary thermodilution over the first 24 h after surgery. In the 15 patients studied, ScvO2 was correlated with cerebral (r = 0.58), renal (r = 0.60) and combined (r = 0.71) measurements. Likewise, the systolic index was correlated with the NIRS signals: cerebral (r = 0.60), renal (r = 0.50) and combined (r = 0.66). Statistically significant differences were found in the NIRS measures registered in the 29 low cardiac output events detected by thermodilution: cerebral: 62 % (59-65) versus 69 % (63-76); renal: 83 % (70-89) versus 89 % (83-95); and combined 64 % (60-69) versus 72 % (67-76). In our series, combined cerebral and renal monitoring was correlated with central venous oxygen saturation and cardiac output; low cardiac output detection associated a different spectroscopy pattern."

No report has described complete atrioventricular (AV) block detected in a neonate with CMD. We report a floppy infant of 31(+4) weeks gestation with complete AV block at birth, who was diagnosed with CMD by Southern analysis. She recovered from complete AV block 32 hr after temporary transcutaneous pacing was applied. To the best our knowledge, this is the first recorded case of a complete AV block accompanied by CMD during the neonatal period. When a newborn has a complete AV block, the physician should consider the possibility of the CMD and conduct a careful physical examination."

CD011912,0,1330359,0,Transcriptional regulation of left ventricular beta-adrenergic receptors during chronic hypoxia.,"beta-Adrenergic receptor downregulation is the end result of cellular adaptation to prolonged agonist exposure. The factors mediating receptor downregulation include receptor phosphorylation, receptor movement from the plasma membrane to intracellular sites, and alterations in nascent receptor synthesis. We have previously demonstrated a downregulation of the left ventricular beta-receptor during chronic hypoxia in vivo. To determine the mechanism of this downregulation, we produced chronic hypoxia in seven newborn lambs by creating right ventricular outflow obstruction and an atrial septal defect. Oxygen saturation was reduced to 65-74% for 2 weeks. Six lambs served as normoxic controls. Sarcolemmal membrane and cytosolic fractions were prepared from left ventricular free wall samples. beta-Receptor density in each fraction was determined with the radioligand [125I]iodocyanopindolol. Steady-state levels of beta-receptor mRNA were determined by Northern blot analysis using a beta 1-adrenergic receptor cDNA probe. During chronic hypoxia, left ventricular membrane beta-adrenergic receptor density decreased by 55% (153 +/- 28 fmol/mg for hypoxic lambs versus 342 +/- 79 fmol/mg for control lambs, p < 0.05). There was no corresponding increase in beta-receptor density in the cytosolic fraction (23 +/- 3 fmol/mg for hypoxic lambs versus 33 +/- 9 fmol/mg for control lambs, p = NS), nor was there a significant change in the ratio of beta 1-receptor/beta 2-receptor subtypes as assessed by radioligand binding (beta 1 subtype, 84.1 +/- 10.1% for hypoxic lambs versus 93.2 +/- 8.8% for control lambs; p = NS).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD011912,0,26982280,0,Effects of milk flow on the physiological and behavioural responses to feeding in an infant with hypoplastic left heart syndrome.,"Infants with hypoplastic left heart syndrome often experience difficulty with oral feeding, which contributes to growth failure, morbidity, and mortality. In response to feeding difficulty, clinicians often change the bottle nipple, and thus milk flow rate. Slow-flow nipples have been found to reduce the stress of feeding in other fragile infants, but no research has evaluated the responses of infants with hypoplastic left heart syndrome to alterations in milk flow. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the physiological and behavioural responses of an infant with hypoplastic left heart syndrome to bottle feeding with either a slow-flow (Dr. Brown's Preemie) or a standard-flow (Dr. Brown's Level 2) nipple. A single infant was studied for three feedings: two slow-flow and one standard-flow. Oral feeding, whether with a slow-flow or a standard-flow nipple, was distressing for this infant. During slow-flow feeding, she experienced more coughing events, whereas during standard-flow she experienced more gagging. Disengagement and compelling disorganisation were most common during feeding 3, that is slow-flow, which occurred 2 days after surgical placement of a gastrostomy tube. Clinically significant changes in heart rate, oxygen saturation, and respiratory rate were seen during all feedings. Heart rate was higher during standard-flow and respiratory rate was higher during slow-flow. Further research is needed to examine the responses of infants with hypoplastic left heart syndrome to oral feeding and to identify strategies that will support these fragile infants as they learn to feed. Future research should evaluate an even slower-flow nipple along with additional supportive feeding strategies."
CD011912,0,24037922,1,Smooth implementation of critical congenital heart defect screening in a newborn nursery.,"In January of 2012, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences began implementation of a critical congenital heart disease screening program to identify newborns with structural heart defects. The screening used motion tolerant pulse oximeters in direct sequence to measure the oxygen levels in the right hand and either foot of eligible newborns. Exclusion criteria included echocardiogram prior to discharge, age greater than 7 days with continuous neonatal intensive care unit monitoring, or death or transfer prior to discharge. Of the 1905 infants screened, 3 infants failed screening. Two of the infants had atrial septal defects, and 1 had a patent foramen ovale, which was considered a false positive. After planning and education, the implementation of critical congenital heart disease pulse oximetry screening was successful. With only 1 false positive in our high-risk population, this should encourage other institutions to begin screening eligible infants."

CD011912,0,3588451,0,Cardiac surgery for the adolescent with univentricular heart.,"Univentricular heart is a complex congenital anomaly with an extremely dismal prognosis. Left untreated the majority of patients will die in infancy. This poor outlook has prompted an aggressive surgical approach consisting of early palliation followed by eventual complete repair. The initial palliative efforts are aimed at providing adequate arterial oxygen saturation and normalizing pulmonary artery pressure. Infants with severe cyanosis due to diminished pulmonary blood flow are best treated with a systemic to pulmonary artery shunt. Those with excessive pulmonary flow and hypertension must be banded early to prevent pulmonary vascular occlusive disease. Most patients who are properly palliated will become acceptable candidates for an eventual corrective procedure. For the majority, this will be a direct atriopulmonary connection, known as the Fontan procedure. In this operation, systemic venous blood is routed directly to the pulmonary artery, excluding the ventricular mass. Although not corrective in the usual sense, this procedure provides normal arterial saturation without ventricular volume overload. A small group of patients with univentricular heart may best be treated by partitioning the ventricular chamber into 2 halves. Septation procedures, however, carry a high operative mortality and are likely to result in complete heart block. These surgical options, when properly selected and timed, have improved the outlook for many children with univentricular heart."
CD011912,0,10771985,0,Lower airway disease caused by respiratory syncytial virus.,"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common cause of lower respiratory tract disease in infants and young children. Most infections due to RSV are mild and do not require hospitalization. RSV causes both upper respiratory tract infections as well as lower respiratory tract infections. Infants with underlying disease states like bronchopulmonary dyslasia, congenital heart disease and prematurity appear more prone to develop severe infection and have a higher incidence of hospitalization. The exact pathogenesis of RSV is not well understood. The mortality associated with primary RSV infection in healthy children is estimated to be between .005% to .02%. In hospitalized children the mortality rate is estimated to be from 1% to 3%. Several treatment modalities in the form of bronchodilators, corticosteroids, ribavirin, intravenous immune gammaglobulin and antibiotics are available. Studies have failed to show the true beneficial effect of any of the above treatment modalities. Supportive care is only needed. The best treatment is the supportive care in the form of oxygen and fluids and close monitoring of the vital signs including oxygen saturation."

CD011912,0,7278334,0,"Appraisal of the Mustard procedure for the physiological correction of ""simple"" transposition of the great arteries. Eighty consecutive cases, 1970-1980.","Eighty successive patients underwent the Mustard operation for ""simple"" transposition of the great arteries (TGA) between January, 1970, and January, 1980. Ages ranged from 42 days to 12.4 years (mean 14.7 months). Balloon atrial septostomy (BAS) with balloon volumes of more than 2.5 ml produced significant increases of arterial oxygen saturation, although the initial benefit of BAS was greater than that found at follow-up catheterization. In these patients the left ventricular (LV) pressure tended to decrease during the first months of life, but this drop was less marked at the end of the first year. Deep hypothermia and cardiocirculatory arrest were employed in all cases. Several modifications were adapted to the original surgical technique in order to reduce last sequelae. There were two early and three late deaths. At follow-up (mean 4.5 years) 74% of patients were symptom free. Sinoatrial and atrioventricular (AV) conduction disturbances were present in five and six patients, respectively. Caval or pulmonary venous obstruction occurred in 13 patients, seven of whom required reoperation. Isolated tricuspid valve incompetence was present in one patient only, but in four it was associated with other defects. Primary right ventricular (RV) failure occurred in one patient. These findings, in relation to mortality, complications, and the excellent clinical results in the majority of survivors, compare favorably with results published for patients with ""simple"" TGA who have been subjected to other types of physiological or anatomic correction. At the present time, there seems to be no good reason to alter our surgical policy in this group of patients."

Oximetric determination of the left-to-right shunt was used as a reference. The result was expressed as shunt flow divided by pulmonary blood flow (Qshunt/Qp). The regression equation then obtained was Qshunt/Qp by thermodilution = 0.05 + 0.87 x Qshunt/Qp by oximetry. The residual standard deviation around the line of regression was 0.03. The thermodilution technique can be used for rapid assessment of the presence and magnitude of left-to-right shunting, provided that there is opportunity for the indicator to mix adequately in the main blood stream before shunting occurs."

CD011912,0,6760141,0,Quantitative radionuclide angiocardiography for left-to-right cardiac shunts in children.,"Pulmonary to systemic flow ratios (Qp/Qs) were estimated by quantitative radionuclide angiocardiography (QRAC) in 135 children. The Qp/Qs ratios were derived from pulmonary time/activity curves using a gamma variate model. Eighty-five of these children also had Qp/Qs ratios estimated by oximetry at cardiac catheterization. Left-to-right shunts with a Qp/Qs range of 1.2 to 3.0 were detected and quantitated by radionuclide angiography with an accuracy similar to that for oximetry. The correlation between Qp/Qs, determined by QRAC and by oximetry was good (r = .93; SEE .31). This relatively noninvasive technique has now been used to estimate the Qp/Qs ratio in 34 children with a clinically suspected left-to-right shunt, and postoperatively in 16 cases with residual murmurs; it has obviated the need for catheterization in many of these patients. The technique may also be used serially to determine changes in the Qp/Qs ratio in patients with known left-to-right shunts."

CD011912,0,21085945,0,Low renal oximetry correlates with acute kidney injury after infant cardiac surgery.,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a frequent complication after cardiopulmonary bypass surgery during infancy. Standard methods for evaluating renal function are not particularly sensitive nor are proximate indicators of renal dysfunction that allow intervention in real time. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a newer noninvasive technology that continuously evaluates regional oximetry and may correlate with renal injury and adverse outcomes after cardiac surgery in infants. This prospective observational study enrolled 40 infants (age, <12 months) undergoing biventricular repair. Continuous renal oximetry data were collected for the first 48 postoperative hours and correlated with postoperative course, standard laboratory data, and the occurrence of acute renal injury. Subjects with low renal oximetry (below 50% for >2 h) had significantly higher postoperative peak creatinine levels by 48 h (0.8 ± 0.4 vs. 0.52 ± 0.2; p = 0.003) and a higher incidence of AKI (50 vs. 3.1%; p = 0.003) than those with normal renal oximetry. These subjects also required more ventilator days and greater vasoactive support, and they had elevated lactate levels. Prolonged low renal near-infrared oximetry appears to correlate with renal dysfunction, decreased systemic oxygen delivery, and the overall postoperative course in infants with congenital heart disease undergoing biventricular repair."
CD011912,0,3501227,0,Is oxygen supply the only regulator of erythropoietin levels? Serum immunoreactive erythropoietin during the first 4 months of life in term infants with different levels of arterial oxygenation.,"Serum immunoreactive erythropoietin (siEp) levels were measured in 35 full-term infants aged 0-13 weeks, 31 of whom had congenital heart disease. The infants displayed a wide range in arterial oxygen tension (PaO2) and oxygen saturation (SaO2). During the first days of life siEp varied widely with a range from less than 3 to more than 10,000 mIU/ml. The wide variation is consistent with findings in cord blood at term. The siEp levels did not correlate significantly with haemoglobin, haematocrit, PaO2, SaO2, or arterial oxygen content in the total sample, nor when the cohort was split up into different age groups. Cyanotic infants aged 2-13 weeks had significantly higher siEp concentrations than normal adults (p less than 0.001) and than children with cyanotic congenital heart disease, aged 4 months-10 years (p less than 0.001). The raised siEp levels in cyanotic children aged 2-13 weeks found in this study and the normal levels found in their older counterparts (4 months-10 years) (reported elsewhere) are consistent with the pattern observed in man and animals exposed to prolonged hypobaric hypoxia, in which after an initial rise in erythropoietin concentrations the levels fall to normal while increased erythropoiesis is sustained."
CD011912,0,17906480,0,Patent ductus arteriosus 'stenting' as a life-saving approach in severe neonatal Ebstein's anomaly.,"A critical 1-day-old male neonate was referred to cardiac evaluation because of deep cyanosis due to a severe tricuspid valve Ebstein's anomaly with large atrial right-to-left shunt and duct-dependent pulmonary circulation. Ductus arteriosus re-opening by prostaglandin infusion resulted in significant clinical improvement but, after a few hours, it irreversibly closed, and pulmonary vasodilator treatment with inhaled nitric oxide and oral sildenafil did not significantly increase the oxygen saturation. Therefore, it was decided to proceed to ductal recanalization and stenting as an alternative to the surgical shunt. After the procedure, oxygen saturation was raised to over 90%, allowing the baby to be weaned from mechanical ventilation. At 9-month follow-up, he was asymptomatic and showed a systemic saturation over 90% despite complete closure of the stented ductus. In conclusion, ductus arteriosus stenting might be considered to be a reliable and life-saving therapeutic option in severe forms of Ebstein's anomaly as a temporary support to a multidrug vasoactive therapy."

CD011912,0,21774842,0,Serum and pulmonary vascular endothelial growth factor/receptors and haemodynamic measurements in cyanotic congenital heart disease with decreased pulmonary blood flow.,"Tetralogy of Fallot is the most common cyanotic congenital heart disease with decreased pulmonary blood flow. Right-to-left shunt and infundibular pulmonary stenosis in this disease lead to a decrease in arterial O(2) saturation. Hypoxia is a strong stimulus for angiogenesis; however, the reason for insufficiency in the pulmonary vascular growth in patients despite chronic arterial hypoxia is still not known. This study was planned considering that the impairment in vascular endothelial growth factor-receptor relationship or the vascular endothelial growth factor-receptor deficiency in the pulmonary vascular bed during development may cause insufficiency of pulmonary vascular growth. A total of 24 patients were grouped as cyanotic - including 13 patients with tetralogy of Fallot - and acyanotic - including 11 patients with left-to-right shunt lesions. During cardiac catheterisation, vascular endothelial growth factor measurements were performed; and oxygen saturations, pressures, and haemoglobin levels were measured. Perioperative lung biopsy for vascular endothelial growth factor receptors was performed in the cyanotic group. Vascular endothelial growth factor of the aorta was higher in the acyanotic group. There was a significant negative correlation between vascular endothelial growth factor levels and aortic O(2) saturation in the cyanotic group (p < 0.05). Vascular endothelial growth factor tissue staining was negative in 11 out of 13 (84.6%) patients. KDR/Flk-1 receptor was positive in four out of 13 (30.7%) patients; Flt-1 receptor was positive in six out of 13 (46.1%) patients. Vascular endothelial growth factor values were found to be lower than those of the acyanotic patients in this study. Low serum vascular endothelial growth factor levels of the cyanotic group, in spite of the hypoxia, demonstrated the importance of studying vascular endothelial growth factor tissue levels and vascular endothelial growth factor receptors in these patients."

CD011912,0,6266692,0,Radionuclide quantitation of right-to-left intracardiac shunts in children.,"A simple, noninvasive method for measurement of right-to-left intracardiac shunts would enhance the management of patients with congenital heart disease. This study describes application of data processing techniques used previously in dye-indicator curves to data recorded during the initial transit of radioactive bolus through the central circulation. Radionuclide angiocardiograms were performed in 20 children, mean age 30 months, immediately after cardiac catheterization for congenital heart disease. The radionuclide data recorded over the carotid artery were used to replace arterial sampling required for dye indicators, and forward triangles were fitted to calculate the right-to-left shunt in an approach similar to that of Wood for indicator-dilution curves. Ten of the children had right-to-left shunts by Fick and radionuclide measurement, and 10 of the children with septal defects had no right-to-left shunt by either technique. Both the radionuclide and Fick measurements correlated well (r = 0.95). Therefore, radionuclide angiocardiographic data may be used for accurate calculation of right-to-left shunts in small children, eliminating the need for arterial sampling."

CD011912,0,7881366,0,Apparent cerebral cytochrome aa3 reduction during cardiopulmonary bypass in hypoxaemic children with congenital heart disease. A critical analysis of in vivo near-infrared spectrophotometric data.,"The purpose of this analysis was critically to examine the changes of cerebral cytochrome oxidase as detected by near-infrared spectrophotometry (NIRS) during induction of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) in fourteen children undergoing open heart surgery. Five children were hypoxaemic (arterial oxygen saturation 49%-84%) before the switch to CPB and nine children were not. In the hypoxaemic children, the total cerebral hemoglobin concentration [tHb] decreased rapidly and markedly, reaching a plateau after 2 min. Surprisingly, cytochrome aa3 concentration in its oxygenated form [CytO2] decreased in parallel while the cerebral haemoglobin oxygenation index [HbO2]-[Hb] increased gradually. In the eight normoxaemic children, changes in the NIRS signals were insignificant. When a standard NIRS algorithm was used, the magnitude of the change in [CytO2] was closely associated with the magnitude of the change in [tHb] (p < 0.0001), the time courses of the [CytO2] and [tHb] signals were parallel in 11 of the 14 children and the error of fit in the NIRS multicomponent analysis increased 10- to 100-fold over system noise. A new NIRS algorithm, using wavelength specific optical pathlengths, did not improve the error of fit but produced smaller estimates of [CytO2] changes, which were unrelated to the [tHb] changes. In our opinion the interesting possibility of monitoring cytochrome oxidation by NIRS requires further validation."

Chloral hydrate was administered orally or rectally to infants using doses of 50 mg/kg. We collected and analyzed relevant clinical parameters.The overall length of time to achieve sedation was ranged from 5 to 35 min (10.8 ± 6.2 min); the overall mean duration of sedation was ranged from 15 to 60 min (33.5 ± 11.3 min); and the overall mean length of time to return to normal activity was 10 min to 6 h (34.3 ± 16.2 min). The length of the PCICU stay was ranged from 3 to 30 days (8.2 ± 7.1 days). Physiologically, there were no clinically significant changes in heart rate, mean arterial pressure, respiratory rate, or peripheral oxygen saturation before, during, or after use of the chloral hydrate. There were no significant differences regarding sedative effects in the subgroups (cyanotic vs acyanotic group, with pulmonary infection vs without pulmonary infection group, and with pulmonary hypertension vs without pulmonary hypertension group).Our experience suggests that chloral hydrate is a safe and efficacious agent for conscious sedation of infants in the PCICU."
CD011912,0,11573523,0,Arterial to end-tidal carbon dioxide tension difference in children with congenital heart disease.,"In children with congenital cyanotic heart disease, right-to-left intracardiac shunting causes an obligatory difference between arterial and end-tidal carbon dioxide tension (PaCO2-PE'CO2) as venous blood, rich in carbon dioxide, is added to the arterial circulation. This obligatory PaCO2-PE'CO2 difference, which can be predicted from knowledge of oxygen saturation, haemoglobin concentration and PaCO2, increases as oxygen saturation decreases, most markedly when the haemoglobin concentration is high. A second possible cause of the PaCO2-PE'CO2 difference is the effect of pulmonary hypoperfusion caused by the shunt. We studied 60 children undergoing cardiac surgery and compared the predicted the PaCO2-PE'CO2 difference with measured values to investigate the extent to which additional factors influence the clinically observed PaCO2-PE'CO2. In many children, observed values were much greater than predicted, which is compatible with some degree of pulmonary hypoperfusion. However, this was not felt to represent the complete picture in all patients. Another cause of ventilation-perfusion mismatch was suspected in those children who showed a considerable improvement in oxygen saturation during ventilation with an increased FIO2. We believe that pulmonary congestion caused by large left-to-right shunts may further increase the PaCO2-PE'CO2 difference."

In cases of ventricular septal defect, the incidence of pulmonary complications was significantly higher in the minithoracotomy group than in the full sternotomy or ministernotomy groups. In patients with tetralogy of Fallot, hemoglobin concentration was higher, oxygen saturation was lower, and more patients required a transanular patch in the sternotomy group than in the other groups, but the clinical results were similar. Patients with complex defects or severe pulmonary hypertension should undergo a full sternotomy."

The indication for angioplasty was a cyanotic heart defect not amenable to total surgical correction, either because of the age and size at presentation or because of anatomic complexity, but at the same time requiring palliation of pulmonary oligemia. Following balloon angioplasty, there was an increase in arterial oxygen saturation from 71 +/- 8% to 81 +/- 6% (p less than 0.05). In one child with long segment narrowing, there was no significant improvement in oxygen saturation, and this child underwent an additional BT shunt on the contralateral side. On follow-up 3 to 12 months after balloon angioplasty, the oxygen saturations remained improved (78 +/- 10%) in the remaining five patients. In two children with either complete or almost complete blockage of the BT shunt, we were unable to advance any catheter across the shunt but we were able to advance a 2 or 3 mm balloon on a wire and dilate the shunt, followed by introduction of a catheter carrying a larger balloon for angioplasty. This has permitted us to obtain the pulmonary artery pressure directly (this information was of obvious value in patient management) and resulted in an improvement in the arterial oxygen saturation. It is concluded that (1) balloon angioplasty of narrowed BT shunts is feasible, effective, and safe and (2) even completely occluded shunts can be cannulated and the balloon dilated with the newly available balloon-on-wire devices."

The haematological values and arterial oxygen saturations of three children with cyanotic congenital heart disease are presented. They illustrate how iron deficiency causes discrepant values for arterial oxygen saturation and haemoglobin/haematocrit and that ""normal"" haemoglobin/haematocrit levels in such children may constitute anaemia.

Patients were randomly assigned to receive either a placebo lozenge or a lozenge of 15-20 micrograms.kg-1) OTFC 45 min preoperatively and were managed in a double-blinded manner. Heart rate, respiratory rate (RR), blood pressure, and digital pulse oximetry (SpO2) were monitored throughout the study. Scoring systems were utilized to evaluate sedation, anxiety, cooperation, and ease and quality of parental separation and anaesthetic induction. Adverse effects were noted. Preoperatively, sedation was observed in both groups, but children receiving OTFC had significantly less distress at time of separation from parents. Clinically significant less distress at and SpO2 were observed more frequently in children in the OTFC group than in the placebo group. The authors conclude that, in paediatric cardiac surgical patients, OTFC induces preoperative sedation and facilitates separation of the patients from their parents, but is associated with decreases in respiratory rate and SpO2 that may be of clinical importance."

CD011912,0,10549227,0,[Cardiovascular disease in pregnancy].,"There is a heterogeneous population of young women with cardiovascular disease contemplating pregnancy. Many of the conditions are rare and require teams with expertise in the management of such patients. A specific congenital or acquired cardiovascular anomaly and its physiology must be understood. The nature of prior surgical procedures and the residua and sequelae following therapy are essential to manage a pregnant woman with cardiovascular disease. Physiologic changes during pregnancy and after delivery must be known. Counseling includes maternal and fetal risk stratification and genetic counseling regarding inherited disorders. The outcome of pregnancy is favourable in many women with good functional class. These patients can be reassured. A multidisciplinary approach may be crucial to manage this population during pregnancy, labour, delivery and in the postpartum period to avoid serious maternal and fetal complications. Women with intermediate and high risk pregnancy must be followed and managed in a high risk pregnancy unit and a team from obstetricians, cardiologists, anesthetists, pediatricians, neonatologists and cardiac surgeons who are skilled in high risk pregnancies. Vaginal delivery is the method of choice in many women (class 1 woman) and cesarean section is seldom a cardiac indication. Contraindications for pregnancy are: poor maternal functional class, poor ventricular function, severe cyanosis without pulmonary hypertension (oxygen saturation < or = 85%), pulmonary vascular disease, severe mitral stenosis, severe left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, Marfan syndrome with aortic dilatation (> 40 mm) and aortic valve involvement (moderate to severe aortic regurgitation), symptomatic hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy.

Analysis of the left ventricular function (author's transl)].,"Twenty-five patients with tricuspid atresia, ranging in age between 2 months and 23 years, previously morphologically studied, were assessed by M-mode echocardiography with regard to left ventricular function. Fifteen of them underwent palliative cardiac surgery (systemic-pulmonary anastomosis). Thirty normal subjects, same age and sex, were selected as controls. Patients with tricuspid atresia had a significant increase of left ventricular dimensions and mass and significant decrease of shortening fraction and ejection fraction. The left ventricular pre-ejection/ejection ratio (LPEP/LVET) was significantly higher in patients with tricuspid atresia compared to normals. In patients without surgical shunt there was no significant correlation between Qp/Qs determined by oximetry and the end-diastolic dimension and left ventricular function parameters. In patients with surgical shunt a significant correlation was found between ejection fraction, shortening fraction, systolic time intervals and Qp/Qs. Qp/Qs significantly correlated with end-diastolic dimension. Shortening fraction and ejection fraction were higher in patients with satisfactory systemic saturation, while left ventricular mass was increased in patients with longstanding surgical shunt. These data suggest that patients with tricuspid atresia, with or without surgical shunt, may present with a decreased left ventricular function, early detectable by echocardiography."

Congenital cardiopathies].,"A most significant life event in the first years of life is a disease, especially if it is of early onset, severe, life threatening, with an uncertain prognosis, and with the necessity of frequent diagnostic and therapeutic interventions. Psychological implications are a significant parts of the illness, not a marginal component; they can affect prognosis and outcome. The authors describe the different psychological implications of an experience of chronic disease in children and adolescents and their families (parents and siblings). Congenital disease (for example congenital heart failure) has a peculiar significance: since it is diagnosed early, it influences mother-infant interactions from the beginning, in a crucial moment of the infant's psychological development; diagnostic and therapeutical interventions are early and frequent; congenital defects determine the strongest guilt feelings in the parents. Some specific psychological aspects can be described: the weakening of the Bodily self, the inhibition of thinking, the theories the child and the family formulates on the disease, the death feelings. Emotional features in children and adolescents with congenital cardiopathy are described: inhibition of emotions, marked anxiety, depressive reaction, with loneliness, low self-esteem and inadequacy, emotional lability, with oscillation between omnipotence and inadequacy; impulsiveness; weakness of self identity; especially in bodily Self. Some psychopathological aspects in children and adolescents with heart transplant and their families are also described. Intellectual level of patients with congenital heart disease is in the normal range, although significantly lower than normal controls. There is a positive correlation between worsening of intellectual functioning and clinical severity of the heart disease; this clinical severity is related both to restrictions in normal daily life activities, and blood oxygen saturation. It is hard to tease apart the role of early physical limitations versus the role of chronic hypoxia, in affecting intellectual development. Some methodological considerations are described, relating to the role of the physician, the psychological support to the children and adolescents and their families, the problem of the shared-cares between main centres and local hospitals, where primary health-care team operates."
CD011912,0,3813710,0,Surgical management of infants with complex cardiac anomalies associated with reduced pulmonary blood flow and total anomalous pulmonary venous drainage.,"Eight infants with complex cardiac anomalies and pulmonary stenosis or atresia were noted to have obstructed total anomalous pulmonary venous drainage (TAPVD) either at the initial cardiac catheterization (Group 1; n = 2) or after creation of systemic-pulmonary artery shunts (Group 2; n = 6). The 2 patients in Group 1 underwent early repair of TAPVD (1 at 7 days, the other at 1 1/2 months of age) before any subsequent operation and are now doing well at 18 months of age. The 6 patients in Group 2 underwent repeat cardiac catheterization because of persistent severe cyanosis with faint or absent continuous murmur and were found to have patent shunts and obstructed TAPVD (1 mild, 5 severe). One patient who underwent repair of TAPVD at 2 1/2 months of age survived and is well at 2 years of age, whereas 4 patients who underwent repair at an average age of 6 months (age range, 3-16 months) subsequently died. The sixth patient, who did not undergo repair, remained severely cyanotic with hypoplastic pulmonary arteries in spite of repeated shunts. We feel that increased awareness of the possible association of TAPVD and reduced pulmonary blood flow in infants with complex cardiac defects, in combination with echocardiography, oxygen saturation studies, and angiography with prostaglandin E1 challenge, should lead to early diagnosis, avoidance of unnecessary systemic-pulmonary artery shunts, and increased survival rates in these infants."

CD011912,0,27994302,1,Modern Strategy for Identification of Congenital Heart Defects in the Neonatal Period.,"Congenital heart defects are the most common congenital anomalies and occur with an incidence from 0.8 to 1% per 1000 live births. In recent years, the pulse oximetry has become a strong candidate for detecting cyanogen congenital heart defects and in combination with routine clinical exam can improve diagnostic of congenital heart diseases."
CD011912,0,6116180,0,[Neurologic disorders and cerebral lesion in children with TGA (transposition of the great arteries) (author's transl)].,"118 consecutive patients with TGA were examined for neurologic disorders (ND) and cerebral lesions (CL) between 1967--1979 of whom 43 are alive. 66 had simple TGA, 52 had VSD, PS and/or coarctation as additional lesion.--43 were corrected surgically of whom 32 are alive.--Neurologic examination was performed in all, EEG, CT, arteriography, scintigraphy and autopsy when necessary or possible. Patholog. findings (CL, ND) were detected in 66; 47 had definite ND or CL, while 19 showed gross motor development delay. 52 of 118 children with TGA were without neurolog. or cerebral pathology. --Several factors were investigated for their etiologic influence: 1. Additional cardiac lesions played no significant role. 2. The lower O2 saturation in the ascending aorta of the fetal circulation in TGA may be of importance. 3. Red blood count, hemoglobin, hematocrit were higher in the group with ND or CL. 4. Early appearance of cerebral lesion should suggest earlier corrective surgery."
