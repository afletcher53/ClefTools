CD010778,0,9149995,0,The treatment of enchondromas in the hand by endoscopic curettage without bone grafting.,"Nine patients with enchondromas in the hand were treated by endoscopic curettage of the tumour without bone grafting. The procedure was performed on an out-patient basis using axillary block anaesthesia. New bone formation and remodelling of the lesions were observed in all patients. There were no postoperative fractures, infections, recurrences or other complications. Functional recovery was rapid. We conclude that endoscopic curettage without bone grafting is an effective treatment of enchondroma in the hand."
CD010778,0,12365043,0,Enchondroma in the hand retrospective study--recurrence cases.,This is a retrospective analysis of 21 patients with documented enchondroma of the hand. They were operated on between 1980 to 2000 with conventional curettage and bone grafting. The objective of this study is to analyse the chance of recurrence and evaluate the effectiveness of surgical treatment. One patient had recurrence after six years. Longer follow-up period is recommended as there is a possibility of recurrence even after five years. This study revealed that enchondroma of the hand is more common on the ulnar site.
CD010778,0,16081020,0,Calcaneal tumors and tumor-like conditions.,"Approximately 3% of osseous tumors occur in the foot and ankle. Solitary bone cysts, chondroblastoma, intraosseous lipoma, osteoid osteoma, chondrosarcoma, and Ewing's sarcoma seem to have a predilection for the calcaneus. Biopsy is often a crucial step in management. Tumor-like conditions, such as cysts, reactive lesions, and osteomyelitis, must be considered during evaluation. Treatment is often observation or curettage of benign lesions and resection or amputation for malignancies."
CD010778,0,25408730,0,Finger enchondroma treated with bone substituents - a case presentation.,"About 90% of the hand bone tumors are enchondromas. Treatment of choice is complete curettage and bone grafting, usually with bone autografts. We present a case of finger enchondroma in a 27-year-old female patient who was treated with curettage and synthetic bone grafting. Clinical, surgical and pathological findings in this case are presented along with a brief discussion of literature."
CD010778,0,23451467,0,Result of arthroscopic removal of an enchondroma at the talar dome: a case report.,"Enchondroma is a benign tumor that is generally asymptomatic and rarely found in the talus. A forty-nine-year-old man, had a chronic left ankle pain which related to moderate to heavy activity. A plain radiograph and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a 1.3 cm benign lobulated intramedullary lesion at the middle 1/3 of medial part of talar dome with sclerotic rim. An arthroscopic intralesional curettage of the ankle joint was performed without bone grafting. Histologic examination was consistent with the diagnosis of an enchondroma. The patient was asymptomatic and without restriction on his job at 6 months. At 1 year of follow-up, the CT scan and MRI demonstrated no recurrence of the tumor but the defect was not filled up."
CD010778,0,23061956,0,Single clubbed finger caused by an enchondroma of the distal phalanx: an unusual clinical presentation.,"Single clubbed finger is an extremely rare condition that may show the presence of an underlying neoplasm of the distal phalanx. We describe a case of clubbing in a young adult patient with an enchondroma of the ring finger distal phalanx. The patient had a history of antecedent trauma to the left ring finger, suggesting the diagnosis of intraosseous epidermoid cyst rather than enchondroma. The lesion was successfully treated by curettage and packing of the bony defect with a synthetic bone substitute. Histologically, the tumour consisted of small, uniform chondrocytes without cytologic atypia. At the seven months follow-up, the patient had no evidence of recurrence, with a nearly normal-looking finger. We suggest that enchondroma should be considered in the differential diagnosis of clubbing in a single digit."
CD010778,0,27454024,0,Enchondroma of the Hand: Evaluation and Management.,"Enchondroma is the most common primary bone tumor of the hand. This benign, cartilaginous tumor often presents as a pathologic fracture. When hand enchondroma is suspected, less common conditions, such as multiple enchondromatosis syndromes and benign and malignant lesions, should be ruled out. Surgical management with curettage is the standard of care for symptomatic lesions. However, controversy surrounds the timing of surgery for pathologic fractures and the use of surgical adjuncts and postcurettage void management. Microscopically distinguishing hand enchondroma from low-grade hand chondrosarcoma is a diagnostic challenge for pathologists, but the primary surgical treatment for both conditions is curettage because the latter has a low metastatic potential. Postoperative complications are typically joint stiffness and soft-tissue[FIGURE DASH]related deformities, whereas recurrence and malignant degeneration of solitary lesions are much less common. Most patients return to full function after surgery."

CD010778,0,17452919,0,Curettage of biopsy-diagnosed grade 1 periacetabular chondrosarcoma.,"Intralesional excision of intraosseous grade 1 periacetabular chondrosarcoma may seem an attractive alternative to the current recommendation of joint-sacrificing, en bloc resection. We report eight patients who initially underwent this treatment to identify if local tumor control can be achieved consistently. All patients had a percutaneous biopsy that was interpreted as grade 1 chondrosarcoma. The final histology after curettage indicated Grade 1 chondrosarcoma in five patients, Grade 2 in two, and dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma in one. Three of the five patients with true grade 1 chondrosarcoma have been free of disease at a median followup of 108 months. The other two patients with grade 1 chondrosarcoma on the curettage specimen recurred as higher-grade tumors. Three patients died of high-grade chondrosarcoma at a median of 23 months (range 17-72 months). Overall, the majority of patients in this cohort had either a misdiagnosis or recurrence of higher-grade disease. Based on these observations, in the absence of a predictable method to identify the true intraosseous grade 1 chondrosarcomas of the pelvis, curettage must be undertaken with the understanding that a percutaneous biopsy may misrepresent the histologic grade and that curettage may result in a higher risk of recurrence."
CD010778,0,16570273,0,"Zoledronic acid slows down rat primary chondrosarcoma development, recurrent tumor progression after intralesional curretage and increases overall survival.","Chondrosarcoma is a difficult musculoskeletal tumor to treat. Surgical treatment leads to severe disability, with high rates of local recurrence and life threat. No adjuvant therapy is effective in differentiated chondrosarcomas. Bisphosphonates (BPs) are a class of molecules which is effective in malignant bone diseases. The aim of the present study was to determine the effects of zoledronic acid (ZOL) on chondrosarcoma tumor progression. ZOL was tested in vivo (s.c. 100 microg/kg, twice a week) in a rat chondrosarcoma model and in vitro (10(-7)-10(-4) M) on cells derived from this model. Two types of animal models were assessed, the first simulated development after intralesional curettage, the second nonoperative development of the tumor. Cell proliferation, caspase-1, -3 activities and cell cycle analysis were studied. The results revealed that ZOL slows down primary tumor development, tumor progression after intralesional curretage and increases overall survival. ZOL inhibits cell proliferation and increases cell death, with no significant variation of caspase-1 and -3 activities and cell cycle profiles. The present study demonstrates for the first time that in addition to surgery, the therapy of chondrosarcoma with BPs might be beneficial. Because of these first results, new therapeutic approaches of chondrosarcoma must be considered, mainly for low grade chondrosarcoma when disabling operation is planned and when only intralesional resection can be undertaken."
CD010778,0,9310048,0,Secondary chondrosarcoma in osteochondromas. Medullary extension in 15 of 45 cases.,"We reviewed 45 secondary chondrosarcomas: 16 arising in solitary osteochondromas and 29 in 27 patients with multiple osteochondromas. Less than radical or wide primary surgery resulted in local recurrence in 8 of 14 lesions: 2 of 2 intralesional excisions, 5 of 11 marginal excisions, and in one case with radiotherapy alone. No local recurrence was found after a primary wide surgical procedure in 30 lesions and a radical procedure in 1 lesion after a mean of 8 (0.2-22) years' follow-up. 5 patients had died: 3 of pulmonary metastases (2 stage IB, 1 stage IIB), and 2 of local tumor invasion, both in the spine. Medullary invasion occurred in 15 of 45 lesions, this was often than reported in secondary chondrosarcoma. Medullary invasion was not always detected preoperatively, even when MR or CT examinations had been performed. Therefore, we recommend that a secondary chondrosarcoma should be removed with a wide surgical resection, including a part of the underlying bone, to keep the local recurrence risk low. There were no clinical or prognostic differences between tumors that had arisen from solitary or from multiple osteochondromas."

Involvement of the craniofacial skeleton is extremely rare. We present the unique case of an adolescent boy with a chondromyxoid fibroma of the mandible. The chondromyxoid fibroma in this patient recurred after initial treatment with curettage. We treated the recurrence with resection of the involved mandible and immediate reconstruction using a vascularized musculo-osseus seventh rib flap (""Eve procedure""). Despite complex reconstruction in adolescents due to skeletal immaturity, the rib flap has successfully grown with the patient up to 3 years postoperatively. Therefore, we believe the musculo-osseus rib flap is a feasible solution for complex ramus and condyle reconstruction of the growing mandible in the adolescent patient."

We present a unique case of periosteal chondroma arising in the proximal phalanx of the left index finger in a 12-year-old boy. Physical examination revealed a slightly protuberant, subcutaneous mass. Plain radiographs and computed tomography scans showed a periosteal lesion producing saucerization of the cortex and subjacent cortical sclerosis, without internal matrix calcification. On magnetic resonance imaging, the lesion exhibited intermediate signal intensity on T1-weighted images and high signal intensity on T2-weighted images. Contrast-enhanced fat-suppressed T1-weighted images demonstrated peripheral and septal enhancement. The patient underwent a marginal excision with curettage of the underlying bone cortex. Histological examination confirmed the diagnosis of periosteal chondroma. There has been no evidence of local recurrence eight months after surgery. Periosteal chondroma can protrude into the subcutaneous soft tissue causing a palpable mass. Recognition of the typical radiological features can lead to an accurate diagnosis of this rare condition."
CD010778,0,19863432,0,Operative treatment of enchondromas of the hand: is cancellous bone grafting necessary?,"Curettage is the treatment of choice for enchondromas, the most common primary tumour of the hand. In contrast, additional bone grafting remains controversial. Between 1998 and 2004, we operated on 22 patients with monostotic enchondroma of the hand. Sixteen patients (eight of whom had no additional bone grafting, and eight who had) were evaluated at a mean of 68 (range 42-108) months (no) and 50 (range 29-65) months (bone grafts) postoperatively. Bone density was measured densitometrically on the radiographs, and the groups were compared with each other and within themselves with corresponding locations on the healthy opposite hand. Neither bone density nor functional results were significantly different. Additional bone grafting in the treatment of enchondromas is not necessary and should be reserved for particular indications."
CD010778,0,16961181,0,Ollier's disease treated with grafting using alpha-tricalcium phosphate cement. A case report.,"Ollier's disease is a rare disorder characterized by multiple enchondromas with a unilateral predominance, especially in fingers in early childhood. We experienced a case of Ollier's disease treated four times with simple curettage from the age of 2 years and alpha-tricalcium phosphate cement grafting at the age of 21 years. The forth curettage was performed when the patient was 15 years old and preoperative X-rays had shown remarkable finger deformities. Postoperative casting of the involved joints was necessary to prevent fractures but led to some finger contractures. Following X-rays demonstrated incredible improvement of the appearance. This suggests that simple curettage alone at an early stage of Ollier's disease provide cosmetic improvement. At the age of 21 years our patient showed enlargement of the intramedullary finger lesions again. Some lesions seemed to be impending pathological fractures. This time we chose alpha-tricalcium phosphate cement to fill the cavities after curettage had been carried out. Harvesting a large amount of autologous bone was not required. All activities of daily life could be resumed immediately after surgery and none of the finger joints showed further restriction of motion. X-rays taken three years after the operation showed new bone ingrowth surrounding the material with little evidence of absorption. To our knowledge, this may be the first case of Ollier's disease treated with artificial bone grafting reported in the English literature."
CD010778,0,16239809,0,An institutional review of clear cell chondrosarcoma.,"Clear cell chondrosarcoma is a rare bone neoplasm with a slow progressive clinical course and infrequent metastasis, but with a high local recurrence rate. We sought to ascertain the long-term outcome of patients with this neoplasm and to identify possible factors predicting survival. Sixteen patients with clear cell chondrosarcomas treated at one institution and who had long-term clinical followup were identified. All patients were treated by surgical resection of the tumor, which was classified as clear (> 2 mm) in 10 patients and marginal or intralesional in six patients. Three patients had local recurrence after a median of 1.7 years. Metastatic disease developed in four patients with a median time to diagnosis of 8.1 years. Ten-year overall survival of patients with clear cell chondrosarcomas was 89%, and disease-free survival was 68%. Patients with surgical resections comprising clear margins had longer disease-free survival compared with patients with marginal and intralesional tumors. Inadequate surgical resection of clear cell chondrosarcoma leads to risk of local recurrence and metastatic disease. The malignancy has a tendency to metastasize relatively late, therefore, followup of patients is necessary after the generally accepted 5-year period."
CD010778,0,14599838,0,Chondrosarcoma of small bones of the hand.,"A clinicopathological review of 23 patients (mean age, 67 years; range, 42-85 years) with chondrosarcoma of the bones of the hand was done. The mean follow up was 8.5 years. Eleven patients presented with a progressive painless swelling, 26% having had symptoms for over 10 years. The proximal phalanx was the commonest site. Initial clinical misdiagnosis as ganglion, bursa, gout, rheumatoid arthritis and a cyst occurred in five patients. Radiologically most lesions showed bone expansion, cortical destruction and soft-tissue extension. The majority was of high histologic grade (Evan's grade 2 & 3) with extensive myxoid areas. Five out of eight patients who were originally treated by curettage or excision had local recurrences compared to none treated by ray resection or amputation of phalanx (P=0.002). None had metastases. The low risk of metastases despite the high histologic grade indicates that chondrosarcomas of the hand behave differently from chondrosarcomas elsewhere."

CD010778,0,11154009,0,Use of the Ilizarov external fixator in the treatment of patients with Ollier's disease.,"The authors present the results of treatment of 10 patients with Ollier's disease using the Ilizarov technique. The Ilizarov device was used to treat leg length discrepancy and to enhance the conversion of chondroma cartilage into normal mature bone, with no curettage and bone grafting. The mean duration of treatment was 9.4 months. This technique was highly efficient in treating the disease. It led to conversion of the abnormal cartilage into histologically mature bone in all patients. Some complications were seen, such as decreased knee mobility, which required prolonged use of the device. The Ilizarov technique is successful in treating patients with Ollier's disease despite some complications and the difficulty in using the technique."
CD010778,0,7892005,0,"[Chondroma, chondroblastoma and chondromyxoid fibroma].","Chondromas are benign tumors characterized by the formation of mature cartilage. Typically, they involve the short bones of the hands and feet. The lesions may be either solitary or multiple as part of enchondromatosis affecting several bones. Cases of multiple enchondromatosis with predominantly unilateral distribution are generally referred to as ""Ollier's disease"" or when accompanied by multiple hemangiomas as ""Maffucci's syndrome"". In cases with multiple chondromas there is considerable risk of malignant transformation (approximately 50%). Treatment of single lesions (curettage and bone grafting) is usually uneventful, but any therapeutic approach to Ollier's disease or Maffucci's syndrome should be tailored to the individual distribution of lesions in the most severely deformed extremities. Chondroblastomas are uncommon benign tumors that are almost invariably situated in the epiphyses of long bones adjacent to the epiphyseal cartilage plate. Histologically, they are characterized by round or polygonal chondroblasts with focal accumulation of osteoclast-like giant cells. Intercellular substance is scanty, and calcification occurs typically at focal areas. Lung metastases are reported in rare single cases with high survival rates after local resection, indicating low-grade malignancy. Only a few recurrences have been reported following curettage and bone grafting. Avascular necrosis or chondrolysis with subsequent secondary osteoarthrosis may occur after surgical treatment of chondroblastoma of the upper femur epiphysis. These severe indirect sequelae should be considered both when planning surgery and during follow-up. Chondromyxoid fibromas are rare benign tumors that are mostly diagnosed in the second and third decade; they are mainly found in the proximal tibial metaphysis. Histologically, there are areas of chondroid, myxoid, and fibrotic tissues, of which the myxoid component is characteristic for chondromyxoid fibromas.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

CD010778,0,15270588,0,Cryotherapy of musculoskeletal tumors--from basic science to clinical results.,"Combined modality treatment of musculoskeletal tumors led to improved patient survival. As survival improves, more consideration is given to the functional outcome of treatment, and interest is focused on the development of less mutilating and extensive surgery. One modality that can reduce patient disability significantly is cryosurgery, as it allows minimally invasive surgery based on marginal resection and tumor interface sterilization instead of wide resection of certain neoplasms. Classical cryosurgery as developed by Marcove involves pouring of liquid nitrogen into the tumor bed. This approach revolutionized the treatment of some tumors such as giant cell tumor of bone, allowing intra-lesional resection to substitute the wide-resection method used up to that time. However, complications of this method of treatment are common, including nitrogen emboli, fractures of the bone due to extensive necrosis and damage to neurovascular elements. A recent development in the field of cryosurgery has been the argon-based system allowing controlled formation of an ice-ball surrounding a metallic probe. The system is computer controlled and allows precise evaluation of the tumor bed interface as well as surrounding structures that need to be protected. Prior to application of this method in humans it is important to ensure that interface sterilization is indeed achieved using cryosurgery. To evaluate this question, a Swarm rat chondrosarcoma was used. Cell viability was assessed following ice-ball formation. Histological evaluation indicated that cell death occurs up to 5 millimeters from the ice-ball if temperatures of -40 degrees Celsius at the metallic probe are achieved. A further evaluation was performed on samples obtained from patients during surgery. A minimum of two freezing cycles was shown to be necessary to achieve tissue viability similar to that of boiled tissue. Twenty-seven patients were operated to date using an argon-based cryosurgery system. The patients included 7 cases of grade I chondrosarcoma, 5 cases of giant cell tumor of bone, 14 cases of a metastatic lytic bone lesion and a single case of osseous-fibrous dysplasia. None of the patients suffered nerve injury during the operation. After a minimal follow-up period of 2 years only two of the surviving patients had a recurrence (a giant cell tumor of the proximal fibula, and the patient with the osseous-fibrous dysplasia whose tumor recurred as a frankly malignant adamantimoma). There were no pathological fractures. This method appears practical and allows close monitoring of the surrounding tissue to reduce the chances of recurrence."

Four patients with an enchondroma, three in the proximal humerus and one in the distal femur, were treated by curettage and filling of the defect with Norian SRS cement. Clinical and radiological follow-up including CT and MRI was carried out for 18 months. All three patients with lesions in the proximal humerus had severe pain and limited movement of the shoulder. The radiological and CT appearances of the cement were unchanged at follow-up. There were characteristic appearances of synovitis and periosteitis on MRI in two patients. Since the cement induces a soft-tissue reaction the bony cavity should be sealed with the curetted and burred bone after curettage and introduction of Norian cement, especially in sites where a tourniquet cannot be applied."

Finally Richter et al. gave an account of 25 cases of tuberculous osteitis, osteomyelitis and bone tumors treated by this method. We have practised this method since 1984 in the treatment of enchondroma. Careful scraping-out with a sharp curette, milling the sclerosed wall and rinsing the cavity with dehydrated alcohol is followed by immediate reconstruction, filling the cavity with a gamma-ray-sterilized CaSO4-paste mixed with the local antibiotic Nebacetin siccum. As observed by other authors, this implant clearly stimulates osteogenesis. It is not necessary to take spongiosa fragments out of the iliac crest and we need no general anaesthesia.

CD010778,0,16273466,0,[A rare case of chondromyxoid fibroma of the parietal bone].,"The authors present a very rare case of the chondromyxoid fibroma (CMF) of the parietal bone. This is an uncommon chondroid tumour which constitutes less than 1% of primary bone tumours and which is usually localised in the metaphysis of the long bones, often in the knee region. There are 23 cases of cranial localisation of the chondromyxoid fibroma reported in several papers, 14 cases involved the cranial base and 9 the calvaria. A different ossification process of the skull-base and calvaria is probably responsible for this distribution. In our case we found the focal, lytic lesion in the parietal bone and fibro-greasy tumour mass. The dura was spared. The tumour was removed totally. Curettage of these kind of lesions should be avoided because it may lead to tumour recurrence. Histologically this tumour may cause problems in a differential diagnosis with other chondroid tumours like chondrosarcoma or chondroblastoma."

A frozen section was performed at the time of open biopsy was felt to be consistent with either chondroblastoma or CCCS.

Some authors are proposing minimally invasive treatment using endoscopy. Our purpose is to standardise this technique based on a study of the number and locations of entry points. This is a report on three benign metacarpal bone tumours treated with three different endoscopic approaches: multiportal, extended uniportal and oblique uniportal. In theory, the multiportal approach has several drawbacks: weakening of the bone cortex, a limited visual field and seepage of injectable phosphocalcic cement. The extended uniportal approach causes cortical defects, unacceptable in a minimally invasive technique. The oblique uniportal approach seems less troublesome; vision of the bone cavity is good, curettage of the tumour is complete, the bone cortex is undamaged and there is no leakage of injectable phosphocalcic cement. All things considered, the oblique osteoscopic uniportal approach seems to be the best option for the management of benign bone tumours of the hand."

The surgical margins were wide in all patients with GCT. The surgical margins were wide in 3 patients and wide contaminated in 1 patient with chordoma. The 2 patients with chondrosarcoma had high sacral lesions and were managed with total sacrectomy and lumbopelvic fixation. The surgical margin was wide in 1 patient and wide contaminated in the other, who relapsed locally and systemically in the 30th postoperative month. Three patients with aggressive aneurysmal bone cyst and 1 patient with simple bone cyst were managed by curettage and thorough debridement. One patient with low sacral Ewing sarcoma was managed by subtotal sacrectomy with wide margins. The two osteoblastomas were localized to the posterior elements of the sacrum. None of the patients relapsed. Most of the tumors of the sacrum are benign aggressive lesions or low grade malignancies. Intralesional resections in the form of curettage, with the addition of chemo- or thermocauterization, provide a complete cure for benign lesions. In contrast, wide resections are necessary for complete disease control in radio- and chemoresistant malignancies. Nerve root dissection should be performed in order to achieve wide margins."

CD010778,0,25086127,0,How safe is curettage of low-grade cartilaginous neoplasms diagnosed by imaging with or without pre-operative needle biopsy?,"The pre-operative differentiation between enchondroma, low-grade chondrosarcoma and high-grade chondrosarcoma remains a diagnostic challenge. We reviewed the accuracy and safety of the radiological grading of cartilaginous tumours through the assessment of, first, pre-operative radiological and post-operative histological agreement, and second the rate of recurrence in lesions confirmed as high-grade on histology. We performed a retrospective review of major long bone cartilaginous tumours managed by curettage as low grade between 2001 and 2012. A total of 53 patients with a mean age of 47.6 years (8 to 71) were included. There were 23 men and 30 women. The tumours involved the femur (n = 20), humerus (n = 18), tibia (n = 9), fibula (n = 3), radius (n = 2) and ulna (n = 1). Pre-operative diagnoses resulted from multidisciplinary consensus following radiological review alone for 35 tumours, or with the addition of pre-operative image guided needle biopsy for 18. The histologically confirmed diagnosis was enchondroma for two (3.7%), low-grade chondrosarcoma for 49 (92.6%) and high-grade chondrosarcoma for two (3.7%). Three patients with a low-grade tumour developed a local recurrence at a mean of 15 months (12 to 17) post-operatively. A single high-grade recurrence (grade II) was treated with tibial diaphyseal replacement. The overall recurrence rate was 7.5% at a mean follow-up of 4.7 years (1.2 to 12.3). Cartilaginous tumours identified as low-grade on pre-operative imaging with or without additional image-guided needle biopsy can safely be managed as low-grade without pre-operative histological diagnosis. A few tumours may demonstrate high-grade features histologically, but the rates of recurrence are not affected."

CD010778,0,19388607,0,Chondromyxoid fibroma involving the metacarpophalangeal joint.,"Chondromyxoid fibroma is a rare benign bony tumor classically occurring in the metaphyseal region of the long bones surrounding the knee, but also found with relative frequency in other long bones, the pelvis, ribs, and small foot bones. The small bones of the hand, however, are rarely involved. The tumor is considered a physeal plate remnant and may involve the epiphysis, diaphysis, or both along with its metaphyseal origin. It may cause cortical expansion and destruction, but consistently respects the periosteal boundary. We report a case of histopathologically confirmed chondromyxoid fibroma involving a metacarpal, proximal phalanx, and synovial tissues of the metacarpophalangeal joint. A 29-year-old woman presented with pain, weakness, and a mass of the right ring finger metacarpophalangeal joint that had persisted since prior surgery to remove an extraosseous chondroma. Prominent soft tissue swelling and limited range of motion were noted, corresponding to magnetic resonance imaging findings of lytic changes in the right ring finger metacarpal and proximal phalanx, surrounded by an irregularly enhancing mass with soft tissue extension. Open biopsy revealed calcified cartilaginous synovial deposits suspicious for synovial chondromatosis, with erosion into surrounding bones. Histologic examination revealed an unusual chondromyxoid fibroma with joint involvement. The patient is >15 months out from synovectomy, intralesional curettage, and placement of demineralized bone matrix and allograft cancellous chips, and is without signs of recurrence. This benign, curable lesion should be included in the differential diagnosis of a bony lesion, even when a joint and adjacent bones are involved."

CD010778,0,15346079,0,Scapular chondrosarcomas have high rates of local recurrence and metastasis.,"This is the first report of a large series of patients with scapular chondrosarcomas. The grade distributions, locations of the tumors in the scapula, surgical techniques, status of margins, chondrosarcoma subtypes, Enneking stages, adjuvant therapies, local recurrence rates, metastasis rates, and survival prognoses of patients with scapular chondrosarcoma were evaluated. Forty-seven patients treated between 1921 and 1999 were analyzed retrospectively. Grade 3 disease was significantly associated with a poorer survival prognosis when compared with Grades 1 or 2 disease. Patients with tumors smaller than 5 cm were treated mainly with partial scapulectomy, and patients with tumors larger than 5 cm often were treated with total scapulectomy. The survival prognoses of patients with intralesional resections at initial surgery showed a tendency toward poorer survival when compared with patients with wide resections at initial surgery. Metastasis and local recurrence (21.3% and 40.4%) were higher in scapular chondrosarcomas than rates reported for patients with general chondrosarcomas, and local recurrence or metastasis was associated with limited survival. The 5- and 15-year survival probabilities subsequent to diagnosis were 79% and 53%, respectively. The high rates of local recurrence and metastasis likely were caused by the difficult anatomic relationships encountered during scapular resections. This study shows the importance of wide margins which must be achieved to provide local disease control."

Traditionally there are also some non-neoplastic bone lesions which are classified as benign bone tumors and belonging to the group of tumor-like bone lesions. For the physician it is important to know those entities which are harmless, as well as those which can tend to re-occur or which ones can be locally destructive.

Sixty-two patients with enchondroma were treated with high-speed burring (29 patients) or alcohol instillation (33 patients) after curettage. The mean follow-up was 40.8 months. No significant differences in the visual analogue scale, Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand scores, total range of active motion, grip strength, and complete healing time were observed between the groups. The distribution of the results of the formula by Wilhelm and Feldmeier were not significantly different between the groups.

CD010778,0,12671504,0,Reconstruction of the pelvis after resection of tumors about the acetabulum.,"Periacetabular resections for primary malignancies and metastatic disease require reconstruction to restore weightbearing along anatomic axes. Without reconstruction, patients are unable to ambulate independently, and are left with a disfigured pelvis and shortened limb. The current authors describe a reconstruction technique using Steinmann pins augmented with methylmethacrylate reconstruction, and autoclaved autografting, in combination with total hip arthroplasty, after resection of primary sarcomas of the pelvis. For this study, the results of 15 patients at two institutions who had surgery by the same surgeons were retrospectively reviewed. The patients had primary malignant tumors of the pelvis, and had limb-sparing resections between 1985 and 2000. Three measures of outcome were evaluated: survival, function, and pain. The surgical method uses Steinmann pins with bone cement to fill in areas of bone loss that cannot be reconstructed with autoclaved autograft. A constrained polyethylene acetabular component is cemented into this bed. Twelve patients had chondrosarcoma and one patient had osteosarcoma. The remaining two patients had alveolar sarcoma of soft parts. Six patients died of disease. Seven patients were alive with no evidence of disease, and two were alive with disease at the most recent followup. Early return to ambulation without assistive devices occurred in nine of 15 patients. The functional outcome of this technique compares favorably with others reported. Sixty percent of patients ambulated independently without assistive devices, compared with 0% to 10% in other studies reviewed. The time required for independent gait is similar to recovery from a total hip arthroplasty. Moreover, this method minimized leg length discrepancy, while also producing a favorable cosmetic result."

CD010778,0,18378543,0,The clinical approach towards chondrosarcoma.,"This review provides an overview of the histopathology, classification, diagnostic procedures, and therapy of skeletal chondrosarcoma. Chondrosarcomas that arise de novo are primary chondrosarcomas, whereas chondrosarcomas developing superimposed on pre-existing benign cartilage neoplasms such as enchondromas or osteochondromas are referred to as secondary chondrosarcomas. Conventional chondrosarcomas can be categorized according to their location in bone into central, peripheral, and juxtacortical chondrosarcomas. Histological grading is related to prognosis; however, it is also subject to interobserver variability. Rare subtypes of chondrosarcoma, including dedifferentiated, mesenchymal, and clear cell chondrosarcoma, are discussed as well. Magnetic resonance imaging is necessary to delineate the extent of the intraosseous and soft tissue involvement preoperatively. Computed tomography is especially recommended in the pelvis and other flat bones where it may be difficult to discern the pattern of bone destruction and the presence of matrix mineralization. Wide, en-bloc excision is the preferred surgical treatment in intermediate- and high-grade chondrosarcoma. In low-grade chondrosarcoma confined to the bone, extensive intralesional curettage followed by local adjuvant treatment and filling the cavity with bone graft has promising long-term clinical results and satisfactory local control. Chondrosarcomas are relatively radiotherapy resistant; therefore, doses >60 Gy are needed in attempts to achieve local control after incomplete resection. Irradiation with protons or other charged particles seems beneficial in this curative situation. Chemotherapy is only possibly effective in mesenchymal chondrosarcoma, and is of uncertain value in dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma. Potential new systemic treatment targets are being discussed."

Patients were aged between 9 and 51 years and were treated by this method between the years 1986 and 1993. Minimal follow up was 13 months. The commonest histological diagnosis was giant cell tumour (7), followed by aneurysmal bone cyst (6), chondromyxoidfibroma (3) and low grade chondrosarcoma (1). Patients were assessed for functional outcome and local recurrence. On average 86 per cent of premorbid function was restored at follow up and there was one local recurrence (6.29 per cent). We conclude that this is a satisfactory method of gaining local control of these tumours."

The necrotizing effect was measured by determining the thickness of the cell layers demonstrating nuclear pyknosis or necrosis after 2 min of phenolization in a light microscope by ocular measurements in microns. No effect could be seen in epidermal tissue and in cartilage, whereas all other normal tissues exhibited necrotic zones between 40 and 500 microns. In all the tumors except those with chondromatous tissue, necrotic zones between 40 and 1000 microns were found. No difference in extension of the necrotic zone was seen between specimens from benign and malignant tumors and tumor-simulating processes. Phenolization cannot be recommended for the treatment of chondromatous tumors."

CD010778,0,455830,0,Adjuvant arterial embolization in the treatment of benign primary bone tumors in children.,This report presents an initial clinical experience with arterial embolization as adjuvent therapy in the surgical treatment of selected benign primary bone tumors in childhood. Embolization was dramatically effective in 4 children with spinal or pelvic vascular tumors. This technique facilitated local surgical resection and/or curettage. No child had evidence of local recurrence. Three of the 4 children had spinal cord or nerve root compression resulting in various degrees of paralysis prior to surgery. All treated patients had complete recovery from their paralysis. There were no complications of embolization or surgery. The treatment of benign primary bone tumors of the spine and pelvis is immeasurably improved by the adjuvant arterial embolization procedure. The immediate surgical treatment of these difficult tumors now becomes feasible with the greatly diminished blood flow resulting from embolization.

CD010778,0,12491047,0,[Treatment concepts of benign bone tumors and tumor-like bone lesions].,"The indications for surgical treatment of benign bone tumors and tumor-like lesions depend on the biological activity, clinical symptoms and anatomic location of the the lesion. Clinically silent lesions (""leave me alone Lesions"") lacking any scintigraphic enhancement and without danger of pathologic fracture or malign transformation only need surveillance and do not require surgery.However, tumors becoming symptomatic, displaying progression after termination of skeletal growth or radiographic signs of malignancy should be scheduled for surgical intervention. For most benign tumors intralesional curettage and subsequent bone grafting is the treatment of choice, maintaining structural integrity and functional stability of the bone and adjacent joint. In case of uncertain histopathological diagnosis an open biopsy should be performed followed by definitive either marginal or en-bloc resection, preferably at a single procedure. Depending on the tumor-specific risk of recurrence, adjuvant measures as phenol instillation or cryotherapy using liquid nitrogen may additionally be applied. As for the unicameral juvenile bone cyst or osteoid osteoma alternative minimal invasive techniques like corticoid injection and CT-guided percutaneous eradication of the nidus have been successfully introduced into clinical practice. Depending on the activity of the tumor recurrent lesions are recommended to be treated by marginal or enbloc resection. The radical and aggressive mode of surgical therapy has to be balanced with the treatment-related morbidity, i.e. complication rate, possibilities for reconstructive stabilizations and resultant functional deficits,making the decision a responsible challenge to the orthopedic surgeon."

One case did not heal after curettage and grafting. When symptoms are present or the cortical strength is decreased, we recommend operation. We find that the eccentric type of enchondroma can be treated adequately by curettage alone, while curettage and filling of the cavity with cancellous bone should be preferred in the central and polycentric forms. It is important that all material is removed from the cyst, which has to be packed completely with bone chips. The possibility of malignant change in enchondromas should be borne in mind, but we did not see this."

This study investigates the expression of VEGF together with other growth factors and proliferation markers such as TGFβ2, Ki-67, TNF, FGF1, P53 in 8 cases of hand chondroma treated with courettage, in order to define the ethiopathogenesis of this tumour and the clinical significance of the resulting immunohistochemical profile, with particular respect to angiogenesis. VEGF was expressed in all cases; 5 cases were positive for TFGβ2 and 3 for PDGF. None of the other factors was expressed. On the basis of histologic results a specific model of tumour progression based on the indicators of angiogenesis could be related to hand tumours, in which VEGF expression should be the first stadium of the tumour aggressiveness, and the following PDGF, TGF 2 expression should be accompanied with a morphological outline worsening. Nevertheless the non constant expression of these indicators and the absent expression of proliferated indicators can explain the scant tendency to the relapse in presence of accurate curettage. It is important to remember that the cellular polymorphism typical of the cartilaginous tumours does not allow the application of an only oncogenesis model."

In chronic cases, recurrent episodes of hydrarthrosis are reported, together with joint weakening and subpatellar discomfort. At clinical examination, Hoffa's sign is difficult to observe but can be highly specific. Extending a bent knee putting pressure on the patellar tendon margins elicits a strong pain, an antalgic block and a defensive behavior of the patient. MRI clearly depicts Hoffa's infrapatellar fat pad and its findings may suggest the frequently ignored diagnosis of Hoffa's syndrome, alone or associated with other local or systemic conditions. This is really important for a complete and correct surgical planning, since the classic anterolateral arthroscopy and arthrotomy never visualize the pad itself and, at any rate, give no information on the possible changes."

CD010778,0,14615847,0,[Surgical therapy of pelvis and spine in primary malignant bone tumors].,"Despite standardization of surgical treatment of primary malignant tumors of the pelvis and spine, prognosis in these centrally located tumors still is inferior compared to those located in the extremities. This fact may be attributed to delayed diagnosis in many cases and the resulting increase in tumor volume as well as to difficulties of resection due to the anatomical situation. The frequency of local recurrence after resection of primary malignant tumors is reported to be between 4 and 41% and the 5-year survival rate below 40%. Whereas the latter has remained almost unchanged during the past 20 years, amputation has been replaced by limb-salvage surgery except for a minimal amount of less than 10%. For reconstruction, biological techniques are increasingly preferred to endoprosthetic replacement or use of bulk allografts because of the high complication rate. Even in the spine wide resections are feasible provided at least one lamina is healthy in order to prepare and save the neural structures without touching the tumor. Compared to the widely used technique of curettage, en bloc resection may provide a significantly better oncologic result with respect to local tumor control. Failure of the dorsoventral stabilization with delayed union is the most frequent complication of these challenging procedures. In order to improve the long-term prognosis of these groups of patients in the future, early diagnosis and immediate admission to a specialized tumor service has to be attempted."

We investigated the MRI features of grafted bone chips and their change over time, and compared them with those with recurrent tumour. We retrospectively reviewed 66 post-operative MRIs from 34 patients who had undergone curettage and grafting with cancellous bone chips to fill the defect after excision of a tumour. All grafts showed consistent features at least six months after grafting: homogeneous intermediate or low signal intensities with or without scattered hyperintense foci (speckled hyperintensities) on T1 images; high signal intensities with scattered hypointense foci (speckled hypointensities) on T2 images, and peripheral rim enhancement with or without central heterogeneous enhancements on enhanced images. Incorporation of the graft occurred from the periphery to the centre, and was completed within three years. Recurrent lesions consistently showed the same signal intensities as those of pre-operative MRIs of the primary lesions. There were four misdiagnoses, three of which were chondroid tumours. We identified typical MRI features and clarified the incorporation process of grafted cancellous allograft bone chips. The most important characteristics of recurrent tumours were that they showed the same signal intensities as the primary tumours.

CD010778,0,26186330,0,Recurrent Metacarpal Enchondroma Treated With Strut Allograft: 14-year Follow-up.,"Enchondroma of the hand is a common lesion with a recurrence rate of up to 13.3% after curettage and bone grafting. Pathologic fractures often occur. Although allograft bone chips are widely used in the surgical treatment of enchondroma, the use of structural allograft bone has not been reported before. This case report presents a recurrent enchondroma of the fifth metacarpal with pathologic fracture in a 13-year-old girl who had 2 previous interventions and 2 more interventions for other enchondromas in the same hand. These interventions consisted of curettage and autogenous iliac crest bone grafting. The metacarpal diaphysis was resected and reconstructed with an intercalary freeze-dried strut allograft fibular bone segment to avoid further donor graft site morbidity. At 14 years of follow-up, the patient had full range of motion of the hand, with no symptoms, and the allograft bone had been incorporated completely, with no recurrence of the tumor. With strut allograft bone, healing occurs by creeping substitution at its ends that is limited to a few millimeters. Limited vascularization also occurs on the allograft surface, leaving most of the allograft segment devoid of vascularity and leading to the complications seen in massive bone allografts. However, because of their thin cortices and decreased total volume, smaller bone allografts show higher rates of osteointegration and revascularization. In selected cases, a strut allograft bone may be considered a suitable material for long-term reconstruction of the hand after enchondroma excision, especially in young patients, who have increased healing potential compared with older patients."
CD010778,0,16799714,0,Fibrocartilaginous dysplasia (fibrous dysplasia with extensive cartilaginous differentiation).,"Fibrocartilaginous dysplasia is a variant of fibrous dysplasia in which extensive cartilaginous differentiation is identified. The amount of cartilage varies from case to case, however, no percentage has been proposed to consider this diagnosis. We present a 6-year-old girl with a two-year history of hip pain. Initial imaging studies of the right femur revealed a lucent lesion of the proximal shaft that extended into the femoral neck with ill-defined borders but well maintained cortex. Computed tomography scan demonstrated increased density of the medullary cavity but the cortex appeared intact. Curettage of the lesion was performed and fragments with cartilaginous appearance were obtained, weighing 45 g in total. Microscopically, the tumor revealed a cartilaginous (60%) and a fibro-osseous (40%) component; the former had increased cellularity and some chondrocytes displayed moderate atypia and binucleation, while the latter showed features of fibrous dysplasia. Areas of endochondral ossification and calcification were also identified. After five years of surgery this child is well and without evidence of recurrence. We discuss the differential diagnosis of this variant of fibrous dysplasia in the pediatric group."
CD010778,0,25665107,0,Resection and reconstruction of pelvic bone tumors.,"The objective of this study was to assess outcome and recurrence rate after limb-salvage surgery with reconstruction for pelvic bone tumors and analyze complications and their relationship with surgery. The authors analyzed 129 patients followed for a mean of 6 years (range, 2-19 years). Chondrosarcoma was the most frequent histotype. Thirty-one cases with no acetabular involvement were reconstructed with allograft only. Acetabular resections were reconstructed with allograft prosthetic composite (n=60), allograft only (n=11), trabecular metal components (n=2), prosthesis only (n=10), saddle prosthesis (n=11), and iliofemoral arthrodesis (n=1). Margins were wide (n=94), wide contaminated (n=22), marginal (n=7), and intralesional (n=6). Oncologic outcomes were as follows: 75 patients were continuously disease free, 6 were disease free after treatment of relapse, 13 were alive with disease, 28 were dead of disease, and 5 were dead of other causes. Survival was 66% at 10 years. Local recurrence rate of malignant tumors was 22.1% and was not statistically influenced by margins (P=.140) or site (P=.933). Metastasis rate was 32.8%. Deep infection was observed in 30 (23.6%) cases, with no statistical difference between reconstructions with and without allograft (P=.09). Final external hemipelvectomy was performed in 16 cases. Newer techniques of reconstruction using stemmed acetabular cups or porous metal components combined with allograft are now available. Local control and satisfactory survival is achievable long term in patients with pelvic tumors, but this surgery implies a high rate of complications. Infection is a major complication, not influenced by the use of allografts. Amputation is rarely needed."

In 126 patients chondromas were located in hand, and in 34 remaining patients (21,3%) in: humerus, forearm, femur, tibia, fibula and foot. The typical signs of enchondroma were: pain, little limitation of movement, thickening of tissues or pathological fracture. 31 patients were operated on. Enchondroma was resected with cutterage, the walls of osseus cavity cleaned with reamer and bone loss filled up with bone grafts or bone cement. 1 case of recurrence of chondroma of toe was noted. In one patent malignant change of chondroma of proximal metaphysis of tibia to chondrosarcoma was observed.

Morphologically, strongly cellular tissue with a closely packed net of osteoid trabeculae containing osteoblasts and a whorl-shaped spindle cell stroma with fibroblasts, fibrocytes, and irregularly scattered multinucleated giant cells of the osteoclast type were observed. After clinical and morphological exclusion of osteosarcoma, enchondroma, non-ossifying fibroma, osteoblastoma, osteoclastoma, and bone cysts the final diagnosis was giant-cell reaction of small tubular bone with unusual marked osteoid formation.

CD010778,0,11127656,0,Total sacrectomy and reconstruction: oncologic and functional outcome.,"The oncologic and functional outcomes of nine patients who were treated by total sacrectomy through L5 (three cases) or L5-S1 (six cases) were reviewed. Histologic diagnoses were one osteosarcoma, two giant cell tumors, two chondrosarcomas, and four chordomas. Patients' ages ranged from 17 to 70 years (mean age, 44.5 years). Resection margins were intralesional (giant cell tumors) in two, marginal in one, and wide in six patients (one contaminated). Reconstruction was performed using polymethylmethacrylate in two, screw and plate fixation in one, and a custom-made device in one. In five patients no reconstruction was performed. Five patients (45.5%) had wound complications: one had a wound dehiscence and two had deep infection; all needed surgical reintervention. In addition, in one a ventral and in another a dorsal hernia developed; only the ventral hernia was revised successfully. One patient had a deep vein thrombosis that was treated with a Coumadin derivate. Three patients (33%) died after 14, 18, and 50 months postoperatively respectively. One died of lung and widespread metastases, and two died of local recurrence and metastases. One patient with a giant cell tumor had a solitary lung metastasis. After resection the patient has been disease-free more than 90 months. At followup, six patients had no evidence of disease (mean followup, 73 months; range, 30-120 months). Functionally, there was no correlation between patients who had a reconstruction and those who had not. Total sacrectomy is a valuable procedure to secure local tumor control and overall survival, despite potential complications and neurologic and sexual dysfunction."

CD010778,0,18521246,0,Chest wall sarcoma: outcome in 22 patients after resection requiring thoracic cage reconstruction.,"Purpose. To evaluate the outcome after resection of malignant chest wall sarcoma, requiring reconstruction of the chest wall.Subjects. Twenty-two patients, 15 with primary tumours, were operated on in our institution between 1983 and 1996. Four patients underwent surgery after a previous intralesional or marginal excision and three patients because of a local recurrence.Methods. The tumour was resected 'en bloc', including skin, muscle and thoracic skeleton. When necessary, adjacent organs invaded by the tumour, such as lung, pericardium and diaphragm, were also removed to obtain a wide margin. Reconstruction of the chest wall was performed with Marlex mesh (n=9), methylmethacrylate cement (n=2) or a Marlex methylmethacrylate 'sandwich' (n=11).Results. The median tumour size was 9.5 (2-20) cm. The most common type of tumour was chondrosarcoma (12 cases). No patient died in hospital. Five patients required reoperation because of complications, two patients because of loosening of the acrylate prosthesis, two because of necrosis of soft tissue coverage and one was reoperated because of bleeding. Four patients died of generalized tumour disease between 5 and 77 months after surgery and one patient died of a local recurrence 32 months after the primary operation. Seventeen patients are alive, with a median follow-up of 36 (4-162) months. Microscopic radicality (negative margin) was achieved in 17 patients but 5 of these had local recurrences. Two of five patients with positive margins had a local recurrence of the tumour. Of the seven patients with local recurrences, two also developed metastases.Discussion. Large chest wall sarcomas can be successfully resected and the chest wall reconstructed with low morbidity and mortality."

In light of literature and what the authors have learned from this case, the authors emphasize stage of the disease as a risk factor for recurrence. The long history of symptoms, calcified and conglomerated radiological appearance of the lesion, and extensive involvement of the joint and periarticular area of this case indicate a late-stage disease in which the metaplastic activity dwindles. For late stages, the authors suggest a conservative approach that will only provide symptom relief and prevent secondary joint deformity to avoid potential complications and morbidities of a more extensive surgery."

Specific operations and their indications are discussed. However, utilizing physical and x-ray examination, arteriography, lymphangiography, and bone scan information, the surgeon may decide that the routine operation is not indicated for a particular tumor problem. He should be able to be flexible and to modify the operation according to the specific presenting problem and not be bound by routine fixed rules. In this way the patient can be assured of the very best treatment."

Among 23 patients with enchondroma and 23 with chondrosarcoma who were treated by intralesional curettage, 3 had local recurrences. The 10-year local recurrence rate was 0.04 in the enchondroma group and 0.09 in the chondrosarcoma group. There were no metastases. The results imply that enchondroma and low-grade chondrosarcoma of the extremities should be treated with limited surgery. The morbidity associated with en bloc resection and reconstruction can apparently be obviated without jeopardizing the limb or survival."

CD010778,0,15918032,0,[Therapy of enchondroma in long bones].,"The treatment of enchondroma in long tubular bones has been the subject of controversial discussions for several years. Whereas secondary malignancy is very rare when the enchondroma is located in a hand, a position near to the trunk represents a high risk of transformation into a chondrosarcoma. For an enchondroma in long tubular bones, authors recommend a whole variety of approaches ranging from regular controls to radical en bloc resection. Between 1989 and 2001 we followed a concept of intralesional resection and cement filling. After an interval without recurrences, the cement was extracted and replaced by a spongiosaplasty. Of 16 patients 12.5% suffered from an intralesional fracture in the course of the treatment, and 25% complained of persistent pain and loss of function after surgery. These complications led us to change our concept. Though there were two cases of secondary transformation into chondrosarcoma G1, we now prefer to keep the patients under close clinical and radiological control without performing surgery."

All patients were examined clinically, followed by an evaluation of their enchondroma of the foot radiographically and an assessment of the outcome of their surgical intervention. The patients' sex and age, enchondroma location, findings from imaging studies such as plain radiography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging, clinical findings, operative findings, and treatment outcomes were recorded. The average postoperative follow-up period was 24 months. Eighty percent of the tumors were located in the proximal phalanx and 14 (70%) patients presented with pathologic fracture. The plain radiographs and computed tomography findings revealed 13 (65%) cases of internal calcification and 11 (55%) with endosteal scalloping. A periosteal reaction was seen only in 4 (20%) cases. Magnetic resonance imaging of 11 (55%) patients showed low T1-weighted and high T2-weighted signal intensity in all cases. Internal septa and nodules with low T2-weighted signal intensity were observed in 9 (82%) out of 11 cases, and adjacent soft tissue edema was noted in 9 (82%). All patients underwent curettage of the tumor and bone grafting as their surgical treatment. No recurrence or postoperative complications were observed during the 24-month follow-up period. Enchondroma of the foot most frequently involves the proximal phalangeal bone and is often associated with pathologic fracture. The unique clinical signs and characteristic radiographic images are easily recognized, making this a relatively easy diagnosis. With appropriate treatment, a good surgical outcome can be expected."

These patients underwent various surgical interventions before the onset of frostbite during similar postoperative care regimens. Surgical procedures included some of the following in each patient: lateral retinacular release, vastus medialis oblique muscle advancement, partial medial meniscectomy, chondromalacia patella, trochlea, medial and lateral femoral condyle debridement, lateral retinaculum release, and excision of medial plica. The mechanism of onset, development, and sites of frostbite were uniform in all patients. In every case, the sites were located in the area on top of the patella including some adjacent regions depending on the size of each injury. Frostbite locations were correlated with the part of the cryotherapy cold cuff device located on top of the patellar region. This cuff portion was originally designed to accommodate surgical trauma induced during autogenous bone-tendon-bone graft harvest in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction surgery. Locating cryotherapy over this region assisted in minimizing pain and effusion for patients subsequent to distal patella bone plug harvest trauma. However, the requirement for use of the pad in the patella area for patients not undergoing anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with autograft was found to be unnecessary and was the primary cause of frostbite in the cases presented here."

CD010778,0,10957883,0,Reconstructive surgery in primary malignant and aggressive benign bone tumor of the proximal humerus.,"Primary malignant bone tumors of the proximal humerus have traditionally been treated by forequarter amputation. However, with the increased interest in limb salvage operations, efforts have been made to improve reconstructive surgery and some methods have become available for tumor control and preservation of a useful distal limb. This report describes three reconstructive techniques used for reconstruction of the humerus following primary tumor excision. We followed 11 patients treated by reconstructive surgery following tumor excision for primary malignant and aggressive benign bone tumors in the proximal humerus. The average follow-up period was 35.6 months. The histologic diagnosis included osteosarcoma (9), chondrosarcoma (1) and giant cell tumor (1). The options for reconstructive surgery following tumor excision were six prosthetic arthroplasties with low heat treated autobone, four arthroplasties with Ender nail and bone cement, and one arthroplasty with custom-made tumor prosthesis. We performed a retrospective analysis regarding functional status, as well as local recurrence, distant metastasis and complication. The functional status at final follow-up averaged 16 points (53.3%) overall: 17 points (56.7%) in the six prosthetic arthroplasties with low heat treated autobone; 15 points (50.0%) in two of four arthroplasties with Ender nail and bone cement (the two others died); and 16 points (53.3%) in the one arthroplasty with custom-made tumor prosthesis. Local recurrence was not observed in any of the cases. The complications noted were one nonunion between reimplanted, low heat treated autobone and the normal distal humerus and two metal failures. Each of these techniques for reconstructive surgery resulted in a relatively good outcome, although somewhat better results were found in the case of prosthetic arthroplasty with low heat treated autobone."

Curettage was less effective in controlling primary malignant lesions than wide excision, and the condition of the resected margin was closely related to the prognosis of the disease. Some patients in the hematopoietic tumor group receiving combined adjuvant therapy survived for a long time. The role of surgery is important in tumors such as chordoma and chondrosarcoma that have low sensitivity to adjuvant therapy, and it is essential to secure tumor-free resected margins."

CD010778,0,28853588,0,Malignant bone tumours of the foot.,"Introduction Malignant osseous foot tumours are uncommon. Their oncological outcomes have been poorly documented in the literature so far. The aim of this study was to establish the incidence and to evaluate the oncological outcomes of such patients. Methods Our large orthopaedic oncology database was used to review 70 malignant osseous foot tumour patients. Results The age at diagnosis of malignant osseous foot tumours demonstrated a bimodal distribution peaking in the second and eighth decades of life. Overall, 55 primary malignant bone tumours of the foot (79%) were identified. The median duration from onset of symptoms to diagnosis was 52 weeks (interquartile range [IQR]: 17-104). Eight primary tumours (15%) underwent an accidental excision (ie intralesional excision of a malignant bone tumour where some of the tumour has been left behind, also known as a 'whoops procedure') prior to referral to our unit. Forty-six patients (84%) underwent surgery overall and thirteen of these developed recurrence or metastases. Seven of eight patients with a previous accidental excision underwent amputation. Fifteen osseous metastatic foot lesions were identified. The median length of foot symptoms to diagnosis was 24 weeks (IQR: 20-36 weeks). The median time to death following diagnosis of osseous foot metastases was 20.1 months (IQR: 11.3-27.8 months). Conclusions A high index of suspicion and awareness of clinical features of malignant osseous foot tumours are both essential to avoid diagnostic delays. Amputation is associated with a respectable outcome for patients who have undergone previous accidental excisions."
CD010778,0,20803012,1,Low-grade chondrosarcoma of bone: experiences from the Vienna Bone and Soft Tissue Tumour Registry.,"In a retrospective single-centre study, 70 low-grade chondrosarcoma (LCS) (31 female/39 male patients with a mean age of 40 years) were reviewed to evaluate surgical management. The mean overall follow-up was 81 months (median: 73 months, range: 6-317 months). Seventeen lesions (24.3%) in the trunk and 53 (75.7%) in the extremities were treated by curettage (48.6%) or resection (51.5%). Local recurrence occurred in eight patients (11.4%) 18 months postoperatively (median: 18 months, range: 0-41 months). Recurrence-free survival was significantly better for patients with extremity lesions compared to truncal lesions, but was not affected by resection margin. The anatomical site ""trunk"" and an ""intralesional"" resection margin had a significant independent prognostic influence in multivariate analysis. Curettage with local adjuvants is a viable treatment option for most extremity LCS. In truncal LCS wide resection is recommended despite a potentially higher complication rate."
CD010778,0,11812046,0,Two freezing cycles ensure interface sterilization by cryosurgery during bone tumor resection.,"Cryosurgery utilizing an argon-based system allows bone-tumor interface sterilization, while avoiding the risks of conventional cryosurgery. This study was conducted in order to evaluate the number of freezing cycles required for interface sterilization in cases of aggressive human bone tumors. Sixteen tumors were included (six chondrosarcomas, eight metastatic carcinomas, and two giant cell tumors). All occurred within long bones. In all cases a standardized marginal resection was performed. Following thorough curettage, we sampled five different locations within the tumor interface by a cylindrical hollow trephine. The interface viability was assessed using the XTT method. Quantitative histological evaluation was based on the percentage of live cells divided by total lacunae number in five random medium-power fields. One freezing cycle (5 min, -40 degrees C) reduced tumor viability to approximately 5% of prefreezing. However, there were still live specimens. Two or three freezing cycles led to complete interface sterilization. The difference between a single freezing cycle and two freezing cycles was significant (ANOVA, F = 130, P < 0.01). The difference between two freezing cycles and three freezing cycles was not significant (ANOVA, F = 0.14, P < 0.6). The results of the XTT method for the assessment of interface viability correlated well with histological evaluation of the percentage of viable cells (r = 0.89), as well as with cell culture results of frozen vs. prefreezing tumor samples. In conclusion, two freezing cycles are adequate to achieve tumor-bone interface sterilization in aggressive human bone tumors."

Review of the literature shows that the diagnosis, essentially based on X-ray examination, bone-scan and arthrography, needs to be confirmed by histological examination. Treatment must be surgical and must be carried out as soon as possible to prevent arthrosis. Surgery should include thorough excision of the synovial membrane and a curettage of the acetabular fossa to avoid recurrence. Under these conditions, prognosis appears to be excellent."

CD010778,0,16056051,0,Lateral malleolus en bloc resection and ankle reconstruction for malignant tumors.,"Four children and six adults required en bloc resection of the lateral malleolus for malignant tumors. There were four osteosarcomas, three chondrosarcomas, two Ewing's sarcomas, and one adamantinoma. Surgical margins were wide in seven patients, marginal in two, and intralesional in one. A primary ankle arthrodesis was done in four adults and bracing without any reconstruction was done in four children and two adults. During a mean followup of 14.5 years (range, 3-30 years), there were two local recurrences (two of 10 patients) after a marginal excision and an intralesional excision. One patient had reoperation for a skip osteosarcoma lesion in the proximal fibula. Other complications included chronic osteomyelitis, a lateral talus subluxation and cavovarus deformity, and recurrent ankle instability and degenerative changes of the ankle. At the latest followup, all 10 patients showed no evidence of disease. Five patients who had primary or late ankle arthrodesis had a Musculoskeletal Tumor Society and International Society of Limb Salvage functional score of 28 points (92%), and two adolescents who had postoperative bracing alone had a functional score of 24 points (80%). The three remaining patients had a salvage amputation."

CD010778,0,16826117,0,Survivorship analysis in patients with periosteal chondrosarcoma.,"To investigate outcome and identify prognostic factors, we retrospectively reviewed 24 consecutive patients with periosteal chondrosarcomas. There were 17 males and seven females with a mean age of 37.6 years (range, 15-73 years). The femur was involved in 12 patients, the proximal humerus in five, the tibia in two, and the distal fibula, ilium, pubis, metatarsal, and rib in one patient each. The mean greatest dimension of the lesions was 8.1 cm (range, 1.5-27 cm). Based on the histologic pattern, there were 18 Grade 1 tumors and six Grade 2 tumors. All patients were treated surgically. Two patients had intralesional excisions, five patients had marginal excisions, and 17 patients had wide resections. With a mean followup of 17 years (range, 28 months-47 years), seven of 24 patients (29%) had one or more local recurrences. The 5-year local recurrence-free survival was less in patients treated with intralesional or marginal excisions (25%) than for patients treated with wide resections (93%). At the latest followup, six of 24 patients (25%) had died of pulmonary metastases. The overall 5-year metastasis-free survival was 83%. The 5-year metastasis-free survival was less for patients with Grade 2 tumors (50%) than for patients with Grade 1 tumors (94%)."
CD010778,0,22512102,0,[Enchondroma of the distal phalanx].,"Enchondroma is the most frequent benign tumor in hand bones. It occasionally occurs in the distal phalanx of the fingers; it is usually an asymptomatic lesion, but pain may occur when it is associated with a fracture. The most recommended treatment is lesion curettage and application of a bone graft, besides fixation as needed. Five cases with location in the distal phalanx are reported, as well as treatment results from January 1978 to May 2010. Of the 5 patients, 4 were females and one was male. The most frequently affected digit was the middle finger followed by the little finger. The most frequent symptom at the time of diagnosis was pain. Lesion curettage was performed in all cases, with the use of an autologous distal radius bone graft in 4 and coralline graft in one. Mean follow-up was 193 months (2-384 months).

CD010778,0,16498237,0,Chondrosarcoma of the ring finger: a case report and review of the literature.,"Enchondromas are the most common benign cartilaginous bone tumors arising in the medullary cavity of the small bones of the hand. In contrast, chondrosarcomas, commonly occurring in the pelvis and proximal femur and humerus, are very uncommon at this site. We report an unusual case of chondrosarcoma arising in the ring finger proximal phalanx with its radiological and histological features and reviewed the literature. The patient was an 80-year-old man whose chief complaint was swelling and pain for seven years. The findings of cortical irregular thickening by plain radiography and computed tomography and soft tissue extension by magnetic resonance imaging suggested the tumor was chondrosarcoma rather than a common enchondroma. Thorough curettage and artificial bone grafting was performed because of the age of the patient, his senile dementia and the strong desire of the patient and his family. Histological examination revealed that the tumor was composed of polygonal cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm proliferating in the chondromatous matrix with partially myxoid changes. Nuclear irregularity, binucleated cells, bone permeation and encasement were observed and the tumor was diagnosed as grade 2 chondrosarcoma. The tumor recurred five months after surgery. Amputation of the ring finger including the distal part of the 4th metacarpal was performed. At two years after surgery, the patient was free from recurrence or lung metastasis. In conclusion, details of radiological as well as pathological findings are essential for differential diagnosis between benign enchondroma and chondrosarcoma in the hand. Chondrosarcoma of the hand requires a prompt and more radical treatment than enchondroma. Wide excision is recommended to avoid local recurrence or metastasis."
CD010778,0,3452611,0,Chondrosarcoma of the bones of the hand.,"The authors report two cases of phalangeal chondrosarcoma treated by carpometacarpal disarticulation of the affected finger. In both cases chondroma had been diagnosed histologically at previous operations consisting of curettage and homoplastic grafting. The cases subsequently came under our observation because of recurrences and an analysis of the clinical and radiographic course, together with a critical review of the previous histological preparation (in one case) led us to conclude that these neoplasms presented malignant features from the beginning and were not due to the sarcomatous degeneration of benign chondromas. The recent literature on this difficult differential diagnosis is reviewed."
CD010778,0,6950821,0,A 17-year review of cryosurgery in the treatment of bone tumors.,"Depending on size of the lesion, cryosurgery may be effective (as it is in other fields of oncology surgery) in reducing the morbidity of en bloc excision. For benign lesions, cryosurgery may lessen the extent of curettage and, therefore, the need for autologous iliac bone grafts. Cryosurgery also reduces the local recurrence rate, and, probably because of devitalization of tumor cells, lessens the rate of malignant degeneration and metastases. The lower rate of malignant degeneration in giant cell tumor is dramatic and statistically significant when compared to curettage+/- phenol washings. In addition, good functional results are compelling reasons for cryosurgery in preference to other methods of reducing tumor burden. Radiation may be avoided as, for example, in aneurysmal bone cysts. The need for supplementary radiation therapy, i.e., 3500 rads, is substantially lessened, and, therefore, may eliminate the possibility of secondary radiation sarcoma."
CD010778,0,3164179,0,[Limb salvage surgery for pelvic malignancies followed by reconstruction with hip endoprosthesis].,"Between 1983 and 1987, nine patients with pelvic malignancy were treated with limb salvage surgery and preoperative chemotherapy. They were 6 males and 3 females, ranging in age from 13 to 73. There were 4 chondrosarcomas, 3 osteosarcomas and 2 Ewing's sarcomas. Seven patients received preoperative chemotherapy mainly consisting of adriamycin and cis-platinum. The remaining 2 patients with Ewing's sarcoma received T-11 protocol by Rosen. Surgical margins were wide but partially marginal in 6 patients and intra-lesional in 3 patients. Reconstruction with hip endoprosthesis fixed with screws and bone cement in the sacrum was performed after whole involved iliac bone was resected. Local recurrence was detected in one patient with osteosarcoma treated by marginal resection and 2 patients treated by intralesional resection. Complications occurred in 5 patients. Dislocation was observed in the first patient in this series. Other complications were infection in one patient, sciatic nerve palsy in one patient and leg length shortening in 2 patients. One patient walks without crutches, 5 patients with them. One patient uses a wheelchair and 2 patients are on bed rest. Four patients survived with no evidence of disease for 8-51 months (average 25 months). Two patients have survived with disease for 11-16 months (average 14 months).

CD010778,0,2630928,0,[Strategy of the surgical treatment of primary tumors of the spine].,"The surgical treatment of the primary spinal tumors is started after the analysis of the following data: --location of the tumor, --pathological identification after the biopsy examination, --staging of the lesion according to Enneking. In case of benign tumors it is possible to realize: a total resection by morcellement until healthy margins in case of chondroma or osteochondroma, intralesional excision until healthy borders in case of osteoid osteoma, total excision by partial anterior or posterior vertebrectomy (with previously embolization) according to the location (body or neural arch resection) in case of giant cells tumour or aneurysmal bone cyst. In case of malignant tumors, the total resection is an absolute goal when the feasability occurs (total vertebrectomy), in case of chordoma, chondrosarcoma and malignant giant cells tumours; the stabilization surgery is indicated without attempt of total tumor removal because others means are availables and/or accurates (radio and/or chemotherapy) in cases of Ewing's sarcoma, plasmocytoma and lymphoma."

A retrospective review was made of 30 consecutive patients (12 male, 18 female) with a mean age of 40.7 years (range: 16-69 years) with intramedullary low-grade chondrosarcoma of the long bones treated either by intralesional curettage or wide resection at our institution between 1995 and 2011. The mean overall follow-up was 74 months (range : 24-186 months). There was no difference in local recurrence rates between patients treated with intralesional resection or wide resection (p = 0.98). Intralesional curettage seems to be feasible in selected cases to reduce the patient's postoperative morbidity in Grade I chondrosarcoma cases."
CD010778,0,1253484,0,Management of patellar subluxation. A modification of Hauser's technique.,"Patellar subluxation is one of the most common causes of internal derangement of the knee in young individuals. Most surgical techniques mandate entrance into the knee joint and require prolonged postoperative immobilization. The result may be excessive postoperative synovitis and occasionally, hemarthrosis. Prolonged postoperative immobilization results in joint stiffness. The authors propose a modification of Hauser's technique which allows tailored correction of the abnormal vector forces applied to the patella, simple adjustment of the tension in the extensor mechanism, creates patellar stability, and permits rapid return of knee motion. A new tibial corticocancellous window is created in a manner similar to Hauser's technique. The cancellous defect is deepened by curettage and the transferred tibial tubercle is then inverted, inserted through the window, and tamped into the graft bed thereby gradually increasing tension in the tendon. The cancellous and cortical bone from the window is then tamped in behind the patella tendon, buttressing the tendon, and permitting the knee a full unguarded range of motion on the operating table. In 23 operations in 22 patients, with a follow-up of 35.4 months and a mean patient age of 18.7 years, all patellae were stable. All but one patient achieved full range of motion. Younger patients with minimal or absent preoperative patellofemoral chondromalacia had uniformly good results."

CD010778,0,22385450,0,Chondrosarcomas revisited.,"Chondrosarcomas are malignant bone tumors with pure hyaline cartilage differentiation; myxoid changes, calcification, or ossification may be present. Several subtypes of chondrosarcomas exist. Behavior patterns vary, ranging from slow-growing nonmetastasizing lesions to aggressive metastasizing sarcomas. Symptoms are usually mild, with duration ranging from several months to years, and usually consist of persistent, dull, aching pain or palpable masses. Radiographic findings include bone expansion with cortical thickening, radiolucent areas with variably distributed punctate or ring-like matrix calcifications, cortical erosion or destruction, endosteal scalloping, and scant or absent periosteal reaction; extension into the soft tissue may be present. Histological differential diagnosis from benign cartilaginous lesions can be achieved by increased cellularity, enlarged plump nuclei, binucleated cells, hyperchromatic nuclear pleomorphism, and permeation of cortical or medullary bone. Atypia is usually mild to moderate; necrosis and mitoses can be seen, particularly in high-grade lesions. Adequate surgery is the mainstay of treatment. High-grade and pelvic chondrosarcomas are best managed with wide resection. Because of the low metastatic potential and low local recurrence rate noted with intralesional surgery, low-grade chondrosarcomas can be treated with curettage (with or without treatment of the defect cavity) with a local adjuvant, such as phenol or cryotherapy. Adjuvant chemotherapy may be considered for mesenchymal and dedifferentiated chondrosarcomas. Radiation therapy can be considered after incomplete resection or if resection is not feasible or would cause unacceptable morbidity."

The extent of surgery remains controversial, as some advocate resection and others favor local treatment by curettage. Because of the low prevalence of ACT/CS1, the available data are limited and generally not uniform.

CD010778,0,11153986,0,Extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma.,"The medical records and histologic material of 16 patients with extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma were reviewed. The mean age of the patients was 52 years. Thirteen tumors arose in the lower extremity. Thirteen patients presented with primary, localized disease, whereas three presented with pulmonary metastases. Treatment of the primary site included wide excision or amputation in 13 patients and marginal or intralesional resections with radiation in three patients. The mean followup was 7.4 years. Five patients were continuously disease free (5- and 10-year event free survival 43% and 14%, respectively). Local recurrence developed in four, and metastases developed in six of 13 patients presenting with localized disease. Of six patients who received chemotherapy for systemic disease, four had disease progression and died, and two had a response to chemotherapy (one partial, one complete). The mean survival after onset of metastases was 45 months. Overall 5- and 10-year survival was 87% and 63%, respectively. The current series suggests that extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma is an intermediate-grade neoplasm with a tendency toward recurrence and metastasis. Survival after relapse may be prolonged.

In this series, CMFs were found in patients of all age groups, with no predominance between sexes. Long bone tumors were more common in young patients, while small and flat bone lesions were more common in older patients. Radiographically, long, flat, and small bone lesions were well-defined and benign-appearing. Tumors in the vertebrae had a more aggressive appearance, with marked bone destruction. The histologic picture was of a pseudolobulated tumor with myxoid and chondroid regions. Tumor cells were at times bizarre, pleomorphic, and binucleate, but rarely contained mitoses. Curettage with or without bone grafting and en bloc resection were the most common modes of treatment. The majority of recurrences were seen in patients treated by curettage alone. Radiation therapy was associated with the development of sarcoma in one case. No cases of malignant transformation were found in this series, but unusually aggressive recurrences were noted in CMFs involving a phalanx, the cervical vertebra, and the sacrum."

In 31 patients phenol was applied to the wall of the bone cavity after this had been carefully curetted or fraised. The chemical cauterization effect is intended to destroy any remaining tumor cell remnants. The cavity is then filled with autologous or homologous spongiosa. In a total of 72 nonphenolized bone cavities there were 21 recurrences (29.1%).

Routine examination and radiographs revealed a benign lytic neoplasm in the base of the ring metacarpal. The primary treatment consisted of curettage and cancellous bone grafting. The biopsy diagnosis was chondroblastoma. The patient is asymptomatic and has a normal radiograph after a follow-up period of one year.

The patient was a 16-year-old boy who had been diagnosed as having multiple exostosis from 9 years of age. He experienced an increasing abdominal tumor mass that formed a huge tumor. Although marginal resection of the tumor was attempted, intraperitoneal dissemination was caused by rupture of the tumor capsule and the peritoneum, as a result of severe tumor adhesion to the peritoneum. During the 5 years after the initial operation, local recurrences occurred seven times in various areas of the intra- or retro-peritoneum and marginal or intralesional excision was performed every time for a total of 14 tumors. However, since the seventh operation, the patient has had no evidence of recurrence or metastasis of the disease for more than 10 years. Therefore, we considered that the cancer might have spontaneously regressed."

The use of phenol was supported by an in vitro study, the use of bone cement by clinical studies. A consensus has been growing that this type of tumours should be treated less aggressively. The average age of the patients was 445 years (range: 29 to 71). The mean follow-up period was 6.2 years (range: 2.5 to 11 years). After 6 months the average Musculoskeletal Tumor Society (MSTS) score was 76.8% of 30, the best possible score (range: 61% to 87%). After 12 months this score increased to 89.8% (range: 63% to 100%). Complications were: one recurrence (43%), treated with a tumour prosthesis, and 3 fractures (13%). The authors strongly support this new technique, all the more as it still allows for a more radical approach, if necessary.

CD010778,0,15275690,0,Benign and malignant cartilage tumors of the hand.,Primary bone tumors of the hand and wrist are unusual but if present are frequently chondrogenic in origin. Enchondroma is the most common primary bone tumor of the hand and can be treated by curettage and bone grafting. Chondrosarcoma is rare and most likely the result of malignant degeneration of a pre-existing lesion. Wide en bloc resection is appropriate for chondrosarcoma and typically involves ray resection or partial hand amputation.
CD010778,0,12769010,0,Solitary enchondromas: is radiographic follow-up sufficient in patients with asymptomatic lesions?,"Enchondromas are benign cartilaginous tumours and rarely transform into chondrosarcomas. Curettage is usually performed, and a low rate of complications is assumed. We analysed retrospectively data from 73 patients with enchondromas treated by curettage with respect to symptoms, therapy, complications and recurrences. All patients were treated by curettage of the tumour, in most cases followed by cancellous bone grafting. Twenty-three percent of the patients presented a complication. There were two recurrences but no malignant transformations in the follow-up period. During the same time period 29 patients with chondrosarcomas were treated, including two secondary chondrosarcomas. One had a recurrence of a benign enchondroma of the metacarpal and developed a pulmonary metastasis from a chondrosarcoma. The other was a patient with Ollier's disease who had a secondary chondrosarcoma of the radius. Malignant transformation of a solitary enchondroma to a chondrosarcoma is rare. On the other hand the complication rate of enchondroma curettage is considerable. Regular radiological follow-up of asymptomatic enchondromas may therefore be the better option."
CD010778,0,17560488,0,Endoscopically assisted excision of digital enchondroma.,"We present 2 cases of endoscopically assisted curettage of enchondroma of the hand. After initial open curettage of the lesion, a 1.9-mm arthroscope was introduced through a small cortical window. Under arthroscopic guidance, residual pathologic material was freed from the cavity wall and evacuated with the aid of repeated saline lavage combined with suction. The saline was injected through an 18-gauge angiocatheter under direct endoscopic control. The endoscope was then used to observe the filling of the cavity with demineralized bone matrix (DBX; Synthes [USA], Paoli, PA). We believe that endoscopically assisted curettage presents several advantages over open curettage alone. First, direct visualization of the medullary canal permits accurate assessment of the extent of the enchondroma. Second, the endoscope permits accurate assessment of the adequacy of the curettage, thus avoiding the need to perform multiple, blind, and aggressive passes with a curette. Multiple passes can increase the risk of violation of the cortical shell and can prolong the procedure. Third, the ability to completely clear the medullary canal of all tumors should logically reduce the rate of recurrence. In conclusion, the addition of an endoscope is an inexpensive modification that promises to save time, decrease morbidity, and possibly improve long-term outcomes."

The minimum followup was 2 years (range, 24-103 months). There were 6 giant cell tumors and a single case each of chondroblastoma, chondrosarcoma, and fibrosarcoma in the study group. Six lesions involved the distal femur and 3 the proximal tibia. Functional outcomes were graded according to the Enneking Modified System for the Functional Evaluation of Tumor and The Knee Rating Scale of The Hospital for Special Surgery. All lesions extended to within 2 mm of the articular surface. Local tumor control was achieved in 8 patients (89%). The single local recurrence was successfully managed with repeat curettage, cryosurgery, cementation, and internal fixation. All 9 patients had excellent functional outcomes according to both evaluation scales."
CD010778,0,11953605,0,Relationship between surgical margins and local recurrence in sarcomas of the spine.,"The combination of improved resection, stabilization, and fusion techniques allows for more aggressive removal of malignant spinal tumors with acceptable mortality and morbidity. Thirty consecutive patients with primary sarcomas of the mobile spine, who were operated on at the authors' institution from January 1970 to December 2000, were included in the current study. Demographic information, tumor location, type of resection, resection margins, local recurrence, and overall survival data were retrieved and analyzed. Treatment consisted of en bloc resection in 12 patients (40%) and piecemeal resections in 18 patients (60%). The resection was classified as wide in seven patients (23.3%), marginal in three patients (10%), and intralesional in 20 patients (66.7%). Pathology reports showed tumor-free resection margins in 12 patients (40%). In the remaining 18 patients (60%), resection margins were positive and resulted in a fivefold increase in the risk of a local recurrence. Ninety-two percent of the patients with local recurrence died of sequelae associated with the local recurrence. Primary sarcomas of the mobile spine in certain cases, can be removed completely with tumor-free resection margins. En bloc resection with tumor-free margins provides substantial improvement in overall survival."

Grade 1 chondrosarcomas have little or no metastatic potential and are often difficult to distinguish from painful benign enchondromas. Curettage with adjuvant cryosurgery has been proposed as an alternative therapy for Grade 1 chondrosarcomas given the generally better function after the procedure. However, because it is an intralesional procedure, curettage and cryosurgery may be associated with higher rates of recurrence."

CD010778,0,19431126,0,Circumferential total resection of cervical tumors: report of two consecutive cases and technical note.,"To date, few studies have addressed the subaxial vertebrectomy technique and related anatomical landmarks in this method. Total spondylectomy is performed via piecemeal resection or en bloc removal in a one-stage procedure associated with stabilizing the spine and preserving neurological status. In this presentation, a circumferential total cervical tumor resection for subaxial cervical spine lesions was described. Two cases of subaxial cervical malignancy, one with primary C3 chondrosarcoma and the other with C4 lung adenosarcoma metastasis, were both treated by the anterior-posterior approach. The lesions could be removed macroscopically totally in both cases. The patients did well after surgery with preserved neurological status and they survived a considerable period without tumor recurrence. Subaxial total tumor resection can be performed safely while preserving vertebral arteries with adequate anatomical knowledge and careful surgical planning, and circumferential vertebrectomy (even intralesional) can provide a long recurrence-free survival period for patients suffering from subaxial spine tumors."

We retrospectively reviewed 23 patients with such defects treated with a vacuum-assisted wound closure system and compared the outcome of these patients with a control group. The study group included 15 women and eight men who had their wounds located at the back (two), pelvic girdle (11), thigh (eight), and leg (two). Treatment included sealed wound coverage with polyurethane foam and overlying tape connected to a vacuum pump. This system was disconnected and changed every 48 hours for 7 to 19 days, after which all defects were reduced in size by an average of 25% and covered with a viable granulation tissue. This allowed primary closure in seven patients, primary closure with skin grafting in 14 patients, and healing by secondary intention in two patients. Compared with the control group, patients in the study group had shorter hospital stays and number of surgical interventions and greater rates of primary wound closure. The use of vacuum-assisted wound closure facilitates wound healing and primary wound closure in patients who have a large soft tissue defect after resection of a musculoskeletal tumor."

We describe the history of the technique and the issues associated with cryobiology, as well as the indications, technique, complications, and results of cryosurgery. At the University Medical Centre Nijmegen, Netherlands, 302 tumours have been treated by use of cryosurgery with at least 2 years' follow-up. 96-100% of patients were cured-the response depended on tumour type. Comparison of functional results with data from studies shows that these results concur with other studies on cryosurgery, and are at least equal to results of marginal excision and mostly better than those of wide excisions of grade 1 chondrosarcomas. Thus from an oncological point of view, cryosurgery combined with intralesional excision is equal to marginal excision."
CD010778,0,15558292,0,Clear cell chondrosarcoma of the proximal femur with intrapelvic extension.,"Clear cell chondrosarcoma is a rare tumor that can be easily confused with benign tumors. The aim of this report is to present a case that is rare, initially diagnosed as aneurysmal bone cyst and then chondroblastoma, and has an interesting extension pattern. A 41-year-old male patient was treated for an apparently benign cystic lesion of the right proximal femur by intralesional excision and bone grafting. The pathological diagnosis was aneurysmal bone cyst. Two years later, the patient presented with a pathological fracture at the same site and a total hip arthroplasty was performed. The pathological specimen was diagnosed as chondroblastoma. Three years later, clinical and radiological examination of the patient revealed a large mass located on the intrapelvic side of the acetabulum. There was no evidence of distant metastases. Both tumors were resected with a wide margin on the femoral side and a marginal margin on the intrapelvic side. The extremity was reconstructed with a resection-type total hip prosthesis. Again, the pathological diagnosis was chondroblastoma. The patient developed a deep infection that was treated by antibiotic therapy and surgical debridement. One year later, there was recurrence of the femoral and intrapelvic masses and right hemipelvectomy was performed; the specimen was reported as clear cell chondrosarcoma. Since then, the patient has been leading an active life, and there is no evidence of local recurrence or distant metastasis. Clinically and pathologically, clear cell chondrosarcoma may be confused with benign bone tumors. This caused a delay in the final diagnosis of this patient and he received inadequate surgical treatment, leading to a hemipelvectomy. We also found that the intrapelvic mass seemed to have developed independently on the intrapelvic side of the acetabulum. We were unable to find an exact explanation for this finding and postulated that tumor cells might have been seeded into the inner wall of the acetabulum during acetabular preparation of the total hip prosthesis."

Twelve patients underwent surgical procedures consisting of intralesional resection in 6, marginal resection in 3, and wide margin resection in 3. Six of the 7 patients with sacral invasion developed local recurrence.

Sternoclavicular joints are the only true joints connecting the axial skeleton to the upper extremity. Therefore, they play an important role in shoulder function. However, data on their reconstruction are lacking. Here, we described the case of a sternal reconstruction including both sternoclavicular joints using a mesh-bone cement sandwich. The mechanical properties of the construct mimicked those of the original sternoclavicular joints and could therefore restore shoulder strength allowing the patient to perform overhead work."
CD010778,0,8685092,0,[Histologic grading of chondrosarcoma. A qualitative and quantitative analysis of 74 cases of the Hamburg bone tumor register].,"Chondrosarcomas are frequent malignant bone tumors. Aside from different subtypes, such as dedifferentiated, mesenchymal and clear-cell chondrosarcoma, chondrosarcomas (classical chondrosarcoma) show different grades of differentiation. The borderline between chondroma and classical chondrosarcoma is not clearly defined. The same chondrosarcoma can be graded differently at different institutes. Standardized therapy concepts are currently in preparation. As the Hamburg Bone Tumor Registry is often consulted for chondrogenic tumors, the histological criteria are based on a series of 74 chondrosarcomas recorded there. The emphasis has been laid on a classification which can be used in daily routine and which is reproducible and in agreement with the classifications of other international groups. Grade I chondrosarcomas (50%) can be distinguished only by growth criteria. The nuclei are small and show high chromatin density. Grade II chondrosarcomas (42%) have medium-sized, regular nuclei with loose chromatin structure. The chondrocytes of grade III cases (8%) show polymorphic nuclei. Binucleas forms, the number of mitoses and cellularity all show considerable overlap for all three grades. So far there are no immunohistological and molecular biological methods for reliable differentiation. The therapeutic consequences of the classification into grades are thorough curettage, in the case of grade I tumors, or complete resection, for grade II and III cases. The long-term results, however, need to be confirmed by a larger number of cases. From 1991 to 1995 the method was applied and proved to be easily practicable in daily diagnostic routine. Some 104 cases of classical chondrosarcomas (grade I 53%, grade II 39%, grade III 8%) were analyzed. Two pathologists both assigned the same grade in 90% of cases."

CD010778,0,11501820,0,Patellar tumors.,"Pain in the anterior knee has become synonymous with patella chondromalacia. However, pain also is the first sign of a tumor of the patella. Tumors of the patella are rare, but they often are mistaken for other benign lesions. Benign tumors of the patella are more frequent than malignant tumors (73% versus 27%). The most common benign neoplasms are giant cell tumor and chondroblastoma. Margin of the lesion, cortical involvement, trabecular pattern, and type of the matrix are important features for a radiographic diagnosis. Bone scans, computed tomography scans, and magnetic resonance images are used for staging of the tumor before surgery. Curettage only should be considered for patients with Stage 1 or Stage 2 benign lesions. Patellectomy is indicated for patients with Stage 3 aggressive benign tumors and for patients with Stage IA malignant tumors. A patellectomy with excision of involved soft tissues is used in patients with Stage IB tumors, whereas in patients with Stage IIA tumors, an extensive patellectomy is indicated. In patients with Stage IIB tumors, an extraarticular resection of the knee is preferred when there is a small soft tissue involvement, but amputation is necessary when there is a large soft tissue mass."
CD010778,0,22217402,0,"The many faces of chondrosarcoma of bone, own cases and review of the literature with an emphasis on radiology, pathology and treatment.","Chondrosarcoma is the third most frequent primary malignant tumor of bone, constituting up to 16% of the malignant osseous neoplasms. Up to date several genetic alterations and markers were described concerning the pathogenesis and the progression of the chondrosarcoma, which represents actually a heterogeneous group of different types including conventional intramedullary, clear cell, myxoid, mesenchymal, and dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma. The pathologic appearance varies, however, in general they grow with a lobulated pattern. Histologically the hyaline cartilage demonstrates high water content and typically enchondral ossification is apparent. Imaging reflect this while radiographic findings suggest the diagnosis when the typical ""ring-and-arc"" chondroid matrix mineralization, endosteal scalloping and soft-tissue extension were apparent. The CT is used for detecting the mineralization of the matrix, especially when it is subtle or when the lesion is located in complex areas. MRT is the method of choice to detect the high water content of these lesions with a high signal intensity with T2-weighting and its bone marrow extend. Surgical resection is the primary and preferred treatment modality for most individuals with localized disease. In selected cases of the Grad I conventional chondrosarcoma curettage should be discussed. Systemic chemotherapy may be considered in variant forms such as mesenchymal or dedifferentiated chondrosarcomas. In knowledge of the ""many faces"" of the primary chondrosarcoma individualized patient assessment and optimal clinical management is possible."
CD010778,0,18855011,0,Grade I chondrosarcoma of bone: the Münster experience.,"The surgical treatment of low-grade chondrosarcoma is controversial and the clinical course is difficult to predict. The purpose of this retrospective study was to review the authors' experience with the surgical treatment of 80 patients with grade I chondrosarcoma. Intralesional resection margins increased the rate of local recurrence statistically significant (p < 0.001). However, there was no influence of the resection margins on the overall survival (p > 0.05) or on the rate of metastasis (p > 0.05). Conservative surgery for special indications with adjuvant use of PMMA (poly-methylmethacrylate) offers satisfying local tumour control rates in the long bones. However, after intralesional tumour resection of pelvic chondrosarcoma, four out of four patients developed a local recurrence, whereas no patient treated with wide resection margins received a local relapse, which has been statistically significant (p < 0.001). In conclusion, intralesional resection of a grade I chondrosarcoma has a higher overall risk of local recurrence but is not associated with a poorer survival. This procedure can be recommended for stage I A tumours of the long bones of the extremities. However, in pelvic lesions it should be avoided because of a 100% recurrence rate."
CD010778,0,10427806,0,Conservative surgery for chondrosarcoma of the first metacarpal bone.,"A rare case of a chondrosarcoma of the first metacarpal bone is presented. The lesion was radiographically interpreted initially as an enchondroma and treated conventionally by curettage and cancellous autologous bone grafting. After final histology, a low-grade chondrosarcoma was reported. A resection of the entire first metacarpal bone was performed, followed by reconstruction using an autologous corticocancellous bone graft and plate fixation, creating arthrodeses of the adjacent joints. Although isolated enchondromas are considered to have no malignant potential, histological examination is essential to rule out malignancy. A preoperative biopsy should be recommended in lesions suspected to be chondromas. Chondrosarcomas are rarely located in bones of the hand, where they are usually treated by amputation. With the case presented we wish to advocate that cases of low-grade, intraosseous chondrosarcoma (stage IA) can be treated by conservative surgery, especially when it is located in the thumb."

Intralesional resection can minimize the damage caused by surgery and offer better functional outcome. However, controversy remains about whether it will result in higher rates of local recurrence and metastasis, fewer complications, and better functional outcome compared with resection with wide margin. This systematic review and updated meta-analysis therefore compared intralesional resection and resection with wide margin in terms of local recurrence, metastasis, complications, and functional outcome."

Our surgical procedure for reconstruction included (1) wide en bloc resection of the tumor; (2) curettage of tumor from the resected bone; (3) autoclaving for 8 minutes (4) bone grafting from the fibula (both vascularized and nonvascularized fibular grafts used); (5) reimplantation of the autoclaved bone into the host bone defect and fixation with plates. Functional evaluation was done using MSTS scoring system. At final followup of at least 18 months (mean 29.2 months), 31 patients had recovered without any complications. Thirty-eight patients successfully achieved a solid bony union between the graft and recipient bone. Three patients had surgical site infection. They were managed with wound debridement and flap coverage of the defect. Local recurrence and nonunion occurred in two patients each. One patient underwent disarticulation at hip due to extensive local disease and one died of metastasis. For patients with non-union, revision procedure with bone graft and compression plates was successfully used. The use of autoclaved tumor grafts provides a limb salvage option that is inexpensive and independent of external resources and is a viable option for musculoskeletal tumor management in developing countries."

However, there has no consensus been reached regarding the surgical intervention timing for these patients. We aim to evaluate the optimal surgical intervention timing for the patients with fractures due to enchondromas, investigate the impact of pathological fractures on the treatment and outcomes in these patients.Medical records and X-rays of patients treated for enchondroma of the hand from 2005 to 2015 were retrospectively reviewed. We collected 148 cases in total and 92 of them had complete information including X-rays, medical records, and files of follow up.There were no significant differences in terms of consolidation time after surgery, recurrence rate, and DASH scores between the groups with and without fractures; the treatment costs were higher in the group with fractures than those without fractures; however, patients without fractures were able to resume work earlier than those with fractures.The pathological fractures associated with enchondromas have no significant impact on the treatment outcomes compared to those with simple nonfractured enchondromas. Although the cost was more expensive for patients treated primarily with pathological fractures due to enchondromas, these patients could resume their work normally much earlier than those treated by delayed surgery. Early surgical intervention is recommended for better results and no increased risks for patients with pathological fractures caused by enchondromas."

We reviewed 31 patients (18 men and 13 women) with a mean age of 52.9 years (13.5 to 77.2) in whom computer navigation-assisted surgery had been carried out for a bone tumour of the pelvis or sacrum. There were 23 primary malignant bone tumours, four metastatic tumours and four locally advanced primary tumours of the rectum. The registration error when using computer navigation was < 1 mm in each case. There were no complications related to the navigation, which allowed the preservation of sacral nerve roots (n = 13), resection of otherwise inoperable disease (n = 4) and the avoidance of hindquarter amputation (n = 3). The intralesional resection rate for primary tumours of the pelvis and sacrum was 8.7% (n = 2): clear bone resection margins were achieved in all cases. At a mean follow-up of 13.1 months (3 to 34) three patients (13%) had developed a local recurrence. The mean time alive from diagnosis was 16.8 months (4 to 48). Computer navigation-assisted surgery is safe and has reduced our intralesional resection rate for primary tumours of the pelvis and sacrum. We recommend this technique as being worthy of further consideration for this group of patients."

Enchondroma is a benign tumor that is usually asymptomatic and thus should be treated nonoperatively. Symptomatic enchondromas are often treated by intralesional excision. Intramedullary low-grade chondrosarcoma is a malignant tumor that is usually painful. The treatment of low-grade chondrosarcoma may range from intralesional excision with or without adjuvant therapy to wide excision. Although intralesional excisions have a higher bone and joint preservation rate than wide excisions, they may be associated with a higher local recurrence rate. Intermediate- and high-grade chondrosarcomas are treated with wide excisions. The treatment of these cartilaginous lesions should involve a multidisciplinary team including a musculoskeletal surgeon, a radiologist, and a pathologist."

Many Grade I chondrosarcomas behave benignly if aggressively, and the question arises regarding whether wide resection is essential to control the disease. We therefore asked whether intralesional surgery also could be extended to Grade I chondrosarcomas without an increase in recurrence. We retrospectively reviewed 31 patients with Grade I chondrosarcomas of the limbs. The minimum followup was 66 months (mean, 157 months; range, 66-296 months). None of the 16 patients treated by resection had recurrences during the followup and two of the 15 patients with intralesional excision had recurrences, both of which resolved with resection of the site involved by the recurrence without progression of the disease. The Musculoskeletal Tumor Society scores averaged 72% in patients treated with wide resection compared with 89% in the 15 patients treated by intralesional surgery. The two recurrences occurred in patients whose radiographs showed thinning of the cortex combined with bone enlargement and marked endosteal scalloping; histologic examination in these two patients also showed a correlation between radiographic aggressiveness and the presence of myxoid areas and hypercellularity."

CD010778,0,25070233,0,Chondrosarcoma of bone.,"Chondrosarcoma is a cartilage forming neoplasm, which is the second most common primary malignancy of bone. Clinicians who treat chondrosarcoma patients must determine the grade of the tumor, and must ascertain the likelihood of metastasis. Acral lesions are unlikely to metastasize, regardless of grade, whereas axial, or more proximal lesions are much more likely to metastasize than tumors found in the distal extremities with equivalent histology. Chondrosarcoma is resistant to both chemotherapy and radiation, making wide local excision the only treatment. Local recurrence is frequently seen after intralesional excision, thus wide local excision is sometimes employed despite significant morbidity, even in low-grade lesions. Chondrosarcoma is difficult to treat. The surgeon must balance the risk of significant morbidity with the ability to minimize the chance of local recurrence and maximize the likelihood of long-term survival."

The factors that influence local and systemic control of pelvic CS and the functional outcome should be evaluated.Patients. Fifty-one patients (37 males and 14 females; mean age, 39.4 years) with pelvic CS were included in this retrospective study.Methods. The tumor stage, surgical treatment, surgical margin achieved, complications, incidence of local recurrence (LR), incidence of distant metastases, and the oncologic and functional status were evaluated. Oncologic outcome was estimated by the method of Kaplan and Meier, and the functional status was scored according to Musculoskeleral Tumor Society (MSTS) criteria. Analysis of variance was used to determine the factors that influence the oncologic and functional outcome.Results. Surgical stages were IA in three cases, IB in 23, IIB in 23, and III in two. Hemipelvectomy (H) was performed in 13 cases, internal hemipelvectomy (IH) with endoprosthetic replacement in 17, and continuity resection (CR) in 23.Two patients received IH and CR, one due to LR, and one due to instability. Radical or wide margins were achieved in 27 cases, marginal margins in 16, and intralesional margins in eight. Local complication required additional surgery in 10 cases due to local infections and/or hematomas.Two patients died perioperatively. In 48 out of the 49 remaining patients, follow-up was available with a mean duration of 73.4 months (range, 4-229 months).Twenty patients died of the disease, two patients are alive with metastases, four patients are disease free after LR, and 22 patients show no evidence of the disease. LR occurred in 10 cases (20.4%), and 17 patients (34.6%) developed distant metastases. Functional evaluation of the 28 survivors revealed good and excellent results in 19 cases, fair in three and poor in six.The mean MSTS score of all survivors was 69.2%, after H it was 37.6%, after IH was 61.4%, and after CR was 79.5%.Conclusion. In pelvic chondrosarcoma, survival was determined by the tumor stage and the surgical margin achieved.The incidence of LR was influenced by the surgical margin achieved, whereas the incidence of distant metastases was influenced by the tumor stage. The best oncologic results in chondrosarcoma involving the innominate bone could be found in low-grade tumors, and the best functional results after continuity resection and restoration of the pelvic girdle."

In the first patient, curative resection was not feasible because of the size and extension of the tumour. However, rapid tumour growth and unbearable pain necessitated a debulking procedure 16 months later. Histopathologic examination revealed a highly malignant dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma. The patient died two years after initial presentation as a result of local tumour growth. In the second patient, treatment consisted of wide resection of the tumour. Five years after the surgery the patient was free of disease. The third patient was initially treated by intralesional resection, followed by partial hemipelvectomy because of residual tumour. Thirteen months later, a local recurrence occurred that was treated by wide excision. Four years after the partial hemipelvectomy the patient was both pain-free and disease-free.

A review of the literature and a report on our own experience.,"The present paper comprises a review of the literature on chondromyxoid fibroma (CMF) and a report on nine cases originally classified as CMF, found in a review of all curetted bone lesions at our department from 1955 to 1978. At histologic revaluation only two cases fulfilled the criteria for true CMF, whereas six were classified as other benign bone lesions and one proved to be a chondrosarcoma. The chondrosarcoma case after recurrence was subjected to more mutilating surgery than would have been necessary if correct diagnosis had been established initially. The other six benign cases were all well and without signs of recurrence 5-11 years after curettage. In one of the two true CMF cases, i.e. in a young boy, there were for 2 years postoperatively radiological signs of a progressive recurrence, which was left without treatment, since the patient was well. Interestingly, radiograms 2 and 11 years postoperatively essentially showed the same picture, indicating spontaneous cessation of the process. Chondromyxoid fibroma is an extremely rare lesion. Histologic misinterpretation is not uncommon. In sporadic cases this may have serious implications. It may be questioned whether surgical treatment of CMF in young patients, known to have a high recurrence rate, is mandatory."

Fifty-four patients underwent wide resections and three patients underwent marginal excision for radiographically aggressive lesions. Thirteen patients were treated with intralesional curettage for more indolent lesions. The mean age of the patients was 43 years (range, 5-85 years) and the minimum followup was 0.2 year (mean, 8.5 years; range, 0.2-22.8 years). Of the patients who had wide resection, one experienced local recurrence and one had metastasis develop. One patient in the group treated with intralesional curettage had local recurrence and metastasis. We observed no difference in overall survival rate between the intralesional curettage group and the wide resection group. Although there was no difference in the treatment outcome between the two groups, patients with more radiographically aggressive lesions underwent more extensive surgery. The data suggest in selected patients less radiographically aggressive Grade I chondrosarcoma can be safely treated with intralesional curettage without compromising patient outcome."
CD010778,0,9457335,0,"Characteristics of phenol. Instillation in intralesional tumor excision of chondroblastoma, osteoclastoma and enchondroma.","Because of the typical metaphyseal-epiphyseal growth of giant cell tumors and chondroblastomas, the optimal result of an en bloc resection can usually only be achieved by a loss of joint function. For this reason, intralesional excision has prevailed, though it leads to a high rate of relapses. Adjuvant therapy involving irrigation of the remaining bone cavity with phenol can distinctly decrease the rate of relapse. Little is known about the amount of phenol applied that is absorbed. This study investigated the urinary excretion of phenol following the instillation of 102 ml of a 5% phenol solution. The method consisted of urine collection from 11 patients treated by phenol instillation preoperatively, and at 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 h postoperatively. The urine specimens were analysed for phenol by mass spectrometry. Preoperatively, the value was 5.1 mg/l on average. The maximum concentration of 62 mg/l was found 1 h after instillation, with an average value of 41.5 mg/l, and after 3 h of 18.9 mg/l. A further rapid decrease in the excretion rate was recorded, with normal values being reached after 12 h. This means a maximum of 9% and an average of 2% of the instilled amount of phenol were excreted in the urine within 24 h postoperatively. By comparing these urinary concentrations to published standards, we conclude that the instillation of a 5% phenol solution into bony lesions is associated with a relatively low risk of systemic toxicity."

Histologic diagnosis in 86% showed osteosarcomas, chondrosarcomas, and Ewing's tumors. Age ranged from 10.0 to 61.5 years (mean age, 32.9 years). The resection margin was wide in 15 patients but marginal in 2 patients and intralesional in 4 patients. All of the latter patients died of their disease. In all cases where 3-dimensional imaging was used, wide resection margins could be achieved, whereas this was possible only in 50% of the cases with conventional imaging techniques. Seven patients died of their disease 3 to 15 months after surgery, 2 died of chemotherapy induced sepsis, and 2 patients died perioperatively. At followup, 8 patients had no evidence of disease (mean, 57.6 months; range, 12-190 months), and 2 patients were alive with disease. Fourteen patients could be observed for at least 12 months (mean, 41.1 months) and were functionally evaluated according to Enneking's criteria. If extensive resection was necessary, the best results were found if the defect had been reconstructed with a custom made prosthesis. The results were only satisfactory after implantation of saddle prostheses and poor with allografts or when no reconstruction of the bone defect was done."
CD010778,0,6619626,0,[Determination of malignancy of cartilaginous tumors (2). Determination of malignancy by nuclear DNA contents and their distribution patterns in cartilaginous tumors].,"In 40 different types of cartilaginous tumors, the number of binuclear cells was calculated and DNA content was examined using fluorescent Feulgen cytophotometric technique. In 7 enchondromas and 1 synovial chondromatosis, the DNA content was diploid in 7 and hypotetraploid in 1, and showed a unimodal normal distribution. The number of binuclear cells was 0.1-0.45%, and the mean DNA content was below 4. These cases showed no evidence of disease after curettage and bone graft. The follow-up period was from 4 years 6 months to 7 years 1 month, averaging 6 years 2 months. In 2 enchondromatoses and 2 benign chondroblastomas, the DNA content was diploid and showed a unimodal normal distribution. One chondromyxoid fibroma showed a broad-unimodal tetraploid distribution, and one benign chondroblastoma showed a broad-aneuploid distribution. The nuclear DNA content was sometimes histologically similar to that of chondrosarcoma in some benign cartilaginous tumors. In 5 secondary chondrosarcomas, the DNA content was hypo- or hypertetraploid, hexaploid, and showed broad-unimodal or broad-bimodal distribution. The number of binuclear cells was from 13% to 23%. Although the size of the nucleus was small, the number of binuclear cells was evidently numerous. The preferred treatment for secondary chondrosarcoma is principally wide resection, but amputation is sometimes indicated in cases of recurrence and large tumor size. The follow-up period was from 2 years 2 months to 18 years 11 months, averaging 9 years 11 months. All 5 patients were surviving at the time of follow-up. The DNA content in chondrosarcoma was mostly hypo- or hypertetraploid, hexaploid, or octaploid and showed broad-unimodal, broad-bimodal or broad-aneuploid distribution. The number of binuclear cells was 0.55-3.5%. The mean DNA content was proportional to the number of binuclear cells, the positive correlation between the mean DNA content and the number of binuclear cells was found (p less than 1%)."

Thirty-six patients with histologically high-grade soft-tissue sarcomas were treated with caffeine-potentiated chemotherapy and conservative surgery (25 cases of limb-sparing surgery and 11 of local tumor excision). There were 13 patients with malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH), eight with synovial sarcoma, five with liposarcoma, four with malignant schwannoma, four with epithelioid sarcoma, one with leiomyosarcoma and one with extraskeletal chondrosarcoma. Nine patients were at stage III with lung metastasis and the other 27 at stage IIB without metastasis; 22 were male and 14 female with a mean age of 48 years, ranging from 16 to 77. For intra-arterial preoperative chemotherapy, we administered 2-5 courses of cisplatin (120 mg/m2), doxorubicin (30 mg/m2 x 2 days), and caffeine (1.5 g/m2 x 3 days) to 18 patients, and cisplatin and caffeine to the other 18. Although 15 patients had already undergone unplanned tumor excision at other hospitals before preoperative chemotherapy, all patients underwent definitive limb-sparing surgery after the preoperative chemotherapy. Surgical margins were wide for 28 patients, marginal for three and intralesional for five. Local tumor recurrence was seen in one patient with MFH and one with epithelioid sarcoma. Of the 27 stage IIB patients, lung metastasis newly developed in one with MFH, three with synovial sarcoma, two with malignant schwannoma and one with leiomyosarcoma. As for the effects of preoperative chemotherapy in the 33 eligible cases, radiographically confirmed complete response was seen in two patients, partial response in 20 and no response in 11. Histological response to this preoperative chemotherapy consisted of grade I (no response) in 14, grade II (50-90% necrosis) in four, grade III (> 90% necrosis) in eight, and grade IV (no viable cells) in seven cases. An overall objective response rate of 73% was obtained. With the mean follow-up period of 58 months (5-101 months), the overall 5-year cumulative survival rate ascertained with the Kaplan-Meier method was 63% and that of stage II patients 81%. Eight of the nine stage III patients died of metastatic disease within two and a half years from the beginning of the treatment. In conclusion, caffeine-potentiated chemotherapy and limb-sparing surgery brought good results for stage II nonmetastatic soft-tissue sarcomas. The problem of treatment for stage III metastatic soft-tissue sarcomas, however, remains unsolved."

CD010778,0,21241899,0,When should we biopsy a solitary central cartilaginous tumor of long bones? Literature review and management proposal.,"Differentiation between benign and low-grade malignant cartilaginous tumors is a radiological and pathological challenge. Based on a literature review, we propose the following guidelines for the management of a solitary central cartilaginous tumor of long bones distinguishing three situations: 1. The tumor is considered to be aggressive and requires surgery if one of the following criteria is present: cortical destruction, Moth-eaten or permeative osteolysis, spontaneous pathologic fracture, periosteal reaction, edema surrounding the tumor on MR images, and soft tissue mass. Tumor biopsy followed by complete intralesional treatment is indicated. 2. The tumor is classified as active if two of the following active criteria are present: pain related to the tumor, endosteal scalloping superior to two-thirds of the cortical thickness, extent of endosteal scalloping superior to two-thirds of the lesion length, cortical thickening and enlargement of the medullary cavity. Tumor biopsy or excision is indicated. 3. The tumor is classified as possibly active if one of the previous active criteria is present. In such cases, bone scintigraphy and dynamic-enhanced MR imaging should be obtained. Radionuclide uptake superior to the anterior iliac crest at bone scintigraphy and early and exponential enhancement at dynamic-enhanced MR are considered as two additional active criteria. After these two examinations, if only one criterion is still present, the lesion can be regarded as possibly quiescent, and the following monitoring is suggested: first follow-up at three to six months and then once a year. Otherwise, if two or more active criteria are present, biopsy is recommended. 4. The tumor is considered quiescent and does not require surgery if no active or aggressive criterion is present. A radiological follow-up can be proposed."

The patients' mean age was 19 years; there were six males and four females. The anatomical locations were five phalangeal, three metatarsal, one tarsal affecting body of os calcis and one distal tibial. The median delay in presentation was 4.5 months. The modes of presentation were pain only (n=4), painful lump (n=4) and painless lump (n=2). The typical radiological finding was an expansile, lobulated, cystic lesion. Cortical erosion was documented in 80% patients. In four cases, curettage alone was carried out, while five patients underwent curettage along with autogenous bone grafting. One patient with distal phalangeal CMF had a primary toe amputation. Two patients had recurrences 9 and 16 months after their initial curettage. Both of them were males with proximal phalangeal CMF, associated with cortical erosion. Foot and phalangeal CMF initially treated with curettage only should be closely followed up, as we observed a 20% recurrence rate within a 2-year period. Cases featuring cortical erosion require thorough curettage and may require autogenous bone grafting to prevent fracture."

In general, cryosurgery for low grade chondrosarcoma is encouraging as long as the limb is protected postoperatively from fracture -- using various orthopedic appliances to allow bone regeneration (i.e. ischial weight bearing brace). Other complications such as nerve paralysis have been transient. One air embolis death occurred (in another disease) where the exit of nitrogen gas was blocked.

The purpose of this study was to show that radiofrequency ablation was an effective alternative treatment. We enrolled 20 patients (two male, 18 female, mean age 56 years (36 to 72) in a proof-of-principle study. After inclusion, biopsy and radiofrequency ablation were performed, followed three months later by curettage and adjuvant phenolisation. The primary endpoint was the proportional necrosis in the retrieved material. Secondary endpoints were correlation with the findings on gadolinium enhanced MRI, functional outcome and complications. Our results show that 95% to 100% necrosis was obtained in 14 of the 20 patients. MRI had a 91% sensitivity and 67% specificity for detecting residual tumour after curettage. The mean functional outcome (MSTS) score six weeks after radiofrequency ablation was 27.1 (23 to 30) compared with 18.1 (12 to 25) after curettage (p < 0.001). No complications occurred after ablation, while two patients developed a pathological fracture after curettage. We have shown that radiofrequency ablation is capable of completely eradicating cartilaginous tumour cells in selective cases. MRI has a 91% sensitivity for detecting any residual tumour. Radiofrequency ablation can be performed on an outpatient basis allowing a rapid return to normal activities. If it can be made more effective, it has the potential to provide better local control, while improving functional outcome."

This article presents a case of intraosseous ganglion of the talus in a 38-year-old woman treated with a new surgical approach and technique. The patient had mild ankle pain at the arc of motion in her right ankle that increased with activity. Radiographs and magnetic resonance images showed a cystic lesion in the medial side of the talar dome. It was treated by curettage and autocorticocancellous bone grafting through an opening in the talonavicular joint without disturbing the intact talar dome cartilage. One month after the operation, the patient had an excellent clinical outcome. This approach and technique can be used to treat other lesions of the talus that do not involve the joint space."

CD010778,0,17499034,0,Combined use of free vascularised bone graft and extracorporeally-irradiated autograft for the reconstruction of massive bone defects after resection of malignant tumour.,"We review eight patients who underwent curative resection for malignant musculoskeletal tumour followed by reconstruction with vascularised bone graft in combination with extracorporeally-irradiated autograft. This method consists of (1) wide en-bloc resection of the tumour; (2) curettage of tumour from the resected bone; (3) extracorporeal irradiation with 60 to 70 Gy as a bolus single dose; (4) vascularised bone grafting from the fibula (six cases) or scapula (two cases); (5) re-implantation of the irradiated bone into the recipient and fixation with plates and screws. Five cases were located in the tibial shaft and one each in the ulnar shaft, distal femur and acetabulum. Radiological and functional outcomes were excellent in four patients who were reconstructed with vascularised fibula and irradiated intercalary tibial bone graft. Two patients with irradiated osteochondral graft showed osteoarthritic change in the long term. No local recurrences arising from the irradiated bones were detected. Combination of a vascularised and an extracorporeally-irradiated bone graft is a useful reconstructive tool for massive bone defects arising from resection of malignant musculoskeletal tumour. This approach has the advantage of combining the biological properties provided by the vascularised bone graft with the mechanical endurance of the irradiated bone autograft. The method is best indicated for intercalary defects of the tibia."

After the curettage of tumor, regarding as the differences of all parts of the bone structure reconstruction in the patient's hand, we chose three following methods for this boy, i.e. fixed by the locking plate with calcium phosphate cement, filled with allograft bone, curetted the tumor without any bone graft. After the surgery, the patient was able to perform full motion of the operated hand. No evidence of recurrence was noted four years after surgery. To choose the different ways with bone grafts or not that relies on the patients' conditions for bone structure reconstruction. However, patients with large osseous defects or pathological fracture, we demand full bone graft and reliable internal fixation. After surgery, early exercises can reach a desirable result and functional recovery."

Involvement of the thoracic vertebrae may be present in 2-5% of cases. Definitive diagnosis usually requires a suitable distinction between this and other mesenchymal tumours such as chondrosarcomas, so immunohistochemical analysis is virtually mandatory. In spite of its slow-growing nature, chondroid chordoma tends to relapse, and it may eventually become malignant, often jeopardising the patient's prognosis. Although surgery remains the main therapeutic approach, research into the molecular and genetic aspects of this tumour is ongoing. These new advances are likely to improve future oncology therapies by complementing surgery and radiotherapy, changing the currently poor prognosis. We report the case of a patient with a chondroid chordoma involving the thoracic vertebrae and pleural cavity, and the treatment performed."

We report our experience using cryotherapy as an adjuvant to treat patients with low-grade intracompartmental chondrosarcomas. Ten consecutive patients had intralesional resections including curettage, cryo-surgery, and polymethylmethacrylate application. Eight of these patients required prophylactic skeletal stabilization. We retrospectively reviewed the outcomes for tumor recurrence, disease progression, and complications. The Musculo-skeletal Tumor Society rating scale was used to evaluate functional outcome, and the mean score was 27 points (range, 25-30 points). The mean age of the patients was 54.4 years (range, 29-83 years), and the average followup was 38.5 months (range, 24-60 months). Patients were treated for lesions of the femur (n = 3), humerus (n = 3), scapula (n = 2), tibia (n = 1), and acetabulum (n = 1). There was no evidence of recurrence or metastases. At the latest followup, all patients were well, however, one patient had hardware loosening.

CD010778,0,12239678,0,Enchondromas of the hand: treatment with curettage and cemented internal fixation.,"Removal by means of curettage is the mainstay of surgical treatment of enchondromas of the hand. Reconstruction traditionally entails filling the tumor cavity with a bone graft, or it may be decided not to perform a reconstruction. In either case a period of protected activity is needed until the tumor cavity has healed. The current study describes the use of cemented internal fixation for the purpose of reconstruction of these cavities. This technique provides immediate mechanical stability and allows early mobilization. Between 1986 and 1999, we treated 13 patients who were diagnosed as having enchondroma of the hand. Surgery included tumor removal with hand curettes and high-speed burr drilling. The remaining tumor cavity was reconstructed by using bone cement and intramedullary hardware. All patients were followed-up for more than 2 years. There were no postoperative infections or fractures, and all patients returned to their presurgical functional capability within 4 weeks. At the most recent follow-up evaluation, none of the patients had local tumor recurrence. Although 7 patients had a decrease in flexion of the metacarpophalangeal or interphalangeal joints, none reported a functional limitation. Reconstruction of the tumor cavity with cemented hardware provides immediate mechanical stability, allows early mobilization, and is associated with good functional outcome."

The aim of this report is to present a case that is extremely rare, but in accordance with the literature where the clear cell chondrosarcoma reportedly has a tendency for late metastases. In our patient the primary surgery was intralesional, since it was mistakenly interpreted as a benign tumour in the early 80s. The local recurrence and lung metastases occurred, however, 29 years after the initial treatment. The local recurrence was resected with wide margins, no additional surgery or oncological treatments were given, and two and half years postoperatively patient is doing well and there is no progression in the disease. In conclusion, it is important to have a long follow-up to the clear cell chondrosarcoma patients even for decades or lifelong, because the malignancy tends to metastasize or recur after an extended period. The course of metastasized disease may be unusually slow, so relatively aggressive treatment in metastasized and recurring cases is justified."

The tumors arose in females 34, 65, and 66 (median 55) years of age. Two women presented with headaches, and one with nasal obstruction. Radiographic studies revealed that all three lesions were expansile soft tissue masses centered in the clivus, at least 4 cm in greatest diameter. One lesion involved primarily the clivus, the others extended from the clivus into the sphenoid and ethmoid sinuses. Two of the three cases were initially misdiagnosed as chordoma or chondrosarcoma. The initial treatment was curettage of gross disease in all three cases. One patient also received radiation therapy. One patient had local progression of disease, which was treated with surgery and radiation therapy. All patients are clinically free of disease 11 to 26 months following the most recent treatment. Chondromyxoid fibroma can and should be distinguished from chondrosarcoma and chordoma, two tumors which more commonly arise in the skull base and which have the potential to metastasize."

Radiographic evidence of loosening mechanism.,"A review of the radiographs of 24 patients with massive proximal femoral cemented tumor endoprostheses revealed a repetitive radiographic sequence that culminated in implant loosening. The initial step was osteolysis of the proximal femur at the bone-prosthesis junction (13 of 24 cases, 54%). The osteolysis then progressed into the adjacent periprosthetic bone-cement interface as a radiolucent line (5 of 24 cases, 21%), followed by extension along the stem, culminating in implant loosening (4 of 24 cases, 17%). Two prostheses (8%) have required revision for loosening. The proximal osteolysis was noted prior to the appearance of progressive periprosthetic radiolucent lines in 11 patients and simultaneously in 2 but never followed periprosthetic radiolucent lines (P < .05). These findings are consistent with loosening by debris-induced osteolysis. This loosening sequence, confirming previous observations of cemented component loosening, should encourage efforts to prevent or delay the onset of this sequence."

Low grade central osteogenic sarcoma is an uncommon form that is characterized by a long premorbid history and is compatible with prolonged survival after treatment. Twenty cases of low grade central osteosarcoma with long-term followup (16 [2.5-48] years) were studied retrospectively. The age distribution was broad (range, 15-83 years). All tumors arose in the lower limb. The primary symptom was pain; mean duration was 44 months (range, 1-180 months). A diagnosis of low grade central osteosarcoma was made primarily for 11 patients. For 9 others, fibrous dysplasia (3), nonossifying fibroma (2), fibroma (1), chondromyxoid fibroma (1), chondrosarcoma (1), and simple bone cyst (1) were diagnosed initially. Intralesional surgery was associated with recurrence in every case. Radical margins were not associated with local recurrence. Four recurrences were higher grade and 1 was dedifferentiated. Three of 4 patients with metastases died of their disease. Five- and 10-year survival was 90% and 85%, respectively. Histology and radiology are complementary for confirming the diagnosis. Low grade central osteosarcoma seems to be controllable by surgery alone if at least wide margins are used."

CD010778,0,11953632,0,Limb salvage using original low heat-treated tumor-bearing bone.,"Limb salvage, using original low heat-treated tumor-bearing bone and a conventional joint prosthesis, was done in six patients with malignant tumors of the proximal humerus (one patient with chondrosarcoma and five patients with osteosarcoma) and in six patients with tumor of the proximal femur (two patients with malignant spindle cell sarcoma and four patients with osteosarcoma). Wide excision of the lesion was done and the tumor and surrounding soft tissues were removed. The excised bone was treated with heat and the prosthesis was inserted into the treated bone and fixed with cement. This construct was reinserted into the original site and anchored to the host bone with a plate. The overall union rate of the low heat-treated bone with normal host bone was 91.7%, and the mean union time was 4.6 months (range, 3-7 months) after surgery. The functional result of the proximal femur and proximal humerus were 76.7% and 56.8%, respectively, using the Musculoskeletal Tumor Society functional evaluation system. Complications included hip dislocation in one patient, fracture of the low heat-treated bone in two patients, and absorption of the low heat-treated bone of the humerus in four of six patients. The 5-year survival rate of the low heat-treated tumor-bearing bone was 83.3% using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Based on the results of this study, limb salvage using original low heat-treated tumor-bearing bone seems to be effective in treating primary bone sarcoma with high survival and acceptable complication rates, circumventing the complications of allograft bone."

Radiographs were characterised by the presence of lytic areas with intralesional calcifications and soft tissue extension. Histological diagnosis was made by biopsy in two cases and after amputation of the finger for lesional spread in one case. Treatment consisted of amputation of the finger in two cases. In the case of metacarpal localisation, wide resection of two rays was followed by recurrence after ten months which required amputation of the hand.

There was no male preponderance. All except one lesion occurred in the epiphysis but biansagression across epiphyseal plate into the metaphysis was not uncommon. In only one case the lesion was entirely in the metaphysis of the middle phalanx of a finger. Radiologically, the lesion appeared cystic with mottled calcification and a peripheral sclerotic margin. Microscopically, all lesions were benign with three characteristic features: round a polygonal chondroblast, areas of cell necrosis with intra and extra-cellular calcification and giant cells in response to the dead cells. Thorough curettage and bone grafting resulted in complete resolution in all cases without recurrence. For the lesions of the femoral head, an approach through the fovea of the head after division of the ligamentum teres and dislocation of the hip anteriorly was preferred. Adequate curettage could be dome without the risk of avascular necrosis or femoral neck fracture otherwise encountered with the transcervical approach."

Moreover, enchondroma is less frequent in the distal phalanx. We report two unusual cases of avulsion of the flexor digitorum profundus tendon at its insertion in combination with pathological fracture of the distal phalanx due to enchondroma. Curettage and bone grafting were performed for an enchondroma of the distal phalanx. The flexor digitorum profundus tendon and the avulsed bone fragment were reinserted through the bone graft into the distal phalanx using the pull-out technique. With Strickland's criteria, the clinical results were evaluated as excellent in both cases. At the final follow-up examinations, there were no symptoms and no recurrence of the bone tumor. In the present cases, three-dimensional computed tomography imaging was useful for diagnosing the flexor tendon avulsion, determining the preoperative identification the location of a ruptured tendon stump, and planning the operation to minimize the surgical wound. The recommended treatment for avulsion of the FDP tendon due to enchondroma is curettage, bone grafting of the resultant cavity, and reattachment of the tendon to ensure sufficient structural strength to permit secure fixation and early mobilization and, especially, to prevent flexion contracture of the finger because the stump of the flexor digitorum profundus is buried in the cavity of the distal phalanx."

The radiograph showed a lytic lesion around the CPC filling which showed no signs of absorption after 12 years. The tumor was curated easily, however, a steel bar was needed to remove the CPC mass in a carefully manner not to break the cortex. CPC has an advantage of immediate biomechanical stability, on the other hand, a disadvantage of being unabsorbed inside of bone. Although enchondroma has a low recurrence rate after surgery generally, in consideration of recurrence, we recommend the use of absorbable materials when a use of artificial bone substitute to fill the defect is planned."

Results were classified according to the amount of new bone formed in the cavity left after curettage. Results in fifteen patients with excellent bone formation were classified as grade one, in nine patients with good bone formation as grade two, and in four patients with scanty bone formation as grade three. There were no patients without new bone formation (grade four), nor were there any recurrences or postoperative fractures in this series. We conclude that simple curettage without bone grafting is a safe and effective treatment of enchondromas in the hand."

In recent years, a trend has emerged for patients with low-grade tumours to be treated less invasively using curettage followed by various forms of adjuvant therapy. We investigated the potential for phenol to be used as an adjuvant. Using a human chondrosarcoma-derived cartilage-producing cell line OUMS-27 as an in vitro model we studied the cytotoxic effect of phenol and ethanol. Since ethanol is the standard substance used to rinse phenol out of a bone cavity, we included an assessment of ethanol to see whether this was an important secondary factor with respect to cell death. The latter was assessed by flow cytometry. A cytotoxic effect was found for concentrations of phenol of 1.5% and of ethanol of 42.5%. These results may provide a clinical rationale for the use of both phenol and ethanol as adjuvant therapy after intralesional curettage in low-grade central chondrosarcoma and justify further investigation."

We hypothesized extended intralesional treatment would equally control malignant disease but with improved functional outcomes and decreased postoperative complications. We retrospectively reviewed 31 patients with 32 Grade I intracompartmental chondrosarcomas of the long bones of the appendicular skeleton treated with either resection (15 lesions) or extended intralesional curetting (17) at a minimum followup of 2 years (median, 55 months; range, 24-203 months). Lesions were larger and median followup was longer in the resection cohort. One local recurrence developed in each treatment cohort and neither transitioned to a higher grade of tumor. No patient had metastases develop or died of disease. The mean final Musculoskeletal Tumor Society functional scores were greater after extended intralesional versus resection treatment (29.5 versus 25.1). Complications were observed more frequently after resection and reconstruction (seven of 15) as compared with extended intralesional treatment (one of 17). Extended intralesional treatment of Grade I intracompartmental chondrosarcomas of the long bones of the appendicular skeleton therefore appears safe with improved functional scores and decreased complications versus segmental resection and reconstruction."

CD010778,0,7449231,0,The management of chondrosarcoma of bone.,"Chondrosarcomas of bone are among the most difficult problems in diagnosis and management in the field of orthopaedic oncology. In addition to the variability of presentation of the ""standard"" hyaline, myxoid or fibrous types of lesion, three unusual forms of the tumor are now recognized--mesenchymal, clear cell and dedifferentiated--which show differences in their biologic behavior. Chondrosarcomas, with only rare exception, are radio-resistant and show only a limited response to adjunctive chemotherapy. The optimal therapy at present is surgical, but clearly the type of surgical procedure selected should vary with the malignity and extent of the tumor in order to avoid either undertreatment (resulting in a high rate of local recurrence and/or distant metastases) or excessive and unnecessary sacrifice of normal tissue. Patients suspected of having chondrosarcomas should be thoroughly evaluated by clinical examination, radiographic and special studies to define as fully as possible the site and extent of the local tumor, the presence or absence of a soft-tissue mass and the existence of distant metastases. A biopsy should be performed through an incision which can be subsequently excised during the definition procedure. The tissue obtained should be graded histologically and the clinical and radiologic data added to define whether the lesion is benign or a low-grade or high-grade chondrosarcoma. Using a special system recently described by Enneking and Spanier, the lesions should be evaluated on the basis of the grade (G1 or G2); the site of the lesion in relation to the anatomic compartments (T1 or T2) and the presence or absence of distant metastasis (M0 or M1). Based on a scheme presented in this article, the appropriate one of four grades of surgical procedures should be chosen. For benign tumors, Grade I procedures (intralesional curettage or excision) are generally adequate. For Stage IA tumors, occasionally a Grade II procedure, marginal excision may be sufficient, but more frequently Grade III procedures (wide intracompartmental resections) are indicated. Stage IIA and IIB lesions should be treated with Grade III or Grade IV (radical resection) surgical procedures. The treatment of inoperable or Stage IV tumors (those with metastasis) is unsatisfactory and consists of palliative resections, radiation therapy and chemotherapy."

CD010778,0,12367544,0,Simple curettage without bone grafting for enchondromata of the hand: with special reference to replacement of the cortical window.,"We studied 23 patients (25 bones) with enchondromata of the hand which were treated with simple curettage without bone grafting. The cortical window was replaced in 18 bones (group A), whereas it was not replaced in six bones (group B). In one bone, only half of the cortical window was replaced. Local recurrence was not seen in any patient. Although bone grafting was not performed, new bone formation was observed in all the patients. Radiographic and functional results were excellent in most bones. Restoration of the continuity of the cortex was seen at 3 (range, 1.5-4) months in group A and 8 (range, 6-12) months in group B. This restoration is important for the recovery of mechanical strength and we therefore consider that the cortical window should be replaced, unless this is impractical."
CD010778,0,15241167,0,Chondrosarcoma of the hand: is a wide surgical resection necessary?,"Chondrosarcomas of the hand are rare and generally treated with surgical resection. Thirteen patients with Grade 1 chondrosarcoma of the small bones of the hand were followed up for a mean of 99.8 months (range, 26-293 months). In eight patients (Group 1) curettage and reconstruction with cancellous bone was done and in five patients (Group 2) a wide resection was done. No patient experienced relapse in Group 2. In Group 1 one patient had a local relapse 18 months after intralesional resection. Using the Musculoskeletal Tumor Society score for evaluation, the clinical results showed an average of 98% and 95% of the normal function in Groups 1 and 2, respectively. None of the patients had evidence of systemic spread of the disease. With a relapse rate of 12.5% and no distant metastases after curettage, intralesional resection is the preferred method of treatment in Grade 1 chondrosarcoma of the hand, allowing the patient to avoid amputation and major loss of function."
