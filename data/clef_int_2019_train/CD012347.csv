CD012347,0,22766419,0,Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease history assessment in Spain: a multidimensional chronic obstructive pulmonary disease evaluation. Study methods and organization.,"This present paper describes the method and the organization of the study known as the COPD History Assessment In SpaiN (CHAIN), whose main objective is to evaluate the long-term natural history of a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patient cohort from a multidimensional standpoint and to identify clinical phenotypes, in comparison with another non-COPD control cohort."

CD012347,0,28449629,0,The changing epidemiology of HIV in the criminal justice system.,"Although the rate of HIV infection among US prison inmates is considerably higher than that of the general population, little is known about age-related changes in HIV-infected inmates over the last decade. This study of the nation's largest state prison system examined (1) whether the mean age of the HIV-infected inmate increased over the last decade, and (2) whether the prevalence of HIV and associated comorbidities varied according to age. The study population included all 230,103 inmates incarcerated in the Texas prison system for any duration during 2014. A separate analysis was conducted on all HIV-infected inmates incarcerated between 2004 and 2014. Information on medical conditions and demographic factors was obtained from an institution-wide electronic medical record system. From 2004 to 2014, the mean age of HIV-infected inmates in the prison system increased from 39.3 to 42.5 years, compared to an increase of 36.1-37.9 for all Texas prison inmates. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the independent contributions of multiple demographic and clinical covariates in predicting the binary outcome, HIV infection. The model showed that, in 2014, HIV infection was elevated in inmates who were aged 40-49 years (OR = 3.1; 95% CI 2.7-3.3), aged 50-59 years (OR = 2.4; 95% CI 2.1-2.7), African American (OR = 3.0; 95% CI 2.8-3.3), and in those with several chronic diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR = 1.7; 95% CI 1.5-1.9), hepatitis C (OR = 2.7; 95% CI 2.5-3.1), major depressive disorder (OR = 1.7; 95% CI 1.5-2.1), bipolar disorder (OR = 2.3; 95% CI 1.8-2.8), and schizophrenia (OR = 1.5; 95% CI 1.3-1.8). Among HIV-infected inmates (n = 2960), the percentage with comorbid disease increased in a linear fashion according to age (p < .01). Correctional health systems must adapt to address the evolving epidemiology of HIV among inmate populations."
CD012347,0,9517591,0,Comparison of discriminative properties among disease-specific questionnaires for measuring health-related quality of life in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.,"Three disease-specific, health-related quality of life (HRQL) questionnaires have been introduced to assess patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), the Breathing Problems Questionnaire (BPQ), and the Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire (CRQ). The purpose of the present study was to make comparisons between the SGRQ, the BPQ, and the CRQ in their discriminative properties, and to clarify the characteristics of each questionnaire. One hundred forty-three patients with mild to severe COPD completed pulmonary function tests, progressive cycle ergometer testing for exercise capacity, assessment of dyspnea, anxiety, and depression, and assessment of HRQL. The frequency distributions of the questionnaire scores showed that the SGRQ and the CRQ were normally distributed and that the BPQ was skewed toward low scores. Relationships between all dimensions of the three questionnaires were significant (correlation coefficients [Rs] = 0.74 to 0.86). The three questionnaires had significant but weak correlations (Rs = -0.24 to -0.36) with some physiologic variables (VC, FEV1, and DL(CO)/VA) and mild to moderate correlations with exercise capacity and assessment of dyspnea, anxiety, and depression. Stepwise multiple regression analyses revealed that the Baseline Dyspnea Index (BDI) score, anxiety by the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HAD), and maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) accounted for 61% of the variance in the SGRQ and that the BDI and anxiety of the HAD accounted for 53 and 49% of the variance in the BPQ and the CRQ, respectively. Dyspnea and psychologic status impacted the HRQL in patients with COPD. Although no substantial differences between the SGRQ, the BPQ, and the CRQ were evident in the correlations with physiologic parameters and the influential factors, the BPQ was found to be less discriminatory than the SGRQ and the CRQ in evaluating HRQL cross-sectionally."

CD012347,0,27078748,0,A new instrument to predict smoking cessation among patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: an observational longitudinal study of the Trying To Quit smoking questionnaire.,"The Trying To Quit smoking questionnaire (TTQ), was developed to measure pressure-filled mental states, use of destructive pressure-relief strategies and ambivalent thoughts about quitting smoking among patients with COPD. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the TTQ (available in an extended and in a reduced version) can be used to predict smoking cessation outcomes in smokers with COPD. As higher TTQ scores indicate higher degree of psychological distress, we hypothesised that TTQ scores at baseline would be negatively correlated with the probability of making a quit attempt, reducing the intensity of smoking and achieving complete abstinence during the 3 months. Smokers with COPD were recruited during planned or unplanned visits to primary healthcare centres, and 109 completed the TTQ at baseline and 85% participated in the follow-up after 3 months. Logistic regression was used to measure the association between the original (19 items) and the brief (14 item) version of TTQ scores and three outcomes: making at least one quit attempt, reducing the intensity of smoking and achieving complete abstinence. In a primary analysis among all the participants higher total score in the original version of TTQ was significantly associated with a lower probability of quit attempts. In a secondary analysis of subgroups of patients classified according to their readiness to quit, high TTQ scores at baseline were associated with lower probability of complete abstinence among patients not ready to quit (adjusted odds ratio (OR)=0.72; 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.53-0.99). Among patients ready to quit, high score on pressure-filled mental states was associated with lower probability of quit attempts (OR=0.78; 95% CI=0.66-0.94) but with higher probability of reduced smoking (OR=1.32; 95% CI=1.05-1.66). Ambivalent thoughts were associated with lower probability of all outcomes, but estimates were not statistically significant. Destructive coping strategies were inconsistently associated with the outcomes. TTQ in its original version and two of its subscales predicted smoking cessation outcomes in the anticipated direction. Therefore, this instrument may be useful in tailoring smoking cessation counselling for patients with COPD."

CD012347,0,1730397,0,"Dyspnea, anxiety, and depression in chronic respiratory impairment.","In order to examine the relationship of dyspnea to anxiety and depression, the authors rated dyspnea using several methods in 50 patients with chronic respiratory impairment. Anxiety and depression were measured by the Symptom Checklist-90 and the Symptom Questionnaire. Results varied with the method of assessing dyspnea. Physician-rated dyspnea was significantly associated with patients' self-ratings of breathlessness as well as with pulmonary function tests, but not with any of the self-rating scales of emotions. Self-rated breathlessness was significantly associated with self-rated depression. In multiple regression analyses, depression was predictive of breathlessness. When the sample was limited to patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, the results remained the same. The patients were significantly more depressed and anxious than matched family practice patients. In the study of the complex relationship of dyspnea to physical and emotional factors, it is desirable to use more than one measure of dyspnea because the results depend in part on the method of assessment."

The aim of this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study was to determine whether SBOT improves health-related quality of life (HRQL) or reduces acute healthcare utilisation in patients discharged following an acute exacerbation of COPD. Consecutive patients were screened; 78 of 331 were eligible for randomisation to cylinder oxygen, cylinder air or usual care following discharge. Patients were elderly with high acute healthcare utilisation, forced expiratory volume in one second of <1 L and had dyspnoea limiting daily activity but were not hypoxaemic at rest. Over the 6-month study period, there were no significant differences between patient groups in HRQL (Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire (CRQ), 36-item Short-Form Health Survey, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) except for CRQ emotion domain. There were no significant differences in acute healthcare utilisation. Time to readmission was greatest in the usual care group. Cylinder use was high initially, but rapidly fell to very low levels within weeks in both cylinder oxygen and air groups. In conclusion, the availability of short-burst oxygen therapy for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients discharged from hospital following an acute exacerbation did not improve health-related quality of life or reduce acute healthcare utilisation. These results provide no support for the widespread use of short-burst oxygen therapy."

CD012347,0,22402994,0,Obstructive sleep apnea severity correlates with cellular and plasma oxidative stress parameters and affective symptoms.,"Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is considered a sleep-related respiratory disorder, characterized by repetitive episodes of complete (apnea) or partial (hypopnea) obstruction of airflow in the upper airway (UA) during sleep. The pathophysiology of upper airway obstruction in OSAS is multifactorial, leading to a chronic recurrent state of intermittent hypoxemia and reoxygenation during sleep, maintaining a state of oxidative stress, which seems to be the key to the pathophysiological manifestations of OSAS, and is associated with the development of a number of high morbidity-mortality systematic complications, such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular and neuropsychological diseases. This study is an open, cross-sectional, and comparative clinical trial, whose general objective was to assess the correlation between OSAS severity, oxidative stress markers, and the presence of affective symptoms (depressive and anxious) in OSAS patients. We studied 38 adult males, who had been diagnosed with OSAS by overnight polysomnography, between 18 and 60 years of age, divided into three groups: group 1-10 individuals with mild OSAS (AHI between 5 and 14.9/h), group 2-13 individuals with moderate OSAS (AHI between 15 and 30/h), and group 3-15 individuals with severe OSAS (AHI >30/h). All individuals were evaluated for level of subjective sleepiness using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, for depressive and anxiety symptoms by the Hamilton Depression (HAM-D) and Anxiety (HAM-A) Scales, and for parameters of the oxidative stress state, measuring superoxide radical and serum nitrates and nitrites levels. There was a progressive and significant increase in the state of oxidative stress (p < 0.05), in the total score of depressive symptoms (p = 0.001) and in the overall score of anxiety symptoms (p = 0.004) directly proportional to the severity of apnea when comparing the mild group to the severe group. Positive correlations were identified between superoxide production and the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) (r = 0.48), Epworth sleepiness score (r = 0.36), and Hamilton depression score (HAM-D) (r = 0.40); between serum nitrates and nitrites levels and SO(2) min (r = 0.44); and between the AHI and the HAM-D (r = 0.51) score and HAM-A (r = 0.40) score. Negative correlations were observed between the AHI and serum nitrates and nitrites levels (r = -0.42), between superoxide production and SO(2) min (r = -0.31), between serum nitrates and nitrites levels and HAM-D (r = -0.50) and HAM-A (-0.42) scores, and between SO(2) min and HAM-D (r = -0.48) and HAM-A (r = -0.40) scores. According to the results of this study, we can conclude that (1) individuals with OSAS show an increase in the production of superoxide radical and a decrease in serum nitrates and nitrites levels, which are objective signs of a state of oxidative stress. (2) The more severe the OSAS, the more fragmented the sleep and the greater the nocturnal hypoxemia, the more severe is the oxidative stress state and the greater is the incidence of daytime symptoms, especially sleepiness and depressive and anxiety symptoms. Future studies might explore the investigation of oxidative stress parameters as an alternative approach to anticipate symptoms, measure prognosis, and monitor OSAS progression or treatment response."

Data were collected during structured in-home interviews using the UCLA loneliness scale, the Center for Epidemiological Studies depression scale, and the social support questionnaire. The clients and spouses did not differ significantly on measures of loneliness and depression, with mean scores for both groups higher than those in other comparable groups. Spouses, however, tended to be a little lonelier than clients, and clients tended to be a little more depressed than spouses. The two groups were also similar with respect to the number of people in their social networks but different as to network composition. Spouses were less satisfied with their networks than clients. Social support satisfaction was linked to loneliness and depression for clients but not for spouses. Results of the study suggest that community nurses working in home settings must be sensitive to clients' and spouses' psychologic reactions to COPD, which may be expressed in feelings of loneliness and depression."

In this study, we evaluated 6 measures of dyspnea for reliability and validity: (a) Baseline Dyspnea Index (BDI) and Transition Dyspnea Index, (b) UCSD Shortness of Breath Questionnaire (SOBQ),(c) American Thoracic Society Dyspnea Scale, (d) Oxygen Cost Diagram, (e) Visual Analog Scale, and (f) Borg Scale. Subjects were 143 patients (74 women) and 69 men) with obstructive lung disease, ages 40 to 86, FEV(1.0) 0.36 to 3.53 L, FVC 1.07 to 5.74 L. Dyspnea measures were assessed for test-retest reliability internal consistency, interrater reliability, and construct validity (i.e., correlations among dyspnea measures and correlations of dyspnea measures with exercise tolerance, health-related quality of life, lung function, anxiety, and depression).

Sixty patients exercised twice weekly for 16 weeks after randomisation to interval- or continuous training. Target intensity was 80% of baseline W peak in the interval group (I-group) and 65% in the continuous group (C-group). Patients were tested by spirometry, ergometer cycle test, cardiopulmonary test and a 12 min walk test. Dyspnoea was measured by the dyspnoea scale from Chronic Obstructive Disease Questionnaire (CRDQ), mental health by Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HAD) and HRQoL by the Medical Outcomes Survey Short Form 36 (SF-36). After training, W peak, peak oxygen uptake (VO(2) peak) and exhaled carbon dioxide (VCO(2) peak) increased significantly in both groups, no significant differences between the groups. Minute ventilation (V(E) peak) increased only in the C-group. At identical work rates (isotime) VO(2), VCO(2) and V(E) were significantly more decreased in the I-group than in the C-group (p<0.05). Functional capacity, dyspnoea, mental health, and HRQoL improved significantly in both groups, no difference between the groups. Interval training and continuous training were equally potent in improving peak exercise capacity, functional exercise capacity, dyspnoea, mental health and HRQoL in patients with moderate or severe COPD. At isotime, the physiological response to training differed between the groups, in favour of the interval training."

Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) has proved effective not only in people with primary insomnia but also in people with insomnia comorbid with psychiatric and medical illness (eg, depression, cancer, and chronic pain). However, CBT-I has rarely been tested in those with COPD who have disease-related features that interfere with sleep and may lessen the effectiveness of such therapies. The purpose of this study was to determine the feasibility of applying a CBT-I intervention for people with COPD and to assess the impact of CBT-I on insomnia severity and sleep-related outcomes, fatigue, mood, and daytime functioning."

Patients were ordered by their overall similarity concerning their multidimensional response profile, which comprises the overall response on MRC dyspnoea grade, 6MWD, cycle endurance time, Canadian Occupational Performance Measure performance and satisfaction scores, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale anxiety and depression, and St George's Respiratory Questionnaire total score, using a novel non-parametric regression technique.Patients were clustered into four groups with distinct multidimensional response profiles: n=378 (18.3%; ""very good responder""), n=742 (35.9%; ""good responder""), n=731 (35.4%; ""moderate responder""), and n=217 (10.5%; ""poor responder""). Patients in the ""very good responder"" cluster had higher symptoms of dyspnoea, number of hospitalisations <12 months, worse exercise performance, worse performance and satisfaction scores for problematic activities of daily life, more symptoms of anxiety and depression, worse health status, and a higher proportion of patients following an inpatient PR programme compared to the other three clusters.A multidimensional response outcome needs to be considered to study the efficacy of pulmonary rehabilitation services in patients with COPD, as responses to regular outcomes are differential within patients with COPD."

This study aimed to investigate the -1082G/A polymorphism association in LOD, AD patients and controls and also the peripheral expression of IL-10 in CD4+ T cells. It was done in a case-control study comparing immune system phenotype and genetic polymorphism association among control individuals, LOD and AD patients. Participants were 569 subjects composed the genetics sample (249 AD, 222 LOD and 98 controls) from a tertiary medical center based on Belo Horizonte, Brazil.

CD012347,0,20951018,0,Community based physiotherapeutic exercise in COPD self-management: a randomised controlled trial.,"Little is known about effects of community-based physiotherapeutic exercise programmes incorporated in COPD self-management programmes. In a randomised trial, the effect of such a programme (COPE-active) on exercise capacity and various secondary outcomes including daily activity as a marker of behaviour change was evaluated. All patients attended four 2-h self-management sessions. In addition the intervention group participated in the COPE-active programme offered by physiotherapists of private practices, consisting of a 6-month ""compulsory"" period (3 sessions/week) and subsequently a 5-month ""optional"" period (2 sessions/week). Because COPE-active was intended to change behaviour with regard to exercise, one session/week in both periods consisted of unsupervised home-based exercise training. Of 153 patients, 74 intervention and 68 control patients completed the one-year follow-up. Statistically significant between-group differences in incremental shuttle walk test-distance (35.1 m; 95% CI (8.4; 61.8)) and daily activity (1190 steps/day; 95% CI (256; 2125)) were found in favour of the intervention group. Over the 12-month period a significant difference of the chronic respiratory questionnaire (CRQ) dyspnoea-score (0.33 points; 95% CI (0.01; 0.64)) and a non-significant difference of the endurance shuttle walk test (135 m (95% CI (-29; 298)) was found. No differences were found in the other CRQ-components, anxiety and depression scores and percentage of fat free mass. This study demonstrates that a community-based reactivation programme improves exercise capacity in patients with moderately to severe COPD. Even more important, the programme improves actual daily activity after one-year which indicates behaviour change with regard to daily exercise. Registered trail number: ISRCTN81447311."

CD012347,0,23711812,0,Prevalence of depression in patients with chest pain and non-obstructive coronary artery disease.,"Many studies have demonstrated the prevalence of depression in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), but few have examined this relation in those with chest pain who do not have obstructive CAD on angiography. The aim of this study was to compare the prevalence of depression amongst patients with chest pain in the presence or absence of obstructive CAD and a healthy control group without chest pain. This prospectively designed, observational cohort study used 2 independent data sets: (1) The Queen Elizabeth Hospital Coronary Angiogram Database (n = 1,144), consisting of 819 patients with obstructive CAD and 325 patients with nonobstructive CAD (NoCAD), all of whom had chest pain and (2) the North West Adelaide Health Study (NWAHS; n = 3,168), a population-based biomedical cohort, from which patients with chest pain were excluded. The presence of depression was determined by a previously validated method using the Short Form 36. The prevalence of depression differed among the 3 groups, with 63% in those with NoCAD, 53% in those with CAD, and only 24% in the healthy NWAHS cohort. Analysis of the angiography cohort revealed age, gender, antidepressant medication, previous myocardial infarction, previous airway disease, Short Form 36 physical summary score, Seattle Angina Questionnaire physical limitation score, and NoCAD on angiography to be independent predictors of depression. In conclusion, these findings highlight the importance of screening for depression in patients with NoCAD."

Elderly patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and type II Diabetes Mellitus were recruited from 10 general practices. All eligible patients were screened. Twenty-nine patients with minor depression gave their informed consent to participate in this feasibility study. The nurses spent an average of 70 min per visit. Our intervention appeared feasible and acceptable to patients and nurses. For the nurses, it provided an additional tool for a well-known problem. The majority of the patients regarded the intervention as worthwhile and effective. Patients had difficulties in understanding the link between physical complaints and symptoms of depression. The intervention has been further improved on the basis of our experiences, and is now ready to be tested in an effectiveness study."
CD012347,0,12493646,0,Pulmonary function and health-related quality of life in survivors of acute respiratory distress syndrome.,"Although survival rates for acute respiratory distress syndrome have increased, there is only limited information regarding the quality of life and the relationship between quality of life and pulmonary function after survival. We prospectively measured pulmonary function, emotional function, and health-related quality of life in a cohort of acute respiratory distress syndrome survivors recruited from patients who were enrolled in a randomized clinical trial of high versus low tidal volume mechanical ventilation at 1 year after their recovery. No significant differences were found between the patients treated with high and low tidal volumes on any pulmonary function measure. Approximately 80% of the patients in both groups demonstrated reduced diffusing capacity; 20% had airflow obstruction, and 20% had chest restriction. Scores on measures of depression and anxiety were within the normal ranges, suggesting that they did not have significant affective symptoms. However, both groups reported decreased health-related quality of life in physical functioning, physical ability to maintain their roles (role-physical), bodily pain, general health, and vitality (energy) on the Medical Outcome Study Short Form Health Survey with similar physical limitations reported on the Sickness Impact Profile questionnaire. The pulmonary function abnormalities correlated with decreased health-related quality of life for domains reflecting physical function. Acute respiratory distress syndrome survivors treated with high and low tidal volumes have abnormal pulmonary function that was related to decreased health-related quality of life 1 year after hospital discharge."

Age and sex-matched 133 subjects with COPD exacerbation, 34 stable COPD subjects, and 34 non-COPD subjects were enrolled in this study. For the purpose of this study, mini-mental state examination (MMSE) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale were performed. Six-minute walk distance (6MWD) was recorded, and BODE index was calculated. COPD subjects with exacerbation had the lowest MMSE scores (p = 0.022). Frequency of subjects with MMSE score lower than 24 is 22.6, 8.8, and 8.8% in the COPD subjects with exacerbation, stable COPD, and non-COPD control subjects, respectively. The COPD subjects with exacerbation who had MMSE scores lower than 24 were older and less educated. Subjects with COPD exacerbation had shorter 6MWD than that of stable COPD and non-COPD subjects. After controlling for the impact of age and educational level on MMSE, there was no association between 6MWD and MMSE scores in subjects with COPD exacerbation. Cognitive impairment is an important comorbidity during COPD exacerbation. Functional capacity is also lower in exacerbation. However, no association was found between cognitive impairment and functional capacity during exacerbation."

CD012347,0,17136226,0,Bupropion.,"Bupropion was initially developed and licensed for the treatment of major depressive disorder in the United States in 1989. It was licensed as a pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation in the United States in 1997 and in the United Kingdom in 2000, and for the prevention of seasonal major depressive episodes in patients with seasonal affective disorder in the United States in 2006. Its main mechanism of action is believed to be via dopamine and noradrenalin reuptake inhibition. In addition to proven clinical efficacy for the treatment of major depression, the prevention of depressive episodes in patients with seasonal affective disorder, and as an aid to smoking cessation treatment, bupropion has demonstrated efficacy for attenuation of symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and more recently it has shown anti-inflammatory action against proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), which may be implicated in a number of inflammatory diseases such as Crohn's disease. The twice-daily sustained-release formulation has been extensively evaluated for smoking cessation and has shown continuous smoking abstinence rates at one year of the order of 20% across many clinical groups including healthy smokers, and smokers with cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive airways disease, depression and schizophrenia. Bupropion is well tolerated with side effects including insomnia, headache, dry mouth, dizziness and nausea. Bupropion is a cytochrome p450 2D6 inhibitor and care must be taken when coprescribing with drugs cleared by this enzyme and when coprescribing with drugs that lower seizure threshold. Despite the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of bupropion as an aid to smoking cessation, its uptake for this indication remains low when compared with nicotine replacement therapy."

Chronic medical illnesses weaken and demoralize patients and compromise their ability to adhere to treatments requiring consistency and effort. Acute medical illnesses create a psychosocial storm that finds patients and their ecosystem unprepared. We describe two intervention models that can be used to target and personalize treatment in depressed, chronically, or acutely medically ill older adults. The Personalized Adherence Intervention for Depression and COPD (PID-C) is a model intervention for depressed patients with chronic medical illnesses. It targets patient-specific barriers to treatment engagement and aims to shift the balance in favor of treatment participation. PID-C led to higher remission rates of depression, reduction in depressive symptoms, and reduction in dyspnea-related disability. The addition of problem-solving training enables patients to use resources available to them and hopefully improve their outcomes. Ecosystem-focused therapy (EFT) is a model intervention for depression developing in the context of an acute medical event. It was developed for patients with poststroke depression (PSD) and targets five areas, part of the ""psychosocial storm"" originating from the patient's sudden disability and the resulting change in the patient's needs and family's life. A preliminary study suggests that EFT is feasible and efficacious in reducing depressive symptoms and signs and disability in PSD."

CD012347,0,25339508,0,Exercise training combined with psychological interventions for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.,"Previous systematic reviews have confirmed the benefits of both exercise training and psychological interventions in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The objective of this systematic review was to examine the effect of interventions which combine exercise training and psychological interventions for a range of health outcomes in people with COPD. Database searches identified randomized controlled trials of people with COPD participating in interventions that combined exercise training with a psychological strategy compared with control (usual care, waiting list) or active comparators (education, exercise, psychological interventions alone). Health outcomes included dyspnoea, anxiety, depression, quality of life or functional exercise capacity. Standardized mean differences (SMD) were calculated for each intervention arm/control comparison. Across the 12 included studies (738 participants), compared with control conditions, SMD consistently favoured interventions which included both exercise + psychological components (SMD range dyspnoea -1.63 to -0.25; anxiety -0.50 to -0.20; depression -0.46 to -0.18; quality of life 0.09 to 1.16; functional exercise capacity 0.22 to 1.23). When compared with active comparators, SMD consistently favoured interventions that included exercise training + psychological component for dyspnoea (SMD range -0.35 to -0.97), anxiety (SMD range -0.13 to -1.00) and exercise capacity (SMD range 0.64 to 0.71) but were inconsistent for depression (-0.11 to 1.27) and quality of life (0.02 to -2.00). The magnitude of effect for most interventions was greater than the minimum required for clinical significance (i.e. > 0.32) in behavioural medicine. While interventions, outcomes and effect sizes differed substantially between studies, combining exercise training with a psychological intervention may provide a means of optimizing rehabilitation in people with COPD."

CD012347,0,23409736,0,Residual sleepiness in sleep apnea patients treated by continuous positive airway pressure.,"Hypoxic brain damage might explain persistent sleepiness in some continuous positive airway pressure-compliant obstructive sleep apnea called residual excessive sleepiness. Although continuous positive airway pressure may not be fully efficient in treating this symptom, wake-promoting drug prescription in residual excessive sleepiness is no longer allowed by the European Medicines Agency. The aim of this study is to describe residual excessive sleepiness phenotypes in a large prospective sample of patients with obstructive sleep apnea. Residual excessive sleepiness was defined by an Epworth Sleepiness Scale score ≥ 11. Eligible patients from the French National Sleep Registry attending follow-up continuous positive airway pressure visits numbered 1047. Patients using continuous positive airway pressure < 3 h (n = 275), with residual apnea-hypopnea index > 15 h⁻¹ (n = 31) or with major depression were excluded (n = 150). Residual excessive sleepiness prevalence in continuous positive airway pressure-treated obstructive sleep apnea was 13% (18% for those with an initial Epworth Sleepiness Scale score > 11), and significantly decreased with continuous positive airway pressure use (9% in ≥ 6 h night⁻¹ continuous positive airway pressure users, P < 0.005). At the time of diagnosis, patients with residual excessive sleepiness had worse subjective appreciation of their disease (general health scale, Epworth Sleepiness Scale and fatigue score), and complained more frequently of continuous positive airway pressure side-effects. Residual excessive sleepiness prevalence was lower in severe obstructive sleep apnea than in moderate obstructive sleep apnea (11% when AHI > 30 h⁻¹ versus 18% when AHI 15-30, P < 0.005). There was no relationship between residual excessive sleepiness and body mass index, cardiovascular co-morbidities or diabetes. Continuous positive airway pressure improved symptoms in the whole population, but to a lower extent in patients with residual excessive sleepiness (fatigue scale: -5.2 versus -2.7 in residual excessive sleepiness- and residual excessive sleepiness+ patients, respectively, P < 0.001). Residual excessive sleepiness prevalence decreased with continuous positive airway pressure compliance. Hypoxic insult is unlikely to explain residual excessive sleepiness as obstructive sleep apnea severity does not seem to be critical. Residual symptoms are not limited to sleepiness, suggesting a true 'continuous positive airway pressure-resistant syndrome', which may justify treatment by wake-promoting drugs."

CD012347,0,9769280,0,Analysis of clinical methods used to evaluate dyspnea in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.,"When dyspnea must be assessed clinically, there are three methods of assessment: the measurement of dyspnea with activities of daily living using clinical dyspnea ratings such as the modified Medical Research Council (MRC), the Baseline Dyspnea Index (BDI), and the Oxygen Cost Diagram (OCD); the measurement of dyspnea during exercise using the Borg scale; to assess the influence of dyspnea on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) using disease-specific questionnaires such as the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) and the Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire (CRQ). The purpose of the present cross-sectional study was to clarify relationships between dyspnea ratings and HRQoL questionnaires by applying factor analysis. One hundred sixty-one patients with mild to severe COPD completed pulmonary function tests, progressive cycle ergometer testing for exercise capacity, assessment of dyspnea, HRQoL, anxiety, and depression. Factor analysis demonstrated that the MRC, BDI, OCD, and Activity of the SGRQ, and Dyspnea of the CRQ, were grouped into the same factor, and the frequency distribution histograms of these five measures showed virtually the same distribution. The Borg scale at the end of maximum exercise was found to be a different factor. The MRC, BDI, OCD, and Activity in the SGRQ, and Dyspnea in the CRQ demonstrated the same pattern of correlation with physiologic data, and they had significant relationships with FEV1 (correlation coefficients [Rs] = 0.31 to 0. 48) and maximal oxygen uptake (Rs = 0.46 to 0.60). Disease-specific HRQoL questionnaires, the SGRQ and the CRQ, which contain a specific dimension for evaluating dyspnea, may be substituted for clinical dyspnea ratings in a cross-sectional assessment. Dyspnea rating at the end of exercise may provide further information regarding dyspnea."
CD012347,0,9692103,0,Effect of oral antibiotics on lung mucociliary clearance during exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.,"It has been well established that lung mucociliary clearance is depressed in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. This study examines whether oral antibiotics have a detectable effect on this clearance mechanism during exacerbation in patients with such disease. Twelve patients with a mean +/- SE age of 63 +/- 2 years participated in a randomized, double-blind, parallel group study to assess the effect of 1 week of treatment with amoxycillin (500 mg t.d.s.) or ciprofloxacin (500 mg b.d.) on lung mucociliary clearance during exacerbation. Lung mucociliary clearance rates were measured by a non-invasive radioaerosol technique. Both drugs on average resulted in small, non-significant, enhancement of mucociliary clearance. Following treatment, the numbers of coughs were reduced in both groups and significantly (P < 0.05) after treatment with ciprofloxacin. Sputum production was also significantly reduced (P < 0.01) in both groups. The magnitude of improvement in lung mucociliary clearance was relatively modest following 1 week of treatment with either antibiotic. Since the number of coughs was significantly less after ciprofloxacin treatment the measured enhancement of lung mucociliary transport is probably, however, an underestimate."

CD012347,0,11478537,0,Comorbid depressive symptomatology: isolating the effects of chronic medical conditions on self-reported depressive symptoms among community-dwelling older adults.,"Advances in medical technology and surgical knowledge have greatly extended the life expectancy of older individuals with chronic disabilities. Among the older adult population the prevalence of comorbid chronic illness and depressive symptoms has often been investigated. Yet there continues to be a lack of understanding about the consequences of specific chronic illnesses on depressive symptoms. Using cross-sectional data while simultaneously controlling the effects of various socioenvironmental, demographic, and other factors, this study analyzed the prevalence of self-reported depressive symptoms in relation to chronic illness. The cumulative effect of medical comorbidity and the specific effect of individual chronic illnesses were examined. The sample consisted of 359 older white Americans aged 55-93. Overall, the findings show that self-reports of depressive symptoms were greater among those individuals who also reported digestive disorders, respiratory ailments, and heart problems. These results suggest that for older white Americans these three chronic conditions may present a greater mental health burden than other chronic illnesses."
CD012347,0,27076585,0,Real-life assessment of the multidimensional nature of dyspnoea in COPD outpatients.,"Dyspnoea is a prominent symptom of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Recent multidimensional dyspnoea questionnaires like the Multidimensional Dyspnea Profile (MDP) individualise the sensory and affective dimensions of dyspnoea. We tested the MDP in COPD outpatients based on the hypothesis that the importance of the affective dimension of dyspnoea would vary according to clinical characteristics.A multicentre, prospective, observational, real-life study was conducted in 276 patients. MDP data were compared across various categories of patients (modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnoea score, COPD Assessment Test (CAT) score, Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) airflow obstruction categories, GOLD ""ABCD"" categories, and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)). Univariate and multivariate regressions were conducted to explore factors influencing the affective dimension of dyspnoea. Cluster analysis was conducted to create homogeneous patient profiles.The MDP identified a more marked affective dimension of dyspnoea with more severe mMRC, CAT, 12-item Short-Form Health Survey mental component, airflow obstruction and HADS. Multivariate analysis identified airflow obstruction, depressive symptoms and physical activity as determinants of the affective dimension of dyspnoea. Patients clustered into an ""elderly, ex-smoker, severe disease, no rehabilitation"" group exhibited the most marked affective dimension of dyspnoea.An affective/emotional dimension of dyspnoea can be identified in routine clinical practice. It can contribute to the phenotypic description of patients. Studies are needed to determine whether targeted therapeutic interventions can be designed and whether they are useful."

Ten older adults with serious mental illness (i.e., schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder, or major depressive disorder) and medical comorbidity (i.e., cardiovascular disease, obesity, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, and/or high cholesterol) aged 60 years and older received the PeerTECH intervention in their homes. Three certified peer specialists were trained to deliver PeerTECH. Data were collected at baseline, one-month, and three-month. The pilot study demonstrated that a three-month, peer-delivered and technology-supported integrated medical and psychiatric self-management intervention (""PeerTECH"") was experienced by peer specialists and participants as feasible and acceptable. PeerTECH was associated with statistically significant improvements in psychiatric self-management. In addition, pre/post, non-statistically significant improvements were observed in self-efficacy for managing chronic health conditions, hope, quality of life, medical self-management skills, and empowerment. This pre/post pilot study demonstrated it is possible to train peers to use technology to deliver an integrated psychiatric and medical self-management intervention in a home-based setting to older adults with serious mental illness with fidelity. These findings provide preliminary evidence that a peer-delivered and technology-supported intervention designed to improve medical and psychiatric self-management is feasible, acceptable, and is potentially associated with improvements in psychiatric self-management, self-efficacy for managing chronic health conditions, hope, quality of life, medical self-management skills, and empowerment with older adults with serious mental illness and chronic health conditions."

CD012347,0,17136950,0,Effect of treating depression on quality-of-life and exercise tolerance in severe COPD.,"The aim of this study was to determine whether treating concomitant depression improves quality of life and exercise tolerance in COPD patients. Out-patients with moderate to severe, stable COPD completed Hospital Anxiety-Depression (HAD) and General Health questionnaires. A psychiatrist interviewed those with high scores. In a randomised, double-blind fashion, 28 depressed COPD patients took a selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor, Paroxetine 20 mg daily, or matched placebo for 6 weeks. Subsequently, all patients took un-blinded Paroxetine for 3 months. From these questionnaires, 35% of 135 patients had significant depression, but this was confirmed by psychiatric interview in only 21%. Throughout the study, there were no changes in laboratory lung function nor in home peak flow. Six weeks' treatment produced no significant differences between placebo and treatment group in either depression, quality of life scores or 6-minute walking distances, although overall improvements in depression, correlated with increases in walking distance. Three months of un-blinded treatment, significantly improved depression scores (self-complete HAD, Beck's Depression and psychiatrist-completed Montgomery-Asberg scores), walking distances (369 to 427 m, p = 0.0003) and St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire Total Scores (65 to 58, p = 0.033). Although self-complete questionnaires over-diagnose depression, the condition is nevertheless common in patients with moderately severe COPD. Six weeks of antidepressants is insufficient to improve either depression, quality of life or exercise tolerance. However, our study suggests that a longer course of treatment may be effective and that improvements in depression are associated with improvements in exercise tolerance. A larger, double blind study with a longer treatment period is indicated."

CD012347,0,24381760,0,Psychological distress in women with chronic bronchitis in a fishing community in the niger delta region of Nigeria.,"Background. Biomass smoke exposure is a known risk factor for chronic bronchitis. Psychiatric comorbidities may have significant impact on the quality of life of patients with chronic bronchitis. Methods. Women who engage in fish preservation by drying over burning firewood in a fishing community were recruited for this survey. The British medical research questionnaire was used to determine chronic bronchitis, and psychological distress was determined using the hospital anxiety and depression scale. Results. A total of 342 women were recruited for this study and 63 of them had chronic bronchitis. 96 women had features suggestive of psychological distress: 57 (16.6%) women with anxiety, 51 (14.9%) women with depression and 12 women (3.5%) had combined features. Psychological distress was more common among women with chronic bronchitis. Anxiety was significantly associated with chronic bronchitis and the level of biomass exposure while depression was significantly associated with chronic bronchitis, level of exposure, and a history of sleeping in the fish smoking room. Conclusion. Anxiety and depression show significant association with chronic bronchitis among women with biomass smoke exposure with the level of exposure having an aggravating effect on the relationship."

CD012347,0,28629298,0,Anxiety and depression are improved by continuous positive airway pressure treatments in obstructive sleep apnea.,"Background Obstructive sleep apnea involves repeated nocturnal desaturation and sleep fragmentation that leads to poor sleep quality, anxiety, and depression. This study aimed to investigate short- and long-term improvements in the anxiety and depression of patients with different obstructive sleep apnea treatments. Methods This is a prospective, non-randomized hospital-based study evaluated 55 patients (46 male, 9 female) with obstructive sleep apnea. The patients were divided into three groups based on different treatment: uvulopalatopharyngoplasty group, continuous positive airway pressure group, and no treatment group (by their own decision). They completed the Beck Depression Inventory II, Beck Anxiety Inventory, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index before treatment and at one and six months after treatment. Results Compared to the no treatment group, the surgery and continuous positive airway pressure groups had higher body mass index, AHI, and Epworth sleepiness scale, but no difference in Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Chinese Health Questionnaire-12, Beck Depression Inventory II, and Beck Anxiety Inventory. The continuous positive airway pressure and surgery groups still had no improvements in Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Chinese Health Questionnaire-12, Beck Depression Inventory II, and Beck Anxiety Inventory scores one month after treatment. At six months after treatment, the continuous positive airway pressure group had significantly decreased Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Chinese Health Questionnaire-12, Beck Depression Inventory II, and Beck Anxiety Inventory, whereas the surgery group had significant difference in Beck Anxiety Inventory only and the no treatment group still had no significant difference in any of the parameters. Conclusions Continuous positive airway pressure can improve the sleep quality, quality of life, depression, and anxiety of obstructive sleep apnea patients after six months of treatment. However, surgery can significantly improve anxiety only in the same period."

The aim of this study was to examine the relationships between anxiety, depression and QoL of both Jordanian patients with COPD and their spouses. The selected design used in this study was a cross-sectional, descriptive, correlational design. A total of 67 patients and spouses were interviewed in 2011, using self-administered questionnaires. Descriptive statistical analysis was applied. Bivariate correlation analysis was undertaken to examine the relationship between variables. The results showed that patients and spouses with high levels of anxiety and depression reported a poor QoL. Patients had a lower QoL than their spouses. A better understanding of patient and spouse psychological wellbeing and QoL will provide nurses with the information needed in terms of developing strategies for reducing patients' and spouses' anxiety and depression and thus improve their QoL.

In this case-control study of 142 outpatients with COPD and 218 sex- and age-matched control subjects, COPD patients were recruited from a prospective study sample hospitalized in Hong Kong for acute COPD exacerbation (≥2 major COPD symptoms or >1 major+minor COPD symptoms for ≥2 consecutive days). Controls were recruited from social centres in Hong Kong. Activity of daily living was assessed with the Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scale, life events were evaluated using the Life Event Scale, depressive symptoms were ascertained with the Geriatric Depression Scale, and quality of life was measured using the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-12. Early, middle and late insomnia were measured using items 4, 5 and 6 of the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression. The frequency of ≥1 type of insomnia was 47.2% in patients and 25.7% in controls; frequencies of early, middle and late insomnia in patients were 24.6%, 31.0%, and 26.1%, respectively, compared to 14.7%, 14.7% and 11.9% in controls. Group differences were non-significant after controlling for relevant covariates. However, in multiple logistic regression analysis, more physical illnesses (p = 0.02, OR = 1.3, 95% CI = 1.1-1.7) and more severe depressive symptoms (p = 0.009, OR = 1.1, 95% CI = 1.03-1.3) were independently associated with any type of insomnia in COPD patients, accounting for 21.3% of the variance.

CD012347,0,11510808,0,Health-related quality of life in COPD: why both disease-specific and generic measures should be used.,"Although research has consistently demonstrated that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) impairs health-related quality of life (HRQL), little agreement has been evidenced regarding the factors identified as contributing to impaired HRQL. The aim was to study such factors using well established generic and specific HRQL instruments. The patients (n=68) were stratified by forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) to represent a wide range of disease severity. Pulmonary function, blood gases and 6-min walking distance test (6MWD) were assessed. HRQL instruments included: St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), Sickness Impact Profile (SIP), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and Mood Adjective Check List. The strength of the impact of COPD on HRQL was represented along a continuum ranging from lung function, functional status (physical and psychosocial) to wellbeing. Although correlations between FEV1 versus SGRQ total and SIP overall scores (r=-0.42 and -0.32) were stronger than previously reported, multiple regression analyses showed that lung function contributed little to the variance when dyspnoea-related limitation, depression scores and 6MWD were included in the models. These three factors were important to varying degrees along the whole range of HRQL. Physiological, functional and psychosocial consequences of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are only poorly to moderately related to each other. The present study concludes that a comprehensive assessment of the effects of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease requires a battery of instruments that not only tap the disease-specific effects, but also the overall burden of the disease on everyday functioning and emotional wellbeing."

Previous studies have found an association of psychological and physiological factors with dyspnea among patients with chronic obstructive airway diseases. However, symptom management of hospitalized patients with ILDs has been hampered by difficulty in priority, since they are often admitted with multiple psycho-physiological needs. This study examined the prevalence of dyspnea and the psycho-physiological factors associated with it among hospitalized Chinese patients with ILDs. We studied 165 hospitalized patients with ILDs recruited consecutively over three months in a public hospital in Guangzhou, China. Dyspnea and common psycho-physiological factors, including cough symptoms, activity capacity, lung function, physical and mental health status, and anxiety and depression symptoms, were measured. By ordered logistic regression, level of dyspnea statistically significantly affected performance in a six-minute walk test and physical functioning in work or other regular daily activities in hospitalized patients with ILDs. Respiratory rehabilitation with an appropriate intensity of exercise training or other strategies for enhancing the physical functioning of this population with moderate and severe levels of dyspnea should be prioritized."

All patients were investigated for depression, and the serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8) and Tumor Necrosis Factor-α (TNF-α) were measured. The factors that may affect COPD-related depression were analyzed.  RESULTS There were 40 (75.47%) patients with depression. There were differences in gender, smoking, time of cough, education, forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) and serum CRP levels between COPD patients with or without depression. In a univariate analysis, gender, smoking, education, FEV1, time of cough and serum CRP level were associated with depression. In a multivariate logistic regression model, serum CRP level and FEV1 were risk factors for depression.   CONCLUSIONS Male patients, heavy smoking, higher academic qualifications, cough, and high serum CRP level were linked to higher incidence rate of depression. High serum CRP level and low FEV1 were the risk factors for COPD-related depression."

This was a prospective clinical trial study. Patients with severe sleep apnea (40) were randomized into two groups. Multiple questionnaire investigation and laboratory evaluation were performed for ED, severity of OSAS and psychological status. Group 1 was treated with CPAP and group 2 was treated with only antidepressant medication for at least 1 month. Patients were evaluated after 1 month of therapy and compared with initial ones. Before CPAP, the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF)-5 scores were significantly correlated only with body mass index (BMI; P=0.007) and not correlated significantly with Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores (P=0.286), lowest SaO(2) (P=0.182), Beck's Depression Inventory scores (P=0.302) and apnea/hypopnea index (P=0.279). After 1 month of regular CPAP usage, mean value of IIEF-5 score was 15.71+/-5.12 before CPAP and were improved up to 19.06+/-3.94, statistically significant.

CD012347,0,18207055,0,Depression of chronic medical inpatients in China.,"Odds of major depression have significantly increased among adults with chronic diseases. However, the diagnosis of depression is often unrecognized in China. To know the prevalence of depression in medical inpatients with different chronic diseases and to assess the level of unrecognized depression among hospitalized patients, we assessed depression in patients with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and chronic pulmonary heart disease. In this study, it has been shown that 78.9% of patients with pulmonary heart disease, diabetes, hypertension, or coronary heart disease have different levels of depression. There were no significant differences in incidence of depression among different gender, age, education levels, marital status, or course of disease. There were no significant differences in total incidence rate of depression and in incidence rate of different levels of depression among the three groups of patients. It is very important to help patients with chronic diseases to reduce their depression by psychological nursing after evaluating their mental status."

CD012347,0,25239791,0,Can short-term heart rate variability be used to monitor fentanyl-midazolam induced changes in ANS preceding respiratory depression?,"Opioids have an occasional but high-risk side effect of respiratory depression. The detection of critical respiratory depression usually occurs after the event. Earlier detection would be beneficial in preventing increased morbidity and mortality of 0.01 % patients receiving analgesic opioids. Airway patency during inspiration requires vagal modulation. Regulation of the cardiovascular and respiratory centres may be coupled with a central mechanism that is indirectly measurable with heart rate variability (HRV). While opioids tend to increase parasympathetic tone, a decrease in airway stability could be due to a decrease in respiratory parasympathetic activity. Sympathetic arousal generated by apneic events may separately be recognised with short-term HRV. This pilot observational study examined the dynamic sympathovagal changes during fentanyl-midazolam induced respiratory depression on 10 subjects scheduled for minor surgery. A selection of HRV indices, able to work over sub-minute periods on non-stationary signals, were applied including a range of less common indices. Three analyses tested the effects: post-fentanyl, preceding the first central depression, and preceding obstruction of the upper airway. Statistical significance was assessed with overlap of bootstrap percentile confidence intervals for the median. A decrease in total variability, Lomb Total using the Lomb-Scargle method, is a positive finding for short-term HRV use in this study. No significant change before critical respiratory events was observed in traditional, spectral power, respiratory or other indices. One index, PolVar20, indicated a burst of sympathetic activity preceding respiratory depression similar to sleep apnoea arousals that restore airway patency. Before its usefulness in early detection of airway tone can be determined, PolVar20 requires further work: a statistical method for highly skewed distributions, auto adjustment for baseline variability, and detecting a range of sympathetic responses to apnea."

The CSES was translated into Norwegian according to standard procedures for forward and backward translation, and administered to 100 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (51% men, mean age 66.1 years, range 42-82) prior to their participation in an outpatient pulmonary rehabilitation programme. The CSES-N (translated version) consists of 34 items comprising five subscales describing negative affect, intense emotional arousal, physical exertion, weather/environment and behavioural risk factors. Each scale ranges from 1 to 5, with higher scores indicating better self-efficacy. For validation purposes, we measured lung function (FEV(1) , FEV(1) % predicted) and exercise capacity (ISWT), and administered the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). A pilot study confirmed that the CSES-N was clear, understandable and easy to self-administer. Cronbach's alpha was 0.98 for the total score (0.80-0.96 for subscales). Results showed small to medium negative correlations between all CSES-N scales and anxiety, depression (HADS), physical activity, psychosocial impact of disease and total health status (SGRQ) (-0.20 to -0.49). Small or negligible negative correlations between different CSES-N scales and respiratory symptoms (SGRQ) (-0.03 to -0.23) were found. Any correlations among exercise capacity, lung function and different socio-demographic variables (age, gender and education) and CSES-N were also small or negligible (0.00 to 0.23).

This prospective controlled study evaluates the effects of treatment with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) during 1 yr on daytime functioning in a large group of patients with SAS. The authors studied 80 patients (mean+/-sem 49+/-1 yrs) with SAS with a mean apnoea-hypopnoea index of 60+/-2 h-1, and 80 healthy control subjects matched for sex and age (46+/-1 yrs.). Measurements were obtained at the beginning of the study and 12+/-1 months later, and included: daytime sleepiness (Epworth scale), depression and anxiety (Beck tests), vigilance (Steer-Clear) and reaction time (Psychometer Vigilance Test 192). Drug, coffee and alcohol intake, as well as the sleep schedule, were also recorded. Results showed that, before treatment, patients were more somnolent (p<0.001), anxious (p<0.01) and depressed (p<0.001) than control subjects. Also, they had a longer reaction time (p<0.05) and poorer vigilance (p<0.01). The use of CPAP improved significantly the levels of somnolence (p<0.0001) and vigilance (p<0.01), but failed to modify anxiety and depression. Reaction time changes were minor. Variables with a potential confounding effect did not change during the study. These results provide firm evidence to substantiate the use of continuous positive airway pressure in patients with sleep apnoea syndrome."

CD012347,0,3361088,0,The medical evaluation of elderly patients with major depression.,"Elderly patients hospitalized for management of major depression frequently have an extensive medical evaluation to determine if physical illness is masquerading as, or serving as the precipitating event for, the depression. The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence of newly discovered medical problems and the yield of various diagnostic modalities in such elderly depressed patients. Of 100 depressed geropsychiatric inpatients, the most frequent new diagnoses included: electrolyte abnormalities (6 patients), bacteriuria (13), medication reactions (7), exacerbation of previous thyroid disease (6), new thyroid function abnormalities (3), and renal failure, Parkinson's Disease, and chronic obstructive lung disease (2 each). One patient had a cerebellar hemangioblastoma, and 4 had acute illnesses. A workup including CBC, blood chemistries, urinalysis, and thyroid function tests frequently yielded abnormal results. When used as screening tests, head CT scanning, electroencephalography, and chest radiography did not affect management. We conclude that elderly depressed patients have a high prevalence of undiscovered physical illnesses, but that history, physical examination, and simple laboratory evaluation may be sufficient to guide their workups."

This study uses human resources and health claims data from a large multi-site fully insured aluminum company to explore the health consequences of downsizing on the remaining workforce. We exploit the variation in the timing and intensity of layoff to categorize 30 plants as high or low layoff plants. Next, we select a stably employed cohort of workers with history of health insurance going back to 2006 to 1) describe the selection process into layoff and 2) explore the association between the severity of plant level layoffs and the incidence of four chronic conditions in the remaining workforce. We examine four health outcomes: incident hypertension, diabetes, asthma/COPD and depression for a cohort of approximately 13,000 employees. Results suggest that there was an increased risk of developing hypertension for all workers and an increased risk of developing diabetes for salaried workers that remain at the plants with the highest level of layoffs. The hypertension results were robust to a several specification tests. In addition, the study design selected only healthy workers, therefore our estimates are likely to be a lower bound and suggest that adverse health consequences of the 2007-2009 recession may have affected a broader proportion of the population than previously expected."

A cross-sectional analysis of HRQoL measures completed by patients enrolled in the Department of Veteran Affairs Ambulatory Care Quality Improvement Project. 1252 patients with chronic pulmonary disease screened positive for emotional distress and returned the Hopkins Symptom Checklist-20 (SCL-20). 733 of 1252 had a score of 1.75 or greater on the SCL-20 indicating significant depressive symptoms. Depressive symptoms were associated with statistically significantly worse general and pulmonary health as reflected by lower scores on all sub-scales of both the Medical Outcomes Short Form-36 and the Seattle Obstructive Lung Disease Questionnaire. In fact, 11% to 18% of the variance in physical function sub-scales was attributed to depressive symptoms alone. Patients with chronic pulmonary disease and depressive symptoms reported significantly more impaired functioning and worse health status when compared to those patients without depressive symptoms.

RES was defined by an Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) score of >or=11. In total, 502 patients from 37 French sleep centres using CPAP >3 h night(-1) attending their 1-yr follow-up visit were eligible. ESS and polysomnographic data as well as symptoms, quality of life, depression scores and objective CPAP compliance at 1 yr were collected. Overall, 60 patients remained sleepy on CPAP (ESS 14.3+/-2.5) leading to a prevalence rate of RES of 12.0% (95% confidence interval (CI) 9.1-14.8). After having excluded associated restless leg syndrome, major depressive disorder and narcolepsy as confounding causes, the final prevalence rate of RES was 6.0% (95% CI 3.9-8.01). Patients with RES were younger and more sleepy at diagnosis. The relative risk of having RES was 5.3 (95% CI 1.6-22.1), when ESS before treatment was >or=11. Scores of emotional and energy Nottingham Health Profile domains were two times worse in patients with RES.

The aims of this cross-sectional study were to describe the occurrence, intensity, locations, and level of interference associated with pain, as well as pain relief; to identify differences in demographic, clinical, and symptom characteristics between COPD patients with and without pain; and to determine which demographic, clinical, and symptom characteristics were associated with average pain, worst pain, and pain interference. A total of 258 patients with COPD provided information on demographic characteristics; comorbidities; respiratory parameters including dyspnea; body mass index; and symptom characteristics (i.e., anxiety, depression, sleep disturbance, and fatigue). Pain was measured using the Brief Pain Inventory. Of these 258 COPD patients, 157 (61%) reported pain. Multiple linear regression analyses were performed to determine which demographic, clinical, and symptom characteristics were associated with average pain severity, worst pain severity, and mean pain interference. Lower stages of COPD were associated with higher worst pain and higher pain interference scores. Higher depression scores were associated with higher average pain and higher pain interference scores. In addition, higher number of pain locations was associated with higher average and higher worst pain severity scores. Findings from this study confirm that pain is a significant problem and highlights the need for specific pain management interventions for patients with COPD.

This was a randomized, single-blind clinical trial conducted at two university hospitals in Granada, Spain. Forty-nine patients hospitalized due to AECOPD were randomly allocated to a control group (CG), in which patients received standard care, or to an intervention group (IG), in which patients were included in a multimodal therapeutic program, added to the standard care. The main outcome measures were pulmonary, physical (strength and exercise capacity) and perceived (dyspnea, quality of life and psychological distress) variables. Within-group significant improvements (p < 0.05) were found in physical and perceived variables in the IG after the treatment. In the CG, a significant decrease was found in lower limb strength and a significant improvement in dyspnea and in three subscales of the EuroQol-5D questionnaire. The between-groups analysis showed significant differences after the treatment on lower limb strength and exercise capacity values (p < 0.05), in three of the EuroQol-5D subscales, and in the total score and the depression subscale of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale.

Depression occurs commonly among COPD patients and an earlier diagnosis would be beneficial. This study investigated the associations between depression, sputum cytokines and salivary cortisol in COPD patients. The diurnal rhythms of sputum IL-1, IL-6, TNF-α and salivary cortisol were measured in COPD patients with depression compared to those only with depression, or COPD and healthy controls. The area under the diurnal variation curves (AUC) over the 24h time course and relative diurnal variation (VAR) were calculated while correlation and regression analysis were performed. Patients with co-morbid depression and COPD showed an increasing sputum IL-1, sputum TNF-α AUC and a decreasing salivary cortisol VAR (P<0.001). The combination of sputum TNF-α AUC, sputum IL-1 AUC, sputum IL-6 AUC and salivary cortisol VAR performed best as a potential biomarker in the diagnosis of depression in COPD patients, with a sensitivity of 94.74% and a specificity of 96.67%. Positive correlations were found between sputum IL-1 AUC and sputum TNF-α AUC versus depressive symptoms, respectively a negative correlation was found between salivary cortisol VAR and depression. They were independently associated with depression in logistic regression models. Depression in COPD is associated with higher 24-h overall levels of sputum IL-1, TNF-α and flattened diurnal salivary cortisol. These non-invasive sputum and salivary biomarkers may serve as a simple clinical tool for the early diagnosis of depression in COPD patients."
CD012347,0,23470990,0,Mood Predicts Response to Placebo CPAP.,"Study Objectives. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy is efficacious for treating obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), but recent studies with placebo CPAP (CPAP administered at subtherapeutic pressure) have revealed nonspecific (or placebo) responses to CPAP treatment. This study examined baseline psychological factors associated with beneficial effects from placebo CPAP treatment. Participants. Twenty-five participants were studied with polysomnography at baseline and after treatment with placebo CPAP. Design. Participants were randomized to either CPAP treatment or placebo CPAP. Baseline mood was assessed with the Profile of Mood States (POMS). Total mood disturbance (POMS-Total) was obtained by summing the six POMS subscale scores, with Vigor weighted negatively. The dependent variable was changed in apnea-hypopnea index (ΔAHI), calculated by subtracting pre- from post-CPAP AHI. Negative values implied improvement. Hierarchical regression analysis was performed, with pre-CPAP AHI added as a covariate to control for baseline OSA severity. Results. Baseline emotional distress predicted the drop in AHI in response to placebo CPAP. Highly distressed patients showed greater placebo response, with a 34% drop (i.e., improvement) in AHI. Conclusion. These findings underscore the importance of placebo-controlled studies of CPAP treatment. Whereas such trials are routinely included in drug trials, this paper argues for their importance even in mechanical-oriented sleep interventions."

Analyzing the data in a comparative table (a grid), we found that the prevalence of the 11 symptoms was often widely but homogeneously spread across the five diseases. Three symptoms-pain, breathlessness, and fatigue-were found among more than 50% of patients, for all five diseases. There appears to be a common pathway toward death for malignant and nonmalignant diseases. The designs of symptom prevalence studies need to be improved because of methodological disparities in symptom assessment and designs."

A two-stage mixed-methods study design was employed. Interviews with 15 individuals with COPD informed the choice of questionnaires to assess self-conscious emotions which were completed by individuals with COPD and healthy controls. Five overarching themes were abstracted: grief, spectrum of blame, concern about the view of others, concealment, and worry about the future. The questionnaires were completed by 70 patients (mean( SD) age 70.8(9.4) years, forced expiratory volume in one second predicted 40.5(18.8), 44% male) and 61 healthy controls (mean( SD) age 62.2(12.9) years, 34% male]. Self-conscious emotions were associated with reduced mastery, heightened emotions, and elevated anxiety and depression (all p < 0.001). Individuals with COPD reported lower self-compassion, higher shame, and less pride than healthy controls (all p ≤ 0.01). There is a need to increase awareness of self-conscious emotions in individuals with COPD. Therapies to target such emotions may improve mastery, emotions, and psychological symptoms."
CD012347,0,16279744,0,Increased risk of depression in COPD patients with higher education and income.,"This study examined potential modifying effects of income and education on the relationship between chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and depression. The analysis was based on 44,963 Canadians aged 35 years or more who participated in the Canadian National Population Health Survey in 1996-1997. Logistic regression analysis was used to examine the association between prevalence of depression and COPD according to sex, income adequacy or educational level. We used a bootstrap procedure to take sampling weights and design effects into account. People with COPD had twice the prevalence of depression compared to those without COPD. The association tended to be stronger in well-educated men [adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 3.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.04, 8.75] and women (OR = 2.60, 95% CI = 1.55, 4.38) than those less educated (men: OR= 1.19, 95% CI = 0.47, 3.05; women: OR = 1.93, 95% CI = 0.96, 3.87). An increased prevalence of depression associated with COPD was also found in women with higher household income (adjusted odds ratio = 4.57, 95% CI = 2.27, 9.19) than those with lower income. However, this pattern was not found in men. In conclusion, COPD patients with higher education are more likely to be depressed. The modifying effect of income may vary by gender. Possible reasons for these findings are explored."

Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is a possible factor. As deposition of glycosphingolipids in the upper airway muscles is likely, we hypothesized that obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is highly prevalent in FD and positively associated with its severity.All patients with FD who are followed in the Fabry cohort of the University Hospital Zurich (n = 62) were asked to participate in this prospective cohort study. Eligible patients were prospectively investigated by assessing their daytime sleepiness using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), the severity of FD using the Mainz Severity Score Index (MSSI), and by an ambulatory overnight respiratory polygraphy between November 1, 2013, and January 31, 2015. SDB was defined as an apnea/hypopnea index (AHI) of > 5/h.Fifty-two patients (mean ± SD age 42.8 ± 14.7 years, 33% men, mean ± SD BMI 23.4 ± 3.6 kg/m) with a median (IQR) MSSI of 12 (5-19) were included. Median (IQR) ESS was 6 (2-10) and 7 patients (14%) had an ESS > 10. Thirteen patients (25%) had SDB (78% obstructive sleep apnea, 22% central sleep apnea). In the multivariable analysis, the age was the only statistically significant predictor of SDB (OR 1.11, 95% CI 1.04-1.18, P = 0.001). ESS was associated with depression (P < 0.001) but not AHI nor age.This study shows that SDB, especially obstructive sleep apnea is highly prevalent in patients with Fabry disease.

A series of logistic regression analyses were conducted with a sample of 11,163 respondents aged 50+ from the 2012 Canadian Community Health Survey-Mental Health to determine the degree to which the direct association between COPD and GAD was attenuated by socio-demographic factors, social support, health behaviors, sleep problems, pain, functional limitations, and early childhood adversities. Additional analyses were completed using the sub-sample of those diagnosed with COPD (n = 746) to determine predictors of GAD. One in 17 (5.8%) of older individuals with COPD had past-year GAD, in comparison to 1.7% of those without (p < .001). The age-sex-race adjusted odds of GAD were four times higher for those with COPD compared to those without COPD (OR = 3.90, 95%CI: 2.64, 5.77). After full adjustment for 18 characteristics, these odds declined to 1.72 (95%CI: 1.10, 2.71). Factors associated with GAD among those with COPD include not having a confidant (OR = 7.85, 95%CI: 3.47, 17.75), exposure to parental domestic violence (OR = 5.63, 95% CI: 2.07, 15.34) and lifetime depressive disorders (OR = 3.59, 95% CI:1.61,7.98). Those with COPD have substantially higher odds of GAD even after most known risk factors for GAD are accounted for. These findings have implications for targeted outreach and screening, particularly for patients with pain and functional limitations. The importance of a multidisciplinary healthcare team is underscored by the multiple issues that may impact GAD among COPD patients."

Nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the gold standard treatment of OSAS. We aimed to evaluate the compliance of patients with severe OSAS to CPAP treatment and to compare the anxiety and depression scores before and at the 6th month of the treatment. Seventeen patients receiving CPAP treatment for OSAS that continued regular follow-up were accepted to the study. A questionnaire containing questions about demographic features, OSAS symptoms and Epworth sleepiness scale, Beck anxiety scale and depression scale was filled by the patients before and after CPAP treatment. Additionally, information concerning adverse effects of and compliance to CPAP treatment was obtained after CPAP treatment. Mean age of the patients was 48.4 +/- 8.4 (32-63); 14 (82.4%) of them were male and 3 (17.6%) of them were female. Snoring, witnessed apnea and excessive daytime sleepiness symptoms, and Epworth sleepiness scale scores were significantly decreased after CPAP treatment compared with those before treatment. Mean duration of CPAP device use at night was 5.6 +/- 2.1 (2-8) hours. Nine (52.9%) of the patients were using the device regularly every night and 8 (47.1%) of the patients were using it irregularly. The most frequent adverse effect of CPAP treatment was sore mouth, followed by mask discomfort and erythema on the nose. Anxiety and depression scores of the patients were significantly decreased after CPAP treatment compared with those before the treatment. As a conclusion, OSAS patients with high anxiety and depression scores benefit from CPAP treatment."

Hypoperfusion and impaired cerebral vasomotor reactivity lead to the development or progression of cerebral small vessel disease (C-SVD). Hypoxemia exacerbates these processes, resulting in white matter lesions, white matter integrity abnormalities, and gray matter loss. Blood-brain barrier (BBB) hyperpermeability and neuroinflammation lead to altered synaptic plasticity, neuronal damage, and worsening C-SVD. Thus, OSA may initiate or amplify the pathologic processes of C-SVD and BBB dysfunction, resulting in the development or exacerbation of depressive symptoms and cognitive deficits. Given the evidence that adequate treatment of OSA with continuous positive airway pressure improves depression and neurocognitive functions, it is important to identify OSA when assessing patients with depression or cognitive impairment. Whether treatment of OSA changes the deteriorating trajectory of elderly patients with already-diagnosed vascular depression and cognitive impairment/dementia remains to be determined in randomized controlled trials."
CD012347,0,17474645,0,Rehabilitation in a warm versus a colder climate in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a randomized study.,The primary aim of this study was to evaluate if pulmonary rehabilitation in a subtropical climate during winter had better long-term effects on health-related quality of life and symptoms of anxiety and depression than an equivalent pulmonary rehabilitation program in a colder climate. The secondary aim was to assess short-term differences in the same outcomes.
CD012347,0,11110109,0,Functional impairment in COPD patients: the impact of anxiety and depression.,"The authors examined the relationship between functional status and comorbid anxiety and depression and the relationship between utilization of health care resources and psychopathology in elderly patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Elderly male veterans (N = 43) with COPD completed anxiety, depression, and functional status measures. The authors constructed regression models to explore the contribution of COPD severity, medical burden, depression, and anxiety to the dependent variables of functional impairment and health care utilization. Anxiety and depression contributed significantly to the overall variance in functional status of COPD patients, over and above medical burden and COPD severity, as measured by the 8 scales of the Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) 36-item Short Form Health Survey. Surprisingly, medical burden and COPD severity did not contribute significantly to overall variance in functional status. Few patients were receiving any treatment for anxiety or depression."

CD012347,0,26051244,0,A systematic review of barriers to optimal outpatient specialist services for individuals with prevalent chronic diseases: what are the unique and common barriers experienced by patients in high income countries?,"Health utilization and need assessment data suggest there is considerable variation in access to outpatient specialist care. However, it is unclear if the types of barriers experienced are specific to chronic disease groups or experienced universally. This systematic review provides a detailed summary of common and unique barriers experienced by chronic disease groups when accessing and receiving care, and a synthesized list of possible health service initiatives to improve equitable delivery of optimal care in high-income countries. Quantitative articles describing barriers to specialist outpatient services were retrieved from CINAHL, MEDLINE, Embase, and PyscINFO. To be eligible for review, studies: were published from 2002 to May 2014; included samples with cancer, diabetes mellitus, osteoporosis, arthritis, ischaemic heart disease, stroke, asthma, chronic pulmonary disorder (COPD) or depression; and, were conducted in high-income countries. Using a previously validated model of access (Penchansky and Thomas' model of fit), barriers were grouped according to five overarching domains and defined in more detail using 33 medical subject headings. Results from reviewed articles, including the scope and frequency of reported barriers, are conceptualized using thematic analysis and framed as possible health service initiatives. A total of 3181 unique records were screened for eligibility, of which 74 studies were included in final analysis. The largest proportion of studies reported acceptability barriers (75.7 %), of which demographic disparities (44.6 %) were reported across all diseases. Other frequently reported barriers included inadequate need assessment (25.7 %), information provision (32.4 %), or health communication (20 %). Unique barriers were identified for oncology, mental health, and COPD samples. Based on the scope, frequency and measurement of reported barriers, eight key themes with associated implications for health services are presented. Examples include: common accommodation and accessibility barriers caused on service organization or physical structure, such as parking and appointment scheduling; common barriers created by poor coordination of care within the healthcare team; and unique barriers resulting from inadequate need assessment and referral practices. Consideration of barriers, across and within chronic diseases, suggests a number of specific initiatives are likely to improve the delivery of patient-centered care and increase equity in access to high-quality health services."

CD012347,0,26481941,0,Selective Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors for Psoriasis: Focus on Apremilast.,"Phosphodiesterase (PDE) 4 participates in regulating the inflammatory response by degrading cyclic adenosine 3'5'-monophosphate (cAMP), a key second messenger. Inhibition of PDE4 increases the intracellular cAMP level, which in turn results in a reduction in inflammatory mediators and an increase in anti-inflammatory mediators. Immune-modulating effects of PDE4 inhibitors have been investigated in a number of inflammatory conditions, such as asthma, atopic dermatitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Behçet’s disease, psoriasis, and psoriatic arthritis. Apremilast, a selective PDE4 inhibitor, has been shown to block the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (interferon-γ, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin [IL]-12, IL-17, and IL-23), which are the key players in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. Increased intracellular cAMP levels result in a range of anti-inflammatory effects on numerous cell lines. A decrease in proinflammatory activity has been shown to result in a reduced psoriasiform response in preclinical in vivo models of psoriasis, and reduction of biologic activity in a pilot study in humans. The efficacy and safety of apremilast in the treatment of psoriasis have been demonstrated in phase II and III clinical trials. Apremilast demonstrated efficacy in reducing the severity of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. Treatment with apremilast was well tolerated, with generally mild gastrointestinal complaints, which occurred early in the course of the treatment and resolved over time, and there was no requirement for laboratory test monitoring. These results make apremilast an attractive therapeutic option for plaque psoriasis."

The diagnostic accuracy of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and risk factors for comorbid depression in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are addressed. Consecutive COPD patients (GOLD stage I-IV, 40-75 years old) were enrolled in a multicentre, cross-sectional cohort study. Diagnosis of depression was ascertained through clinical records. Lung function, HADS score, 6-minute walking test (6-MWT), MRC dyspnoea score, and COPD Assessment Test (CAT) were evaluated. Two hundred fifty-nine COPD patients (mean age 62.5 years; 32% female; mean FEV1 48% predicted) were included. Patients diagnosed with depression (29/259; 11.2%) had significantly higher HADS-D and HADS-Total scores than nondepressed patients (median (quartiles) HADS-D 6 [4; 9] versus 4 [2; 7], median HADS-Total 14 [10; 20] versus 8 [5; 14]). Receiver-operating characteristic plots showed moderate accuracy for HADS-D, AUC 0.662 (95%CI 0.601-0.719), and HADS-Total, AUC 0.681 (95%CI 0.620-0.737), with optimal cut-off scores of >5 and >9, respectively. Sensitivity and specificity were 62.1% and 62.6% for HADS-D compared to 75.9% and 55.2% for HADS-Total. Age, comorbidities, sex, and lower airflow limitation predicted depression. The HADS exhibits low diagnostic accuracy for depression in COPD patients. Younger men with comorbidities are at increased risk for depression."

CD012347,0,9428297,0,Subjective symptomatology of asthma: validation of the asthma symptom checklist in an outpatient Spanish population.,"The objective of this study was to validate the Asthma Symptom Checklist (ASC) so that it could be reliably used to assess the subjective symptomatology of asthma attacks in our context. Subjective symptomatology of asthma was examined in a group of 100 adult Spanish outpatients (57 women, 43 men; 17-69 years of age) with asthma. All of them completed the modified version of the ASC as well as questionnaires of depression, anxiety, and self-management of asthma (self-efficacy expectancies and health care utilization). Data about duration and severity of asthma, as well as dyspnea and %FEV1, were also recorded. The highest reliability Cronbach alpha indexes were for the panic-fear and fatigue scales. The oblique rotation of the ASC revealed five correlated factors (53% of the total variance explained): 1) panic-fear, 2) airways obstruction, 3) airways obstruction and panic-fear, 4) fatigue and irritability, 5) hyperventilation. The structure of factors was revalidated using orthogonal (varimax) rotation. Construct validity was examined by Person product-moment coefficient correlations, ANOVAs (asthma severity x ASC scores), and t-tests (sex by ASC scores). Panic-fear showed the best construct validity, as it was related to the severity of the asthma and the use of high-cost health care resources. There were no differences in ASC scores either on the basis of the asthma severity or on the sex of patients. The ASC factors represent stable components of subjective symptomatology of asthma attacks, especially with regard to the panic-fear and the hyperventilation subscales; however, the structure of the checklist as a whole was not identical to those reported in other studies. Correlations of the ASC with clinical variables related to asthma severity support the construct validity of the instrument and confirm its utility to evaluate the subjective symptomatology of asthma attacks in outpatients."

We assessed the associations of chronotype with health status in the general Finnish adult population. Our population-based data were derived from the National FINRISK 2012 study and consisted of 4414 participants, aged 25-74 years, living in Finland. As part of their health examination, participants were asked about their circadian preference to the daily activities (morningness-eveningness) and a diagnosis or treatment for a set of common noncommunicable medical conditions and chronic diseases during the past 12 months. We found that there were 1935 (43.8%) morning types (MTs) and 595 (13.5%) evening types (ETs) and that 1884 (42.7%) were intermediates. As compared with the MTs, the ETs had significantly greater odds for depression (OR = 2.44, 95% CI = 1.52-3.90, p < 0.001) and other mental disorders (OR = 5.18, 95% CI = 2.32-11.52, p < 0.001). The odds were also increased for gallstones, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, but these did not remain significant after controlling for multiple testing. Responses to the single-item subjective estimation on the chronotype yielded the association of the definitely evening type of persons with the diagnosis or treatment of cardiac insufficiency (OR = 1.99, 95% CI = 1.02-3.88, p = 0.044) that was corroborated as the greater the eveningness score was, the more common the diagnosis or treatment of cardiac insufficiency was (β = 0.92, 95% CI = 0.85-0.98, p = 0.013).

Longitudinal studies are affected by disease progression, the increased package of care (with LTOT) and may not control for known confounders on mood. We compared the point prevalence and severity of mood disturbance in patients with severe COPD, not on LTOT (the -LTOT group) to those with COPD on LTOT (the +LTOT group). We mailed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD) Score to 182 consecutive patients with severe COPD, identified from respiratory case notes in three UK Hospitals. We compared 57 patients not prescribed LTOT to 57 patients on LTOT, and used stratified sampling to match the groups as far as possible for age, gender, lung function and other possible confounders on mood. Or these, 25% of patients in both groups scored in the 'definite' case range for anxiety (HAD score >or= 11). 37% of the -LTOT group and 33% of the +LTOT group scored in the 'definite' range for depression (HAD score >or= 11) (p=N.S). In both groups, only 11% of responders were prescribed anxiolytics and/or antidepressants. Further multiregression analysis confirmed that socio-demographic variables (e.g., lives alone, feels isolated or recent life events) were stronger predictors of mood than the prescription of LTOT or other traditionally accepted factors such as co-morbidity or the use of antidepressants or anxiolytics. High levels of anxiety and depression are present in severe COPD and appear under-treated. The +LTOT and -LTOT patients had a similar high prevalence of anxiety and depression."

Aim of our study was to examine the effects of BOS on health related quality of life (HRQL) in lung transplantation patients. Data on HRQL from 29 patients who developed BOS at least 18 months earlier were studied longitudinally. HRQL measures were: the Nottingham Health Profile (NHP), the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), the Self-rating Depression Scale (ZUNG), and the Index of Well Being (IWB). Furthermore questions concerning activities of daily life and dyspnea were asked. The majority of the patients were male, and the most common diagnosis was emphysema. After the onset of BOS, significantly more restrictions were reported on the dimensions energy and mobility of the NHP. These restrictions appeared to increase over time. After the onset of BOS, STAI scores remained more or less stable and close to the value of the general population. ZUNG scores were significantly higher after the onset of BOS, and patients experienced a lower level of well being than the general population. The percentage of patients that reported to be able to perform activities of daily life without effort declined dramatically after the onset of BOS. Furthermore, the percentage of patients complaining of dyspnea increased after the onset of BOS. In conclusion, our study showed that HRQL was negatively affected by the onset of BOS. However, in spite of these less favorable long-term results, even patients who develop BOS may at least temporarily benefit from a lung transplantation."
CD012347,0,6306086,0,Right ventricular ejection fraction: an indicator of increased mortality in patients with congestive heart failure associated with coronary artery disease.,"The predictive value of radionuclide ventriculography was studied in 34 patients with depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (less than 40%) and clinically evident congestive heart failure secondary to atherosclerotic coronary artery disease. In addition to left ventricular ejection fraction, right ventricular ejection fraction and extent of left ventricular paradox were obtained in an attempt to identify a subgroup at increased risk of mortality during the ensuing months. The 16 patients who were alive after a 2 year follow-up period had a higher right ventricular ejection fraction and less extensive left ventricular dyskinesia. When a right ventricular ejection fraction of less than 35% was used as a discriminant, mortality was significantly greater among the 21 patients with a depressed right ventricular ejection fraction (71 versus 23%), a finding confirmed by a life table analysis. Depressed right ventricular function was further linked to more severely compromised left ventricular function, as confirmed by a greater reduction in left ventricular ejection fraction and by an increased extent of left ventricular dyskinesia. These patients had a greater prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and previous inferior myocardial infarction but the differences between groups were not statistically significant. It appears that the multiple factors contributing to the reduction in right ventricular ejection fraction make it a useful index not only for assessing biventricular function, but also for predicting patient outcome."

This paper presents the findings from a psychometric test for the measurement of anxiety and depression (AD-R Scale) administered at the start and end of a rehabilitation program in patients with cardiopulmonary disease. The study population consisted of 765 patients affected by cardiac and pulmonary disease undergoing an in-hospital course of intensive rehabilitation. We observed that AD-R scores are related to sex, age and diseases. Among anxiety and depression scores there are statistically significant differences regarding sex: women achieved higher AD-R scores compared with men. Depression scores are influenced by age: younger subjects reached lower scores compared with the older ones. Among patients with respiratory disease, the subjects affected by chronic respiratory failure showed statistically significant higher depression scores compared to subjects affected by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and bronchial asthma. Anxiety and depression scores among subjects affected by cardiac diseases did not show important differences. At the end of the multidisciplinary rehabilitation program, a significant reduction in both anxiety and depression scores was observed, compared to values at the start, particularly for those that, at the beginning of the rehabilitation program, reached clinically remarkable AD-R scores and in general for the youngest subjects. The paper also presents the means, standard deviations and percentile range of scores for anxiety and depression in the population studied, according to age, sex, underlying pathology or hospital division. The Scale AD-R appears to be a valid instrument for the screening of patients undergoing cardio-pulmonary rehabilitation and as an outcome index."

Methods An open, uncontrolled trial (feasibility study) was conducted among patients treated in Montreal family practices. Eligible patients were aged 40 years or over, had one or more of the targeted chronic physical illnesses for at least 6 months (arthritis, hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) and were evaluated as having at least mild depressive symptoms (a score of ≥ 5 on the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire, PHQ-9). Participants received a package of six self-care tools (information booklet, video, Internet programme, action plan, workbook and mood-monitoring tool) with telephone support by a lay coach for up to 6 months. Results In total, 63 eligible patients provided written consent and completed the baseline interview; 57 (90%) and 55 (87%) patients completed 2-month and 6-month follow-up interviews, respectively. The mean number of telephone calls made by coaches to participants was 10.5 (SD 4.0), and the average length of these calls was 10.6 minutes. At the 6-month follow-up, 83.6% of the participants reported that one or more of the tools were helpful. Clinically significant improvements were seen in depressive symptoms (as assessed by the PHQ-9) at 6 months, with an effect size of 0.88 (95% CI, 0.55, 1.14). Conclusion A telephone-supported self-care intervention for depression was feasible, was acceptable to patients, and was associated with a significant 6-month improvement in depressive symptoms. A randomised trial of this intervention is justified."

CD012347,0,15911926,0,Acupuncture: role in comprehensive cancer care--a primer for the oncologist and review of the literature.,"In recent studies, patients have reported an increased use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). Acupuncture is a popular complementary therapy for patients with cancer. This article will provide current cancer treatment providers with information on acupuncture as well as the research conducted on cancer symptoms and side effects of cancer treatments. Antiemetic studies are the most prevalent and contain the most promising results. Several studies have found that acupuncture significantly reduces the number of emesis (vomiting) episodes for patients receiving chemotherapy. While studies on pain control vary due to the heterogeneity of pain, there are few studies investigating pain caused from cancer and the removal of cancerous tumors. These studies, while promising, provide basic results that need further investigation for more definitive results. Although relatively few studies have been done on anxiety and depression, several researchers have found acupuncture to be just as effective as or more effective than antidepressants for patients without cancer. Studies on breathlessness, while small, have shown acupuncture to have a significant positive effect on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, breathlessness associated with end-stage cancer, and asthma. Researchers studying xerostomic individuals who have received salivary gland irradiation found significant positive results in salivary flow rates compared to baseline. Patients with hot flashes due to hormonal imbalance may benefit from the use of acupuncture. A recent pilot study showed improvement of chronic postchemotherapy fatigue following acupuncture treatments. Many individuals with cancer have turned to acupuncture because their symptoms persisted with conventional treatments or as an alternative or complement to their ongoing treatments. Despite the immense popularity in the community, few large randomized trials have been conducted to determine the effects acupuncture has on cancer symptoms and side effects of treatments. A majority of the current studies have shown beneficial effects that warrant further investigation with large trial sizes."

CD012347,0,20854045,0,Improving quality of life in depressed COPD patients: effectiveness of a minimal psychological intervention.,"Depression and anxiety are highly prevalent in elderly COPD patients. Since symptoms of depression and anxiety reduce quality of life in these patients, treatments aimed at improving mental health may improve their quality of life. This study evaluated the effectiveness of a nurse-led Minimal Psychological Intervention (MPI) in reducing depression and anxiety, and improving disease-specific quality of life in elderly COPD patients. In a randomized controlled trial an MPI was compared with usual care in COPD patients. COPD patients aged 60 years or over, and with minor or mild to moderate major depression were recruited in primary care (n = 187). The intervention was based on principles of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and self-management. Outcomes were symptoms of depression, symptoms of anxiety, and disease-specific quality of life, assessed at baseline and at one week and three and nine months after the intervention. Results showed that patients receiving the MPI had significantly fewer depressive symptoms (mean BDI difference 2.92, p = 0.04) and fewer symptoms of anxiety (mean SCL difference 3.69, p = 0.003) at nine months than patients receiving usual care. Further, mean SGRQ scores were significantly more favourable in the intervention group than in the control group after nine months (mean SGRQ difference 7.94, p = 0.004). To conclude, our nurse-led MPI reduced symptoms of depression and anxiety and improved disease-specific quality of life in elderly COPD patients. The MPI appears to be a valuable addition to existing disease-management programmes for COPD patients."

Prior to treatment, MMPI results for 23 patients showed significant elevations (p < .01) on five clinical scales compared to those of 17 normal controls. Apneics' personality patterns were predominantly of a ""neurotic-mixed"" type, indicating an anxiety reaction with paranoid features. Depression, schizophrenia, and hypochondriasis were the highest scales. Most patients had severe psychosocial maladjustment. In the follow-up study during the NCPAP treatment, there was a progressive reduction of the psychopathological signs along with a generalized improvement in psychosocial adaptation. These changes were remarkably significant after about a year's treatment, in particular for depression (p < .01) and total adjustment degree (p < .01). It was concluded that severe OSA is associated with serious psychosocial alterations that improve gradually with NCPAP."

CD012347,0,16713225,0,Longitudinal deteriorations in patient reported outcomes in patients with COPD.,"Goals of effective management of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) include relieving their symptoms and improving their health status. We examined how such patient reported outcomes would change longitudinally in comparison to physiological outcomes in COPD. One hundred thirty-seven male outpatients with stable COPD were recruited for the study. The subjects health status was evaluated using the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) and the Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire (CRQ). Their dyspnoea using the modified Medical Research Council (MRC) scale and their psychological status using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) were assessed upon entry and every 6 months thereafter over a 5-year period. Pulmonary function and exercise capacity as evaluated by peak oxygen uptake (VO2) on progressive cycle ergometry were also followed over the same time. Using mixed effects models to estimate the slopes for the changes, scores on the SGRQ, the CRQ, the MRC and the HADS worsened in a statistically significant manner over time. However, changes only weakly correlated with changes in forced expiratory volume in 1s (FEV(1)) and peak (VO2). We demonstrated that although changes in pulmonary function and exercise capacity are well known in patients with COPD, patient reported outcomes such as health status, dyspnoea and psychological status also deteriorated significantly over time. In addition, deteriorations in patient reported outcomes only weakly correlated to changes in physiological indices. To capture the overall deterioration of COPD from the subjective viewpoints of the patients, patient reported outcomes should be followed separately from physiological outcomes."

We utilized data from the MEDALZ-2005 cohort, which includes all community-dwelling individuals diagnosed with AD in Finland at the end of 2005 and matched comparison individuals without AD. Register-based data included prescription drug purchases, comorbidities, and hospital discharge diagnoses. In this study, 24,966 individuals with AD and 24,985 individuals without AD were included. During the 4-year follow-up, we found that 45% (N = 11,312) of individuals with AD and 38% (N = 9534) of individuals without AD used BZDRs. The prevalence of long-term (≥ 180 days) BZDR use was more common among individuals with AD (30%) than individuals without AD (26%). The median durations of the first long-term use periods of BZDRs were 1.5 and 2 years for individuals with and without AD, respectively. Factors associated with long-term BZDR use included female sex, AD, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, coronary artery disease, and asthma/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The high prevalence of long-term BZDR use among individuals with AD is especially a cause for concern because long-term use may further impair cognition and may be associated with serious adverse events."

A cross-sectional design was employed to study sleep problems, CVD, general health, psychosocial factors, and medication use. The subjects were participants in the Cardiovascular Health Study, which included 5,201 adults, aged 65 and older, who were recruited from a random sample of Medicare enrollees in four U.S. communities. Study measures employed were sleep questions, echocardiography, carotid ultrasound, resting electrocardiogram, cognitive function, cardiopulmonary symptoms and diseases, depression, independent activities of daily living (IADLs), and benzodiazepine use. Thirty-three percent of the men and 19% of the women reported loud snoring, which was less frequent in those over age 75. Snoring was positively associated with younger age, marital status, and alcohol use in men, and obesity, diabetes, and arthritis in women. Snoring was not associated, however, with cardiovascular risk factors or clinical CVD in men or women. Observed apneas were reported much less frequently (13% of men and 4% women) than snoring, and they were associated with alcohol use, chronic bronchitis, and marital status in men. Observed apneas were associated with depression and diabetes in women. In both men and women, daytime sleepiness was associated with poor health, advanced age, and IADL limitations. The conclusions of the study were that loud snoring, observed apneas, and daytime sleepiness are not associated cross-sectionally with hypertension or prevalent CVD in elderly persons."
CD012347,0,2941471,0,Depression and physical illness among elderly general medical clinic patients.,"In this study we conducted a resurvey at 33 months of elderly general medical clinic outpatients previously classified as depressed or not using the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale. Resurvey results and review of medical records permitted characterization of the point prevalences of depression at the time of the initial and follow-up surveys, and identification of physical illness factors associated with depression. The point prevalences of depression were approximately equal (20%), although only about 10% were depressed at both occasions. Among the initially nondepressed, the number of new physical diagnoses during follow-up was the best predictor of depression at retest. Other factors associated with depression at one or both occasions were: alcohol abuse, obstructive pulmonary disease, and a relatively greater number of medical diagnoses. Thus, among elderly outpatients, depression appears common with roughly equal rates of remission and incidence; also, new medical illness may precipitate depression."

The study included 190 participants, aged 85-103 years. Linear correlation analysis was used for relationships between SOC scores and continuous variables. The effects of SOC score on 1- and 4-year mortality, as well as on depression at the 5-year follow-up, were investigated using Cox regression models. The mean SOC score was 71.8±10.2 (±S.D.). SOC score was positively related to well-being (p≤0.001). Heart failure (p=0.009), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (p=0.015), depression (p=0.015), and osteoarthritis (p=0.032) were significantly associated with low SOC scores, as were high scores on the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) (p=0.002). One-year mortality was significantly associated with the SOC score (OR=0.945, confidence interval (CI)=0.898-0.995, p=0.032), while the 4-year mortality was not (OR=0.995, CI=0.973-1.018, p=0.674). The SOC score did not predict depression at 5-year follow-up (OR=0.977, CI=0.937-1.018, p=0.267). Strong SOC was associated with well-being in this group of old people. Low SOC was found among those with diseases known to have a negative influence on daily life."
CD012347,0,22348927,0,Psychosocial condition of family caregivers of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in Hong Kong.,"OBJECTIVES. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is associated with physical and psychological burdens. Although there is research about health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of such patients, less is known about the psychosocial condition of their family caregivers. The objectives of this study were to examine the HRQOL and the burden of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patient caregivers, and to identify associated relevant factors. METHODS. A total of 81 eligible caregivers completed a caregiver survey on HRQOL (Short Form-36 Questionnaire), caregiving burden (Cumulative Illness Rating Scale, CIRS) and other biopsychosocial factors. Descriptive statistics, correlations, and multiple linear regression models were used to analyse data. RESULTS. The caregiver's Mental Component Summary measure of the Short Form-36 was associated with each caregiver's total CIRS scores, the anxiety subscale of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and the Lubben Social Network Scale. The caregiver's Physical Component Summary measure was associated with the patient's disability allowance, the caregiver's total CIRS score, and the Barthel Index score. Caregivers' Caregiving Burden Scale scores were associated with their Geriatric Depression Scale total score and the need to take care of other family members. CONCLUSIONS. This study demonstrates that depressive and anxiety symptoms are associated with caregivers' burden and HRQOL. Further studies on evaluating interventions on caregivers' HRQOL and burden should take mood symptoms into consideration."

Eighty-five older patients completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire, the Posttraumatic Stress Diagnostic Scale and the Medical Outcomes Short Form 12. The results showed that 55, 39 and 6 % had no, partial and full-PTSD respectively. Partial least squares showed that PTSD was significantly correlated with COPD severity which in turn was significantly correlated with health-related quality of life and psychiatric co-morbidity. Mediational analysis showed that the emotional symptoms of COPD mediated between PTSD and the mental health functioning of health-related quality of life and between PTSD and depression. To conclude, PTSD from past trauma was related to the severity of COPD for older patients. In particular, it impacted on the elevated emotional arousal of COPD severity. In turn, COPD severity impacted on older patients' general psychological well-being and depression."

This study was conducted to investigate if there are any predictors signaling low compliance prior to initiation of CPAP-therapy. We used an open label longitudinal cohort study at an University hospital in-patient Sleep laboratory setting. In 85 consecutive patients with a diagnosis of OSAS confirmed by polysomnography a CPAP-therapy was initiated. Prior to CPAP-titration the subjects were interviewed using standardized, validated questionnaires (Nottingham Health Profile, von Zerssen's Depression Scale, State Trait Anxiety Inventory, IPC-Scale). On follow up (mean 16 +/- 8 month) 66 patients were still using CPAP regularly, 19 individuals had discontinued the therapy. Data of both groups were compared. There were no significant differences in polysomnographic parameters before CPAP except apnea-hypopnea-index (users: 30.72 +/- 20.68, rejecters: 18.43 +/- 10.43) and mean oxygen saturation (users: 91.65 +/- 3.32, rejecters 93.63 +/- 1.86). Depression and anxiety levels were normal in both groups. The subjects who discontinued CPAP had a significantly less external control belief. Internal control belief was normal in all patients. It is suggested that individuals who discontinued CPAP could not be convinced of the necessity of CPAP by physicians or nurses due to their reduced external control belief. Identifying patients with diminished external control belief prior to prescription of a device might be useful. In selected subgroups, different methods of motivation to maintain long-term acceptance for CPAP-therapy seems to be necessary."

The aim of this study was to elucidate the role of the immune system alterations in pathogenesis of depression in COPD patients. Blood was collected from patients diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and comorbid depressive symptoms [COPD + DS, (N = 13)], from individuals with either COPD (N = 16) or recurrent depressive disorder (rDD) alone (N = 15), and from healthy controls (N = 19). Surface phenotype expression of T regulatory and T effector cells was analyzed with a flow cytometry, and IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IFN-γ, IL-17, and neopterin were detected with ELISA. We demonstrated that COPD, depression, and COPD with comorbid depression are associated with increased IL-6 levels when compared with healthy controls 42.2 ± 1.87, 40.9 ± 2.12, 41.7 ± 1.31, and 33.2 ± 1.23 pg/ml, respectively (p < 0.05).

Concentrations of IFN-γ were significantly increased in COPD + DS patients when compared with controls (24.3 ± 1.49 and 17.8 ± 0.70 pg/ml, respectively, p < 0.05). IL-2 levels were highest in COPD + DS (3.20 ± 0.389 pg/ml) and differed significantly when this group was compared with controls (2.20 ± 0.184 pg/ml), p ≤ 0.05). In this study, we demonstrated for the first time that depressive symptoms in COPD patients may be related to inflammatory state as confirmed by increased levels of IL-6 both in COPD and depression and also in COPD with comorbid depressive symptoms, despite the fact that the patients were treated with anti-inflammatory drugs and/or antidepressants. We also identified IFN-γ and IL-2 as putative inflammatory agents associated with depressive symptoms in COPD patients. Prospective studies will need to confirm whether measuring IL-2 and IFN-γ can identify COPD patients at risk of depression. These findings suggest that T helper cell 1-derived cellular immune activation may play significant role in developing depressive symptoms in COPD patients."

CD012347,0,28766107,0,Examining of Thallium in Cigarette Smokers.,"Smoking is one of the sources of thallium which is considered as a toxic heavy metal. The aim of this study was to determine urinary thallium levels and related variables in smokers, compared to a control group. The study was conducted on 56 participants who had smoked continuously during the year before they were referred to Kashan Smoking Cessation Clinic. Fifty-three nonsmokers who were family members or friends of the smokers were selected as the control group. Urinary thallium was measured in both groups (n = 109) using atomic absorption spectrophotometry. The mean value (with SD) for urinary thallium in the smokers (10.16 ± 1.82 μg/L) was significantly higher than in the control group (2.39 ± 0.63 μg/L). There was a significant relationship between smoking duration and urinary thallium levels (P = 0.003). In a subgroup of smokers who was addicted to opium and opium residues (n = 9), the mean level of thallium (37.5 ± 13.09 μg/L) was significantly higher than in the other smokers (4.93 ± 4.45; P = 0.001). Multiple regression analysis showed opioid abuse, insomnia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), together were strong predictors of urinary thallium levels in smokers. There was no significant difference in thallium level in hookah smokers (P = 0.299) or in those with COPD compared to other smokers (P = 0.375). Urinary thallium levels of smokers with clinical signs of depression, sleep disorders, memory loss, and sweating were higher than those of smokers without these signs. Since thallium, as other toxic metals is accumulated in the body, and cigarette smoking also involves carcinogenic exposures and health hazards for passively exposed people, the need for cigarette control policies is emphasized."

CD012347,0,19436690,0,Focusing on outcomes: making the most of COPD interventions.,"A number of excellent intervention studies related to clinical and psychosocial aspects of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have been undertaken in the recent past. A range of outcomes have been examined including pulmonary function, health care use, quality of life, anxiety and depression, ambulation, exercise capacity, and self-efficacy. The purpose of this narrative review was to a) consider clinical, psychosocial, and educational interventions for people living with COPD in light of the health related outcomes that they have produced, b) identify the type of interventions most associated with outcomes, c) examine work related to COPD interventions as it has evolved regarding theory and models compared to work in asthma, and d) explore implications for future COPD research. Studies reviewed comprised large scale comprehensive reviews including randomized clinical trials and meta-analysis as these forms of investigation engender the greatest confidence in clinicians and health care researchers. Extant research suggests that the most significant improvements in COPD health care utilization have been realized from interventions specifically designed to enhance disease management by patients. A range of interventions have produced modest changes in quality of life. Evidence of impact for other outcomes and for a particular type of intervention is not strong. Research in other chronic diseases, particularly asthma, suggests that interventions grounded in learning theory and models of behavior change can consistently produce desired results for patients and clinicians. Use of a model of self-regulation may enhance COPD interventions. Although the extent to which COPD efforts can benefit from the experience in other conditions is a question, more outcome focused intervention studies using more robust theoretical approaches may enhance COPD results, especially regarding health care use and quality of life."

CD012347,0,2196555,0,Codeine in analgesic doses does not depress respiration in patients with severe chronic obstructive lung disease.,"Nineteen normocapnic patients with chronic obstructive lung disease participated in an open single dose safety study (part one) followed by a randomized double-blind cross-over study comparing two seven-days treatment periods of 1 g of paracetamol t.i.d. with 60 mg of codeine plus 1 g of paracetamol t.i.d., respectively (part two). In part one, continuous monitoring after a single dose of 2 g of paracetamol and 120 mg of codeine revealed no deterioration in the respiration and gas tensions. In part two, respiratory parameters and arterial gas tensions were recorded one hour after the last morning dose. PaCO2 increased insignificantly (0.05 less than P less than 0.10) by a median of 0.38 kPa during treatment with codeine and paracetamol compared to treatment with paracetamol alone. PaO2 decreased by 0.12 kPa (P greater than 0.10). There was no correlation between changes in PaCO2 and changes in PaO2. FVC, FEV1 and dyspnoea at rest were unchanged. Gastrointestinal side effects were reported significantly (P less than 0.02) more often during treatment with codeine plus paracetamol. There was no correlation between the plasma concentration of codeine or morphine and changes in respiratory parameters or adverse effects. The limitation for the short time clinical use of codeine as an analgesic to normocapnic patients with severe chronic obstructive lung disease in stable phase seem to be gastrointestinal side effects."

A questionnaire was used to examine the patients' symptoms of breathlessness, anxiety, depression, sleeplessness, fatigue, and pain, and their outlook for the future. All patients reported breathlessness, 64% anxiety, 69% depression, 28% sleeplessness, 72% fatigue, and 45% pain. Those with anxiety reported significant depression (P < 0.001), and those with fatigue reported significant depression (P = 0.004). Patients who reported pain also reported significant sleeplessness (P = 0.022). A negative outlook for the future was reported by 42% of patients who also reported significantly more anxiety, depression, sleeplessness, fatigue, and pain (P ≤ 0.049). Multiple symptoms are common in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and patients with a pessimistic view of the future reported more symptoms. Those with multiple symptoms and a negative outlook toward the future may benefit from interventions to help them achieve a more positive outlook for the future, which may relieve symptom burden."

CD012347,0,9230249,0,Home assessment of activities of daily living in patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease on long-term oxygen therapy.,"In patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) using long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT), few studies have investigated activities of daily living (ADL). We examined the relationships between ADL, quality of life, mood state and airways obstruction in patients using long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) and in patients not requiring LTOT. We studied 23 patients (14 males, 9 females; median age 71, range 60-84 yrs) with COPD who received LTOT using oxygen concentrators (LTOT group). We also studied a control group of 19 patients (14 males, 5 females; median age 72, range 62-75 yrs) with COPD but without severe hypoxaemia (non-LTOT group). We found no significant difference between groups in health status using the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). Median Nottingham Extended Activities of Daily Living (EADL) total scores were: LTOT group 10, non-LTOT 17; (p=0.01). Significant correlations (p<0.001) with Nottingham EADL score were found for Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD) score (rho=0.59), SGRQ Total score (rho=0.65) and percentage predicted forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) (rho=0.66). In conclusion, in patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and broadly similar health status, those using long-term oxygen therapy were less independent in activities of daily living than those not requiring long-term oxygen therapy. Reduced independence in activities of daily living is, however, associated with the extent of airflow limitation, depression and poor health status, and does not, therefore, appear to be simply a result of restriction in movements imposed by the stationary device."

CD012347,0,28322440,0,Psychological therapies for the treatment of anxiety disorders in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (commonly referred to as chronic bronchitis and emphysema) is a chronic lung condition characterised by the inflammation of airways and irreversible destruction of pulmonary tissue leading to progressively worsening dyspnoea. It is a leading international cause of disability and death in adults. Evidence suggests that there is an increased prevalence of anxiety disorders in people with COPD. The severity of anxiety has been shown to correlate with the severity of COPD, however anxiety can occur with all stages of COPD severity. Coexisting anxiety and COPD contribute to poor health outcomes in terms of exercise tolerance, quality of life and COPD exacerbations. The evidence for treatment of anxiety disorders in this population is limited, with a paucity of evidence to support the efficacy of medication-only treatments. It is therefore important to evaluate psychological therapies for the alleviation of these symptoms in people with COPD."

CD012347,0,8498378,0,ST-segment depression during sleep in obstructive sleep apnea.,"It was hypothesized that obstructive sleep apnea may precipitate myocardial ischemia, reflected by ST-segment depression, in some patients during sleep. Overnight sleep studies and simultaneous 3-channel Holter monitoring were performed on 23 consecutive patients with obstructive sleep apnea without a history of coronary artery disease. Each patient was randomly assigned to nasal continuous positive airway pressure for the first half of the night. An episode of significant ST depression was defined as > 1 mm from baseline for > 1 minute. The total duration (minutes) of ST depression was indexed to the total sleep time (minutes per hour of sleep). Seven patients (30%) had ST depression during sleep. In all 7 patients the duration of ST depression decreased during nasal continuous positive airway pressure (30 +/- 18 vs 11 +/- 13 minutes per hour of sleep) in association with a reduction in the apnea-hypopnea index (65 +/- 35 vs 7 +/- 6/hour), arousal index (49 +/- 14 vs 6 +/- 4/hour) and the duration that oxygen saturation was < 90% (44 +/- 27 vs 12 +/- 23% total sleep time). When patients were not on nasal continuous positive airway pressure, the apnea-hypopnea and arousal indexes were higher during periods of ST depression than when ST segments were isoelectric, whereas oxygen saturation was not different. These 7 patients underwent exercise testing, which was positive for inducible myocardial ischemia in 1 patient. It is concluded that ST depression is relatively common in patients with obstructive apnea during sleep and that the duration of ST depression is significantly reduced by nasal continuous positive airway pressure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD012347,0,21084547,0,Pulmonary rehabilitation reduces depression and enhances health-related quality of life in COPD patients--especially in patients with mild or moderate disease.,"The first objective of the study was to evaluate a 4-week inpatient pulmonary rehabilitation program on exercise capacity, health-related quality of life (HRQL) and psychological distress in patients with COPD. The second objective was to investigate the influence of gender, age, disease severity, co-morbidity, anxiety and depression on improved HRQL after rehabilitation. The study comprised 136 consecutive patients from baseline to follow-up with mild-to-severe COPD. Exercise capacity was measured by the 6-min walking distance test, disease severity by spirometric tests, HRQL by The St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire and psychological distress by the The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Variables on socio-demography and co-morbidity were self-reported. Exercise capacity was improved from baseline to follow-up with a score difference of +44 metres (p = 000). Except for the activity score, HRQL was significantly improved: a change of -3.5 for the symptom score (p = 014), -3.1 for the total score (p = 003) and a clinical significant change of - 4.0 for the impact score (p = 002). The anxiety score did not change significantly after rehabilitation (-0.1, p = 545), though there was a significant reduction of the depression score (-0.8, p = 002) and a 10.4% reduction in the prevalence of possible depression cases (p = 017). Patients with forced expiratory volume in 1 second ≥50% predicted were 4.2 times more likely to achieve a clinical significant improved HRQL after rehabilitation than patients with forced expiratory volume in 1 second <50% predicted (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.7-10.3, p = 002). A 4-week inpatient rehabilitation program improves HRQL and exercise capacity and reduces depression in COPD patients. Patients with mild or moderate disease are more likely to achieve an improved HRQL after rehabilitation than patients with severe or very severe disease."

CD012347,0,12727039,0,Measuring the symptom experience of seriously ill cancer and noncancer hospitalized patients near the end of life with the memorial symptom assessment scale.,"The objectives of this study were twofold: (1) to explore and compare the symptom experience of seriously ill hospitalized cancer and noncancer patients near the end of life using the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale (MSAS) and (2) to determine if the MSAS is a valid and useful measure of symptom distress for patients with noncancer conditions. This was a prospective cohort study of hospitalized patients with end-stage congestive heart disease, chronic pulmonary disease, cirrhosis, or metastatic cancer. Eligible patients were interviewed to ascertain symptom prevalence, severity and distress using the MSAS and levels of fatigue using the Piper Fatigue Scale (PFS). Sixty-six patients with metastatic cancer and 69 patients with end-stage disease were enrolled in the study. There was a significant difference in the prevalence of selected physical symptoms, but not psychological symptoms, between cancer and noncancer patients. There were no significant differences in symptom distress scores, a computed score of frequency, severity and distress, if the symptom was present. In both groups the principal components factor analysis with varimax rotation yielded one factor comprising psychological symptoms and a second factor comprising three subgroups of physical symptoms. Internal consistency was high for the psychological subscale (Cronbach alpha coefficients of 0.85 for the cancer group and 0.77 for the noncancer group) and for the physical subscale groupings, with coefficients ranging between 0.78 to 0.87. The symptom scores were significantly correlated with perceptions of fatigue. These findings show that both seriously ill cancer and noncancer patients experience symptom distress, and that the MSAS seems to be a reliable measure of symptom distress in noncancer patients, as well as with cancer patients."

In group A, MMS deteriorated from baseline to the 1 yr and 2 yr reassessments (27 +/- 2.9 vs. 25.8 +/- 4.1 and 25.4 +/- 4, P < 0.005), whereas GDS and ADLs did not change significantly; the 23 patients experiencing a decline of MMS had baseline lower percentage predicted FVC (52.3 +/- 17.1 vs. 66.9 +/- 13.4, P < 0.03) and FEV1 (27.2 +/- 8.6 vs. 44 +/- 26.8, P < 0.02) values and better affective status (GDS score: 11.9 +/- 7.7 vs. 16.5 +/- 5.6, P < 0.04). Two-year changes in MMS and in GDS scores were inversely correlated (Spearman's p = -0.32, P = 0.04). Cognitive decline is faster in the presence of severe bronchial obstruction and parallels the worsening of the affective status in COPD patients on oxygen therapy. The onset of depression rather than baseline depressive symptoms seems to be a risk factor for cognitive decline."

Demographic and clinical characteristics as well as disease-specific health status (St George's Respiratory Questionnaire, SGRQ) were assessed in 105 outpatients with advanced COPD at baseline and at 4, 8 and 12 months. Eighty-five patients (81.0%) had complete SGRQ data at baseline and 12 months and were included in analyses. Stepwise multiple regression analysis revealed that lower SGRQ total score, higher depression scores and longer time needed to complete the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test at baseline, as well as increase in time needed to complete the TUG test and increase in dyspnoea during the 1-year follow-up period, were predictors of deterioration in disease-specific health status.

Daily functioning, comorbidity, severity of illness, self-efficacy, depressive symptoms, and perceived informal support were regressed on hospital readmission. Daily functioning was the only significant variable to predict COPD readmission at 90 days in the Taiwan population living in a rural area. Age was significantly correlated with 14 days readmission. Post hoc analyses examined differences in three ethnic groups. Mainlanders perceived less family support, had higher depressive symptoms and lower daily functioning than the majority culture Fukiens and Hakkas, or the Aborigines. The study reinforced the need for identification of cultural differences and low functioning as risk factors for early readmission so they can be addressed in discharge planning."

This was a prospective cohort study of patients with symptoms of acute chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation who attended one of 17 hospitals in Spain between June 2008 and September 2010. Clinical data and patient reported measures (dyspnoea level, health-related quality of life, anxiety and depression levels, capacity to perform physical activity) were collected from arrival to the emergency department up to a week after the visit in discharged patients and to discharge in admitted patients (short term). Main outcomes were time course of dyspnoea over the acute (first 24 hours) and short-term periods, mortality and readmission within 2 months of the index episode. Changes in dyspnoea in both periods were related capacity to perform physical activity as well as clinical variables. Short-term changes in dyspnoea were also related to dyspnoea at 24 hours after the ED visit, and anxiety and depression levels. Dyspnoea worsening or failing to improve over the studied periods was associated with poor clinical outcomes. Patient-reported measures are predictive of changes in dyspnoea level."

MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, SCOPUS and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched from inception to end-February 2013, using keywords 'COPD', 'exercise', 'physical activity', 'rehabilitation', 'co-morbidity' and individual co-morbid conditions. Studies reporting associations of co-morbidities in COPD with at least one objective measure of physical performance were included. Study quality was appraised using the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) checklist. Nine studies met inclusion criteria. Mean (standard deviation (SD)) STROBE score was 16 (3) (maximum score = 21). Four studies examined anxiety as a co-morbid condition; three examined depression; two examined obesity and two examined a range of conditions. Reduced physical performance was associated with higher Charlson score (odds ratio (OR) = 0.72, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.54-0.98), metabolic disease (OR = 0.58, 95% CI = 0.49-0.67), anxiety (OR = 0.37, 95% CI = 0.23-0.59) and osteoporosis (OR = 0.28, 95% CI = 0.11-0.70). Depression had minimal association with physical performance but was associated with higher dropout rates from pulmonary rehabilitation programmes. Obesity was negatively associated with baseline physical performance but not with change from an exercise intervention. The presence of co-morbid conditions in people with COPD may negatively affect physical performance and should be identified and accounted for analysis of interventions."

Utilizing qualitative methodology, we conducted focus groups of veterans with COPD at the Cincinnati VA Medical Center. Participants were selected by systematic sampling from the top quintile of veterans stratified by the cost of healthcare utilization related to a primary diagnosis of COPD and grouped by age and use of supplemental oxygen. All 42 participants were male and had a mean age of 65 years. Analysis of the focus group transcripts demonstrated five major themes: 1) Physical and Functional Limitations: work and employment constraints, recreation restrictions, limits on activities of daily living, reduced sexuality, concerns about housing and finances, and physical symptoms; 2) Restricted Social Interactions/Altered Social Networks: altered relationships with friends and family and reliance upon family and care givers; 3) Emotional Effects: reduced self-worth, vulnerability, depression, perseverance and adaptation, hopelessness, fear, pride, and lack of control; 4) Limitations in the Understanding of COPD: unawareness of diagnosis, triggers and reaction to disease manifestations, COPD management; and 5) Complex Healthcare Interactions.

CD012347,0,16055871,0,Are patients with COPD psychologically distressed?,"This study was designed to assess the level of psychological distress in a heterogeneous group of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and compare them with the general population and psychiatric outpatients. A total of 118 patients with COPD, a random sample of 500 subjects from the general population and 500 psychiatric outpatients participated in this study. The Dutch version of the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised was used to assess general psychological distress. The sample of patients with COPD experienced significantly more psychological distress than the general population and significantly less than psychiatric outpatients. Furthermore, no significant association was found between the severity of the pulmonary disease and the level of psychological distress, although patients with severe or very severe COPD appeared to be at increased risk of depression. Lastly, the pattern of psychological complaints seems comparable in depressed patients with COPD and psychiatric outpatients. Once patients with COPD report suffering from depressive symptoms, the level of distress seems to increase to that found in psychiatric outpatients. In conclusion, in clinical settings in which psychological complaints are not routinely assessed, the Beck Depression Inventory and Symptom Checklist-90-Revised are very useful for drawing attention to depression and psychological distress."

Identifying COPD patients at risk for depression would facilitate the alleviation of an important comorbidity conferring additional risk for poor outcomes. The purpose of this study was to determine the utility of a brief screening measure, the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15), in detecting the mood disorders in persons with COPD. This is a cross-sectional study of 188 persons with COPD, stratified by age (65 and older versus less than 65) and COPD severity using Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) staging. Screening cut-points were empirically derived using threshold selection methods and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were estimated. The GDS-15 was used as a screening measure and diagnoses of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) or other mood disorders were determined using a ""gold standard"" standardized structured clinical interview. Of the 188 persons with COPD, 25% met criteria for any mood disorder and 11% met criteria for MDD. Optimal threshold estimations suggested a GDS cut score of 5, which yielded adequate sensitivity and specificity in detecting MDD (81% and 87%, respectively) and correctly classified 86% of participants. To detect the presence of any mood disorder, a cut score of 4 was suggested yielding sensitivity and specificity of 67% and 82%, respectively; correctly classifying 79%. These results suggest that mood disorders are relatively common among persons with COPD. The GDS-15 is a useful screening measure to identify patients at risk for depression."

CD012347,0,23350718,0,Sleep-disordered breathing in major depressive disorder.,"Individuals with major depressive disorder often experience obstructive sleep apnea. However, the relationship between depression and less severe sleep-disordered breathing is unclear. This study examined the rate of sleep-disordered breathing in depression after excluding those who had clinically significant sleep apnea (>5 apneas∙h⁻¹). Archival data collected between 1991 and 2005 were used to assess the prevalence of sleep-disordered breathing events in 60 (31 depressed; 29 healthy controls) unmedicated participants. Respiratory events were automatically detected using a program developed in-house measuring thermal nasal air-flow and chest pressure. Results show that even after excluding participants with clinically significant sleep-disordered breathing, individuals with depression continue to exhibit higher rates of sleep-disordered breathing compared with healthy controls (depressed group: apnea-hypopnea index mean = 0.524, SE = 0.105; healthy group: apnea-hypopnea index mean = 0.179, SE = 0.108). Exploratory analyses were also conducted to assess for rates of exclusion in depression studies due to sleep-disordered breathing. Study exclusion of sleep-disordered breathing was quantified based on self-report during telephone screening, and via first night polysomnography. Results from phone screening data reveal that individuals reporting depression were 5.86 times more likely to report a diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea than presumptive control participants. Furthermore, all of the participants excluded for severe sleep-disordered breathing detected on the first night were participants with depression. These findings illustrate the importance of understanding the relationship between sleep-disordered breathing and depression, and suggest that screening and quantification of sleep-disordered breathing should be considered in depression research."

CD012347,0,17317428,0,Depressive symptoms and quality of life in elderly patients with exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cardiac heart failure: preliminary data of a randomized controlled trial.,"Aim of the study was to evaluate mortality and functional, cognitive, affective status in elderly patients (>or=75 years) with exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or acute congestive heart failure (CHF) admitted to the emergency department (ED) of S. Giovanni Battista Hospital of Torino and randomly assigned to the geriatric home hospitalization service (GHHS) or to a general medical ward (GMW). All patients were evaluated on admission, on discharge and at 6 months, using a standardized study protocol. We excluded patients with unstable medical conditions. The total sample included 73 patients: 35 with COPD exacerbation (19 GHHS, 16 GMW) and 38 with CHF (19 GHHS, 19 GMW). Mean age was 81.7+/-8.0 years. At baseline, no significant differences in demographic, social and clinical conditions were found between the two groups of patients. 56.7% of COPD patients had a severe exacerbation, according to Anthonisen criteria; 65% of CHF patients were NYHA-III and 35% NYHA-IV (according to the criteria of the New York Heart Association) (FE<35% in 40% of patients). On admission all patients were partially dependent in ADLs and IADLs, with a moderate impairment of depression score and a fairly good quality of life. On discharge depression score and quality of life were significantly better only in GHHS patients. Mortality was similar in the two setting of care. Patients managed at home had a significantly longer length of treatment. At 6-month follow-up we did not observe a difference in mortality, but we observed a higher readmission rate in patients previously treated in hospital. In conclusion, our study indicates that home-treated patients with COPD or CHF have better depressive scores and quality of life and a lower rate of hospital readmission after six months."

Psychological co-morbidities such as anxiety and depression are common in COPD. Current evidence for treatment options to reduce anxiety and depression in patients with COPD was examined. There is evidence available for the efficacy of pharmacological treatments, cognitive behavioural therapy, pulmonary rehabilitation, relaxation therapy and palliative care in COPD. Therapeutic modalities that have not been proven effective in decreasing anxiety and depression in COPD, but which have theoretical potential among patients, include interpersonal psychotherapy, self-management programmes, more extensive disease management programmes, supportive therapy and self-help groups. Besides pulmonary rehabilitation that is only available for a small percentage of patients, management guidelines make scant reference to other options for the treatment of mental health problems. The quantity and quality of research on mental health treatments in COPD have historically been insufficient to support their inclusion in COPD treatment guidelines. In this review, recommendations regarding assessment, treatment and future research in this important field were made."

CD012347,0,21680167,0,Effects of medical and psychological treatment of depression in patients with COPD--a review.,"Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a chronic inflammatory lung disease characterized by progressive and only partially reversible symptoms and by considerable negative consequences such as reductions in functional status and quality of life. Comorbid depression is highly prevalent in patients with COPD and related to a worse course of the disease. Despite its negative impact, depression often remains unrecognized and untreated in COPD patients. This review summarizes the current state of findings from studies examining the effects of antidepressant treatments in patients with COPD. Reviewed treatment options are antidepressant medical therapy and cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). Antidepressant medical trials include treatments with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) or tricyclic antidepressants (TCA); CBT was applied using various components. Across both treatment types, the majority of studies included patients with a wide range of psychiatric conditions and especially comorbid symptoms of anxiety were often not controlled. Furthermore, greatly varying instruments and methods for assessing depressive symptoms, small sample sizes and rather heterogeneous results were observed. This makes the comparison of treatment options rather difficult and prevents definite conclusions. However, some important implications valuable for further research were obtained. Some limited data suggested that SSRI might show fewer side effects than TCA. A few antidepressants as well as beneficial effects in other outcomes were observed after antidepressant medical treatment. More clearly, CBT showed some potential in terms of improvements in depressive symptoms, and also in other outcome measures. Patient compliance seems more promising for CBT than for antidepressant medical treatment. Overall, the reviewed studies suggest some promising effects for both treatment types and effect sizes in studies with significant antidepressant effects were reasonable. However, future randomized controlled trials comparing antidepressant medical and cognitive-behavioral therapy will be essential to assess distinct and most favorable treatment effects. Because recent data is often limited, sound diagnostic criteria of depression and adequate sample sizes are necessary to draw firm conclusions on the effects of these antidepressant treatment options in patients with COPD and comorbid depression."

Previous studies have been plagued by methodologic problems, including small sample sizes, few clinical events, and uncontrolled confounders, particularly perioperative complications. In addition, few studies have examined social support as a potential protective factor. We therefore examined the association between pretransplant depressive symptoms, social support, and mortality in a large sample of lung transplant recipients. As a secondary aim, we also examined the associations between psychosocial factors, perioperative outcomes [indexed by hospital length of stay (LOS)], and mortality. We hypothesized that depression would be associated with longer LOS and that the association between depression, social support, and mortality would be moderated by LOS. Participants included lung transplant recipients, transplanted at Duke University Medical Center from January 2009 to December 2014.

CD012347,0,18321938,0,Relationship between depression and exacerbations in COPD.,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is associated with exacerbations. Some patients are prone to frequent exacerbations and these individuals have a worse quality of life, greater limitation of their daily activity and faster disease progression than patients with less frequent exacerbations. A prospective study in a well-characterised cohort was performed and it was assessed whether depression, as determined by the Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, was related to exacerbation frequency, systemic inflammation and various social factors. The associations of any increase in depressive symptoms at exacerbation were also investigated. Frequent exacerbators had a significantly higher median (interquartile range) baseline depression score than infrequent exacerbators (17.0 (7.0-25.0) and 12.0 (6.0-18.0), respectively). Depressed patients spend significantly less time outdoors and had significantly worse quality of life as measured by the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire. Depression increased significantly in patients from baseline to exacerbation (12.5 (5.0-19.0) and 19.5 (12.0-28.0) respectively). The present study is the first to show a relationship between depression and exacerbation frequency in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The finding that frequent exacerbators are more depressed than infrequent exacerbators is relevant, as exacerbation frequency is an important outcome measure in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease."

Thirty-five patients with COPD were evaluated by pulmonary physicians with CAT and mMRC. They were further evaluated with HAMD and HAMA by psychologists and diagnosed and grouped into group B and D according to the Global initiative for chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) version 2014. Patients were given psychotic therapy and followed up for at least 1 month. Comparison and analysis were performed with clinical data before and after treatment. Fourteen patients were subscribed into B group, while 21 patients were subscribed into D group, accounting for 40% and 60% respectively. After psychotic therapy, the HAMA and MAMD score of patients in both groups improved significantly (P<0.05). The CAT and Mmrc score of 8 patients in B group improved as A, while 10 patients in D group improved as B. The longest follow-up was 12 months. Symptoms were significantly alleviated after combined respiratory and psychotic therapy. COPD complicated with anxiety-depression is of high prevalence.

The objectives of this study were to describe the rate of successful prosthetic fitting over a 12 mo period; describe prosthetic use after amputation; and determine factors associated with greater prosthetic fitting, function, and satisfaction. The study design was a multicenter prospective cohort study of individuals undergoing their first major lower-limb amputation because of vascular disease and/or diabetes. At 4 mo, unsuccessful prosthetic fitting was significantly associated with depression, prior arterial reconstruction, diabetes, and pain in the residual limb. At 12 mo, 92% of all subjects were fit with a prosthetic limb and individuals with transfemoral amputation were significantly less likely to have a prosthesis fit. Age older than 55 yr, diagnosis of a major depressive episode, and history of renal dialysis were associated with fewer hours of prosthetic walking. Subjects who were older, had experienced a major depressive episode, and/or were diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease had greater functional restriction. Thus, while most individuals achieve successful prosthetic fitting by 1 yr following a first major nontraumatic lower-limb amputation, a number of medical variables and psychosocial factors are associated with prosthetic fitting, utilization, and function."

The following measurements were employed: Forced expiratory volume in 1 second expressed in percentage predicted (FEV1%), Shuttle-Walking-Test (SWT), International Diagnostic Checklists for ICD-10 (IDCL), questionnaires on generic and disease-specific health-related quality of life (St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), European Quality of Life Questionnaire (EuroQol), a modified version of a Disability-Index (CDI)), and a screening questionnaire for a broad range of psychological problems and symptoms of psychopathology (Symptom-Checklist-90-R (SCL-90-R)). One hundred and forty-three stable COPD outpatients with a severity grade between 2 and 4 (according to the GOLD criteria) as well as 105 spouses took part in the study. The prevalence of anxiety and depression diagnoses was increased both in COPD patients and their spouses. In contrast, substance-related disorders were explicitly more frequent in COPD patients. Multiple linear regression analyses indicated that depression (SCL-90-R), walking distance (SWT), somatization (SCL-90-R), male gender, FEV1%, and heart disease were independent predictors of COPD patients' health-related quality of life. After including anxiousness of the spouses in the regression, medical variables (FEV1% and heart disease) no longer explained disability, thus highlighting the relevance of spouses' well-being. The results underline the importance of depression and anxiousness for health-related quality of life in COPD patients and their spouses.

A recent study showed that mirtazapine reduced the respiratory disturbance index (RDI) of a stroke patient by 80%. These promising results prompted us to offer mirtazapine to non-depressed stroke patients who suffered from sleep apnea and refused treatment with a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) device. Polysomnography was performed between 2200 and 0600 hours. We examined ten inpatients [nine male, one female; mean age of 68.7 +/- 1.5 years +/- SE; body mass index of 26.1 +/- 1.2 kg/m(2), basal ganglia bleeding (n = 3), middle cerebral artery ischemia (n = 4), basal ganglia ischemia (n = 1), cerebellar bleeding (n = 2)] in the Neurologic Clinic's sleep laboratory. The mean duration of illness before the first polysomnography was 52.6 +/- 11.4 days. Mirtazapine effectively consolidated sleep in all patients, i.e., sleep efficiency significantly increased from 63.1 +/- 4.8% to 75.7 +/- 5.0%. A moderate increase in RDI (137.4 +/- 15.3% of baseline) occurred during initial mirtazapine administration (intake duration 15.8 +/- 5.5 days). After 51.9 +/- 8.4 days, the RDI was either reduced (51.9% in ""responders"" who were identified arbitrarily by a reduction in RDI >or= 25% at any time point of the investigation) or increased (154.4% in ""non-responders""). Mirtazapine administration was stopped in the four patients with increased RDI. Mirtazapine may be a probably effective treatment in stroke survivors with obstructive sleep apnea who refuse nasal CPAP treatment.

CD012347,0,18729534,0,Approved and investigational uses of modafinil : an evidence-based review.,"Modafinil is a wake-promoting agent that is pharmacologically different from other stimulants. It has been investigated in healthy volunteers, and in individuals with clinical disorders associated with excessive sleepiness, fatigue, impaired cognition and other symptoms. This review examines the use of modafinil in clinical practice based on the results of randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials available in the English language in the MEDLINE database. In sleep-deprived individuals, modafinil improves mood, fatigue, sleepiness and cognition to a similar extent as caffeine but has a longer duration of action. Evidence for improved cognition in non-sleep-deprived healthy volunteers is controversial.Modafinil improves excessive sleepiness and illness severity in all three disorders for which it has been approved by the US FDA, i.e. narcolepsy, shift-work sleep disorder and obstructive sleep apnoea with residual excessive sleepiness despite optimal use of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). However, its effects on safety on the job and on morbidities associated with these disorders have not been ascertained. Continued use of CPAP in obstructive sleep apnoea is essential. Modafinil does not benefit cataplexy.In very small, short-term trials, modafinil improved excessive sleepiness in patients with myotonic dystrophy. It was efficacious in fairly large studies of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children and adolescents, and was as efficacious as methylphenidate in a small trial, but has not been approved by the FDA, in part because of its serious dermatological toxicity. In a trial of 21 non-concurrent subjects, with 2-week treatment periods, modafinil was as effective as dexamfetamine in adult ADHD. Modafinil was helpful for depressive symptoms in bipolar disorder in a trial that excluded patients with stimulant-induced mania. A single dose of modafinil may hasten recovery from general anaesthesia after day surgery. A single dose of modafinil improved the ability of emergency room physicians to attend didactic lectures after a night shift, but did not improve their ability to drive home and caused sleep disturbances subsequently.Modafinil had a substantial placebo effect on outcomes such as fatigue, excessive sleepiness and depression in patients with traumatic brain injury, major depressive disorder, schizophrenia, post-polio fatigue and multiple sclerosis; however, it did not provide any benefit greater than placebo.Trials of modafinil for excessive sleepiness in Parkinson's disease, cocaine addiction and cognition in chronic fatigue syndrome provided inconsistent results; all studies had extremely small sample sizes. Modafinil cannot be recommended for these conditions until definitive data become available.Modafinil induces and inhibits several cytochrome P450 isoenzymes and has the potential for interacting with drugs from all classes. The modafinil dose should be reduced in the elderly and in patients with hepatic disease. Caution is needed in patients with severe renal insufficiency because of substantial increases in levels of modafinil acid. Common adverse events with modafinil include insomnia, headache, nausea, nervousness and hypertension. Decreased appetite, weight loss and serious dermatological have been reported with greater frequency in children and adolescents, probably due to the higher doses (based on bodyweight) used. Modafinil may have some abuse/addictive potential although no cases have been reported to date."

This study examined whether individuals with AATD-associated COPD differ from individuals with non-AATD COPD with regard to depression, anxiety, dyspnea, and health-related quality of life (HRQL). Cross-sectional data were collected via self-report questionnaires completed by 480 individuals with non-AATD COPD and 578 individuals with AATD-associated COPD under protocols with IRB approval. Multiple linear regression models were used to test whether individuals with non-AATD COPD differed from individuals with AATD-associated COPD with regard to depression, anxiety, dyspnea, and HRQL. All models adjusted for demographic and health characteristics. Individuals with AATD-associated COPD did not report more symptoms of depression or anxiety; however, they did report more dyspnea (B = 0.31, 95% CI = 0.16 to 0.47, p < 0.001) and impairment in HRQL (B = 4.75, 95% CI = 2.10 to 7.41, p < 0.001) than other individuals with COPD. Individuals with AATD-associated COPD were more likely to be a member of a couple (rather than single) and had a higher level of education when compared to individuals with non-AATD COPD. Resources available to persons with AATD-associated COPD, such as being in a serious relationship and having higher education, may offset the effect of age when considering symptoms of depression and anxiety in patients with COPD."

CD012347,0,19201228,0,"CPAP and behavioral therapies in patients with obstructive sleep apnea: effects on daytime sleepiness, mood, and cognitive function.","Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a disorder characterized by repeated episodes of complete (apneas) or partial (hypopneas) cessations of breathing while sleeping. While continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment is commonly chosen to treat OSA, various conservative behavioral therapies are also used, particularly in patients unable to tolerate or benefit from CPAP or who have mild OSA. The principal purpose of these behavioral measures is to reduce risk factors which may underlie or exacerbate the disorder (e.g., weight reduction, smoking cessation, reduction/elimination of alcohol consumption, change in sleeping posture and sleep hygiene). Numerous studies have been conducted to evaluate the efficacy and/or effectiveness of CPAP in treating a wide range of OSA symptomatology. The present study consists of an exhaustive bibliographic search in Medline, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Review (1994-2007) databases and selection of works which have evaluated the efficacy and/or effectiveness of CPAP vis-a-vis daytime sleepiness, depression and cognitive functioning in OSA patients. The selected studies include randomized clinical trials in which CPAP was compared with more conservative measures, sham CPAP and oral placebos.

CD012347,0,11897643,0,A randomized controlled trial of continuous positive airway pressure in mild obstructive sleep apnea.,"A common clinical dilemma faced by sleep physicians is in deciding the level of severity at which patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) should be treated. There is particular uncertainty about the need for, and the effectiveness of, treatment in mild cases. To help define the role of nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment in mild OSA we undertook a randomized controlled cross-over trial of CPAP in patients with an apnea- hypopnea index (AHI) of 5 - 30 (mean, 12.9 +/- 6.3 SD). Twenty-four-hour blood pressure and neurobehavioral function were measured at baseline, after 8 wk of treatment with CPAP, and after 8 wk of treatment with an oral placebo tablet. Twenty-eight of 42 patients enrolled in the study completed both treatment arms. Baseline characteristics were not different between those who completed the study and those who did not complete the study. Patients used CPAP for a mean (SD) of 3.53 (2.13) h per night and the mean AHI on the night of CPAP implementation was 4.24 (2.9). Nasal CPAP improved self-reported symptoms of OSA, including snoring, restless sleep, daytime sleepiness, and irritability (in-house questionnaire), more than did placebo, but did not improve objective (Multiple Sleep Latency Test) or subjective (Epworth Sleepiness Scale) measures of daytime sleepiness. We found no benefit of CPAP over placebo in any tests of neurobehavioral function, generic SF-36 (36-item Short Form Medical Outcomes Survey) or sleep-specific (Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire) quality of life questionnaires, mood score (Profile of Moods States and Beck Depression Index), or 24-h blood pressure. However, the placebo tablet resulted in a significant improvement in a wide range of functional variables compared with baseline. This placebo effect may account for some of the treatment responses to CPAP observed previously in patients with mild OSA."

The current study aimed to assess the longitudinal association between physical activity and risk of seven categories of comorbidity in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients. The study included 409 patients from primary care practice in the Netherlands and Switzerland. We assessed physical activity using the Longitudinal Ageing Study Amsterdam Physical Activity Questionnaire at baseline and followed patients for up to 5 years. During follow-up, patients reported their comorbidities (cardiovascular, neurological, endocrine, musculoskeletal, malignant, and infectious diseases) and completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale questionnaire for mental health assessment. We implemented multinomial logistic regression (an approximation to discrete time survival model using death as a competing risk) for our analysis. Study results did not suggest a statistically significant association of baseline physical activity with the development of seven categories of comorbidity. However, when we focused on depression and anxiety symptoms, we found that higher levels of physical activity at baseline were associated with a lower risk for depression (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.85; 0.75-0.95; p = 0.005) and anxiety (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.89; 0.79-1.00; p = 0.045). In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients, those with high physical activity are less likely to develop depression or anxiety symptoms over time. Increasing physical activity in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients may be an approach for testing to lower the burden from incident depression and anxiety."

We conducted a cross-sectional study of 90 stable COPD patients recruited from a specialized respiratory clinic. Dyspnea was measured using the ATS-DLD-78 questionnaire modified dyspnea scale (1-5 scale). Physical and functional evaluation included spirometry and six minute walking tests. Subjects then completed five psychological questionnaires: the Coping Inventory for Stressful Situations, the State/Trait Anxiety Inventory, the Beck Depression Index, the NEO-Five Factor Personality Inventory, and the Interpersonal Relationships Inventory. Patients also completed two disease-specific health-related quality of life (HRQL) questionnaires: St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) and Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire (CRQ). Subjects were predominantly male (n = 65) with a mean age of 68 years (+/- standard deviation 7.6). Over half (54%) the patients reported severe dyspnea (grade 5), and a quarter (24%) reported moderate dyspnea (grade 3-4). Mean FEV1 was 37.8 +/- 14.8% predicted. The mean total SGRQ score was 49 +/- 16 and the CRQ total score was 4.2 +/- 0.9. Dyspnea severity was associated with poorer HRQL scores and decreased physical performance. Based on linear regression, dyspnea scores--but not spirometric values--also correlated with indices of anxiety, depression, and neuroticism. Dyspnea correlated more strongly with HRQL and with indices of anxiety and depression than spirometric values.

The present study investigated changes in both somatic and affective/cognitive symptoms of depression associated with the introduction of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment for OSA. Participants were 39 outpatients (35 males, 4 females) with no current or past mental health problems, diagnosed with OSA in a hospital sleep disorders clinic. The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) was administered prior to treatment and again 3 months after CPAP. Total BDI scores improved after CPAP, independent of objectively monitored CPAP compliance rates. Both somatic and affective/ cognitive symptoms of depression improved in a similar manner after treatment. Our findings suggest that depressive symptoms experienced by OSA patients are not solely the result of physical OSA symptoms but include a mood component as well. We introduce a hypothetical model to conceptualize the relationship between OSA and depression."

The health status of Washtenaw County, Michigan was modeled. Data were obtained from the Michigan Department of Public Health, Medstat Systems, and the medical literature for 32 diseases or conditions, representing approximately 85% of causes of death and 56% of medical payments (excluding medication costs). An expanded life-table approach was used for 16 age-and sex-matched cohorts exposed to a disease attack rate, access-to-care rate, case fatality rate, morbidity, and costs. Rates can be modified to reflect changes due to treatment, secular trends, or prevention programs. Two alternative delivery methods were considered to show the potential impact of reducing cardiovascular deaths (worksite initiative), or increasing utilization of services (lay health promotion) on county health status and costs over time. Deaths, bed days, and annual medical payments were the main outcome measurements. Cardiovascular and cancer conditions are and will be the primary causes of death in this population. The most important causes of bed days are musculoskeletal conditions, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, accidents, strokes, and depression. The major health-care payments are for angina pectoris and/or other cardiac conditions, musculoskeletal conditions, accidents, prenatal care, and/or childbirth, and depression. The two alternative scenarios illustrate how reductions in mortality are not necessarily equated with similar improvements in morbidity or costs. This model presents an overview of the current and projected health status of a community. With such a planning tool, a community can better understand the impact of potential prevention or intervention programs, and help design its health-care system within the constraints of available resources."

CD012347,0,14533284,0,Impact of comprehensive pulmonary rehabilitation on anxiety and depression in hospitalized COPD patients.,"To prospectively evaluate the effect of inpatient pulmonary rehabilitation (iPR) on anxiety and depression as outcome measures in patients with COPD, we studied 149 consecutive adults COPD referred to our iPR after an exacerbation. Patients were divided according to the GOLD staging into: Group 1 (stage 2a, n = 48, FEV1 63 +/- 9% pred.), Group 2 (stage 2b, n = 53, FEV1 42 +/- 6% pred.) and Group 3 (stage 3, n = 48, FEV1 25 +/- 7% pred.). The iPR consisted of twelve 3-hours daily sessions. Hospital Anxiety Depression (HAD) Scale as well as 6-minute walk (6MWD) with evaluation of dyspnea (D) and leg fatigue (F) at rest and end of effort, and health related quality of life by means of St. George Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) were assessed before (T0) and after (T1) the iPR. 6MWD, D and F at end of effort and SGRQ total score similarly improved (p < 0.001) in all groups after iPR. The mean level of HAD-anxiety (from 9.1 +/- 4.0 to 7.7 +/- 3.5, from 9.0 +/- 4.6 to 7.2 +/- 4.6 and from 8.1 +/- 4.1 to 6.7 +/- 4.3 in group 1,2 and 3 respectively) and HAD-depression (from 9.4 +/- 3.5 to 8.2 +/- 3.5, from 9.1 +/- 4.2 to 8.2 +/- 4.5 and from 9.0 +/- 4.0 to 7.4 +/- 4.5 respectively) similarly changed (p < 0.0001) over time in all groups. The total percentage of patients with abnormal score (> 10) of HAD-anxiety (from 31% to 21%) and HAD-depression (from 30% to 22%) significantly decreased (p < 0.05) after the iPR. Inpatient pulmonary rehabilitation may improve levels of anxiety and depression as well as symptoms, exercise capacity and health related quality of life in moderate to severe COPD patients after an acute exacerbation."

CD012347,0,27242272,0,Impact of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) on quality of life in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).,"Obstructive sleep apnea is a chronic illness with increasing prevalence. In addition to associated cardiovascular comorbidities, obstructive sleep apnea syndrome has been linked to poor quality of life, occupational accidents, and motor vehicle crashes secondary to excessive daytime sleepiness. Although continuous positive airway pressure is the gold standard for sleep apnea treatment, its effects on quality of life are not well defined. In the current study we investigated the effects of treatment on quality of life using the data from the Apnea Positive Pressure Long-term Efficacy Study (APPLES), a randomized controlled trial of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) versus sham CPAP. The Calgary Sleep Apnea Quality of Life Index (SAQLI) was used to assess quality of life. Overall we found no significant improvement in quality of life among sleep apnea patients after CPAP treatment. However, after stratifying by OSA severity, it was found that long-term improvement in quality of life might occur with the use of CPAP in people with severe and possibly moderate sleep apnea, and no demonstrable improvement in quality of life was noted among participants with mild obstructive sleep apnea."
CD012347,0,3521524,0,Doxepin treatment of depressed patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.,"During each of two six-week treatment periods, 12 depressed outpatients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease received increasing doses of doxepin hydrochloride or a placebo as tolerated. The mean maximal doses of doxepin hydrochloride and placebo were 105 and 128 mg, respectively. Three of the 12 patients dropped out because of doxepin's side effects. The depression and anxiety scores at the end of the treatment periods were virtually identical and not significantly different from baseline scores. Changes in the 12-minute walking distance were more closely correlated with changes in the depression and anxiety scores than with changes in the forced expiratory volume in 1 s or forced vital capacity. Thus, doxepin is ineffective in treating depressed patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; improvements in the 12-minute walking distance were closely correlated with improvements in the depression or anxiety scores."
CD012347,0,27434597,0,Treatments for the prevention of Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP).,"Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP) is defined as sudden, unexpected, witnessed or unwitnessed, non-traumatic or non-drowning death of people with epilepsy, with or without evidence of a seizure, excluding documented status epilepticus and in whom postmortem examination does not reveal a structural or toxicological cause for death. SUDEP has a reported incidence of 1 to 2 per 1000 patient years and represents the most common epilepsy-related cause of death. The presence and frequency of generalised tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS), male sex, early age of seizure onset, duration of epilepsy, and polytherapy are all predictors of risk of SUDEP. The exact pathophysiology of SUDEP is currently unknown, although GTCS-induced cardiac, respiratory, and brainstem dysfunction appears likely. Appropriately chosen antiepileptic drug treatment can render around 70% of patients free of all seizures. However, around one-third will remain drug refractory despite polytherapy. Continuing seizures place patients at risk of SUDEP, depression, and reduced quality of life. Preventative strategies for SUDEP include reducing the occurrence of GTCS by timely referral for presurgical evaluation in people with lesional epilepsy and advice on lifestyle measures; detecting cardiorespiratory distress through clinical observation and seizure, respiratory, and heart rate monitoring devices; preventing airway obstruction through nocturnal supervision and safety pillows; reducing central hypoventilation through physical stimulation and enhancing serotonergic mechanisms of respiratory regulation using selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs); reducing adenosine and endogenous opioid-induced brain and brainstem depression."

We also aimed to investigate whether alexithymia was associated with reduced cognitive insight. Patients (n=153) were administered the State- Trait Anxiety Inventory-State subscale, the Beck Depression Inventory, the Toronto Alexithymia Scale, and the Beck Cognitive Insight Scale (BCIS). Alexithymia could help differentiate a group of patients with low respiratory functioning. Twenty-two percent of patients included in this subsample had airway obstruction, and 51% reported severe alexithymia. Patients with severe airway obstruction and high alexithymia (compared to other patients) also reported higher self-reflectiveness, and more depressive symptoms. Clinicians have to be aware of the presence of a subgroup of asthma patients with low respiratory functioning who report severe alexithymia. These patients often report moderate to severe depression and frequent doubts about one's own beliefs."

CD012347,0,27089450,0,Personality Traits and Mental Symptoms are Associated with Impact of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease on Patients' Daily Life.,"Previous research has shown that personality traits are associated with self-reported health status in the general population. COPD Assessment Test (CAT) is increasingly used to assess health status such as the impact of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) on patients' daily life, but knowledge about the influence of personality traits on CAT score is lacking. The aim of this study was to examine the influence of Big Five personality traits on CAT score and the relation between personality traits and mental symptoms with respect to their influence on CAT score. A sample of 168 patients diagnosed with COPD was consecutively recruited in a secondary care outpatient clinic. All participants completed CAT, NEO Five-Factor Inventory, and Hospital Depression and Anxiety Scale. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to explore the association between personality traits and CAT scores and how this association was influenced by mental symptoms. The personality traits neuroticism, agreeableness and conscientiousness; and the mental symptoms depression and anxiety showed significant influence on CAT score when analysed in separate regression models. Identical R-square (R = 0.24) was found for personality traits and mental symptoms, but combining personality traits and mental symptoms in one regression model showed substantially reduced effect estimates of neuroticism, conscientiousness and anxiety, reflecting the strong correlations between personality traits and mental symptoms. We found that the impact of COPD on daily life measured by CAT was related to personality and mental symptoms, which illustrates the necessity of taking individual differences in personality and mental status into account in the management of COPD."

Furthermore chronic respiratory disease is associated with increased risk for anxiety and depression. In the light of these data further studies investigating the effects of emotional status on quality of life and exercise performance in patients with COPD are needed in order to improve treatment modalities. This study was peformed to reveal emotional status on pulmonary function, quality of life, and exercise performance in patients with COPD. 52 (F/M = 13/39, mean age= 67 +/- 12 years) irreversible for bronchodilator test COPD patients (FEV(1)= 1.5 +/- 0.6 L) included to our study. Short form- 36, Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI), pulmonary function tests and 6-minute walking test (6-MWT) were performed to all patients. There was no significant difference between 17 patients with severe to very severe airway obstruction according to GOLD classification (mean FEV(1)= 0.95 +/- 0.2 L) and 35 patients with moderate airway obstruction (mean FEV(1)= 1.75 +/- 0.56 L) in terms of emotional status, exercise performance, and quality of life. Significant corelation was found between BDI and; FEV(1)(p= 0.02, r= -0.323), general health perception (p= 0.001, r= -0.451), vitality (p= 0.000, r= -0.619), general mental health (p= 0.000, r= -0.643), and physical function (p= 0.002, r= -0.426). No correlation was found between 6 MWT and emotional status, and quality of life. In this study it was demonstrated that airway obstruction has an important role for exercise limitation and emotional status related to impaired PFT and quality of life in patients with COPD. We conclude that respiratory intervention together with psychocologic interventions should be performed on patients with COPD by clinicians to achieve improved quality of life."

CD012347,0,18761599,0,Determinants of subjective sleepiness in suspected obstructive sleep apnoea.,"Although daytime sleepiness is commonly associated with obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), the relationship between OSA severity and subjective sleepiness has been documented elusive. This study aimed to identify clinical and polysomnographic determinants of subjective sleepiness among patients suspected of having OSA. A sleep clinic-based sample of 915 patients was interviewed with a structured questionnaire and underwent diagnostic overnight polysomnography. Subjective sleepiness was quantified by Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). Excessive daytime sleepiness (defined as ESS score > 10) was present in 38.8% of patients. In multiple linear regression analysis, respiratory disturbance index [RDI; used to define (whenever RDI was >5) and quantify OSA], depression and diabetes were the most important determinants of ESS score accounting for 17%, 11% and 6% of its variability respectively. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), stroke, heart disease, alcohol use and body mass index were less important determinants of ESS score explaining 1-3% of its variability. In conclusion, OSA should not be considered the sole potential cause of increased subjective sleepiness in patients suspected of having OSA. Primarily depression and diabetes, but also COPD, stroke, heart disease, alcohol use and increased body mass index may contribute to increased subjective sleepiness."
CD012347,0,17388769,0,The psychologic consequences of chronic dyspnea in chronic pulmonary obstruction disease: the effects of acupressure on depression.,The onset of depression is often triggered by breathlessness in persons with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It is hypothesized that these are the psychologic consequences of chronic dyspnea. Lessening dyspnea might alleviate depressive symptoms. Acupressure has been shown in other studies to produce relaxation. The aim of this study was to determine if it would lessen dyspnea and reduce depression in patients with COPD.

CD012347,0,10707942,0,Bactericidal activity of a monocytic cell line (THP-1) against common respiratory tract bacterial pathogens is depressed after infection with respiratory syncytial virus.,"Non-typable Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are commonly isolated from patients during the course of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Earlier studies found that virus infection enhanced binding of bacterial respiratory pathogens to epithelial cells in vitro. The objective of the present study was to assess the effect of RSV infection of a human monocytic cell line on bactericidal activity and cytokine production in response to these bacterial respiratory pathogens. The effect of RSV infection on binding, uptake and intracellular killing of bacteria by a human monocytic leukaemia cell line, THP-1, was assessed. Cell culture supernates were examined with a mouse fibroblast cell assay for tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) bioactivity. Expression of CD14, CD11a, CD18, CD15 and CD29 on uninfected and RSV-infected THP-1 cells was assessed by flow cytometry in relation to differences in bacterial binding. RSV infection of THP-1 cells significantly decreased their ability to bind and kill bacteria. Compared with uninfected cells, fewer bacteria bound to RSV-infected THP-1 cells and the surface antigens that have been reported to bind bacteria were expressed at lower levels on RSV-infected cells. RSV-infected cells incubated with bacteria exhibited less TNF-alpha bioactivity than uninfected cell incubated with bacteria. The results elucidate some of the mechanisms involved in the increased susceptibility of virus-infected patients to secondary bacterial infection. Reduced bacterial killing by virus-infected monocytes might contribute to reduced clearance of bacteria from the respiratory tract and damage elicited by the bacteria or cytokine response in COPD patients."

CD012347,0,8728734,0,[Clinical effects of inspiratory muscle training in patients with chronic airflow limitation].,"The clinical role of inspiratory muscle training (IMT) in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has not been established, because data on its clinical effect is scarce and controversial. To further investigate these aspects we studied 20 COPD patients (FEV1 37 +/- 3% P) who were randomly and double blindly trained for 30 minutes a day during 10 weeks using a threshold inspiratory trainer with either 30% (group 1) or 10% (group 2) of PIMax as a training load. The training load was crossed after each patient completed 10 weeks of training. Effects were assessed through changes in PIMax, dyspnea through the transition dyspnea index (ITD) and the respiratory effort with Borg's score. Walking capacity was measured with the six minutes walking distance test (6WD) and depression symptoms with Beck's score. Daily life activities were also assessed. Results showed that after 10 weeks of IMT, PIMax increased in both groups (p < 0.05), dyspnea improved in group 1 as compared to group 2 (p < 0.04), 6WD increased significantly in patients of group 1, who also complained of less dyspnea (p < 0.05). Depression scores fell significantly in group 2. Daily activities improved more in group 1. After the crossover patients in group 1 disclosed a significant deterioration in PIMax whereas group 2 disclosed significant improvements in PIMax, dyspnea and 6WD. We conclude that IMT using a threshold device with 30% PIMax is a useful procedure for the treatment of severe COPD patients."

The objective of this study was to examine the impact of age on psychological and clinical outcomes among individuals with AATD-associated COPD. 468 individuals with AATD-associated COPD (age 32-84 at baseline) completed questionnaires at baseline, 1- and 2-year follow-up. Age was examined as a predictor of depression, anxiety, health-related quality of life, and breathlessness at all three time points using linear mixed models. Age was associated with anxiety (b = -0.09, SE = 0.02, p < 0.001) and health-related quality of life (b = -0.29, SE = 0.09, p < 0.001). Age also had a statistically significant interaction with relationship status when predicting depression, health-related quality of life, and breathlessness. Among individuals who were single, younger age was associated with more symptoms of depression (b = -0.08, SE = 0.03, p < 0.01), worse health-related quality of life (b = -0.61, SE = 0.16, p < 0.001), and more breathlessness (b = -0.023, SE = 0.009, p < 0.01) throughout the 2-year study. Age was not associated with these three outcomes among individuals who were married/part of an unmarried couple. Results suggest that individuals who develop a chronic illness at a young age, particularly those who are single, may be more likely to have worse psychological and clinical outcomes."

Patients completed the 4MGS and 5STS tests, with quantitative (in seconds) and qualitative ordinal data collected; the latter were categorized using a scale of 0 to 4. The following potential covariates and clinical determinants of poor 6MWT were collated: age, quadriceps muscle-strength (QMS), health status, dyspnea, depression, and airflow limitation. Area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve data (AUC) was used to assess accuracy, with logistic regression used to explore relevance as clinical determinants.The AUCs generated using the 4MGS and 5STS tests were comparable, at 0.719 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.629-0.809) and 0.711 (95% CI 0.613-0.809), respectively. With ordinal data, the 5STS test was most accurate (AUC of 0.732; 95% CI 0.645-0.819); the 4MGS test showed poor discriminatory power (AUC <0.7), although accuracy improved (0.726, 95% CI 0.637-0.816) when covariates were included. Unlike the 4MGS test, the 5STS test provided a significant clinical determinant of a poor 6MWT (odds ratio 1.23, 95% CI 1.05-1.44).The 5STS test reliably predicts a poor 6MWT, especially when using ordinal data.

Preliminary results].,"Improvement in the bronchial obstruction is the aim of treatment for patients with chronic bronchitis. In this work, we attempted to identify subjective psychosocial and neurophysiological factors which are essential for understanding the quality of life in these patients. The study included 77 male patients under 80 years of age who were diagnosed as having chronic bronchitis by their family physician. In all cases, the disease state was stable without any other complication or co-morbidity. Each patient responded to a questionnaire and underwent volume-flow tests. The population was divided into 2 groups by VEMS: VEMS > or = 50% (n = 48) and VEMS < 50 (n = 19). Main component analysis followed by varimax rotation was used to analyse data. A Cronbach coefficient was calculated to measure data skewness. The Pearson correlations were calculated for the different factors. Mean intergroup means were compared with the unpaired t test. Data analysis demonstrated two physical factors: dyspnea and bronchial obstruction; 4 psychological factors: anxiety, impotency/hopeless feeling, depression, fatigue: and one psychological trait. Key symptoms of chronic bronchitis developed in patients with affective states contributing to the patient's subjective description of his disease and influencing therapeutic management.

In a population-based sample of male veterans who responded to a cross-sectional survey using the validated short-form 36 for veterans (SF-36 V) and had undergone primary TKA prior to survey, eight SF-36 V domain and two summary scores (physical and mental component (PCS and MCS) summary) were compared using multivariable-adjusted multiple linear regressions between patients with and without five comorbidities--chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)/asthma, diabetes, depression, hypertension, and heart disease. Analyses were adjusted for age, five comorbidities, and time since TKA. Two hundred ninety-three male patients constituted the analytic set with mean (SD) age of 70.3 (8.8) years; 97% were Caucasian and mean (SD) duration since TKA was 2.1 (0.7) years.

CD012347,0,12586046,0,[Asthma patients' perception of dyspnea during acute bronchoconstriction].,"The aim of this study was to analyze variations in the perception of acute bronchial obstruction among asthmatics in our practice and to try to define the variables that influence inter-individual differences. We studied 153 asthmatics in stable condition, using a Borg scale to measure dyspnea perceived during a histamine bronchial challenge test. To study individual perception we analyzed both absolute magnitude of perception of dyspnea on the Borg scale when forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) fell 20% (perception score 20-PS20) and the mathematical difference between PS20 and baseline dyspnea (change in Borg, CB). The results were as follows. 1) The factors that affected PS20 according to multiple linear regression were anxiety, baseline dyspnea and the provocative concentration required to produce a 20% fall in FEV1 (PC20). 2) Within each level of asthma severity, there were differences in dyspnea perception when FEV1 fell 20% (analysis of variance of repeated measures), such that patients with mild asthma and no bronchial obstruction perceived more change in dyspnea. 3) CB during the bronchial challenge test distinguished four ways of perceiving dyspnea: 15% were dysperceivers, 13% were hypoperceivers, 48% were normoperceivers and 24% were hyperperceivers. 4) Hypoperceivers and dysperceivers were at greater risk of severe exacerbation whereas hyperperceivers requested unnecessary medical consultations. 5) Subjects with poorer quality of life were usually dysperceivers; hyperperceivers were the second most common type among those with poorer quality of life. In conclusion, a large percentage of asthmatics do not appropriately perceive acute bronchial obstruction, and the simplest way to evaluate their perception is to calculate the change in dyspnea (on a Borg scale) during the bronchial challenge test. The manner of perceiving dyspnea can not be predicted beforehand, yet it has a significant impact on the use of medical resources and patient quality of life, among other aspects."

Depressiveness was assessed with the beck depression inventory (BDI); anxiety symptoms were measured with the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory Part 1 and 2, and cognitive function levels were estimated with the Trail Making Test Part A and B. A score above the threshold indicative for depression was found by 33 % (n = 8) of COPD patients, 29 % (n = 5) of asthma patients compared to 0.05 % (n = 1) of the control group. Clinically relevant anxiety levels were found in 42 % (n = 10) of the COPD group, 41 % (n = 7) of the asthma patients and 17 % (n = 3) of the controls. Patients with COPD performed significantly worse on the TMT than other groups. Psychoemotional state and cognitive functions were found to be correlated with exposure to tobacco smoke (measured in pack-years) and airway obstruction (measured with FEV1). In conclusion, patients with mild to moderate asthma and COPD exhibit significantly higher levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms as well as cognitive dysfunctions than controls. The prevalence of these symptoms is related to the amount of exposure to tobacco smoke and the severity of airflow obstruction."

It is one of the major causes of morbidity, disability and mortality in the older population.

CD012347,0,23942824,0,Physical comorbidity and its relevance on mortality in schizophrenia: a naturalistic 12-year follow-up in general hospital admissions.,"Schizophrenia is a major psychotic disorder with significant comorbidity and mortality. Patients with schizophrenia are said to suffer more type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and diabetogenic complications. However, there is little consistent evidence that comorbidity with physical diseases leads to excess mortality in schizophrenic patients. Consequently, we investigated whether the burden of physical comorbidity and its relevance on hospital mortality differed between patients with and without schizophrenia in a 12-year follow-up in general hospital admissions. During 1 January 2000 and 31 June 2012, 1418 adult patients with schizophrenia were admitted to three General Manchester NHS Hospitals. All comorbid diseases with a prevalemce ≥1% were compared with those of 14,180 age- and gender-matched hospital controls. Risk factors, i.e. comorbid diseases that were predictors for general hospital mortality were identified using multivariate logistic regression analyses. Compared with controls, schizophrenic patients had a higher proportion of emergency admissions (69.8 vs. 43.0%), an extended average length of stay at index hospitalization (8.1 vs. 3.4 days), a higher number of hospital admissions (11.5 vs. 6.3), a shorter length of survival (1895 vs. 2161 days), and a nearly twofold increased mortality rate (18.0 vs. 9.7%). Schizophrenic patients suffered more depression, T2DM, alcohol abuse, asthma, COPD, and twenty-three more diseases, many of them diabetic-related complications or other environmentally influenced conditions. In contrast, hypertension, cataract, angina, and hyperlipidaemia were less prevalent in the schizophrenia population compared to the control population. In deceased schizophrenic patients, T2DM was the most frequently recorded comorbidity, contributing to 31.4% of hospital deaths (only 14.4% of schizophrenic patients with comorbid T2DM survived the study period). Further predictors of general hospital mortality in schizophrenia were found to be alcoholic liver disease (OR = 10.3), parkinsonism (OR = 5.0), T1DM (OR = 3.8), non-specific renal failure (OR = 3.5), ischaemic stroke (OR = 3.3), pneumonia (OR = 3.0), iron-deficiency anaemia (OR = 2.8), COPD (OR = 2.8), and bronchitis (OR = 2.6). There were no significant differences in their impact on hospital mortality compared to control subjects with the same diseases except parkinsonism which was associated with higher mortality in the schizophrenia population compared with the control population. The prevalence of parkinsonism was significantly elevated in the 255 deceased schizophrenic patients (5.5 %) than in those 1,163 surviving the study period (0.8 %, OR = 5.0) and deceased schizophrenic patients had significantly more suffered extrapyramidal symptoms than deceased control subjects (5.5 vs. 1.5 %). Therefore patients with schizophrenia have a higher burden of physical comorbidity that is associated with a worse outcome in a 12-year follow-up of mortality in general hospitals compared with hospital controls. However, schizophrenic patients die of the same physical diseases as their peers without schizophrenia. The most relevant physical risk factors of general hospital mortality are T2DM, COPD and infectious respiratory complications, iron-deficiency anaemia, T1DM, unspecific renal failure, ischaemic stroke, and alcoholic liver disease. Additionally, parkinsonism is a major risk factor for general hospital mortality in schizophrenia. Thus, optimal monitoring and management of acute T2DM and COPD with its infectious respiratory complications, as well as the accurate detection and management of iron-deficiency anaemia, of diabetic-related long-term micro- and macrovascular complications, of alcoholic liver disease, and of extrapyramidal symptoms are of utmost relevance in schizophrenia."

CD012347,0,9660321,0,The specificity of the CDT assay in general practice: the influence of common chronic diseases and medication on the serum CDT concentration.,"Early recognition of alcohol problems by general practitioners might be enhanced by the use of better alcohol markers. Several studies have revealed promising results for the carbohydrate-deficient transferrin (CDT) assay in certain populations. The aim of our study was to examine the specificity of the CDT assay in a general practice population. The main research question was whether common chronic diseases and/or the accompanying prescribed drugs have a negative influence on the specificity of the CDT assay. The 524 men who participated were selected from seven general practices and were suffering from one or more of the following diseases: hypertension, asthma/bronchitis, diabetes mellitus, adipositis/lipid metabolism disorder, angina pectoris, depression, and disorders of the digestive tract. None of the studied diseases or of the accompanying prescribed drugs had an influence on the specificity of the CDT assay. The overall specificity in this general practitioner population was 0.92. It can be concluded that the studied diseases do not bear an influence on the serum CDT concentration, and that, therefore, the CDT assay is a highly specific instrument for use in assessing alcohol consumption in general practice patients."
CD012347,0,16022053,0,"The Dartmouth COOP Charts: a simple, reliable, valid and responsive quality of life tool for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.","The negative impact of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) on health-related quality of life (HRQL) is substantial. Measurement of HRQL is increasingly advocated in clinical practice; traditional outcome measures such as lung function are poorly responsive. However many HRQL tools are not user-friendly in the clinic setting. Hence HRQL is often neglected. The Dartmouth Cooperative Functional Assessment Charts (COOP) have the requisite attributes of a tool suitable for routine clinical practice: they are simple, reliable, quick and easy to perform and score and well accepted. We aimed to determine the reliability, validity and responsiveness of the COOP in patients with significant COPD. HRQL was assessed during a prospective, randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, 12 week cross-over interventional study of ambulatory oxygen in patients (n = 50) with COPD. Test-retest reliability of the COOP domains was only modest however it was measured over a 2 month period. Significant correlations ranging between 0.4 and 0.8 were observed between all comparable domains of the COOP and the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short-form Health Survey, Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire (CRQ) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD) scale. Following ambulatory oxygen significant improvements were noted in all CRQ and HAD domains. Several domains of the generic SF-36 (role emotional, social functioning, role-physical) showed significant improvements. Comparable domains of the COOP (social activities, feelings) also showed significant improvements. The COOP change in health domain improved very significantly. The COOP is a simple, reliable HRQL tool which proved valid and responsive in our study population of COPD patients and may have a valuable role in routine clinical practice."

Ninety three patients aged 45-77 yrs with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and using domiciliary nebulizers were recruited from a hospital database. They completed the St George's respiratory questionnaire (SGRQ)-1 and the hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS) and attended a semistructured interview. Their usual nebulizers were replaced by Dataloggers, which record the date, time and duration of each treatment, to use for 4 weeks. The SGRQ was then repeated (SGRQ-2). Eighty two patients completed the study. Fifty six percent were poorly adherent; taking less than 70% of the dose prescribed (or less than 60% on regimens of > or = 5 times daily). The total scores on the SGRQ-2 were negatively correlated with percentage adherence. Multiple regression analysis showed that the SGRQ-2 total score was associated with percentage adherence, depression score, feeling supported by clinic staff, and patients feeling that they tried to ignore their chest disease. Patients who report poor quality of life are more likely to be depressed, feel unsupported by clinic staff and be poorly adherent to treatment. Increased levels of clinic support, with the addition of psychological treatments, may be of benefit to some patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease."

CD012347,0,16790039,1,Effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a minimal psychological intervention to reduce non-severe depression in chronically ill elderly patients: the design of a randomised controlled trial [ISRCTN92331982].,"Depression is a prevalent disorder in chronically ill elderly persons. It may decrease quality of life, and increase functional disability, medical costs, and healthcare utilisation. Because patients may slip into a downward spiral, early recognition and treatment of depression is important. Depression can be treated with antidepressants or psychological interventions; the latter can also be applied by trained paraprofessionals. In this paper, we describe the design of the DELTA study (Depression in Elderly with Long-Term Afflictions). The first objective of the DELTA study is to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a minimal psychological intervention (MPI) to reduce depression in chronically ill elderly patients. The second objective is to evaluate whether a potential effect of the MPI may differ between types of chronic illnesses.

The degree of anxiety correlates well with perceived dyspnoea. This pilot study examines the effect of group psychotherapy on anxiety, exercise tolerance, dyspnoea and quality of life. Ten patients with moderately severe, stable COPD (mean forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1)-1.15 L) had six 90 min sessions of cognitive and behavioural psychotherapy at weekly intervals. Patients completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Medical Research Council Questionnaire (MRCQ) and St George's Respiratory Questionnaires (SGRQ), 1 week before and after therapy. FEV1, forced vital capacity (FVC), slow vital capacity (SVC), blood gas tensions and 6 min walking distance (6MWD) were measured. Eight control patients attended weekly for lung function and 6MWD for 6 weeks, but had no psychotherapy. Mean baseline HADS score was significantly higher in the psychotherapy group (12) than in controls (7), but otherwise there were no differences in lung function, blood gas tensions, 6MWD, or the other questionnaire scores between groups. After treatment, the physiological and psychological parameters where unchanged in both groups with the exception of the mean 6MWD, which had improved in the psychotherapy group only, from 351 to 423 m (p<0.001), an increase of 24%. Three months after treatment, the 6MWD was still 16% above the baseline value (p=0.02). In conclusion, six sessions of cognitive and behavioural psychotherapy produced a sustained improvement in exercise tolerance in a group of 10 anxious patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, without any change in anxiety scores on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Further studies of more prolonged, intensive psychotherapy would establish whether better symptom and quality of life scores accompany more dramatic increases in exercise tolerance in ""pink puffers""."

It contains eight items: dyspnea, anxiety, depressed mood, sleep, energy, daily activities, social activities and sexual life. Psychometric properties were assessed during a clinical trial that evaluated the impact of tiotropium on HRQoL of COPD patients. These included the determination of structure, internal consistency reliability, concurrent validity with the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), test - retest reliability, clinical validity and responsiveness to change over two weeks. Minimal important difference (MID) was calculated; cumulative response curves (CRC) were based on the dyspnea item. Psychometric analyses showed that VSRQ structure was unidimensional. The questionnaire demonstrated good internal consistency reliability (Cronbach's alpha = 0.84), good concurrent validity with SGRQ (Spearman = -0.70) and clinical validity, good test-retest reproducibility (ICC = 0.77), and satisfactory responsiveness (standardized response mean = 0.57; Guyatt's statistic = 0.63). MID was 3.4; CRC median value of the 'minimally improved' patients was 3.5. In conclusion, VSRQ brevity and satisfactory psychometric properties make it a good candidate for large studies to assess HRQoL in COPD patients. Further validation is needed to extend its use in clinical practice."

We investigated whether the severity of COPD is associated with the complication of SAHS by examination of nocturnal oximetry as an alternative to polysomnography. Patients with COPD concurrently completed nocturnal oximetry, pulmonary function tests, a COPD assessment test, an Epworth sleepiness scale and a hospital anxiety and depression scale to evaluate the severity of COPD and possible concurrent presence of SAHS. We retrospectively analysed the data to assess correlation between the oxygen desaturation index (ODI) and each clinical variables and evaluated the predictors of ODI ≥ 15. This study included 103 patients (91 males, 88%) with a mean age of 72 ± 8 years and body mass index of 22 ± 3 kg/m(2). ODI was positively correlated with FEV1, FEV1/FVC and FEV1% predicted, which meant that ODI was inversely correlated with airflow limitation. Univariate logistic regression analysis revealed that FEV1% predicted and FEV1/FVC were predictors of ODI ≥ 15. ODI is inversely correlated with airflow limitation and milder COPD patients may have co-morbid SAHS."

CD012347,0,11313075,0,"Depression, anxiety comorbidity, and disability in tuberculosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients: applicability of GHQ-12.","Our aim was to study anxiety and/or depression comorbidity and the influence of these comorbid conditions on disability for 3 clinical groups of pulmonary tuberculosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We also investigated the applicability of General Health Questionnaire 12 (GHQ12) for these clinical groups as a simple screening test for psychiatric comorbidity. A total of 157 male inpatients were included in the study: 42 with recently diagnosed (RDtb), 39 with defaulted (Dtb), 39 with multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDRtb) and 38 with COPD. The presence of depression and anxiety was assessed by Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI). Disability was evaluated by Brief Disability Questionnaire. The validity of GHQ12 for the study groups was examined in order to determine a functional cut-off point. Depression and/or anxiety comorbidity was 19% for RDtb, 21.6% for Dtb, 25.6% for MDRtb and 47.3% for COPD. Patients with psychiatric comorbidity had higher disability scores than the group without psychiatric comorbidity. For the tuberculosis group a 3/4 cut-off point of GHQ had 80.7% sensitivity and 87.1% specificity while a 5/6 cut-off point with 83.3% sensitivity and 80% specificity was applicable to the COPD group."

To determine the sedative and respiratory effects of clonidine when used to evaluate growth hormone (GH) secretion in children with Prader Willi Syndrome (PWS). Methods. The study prospectively evaluated children with PWS who received clonidine (0.15 mg/m(2)) to assess GH responsiveness. Patients were studied up to four times over three years. Vital signs, oxygen saturation, and sedation level were recorded at baseline and every five minutes following clonidine. Changes between baseline and post-clonidine were evaluated using a repeated measurement analysis. Results. Sixty studies were performed on 17 patients, mean age 30.4 +/- 15.0 months. The mean +/- SD dose of clonidine was 0.074 +/- 0.027 mg (5.3 +/- 1.72 mcg/kg). All patients achieved a sedation score of 4 to 5 (drowsy to asleep). Mean declines in respiratory rate (7.5 +/- 6.1 breaths/min; P < .001), and oxygen saturation (2.2 +/- 2.0%; P < .001) occurred following clonidine. Five patients (29%) experienced oxygen saturations </=94% on nine occasions. Three oxygen desaturations were accompanied by partial airway obstruction. Conclusions. Clonidine doses to assess GH secretion often exceed doses used for sedation and result in significant respiratory depression in some children with PWS. There was no association between oxygen desaturation and BMI."
CD012347,0,1592618,0,Clinical markers of asthma severity and risk: importance of subjective as well as objective factors.,"The purpose of this study was to explore patient perceptions of asthma severity and danger from asthma, correlate them with objective measures, and assess the impact of psychologic variables on the perception of severity. Recognition of patients at greatest risk for fatal attacks requires identifying those with severe asthma. In our study of 95 adults with asthma, we found that the subjective factors of perceived severity and perceived danger and the objective factors of medications, hospitalizations, history of intubation, and pulmonary function were important markers of asthma severity and risk. Our findings indicate that asthmatic adults make independent self-assessments that generally correlate with objective markers of increased risk of mortality and increased severity of the asthma. The perception of high severity was significantly correlated with depression, panic-fear, frequency of emergency department visits, and with an objective index of risk of death. The latter includes variables obtainable from history alone (number of medications to control symptoms, need for prednisone, prior intubation, and prior recent hospitalization) and is correlated with spirometric indexes of airflow obstruction, occurrence of nocturnal symptoms, and number of emergency department visits."
CD012347,0,23853488,0,Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease assessment test can predict depression: a prospective multi-center study.,"This study was conducted to investigate the association between the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) assessment test (CAT) and depression in COPD patients. The Korean versions of the CAT and patient health questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) were used to assess COPD symptoms and depressive disorder, respectively. In total, 803 patients with COPD were enrolled from 32 hospitals and the prevalence of depression was 23.8%. The CAT score correlated well with the PHQ-9 score (r=0.631; P<0.001) and was significantly associated with the presence of depression (β±standard error, 0.452±0.020; P<0.001). There was a tendency toward increasing severity of depression in patients with higher CAT scores. By assessment groups based on the 2011 Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease guidelines, the prevalence of depression was affected more by current symptoms than by airway limitation. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the CAT was 0.849 for predicting depression, and CAT scores ≥21 had the highest accuracy rate (80.6%). Among the eight CAT items, energy score showed the best correlation and highest power of discrimination. CAT scores are significantly associated with the presence of depression and have good performance for predicting depression in COPD patients."

CD012347,0,12870833,0,Determinants of dyspnea in patients with different grades of stable asthma.,"Dyspnea is a main feature of symptomatology in asthma, and its perception does not necessarily correlates well with airway obstruction. The aim of this study was twofold: (1) to identify factors determining the subjective degree of dyspnea in patients with different grades of stable bronchial asthma and (2) to compare various clinical methods existing for grading dyspnea. The investigation comprised 153 outpatients with stable asthma. The parameters studied were the following: demographic characteristic of subjects, baseline dyspnea score by means of three clinical instruments (baseline dyspnea index [BDI], Medical Research Council [MRC] scale, and modified Borg scale), asthma severity, standard measures of physiologic lung function, anxiety, depression, subconscious illness attention, and asthma-related quality of life (HRQOL). The dyspnea scores were all significantly interrelated (r=0.77-0.85, p<0.001). The three clinical scales for grading dyspnea were significantly correlated with the same parameters: airflow obstruction, lung hyperinflation, emotional factors, HRQOL, age, age at asthma onset, asthma duration, female gender, clinical severity, and lower economical, and educational levels. Multiple regression analysis showed that independent factors determining clinical dyspnea scores were: age, airway obstruction, and emotional status. Moreover, in patients with severe asthma, lung hyperinflation helped to explain the individual dyspnea score. These data suggest that clinical methods are appropriate for evaluating the impact of dyspnea on daily activities of asthmatic patients. BDI, MRC, and Borg clinical dyspnea scales showed similarly information in subjects with asthma. Independently of asthma severity, older age, airway obstruction, and psychological disturbance were associated with higher degree of dyspnea. However, if subjects had severe airway obstruction, lung hyperinflation was a major determinant of baseline dyspnea score."

The aim of this study was to analyse the interrelationships between health status, anxiety, depression and physical status in COPD patients being discharged after hospitalisation. This was a prospective study of 416 patients in five university hospitals in each of the Nordic countries. Data included demographic information, lung function and co-morbidity. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) were applied to all patients. Both anxiety and depression were common among these patients. Anxiety was more common in women than in men (47% vs. 34%, P=0.009) and current smokers had a higher prevalence of both anxiety (54% vs. 37%) and depression (43% vs. 23%) than non-smokers (P<0.01). In general, the studied COPD patients had poor health status, especially those with anxiety, depression or both. Psychological status was independently related to all dimensions of SGRQ. Higher GOLD stages were significantly associated with increasing impairment in health status. In conclusion this multicentre study showed that anxiety and depression are common in patients with COPD, and, furthermore, that patients with psychological disorders have poor health status. Screening for depression and anxiety may help to identify patients with poor quality of life and an urgent need for intervention in order to improve their health status."

A questionnaire was administered to collect data related to clinical health outcomes and demographic characteristics. Participants were asked to report their average sleep duration per night in hours.  Results: One-third (33.8%) reported short sleep duration of less than 7 hours/night. Short sleep duration was more prevalent in females (37.3% versus 31.4%, p=0.004). The most common medical problems reported were obesity with body mass index of greater than 30 Kg/m2 (39.1%), hypertension (33.9%), diabetes mellitus (20.8%), depression (4.3%), asthma (17.3%), COPD (6.6%), and hyperlipidemia (2.7%). Diabetes mellitus was associated with long sleep of more than 9 hours/night (25.4%, p=0.011) and hypertension (54.2%, p=0.001). The linear regression model tend to reduce their sleep duration by roughly 22 minutes in female gender, 66 minutes in participants with hyperlipidemia, and 70 minutes in participants with poor sleep quality.  Conclusions: Short sleep duration per night was prevalent, it affects one in every 3 Saudi adults.

Anxiety is associated with an impaired quality of life and increased hospital admissions. Untreated comorbid anxiety can have devastating consequences for both patients and their relatives. Non-pharmacological interventions, including cognitive-behavioural therapy, have been effective in managing anxiety and dyspnoea in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. However, the majority of existing interventions have tested the efficacy of relatively intensive comprehensive programmes and primarily targeted patients who have moderate pulmonary disease. We present the rationale and design for a trial that focused on addressing the challenges experienced by severe pulmonary disease populations. The trial investigates the efficacy of a minimal home-based psychoeducative intervention versus usual care for patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease."
CD012347,0,18036091,0,Association of Type D personality to perceived side effects and adherence in CPAP-treated patients with OSAS.,"Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the treatment of choice for obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS), but side effects are common and long-term adherence low. The Type D (distressed) personality is defined as a combination of negative affectivity and social inhibition. The association of Type D personality with adherence has not been studied in CPAP-treated patients with OSAS. This study aimed to describe the prevalence of Type D personality in OSAS patients with CPAP treatment longer than 6 months and the association with self-reported side effects and adherence. A cross-sectional descriptive design was used. A total of 247 OSAS patients with a mean use of CPAP treatment for 55 months (6-182 months) were included. Data collection was achieved by two questionnaires; the Type D scale 14 (DS14) (Type D personality), SECI (side effects of CPAP), as well as from medical records (clinical variables and objective adherence to CPAP treatment). Type D personality occurred in 30% of the patients with OSAS and significantly (P < 0.05-0.001) increased the perceived frequency and severity of a broad range of side effects. The objective adherence was significantly lower (P < 0.001) for OSAS patients with Type D compared to OSAS patients without Type D, both with regard to a mean use of 4 h per night and 85% of the self-rated sleep time per night. The additional effect of a Type D personality on perceived side effects and adherence to CPAP treatment found in this study could be used by healthcare personnel when evaluating patients waiting for treatment."

All three versions of the dyspnea self-management programs, which differed in the amount of supervised exercise (no sessions or four or 24 sessions), equally and significantly improved depressed mood. Subjects at high risk for depression at study entry who received 24 sessions had greater reduction in dyspnea than those who received four sessions or no sessions. Patients with COPD at high risk for depression are likely to achieve greater relief of dyspnea with self-management programs that include more intensive supervised exercise."

Consecutive medically hospitalized patients over age 50 with heart failure and/or chronic pulmonary disease were screened for MDD using the Structured Clinical Interview for Depression. Patients were re-evaluated at 6, 12, 18, and 24 weeks. Four depression-physical illness conjoint trajectories were examined: depression better, illness better; depression better, illness same; depression same, illness better; and depression same, illness same. Baseline predictors of trajectory were examined. MDD was identified in 413 patients; 352 had at least one follow-up. By 6 weeks, 22.3% improved on both depression and illness and 38.1% improved on neither. By 24 weeks, 45.0% had improved on both and 24.8% on neither. Short-term baseline predictors of trajectory (6 weeks) differed from long-term (12-24 weeks); past psychiatric history, overall medical illness severity, and education were short-term predictors, whereas past psychiatric history, depression treatments, and physical functioning were long-term. Improvements in MDD and physical illness track closely together. Characteristics during baseline hospitalization predict outcome trajectory after discharge, and may be useful in understanding etiology and directing treatment."

Our goal was to examine whether in a relatively nonobese population, OSA is associated with elevated cortisol levels and to assess the effects of a 2-month placebo-controlled continuous positive airway pressure (sham-CPAP) use.72 subjects (35 middle-aged males and post-menopausal females with OSA, and 37 male and female controls) were studied in the sleep laboratory for four nights. 24-h blood sampling was performed every hour on the fourth day and night in the sleep laboratory at baseline, after sham-CPAP and after CPAP treatment.In both apnoeic men and women, OSA was associated with significantly higher 24-h cortisol levels compared with controls, whereas CPAP lowered cortisol levels significantly, close to those of controls.These results suggest that OSA in nonobese men and slightly obese women is associated with HPA axis activation, similar albeit stronger compared with obese individuals with sleep apnoea. Short-term CPAP use decreased cortisol levels significantly compared with baseline, indicating that CPAP may have a protective effect against comorbidities frequently associated with chronic activation of the HPA axis, e.g. hypertension."
CD012347,0,22362263,0,[COPD-specific anxiety and depressive symptoms in COPD patients].,"The aim of the present study was to analyze the associations between COPD-specific anxiety and depressive symptoms in COPD patients. Anxiety, as well as depression, is a prevalent comorbid complication in COPD. Either can have a negative impact on patients' experience and the course of disease. So far, assessment in studies has exclusively focused on anxiety in general and not on disease-related fears. The present study comprised a sample of ninety-six patients suffering from COPD (GOLD III/IV). Results of the MANOVA showed higher COPD-specific anxiety in patients with depressive symptoms than in patients without depressive symptoms. Depressive patients showed a higher fear of social isolation, dyspnea related fear, fear of movement and fear of progression of disease. There were no differences between the two groups with regard to functional parameters (FEV 1 % pred.; 6-minute-walk-test). Overall, our study shows the necessity of the assessment of COPD-specific fears related to depression to guarantee an adequate treatment."

Two convenience samples of COPD patients--those who practice systematic movement by participating in a pulmonary exercise program (PEP) and those who do not--were obtained through the American Lung Association of Maryland. Demographic information and health history were obtained from the participants and their physicians. They all completed the vertical visual analogue dyspnea scale (VADS) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) on two occasions 8 weeks apart and described the strategies they used in dealing with their illness. Differences were found between the groups on the BDI and VADS at both measurement times. Those who participated in the program had lower depression (5.9 versus 17.75) and lower dyspnea (58.9 versus 78.8). These findings persisted 8 weeks later, with exercisers having depression levels of 5.5 versus 19 for the nonexercisers and dyspnea levels of 55.2 versus 79.4 for the nonexercisers. Exercisers used fewer emotion-focused coping strategies than nonexercisers. These findings have implications for the rehabilitation of COPD patients."

CD012347,0,27621232,0,The impact of depression in older patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma.,"Respiratory diseases are common in older people. However, the impact of comorbid depression in older patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma has not been fully explored. This narrative review examines the impact of comorbid depression and its management in COPD and asthma in older adults. The causes of depression in patients with COPD and asthma are multifactorial and include physical, physiological and behavioural factors. Depression is associated with hospital readmission in older adults with asthma and COPD. We focus on the most current literature that has examined the efficacy of pulmonary rehabilitation (PR), cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and antidepressant drug therapy for patients with depression in the context of COPD and asthma. Our findings indicate that PR and CBT are beneficial in improving depressive symptoms and quality of life in short-term intervention studies. However, the long-term efficacy of CBT and PR is unknown. To date, the efficacy of antidepressant drug therapy for depression in patients with COPD and asthma is inconclusive. In addition, there has been no clear evidence that antidepressants can induce remission of depression or ameliorate dyspnoea or physiological indices of COPD. Factors that contribute to 'inadequate' assessment and treatment of depression in patients with COPD and asthma may include misconception of the disease by patients and their caregivers and stigma attached to depression.

The author evaluated whether such patients had measurable pulmonary and neurobehavioral impairments by comparing consecutive cases in a series vs. a referent group. Sixty-five consecutive outpatients exposed to mold in their respective homes in Arizona, California, and Texas were compared with 202 community subjects who had no known mold or chemical exposures. Balance, choice reaction time, color discrimination, blink reflex, visual fields, grip, hearing, problem-solving, verbal recall, perceptual motor speed, and memory were measured. Medical histories, mood states, and symptom frequencies were recorded with checklists, and spirometry was used to measure various pulmonary volumes and flows. Neurobehavioral comparisons were made after individual measurements were adjusted for age, educational attainment, and sex. Significant differences between groups were assessed by analysis of variance; a p value of less than 0.05 was used for all statistical tests. The mold-exposed group exhibited decreased function for balance, reaction time, blink-reflex latency, color discrimination, visual fields, and grip, compared with referents. The exposed group's scores were reduced for the following tests: digit-symbol substitution, peg placement, trail making, verbal recall, and picture completion. Twenty-one of 26 functions tested were abnormal. Airway obstructions were found, and vital capacities were reduced. Mood state scores and symptom frequencies were elevated. The author concluded that indoor mold exposures were associated with neurobehavioral and pulmonary impairments that likely resulted from the presence of mycotoxins, such as trichothecenes."

Yet, a remarkable proportion of selected patients drop out from these programs. In this study, we investigated existing differences on psychological variables among COPD patients who complete and those who drop out from pulmonary rehabilitation programs. The study included 144 patients, 43 (29.9%) of whom did not complete the program. SCL-90 was used for the assessment of psychological symptoms. On the SCL-90-R scale 55.6% of patients had abnormal findings. Patients who discontinued the program had higher rates of depression and somatization compared to those who completed it. Regarding the psychopathology scales of SCL-90R, we found that patients who discontinued the program showed higher levels of psychopathology on the scales of somatization, depression, paranoid ideation, and psychotism compared to those who completed the program. The final regression model showed that patients with low educational status and psychotism were more likely to leave the program. In conclusion, psychopathology contributes to patients dropping out from a COPD rehabilitation program; thus, psychological assessment prior to inclusion in rehabilitation programs may reduce dropouts."

CD012347,0,26495843,0,Understanding Heroin Overdose: A Study of the Acute Respiratory Depressant Effects of Injected Pharmaceutical Heroin.,"Opioids are respiratory depressants and heroin/opioid overdose is a major contributor to the excess mortality of heroin addicts. The individual and situational variability of respiratory depression caused by intravenous heroin is poorly understood. This study used advanced respiratory monitoring to follow the time course and severity of acute opioid-induced respiratory depression. 10 patients (9/10 with chronic airflow obstruction) undergoing supervised injectable opioid treatment for heroin addiction received their usual prescribed dose of injectable opioid (diamorphine or methadone) (IOT), and their usual prescribed dose of oral opioid (methadone or sustained release oral morphine) after 30 minutes. The main outcome measures were pulse oximetry (SpO2%), end-tidal CO2% (ETCO2%) and neural respiratory drive (NRD) (quantified using parasternal intercostal muscle electromyography). Significant respiratory depression was defined as absence of inspiratory airflow >10s, SpO2% < 90% for >10s and ETCO2% per breath >6.5%. Increases in ETCO2% indicated significant respiratory depression following IOT in 8/10 patients at 30 minutes. In contrast, SpO2% indicated significant respiratory depression in only 4/10 patients, with small absolute changes in SpO2% at 30 minutes. A decline in NRD from baseline to 30 minutes post IOT was also observed, but was not statistically significant. Baseline NRD and opioid-induced drop in SpO2% were inversely related. We conclude that significant acute respiratory depression is commonly induced by opioid drugs prescribed to treat opioid addiction. Hypoventilation is reliably detected by capnography, but not by SpO2% alone. Chronic suppression of NRD in the presence of underlying lung disease may be a risk factor for acute opioid-induced respiratory depression."

Severely obese subjects receiving laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) surgery in 2009 (n = 11,769) were identified. Utilization of medical services and pharmaceuticals in the 3.5 years before surgery were ascertained for each severely obese subject through linkage with Medicare, Australia's universal health insurance scheme. Equivalent data were retrieved for each subject from the matched general population sample (n = 140,000). Severely obese subjects utilized significantly more medical services annually compared to the general population (mean: 22.8 vs. 12.1/person, standardized incidence ratio (SIR): 1.89 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.88-1.89)), translating to twofold higher mean annual costs (Australian $1,140 vs. $567/person). The greatest excess costs in the obese related to consultations with general practitioners, psychiatrists/psychologists and other specialists, investigations for obstructive sleep apnea, and in vitro fertilization. Severely obese subjects also utilized significantly more pharmaceutical prescriptions annually (mean: 11.4 vs. 5.3/person, SIR 2.18 (95% CI: 2.17-2.19)), translating to 2.2-fold higher mean annual costs ($595/person vs. $270/person). The greatest excess costs in the obese related to diabetes drugs, lipid-modifying agents, psychoanaleptics, acid-related disorder drugs, agents acting on the rennin-angiotensin system, immunosuppressants, and obstructive airway disease drugs. Overall, healthcare costs in the severely obese population were more than double those incurred by the general population."

The aim of the present study was to investigate whether the MRF-28 and SRI are reliable and valid HRQoL questionnaires in COPD patients with chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure (CHRF). In total, 72 COPD patients with CHRF underwent pulmonary function and exercise testing, and completed the MRF-28, the SRI, the Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire (CRQ), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Groningen Activity and Restriction Scale and two dyspnoea indexes. Physical domain scores of the questionnaires correlated with exercise tolerance, dyspnoea and daily activities, while psychological domains correlated strongly with anxiety and depression. Anxiety scores accounted for 51 and 56% of the total explained variance in total CRQ and SRI scores, respectively. The emphasis of the MRF-28 was restrictions in activities of daily living (52% of total variance). In conclusion, the present study showed that the Maugeri Respiratory Failure and Severe Respiratory Insufficiency questionnaires were reliable and valid questionnaires in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients with chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure. While the emphasis in the Maugeri Respiratory Failure questionnaire is on activities of daily living, the Severe Respiratory Insufficiency questionnaire, like the Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire, is more related to anxiety and depression."

This study allows cross disability comparisons with the hypothesis. Adults with disabilities had higher odds of having common health conditions, compared to adults without disability in the same practice. A retrospective record review of 1449 patients with disability and 2084 patients without disability included individuals with sensory impairments (n = 117), developmental disabilities (n = 692), trauma-related impairments (n = 155) and psychiatric impairments (n = 485). The only two health conditions with statistically significantly increased odds for all groups with disabilities were dementia and epilepsy. Patients with developmental disabilities were less likely to have coronary artery disease, cancer, and obesity. Those with sensory impairments had increased odds for congestive heart failure, diabetes, transient ischemic attacks and death. Patients with trauma disabilities had increased odds for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and depression. Finally, psychiatric patients had increased odds for most of the investigated condition. In conclusion, there were many similarities in the risk for common health conditions such as asthma, cancer, coronary artery disease, depression, hypertension, and obesity, among patients with and without disability. Some of the conditions with increased odds ratios, including depression, seizures, and dementia are secondary to the primary disability."

CD012347,0,24200541,0,[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: sense of coherence and family support versus anxiety and depression].,"Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is mainly related to smoking habit and is characterized by airflow limitation that is not fully reversible. The airflow limitation is usually both progressive and associated with an abnormal inflammatory response of the lungs to noxious particles or gases. Worldwide and in Greece, COPD constitutes a major epidemiological issue. Incidence of depression and anxiety is high in the COPD population. Most studies on depression and anxiety in COPD deal with factors that are positively correlated with both of these comorbidities. The aim of our study was to assess whether two variables, sense of coherence (SOC) and perception of family support (FS), are negatively correlated with depressive and anxiety symptoms in outpatients with COPD. According to Aaron Antonovsky, sense of coherence refers to the ability of individuals to make sense of and manage events. Studies in other diseases suggest that sense of family support has a significant impact on the course and outcome of the disease, yet a limited number of reports across literature addresses the role of family support in COPD patients. In our present study one hundred twenty two (98 men and 24 women) outpatients with pure COPD were included. Age and years of education were recorded. Severity of COPD was assessed with spirometry before and after bronchodilation. All patients replied to self- administered questionnaires on depression (Beck Depression Inventory, BDI), anxiety (Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Scale, STAI), family support (Family Support Scale, FSS-13) and sense of coherence (Sense of Coherence Scale, SOC). According to our results the mean BDI depression score was 11.65 (SD 7.35), mean trait anxiety score was 40.69 (SD 11.19), mean SOC score was 54.62 (SD 7.40) and mean FS score was 64.58 (SD 11.63). Women patients had higher anxiety scores and lower sense of family support compared to men. Significant negative correlations were evidenced between depression and sense of coherence as well as between anxiety and family support. Step-wise multiple linear regression analysis verified the results and quantified the aforementioned correlations. Notably, raising scores in sense of family support by one point reduces anxiety scores by 0.14 points, and increasing sense of coherence scores by one point reduces depression scores by 0.21 points. In sum, our study confirms the presence of high levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms in COPD patients, with females being in a more disadvantaged position as they tend to have higher levels of both. Sense of coherence and family support are both protective psychological factors against the risk of developing anxiety and depressive symptoms in these patients."

CD012347,0,24846772,0,Cognitive complaints in obstructive sleep apnea.,"Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with impairments in cognitive functioning. Although cognitive complaints are related to quality of life, work productivity and health care expenditures, most research and all reviews have focused exclusively on objective cognitive functioning so far. In this systematic review, we assessed the available literature on subjective measures of cognition in adult OSA patients. Concentration complaints were consistently found to be more severe in untreated OSA patients as compared to primary snorers and healthy controls. The same seems to be true for memory and executive function problems, but firm conclusions cannot be made as of yet, due to methodological limitations of the available studies. Cognitive complaints appear to be at least partially related to subjective sleepiness. Importantly, they are not necessarily a sign of objective cognitive impairment. Additional research is needed to explore the relation between cognitive complaints, sleepiness and mood problems using validated and norm-referenced questionnaires for cognitive complaints. In addition, the impact of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment on cognitive complaints in OSA warrants further study."

However, uptake and adherence to rehabilitation is poor and non-adherence is associated with poorer clinical outcomes. This study investigated the factors that might predict an individual completing his/her PR programme. Demographic, physiological and psychological data were collected from routine assessment information. Non-completers (N = 213) who dropped out after initial assessment were compared with completers (N = 438) who attended all 6 weeks of PR programme. Regression analysis indicated that smoking status was the strongest predictor for completing PR programme, that is, ex-smokers were 2.6 times (95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.7-3.9) and those who had never smoked were 2.5 times (95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.1-5.7) more likely to complete in comparison with those who were current smokers. Scoring better on psychological well-being measures (odds ratio = 1.6; 95% CI = 1.2-1.9) was also a strong predictor. The findings suggest the areas that could be addressed to enhance adherence to rehabilitation, for example, targeted interventions for clients who continue to smoke and for those who require support for psychological distress."

The objective of this study was to assess the effect of CPAP treatment in elderly patients with severe OSA on clinical, quality-of-life and neurocognitive spheres. We performed an open-label, randomised, multicentre clinical trial in a consecutive clinical cohort of 224 elderly (≥70 years old) patients with confirmed severe OSA (apnoea-hypopnea index ≥30) randomised to receive CPAP (n=115) or no CPAP (n=109) for 3 months. A sleep study was performed by either full polysomnography or respiratory polygraphy. CPAP titration was performed by an autoCPAP device. The primary endpoint was quality of life (Quebec Sleep Questionnaire) and secondary endpoints included sleep-related symptoms, presence of anxiety/depression, office-based blood pressure and some neurocognitive tests. The mean±sd age was 75.5±3.9 years. The CPAP group achieved a greater improvement in all quality-of-life domains (p<0.001; effect size: 0.41-0.98), sleep-related symptoms (p<0.001; effect size 0.31-0.91) as well as anxiety (p=0.016; effect size 0.51) and depression (p<0.001; effect size: 0.28) indexes and some neurocognitive tests (digit symbol test (p=0.047; effect size: 0.20) and Trail Making Test A (p=0.029; effect size: 0.44)) in an intention-to-treat analysis.

CD012347,0,26633680,0,Patient Preferences for Biologicals in Psoriasis: Top Priority of Safety for Cardiovascular Patients.,"Patients with psoriasis are often affected by comorbidities, which largely influence treatment decisions. Here we performed conjoint analysis to assess the impact of comorbidities on preferences of patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis for outcome (probability of 50% and 90% improvement, time until response, sustainability of success, probability of mild and severe adverse events (AE), probability of ACR 20 response) and process attributes (treatment location, frequency, duration and delivery method) of biologicals. The influence of comorbidities on Relative Importance Scores (RIS) was determined with analysis of variance and multivariate regression. Among the 200 participants completing the study, 22.5% suffered from psoriatic arthritis, 31.5% from arterial hypertension, 15% from cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary artery disease, and/or arterial occlusive disease), 14.5% from diabetes, 11% from hyperlipidemia, 26% from chronic bronchitis or asthma and 12.5% from depression. Participants with psoriatic arthritis attached greater importance to ACR 20 response (RIS = 10.3 vs. 5.0, p<0.001; β = 0.278, p<0.001) and sustainability (RIS = 5.8 vs. 5.0, p = 0.032) but less value to time until response (RIS = 3.4 vs. 4.8, p = 0.045) than those without arthritis. Participants with arterial hypertension were particularly interested in a low risk of mild AE (RIS 9.7 vs. 12.1; p = 0.033) and a short treatment duration (RIS = 8.0 vs. 9.6, p = 0.002). Those with cardiovascular disease worried more about mild AE (RIS = 12.8 vs. 10, p = 0.027; β = 0.170, p = 0.027) and severe AE (RIS = 23.2 vs. 16.2, p = 0.001; β = 0.203, p = 0.007) but cared less about time until response (β = -0.189, p = 0.013), treatment location (β = -0.153, p = 0.049), frequency (β = -0.20, p = 0.008) and delivery method (β = -0.175, p = 0.023) than others.

CD012347,0,19863365,0,"Family relationship quality is associated with psychological distress, dyspnea, and quality of life in COPD.","Family relationship quality predicts medical outcomes in various health conditions, including stroke, end stage renal disease, and heart failure. Family relationships also influence the onset and course of depression and anxiety disorders. Family may be particularly important in COPD given the high prevalence of depression and anxiety in COPD patients and the association of depression and anxiety with important clinical features of COPD such as dyspnea. The objective of this study was to test three hypotheses in a sample of individuals with COPD: (1) unsupportive family relationships are associated with psychological distress; (2) psychological distress is associated with dyspnea and impairment in health-related quality of life; and (3) unsupportive family relationships are indirectly associated with dyspnea and health-related quality of life via psychological distress. Cross-sectional data were collected via self-report questionnaires completed by 526 individuals with COPD. Structural equation modeling was used to test the hypotheses. All three hypotheses were supported. Unsupportive family relationships were associated with psychological distress, psychological distress was associated with dyspnea and impairment in health-related quality of life, and unsupportive family relationships were indirectly associated with dyspnea and health-related quality of life via psychological distress. If subsequent longitudinal investigations demonstrate that unsupportive family relationships do indeed lead to psychological distress among individuals with COPD, then interventions to improve family relationships of patients with COPD could lead to reductions in psychological distress and, ultimately, to improvements in dyspnea and quality of life."

Clinical trials have revealed the effectiveness of this thymic derivative in the prevention of recurrent respiratory infections (RRI) in children and in adults; 11 patients (8 males and 3 females; age range 18-76 years) with chronic bronchitis dominated by recurrent respiratory infections were studied. They were treated orally for 6 months during the winter season with 120 mg/day of thymomodulin. All the subjects were asked to keep a diary recording the intensity of their symptoms, the number of working days lost (days of illness) and the use of antibiotic and/or mucolytic drugs. At the beginning and at the end of the trial each patient was subjected to a control with a flexible fibreoptic bronchoscope with bronchoalveolar lavage to evaluate the phagocytic response of alveolar macrophages. At the end of therapy a significant improvement of the clinical status, evaluated by the above-mentioned parameters, of the bronchial mucosa aspect and an increase in alveolar macrophage superoxide production was noticed (from 0.1 +/- 0.09 and 0.8 +/- 0.5 nmol to 1.6 +/- 0.8 and 4.1 +/- 2.2 nmol with PMA or zymosan particles respectively; p less than 0.001).

It is a clinical impression that some patients given oral corticosteroids develop a sense of wellbeing that is 'inappropriate' to improvements in physical health. This has been termed steroid 'euphoria', but unlike steroid-induced psychosis it has not been documented. 2. To test for the size and frequency of this phenomenon, 20 patients with severe chronic obstructive airways disease (mean FEV1 0.86 l) were given 30 mg of prednisolone for 14 days, after a period of placebo administration in a single-blind study. 3. Lung spirometry and arterial saturation during exercise were measured serially, together with established measures of mood state. 4. No changes in spirometry or arterial saturation during exercise were detected until 7 days of active therapy. 5. Mood state did not change during the placebo period, but small significant reductions in anxiety and depression were measured after 3 days of prednisolone and before any measurable improvement in lung function. Mood state did not then further improve, despite measurable improvements in lung spirometry. 6. This is evidence that prednisolone may produce a mild 'inappropriate' sense of wellbeing within a population receiving the drug, rather than as an occasional idiosyncratic response."

Protective psychological factors exist which enable people to adapt successfully to disease, but research about these factors in COPD is sparse. The aim of this study was to investigate whether sense of coherence (SOC), resilience and social support are potential protective factors and thus associated with reduced levels of symptoms of anxiety and depression and lower perceived disability in people with COPD. An online study was conducted in which n = 531 participants with COPD completed questionnaires assessing protective psychological factors, anxiety and depressive symptoms (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) and disease-specific disability (COPD Disability Index). Regression analyses were conducted. SOC and resilience contributed significantly to reduced levels of symptoms of anxiety and depression and to lower disease-specific disability after controlling for confounding variables and disease severity. Symptoms of anxiety and depression were most strongly predicted by SOC. This study's results indicated that SOC and resilience could represent helpful individual resources due to their protective potential helping people adjust to COPD. Limitations and implications of this study are discussed."

CD012347,0,17851463,0,Benzodiazepine use and mortality of incident dialysis patients in the United States.,"Benzodiazepines and other omega-receptor agonists are frequently used for sleep and anxiety disorders. We studied the rates, correlates, and safety of individual benzodiazepines and zolpidem use from the records of 3690 patients in a national cohort of Dialysis Morbidity and Mortality Study Wave 2 data. We assessed drug utilization and an association between drug use and all-cause mortality. Overall, 14% of incident dialysis patients used a benzodiazepine or zolpidem. Women, Caucasians, current smokers, and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were more likely to use these drugs, whereas patients with cerebrovascular disease were less likely to use these drugs. In adjusted analyses, benzodiazepine or zolpidem use was associated with a 15% higher mortality rate. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease significantly modified this association, suggesting that these patients were at higher risk. No association was found between benzodiazepine use and greater risk for hip fracture. We conclude that benzodiazepine or zolpidem use is common in incident dialysis patients and may be associated with greater mortality. Further studies are needed to elucidate the safety of these drugs in the dialysis population, which may lead to cautious and restrictive utilization of omega-receptor agonists in dialysis patients."

The authors have examined multiple outcome indicators in patients with disabling chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and comorbid depression. Thirty patients completed a 12-week, randomized controlled trial of nortriptyline. Nortriptyline was clearly superior to placebo for treatment of depression. Nortriptyline treatment was accompanied by marked improvements in anxiety, certain respiratory symptoms, overall physical comfort, and day-to-day function; placebo effects were negligible. Physiological measures reflecting pulmonary insufficiency were generally unaffected by treatment. These data provide impetus for renewed efforts to improve recognition and treatment of mood disorders in even severely disabled medical patients."

CD012347,0,16997737,0,Comparison of oral and depot intra-muscular steroids in assessing steroid-responsiveness in COPD.,"Non-compliance or euphoria may limit the usefulness of prednisolone tablets in assessing steroid-responsiveness in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Depot intra-muscular methyl-prednisolone (imMP), producing a plateau steroid effect over two weeks, may be more reliable. Following two weeks of placebo, twenty-seven COPD patients (mean FEV 1 43% predicted) participated in a two-week randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-design trial taking either 120 mg imMP with placebo tablets or placebo injection with prednisolone 30 mg daily. After each period, post-bronchodilator FEV 1, forced vital capacity (FVC), inspiratory capacity (IC) and six-minute walking distance (6MWD) were assessed and patients completed both quality-of-life scores (St. George's 30 and Short Form 36) and mood scores (Hospital Anxiety and Depression scores and Altman's Self-rating Mania Scale). There were no significant changes in 6MWD, quality of life or mood scores after either type of steroids and no change in lung function after imMP. By contrast, there were small mean improvements in lung function on oral prednisolone (mean FEV 1, FVC and IC increased by 100, 320 and 150 ml, respectively). Only the improvement in FVC was significantly greater after prednisolone compared with imMP. Single depot intra-muscular injections of steroids have no advantage over oral daily prednisolone in testing steroid-responsiveness in COPD patients."

CD012347,0,16517485,0,Assessing family caregiver's mental health using a statistically derived cut-off score for the Zarit Burden Interview.,"Decades of research have confirmed that being a family caregiver is a stressful role. However, the point at which these stressors constitute a real risk for decreased mental health has not been established. The purpose of the present study was to determine a statistically valid cut-off score for the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI) in order to identify family caregivers at risk for depression and in need of further assessment and intervention. The ZBI and the Geriatric Depression Scale or the CES-D were administered to three different populations of family caregivers of older adults: stroke caregivers (n=80), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) caregivers (n=48), and general disability caregivers (n=70). Using three different statistical methods, a ZBI cut-off score was determined. Next, contingency analysis was used to compare depression scale scores and ZBI cut-offs for the three groups of caregivers. Findings suggest that a cut-off score ranging from 24-26 has significant predictive validity for identifying caregivers at risk for depression. A ZBI cut-off of 24 correctly identified 72% of caregivers with probable depression. The validity of ZBI cut-offs scores warrants further confirmation with larger samples. Valid cut-off scores would enable health care providers to assess family caregivers at risk and provide necessary interventions to improve their quality of life in this important role."
CD012347,0,19882497,0,Multivariate models of determinants of health-related quality of life in severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.,"Persons with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and similar levels of forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV(1)), exercise capacity, and dyspnea have a wide range of health-related quality of life (HRQL). We identified the independent determinants of HRQL in persons with COPD. Comprehensive assessments of physiological, psychosocial, and clinical variables from the National Emphysema Treatment Trial were used. HRQL was assessed by the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form Physical Component Summary (PCS) and Mental Component Summary (MCS) scores and the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire total score (SGRQ-TS). In multivariate linear regression models, exercise capacity, dyspnea, age, single-breath diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide percent predicted, and self-report of being disabled were significant determinants of PCS score. Dyspnea, depression, antidepressant use, daytime sleepiness, and education were significant determinants of MCS score. Prior participation in pulmonary rehabilitation, supplemental oxygen use, and oral corticosteroid use were significant determinants of SGRQ-TS. Although FEV(1), 6-minute walk test distance, and dyspnea significantly correlated with HRQL, their effects on HRQL were reduced when other variables were considered. Greater exercise capacity, prior participation in pulmonary rehabilitation, and use of supplemental oxygen were significantly associated with better HRQL. Self-perception of being disabled, (Abstract continued) depression, dyspnea, oral corticosteroid use, and daytime sleepiness were associated with worse HRQL. To optimize HRQL, clinicians should pay attention to a number of clinical and physiological factors."

CD012347,0,24949026,0,The correlation of anxiety and depression with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome.,"Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is a common sleep disorder characterized by repeated upper airway obstruction during sleep. While respiratory pauses followed by loud snoring and daytime sleepiness are the main symptoms of OSAS, the patients may complain from sleep disruption, headache, mood disturbance, irritability, and memory impairment. However, the association of sleep apnea with anxiety and depression is not completely understood. Adherence to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), the treatment of choice for OSAS, may be influenced by psychological conditions, especially claustrophobia. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association of OSAS with anxiety and depression symptoms. This study also investigated the association of anxiety with body mass index (BMI) and the severity of OSAS."
CD012347,0,12814144,0,Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in elderly subjects: impact on functional status and quality of life.,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is an important cause of morbidity and disability. Many studies have investigated factors influencing quality of life (QoL) in middle-aged COPD sufferers, but little attention has been given to elderly COPD. The aim of the present study was to investigate the impact of COPD on QoL and functional status in the elderly. Sixty COPD patients and 58 healthy controls over 65 years old were administered Pulmonary Function Tests, 6 min Walking Test (6MWD) for exercise tolerance, the Barthel Index and Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) for functional status, the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) for mood, and the Saint George Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) for QoL. FEV1 and PaO2 were reduced in COPD patients. Also the distance walked during 6MWD was significantly shorter for patients than controls (282.5 +/- 89.5 vs. 332.9 +/- 95.2 m; P < 0.01). Moreover, COPD patients had significantly worse outcomes for the Barthel Index, GDS and SGRQ. The logistic regression model demonstrated that a decrease in FEV1 is the factor most strictly related to the deterioration of QoL in COPD patients. Mood was also an independent factor influencing QoL. In conclusion, elderly COPD patients show a substantial impairment in QoL depending on the severity of airway obstruction; symptoms related to the disease may be exaggerated by mood deflection."
CD012347,0,10065691,0,Depression of peripheral chemosensitivity by a dopaminergic mechanism in patients with obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome.,"In the present study, respiratory drives to chemical stimuli and peripheral chemosensitivity were evaluated in patients with obstructive sleep apnoea (OSAS). The effects of oral administration of domperidone, a selective dopamine D2-receptor antagonist, were also examined, to study the respiratory effects of endogenous dopamine on peripheral chemoreceptors. Sixteen patients with OSAS and nine normal control subjects were studied. Respiratory responses to hypercapnia and hypoxia were measured using the rebreathing method and isocapnic progressive hypoxia method, respectively. The hypoxic withdrawal test, which measures the decrease in ventilation caused by two breaths of 100% O2 under mild hypercapnic hypoxic conditions (end-tidal oxygen and carbon dioxide tensions approximately 8.0 kPa and 5.3-6.7 kPa, respectively), was used to evaluate peripheral chemosensitivity. In the patients with OSAS, ventilatory responses to hypercapnia and hypoxia were significantly decreased compared with those of control subjects. Hypoxic withdrawal tests showed that peripheral chemosensitivity was significantly lower in patients with OSAS than in normal subjects. Hypercapnic ventilatory response and peripheral chemosensitivity were enhanced by administration of domperidone in the patients with OSAS, although no changes in either of these were observed in the control subjects. The hypoxic ventilatory response and peripheral chemosensitivity in the patients with OSAS were each significantly correlated with severity of hypoxia during sleep. These findings suggest that peripheral chemosensitivity in patients with obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome may be decreased as a result of abnormality in dopaminergic mechanisms and that the reduced chemosensitivity observed in patients with obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome may affect the severity of hypoxia during sleep."
CD012347,0,8896992,0,Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus is associated with a greater prevalence of depression in the elderly. The Osservatorio Geriatrico of Campania Region Group.,"We investigated the association of non-insulin-dependent (Type 2) diabetes mellitus and depression symptoms in a representative community-dwelling elderly population independently of other conditions such as gender, age, status, disability, cognitive impairment and a number of chronic medical conditions such as chronic obstructive lung disease, degenerative joint disease, heart disease, cirrhosis of the liver, cholelithiasis, peptic ulcer and kidney stones. A total of 1339 elderly subjects living in southern Italy were randomly selected from electoral rolls and evaluated. All subjects were tested by the Geriatric Depression Scale to detect depression, the Mini-Mental State Examination to study cognitive function and the Activity Daily Living Index to evaluate disability. Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus affected 14.7% of our sample. Depression was more prevalent in women over 75 years of age than in younger women (15.9 vs 8.1%, p < 0.001). In multiple linear regression analysis, diabetes mellitus was found to be significantly associated with depression independently of age, gender, loneliness, cognitive impairment, chronic obstructive lung disease, degenerative joint disease, heart diseases, cancer, kidney disease, cirrhosis of the liver and cholelithiasis. It is concluded that non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus is significantly associated with depression in the elderly, which may have clinical implications for the achievement of sufficient blood glucose control."

CD012347,0,9727787,0,Emotional status does not alter exercise tolerance in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.,"Exercise tolerance in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients has been shown to be related to airway limitation and dyspnoea, but little is known about the effects of an emotional status on physical performance. We examined 49 COPD patients with a wide spectrum of airway limitation severity and hypoxaemia. Exercise tolerance was evaluated using the Six-minute Walking Distance Test (6MWD), dyspnoea at rest and on exercise was measured using the visual analogue scale, and the emotional status was evaluated using the battery of psychological tests. The average 6MWD (mean+/-SD) was 355+/-112 m. In the majority of patients a fall in arterial blood oxygen saturation (Sa,O2) on exercise of >3% was found. The mean dyspnoea score of 21+/-19 at rest increased to 66+/-19 on exercise. All subjects demonstrated an increased level of anxiety. The majority also demonstrated elevated emotional tension, and half of the study group showed signs of depression. Step-wise multiple regression analysis with results of 6MWD as dependent and other studied variables as independent variables showed that exercise tolerance depended mainly on airway limitation. The forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) explained 24% of the variance. The forced vital capacity added a further 10%, and arterial blood carbon dioxide tension contributed 7%. The dyspnoea level on exercise added only 0.9%. All four variables explained 42% of the variance. There was no correlation between 6MWD and any of the variables characterizing the emotional status. We conclude that the emotional status of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients is characterized by an increased level of psychological tension, anxiety and depression, but these do not affect exercise tolerance as assessed by the six-minute walking distance test."
CD012347,0,10118375,0,A time-series perspective on effectiveness of a health teaching program on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.,"The purpose of this research was to study the long-term effects of attendance at ""Help Yourself to Better Breathing"" classes on knowledge attainment, coping strategies, and anxiety, depression, and hostility in individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Data were gathered immediately and six months following completion of the program. The results were then compared to those obtained before program attendance. The data showed a significant difference between the pretest, immediate post-test, and the six-month knowledge scores. Coping scores remained the same, which may indicate that not enough emphasis is placed on the development of these skills. There was a significant lowering of the depression scores at the six-month post-testing, and anxiety and hostility scores were lower, but not significantly so. In addition, some participants after the classes were completed chose to enroll in the Better Breathers Program support group and in a pulmonary rehabilitation program. Overall, this study indicates that beneficial effects are evidenced six months following attendance at ""Help Yourself to Better Breathing"" classes."
CD012347,0,9792561,0,Perception of fatigue and quality of life in patients with COPD.,"Although dyspnea is considered the primary activity-limiting symptom in patients with COPD, other symptoms, such as fatigue, are frequently reported.

CD012347,0,1306634,0,[Quality of life and psychologic features of subjects with chronic respiratory diseases].,"The aim of this study is to verify the psychological attitude and the quality of life in patients suffering from chronic respiratory insufficiency. Taking for granted that a bad quality of life is connected with the symptom of a depressed state (loss of appetite, quality of sleep, sexuality, psychomotor slowing down, loss of energy, weariness, reduced interest for the external world, feelings of self-devaluation, reduced working and concentration capacity, complainings of turning over type) we have taken as index of ""normal quality of life"" the lack of these attitudes correlating them to the clinical symptoms and/or the patient's functional troubles and verifying how much they can affect the psychological features and how much the deterioration of the quality of life. For this reason a questionnaire, taken from the MMPI test (Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory), restricted to the items related to the D scale (depression scale), has been given to one hundred COPD patients who had been examined previously from a clinical functional point of view. In the end, we have drawn our results both on the ground of the answers given by the patients to the single questions and on the grounds of the total score D (= depression index) and relating the previous data with the clinical-functional ones. Finally we have compareted these data with those ones connected with non selected population. So we have succeeded in outlining a psychophysical profile of the patient suffering from chronic respiratory diseases. Such a profile is marked by an objective element, that is pathology, and by a psychological element inserted into the organic one as there is an inter-dependence between pathology and psychological features. From the collected data, we have noted the behavioural spheres which are more upset are working capacities, sleep and mood and these features are directly proportional to the seriousness of the pathology. From a practical and therapeutic point of view, all this can be of great importance."
CD012347,0,12212960,0,Ambulatory oxygen improves quality of life of COPD patients: a randomised controlled study.,"It is unknown whether acute response to ambulatory oxygen (O2) predicts longer term improvement in health-related quality of life (HRQL) in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients. The aims of this study were 1) to assess the short-term clinical impact, as determined by HRQL, of ambulatory O2 in a 12-week, double-blind, randomised crossover study of O2 (versus cylinder compressed air) of dyspnoeic but not chronically hypoxic COPD patients with exertional desaturation < or = 88% (n=41), and 2) to determine whether either baseline characteristics or acute response to O2 predicts short-term (12 weeks) response. Primary outcome measures were Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire (CRQ), Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale and the short form (SF)-36. Improvements were seen in all domains of the CRQ for cylinder O2 compared with cylinder air. Significant improvements were also noted in anxiety and depression and in certain domains of the SF-36. There were 28 (68%) acute responders to cylinder O2 (defined as increase in 6-min walk > or = 54 m or decrease in post-Borg dyspnoea > or = 1) and 23 (56%) short-term responders (defined as clinically significant improvement in CRQ). However, acute and short-term responses were not correlated with no predictors of short-term response identified. At study completion, 14 (41%) of acute or short-term responders did not want to continue therapy, with 11 citing poor acceptability or tolerability. Short-term ambulatory oxygen is associated with significant improvements in health-related quality of life. These benefits cannot be predicted by baseline characteristics or acute response. Despite acute or short-term response, a substantial proportion of patients declined ambulatory oxygen."
CD012347,0,26884790,0,Severity of Anxiety Disorders in Patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease.,"Patients with chronic physical diseases sometimes show increased loss of function; such patients need more care. Anxiety is a well-known symptom that is prevalent among chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients that can prolong and increase the risk of hospitalization. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the severity of anxiety in the mentioned patients and to examine the presence of symptoms and appropriate treatment strategies to understand the role of psychological functions in physical patients. Methods : This was a cross sectional study conducted in Masih Daneshvari Hospital. One hundred forty- three patients entered into the project by accessible method and signed the informed consent; they filled demographic information and Hamilton anxiety and depression questionnaires. Data were analyzed by SPSS-16. Results : Of the participants, 68% were above 60 years of age; 78% were male; 89% were married; and 38% were self-employed. Also, among the participants, 51% were illiterate; 72% had history of smoking; 46% had history of substance abuse; and 49% had moderate to severe anxiety disorder. Moreover, of the patients with severe anxiety, 41.3% had severe muscle spasms; and severe sleeplessness was found in 38.5% of those with severe anxiety disorder. Severe anxiety related symptoms were found in 20.3% of the patients with severe anxiety disorder. Depressed mood was found in 27.3% of the patients with severe anxiety disorder. Severe physical and muscular signs were found in 35.7% of those with severe anxiety disorder. Conclusion : According to our findings, many chronic diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease may contain anxiety and depression which result in vulnerability. Therefore, evaluation of anxiety in such patients is of importance for alleviating the disease."

Music therapy group treatment including music visualization, wind playing and singing was provided weekly. This was compared with standard care treatment. Adults ages 48 to 88 (mean 70.1) with moderate to severe GOLD stage II-IV lung disease as well as other diseases processes that lead to chronic airflow limitations were included (n = 98). Participants in both conditions were followed from baseline enrollment to six weeks post control/treatment. Outcome measures included the Beck Depression Inventory Scale 2nd edition-Fast Screen (BDI-FS), Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire Self-Reported (CRQ-SR), and Dyspnea Visual Analog Scale (VAS). Results showed improvement in symptoms of depression (LS mean -0.2) in the music therapy group with statistical divergence between groups (p = 0.007). The CRQ-SR demonstrated improvement in dyspnea (p = 0.01 LS mean 0.5) and mastery (p = 0.06 LS mean 0.5) in the music therapy group and fatigue (p = 0.01 LS mean 0.3).

CD012347,0,3925477,0,Effect of desipramine on control of ventilation and depression scores in patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.,"Decreased ventilatory responses to carbon dioxide (CO2) correlate with elevated scores on tests for depression in normal subjects and with episodes of endogenous depression in psychiatric patients. Patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) frequently develop resting hypercapnia due to impaired ventilatory mechanics or drive, and may also have elevated scores on tests for depression. Tricyclic antidepressant drugs can improve ventilatory mechanics and possibly drive. We hypothesized that antidepressant drugs might enhance ventilatory drive and improve arterial blood gases in patients with severe COPD and that these improvements might correlate with improvement in depression scores. Therefore, we studied the effects of desipramine versus placebo on spirometry, resting arterial blood gases, hypercapnic ventilatory and mouth occlusion pressure responses, and scores on the Beck and Zung self-rated depression scales. In our patients the resting arterial CO2 (PaCO2) was found to depend almost equally on ventilatory mechanics and drive. In addition, patients with higher depression scores tended to have a lower PaCO2 when the severity of airways obstruction was taken into consideration. In a 16-week, double-blind, crossover comparison of desipramine with placebo, both treatments led to significant improvement in depression scores. Desipramine had no effects on resting PaCO2, spirometry, or ventilatory control."

CD012347,0,12109934,0,Use of sustained-release bupropion in specific patient populations for smoking cessation.,"Smoking cessation trials of sustained-release bupropion (bupropion SR) were initially conducted in a general population of smokers who were motivated to quit smoking. Bupropion SR has also been found to be a useful treatment of tobacco dependence in various special populations of smokers who often experience difficulty in overcoming tobacco addiction. Point-prevalence quit rates at 6 months were higher in those treated with bupropion SR than in those receiving placebo in studies on smokers with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (23% vs 16%) and in those with cardiovascular disease (34% vs 12%). Abstinence from smoking after treatment with bupropion SR was not affected by a history of major depression or alcoholism. Women treated with bupropion SR were just as likely as men to abstain from smoking. Approximately one-third of a study population who were initially unwilling or unable to quit smoking were able to reduce their smoking by 50% or more during therapy with bupropion SR; 14% of these went on to achieve abstinence. Bupropion SR was well tolerated in these trials; importantly, it had no clinically significant effect on mean blood pressure in smokers, including those with hypertension, and attenuated the weight gain associated with smoking cessation, particularly in women."

CD012347,0,23537344,0,Impact of pulmonary rehabilitation on the major dimensions of dyspnea in COPD.,"The evaluation of dyspnea and its responsiveness to therapy in COPD should consider the multidimensional nature of this symptom in each of its sensory-perceptual (intensity, quality), affective and impact domains. To gain new insights into mechanisms of dyspnea relief following pulmonary rehabilitation (PR), we examined effects on the major domains of dyspnea and their interaction with physiological training effects. This randomized, controlled study was conducted in 48 subjects with COPD. Subjects received either 8-weeks of PR or usual care (CTRL). Pre- and post-intervention assessments included: sensory-perceptual (i.e., exertional dyspnea intensity, dyspnea descriptors at end-exercise), affective (i.e., intensity of breathing-related anxiety during exercise, COPD self-efficacy, walking self-efficacy) and impact (i.e., activity-related dyspnea measured by the Baseline/Transition Dyspnea Index, Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire dyspnea component, St. George's Respiratory Disease Questionnaire activity component) domains of dyspnea; functional performance (i.e., 6-minute walk, endurance shuttle walk); pulmonary function; and physiological measurements during constant work rate cycle exercise at 75% of the peak incremental work rate. Forty-one subjects completed the study: PR (n = 17) and CTRL (n = 24) groups were well matched for age, sex, body size and pulmonary function. There were no significant between-group differences in pre- to post-intervention changes in pulmonary function or physiological parameters during exercise. After PR versus CTRL, significant improvements were found in the affective and impact domains but not in the sensory-perceptual domain of dyspnea. In conclusion, clinically meaningful improvements in the affective and impact domains of dyspnea occurred in response to PR in the absence of consistent physiological training effects."
CD012347,0,17209145,0,A practical screening tool for anxiety and depression in patients with chronic breathing disorders.,"Obstructive lung diseases are associated with high rates of depression and anxiety, yet many patients are never screened or treated. This study evaluated the five-question Depression and Anxiety modules of the Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders (PRIME-MD) Patient Questionnaire as a telephone screen in 1,632 patients with chronic breathing disorders at a Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Houston, TX. Subsequent testing of 828 patients with the Beck Depression Inventory-II and the Beck Anxiety Inventory showed that the sensitivity and specificity, respectively, of the Depression and Anxiety modules of the PRIME-MD Patient Questionnaire screening were 94.6% and 49.5% (Depression); 93.7% and 32.2% (Anxiety); and 97.7%, and 36.0% (combined screen), with an overall accuracy of 80.7%. In such populations, these two modules of the PRIME-MD Patient Questionnaire may be a useful screening tool."

CD012347,0,23367674,0,Roflumilast: doubtful efficacy but clear harms in COPD.,"Avoidance of irritants such as tobacco smoke slows the progression of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Drugs have only a modest, purely symptomatic effect; a bronchodilator is combined with an inhaled corticosteroid when exacerbations are frequent. Oxygen therapy prolongs survival in very severe disease. Roflumilast, a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug that inhibits type 4 phosphodiesterase, has been authorised in the European Union for the treatment of severe COPD. Roflumilast has not been compared with an inhaled corticosteroid. Its evaluation is primarily based on 8 double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trials lasting from 24 to 52 weeks, in a total of approximately 9000 patients. In four trials, the average frequency of exacerbations fell by about 0.2 episodes per patient per year, but the statistical significance of the difference was variable. Even in the most favourable trials, roflumilast did not reduce the frequency of hospitalisation for exacerbations. In six trials (including the four previous trials), roflumilast led to a statistically significant increase in forced expiratory volume in one second, by about 50 ml on average, but the clinical relevance of this improvement is questionable. An inherently unreliable indirect comparison suggests that roflumilast is less effective than an inhaled corticosteroid. Treatment was stopped because of adverse reactions in 14% of patients taking roflumilast, versus 8.5% in the placebo groups. The most common adverse effects were gastrointestinal disorders (diarrhoea, nausea), weight loss, and neuropsychiatric disorders (insomnia, anxiety, depression). Concerns have been raised about the carcinogenic potential of roflumilast. Roflumilast is metabolised by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes CYP 3A4 and CYP 1A2, creating a high potential for pharmacokinetic interactions. In practice, it is better not to use roflumilast. For patients with severe COPD and repeated exacerbations, the standard treatment remains an inhaled bronchodilator combined with an inhaled corticosteroid, or oxygen therapy in some cases."

Patients were stratified according to the Medical Research Council (MRC) dyspnoea score. A total of 74 stable COPD patients (mean+/-sd age 68+/-10 yrs), 21 MRC dyspnoea score grade 1/2, 29 grade 3/4 and 24 grade 5, with a mean forced expiratory volume in one second of 1.1+/-0.6 L, attended for rehabilitation. Assessments consisted of the following: quadriceps torque, 6-minute walking distance (6MWD), Brief Assessment Depression Cards and St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). Predictors of drop-out and of response (a change in SGRQ of four points or 6MWD of 54 m) were tested using binary logistic regression. In total, 51 patients completed the study. Of these, 39 (77%) showed a clinically significant benefit in either 6MWD or SGRQ. Baseline variables were poor predictors of response in each case. Significant differences were seen between MRC dyspnoea score groups for change in 6MWD and SGRQ Score. Only grade 1/2 and 3/4 patients improved. Depression was a risk factor for subject drop-out compared with nondepressed patients. Baseline state is a poor predictor of response to rehabilitation, although Medical Research Council dyspnoea score grade 5 patients showed smaller magnitudes of improvement than patients with less severe Medical Research Council dyspnoea score grades. Risk of drop-out is significantly greater in depressed compared with nondepressed patients."

CD012347,0,7770581,0,Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and symptoms related to depression in elderly persons.,"In a community study, 61 men and 21 women with mild to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were compared with age- and sex-matched controls (183 men and 63 women) to identify and analyze the associations between the occurrence of COPD and depressive symptoms, the occurrence of previous or current psychiatric disorders, the use of psychiatric drugs, and satisfaction with one's marital relationship. In men, no associations between COPD and the above factors were found. More women with COPD than controls reported feelings of dissatisfaction with life. The female patients also tended to be less satisfied with their marital relationship than the controls. Multivariate analysis showed that this disease in women was associated with disability (odds ratio 3.25, 95% confidence interval 1.17-9.06), feelings of dissatisfaction with life (odds ratio 3.56, 95% confidence interval 1.23-10.34), and low satisfaction with one's marital relationship (odds ratio 3.23, 95% confidence interval 1.10-9.47). These results seem to suggest that elderly female patients with COPD have more mental health problems than male patients and these will require more attention from the primary care providers."

CD012347,0,20936544,0,Relationship between anxiety and dyspnea on exertion in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.,"Dyspnea limits exercise in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and is known to induce anxiety. Little is known whether anxiety contributes to exercise-induced dyspnea, which in turn might influence the outcome of diagnostic tests. The aim of the present study was to examine the relationship between general anxiety and dyspnea on exertion in patients with COPD. Ninety patients with stable COPD participated; 44 men, mean age 61 (standard deviation (SD) 10.4), and mean forced expiratory volume in 1 second (%pred.) 40.5 (SD 16.9). All participants performed pulmonary function tests and an incremental cycle ergometry. The Modified Borg Scale was used to measure the level of dyspnea on exertion. Anxiety symptoms were assessed with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Data were analyzed using Spearman's correlations and multivariate regression. Dyspnea on exertion was correlated with general anxiety (r=.31), age (r=-.30), and exercise capacity (r=.27). Regression analysis showed that general anxiety was associated with dyspnea on exertion, adjusted for sex, age, baseline dyspnea, and exercise capacity. Consequently, it is reasoned that results of exercise training and activities in daily living may be influenced negatively by anxiety-worsened dyspnea. Attention should be given to anxiety management in patients with COPD to optimize exercise training."

There are few research data to guide clinicians on best practice. The shuttle walking test has been validated for some conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease but not for advanced cancer.

COPD patients (n = 56) completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). These scores were compared to confirmed clinical diagnoses of depression and anxiety using the Mini Neuropsychiatric Interview. HADS depression subscale (HADS-D) sensitivity/specificity was 78/81%; BDI-II 89/77%; HADS anxiety subscale (HADS-A) 71/81%; and BAI 89/62%. HADS-D sensitivity/specificity was improved (100/83%) with the removal of Q4 'I feel as if I am slowed down' and adjusted cut-off (≥5). Removal of BDI-II Q21 'Loss of interest in sex' with adjusted cut-off ≥12 resulted in similar improvement (100/79%). No problematic items were identified for HADS-A or BAI. Previously reported low sensitivity/specificity of the HADS for COPD patients was not replicated. Furthermore, simple modifications of the HADS-D markedly improved sensitivity/specificity for depression.BDI-II, HADS-A and BAI produced acceptable sensitivity/specificity unmodified.

However, there is little data available on the perceptions and experiences of general practitioners (GPs) on the management of depression in patients with COPD. The study investigated GPs' views about recognizing and treating depression in patients with COPD. A postal survey of 3957 GPs in England about their views on recognizing and treating depression in patients with COPD was conducted. Participants were drawn from the General Medical Services statistics database maintained by the Department of Health. A total of 3957 GPs were mailed. Of these, 857 (22%) complete responses were received. Seventy two percent of the GPs reported screening for depression regularly in patients with COPD. Over 95% of the GPs' views were that depression interferes with the self-management of COPD and 584 (67%) thought that it exacerbates the symptoms of COPD. However, over two-fifths of GPs were concerned that convincing COPD patients with comorbid depression to receive appropriate treatment was a challenge. Barriers for treatment of comorbid depression in patients with COPD include lack of adequate provision of psychological services and long waiting times for psychological treatment. It is encouraging that most GPs were vigilant and proactively screening for depression. However, there is limited immediate access and provision to psychological therapies to refer COPD patients for treatment in the primary care setting. Further study is required."

CD012347,0,1907536,0,Prediction of maximum exercise tolerance in patients with COPD.,"Exercise tolerance in patients with COPD is difficult to predict from measurements of lung function. We examined multiple physiologic and psychosocial variables in an attempt to predict exercise performance in a group of patients with COPD enrolled in a clinical trial of pulmonary rehabilitation. A total of 119 patients (FEV1 = 1.41 +/- 0.64 L) were divided randomly into either a study group (group A, n = 58) or validation group (group B, n = 61). Stepwise multiple regression in group A revealed that peak oxygen uptake (peak VO2) was predicted best by the following equation: Peak VO2 (L/min) = (0.0327 x DCO) + (0.0040 x MVV)-(0.0156 x peak-exercise VD/VT) + (0.0259 x resting VE) + 0.848; r = 0.90; SE = 0.233 L/min. This equation was then cross-validated in group B. It demonstrated excellent validity: measured peak VO2 (L/min) = (1.13 x predicted peak VO2)-0.0891; r = 0.90; SE = 0.239 L/min. We conclude that exercise tolerance was predicted reasonably well from measurements of lung function and gas exchange in this group of patients with COPD. However, the variability of the prediction would limit its usefulness in individual patients."

CD012347,0,10606112,0,Sense of exhaustion and coronary heart disease among college alumni.,"Vital exhaustion, defined as a combination of fatigue, lack of energy, feelings of hopelessness, loss of libido, and increased irritability, has been proposed as a risk indicator for the development of coronary heart disease (CHD). It is unclear if the association between vital exhaustion and CHD is independent of sleep behavior, depression, and physical activity. We ascertained sense of exhaustion among 5,053 male college alumni who were free of cardiovascular disease, cancer, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease by asking, ""How often do you experience sense of exhaustion (except after exercise)?"" on a health survey in 1980. Eight hundred fifteen men died during 12 years of follow-up, 25% due to CHD. After adjustment for age, body mass index, smoking status, and history of physician-diagnosed diabetes and hypertension, frequent sense of exhaustion was associated with a twofold increase in CHD mortality (rate ratio 2.07; 95% confidence interval 1.08 to 3.96). After additional adjustment for insomnia, sleep duration, use of sleeping pills and tranquilizers, physical activity, history of physician-diagnosed depression, and alcohol intake, the rate ratio was not appreciably altered; however, the association now was of borderline significance (rate ratio 2.06; 95% confidence interval: 0.98 to 4.36) because there were only 10 deaths from CHD among men who were frequently exhausted. In a prospective observational study, frequent sense of exhaustion appeared to be independently associated with increased risk of CHD mortality in men."

CD012347,0,6711437,0,Noninvasive diagnosis of pulmonary arterial hypertension in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: right ventricular ejection fraction at rest.,"Because right ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF) depends on impedance to RV ejection, the hypothesis was tested that an abnormality in radionuclide-determined RVEF would be a useful noninvasive predictor of pulmonary artery (PA) hypertension in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Simultaneous measurements of resting RVEF and PA pressure were made in 30 patients with COPD. All were stable and without clinical evidence of respiratory decompensation or congestive heart failure. Eleven patients had normal (less than 20 mm Hg) mean PA pressure and 19 patients had PA hypertension. The average RVEF was 41 +/- 7% (range 29 to 60%). Five patients had normal (greater than 45%) and 25 patients depressed RVEF. An inverse linear relation between mean PA pressure and RVEF was present (r = -0.74). In the group with normal PA pressure, RVEF averaged 48% (range 42 to 60%). In the group with PA hypertension, RVEF averaged 36% (range 29 to 44%). RVEF was significantly higher in the group with PA hypertension. Using RVEF less than 45% as an indicator of PA hypertension, the sensitivity was 100%, the specificity 55%, and the predictive accuracy of a positive result 79%. Using RVEF less than or equal to 40% as an indicator of PA hypertension, the sensitivity was 75%, the specificity 100%, and the predictive accuracy of a positive study 100%. Thus, radionuclide-determined RVEF using the first-pass technique and a multicrystal camera is a useful noninvasive test for diagnosing PA hypertension in patients with advanced COPD."
CD012347,0,20688892,0,Symptoms of anxiety and depression in COPD patients entering pulmonary rehabilitation.,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients may suffer from symptoms of anxiety and depression. Whether and to what extent symptoms of anxiety and depression may be present in COPD patients entering pulmonary rehabilitation and which patient characteristics are associated with psychological distress remains currently unknown. The objective of the present study is to determine the prevalence and the determinants of clinically relevant symptoms of anxiety and depression in COPD patients entering pulmonary rehabilitation. Symptoms of anxiety and depression have been assessed in 701 COPD patients entering pulmonary rehabilitation using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Additionally, disease-specific health status, pulmonary function, body composition, exercise capacity, co-existing morbidities, smoking status, symptoms, long-term oxygen therapy and the use of antidepressant and anxiolytic drugs have been recorded. Patients had mean anxiety scores of 7.6 points and mean depression scores of 7.2 points. Anxiety scores >or=10 points were present in 225 patients (32%) and depression scores >or=10 points were present in 192 patients (27%). Patients at risk of having symptoms of anxiety were female or used antidepressant or anxiolytic drugs. Patients at risk of having symptoms of depression experienced dyspnea, had a body mass index (BMI) <21 kg/m(2) or used antidepressant or anxiolytic drugs. A considerable proportion of the COPD patients entering pulmonary rehabilitation report symptoms of anxiety and/or depression, which may significantly impair disease-specific health status. Patients at risk of having symptoms of anxiety and/or depression are female, experience dyspnea, have a low BMI or use antidepressant and/or anxiolytic drugs."

Seventy African-Americans over the age of 65 years completed a comprehensive sleep questionnaire, the Quality of Well-Being Scale (QWB), and the Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) Core Measures of HRQOL (116-item Long Version) and had sleep recorded. Those with moderate-severe sleep apnea had significantly lower Physical Component summary scores than those with no sleep apnea (p < 0.05). After controlling for medical conditions, sleep apnea was significantly related to both general physical functioning and general mental health functioning in those with mild apnea (apnea-hypopnea index [AHI] < 15), but not in those with moderate to severe apnea. There was an initial decrease in HRQOL up to an AHI level of 15, at which point HRQOL remained at a lowered level. The QWB scores of our sleep apnea sample were similar to the QWB scores found in patients with depression and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), suggesting that sleep disturbances may impact daily living and health as much as other medical conditions."

We tested the hypothesis that cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) decreases ratings of perceived dyspnoea in response to resistive loading in patients with COPD. From 31 patients with COPD, 18 were randomised to four sessions of specifically targeted CBT and 13 to routine care. Prior to randomisation, participants were tested with an inspiratory external resistive load protocol (loads between 5 and 45cmH2O/L/s). Six months later, we re-measured perceived dyspnoea in response to the same inspiratory resistive loads and compared results to measurements prior to randomisation. There was a significant 17% reduction in dyspnoea ratings across the loads for the CBT group, and no reduction for the routine care group. The decrease in ratings of dyspnoea suggests that CBT to alleviate breathing discomfort may have a role in the routine treatment of people with COPD."

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common, frequently devastating disease that often includes daytime sleepiness and fatigue. Fatigue is also a hallmark depressive symptom. We previously reported that depressive symptoms explained ten times the variance in fatigue in OSA patients as did OSA severity itself (respiratory disturbance index, oxyhemoglobin saturation).

The objective of this study is to determine if treatment with positive airway pressure (PAP) improves symptoms of depression and anxiety. A systematic review was conducted to identify clinical trials of PAP that contained a validated measure of depression severity. Meta-analysis was conducted for depression, anxiety, excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), quality of life (QoL) and respiratory variables. The systematic review included 33 reports. Pre-post-test analysis of PAP showed a moderate effect size (Hedge's g, 95% CI) for depression 0.524 [0.401-0.647], but a low effect size compared to oral placebo (0.355 [0.187-0.524]) and no effect when compared to dental appliances (0.107 [-0.72-0.287]) and sham PAP (-0.049 [-0.292-0.194]). Anxiety, EDS, and QoL showed similar improvement in pre-post-test analysis, but a lack of superiority to dental appliances and sham PAP. PAP was superior to all comparators for respiratory variables. PAP has a moderate clinical effect on symptoms of depression and anxiety in OSA, but it is not superior to dental appliances or sham PAP. The improvement in subjective symptoms, such as depression and anxiety, may be mediated by patient expectations and contact with healthcare providers."

A convenience sample of 104 outpatients with COPD participated in the study. The independent variables were causal attributions, depressed mood, self-esteem, pulmonary function, and exercise capacity, and the dependent variable was functional status. There was a significant difference in functional status between those who did and those who did not ask the question, ""Why me?"" (p = .03). In addition, the remaining psychological variables and both physiological variables were significantly correlated with functional status (p less than or equal to .01). To identify the combination of study variables most predictive of functional status a multiple regression analysis was performed.

COPD sufferers are 85% more likely to develop anxiety disorders than healthy matched controls. Some of the factors that have been suggested to be associated with high anxiety in people with COPD include dyspnoea, the inability to perform daily activities or fulfil social roles, rehospitalisation and some COPD treatments. There is substantial evidence that cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) is effective in managing mood disorders, but there is also some evidence that befriending can assist people. Befriending is an intervention that focuses on everyday conversation topics and can be delivered by volunteers with training and supervision. The case presented here illustrates the use of befriending provided over the phone for a participant with severe anxiety and depression. It was part of a larger RCT comparing CBT and befriending for the management of anxiety and depression in people with COPD. Symptoms were alleviated after a course of 8 weeks of befriending telephone calls from a volunteer.

CD012347,0,12406844,0,Model-based assessment of autonomic control in obstructive sleep apnea syndrome during sleep.,"Respiration, R-R interval, blood pressure, and other polysomnographic variables were recorded in eight normal subjects and nine patients with untreated obstructive sleep apnea syndrome in wakefulness and sleep. To increase respiratory and cardiovascular variability, a computer-controlled ventilator delivered randomly modulated inspiratory pressures that were superimposed on a baseline continuous positive airway pressure. A mathematical model allowed heart rate variability to be partitioned into a component mediated by respiratory-cardiac coupling and one mediated by the baroreflexes. Respiratory-cardiac coupling gain was lower in patients versus normal subjects (36.9 +/- 3.3 versus 66.1 +/- 5.6 milliseconds L-1, p < 0.03). Baroreflex gain in patients was also depressed relative to normal subjects (2.3 +/- 0.4 versus 4.9 +/- 0.7 milliseconds mm Hg-1; p < 0.02). Baroreflex gain increased two- to threefold from wakefulness to sleep in normal subjects, but was relatively unaffected by state change in patients. Along with results derived from spectral analysis of cardiovascular variability, these findings confirm previous reports that obstructive sleep apnea syndrome is associated with reduced parasympathetic and elevated sympathetic activity.

CD012347,0,10921765,0,Development and validation of a standardized measure of activity of daily living in patients with severe COPD: the London Chest Activity of Daily Living scale (LCADL).,"Activities of daily living (ADL) may be severely restricted in patients with COPD and assessment requires evaluation of the impact of disability and handicap on daily life. This study is concerned with the development and validation of a standardized 15-item questionnaire to assess routine ADL. Sixty (33 male, 27 female) patients with severe COPD, mean (SD) FEV1 0.91 (0.43) l, median (range) age 70 (50-82) years, completed a 59-item ADL list previously generated by open-ended interview and by literature review. Patients also performed the Shuttle Walk Test (SWT), and completed the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), the Nottingham Extended Activity of Daily Living Questionnaire (EADL) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression score (HAD). Criteria for item reduction in the development of The London Chest ADL scale (LCADL) consisted of removal of items where the majority of respondents showed no limitation in the activity (n = 19), where there was no association with perception of global health (n = 9), where an association with age or gender was detected (n = 4), or where items showed poor reliability on test re-test (n = 9). Fifteen items were identified as core activities of daily living. The LCADL was then compared with other measures of health status in these patients. There were good correlations with the SGRQ activity and impact components (p=0.70; P<0.0001) and (p=0.58; P<0.0001), respectively, and EADL (p=0.45; P<0.001), and a moderate correlation with HAD anxiety (p=0.28; P<0.03). There was a significant relationship between the SWT and LCADL (p=0.58; P<0.0001), suggesting a relationship between impaired exercise performance and lower ADL scores. There was evidence of high internal consistency of the questionnaire with Chronbach's alpha of 0.98. These findings suggest that the LCADL scale is a valid tool for the assessment of ADL in patients with severe COPD."
CD012347,0,2323489,0,Self-reported illnesses in family members of alcoholics.,"This study explores the association between familial alcoholism and the presence of certain conditions in nonalcoholic family members. Depression, obesity, functional bowel syndrome, asthma/emphysema, trauma, and genitourinary problems are conditions suggested by prior studies to be more common in families of alcoholics than in those without an alcoholic family member. Cross-sectional data were collected from a convenience sample of adults in the waiting room of a midwestern, university based family practice clinic. The respondents were classified in two groups: those with little likelihood of familial alcoholism and those with probable familial alcoholism. The groups were matched for race and age, creating two demographically similar groups which were then analyzed as cohorts. The prevalence rates of the conditions of interest in the respondents were calculated in the two groups and compared using the chi-square test for statistical significance. Significant differences in prevalence rates of depression and obesity were found. Trends were found for differing rates of functional bowel syndrome and asthma/emphysema. No differences were found for trauma and genitourinary problems. If differences in disease prevalence truly exist between family members of alcoholic and nonalcoholic individuals, this awareness could enhance the diagnosis and treatment of the conditions of interest in the nonalcoholic relative as well as the alcoholic individual. Family members could be a powerful screening tool for alcoholism."
CD012347,0,25876002,0,Effects of nasal continuous positive airway pressure therapy on partners' sexual lives.,"To assess sexual functioning in male and female partners before and after nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy in men with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Twenty-one male patients with moderate to severe OSA and erectile dysfunction, and their female partner, were recruited into this prospective study. Males diagnosed with OSA were treated with nasal CPAP therapy for 12 weeks. Women were assessed for sexual functioning using the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI), and for mood status using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), before and after their male partner underwent nasal CPAP therapy. Sexual functioning was assessed in men using the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF), before and after nasal CPAP therapy. After nasal CPAP therapy for OSA in men, IIEF scores were significantly higher than pre-treatment scores. Total pre- and post-treatment IIEF scores (mean ± standard deviation) were 50.28 ± 15.88 and 65.42 ± 7.47, respectively, P < 0.01. Pre- and post-treatment FSFI scores in women were 21.54 ± 6.62 and 29.94 ± 3.76, respectively, P < 0.01. Pre- and post-treatment BDI scores in women were 14.61 ± 9.69 and 12.42 ± 8.92, respectively, P < 0.01. Following treatment of men with OSA, our data indicate benefits for nasal CPAP therapy on sexual functioning in both the male and female partners. Moreover, our findings indicate that improved sexual function in women after their male partner underwent nasal CPAP also had psychological benefits."

Unlike other occasions, the wildfires in this case also threatened farms, houses and even human lives, with the result that the perception of disaster and helplessness was the most acute experienced in recent years. This study sought to analyse the respiratory and mental health effects of the August-2006 fires, using consumption of anxiolytics-hypnotics and drugs for obstructive airway diseases as indicators."
CD012347,0,8766189,0,Quality of life of patients under home mechanical ventilation for restrictive lung diseases: a comparative evaluation with COPD patients.,"The aim of this study was to compare the quality of life of patients under home mechanical ventilation (HMV) for restrictive lung disease, with the quality of life of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), having similar decrease in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), but not receiving HMV. Sixteen patients who were receiving intermittent HMV (six post-tuberculosis, four post-poliomyelitis, two neuromuscular diseases, two kyphoscoliosis, two obesity-hypoventilation syndromes) were compared to 15 COPD patients who were receiving only usual conservative treatment, including long-term oxygen therapy. Dyspnoea scores, anxiety, depression, and psychosocial scores, as well as a panel of functional parameters were measured. The two groups did not differ in terms of functional impairment. However, patients under HMV had much better scores for anxiety, depression, and adjustment to illness than COPD patients. Scores for dyspnoea at rest were also better in the HMV group, but showed no relationship to quality of life. In spite of a cumbersome and intrusive type of treatment, patients under home mechanical ventilation for predominantly restrictive lung disease were found to have a better quality of life than chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients under conservative therapy. In the first group, a longer history of coping with a chronic disease and the perception that medical intervention is effective may in part account for this difference."
CD012347,0,11799343,0,Mood changes during prednisone bursts in outpatients with asthma.,"Corticosteroids, such as prednisone and dexamethasone, are frequently prescribed medications sometimes associated with severe systemic side effects. Currently there are limited data regarding the psychiatric side effects of these medications, although mood changes and even psychoses have been reported. This study was designed to quantify psychiatric changes during brief courses of prednisone in patients with asthma. Outpatients with asthma (N = 32) receiving bursts of prednisone (>40 mg/day) were evaluated before, during, and after corticosteroid therapy by use of the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, the Young Mania Scale, the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, and the Internal State Scale. A Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV disorders was also conducted to examine past psychiatric history. Highly significant increases in the Young Mania Scale and Activation subscale of the Internal State Scale (both measures of mania) were observed with no increase in depression measures during the first 3 to 7 days of prednisone therapy. Mood changes were not correlated with improvement in airway obstruction, suggesting that mood elevations may not be in response to improvement in asthma symptoms. Subjects with past or current symptoms of depression had a significant decrease in depressive symptoms during prednisone therapy compared with those without depression. Some patients with posttraumatic stress disorder reported increases in depression and memories of the traumatic event during prednisone therapy. In summary, statistically significant changes in mood were observed even during brief courses of corticosteroids at modest dosages. The symptoms were primarily manic, not depressive. Persons with depression did not become more depressed during prednisone therapy, and, in fact, some showed improvement."

CD012347,0,9158212,0,Postdialysis fatigue.,"To clarify the demographic and clinicolaboratory features of postdialysis fatigue (PDF), we enrolled 85 patients on maintenance hemodialysis in a cross-sectional study using validated questionnaires and chart review. Forty-three patients complained of fatigue after dialysis. On formal testing using the Kidney Disease Questionnaire, the PDF group had statistically greater severity of fatigue and somatic complaints than the group of patients without subjective fatigue (P = 0.03 and 0.04, respectively). On a scale measuring intensity of fatigue (1 = least to 5 = worst), the PDF group average was 3.4 +/- 1.2. PDF subjects reported that 80% +/- 25% of dialysis treatments were followed by fatigue symptoms. In 28 (65%) of patients, the symptoms started with the first dialysis treatment. They reported needing an average of 4.8 hours of rest or sleep to overcome the fatigue symptoms (range, 0 to 24 hours). There were no significant differences between patients with and without PDF in the following parameters: age; sex; type of renal disease; presence of diabetes mellitus, heart disease (congestive, ischemic), or chronic obstructive lung disease; blood pressure response to dialysis; type or adequacy of dialysis regimen; hematocrit; electrolytes; blood urea nitrogen; creatinine; cholesterol; albumin; parathyroid hormone; ejection fraction; and use of antihistamines, benzodiazepines, and narcotics. In the fatigue group, there was significantly greater use of antihypertensive medications known to have fatigue as a side effect (P = 0.007). Depression was more common in the fatigue group by Beck Depression score (11.6 +/- 8.0 v 7.8 +/- 6.3; P = 0.02). We conclude that (1) postdialysis fatigue is a common, often incapacitating symptom in patients on chronic extracorporeal dialysis; (2) no routinely measured parameter of clinical or dialytic function appears to predict postdialysis fatigue; and (3) depression is highly associated with postdialysis fatigue, but the cause-effect relationship is unclear."
CD012347,0,18829212,0,Patient education combined in a music and habit-forming intervention for adherence to continuous positive airway (CPAP) prescribed for sleep apnea.,"As many as 50% of patients diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea stop adhering to the prescribed medical treatment of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) within 1-3 weeks of onset. Thus, a theory-based intervention using music to support habit formation was designed to improve CPAP adherence at onset. The intervention materials included directions for CPAP nightly use, a diary for recording nightly use and writing about CPAP benefits or problems. In addition, an audiotape with softly spoken instructions for placing the CPAP mask comfortably, using deep breathing and muscle relaxation along with the slowly decreasing music tempo was provided to listen to at bedtime each night."

CD012347,0,23917153,0,Functional balance in older adults with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.,"This study assessed functional balance among older adults at all grades of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and explored balance impairment predictors. A cross-sectional study with outpatients with COPD (N = 160; M = 72.2 years, SD = 7.9; mean forced expiratory volume in 1 s = 63.8% predicted, SD = 23.7) was conducted. The Timed Up and Go (TUG) test was used to assess functional balance. Functional balance impairment was defined as a TUG score exceeding the upper limit of the confidence intervals of normative values for healthy older adults. Participants performed the TUG test in 11.0 s (SD = 4.8 s). Functional balance impairment was present in 44.4% of the participants and was significantly more frequent in severe to very severe COPD (62.5%). Body mass index (odds ratio [OR] = 1.12), number of medications (OR = 1.20), restriction in recreational activities (OR = 1.66), and depression score (OR = 1.14) were multivariate predictors of functional balance impairment. Functional balance impairment is present in early COPD, although more evident at advanced grades. These findings highlight the importance of balance assessment in older patients at all COPD grades."
CD012347,0,26586282,0,Preliminary validation and reliability of the Short Form Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire in a lung cancer population.,"The Short Form Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire (SF-CRQ) is frequently used in patients with obstructive pulmonary disease and it has demonstrated excellent psychometric properties. Since there is no psychometric information for its use with lung cancer patients, this study explored its validity and reliability in this population. Forty-six patients were assessed at two time points (with a 4-week interval) using the SF-CRQ, the modified Borg Scale, five numerical rating scales related to Perceived Severity of Breathlessness, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Internal consistency reliability was investigated by Cronbach's alpha reliability coefficient, test-retest reliability by Spearman-Brown reliability coefficient (P), content validity as well as convergent validity by Pearson's correlation coefficient between the SF-CRQ, and the conceptual similar scales mentioned above were explored. A principal component factor analysis was performed. The internal consistency was high [α = 0.88 (baseline) and 0.91 (after 1 month)]. The SF-CRQ had good stability with test-retest reliability ranging from r = 0.64 to 0.78, P < 0.001. Factor analysis suggests a single construct in this population. The preliminary data analyses supported the convergent, content, and construct validity of the SF-CRQ providing promising evidence that this can be a valid and reliable instrument for the assessment of quality of life related to breathlessness in lung cancer patients."
CD012347,0,21596892,0,What prevents people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease from attending pulmonary rehabilitation? A systematic review.,"Pulmonary rehabilitation is an essential component of care for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and is supported by strong scientific evidence. Despite this, many people with COPD do not complete their program or choose not to attend at all. The aim of this study was to determine the factors associated with uptake and completion of pulmonary rehabilitation for people with COPD. Seven electronic databases were searched for qualitative or quantitative studies that documented factors associated with uptake and completion of pulmonary rehabilitation in people with COPD. Two reviewers independently extracted data, which was synthesized to provide overall themes. Travel and transport were consistently identified as barriers to both uptake and completion. A lack of perceived benefit of pulmonary rehabilitation also influenced both uptake and completion. The only demographic features that consistently predicted non-completion were being a current smoker (pooled odds ratio 0.17, 95% confidence interval 0.10 to 0.32) and depression. The limited data available regarding barriers to uptake indicated that disruption to usual routine, influence of the referring doctor and program timing were important. In conclusion poor access to transport and lack of perceived benefit affect uptake of pulmonary rehabilitation. Current smokers and patients who are depressed are at increased risk of non-completion. Enhancing attendance in pulmonary rehabilitation will require more attention to transportation, support for those at risk of non-completion and greater involvement of patients in informed decisions about their care."

CD012347,0,27987002,0,Gender-associated comorbidities in rheumatoid arthritis and their impact on outcome: data from GENIRA.,"GENIRA [Gender in Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA)] is a comprehensive project aimed at studying gender differences in RA patients and how these differences impact on these patient outcomes. We are now reporting such data. Seventy RA patients of each gender were cross-sectionally evaluated following a preestablished protocol. Univariate and multivariate analyses focused in the different gender-associated comorbidity profiles and how they impact in the quality of life and disability of RA patients as assessed by the SF-36 and the Modified Health Assessment Questionnaire (M-HAQ), respectively. Both groups were comparable regarding their main demographic and clinical features. Different comorbidity profiles were found in both genders, with higher frequencies of diabetes mellitus, peptic ulcer, ischemic heart disease, smoking and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease among men and of depression and osteoporosis among women. The M-HAQ was lower in women than in men (0.89 ± 2.6 vs 0.22 ± 0.9, p = 0.04) as there were some sub-scales of the SF-36 [mental health (63.7 ± 22.0 vs 71.8 ± 21.1; p = 0.02), general health (41.3 ± 21.7 vs 50.0 ± 24.3; p = 0.02), physical functioning (PF) (57.7 ± 22.1 vs 67.3 ± 22.7; p = 0.01) and the physical summary component (PSC) (39.3 ± 8.9 vs 42.4 ± 9.3, p = 0.04)]. Multivariate analysis indicated the independent association between depression and osteoporosis rather than gender with the M-HAQ, PSC and PF and of only depression with the MH and GH. Women with RA present significantly worse disability and QOL outcomes than men; these differences can be explained by female gender-associated comorbidities such as depression and osteoporosis rather than gender per se."

Therefore, we developed and implemented a postacute GR program for patients with advanced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (the GR-COPD program). The aim of this study is to investigate the feasibility of the GR-COPD program and to present clinical data on patient characteristics and course of functional capacity and health status. This is a naturalistic prospective cohort study of patients with advanced COPD. A total of 61 patients entered the GR-COPD program and were eligible to participate in this study. All patients suffered from advanced COPD, and comorbidities were frequent. On admission, functional capacity and health status were severely limited but showed significant and clinically relevant improvement during the GR-COPD program. Patients with advanced COPD admitted to hospital for an acute exacerbation suffer from severely impaired functional capacity and poor health status. Development and implementation of a postacute GR program for these patients are feasible and likely to offer substantial improvements. Further research is essential and should focus on designing a controlled intervention trial to investigate the efficacy of the program."

CD012347,0,21819737,0,Anxiety and depression during hospital treatment of exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.,"This study investigated the prevalence, risk factors and rate of recognition of anxiety and depression in 50 patients hospitalized for exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Using the Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders questionnaire, 13 patients were identified as having depression, four had anxiety and eight had a combination of the two. Patients with anxiety and/or depression had a significantly higher partial pressure of oxygen and pH, and a lower partial pressure of carbon dioxide, in arterial blood on admission, more severe dyspnoea after a 6-min walk test and less improvement of dyspnoea from admission to discharge than COPD patients without anxiety and/or depression. Two patients were referred to a mental health specialist during their hospitalization, indicating a low rate of recognition. The results suggest that patients with mental disorders are referred and admitted to hospital earlier in the course of a COPD exacerbation due to earlier and more intense perception of dyspnoea."
CD012347,0,25035178,0,[Psychological burden of patients diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea].,"Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is characterized by repeated episodes of upper airway obstruction during sleep, which leads to the presence of excessive daytime drowsiness. Regarding the psychological comorbidity in patients diagnosed with OSAS, previous studies focused mainly on depressive and secondarily on anxiety symptoms. Due to the lack of research data regarding the prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms as well as of alexithymic characteristics in patients with OSAS in Greece, the aim of the study was to record the above symptomatology in a sample of Greek OSAS patients and to investigate its relation to the respiratory parameter (Apnea-Hypopnea Index, AHI) of polysomnography. The study was conducted in a certified sleep laboratory. Thirty five randomly selected patients who attended the laboratory with symptoms of daytime drowsiness, fatigue, disrupted sleep and snoring, were examined for anxiety, depression and alexithymia using the Spielberger Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20), respectively, 24 hours prior to being submitted to polysomnography. All 35 patients met the inclusion criteria of the study (age≤75 years, no other chronic diseases and no history of major psychiatric disorders). Six patients did not meet the diagnostic criteria for OSAS and were thus used as the control group of the study. A high prevalence of anxiety (41.4%) and depressive (55.2%) symptoms and of alexithymic characteristics (41.4%) was observed in OSAS patients. Although the control group showed a higher prevalence of anxiety (66.7%) and depressive (83.3%) symptoms, there were no differences between the two groups (STAI: t=-0.927, p=0.360, BDI: t=-1.537, p=0.134, TAS-20: t=0.196, p=0.846). With regard to severity, no differences were observed between control, mild, moderate and severe OSAS subgroups (STAI: F=0.583, p=0.660, BDI: F=0.829, p=0.488, TAS-20: F=0.987, p=0.412). Females scored higher on the BDI and on the STAI compared to males (STAI: t=-2.38, p=0.039, BDI: t=-3.59, p=0.01). Finally, no correlation was observed between psychometric scores and AHI (Pearson correlation p>0.05). The study confirms the high prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms which has been found in previous studies. Furthermore, we found a high prevalence of alexithymic characteristics, a factor that has not been investigated previously and which is positively correlated with anxiety symptoms. The coexistence of alexithymic characteristics may further complicate the clinical manifestations of OSAS due to the fact that patients with alexithymia typically have difficulty in indentifying and describing their underlying psychological symptomatology and, moreover, tend to exhibit more, and often atypical, physical symptoms. In conclusion, the study supports the presence of a high degree of psychological burden in patients diagnosed with OSAS, regardless of the severity of their symptoms, as determined by the AHI. This comorbidity should be taken into consideration during the clinical assessment of OSAS and for the treatment planning."

CD012347,0,22614096,0,"Adiposity to muscle ratio predicts incident physical limitation in a cohort of 3,153 older adults--an alternative measurement of sarcopenia and sarcopenic obesity.","Conventionally, sarcopenia is defined by muscle mass and physical performance. We hypothesized that the disability caused by sarcopenia and sarcopenic obesity was related to the amount of adiposity or body weight bearing on a unit of muscle mass, or the adiposity to muscle ratio. We therefore examined whether this ratio could predict physical limitation by secondary analysis of the data in our previous study. We recruited 3,153 community-dwelling adults aged >65 years and their body composition was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Assessment of physical limitation was undertaken 4 years later. The relationship between baseline adiposity to muscle ratio and incident physical limitation was examined by logistic regression. In men, the adiposity to muscle ratios, namely total body fat to lower-limb muscle mass, total body fat to fat-free mass (FFM), and body weight to FFM, were predictive of physical limitation before and after adjustment for the covariates: age, Mini-mental Status Examination score, Geriatric Depression Scale score >8, and the diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, heart disease, and stroke (all p values < 0.001), when the total body fat to lower-limb muscle mass ratio was greater than or equal to 0.75. In women, throughout the entire range of that ratio, all three adiposity to muscle ratios were associated with physical limitation 4 years later both before and after adjustment for the same set of covariates (all p values < 0.05). Sarcopenia and sarcopenic obesity as measured by the body weight or adiposity bearing on a unit of muscle mass (the adiposity to muscle ratio) could predict incident or worsening physical limitation in older women across the entire range of the total body fat to lower-limb muscle mass ratio; and in older men when this ratio was equal to or greater than 0.75."

In order to know the quality of life of patients one year after transplantation, 58 subjects were compared to three different groups of patients (stabilized and acute COPD patients, and lung cancer patients in a surgery unit). Patients filled in two questionnaires: EORTC QLQ-C30 (quality of life) and HAD (anxiety and depression). The quality of life dimensions with inter-group differences were physical, role, emotional and cognitive functioning, global health status, and a number of symptoms (fatigue, dyspnea, insomnia and appetite loss). There were differences in depression, and but not in anxiety. Transplant and surgical patients showed better quality of life and affective status than chronic pulmonary patients. Discriminant analysis showed that the transplant group was the best described group. We conclude that patients, one year after transplantation, show similar quality of life as asymptomatic hospitalised patients, somewhat better than chronic patients in a stabilized stage of the disease, and much better than severe chronic patients."

This prospective study included 416 patients from a university hospital in each of the five Nordic countries. Data included demographic information, spirometry, comorbidity and 12 month follow-up for 406 patients. The hospital anxiety and depression scale and St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) were applied to all patients. The number of patients that had a re-admission within 12 months was 246 (60.6%). Patients that had a re-admission had lower lung function and health status. A low forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and health status were independent predictors for re-admission. Hazard ratio (HR; 95% CI) was 0.82 (0.74-0.90) per 10% increase of the predicted FEV1 and 1.06 (1.02-1.10) per 4 units increase in total SGRQ score. The risk of rehospitalisation was also increased in subjects with anxiety (HR 1.76 (1.16-2.68)) and in subjects with low health status (total SGRQ score >60 units). When comparing the different subscales in the SGRQ, the closest relation between the risk of rehospitalisation was seen with the activity scale (HR 1.07 (1.03-1.11) per 4 unit increase). In patients with low health status, anxiety is an important risk factor for rehospitalisation. This may be important for patient treatment and warrants further studies."

The aims of the study were to describe a COPD population in a rehabilitative setting as regards the patients depressive symptoms, anxiety, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and self-reported adherence and to analyze their relationships; to compare the COPD sample MCI scores with normative data; and to investigate which factors might predict adherence to prescribed physical exercise. This was a multicenter observational cross-sectional study. Of the 117 eligible stable COPD inpatients, 84 were enrolled according to Global initiative for chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) criteria (mainly in Stage III-IV). The assessment included Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), anxiety, depression and self-reported pharmacological and nonpharmacological adherence. From the MMSE, 3.6% of patients were found to be impaired, whereas from the MoCA 9.5% had a likely MCI. Patients referred had mild-severe depression (46.7%), anxiety (40.5%), good pharmacological adherence (80.3%) and difficulties in following prescribed diet (24.1%) and exercise (51.8%); they struggled with disease acceptance (30.9%) and disease limitations acceptance (28.6%). Most of them received good family (89%) or social (53%) support. Nonpharmacological adherence, depression, anxiety and MCI showed significant relations with 6-minute walking test, body mass index (BMI) and GOLD. Depression was related to autonomous long-term oxygen therapy modifications, disease perception, family support and MCI.

Pulmonary rehabilitation is recommended for moderate-to-severe COPD and required by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) prior to lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS). Between January 1998 and July 2002, 1,218 subjects with emphysema and severe airflow limitation (FEV(1) < or = 45% predicted) were randomized. Primary outcome measures were designated as mortality and maximal exercise capacity 2 years after randomization. Pre-randomization, estimated mean total cost per patient of rehabilitation was $2,218 (SD $314; 2006 dollars) for the medical group and $2,187 (SD $304) for the surgical group. Post-randomization, mean cost per patient in the medical and surgical groups was $766 and $962 respectively. Among patients who attended > or = 1 post-randomization rehabilitation session, LVRS patients, patients with an FEV(1) > or = 20% predicted, and higher education were significantly more likely to complete rehabilitation. Patients with depressive and anxiety symptoms, and those who live > 36 miles compared to < 6 miles away were less likely to be adherent. Patients who underwent LVRS completed more exercise sessions than those in the medical group and were more likely to be adherent with post-randomization rehabilitation. A better understanding of patient factors such as socioeconomic status, depression, anxiety and transportation issues may improve adherence to pulmonary rehabilitation."

The ABC scale is part of the ABC tool that visualises the outcomes of the questionnaire. The aim of this study was to assess the reliability and construct validity of the ABC scale. This multi-centre survey study was conducted in the practices of 19 general practitioners and 9 pulmonologists throughout the Netherlands. Next to the ABC scale, patients with COPD completed the Saint George Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). Reliability analyses were performed with data from 162 cases. Cronbach's alpha was 0.91 for the total scale. Test-retest reliability, measured at a two week interval (n = 137), had an intra-class correlation coefficient of 0.92. Analyses for convergent validity were performed with data from 133 cases. Discriminant and known-groups validity was analysed with data from 162 cases. The ABC scale total score had a strong correlation with the total score of the SGRQ (r = 0.72, p < 0.001) but a weak correlation with the forced expired volume in 1 second predicted (r = -0.28, p < 0.001). Subgroups with more severe disease, defined by GOLD-stage, frequency of exacerbations, activity level and depression scored statistically significantly (p < 0.05) worse on almost all domains of the ABC scale than the less severe subgroups. The ABC scale seems a valid and reliable tool with good discriminative properties."
CD012347,0,18773337,0,Comparison of health-related quality of life measurements using a single value in patients with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.,"Three methods have been developed to measure health-related quality of life (HRQoL) expressed as a single value: the global rating scale, the total score obtained from disease-specific instruments, and the preference-based utility index. We compared these different single HRQoL measurements in patients with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We recruited 167 patients with asthma and 161 patients with COPD. The global rating HRQoL was assessed by the Hyland scale. The total HRQoL was assessed by the Living With Asthma Questionnaire in asthma and the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire in COPD. The Quality of Well-being (QWB) scale was used for the utility measurement derived from the Medical Outcome Study Short-form 36. The inter-relationships between these three HRQoL values were weak to moderate in asthma and moderate in COPD. In asthma, the Hyland scale was weakly correlated with the total HRQoL (Spearman's rank correlation coefficients [Rs] = -0.20) and moderately with the QWB score (Rs = -0.43). In the stepwise multiple regression analyses, anxiety on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale and the dyspnea score tended to correlate more significantly with the single HRQoL values in both asthma and COPD than physiological measurements such as the forced expiratory volume in one second. The Hyland scale was less correlated with existing parameters (cumulative coefficient determination [R(2)] = 0.04) than the total HRQoL (cumulative R(2) = 0.47) and the QWB scale (cumulative R(2) = 0.49) in asthma. The single HRQoL values from the Hyland scale, the total HRQoL and the QWB scale evaluated different aspects of asthma and COPD. The psychological status and dyspnea contributed more significantly to the single HRQoL values in these two disorders than the physiological measurements. In asthma, the Hyland scale was especially different from the other single HRQoL scales and should be evaluated separately from the multi-item HRQoL assessments."

In addition, detailed physical and neurological examinations were performed. Sixty-four percent of patients with COPD showed abnormalities in MMSE, predominantly in recent memory, construction, attention, language, and orientation domains. Functional abnormalities were correlated with cognitive abnormalities. Although COPD patients did not show significant depression compared to controls, 77.7%. of the patients showed subjective and objective cognitive disturbance and 72.2% of the patients were classified as questionable or mild dementia. In conclusion, patients with COPD show significant cognitive and functional impairments that cannot be explained just by coincidence or by depression."

HF patients had more central apneas per hour (17.6 vs 5.4; P< or =.01) and obstructive apneas per hour (21.7 vs 8.5; P< or =.05), spent more time in stage 1 sleep (54 vs 35 min; P< or =.05), and had more respiratory awakenings following apneic events (27.2 vs 4.2; P< or =.01). More HF patients were depressed (55% vs 27.2%; P< or =.01) and had worse fatigue (P< or =.05). In multiple regression analysis, physical functioning quality of life was predicted by reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (P< or =.05), shorter distance on a 6-minute walk test (P< or =.05), greater fatigue (P< or =.01), and more apneas ( P< or =.05) (model R(2)=.672; P< or =.001). Emotional functioning quality of life was predicted by greater fatigue (P< or =.01) (model adjusted R(2)=.732; P<.001).

Data were from a random sample of 749 community-dwelling MAs and EAs, aged 65 and older, who participated in the San Antonio Longitudinal Study of Aging (SALSA) baseline examination. Variables examined included LTPA measured as kilocalories of energy expended per week, contextual variables (age, sex, socioeconomic status (SES), acculturation/structural assimilation), psychosocial measures (self-esteem, mastery, perceived health control), lifestyle variables (fat avoidance, current alcohol drinker, years smoking, body mass index (BMI)), and presence of chronic diseases (diabetes mellitus, angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, stroke, hypertension, arthritis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, depression, mild cognitive impairment). Hierarchical multiple regression was used to examine potential mediators of the ethnic group-LTPA association. EAs expended almost 300 kcal/wk more energy than did MAs (1,287 kcal/wk vs 1,001 kcal/wk). SES and psychosocial (self-esteem), lifestyle (fat avoidance, smoking, BMI), and disease (depression) factors that vary by SES explained this ethnic difference. In MAs, structural assimilation, but not acculturation, was significantly associated with LTPA independent of SES. Self-esteem, BMI, and depression explained this association. Psychosocial resources, lifestyle behaviors, and depression explain differences in LTPA between older MAs and EAs. Interventions to increase LTPA in both ethnic groups should be targeted especially at women and persons who have low self-esteem, smoke, and are obese or depressed. In MAs, additional emphasis should be focused on those who are less structurally assimilated into the broader American society."

To compose more individualized strategies, we aim to increase our understanding of characteristics associated with patient activation for self-management and to evaluate whether these are disease-transcending. A cross-sectional survey study was conducted in primary and secondary care in patients with type-2 Diabetes Mellitus (DM-II), Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), Chronic Heart Failure (CHF) and Chronic Renal Disease (CRD). Using multiple linear regression analysis, we analyzed associations between self-management activation (13-item Patient Activation Measure; PAM-13) and a wide range of socio-demographic, clinical, and psychosocial determinants. Furthermore, we assessed whether the associations between the determinants and the PAM were disease-transcending by testing whether disease was an effect modifier. In addition, we identified determinants associated with low activation for self-management using logistic regression analysis. We included 1154 patients (53% response rate); 422 DM-II patients, 290 COPD patients, 223 HF patients and 219 CRD patients. Mean age was 69.6±10.9. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed 9 explanatory determinants of activation for self-management: age, BMI, educational level, financial distress, physical health status, depression, illness perception, social support and underlying disease, explaining a variance of 16.3%. All associations, except for social support, were disease transcending. This study explored factors associated with varying levels of activation for self-management. These results are a first step in supporting clinicians and researchers to identify subpopulations of chronic disease patients less likely to be engaged in self-management. Increased scientific efforts are needed to explain the greater part of the factors that contribute to the complex nature of patient activation for self-management."

A survey sampling.,"The goal of the study was to investigated the prevalence of disability, cognitive impairment, depressive symptomatology and chronic diseases in a sample of the elderly population. A cross-sectional study was carried out on a random sample from the general population of elderly located in a geographically well defined Mediterranean area of Southern Italy. We examined 1339 subjects. Investigated diseases were: chronic obstructive lung disease, hypertension, arthrosis, diabetes mellitus, neurological disease, myocardial infarction, angina, atrial fibrillation, peripheral artery disease and congestive heart failure. Cognitive status was assessed by means of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), depression symptomatology was evaluated by Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) and disability by means of Activities of Daily Living (ADL) and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL). This methodological study showed that 27.9% had a MMSE score <24 and the score decreased with age in both sexes. A total of 9.8% of the subjects had severe depression (GDS score >20). Comorbidity was evaluated from the past medical history and confirmed by a clinical exam by a physician. Only 8.7% of subjects were found without chronic illness. Median number of diseases was two, with 26.6% declaring four diseases or more. Comorbidity increased with age, an overall slight decrease of the number of diseases being observed in the subjects >85 years old. Subjects disabled in ADL were 7%, while disabled in IADL were 46.7%.

CD012347,0,24203764,0,The impact of social support in pulmonary rehabilitation of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.,"Social support has been shown to be an important mediator of health status and survival in chronic illness but little information is available in patients with lung diseases. We used the Social Support Questionnaire (SSQ) to examine the relationships of number of persons (SSQ-N) and satisfaction (SSQ-S) with other measures of health status, treatment changes, and survival in 110 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) participating in a randomized, controlled clinical trial of pulmonary rehabilitation (PR). Included in the analyses were measures of lung function (FEV1.0), exercise tolerance (maximum and endurance), symptoms ratings, age, self-efficacy, depression, and gender. At baseline, SSQ-N and SSQ-S were correlated positively with self-efficacy and negatively with depression and self-reported shortness of breath (SOB). SSQ-N was also correlated with disease severity and maximum exercise tolerance (FEV1.0 and VO2 max). Using the Cox Proportional Hazard Model, SSQ-S was significantly related to improved survival up to six years. However, in multivariate analysis, after adjusting for FEV1.0 and SOB which were better predictors of survival, SSQ-S was marginally significant. SSQ-S and survival were computed separately for males and females across treatment groups. SSQ-S was significantly related to mortality for women but not for men. We conclude that social support is related to measures of physical and psychological function in patients with COPD and may influence improvement and survival after pulmonary rehabilitation."
CD012347,0,25586812,0,A randomised clinical trial of the effectiveness of home-based health care with telemonitoring in patients with COPD.,"We studied the effect of telemonitoring in addition to usual care compared to usual care alone in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). A total of 110 patients with moderate to severe COPD were recruited from a specialist respiratory service in Northern Ireland. Patients had at least two of: emergency department admissions, hospital admissions or emergency general practitioner (GP) contacts in the 12 months before the study. Exclusion criteria were patients who had any respiratory disorder other than COPD, or were cognitively unable to learn the process of monitoring. Patients were randomised to receive six months of home telemonitoring with usual care, or six months of usual care. The primary outcome measure was disease-specific quality of life, as measured by the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire for COPD patients (SGRQ-C). Of 100 patients completing the study, 48 patients were randomised to telemonitoring and 52 patients were randomised to the control group. The SGRQ-C scores improved significantly in the intervention group compared to usual care (P = 0.001). The HADS anxiety score was significantly higher in the telehealth group compared to the usual care group (P = 0.01). There were significantly more contacts with the Community Respiratory Team in the telemonitoring group compared to the control group (P = 0.029). There were no significant between group differences in EQ-5D scores, HADS depression scores, GP activity, emergency department visits, hospital admissions or exacerbations. The total cost to the health service of the intervention over the 6-month study period was £2039, giving an estimated ICER of £203,900. In selected patients with COPD, telemonitoring was effective in improving health-related quality of life and anxiety, but was not a cost-effective intervention."

CD012347,0,24902934,0,Pharmacological treatment of depression in older patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: impact on the course of the disease and health outcomes.,"Over 40 % of older chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients suffer from clinically significant depressive symptoms, which may interfere with their daily activities. Untreated depression may increase physical disability, social isolation, hopelessness and healthcare utilization. This review examined the impact of depression on the course of COPD, and the efficacy of antidepressant drug therapy and its implications for clinical practice. The efficacy of antidepressants in published trials in patients with COPD has been inconclusive. Specifically, there has been no clear evidence that antidepressants can induce remission of depression or ameliorate dyspnoea or physiological indices of COPD. Both selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) studies conducted in depressed COPD patients have been significantly limited by methodological weaknesses including small sample size, sample heterogeneity and variability in the scales used to diagnose and monitor the treatment of depression. For this reason, it remains unclear which SSRIs or TCAs should be favoured in the treatment of depressed COPD patients and what are appropriate dosages and duration ranges. Simply offering antidepressant drugs to older depressed COPD patients is unlikely to improve their condition. Promising treatment strategies such as a collaborative treatment approach and cognitive behavioural therapy should be considered for depressed COPD patients, with or without antidepressant drug therapy. Further studies are needed, including large, randomized, controlled trials with long-term follow-up, to examine the efficacy of antidepressants in patients with COPD."

CD012347,0,18310400,0,Anxiety and depression in end-stage COPD.,"Although feelings of anxiety and depression are common in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), estimates of their prevalence vary considerably. This probably reflects the variety of scales and methods used to measure such symptoms. Regardless of whether anxiety and depression are considered separately or as a single construct, their impact on COPD patients is important. A heightened experience of dyspnoea is likely to be a contributing factor to anxiety. Feelings of depression may be precipitated by the loss and grief associated with the disability of COPD. Smoking has been associated with nicotine addiction, and the factors that contribute to smoking may also predispose to anxiety and depressive disorders. Randomised controlled trials indicate that exercise training and carefully selected pharmacological therapy are often effective in ameliorating anxiety and depression. Most medical illnesses are influenced by the psychological responses and coping mechanisms that patients use. However, anxiety and depression are associated with dyspnoea, fatigue and altered sleep, all of which also occur in COPD. An understanding of the psychological history and coping mechanisms of patients and the role of anxiety and depressive reactions to illness may enable clinicians to reduce these symptoms and improve quality of life among patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease."

Depression and anxiety are challenging to identify and treat because their symptoms often overlap with those of COPD. The cause(s) of depression and anxiety symptoms are multifactorial and include behavioural, social and biological factors. Less than one-third of COPD patients with comorbid depression or anxiety symptoms are receiving appropriate treatment. Factors that contribute to the lack of provision of treatment are varied, they include patient perceived barriers, for example lack of knowledge and reluctance to receive antidepressant drug therapy; poor treatment compliance and lack of a standardised diagnostic approach; and scarcity of adequate resources for mental health treatment. The evidence for the efficacy of antidepressant drug therapy in patients with COPD with comorbid depression and anxiety is inconclusive. There are some promising findings regarding pulmonary rehabilitation, psychological therapy and the collaborative care model in reducing depression and anxiety symptoms in patients with COPD, but these findings are limited by short-term follow-up periods. Further work is required to examine the efficacy of these interventions in randomised controlled trials with larger samples and long-term follow-up."

In a multicentre trial, which studies the long-term effects of three medication regimens (beta-agonist plus either placebo, anticholinergic agent or corticosteroid, all by inhalation) in patients with chronic nonspecific lung disease ((CNSLD): asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)), quality-of-life was included as an additional outcome measure. We wanted to provide a baseline assessment of quality-of-life in 274 adult patients with a mild to moderate degree of CNSLD. Quality-of-life was measured using a set of six standardized tests: Anxiety, Depression and Sleep Disorders, Optimism and Stigma, and Activities of Daily Living were assessed via scales with adequate validity and reliability, as established in previous work in Dutch patients with CNSLD. We found that quality-of-life was mildly impaired in these patients. Although differences with a reference group were present throughout, these were not significant, probably due to selection of relatively young, clinically stable, and highly motivated patients for our study. Quality-of-life scores showed higher correlation coefficients (0.20 < r < 0.38) to symptom scores than did results of pulmonary function tests (r < 0.015).

A single-blind randomised controlled trial recruited people with COPD from primary care and randomised participants to receive usual care or SPACE FOR COPD. Outcome measures were performed at baseline, 6 weeks and 6 months. The primary outcome was symptom burden, measured by the self-reported Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire (CRQ-SR) dyspnoea domain. Secondary outcomes included other domains of the CRQ-SR, shuttle walking tests, disease knowledge, anxiety, depression, self-efficacy, smoking status and healthcare utilisation. 184 people with COPD were recruited and randomised. At 6 weeks, there were significant differences between groups in CRQ-SR dyspnoea, fatigue and emotion scores, exercise performance, anxiety, and disease knowledge. At 6 months, there was no between-group difference in change in CRQ-SR dyspnoea. Exercise performance, anxiety and smoking status were significantly different between groups at 6 months, in favour of the intervention. This brief self-management intervention did not improve dyspnoea over and above usual care at 6 months; however, there were gains in anxiety, exercise performance, and disease knowledge."

CD012347,0,23030586,0,"Effectiveness, attendance, and completion of an integrated, system-wide pulmonary rehabilitation service for COPD: prospective observational study.","Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is one of the most effective treatments for COPD but not widely available. Uptake is poor and completion rates are low. In this integrated PR service we report on effectiveness, attendance, and completion of twice weekly rolling recruitment and once weekly cohort recruitment programmes in two hospital and five community PR sites. The hospital and two of the community programmes were 'rolling' recruitment twice weekly for 8 weeks. Three community programmes ran in once weekly cohorts for 8 weeks. Predictors of attendance, completion and effectiveness were sought. 1114 eligible COPD patients were referred. 812 (73%) attended assessment, 656 (59%) started and 441 (40%) completed. Significant improvements were seen in incremental shuttle walk test (ISWT) (mean 68.3 m; 95%CI 59.3-77.4), Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire self-report dyspnoea scale (CRQ-SR) (0.94; 0.80-1.07), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale anxiety (0.9; 0.5-1.2) and depression (1.1; 0.8-1.4) components, exceeding the minimum clinically important difference for ISWT and CRQ-SR. Twice weekly compared with once weekly programmes showed similar improvement. Patients were less likely to complete if they were deprived (4(th) quintile of deprivation 0.56; 0.33-0.94, 5(th) quintile 0.57; 0.34-0.85), reported MRC dyspnoea scale 4 (0.61; 0.37-0.97) or 5 (0.39; 0.16-0.93), or had been referred by their general practitioner (0.42; 0.24-0.74) (pseudo R(2) 0.103). PR is effective for COPD in real-world practice achieving results comparable to trials. Low rates of attendance and completion of PR were not explained by demographic characteristics, disease severity, psychological morbidity and source of referral despite the large number of participants."
CD012347,0,15983239,0,Effects of noncardiovascular comorbidities on antihypertensive use in elderly hypertensives.,"Although the benefits of antihypertensive drugs have been clearly established, they remain underused by vulnerable older populations. We examined whether the presence of noncardiovascular comorbidity deters use of antihypertensives in elderly with hypertension. We conducted a retrospective cohort study among 51,517 patients > or =65 years of age in the Pennsylvania Pharmaceutical Assistance Contract for the Elderly (PACE) Program during 1999 and 2000. All were hypertensive and had diagnoses and used treatments during 1999 to qualify for entry into 1 of the following 5 mutually exclusive cohorts: asthma/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), depression, gastrointestinal (GI) disorders, osteoarthritis, or none of the 4 comorbidities. Proportions using antihypertensives in 2000 were assessed. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify the independent effects on antihypertensive use of the 4 comorbidities of interest, sociodemographic characteristics, other cardiovascular and noncardiovascular comorbidity, and health care utilization variables. After adjustments in multivariable analyses, antihypertensive use was consistently lower in patients with asthma/COPD (odds ratio [OR], 0.43; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.40 to 0.47), depression (OR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.45 to 0.55), GI disorders (OR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.54 to 0.64), and osteoarthritis (OR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.59 to 0.67) relative to those without these conditions. Reduced antihypertensive use was also associated with older age, female gender, white race, more severe other comorbidities, absence of some cardiovascular indications, hospitalizations, nursing home care, physician visits, and use of fewer other medications. Highly prevalent, noncardiovascular conditions appear to deter use of antihypertensives in elderly with hypertension."

CD012347,0,22337330,0,[Fear of progression and end-of-life fear in COPD patients].,"Anxiety and depression are prevalent comorbid conditions in COPD. Furthermore, diseases related anxieties (fear of progression, end-of-life fear) occur very often. Anxiety can have a negative impact on patients' quality of life and is sometimes even considered as a risk factor for re-hospitalisation. There are only a few studies that focus on disease related anxieties in COPD. The aim of our study was to investigate the associations between disease related anxieties (fear of progression, end-of-life fear), psychological health status and quality of life in COPD patients. 132 patients with COPD (GOLD II-IV) participated in the study. Results of a MANOVA showed no differences between diseases related anxieties among patients with different disease severity (GOLD II-IV). Furthermore, the results showed significant associations between end-of-life fear, fear of progression, depression and quality of life. Further analyses showed that there is a need for managing end-of-life fears and improving end-of-life care. Overall, our study showed, that health disease related anxieties play an important role in COPD and still do not receive enough attention."
CD012347,0,28528563,0,Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease associated with increased risk of bipolar disorder.,"Epidemiological studies have identified a trend in the development of depressive and anxiety disorders following a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, the relationship between COPD and subsequent bipolar disorder remains unclear. From January 1, 2000, we identified adult patients with COPD from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. A nationwide population-based study was conducted; 46,778 COPD patients and 46,778 age-, sex-, and comorbidity-matched subjects between 2000 and 2011 were enrolled. The two cohorts were followed up till December 31, 2011 and observed for occurrence of bipolar disorder. We observed the COPD and comparison cohorts for 263,020 and 267,895 person-years, respectively, from 2000 to 2011. The incidence rate for bipolar disorder was 1.6/1000 person-years in the COPD cohort and 1.2/1000 person-years in the comparison cohort ( p < 0.001). After multivariate adjustment, the hazard ratio (HR) for subsequent bipolar disorder among the COPD patients was 1.42 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.22-1.64; p < 0.001). In the COPD patients, short-acting beta-agonists (SABAs) was associated with a significantly increased risk of bipolar disorder development (HR = 1.83, 95% CI = 1.25-2.69, p = 0.002). Other COPD medications were not associated with the risk of bipolar disorder development. The study results indicate that COPD may be an independent risk factor for the development of bipolar disorder. The regular use of SABAs might increase the risk of bipolar disorder in COPD patients."

CD012347,0,2341263,0,Psychophysiologic aspects of dyspnea in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a pilot study.,"The level of dyspnea reported by the patient with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is related to both the physiologic and psychologic state of the person at the time. The purpose of this pilot study was to explore, from a psychophysiologic perspective, the differences in anxiety, depression, and somatization during times of high and low levels of dyspnea. Six male subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, with a mean age of 64 years and a mean forced expiratory volume in 1 second that was 44% of predicted, completed the study. They were assessed for clinical signs and their level of dyspnea indicated on a vertical visual analogue scale, after which they completed the Spielberger State Anxiety Inventory and the Brief Symptom Inventory. Arterial blood was then drawn for blood gas analysis and determination of cortisol level. All measures were repeated twice, once when the subject reported a high level of dyspnea and once when he reported a low level. Analysis of the data by use of t tests for paired groups indicated that during times of high dyspnea levels subjects had greater anxiety, accessory muscle use, cortisol level, and PCO2 level. Subjects receiving oral prednisone had high depression levels that increased during times of severe dyspnea. Somatization, PO2, respiratory rate, depth of respiration, and other clinical signs did not change with dyspnea level. These results indicate that dyspnea is accompanied by both psychologic and physiologic changes that can be targeted to assist in alleviating this distressing symptom."

CD012347,0,18229570,0,Factors affecting health status in COPD patients with co-morbid anxiety or depression.,"Health status questionnaires provide standardized measures of patients' perceptions of the impact of disease on their daily life and well-being. Factors associated with health status were examined in a sample of 58 outpatients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and co-morbid anxiety and/or depression. A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted with the following measures: The St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ); the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI); the Beck Depression Inventory, 2nd edition (BDI); the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI); and spirometry. Disease severity as measured with spirometrywas not related to health status. Perceptions of poor health as implied by the health status scores were positively associated with symptoms of anxiety and depression, sleep disturbances, and level of daily functioning. There were statistically significant differences between men and women on COPD severity, age, and the BAI scores. The findings emphasize the importance of screening the patients at all stages of disease severity for anxiety, depression, and sleeping problems, in order to provide adequate care for these problems."

CD012347,0,26366639,0,Psychosocial Predictors of Mortality Following Lung Transplantation.,"Lung transplantation has become an increasingly common treatment for patients with end-stage lung disease. Few studies have examined psychosocial risk factors for mortality in transplant recipients, despite evidence suggesting that elevated levels of negative affect are associated with greater mortality following major cardiac surgery. We therefore examined the relationship between negative affect early after lung transplantation and long-term survival in a sample of 132 lung transplant recipients (28 cystic fibrosis, 64 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 26 idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, 14 other) followed for up to 13.5 years (median 7.4 years) following transplantation. Patients underwent both medical and psychosocial assessments 6 months following transplantation, which included the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), Spielberger Anxiety Inventory, and General Health Questionnaire (GHQ). Over the course of follow-up, 80 (61%) participants died. Controlling for demographic factors, native lung disease, disease severity, family income, education level, social support, and frequency of posttransplant rejection, elevated symptoms of depression (BDI-II: HR = 1.31, p = 0.011) and distress (GHQ: HR = 1.28, p = 0.003) were associated with increased mortality. Higher levels of depression and general distress, but not anxiety, measured 6 months following lung transplantation are associated with increased mortality, independent of background characteristics and medical predictors."

The 6-minute walk test (6MWT) is commonly used to measure functional capacity in COPD patients and has three potential outcomes; walking distance, oxygen desaturation, and self-perceived dyspnea assessed by the Borg scale, all reflecting different aspects of COPD. The aim of this study was to identify predictors of all 3 outcomes of 6MWT in patients with COPD."
