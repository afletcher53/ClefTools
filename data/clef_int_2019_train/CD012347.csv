CD012347,0,16135721,0,"Risk factors for rehospitalisation in COPD: role of health status, anxiety and depression.","The aim of the present study was to analyse the risk of rehospitalisation in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and associated risk factors. This prospective study included 416 patients from a university hospital in each of the five Nordic countries. Data included demographic information, spirometry, comorbidity and 12 month follow-up for 406 patients. The hospital anxiety and depression scale and St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) were applied to all patients. The number of patients that had a re-admission within 12 months was 246 (60.6%). Patients that had a re-admission had lower lung function and health status. A low forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and health status were independent predictors for re-admission. Hazard ratio (HR; 95% CI) was 0.82 (0.74-0.90) per 10% increase of the predicted FEV1 and 1.06 (1.02-1.10) per 4 units increase in total SGRQ score. The risk of rehospitalisation was also increased in subjects with anxiety (HR 1.76 (1.16-2.68)) and in subjects with low health status (total SGRQ score >60 units). When comparing the different subscales in the SGRQ, the closest relation between the risk of rehospitalisation was seen with the activity scale (HR 1.07 (1.03-1.11) per 4 unit increase). In patients with low health status, anxiety is an important risk factor for rehospitalisation. This may be important for patient treatment and warrants further studies."

CD012347,0,23319857,0,Managing mood disorders in patients attending pulmonary rehabilitation clinics.,"There is good evidence for the positive benefits of pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) in the prevention of hospital admissions, lower mortality, and improved health-related quality of life. There is also increasing evidence about the impact of PR on mental health and, in particular, mood disorders. We aimed to identify how depression in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients in Victoria, Australia, is being managed in PR, to identify the prevalence of depressive symptoms among COPD patients who attend PR, and to determine whether patients with depressive symptoms or anxiety symptoms dropped out of PR early."
CD012347,0,28790808,0,"COPD patients' self-reported adherence, psychosocial factors and mild cognitive impairment in pulmonary rehabilitation.","In addition to clinical comorbidities, psychological and neuropsychological problems are frequent in COPD and may affect pulmonary rehabilitation delivery and outcome. The aims of the study were to describe a COPD population in a rehabilitative setting as regards the patients depressive symptoms, anxiety, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and self-reported adherence and to analyze their relationships; to compare the COPD sample MCI scores with normative data; and to investigate which factors might predict adherence to prescribed physical exercise. This was a multicenter observational cross-sectional study. Of the 117 eligible stable COPD inpatients, 84 were enrolled according to Global initiative for chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) criteria (mainly in Stage III-IV). The assessment included Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), anxiety, depression and self-reported pharmacological and nonpharmacological adherence. From the MMSE, 3.6% of patients were found to be impaired, whereas from the MoCA 9.5% had a likely MCI. Patients referred had mild-severe depression (46.7%), anxiety (40.5%), good pharmacological adherence (80.3%) and difficulties in following prescribed diet (24.1%) and exercise (51.8%); they struggled with disease acceptance (30.9%) and disease limitations acceptance (28.6%). Most of them received good family (89%) or social (53%) support. Nonpharmacological adherence, depression, anxiety and MCI showed significant relations with 6-minute walking test, body mass index (BMI) and GOLD. Depression was related to autonomous long-term oxygen therapy modifications, disease perception, family support and MCI. In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, higher BMI, higher depression and lower anxiety predicted lower adherence to exercise prescriptions ("
CD012347,0,18415809,0,Costs of pulmonary rehabilitation and predictors of adherence in the National Emphysema Treatment Trial.,"This study reports the costs associated with rehabilitation among participants in the National Emphysema Treatment Trial (NETT), and evaluates factors associated with adherence to rehabilitation. Pulmonary rehabilitation is recommended for moderate-to-severe COPD and required by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) prior to lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS). Between January 1998 and July 2002, 1,218 subjects with emphysema and severe airflow limitation (FEV(1) < or = 45% predicted) were randomized. Primary outcome measures were designated as mortality and maximal exercise capacity 2 years after randomization. Pre-randomization, estimated mean total cost per patient of rehabilitation was $2,218 (SD $314; 2006 dollars) for the medical group and $2,187 (SD $304) for the surgical group. Post-randomization, mean cost per patient in the medical and surgical groups was $766 and $962 respectively. Among patients who attended > or = 1 post-randomization rehabilitation session, LVRS patients, patients with an FEV(1) > or = 20% predicted, and higher education were significantly more likely to complete rehabilitation. Patients with depressive and anxiety symptoms, and those who live > 36 miles compared to < 6 miles away were less likely to be adherent.

CD012347,0,26788838,0,The Assessment of Burden of COPD (ABC) Scale: A Reliable and Valid Questionnaire.,"The newly developed Assessment of Burden of COPD (ABC) scale is a 14-item self-administered questionnaire which measures the physical, psychological, emotional and/or social burden as experienced by patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The ABC scale is part of the ABC tool that visualises the outcomes of the questionnaire. The aim of this study was to assess the reliability and construct validity of the ABC scale. This multi-centre survey study was conducted in the practices of 19 general practitioners and 9 pulmonologists throughout the Netherlands. Next to the ABC scale, patients with COPD completed the Saint George Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). Reliability analyses were performed with data from 162 cases. Cronbach's alpha was 0.91 for the total scale. Test-retest reliability, measured at a two week interval (n = 137), had an intra-class correlation coefficient of 0.92. Analyses for convergent validity were performed with data from 133 cases. Discriminant and known-groups validity was analysed with data from 162 cases. The ABC scale total score had a strong correlation with the total score of the SGRQ (r = 0.72, p < 0.001) but a weak correlation with the forced expired volume in 1 second predicted (r = -0.28, p < 0.001). Subgroups with more severe disease, defined by GOLD-stage, frequency of exacerbations, activity level and depression scored statistically significantly (p < 0.05) worse on almost all domains of the ABC scale than the less severe subgroups. The ABC scale seems a valid and reliable tool with good discriminative properties."
CD012347,0,18773337,0,Comparison of health-related quality of life measurements using a single value in patients with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.,"Three methods have been developed to measure health-related quality of life (HRQoL) expressed as a single value: the global rating scale, the total score obtained from disease-specific instruments, and the preference-based utility index. We compared these different single HRQoL measurements in patients with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We recruited 167 patients with asthma and 161 patients with COPD. The global rating HRQoL was assessed by the Hyland scale. The total HRQoL was assessed by the Living With Asthma Questionnaire in asthma and the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire in COPD. The Quality of Well-being (QWB) scale was used for the utility measurement derived from the Medical Outcome Study Short-form 36. The inter-relationships between these three HRQoL values were weak to moderate in asthma and moderate in COPD. In asthma, the Hyland scale was weakly correlated with the total HRQoL (Spearman's rank correlation coefficients [Rs] = -0.20) and moderately with the QWB score (Rs = -0.43). In the stepwise multiple regression analyses, anxiety on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale and the dyspnea score tended to correlate more significantly with the single HRQoL values in both asthma and COPD than physiological measurements such as the forced expiratory volume in one second. The Hyland scale was less correlated with existing parameters (cumulative coefficient determination [R(2)] = 0.04) than the total HRQoL (cumulative R(2) = 0.47) and the QWB scale (cumulative R(2) = 0.49) in asthma. The single HRQoL values from the Hyland scale, the total HRQoL and the QWB scale evaluated different aspects of asthma and COPD. The psychological status and dyspnea contributed more significantly to the single HRQoL values in these two disorders than the physiological measurements. In asthma, the Hyland scale was especially different from the other single HRQoL scales and should be evaluated separately from the multi-item HRQoL assessments."

CD012347,0,16873924,0,Cognitive and functional deterioration in patients with severe COPD.,"The objective of this study was to examine the association among the duration of COPD, degree of hypoxemia, and neurological abnormalities including cognitive functioning. Fifty-four patients with severe COPD and 24 age- and sex-matched controls, were included in the study. All patients and controls were administered pulmonary function tests, standardized Mini-mental State Examination (MMSE), Blessed Dementia Scale (BDS), Physical Self-maintenance Scale (PSMS), Modified Activities of Daily Living scale (MADL), Instrumental Activities of Daily Living scale (IADL), Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (CSDD), Global Deterioration Scale (GDS) and Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR). In addition, detailed physical and neurological examinations were performed. Sixty-four percent of patients with COPD showed abnormalities in MMSE, predominantly in recent memory, construction, attention, language, and orientation domains. Functional abnormalities were correlated with cognitive abnormalities. Although COPD patients did not show significant depression compared to controls, 77.7%. of the patients showed subjective and objective cognitive disturbance and 72.2% of the patients were classified as questionable or mild dementia. In conclusion, patients with COPD show significant cognitive and functional impairments that cannot be explained just by coincidence or by depression."
CD012347,0,19751424,0,Sleep and health-related quality of life in heart failure.,"This study characterized sleep in heart failure (HF) and determined associations with quality of life. Forty stable HF patients and 34 healthy volunteers were studied in a clinical research unit. HF patients had more central apneas per hour (17.6 vs 5.4; P< or =.01) and obstructive apneas per hour (21.7 vs 8.5; P< or =.05), spent more time in stage 1 sleep (54 vs 35 min; P< or =.05), and had more respiratory awakenings following apneic events (27.2 vs 4.2; P< or =.01). More HF patients were depressed (55% vs 27.2%; P< or =.01) and had worse fatigue (P< or =.05). In multiple regression analysis, physical functioning quality of life was predicted by reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (P< or =.05), shorter distance on a 6-minute walk test (P< or =.05), greater fatigue (P< or =.01), and more apneas ( P< or =.05) (model R(2)=.672; P< or =.001). Emotional functioning quality of life was predicted by greater fatigue (P< or =.01) (model adjusted R(2)=.732; P<.001). Findings provide evidence that in addition to functional status and ongoing fatigue, poorer quality of life in HF is independently related to the severity of sleep-disordered breathing."
CD012347,0,16108946,0,Potential mediators of ethnic differences in physical activity in older Mexican Americans and European Americans: results from the San Antonio Longitudinal Study of Aging.,"Factors were examined that might explain reported ethnic differences in leisure time physical activity (LTPA) between Mexican Americans (MAs) and European Americans (EAs). Data were from a random sample of 749 community-dwelling MAs and EAs, aged 65 and older, who participated in the San Antonio Longitudinal Study of Aging (SALSA) baseline examination. Variables examined included LTPA measured as kilocalories of energy expended per week, contextual variables (age, sex, socioeconomic status (SES), acculturation/structural assimilation), psychosocial measures (self-esteem, mastery, perceived health control), lifestyle variables (fat avoidance, current alcohol drinker, years smoking, body mass index (BMI)), and presence of chronic diseases (diabetes mellitus, angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, stroke, hypertension, arthritis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, depression, mild cognitive impairment). Hierarchical multiple regression was used to examine potential mediators of the ethnic group-LTPA association. EAs expended almost 300 kcal/wk more energy than did MAs (1,287 kcal/wk vs 1,001 kcal/wk). SES and psychosocial (self-esteem), lifestyle (fat avoidance, smoking, BMI), and disease (depression) factors that vary by SES explained this ethnic difference. In MAs, structural assimilation, but not acculturation, was significantly associated with LTPA independent of SES. Self-esteem, BMI, and depression explained this association. Psychosocial resources, lifestyle behaviors, and depression explain differences in LTPA between older MAs and EAs. Interventions to increase LTPA in both ethnic groups should be targeted especially at women and persons who have low self-esteem, smoke, and are obese or depressed. In MAs, additional emphasis should be focused on those who are less structurally assimilated into the broader American society."

Part A: after confirmation of eligibility, participants were randomly allocated to either the t'ai chi group or control group (usual medical care). Participants in the t'ai chi group trained twice weekly for 12 weeks. Part B: participants who had completed training in the t'ai chi group performed a peak exercise test (incremental shuttle walk test) and SSTC while oxygen consumption (VO₂) was measured. Exercise intensity of SSTC was determined by the per cent of VO₂ reserve. Of 42 participants (mean ± sd forced expiratory volume in 1 s 59 ± 16% predicted), 38 completed part A and 15 completed part B. Compared to control, SSTC significantly increased endurance shuttle walk time (mean difference 384 s, 95% CI 186-510); reduced medial-lateral body sway in semi-tandem stand (mean difference -12.4 mm, 95% CI -21- -3); and increased total score on the chronic respiratory disease questionnaire (mean difference 11 points, 95% CI 4-18).

To compose more individualized strategies, we aim to increase our understanding of characteristics associated with patient activation for self-management and to evaluate whether these are disease-transcending. A cross-sectional survey study was conducted in primary and secondary care in patients with type-2 Diabetes Mellitus (DM-II), Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), Chronic Heart Failure (CHF) and Chronic Renal Disease (CRD). Using multiple linear regression analysis, we analyzed associations between self-management activation (13-item Patient Activation Measure; PAM-13) and a wide range of socio-demographic, clinical, and psychosocial determinants. Furthermore, we assessed whether the associations between the determinants and the PAM were disease-transcending by testing whether disease was an effect modifier. In addition, we identified determinants associated with low activation for self-management using logistic regression analysis. We included 1154 patients (53% response rate); 422 DM-II patients, 290 COPD patients, 223 HF patients and 219 CRD patients. Mean age was 69.6±10.9. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed 9 explanatory determinants of activation for self-management: age, BMI, educational level, financial distress, physical health status, depression, illness perception, social support and underlying disease, explaining a variance of 16.3%. All associations, except for social support, were disease transcending. This study explored factors associated with varying levels of activation for self-management. These results are a first step in supporting clinicians and researchers to identify subpopulations of chronic disease patients less likely to be engaged in self-management. Increased scientific efforts are needed to explain the greater part of the factors that contribute to the complex nature of patient activation for self-management."

A survey sampling.,"The goal of the study was to investigated the prevalence of disability, cognitive impairment, depressive symptomatology and chronic diseases in a sample of the elderly population. A cross-sectional study was carried out on a random sample from the general population of elderly located in a geographically well defined Mediterranean area of Southern Italy. We examined 1339 subjects. Investigated diseases were: chronic obstructive lung disease, hypertension, arthrosis, diabetes mellitus, neurological disease, myocardial infarction, angina, atrial fibrillation, peripheral artery disease and congestive heart failure. Cognitive status was assessed by means of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), depression symptomatology was evaluated by Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) and disability by means of Activities of Daily Living (ADL) and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL). This methodological study showed that 27.9% had a MMSE score <24 and the score decreased with age in both sexes. A total of 9.8% of the subjects had severe depression (GDS score >20). Comorbidity was evaluated from the past medical history and confirmed by a clinical exam by a physician. Only 8.7% of subjects were found without chronic illness. Median number of diseases was two, with 26.6% declaring four diseases or more. Comorbidity increased with age, an overall slight decrease of the number of diseases being observed in the subjects >85 years old. Subjects disabled in ADL were 7%, while disabled in IADL were 46.7%.

CD012347,0,24203764,0,The impact of social support in pulmonary rehabilitation of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.,"Social support has been shown to be an important mediator of health status and survival in chronic illness but little information is available in patients with lung diseases. We used the Social Support Questionnaire (SSQ) to examine the relationships of number of persons (SSQ-N) and satisfaction (SSQ-S) with other measures of health status, treatment changes, and survival in 110 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) participating in a randomized, controlled clinical trial of pulmonary rehabilitation (PR). Included in the analyses were measures of lung function (FEV1.0), exercise tolerance (maximum and endurance), symptoms ratings, age, self-efficacy, depression, and gender. At baseline, SSQ-N and SSQ-S were correlated positively with self-efficacy and negatively with depression and self-reported shortness of breath (SOB). SSQ-N was also correlated with disease severity and maximum exercise tolerance (FEV1.0 and VO2 max). Using the Cox Proportional Hazard Model, SSQ-S was significantly related to improved survival up to six years. However, in multivariate analysis, after adjusting for FEV1.0 and SOB which were better predictors of survival, SSQ-S was marginally significant. SSQ-S and survival were computed separately for males and females across treatment groups. SSQ-S was significantly related to mortality for women but not for men. We conclude that social support is related to measures of physical and psychological function in patients with COPD and may influence improvement and survival after pulmonary rehabilitation."
CD012347,0,25586812,0,A randomised clinical trial of the effectiveness of home-based health care with telemonitoring in patients with COPD.,"We studied the effect of telemonitoring in addition to usual care compared to usual care alone in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). A total of 110 patients with moderate to severe COPD were recruited from a specialist respiratory service in Northern Ireland. Patients had at least two of: emergency department admissions, hospital admissions or emergency general practitioner (GP) contacts in the 12 months before the study. Exclusion criteria were patients who had any respiratory disorder other than COPD, or were cognitively unable to learn the process of monitoring. Patients were randomised to receive six months of home telemonitoring with usual care, or six months of usual care. The primary outcome measure was disease-specific quality of life, as measured by the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire for COPD patients (SGRQ-C). Of 100 patients completing the study, 48 patients were randomised to telemonitoring and 52 patients were randomised to the control group. The SGRQ-C scores improved significantly in the intervention group compared to usual care (P = 0.001). The HADS anxiety score was significantly higher in the telehealth group compared to the usual care group (P = 0.01). There were significantly more contacts with the Community Respiratory Team in the telemonitoring group compared to the control group (P = 0.029). There were no significant between group differences in EQ-5D scores, HADS depression scores, GP activity, emergency department visits, hospital admissions or exacerbations. The total cost to the health service of the intervention over the 6-month study period was £2039, giving an estimated ICER of £203,900. In selected patients with COPD, telemonitoring was effective in improving health-related quality of life and anxiety, but was not a cost-effective intervention."

CD012347,0,24902934,0,Pharmacological treatment of depression in older patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: impact on the course of the disease and health outcomes.,"Over 40 % of older chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients suffer from clinically significant depressive symptoms, which may interfere with their daily activities. Untreated depression may increase physical disability, social isolation, hopelessness and healthcare utilization. This review examined the impact of depression on the course of COPD, and the efficacy of antidepressant drug therapy and its implications for clinical practice. The efficacy of antidepressants in published trials in patients with COPD has been inconclusive. Specifically, there has been no clear evidence that antidepressants can induce remission of depression or ameliorate dyspnoea or physiological indices of COPD. Both selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) studies conducted in depressed COPD patients have been significantly limited by methodological weaknesses including small sample size, sample heterogeneity and variability in the scales used to diagnose and monitor the treatment of depression. For this reason, it remains unclear which SSRIs or TCAs should be favoured in the treatment of depressed COPD patients and what are appropriate dosages and duration ranges. Simply offering antidepressant drugs to older depressed COPD patients is unlikely to improve their condition. Promising treatment strategies such as a collaborative treatment approach and cognitive behavioural therapy should be considered for depressed COPD patients, with or without antidepressant drug therapy. Further studies are needed, including large, randomized, controlled trials with long-term follow-up, to examine the efficacy of antidepressants in patients with COPD."

CD012347,0,18310400,0,Anxiety and depression in end-stage COPD.,"Although feelings of anxiety and depression are common in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), estimates of their prevalence vary considerably. This probably reflects the variety of scales and methods used to measure such symptoms. Regardless of whether anxiety and depression are considered separately or as a single construct, their impact on COPD patients is important. A heightened experience of dyspnoea is likely to be a contributing factor to anxiety. Feelings of depression may be precipitated by the loss and grief associated with the disability of COPD. Smoking has been associated with nicotine addiction, and the factors that contribute to smoking may also predispose to anxiety and depressive disorders. Randomised controlled trials indicate that exercise training and carefully selected pharmacological therapy are often effective in ameliorating anxiety and depression. Most medical illnesses are influenced by the psychological responses and coping mechanisms that patients use. However, anxiety and depression are associated with dyspnoea, fatigue and altered sleep, all of which also occur in COPD. An understanding of the psychological history and coping mechanisms of patients and the role of anxiety and depressive reactions to illness may enable clinicians to reduce these symptoms and improve quality of life among patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease."

CD012347,0,23585837,0,The effect of complex interventions on depression and anxiety in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: systematic review and meta-analysis.,Depression and anxiety are very common in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and are associated with excess morbidity and mortality. Patients prefer non-drug treatments and clinical guidelines promote non-pharmacological interventions as first line therapy for depression and anxiety in people with long term conditions. However the comparative effectiveness of psychological and lifestyle interventions among COPD patients is not known. We assessed whether complex psychological and/or lifestyle interventions are effective in reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression in patients with COPD. We then determined what types of psychological and lifestyle interventions are most effective.

The patients were divided into three diagnostic groups: Two had cystic fibrosis and one an obstructive lung disease, heart-lung group, eight had congenital heart disease and 13 cardiomyopathy. 15 children were accepted for transplantation and placed on the waiting list. The others were rejected for medical reasons. Seven children (29%) filled the criteria for a psychiatric diagnosis (six anxiety disorders and one depression). Five others had considerable anxiety symptoms. The cardiomyopathy group had fewer problems than the heart-lung and congenital heart disease groups.

CD012347,0,25176970,0,Depression and anxiety in patients with COPD.,"Under-recognised and untreated depression and anxiety symptoms have deleterious effects on physical functioning and social interaction increasing fatigue and healthcare utilisation in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Depression and anxiety are challenging to identify and treat because their symptoms often overlap with those of COPD. The cause(s) of depression and anxiety symptoms are multifactorial and include behavioural, social and biological factors. Less than one-third of COPD patients with comorbid depression or anxiety symptoms are receiving appropriate treatment. Factors that contribute to the lack of provision of treatment are varied, they include patient perceived barriers, for example lack of knowledge and reluctance to receive antidepressant drug therapy; poor treatment compliance and lack of a standardised diagnostic approach; and scarcity of adequate resources for mental health treatment. The evidence for the efficacy of antidepressant drug therapy in patients with COPD with comorbid depression and anxiety is inconclusive. There are some promising findings regarding pulmonary rehabilitation, psychological therapy and the collaborative care model in reducing depression and anxiety symptoms in patients with COPD, but these findings are limited by short-term follow-up periods. Further work is required to examine the efficacy of these interventions in randomised controlled trials with larger samples and long-term follow-up."

In a multicentre trial, which studies the long-term effects of three medication regimens (beta-agonist plus either placebo, anticholinergic agent or corticosteroid, all by inhalation) in patients with chronic nonspecific lung disease ((CNSLD): asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)), quality-of-life was included as an additional outcome measure. We wanted to provide a baseline assessment of quality-of-life in 274 adult patients with a mild to moderate degree of CNSLD. Quality-of-life was measured using a set of six standardized tests: Anxiety, Depression and Sleep Disorders, Optimism and Stigma, and Activities of Daily Living were assessed via scales with adequate validity and reliability, as established in previous work in Dutch patients with CNSLD. We found that quality-of-life was mildly impaired in these patients. Although differences with a reference group were present throughout, these were not significant, probably due to selection of relatively young, clinically stable, and highly motivated patients for our study. Quality-of-life scores showed higher correlation coefficients (0.20 < r < 0.38) to symptom scores than did results of pulmonary function tests (r < 0.015). In logistic regression models, absence from work and hospitalizations due to CNSLD were partly determined by quality-of-life scores.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

The Self-Management Programme of Activity, Coping and Education (SPACE) FOR COPD is a 6-week self-management intervention for COPD, and this study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of this intervention in primary care. A single-blind randomised controlled trial recruited people with COPD from primary care and randomised participants to receive usual care or SPACE FOR COPD. Outcome measures were performed at baseline, 6 weeks and 6 months. The primary outcome was symptom burden, measured by the self-reported Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire (CRQ-SR) dyspnoea domain. Secondary outcomes included other domains of the CRQ-SR, shuttle walking tests, disease knowledge, anxiety, depression, self-efficacy, smoking status and healthcare utilisation. 184 people with COPD were recruited and randomised. At 6 weeks, there were significant differences between groups in CRQ-SR dyspnoea, fatigue and emotion scores, exercise performance, anxiety, and disease knowledge. At 6 months, there was no between-group difference in change in CRQ-SR dyspnoea. Exercise performance, anxiety and smoking status were significantly different between groups at 6 months, in favour of the intervention. This brief self-management intervention did not improve dyspnoea over and above usual care at 6 months; however, there were gains in anxiety, exercise performance, and disease knowledge."

Uptake is poor and completion rates are low. In this integrated PR service we report on effectiveness, attendance, and completion of twice weekly rolling recruitment and once weekly cohort recruitment programmes in two hospital and five community PR sites. The hospital and two of the community programmes were 'rolling' recruitment twice weekly for 8 weeks. Three community programmes ran in once weekly cohorts for 8 weeks. Predictors of attendance, completion and effectiveness were sought. 1114 eligible COPD patients were referred. 812 (73%) attended assessment, 656 (59%) started and 441 (40%) completed. Significant improvements were seen in incremental shuttle walk test (ISWT) (mean 68.3 m; 95%CI 59.3-77.4), Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire self-report dyspnoea scale (CRQ-SR) (0.94; 0.80-1.07), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale anxiety (0.9; 0.5-1.2) and depression (1.1; 0.8-1.4) components, exceeding the minimum clinically important difference for ISWT and CRQ-SR.

We examined whether the presence of noncardiovascular comorbidity deters use of antihypertensives in elderly with hypertension. We conducted a retrospective cohort study among 51,517 patients > or =65 years of age in the Pennsylvania Pharmaceutical Assistance Contract for the Elderly (PACE) Program during 1999 and 2000. All were hypertensive and had diagnoses and used treatments during 1999 to qualify for entry into 1 of the following 5 mutually exclusive cohorts: asthma/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), depression, gastrointestinal (GI) disorders, osteoarthritis, or none of the 4 comorbidities. Proportions using antihypertensives in 2000 were assessed. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify the independent effects on antihypertensive use of the 4 comorbidities of interest, sociodemographic characteristics, other cardiovascular and noncardiovascular comorbidity, and health care utilization variables. After adjustments in multivariable analyses, antihypertensive use was consistently lower in patients with asthma/COPD (odds ratio [OR], 0.43; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.40 to 0.47), depression (OR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.45 to 0.55), GI disorders (OR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.54 to 0.64), and osteoarthritis (OR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.59 to 0.67) relative to those without these conditions. Reduced antihypertensive use was also associated with older age, female gender, white race, more severe other comorbidities, absence of some cardiovascular indications, hospitalizations, nursing home care, physician visits, and use of fewer other medications. Highly prevalent, noncardiovascular conditions appear to deter use of antihypertensives in elderly with hypertension."

Anxiety can have a negative impact on patients' quality of life and is sometimes even considered as a risk factor for re-hospitalisation. There are only a few studies that focus on disease related anxieties in COPD. The aim of our study was to investigate the associations between disease related anxieties (fear of progression, end-of-life fear), psychological health status and quality of life in COPD patients. 132 patients with COPD (GOLD II-IV) participated in the study. Results of a MANOVA showed no differences between diseases related anxieties among patients with different disease severity (GOLD II-IV). Furthermore, the results showed significant associations between end-of-life fear, fear of progression, depression and quality of life. Further analyses showed that there is a need for managing end-of-life fears and improving end-of-life care.

However, the relationship between COPD and subsequent bipolar disorder remains unclear. From January 1, 2000, we identified adult patients with COPD from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. A nationwide population-based study was conducted; 46,778 COPD patients and 46,778 age-, sex-, and comorbidity-matched subjects between 2000 and 2011 were enrolled. The two cohorts were followed up till December 31, 2011 and observed for occurrence of bipolar disorder. We observed the COPD and comparison cohorts for 263,020 and 267,895 person-years, respectively, from 2000 to 2011. The incidence rate for bipolar disorder was 1.6/1000 person-years in the COPD cohort and 1.2/1000 person-years in the comparison cohort ( p < 0.001). After multivariate adjustment, the hazard ratio (HR) for subsequent bipolar disorder among the COPD patients was 1.42 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.22-1.64; p < 0.001). In the COPD patients, short-acting beta-agonists (SABAs) was associated with a significantly increased risk of bipolar disorder development (HR = 1.83, 95% CI = 1.25-2.69, p = 0.002). Other COPD medications were not associated with the risk of bipolar disorder development. The study results indicate that COPD may be an independent risk factor for the development of bipolar disorder. The regular use of SABAs might increase the risk of bipolar disorder in COPD patients."

Six male subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, with a mean age of 64 years and a mean forced expiratory volume in 1 second that was 44% of predicted, completed the study. They were assessed for clinical signs and their level of dyspnea indicated on a vertical visual analogue scale, after which they completed the Spielberger State Anxiety Inventory and the Brief Symptom Inventory. Arterial blood was then drawn for blood gas analysis and determination of cortisol level. All measures were repeated twice, once when the subject reported a high level of dyspnea and once when he reported a low level. Analysis of the data by use of t tests for paired groups indicated that during times of high dyspnea levels subjects had greater anxiety, accessory muscle use, cortisol level, and PCO2 level. Subjects receiving oral prednisone had high depression levels that increased during times of severe dyspnea. Somatization, PO2, respiratory rate, depth of respiration, and other clinical signs did not change with dyspnea level. These results indicate that dyspnea is accompanied by both psychologic and physiologic changes that can be targeted to assist in alleviating this distressing symptom."

Patients underwent both medical and psychosocial assessments 6 months following transplantation, which included the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), Spielberger Anxiety Inventory, and General Health Questionnaire (GHQ). Over the course of follow-up, 80 (61%) participants died. Controlling for demographic factors, native lung disease, disease severity, family income, education level, social support, and frequency of posttransplant rejection, elevated symptoms of depression (BDI-II: HR = 1.31, p = 0.011) and distress (GHQ: HR = 1.28, p = 0.003) were associated with increased mortality.
