CD009372,0,8837803,0,Patients with polycystic kidney disease would benefit from routine magnetic resonance angiographic screening for intracerebral aneurysms: a decision analysis.,"Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is associated with increased prevalence of cerebral aneurysms and increased risk of subarachnoid hemorrhage. A decision analysis by Levey et al. in 1983 demonstrated that patients with ADPKD would not significantly benefit from routine arteriographic screening for cerebral aneurysms. We reexamined this conclusion in light of new clinical data and the introduction of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a screening method. We compared an MRI screening strategy with a nonscreening strategy. The screening strategy specified MRI screening and then neurosurgical management of detected aneurysms. The nonscreening strategy specified cerebrovascular care only in the event of subarachnoid hemorrhage. The decision tree incorporated estimates derived from the clinical literature for the prevalence of asymptomatic aneurysms in patients with ADPKD (15%), the annual incidence of aneurysmal rupture (1.6%), the morbidity and mortality rates associated with subarachnoid hemorrhage (70 and 56%, respectively), the risk of transfemoral arteriography (0.2%), the sensitivity and specificity of MRI, the morbidity and mortality rates associated with surgical treatment of an unruptured aneurysm (4.1 and 1.0%, respectively), and the life expectancy of patients with ADPKD. The model predicted that the screening strategy would provide 1.0 additional year of life without neurological disability to a 20-year-old patient with ADPKD. A sensitivity analysis showed that the model was most sensitive to estimates of the prevalence of aneurysms in ADPKD, the annual incidence of rupture, and the morbidity and mortality rates associated with rupture. A financial analysis showed that a screening strategy is likely to cost less than a nonscreening strategy. The model predicts that an MRI screening strategy would increase the life expectancy of young patients with ADPKD and reduce the financial impact on society of ADPKD."
CD009372,0,16832640,0,A fatal case of postpartum cerebral angiopathy with literature review.,"Postpartum cerebral angiopathy (PCA) is a rare and pathophysiologically ill-characterized cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome, occurring within 30 days of a usually uncomplicated pregnancy and delivery. Its onset has been associated with the use of vasoactive medications, particularly ergot alkaloids. Other cases have occurred in the absence of these medications, prompting conjecture into possible overlap between PCA and other conditions known to cause cerebral vasoconstriction, including primary angiitis of the central nervous system and postpartum eclampsia. The vast majority of cases follow a relatively benign course; however, a fatal case has been reported. Histopathologic findings in PCA, so far limited to the fatal case and two more recent biopsies, have been nonspecific."
CD009372,0,17163342,0,Clinical utility of multislice computed tomographic angiography for detection of cerebral vasospasm in acute subarachnoid hemorrhage.,"Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) has been used as the standard method for detecting cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Multislice computed tomographic angiography (CTA) is a relatively recent method used for evaluating the vasculature of the intracranial arteries. The purpose of this study was to compare multislice CTA and DSA for the detection and quantification of cerebral vasospasm after SAH, and to analyze the usefulness of multislice CTA. Eight patients with SAH underwent initial CTA with DSA within 72 hours after the onset of symptoms and follow-up multislice CTA and DSA 8 to 48 days after SAH. Five arterial locations were established in the A1 and A2 segments of the anterior cerebral artery, the M1 and M2 segments of the middle cerebral artery and the posterior cerebral artery (PCA) on both multislice CTA and DSA images. Vasospasm was classified as none, mild (up to 30% reduction in luminal diameter), moderate (31-60% reduction), and marked (at least 60% reduction) using the scale of Schneck and Kricheff. The multislice CT system used the following parameters: 1.25 mm collimation and 3.75 pitch with a 4-channel system. The degree of vasospasm revealed by the multislice CTA was significantly correlated with the degree of vasospasm revealed by DSA. In general, most discrepancies between CTA and DSA were in the detection of mild and moderate vasospasm. We found that the consistency between multislice CTA and DSA was greater for mild (100%, n=3) or moderate (100%, n=3) vasospasm than none (n=1) or marked vasospasm (n=1). However, it was unclear whether multislice CTA was more specific for a proximal location (A1, M1, PCA) or distal location (A2, M2) for evaluation of cerebral arteries. Multislice CTA can detect angiographic vasospasm after SAH with an accuracy similar to that of DSA. Multislice CTA is highly sensitive, specific and accurate in detecting mild and moderate cerebral vasospasm. It is less accurate for detecting no vasospasm and marked vasospasm. Therefore, the authors propose that multislice CTA be considered as a useful tool for the detection and management of intracranial vasospasm after SAH."
CD009372,0,16531206,0,Uncommon presentation of pediatric ruptured intracranial aneurysm after radiotherapy for retinoblastoma. Case report.,"Radiation-induced intracranial aneurysms are a rare entity with high mortality. Their pathogenesis is still in debate. Their unique anatomy and behavior should be considered when deciding the proper management. A background of radiation, uncommon anatomic aspects, age of presentation, and location guide us to suspect a radiation-induced etiology. We report the case of a pediatric patient with a ruptured intracranial aneurysm, who previously received radiation therapy to the orbits. We aim to contribute to the literature of this uncommon condition and stress the importance of its prompt diagnosis and treatment."
CD009372,0,9406201,0,False-negative angiograms in subarachnoid haemorrhage due to intracranial aneurysms.,"Of 440 patients with spontaneous subarachnoid haemorrhage in whom an aneurysm was suspected, 60 had a negative angiogram. A second angiogram performed 1-4 weeks later revealed an aneurysm in 5 of 40 cases. Of these patients, 3 had a second haemorrhage. In all cases, diffuse bleeding, with involvement of the anteroinferior interhemispheric fissure, was present on CT. There were three aneurysms of the anterior communicating artery and two of the carotid siphon. The reasons for the false-negative angiograms and the usefulness of repeated angiography are discussed."
CD009372,0,12075669,0,White and black blood volumetric angiographic filtering: ellipsoidal scale-space approach.,"Prefiltering is a critical step in three-dimensional (3-D) segmentation of the blood vessel and its display (see the recent book by Suri et al.). This paper presents a scale-space approach for filtering the white blood and black blood angiographic volumes and its implementation issues. The raw MR angiographic volume is first converted to isotropic volume followed by 3-D higher order separable Gaussian derivative convolution with known scales to generate edge volume. The edge volume is then run by the directional processor at each voxel where the eigenvalues of the 3-D ellipsoid are computed. The vessel score per voxel is then estimated based on these three eigenvalues which suppress the nonvasculature and background structures yielding the filtered volume. The filtered volume is ray-cast to generate the maximum intensity projection images for display. The performance of the system is evaluated by computing the mean, variance, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) images. The system is run over 20 patient studies from different areas of the body such as the brain, abdomen, kidney, knee, and ankle. The computer program takes around 150 s of processing time per study for a data size of 512 x 512 x 194, which includes the complete performance evaluation. We also compare our strategy with the recently published MR filtering algorithms by Alexander et al. and Sun et al."
CD009372,0,22197406,0,Perfusion-CT assessment of blood-brain barrier permeability in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.,The goal of this study was to determine which clinical and radiographic variables in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) are associated with in vivo blood-brain barrier permeability (BBBP) assessments obtained using perfusion-CT (PCT) technology.
CD009372,0,22005694,0,Bleeding source identification and treatment in brain arteriovenous malformations.,"Arteriovenous malformation (AVM) patients who initially present with intracerebral haemorrhage may have an identifiable source of bleeding on angiogram, which can be a treatment target. Previous work suggests that the re-bleed rate may be lowered if a weak area is eliminated.A retrospective cohort study was conducted on patients who presented over a six-year period with a bled AVM. Cases were reviewed looking for the source of the hemorrhage by correlating haematoma location on CT or MRI and any angio-architectural weakness seen on digital subtraction angiography (DSA). Neuroendovascular notes were reviewed to identify the treatment targets. One hundred patients presented with a brain AVM with a 1.7:1 male: female ratio, 41 patients had an initial presentation of hemorrhage. The source of hemorrhage was identified in 18 subjects with 11 intranidal false aneurysms, five flow-related aneurysms, two associated aneurysms and one venous pouch. The location of haemorrhage on the presenting scan significantly correlated with the identified bleeding source using Chi-square analysis (P-value 0.039). Partial targeted embolization was used successfully in 90% with a 9% related technical complication rate not resulting in long-term morbidity or mortality. The mean follow-up period was 34 months with an annual hemorrhage rate of 0.7%. In just under half the patients with AVM bleeding a source of haemorrhage can be identified on DSA and in most cases this will be an intranidal false aneurysm. Flow-related and associated aneurysms in patients with brain AVM can cause haemorrhage and these patients are more likely to have SAH than intracerebral haemorrhage.These weak points are a good target for partial endovascular treatment, are usually accessible and may reduce the higher haemorrhage rate expected over the next two years."
CD009372,0,3340283,0,Migraine stroke.,"Because the cause of stroke during migraine is not known, we studied 22 (17 females, 5 males; mean age, 32.7 years) classic migraine sufferers who had an ischemic stroke during an attack of migraine, with CT, Doppler ultrasound, cerebral angiography, and two-dimensional echocardiography. We found no cardiac or arterial lesion in 91% of the patients, as compared with 9% of age- and sex-matched migraineurs with stroke remote from a migraine attack and 18% of age- and sex-matched nonmigraineurs with stroke (p less than 0.00001). Mitral valve prolapse, arterial dissection, and vasospasm were not significant causes of stroke during migraine. These patients had longer previous attacks of migraine and their infarct was more frequently in the territory involved during the attacks than the controls, supporting the hypothesis that a prolongation of the migrainous process beyond usual limits may explain most migraine strokes."
CD009372,0,1198631,0,The value of brain scanning in the management of strokes.,"The usefulness of brain scanning in the diagnosis and management of strokes was evaluated in 313 serial cases. Of 38 patients with transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), only one had a positive test. The optimal time for scanning completed strokes was between seven and 14 days after onset. The pattern of uptake was characteristic of a vascular lesion in 76.8%. When uptake was indistinguishable from tumor, follow-up scans were useful. Patients with negative scans in the second week have a significantly better prognosis than the ones with a positive study. Cerebral angiography and brain scan correlated well in 56 patients who had both tests performed. The postmortem findings in 12 cases again emphasize the importance of the correct timing of the study, and the fact that a brain scan does not usually demonstrate lesions smaller than 2 cm in diameter. It is concluded that the brain scan represents a useful tool in the diagnosis of strokes and helps in predicting the degree of recovery following a vascular insult."
CD009372,0,11213959,0,High-field magnetic resonance imaging in patients with moyamoya disease.,The purpose of this study was to assess the utility of high-field magnetic resonance (MR) imaging as a quantitative tool for estimating cerebral circulation in patients with moyamoya disease.
CD009372,0,7575212,0,[Vascular stroke of the brain stem. Study of 21 cases].,"A prospective study was designed to follow patients with syndromes of brain stem during 12 months (in 1991-1992). The aim was to correlate clinical and radiologic findings and comparing them with the classical descriptions of brain stem syndromes. Twenty one consecutive patients were admitted at the Hospital de Base do Distrito Federal. The diagnosis and the follow up were carried out by neurological examination and neuroradiologic images: CT (100%), angiography (24%, 5) and MRI (5%, 1). Hypertension and old age were the most important risk factors and hemorrhage at pons with extension to midbrain was the most frequent finding. Coma at admission was associated to a poor outcome. The outcome was defined by the Glasgow Outcome Scale: 28% rated 5, 24% rated 4, 5% rated 3, 28% rated 2 and 14% rated 1. Our results show that the clinical presentation of ischemic strokes and hemorrhages of the brain stem very frequently follow a mixed pattern, which do not conciliate with the classical of these syndromes."

The more frequent clinical presentation was the intracranial bleeding.

CD009372,0,11935669,0,[Transcranial color-coded Doppler sonography: getting started].,"Transcranial color Doppler sonography, in contrary to conventional transcranial Doppler ultrasound, allows outlining of the parenchymal structures and visualization of the vessel examined. Angle-corrected blood velocities can be obtained which are closer to in-situ values. In this educational assay, we demonstrate cerebral vascular anatomy using 3-D MR angiographic images of the major cerebral arteries to show their relationship to neighboring structures, the acoustic window, and the ultrasound beam. We describe principles of the examination, and discuss the different types of physiological flow velocity spectra. We show how to identify with color Doppler ultrasonography the main intracranial arterial trunks, and how to avoid pitfalls caused by anatomic variability of their course and location. We draw attention on significant age and sex dependency of blood flow parameters which makes standardization of obtained transcranial Doppler results indispensable for clinical valuable concluding."
CD009372,0,9638675,0,Cerebellar arteriovenous malformations in children.,"We review the presentation, imaging findings and outcome in 18 children with cerebellar arteriovenous malformations (AVM). This group is of particular interest because of the reported poor outcome despite modern imaging and neurosurgical techniques. All children had CT and 15 underwent catheter angiography at presentation. Several of the children in the latter part of the study had MRI. Of the 18 children, 17 presented with a ruptured AVM producing intracranial haemorrhage. The remaining child presented with temporal lobe epilepsy and was shown to have temporal, vermian and cerebellar hemisphere AVM. This child had other stigmata of Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome. Three other children had pre-existing abnormalities of possible relevance. One had a vascular malformation of the cheek and mandible, one a documented chromosomal abnormality and another a midline cleft upper lip and palate. Six of the 17 children with a ruptured cerebellar AVM died within 7 days of the ictus. Vascular pathology other than an AVM was found in 10 of the 14 children with a ruptured cerebellar AVM who had angiography: 4 intranidal aneurysms, 5 venous aneurysms and 2 cases of venous outflow obstruction (one child having both an aneurysm and obstruction). The severity of clinical presentation was directly related to the size of the acute haematoma, which was a reasonable predictor of outcome."
CD009372,0,12710259,0,[Significance of magnetic resonance imaging in the diagnosis and surgical treatment in patients with intracranial arterial aneurysmal ruptures].,"In 123 patients with arterial aneurysms, brain MRI was performed in the routine and vascular modes. Ninety-five patients were hospitalized. Of them, 73 patients were operated on. Among the patients operated on, the diagnosis was verified and it corresponded to preoperative MRI diagnosis. In a group of patients who had died without being operated on, the diagnosis was verified at autopsy. In 11 cases, the diagnosis should be clarified by direct cerebral angiography. Analyzing MRI criteria that may be used to diagnose an aneurysm has indicated that the detection rate of some aneurysmal elements is not equal. The greatest problems arise in identifying the aneurysmal neck and carrying vessel, particularly in the presence of intracerebral hematoma that surrounds the aneurysm. The neck of aneurysm and its carrying artery could be visualized in 63 and 80% of cases, respectively. Nevertheless, aneurysmal clipping was successfully performed in 64 cases as shown by only MRI data. Aneurysmal MRI criteria were systematized, MRI signs being classified into direct and indirect and their rates presented. According to MRI, including MR angiography, the accuracy of diagnosis ranged from 61 to 88%. If there are no direct MRI signs of aneurysm, its preoperative diagnosis should be clarified by traditional cerebral serial angiography."

CD009372,0,7291875,0,[Our experience with rheoencephalography. Qualitative REG study of 1000 cases of verified chronic cerebrovascular insufficiency].,"After a detailed review of literature basic and clinical data on rheoencephalography (R.E.G.) the findings of 1000 patients suffering from verified brain blood supply impairment submitted to REG studies are exposed. Following parameters of REG curve have been analysed: sphygmic amplitude, sphygmic interrelations between two homologous brain regions; sphygmic speed, rise time, slope of REG curve, dicrotic incisure, random oscillations of catacrotic phase. A reduction in sphygmic speed has been observed in 70 % of cases, with changes in slope of REG curve in 90 % and reduction or disappearance of catacrotic dicrotism in 93.5 % and progressively less frequent changes in the remaining REG parameters. The obtained data have been submitted to statistical analysis. Significant associations have been observed between two or more pathological REG parameters and between the pathology of REG curve as a whole and the different invasive methods employed for assessing the cerebrovascular insufficiency such as CT, CBF studies and angiographic data. Not significant correlations between the focal REG pathology, and the focal changes of REG or of the invasive methods have been found. The systematic employment of REG study as a non invasive method for the screening of cerebral blood impairment is recommended."

Brain structural lesions may predispose a patient to bleeding. To date, aneurysm rupture has not been described as a complication of such therapy."
CD009372,0,3060062,0,[Treatment of acute cerebrovascular disorders].,"Recent advances in technology have improved stroke diagnosis, reduced the risks and increased the frequency of studies of stroke mechanism. Computer-assisted stroke data bank projects have provided new insights into the frequencies of stroke subtypes and the risks for progression and recurrence. A high frequency of strokes due to infarction remain unexplained despite thorough laboratory investigation. These infarcts of undetermined cause suffer recurrence rates almost as high as cardiogenic embolism, forcing a therapeutic decision even in the absence of a demonstrated cause. Stroke from atherosclerosis is far less common than formerly believed but carries the highest risk of worsening and early recurrence, prompting early treatment to attempt to avoid progression. Duplex and transcranial doppler methods of imaging blood vessels and insonating flow have now made it possible non-invasively to follow the course of atheromatous stenosis, embolism and recanalization, development of collateral flow, and vasospasm in ruptured aneurysms and arteriovenous malformations. Extracranial atheromatous disease may progress rapidly from mild to severe stenosis, stabilize at any point; intracranial collateral is not predicted by the degree of extracranial stenosis. Recanalization of cerebral embolism occurs early. Vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage is common and often severe. Where available, magnetic resonance imaging is preferred to CT scanning for the diagnosis of every form of stroke including hemorrhage."

CD009372,0,8584083,0,Surgical removal of giant basal ganglia arteriovenous malformations through the extended transsylvian approach following preoperative embolization--two case reports.,"A 12-year-old boy and a 22-year-old male presented with sudden onset of consciousness disturbance with right-sided hemiparesis and aphasia due to massive intracerebral hemorrhage from giant striocapsular arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Angiography revealed giant AVMs located at the left basal ganglia in both patients. Large frontotemporal craniotomies were performed following staged embolization of the feeding arteries. Through an extended transsylvian approach, the lesions were totally excised with confirmation using intraoperative digital subtraction angiography. The patients showed a transient postoperative worsening of symptoms, but recovered to their preoperative status at discharge. Motor functions of the right upper and lower extremities were graded 4/5 in both patients. These cases demonstrate that combined use of preoperative embolization and intraoperative angiography allows some giant deep AVMs to be resected with encouraging results."

Of the 320 arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) treated by Halbach over the past ten years, only five (1.6%) had a single arteriovenous connection. In the present study, a male infant developed focal seizure and intracranial hemorrhage without cardiac decompensation at the age of 42 days. When he was 3 years and 4 months old, status epileptics occurred, and AVF was discovered via CT scan and cerebral angiographic examination. The AVF was fed by a middle cerebral artery and drained into a huge cortical vein over the left parietooccipital area. Endovascular therapy and/or surgery were suggested, but the family refused. Though seizures occurred occasionally, the patient's consciousness level had become more clear, and he was discharged after three weeks' hospitalization. The patient was noted to be lethargic and only could roll over partially at the age of 3 year and 8 months, in the latest follow-up."

Computed tomography showed ICH mainly localized in the left putamen, but no evidence of SAH. Magnetic resonance angiography demonstrated a cerebral aneurysm originating from the bifurcation of the left internal carotid artery, which was considered to be responsible for the ICH. The patient underwent emergent intravascular surgery for coil embolization of the aneurysm, and his neurological symptoms gradually recovered with rehabilitation after surgery. Although ICH without SAH is a rare presentation of cerebral aneurysm, ruptured cerebral aneurysm should be considered as a potential cause of ICH. The localization and extent of ICH may be suggestive of latent cerebral aneurysm in such cases."

A 41-year-old male with a history of SLE starting in 1982 was admitted to our hospital in December 1989 because of headache and vertigo. Laboratory examinations on admission showed proteinuria, mild anemia, and positive antinuclear and anti-Sm antibodies. No abnormal findings except high pressure of 350 mmH2O were observed in his cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Fundoscopic examinations showed marked bilateral papilledema and retinal bleeding. Brain CT, MRI and angiography revealed diffuse brain edema without space occupying lesion and cerebrovascular diseases. Because there were no diseases such as endocrinological disorders, severe anemia, and no history of the administration of drugs which might cause intracranial hypertension, the diagnosis of BIH was made. Subsequently, he was treated with intravenous methylprednisolone therapy and osmotic diuretics and his clinical symptoms and pressure of CSF gradually improved. The decrease of CSF adsorption was observed with RI cisternography in our case. Psychosis, seizures and meningitis are common CNS manifestations in SLE patients.

Computed tomographic scans revealed a diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage with thick hematoma of the left ambient cistern. Cerebral angiogram did not show any aneurysm. On the 7th day after admission, 3D-CT angiogram showed an aneurysm of the left posterior cerebral artery. On the 14th day, axial and coronal magnetic resonance images showed the aneurysm, surrounding structures and the choroidal fissure. On the 26th day after admission, successful neck clipping was performed through the temporal horn via the inferior temporal gyrus. The postoperative course was uneventful except for transient aphasia. This approach may be preferable in such cases, because it protects the brain from the detrimental effects of strong temporal retraction and provides a wider working space. In our case, thin slice MRI and MRA showing the aneurysm in the ambient cistern and the choroidal fissure were useful for deciding the appropriate approach."
CD009372,0,9340684,0,[Indications for contrast medium administration in MR-angiography of cerebral blood vessels].,"Time-of-flight MR-angiography of large volumes is limited by the occurrence of saturation effects, which lead to low signal in both veins and arteries. Alternatively to a number of other MRA-techniques, intravenous application of paramagnetic contrast media in combination with 3D-pulse sequences with or without flow refocussing allows the depiction of slow vessels in large volumes without technical extra expenses. The main intracranial indication is anatomical 3D-imaging of normal and dysplastic cerebral veins with high spatial resolution, and the additional depiction of the venous drainage in AVMs, when unenhanced MRA shows only the arteriel supply and the nidus. In large cerebral aneurysms, bridging veins and venous sinuses, partial thromboses can easily be differentiated from slow flow. Contrast-enhancing tumors can be depicted together with normal or displaced vessels. Improvements of arterial signal due to contrast media with currently used routine MRA techniques are clinically not significant. Signal loss due to spin dephasing in vessels with complex flow is not influences by contrast media. Results of contrast-enhanced MRA are determined by the timing of injection. Since arteries and veins are both imaged with high signal intensity, improvements of postprocessing procedures for secondary vessel segmentation are necessary."

The diagnosis of the hemispherical localisation, on the basis of clinical data established, have been confirmed by instrumental exams (EEG, CAT, Angiography). A clear difference in the results between the two groups of patients does not appear except in specific tests related to memory selective types, in which the sensitive modality of tests administration seems to be more closely in relation with the damaged hemispherical functions. Ribot's law on the longer life of old memories has not been confirmed by the long term memory tests in cerebral damaged patients."

Four years earlier, digital subtraction angiography had disclosed a DAVF at the right anterior cranial fossa fed mainly by the ethmoidal branches of the bilateral sphenopalatine arteries and slightly by the ethmoidal arteries of the bilateral ophthalmic arteries, and drained primarily by the sphenoparietal and cavernous sinuses via two dilated cortical veins and slightly by the superior sagittal sinus via a frontal ascending vein. Three-dimensional computed tomography angiography revealed the development of a venous aneurysm on the main draining vein over a 4-year period, but no other changes. Venous aneurysm development may be part of the natural history of DAVF with cortical venous drainage and may contribute to the occurrence of ICH."

CD009372,0,11552375,0,[The vascular patient--diagnosis and minimally invasive therapy. Which technique for what illness?].,"The non-invasive imaging modalities, color coded duplex sonography (CCDS), magnetic resonance tomography (MRT), and computed tomography (CT), have pushed conventional angiography out of most diagnostic fields. The experienced user will achieve fast, reliable answers with CCDS in dedicated clinical settings. MRT as well as CT are concurring imaging modalities for the most appropriate diagnostic answer. Not only pure image quality, but also patient management, and availability play a major role. Catheter based angiography will in the future still play a role in mesenteric ischemia (non occlusive disease) and for imaging of very small vessel pathology, e.g. on panarteritis nodosa. At the moment, peripheral leg run-offs are still best performed with conventional angiography, nevertheless, MR as well as CT seem to have the ability to perform diagnostic procedures. Ongoing studies will allow a solid judgement in the near future. The true value of catheter angiography is in the direct assessment, planning, and performance of interventional procedures, e.g. catheter based obliteration or revascularization. Implantation of stent devices and a whole range of different mechanical and pharmacological revascularization procedures have improved the interventional management of vascular stenoses and occlusions. The interventional radiologist is treating physician in the classical sense in this setting. Acute bleeding episodes, e.g. in the brain, thorax, abdomen, or pelvis, are best imaged with computed tomography. Conventional angiography still plays a major diagnostic and therapeutic role in bleeding into preformed cavities, such as the bile ducts or the intestine. In this setting, all available information including CT scans should be valued. For complex therapeutic regimens in oncology or in pure palliative situations, angiographic diagnosis followed by embolization and/or ablation therapy is established."
CD009372,0,3120528,0,Nontraumatic lobar intracerebral hemorrhage: CT/angiographic correlation.,"Cerebral angiography in patients with nontraumatic lobar intracerebral hemorrhage may or may not uncover the underlying cause of the disorder. The CT and cerebral angiographic studies of 67 consecutive patients with nontraumatic lobar intracerebral hemorrhage were reviewed to assess the relationship between CT pattern and location of hemorrhage and the frequency of diagnostic angiographic findings. Origins of these hematomas were also determined and correlated with radiographic findings. CT revealed 26 temporal, 18 frontal, 17 parietal, three occipital, and three multiple lobar hematomas. Thirty-three patients had ""pure"" lobar hematomas, 12 had coexistent intraventricular hemorrhage, 12 had associated subarachnoid hemorrhage, and 10 had both intraventricular and subarachnoid hemorrhage accompanying their lobar hematomas. Angiographic findings were diagnostic in 29 cases (43%). In the presence of accompanying subarachnoid hemorrhage, angiographic findings were diagnostic in 17 (77%) of 22 patients; in its absence, angiography was diagnostic in 12 (27%) of the remaining 45 patients. Diagnostic angiograms were also more frequent in the presence of a frontal or temporal lobar hematoma than with a parietal or occipital lobar hematoma. While CT patterns do influence the frequency of diagnostic angiographic findings, cerebral angiography is recommended in all patients with otherwise unexplained nontraumatic lobar intracerebral hemorrhage."

Early neurological assessment and timely thrombolysis might improve outcome. BAT is difficult to diagnose due to wide spectrum of presentation and decreased conscious level. Emergency physicians often intubate BAT patients with airway compromise before arrival of stroke neurologist. We evaluated role of computerized tomography (CT) angiography (CTA) of brain and cervical arteries in early diagnosis of acute BAT in intubated patients and facilitating decision for thrombolysis.
CD009372,0,2615899,0,[Barbiturate therapy in traumatic cerebral vascular disease: report of two cases].,"We report two cases of traumatic cerebral vascular disease which were treated successfully with barbiturate. The first case sustained blunt trauma to the bilateral vertebral arteries, resulting in complete occlusion of both arteries. After ligation of the injured vertebral arteries, multiple cerebral infarction appeared. Cerebral angiography revealed dissection and stenosis of the bilateral internal carotid arteries. We treated this case with barbiturate (Thiamylal) in combination with administration of heparin. The second case sustained cerebral contusion and traumatic subarachnoidal hemorrhage as a result of a motor cycle accident. This patient deteriorated and cerebral angiography showed diffuse cerebral arterial vasospasms. When this was treated with induced hypertension, he developed recurrent subarachnoid hemorrhage. In order to protect the brain from ischemia without elevating blood pressure, we employed barbiturate therapy and the patient recovered without major neurological deficit. The condition of severe head injury with cerebral ischemia is complicated. Therefore it has been hard for neurosurgeons to cure the patient with this condition. But we treated it with barbiturate successfully. Barbiturate therapy in severe head injury with cerebral ischemia may decrease the mortality in that group of patients considered difficult to treat with the usual therapeutic modalities."

Here, we compared combined territorial ASL (TASL) and MR angiography (MRA) against DSA in the assessment of collateral circulation."
CD009372,0,10745267,0,MR angiographic diagnosis of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis following allogeneic bone marrow transplantation.,"Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation is frequently associated with neurological complications, particularly intracerebral bleeds and infections. Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis has only rarely been reported following allogeneic transplants. We report three cases of cortical venous thrombosis following allografting for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Two patients received marrow from HLA-identical siblings and one from an unrelated donor. Two of the patients presented with grand mal seizures and one presented with a headache. No neurological abnormalities were found upon clinical examination and lumbar puncture was normal in all three cases. In two of the patients computed tomography (CT) of the brain was normal and in the third showed non-specific abnormalities. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with MR angiography (MRA) demonstrated cerebral venous sinus thrombosis in all three patients. In conclusion, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis when neurological symptoms occur following allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. We therefore advocate the use of MRA for unexplained neurological symptoms post-allograft since without it cerebral venous sinus thrombosis may easily be missed."
CD009372,0,8161486,0,Selected indications for and applications of magnetic resonance angiography in children.,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy and practicality of magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) in evaluating pediatric cerebrovascular disorders. A retrospective evaluation was performed of MR angiograms in 20 pediatric patients with cerebrovascular pathology. When appropriate, comparisons were made with duplex ultrasonography or conventional catheter angiography. MRA accurately assessed the patency of carotid reanastomoses in 8 babies who had previously undergone extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). In 6 patients with moyamoya syndrome, MRA accurately evaluated stenotic intracranial carotid and circle of Willis arteries and progressive enlargement of the superficial temporal and middle cerebral arteries after revascularization procedures, and thus obviated the need for sequential angiograms. Thrombi and emboli were identified in 4 of 5 patients with symptoms and imaging evidence of an acute stroke. Two-dimensional time-of-flight MR venograms, acquired in both axial and coronal planes, were useful for preoperative venous mapping in a patient with an occipital encephalocele and detecting venoocclusive disease. MRA provided diagnostically useful information in a spectrum of pediatric cerebrovascular disorders. It can be used as the initial vascular imaging modality for patients with imaging evidence of acute cerebrovascular event, to evaluate progression of chronic vasoocclusive disease, to evaluate vessel patency following intracranial revascularization surgery, and for visualization of the venous circulation."

CD009372,0,15545944,0,[Emergency imaging of cerebrovascular accidents].,"Over the last 25 years, advances in neuroimaging have significantly changed the evaluation and management of acute stroke syndromes. In the seventies, computed tomography (CT) could differentiate between ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is nowadays the imaging modality of choice in the initial assessment of acute stroke. MRI images can better discriminate acute, subacute and chronic infarcts, differentiate venous from arterial infarcts, detect arterial dissection, stenosis or occlusion. Diffusion-weighted images are highly sensitive and specific to acute infarction and the combination with perfusion technique is suitable to define potentially reversible ischemia (area of cerebral ""mismatch"" which is thought to represent the so-called ischemic penumbra). This penumbra is a potential therapeutic target of valuable interest for the treating physician."

Signal intensity and blood-background contrast was measured in several regions of interest on conventional 3D TOF MR images, MTC images, and those with MTC and FS in seven volunteers. One patient each with an arteriovenous malformation, an aneurysm, and stenosis in the intracranial vascular system underwent the protocols with an echo time (TE) of 5 msec and then a TE of 8 msec. Use of the 5-msec-TE sequence with MTC and FS led to reduced problems associated with signal void in areas of fast flow in patients. In volunteers and patients, vascular visualization was superior to that of current 3D TOF techniques."

These cases represented 2.1% of intracerebral hemorrhage cases at Neurological Institute, Veterans General Hospital-Taipei, Taiwan. Cerebral angiography was performed on eight patients. Six patients were evaluated by an extensive neuropsychological battery. The most frequent symptoms of caudate hemorrhage were headache and/or vomiting, and decreased consciousness. Clinical features were similar to those of subarachnoid hemorrhage. Angiography showed characteristic moyamoya disease in one patient but did not show an aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation in any patient. The etiology in most patients was hypertension. Neuropsychological assessments showed significant impairment in tasks of short-term and long-term memory and in verbal fluency as well as trends of impairment of orientation rather than of controls. Neurobehavioral symptoms probably resulted from interruption of the cortical-subcortical loops between the caudate nucleus and prefrontal cortex."

CT scans showed low density areas on the bilateral parieto-occipital lobes. CAG showed diffuse narrowing of the cerebral arteries. Laboratory examinations showed an albumino-cytologic dissociation (cells; 21/3mm, prot.; 78 mg/dl) of the cerebrospinal fluid and increased levels of norepinephrine (214 micrograms/day) and epinephrine (16.1 micrograms/day) in the urine. Motor nerve conduction velocities of the median nerves was 42.8 m/sec in the right and 50.0 m/sec in the left. The autonomic function tests revealed hyper-responsiveness to 10 mg of phentolamine and low baroreflex sensitivity. Within 2 months, most symptoms improved.

CD009372,0,8208357,0,Antiphospholipid antibodies in cerebrovascular ischemia and stroke in childhood.,"We report on eight children who suffered from cerebrovascular ischemia or stroke at the age of 2 or up to 11 years. Antiphospholipid antibodies (APLA) were detected in two cases during the ischemic event and in six cases during follow-up examinations (after six weeks or within a span of six years). In two patients multiple stenoses of basal cerebral arteries were found; one of them suffered from moyamoya syndrome. The acute hemiplegia in one patient was linked to an asymptomatic mycoplasmal infection and APLA. In three cases, one of the parents was also APLA-positive. Seven patients were treated with acetylsalicylic acid, and in four cases immunoglobulin infusions were given. Transient ischemic attacks subsided after the child with the moyamoya syndrome received immunoglobulins. No effect of medication could be established in the other children. The concept of the antiphospholipid syndrome is still evolving. As none of the common risk factors pertaining to strokes in adults apply to children, pediatric research may offer a suitable platform for specific investigations on the causal, pathogenetic role of APLA. We propose that all children suffering from stroke or transient ischemic attacks should be tested for APLA."

CD009372,0,1362250,1,Application of magnetic resonance angiography to neurosurgical practice: a critical review of 150 cases.,"The potential role of magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) in clinical neurosurgical practice was evaluated in 150 consecutive patients in an attempt to define clinical situations in which it aided in diagnosis, helped guide treatment options, and/or possibly eliminated the need for conventional catheter angiography. Among patients with nonvascular pathology (n = 42), MRA provided useful clinical information in 55% of cases, and could have effectively replaced catheter angiography in 76% of cases. In this group of patients, MRA provided excellent depiction of tumour and vessel relationships, and in conjunction with conventional imaging modalities reliably ruled out the question of tumour versus aneurysm whenever that question was raised. Among patients with vascular lesions (n = 108), MRA visualized the lesion in 18 of 20 (90%) aneurysms, 11 of 11 (100%) vascular malformations, 31 or 31 (100%) cases with known occlusive vascular disease, and reliably excluded occlusive vascular disease in 19 of 30 (63%) cases. The MRA potentially could have replaced conventional catheter angiography in less than 8% of cases with vascular pathology treated surgically, and in 76% of cases with vascular pathology treated medically or expectantly. Imaging time was relatively short, 10 to 20 minutes for intracranial vessels and 6.5 to 13 minutes for extracranial vessels. Shortcomings included the lack of spacial resolution required for surgical planning and the possible misleading information in the settings of low flow and partial thrombosis. It is concluded that currently available MRA modalities contribute useful information in a wide spectrum of neurosurgical clinical situations including screening and serial follow-up.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

CD009372,0,21402376,0,Cross-sectional imaging for diagnosis and clinical outcome prediction of acute basilar artery thrombosis.,"Basilar artery occlusion is a potentially fatal condition and imaging findings can be subtle. Prompt diagnosis is vital, as recognition may lead to therapeutic recanalization that may improve functional outcome and survival. Furthermore, cross-sectional imaging signs may help predict eventual outcome and, therefore, guide which patients should be subjected to aggressive treatment. Computed tomography (CT) signs include a hyperdense basilar artery that has a high specificity, accuracy, positive and negative predictive value. Evidence regarding the prognostic significance of the hyperdense basilar artery sign is conflicting. Early magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features include loss of flow void, seen as increased signal intensity within the basilar artery on T2-weigted images and identification of acute thrombus, seen as intermediate signal on T1-weighted images. MRI sequences are more sensitive for early detection of acute ischaemia or infarction, ideally with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). Both CT and MR angiography are sensitive for detection of acute thrombus, seen as a filling defect or occlusion. These are the non-invasive imaging techniques of choice to confirm diagnosis, with perhaps the speed and accessibility of CT angiography resulting in this technique being valuable in the acute setting. Several new scoring systems based on arterial segmentation rather than global volume assessment using CT angiography source images and DWI have shown early promise in the prediction of eventual clinical outcome in order to isolate those patients who may benefit from therapeutic recanalization."

A total of 47 consecutive patients with sickle cell disease (28 females, 19 males; age range 8 months to 29 years, mean age 9 years 6 months) were evaluated by transcranial color and duplex Doppler ultrasonography via transtemporal and occipital (2-MHz probe) as well as by transocular (5-MHz probe) approach. Eleven vessels (middle, posterior, anterior cerebral artery, vertebral artery, ophthalmic artery on each side and basilar artery) were analyzed in each patient. Following nine transcranial Doppler findings predictive for cerebrovascular disease, patients with one or more of those abnormal sonographic findings underwent MR imaging and MR angiography. In 8 patients with abnormal transcranial Doppler the MR angiography was normal. Thirty-one patients demonstrated normal results. In 15 of 16 patients with one or more abnormal Doppler findings (34% of all studied patients) MR imaging and MR angiography were performed. The MR angiography disclosed cerebrovascular stenosis in 7 patients (15% of all patients, 44% of those with pathological transcranial Doppler findings). In one of those patients MR imaging revealed silent peripheral ischemic infarction as well. Our findings indicate the usefulness of transcranial Doppler ultrasonography to reveal occult cerebrovascular lesions in neurologically asymptomatic patients with sickle cell disease. It should regularly be performed in all sickle cell patients in order to detect patients at risk for later stroke. Patients with homozygous disease and a high frequency of preceding sickle cell crises should be followed most closely."
CD009372,0,23124634,1,Emergency noninvasive angiography for acute intracerebral hemorrhage.,"Spontaneous ICH is a devastating condition and is associated with significant mortality in the acute phase due to ongoing hemorrhage and hematoma expansion. A growing body of evidence suggests that there may be considerable utility in performing noninvasive vascular imaging during the acute-to-early phase of ICH. CTA has become widely available and is sensitive and specific for detecting vascular causes of secondary ICH such as aneurysms, arteriovenous malformations, dural arteriovenous fistulas, intracranial dissections, and neoplasm. CT venography can also diagnose dural sinus thrombosis presenting as hemorrhagic infarction. Recent data from stroke populations demonstrate a relatively low risk to patients when contrast is administered in the absence of a known serum creatinine. Detection of acute contrast extravasation within the hematoma (""spot sign"") with CT angiography is predictive of subsequent hematoma expansion and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Risk stratification based on acute CTA can inform and expedite decision-making regarding intensive care unit admission, blood pressure control, correction of coagulopathy, and neurosurgical consultation. Noninvasive vascular imaging should be considered as an important component of the initial diagnostic work-up for patients presenting with acute ICH."

CD009372,0,11684714,0,ACP Best Practice No 166: CSF spectrophotometry in the diagnosis of subarachnoid haemorrhage.,"After subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH), cerebral angiography is usually performed to establish a site of bleeding, which may then be treated surgically to prevent a potentially catastrophic re-bleed. The investigation of choice in the diagnosis of SAH is computerised tomography (CT). However, because CT can miss some patients with SAH, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) spectrophotometry should be performed in those patients with negative or equivocal CT scans or those who have presented several days after the suspected bleed. Spectrophotometry should aim to detect the presence of both oxyhaemoglobin and bilirubin because either one or both of these pigments may contribute to xanthochromia following SAH. CSF supernatant is scanned using a double beam spectrophotometer at wavelengths between 350 nm and 650 nm. Oxyhaemoglobin alone produces an absorption peak at 413-415 nm, bilirubin alone produces a broad peak at 450-460 nm, and bilirubin together with oxyhaemoglobin produce a shoulder at 450-460 nm on the downslope of the oxyhaemoglobin peak. To minimise the frequency of false positive and false negative results, a protocol has been developed, which is described."

In the present study, we evaluated the efficacy of superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery (STA-MCA) anastomosis combined with encephalo-duro-myo-synangiosis (EDMS) in the treatment of non-moyamoya steno-occlusive cerebrovascular disease by retrospectively reviewing clinical and radiological data from 66 patients treated between January 2006 and April 2011. Forty-six double STA-MCA anastomoses and 20 single anastomoses were completed, and all remained patent in the perioperative phase, as confirmed by CT angiography. Postoperative CT perfusion imaging demonstrated immediate improvement in perfusion in the revascularized hemisphere. On discharge, 50 of the 66 patients (75.8%) had an improved National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score relative to preoperative values. After at least 6 months of follow-up, 54 (88.5%) patients had improved NIHSS scores relative to discharge values. CT perfusion imaging showed significant improvement compared to post-operative images. Follow-up digital subtraction angiography confirmed that 95 of 96 (99%) anastomoses remained patent. There was no significant difference between the single and double bypasses in terms of either clinical or hemodynamic outcomes on the revascularized side. STA-MCA combined with EDMS was effective for the treatment of non-moyamoya steno-occlusive cerebrovascular disease with hemodynamic impairment. Hemodynamic evaluation before and after surgery may help identify patients in need of a bypass and may be useful for predicting outcome."

CD009372,0,2054196,0,Magnetic resonance angiography of the intracranial vasculature.,"Preliminary experience has shown that MRA can provide useful clinical information that complements the more traditional SE brain evaluation of patients with cerebrovascular disease. MRA is particularly appealing in that it provides a relatively rapid, noninvasive alternative to the existing vascular imaging modalities and the capability to evaluate the brain parenchyma directly. This can often be done without repositioning the patient or significantly prolonging the examination time. MRA sequences have been applied in the evaluation of patients with intracranial aneurysms, vascular malformations, vasoocclusive disease, neoplasms, and dural sinus thrombosis. The MRA study design and acquisition parameters are crucial and need to be optimized to maximize sensitivity and specificity of the examination based on the individual clinical presentation. The results of the SE and MRA studies should be evaluated together to obtain a definitive diagnosis or to determine whether conventional angiography is needed. As with any other diagnostic procedure, it is important to recognize the strengths and limitations of these techniques. Despite its advantages, MRA will not replace conventional catheter angiography in the near future. Rather, it will complement existing indications for conventional MR studies. Spatial resolution and intravascular signal loss due to rapid, complex flow continue to be the most limiting factors in intracranial MRA imaging. Significant improvements in these areas are currently being realized."

X ray CT demonstrated a severe hemorrhagic infarction in right MCA territory accompanying marked shift of midline structures. Cerebral angiograms represented occlusion of right MCA showing floating emboli in the internal carotid. Hematocrit value was found to be high as 61.2 per cent. Elevated ICP levels were noted by means of epidural pressure monitoring. Deterioration of patient status was considered to be based on impairment of cerebral circulation due to hemostasis by elevated blood viscosity. In addition to administration of mannitol solution, intermittent exsanguinations, 1000 ml in total amount, were performed and hematocrit levels were corrected by hemodilution.

CD009372,0,1950901,0,Stroke associated with coronary artery bypass surgery.,"Medical records and neuroimaging studies of 30 patients with major neurologic events after coronary artery surgery were reviewed. Two thousand and twenty-nine coronary artery bypass graft operations were performed in our institution between October 15, 1985, and December 27, 1989. Of these, there were 30 documented neurologic events suggesting acute ischemic injury during the intraoperative or the postoperative period. Clinical manifestations included hemiparesis, monoparesis, aphasia, bilateral cortical dysfunction, cortical and brainstem dysfunction, and left homonymous hemianopsia. There were five deaths directly attributable to neurologic injury. Twenty-two patients had a CT scan of the head, of which 15 showed evidence of acute infarction, two suggested watershed lesions from cerebral hypoperfusion, and the remainder showed findings consistent with multiple cerebral emboli or primary intracranial occlusion. Five carotid arteriograms and one digital subtraction arteriogram of the carotids were obtained. Angiographic findings revealed two common carotid artery occlusions, one callosal marginal artery occlusion, and two cases of bilateral high-grade internal carotid stenoses. Our findings support the contention that in patients who suffer cerebral infarction associated with coronary artery bypass grafting, the main mechanism of injury is cerebral embolization rather than cerebral hypoperfusion."

CD009372,0,19194687,0,[Neuroimaging evaluation of intracerebral hemorrhage].,"Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is responsible for 10-15% of all strokes. Standard evaluation includes a CT examination, in which ICH is initially hyperdense but gradually decreases in density over days to weeks. In emergency situations, native CT can be supplemented with CT angiography, which reliably shows aneurysms and other vascular abnormalities larger than 2-3 mm. For detecting ICH in hyperacute situations, MRI is as sensitive as CT but signal characteristics are more complex, strongly depending on the oxygenation status of hemoglobin and the redox status of iron. In terms of localization, deep ICH in typical locations with hypertensive etiology is differentiated from atypical lobar ICH. Atypical ICH in elderly patients is often caused by cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Despite advances in noninvasive imaging techniques, today most atypical ICH patients still require digital subtraction angiography for a complete evaluation. In contrast, hypertensive ICH can be assumed in patients with known arterial hyperstension and ICH in a typical location."

The patient presented with aphasia, confusion, headaches, nausea, right hemianopia and early papilledema. CT revealed an intracerebral hematoma in the left occipital lobe but MRI and MRA failed to provide any further insight into the etiology of the hemorrhage. Due to persisting intracranial hypertension, the patient underwent neuroendoscopic removal of the hematoma. After blood clots were evacuated, pathologic vascularity was found. Tissue samples were collected from the walls of the hematoma cavity. Neoplastic cells adjacent to the blood vessels were identified in one of the samples. The patient was reoperated and a glioma-like tumor was removed. The diagnosis of cerebral intratumoral hemorrhage is difficult especially when there are no previous clinical signs of a tumor. Neuroendoscopy may speed up the diagnostic process which usually extends past resorption of the haematoma and the technique may be an alternative to stereotactic surgery."

Evidence is now rapidly accumulating that both diffusion- and perfusion-weighted imaging, particularly when used in combination with high-speed MR angiography, will lead to improvements in the clinical management of acute stroke patients. Other novel MR techniques, such as spectroscopic imaging, diffusion tensor imaging, and blood oxygenation level-dependent functional MRI, have not yet assumed a definitive role in the diagnostic evaluation of cerebrovascular disease.

Characteristics of the malformations on MR images were reviewed retrospectively, and a comparative evaluation of MR and CT images was made. Of 14 angiographically evident malformations, 13 intra-axial lesions were detected on both CT and MR images, and one dural malformation gave false-negative results on both modalities. The appearance of parenchymal lesions on MR images closely mirrored characteristic CT findings. Calcific foci were difficult to separate from vessels on both images. Clot was more easily identified on MR images. In the detection of 15 angiographically occult malformations, CT proved more sensitive when focal calcification was the only evidence of their presence. MR study failed to detect two small supratentorial lesions evidenced by faint calcifications on CT scans. In two patients, MR images showed small hemorrhages not detectable by CT, and MR provided strong evidence for the diagnosis of hematoma for 12 lesions. Angiographically evident malformations have a highly characteristic appearance on MR images. MR may be more sensitive than CT in the detection of small hemorrhagic foci associated with cryptic arteriovenous malformations and may add specificity in the diagnosis of occult malformations in some cases, but MR is less sensitive than CT for the detection of small calcified malformations."

Imaging plays a critical role in the selection of patients for CAS. Duplex ultrasonography alone is insufficient to assess patients for CAS suitability. Advancements in computed tomography angiography (CTA) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) techniques are helping to identify lesions vulnerable to cerebral embolization during carotid interventions - a more prevalent event during CAS in comparison to CEA.

CD009372,0,15588953,0,Intracranial collateral pathways assessed by contrast-enhanced three-dimensional transcranial color-coded sonography.,"Individual parameter settings of the duplex machine and limited insonation angles may influence the visualization of small intracranial vessels in 2-D transcranial color-coded sonography. The aim of our study was the morphologic assessment of intracranial collateral pathways (first auditory area celiac artery, A(1)CA; anterior communicating artery, AComA; first parental generation celiac artery P(1)CA; posterior communicating artery, PComA) using 3-D transcranial color-coded duplex sonography (3-D TCCS) and digital subtraction angiography (DSA). A total of 41 patients with large vessel disease and 30 patients who had suffered subarachnoidal hemorrhage (mean age 52 +/- 15 years) were involved. In all patients, angiography was performed within 10 days following 3-D sonography. The patients were investigated with a color-coded duplex system using the power mode. Contrast enhancement was achieved by continuous infusion of a galactose-based echo-enhancer using a perfusor pump. The 3-D system consists of an electromagnet that induces a low-intensity magnetic field near the head of the patient. A magnetic position sensor is attached to the ultrasound (US) probe and transmits the spatial orientation to a personal computer, which also receives the corresponding 2-D images from the video port of the duplex machine. Angiography revealed a ""complete"" circle of Willis in one third of the patients and, in the remaining patients at least one vessel was hypoplastic or absent. Sufficient temporal bone windows allowed the sonographic investigation of 466 (94%) of 497 expected arterial segments. The comparison of both techniques resulted in a weighted kappa value of 0.56 for the A(1)CA and 0.63 for the AComA. In the posterior circulation kappa values of 0.56 for the P(1)CA and 0.43 for the PComA were calculated. In 50 vessels (10%), 3-D sonography misdiagnosed the diameter of a collateral vessel as normal and angiography revealed hypoplasia or aplasia of this vessel. The main advantage of 3-D TCCS is that it enables the investigator to reconstruct virtually any arbitrary view angle. Compared with angiography or magnetic resonance (MR) angiography, 3-D sonography can be performed easily in critically ill patients on stroke units or intensive care units. The noninvasive assessment of the circle of Willis may be useful in patients who undergo carotid surgery without angiography. Combined with hemodynamic information, contrast-enhanced 3-D TCCS might increase the diagnostic impact of transcranial US."

Physiologic imaging with MR perfusion weighted imaging has joined MR diffusion imaging as an essential components of stroke and brain tumor MRI. At the same time, the volume scanning revolution in CT technology has dramatically decreased the radiation doses required for CT perfusion imaging by allowing routine simultaneous CT perfusion and noninvasive dynamic bone subtracted CT angiography (CTA) without a significant increase in radiation dose over conventional head CT-CTA alone. Although ongoing research and clinical trials is needed to define more precisely how these techniques can best be exploited to improve clinical care and patient outcomes, in the acute stroke and subarachnoid hemorrhage populations the radiation risk associated with CT perfusion imaging is negligible and the physiologic information promises significant patient safety benefits."

CD009372,0,11901239,0,Imaging of white matter lesions.,"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is very sensitive for the detection of white matter lesions (WML), which occur even in normal ageing. Intrinsic WML should be separated from physiological changes in the ageing brain, such as periventricular caps and bands, and from dilated Virchow-Robin spaces. Genuine WML are best seen with T2-weighted sequences such as long TR dual-echo spin-echo or FLAIR (fluid-attenuated inversion recovery); the latter has the advantage of easily separating WML from CSF-like lesions. Abnormal T2 signal in MRI is not specific, and can accompany any change in tissue composition. In the work-up of WML in small vessel disease, magnetic resonance angiography can be used to rule out (concomitant) large vessel disease, and diffusion-weighted MRI to identify new ischaemic lesions (amidst pre-existing old WML). The differential diagnosis of WML includes hereditary leukodystrophies and acquired disorders. The leukodystrophies that can present in adult age include metachromatic leukodystrophy, globoid cell leukodystrophy, adrenomyeloneuropathy, mitochondrial disorders, vanishing white matter, and cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis. These metabolic disorders typically present with symmetrical abnormalities that can be very diffuse, often with involvement of brainstem and cerebellum. Only the mitochondrial disorders tend to be more asymmetric and frequently involve the grey matter preferentially. Among the acquired white matter disorders, hypoxic-ischaemic causes are by far the most prevalent and without further clinical clues there is no need to even consider the next most common disorder, i.e. multiple sclerosis (MS). Among the nonischaemic disorders, MS is far more common than vasculitis, infection, intoxication and trauma. While vasculitis can mimic small vessel disease, MS has distinctive features with preferential involvement of the subcortical U-fibres, the corpus callosum, temporal lobes and the brainstem/cerebellum. Spinal cord lesions are very common in MS, but do not occur in normal ageing nor in small vessel disease."

Psychiatric symptoms initially overshadowed the subacute features of the progressive neurologic disorder. Ophthalmoscopic findings of multifocal branch retinal artery occlusions provided clinical evidence of vasculopathy. Laboratory data did not reveal evidence of the known vasculitides, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and syphilis. Cerebral angiography suggested vasculitis in the younger patient. Brain biopsy in the older patient (after 3 months of steroid therapy) revealed a sclerosis of the small pial and cortical vessels that was consistent with a ""healed"" angitis. Both patients seemed to respond to steroid therapy."

A 59-year-old woman, who had been diagnosed as having a huge AVM in the left occipital lobe 6 years before and who was monitored without treatment, complained of a sudden headache and vomiting. Computed tomography revealed an acute subdural hematoma, intracerebral hematoma, and subarachnoid hemorrhage, for which a craniotomy was performed. Cerebral angiograms performed 9 days after the operation demonstrated a decrease in the size of the AVM. Repeated cerebral angiograms performed a month later demonstrated complete disappearance of the AVM. Follow-up angiograms performed 19 months after hemorrhage confirmed complete disappearance of the AVM. Spontaneous disappearance is known to occur occasionally in small AVMs but rarely in huge ones such as the one presented here. Several possible mechanisms for spontaneous disappearance of AVMs are discussed."

Cerebral angiography demonstrated an aneurysm arising from the middle cerebral artery bifurcation. No other malformation was visible either on the computed tomographic scan or on angiography. The diagnosis was ruptured middle cerebral artery aneurysm with intracerebral hematoma. At surgery, there was no blood in the sylvian fissure and the aneurysm was not ruptured. Evacuation of the hematoma and thorough exploration of the cavity led to the discovery and resection of a small vascular anomaly typical of an arteriovenous malformation responsible for the hemorrhage. Occult vascular malformations and the association of aneurysm with arteriovenous malformations are discussed. In these 3 patients, the coexistence of these two malformations could be related to a common congenital abnormality."

Cerebral angiography revealed fistulas located in the anterior cranial fossa. Three patients underwent surgery, and the fistulas were successfully obliterated. One patient with nonruptured DAVF requested conservative medical management. Incidental detection of asymptomatic or nonruptured DAVFs in the anterior cranial fossa has increased with the wider use of MR imaging.

Computed tomography on admission revealed small intraventricular hemorrhage in the right lateral ventricle. No intracranial vascular lesion was detected and magnetic resonance angiography was used at yearly follow up. Two years after the first admission, he suffered diplopia and cerebral angiography revealed transverse sinus dural AVF. Right pulsatile tinnitus occurred 4 years after the first admission. The symptoms suddenly disappeared 5 years after the first admission, and follow-up angiography showed disappearance of the dural AVF. The exact mechanism of the spontaneous occlusion of dural AVF remains unknown. This case of spontaneous transverse sinus dural AVF closure occurred without disruption of sinus patency, suggesting that thrombosis of the draining veins into sinuses was not involved."
CD009372,0,2678596,0,The value of angiography in cerebrovascular disease.,"The expanding availability of digital subtraction angiography has essentially contributed in lowering the risks in the use of angiography of the cerebral arteries. The best results in imaging the cerebral artery are achieved by conventional subtraction angiography after selective catheterisation. This is, however, only important for diagnosis in intracerebral pathological changes distal of the Circulus Willisi or in connection with preoperative interventional radiological treatment. Pre-clinical diagnosis of patients with cerebrovascular occlusive disease as well as clinical diagnosis with Doppler and B-scan US sonography can be optimally complemented by DSA using 4-5 French catheters entered in the thoracic ascending aorta. Using this technique, the sensitivity and specificity with an image-matrix of 512 is diagnostically adequate and includes an only limited examination risk. Complication with lasting neurological defects will be least observed after intravenous pre-atrial application of contrast media and most after selective angiography of the carotid artery. Here the extent of the multiple arteriosclerotic obliteration is of essential importance. The quality of interpretation of the diagnostic findings essentially depends on indications not only about the grade of obliteration but also on the morphological details. At present DSA with application of contrast media into the thoracic ascending aorta in combination with the duplex-scan method represent the optimum for the diagnosis of cerebrovascular disease. In spite of lower specificity intravenous application of contrast media has to be preferred for post-operative controls and controls of progressing disease with ""screening""."
CD009372,0,2678595,0,The value of diagnostic procedures in treating ischemic attacks and stroke.,"Diagnostic procedures for cerebral ischemia make clear strategies mandatory. Careful recording of case history, internal and neurological investigation either substantiate or make unlikely TIA and stroke. CT scan not only differentiates bleedings, tumors etc from ischemia but also can give very valuable information about the underlying vascular pathology. Multiple lacunes are characteristic of cerebral microangiopathy. Territorial and branch occlusion infarcts mostly indicate embolic occlusion of pial vessels from either cardiac or arterial sources. Endzone and borderline infarctions are seen with high grade stenosis or occlusion of the internal carotid artery. The identification of embolic sources necessitates cardiological (including echocardiography) and angiological (Doppler sonography and in selected cases angiography) investigations. Therapeutic and prophylactic measures depend on the etiology of TIA and stroke and are briefly dealt with."
CD009372,0,17981672,0,Subarachnoid hemorrhage: effect on cerebral blood flow and cerebral metabolism.,Alterations in cerebral blood flow and metabolism after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) are well known and have been extensively described. Many techniques exist in the intensive care setting to monitor for these alterations. Ranging from classic neurological exam to novel imaging studies a variety of modalities are available for intensive monitoring. Early identification of cerebral vasospasm is the key to prevention of its long term complications and as such the role of genetics and biochemical markers are currently being investigated. The dynamics of cerebral blood flow and metabolism following SAH are unique and require additional studies before any monitoring technique can be used as stand alone modality and supplant the DSA as the gold standard for detection of cerebral vasospasm.

Report of two cases.,"The authors report two cases of ischemic stroke secondary to occlusive vasculopathy two decades after radiation therapy (RT) for medulloblastoma. Both patients underwent posterior fossa medulloblastoma partial resection, followed by craniospinal RT in which a cobalt 60 source was used; 40 Gy were given to the whole brain plus a 15-Gy boost to the posterior fossa. Both patients received multiagent chemotherapy, immediately following radiation therapy in the first case and after repeated craniotomy for recurrence 13 years after radiation in the second case. They experienced multiple sequelae from radiation and chemotherapy, including growth retardation and psychomotor delay. However, 20 years after treatment, they remained tumor free and able to work, until they presented with focal neurological deficits and seizures. Computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain in both cases showed no tumor recurrence, but did demonstrate ischemia in a posterior cerebral artery distribution. Cerebral angiography revealed multiple mid-sized arterial wall irregularities as well as focal stenoses consistent with a postirradiation vasculopathy. The pathophysiological mechanisms, radiological appearance, and incidence of this syndrome are reviewed from the literature."

We examined the clinical characteristics of TIA patients presenting with enhanced lesions visualized by contrast-enhanced MRI. We retrospectively evaluated 64 patients with carotid TIAs. We evaluated the frequency and topography of TIA associated infarcts on contrast-enhanced MRI and compared the clinical background of patients with and without such lesions. Twenty-three patients underwent plain MRI only, while the remaining 41 patients underwent contrast-enhanced MRI. Of the latter 41 patients, 16 had abnormal enhanced lesions (39%: group L), while 25 had no lesions (61%: group NL). In group L, all lesions were spotty, and they were located in the cerebral cortex in 13 patients (81%), the subcortex in two (12%), and the perforator territory in one (6%). Aphasia or confusional state, hypertension, and emboligenic cardiac or arterial disease (stenosis > or =50%) were more frequently observed in group L than in group NL (38 vs. 8%, 81 vs. 48%, and 93 vs. 60%, respectively, P<0. 05).

There are no effective treatments other than surgical intervention. However, another option for decreasing the occurrence of SAH may be prevention of aneurysms formation and of their rupture by controlling risk factors. Cigarette smoking has been recently shown to be one of the major risk factors for SAH. We investigated whether cigarette smoking increased the risk of developing cerebral aneurysms and of SAH. Degree of smoking was investigated in 182 patients with SAH and in 123 patients with an unruptured cerebral aneurysm incidentally detected during investigation of other diseases. Sixty-nine patients with other diseases who were shown to be free of cerebral aneurysms through MR angiography served as controls. Smoking significantly increased the risk of both aneurysm formation and SAH; The odds ratio for SAH was 2.4, and for unruptured cerebral aneurysm 1.7. Smoking especially increased the occurrence of SAH in women and in youngsters. However, smoking did not influence the occurrence of cerebral vasospasm and multiplicity of aneurysms. These data suggest the importance of avoiding smoking to prevent the occurrence of cerebral aneurysms and of SAH."
CD009372,0,15757025,0,Emerging medical and surgical management strategies in the evaluation and treatment of intracerebral hemorrhage.,"Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) accounts for approximately 10% of all strokes and causes high morbidity and mortality. Rupture of the small perforating vessels of the cerebral arteries is caused by chronic hypertension, which induces pathologic changes in the small vessels and accounts for most cases of ICH; however, amyloid angiopathy and other secondary causes are being seen more frequently with the increasing age of the population. Recent computed tomographic studies have revealed that ICH is a dynamic process with up to one third of initial hemorrhages expanding within the first several hours of ictus. Secondary injury is believed to result from the development of cerebral edema and the release of specific neurotoxins associated with the breakdown products of hemoglobin. Treatment is primarily supportive. Surgical evacuation is the treatment of choice for patients with neurologic deterioration from infratentorial hematomas. Randomized trials comparing surgical evacuation to medical management have shown no benefit of surgical removal of supratentorial hemorrhages. New strategies focusing on early hemostasis, improved critical care management, and less invasive surgical techniques for clot evacuation are promising to decrease secondary neurologic injury. We review the pathophysiology of ICH, its medical management, and new treatment strategies for improving patient outcome."

She had the first seizure attack and was admitted to a hospital at March 4, 1993, with prolonged disturbance of consciousness and subsequent mental deterioration. Her brain CT showed multiple small calcifications in the subcortical white matter and pons. The laboratory data including blood count, serum chemistry, serological studies and CSF was normal. MRI and digital subtraction angiography of the cranial vessels were unremarkable. There was a decrease in accumulation in the right cerebral hemisphere on 123I IMP SPECT. Despite anti-convulsant therapy, she had recurrent seizures several times, with gradual worsening of her mental state. She had the latest seizure attack and was transferred to Matsusaka Chuo Hospital, on August 29, 1993. After the attack she had been in the apallic state, and died on Nov. 13, 1995. This case was discussed in a neurological CPC. The discussants suggested that the isolated angiitis of the central nervous system caused secondary seizures and cerebral infarctions. Post-mortem examination revealed the CNS findings of vasculitis at various stages, calcification or mineralization mainly in the subcortical white matter and pons, massive cerebral infarctions with massive exudate, fresh and old small bleedings and exudate around the inflamed or calcified vessels. The white matter degeneration resembled that of Binswanger leukoencephalopathy.

Cerebral angiography taken on the day of rupture revealed only small recanalization of the aneurysm neck with no dome-filling. This is the first report of delayed rupture due to minor recurrence of a previously unruptured small asymptomatic cerebral aneurysm after saccular coil packing. A literature review of 26 reports of late bleeding after coil embolization of previously unruptured cerebral aneurysms showed that dome-filling after coil embolization, symptomatic aneurysms and large/giant aneurysms all increase the risk of delayed rupture in previously unruptured aneurysms after saccular coil packing."

Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging showed SAH localized in the interhemispheric fissure and cerebral infarction in the territory of the right ACA. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) demonstrated segmental narrowing and dilatation at the right A(1) and A(2) portions of the ACA, leading to a diagnosis of ACA dissection. Fourteen days after the onset, DSA confirmed the enlarged fusiform dilatation of the right A(2) portion with distal narrowing, suggesting the risk of rerupture of the dissection. Endovascular obliteration of the aneurysm with parent artery occlusion was performed without anastomosis on day 16. The aneurysm was catheterized and obliterated with detachable coils. Postoperative DSA revealed complete obliteration of the dissection and parent artery. The patient was doing well without recurrence of the dissection 8 months after the intervention.

CD009372,0,21495812,0,Multiple spinal and cranial dural arteriovenous fistulas.,"Synchronous multiplicity of cranial and spinal dural arteriovenous fistulas (DAVFs) is known but uncommon. The authors report on a patient with the unusual finding of multiple cranial and multiple separate spinal DAVFs. The patient initially presented with vague visual symptoms in 2004. A cranial DAVF was identified along the left transverse sinus with cortical venous reflux and another DAVF was identified along the posterior part of the superior sagittal sinus with no cortical venous reflux. The first DAVF was treated both endovascularly and surgically and the second was left untreated. The follow-up angiogram showed multiple spinal DAVFs at the levels of C-1, C-2, and C-6 on the left side and at the C-3 level on the right side along with another cranial DAVF along the anterior part of the superior sagittal sinus with cortical venous reflux. A retrospective analysis of the digital subtraction angiogram and MR images suggested that the cervical spinal DAVFs were already present in 2004 (6 years previously). Multiple DAVFs, although rare, do exist and it is important to look for any evidence of their presence when evaluating patients with symptoms suggestive of arteriovenous fistulas."
CD009372,0,12916556,0,Neuroimaging of stroke: a review.,"Advances in neuroimaging technology during the past 30 years have resulted in a virtual explosion in the amount of pathologic information that can be obtained in the clinical stroke setting. This neuroimaging revolution has led to a much better understanding of cerebrovascular and tissue pathology, creating a wide array of opportunities for acute treatment and secondary prevention. Advances include early and accurate detection of ischemic and infarcted tissue and the ability to reveal hypoperfused tissue at risk. Clinicians are increasingly able to noninvasively detect embolic and atherothrombotic intravascular lesions. Vascular lesions associated with stroke can be characterized through endovascular neuroimaging techniques and repaired by various means. In this article, we provide an overview and update on the various techniques used in the neuroimaging of stroke and intracranial hemorrhage, including computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasound, and catheter angiography. We outline the specific role of each modality in clinical practice."
CD009372,0,3591482,0,Changes produced by CT scanning in the outlook of severe head injury.,"This is a study of the changes that have occurred in the field of severe head injury since the advent of CT scanning, comparing two homogeneous series of patients selected by clinical status (Glasgow Coma Scale less than or equal to 8), namely a series of 1,000 cases admitted to our Department between 1973 and 1976, already published in this Journal, and one of 385 cases cared for between 1979 and 1980, when CT scanning had become generally available. The two series of patients compare very closely in many respects, particularly in the incidence of surgical cases. In the more recent series the overall outcome was better both in surgical and in non-surgical cases. Among patients in the CT scan series the incidence of brain contusion associated with haematoma was greater than that of pure subdural haematomas. In non-surgical patients the CT scan, unlike cerebral angiography, afforded better identification of traumatic lesions and the grouping of patients into homogeneous categories correlating with a given outcome. On admission, cerebral angiography and CT scanning were equally effective in detecting lesions of surgical import; later in the course of the illness, however, CT scanning proved far more effective in detecting changes, with fully 15% of the patients being referred for surgery in the light of repeat CT scan findings as opposed to only 4% undergoing surgery on the indications of repeat angiography. Also, in the new series the mean interval from injury to surgery was shorter, with 64% of patients being operated on within 6 hours of the injury.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Localization of an aneurysm via computed tomography depends on the size of the aneurysm. Proof of an intracerebral haemorrhage is definitely a pointer towards lateral localization of the vascular malformation. This means that in severely ill patients, panangiography need not be effected for the purpose of diagnosis. Attention is drawn to the pathological emergence of the contrast medium after intravenous administration in subarachnoid haemorrhages. The authors considers this a sign of a disturbance of the blood-brain barrier, although the pathogenetic mechanism remains unknown. Computed tomography is a valuable complement to angiography in subarachnoidal haemorrhage. However, it is pointed out by means of a few examples that it may well be that an accurate diagnosis can be arrived at only via biopsy, i.e. by the histological approach only."
CD009372,0,1727311,0,Cerebral vasculitis: MR imaging and angiographic correlation.,"Cerebral vasculitis is an unusual disorder with numerous causes. One such entity, noninfectious granulomatous angiitis of the nervous system (GANS), is an extremely rare disease with a predilection for leptomeningeal and parenchymal arteries and veins. Isolated involvement of the central nervous system is characteristic of GANS, which has also been referred to as primary angiitis of the central nervous system (PACNS). The results of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and angiography in seven patients with presumed PACNS were retrospectively analyzed and correlated. MR images were positive in every case. Characteristically, lesions were multiple, bilateral, and supratentorial. Both gray- and white-matter infarcts were identified in four of seven patients; infarcts were most common in the deep white matter. PACNS can also appear as primary parenchymal hemorrhage or simulate low-grade glioma. All lesions identified on MR images were associated with positive angiographic findings of cerebral vasculitis in the corresponding vascular distribution. However, for 12 of 33 vascular distributions with angiographic evidence of cerebral vasculitis, no lesions were identified on MR images. These correlative observations suggest that some patients with proved PACNS may have normal MR imaging results."

Of the 136 consecutive patients with confirmed CCAD, 16 presented with pulsatile tinnitus. On admission 10 patients presented with subjective tinnitus and five with objective tinnitus, tinnitus being the only presenting symptom in one case. In one further case with bilateral ICA dissection (ICAD) subjective tinnitus appeared three months after the initial symptoms of arterial dissection, despite a contralateral cervical bruit being evident on admission. Thirteen patients presented with headache or neck pain. Ischaemic symptoms were detected in six and Horner's syndrome in four patients. Vertigo and dysgeusia were reported in two patients each. Arterial dissection involved unilateral ICA in 11, bilateral ICA in two, unilateral vertebral artery (VA) in two and bilateral ICA and bilateral VA in one patient. In angiography the most common finding was irregular stenosis, and the majority of these abnormalities normalized during follow-up.

Their diseases included arterial trunk stenosis/occlusion ( n=4), aneurysm ( n=3), arteriovenous malformation ( n=2), venous angioma ( n=1), and sinus thrombosis ( n=1). The technique depicted not only anatomical features, comparably to MR angiography ( n=10/11), but also hemodynamics such as collateral flow at a temporal resolution of 1.68 s/frame.

Average age; 7.83 years (range: 2 months to 15 years). Confirming diagnosis was performed by computerised tomography (CT) scan, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, echography and/or cerebral arteriography. Ten cases of ischaemic stroke and ten of haemorrhagic stroke were catalogued. Average follow-up was 5.45 years (range: 9 months to 10.8 years). Fibromuscular dysplasia, arthritis and meningitis are predominant in ischaemic stroke etiology, there also being one case of Moya-Moya. Haemorrhagic strokes are mostly produced by arteriovenous malformation. The predominant presenting form of ischaemic stroke was hemiplegia and of haemorrhagic strokes it was intracranial hypertension. There were no deaths as a result of ischaemic accidents but three in the cerebral haemorrhage group. Treatment was surgical in two cases, embolisation in two others and medical support in the remaining sixteen. There were no cases of relapse, except in the Moya-Moya case.

Clinical and radiological (MRI) follow-up series suggest that having hemorrhaged once, recurrent hemorrhage with progressive neurologic dysfunction may commonly occur. We have therefore chosen to treat these lesions when first symptomatic with stereotactic linear radiosurgery (SLR). We now report, after a median follow-up of 27 months, 12 patients with CAs (9 women, 3 men, mean age 40 years) treated in this fashion. Ten patients presented with hemorrhage (3 had more than one hemorrhage): two patients had new onset seizures. All patients had enhanced MRI/MRAs characteristic of CA. There were five brainstem and five thalamic CAs, and one each in the temporal lobe and insula. Cerebral angiograms were done in 8 patients for comparison with their respective MRAs. Only one CA was visualized in the late venous phase on cerebral angiogram and identical vascular features were appreciated on the MRA. The diameter of the CAs ranged from 1.0 to 3.0 cm with a mean of 1.6 cm. Dosimetry planning was based on MRI/CT features and the mean dose at the isocenter was 2.167 cGy (range = 2,000-2,500 cGy) delivered with a mean collimation diameter of 1.46 cm (range = 1.0-2.0 cm). All 12 patients continued to improve neurologically after SLR and had MRI-documented changes in their lesions: in general, the lesions became smaller and signal characteristics converted to methemaglobin. However, 1 patient had an early post-SLR hemorrhage, documented by MRI, at 4.5 months.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

CD009372,0,200392,0,Computed tomography of extracerebral hematoma.,"The appearance on C.T. of 30 extracerebral hematomas is described. Acute subdural hematomas were seen as bandlike lesions with markedly increased, homogenous density. Epidural hematomas demonstrated a high density and a biconvex, lenticular shape. During the process of liquefaction the density decreases and three hematomas appeared as isodense lesions. The majority of chronic subdural hematomas presented a mildly to moderately decreased, nonhomogenous density, the clearly identifiable inner wall of the lesion being either convex or concave. Subdural hygromas showed a homogeneous, markedly decreased density. Almost all the hematomas caused compression of the homolateral lateral ventricle and displacement of midline structures, particularly of the septum pellucidum. In 60% of the hematomas a dilatation of the contralateral lateral ventricle, predominantly of the posterior part was seen. Acute hematomas presented oedema in varying degrees, in chronic hematomas oedema was usually absent. In the original interpretation extracerebral hematomas were recognized as a lesion on C.T. in 97% (1 false negative result), in 90%, the lesion was correctly diagnosed as an extracerebral hematoma (1 false negative and 2 incorrect). The series contained one false positive C.T. scan and 2 intracerebral hematomas were interpreted incorrectly as subdural hematomas. The review C.T. diagnosis proved to be correct in 100%. C.T. and angiography appeared to have about the same diagnostic accuracy. However, C.T. is a non invasive investigation and it provides valuable additional information with regard to all the intracranial contents. Therefore C.T. should be the method of first choice in the diagnosis of extracerebral hematomas."

Case report].,"A 48-year-old female suffered from severe headache, vomiting, and disturbance of consciousness. On admission, she was somnolent with mild paresis of the left leg. Precontrast computed tomography (CT) scans showed a high-density area in the left sylvian fissure and the posterior horn of the left lateral ventricle. Angiographically, a right middle cerebral artery aneurysm and a basilar artery aneurysm were recognized. Furthermore, on the venous phase of bilateral carotid angiograms, superior sagittal sinus (SSS) thrombosis was recognized. Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) was probably induced by rupture of a dilated vein associated with SSS thrombosis, because high-density area on CT scan and location of the aneurysms were different. The patient was initially treated conservatively. Two months later, craniotomy was performed which did not disclose any trace of hemorrhage around the aneurysms and aneurysms themselves. Postoperatively, acute brain swelling and generalized convulsion were induced. The patient became ambulatory 5 months after surgery. In SAH cases, the venous phase should be examined at least in one side of the carotid arteries. In such a SAH case induced by venous thrombosis complicated by aneurysms it is very difficult to decide the timing of surgery for aneurysms."

A review of the literature was made to clarify the incidence, the pathological change, and the prognosis of systemic lupus erythematosus with subarachnoid hemorrhage. The incidence of subarachnoid hemorrhage in SLE was about two percent in the reported clinical cases. The mechanisms of the subarachnoid hemorrhage and the aneurysmal formation in SLE seemed to be due to angitic changes, which involved the vessels of the whole body systematically. The exact prognosis of SLE with subarachnoid hemorrhage is difficult to say, but it seems to be unfortunately poor due to multiplicity of the lesion and the difficulty of its treatment."

In 13 consecutive patients with ICA dissections the diagnosis was made by means of non-invasive tests including extracranial and transcranial Doppler sonography, contrast enhanced computed tomography (ceCT), and, in five patients, MRI. Intra-arterial digital subtraction angiography used as the gold standard in all cases was confirmative. Extracranial and transcranial ultrasound findings indicative of the diagnosis could be identified. MRI directly demonstrated the intramural haematoma and the false lumen of the dissected artery. These non-invasive techniques also allowed for repetitive follow up examinations. They were, however, unable to demonstrate false aneurysms in the chronic state. Results show that the diagnosis of carotid dissection can be made by means of cerebrovascular ultrasound and MRI."

Twenty-two patients (16 men, 6 women) with a CA AVF (n = 5) or PA (n = 17) owing to a gunshot or stab wound, carotid endarterectomy, blunt trauma, a tumor, spontaneous dissection, or a central venous catheter were treated with percutaneous placement of stent grafts. The patients presented with tumor, bruit, headache, mouth and tracheostomy bleeding, transitory hemiparesis, seizure, or stroke. Diagnoses were made by using computed tomographic angiography (CTA) and digital subtraction angiography. Fourteen lesions were in the common CA; eight were in the internal CA. Homemade devices and stent grafts from a variety of manufacturers were employed. Follow-up evaluations included clinical, CTA, and Doppler ultrasound assessments. All patients had resolution of the PA or AVF. In one patient with a large petrous PA, acute occlusion of the CA developed after placement of three balloon-expandable stent grafts, but there were no neurologic complications because the circle of Willis was functional. During follow-up ranging from 2 months to 13 years, asymptomatic 90% stenosis owing to stent compression was observed on Doppler ultrasound and angiographic examinations in a patient with an autologous vein-covered stent graft in the internal CA. Three other patients died of causes unrelated to stent-graft placement. In all other patients, the stent graft remained patent. Our results indicate that stent grafting is an acceptable alternative to surgery in the treatment of AVF and PAs in the CA."

Previously described PCASL-based angiography techniques were limited to two-dimensional projection images or relatively low-resolution three-dimensional (3D) imaging due to long acquisition time. This work proposes a new PCASL-based 3D magnetic resonance angiography method that uses an accelerated 3D radial acquisition technique (VIPR, spoiled gradient echo) as the readout. Benefiting from the sparsity provided by PCASL and noise-like artifacts of VIPR, this new method is able to obtain submillimeter 3D isotropic resolution and whole head coverage with a 8-min scan. Intracranial angiography feasibility studies in healthy (N = 5) and diseased (N = 5) subjects show reduced saturation artifacts in PCASL-VIPR compared with a standard time-of-flight protocol. These initial results show great promise for PCASL-VIPR for static, dynamic, and vessel selective 3D intracranial angiography."

MRI showed infra- and supratentorial patchy hyperintensities in T2-weighted images and in the FLAIR sequence. Diffusion-weighted imaging revealed corresponding multi-focal hyperintense areas indicating increased diffusion and MRA showed a diffuse multisegmental narrowing of all pial arteries. MRI at day 10 was completely normal, but MRA still revealed vascular narrowing in the right posterior cerebral artery. General slight flow accelerations in all basal arteries occurred after 10 days and lasted for three weeks.

The principle clinical aspects of intracranial arteriectasis are cranial nerve palsies, particularly of the cerebellopontine region in association or not with cerebellar disorders and transient or permanent motor deficiencies. Arterial hypertension exists in a high proportion of cases. The some times complex clinical picture may be due to pressure of nervous structures by the ectatic vessels, ischemia or hemorrhagy. Mostly affected are men over 50 years of age although arteriectasis has been observed in younger patients including children and infants. The disease can be suspected clinically but is generally diagnosed after neuroradiological studies, mostly angiography and/or computerized tomography. Initially arteriectasis was supposed to be the result of arteriosclerosis but histopathology has shown that it may be independent of arteriosclerosis and appears to be the result of a congenital abnormality in the elastic component of the vessel wall. On the basis of our six observations and those already published it becomes apparent that diffuse intracranial arteriectasis represents a specific disease."

He had no medical history. On admission, he exhibited hypesthesia and disturbance of the touch and the vibratory sense on the right side of his body excluding the face. A brain T2* -weighted image revealed the a dot like lesion surrounded by an iso-signal lesion in the medial medulla oblongata. Therefore a diagnosis of medullary hemorrhage was made. Although a vascular malformation was considered as the cause of the hemorrhage, cerebral angiography did not reveal any vascular malformations. After admission, he developed left hypoglossal nerve palsy on day 6, and intractable hiccups on day 11. A T2* -weighted image and a FLAIR image disclosed edema surrounding the hematoma in the medial medullary lesion.

Computed axial tomography is a sensitive procedure for detection of cavernomas. Of 7 cases examined by this technique, 7 (7/7) have shown a well circumscribed round or oval hyperdense nodule, with calcifications in 6/7 cases, a slight surrounding oedema in 3/7 cases and without mass effect, except if there is a visible hematoma at operation (2/8). After contrast administration, 5/7 malformations were enhanced and 2/7 displayed draining veins, a fact that we underline. The differential diagnosis includes a low grade calcified glioma, a thrombosed arterio-venous malformation, a venous angioma or an intracerebral hematoma. Surgical excision is the best treatment of these vascular malformations that bleed frequently, and improved all the patients in this series (8/8)."

CD009372,0,7304126,0,[Capsulo-thalamic hemorrhage (author's transl)].,"The authors report clinical and scanographic findings in 26 cases of capsulo-thalamic hemorrhage. They stress the frequency of arterial hypertension as a pre-disposing factor. The clinical picture is represented by the association of disorders of consciousness (usually obnubilation), contralateral flaccid hemiplegia with hemianesthesia, oculomotor disorders (disturbance of vertical gaze, miosis) and disorders of linguistic and motor behaviour. The paraclinical examination of choice is scanography which enables the site, volume and extent of the hemorrhage to be estimated, together with the mass effect and intraventricular rupture. Clinical and scanographic follow-up indicates a favourable prognosis for capsulo-thalamic hemorrhage (77% survival). Follow-up findings point to several unfavourable prognostic factors: immediate coma, persistent and massive flaccid hemiplegia, hemorrhage size exceeding 3 cm, and severe intraventricular rupture. In the light of the data in the literature, the authors discuss the clinical and scanographic signs of capsulo-thalamic hemorrhage."
CD009372,0,1609697,0,Current role of cerebral angiography in the diagnosis of cerebrovascular diseases.,"The role of cerebral angiography in the diagnosis of cerebrovascular disease is currently being questioned because of the increasing availability of MR angiography. The purpose of this essay is to place the use of cerebral angiography in perspective in light of these new developments. In patients with atherosclerotic cerebrovascular disease, MR angiography can almost entirely supplant cerebral angiography as a screening procedure in the evaluation of the carotid bifurcation. However, detection of ""pseudoocclusion"" still requires cerebral angiography for accurate diagnosis. Atherosclerotic stenosis or occlusion of the major intracranial vessels at the base of the brain can be detected with MR angiography, but not as accurately as with cerebral angiography. Furthermore, for detection of more distal occlusions, cerebral angiography is still needed. A number of erroneous concepts about the risks and value of cerebral angiography have prevented its optimal use for patients with cerebrovascular disease. These myths can be countered by applying several rules to optimize the use of cerebral angiography. Subarachnoid hemorrhage is best evaluated with CT followed by detailed cerebral angiography, although MR angiography can be used as a screening test for aneurysms 3 mm or larger. Cerebral angiography is still necessary to confirm the diagnosis of cerebrovascular malformations, although MR angiography is a useful screening test. Cerebral angiography is required for the definitive diagnosis of arteritis, arterial dissection, or fibromuscular dysplasia."

Three hours later, she was transferred to our hospital by ambulance car because of continuous headache and vomiting. She had no history of head trauma. She had been medicated hypertension for five years. On admission she suffered from headache and nausea. But there was no clinical sign in physical and neurological examinations. The meningeal irritation was not present, but lumbar puncture showed slightly pinky CSF with normal pressure. A plain computed tomographic scan showed a thin high density mass in the left temporal extra-axial region and the slight deviation of the midline structures to the right. Left carotid arteriogram showed an avascular region over the left cerebral convexity, an aneurysm of the left A2-A3 junction and a questionable aneurysm of the bifurcation of left middle cerebral artery. Right carotid arteriogram showed an aneurysm of the bifurcation of right middle cerebral artery. We diagnosed this case as an acute subdural hematoma by CT scan and arteriogram. We were perplexed preoperatively whether this bleeding was spontaneous or secondary to the rupture of aneurysm, and we could not deny the possibility of a ruptured aneurysm. On March 15, 1984, three days after onset, operation was performed. At operation, a small subdural hematoma was removed, and the underlying cortex was normal.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

A rare subtype of arteriovenous fistula may occur from a pseudoaneurysm of the anterior communicating artery (AcoA) instead of the internal carotid artery. We describe a patient with a traumatic pseudoaneurysm of the AcoA with a cavernous sinus fistula treated with endovascular treatment. A 68-year-old man presented with a severe head injury after a fall. Coronal view multiplanar reformatted images with contrast medium showed gradual expansion of the pseudoaneurysm of the AcoA and the enhanced area of the cavernous sinus. Five weeks after the injury, the patient had a subarachnoid hemorrhage. A cerebral angiogram showed a fistula between the pseudoaneurysm of the AcoA and the cavernous sinus. The AcoA, left anterior cerebral artery and part of the pseudoaneurysm were obliterated by coil embolization. A postoperative angiogram showed no flow through the pseudoaneurysm and the cavernous sinus fistula. A traumatic AcoA pseudoaneurysm with a cavernous sinus fistula may occur as an extremely rare complication of head injury."
CD009372,0,10587470,0,Evaluation of measures of technical image quality for intracranial magnetic resonance angiography.,"We evaluate three measures of technical image quality for intracranial magnetic resonance angiography (MRA): (1) a two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) evaluation of vessel visibility, (2) vessel-to-background signal-difference-to-noise ratio (SDNR), and (3) observer ranking of the fidelity of vessel morphology compared to that in a gold standard image. The gold standard used for both the 2AFC and ranking measures is intraarterial catheter angiography. These measures are applied to healthy arterial segments. The 2AFC and SDNR measures directly evaluate the visibility of artery segments for which the existence is known from the gold standard images. We argue that (1) 2AFC evaluates the carrier signals on which any vascular disease process is modulated and provides an upper bound on the detectibility of vascular lesions, (2) SDNR is a predictor of 2AFC, and (3) ranking may be used to predict the relative performance of techniques in the detection of vascular lesions."
CD009372,0,2718867,0,Blood flow in the carotid arteries: quantification by using phase-sensitive MR imaging.,"The feasibility of MR phase-sensitive imaging for the quantification of blood flow in the carotid arteries was studied in two normal volunteers and six patients with carotid artery and/or cerebrovascular disease. The technique consists of sensitizing the phase of the MR signal to blood flow velocity gated to different times in the cardiac cycle. Flow velocities and volumes were measured by using transverse planes in the common, internal, and external carotid arteries, and flow curves were generated. Measurements made by using flow phantoms correlated well with calculated results. The MR measurements yielded values between 250 and 580 ml/min for the total flow through each of the common carotid arteries in the two normal volunteers. Markedly reduced flow (about 50% below normal) was detected in a patient whose arteriogram showed severe occlusion of the internal carotid artery. In a second patient, who had a large frontal intracranial arteriovenous malformation noted by arteriography, the MR-quantified flow was abnormally high (about 1 liter/min). In the remaining four patients, the findings on phase-sensitive quantification were consistent with those expected from clinical and other laboratory studies (including arteriography and sonography). These preliminary findings suggest that MR phase mapping may be a feasible tool for the noninvasive quantification of carotid blood flow."

By using special techniques only these signals are evidenced, with cancelling of the surrounding stationary tissues. Clinical applications are reviewed in this paper. They include: Evaluation of intracranial vessels with important adjunct information to those obtained by conventional MR images; Definition of cerebrovascular disease including the carotid artery with good correlation with Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA); Evidence of abdominal vessels, with clear imaging of abdominal aortic aneurysms; Definition of renal arteries; although problems exist, the technique may become useful in the future for the screening of renovascular hypertension; Visualization of peripheral vessels; initial results indicate a potential application in the evaluation of peripheral run-off distal to occlusions."

Measurement of mCBF without blood sampling and single photon emission tomography (SPECT) were performed at 1 and 7 days after surgery in 35 consecutive SAH patients, of whom 16 were examined at day 30 as well. A decrease in mCBF of more than 10% on day 7 versus day 1 was considered to indicate vasospasm. On visual interpretation of SPECT, a perfusion decrease which appeared newly on day 7 was considered to indicate vasospasm. In total, nine of 35 patients had cerebral vasospasm confirmed by computed tomography (CT) and/or angiography. The mCBF measurement showed a 77.8% (7/9) sensitivity, a 88.5% (23/26) specificity, a 70.0% (7/10) positive predictive value, and a 92.0% (23/25) negative predictive value. SPECT yielded a 33.3% (3/9) sensitivity, a 73.1% (19/26) specificity, a 30.0% (3/10) positive predictive value, and a 76.0% (19/25) negative predictive value. On SPECT, decreased perfusion was observed in most of the patients at clipping sites, which might represent post-operative transient abnormal perfusion and should not be read as vasospasm. In conclusion, this mCBF measurement is more accurate than visual interpretation of SPECT for detecting vasospasm."

Arteriography or MRA show the aneurysm and eliminate vascular malformation.

The technique was applied to 27 healthy volunteers and 39 patients. The superior sagittal and straight sinuses, the internal cerebral veins, and the Galen vein were visualized in all the volunteers. Other veins were seen in a high percentage of subjects. Systematic comparison of digital subtraction angiography (DSA) after intraarterial contrast medium injection and MR venography in patients showed good correlation between the two techniques. MR venography proved helpful in identifying thrombosis or patency of cerebral veins and sinuses and showed collateral venous drainage and venous drainage from arteriovenous malformations. There was good correlation between conventional contrast angiography and MR venography. In conclusion, MR venography is considered reliable for showing the cerebral venous system and provides information additional to that of conventional spin-echo imaging."
CD009372,0,11507445,0,[Transcranial Doppler imaging: state of the art].,"Initially introduced in the early 1980's, transcranial Doppler followed by transcranial Doppler sonography were used in neurosurgical units for management and follow-up of intracranial vasospasm in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage. This imaging technique, more sensitive and less invasive than catheter angiography, also proved to be of value for diagnosis of intracranial atherosclerosis, management of patients with head trauma, and evaluation of collateral flow through the circle of Willis. Doppler US would also allow prediction of the risk of symptomatic embolic events through monitoring of HITS. Evaluation of the middle cerebral arteries during carotid occlusion testing is useful for evaluating the need for particular revascularization techniques. Finally, Doppler imaging is useful to assess patients with possible brain death. A recent advance in Doppler imaging is the ability to provide a three-dimensional projection (3D Doppler) of the intracranial arteries enabling improved detection and evaluation of stenoses involving the circle of Willis and improved characterization of intracranial aneurysms. These new applications benefit from the use of US contrast agents and harmonic US imaging."

Diagnostic procedures should include a spinal tap to rule out potentially treatable lesions. CT scan and cerebral angiography may also be helpful in certain cases. Transfusion therapy remains the mainstay of management in the acute phase of cerebral infarction. There is considerable evidence to indicate that long-term transfusion programs are effective in the prevention of recurrences.

Forty-three patients with brain attack were examined with CE-MRA. A tracker volume of SmartPrep technique was placed along the ascending aorta in the coronal image. After the bolus injection of gadolinium, an increase in signal that corresponded to the arrival of gadolinium was used to trigger centric re-ordered spoiled gradient echo arterial selective MRA with imaging time of 20-40 sec. We were able to achieve a 100% successful triggering rate of SmartPrep technique and selectively arterial-phase carotid and vertebral arteries with almost no venous contamination could be delineated. These techniques enabled high resolution imaging of entire craniocervical arteries from aortic arch to the circle of Willis.

The case was that of a female aged 51 who was hospitalized with the chief complaint of consciousness disorder. The patient was discharged from the hospital 1 year before, after undergoing subtotal extirpation of a tumor through the transsphenoidal sinus in a case of pituitary adenoma, and post-operative radiotherapy (topical 50 Gy). Mild hyperlipidemia associated with hypothyroidism was observed by blood biochemical test during the patient's hospitalization, and multiple cerebral infarction was also observed by CT scanning and MR imaging. Therefore, conservative treatments including intensified endocrine-supplementing treatment, centering on thyroid hormone, were attempted. The patient's thyroid gland function and hyperlipidemia improved but the consciousness disorder persisted. Exacerbation of the consciousness disorder occurred suddenly 6 weeks after the patient's hospitalization. Subarachnoid hemorrhage and hydrocephalus were observed by CT scanning. Cerebral angiography detected a saccular aneurysm in the trifurcation of the right middle cerebral artery, 3 fusiform aneurysms in the periphery of the right middle cerebral artery, 2 fusiform aneurysms in the posterior cerebral artery and irregularity of wall width in the central artery including the terminal region of the internal carotid artery. These findings were not observed at the initial hospitalization and were considered to have been formed newly afterwards. Further, these findings were observed unexceptionally in all the radiated fields. The patient died 8 weeks after hospitalization, and no autopsy finding was obtained.

Hyperviscosity and hypoperfusion enhance thrombus formation promoting embolization of fresh thrombi. Hypoperfusion also reduces dissolution of emboli due to reduced flow velocity leading to classic hemodynamic patterns of stroke. To prove this concept further, we identified patients with severe hemodynamic compromise of either arterial or venous origin, or both, and natural or iatrogenic mechanisms of embolism. Three conditions were investigated in a stroke MRI protocol: 5 patients who had conventional cerebral angiography for the diagnosis of moyamoya disease, 1 patient with atrial fibrillation and thrombosis of the left transverse dural sinus and 1 patient with a patent foramen ovale with atrial septum aneurysm presenting with thrombosis of cortical cerebral veins.

Several reports have shown that intraplaque hemorrhage (IPH), which plays a pivotal role in plaque vulnerability, emits high signal intensity on T1-weighted images of high-resolution black-blood (BB) MRIs. When an MRI is used to screen for vulnerable plaque, a short scanning duration and a simple MRI protocol are required. This study assessed the utility of screening BB-MRI to detect IPH. Ninety-three consecutive cases with atherosclerotic carotid stenosis scheduled for carotid endarterectomy (CEA) or carotid artery stenting between January 2005 and December 2007 were included. High-resolution BB-MRI scans were obtained with 2D double-inversion recovery fast spin-echo sequences with cardiac gating. Screening BB-MRIs were performed with 3D gradient-echo sequences suppressing blood flow signals by radiofrequency wave spatial saturation over the scanning field of 3D time-of-flight MRA. The relative overall plaque signal intensities with reference to the sternocleidomastoid muscle were calculated, and the correlation of intensities on T1-weighted images between high-resolution BB-MRI and screening BB-MRI was investigated. We excluded 50 cases because of restenosis following CEA, use of a pacemaker, a long interval (>10 days) between high-resolution and screening BB-MRI examinations, or poor-quality images. Among the 43 cases included, the relative overall plaque signal intensity of high-resolution BB-MRI and screening BB-MRI were closely correlated (r = 0.568, p < 0.001). Screening BB-MRI can be an alternative to high-resolution BB-MRI in the assessment of IPH and may be a useful tool for detection of vulnerable plaque."

She had suffered from cerebral hemorrhage of the left putamen at the age of 58, of the left parietal lobe at 64 and cerebral infarction of right internal capsule at 71. EDS type II or III was suggested by two times of skin biopsies. A brain CT at the age of 73 revealed a comparatively large cerebral aneurysm in the territory of the anterior cerebral artery. The patient was treated conservatively, but died due to rupture of the aneurysm. The wall of the aneurysm was made up thin collagen fibers without elastic fibers. There were other multiple small aneurysms in the cerebral arteries, but none in other organs. Deposition of acid mucopolysaccharides was noted in the media of the abdominal aorta. Finally, the present case was thought most likely to be of EDS type IV. It was suggested that one of the causes of the cerebral hemorrhage at the ages of 58 and 64 and the infarction at 71 was related to hypertension, since brain MR angiography at 71 showed no clear aneurysms. In cases of EDS, one should consider the possible formation or rupture of cerebral aneurysm even though the course is favorable."

In this cases the cerebrospinal fluid examination could be dangerous because could reduce the intracranial pressure with consequent risk of aneurysm rupture. CSF drainage, although, improves the clinical conditions and the symptoms of the patients, seems to not reduce the incidence of permanent neurological deficits caused by vasospasm; on the contrary, it increases the incidence of hydrocephalus requiring shunt procedures. We conclude that routine ventriculostomy with external ventricular drainage should be considered for all patients with altered sensorium and acute hyrocephalus following subarachnoid haemorrhage, with improvement in outcome."

She presented with sudden onset of headache. Computed tomography demonstrated diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage, and cerebral angiography disclosed a left anterior choroidal artery aneurysm. The aneurysm was treated by endovascular embolization with Guglielmi detachable coils. During the embolization procedure, the microcatheter perforated the aneurysm. For direct closure of the perforation site with coils, the microcatheter was withdrawn and coils were deployed partially in the subarachnoid space and partially in the aneurysm sac. The coil mass was spread in the subarachnoid space around the aneurysm immediately after embolization. The patient was discharged with no neurological deficit. Three months later, follow-up radiography demonstrated obvious reduction in the size and compaction of the coil mass. Magnetic resonance angiography and digital subtraction angiography demonstrated stable occlusion of the aneurysm. The coil mass probably spread in the cistern around the aneurysm and was compacted by the shape memory of the coils and pulsation of the brain and vessels, as the subarachnoid clots around the aneurysm had disappeared. This case suggests that cisternal coil migration should be considered in the follow up of intracranial aneurysm treated with detachable coils."

It was successfully treated by endovascular occlusion of the affected site, including the aneurysm and parent artery, by using detachable coils. A follow-up angiography obtained seven months after the first treatment revealed the recanalization of the right vertebral artery and dissected aneurysm in an antegrade fashion. A skull X-ray image was useful for detecting the change in appearance of the coils. The second embolization was successfully performed in the same manner.

CD009372,0,22015965,0,Hyperdensity on non-contrast CT immediately after intra-arterial revascularization.,"Non-contrast enhanced computed tomography (NCCT) is usually performed to estimate bleeding complications immediately after procedures. However, hyperdense areas on NCCT have not yet been understood; different interpretations have been reported in the literature. It remains unclear whether NCCT performed immediately after intra-arterial revascularization (IAR) could be useful for predicting hemorrhagic transformation (HT) or clinical outcomes. Therefore, we investigated the diagnostic values of hyperdense areas on NCCT images obtained immediately after IAR. This was a retrospective study of acute ischemic stroke patients who underwent IAR between October 2007 and December 2010. NCCT scans were routinely obtained immediately after IAR and additional follow-up imaging protocols included diffusion weighted imaging (DWI)/gradient echo imaging (GRE) 24 h after IAR. HT was assessed by means of GRE obtained 24 h after IAR. Hounsfield Unit (HU) of the hyperdensity was measured in the manually drawn regions of interest. A total of 68 patients were analyzed in this study. Twenty-nine patients (42.6%) developed HT on follow-up images. Thirty-eight patients had hyperdense areas on NCCT immediately after IAR. Hyperdensity on NCCT performed immediately after IAR revealed 23 (60.5%) of the 38 patients with six false negative areas. NCCT performed immediately after IAR showed a sensitivity of 79.3%, a specificity of 61.5%, a positive predictive value of 60.5% and a negative predictive value of 80% for HT. The HU value was a predictor of HT without statistical significance (area under curve of 0.629; 95% CI: 0.49-0.76; p = 0.068). In addition, an HU of >90 poorly predicted HT with a low sensitivity (23%) and a high specificity (94%). In conclusion, our results showed that although hyperdensity on NCCT images obtained immediately after IAR had a moderate predictive value for HT, there were limitations to the prediction of subsequent parenchymal hematoma and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, with a low specificity and a low positive predictive value."
CD009372,0,8090273,0,[A case of polycystic kidney associated with new growth of cerebral aneurysm after aneurysmal operation].,"We have encountered a 66-year-old woman with a polycystic kidney (PCK). This was combined with the fact that the new growth of an aneurysm at the left anterior cerebral artery (A2-A3 junction) had ruptured 3 years after an operation for a right IC-PC aneurysm in 1985. The cause of the neogenesis and enlargement of an intracranial aneurysm is important because of the changes in the arterial wall due to congenital factors, hypertension, arteriosclerosis, etc, or hemodynamic stress caused by hypertension. We suspected that intracranial aneurysm formation was caused by hypertension due to PCK and the intracranial aneurysm is explained as being due to maldevelopment. In patients with PCK, it should be kept in mind that intracranial aneurysms may be present, and it is advisable to use cerebral angiography and MRA to see whether this is so or not. It should be also stressed that the control of hypertension is very important for the prognosis of patients with PCK. Not only new growth of cerebral aneurysms but also intracerebral hemorrhage is to be prevented."
CD009372,0,9819505,0,Primary intraventricular hemorrhage in adult--an analysis of 24 cases.,"Primary intraventricular hemorrhage in adults is rare, comprising only about 3.1 % of all intracranial hemorrhage. One of the major management tasks is to find out whether the hemorrhage is secondary to underlying structural vascular abnormality, such as arteriovenous malformation (AVM) and aneurysm, so that appropriate treatment can be carried out to prevent rebleeding. We retrospectively analyzed 24 patients with computerized tomography findings of intraventricular hemorrhage in our hospital from 1991 to 1996. Cerebral angiography was performed in eighteen patients. Eight patients (57%) had positive angiographic findings (five were AVM and three were aneurysm). The angiographic yield was five of seven patients (72%) younger than 45 years of age and three of eleven (27%) older than 45 years of age. On the basis of our results, we suggest that cerebral angiography should be considered for all primary intraventricular hemorrhage patients who are younger than 45 years old."

She was admitted to the department of pediatric hematology with a severe headache, vomiting, and progressive right flaccid hemiplegia and lethargy. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan showed subdural hematoma in posterior parietal region of the brain and impending cerebellar herniation. She was given fresh-frozen plasma (FFP) and then activated factor VII (rFVIIa), 80 microg/kg was infused for replacement of von Willebrand factor. The subdural hematoma was emergently drained. The results of coagulation tests before infusion of FFP and rFVIIa revealed hypofibrinogenemia, and FFP was given every 48 hours. The patient recovered dramatically in a few days. Five days after rFVIIa infusion, a magnetic resonance angiography-proven right middle cerebral arterial thrombosis developed.

CD009372,0,1256646,0,Cerebral cortical arteries in the diagnosis of epidural hematoma.,"Review of cerebral arteriograms of all our patients [19] with epidural hematoma over a 2 year period revealed evidence of localized extrinsic compression of the cerebral cortex in all cases. This finding, although not as specific as those previously described for epidural hematoma, was strongly suggestive. A 2 year prospective study was then initiated employing internal, rather than common carotid arteriography, because opacification of the external carotid artery is not necessary for evaluation of cortical compression. In this study, which consisted of 21 patients, epidural hematoma was correctly diagnosed in all, relying primarily on signs of localized extrinisic cerebral cortical compression. No epidural hematoma was misinterpreted as being a subdural hematoma or an intracerebral injury, and all epidural hematomas that were present were diagnosed correctly. We conclude that internal carotid arteriography is a sensitive method for diagnosing epidural hematoma. The signs of extrinsic cortical compression should be emphasized in the interpretation of arteriograms of patients with head injuries whether the internal or the common carotid artery is injected."
CD009372,0,21975501,0,The role of imaging studies for evaluation of stroke in children.,"Stroke is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in children and long-term neurological deficits. Although cerebrovascular disorders occur less often in children than in adults, recognition of stroke in children has probably increased because of the widespread application of noninvasive diagnostic studies such as magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography.Computed tomography (CT) should be the first imaging choice in the emergency setting when stroke is suspected. It will show the presence of hemorrhage (eg, bleeding from arteriovenous malformation). It is often normal within the first hours in arterial ischemic stroke. As in adults, magnetic resonance imaging is the neuroimaging modality to confirm the clinical diagnosis of ischemic stroke. In children, however, magnetic resonance imaging requires sedation and may not be as readily available as CT. Perfusion imaging demonstrates flow within the brain and can detect areas that are at risk of ischemia; however, further studies in the pediatric population need to be validated for this technique in children. Angiography detects arterial disease (eg, aneurysm); however, its use has been largely superseded by better magnetic resonance angiography, which is sensitive enough to visualize lesions in the proximal anterior cerebral artery, middle cerebral artery, and distal internal carotid artery (ICA). Magnetic resonance imaging using diffusion- weighted imaging is the most versatile and sensitive imaging technique for identifying ischemic lesions. In the future, we need to identify the pediatric patient presenting to the emergency department with an acute stroke and develop a pathway for the use of particular imaging techniques (eg, CT vs magnetic resonance imaging)."

CD009372,0,23945642,0,The emerging role of ferumoxytol-enhanced MRI in the management of cerebrovascular lesions.,"Inflammation is increasingly being understood to be a key component to the pathophysiology of cerebrovascular lesions. Ferumoxytol, an iron oxide nanoparticle coated by a carbohydrate shell, has been used in MRI studies as an inflammatory marker because it is cleared by macrophages. Ferumoxytol-enhanced MRI has emerged as an important tool for noninvasive assessment of the inflammatory status of cerebrovascular lesions, namely aneurysms and arteriovenous malformations. Moreover, preliminary evidence suggests that ferumoxytol-enhanced MRI could be applied as a non-invasive tool to differentiate ""unstable"" lesions that require early intervention from ""stable"" lesions in which observation may be safe. Assessment of the effects of anti-inflammatory pharmacological interventions on cerebrovascular lesions is also a potentially crucial application of the technique. Future improvements in technique and MRI signal quantification will certainly pave the way for widespread and efficient use of ferumoxytol-enhanced MRI in clinical practice. In this paper, we review current data regarding ferumoxytol-enhanced MRI and discuss its current/potential applications and future perspectives."
CD009372,0,1725812,0,Dynamic computed tomography for the evaluation of cerebrovascular disease.,"Dynamic computed tomography (DCT) was evaluated as a diagnostic indicator for chronic supratentorial ischemia in 50 cases with or without minor neurological deficits. Peak height (PH, the maximum value of the gamma fitted curve), peak time (PT, the time to PH from the start of DCT), transit time (TT, the time between the first and second inflection points of the gamma fitted curve), and their functional maps were analyzed. Cerebral angiography was then performed in all cases to identify stenotic or occlusive vascular lesions in major cerebral arteries. DCT clearly detected 12 of 13 occlusions of the internal carotid artery (ICA) or middle cerebral artery (MCA), although one ICA occlusion was masked by the contralateral MCA occlusion. However, DCT detected only severe ICA or MCA stenosis (more than 90%). Probably, stenotic lesions of less than 90% did not cause detectable hemodynamic compromise. DCT using PH, PT, and TT functional maps is a useful diagnostic method for hemodynamic changes in ischemic cerebrovascular disease, although bilateral lesions and less stenotic lesions (less than 90%) are difficult to detect."

CD009372,0,8333305,0,Intraventricular haemorrhage caused by aneurysms and angiomas.,"More than 200 intraventricular haematomas (IVH) have been treated in the Homburg Neurosurgical University Clinic since computed tomography was available and facilitated the diagnosis. Among 200 consecutive cases, which are analysed and presented in this publication, there were 71 patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH)--58 of whom with angiographically and/or pathologically verified aneurysms--, and 21 cases with intraventricular angiomas. IVH without concomitant intracerebral haematoma (ICH) and without evidence of SAH is highly suggestive of intraventricular angioma. In our experience panangiography [if available digital subtraction angiography (DAS)] should be done as soon as possible in all cases of IVH. It is a precondition for early diagnosis and operative elimination of the source of bleeding, because the retrospective analysis of our material shows that rebleeding is by far the highest single risk factor in cases with IVH caused by aneurysms or angiomas. We therefore recommend early microsurgical occlusion of the aneurysms and exstirpation or intravascular embolisation of the angioma. The best survival rate (76%) was achieved in IVH cases caused by angiomas. In aneurysms with IVH the survival rate was 35%, in IVH caused by other diseases 37%. The worst prognosis occurs in SAH with IVH without proven aneurysm or angioma. The survival rate of this group was only 8%."

With the advent of powerful software, CT and magnetic resonance angiography are complementing and, in some cases, even replacing DSA in the diagnostic evaluation of carotid atherostenosis, unruptured aneurysms, dissections, stroke, penetrating trauma to the neck, and dural venous sinus occlusive disease. They offer advantages over DSA not only in reduced morbidity and time-saving but also in assessment of brain parenchyma, quantitative perfusion, and abnormalities of vessel walls. In the evaluation of blunt neck injuries and intracranial vascular malformations, fistulas, and vasculitis, CT and magnetic resonance angiography still do not provide as much information as DSA."

X-ray of the skull showed no fracture but CT scans demonstrated a large frontal hematoma and interhemispheric bleeding. Initial cerebral angiography performed within 12 hours of trauma showed a small protrusion on the pericallosal portion of the left pericallosal artery with no branching point nearby. Angiography was repeated on the 9th day after admission and confirmed the presence of a saccular aneurysm of the pericallosal artery, which had been visible as a small protrusion on the initial angiogram. Traumatic aneurysm was suspected and successful neck clipping of the aneurysm was performed on the 14th day.

The results of R.A. and D.C.W. were compared with those of contrast carotid-angiography (C.A.). C.A. revealed stenosis above 50% or complete occlusion in 22% of cases, whereas D.C.W. and R.A. showed flow reduction in 27% and 48% of the cases respectively. In T.I.A., C.A. positivity went down to 8%; D.C.W. to 16%; and R.A. to 34%. In ""Complete Stroke"" positivity was 36% for C.A.; 41% for D.C.W.; and 62% for R.A. There was a high number of false positive findings with D.C.W. (8) but even more with R.A. (27). False negative findings occurred only in two cases with R.A. These data confirm the diagnostic value of these two noninvasive techniques to identify haemodynamically carotid stenosis. The use of both methods can reduce error due to false negativity. The rather marked frequency of false positivity, particularly with reference to R.A. doesn't affect the diagnostic value of the two methods."

It was found that the logical ""OR"" combination of slope function images, qualitative comparison of curves from irregular ROIs and quotient of the maxima of these curves is an ""acceptable"" processing method for clinicians with average experience in nuclear medicine. This was demonstrated by a comparison of ROC curves."

Using MR and CT, we studied 10 patients with sickle cell disease and a history of stroke and compared these findings with those of 10 sickle cell patients without stroke. The purpose was to determine if MR could visualize the large vessel vasculopathy previously seen on angiography and to estimate the incidence of asymptomatic abnormalities in the nonstroke group. MR consistently demonstrated the major intracranial arteries and showed three cases with occlusion and three with stenosis of either the internal carotid or middle cerebral arteries. Infarctions were better delineated on MR but were also seen on CT. Seven cases with and two without stroke had high-signal white matter lesions on MR. Further research using cranial MR to develop noninvasive means of identifying sickle cell patients at risk for stroke is warranted."
CD009372,0,22994214,0,"Advanced multimodal CT/MRI approaches to hyperacute stroke diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring.","Multimodal CT/MRI has dramatically changed the approach to ischemic stroke management, as noninvasive CT/MRI images detail brain tissue or parenchyma, angiography or vessel status, and collateral perfusion or blood flow in regions of the brain vulnerable to ischemic injury. Such snapshots of the dynamic process of cerebral ischemia may be used to gauge reversibility and therapeutic opportunities. Treatment of acute stroke may be rapidly tailored to clinical scenarios based on imaging correlation of ischemia, vessel status, and perfusion. Serial or repeated imaging from the initial presentation to later stages of the hospital course may illustrate infarct growth, persisting occlusion, reocclusion, recanalization, reperfusion, and hemorrhagic transformation. From acute stroke to rehabilitation phases and subsequent prevention, multimodal CT/MRI has emerged as a key tool to track the process of stroke and the impact of our therapeutic interventions."

We present a detailed history and clinical course of a patient with PCNSV along with a literature review. A 50-year-old Chinese female presented with a 6-month history of mild to moderate headache and sudden onset of visual loss. Early computed tomography of the brain showed multifocal infarctions. Over 3 weeks after admission, her clinical presentations changed considerably and her condition deteriorated. She became confused then fell in to semicoma, and developed left-sided paralysis and quadriparesis. At about 7 months after her illness, a magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed a tumour-like mass lesion within the right parietal lobe resulting in compressed posterior horn of the right lateral ventricle. In the end, a brain biopsy identified extensive vessel inflammation, which established the diagnosis of PCNSV. Steroid and immunosuppressive therapy dramatically improved the patient's condition. Our report highlights the importance of considering PCNSV as a differential diagnosis in patients who are suspected with encephalitis, multiple sclerosis, cerebral haemorrhage, cerebral thrombus, leukoencephalopathy, or brain tumour, etc. while their clinical presentations are exceptionally so changeable.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between renal function and intracranial arterial stenosis (IAS). We analyzed the records of 283 stroke-free Korean adults (≥45 years of age) who underwent brain 3D time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography as part of their voluntary health check. The presence of stenosis in the basilar artery and in the horizontal portion of the middle cerebral artery was defined as narrowing of the luminal diameter by 25% or more or occlusion on brain magnetic resonance angiography. We estimated the glomerular filtration rate using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation. The subjects were 133 men and 150 women (mean age of 56 ± 7 years). One hundred sixty-six subjects (59 %) had IAS. The serum creatinine concentration in the highest quartile compared with the lowest quartile was associated with increased prevalence of IAS; the eGFR in the upper two quartiles compared with the lowest quartile were associated with decreased prevalence of IAS. The prevalence of subjects with a high eGFR decreased significantly with the severity of IAS. In conclusion, poor renal function is associated with the presence and the degree of IAS in stroke-free Korean adults."

CD009372,0,3357564,0,Dynamic CT of micro- and macroangiopathic states of the cerebrum.,"Dynamic computed tomography utilizing intravenous contrast agents affords a unique opportunity to evaluate pathologic vascular states of the cerebrum in cross-section with an imaging system which is more contrast-sensitive than either conventional film-screen or digital subtraction angiography. Dynamic scanning therefore routinely allows the non-invasive detection of pathologic vascularity in-vivo in lesions that could previously only be detected reliably primarily with in-vitro techniques. The first section of this two part report examines the microscopic vascularity observed in active demyelination, inflammatory states, trauma, infarction and other forms of acquired cerebral disease. In the second section, the ability of intravenous dynamic cranial computed tomography to detect macroscopic pathologic vascularity is reviewed. The diagnostic principles of conventional angiography apply in this technique except that the lesion is viewed in cross-section, rather than in-toto with all structures superimposed. The method therefore yields a true tomographic angiogram. Abnormal vascular states associated with malignancies, vascular malformations, aneurysms, and vascular occlusions are simply evaluated and correlate precisely with the aberrant vascular patterns revealed angiographically."

CD009372,0,21878694,0,[Diagnostic imaging of cerebrovascular disease on multi-detector row computed tomography (MDCT)].,"In this study, we reviewed characteristic diagnostic findings of vascular diseases in the central nervous system with 3-dimensional computed tomographic angiography (3D-CTA) using multi-detector row computed tomography (MDCT) and a novel 320-row area detector CT (320-ADCT). With coverage of 160 mm in a single rotation, 320-ADCT enables acquisition of both 4-dimensional CT angiography (dynamic 4D-CTA) and whole-brain CT perfusion imaging. We describe our experience of investigating cerebrovascular diseases with MDCT and 320-ADCT, as well as several postprocessing techniques to acquire images useful for diagnosis, therapy planning, and simulation of neurosurgical and endovascular intervention. 3D-CTA demonstrates has high accuracy in detecting and evaluating cerebral aneurysms and steno-occlusive diseases. Angiographic analysis, including information of surrounding tissues on 3D-CTA, allows assessment of the feasibility of neurosurgical or endovascular approaches and the technique to accomplish the therapy. However, 3D-CTA using MDCT is limited in its detection of aneurysms less than 3 mm in size and aneurysms embedded in the skull base region. In addition, discrimination between intradural paraclinoid aneurysms and extradural intracavernous aneurysms remains an unresolved problem in imaging of cerebral aneurysms. 320-ADCT may solve this problem with its high accuracy in discriminating arteries from the venous system. 3D-CTA could be used as an alternative to DSA for detection of severe carotid artery disease. 3D-CTA enables measurement of the lesions, plaque imaging, prediction of anatomical variants, screening for asymptomatic vascular lesions, and exclusion of patients with risk factors from carotid endoarterectomy (CEA) or carotid artery stenting (CAS). The diagnosis of intracranial dural arteriovenous fistula (DAVF) with CTA is challenging. Recently, several authors proposed diagnostic findings of ADVF by CTA and reported high sensitivity and specificity. 320-ADCT may offer comprehensive information for diagnosis and therapy planning of intracranial DAVF. Although DSA is a standard modality to detect spinal vascular malformations, selective catheterization requires considerable time and a certain amount of contrast medium, and is associated with a risk of neurological complications. Spinal 3D-CTA prior to DSA is useful in selective catheterization to arteries at certain spinal levels as well as when considering treatment options and therapy planning."
CD009372,0,21878697,0,[Progress in NIRS monitoring of cerebral blood flow].,"Various studies have demonstrated the usefulness of near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) for detecting cerebral ischemia during a carotid endarterectomy; however, it is difficult to apply NIRS to the diagnosis of ischemic stroke, since commercially available NIRS, which uses continuous-wave light, does not provide quantitative values of baseline hemoglobin (Hb) concentrations. In contrast, time-resolved near-infrared spectroscopy (TRS) permits quantitative measurement of Hb concentrations. We applied TRS to detection of cerebra vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). We investigated 11 age-matched controls and 14 aneurysmal SAH patients that comprised 10 patients with World Federation of Neurological Societies (WFNS) grade V and 4 patients with WFNS grade II. Employing TR-NIRS, we measured the cortical oxygen saturation (CoSO2) and baseline Hb concentrations in the middle cerebral artery territory. The CoSO2 and Hb concentrations remained stable after SAH in 6 patients; digital subtraction angiography (DSA) did not reveal vasospasm in these patients. In 8 patients, however, CoSO2 and total Hb decreased abruptly between 5 and 9 days after SAH. DSA revealed diffuse vasospasms in 6 of 8 patients. The reduction of CoSO2 predicted occurrence of vasospasm at a cutoff value of 3.9%-6.4% with 100% sensitivity and 85.7% specificity. Trans cranial Doppler (TCD) failed to detect vasospasm in 4 cases, whereas TR-NIRS could. Finally, TRS performed on day 1 after SAH revealed significantly higher CoSO2 than that of the controls (p = 0.048), but there was no significant difference in total Hb. TRS detected vasospasm by evaluating the CBO in the cortex and may be more sensitive than TCD, which assesses the blood flow velocity in the M1 portion. TRS may be useful for the diagnosis of ischemic events in stroke patients."

A CT scan and MRI showed a cerebral hematoma located in the right frontoparietal region. Twelve days later he was transferred to our hospital. Although a CT scan, MRI, and cerebral angiography were repeated, they did not reveal any abnormality regarding an etiology. Only persistently abnormal finding in laboratory studies was positive for lupus anticoagulant and anticardiolipin antibody, i.e. antiphospholipid antibodies. There was no serological evidence of SLE or other autoimmune diseases. Stereotactic biopsy of the hematoma wall and scalp artery showed no abnormality. Based on above findings we conclude that antiphospholipid antibodies have played an important role for the hemorrhage.

By calculating the annual growth rate of aneurysms in long-term follow-up angiography (partly supplemented with MR-imaging and/or MR-angiography), we attempted to determine the surgical indications for these aneurysms. Long-term follow-up angiography ranging from one to 20 years was carried out on five patients whose ruptured aneurysms had been incompletely occluded, six patients with multiple aneurysms, of which the ruptured ones had been completely obliterated at operation and the small unruptured aneurysms, missed or misdiagnosed, and eight patients with unruptured aneurysms which were asymptomatic or symptomatic. The correlation of annual aneurysm growth rate to subsequent bleeding was investigated. Four out of six fast-growing aneurysms with high annual growth rates (more than 8% increase per year) resulted in subsequent bleeding whereas none of the fourteen slow-growing aneurysms with low annual growth rates (less than 8% increase per year) led to bleeding (Fisher's exact test; p < 0.01). Hypertension, patient age and aneurysmal location showed no significant correlation to the annual growth rate (Fisher's exact test; p > 0.05). This study suggests that aneurysmal rests after incomplete surgery and missed or misdiagnosed multiple or incidental aneurysms which are fast growing have a high possibility of subsequent bleeding and should be operated on as soon as possible."

This gave rise to the suspicion of a spontaneously ruptured cerebral aneurysm that might have caused the patient's accident. Preceding the evacuation of the hematoma, cerebral angiography ruled out the suspected vascular malformation, but revealed a pseudoaneurysm of the middle meningeal artery close to a skull fracture.

Various complications of this condition have been observed, such as cortical subarachnoid hemorrhages (cSAH), intracerebral hemorrhages, reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy, ischaemic strokes and transient ischaemic attacks. It is important to include RCVS in thunderclap headache differential diagnosis and among non-aneurismatic subarachnoid hemorrhage causes. In the past years, thanks to the major diffusion of new diagnostic tools such as magnetic resonance, computed tomography and digital subtraction angiography, RCVS have been demonstrated to be more frequent than previously thought. We report an illustrative case of a woman affected by a small cSAH, associated to RCVS, after elective triplet cesarean delivery. To our knowledge, this is the first case of cSAH associated to RCVS after a triplet pregnancy."

CD009372,0,8166011,0,Fibromuscular dysplasia of arteries of the head and neck: imaging findings.,"Cephalocervical fibromuscular dysplasia is an uncommon vascular disease that affects less than 1% of the population. Although often an incidental finding, patients may present with transient ischemic attacks, cerebral infarctions, or subarachnoid hemorrhage. Fibromuscular dysplasia is usually diagnosed in the fourth or fifth decade of life; it occurs in women more often than in men and in whites more frequently than in blacks. The purpose of this essay is to illustrate the broad spectrum of neuroimaging findings seen on CT scans, MR images, and angiograms of patients with cephalocervical fibromuscular dysplasia. The value of MR imaging in distinguishing tubular fibromuscular dysplasia from arterial dissection and arterial hypoplasia is demonstrated."

They were shown to have dural arteriovenous fistulae related to the cavernous sinus. Intracerebral haemorrhage occurred in both patients within 18 months of presentation; this gave rise to focal seizures and signs of unilateral hemisphere dysfunction. The haematomas were in the region drained by the superficial middle cerebral vein ipsilateral to the shunt and are presumed to have been the result of locally raised venous pressure."
CD009372,0,9766041,0,Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography of cerebral arteries. A review.,"The loss of blood vessel visibility due to the signal saturation of slow flow can be partially overcome by the T1 reduction that occurs with the use of contrast agents such as Gd-DTPA during magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) studies. Dynamic-imaging techniques that have been applied successfully in abdominal imaging may also be useful for intracranial applications. However, the time between arterial and venous enhancement is very short during intracranial circulation. This limits the spatial resolution that can be obtained between arterial and venous enhancement. Fortunately, the blood-brain barrier and the relatively long duration of significant decrease in blood T1 has led to the development of very high resolution intracranial MRA techniques. Knowledge of the contrast-agent dilution factors and the ultimate resulting relaxation rates can be used to optimize the imaging parameters to maximize vessel signal relative to the background signal (the signal-difference-to-noise ratio). The additional venous vascular detail in the contrast-enhanced study can be spatially resolved in the 3D image data and determined by incorporating information from both high-resolution precontrast and postcontrast studies. In this article, the history, development and application of contrast agents in MRA are presented."

CD009372,0,21212661,0,Evaluation of symptomatic carotid plaques by tissue characterization using integrated backscatter ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging.,Unstable carotid plaques that consist of large lipid pool and intraplaque hemorrhage are more likely to cause cerebral infarction. We previously developed an integrated backscatter (IBS) ultrasound color-coded mapping method to evaluate the tissue characteristics of plaques. The purpose of this study was to determine whether 3-dimensional IBS color-coded mapping and signal intensity ratio (SIR) from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) could distinguish the early symptomatic plaques from late symptomatic plaques.
CD009372,0,22271362,0,Spot sign score predicts rapid bleeding in spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage.,"This study was conducted to determine whether spot sign score correlates with average rate of hematoma expansion and whether average rate of expansion predicts in-hospital mortality and clinical outcome in spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). The study included 367 patients presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) from January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2008 with nontraumatic ICH. All received noncontrast computed tomography (NCCT) of the head and multidetector CT angiography (MDCTA) on presentation to the ED and a follow-up NCCT within 48 h. Imaging was used to determine the hematoma location and volume, average rate of expansion, and spot sign score. Primary outcome measures included in-hospital mortality and clinical outcome based on modified Rankin Scale at 3 months or at discharge. Regression analysis was performed to correlate spot sign score and average rate of hematoma expansion. ICH expansion was identified in 194 of 367 patients (53%). In a multivariate analysis, rate of ICH expansion predicted mortality (hazard ratio 1.1, CI 1.08-1.12, p < 0.0001). Patients who expired had an average rate of ICH expansion of 2.8 ml/h compared to 0.2 ml/h in survivors. Spot sign score on presentation to the ED correlated with the average rate of hematoma expansion. Average rate of hematoma expansion predicts mortality in spontaneous ICH. Spot sign score on presentation correlates with rate of expansion, supporting the hypothesis that high spot sign scores likely reflect active bleeding in acute ICH."

Computed tomography showed an intraventricular hemorrhage and slightly dilated lateral ventricles. Her neurological examinations revealed no abnormalities. Magnetic resonance (MR) images and cerebral angiography revealed arteriovenous malformation (AVM) in the right parietal lobe. The size of the nidus was 1.8 cm, and it was located in the deep white matter. It was fed by middle cerebral arteries and drained by the vein of Galen. Diffusion tensor tractography (DTT) demonstrated that the right pyramidal tract was situated close to the nidus. The AVM was surgically resected completely, without any complications, using intraoperative neuronavigation image guidance. Neuronavigation images combined with DTT are useful for surgical resection of AVM that is located close to the pyramidal tract."

CD009372,0,18812685,0,Cervical perimedullary arteriovenous fistula in an infant presenting with subarachnoid hemorrhage--case report.,"A 9-month-old boy was transferred to our institute after suffering sudden seizure and loss of consciousness followed by cardiopulmonary arrest. Neurological examination on admission revealed deep coma and tetraparesis. Brain computed tomography revealed diffuse intracranial subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), whereas brain magnetic resonance (MR) angiography showed no intracranial abnormalities. MR imaging of the spine demonstrated a remarkable flow void extending from C3 to T1. Digital subtraction angiography revealed a perimedullary arteriovenous fistula (AVF) fed by the left thyrocervical trunk, associated with a varix and a dilated perimedullary vein. He had hypoxic encephalopathy due to transient cardiopulmonary arrest, and remained in the intensive care unit for 2 months. Thereafter, he was transferred to the pediatric ward, where his general condition improved, and after 7 months underwent embolization of the AVF to prevent further SAH. The perimedullary AVF was successfully interrupted by transarterial embolization with n-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate and platinum coils, and no additional neurological deficits developed. Post-embolization MR imaging showed loss of the flow void. The favorable outcome demonstrates the importance of spinal cord imaging in infants with SAH without other intracranial abnormalities to detect the presence of perimedullary AVF. Perimedullary AVFs in children are often associated with huge fistulas and varices, so are good candidates for endovascular surgery."

CD009372,0,9673972,0,[Extravasation of contrast medium in local intra-arterial fibrinolysis of the carotid territory].,"The safety of fibrinolytic therapy is determined with the incidence of intraparenchymatous hemorrhage. When interpreting CT studies after local intra-arterial fibrinolysis (LIF) in the carotid territory, one must consider that a hyperdense lesion may also be caused by extravasation of contrast material during angiography. In this study we retrospectively analyzed CT scans of 24 patients performed within 24 h after LIF and correlated the results with clinical and angiographic findings before and after therapy. Three of 24 patients (12.5%) showed striatocapsular parenchymal hematomas, 2 patients died and 1 showed marked clinical deterioration. Fifteen of 24 patients (62.5%) showed hyperdense lesions without space-occupying effect within striatocapsular infarctions. In 6 of these patients (25%) these lesions were attributable to an extravasation of contrast medium during angiography. This extravasation required at least partial recanalization of the middle cerebral artery and always occurred within a striatocapsular infarction. The pathogenesis of extravasation of contrast medium during local intra-arterial fibrinolysis is unknown. The identification of these lesions, however, is essential for the assessment of safety of local intra-arterial fibrinolysis."

The diagnosis of SAH rested on a typical history and the demonstration of blood in the cerebrospinal fluid (computed tomography (CT), lumbar puncture). Initial CT and four-vessel angiography were performed in all patients, and five had repeat angiography. Endocrinological assessment was done after the initial angiography, and abnormal findings from this first study were reassessed 3 months later. The follow-up study included a high resolution CT scan of the sellar region. One patient had panhypopituitarism. Insufficient growth hormone secretion alone or combined with a low plasma concentration of estradiol or testosterone was found in another seven patients. The sella was ballooned or enlarged in three patients, and four patients had at follow-up a partly empty sella. A spontaneous development of a partly empty sella from an adenoma with suprasellar extension was observed in the patient with panhypopituitarism. This patient had experienced pituitary apoplexy with resulting SAH. Based on sellar enlargement, an empty sella, and pituitary dysfunction, this pathogenesis was suggested in another three patients. Our findings suggest that hemorrhagic necrosis in a pituitary adenoma may be an important cause of SAH with normal angiography."

Case report.,"Intracranial dural arteriovenous fistula (DAVF) is rare and potentially life-threatening disease often presenting as vascular myelopathy. The early and proper diagnosis is challenging because the clinical manifestations are related to the distribution of the draining vein, not the fistula site, and imaging findings are similar to demyelinating disease of the spinal cord. The authors present the case of a 45-year-old man who developed acute progressive quadriplegia and respiratory difficulty with an enhancing, longitudinally extensive cervical cord lesion. These symptoms were highly suspicious for transverse myelitis but were caused by an intracranial DAVF. Intracranial DAVF with venous reflux to the brainstem and spinal cord is a rare but important differential diagnosis of progressive worsening myelopathy that is treatment resistant and gives the diagnostic impression of transverse myelitis."

A CT scan is the most sensitive method of detecting acute subarachnoid, parenchymal, and intraventricular hemorrhages. Small aneurysms are inconsistently visualized on MR scans. Angiography remains the standard for complete and accurate depiction of patent aneurysms, as well as of arteriovenous and venous malformations that have not thrombosed. Giant and thrombosed aneurysms present as mass lesions and are frequently detected when MR is used as a screening examination. Often MRI characterizes these lesions better than CT or angiography. Patients with vascular malformations who have focal neurologic symptoms without hemorrhage are best evaluated with MRI. Patent vascular malformations demonstrating flow void and other flow-related phenomena are readily demonstrated. Occult vascular malformations, including thrombosed arteriovenous, venous, and cavernous malformations and telangiectasia, are also best detected by MRI and are not visible on angiography."

CD009372,0,16180701,0,Volume subtraction three-dimensional CT angiography for cerebrovascular disease: report of two cases.,"We report two cases in which volume subtraction three-dimensional CT angiography (VS-3DCTA) was used for cerebral aneurysm and vascular stenosis with intramural calcification. Case 1: VS-3DCTA with volume rendering clearly showed carotid cave aneurysm of the internal carotid artery. The location and size of the aneurysm was confirmed by digital subtraction angiography (DSA). In evaluation of the aneurysm, VS-3DCTA was equal to DSA and endovascular findings. Case 2: VS-3DCTA with volume rendering clearly showed stenosis of the middle cerebral artery, and intramural calcification with the cause of the stenosis was subtracted. On the other hand, it was difficult for DSA to reveal the stenosis because of the limitation of the imaging angle. In evaluation of the stenosis, VS-3DCTA was superior to DSA. VS-3DCTA was an important diagnostic tool that enabled visualization of the aneurysm in the area of the skull base and stenosis of the intracerebral artery."
CD009372,0,7099381,0,[Traumatic aneurysm of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (author's transl)].,"The incidence of traumatic intracranial aneurysms are rare. In review of literature, only six cases of traumatic aneurysms in posterior fossa are reported. The patient, 15-year-old girl, was admitted on Dec. 18th, 1979, presented with unconsciousness after a traffic accident. She was developed impaired consciousness and left hemiparesis with right hemotympanum and nasal bleeding. Skull film showed an occipital linear fracture and a laminal fracture of the atlas. CT scan demonstrated traumatic subarachnoid, intraventricular hemorrhage and pneumocephalus. After accident, she regained consciousness with conservative therapy, but she deteriorated on the 10th hospitalized day. On the 17th day, lumbar puncture and CT scan revealed recurrent subarachnoid and intraventricular hemorrhage. The saccular aneurysm on the lateral medullary segment of the right posterior inferior cerebellar artery was obtained by cerebral angiogram on the 35th day. The configuration and size of the aneurysm was easily demonstrated by CT scans and cerebral angigrams. On the 43rd day, the clipping of the common trunk of the right posterior inferior cerebellar artery was employed. Her postoperative course was uneventful and she was discharged on the 97th day in good condition. This aneurysm was suggested to be induced by severe head injury with clinical ad operative findings. With the introduction of CT scan, CT scan is more available diagnostic modality than cerebral angiography in the follow up study with severe head injuries. And in the absence of pathological CT scan findings, suspicion of traumatic cerebrovascular impairments such as aneurysm should be paid. As the conservative management of traumatic intracranial aneurysms carries high mortality rate up to 30-50%, the prompt diagnosis and direct surgical intervention are recommended."

CD009372,0,1419338,0,[Hyponatremia and cerebral vasospasm in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage].,"We studied retrospectively the relationship between hyponatremia and cerebral vasospasm in 121 consecutive patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. In 19 patients sodium levels fell below 130 mEq/l on at least two consecutive days. Hyponatremia developed at average 8.9 hospital day and lasted for 4.4 days. It was mild (126 to 130 mEq/l) in 15 patients, moderate (121 to 125 mEq/l) in 3 patients, and severe (116 to 120 mEq/l) in 1 patient. Cerebral vasospasm was evaluated by angiography, symptoms and CT finding. Angiographical vasospasm was found in 57 patients, symptomatic vasospasm in 38 patients and low density area on CT in 20 patients. Angiographical vasospasm developed in 15 of the 19 patients (78.9%) with hyponatremia, symptomatic vasospasm in 16 patients (84.2%), low density area on CT in 8 patients (42.1%), the difference being significantly high. (respectively, p < 0.01, p < 0.001 and p < 0.01 by chi-square test) Polyuria of 2500 ml or more immediately before the onset of hyponatremia developed in 14 patients (87.5%). When symptomatic vasospasm and hyponatremia coincided, there were only 4 patients in which symptomatic vasospasm was preceded by hyponatremia. So, it is difficult to predict the development of vasospasm from that of hyponatremia. This study found incidence of cerebral vasospasm after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage to be significantly higher in patients who developed hyponatremia, which raised suspicion about the presence of dehydration. Hyponatremia with central origin generally remains asymptomatic, but it is important to treat positively when the pathology of cerebral vasospasm is taken into consideration."

The tree-definition process can automatically exclude erroneous vessel segmentations. The parent-child connectivity information provided by our vessel trees is important to both surgical planning and to guidance of endovascular procedures. We evaluated the branch connection accuracy of our 3D vessel trees by asking two neuroradiologists to evaluate 140 parent-child connections comprising seven vascular trees against 17 digital subtraction angiography (DSA) views. Each reviewer rated each connection as (1) Correct, (2) Incorrect, (3) Partially correct (a minor error without clinical significance), or (4) Indeterminate. Analysis was summarized for each evaluator by calculating 95% confidence intervals for both the proportion completely correct and the proportion clinically acceptable (completely or partially correct). In order to protect the overall Type I error rate, alpha-splitting was done using a top down strategy. We additionally evaluated segmentation completeness by examining each slice in 11 MRA datasets in order to determine unlabeled vessels identifiable in cross-section following segmentation. Results indicate that only one vascular parent-child connection was judged incorrect by both reviewers. MRA segmentations appeared complete within MRA resolution limits. We conclude that our methods permit creation of detailed vascular trees from segmented 3D image data. We review the literature and compare other approaches to our own. We provide examples of clinically useful visualizations enabled by our methodology and taken from a visualization program now in clinical use."

The headache and neck pain persisted for 3 weeks, then disappeared. Cranial magnetic resonance (MR) image obtained 4 weeks after the onset demonstrated intramural hematoma adjacent to intracranial left vertebral artery. MR image did not show any abnormal lesions in the brain parenchyma. Although cranial MR angiography did not show any definite aneurysms, three-dimensional CT angiography (3D-CTA) obtained 6 weeks after the onset disclosed an aneurysm of the left vertebral artery. The vessel distal to the aneurysm was occluded. Because the left posterior inferior cerebellar artery originated from the aneurysm, we did not perform embolization using coils. Spontaneous dissecting aneurysm of the left vertebral artery was diagnosed based on the clinical, MR image, and 3D-CTA findings. The systolic blood pressure was maintained under 130 mmHg using antihypertensive agents. Thereafter, 3D-CTA obtained 6 months after the onset showed recanalization of the occluded vessel distal to the aneurysm. The size of the aneurysm was unchanged.

Combined Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD)-perfusion experiments were applied in order to evaluate the relative sensitivity of these techniques to task-related reductions in cerebral blood flow (CBF). Results shows that, by matching the sensitivity of the methods (which exhibit a different contrast-to-noise ratio) in the primary motor cortex, the spatial extent of the regions of decreased perfusion signal is larger than those of the BOLD signal reduction. The above finding suggests that perfusion imaging, that already represents a gold standard method in the detection of vascular phenomena, may estimate task-related flow decreases in a functional time-series better than BOLD."

Follow-up showed that 40% of patients were able to resume their previous occupation. Relapses were observed in cases with disseminated lupus erythematosus and endocarditis. The relatively low rate of clarified cases (42%) is partly due to selection but also to the gaps in diagnostic knowledge. Accordingly, a stepwise diagnostic program was set up, based upon urgency and technical expenditure, that took into account not only the minimal needs for a sound initial diagnosis but also the extensive differential diagnoses for less common causes of stroke."

CD009372,0,22532547,0,Cerebral vasculopathy in children with neurofibromatosis type 1.,"Cerebral vasculopathy is an important but underrecognized complication of neurofibromatosis type 1. Over a 10-year period, we retrospectively assessed the prevalence, clinical manifestations, management, and outcome of cerebral vasculopathy in children with neurofibromatosis type 1. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain was performed on 78% of the patients (312/398) of which 46% (143/312) had magnetic resonance angiography of the intracranial arteries; 4.8% (15/312) had cerebral vasculopathy. Approximately half were asymptomatic at presentation; none had neurologic deficits. Cerebral vasculopathy included moyamoya changes (7) and stenosis/occlusion of major intracranial arteries (8). On follow-up (mean 4 years), 2 patients developed radiologic progression; 1 was treated with aspirin alone, whereas another underwent revascularization surgery. Although cerebral vasculopathy in neurofibromatosis type 1 may be asymptomatic at presentation, there may be radiologic and clinical progression leading to morbidity and mortality. Magnetic resonance angiography should be considered with brain MRI for early detection and timely intervention of cerebral vasculopathy."

CD009372,0,20004607,0,Automated detection of intracranial aneurysms based on parent vessel 3D analysis.,"The detection of brain aneurysms plays a key role in reducing the incidence of intracranial subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) which carries a high rate of morbidity and mortality. The majority of non-traumatic SAH cases is caused by ruptured intracranial aneurysms and accurate detection can decrease a significant proportion of misdiagnosed cases. A scheme for automated detection of intracranial aneurysms is proposed in this study. Applied to the segmented cerebral vasculature, the method detects aneurysms as suspect regions on the vascular tree, and is designed to assist diagnosticians with their interpretations and thus reduce missed detections. In the current approach, the vessels are segmented and their medial axis is computed. Small regions along the vessels are inspected and the writhe number is introduced as a new surface descriptor to quantify how closely any given region approximates a tubular structure. Aneurysms are detected as non-tubular regions of the vascular tree. The geometric assumptions underlying the approach are investigated analytically and validated experimentally. The method is tested on 3D-rotational angiography (3D-RA) and computed tomography angiography (CTA). In our experiments, 100% sensitivity was achieved with average false positives rates of 0.66 per study on 3D-RA data and 5.36 false positive rates per study on CTA data."

A simultaneous angiographic study discloses their strong correlation.","Cerebral artery stenosis (CAS) has the same pathogenesis as coronary artery disease (CAD), but the coexistence of these two diseases has been rarely reported. To detect coexistent CAS in CAD patients, we conducted a study of simultaneous coronary and cerebral angiography. Of the 663 consecutive newly diagnosed CAD patients who had not yet been explored to have CAS, 80 were admitted to undergo angiography of bilateral carotid and vertebral system during the same procedure. We defined significant vascular stenosis, either located intracranially or extracranially, as the lesions of diameter stenosis more than 50%. Association between carotid or vertebral stenosis and their potential risk factors were also analyzed. Of our patients, 18 (22.5%) had significant extracranial vascular stenosis, 14 (17.5%) suffered from intracranial stenosis, and 20 (25%) had both. Only 28 patients (35%) had no significant intracranial or extracranial stenosis. None of the demographic parameters as hypertension or diabetes showed significant differences between the cerebral patent group and the CAS group, except for the number of coronary stenotic vessels (1.71 +/- 0.81 versus 2.69 +/- 0.64, P < 0.001). The number of coronary stenotic vessels is correlated well to the number of cerebral stenotic lesions (r = 0.562, P < 0.001). Besides, 8 of the cerebral stenotic patients and 2 of the cerebral patent patients had ischemic stroke previously. We conclude the CAS is coexistent in more than half of the CAD patients in this study. Our study also implies a proportional increase in the severity of CAS to CAD severity."

CD009372,0,22133741,0,A case of embolic stroke imitating atherothrombotic brain infarction before massive hemorrhage from an infectious aneurysm caused by Streptococci.,"Early detection followed by treatment with antibiotics in conjunction with direct or endovascular surgery is integral in the management of patients with intracranial infectious aneurysms. These aneurysms often manifest as massive intracranial hemorrhages, which severely deteriorate the outcome. It is very important to detect infectious aneurysms before they rupture. Although usually associated with infective endocarditis, these aneurysms can occur in a variety of clinical settings. We present a case of α-Streptococcus-provoked infectious aneurysm in a patient without infective endocarditis, initially presenting as atherothrombotic-like brain infarction, before massive intracranial hemorrhage.

CD009372,0,2688197,0,Anterior cerebral artery velocity changes in disease of the middle cerebral artery stem.,"Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography can map the changes in blood velocity that result from stenosis or occlusion of the middle cerebral artery. To evaluate patterns of collateral blood flow in disease of the middle cerebral artery stem, we used both cerebral angiography and transcranial Doppler ultrasonography to study the systolic blood velocities in both anterior cerebral arteries in 10 consecutive patients with middle cerebral artery stenosis or occlusion. Five patients had no evidence of hemodynamically significant carotid disease and good-quality measurements of systolic velocity in each anterior cerebral artery. Two of the five patients had middle cerebral artery stem stenosis and the other three had occlusion. The ratios of mean blood velocity in the normal compared with the abnormal side for the five patients (mean 1.34 +/- 0.23, range 1.15-1.74) were significantly higher than ratios for 10 controls (mean 1.04 +/- 0.12, range 0.76 +/- 1.19) using an unpaired t test (t = 3.492, 0.0005 less than p less than 0.005). Our results suggest that transcranial Doppler ultrasound measurements of anterior cerebral artery blood velocity may be a useful index of collateral blood flow from the anterior cerebral artery territory into the middle cerebral artery territory. Changes in mean velocity ratio may document the evolution and adequacy of collateral blood flow over the cerebral convexity in middle cerebral artery stem disease. In addition, the changes in anterior cerebral artery blood velocity appear to be an important corroborative finding for middle cerebral artery stem occlusion."

We prospectively investigated 103 patients with acute stroke in the posterior circulation. All patients underwent CTA and Doppler ultrasound, and DSA was performed in 22 patients. Vascular findings were classified in categories according to the type of lesion and the location in the vertebral, basilar, or posterior cerebral artery. In the first part of the analysis we examined the correlation between CTA and intra-arterial DSA (n=22), and in the second part that between CTA and Doppler ultrasound (n=103). Intra-arterial DSA identified 11 stenoses, 13 occlusions, and 3 hypoplasias. The correlation between DSA and CTA was best for the basilar artery (all lesions were identified with CTA). Of the 14 lesions detected in the vertebral artery by DSA 13 were also detected by CTA, but the specific type of lesion was identified in only 7 cases. The correlation between CTA and Doppler ultrasound was lower. In conclusion, CTA is thus a reliable method for detecting lesions in the posterior circulation and may replace DSA in many cases. However, particularly in the vertebral artery DSA remains the superior technique."

On the basis of magnetic resonance imaging, magnetic resonance angiography, single photon emission computed tomography, and cerebral angiographic findings, 3 children were diagnosed as having infarctions due to moyamoya disease, and the others as having idiopathic infarctions. Serologic studies revealed elevated anticardiolipin antibody (ACA) IgG in 3 of the 5 patients with idiopathic infarction; no such elevation was revealed in patients with moyamoya disease. Values for all other tests, including ACA IgM and lupus anticoagulant, were within normal limits or negative in all patients. ACA IgG, therefore, may be a more important causative agent of childhood strokes than was previously considered."
CD009372,0,19342828,0,Relevance of neuroimaging in the evaluation of cerebral ischemia.,"The rapid development of neuroimaging techniques has provided us with a wide range of tools for the assessment of patients who may have experienced cerebrovascular events. Each of these technologies provides specific and potentially informative insights. For clinical practice, however, we always have to tailor our diagnostic approach according to a maximum benefit/minimal burden and cost ratio. We, therefore, propose a diagnostic algorithm which is tailored according to stroke phase and availability of distinct therapeutic strategies. In the acute phase of ischemic stroke, patients can be segregated into those who are potentially amenable to systemic thrombolysis within 3 h and into possible candidates for (i.v. or i.a.) thrombolysis outside approved criteria both within and beyond this time window. For patients in the postacute phase of acute ischemic stroke, neuroimaging should contribute a maximum of information to the clarification of stroke etiology to allow for specific secondary prevention. Patients with transient ischemic attacks appear to represent yet another distinct group of patients who can benefit greatly from a rapid and comprehensive neuroimaging evaluation, as this allows identification of individuals at a specifically high risk for a subsequent stroke. Using these categories, the relevance of respective neuroimaging tools can be substantiated by a large body of evidence."

Thirty healthy mongrel dogs were randomly divided into five groups; artificial cerebrospinal fluid group (group A), normal temperature control group (group C), mild hypothermia 8 h group (group H1), mild hypothermia 16 h group (group H2), and mild hypothermia 32 h group (group H3). The authors injected the artificial CSF into dog's foramen magnum in group A while the other four groups were injected with autologous arterial blood. The normal group's temperature maintained 38.5°C. The authors set the temperature at 33.5°C in mild hypothermia groups and this was maintained for 8, 16, and 32 h, respectively. ET-1 and NO levels in the cerebrospinal fluid and plasma were assayed in each group on days 0, 7, 14, and 21. Then the changes of the diameter of blood vessels of cerebral basilar artery and overall performance categories score in each group through application of CT angiography were recorded. In the cerebral vasospasm model which was constructed by injecting the blood to dog twice, mild hypothermia treatment, through the application of vascular heat-exchange controller, could reduce cerebral vasospasm. It was observed that the duration of the mild hypothermia is directly proportional to the longer duration of the relieving of cerebral vasospasm. The reciprocal changes observed in the levels of ET-1 and NO in cerebrospinal fluid and plasma revealed that it might be possible to reduce the cerebral vasospasm by regulating the rising amplitude of ET-1 and the decrease in NO in CSF and plasma."

Neurological grades of these patients were grade III in 2 and grade IV in 4 patients, and subarachnoid hemorrhage on CT was diffuse and thick in all patients. Cerebral blood flow was continuously measured for 7 to 19 days by the thermal diffusion flow probe with a peltier stack which was left on the cerebral cortex at the surgery for ruptured aneurysm. Moreover, CBF studies by cold xenon CT and 133Xe inhalation methods were also performed in discussing cases. At the same time intracranial pressure was monitored. Cerebral angiography was carried out in all except for 2 patients who died due to severe cerebral vasospasm. The initial CBF value of all patients was 20 to 40 ml/100 g/min (mean value: 27 ml/100 g/min), and these were significantly low compared to normal value (50 ml/100 g/min). Moreover, these CBF was substantially decreased several days after surgery in all patients, and it was marked in 3 patients who died. From these results it was clear that the degree of vasospasm is important to determine the prognosis. One of 3 patients who died had ruptured left posterior cerebral artery aneurysm with occlusion of bilateral internal carotid arteries. In this case further decrease of CBF due to vasospasm was observed in addition to low initial CBF resulting diffuse low flow in both hemispheres although extracranial to intracranial bypass was performed. On the other hand, it was also shown that the intracranial pressure was an important factor to influence the outcomes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Initial computed tomography and cerebral angiography revealed a severe subarachnoid hemorrhage, a large cystic lesion in the left occipital region, and an aneurysm at the bifurcation of the internal carotid and the posterior communicating artery on the right side. As the subarachnoid hemorrhage was thought to be due to rupture of the aneurysm, we attempted to clip the aneurysmal neck at first, and 2 weeks later the cystic tumor was removed for the purpose of internal decompression. The extirpated specimen proved to be an epidermoid tumor. Association of a brain tumor and an cerebral aneurysm is very rare, especially a combination of an epidermoid tumor and a cerebral aneurysm, and until now only 2 cases have been reported to the best of our knowledge. Moreover, the epidermoid tumor of our case was located intracerebrally. The phenomenon that the internal carotid aneurysm was on the left side and the tumor on the right side may suggest that these 2 lesions originated quite coincidentally. It is controversial to decide which lesion and when to treat first in a case of association of a tumor and an aneurysm, and we discussed as to the surgical therapy reviewing literature."

Quantitative caliper measurements were performed from maximum intensity projection (MIP) and multiple planar reconstruction (MPR) images, according to the criteria of the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET) and European Carotid Surgery Trial (ECST). The measurements were compared to each other and to visual interpretation, using conventional angiography as the reference. The measured percentage stenoses were higher on MRA than on digital subtraction angiography (DSA) using both NASCET (mean difference 1.9-3.0%) and ECST (6.3-6.7%) criteria. The kappa coefficients for the agreement between DSA and MRA were higher using the NASCET (0.61-0.76) than the ECST criteria (0.52-0.65). No statistically significant differences were found between measurements from MIP and MPR images. The ECST measurement criteria gave significantly higher percentage stenoses than the NASCET criteria (P < 0.001), this difference being more prominent on MRA (mean difference in diameter stenosis percentage 14.3-16.4%) than on DSA (7.6-11.2%) and most important with mild stenoses. The difference between visual interpretation and quantitative measurements on MRA was significant (P = 0.01-0.001). There were no statistically significant interobserver differences in the MRA film readings, either in visually estimated degrees of stenosis or stenosis measurements. Thus, the different criteria of the two multicentre trials led to significantly different results, especially in the assessment of mild stenosis, and these differences are more important with MRA than with DSA. Differences between the imaging modalities or the reconstruction programs seem less important."

Early computed tomography (CT) detected no brain abnormalities, but repeat CT found subarachnoid hemorrhage. Internal carotid angiography detected a pseudoaneurysm, which was not treated because of his poor clinical condition. He died of multiple organ failure. Early detection of a traumatic intracranial aneurysm is important for the prevention of aneurysmal rupture, or ""delayed"" apoplexy. Review of 171 cases with traumatic aneurysms from the literature found that false negative angiography occurred only in three cases on post-trauma day 7 and thereafter. Early diagnostic angiography within a week of the initial trauma is indicated if traumatic aneurysm is suspected to detect early signs of irregularity, spasm, and narrowing of the arterial wall. Repeat angiography is indicated if aneurysmal formation is still highly suspected in spite of negative initial angiography."

CD009372,0,1511219,1,"Comparison of MRI, CT and angiography in cerebral arteriovenous malformations.","Computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and cerebral angiography were performed in 30 patients with cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Clinical data and radiographic findings are presented. The diagnostic values of CT and MRI are compared. 25 of 30 AVMs were seen on CT-scans, 27 on MR-images, 26 by angiography. Typical CT-findings were irregularly hyperdense areas with spotlike contrast enhancement. 4 out of 5 AVMs not depicted by CT were diagnosed for tumor, in one case the malformation was hidden by a hematoma. MRI mostly showed the AVM as round or oval lesions with spongelike structure of low signal intensity in T1-weighted sequences or as single enlarged vessels. The 26 AVM revealed by angiography presented typically enlarged vessels; in 2 cases angiography was without any pathological findings, 2 cases showed signs of a space occupying lesion. The results confirm that MRI is superior to CT in detecting and recognizing AVM. Its strength lies in the possibility to detect abnormal vessels even in presence of fresh or older hematoma, and in the precise information on size and location of the AVM. In our series, MRI and CT-scans together showed 28 of 30 AVMs, the remaining 2 cases were not seen with angiography either but only proven histologically.

CD009372,0,9781283,0,Intra-operative colour-duplex-sonography in the surgical management of cerebral AV-malformations.,"In this prospective study the role of intra-operative Colour-Duplex-Sonography (= CDS) during surgery of arteriovenous malformations (= AVM) is evaluated. During the last three years 20 consecutive patients with supratentorial AVMs were examined by intra-operative CDS in order to evaluate the potential of CDS to 1) localize the AVM, 2) differentiate between embolized and perfused parts, 3) identify feeding and draining vessels and 4) control the complete excision of the AVM. All AVMs were localized supratentorially, 9 were grade I and II (according to Spetzler and Martin [31]), 8 grade III and 3 grade IV. 11 were partly embolized and 8 associated with an intracerebral bleeding. In all cases the nidus was correctly localized sonographically by its typical bidirectional flow pattern in Colour-mode. CDS guided the surgeon directly to all (11 cases) deep-seated AVMs (2 to 4 cm subcortically). The smallest nidus measured 10 mm. 28 of 34 angiographically defined main feeding and 18 of 23 draining vessels were identified. 14 patients were controlled sonographically at the end of the resection regarding the completeness of excision. In 11 patients CDS was negative and was confirmed by either postoperative angiography or MRI in 10 patients. In one case residual AVM tissue was missed by CDS. Positive CDS findings in 3 cases were all confirmed by microscopic re-inspection, angiography and CCT. Our results suggest that CDS is able to localize AVMs intra-operatively with minimal instrumentation. It allows safe navigation to deep-seated malformations with high accuracy. Feeding and draining vessels can be identified and completeness of resection can be controlled."
CD009372,0,9266566,0,[A case of spontaneous middle cerebral artery occlusion associated with a cerebral aneurysm angiographically disappearing after STA-MCA anastomosis].,"We report a case of a rapidly growing cerebral aneurysm in the basal abnormal vascular network associated with spontaneous middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion. The aneurysm disappeared spontaneously shortly after performing STA-MCA anastomosis. A 54-year-old female was admitted to our hospital because of repeated attacks of right hemisensory disturbance and dysarthria. CT scan and MRI images showed the infarcted focus in the left parieto-occipital lobe. Bilateral MCAs were undetectable on MRI images. Cerebral angiography revealed that the bilateral MCAs were occluded in their proximal origin with basal abnormal vascular networks. The distal MCA branches were perfused via the vascular networks. A small aneurysm was detected in the distal portion of the left Heubner's artery. There were no abnormalities in the bilateral internal carotid arteries, the anterior cerebral arteries, and the basilar artery. The follow-up angiography performed 29 days after admission revealed a growing aneurysm with a diameter of 3 mm in the distal enhanced lesion consistent with the aneurysm observed in the angiography. An STA-MCA anastomosis was performed for improvement of cerebral misery perfusion. Single photon emission tomography (SPECT) performed 9 days after the bypass operation revealed improvement of cerebral blood flow in the left parieto-occipital lobe, and her TIA attacks disappeared. The aneurysm was undetected in the cerebral angiography performed 24 days after the bypass operation. Spontaneous MCA occlusion is a rare condition of chronic cerebrovascular occlusive diseases. Diagnostic criteria of the disease includes the MCA occlusions or stenosis with basal abnormal vascular networks. Usually the phenomenon is seen unilaterally, which differs from moyamoya disease. Diagnosis must exclude diseases caused by the etiologies such as those of arteriosclerotic origin. There have been 24 reported cases of spontaneous MCA occlusion including our case. Among them, 9 cases presented cerebral aneurysm located in abnormal vascular networks, and all the reported cases presented cerebral hemorrhage at their onset. The abnormal basal vascular network may be developed as collateral vessels to supply blood to the ischemic regions in this disease. An increased hemodynamic stress in the abnormal basal vascular network may produce a true aneurysm in the distal portion of the perforating arteries. STA-MCA anastomosis reduced the TIA attacks, but also decreased the hemodynamic stress on the abnormal basal vascular network and resulted in reduction in size or thrombosis of the aneurysm. STA-MCA anastomosis can be considered effective to treat cerebral aneurysms located in vessels with increased hemodynamic stress."

CD009372,0,16670864,0,Dissection of the V4 segment of the vertebral artery: clinicoradiologic manifestations and endovascular treatment.,"Intracranial vertebral artery (VA) dissection has three clinical presentations: ischemia, hemorrhage, and mass effect. Imaging findings of intracranial VA dissections vary according to clinical presentation. Irregular stenosis or occlusion of the VA is the most common finding in patients with posterior fossa infarction, whereas a dissecting aneurysm is the main feature in those with acute subarachnoid hemorrhage. A chronic, giant, dissecting aneurysm can cause mass effect on the brain stem or cranial nerves, as well as distal embolism. Magnetic resonance imaging is useful for detection of intramural hematomas and intimal flaps, both of which are diagnostic of VA dissection. Multidetector computed tomography angiography is increasingly used for diagnosis of VA dissection. Catheter angiography is still beneficial for evaluation of precise endoluminal morphology of the dissection before surgical or endovascular intervention. Endovascular treatment is now considered a major therapeutic option for patients with a ruptured dissecting aneurysm or a chronic dissecting aneurysm. Anticoagulation therapy is currently considered the initial treatment of choice in patients with posterior circulation ischemic symptoms. Endovascular treatment, such as stent-assisted angioplasty or coil occlusion at the dissection site, can be performed in selected patients with posterior fossa ischemic symptoms."

CD009372,0,3573823,0,Elevation of serum creatine kinase B-subunit levels by radiographic contrast agents in patients with neurologic disorders.,"The effect of radiographic contrast agents on the central nervous system was evaluated by measurement of serum creatine kinase B-subunit (CKB) levels with use of radioimmunoassay in 58 patients who underwent computed tomographic (CT) scanning and 46 patients who underwent cerebral angiography for evaluation of cerebrovascular diseases, brain tumors, and other neurologic disorders. In 11 patients (10.6%), the CKB increased to abnormally high levels within 4 hours after the radiographic procedures, and the median value after 30 minutes was significantly higher than the corresponding precontrast value (P less than 0.01). Eight of the 11 patients had recent ischemic cerebrovascular diseases, and 7 of the 11 had undergone CT scanning. On the basis of the information available in the literature, elevation of the serum CKB levels may be interpreted as reflecting breakdown of the blood-brain barrier and neural damage.

CD009372,0,11954867,0,Multi-slice CT angiography in the evaluation of patients with acute cerebrovascular disease--a promising new diagnostic tool.,"Single-slice computed tomographic angiography (CTA) is an established imaging method for the cerebrovascular system (CVS), but it suffers from technical limitations with respect to the coherent high resolution visualization of longer vascular segments, such as the extra- and intracranial CVS. The recently introduced multi-slice (MS) technology has been attributed with a superior imaging quality for angiographic procedures due to increased scan speed and improved spatial resolution. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the suitability of multi-slice CTA (MS-CTA) for the assessment of the arteriovenous CVS in patients with acute symptoms of either arterial or venous occlusive diseases. 41 patients with clinically suspected acute cerebral ischaemia (hemispheric in 29 and vertebrobasilar in 12 patients) and 4 patients with suspected cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) underwent CTA in a MS-CT scanner. In addition, doppler ultrasonography (DUS) was erformed in 34, magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) in 5 and digital subtraction angiography (DSA) in 6 patients. All findings were reviewed for stenoses or occlusion of the extra-and intracranial CVS and correlated with the clinical outcome. In 43 (96%) of 45 patients, MS-CTA yielded images of diagnostic quality with comprehensive visualization of the arterial and venous CVS including the cervical carotid bifurcation, the third segment of the major cerebral arteries and the dural sinus as well as internal cerebral veins. In 2 patients, assessment of the carotid bifurcation was limited because of tooth artefacts. In all patients, in whom imaging and clinical follow-up proved a non-lacunar infarction (n = 22), MS-CTA detected the underlying vascular pathology. Suspected CVT could be confirmed in 2 and ruled out in another 2 patients through MS-CTA. In conclusion, multi-slice CT an giography may be a promising new diagnostic tool for the rapid and comprehensive assessment of the arteriovenous CVS in patients with clinical signs of acute cerebrovascular diseases."
CD009372,0,23394535,0,Current management and treatment of cerebral vasospasm complicating SAH.,"Cerebral vasospasm is a common and serious complication of aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage. Despite the improvements in treatment of aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (aSAH), cerebral vasospasm complicating aSAH has remained the main cause of morbidity and mortality. Subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH)-induced vasospasm is a complex entity caused by vasculopathy, impaired autoregulation, and hypovolaemia, causing a regional reduction of cerebral brain perfusion which can then induce ischaemia. Cerebral vasospasm can present either asymptomatically detected only radiologically or symptomatically (delayed ischaemic neurologic deficit). The various diagnostic approaches include the use of transcranial doppler, digital subtraction angiography and multimodal computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) techniques. Although digital subtraction angiography is usually the gold standard for the diagnosis of cerebral vasospam, transcranial doppler is commonly the first-screening method for the detection of cerebral vasospam.

CD009372,0,22192555,0,Spontaneous post-partum cervical carotid artery dissection in a patient with reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome.,"Post-partum cervicocephalic artery dissection (pp-CAD) is a rare and poorly understood condition. To our knowledge, only 21 cases have been reported. Reversible cerebral segmental vasoconstriction (RCSV) was first described by Call and Fleming in 1988, and its association with pp-CAD has only been reported in three cases. However, in those cases it is unclear whether the pp-CAD may have been caused by straining during labor and therefore merely coincidental to the intracranial arteriopathy. We describe a 41-year-old right-handed African-American woman who developed the syndrome of pp-CAD (headaches, trace subarachnoid hemorrhage and diffuse cerebral arteriopathy on angiogram) two weeks after delivery. In this unique case, the patient had fortuitously undergone an MR study twice over a four day period which included the carotid bifurcations. During that time the patient was an inpatient, on bed rest and subject to continuous cardiac monitoring. The interval studies documented a true spontaneous right internal carotid artery dissection occurring without obvious cause. The patient had noted moderate right neck pain developing between the two MR studies but experienced no neurological deficits. Subsequent conventional angiography confirmed the presence of postpartum cerebral arteriopathy and the cervical dissection. The patient was managed conservatively with antiplatelet medication and had an otherwise uneventful course. We hypothesize whether transient arterial wall abnormalities, postpartum hormonal changes or subtle connective tissue aberrations play a similar role in the pathogenesis of these two associated conditions."
CD009372,0,9784953,0,Interactive image-guided surgical resection of intracranial arteriovenous malformations.,"Surgical excision is the only treatment method that immediately prevents increased morbidity or mortality as a result of hemorrhage from arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). For those lesions located deep within the cerebral hemispheres or near eloquent areas, conventional surgical resection may be associated with an unacceptable degree of morbidity and mortality. Herein we report our experience in the resection of these lesions using interactive image guidance. There were five women and five men in the patient group. Their age ranged from 16 to 73 years (mean = 41). Clinical presentation included hemorrhage (n = 7), headaches (n = 2), and seizures (n = 1). All lesions were classified using the Spetzler-Martin grading system as follows: grade I (n = 4), grade II (n = 5), and grade III (n = 1). The locations of the lesions were supratentorial (9) and infratentorial (1). Surgical planning was carried out using the Neurological Surgery Planning System software developed at Wayne State University. An infrared-based system was used to locate and define the lesion intraoperatively. For those lesions located near or within eloquent areas, an awake craniotomy with functional mapping was carried out. Clinical follow-up ranged from 3 to 62 months (mean = 34). Complete surgical excision was achieved in all patients, which was demonstrated postoperatively by digital substraction angiography. The preoperative neurological status remained unchanged in seven patients and improved in three. There was no associated morbidity and mortality with this technique. Image-guided surgical resection of arteriovenous malformations represents a valuable technique, especially in small deep-seated lesions and in those near eloquent areas."
CD009372,0,2256445,0,Lone atrial fibrillation and stroke.,"We studied 21 consecutive patients from the Lausanne Stroke Registry, who had first-ever ischemic stroke and lone atrial fibrillation, with a standard protocol of investigations including brain CT, and non-invasive cardiac and arterial tests. Rarity of associated risk factors and extracranial; arterial disease, presence of distal intracerebral occlusions on early angiography, and topography of cerebral infarct suggested that cardioembolism was the cause of stroke, though echocardiographic evidence for an atrial thrombus was uncommon. There was no recurrence during a post-stroke 14-day phase, during which anticoagulant and antiaggregant therapies were systematically avoided. Though low, the main risk of stroke recurrence was 0.99 per 100 patient-years during a mean follow-up period of 4.8 years, including a mean duration of anticoagulant therapy of 2.3 years in 18 patients. On the other hand, no death, severe cardiac events, or disabling anticoagulation-related hemorrhages occurred."

CD009372,0,18516978,0,[Isolated traumatic oculomotor nerve palsy caused by minor head trauma].,"Isolated traumatic oculomotor nerve palsy caused by minor head trauma is extremely rare. We report a case of this condition. A 65-year-old woman was transferred to our hospital after minor head injury. Initial examination of her right eye revealed a dilated pupil. The result of computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and magnetic resonance angiography of the brain were normal. An examination conducted 6 hours after the accident, examination demonstrated right ptosis, and another conducted 20 hours after the accident, she demonstrated partial limitation of adduction, supraduction, and infraduction of the right eye. Constructive interference in steady-state magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a slightly rough-shaped oculomotor nerve near the posterior petroclinoid ligament. After 8 months of the accident, the ptosis and limited eye movement were resolved. However, the right dilation of the right pupil persisted. Our case suggests that even minor head trauma can cause isolated oculomotor palsy, and that the posterior petroclinoid ligament is a candidate structure for causing oculomotor nerve palsy without intracranial hemorrhage and skull fracture."

The patients underwent cerebral angiography, x-ray computed tomography (CT) scan and regional cerebral measurements of CBF, CMRO2, oxygen extraction ratio (OER), and cerebral blood volume (CBV). Only minor arterial involvement was detected by angiography. In all patients, PET images of functional defects were more extensive than the corresponding CT hypodensity, and there were statistically significant reductions in CBF, CMRO2, and CBF/CBV ratio as compared with control subjects. Half of the regions analyzed in the affected hemisphere demonstrated a disruption of the normal coupling between CBF and CMRO2 as reflected by OER values significantly higher or lower than those of the corresponding region of the contralateral hemisphere. The pathophysiological pattern of high OER combined with a reduction in CBF proportionally greater than the reduction in CMRO2 was particularly indicative of regional chronic hemodynamic compromise in these patients."
CD009372,0,1462589,0,[The so-called stroke headache].,"Sudden violent headache occurring for the first time in life suggests subarachnoid haemorrhage and requires diagnostic management. In 20 cases the authors failed to find blood in cerebrospinal fluid, but in 8 cases the protein level was raised. The patients were examined again after 2-10 years, and had control neurological examination and CT of the brain. In half the cases similar headaches returned after various time periods, and haemorrhage was again ruled out. In all patient chronic headaches of lower intensity developed. Control CT examination showed in 7 cases scars or atrophy of brain tissue. It is difficult to qualify such headaches as migraine and other known types of headache. Recently in the literature a new name has been coined for them--thunderclap headaches, and some authors regard them as a sign of minor intracranial haemorrhage. CT changes, raised protein level in cerebrospinal fluid, and the type of pain may suggest haemorrhage. The usefulness of cerebral arteriography in such patients should be considered. We propose the name of stoke headache for suggesting the cause and special management."

It provides powerful noninvasive imaging of the cervical and intracranial vessels allowing the detection and the diagnosis of vascular anomalies. MRA usefully supplements, during the same examination, the analysis by MRI of the cerebral parenchyma. We will describe the indications of the various techniques (MRA with and without injection of contrast media) and show the value, artifacts and limitations of MRA in atherosclerotic stenosis or occlusive disease and in arterial dissections. This noninvasive vascular assessment will depend on the initial therapeutic orientation.

CD009372,0,9117934,0,The neuroimaging features of the cardiolipin antibody syndrome.,"The purpose of our study was to define the neuroimaging features of the cardiolipin antibody syndrome. Thirty-eight patients with elevated anticardiolipin antibody titers were studied with magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography or both. Two patients underwent cerebral angiography. All patients had recurrent transient ischemic attacks, amaurosis, or strokes. One patient had normal imaging findings. The remaining patients had a combination of infarction and atrophy. Focal infarcts, the most common finding, were seen in 32 patients. Cerebral atrophy was seen in 26 patients and was the only radiographic finding in 5. Angiography demonstrated dramatic abnormalities in the distal portions of the anterior and posterior circulations, with multiple stenosis and occlusions and extensive pial and transdural collateral networks. The cardiolipin antibody syndrome should be suspected in young patients with transient ischemic attacks or strokes in the absence of the usual risk factors for cerebrovascular disease. The presence of raised anticardiolipin antibody titers or the cardiolipin antibody syndrome in patients with lupus, in those with other connective tissue diseases, and in patients without overt manifestations of an autoimmune disorder should be viewed as a risk factor for future ischemic cerebrovascular events. Further understanding of the precise role of these antibodies in the pathogenesis of vascular thrombosis may lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying certain forms of stroke."

CD009372,0,19565185,0,Intracranial and intraspinal hemorrhage following spinal anesthesia.,"Spinal anesthesia (SA), accounting for more than 50% of regional anesthesias in the spinal region, is generally perceived as simple and safe. Our purpose is to increase awareness of hemorrhagic complications following SA. A 69-year-old male without either coagulation disorders or anticoagulant/antiplatelet therapy developed acute radiculopathy, and severe mental confusion after SA for prostatectomy. CT showed intracranial subarachnoid and intraventricular acute hemorrhage. Cerebral angiography was negative. MRI showed subarachnoid and subdural hematoma in the dorsolumbar spine. Seven-year follow-up showed permanent cognitive and radicular damage. Multiple attempts for SA most likely caused spinal vessels rupture, either directly or indirectly by inducing differential pressure changes between cerebrospinal fluid and intravascular spaces; however, definite mechanisms have not been completely understood. Patients undergoing spinal puncture must report any neurological abnormality, which may result in irreversible damage. Cases of altered consciousness require an extensive neuroradiological evaluation. Proper competency of physicians responsible for spinal puncture is mandatory."

A few days later, however, the patient had spontaneous intracerebral hematoma with cortical venous drainage. Complete obliteration of the fistula was achieved after embolization. When initial audible bruit in traumatic CCF disappears suddenly, cerebral angiography should be performed to differentiate venous hypertension by the hemodynamic changes of the cavernous sinus channels from spontaneous resolution of CCF."

The results were compared with Doppler ultrasound and conventional angiography. MR angiography reliably demonstrated the direction of blood flow and the presence or absence of collateral flow in the circle of Willis. Collateral flow via leptomeningeal vessels and the ophthalmic artery could not be demonstrated. In the patient with superior sagittal sinus thrombosis, the absence of flow was well seen. MR angiography was able to demonstrate the major supplying arteries in the patients with AVMs. MR angiography is a valid noninvasive means to demonstrate direction of flow and blood supply of the major intracranial arteries."

A 50-year-old woman with malignant otitis externa and bilateral temporal bone osteomyelitis presented with brisk bleeding from her left ear. She had bony dehiscence of the left carotid canal at CT and extravasation from a pseudoaneurysm of the carotid petrous segment at angiography. Carotid tortuosity proximally precluded placing a covered stent. After the lesion stopped bleeding spontaneously and given the presence of bilateral osteomyelitis putting the contralateral carotid at risk, the decision was made to attempt preservation of the parent vessel with flow diversion. However, bleeding recurred after 12 days, necessitating carotid sacrifice. This first reported experience in treating a carotid pseudoaneurysm at the skull base with the Pipeline device shows that transient cessation of bleeding is insufficient for flow diversion to be effective."

We report a previously healthy 4-year-old girl who presented with an intracranial hemorrhage secondary to a ruptured arteriovenous malformation. A routine abdominal examination revealed a large right-sided Wilms' tumor. The question generated by the coexistence of these two uncommon disorders in one individual is whether there is a genetic or other relationship between them, or whether this is merely a coincidental occurrence. The question at this point is unanswered and must await demonstration of additional, similar cases."

This report presents the usefulness of paraclinical tests applied during a 4-year period. Forty-four patients with severe brain lesions leading to brain death were treated during the 2004-2007 period. The appropriate test was chosen according to test availability and patient condition, appreciating restrictions according to the test protocol. Since the results of some tests were inconclusive, some patients underwent repeat testing with the same or different methods. Among 44 patients, 19 had neurotrauma, 11 massive aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, 1 massive arteriovenous subarachnoid and parenchymal hemorrhage, 12 hypertensive parenchymal hemorrhage, and 1 ischemic stroke. As a primary test, transcranial Doppler (TCD) was used in 30, brain scintigraphy in 2, multislice computed tomography angiography (MSCTA) in 10, and cerebral angiography in 2 patients; the diagnosis was confirmed in 26, 3, 9 and 2 patients, respectively. Due to inconclusive test results, MSCTA had to be repeated in 4 patients twice, and in one patient three times. Four patients where TCD was used died during the observation period, and in one patient the hemodynamic spectrum was inconclusive. In most patients (65%), TCD confirmed the clinical diagnosis of brain death, and in 61% the diagnosis was confirmed within a 2-hour period. TCD was the most useful confirmatory test for cerebral circulatory arrest in brain death diagnosis."

Charts of patients seen at the Mayo Clinic between 1974 and 1985 were reviewed. Follow-up information was obtained on 166 patients until death, surgery, or other intervention, or for at least 4 years after diagnosis (mean follow-up time 8.2 years). All available cerebral arteriograms and computerized tomography scans of the head were reviewed. Intracranial hemorrhage occurred in 31 patients (18%), due to AVM rupture in 29 and secondary to AVM or aneurysm rupture in two. The mean risk of hemorrhage was 2.2% per year, and the observed annual rates of hemorrhage increased over time. The risk of death from rupture was 29%, and 23% of survivors had significant long-term morbidity. The size of the AVM and the presence of treated or untreated hypertension were of no value in predicting rupture."

CD009372,0,3239254,0,[Intracerebral hematoma from a large aneurysm of the middle cerebral artery in infancy].,"The article reports on a large aneurysm of the tunica media vasorum with intracerebral haematoma in an infant of the age of 4 1/2 weeks and on the successful treatment by removal of the haematoma and extirpation of the aneurysm. The rare space-occupying lesion of the central organ seemed to point first of all to a peripheral disease due to the very unusual and highly special course in the infant; a gastrointestinal disorder seemed to be responsible for this phenomenon. It was only after observing mild convulsive manifestations that sonography was employed as a diagnostic tool, and thus the central disturbance was identified and its localisation and genesis demonstrated via computed tomography and angiographic diagnosis. Attention is drawn to the outstanding ""search method"" of noninvasive sonography via the still open fontanelle of the infant. This method should be employed if there is even the slightest suspicion of cerebral disease. A study of the literature shows clearly the superiority of the modern methods such as computed tomography and digital subtraction angiography over a femoralis catheter. The literature includes in particular two cases that occurred in the sixties of the present century and were comparable with that of our infant; at that time, the authors of those publications did not yet command over our present-day methods."

Attempts are also being made to characterize the main patterns of intracranial vascular diseases. The authors examined, with 3D TOF MRA, 40 patients presenting with 50 vascular lesions on MRI scans. Twenty of 40 patients were also studied with angiography. Seventeen aneurysms were detected, together with 3 stenoses of the cerebral arteries, 13 arteriovenous malformations, 12 dolichobasilar arteries, 3 postoperative and 2 post-embolization controls. MRI was performed with a superconductive magnet (1.5 T), a dedicated coil and gradient-echo 3D TOF FT sequences. The refocused sequence for flux, FISP 3DFT, required the following parameters: TR = 0.04 s, TE = 10 ms, flip angle = 15 degrees, 256 x 256 matrix, 1 acquisition. The 64-80 mm volume along the axial plane was divided so that an actual 1-mm thickness was excited. In post-processing, the maximum-intensity projection was employed on the axial plane 0 degrees-90 degrees (15 degrees interval). In the various conditions, the results obtained with MRA were correlated and compared with MRI findings. MRA provided useful additional information in 27.4% of cases in the study of aneurysms, arteriovenous malformations, vascular occlusion and dolichobasilar arteries, as well as in the follow-up of these lesions. MRA is currently suggested in the evaluation of cerebral circulation and is considered a complementary technique to MRI. MRA is also to be used preliminary to angiography."

CD009372,0,10235014,0,Surgery of angiomas in the brainstem with a stress on the presence of telangiectasia.,"This report deals with the surgery of angiomas other than arteriovenous malformation in the brainstem. The surgical cases were three cavernomas, two telangiectasias, and two venous malformations. We performed surgery when an angioma bled and the resulting hematoma was situated near the surface of the brainstem or the fourth ventricle. The cases were operated on at the subacute or chronic stages after hemorrhage. Although a magnetic resonance (MR) image showed a subacute or chronic localized hematoma with a low intensity rim, the case was not always a cavernoma, but a telangiectasia. Cavernomas could be totally removed, but telangiectasia could not. In the cases of medullary venous malformation the diagnosis was obtained radiologically, and when the hematoma was large, only hematoma evacuation was performed. In all cases the postoperative Karnofsky scores were improved or unchanged. Postoperative rebleeding in the hematoma cavity continued insidiously in a case of telangiectasia. The abnormal vessels of telangiectasia in the brainstem were preoperatively not visualized by cerebral angiography or MR imaging, but became visualized by enhanced MR imaging after evacuation of hematoma in two cases. It is stressed that an angioma with a hematoma intensity core surrounded by a low intensity rim on MR images is not always a cavernoma, but possibly is a telangiectasia."

We intend to study which pathophysiological changes are detected by CT and how CT contributes to prognosis and patient management in acute cerebral ischemia. We review recent publications about the role of CT in acute cerebral ischemia. Ischemic brain edema is associated with a decreased X-ray attenuation. Computed tomography is thus highly sensitive in detecting irreversibly damaged ischemic brain tissue. Patients showing large volumes of ischemic edema, exceeding one third of the middle cerebral artery territory, do not benefit from thrombolysis and have an increased risk of brain hemorrhage. The brain territory at risk from ischemia can be detected by CT angiography. To combine CT with CT angiography is a pragmatic approach which enables carefully directed treatment in acute cerebral ischemia."

CD009372,0,21125477,0,Neuroimaging research on cerebrovascular spasm and its current progress.,"The cerebrovascular spasm is a common complication of subarachnoid hemorrhage. The prognosis is affected severely with regard to quality of life of patients, and earlier determination of the cerebral vasospasm becomes very important. In recent years, there have been many research results in early judgment of cerebrovascular spasm, and imaging technology research is particularly prominent in this area. This article summarizes the advantages and disadvantages and the specific roles of several common imaging technologies to determine the early stage of cerebral vasospasm. Transcranial Doppler (TCD) was the first used to examine cerebral vasospasm and mainly detected vascular hemodynamic changes of cerebrovascular spasm in patients. Digital subtraction angiography is the gold standard for diagnosis of cerebral vasospasm, but its efficacy in determining severity of cerebrovascular spasm indexing is still in dispute. It is invasive, it is difficult to repeat the examination, and it can induce complications, so its clinical application is limited. CT imaging technology is a hot topic in this area. There is an important guiding significance in early diagnosis and treatment of cerebral vasospasm in CT perfusion imaging (PCT) and CT angiography (CTA). PCT mainly performs qualitative and quantitative analysis through hemodynamic parameters such as cerebral blood flow, cerebral blood volume, and mean transit time. CTA is minimally invasive, fast, and reliable as an efficient imaging technology, and will possibly replace DSA for the assessment of vasospasm, particularly in critically ill patients with cerebral vasospasm in an urgent examination. This means it has greater value and helps to improve the prognosis of patients. MR imaging in the early stages to judge cerebral vasospasm has great value. DWI can effectively assess the cerebral vascular spasm earlier to detect trace bleeding sites and reflect the damage of cerebral vasospasm by apparent diffusion coefficient. Combined with DWI and PWI, perfusion can be understood in all regions and can be found in ischemic penumbra, which is a more accurate way to determine cerebral vasospasm and more beneficial in guiding the treatment of patients and improving their prognosis. However, there have been false-negatives and false-positives when detecting cerebrovascular spasm post-SAH. It is of great importance to select accurate, convenient, non-invasive imaging technologies that judge cerebrovascular spasm and guide treatment that improves the prognosis of these patients and other aspects."

We studied 23 aneurysms in 18 patients (age range 34-72 years) with aneurysms of the anterior (n = 17) and posterior (n = 6) circulation by comparing 3D time-of-flight (TOF), contrast-enhanced MRA and digital subtraction angiography (DSA). In four of 23 aneurysms, 3D-TOF did not show the lesion. Contrast-enhanced MRA successfully depicted all aneurysms except one. T1 contamination artefacts from subarachnoid or intraparenchymal haemorrhages were evident on the 3D-TOF images in six cases. The artefacts were completely eliminated on the contrast-enhanced MRA images by subtraction of the pre-contrast images. The diagnostic information in patients with subarachnoid haemorrhages (SAHs) provided by contrast-enhanced MRA was comparable to that provided by DSA."

The authors describe a patient with chronic hypertension who developed superimposed preeclampsia and spontaneous ICH during the thirty-fifth week of pregnancy. ICH was diagnosed by computed tomographic scan. She underwent successful emergent cesarean section and neurosurgical decompression of the ICH. Both intraoperative surveillance and postoperative magnetic resonance angiographic examination of the cerebral vessels failed to identify an aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation. The authors discuss the diagnosis and management in this case and review the literature regarding this challenging complication of pregnancy and preeclampsia. Controversies regarding treatment of hypertension during pregnancy are discussed in light of the impact on the management of this patient.

CD009372,0,19605654,0,Normal variants of the cerebral circulation at multidetector CT angiography.,"Multidetector computed tomographic (CT) angiography is used in many institutions for initial evaluation of the cerebral circulation for acute stroke and subarachnoid hemorrhage as well as in various preoperative settings. A comprehensive CT examination that includes a review of three-dimensional and maximum intensity projection images of the intra- and extracranial arteries and axial images of the skull base (obtained with bone window settings) allows identification of most abnormalities and normal variants. Knowledge of the presence and clinical relevance of normal variants such as fenestrations, duplications, and persistent fetal arteries plays a crucial role in the diagnosis and management of acute stroke and subarachnoid hemorrhage and may aid in surgical planning. For example, the preoperative detection of a medial or intrasellar persistent trigeminal artery may help surgeons avoid a potentially life-threatening hemorrhage in a patient undergoing transsphenoidal surgery for pituitary adenoma. However, the significance of normal variants diverges widely: A clinically important association has been observed between fenestration and intracranial aneurysm formation, whereas early branching of the middle cerebral artery is not associated with an increased risk of aneurysm formation and has little clinical significance.

One year postoperatively, the patient was followed with CT angiography and was reported to show a de novo aneurysm at the bifurcation of the left inferior cerebellar artery (ICA). Subsequent DSA revealed an aberrant vein crossing over the ICA bifurcation on mask phase images. This is the first reported case of a such a reason for a 'false positive' on CT angiography (CTA).

CD009372,0,8915761,0,Vasospasm following tumor removal: report of 5 cases.,"Cerebral vasospasm is a clinical/angiographical condition frequently observed after a subarachnoid hemorrhage due to the rupture of an intracranial aneurysm. Twenty cases of vasospasm observed after the removal of cerebral tumors have been reported in the literature; we here report on a further five. The time of onset of symptomatic vasospasm was 3-7 days after surgery; three of the patients died of an ischemic event induced by the vasospasm and two survive. Although no angiographic confirmation was obtained in our cases, serial transcranial Doppler (TCD) flow velocities were always high. It is suggested that the TCD-revealed accumulation of blood in the basal cisterns observed in all cases may have been responsible for this unusual condition, and it is therefore important to consider vasospasm as a probable etiological cause of clinical deterioration in patients undergoing the surgical removal of a cerebral tumor. For this reason, whenever any neurological deterioration occurs in such patients, it is advisable to perform TCD in order to verify the presence of any vasospasm and promptly commence suitable treatment."

Until not long ago, higher-field MR equipment was exclusively employed for research, not for clinical use. More recently, the introduction of 3.0-T MR machines for new and more sophisticated clinical applications has resulted in important benefits, especially in neuroradiology. Indeed, their high gradient power and field intensity (3.0 T) allow adjunctive and more advanced diagnostic methodologies to be performed with excellent resolution in a fraction of the acquisition time required with earlier machines. The purpose of this paper is to illustrate the distinctive semeiological characteristics of 3.0-T morphological and angiographic brain imaging compared with lower-field systems and highlight the respective advantages and drawbacks based on the experience gained in the first 5 years from the installation of a 3.0-T magnet."
CD009372,0,23564127,0,Usefulness of intraoperative computed tomography for the evacuation of lobar hemorrhage.,"There is a lot of debate on the treatment method for spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Intraoperative computed tomography (iCT) provides excellent images of cerebrovascular lesions. In this paper, we describe the surgical procedure and the efficacy of iCT during lobar hemorrhage evacuations and subsequent patient outcomes. Fifty-eight patients with lobar hemorrhage were treated using iCT. We performed preoperative cerebral angiography and/or three-dimensional (3D) CT angiography to detect abnormal vessels and identify the spatial relationships between the cerebrovascular structures and the hematoma. After administration of local anesthesia, an enlarged burr-hole was created just above the hematoma. Microsurgical evacuation of the hematoma was performed, and an iCT image was obtained to assess real-time 3D information on residual hematoma or unexpected rebleeding. Mean hematoma volume, evacuation rate, and duration of the surgery were 42 mL, 93 %, and 89 min respectively. Postoperative rebleeding occurred in 1 case. The median Glasgow Coma Scale score upon admission was 12. At discharge, most patients (60 %) had good functional outcomes defined by modified Rankin Scale scores of 0-3. Postoperative neurological findings and consciousness levels showed early improvement. Safe, accurate, and effective evacuation of lobar hemorrhage was possible with iCT as an image-guided intraoperative navigation tool."

CD009372,0,871004,0,Traumatic intracerebral hematoma with stable neurological deficit.,"The possibility of an intracerebral hematoma may be overlooked in the presence of a ""fixed"" neurologic deficit. The clinical complex that is emphasized is composed of (a) ipsilateral cranial trauma, (b) early development of focal neurological deficit, (c) a plateau in the subsequent course of the disease, (d) the delayed appearance of a positive radioactive isotope scan, and (e) a focal area of distorted vessels in angiographic studies. The availability of the computer tomographic scan has made the diagnosis of intracerebral hematomas more certain but it is important that the possibility of a hematoma be considered and pertinent investigations be performed. Even after diagnosis, an operative procedure may be delayed in patients who are neurologically stable. In the five cases presented, the diagnosis of cerebral contusion led to a delay in operative evacuation which was associated with improvement in the previously stable neurological deficit."

Our experience does not support such a conclusion. We report our experiences in 25 patients with SAH, who had a normal initial angiogram. Aneurysms were seen in five of 20 cases when angiography was repeated. On subsequent review of the initial angiograms, the aneurysm was apparent in four of the five cases. When these four initial angiograms were shown to a second observer, unaware of the results of the second study, three of the four aneurysms were correctly identified. We suggest that if, under strong clinical suspicion of SAH, the angiogram is reported as normal the study should be reviewed by a second neuro-radiologist before proceeding to repeat angiography."

CD009372,0,9601953,0,Intracranial vascular malformations.,"Many efforts and much research have been dedicated to the field of non-invasive angiographic techniques in the past few years. Thanks first to magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and subsequently to computed tomographic angiography (CTA), very interesting results have been obtained in the diagnosis of cerebrovascular diseases. Neck vessels are most successfully evaluated by both MRA and CTA, and the need for digital subtraction angiography (DSA) examinations in patients at risk for vascular occlusions has significantly decreased. The role and the diagnostic accuracy of these non-invasive modalities in intracranial vascular pathology is still under investigation, and several studies have been and are being performed. Both techniques have a better spatial resolution and sensitivity in detecting cerebrovascular malformations than DSA. In the diagnosis of cerebral aneurysms, both MRA and CTA - due to their high sensitivity - have become screening techniques in the population at risk for subarachnoid hemorrhage, these techniques may become basic diagnostic modalities in treatment planning. The results are less satisfying in the evaluation of brain arteriovenous malformations and in the different steps of pre- and post-therapeutic evaluation."

CD009372,0,2416213,0,Experimental chronic cerebrovascular spasm in the monkey: an assessment of the functional changes in the cerebral arteries and their protection by diltiazem.,"The structure and function of cerebral arteries obtained from a monkey model of chronic cerebral vascular spasm 5 days after hemorrhage have been examined. Narrowing of the larger cerebral arteries demonstrated by angiography at all sites of measurement seems to be due primarily to an increased wall rigidity associated with cellular damage, the resultant inflammatory response and large, long-lasting spontaneous increases in muscle tone. Changes in agonist sensitivity were extremely variable. The reduction of contractility of the vessel wall to a mean of 30% of control diminished the consequence of any changes in active tone characteristics. Neurogenic control on the side of the lesion was remarkably depressed. When treated with diltiazem, beginning 1 day before induction of hemorrhage and continuing to the time of sacrifice, arterial diameter was reduced at only 1 of the 6 standard sites of measurement and then by only a small amount. Neurologic effects invariably seen in the untreated monkeys were prevented by diltiazem. Many of the changes in the artery wall, including structural alterations, were diminished by the drug. Abnormal spontaneous myogenic tone was present but was less in the diltiazem-treated group; however, nerve damage and its functional consequences were not prevented. It is concluded that diltiazem, presumably by preventing the accumulation of intracellular calcium within the cell, prevents the initial events in the evolution of chronic cerebrovasospasm or narrowing. This is probably achieved by a diminishing of the direct vasoconstrictor effects and the toxicity of putative spasmogens released from blood clots, nerves and the brain on the vascular smooth muscle, thus interrupting the sequence leading to pathologic change."

All of these patients were examined at the Mayo Clinic between 1976 and 1989, and all available cerebral arteriograms were reviewed by a neuroradiologist. Follow-up information was obtained for 52 patients (96%) until death or treatment intervention, or for at least 1 year after diagnosis, with a mean follow-up period of 6.6 years. Throughout this 6.6-year follow-up period, ICH related to dural AVF occurred in five of the 52 patients, for a crude risk of hemorrhage of 1.6% per year. The risk of hemorrhage at the time of mean follow-up examination was 1.8% per year. Angiographic examination revealed several characteristics that were considered potential predictors of ICH during the follow-up period. Lesions of the petrosal sinus and straight sinus had a higher propensity to bleed, although the small numbers in the series precluded a definite conclusion. A person suffering from a dural AVF with a venous varix on a draining vein had an increased risk of hemorrhage, whereas no hemorrhage was seen in the 20 patients without a varix (p < 0.05). Lesions draining into leptomeningeal veins had an increased occurrence of hemorrhage, although this increased risk was not statistically significant. Patients' initial symptoms were compared to those at follow-up evaluation. Pulsatile tinnitus improved in more than half of the 52 patients, and resolved in 75% of those showing some improvement. Individuals without a sinus or venous outflow occlusion at initial cerebral angiography were more likely to improve or remain stable (89%), whereas patients with an occlusion showed infrequent improvement (11%; p < 0.05)."
CD009372,0,506289,0,[Occlusive cerebrovascular disease without angiographic evidence of stenosis of cerebral arteries (author's transl)].,"The angiographs of patients suffering from transient ischaemic attacks and ischaemic strokes were reviewed.

In 33 out of 69 patients the angiographs showed no arterial stenosis in the area corresponding to the neurological deficit. However, in this group of patients the incidence of elongation and dilatation of the arteries was significantly higher than in the group with visible stenosis. Among the patients without visible stenoses there was also a significantly higher incidence of hypertension, especially with an elevation of the diastolic blood pressure, and of symptoms related to the brain stem. The possibility is discussed that a special form of occlusive cerebrovascular disease exists, whereby the characteristic angiographic features are not circumscribed stenoses, but a generalized elongation and dilatation of the arteries.

A subarachnoidal haemorrhage was suspected and cerebral CT scanning showed small amounts of subarachnoidal blood distributed symmetrically over both cerebral hemispheres - an unusual location for aneurismal bleeding. Liquor analysis revealed erythrocytes, positive bilirubin and slightly elevated protein. Subsequent cerebral MRI showed no signs of aneurysm, vascular malformation, venous sinus thrombosis or infarction. An intraarterial cerebral angiography was then performed and showed bilateral widespread segmental vasoconstriction in the anterior, middle and posterior cerebral arteries. A diagnostic workup on systemic vasculitis was negative. The patient's good general condition in spite of extensive angiographic findings rendered the diagnosis cerebral vasculitis unlikely. A state of reversible cerebral segmental vasoconstriction was suspected and the patient was treated with the calcium antagonist nifedipine and observed for four weeks. Cerebral angiography was then repeated and found to be normal. This case report highlights a less recognized and probably underdiagnosed cause of subarachnoidal bleeding."

A 51-year-old man with a history of atrial fibrillation who was taking dabigatran presented with an acute ischemic stroke. The patient had a normal international normalized ratio, activated partial thromboplastin time, and an elevated thrombin time of 26.4 seconds. Recanalization of the middle cerebral artery with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator was apparent on digital subtraction angiography, and there was no evidence of intracerebral hemorrhage on the repeat computed tomographic scan.

CD009372,0,1950905,0,Nonaneurysmal perimesencephalic subarachnoid hemorrhage: CT and MR patterns that differ from aneurysmal rupture.,"We describe a characteristic distribution of cisternal blood in 52 patients with nonaneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage proved by a normal angiogram. On CT, the center of the bleeding was located immediately anterior to the brainstem in all patients, which was confirmed in four patients who were studied with MR imaging. Extension to the ambient cisterns or to the basal parts of the sylvian fissures was common, but the lateral sylvian or anterior interhemispheric fissures were never completely filled with blood. Rupture into the ventricular system did not occur. MR demonstrated downward extension of the blood anterior to the brainstem as far as the medulla, but failed to detect the source of hemorrhage. Our aim was to determine whether this so-called nonaneurysmal perimesencephalic hemorrhage could be distinguished from aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage on early CT scans. Two neuroradiologists were shown a consecutive series of 221 CT scans of patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage who subsequently underwent angiography. Only one patient with a basilar artery aneurysm on angiography was incorrectly labeled by both observers as having a nonaneurysmal perimesencephalic pattern of hemorrhage. The high predictive value of the perimesencephalic pattern of hemorrhage for a normal angiogram (0.95 and 0.94, respectively, for the two observers) and the excellent interobserver agreement (kappa 0.87) demonstrate that nonaneurysmal perimesencephalic hemorrhage can be distinguished on CT in the majority of patients. Recognition of this pattern of hemorrhage is important as patients with this subset of subarachnoid hemorrhage have an excellent prognosis."

A 23 year-old woman, who had undergone surgical closure of ventricular septal defect at age 2, suffered headache and general fatigue after dental treatment. She was admitted to another institution, and examinations revealed bacterial endcarditis. She was transferred to our hospital, and underwent aortic valve replacement. After the valve replacement, CT revealed parenchymal hematoma in the left frontal lobe. CT angiography (CTA) and cerebral angiography (CAG) demonstrated an aneurysm at the distal branch of the left middle cerebral artery. T2* weighted image demonstrated multiple signal loss lesions, which were not revealed by CAG and CTA. We speculated that these signal loss lesions were thrombosed mycotic intracranial aneurysms. She underwent left frontotemporal craniotomy, and the aneurysm was resected. Mycotic aneurysms are rare neurovascular lesions but their mortality and morbidity are high, so careful follow-up examinations are required.

Head CT scan demonstrated subarachnoid hemorrhage. Cerebral angiography showed the absence of the right internal carotid artery, and skull base CT of the bone window level revealed the absence of the right carotid canal. The right middle cerebral artery (MCA) and anterior cerebral artery (ACA) were opacified from the left internal carotid artery. The right A1 portion was hypoplastic and the distal portion of the right M1 portion was replaced by several minute complicated anastomotic vessels connected to the right M2 portion. The right MCA territory was mainly supplied by collateral flow from the right ACA and the right posterior cerebral artery via the leptomeningeal anastomosis. These was neither aneurysm nor arteriovenous malformation. The second angiography, 1 week after the initial angiography, showed the same hemodynamic pattern and aneurysms were not found. We diagnosed the patient as agenesis of the right internal carotid artery and the etiology of subarachnoid hemorrhage was suspected to be a rupture of the anastomotic vessels between the right M1 and M2. She was discharged on the 21st hospital day without any neurological deficit."

It means that changes of cerebral vessels are reversible after treatment with corticosteroids and calcium channel blockers, so these abnormalities are believed to reflect vasospasm rather than true vasculitis. The diagnosis is made on the basis of clinical presentation, brain magnetic resonance imaging and cerebral angiography. We present a young man with acute onset of headache and neurologic impairment secondary to ischemic stroke with intracerebral and subarachnoid hemorrhage. Cerebral angiography showed characteristic findings of diffuse vasculitis but good response to treatment with corticosteroids and calcium channel blockers distinguish this benign angiopathy from the more aggressive form of the central nervous system vasculitis."

The patient was transferred to our hospital for embolization of the basilar tip aneurysm. Endovascular embolization was performed using Guglielmi detachable coils (GDCs), and the aneurysm was completely occluded with preservation of the parent artery.

CD009372,0,19004542,0,Expression of a latent ophthalmic artery collateral circulation after extracranial-intracranial bypass.,"We present the case of an unexpected response by the cerebral vasculature to bypass surgery. A 66-year-old man sustained a subarachnoid haemorrhage and cerebral angiography showed a large fusiform anterior communicating artery (ACoA) aneurysm and an anomalous anterior circulation. The right A1 segment was hypoplastic and blood supply to the entire right A2 was from the left anterior circulation via the ACoA. The aneurysm was therefore not amenable to endovascular coiling or surgical clipping alone. An extracranial-intracranial bypass was performed to revascularize the territory of the right A2 independently of the ACoA to allow the latter vessel to be clipped. Although the bypass graft was patent on post-operative cerebral angiography, it was in fact only perfusing a limited, peripheral anterior cerebral artery territory. The bulk of the right anterior circulation was derived retrogradely by latent collaterals from the internal carotid and ophthalmic arteries via small dural vessels which were not apparent prior to surgery."

CD009372,0,40442,0,[Progress of technical medicine within the field of gerontoneurology (author's transl)].,"1938 respectively 1978 are dates for progress of technical medicine concerning gerontoneurology. Following the discussion of the development in technical (apparatus), chemical and immunological diagnostic activities in neurology the applicability in elderly people should be described. On principle there are no methods of investigations which cannot be used in geriatric causes. Main point of interest is the correct indication. Non invasive methods can be used without somatic risk; one has to observe only the fact of psychological stress for the patient; indications of invasive methods (merely angiography of vessels within the brain) must be focused on special diagnosis of the illness. Suspicious facts of space occupying intracranial process almost everytime ask for angiography following EEG and cranial computertomography. In cases of arteriosclerosis in aged people with typical changes within the vessel system of the brain one should only use angiographical investigations if clinical findings (based on noninvasive methods) show indications for surgical treatment in extracranial regions of the brain vessels. It might be the same procedure if shunt-operation between carotis externa and interna circulation system can be expected as curative or prophylactic influence within the neurological condition. In these cases risk of selective angiography of the vessels within the brain (outgoing from arteria femoralis) are much less dangerous than in direct charges. First of all neurological status, general condition and age will be decive for medical indication.

A child is reported with thalamic stroke in whom cerebral arteriography revealed vertebral artery compression on head turning.

Radiosurgery does not immediately lead to obliteration of the malformation, which often does not occur until years following treatment. Post-obliteration hemorrhage is rare, occurring months to years after radiosurgery, and has been associated with residual or recurrent AVM despite prior apparent nidus elimination. Three cases are reported of delayed intracranial hemorrhage in patients with cerebral AVMs treated with radiosurgery in which no residual AVM was found on catheter angiography at the time of delayed post-treatment hemorrhage. That the pathophysiology of these hemorrhages involves progressive venous outflow occlusion is speculated and the possible mechanistic link to subsequent vascular rupture is discussed."

CT and 3D-CT angiography showed subaracnoid hemorrhage and intracranial hemorrhage in the left hemisphere due to a saccular aneurysm at the occluded M2 portion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA). Her present illness started with a toothache and lumber pain 3 weeks earlier. Echocardiography revealed active infective endocarditis. We could have treated her by administering antibiotics, but during a cerebral angiography, she became comatose due to an aneurismal rerupture. Immediately, an emergency operation for aneurismal trapping was performed, but she died 19 days later because of left hemispheric swelling. We report a relatively rare case of infectious aneurysm at the proximal artery and discuss the pitfalls of its diagnosis and treatment. We should educate general physicians about infectious endocarditis because misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis of infectious aneurysm due to endocarditis results in unpleasant outcomes. We should treat infectious aneurysm at the proximal side artery by first administering antibiotics, and if necessary, subsequent direct surgery of the aneurismal trapping should be performed with a bypass.

Two groups were defined. Group A consisted of 8 patients with diseases commonly associated with CNS aspergillosis: leukemia, lymphoma, aplastic anemia, and renal transplantation. Group B contained 9 patients with various illnesses not generally known to be associated with CNS aspergillosis. CNS aspergillosis was diagnosed and treated before death in only 1 patient. Patients in Group A received cytotoxic drugs, often had granulocytopenia, less commonly had focal neurological deficits, and seldom had seizures. Group B patients were not granulocytopenic, received no cytotoxic agents, underwent nontransplant surgery, and more frequently had focal neurological deficits. Eleven of the 17 patients (65%) had focal deficits, most of them hemiparesis. Meningeal signs were rare, but the cerebrospinal fluid was usually abnormal. The principal neuropathological process was Aspergillus invasion of blood vessels causing hemorrhagic infarction. Focal clinical deficits correlated neuroanatomically with Aspergillus lesions. In 2 patients, such lesions were detected by 99mTc-DTPA or cerebral angiography before computed tomographic scanning. The lungs were the usual portal of entry, but isolated CNS lesions occurred in 2 patients.

In our study of 277 patients carried out over an 18 month period, the most common reason of referral was subarachnoid haemorrhage followed by trauma. Aneurysms were the most common diagnosis (36%) with anterior and posterior communicating arteries being the most common locations. Fifty percent (50%) of patients investigated had a normal study. Our findings show that the yield from MDCTA and conventional angiography was relatively comparable, however, conventional angiography was superior in detection of aneurysms; hence, in cases were the MDCTA result was found to be normal despite a high index of suspicion for a subarachnoid haemorrhage, a follow-up MDCTA study or conventional angiography is useful.

Raised BFV may be caused by vessel narrowing or by hyperperfusion. In 44 SCD patients and 14 controls, intracranial arterial BFVs and global cerebral blood flow (CBF) were analyzed by TCCS and extracranial duplex ultrasound, respectively. Magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiography were performed in all patients with pathologic intracranial BFV rise. Intracranial BFVs and CBF in SCD were significantly higher than in controls. CBF in SCD correlated with BFV in all intracranial arteries and correlated inversely with age and hemoglobin values. Magnetic resonance angiography failed to demonstrate any stenosis in our SCD patients, thus raised intracranial BFVs must be interpreted as an anemia-dependent cerebral hyperperfusion. These findings suggest that the pathomechanism of stenosis-derived arterio-arterial embolism might be less relevant in SCD-related ischemic stroke, and other factors like small vessel disease or sickle cell-induced microvascular blood clotting have to be considered."

TCCD is relatively inexpensive and permits bedside examination. It improves the accuracy and reliability of conventional transcranial Doppler studies. The main limitation of TCCD are the ultrasonic windows. They restrict the area of insonation to the major cerebral arteries and the proximal part of its branches, lower the spatial resolution, and may prevent transtemporal insonation. Using MRA, both large and small intracranial arteries and veins can be imaged by selecting the appropriate imaging parameters. MRA provides morphologic information about the cerebral vessels, relying on blood flow as the physical basis for generating contrast between stationary tissues and moving spins. MRA is highly sensitive for the detection of occlusive disease in large intracranial arteries. However, with bright blood techniques the degree of stenosis tends to be exaggerated. Flow direction, eg, in collaterals, can be determined by selective or phase-contrast MRA. Perfusion imaging techniques provide information about blood flow at the capillary level. Diffusion imaging depicts molecular motion. TCCD and MRA used in combination or alone may eliminate the need for intra-arterial digital subtraction angiography (DSA) in most patients studied for occlusive cerebrovascular disease. DSA may be reserved for those patients where there is disagreement among the noninvasive techniques, and for the diagnosis of cerebral aneurysms and arteriovenous malformations. CTA relies on spiral CT technology and intravenous contrast injection. To date, intracranial use has been predominantly for the diagnosis of aneurysms. The role of CTA for the detection of nonaneurysmal intracranial vascular disease has yet to be established."

Despite extensive research, to date no effective treatment of vasospasm exists. Prostacyclin is a potent vasodilator and inhibitor of platelet aggregation. In vitro models have shown a relaxing effect of prostacyclin after induced contraction in cerebral arteries, and a recent pilot trial showed a positive effect on cerebral vasospasm in a clinical setting.

For this purpose the method of ultrasonic dopplerography with subsequent bilateral axillar cerebral angiography was used. The examinations were performed by the transcutaneous method in the author's modification. This made it possible to evaluate reliably the hemodynamics in the vertebral arteries in each patient using the asymmetry coefficient related to the linear speed of the blood flow in the vessels. It was found that in increase of the asymmetry coefficient by 50% or more was, as a rule, associated with an occluding process in one of the vertebral arteries. The agreement between the dopplerographic and the angiographic findings was observed in 80% of the cases of occlusions, and in 85,7% of the cases of vertebral artery stenoses. This makes it possible to recommend the ultrasonic dopplerography method for broad use in polyclinic conditions for examining patients with vertebrobasilar pathology, and for screening persons with an increased risk of cerebrovascular diseases."

CD009372,0,3748295,0,[A case of aneurysm at the junction of the vertebral artery and a spinal arterial branch].,"A 68-year-old male suffered from severe occipitalgia, nausea, and vomiting was admitted to our hospital. On admission, he complained only of headache and displayed no evidence of disturbed consciousness or neurological deficits. A computed tomographic (CT) scan revealed a subarachnoid hemorrhage in the basal subarachnoid cisterns, with the thickest, densest area in the bilateral ambient cisterns. Four-vessel angiograms disclosed no pathological findings. The patient was treated with bed rest and his blood pressure was maintained below 120 mmHg. Fortunately, no untoward events occurred during the period of bed rest, and a second vertebral angiogram was obtained 4 weeks after admission. At that time a vertebral artery aneurysm was discovered. At surgery a 3 X 3 X 3 mm aneurysm was found at the junction of the vertebral artery and a branch of the spinal artery. Small clots surrounding the aneurysm were removed. The aneurysm itself was easily clipped without destruction of the caudal cranial nerves and the patient recovered fully. The incidence of vertebral artery aneurysms is very small--about 5%. Moreover, to our knowledge an aneurysm on the proximal portion of the intracranial vertebral artery at the junction of the posterior-inferior cerebellar artery has never before been reported. On the other hand, our case might have been included among cases of subarachnoid hemorrhage of unknown etiology. The first cerebral angiogram revealed no aneurysm; it was found on the second set of angiograms. This case illustrates the importance of repeat angiography when the CT scan clearly shows a subarachnoid hemorrhage."

One hundred and sixteen presented with stroke (63%) and 68 patients with TIA (37%). One hundred and twenty-two were men (66.3%) and 62 were women (33.7%), mean age 63.5 years, range 25-86. The monitoring identified twelve (6.5%) patients with significant arrhythmias undetected by history, examination and admission electrocardiogram: six with atrial fibrillation (AF), four with 2 degrees heart block type Mobitz II and one each with 3 degrees heart block and sick sinus syndrome. Two-D echocardiography showed a previously unknown potential source for cardiac emboli in 22 patients (17.3%): segmental ventricular disease in eleven, mitral valve prolapse in seven, left ventricular thrombus in six, left ventricular aneurysm in three and one each with mitral valve endocarditis and global myocardial dysfunction. Only the mitral valve findings were expected on the basis of a previous M-mode echocardiographic study carried out in our city on healthy elderly volunteers. From the clinical history and all cardiac investigations, we found 59 patients (32%) with a possible cardiac source for cerebral emboli. After cerebral angiography, 29 of these 59 patients also showed a vascular lesion in the appropriate carotid artery and we could not decide definitely which lesion was responsible for the cerebral embolus. In the remaining 30 patients (16.4%), the evidence implicated the heart as the most likely source.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD009372,0,9039593,0,Contrast agents in functional MR imaging.,"Contrast agents have greatly expanded the role of MR imaging (MRI) to allow assessment of physiologic, or ""functional,"" parameters. Although activation mapping generally does not require contrast agents, other forms of functional MRI, including mapping of cerebral hemodynamics (eg, perfusion imaging), are best done with the use of contrast agents. Serial echo planar images are obtained after bolus injection of lanthanide chelates. Application of susceptibility contrast physics and standard tracer kinetic principles permits generation of relative cerebral blood volume maps. Deconvolution of cerebral blood flow and mean transit time parameters is also possible within technical limitations. By using diffusion and perfusion pulse sequences, an imaging correlate to the ischemic penumbra can be identified. Functional MRI perfusion imaging of intraaxial tumors is analogous to positron emission tomography for delineation of metabolic activity, yet may be even more sensitive to neovascularity and possesses improved image quality. Clinical applications include biopsy site selection and postirradiation follow-up. Further improvements in data analysis and map generation techniques may improve diagnostic accuracy and utility."

The field of magnetic resonance (MR) angiography attempts to overcome this limitation by creating images that depict blood vessels in a projective format similar to a conventional invasive angiogram, but without the need for ionizing radiation or a contrast agent. This article reviews basic concepts involved in MR angiography, including signal changes from time-of-flight and phase effects, maximum intensity projection algorithm for postprocessing of two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) image sets, and methods for flow quantification. Potential problems with MR angiography are considered, as well as means to overcome them."
CD009372,0,17290111,0,Traumatic cervical artery dissection.,"Traumatic cervical artery dissection (TCAD) is a complication of severe blunt head or neck trauma, the main cause being motor vehicle accidents. TCAD are increasingly recognized, and incidences of up to 0.86% for internal carotid and 0.53% for traumatic vertebral artery dissections (TVAD) among blunt trauma victims are reported. Diagnostic evaluation for TCAD is mandatory in the presence of (1) hemorrhage of potential arterial origin originating from the nose, ears, mouth, or a wound; (2) expanding cervical hematoma; (3) cervical bruit in a patient >50 years of age; (4) evidence of acute infarct at brain imaging; (5) unexplained central or lateralizing neurological deficit or transient ischemic attack, or (6) Horner syndrome, neck or head pain. In addition, a number of centers screen asymptomatic patients with blunt trauma for TCAD. Catheter angiography is the standard of reference for diagnosis of TCAD. Color duplex ultrasound, computed tomographic, and magnetic resonance angiography are noninvasive screening alternatives, but each method has its diagnostic limitations compared to catheter angiography. Anticoagulants and antiplatelet drugs may prevent ischemic stroke, but bleeding from traumatized tissues may offset the benefits of antithrombotic treatment. Endovascular therapy of dissected vessels, thrombarterectomy, direct suture of intimal tears, and extracranial-intracranial bypass should be considered in exceptional cases. Neurological outcome is probably worse in TCAD compared to spontaneous CAD, although it is unclear whether this is due to dissection-induced ischemic stroke or associated traumatic lesions."
CD009372,0,1537066,0,Pediatric magnetic resonance angiography: assessment of stroke.,"Thirty-one (59.6%) of 52 magnetic resonance angiographic (MRA) studies performed on pediatric patients were for evaluation of strokes. Thirteen of the 31 patients (41.9%) of MRA studies were positive for either vascular occlusion or congenital vascular malformation (arteriovenous, venous, or aneurysm). Results indicate that MRA is a valuable noninvasive diagnostic tool that can be routinely performed as part of the initial magnetic resonance evaluation, often thereby avoiding the need for conventional angiography in occlusive vascular disease, and permitting the performance of conventional angiography, in the case of vascular malformations, later when the patient is stable."
CD009372,0,1537068,0,Intracranial magnetic resonance angiography.,"Intraarterial angiography remains the ""gold standard"" for the evaluation of the intracranial vasculature, but it carries with it the risks of local vascular damage, systemic reactions, transient neurologic deficits, permanent neurologic compromise, and even death. To date, magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) has been applied to a variety of different manifestations of intracranial vascular disease. Presently, MRA studies and flow measurement techniques serve to compliment the more traditional spin-echo evaluation of patients with small aneurysms, arterial and venous occlusions, vascular malformations, and in some cases of neoplastic vascular invasion. Practically, the limitations of these techniques must be taken into account such that the appropriate method is applied to answer a specific clinical question and the acquisition parameters are chosen to maximize the sensitivity and specificity of the study. The intent of this review is to summarize the technical approaches, clinical role, pitfalls, and potential improvements in the MRA techniques as they apply to the intracranial circulation."

CD009372,0,1998890,0,The stroke syndrome of striatocapsular infarction.,"Striatocapsular infarction has recently been described as a distinct stroke entity and forms an important subgroup of subcortical infarctions. In a prospective study of 50 consecutive patients over a 10 yr period with this syndrome, clinical and neuropsychological features, pathogenesis and outcome were studied to provide information concerning management and prognosis. The most common clinical presentation was that of a stroke affecting mainly the upper limb with cortical signs such as dysphasia, neglect or dyspraxia. Evidence from EEG, angiographic and neuropsychological data supported a vascular/haemodynamic basis for the presence of the acute neuropsychological changes, while the chronic changes were more likely to be due to diaschisis. A study of risk factors and cerebral angiography enabled 4 pathophysiological subgroups to be identified: (1) cardiac emboli to the origin of the middle cerebral artery; (2) severe extra-cranial cranial carotid artery occlusive disease with presumed embolism to the same site and/or involvement of haemodynamic factors; (3) proximal middle cerebral artery abnormalities causing occlusion of multiple lateral striate arteries at their origins; (4) normal angiography where pathogenesis was uncertain. The risk factors of cardiac disease and smoking were significantly increased as compared with age and sex-matched controls with other forms of ischaemic stroke. Stroke or vascular death rate was 2.7% per yr during a mean follow-up period of 2.25 yrs. Predictors of an excellent recovery with return to normal lifestyle were younger age, only brachial or brachiofacial weakness with absence of cortical signs at presentation and minimal change on angiography. This stroke entity deserves particular recognition in the spectrum of subcortical infarctions because of its specific pathogenesis, distinct neuropsychological features and reasonable prognosis."

The sensor is 0.5 mm in diameter and was inserted into cortex tissue in 14 patients undergoing craniotomy for cerebrovascular surgery. A compromised cerebral circulation was identified in 8 of 14 patients by single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) scan, cerebral angiography, and transient ischemic episodes before surgery. Under baseline conditions with isoflurane anesthesia and normal blood gases, tissue P02 was lower in the eight compromised compared to six noncompromised patients (noncompromised 37 +/- 12 mm Hg, compromised 10 +/- 5 mm Hg; P < 0.05), PCO2 was increased (noncompromised 49 +/- 5 mm Hg, compromised 72 +/- 23 mm Hg; P < 0.05), and pH was decreased (noncompromised 7.16 +/- 0.08, compromised 6.82 +/- 0.21; P < 0.05). Critical tissue values for the identification of ischemia were a P02 of 20 mm Hg, PCO2 of 60 mm Hg, and a pH of 7.0. These results suggest that brain tissue measures of P02, PCO2, and pH provide information on the adequacy of cerebral perfusion in neurosurgical patients."

Computerized tomography (CT) and gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging demonstrated a large nonhomogeneous contrast-enhancing mass of the left frontal lobe, with a large cystic component. Cerebral angiography revealed the lesion to be highly vascular and fed entirely by the internal carotid artery system. The patient underwent craniotomy and the lesion was completely removed. Neuropathological study revealed that the tumor was a ganglioglioma. On review of the literature, it was found that gangliogliomas often present in the second and third decade, are known to have cystic components, and are contrast-enhancing on CT and MR imaging; however, they are classically known to be avascular on angiography. This case of a markedly vascular ganglioglioma emphasizes that these tumors should be included in the differential diagnosis of vascular supratentorial lesions."

In this study 44 patients with 45 ICH were included. All patients were investigated with MSCT and FD-CT during angiographic evaluation. As a control group we included 16 patients without ICH. In each haematoma we assessed volumetric data of the ICH and counted the numbers of ICH-positive slices. Using interobserver ratings, we additionally investigated the potential of FD-CT to serve as a diagnostic tool to detect ICH. In FD-CT three haematomas were not detected because of motion and beam-hardening artefacts in the region close to the skull base. The r value for the degree of interobserver agreement for the number of slices was 0.95 for MSCT and 0.94 for FD-CT. Measurements of the area and the calculated volume of the ICH showed high inter- and intraobserver agreement. Our results indicate that FD-CT is a helpful tool in the daily emergency management of ICH patients as detection of ICH was found to be nearly as reliable as in MSCT. Limitations of this technology are motion and beam-hardening artefacts that may mask small haematomas located in the posterior fossa or the skull base."

The association of BA aplasia with two aneurysms on the dominant posterior communicating artery (PCoA) has not been previously reported. This 40-year-old man presented in a state of drowsiness and responded to simple commands only after being coaxed. He had complete left cranial third nerve palsy, right hemiparesis, and persisting signs of meningeal irritation. A computerized tomography (CT) scan revealed subarachnoid and intraventricular hemorrhage. An angiogram revealed BA aplasia. The right PCoA followed a sinuous course with multiple loops and provided the dominant supply to the posterior circulation. This vessel harbored two aneurysms, one at the origin of the PCoA from the internal carotid artery and the other at the looping segment just proximal to the brainstem. The left PCoA was extremely thin. The pterional transsylvian approach was used to clip the two aneurysms on the PCoA. The hemodynamic changes produced by the BA aplasia may have produced alterations in the cerebral vasculature leading to aneurysm formation and consequent subarachnoid hemorrhage."
CD009372,0,11296888,0,Cerebral cast angiography as an aid to medicolegal autopsies in cases of death after adult cardiac surgery.,"Due to an increase in age of the patient population in cardiac surgery, cerebral complications are increasing in frequency, also as a cause of death. In order to reveal cerebral pathology associated with a fatal outcome after cardiac surgery, we re-evaluated the cast angiographs and medico-legal autopsy documents of 144 adult cardiac surgery subjects over a 7-year period. Special attention was paid to the ability of post-mortem cast angiography to aid in diagnosing cerebral pathology. The autopsy detected new ischemic cerebral lesions in 29 (20%) cases, of which 22 (15.3%) were recent infarcts, and 7 were cases of anoxic brain damage. Of the recent cerebral infarcts, 12 were associated with cerebral artery thrombosis, 4 showed multiple lesions, and the remaining 6 were small single infarcts. In addition, one subject had an intracerebral hemorrhage and 72 (50%) cerebral edema. By cast angiography, the leakage of contrast medium in the case of intracerebral hemorrhage and stenoses of intracranial and cervical arteries could be well demonstrated and also revealed 17 (77%) of the 22 recent cerebral infarcts. It was found to be suitable for detecting recent brain infarcts associated with main cerebral artery thrombosis, with a sensitivity of 92% (11 out of 12 cases), but was less sensitive in showing small recent infarcts with a sensitivity of 60% (6 out of 10 cases) and inferior for the older ones where none of the 6 cases were detected. Filling defects caused by cerebral edema were difficult to differentiate from technical errors and were encountered in 7 (4.8%) cases. A significant predictor for the 29 recent ischemic brain lesions was perioperative hypotension. The immediate cause of death was most often of cardiac (83%) and cerebral (14%) origin. In 14 cases, cerebral damage was considered to be an additional cause of death. The use of cerebral post-mortem cast angiography should be recommended, especially for its excellent ability to visualize intravascular pathology such as arterial stenoses and thromboses, with a 92% sensitivity in showing new main cerebral artery thromboses, before likely distortion of the vascular anatomy by dissection."

CD009372,0,2512776,0,Comparison of MR imaging with clinical history in the identification of hemorrhage in patients with cerebral arteriovenous malformations.,"Twenty-nine patients with true arteriovenous malformations as diagnosed by MR imaging or angiography were examined by MR to detect the presence of hemosiderin deposition, a marker for remote hemorrhage. The resulting information was compared with the clinical record to determine the frequency with which MR demonstrated prior hemorrhagic episodes where no clinical evidence for such episodes existed. Twenty (69%) of 29 patients with arteriovenous malformations showed evidence of acute or older hemorrhage. In four (14%) of 29 cases MR showed a hypointense signal on long TR images, suggesting hemosiderin, but no clinical history could account for prior hemorrhage. Additionally, six (21%) of 29 patients had a clinical history suggestive of acute hemorrhage, but no evidence of bleeding was found on MR. The presence of prior or current hemorrhage is critical to deciding whether to surgically resect the arteriovenous malformation or to treat it conservatively, because of the high rate of rebleeding in patients presenting with hemorrhage or those with a history of this disorder. For this reason, MR imaging has an important role in the management of patients with arteriovenous malformations."

All patients underwent unenhanced and contrast-enhanced computer tomography and magnetic resonance tomography, as well as selective angiography, and were followed for at least 2 years. In 40% (17 of 43) of patients a cryptic vascular malformation was found in the proximity to the developmental venous anomaly. Neurological symptoms were present in 8 of 17 patients (47%) in this group. Patients with an isolated developmental venous anomaly had symptoms in 19% (5 of 26), but none of them had experienced a hemorrhage. Magnetic resonance was the most sensitive method for the diagnosis of both types of lesions and alterations of the adjacent parenchyma. These results further support that developmental venous anomalies represent a clinically benign entity. However, patients with an association of a developmental venous anomaly and a cryptic vascular malformation are at risk for hemorrhage from their angiographically occult vascular malformation. Magnetic resonance proved to be the imaging modality of choice for both entities and is appropriate for diagnosis and follow-up."

Initial computed tomography (CT) revealed a subcutaneous hematoma and cast formation of intraventricular clots without the deposition of subarachnoid blood in any basal cistern. Cerebral angiography revealed a small AVM located in the right parietal lobe without aneurysmal formations. Repeat CT demonstrated no evidence of subarachnoid clots expected with the presence of intraventricular clots and she was transferred to a general ward. She suffered sudden onset of motor aphasia and disturbance of consciousness on Day 17 after the hemorrhage. Magnetic resonance imaging indicated diffuse cortical infarction and subsequent magnetic resonance angiography revealed severe narrowing of the bilateral internal carotid arteries. Three-dimensional CT angiography on the same day indicated similar findings. She was transferred back to the intensive care unit for critical treatment. However, she suffered persistent mild right hemiparesis and motor aphasia. The characteristic features of vasospasm after intraventricular hemorrhage from AVMs are delayed onset, acute deterioration of consciousness, female predominance, and localization to the bilateral internal carotid arteries. Treatment of patients with AVM rupture should consider the risk of severe vasospasm, even if there is no subarachnoid clot."

CD009372,0,660265,0,Occlusive arteriopathy and brain tumor.,"Four cases with the association of occlusive arteriopathy and brain tumor are presented. A clinical analysis of these cases and cases reported in the literature revealed that occlusive arteriopathy at the base of the brain was often associated with a slowly growing basal tumor in children. Possible causes of occlusive arteriopathy in these cases were compression of the circle of Willis by a slowly growing basal tumor, secondary artial occlusive changes by radiation therapy for a basal tumor, or vasculopathy associated with neurocutaneous syndrome. Symptoms of sudden onset or episodic nature suggest the presence of occlusive arteriopathy rather than the mass effect of a tumor. Cerebral angiography is mandatory whenever computerized tomography (CT), performed to rule out recurrence of a basal tumor, shows an ischemic lesion with low-density areas without any evidence of mass effect of the tumor. Cerebral angiography is also necessary when a basal tumor is suspected in children, particularly in cases associated with neurocutaneous syndrome and a basal tumor. Care should be taken not to scarify the abnormal vascular network at the base of the brain at the time of operation, because it is considered to be functioning as collateral circulation. The potential hazards of radiotherapy to radiation-induced occlusive changes of the circle of Willis must be considered in treating a benign basal brain tumor in children. Even in adults, repeated large doses of irradiation could cause occlusive arteriopathy."
CD009372,0,10602974,0,Dynamic contrast-enhanced subtraction MR angiography in intracranial vascular abnormalities.,"We present our clinical experience with dynamic contrast-enhanced MR angiography (MRA) with subtraction for assessing intracranial vascular abnormalities. Ten patients with various cerebrovascular disorders underwent dynamic contrast-enhanced MRA on a 1.0-T system. Thirty sections (2 mm) were acquired in 29-30 s. Maximum intensity projection images and subtracted source images were compared with those obtained by conventional angiography. In all cases, the presence or absence of abnormalities in the targeted vessels, as well as the morphology of the sagittal sinuses, was clearly visualized as in conventional angiography, without any obstructions such as hyperintense hematomas or thrombi, or intraluminal turbulence. Although the temporal and spatial resolutions with current hardware are insufficient, these preliminary results suggest that dynamic contrast-enhanced MRA with subtraction may be useful for assessing vascular lesions with hemorrhage or thrombus, and the dural sinuses."

For this purpose, CT and angiographic data of 149 subjects with spontaneous intracerebral hematomas (ICH) were statistically compared in a blind, retrospective study, taking angiography, supported when possible by surgical findings, as providing the correct diagnoses. 5 groups were distinguished on the basis of CT data: 103 patients with isolated deep ICH had normal angiograms; 9 patients with isolated superficial ICH and 8 with deep ICH and intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) had arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). 4 with this combination showed no angiographic abnormalities, one had an aneurysm. 14 subjects with ICH and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) had a middle cerebral or carotid artery aneurysm; and 10 with ICH, SAH and IVH had also an aneurysm, in 7 on the anterior communicating artery. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values were respectively: for AVMs 100, 96, 77 and 100%; and for aneurysms 96, 100, 100 and 99%. Kendall coefficient was 0.95, indicating close correlation between the two modalities. This study confirms that CT can accurately predict the likelihood, nature and location of vascular ICHs. It indicates whether angiography is necessary or not, and if so, what vascular tree ought to be explored."

Shell fragments were the most frequent projectiles (73.7%), and penetrating wounds were the most frequent injuries (61%). During the study, 2 patients (1 with an ophthalmic and the other with an anterior cerebral artery aneurysm) presented with delayed traumatic intracerebral hematoma; the first patient had had negative angiography 90 days earlier, and the second patient was admitted from a rehabilitation center after operation in another center 25 days earlier for a penetrating left frontal shell fragment injury. Six of 223 patients (2.7%) had dormant aneurysms (4 middle and 2 anterior cerebral arteries). Seven of 8 patients were operated on again to exclude their aneurysms from the cerebral circulation. Two of 8 patients died postoperatively (1 within 24 hours and another 51 days after discharge from the hospital in a vegetative state). Fragments penetrating temporal, temporoparietal, or pterional areas had a significantly greater chance of causing arterial injury (chi 2 = 11.46, P less than 0.001). There was a significant chance of having an aneurysm if a hematoma was seen at operation or on computed tomography of the head (chi 2 = 4.18, P less than 0.05). The penetrating mode of injury and shell fragments crossing the midline were two variables for which the statistical significance had a P value of 0.08. It is concluded that war casualties with penetrating shell fragment injuries near the pterion, especially when harboring intracerebral hematomas, should undergo cerebral angiography to rule out vascular injuries of the brain."

The subjects of this study were 425 patients without a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack and without any abnormality on a neurological examination who consecutively visited a neurology clinic between January 1994 and June 2001 requesting medical evaluation for possible cerebrovascular diseases. Subjects included 245 men and 180 women ranging in age from 33 to 89 years (mean+/-SD=64.0+/-10.0 years). We performed cervical and intracranial magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) in all subjects. Using a validated rating scheme of MRA for occlusive lesions, we evaluated the degree of stenoses in the extracranial portion of the internal carotid artery (ICA) and the intracranial arteries including the intracranial portion of the ICA, middle cerebral artery (MCA) stem, intracranial portion of the vertebral artery (VA), and basilar artery (BA). More than 25% stenoses were regarded as significant lesions in this study. Multiple logistic regression analyses showed that significant and independent predictors for extracranial ICA lesions were age, hyperlipidemia, and ischemic heart disease (IHD), those for intracranial ICA lesions were age, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and IHD, those for MCA lesions were age and hypertension, those for intracranial VA lesions were hyperlipidemia and IHD, and those for BA lesions were hypertension and diabetes mellitus. The present study suggested that atherosclerosis of the intracranial VA was related to hyperlipidemia and IHD as was the case for the extracranial carotid artery, whilst atherosclerosis of other sites of intracranial arteries was associated with hypertension and diabetes mellitus in stroke-free Japanese."
CD009372,0,21571479,0,Semiautomated detection of cerebral microbleeds in magnetic resonance images.,"Cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) are increasingly being recognized as an important biomarker for neurovascular diseases. So far, all attempts to count and quantify them have relied on manual methods that are time-consuming and can be inconsistent. A technique is presented that semiautomatically identifies CMBs in susceptibility weighted images (SWI). This will both reduce the processing time and increase the consistency over manual methods. This technique relies on a statistical thresholding algorithm to identify hypointensities within the image. A support vector machine (SVM) supervised learning classifier is then used to separate true CMB from other marked hypointensities. The classifier relies on identifying features such as shape and signal intensity to identify true CMBs. The results from the automated section are then subject to manual review to remove false-positives. This technique is able to achieve a sensitivity of 81.7% compared with the gold standard of manual review and consensus by multiple reviewers. In subjects with many CMBs, this presents a faster alternative to current manual techniques at the cost of some lost sensitivity."

A 19-year-old woman in the 35th week of gestation by date was admitted due to a sudden onset of generalized clonic convulsion and disturbance of consciousness. The diagnosis was eclampsia. On the second hospital day, extraction of a stillborn female was performed by laminaria. Thereafter, the consciousness improved rapidly and she became alert on the following day. She was discharged without neurological deficit on the 18th hospital day. A CT scan on the day of admission showed narrow lateral ventricles and symmetrical low-density lesions in and around the basal ganglia. These had almost disappeared by the 10th hospital day. Carotid angiography on admission revealed no abnormality in the arterial phase including the lenticulostriate arteries, but, early appearance of deep cerebral veins and some cortical veins was noted. These deep veins, however, were not distinct even in the venous phase. These angiographic findings suggested medullary dilatation caused by circulatory disturbance of the deep cerebral veins. Most authors have stressed the contribution of diffuse arterial vasospasm in the pathogenesis of eclampsia in relation to low-density lesions on CT scans. In the present case, we could not find vasospasm but found circulatory disturbance of the deep cerebral veins. These angiographic findings suggested that the appearance of the low-density lesions on the CT scan was most likely due to venous congestion caused by circulatory disturbance of the deep cerebral veins, since most of the deep medullary veins in the low-density lesions flowed into the deep cerebral veins.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

An initial head CT showed a thin SAH in the interhemispheric cistern and cortical sulcus of the left frontal surface. Subsequent MRI performed 10 min after head CT scan revealed a fresh infarction in the left ACA region. MR-and digital subtraction angiograms demonstrated a dissection in the A2 portion of the left ACA with a leak of contrast media around the left A3 portion, suggesting that the bleeding occurred in a distal portion of the main dilation. Without anti-thrombotic therapy, the patient recovered without complications by blood pressure control and administration of brain-function protection therapies. We found 11 cases similar to the present case in the literature. All cases presented with lower-extremity dominant hemiparesis; however, sudden onset headache was rare. Blood pressure was not well-controlled in 4 out of the 6 known hypertensive cases. Main sites of dissection were located at the A2 portion in all cases except one A3 lesion, and extended to A3 in 2 cases. Conservative therapy led to favorable outcome in 8 cases, while 4 cases underwent surgical interventions for increasing risk of aneurysm rupture after initial observational therapies. Re-bleeding did not occur in any of the 12 cases reviewed. These data suggest that conservative treatment can be considered for an initial management of ACAD with simultaneous CI and SAH. More evidence needs to be accumulated to establish the optimal therapeutic approach for ACAD associated with CI and SAH."

Thin-section NCTs were performed before and immediately after IV rt-PA infusion in acute stroke patients. The thrombus volume and Hounsfield unit were measured using three-dimensional imaging software. Immediate recanalisation was assessed immediately after IV rt-PA infusion using CT angiography. During a three-year study period, 130 patients were prospectively enrolled. On baseline thin-section NCT, no thrombi were found in 30 patients (23%). Among the 100 patients with confirmed thrombus, the median volume decreased by 20% on the follow-up NCT. The thrombus was completely resolved in 8%. Of note, an increase in thrombus volume was observed in 20 patients. Independent predictors of thrombus resolution were total rt-PA dose, thrombus location in the M2 segment of the middle cerebral artery, and time from baseline to follow-up NCT. Thrombus resolution increased by 9% per each 10-mg increase in rt-PA (p = 0.045). Immediate complete recanalisation was achieved in 12% of patients. Total dose of rt-PA was independently associated with complete recanalisation [odds ratio [OR] 4.52, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.345-15.184) and good functional outcome at three months (modified Rankin scale score <3, OR 2.34, 95% CI 1.104-4.962).

CD009372,0,6621748,0,[Cardiac cerebral embolism].,"135 cases of cardiogenic emboli to the brain are reported in view of symptoms, diagnosis, prognosis and therapy. Brain embolism occurred most often in ischemic heart disease with atrial fibrillation, followed by valvular heart disease, myocardial infarction and carditis. Usually there was a sudden onset of neurological symptoms during the morning hours. Initial lapses of consciousness were a bad prognostic sign--they appeared as well as seizures more often in embolic than in thrombotic brain infarctions. The clearly higher incidence of emboli to the left cerebral hemisphere has anatomical reasons. Angiographic findings depend on the time of examination; common are occlusions of the supraclinoid portion of the internal carotid artery, media-occlusions at the trifurcation, media-branch-occlusions and disturbed middle cerebral blood flow. CT and lumbar puncture do not support the diagnosis. Cardiologic examination should include X-ray of the chest, long time electrocardiogram and echocardiography. In view of a mortality of 22 per cent and major neurological residual symptoms in 34 percent the prognosis of brain embolism is serious. Early anticoagulant therapy in the absence of brain hemorrhage in CT seems to improve the prognosis by preventing reembolization."

CD009372,0,20824304,0,A fast and fully automatic method for cerebrovascular segmentation on time-of-flight (TOF) MRA image.,"The precise three-dimensional (3-D) segmentation of cerebral vessels from magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) images is essential for the detection of cerebrovascular diseases (e.g., occlusion, aneurysm). The complex 3-D structure of cerebral vessels and the low contrast of thin vessels in MRA images make precise segmentation difficult. We present a fast, fully automatic segmentation algorithm based on statistical model analysis and improved curve evolution for extracting the 3-D cerebral vessels from a time-of-flight (TOF) MRA dataset. Cerebral vessels and other tissue (brain tissue, CSF, and bone) in TOF MRA dataset are modeled by Gaussian distribution and combination of Rayleigh with several Gaussian distributions separately. The region distribution combined with gradient information is used in edge-strength of curve evolution as one novel mode. This edge-strength function is able to determine the boundary of thin vessels with low contrast around brain tissue accurately and robustly. Moreover, a fast level set method is developed to implement the curve evolution to assure high efficiency of the cerebrovascular segmentation. Quantitative comparisons with 10 sets of manual segmentation results showed that the average volume sensitivity, the average branch sensitivity, and average mean absolute distance error are 93.6%, 95.98%, and 0.333 mm, respectively. By applying the algorithm to 200 clinical datasets from three hospitals, it is demonstrated that the proposed algorithm can provide good quality segmentation capable of extracting a vessel with a one-voxel diameter in less than 2 min. Its accuracy and speed make this novel algorithm more suitable for a clinical computer-aided diagnosis system."

Angiography demonstrated string-of-beads sign typical of fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) in the extracranial carotid and vertebral arteries. The aneurysm and the parent artery were successfully embolized with Guglielmi detachable coils. Severe vasospasm developed 1 week after admission, and was treated several times by selective injection of vasodilator. A new aneurysm of the left external carotid artery became evident 1 month later, whereas only slight dilation had previously been apparent. This angiographic sequence demonstrated a new arterial dissection. Despite the possibility of damage to the artery during multiple catheterizations, arterial wall changes caused by FMD appear to have been primarily responsible. This case emphasizes the need for particular care in performing vascular interventional procedures in the presence of FMD."

We explore the controversial issue of anticoagulation therapy and indication for decompressive craniectomy in association with severe sinus thrombosis. The 62-year-old female patient was admitted to hospital, because of first generalized seizure. A computed tomographic (CT) scan of the brain revealed a left occipital hemorrhage. Digital subtraction angiogram showing thrombosis of the left transverse and sigmoid sinus. An intravenously administered regimen of heparin was begun, because of a protein S deficiency. On the 6th day the patients level of consciousness deteriorated, necessitating intubation, hyperventilation, and mannitol. Repeat CT scan revealed increasing edema with midline shift and obliteration of the basal cisterns, although the hemorrhagic lesion was unchanged. The patient developed signs of diencephalic dysfunction. A large left temporoparietooccipital craniectomy was performed and the dura was opened. The multiloculated intraparenchymatous hemorrhage portion of the brain was not removed. In addition, the patient was treated postoperatively with heparin therapy for three months, than a regimen of phenprocoumon was begun. Twelve months later the hemianopsia had not improved and she had an incomplete Wernicke's dysphasia.

CD009372,0,19119890,0,Intracranial subarachnoid hemorrhage resulting from cervical spine dural arteriovenous fistulas: literature review and case presentation.,"Cervical dural arteriovenous fistulas (dAVFs) are a rare cause of intracranial subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) but should be considered when other sources are not found. Subarachnoid hemorrhage caused by dAVF is thought to occur as a result of venous hypertension in most cases. The clinical presentation, acute onset of severe headache, is similar to that in patients with other causes of SAH; however, severe neurological deficits (Hunt and Hess Grade IV and V SAH) have not been reported in SAH caused by cervical dAVFs. Patients with this type of SAH commonly report suboccipital headache, neck pain, and nausea, and thus these hemorrhages can be easily dismissed as perimesencephalic SAH. Vigilant evaluation with 4-vessel cerebral angiography, including selective catheterization of both proximal vertebral arteries, should be performed. The practice of unilateral vertebral artery injection with reflux into the contralateral vertebral and posterior inferior cerebellar arteries has the potential to overlook cervical dAVF. Magnetic resonance imaging may be useful to evaluate for other causes of SAH but is probably not sensitive for the identification of a cervical dAVF. Surgical treatment of this lesion has an excellent outcome."

In the patient with myelopathy, angiographic exploration began with a spinal angiogram. Bilateral vertebral angiography initially failed to demonstrate the fistula, and a tentorial DAVF was established with carotid artery angiography.

The introduction of newer fibrinolytics along with the development of interventional catheterization techniques have extended its use to previously untreated events such as cerebrovascular occlusions. Between 1989-1991 six patients with basilar and/or middle cerebral artery thrombosis were treated at the University Hospital, Basel, by superselective local intraarterial infusion of 400,000 U/h urokinase for 1-2 hours. Two of four patients with basilar artery occlusion showed complete remission one year after the intervention. The third showed no neurological improvement despite angiographic recanalization, and 48 h later suffered a fatal brainstem haemorrhage, while the fourth did not recover from coma and succumbed. Both patients with occlusion of the middle cerebral artery showed complete recanalization, but one had complete and the other partial neurological remission. Signs of slight systemic fibrinolysis were present but never attained the intensity of systemic therapeutic fibrinolysis as the antiplasmin and fibrinogen values showed. In summary, local therapeutic fibrinolysis contributes to the reduction of mortality and to remission of symptoms in occlusions of basilar artery, and offers some advantage in occlusions of the middle cerebral artery. A definite benefit from the latter will be proved only through large-scale randomized trials. The indication for local therapeutic fibrinolysis for thromboses of cerebral arteries requires a careful benefit-risk evaluation, an experienced angiography team and a special infrastructure for computed tomography and digital subtraction angiography."

A father had vascular nevi and a mother, his sister, had an azygos anterior cerebral artery. No other cutaneous or cerebrovascular malformations were present in the parents. Each of the two families had two boys and one girl, 9 to 18 years of age. All the children had vascular nevi and all of the boys had coexisting cerebrovascular malformations: AVMs in three, and a venous malformation in another. One boy had three cerebral AVMs. Two boys had a cerebral hemorrhage, and one also had focal motor seizures. The skin lesions were not those of the Sturge-Weber-Dimitri, Rendu-Osler-Weber, or Wybum-Mason syndromes. The association of cutaneous and cerebrovascular malformations was seen only in males in these families. but females have also been reported in the literature. The results obtained in these families and three other families reported from Western and Central Europe indicate that the association of cerebral and cutaneous vascular hamartomas constitutes a distinct, hereditary clinicopathological entity with autosomal dominant inheritance and variable penetrance. The clinical manifestations of this syndrome are visible, painful vascular nevi, epilepsy, cerebral hemorrhage, and focal neurological deficits. The preponderance of male patients with the full expression of the syndrome suggests a possible hormonal influence on the expression of the gene."
CD009372,0,8061440,0,Efficacy evaluation of gadoteridol for MR angiography of intracranial vascular lesions.,"A phase III multicenter study was conducted in 89 patients with known intracranial vascular lesions to evaluate an extracellular gadolinium contrast agent, gadoteridol, for intracranial magnetic resonance (MR) angiography. The pre- and postcontrast MR angiograms of 82 patients were evaluated by the unblinded investigators and by two blinded readers (A and B) for visualization of lesions; arterial and venous anatomy; extent, size, and number of lesions; and disease classification. The unblinded readers indicated that lesions were visualized better on postcontrast images in the following categories: venous anatomy, 87 (81%) of 107 lesions; arterial anatomy, 43 lesions (40%); and extent or size of lesions, 38 lesions (36%). In 29 (35%) of 82 patients, the unblinded readers determined that enhanced MR angiography provided more diagnostic information than unenhanced MR angiography. The blinded readers determined that enhanced MR angiography provided more information for visualization of vascular anatomy in more than 60% of cases. The additional information provided with gadoteridol would have changed the diagnosis in nine (8%) of 107 lesions seen by the unblinded readers, 11 (12%) of 90 lesions seen by reader A, and three (3%) of 93 lesions seen by reader B. The results confirm that the use of gadoteridol improves the visualization of intracranial vascular lesions with MR angiography. The authors conclude that development of new postprocessing algorithms will improve the utility of contrast-enhanced MR angiography."

In seven patients, nine out of ten cavernomas were removed by microsurgery. While MR-angiography demonstrated well branches of brain arteries adjacent to the lesions, no flow signal in the vascular malformations was observed. On the other hand, there was a high intensity signal induced by methaemoglobin in those three patients with brainstem cavernomas who had experienced a significant bleeding attack seven months prior to admission. It had a spotted appearance in MR-angiography with volumes of the largest spots around 1.8 cm3.

A 47-year-old male initially presented with a headache and became comatose 3 weeks later. CT and MR imaging demonstrated a massive hematoma in the right caudate head projecting into the lateral ventricle. A 60-year-old male sustained heaviness of his left extremities 8 days prior to admission and his condition gradually deteriorated. Neuroimaging revealed a right thalamic hematoma adjacent to the lateral ventricle. Cerebral angiography, CT, and MR imaging failed to detect any vascular anomaly. The hematomas increased in size gradually and were surgically explored. The histological diagnosis was arteriovenous malformation for the first case and cavernous angioma for the second case that had ruptured repeatedly. These cases were unique in the unusual location in the subependyma, and diagnostic neuroimaging modalities could not disclose the vascular anomalies, and the hematomas enlarged progressively to become critically symptomatic. Surgical intervention is mandatory for mass reduction and correct diagnosis of such lesions, with favorable outcome as long as the surgery is not delayed until too late."

CD009372,0,12869717,0,Trial design and reporting standards for intra-arterial cerebral thrombolysis for acute ischemic stroke.,"The National Institutes of Health (NIH) estimates that stroke costs now exceed 45 billion dollars per year. Stroke is the third leading cause of death and one of the leading causes of adult disability in North America, Europe, and Asia. A number of well-designed randomized stroke trials and case series have now been reported in the literature to evaluate the safety and efficacy of thrombolytic therapy for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke. These stroke trials have included intravenous studies, intra-arterial studies, and combinations of both, as well as use of mechanical devices for removal of thromboemboli and of neuroprotectant drugs, alone or in combination with thrombolytic therapy. At this time, the only therapy demonstrated to improve outcomes from an acute stroke is thrombolysis of the clot responsible for the ischemic event. There is room for improvement in stroke lysis studies. Divergent criteria, with disparate reporting standards and definitions, have made direct comparisons between stroke trials difficult to compare and contrast in terms of overall patient outcomes and efficacy of treatment. There is a need for more uniform definitions of multiple variables such as collateral flow, degree of recanalization, assessment of perfusion, and infarct size. In addition, there are multiple unanswered questions that require further investigation, in particular, questions as to which patients are best treated with thrombolysis. One of the most important predictors of clinical success is time to treatment, with early treatment of <3 hours for intravenous tissue plasminogen activator and <6 hours for intra-arterial thrombolysis demonstrating significant improvement in terms of 90-day clinical outcome and reduced cerebral hemorrhage. It is possible that improved imaging that identifies the ischemic penumbra and distinguishes it from irreversibly infarcted tissue will more accurately select patients for therapy than duration of symptoms. There are additional problems in the assessment of patients eligible for thrombolysis. These include being able to predict whether a particular site of occlusion can be successfully revascularized, predict an individual patient's prognosis and outcome after revascularization, and in particular, to predict the development of intracerebral hemorrhage, with and without clinical deterioration. It is not clear to assume that achieving immediate flow restoration due to thrombolytic therapy implies clinical success and improved outcome. There is no simple correlation between recanalization and observed clinical benefit in all ischemic stroke patients, because other interactive variables, such as collateral circulation, the ischemic penumbra, lesion location and extent, time to treatment, and hemorrhagic conversion, are all interrelated to outcome."
CD009372,0,11424358,0,[Usefulness of time-resolved projection MRA on evaluation of hemodynamics in cerebral occlusive diseases].,"The usefulness for evaluation of cerebral hemodynamics using time-resolved projection MRA was studied in normal volunteers and patients of cerebrovascular diseases. Six normal volunteers and ten patients with cerebrovascular occlusive diseases including 6 of IC occlusion and 4 of post EC/IC bypass surgery underwent time-resolved projection MRA on a 1.5 T clinical MRI system. Projection angiograms are acquired with 2 D-fast SPGR sequence with a time resolution of approximately one image per second, 40 images being acquired consecutively before and after bolus injection Gd-DTPA. And all images were calculated by complex subtraction from the background mask in a work station. In normal volunteers, the quality of images of time-resolved projection MRA was satisfactory. The arteries from internal carotid artery through M 2 segment of middle cerebral artery and all major venous systems were well portrayed. In 4 cases of IC occlusion who were assessed the collateral flow through the anterior communicating artery and posterior communicating artery, there were delayed to demonstrate the ipsilateral MCA. However, in 2 cases of IC occlusion that were assessed the collateral flow through leptomeningeal anastomosis, ipsilateral MCA and collateral circulation were not demonstrated. In all patients of post EC/IC bypass surgery, the patency of EC/IC bypass could be evaluated as properly with time-resolved projection MRA as 3 D-TOF MRA. Although the temporal and spatial resolutions are insufficient, time-resolved projection MRA was powerful non-invasive method to evaluate the cerebral hemodynamics via the basal communicating arteries in IC occlusion and identify the patency of EC/IC bypass."
CD009372,0,8752465,0,[MRA].,"With the recent development of MR techniques, it has become possible to obtain angiographic images (MRA) of relatively good quality with use of MR. The major indications of MRA have been to elucidate the MR findings on spin echo images when vascular lesions are suspected and to use MRA for conventional angiography when the latter is contra-indicated or additional information is needed. Follow-up studies of vascular diseases can be easily performed with MRA. The sensitivity of this technique for cerebral aneurysms is 73.6%, whereas specificity is 76.2%. The sensitivity and specificity for cerebrovascular diseases are 88.7% and 97.4% for stenoses of more than 50.0%. Because of rather limited diagnostic accuracy, this technique cannot be applied freely for screening of cerebral diseases, especially in mass survey for unruptured cerebral aneurysms. There have been many new techniques proposed for improvement of spatial resolution of MRA, including magnitisation transfer contrast (MTC), tilted optimized non-satulation excitation (TONE) and high resolution images. With full development of these new techniques, MRA will be used more freely in the diagnosis of vascular diseases."
CD009372,0,6392918,0,[Digital subtraction angiography of the cerebral vessels by intraarterial injection].,"Three hundred and fifty-seven digital subtraction angiography (DSA) were performed in 184 neurosurgical patients by intraarterial injection. Examinations consisted of 192 carotid angiography, 110 vertebral angiography, 23 aortography, 11 spinal angiography and 21 other angiography. In all examinations, visualization of the vessels was excellent and the complications were never experienced. High contrast sensitivity of DSA resulted in better visualization of tumor stains, phlebogram, and arteries in cerebral arteriovenous malformations with large shunt blood flow than conventional angiography. Selective catheterization into each cerebral arteries was not necessarily demanded for good opacification of the vessels because of high sensitivity. High contrast sensitivity also permitted low concentration of contrast material, small dose of contrast material, and slow injection rate. Low concentration of contrast material reduced pain and heat during injection especially in the external carotid and vertebral angiography. Using slow injection, recoiling of catheter into the aorta was reduced, so that injection from the innominate and subclavian arteries for visualization of origin of the cerebral arteries were always successful. Full study of cerebral arteries by Seldinger's method, if necessary, was easily achieved using DSA even in patient with high age or with severe atherosclerosis. Bolus injection of small dose of contrast material as well as serial imaging was helpful in evaluating hemodynamics in the lesion. Real time display of DSA reduced the time required for angiography and was very convenient for artificial embolization. Besides these advantages, DSA became comparable to conventional angiography in special resolution by use of intraarterial injection and could be a preoperative genuine examination as well as a screening method."

CD009372,0,20885090,0,Improved visualization of intracranial vessels by gradient moment nulling in hybrid of opposite-contrast magnetic resonance angiography (HOP MRA).,"Hybrid of opposite-contrast (HOP) magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) is a new method that combines the advantages of 3-dimensional (3D) time-of-flight (TOF) MRA and black-blood (BB) MRA without prolonging acquisition time. In phantom and clinical studies, we focused on image differences when we applied gradient moment nulling (GMN) to 2 or 3 axes in the first echo. We made an original phantom with a semicircular tube of 3- and 5-mm internal diameter, with flow rate in the tube of 0, 20, 60, 80, or 120 cm/s. In original images of the phantom obtained with TOF MRA and flow-sensitive BB MRA and in filter frequency-weighted subtraction (FWS) processed images acquired with HOP MRA, we measured the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) of both the inside and outside of the tubes. In FWS processed images with GMN applied to 2 axes, the CNR was high at various flow rates in both straight and bending portions of the tubes in comparison with TOF images. In a clinical study in 15 patients, we evaluated vessel visualization in images obtained using conventional TOF MRA with magnetization transfer contrast (MTC) and HOP MRA. In clinical studies, visualization scores of HOP MRA were equivalent to those of conventional TOF MRA in the bilateral internal carotid arteries (ICA) and inferior in the basilar arteries. However, visualization of the peripheral portion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) improved significantly in HOP MRA with GMN applied to 2 and 3 axes. Visualization of the main trunk of the ICA and MCA was superior in HOP MRA with GMN applied to 2 axes. HOP MRA with 2-axis GMN may be useful for excellent visualization of both major arteries and peripheral vessels in the head."
CD009372,0,22118795,1,Vascular imaging adds value in investigation of basal ganglia hemorrhage.,"The risk of basal ganglia hemorrhage (BGH) increases in patients of older age and with hypertension. Current guidelines do not recommend routine vascular imaging. However, a proportion of patients with BGH have underlying vascular abnormalities, and these patients may require a different treatment approach. We aimed to assess the proportion of underlying vascular abnormalities in patients with BGH. In this retrospective study, we included all patients who presented with BGH between January 2007 and December 2009 at a single institution. The following data were collected: patient demographics, vascular risk factors, medications, volume of hematoma, CT scans, CT angiogram, magnetic resonance angiography and digital subtraction angiography. We determined the proportion of underlying vascular abnormalities and correlated these findings with risk factors for BGH. A total of 113 consecutive patients with BGH were identified, and vascular imaging was performed in 61. The median age was 62 years and 48 (78.7%) of these patients were male. Forty-two (68.9%) of 61 patients had hypertension. Positive vascular imaging findings were identified in eight of 61 patients (13.1%): three intracranial aneurysms, three cavernous malformations, one Moyamoya disease and one arteriovenous malformation. There were no significant associations between demographic features, vascular risk factors and the hematoma volume between patients with positive and negative vascular imaging. Specifically, an underlying vascular abnormality was not associated with age (≥ 60 years, 6/36 patients had an underlying vascular abnormality, compared with 2/25 patients< 60 years; p=not significant [n.s.]). There was no relationship with hypertension (5/42 hypertensive patients and 3/19 normotensive patients (n.s.) had an underlying vascular abnormality). We concluded that there is a significant proportion of relevant underlying vascular abnormalities in patients with BGH. This likelihood is not predicted by risk factors such as hypertension and age. These findings indicate the importance of vascular imaging in patients with BGH who are not neurologically devastated."

A 49-year-old male was transferred to this hospital with a head injury as a result of a car accident, and a CT scan revealed a traumatic intracerebral hemorrhage. The patient displayed the characteristic clinical features of Werner's syndrome, including premature senility, juvenile cataract, atrophic skin, and a tendency to ward familial occurrence was present. MRI and cerebral angiography revealed multiple intracerebral hemorrhages, perhaps due to amyloid angiopathy, multiple lacunar infarctions and parasagittal meningioma. This is the first report on the MRI findings in the brain of a patient with Werner's syndrome. We suspect that of Werner's syndrome also shows evidence of premature aging on MR images."
CD009372,0,8609558,0,"Color transcranial ""power"" Doppler ultrasound of intracranial aneurysms.","""Color Doppler energy"" (or ""power Doppler""), a new color Doppler ultrasound technique that is independent of flow direction and very sensitive to movement, was assessed for its use in the identification of intracranial aneurysms in patients with recent subarachnoid hemorrhage immediately prior to using cerebral angiography. Features that identified aneurysms using this technique included the appearance of abnormal color where no normal artery was expected, abnormal bulging of an artery, and greater ""expansibility"" of the aneurysm in comparison to an adjacent normal vessel. In this exploratory study, 30 of 33 aneurysms were correctly identified in 35 patients with a good bone window. Color Doppler energy is considerably more sensitive to intracranial blood flow than conventional color Doppler imaging. Color Doppler energy is a useful research tool; if these preliminary results are verified in larger series, in addition to examination for vasospasm, the technique could be used for identification and follow up of aneurysms."

She lost consciousness and was admitted. Computed tomography demonstrated a subdural hematoma over the left cerebral convexity and a mass in the frontal lobe. Cerebral angiography disclosed a giant aneurysm located on the distal segment of the right pericallosal artery. The subdural hematoma was removed and the aneurysmal neck was clipped, but she died 15 days after the operation. Autopsy found the giant aneurysm (33 x 30 x 27 mm) on the distal segment of the right pericallosal artery. Highly atheromatous changes were recognized in part of the aneurysmal wall, the arteries near the circle of Willis, and the distal anterior cerebral artery (ACA) adjacent to the aneurysm. There were no anomalous vessels such as azygos ACA. Giant aneurysms situated beyond the genu of the corpus callosum are extremely rare.

CD009372,0,16044654,0,Imaging in acute brain infarction.,"Imaging in a patient suspected of having suffered an acute stroke is used primarily to clear the patient for thrombolytic therapy, by excluding intracranial hemorrhage and nonstroke causes of the patient's symptoms, within a critical 3-hour window. Noncontrast CT of the brain is the imaging test of choice for the initial evaluation of a patient with suspected acute ischemic stroke. It is rapid and readily available and has a high sensitivity for intracranial hemorrhage. Contrast-enhanced CT angiography and perfusion imaging may provide additional information with only a minimal increase in scanning time. Finally, diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance sequences have a high sensitivity for acute stroke and, with magnetic resonance perfusion imaging, may play an increasing role in the future treatment of stroke."
CD009372,0,12621685,0,[Diagnosis of stroke--an update].,"In practical day-to-day terms, most patients have one of the common causes of stroke: ischemic stroke caused by the complications of atherothrombosis, intracranial small Vessel disease, embolism from the heart, primary intracerebral hemorrhage caused by hypertension, or subarachnoid hemorrhage as a result of a ruptured saccular aneurysm. There are three issues to be considered in assessing the reliability of the clinical diagnosis of stroke: the diagnosis of stroke itself: is it a stroke or not; whether the stroke is caused by an infarct or a hemorrhage and particular in ischemic stroke the site and size of the lesion (anterior vs. posterior circulation, lacunar vs. cortical, etc.) No clinical scoring method can differentiate with absolute reliability ischemic stroke from primary intracerebral hemorrhage. To do this brain computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging is required. For vascular diagnosis ultrasound and magnetic resonance angiography are ideal and complementary non-invasive techniques. Both have no risks and are reasonably sensitive. Catheterangiography is only reserved for patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage with a view to surgical or endovascular treatment or in exceptional cases to establish a more firm prognosis. The diagnosis of ischemic stroke caused by embolism from the heart can only be considered at all if there is an identifiable cardioembolic source which is the case in about 30% of ischemic stroke, a higher proportion in recent studies using transoesophageal echocardiography. It is not clear that transoesophageal echocardiography provides much more information for clinical decision-making than transthoracic echocardiography, although it certainly provides more anatomical information in selected patients. This article summarises the diagnostic armamentarium which is used for the diagnosis of stroke and gives an overview of clinically reliable and relevant measures."

Emergent magnetic resonance image was useful not only for diagnosis by fluid attenuated inversion recovery image but also for evaluation of cerebral ischemia and vasospasm by magnetic resonance angiography, diffusion weighted image and perfusion weighted image. A 50-year-old man presented disturbance of consciousness and dysarthria. Neither computed tomographic scan nor cerebrospinal fluid study could diagnose subarachnoid hemorrhage clearly. However, emergent fluid attenuated inversion recovery image showed the show subarachnoid hemorrhage as high signal intensity. Diffusion weighted image showed multiple, round hypersignals both in the white and gray matter. In the area with diffusion hypersignal, the apparent diffusion coefficient value was 0.57 x 10(3) mm2/sec. Perfusion weighted image showed normal cerebral blood volume but prolonged mean transit time in the territory of the right middle cerebral artery. Magnetic resonance angiography revealed an aneurysm at the anterior communicating artery and severe vasospasm on the bilateral anterior cerebral artery, the right middle cerebral artery. Thus we are able to diagnose subarachnoid hemorrhage due to a ruptured anterior communicating artery aneurysm. The hyperintensity of the diffusion weighted image and the fluid attenuated inversion recovery image was caused by cerebral ischemia from vasospasm. After conservative therapy during the period of vasospasm, successful surgical clipping was performed with full clinical recovery."

They can reliably distinguish between bleeding and stroke, especially taking newest technologies, such as perfusion studies and angiographies, into account. Neuroradiology with its interventional options has nowadays furthermore become an important tool in strokes and offers a local maneuver to retrieve the clotting pathology and even opens the therapeutic window for a delayed start of the therapy since symptom's onset beyong the conventional 4.5 hours window.

All three girls had left middle cerebral artery infarcts on MR imaging, with an abnormal left middle cerebral artery detected by MR angiography, conventional angiography, and transcranial Doppler sonography in each child. In all three cases, findings of the transcranial Doppler sonography, MR imaging, and catheter angiography were concordant."
CD009372,0,9148875,0,Three-dimensional magnetic resonance angiography in the planning of aneurysm surgery.,"Standard planning for intracranial aneurysm surgery relies on the surgeon's intellectual reconstruction of the three-dimensional (3D) surgical field on the basis of a two-dimensional (2D) imaging modality, biplanar cerebral angiography. This method is relatively imprecise, and it relies on previous experience for optimal results. We describe a stereotactic magnetic resonance angiographic (MRA)-guided method based on computer segmentation techniques for the planning of aneurysm surgery that has the potential of bringing a 3D perspective to the lesion. The method has been evaluated retrospectively on 20 surgical patients in whom the aneurysm orientation and relationship to parent vessels were shown to match presurgical 3D stereotactic display. When it is adapted to frameless interactive surgical navigation, this method may become a useful adjunct in the surgical obliteration of these life-threatening lesions."

CD009372,0,11474808,0,Pericapillary arteriovenous malformations angiographically manifested as cerebral venous malformations.,"Cerebral venous malformations have been diagnosed by angiographic features and are considered to be a benign anomaly. However, ample evidence indicates that stroke or similar symptomatology occurs in patients harboring a cerebral vascular malformation that was diagnosed angiographically as a venous malformation. The purpose of the study is to confirm the presence of a pericapillary arteriovenous malformation in these patients by analyzing the clinical history and surgical findings and correlating them with histological features. Thirteen patients were included in this study. Each patient fulfilled four criteria: 1. the patient was neurologically symptomatic; 2. the angiographic diagnosis was a venous malformation; 3. at operation, shunting arterioles (50-100 microns) were found to contribute to the malformation; and 4. histologically, a mixture of venous channels and arterioles with arterioles directly connected to venules was found. Based on the above findings, the malformation present in the 13 patients can be termed a 'pericapillary arteriovenous malformation'. Its angiographic distinction from the cerebral venous malformation requires technological advancement in the capability of magnifying images of arterioles and venules, along with improvement in image resolution."

CD009372,0,11677889,0,Continuous arterial spin labeling perfusion magnetic resonance imaging findings in postpartum vasculopathy.,"Postpartum vasculopathy (PPV) is a rare heterogeneous nonatherosclerotic vasculopathy that occurs in the puerperium. It occurs spontaneously but may be triggered by vasoconstrictor substances. The angiographic findings vary and include narrowing of the intracranial arteries and vasospasm. The angiographic findings and the occurrence of ischemic infarcts suggest that cerebral blood flow (CBF) is impaired in PPV. The purpose of this study is to determine CBF in patients with PPV. The authors conducted a case study of 3 patients with clinical and laboratory criteria for PPV examined during a 2-year period. Clinical examination, computed tomography imaging, structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), cerebral angiography, and continuous arterial spin labeling perfusion (CASL-PI) MRI were performed in all patients. Mean global CBF was determined, and perfusion maps were visually inspected. The CBF values and perfusion maps were correlated with the clinical symptoms and the neuroimaging findings. Three women were studied (22, 34, and 36 years old). The median time of presentation was 4 days postpartum. One presented with intracranial hemorrhage and diffuse arterial narrowing, the other 2 with stroke-like lesions, encephalopathy, and segmental narrowing mainly in the posterior circulation. CASL-PI was performed within 1 week of symptom onset in all 3 patients. Global mean CBF values were 51.8, 39.3, and 41.8 cc/100 g/min. Although global CBF was mildly diminished, it was above ischemic levels. Visual inspection of the CASL-PI perfusion maps did not reveal areas of focal hypoperfusion or hyperperfusion. In this series of patients with PPV, CBF was close to normal. Although angiography often reveals diffuse arterial narrowing, the CBF values encountered in this study do not support a state of generalized or focal oligoemia. Vasomotor tone may change intermittently in patients with PPV."

Despite many improvements in MR technology, CT is still the method of choice for most of these patients. Contrary to a long existing opinion, CT is a good diagnostic instrument even in the early phase of acute ischemic stroke. In combination with the new helical CT technique [CT angiography] all important questions regarding early therapeutic decisions can be answered. New MR perfusion techniques are just on the way to clinical application. Invasive angiography is only rarely indicated in acute ischemic stroke. The diagnosis of intracerebral hemorrhage is also mainly CT-based. MR and DSA are mandatory for further evaluation of the etiology of the hemorrhage. Nowadays, DSA is not longer mandatory for the diagnosis of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. In some patients CT is already diagnostic; the combination of different MR and MRA techniques nearly always allows a definite diagnosis or exclusion of a venous thrombosis."

CD009372,0,6362094,0,The pathogenesis of strokes from internal carotid artery occlusion. Diagnostic and therapeutical implications.,"In order to relate clinical, angiologic and brain-morphological findings, 107 patients with internal carotid artery occlusion were examined clinically and by Doppler sonography, computerized tomography and cerebral angiography. During computerized tomography, haemodynamically induced infarctions could be differentiated from those, caused by periocclusive embolism towards the major brain arteries. This differentiation was based on an integration of angiological as well as brain-morphological data and implicates some important diagnostic, therapeutic and prognostic consequences. The first group may benefit from immediate surgical restoration of carotid blood flow and have a relatively good prognosis. By contrast, subjects presenting territorial infarctions mostly experience severe and permanent neurological deficits. They should not undergo revascularization since endarterectomy increases the risk of cerebral hemorrhage but cannot cause clinical improvement. In five patients, following special angiographic techniques, the lesions of the internal carotid artery turned out to be pseudoocclusions. This condition threatens the patient considerably but is well accessible to surgical reconstruction. Thus, pseudooclusion seems to be one of the most convincing indication for emergency endarterectomy of the internal carotid artery."

Computed tomography on admission revealed thin SAH in the left parietooccipital sulcus. Cerebral angiography demonstrated a small saccular aneurysm on the cortical branch of the left PCA. The aneurysm was successfully clipped via the occipital interhemispheric approach. Distal PCA aneurysms frequently affect middle-aged persons and tend to be small, with good clinical course but may cause visual field defects. Direct aneurysm clipping is recommended for patients without visual defect from the onset. Parent artery occlusion by the endovascular technique should be considered for patients with visual loss caused by the initial hemorrhage."

Sixty-five of those aneurysms were carotid ophthalmic, 12 were located in the internal carotid-posterior communicating-anterior choroidal artery regions and 16 involved the internal carotid artery bifurcation. For the majority, clinical presentation was related to the mass of the aneurysms and compression of surrounding structures such as visual pathways, ocular motor cranial nerves, the fifth nerve, and hypothalamic-pituitary axis. Fourteen patients presented with subarachnoid hemorrhage. Cerebral angiography, computed tomography and xenon inhalation studies of cerebral blood flow were the tools used to study the morphology of the aneurysm and dynamics of the circle of Willis."

Intracranial hemorrhage associated with CdAVS is rare. We describe a patient with CdAVS presenting with subarachnoid hemorrhage and acute subdural hematoma. A 65-year-old woman presented headache and temporary loss of consciousness and was transferred to our hospital. On admission, the patient was alert and complained of a left-sided temporal headache. There were no ocular symptoms. A CT scan revealed subarachnoid hemorrhage and left acute subdural hematoma. When we prepared for cerebral angiography, the patient presented loss of consciousness following sudden onset of severe headache. Urgent angiography revealed left CdAVS, which was fed by both the internal carotid artery and the external carotid artery and drained only into ipsilateral (left) vein of the sylvian fissure. Aneurysmal dilatation of the draining veins and leptomeningeal drainage were present. No cerebral aneurysms were detected. After the angiography, a CT scan showed enlarged subdural hematoma, so left fronto-temporo-parietal craniotomy was immediately performed. On opening the dura mater, arterial bleeding from Sylvian fissure appeared and was uncontrollable. Unfortunately, the patient died 3 days after the operation. We concluded that subarachnoid hemorrhage and subdural hematoma were due to the rupture of engorged cortical veins. Our case report suggests that CdAVS with angiographic findings such as aneurysmal dilatation of the draining veins and leptomeningeal drainage should be treated urgently because of the high risk of the life-threatening complications resulting from a surgically uncontrollable hemorrhage."

Case report.,"A 69-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital because of fluctuating dysarthria during the past 2 months. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed old cerebral infarction of the left cerebral hemisphere with acute subarachnoid hemorrhage in the left sylvian fissure. Cerebral angiography showed a large saccular aneurysm, 14 mm in diameter, at the bifurcation of the left middle cerebral artery (MCA) in association with moyamoya vasculopathy with atherosclerosis, including steno-occlusive changes at the bilateral terminal internal carotid arteries and abnormal net-like vessels at the base of the brain. She underwent microsurgical neck clipping of the large aneurysm followed by superficial temporal artery-MCA anastomosis without complication. Intraoperative findings showed no evidence of aneurysm rupture, suggesting that the subarachnoid hemorrhage was due to the intrinsic pathology of moyamoya vasculopathy. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient was discharged without neurological deficit. Association of moyamoya syndrome with large MCA aneurysm is extremely rare, and formation of large aneurysm at the vascular territory of an occluded vessel is apparently unique."

CD009372,0,10072055,0,Stroke-like episodes in autosomal recessive cytochrome oxidase deficiency.,"Stroke-like episodes, defined as periods of acute localized neurological dysfunction during which brain imagery suggests cerebral ischemia but vascular anatomy is normal, occurred in 3 patients with autosomal recessive Saguenay-Lac St-Jean (SLSJ) cytochrome oxidase (COX) deficiency. The patients developed focal neurological deterioration and frontal hypodensities on cerebral computerized tomography (CT). Arteriography, performed in 1 patient during an acute episode, showed normal vascular anatomy. Nevertheless, capillary shunting was evident both in regions that appeared abnormal on the initial cerebral CT study and in regions that appeared normal but subsequently developed Leigh disease. Stroke-like episodes did not exacerbate systemic acidosis, and acidotic decompensations occurred independently of stroke-like episodes. In conclusion, stroke-like episodes occur in autosomal recessively inherited congenital lactic acidoses as well as in those caused by mitochondrial DNA mutations. In some cases, acute localized neurovascular changes occur in regions that subsequently develop Leigh disease."

They are related to a degenerative disease of the small vessels that may be of ischemic (leukoaraiosis, lacunae and infarct) or hemorrhagic (microbleeds and hematomas) origin. These lesions are part of the aging process, and compounded by vascular risk factors. They increase the occurrence frequency and severity of ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke.

CD009372,0,9567070,0,[Intracranial aneurysms in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease detected by MR angiography: screening and treatment].,"The association of intracranial aneurysm with ADPKD is well-known, and patients with ADPKD are at increased risk of subarachnoid hemorrhage from rupture of intracranial aneurysms. We prospectively performed three-dimensional time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) in 30 nonselective adult patients with ADPKD. Sixteen were women and 14 were men with a mean age of 51 yr (range 24 to 79 yr). The diagnosis of ADPKD was made on the basis of abdominal ultrasound or computed tomographic studies. Three patients were on maintenance hemodialysis, 8 patients were nondialysed patients with chronic renal failure (serum creatinine > or = mg/dl) and 25 patients had hypertension (BP > or = 140/90 mmHg). None of these patients have a previous diagnosis of intracranial aneurysm. Unruptured intracranial aneurysms were suspected in 5 patients by MRA, and 8 aneurysms were confirmed in 4 (13.3%) of 30 patients by conventional arteriography. These aneurysms were 3 approximately 10 mm in diameter and 3 aneurysms (3 approximately 4 mm in diameter) were newly detected by cerebral arteriography. After informed consent was obtained, neck clipping of the intracranial aneurysms were performed successfully in all the patients. These results suggest that the prevalence of intracranial aneurysms is about 13% in ADPKD, and that MRA is useful in screening for occult intracranial aneurysms in patients with ADPKD."
CD009372,0,1616402,0,[CT vs MRI in the diagnosis of acute stroke].,"70 patients who had suffered an acute stroke (52 ischaemic and 18 haemorrhagic) were studied with CT and MR, performing both techniques during the first week of disease and correlating the findings with the clinical data. MR proved superior in the detection of ischaemic infarcts, specially those in the posterior territory and with a small size; it was also superior to CT in the detection of leukoaraiosis and the demonstration of vascular obstructions. CT failed to detect a small brain stem haemorrhage secondary to bleeding of a cavernoma, while its performance was similar to that of MR in the remaining cases. In all patients with intracerebral haemorrhages, including two who were examined on the first day, an area of increased density was evidenced in the T1 sequences. It is concluded that CT, due to its greater availability and easiness of performance, must be maintained as first choice in acute stroke in order to differentiate haemorrhage from ischaemia, while MR may provide additional information in selected cases."
CD009372,0,18155383,0,Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage: update for emergency physicians.,"Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a serious cause of stroke that affects 30,000 patients in North America annually. Due to a wide spectrum of presentations, misdiagnosis of SAH has been reported to occur in a significant proportion of cases. Headache, the most common chief complaint, may be an isolated finding; the neurological examination may be normal and neck stiffness absent. Emergency physicians must decide which patients to evaluate beyond history and physical examination. This evaluation--computed tomography (CT) scanning and lumbar puncture (LP)--is straightforward, but each test has important limitations. CT sensitivity falls with time from onset of symptoms and is lower in mildly affected patients. Traumatic LP must be distinguished from true SAH. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis centers on measuring xanthochromia. Debate exists about the best method to measure it--visual inspection or spectrophotometry. An LP-first strategy is also discussed. If SAH is diagnosed, the priority shifts to specialist consultation and cerebrovascular imaging to define the offending vascular lesion. The sensitivity of CT and magnetic resonance angiography are approaching that of conventional catheter angiography. Emergency physicians must also address various management issues to treat or prevent early complications. Endovascular therapy is being increasingly used, and disposition to neurovascular centers that offer the full range of treatments leads to better patient outcomes. Emergency physicians must be expert in the diagnosis and initial stabilization of patients with SAH. Treatment in a hospital with both neurosurgical and endovascular capability is becoming the norm."

Using this technique, we can obtain images of vessels (angiograms) without injection of contrast medium. We present the results of phase contrast angiography on cerebral and spinal vascular disease. We utilized the General Electric SIGNA, 1.5 tesla NMR. One hundred and ninety-one cases of cerebral and spinal vascular diseases were scanned using phase contrast angiography. Included were 90 cases of occlusive vascular disease, 16 cases of moyamoya disease, 39 cases of arteriovenous malformation, and 28 aneurysms. The phase contrast angiography uses flow encoding gradient pulses, which impart a velocity-dependent phase shift to the transverse magnetization of moving spins. The resulting image contains only information from the moving spins; while information from stationary tissue remains suppressed. In cases using 3-D angiogram, we made 32 images 6 degrees apart in their projection direction and displayed them on a video terminal. We were able to visualize occlusions of vessels, aneurysms, bypassed vessels, and abnormal vessels of arteriovenous malformations. Retrospective evaluation comparing phase contrast angiography with conventional angiography of the stenotic findings on the horizontal portion of middle cerebral arteries (64 vessels of 32 patients), resulted in a false positive ratio of 39.1%. We obtained clinically valuable results regarding the hydrodynamics of patients using ""phase contrast angiography"" non-invasively. These results reveal not only ""anatomical"" images of vessels, but also ""functional"" images, which are sensitive to the pattern of the blood flow. This study would strongly suggest that phase contrast angiography presents a valuable tool for the clinical diagnosis of cerebral and spinal vascular diseases."

The rCBF patterns were correlated with clinical presentation, electroencephalographic patterns, radiologic studies, including computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging of the head, and cerebral angiography. All patients presented with motor weakness that was accompanied in some with dysphasia, defects in visual fields, obtundation, seizures, and high temperature. Perturbations of rCBF with Tc 99m-HMPAO SPECT brain scanning were detected in all patients investigated, with no adverse effects related to the radiotracer. All patients had a focal area of decreased rCBF, with adjacent hyperemia in 3 patients. In 7 patients, there was an rCBF decrease in a vascular distribution, mainly that of the middle cerebral artery, that correlated with the clinical findings and a focal electroencephalogram, as well as computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging of the head. Impairment of rCBF was more extensive in 3 children, while early abnormal SPECT findings preceded abnormal computed tomographic findings in another 2 children. In 2 patients, Tc 99m-HMPAO SPECT was the only positive radiologic test to correlate with focal clinical and electroencephalographic abnormalities, in view of repeated normal computed tomographic scans. We conclude that Tc 99m-HMPAO SPECT brain scanning is a sensitive, complementary diagnostic measure in the early detection, localization, and estimation of rCBF alterations in pediatric cerebrovascular disease."

Magnetic resonance imaging and angiography are useful for diagnosis of cerebral venous thrombosis. A 54-year-old man was admitted with headache, vomiting and right hemiparesis. Computed tomography (CT) revealed subcortical hematoma in the left parietal lobe. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) demonstrated occlusion of the left Labbé vein with dilation of cortical veins and deep cerebral veins. He also suffered from pulmonary embolization and deep vein thrombosis in the lower extremities. Anticoagulant and thrombolytic agents were administered, then respiratory condition and hemiparesis were improved. However, his condition deteriolated 7 months after the initial attack. CT revealed huge subcortical hematoma in the same site. He underwent craniotomy and intracerebral hematoma was evacuated during treatment with vitamin K. His symptom gradually improved and he was discharged with moderate disability 2 months after operation. Dicision of surgical treatment is difficult because there is a risk of rebleeding due to thrombolytic therapy and progressive venous congestion. Since anticoagulant and thrombolytic therapy are inevitable, surgical indication for refractory intracerebral hemorrhage associated with cerebral venous thrombosis should be considered carefully."

We experienced a rare case with ipsilateral cerebral hemorrhage following HZO. Under the diagnosis of cerebral angiitis associated with HZO, we treated her conservatively and observed sequential change of angiography for four months. A 54-year-old female, who had been treated for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), developed HZO on left ophthalmic nerve area. Seven weeks after the onset of HZO, she complained of headache, mild right hemiparesis, and disturbance of consciousness. Computed tomography revealed subcortical hemorrhage at the left temporo-occipital lobe. Cerebral angiography showed vascular irregularities such as segmental narrowing and sausage-like dilation on proximal portion of the ipsilateral anterior, middle and posterior cerebral arteries. Same findings were seen on peripheral portions of the posterior cerebral artery on the same side. Moreover sequential angiograms showed appearance of an aneurysm in the left middle cerebral artery (M2 potion). Under the diagnosis of cerebral angiitis associated with HZO, she was treated with antiviral agents, antiplatelet drugs, steroid and stellate ganglion block. Those irregularities were found to diminish on the sequential angiograms, and the aneurysm disappeared four month later."
CD009372,0,16699848,0,MR angiography of the carotid arteries and intracranial circulation: advantage of a high relaxivity contrast agent.,"Several studies have shown the usefulness of contrast-enhanced MR angiography (CE-MRA) for imaging the supraortic vessels, and, as a consequence, it has rapidly become a routine imaging modality. The main advantage over unenhanced techniques is the possibility to acquire larger volumes, allowing demonstration of the carotid artery from its origin to the intracranial portion. Most published studies on CE-MRA of the carotid arteries have been performed with standard Gd-based chelates whose T1 relaxivity values are similar. Recently new gadolinium chelates such as gadobenate dimeglumine (Gd-BOP-TA, MultiHance; Bracco Imaging, Milan, Italy) have been developed which have markedly higher intravascular T1 relaxivity values. When administered at an equivalent dose to that of a standard agent, these newer contrast agents produce significantly greater intravascular signal enhancement. The availability of an appropriate high-relaxivity contrast agent might also help to overcome some of the intrinsic technical problems (e. g. those related to flow) that affect time-of-flight (TOF) and phase contrast (PC) MR angiography of the intracranial vasculature. To avoid the problem of superimposition of veins, ultrafast gradient echo MRA techniques with very short TR and TE have been developed. Although the precise sequence parameters vary between manufacturers, they are basically similar. The choice between performing a time-resolved or high spatial resolution CE-MRA examination depends upon the precise clinical application. The most common applications include the study of cerebral aneurysms, arteriovenous malformations, dural arteriovenous fistulas and dural venous diseases."

However, the clinical efficacy of mass screening of UIA using MRA has not been established. This study aims to establish the clinical efficacy of mass screening of UIA using MRA by decision-making. The decision tree is constructed simulating a flow of population (100,000 persons, aged 50-59) starting from the MRA screening until the final outcomes of quality adjusted life or death in ten years. In order to estimate the numerical values various parameters were used as follows, prevalence rate: 1%; sensitivity of MRA: 74%; specificity of MRA: 76%; death rate by intracranial angiography: 0.1%; rupture rate of UIA: 2%/year; death rate of SAH: 57%; and death rate for surgery for UIA: 0.0%. The following results were obtained: 1. The number of lives saved by the MRA screening was 760, while the number saved without MRA was 79. 2. The number of deaths in those receiving the MRA screening was 52, while the number of deaths without MRA was 104. 3. The level of quality adjusted life with the MRA screening was higher than that without MRA in all cases. In conclusion, mass screening of UIA using MRA appears to be effective."

Standard methods of investigation appropriate to the period were used, i.e. cerebral angiography, CT and MR scanning. Recently, some patients had specific venous studies including intraluminal cranial venous sinus pressure measurements. A sub-group (25 patients) was investigated for haematological abnormalities. The overall incidence of cranial venous outflow abnormality was 19.7% (37 cases). In decades, related to the predominant investigative method, the figures were: to 1979, 4.2% (2 cases); to 1989, 15.0% (8 cases); to 1999, 31.0% (27 cases). A cause of the venous abnormality was identified in 20 cases, most commonly haematological and iatrogenic. In 17 patients (all females) no cause was identified. Fifteen of the 25 patients (60%) tested specifically were found to have a haematological abnormality, although no correlation was shown between this and a demonstrable venous outflow abnormality. The conclusion was drawn that there is a high incidence (close to one-third) of venous outflow abnormalities in PTS with detailed investigation. Issues of mechanism and therapy are discussed."

CD009372,0,2980426,0,Focal recurrent hemorrhage on magnetic resonance at 0.5 tesla. An aid to the diagnosis of cryptic cerebral vascular malformations.,"The MR appearance of focal recurrent hemorrhage is characteristic and highly suggestive of an underlying cryptic vascular malformation. We reviewed the MR findings in 14 cases (3 biopsy proven), 9 in the brainstem and 5 supratentorial. CT in all cases demonstrated the lesion to be hyperdense before contrast with minimal to moderate enhancement post contrast. The angiograms were negative in all 14 cases demonstrating mass effect in some but no blush or neovascularity. MR showed focal hyperintensities on both short (T1) and long (T2) TR sequences surrounded by a well-circumscribed hypointense rim particularly on the long TR sequence. Focal central hyperintensity is felt to be secondary to the presence of methemoglobin and indicates relatively recent hemorrhage. In our experience hyperintensity in a solitary hemorrhage usually resolves in 4-6 weeks. In 8 cases serial MR studies over 2-3 years demonstrated evidence of repeated hemorrhage as manifested by increases in size and persistent or new hyperintensity. The intense rim due to a short T2 did not correlate with vessels angiographically nor with calcification on the pre-contrast CT and, therefore, does not represent the vascular malformation itself but rather some portion of the hematoma, possibly the hemosiderin laden capsule. Using CT and angiography alone it is difficult to differentiate cryptic arteriovenous malformations from a neoplasm particularly in the brainstem. MR's specific configuration of focal recurrent hemorrhage can make a more definitive diagnosis at 0.5 T as well as at 1.5 T."

We report the case of a man who presented a jugular vein thrombosis responsible for severe intracranial hypertension. Because of clinical worsening despite intravenous heparin and symptomatic treatment, endovascular procedure including the placement of five venous stents, thrombolysis and balloon angioplasty, was performed and led to venous recanalization with successful clinical outcome.

A 43-year-old male suffered sudden headache and vomiting. Neurological examination revealed mild consciousness disturbance and dysarthria. The computed tomography (CT) scans showed intraventricular hemorrhage, which was drained through burr holes bifrontally. The diagnosis of Moyamoya disease was subsequently made by cerebral angiography. A month later he was discharged with mild gait disturbance and mental retardation. Seven years later he suddenly complained of gait disturbance, dysarthria and sensory disturbance involving the right upper extremity. A CT scan revealed a small hemorrhage in the left putamen. Carotid angiograms disclosed transcranial EC-IC anastomosis through the burr holes which had been made previously.

CD009372,0,20227278,1,Comparisons of DSA and MR angiography with digital subtraction angiography in 151 patients with subacute spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage.,"To exclude underlying vascular abnormalities in patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage, the traditional paradigm requires investigation using digital subtraction angiography (DSA) in both the acute and subacute phases. We investigated whether MRI and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), in the subacute stage of intracerebral hematoma, had high positive predictive values (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV) in screening for vascular abnormality in the routine clinical setting. In a regional neurosurgical center in Hong Kong, we retrospectively reviewed 151 patients investigated with both MRI and DSA for underlying structural vascular abnormalities during the subacute phase. Sensitivity, specificity, and intermodality agreement were assessed. A total of 70/151 (46%) vascular lesions accountable for the hemorrhage were found. Patients with vascular abnormalities tended to be younger (mean age+/-standard deviation [SD], 33+/-15years), less likely to be hypertensive (6.3%), and the lesion was more likely to be accompanied by intraventricular hemorrhage (22%). In terms of cerebral arteriovenous malformation and dural arteriovenous fistulas, MRI/MRA had a PPV of 0.98 and a NPV of 1.00. We concluded that MRI/MRA was able to detect most structural vascular abnormalities in the subacute phase in most patients and, thus, its use is recommended as the screening test."

Since specific diagnosis and, perhaps, eventual treatment, derives in part from diagnostic testing, we examined the effect of clinical condition, geographic and demographic factors on the incidence of certain diagnostic tests after acute stroke. In this multivariable analysis, race, sex, history of hypertension and history of diabetes did not influence the chance of having any test, but older age strongly reduced the chances of receiving extensive evaluation. When CT scanning was available, the utilization of a CT as well as other diagnostic studies including cerebral angiography, radionuclide brain scan, EEG and EKG was increased. The odds of receiving a CT scan increased if the patient was married, and decreased with a history of previous stroke. A history of previous TIA increased the chance of having a cerebral angiogram while a history of cardiac disease decreased the chance. There were striking regional geographic differences in the use of CT, radionuclide brain scanning and cerebral angiography which may, in part, reflect differences between the availability of these technologies in urban and rural hospitals. These results indicate that evaluation of stroke patients remains heterogenous."

The 10 cases, in which CT was performed within 7 days after the onset of a ruptured AVM, presented with blood stained CSF except for two cases. All of the 10 cases showed intracerebral haemorrhages in the CT findings, and four of these cases were associated with ventricular rupture. In the plain CT of these 10 cases, high density in the cerebral cistern, such as seen in the acute stage of ruptured intracranial aneurysms, was not found except for 1 case. In the enhanced CT within 7 days after the onset of ruptured AVM, no enhanced findings were found in eight cases. On the contrary, in 12 cases in which CT was performed later than the 8th day after the onset, enhanced findings were found in 11 cases. It has been previously reported that SAH is seen in the lesion of ruptured AVM in the acute stage. From our CT findings of ruptured AVM in the acute stage, however, it was concluded that the lesion of a ruptured AVM in the acute stage does not cause SAH but an intracerebral haematoma or ventricular rupture and that blood may enter the CSF only secondarily."

CD009372,0,17555581,0,Fibromuscular dysplasia.,"Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD), formerly called fibromuscular fibroplasia, is a group of nonatherosclerotic, noninflammatory arterial diseases that most commonly involve the renal and carotid arteries. The prevalence of symptomatic renal artery FMD is about 4/1000 and the prevalence of cervicocranial FMD is probably half that. Histological classification discriminates three main subtypes, intimal, medial and perimedial, which may be associated in a single patient. Angiographic classification includes the multifocal type, with multiple stenoses and the 'string-of-beads' appearance that is related to medial FMD, and tubular and focal types, which are not clearly related to specific histological lesions. Renovascular hypertension is the most common manifestation of renal artery FMD. Multifocal stenoses with the 'string-of-beads' appearance are observed at angiography in more than 80% of cases, mostly in women aged between 30 and 50 years; they generally involve the middle and distal two-thirds of the main renal artery and in some case also renal artery branches. Cervicocranial FMD can be complicated by dissection with headache, Horner's syndrome or stroke, or can be associated with intracerebral aneurysms with a risk of subarachnoid or intracerebral hemorrhage. The etiology of FMD is unknown, although various hormonal and mechanical factors have been suggested. Subclinical lesions are found at arterial sites distant from the stenotic arteries, and this suggests that FMD is a systemic arterial disease. It appears to be familial in 10% of cases. Noninvasive diagnostic tests include, in increasing order of accuracy, ultrasonography, magnetic resonance angiography and computed tomography angiography. The gold standard for diagnosing FMD is catheter angiography, but this invasive procedure is only used for patients in whom it is clinically pertinent to proceed with revascularization during the same procedure. Differential diagnosis include atherosclerotic stenoses and stenoses associated with vascular Ehlers-Danlos and Williams' syndromes, and type 1 neurofibromatosis. Management of cases with renovascular hypertension includes antihypertensive therapy, percutaneous angioplasty of severe stenoses, and reconstructive surgery in cases with complex FMD that extends to segmental arteries. The therapeutic options for securing ruptured intracerebral aneurysms are microvascular neurosurgical clipping and endovascular coiling. Stenosis progression in renal artery FMD is slow and rarely leads to ischemic renal failure."

CD009372,0,23466430,0,Hematoma expansion following acute intracerebral hemorrhage.,"Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), the most devastating form of stroke, has no specific therapy proven to improve outcome by randomized controlled trial. Location and baseline hematoma volume are strong predictors of mortality, but are nonmodifiable by the time of diagnosis. Expansion of the initial hematoma is a further marker of poor prognosis that may be at least partly preventable. Several risk factors for hematoma expansion have been identified, including baseline ICH volume, early presentation after symptom onset, anticoagulation, and the CT angiography spot sign. Although the biological mechanisms of hematoma expansion remain unclear, accumulating evidence supports a model of ongoing secondary bleeding from ruptured adjacent vessels surrounding the initial bleeding site. Several large clinical trials testing therapies aimed at preventing hematoma expansion are in progress, including aggressive blood pressure reduction, treatment with recombinant factor VIIa guided by CT angiography findings, and surgical intervention for superficial hematomas without intraventricular extension. Hematoma expansion is so far the only marker of outcome that is amenable to treatment and thus a potentially important therapeutic target."

An exact diagnosis of the causative pathology must be made before starting the therapy, and this must happen in the shortest possible period of time. Using imaging techniques, the whole spectrum of differential diagnoses of cerebral ischemia must be covered, including above all intracerebral and subarachnoid hemorrhage. Although computed tomography (CT) is excellently suited for determining hemorrhage, infarct can be recognized with much better contrast using diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) imaging (DWI). Stroke MR imaging additionally allows the representation of vital ""tissue at risk"" of infarction using perfusion images as well as the recognition of vessel occlusion using MR angiography. This paper is intended to define the usefulness of DWI in comparison to CT techniques and to elucidate the use of diffusion coefficients for differentiating the various stages of infarction. Besides presenting an explanation of the basic principles of modern stroke MR imaging, typical results of MR perfusion measurements and the appearance of hemorrhages on MR will be explained."

A 43-year-old jogger hit his forehead in the traffic accident. After medical care for the wound at the near hospital, he walked to home without any neurological deficits. On the following day, he complained of headache, nausea and slight gait disturbance, so the visited us 5 days after head trauma. On the biplane computed tomograms, interhemispheric subdural hematoma was detected. A distinct avascular space in this portion was found on the right carotid angiograms. Treated conservatively with repeated computed tomography, he recovered completely well about a month after head trauma. Analyzing 7 cases, following comments were obtained; Age distribution was between 23 to 74 and all were male. The mechanism of the hematoma formation in such region remained still unclear, but seemed to be caused partially due to rotational cerebral injuries. Characteristic clinical symptom was hemiparesis, predominantly crural or crural monoparesis. This symptom was found in four of seven cases on the same side of the hematoma, that was supposed due to the compression of the contralateral blood flow the distal anterior cerebral artery. Neuroradiologically, on the angiograms, the internal branches of callosomarginal arteries turned away from the middle parallel to the pericallosal artery stayed in the middle and between them, a distinct avascular space was found. On the biplane computed tomograms, semilunar high density area was identified along the midline, bounded medially by the falx cerebri, laterally by the convex border against the brain parenchyma, inferiorly by the tentorium. Although the anteroposterior extension of the hematoma was recognized on the axial plane, the superoinferior extension, especially in relation to the tentorium, was well shown on the coronal plane. On the electroencephalogram, no characteristic findings were obtained. Abnormalities blood coagulation were found in a case. Five cases were operated on and 2 cases treated conservatively, and the outcome was good in all. The following diseases had to be differentiated: hematomas due to the rupture of peripheral anterior cerebral artery aneurysms, including traumatic ones, blood coagulopathy or medication of anticoagulants. Tumors such as parasagittal or falx meningiomas, subdural abscesses localized in the interhemisphere, infarctions of distal anterior cerebral artery."
CD009372,0,1878867,0,Cerebral cavernous malformations (cavernomas) in the pediatric age-group.,"Cavernomas are vascular malformations composed of a compact mass of sinusoidal-type vessels that are immediately contiguous with one another and have no intervening parenchyma. Cavernous malformations were previously held to be a rare pathology occurring predominantly in adults. New neuroradiological techniques such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrate, on the contrary, that these lesions are also more frequent during childhood than was previously thought. In our institution we observed 17 cases of cavernous malformations in patients aged between 18 months and 16 years, 16 of whom were diagnosed after 1982. In 4 of these cases there was a documented familial history; in 2 multiple malformations were present. The most common site was the subcortical frontal region, but in 1 case the malformation was located in the pineal region. The most frequent (in 12 cases) initial symptom was hemorrhage, with the characteristics of an intracerebral hematoma. In 4 cases the initial symptom consisted of epileptic fits and 2 of these patients subsequently suffered hemorrhage. In one case the symptoms observed were those of an expansile process. All our patients underwent cerebral angiography and only in 1 case did this show a vascular abnormality. CT, performed in 16 patients, gave positive results in all cases. MRI, performed in 12 patients, gave highly significant images in all cases. Radical surgical removal of the malformation was performed in 15 of the 17 patients, and the results can be considered excellent in the majority of cases. Cavernous malformations are, therefore, more frequent lesions than had previously been thought, especially in pediatric patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

CD009372,0,10461508,0,Stroke: indications for emergent surgical intervention.,"As the brain attack message is disseminated throughout our medical community and the awareness of the public increases, neurosurgeons will have the opportunity to treat patients with stroke at a much earlier time in the evolution of the process than we have been accustomed. Are the relatively unimpressive results of acute surgical intervention in patients operated on later in the course of the disease applicable to those who seek medical attention early, within the first few hours of ictus? There is little firm data. However, there is an overwhelming amount of anecdotal and experimental evidence supporting the potential for ultra-early intervention, which frequently should be surgical. New surgical techniques may improve safety and feasibility of emergent operations. In the coming years, diagnostic techniques such as perfusion/diffusion magnetic resonance imaging will allow the clinician to determine who may benefit from intervention. These determinations will be made on physiological data, addressing the issues of tissue viability and degree of compromise of the blood-brain barrier. In the future, the window of opportunity for intervention will not be solely a function of time from ictus or a qualitative impression based on collateral circulation as extrapolated from angiography, transcranial Doppler, or magnetic resonance angiography. These new magnetic resonance imaging techniques, which are beginning to be tested clinically or are still in the developmental stages, will provide the functional data now provided by positron emission tomography and xenon computed tomography, but with improved sensitivity, specificity, and logistical ease. Neurosurgeons have been leaders in stroke care and have provided some of the most important experimental rationale for the brain attack concept. These contributions include demonstration of the ischemic penumbra, the importance of time and potential collateral circulation as factors determining viability of ischemic tissue, and the value of early revascularization and many neuroprotective maneuvers in preserving brain tissue after arterial occlusion. There is every reason to preserve and to enhance the role of the neurosurgeon as a ""stroke expert"" and as a leading member of the brain attack team. Early access to patients with stroke will offer us the opportunity to test clinically, in a rigorous fashion, the value of surgical revascularization procedures (open or endovascular) and medical maneuvers that we have developed clinically and tested in the laboratory. We have shown, as we did with the bypass study, that neurosurgeons know how to perform these trials and abide by their results, even when they are not to our liking."

It is well known that heroin, ephedrine, and methamphetamine use may result in cerebral vasculitis, but only one case study in the literature has reported on cerebral vasculitis with ischemic stroke secondary to cocaine abuse.

CD009372,0,2654588,0,Doppler diagnosis in cases of acute stroke.,"Ultrasound techniques are employed increasingly for the evaluation of patients with cerebrovascular disease. We determined the accuracy of carotid Doppler ultrasonography, which incorporated spectral analysis and periorbital directional Doppler assessment, by comparison with conventional or digital-subtraction arteriography in 93 patients (186 vessels). We also reviewed our experience with the Doppler technique in consecutive patients who were admitted to hospital with established carotid-territory stroke. The Doppler technique had a sensitivity of 93% and a specificity of 97% as a screening test for the presence of carotid stenosis, and a high level of precision. The arteriography rate in patients with completed stroke was 40% before the introduction of Doppler ultrasonography but decreased to 24% after its introduction, and to 16% in the last 100 cases. The proportion of cases in whom an underlying cause for stroke could not be identified decreased from 31% of cases to 21% of cases. Extracranial carotid stenosis was implicated in only 22 of the last 100 patients with carotid-territory stroke. Doppler ultrasonography is a valuable diagnostic tool in patients with completed stroke. It aids in the selection of patients for arteriography and provides clues to the pathogenesis of stroke in patients in whom arteriography is inappropriate."

However, there are reports in the literature of proven traumatic intracranial hematoma of delayed onset after a negative computer tomographic or arteriographic study of the brain. We present a case of a 70-year-old patient admitted to the Clinic after a road accident. On admission the patient was disoriented in regard to time but his neurological status was otherwise normal. On the second day after admission the patient's condition deteriorated and he became comatose with moderate left hemiparesis.

Thirty-two normal subjects, and 11 patients with cerebrovascular diseases including vasospasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage, middle cerebral artery stenosis, and extracranial internal carotid artery stenosis were studied by transcranial Doppler. Increased peak velocity and spectral broadening of the reflected signal corresponded to clinical and angiographic evidence of middle cerebral artery vasospasm or stenosis. Decreased peak velocity and blunted waveforms occurred in the middle cerebral artery ipsilateral to severe extracranial internal carotid stenosis with poor crossfilling from the contralateral carotid artery. Abnormalities resolved following carotid endarterectomy. Transcranial Doppler identifies vasospasm or stenosis of the middle cerebral artery and may allow noninvasive evaluation of collateral flow across the anterior circle of Willis in patients with extracranial carotid artery stenosis."

CT of the head revealed an intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH) predominantly in the fourth and third ventricles without subarachnoid hemorrhage and associated with hydrocephalus. Cerebral angiography demonstrated an aneurysm at the choroidal branch of the PICA. The aneurysm was resected through a bilateral suboccipital craniotomy. The patient made a remarkable recovery. The literature describes five other cases of aneurysms arising from a choroidal branch of the PICA. Hypertension was a common finding in this population. In summary, aneurysms arising from a choroidal branch of the PICA are rare. Hypertensive vessel damage might be a major factor in their pathogenesis.

Group 1 patients were thought to have a high probability of an underlying structural lesion and underwent cerebral angiography acutely. If normal, this was repeated at three months. Group 2 patients were thought not to have such a lesion and underwent angiography at three months. Patients older than the mean age of the study population, and hypertensive patients were much less likely to harbour an aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation than younger or normotensive patients (p < 0.01; sensitivity 87.9%, specificity 88.6%). An aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation was the cause of haemorrhage in 12.8% of hypertensive patients, in 30.9% of patients with haematoma involving the basal ganglia, and 18.2% of those with posterior fossa haemorrhage. Features of CT in isolation give a sensitivity of 77.2% and a specificity of 84.2%. Follow up angiography in group 1 showed an arteriovenous malformation in one of seven patients in whom the original study was normal.

We report two cases of intracerebral hemorrhage with biopsy-proven cerebral vasculitis associated with the use of cocaine. The first case involved a 32-year-old man who presented with headache, left-sided hemiparesis, and severe hypertension and who was found to have a large right putaminal hemorrhage on cranial tomographic (CT) scan. Cerebral angiography did not show vasculitic changes, but brain tissue obtained during hematoma evacuation revealed a nonnecrotizing leukocytoclastic angiitis of the small vessels. The second case involved a 20-year-old man who presented with headache, agitation, and speech difficulty that progressed to disorientation and dysphasia. He had a large left temporoparietal hematoma seen on CT scan. Cerebral angiography was consistent with vasculitis, and brain tissue obtained during hematoma evacuation revealed a small vessel vasculitis. In both cases, thorough clinical and laboratory investigations found no evidence of systemic vasculitis or an etiologic agent other than cocaine. We also critically reviewed the previously reported cases of cocaine-associated cerebral vasculitis and the relevant medical literature to discuss the ""cocaine-associated vasculitis syndrome"" in the context of more established vasculitidies, including hypersensitivity vasculitis.

Computed tomographic scans demonstrated massive subarachnoid hemorrhage and hematoma in the corpus callosum. Cerebral angiography revealed nonfilling of bilateral intracranial carotid arteries and extravasation of contrast medium from the right pericallosal artery which was visualized retrogradely via the vertebral artery. Postmortem studies found cerebral edema, subarachnoid, intraventricular, and intracerebral hemorrhage, and intracranial vasculitis, but no aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation. Necrosis of vessel walls with destruction of the smooth muscle layer, but no leukocytotic infiltration of the vessel walls were observed in all major cerebral arteries.

Tumour-associated bleeding is the cause of 6-10% of ICHs, mostly from metastases. We present the case of a 40-year-old female admitted originally for neck pain of sudden onset, accompanied by nausea and marked right arm paresis. A CT-scan revealed left fronto-central cortico-subcortical haemorrhage. Cerebral angiography was normal. Two months after the initial event the residual paresis worsened and the patient developed neuropsychological deficits. A CT-scan showed oedema around the original bleeding site, on MRI a solid lesion with a diameter of 5 cm could be seen, with some cystic alterations and contact to the meninges. The tumour was surgically removed, and removal at the time was considered complete. Histological analysis proved it to be an embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma. The patient's neurological deficits gradually improved. Almost three months after the operation she complained of intense left-sided headache. On CT a hyperdense left fronto-central lesion with positive enhancement could be seen; MRI confirmed a relapse tumour and showed bleeding in the rostral portion of the tumour as well as oedema. The patient started radiation therapy with a total dose of 60 Gy. Whole body image studies at the time failed to reveal any other neoplastic lesions. Two months later a CT-scan showed continued tumour growth. We present this case as a rare aetiology of intracerebral haemorrhage, more frequently associated with arterial hypertension or vascular pathology, as well as being an unusual manifestation of embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma, rarely found in the brain. The case also serves to illustrate the importance of a thorough diagnosis including MRI imaging in patients with so-called atypical ICH."

In normotensive rat, hypercapnia rapidly distended the perforators between 3 and 15 min after induction and major trunk vessels distended more rapidly in 3-6 min. Systemic hypotension made by stepwise hemorrhage distended the perforators up to 158% of control values but constricted most of the large cerebral trunk vessels. In spontaneous hypertensive rats, systemic hypotension-induced distension disappeared in perforators, indicating that perforators with chronic hypertension lose their autoregulatory distensibility."

This syndrome is seen mainly in middle-aged adults, predominantly women. Herein, we report on a pediatric case of RCVS with cortical subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). A 12-year-old boy developed acute, severe headache with paralysis of lower extremities causing gait disturbance after administration of eletriptan. Brain magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) revealed multifocal narrowing of the cerebral arteries, whereas magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated sulcal hyperintensity on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, consistent with cortical SAH. The patient's clinical symptoms resolved spontaneously after a few days and the MRI and MRA findings disappeared 3 months later, suggesting a diagnosis of RCVS. Eletriptan might cause vasoconstriction of cerebral arteries. Although most patients with RCVS are adults and pediatric cases are rare, RCVS should be considered in a child complaining of severe headache."

The patient was alert and complained of precordial chest discomfort, dyspnea and shoulder stiffness. Echocardiography demonstrated normal left ventricle contraction with hypertrophy. Computed tomography (CT) and subsequent cerebral angiography revealed subarachnoid hemorrhage and saccular aneurysm at the anterior communicating artery.

CD009372,0,23406825,0,Idiopathic intraventricular aneurysm presenting with intraventricular hemorrhage: case report and review of the literature.,"Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) is a relatively commonly encountered problem in neurosurgical practice. The underlying causes could include hypertension, arteriovenous malformations (AVM), angiomas, trauma, tumors, aneurysms and moyamoya disease. Truly idiopathic intraventricular aneurysms (IVA) are rare. A high index of suspicion needs to be maintained since, with the appropriate treatment, the outcome is generally good. We report the case of a 14-year-old boy who presented with sudden onset headache and vomiting. CT angiogram pointed to the possibility of an IVA. This was confirmed by MRI with three-dimensional constructive interference in steady state (CISS-3D) sequences and digital subtraction angiography. The patient underwent microsurgical excision of the aneurysm and is doing well on follow-up. Idiopathic IVA can present with IVH at any age. MRI with CISS-3D and MR angiography would be the imaging modality of choice since it can also rule out other causes of intraventricular bleeding such as tumors and AVM. These lesions could be managed effectively by microsurgical excision/clipping. The necessity of investigating every patient who presents with IVH is debatable."

We conducted a retrospective analysis of the clinical and radiological outcomes of this treatment strategy and morphological factors associated with the success of endovascular coiling, to assess the safety and feasibility of our management strategy. From January 2003 to January 2012, we attempted endovascular coiling as the first-intention treatment for 30 consecutive patients with ruptured pericallosal artery aneurysms including those with intracerebral hematoma. Twenty-seven cases of ruptured pericallosal artery aneurysms were successfully embolized with coiling whereas three failures required surgery. Four patients experienced periprocedural complications including thromboembolic event in two and hematoma enlargement after coiling in two. A maximum aneurysm diameter of <3 mm was most strongly associated with failure of endovascular coiling. Of the 27 coil-treated aneurysms, immediate angiographic results showed complete aneurysm occlusion in 19 cases, neck remnant in 6, and residual aneurysm in 2. One patient had a major aneurysm recurrence that was uneventfully reembolized. Sixteen of our 30 patients had good outcomes (modified Rankin scale [mRS] 0-2), 7 had moderate disability (mRS 3), and 4 had severe disability (mRS 4-5) at 3 months after treatment. The management strategy for coiling as the first-intention treatment for ruptured pericallosal artery aneurysms has the potential to become an acceptable alternative to surgical clipping for selected cases, although a larger study population and longer follow-up periods are needed before definitive conclusions can be drawn."

MR-perfusion imaging primarily depicts the relative cerebral blood volume. The aim of this study was to test whether MR-perfusion imaging with a clinical MR scanner using a standard 2D-FLASH sequence provides clinically relevant information on patients with cerebrovascular diseases and brain tumors. Brain infarctions, lesions in cerebral microangiopathy and occlusions of the carotid artery with very poor collateralization showed definite differences in perfusion imaging compared with normal controls.

Three-dimensional computed tomographic angiography allows excellent visualization of the aneurysm, its neck, and its relationship with the parent artery and important adjacent bony structures. This technique has a major role in the evaluation of difficult aneurysms. In addition, advantages and disadvantages are discussed in comparison with more conventional techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging, magnetic resonance angiography, and digital subtraction angiography. Three-dimensional computed tomographic angiography will continue to develop with the advent of more rapid computed tomography scanners, playing a key role in the investigation and screening of patients with a family history of cerebral aneurysms."
CD009372,0,22904102,0,Severe venous congestive encephalopathy secondary to a dialysis arteriovenous graft.,"The clinical presentation and imaging of venous congestive encephalopathy (VCE) can mimic several neurological conditions, making the diagnosis challenging. We report a patient with end stage renal disease on dialysis who presented with a right occipital infarction. The patient developed progressive encephalopathy and increased intracranial pressure. Extensive imaging, electroencephalography and serum analysis did not explain the cause of his infarction and progressive neurological deterioration. Finally, cerebral angiography and venography demonstrated severe generalized VCE due to arterial shunting from a right upper extremity arteriovenous graft (AVG) and an occluded right innominate venous trunk. The right arm shunt resulted in severe cerebral venous hypertension due to ipsilateral occlusion of the innominate venous trunk. After the AVG was repaired, the cerebral venous hypertension resolved and the patient returned to baseline."

A brain CT scan showed intracerebral haemorrhage in the left frontoparietal area, but a cerebral angiogram and MRI revealed no vascular anomaly. The patient was managed conservatively and his headache and visual loss improved over time. Hypertension in the form of paroxysmal attacks led us to suspect phaeochromocytoma. Subsequently, the patient was diagnosed with an extra-adrenal phaeochromocytoma in the left para-aortic area following endocrinological evaluation, abdominal CT scan and (131)I-meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy. The patient presented here illustrates the importance of a careful search for a remediable cause of hypertension in children and young adults with spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage."
CD009372,0,19950046,0,[The dural arteriovenous fistula - an unimposing morphological correlate with imposing consequences].,"Dural arteriovenous fistulas (DAVFs) are abnormal arteriovenous shunts located within the dura mater representing approximately 10 - 15 % of all arteriovenous shunts in the central nervous system. The aetiology of spontaneous DAVFs remains to be elucidated. The symptoms associated with DAVFs can be highly variable and dependent upon the direction of the blood flow, the amount of arteriovenous shunting and the specific location of the fistula. Considering the diversity of clinical presentation in the setting of unremarkable imaging results, diagnosing a DAVF can be difficult. To avoid permanent neurological deficits due to DAVFs, it is important to consider the possibility of a DAVF whenever one encounters unclear neurological symptoms and to initiate appropriate diagnostic procedures including intraarterial DSA and MRI/MRA. The current DAVF classification accounts for the disparity of clinical symptoms, therapeutic/interventional implications as well as vital complications depending on each particular fistula subtype. While type I DAVFs drain anterogradely into a cerebral sinus and mainly cause functional deficits, the risk for severe intracerebral bleeding increases when DAVFs drain retrogradely (type II), or into cortical (types III and IV), perimedullar or radiculo-medullar veins (type V), respectively. In particular in the case of type IIb to V DAVFs, the appropriate treatment option is a complete fistula occlusion by transvenous embolization, transarterial glue or particulate embolization or surgery. In the following we systematically explain the differential anatomy underlying DAVFs and discuss possible symptoms and necessary diagnostic and therapeutic means. In that, we are seeking to increase attention for this rare, but clinically relevant neurological disease."

Stroke was diagnosed by CT scan in eight full-term neonates. Three dimensional (volume) magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) is a noninvasive technique that images the arterial vessels without contrast agents. All patients, aged from 1.5 to 8.4 years, were investigated by MRI and MRA and by neuropsychological tests. Cognitive development was investigated by intelligence tests, tests of visual perception, motor and language development. Out of the eight patients, seven had a retarded mental and motor development, and 50% of the children were treated for epilepsy. Seven patients had a spastic hemiparesis. Seven out of eight children showed major cognitive deficits. In all patients, MRI revealed clear parenchymal defects with variable distribution patterns. MRA studies showed abnormalities corresponding to the expected vascular distribution. Children with complications at delivery, with seizures, and an interruption of the main stem of MCA as demonstrated on MRA had the least favourable long-term follow up prognosis with severe cognitive delays."

CD009372,0,1633456,0,Charged-particle radiosurgery for intracranial vascular malformations.,"Heavy charged-particle radiation has unique physical characteristics that offer several advantages over photons and protons for stereotactic radiosurgery of intracranial AVMs. These include improved dose distributions with depth in tissue, small angle of lateral scattering, and sharp distal fall-off of dose in the Bragg ionization peak. Under multi-institutionally approved clinical trials, we have used stereotactic helium-ion Bragg peak radiosurgery to treat approximately 400 patients with symptomatic, surgically inaccessible vascular malformations at the UCB-LBL 184-in synchrocyclotron and bevatron. Treatment planning for stereotactic heavy charged-particle radiosurgery for intracranial vascular disorders integrates anatomic and physical information from the stereotactic cerebral angiogram and stereotactic CT and MR imaging scans for each patient, using computerized treatment-planning calculations for optimal isodose contour distribution. The shape of an intracranial AVM is associated strongly with its treatability and potential clinical outcome. In this respect, heavy charged-particle radiosurgery has distinct advantages over other radiosurgical methods; the unique physical properties allow the shaping of individual beams to encompass the contours of large and complexly shaped AVMs, while sparing important adjacent neural structures. We have had a long-term dose-searching clinical protocol in collaboration with SUMC and UCSF and have followed up over 300 patients for more than 2 years. Initially, treatment doses ranged from 45 GyE to 35 GyE. Currently, total doses up to 25 GyE are delivered to treatment volumes ranging from 0.1 cm3 to 70 cm3. This represents a relatively homogeneous dose distribution, with the 90% isodose surface contoured to the periphery of the lesion; there is considerable protection of normal adjacent brain tissues, and most of the brain receives no radiation exposure. Dose selection depends on the volume, shape, and location of the AVM and several other factors, including the volume of normal brain that must be traversed by the plateau portion of the charged-particle beam. The first 230 patients have been evaluated clinically to the end of 1989. Using the clinical grading of Drake, about 90% of the patients had an excellent or good neurologic grade, about 5% had a poor grade, and about 5% had progression of disease and died, or died as a result of unrelated intercurrent illness. Neuroradiologic follow-up to the end of 1989 indicated the following rates of complete angiographic obliteration 3 years after treatment: 90% to 95% for AVM treatment volumes less than 4 cm3, 90% to 95% for volumes 4 to 14 cm3, and 60% to 70% for volumes greater than 14 cm3.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

CD009372,0,20110380,0,Cerebral microvascular disease predicts renal failure in type 2 diabetes.,"Abnormalities in small renal vessels may increase the risk of developing impaired renal function, but methods to assess these vessels are extremely limited. We hypothesized that the presence of small vessel disease in the brain, which manifests as silent cerebral infarction (SCI), may predict the progression of kidney disease in patients with type 2 diabetes. We recruited 608 patients with type 2 diabetes without apparent cerebrovascular or cardiovascular disease or overt nephropathy and followed them for a mean of 7.5 years. At baseline, 177 of 608 patients had SCI, diagnosed by cerebral magnetic resonance imaging. The risk for the primary outcome of ESRD or death was significantly higher for patients with SCI than for patients without SCI [hazard ratio, 2.44; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.36 to 4.38]. The risk for the secondary renal end point of any dialysis or doubling of the serum creatinine concentration was also significantly higher for patients with SCI (hazard ratio, 4.79; 95% CI 2.72 to 8.46). The estimated GFR declined more in patients with SCI than in those without SCI; however, the presence of SCI did not increase the risk for progression of albuminuria. In conclusion, independent of microalbuminuria, cerebral microvascular disease predicted renal morbidity among patients with type 2 diabetes."
CD009372,0,10883918,0,Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis following subarachnoid hemorrhage. Case report.,"The authors present a case of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (HITT) that occurred after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), and they review the relevant literature. An immune-mediated syndrome, HITT is characterized by moderate thrombocytopenia and paradoxical vascular thromboses. Although it has been estimated in prospective studies that HITT occurs in between 1 and 3% of patients receiving heparin, it is underrecognized in the neurosurgical literature. In the present case, a 49-year-old woman underwent clipping of a right posterior communicating artery aneurysm after suffering a Hunt and Hess Grade III SAH. She had an uncomplicated postoperative course with good clip positioning and no vasospasm observed on a cerebral angiogram obtained on Day 7. On Day 23, the patient developed a right hemiparesis and experienced a grand mal seizure. A head computerized tomography scan revealed a hemorrhagic infarct in the left middle cerebral artery distribution. Repeated cerebral angiograms did not show vasospasm. She was thrombocytopenic (platelet count as low as 46 x 10(9)/L on Day 28 compared with 213 x 10(9)/L on Day 1) and had been receiving heparin flushes to maintain intravenous catheter patency. An assay for HITT-associated antibodies was positive. The heparin flushes were discontinued and the platelet count recovered (121 x 10(9)/L). She improved neurologically, but was left with a significant right hemiparesis at discharge. This patient had assay-proven heparin-induced thrombocytopenia despite minimal exposure to heparin. Because there was no evidence of vasospasm or other factors to account for her delayed hemorrhagic infarction, an HITT-related disorder seemed most likely. Despite a large body of literature describing HITT in nonneurosurgical patients, only three previous neurosurgical cases have been published. This case report may serve to heighten awareness of this disorder."

The study is prospective and consecutive comprising stroke patients below the age of 75 years, admitted in the acute state i.e. within 3 days after stroke onset. Excluded were patients with intracerebral hematoma, subarachnoid hemorrhage, vertebrobasilar stroke and patients in whom another severe disease was present. Cerebral angiography and CT-scan were performed in all patients within one and two days after admission. CT-scan was repeated 2 weeks and 6 months later. Forty percent had MCA occlusion, none had MCA stenosis, 12% had ICA occlusion, 14% had severe ICA stenosis (half of these were associated with MCA occlusion) and 41% were without significant MCA/ICA lesions. Twenty-seven percent had large infarcts with a diameter greater than 3 cm; 34% had medium-sized infarcts with a diameter between 3 and 1.5 cm; 21% had small infarcts with a diameter less than 1.5 cm; 18% had no identifiable infarct on CT-scan. MCA occlusion was responsible for 62% of the large or medium-sized infarcts. ICA occlusion or severe ICA stenosis were responsible for only 27% of the large or medium-sized infarcts.

For the anterior cerebral artery, sensitivity was 13%, specificity 100%. Among all patients, sensitivity was 45%, specificity 96%. Among patients with anterior communicating artery aneurysms, sensitivity was 14%, specificity 90%. Therefore, transcranial Doppler accurately differentiates between middle cerebral arteries with and without vasospasm on angiography, but has a very low sensitivity for detecting anterior cerebral artery vasospasm and vasospasm in patients with anterior communicating artery aneurysms. Since vasospasm may involve anterior cerebral arteries while sparing middle cerebral arteries, especially after rupture of an anterior communicating artery aneurysm, caution should be exercised in using negative transcranial Doppler results to make treatment decisions based on the assumed absence of vasospasm."
CD009372,0,20450095,0,[Pitfalls in diagnosing cerebrovascular diseases using magnetic resonance angiography].,"Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) is one of the important methods for neurological imaging. Currently, time-of-flight (TOF) MRA, phase contrast (PC) MRA, and contrast-enhanced MRA are being studied for their potential for diagnosing cerebrorascular diseases. Many specific flow signal patterns and artifacts are observed on MRI. MRA has recently been developed on the basis of the studies on the MR flow phenomenon. However, flow artifacts are observed even in MRA, and most of the pitfalls associated with MRA have arisen due to the MR flow phenomenon. To avoid false-negative and false-positive results in MRA, it is very important to understand the MR flow phenomenon and flow artifacts. The purpose of this paper is to explain the MR flow phenomenon, flow artifacts, and the principle of MRA. Furthermore, the technical development of TOF MRA and the pitfalls observed while evaluating clinical cases have been discussed. This paper also clarifies MR flow artifacts and the current status of cerebral 3D TOF MRA, and explains how to avoid false negative and false positive results in MRA."

CD009372,0,23693044,0,Coil embolization of intracranial aneurysm in polyarteritis nodosa. A case report and review of the literature.,"Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) is a rare multisystem disease characterized by systemic necrotizing arteritis of small and medium size arteries. The skin, joints, kidneys, gastrointestinal tract and peripheral nerves are most commonly involved. Although aneurysms are commonly seen in the visceral vessels, intracranial aneurysms are rare with 15 reported cases. The intracranial aneurysms are usually multiple and located in supra- as well as infra-tentorial compartments. Most of the cases presented with subarachnoid or parenchymal hemorrhage. The aneurysms were usually small, although large cavernous aneurysms were reported in one case. Treatment guidelines are not clear regarding the management of these cases. Most patients were treated conservatively by medical management with surgical excision performed in only two cases and coiling done in one patient with cavernous aneurysms. Repeat hemorrhages or re-bleed in spite of medical treatment have also been reported. We describe the case of a 22-year-old woman, a known case of PAN who presented with subarachnoid hemorrhage. Cerebral angiogram showed a ruptured right middle cerebral artery bifurcation aneurysm along with unruptured left middle cerebral, right posterior communicating and left posterior inferior cerebellar artery aneurysms. Her previous abdominal angiogram had revealed multiple aneurysms in visceral arteries. Successful coil embolization of the ruptured right MCA bifurcation aneurysm was performed with preservation of the parent vessel. The patient made a complete recovery and was placed on medical treatment for PAN. Follow-up MR angiography at three months revealed stable occlusion of the embolized aneurysm with no change in the unruptured aneurysms. Although rare, PAN can be associated with intracranial aneurysms which can cause subarachnoid or parenchymal hemorrhage. Selected cases can be treated safely by coil embolization."

CD009372,0,1392244,0,Automated local maximum-intensity projection with three-dimensional vessel tracking.,"Despite the simplicity and widespread acceptance of the maximum-intensity-projection (MIP) technique for displaying three-dimensional (3D) magnetic resonance angiographic data, several disadvantages are associated with MIP as it is applied to all of the 3D data. These include elevated noise level, reduced contrast between small vessels and background tissue, and the inability to distinguish arteries from veins. The authors have developed a 3D vessel tracking method combined with a local MIP around a given vessel to complement conventional MIP and alleviate these problems. The method is referred to as a traveling MIP (TMIP). TMIP was evaluated in both patients and healthy volunteers. The results indicate that TMIP provides better contrast between vessels and background tissue, better lumen definition, and better vascular visualization than either MIP or vessel tracking alone."

CD009372,0,10360773,0,Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging: detection of ischemic injury 39 minutes after onset in a stroke patient.,A neurologist witnessed the in-hospital onset of an ischemic stroke in a 71-year-old right-handed male who suddenly developed global aphasia and right hemiplegia. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) 39 minutes after the ictus demonstrated high signals in the left internal carotid artery territory. T1- and T2-weighted images failed to detect this change. Magnetic resonance angiography showed occlusions in branches of the left anterior and middle cerebral arteries and an atheromatous stenotic lesion in the ipsilateral proximal internal carotid artery. The patient was treated with intravenous heparin and low molecular dextran solution. Repeated magnetic resonance imagings identified an infarction slightly smaller than the abnormality demonstrated by the initial DWI. DWI detects hyperacute ischemic injury within 1 hour of symptom onset in human ischemic stroke.

CD009372,0,10037831,0,[Preoperative magnetic resonance angiography findings and postoperative neurological complications in 93 cases of CABG with cardiopulmonary bypass].,"Between February 1994 and January 1997, 102 of the 146 patients treated by coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) had undergone magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the brain and neck before the operation, and arterial stenosis or occlusion had been detected in 38 (36.9%) of them. Two of these patients had complicating severe calcification of the ascending aorta, and CABG was performed without cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Seven patients without stenotic lesions on MRA were also treated by CABG without CPB for other complications. In addition to the 102 patients one patient had been found to have occlusion of the left common carotid artery and poor enhancement of the distal portion, and as a result we switched from CABG to percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTCA). We enrolled 93 patients in this study excluding these 10 patients. The patients were distributed into the three groups according to the MRA findings. Group C = no stenotic lesions (58 patients). Group S = stenosis of < 70% (26 patients), Group SS = stenosis of > or = 70% (9 patients). Enhancement distal to the stenotic or occlusive lesions was good in all patients in group S and SS. We then examined them for the incidence of postoperative neurological complications. There were no significant differences among the three groups in regard to age, male/female ratio, or incidence of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. In Group S, the incidence of diabetes was significantly higher than in the other Groups. The incidence of prior stroke was significantly higher and the number of coronary arteries affected was significantly larger in group SS than the other groups. There were no significant differences among the three groups with regard to intraoperative variables. The lowest mean arterial pressure on CPB was 44.3 +/- 7.4 mmHg, 48.0 +/- 8.8 mmHg, 46.3 +/- 7.8 mmHg in Group C, S, and SS, respectively, In all groups the lowest mean arterial pressure on CPB was below 50 mmHg. There were no significant differences among the three groups with regard to time to awaken and time to extubation. Two patients experienced transient conciousness disturbance after CABG, one in Group C, the other in Group SS, but no new lesions were detected by brain CT. Only one patient, in Group C. suffered a stroke and had a new lesion on brain CT a month after the operation. No strokes occurred in the perioperative period. In nine patients with good enhancement distal to the severe stenotic or occlusive lesion on MRA of the brain and neck the lowest mean arterial pressure on CPB was below 50 mmHg, but there was no postoperative neurological complications due to the low perfusion pressure on CPB. The results of this study suggested that CABG with CPB can be performed safely in patients with good enhancement distal to the stenotic or occlusive lesions on MRA of the brain and neck."
CD009372,0,9589619,0,Familial intracranial aneurysms.,"We describe a 53-year-old mother and a her 34-year-old son who suffered from spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and/or intracerebral hemorrhage due to a ruptured intracranial aneurysm. Diagnosis of the intracranial aneurysm was made by CT scan of the brain, and cerebral angiography. These two cases received surgical intervention and returned to their previous social activity after discharge, even though the mother had arrived in a comatose condition. The literature is reviewed and the characteristic expressions of familial intracranial aneurysms are described. The etiology of cerebral aneurysms is still uncertain but it is likely multifactorial. For the 176 patients with intracranial aneurysm(s) treated at Kaohsiung Medical College Hospital, the mean age at diagnosis was 51.9 years and these aneurysms were distributed mainly at the internal carotid artery (43.8%) and the anterior communicating artery (33.5%). The familial aneurysms tend to rupture at a younger age, occur less often at the anterior communicating artery and more often at the internal carotid artery and the middle cerebral artery as compared with that of non-familial aneurysms. In siblings, aneurysms occur at identical sites or at mirror sites and rupture within the same decade of life twice as frequently as expected in non-familial aneurysm cases. The familial aggregation of intracranial aneurysms and the above characteristic expressions suggest that heredity may play a role in some familial aneurysms. The pattern of inheritance, however, has not been established. Screening examinations and the treatment of unruptured intracranial aneurysms in asymptomatic relatives of the familial cases are also discussed."
CD009372,0,15782005,0,Incomplete oculomotor nerve palsy caused by an unruptured internal carotid-anterior choroidal artery aneurysm--case report--.,"A 59-year-old woman visited our institute with the chief complaint of dizziness which persisted whenever she tried to focus on objects. She had not experienced apparent double vision and had no history of intracranial bleeding. Neurological examination revealed no abnormality except for exotropia at the mid-position and at upper gaze. Cerebral angiography revealed that the intracranial portion of the left internal carotid artery ran more horizontally and also identified an unruptured left internal carotid-anterior choroidal artery (IC-AChA) aneurysm of 3.0 mm diameter. The aneurysm at the origin of the AChA was confirmed during surgery. The proximal lateral wall of the aneurysm was in contact with the oculomotor nerve. This contact was released after complete obliteration of the aneurysm. The exotropia resolved 3 months later. Oculomotor nerve palsy usually indicates the presence of internal carotid-posterior communicating artery (IC-PcomA) aneurysm. Since sacrifice of the AChA will result in severe neurological deficits, accurate neuroimaging information is needed prior to the operation. Conventional angiography and/or three-dimensional computed tomography angiography should be performed to ascertain whether the aneurysm is an IC-PcomA or IC-AChA aneurysm, even if some neurosurgeons insist that conventional angiography is not always needed before surgery for an unruptured aneurysm."

CD009372,0,23001815,0,Advanced neuroimaging to guide acute stroke therapy.,"Traditionally non-contrast CT has been considered the first choice imaging modality for acute stroke. Acute ischemic stroke patients presenting to the hospital within 3-hours from symptom onset and without any visible hemorrhages or large lesions on CT images are considered optimum reperfusion therapy candidates. However, non-contrast CT alone has been unable to identify best reperfusion therapy candidates outside this window. New advanced imaging techniques are now being used successfully for this purpose. Non-invasive CT or MR angiography images can be obtained during initial imaging evaluation for identification and characterization of vascular lesions, including occlusions, aneurysms, and malformations. Either CT-based perfusion imaging or MRI-based diffusion and perfusion imaging performed immediately upon arrival of a patient to the hospital helps estimate the extent of fixed core and penumbra in ischemic lesions. Patients having occlusive lesions with small fixed cores and large penumbra are preferred reperfusion therapy candidates."
CD009372,0,9394867,0,Magnetic resonance techniques in the evaluation of the newborn brain.,"MR imaging provides unequaled sensitivity as compared with US or CT scanning for evaluating developmental changes and pathologic processes in the newborn brain. Myelination can be assessed qualitatively and quantitatively using newer 3D-MR imaging methods. MR imaging provides a much clearer delineation of many developmental disorders, including anomalies of migration and organization, as well as a variety of metabolic disorders and congenital infections. Neonatal intracranial hemorrhage is detected in all its locations by MR imaging. The timing of the hemorrhage is a unique feature of MR imaging. Venous thrombosis also can be identified by MR imaging and confirmed with MR angiography. HIE is the major cause of potentially preventable or reversible brain injury that results in considerable long-term neurologic morbidity. Early detection is crucial for interventions aimed at preventing or reversing ongoing injury. DWI can show early changes at the cellular level that are not detectable by any other imaging modality. MR spectroscopy has further opened the possibility of studying the metabolic mechanisms that define the pathophysiologic events taking place in neonatal brain injury. Both 31P-MR spectroscopy, as a marker of the acute changes in energy metabolism, and 1H-MR spectroscopy, with the measurement of lactate and the excitotoxic aminoacids glutamate and glutamine, have enabled us to study the early and late effects of insults to the newborn brain in a noninvasive fashion. Studies performed to determine the predictive value of MR spectroscopy for later neurodevelopmental outcome after HIE have shown promising results but need further evaluation on larger patient samples. The potential use of these methods in the evaluation of early neuroprotective treatment regimens in the newborn remains to be determined."

In 19 patients, LAA was larger than LDA beyond the vascular territory. Brain angiogram showed either obstruction or stenosis of the major arteries in as many as 59 percentages of this discrepancy group. In many patients of this group, cortical neurological symptoms were observed. In 37 patients in which the size of LAA was equal to that of LDA, abnormality of the major arteries was observed in only 7 percentages. These results indicated that the discrepancy mainly reflected the infarction due to irreversible ischemic change of perforate artery with the cortical low perfusion caused by the major artery disease.

TCH is a rare manifestation in cerebral or cerebellar infarctions. Herein, we report on a 60-year-old woman with a thunderclap headache as the first symptom of cerebellar infarction, in the absence of abnormal findings in the brain computed tomography (CT), CT angiography, and lumbar puncture. An urgent brain MRI showed an acute infarction of the right cerebellar hemisphere. The next day, the patient presented with right side ataxia.

CD009372,0,22721822,0,Multistage indocyanine green videoangiography for the convexity dural arteriovenous fistula with angiographically occult pial fistula.,"Recently, intraoperative indocyanine green (ICG) videoangiography has become a common technique for treating cerebrovascular diseases. We report a case of dural arteriovenous fistula (AVF) treated with direct surgery using intraoperative ICG videoangiography. A 41-year-old man with right hemiplegia caused by a left subcortical hemorrhage was transferred to our hospital. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) revealed a left convexity parasagittal dural AVF. Surgical resection of the dural AVF was performed using step-by-step ICG videoangiography 4 times in each dissection procedure, which precisely delineated the structure of the dural AVF. After a circular incision of the dura around the fistular point, repeated ICG videoangiography identified the residual fistula between the pial artery from the middle cerebral artery and the draining vein. Complete disappearance of the AVF was confirmed by ICG videoangiography after this pial fistula was removed. Postoperative DSA revealed no residual AVF. Accurate detection of all fistular points and complete resection, including the dura mater and pial vessels, are necessary to avoid rebleeding caused by the residual dural AVF due to incomplete obliteration of the fistular points. Intraoperative ICG videoangiography could provide information on angiographically occult vascular malformation, such as pial fistulas, that cannot be detected by preoperative DSA. Our findings suggest that multistage intraoperative ICG videoangiography can be quite useful for complete resection of a dural AVF with angiographically occult pial fistula."

In this paper, we introduce a new framework to automatically outline patterns of abnormal perfusion in individual patients by means of an ASL template. We compare two models of normal perfusion and assess the quality of detections comparing an a contrario approach to the generalized linear model (GLM)."

Magnetic resonance angiography and other tests have made diagnosis easier and safer, particularly in very young children and in patients with sickle cell disease. Transcranial Doppler examination makes it possible to accurately predict without angiography which patients with sickle cell disease are at most risk for stroke. Many patients with mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episodes (MELAS) syndrome have a specific mutation of the mitochondrial DNA, and soon the recently devised diagnostic criteria for MELAS syndrome may be replaced by molecular markers. There are many causes of cerebrovascular disease in children, and a thorough evaluation will discover a likely cause in about two thirds of the patients. Recent attention has focused on the HLA-B51 antigen and chicken pox as possible risk factors.

CD009372,0,11452855,1,Our own experience with CT angiography in early diagnosis of cerebral vascular malformations.,"Computed tomography (CT) and intraarterial cerebral angiography are essential methods in early diagnosis of cerebral vascular malformations. In recent years however non-invasive or minimally invasive methods like MR angiography and CT angiography (CTA), which could potentially replace angiography, have been developed. The aim of presented study is to demonstrate our own experience in application of CTA in early diagnosis of cerebral vascular malformations. The material consists of 86 CTA examinations performed shortly after non-traumatic intracranial haemorrhage. Angiographic correlation has been available in 23 patients and surgical one--in 31 cases. CTA studies began with serio-CT to select the optimal time between contrast injection and CT scanning. After that 100-120 ml of non-ionic contrast medium was injected intravenously (5 ml per sec.) and spiral CT acqusition was performed with the delay calculated on the basis of the serio-CT. The obtained images were postprocessed on the workstation using always MIP and in many cases also SSD and VRT reconstructions. Vascular malformations have been diagnosed in 44 of 86 CTA studies including 38 patients with aneurysms (total number 51) and 6 patients with AVMs. In 17 cases the diameter of the aneurysm did not exceed 5 mm. In all surgical cases the CTA diagnosis of the aneurysm has been confirmed. There was however one false-negative case. On the other hand in 7 patients CTA revealed the small aneurysm, despite unclear angiographic appearance. In 2 of 6 patients with CTA suspicion of AVM this diagnosis has been excluded either by angiography or surgery. Comparison of CTA and angiography in 22 aneurysms showed in 17 cases superiority of CTA in evaluation of aneurysmal neck and the relationship between aneurysm and adjacent vessels (especially with VRT and SSD reconstructions). In patients with AVMs however the evaluation of supplying and draining vessels was better with angiography. On the base of our material we can conclude that CTA is very efficient in detecting and evaluating the aneurysms. We believe that CTA can replace angiography if it reveals aneurysm in a site corresponding with location of haemorrhage on CT. In patients with suspicion of AVM value of CTA is doubtful and angiography remains the method of choice."
CD009372,0,15798609,0,[Dynamic MRA in the evaluation of intracranial vascular diseases].,"Conventional catheter angiography (CCA) remains the gold standard for the evaluation of most intracranial vascular malformations. MRA techniques such as Time of Flight, Phase Contrast or 3D contrast-enhanced MRA, provide anatomic evaluation but without hemodynamic information. Recently developed, dynamic MRA is based on dynamic acquisition of images and image subtraction; these two principal characteristics produce images comparable to those obtained by CCA. The purpose of this review is to explain the principles, advantages and drawbacks of this technique in the evaluation of arteriovenous malformations, arteriovenous fistulas, aneurysms and venous thrombosis."

CD009372,0,11740001,0,Peripheral hemodialysis shunt with intracranial venous congestion.,"Intracranial venous congestion is often caused by local venous thrombosis or brain arteriovenous fistulas. Hemodialysis shunts are known to cause venous enlargement in the arm or chest but have not been related to intracranial vascular pathology. Case Description- A 59-year-old woman who presented with increasing headache, gait instability, and memory loss was a renal transplant recipient who still carried a left upper arm shunt. Cranial CT scan showed enlarged veins in the posterior fossa with incipient hydrocephalus. Extracranial duplex sonography revealed reversed flow in the left internal jugular vein, which normalized on cuff inflation around the shunt-carrying arm. The reversed flow, intracranial venous congestion, and neurological status improved after surgical shunt ligation."
CD009372,0,8851433,0,Quantitative MR imaging of children with sickle cell disease: striking T1 elevation in the thalamus.,"Nineteen patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) were examined with conventional MR imaging (cMRI), including T1- and T2-weighted sequences and MR angiography (MRA). qMRI mapping of T1 was also done using a precise and accurate inversion-recovery (PAIR) technique optimized and validated previously. In addition, 21 healthy African-American control subjects had the qMRI examination. Nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance of control subjects, of SCD patients without stroke, and of SCD patients with stroke showed that T1 increased with disease severity in the thalamus, frontal white matter, genu, and occipital white matter. T1 was significantly longer in SCD patients without stroke (n = 13) than in control subjects (n = 21) in the thalamus and frontal white matter. In addition, T1 values were significantly longer in SCD patients with stroke than in patients without stroke in the genu and frontal white matter. Abnormality of the thalamus was identified by qMRI in a substantial fraction of patients read as normal by both cMRI and MRA, suggesting that it may be possible to use T1 elevation to identify a subset of patients with SCD who are at elevated risk for stroke."

CD009372,0,2164304,0,[Surgical treatment of multiple arterial aneurysms of the brain].,"On the basis of analysis of 83 cases with multiple arterial aneurysms of the brain, the authors arrived at the following conclusions. The frequency of their recognition is 10.3% and is directly dependent on the completeness and thoroughness of the angiographic examination. Recurrent hemorrhages in multiple aneurysms occur mostly from one and the same aneurysm (85.3%) and in rare cases form different aneurysms (14.7%). With the use of a diagnostic complex (cerebral angiography, EEG, CT, careful study of the medical history and the clinical picture of the disease) the aneurysm which is the source of the intracranial bleeding can be identified in most cases (93%), which is important in planning the tactics of surgical treatment. Exclusion of all aneurysms, in one stage if possible, is the main principle of surgical management of multiple aneurysms. The aneurysm which caused the intracranial bleeding should be excluded first. The development of surgical approaches to the aneurysms and the use of microsurgery made it possible to achieve definite successes in surgery of multiple aneurysms. Postoperative lethality was 2.7%. Most of the patients (84.7%) are capable of working or are adapted to every-day life."

Cohorts of mildly cognitively impaired (MCI) elderly (n = 73) and cognitively normal participants (n = 33) have been serially evaluated for up to 50 months. SWI phase values (putative iron levels) in 14 brain regions were measured and the number of BMB were counted for each SWI study. SWI phase values showed a left putaminal mean increase of iron (decrease of phase values) over the study duration in 27 participants who progressed to dementia compared to Normals (p = 0.035) and stable MCI (p = 0.01). BMB were detected in 9 out of 26 (38%) MCI participants who progressed to dementia and are a significant risk factor for cognitive failure in MCI participants [risk ratio = 2.06 (95% confidence interval 1.37-3.12)]. SWI is useful to measure regional iron changes and presence of BMB, both of which may be important MR-based biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases."
CD009372,0,21982268,0,Dolichoectasic anterior cerebral artery and hemodynamics.,"Dolichoectasia of the intracranial arteries is a rare condition, and the vertebrobasilar system and the internal carotid artery are the most commonly involved structures. We report a rare case of idiopathic dolichoectasia of the anterior cerebral artery in a 22-year-old female. The patient caused an automobile accident and was brought to our hospital in an ambulance. A computed tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging revealed no fresh lesions, but showed a prominent serpentine structure with calcification and flow void in the region of the interhemispheric fissure, which was suspicious for arteriovenous malformation or arteriovenous fistula. Cerebral angiography demonstrated extensive dilatation of the anterior cerebral artery, but no evidence of arteriovenous malformation or arteriovenous fistula. Single photon emission computed tomography revealed hypoperfusion of the right frontal lobe at rest. Electroencephalography showed no epileptic discharge. The patient's course was uneventful, and she was discharged with no neurologic deficit. There are few reports of hemodynamic changes in cases of dolichoectasia. In the diagnosis of cerebral dolichoectasia, cerebral hemodynamics should be examined carefully in addition to evaluating vascular disease by angiography."
CD009372,0,1468873,0,Intracranial magnetic resonance imaging.,"Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) is currently being incorporated into the routine MR evaluations of patients with suspected cerebrovascular disease. Currently, MRA serves as a useful adjunct to routine parenchymal spin-echo imaging of the head. Intracranial MRA is predominantly used as a screening test for cerebrovascular disease in situations where the clinical suspicion and/or the patient's physical condition does not warrant a conventional arteriogram. Clinical experience to date suggests that MRA can play a significant role in the evaluation of patients with suspected intracranial aneurysms, arteriovenous fistulae, large vessel occlusive disease, and dural sinus occlusion/thrombosis. MRA has not yet reached the point where it can replace conventional catheter angiography. This is most apparent when trying to evaluate 1) larger vessels which are typically difficult to visualize due to higher order motion terms (eg, carotid siphon); 2) the smaller cortical branches with relatively slow flow that would be necessary to see in patients with suspected vasculitis; and 3) any situation in which dynamic information is important such as with mass lesions or vascular malformations. These limitations must be taken into account when deciding on the appropriate imaging study for an individual patient. Large-scale, well-controlled prospective clinical trials will ultimately determine the role intracranial MRA will play in the evaluation of patients with suspected cerebrovascular disease."

CD009372,0,1730952,0,"Lobar intracerebral hemorrhage. A clinical, radiographic, and pathological study of 29 consecutive operated cases with negative angiography.","The authors operated consecutively on 50 patients with lobar intracerebral hemorrhage during a prospectively designed study period from January, 1986, to March, 1990. They investigated the correlations between the underlying causes and the clinicoradiographic features in 29 patients who showed no angiographic vascular abnormalities, in order to elucidate the operative indication for such cases. Patients with ruptured saccular aneurysm or trauma were not included in this study. There were 15 males and 14 females, ranging in age from 7 to 76 years (mean 52.4 years). Histological diagnoses of the surgical specimens were as follows: vascular malformation in nine cases (arteriovenous malformation (AVM) in six and cavernous malformation in three), microaneurysm in 11, cerebral amyloid angiopathy in six, and brain tumor in two; in the remaining case the cause was not verified histologically. The underlying cause was determined in 96.5% of cases. The mean patient age was lowest in the cavernous malformation group (27.0 years), followed by the AVM (45.8 years), microaneurysm (59.8 years), and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (70.0 years) groups. Four patients with vascular malformation (three AVM's and one cavernous malformation) had previous episodes of bleeding at the same site, whereas none of those with microaneurysms or cerebral amyloid angiopathy had such episodes. On computerized tomography (CT) scans, the round to oval hematoma was related to the presence of an AVM or cavernous malformation in contrast to microaneurysms and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Upon infusion of contrast material, variable enhancement was seen in five (two AVM's and three cavernous malformations) of the nine vascular malformations while no enhancement was noted in any patient with microaneurysm or cerebral amyloid angiopathy at the acute stage. Subarachnoid extension of the hematoma was associated with cerebral amyloid angiopathy significantly more frequently than with AVM's (p less than 0.05) and microaneurysms (p less than 0.01). The results suggest that clinicoradiographic pictures in cases with negative angiography are quite different among the three major pathological categories; namely, vascular malformation (AVM and cavernous malformation), microaneurysm, and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. It is suggested that the underlying etiology of a given lobar intracerebral hemorrhage with negative angiography may be predicted by a combination of patient age, history of previous bleeding at the same site, hematoma shape, and subarachnoid extension of the hematoma on CT scans. Based upon these findings, the authors discuss operative indications for such cases."

CD009372,0,1538280,0,Stroke in a cohort of patients with homozygous sickle cell disease.,"Strokes occurred in 17 of 310 children with homozygous sickle cell disease who were followed from birth, representing an incidence of 7.8% by the age of 14 years. Two children had subarachnoid hemorrhage, one having resolution of symptoms after aneurysm surgery and another dying of a presumed second hemorrhage 14 days later. The remaining 15 strokes were presumed to be cerebral infarction, although autopsy, angiographic, or computed tomographic evidence was available in only 8 children. There were 6 deaths, 2 in the acute event and 4 after recurrence, which occurred in 6 (46%) of 13 patients who survived the initial episode. There were 10 recurrent episodes at a median interval of 9 months after the initial event. Steady-state hematologic data revealed significantly higher leukocyte counts than in control subjects without strokes at age 1 year and in the last study preceding the stroke. The initial stroke coincided with an acutely lowered hemoglobin value in 5 patients (3 aplastic crises, 1 acute splenic sequestration, 1 probable pulmonary sequestration) and with painful crises in another 7 patients. We conclude that a high leukocyte count and an acute decrease of hemoglobin are risk factors for stroke in patients with homozygous sickle cell disease."

CD009372,0,9186035,0,Magnetic resonance angiography in children.,"MRA in children utilizes the same pulse sequences used in adults, but for investigation of the differing forms of vascular pathology found in the pediatric population. Because of the extreme sensitivity of MRA to motion artifact, sedation is an important adjunct to the performance of diagnostic MRI and MRA in children. Because of the noninvasive nature of MRA, strictly diagnostic conventional angiography in children is uncommonly performed and frequently directed toward investigation and therapy of intracranial vascular malformations. Common indications for MRA in children include sickle cell vasculopathy, cerebral and posterior fossa infarction, tumors, vascular malformations, and follow-up of patients recently on extra corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Non-invasive follow-up subsequent to surgical or medical therapy of intra or extra cranial vascular pathology is another important use for MRA in children."

Postangiography headache developed in 15 (33%) patients, 125 +/- 99 min after the completion of the study. It was unilateral in nine (60%) patients, homolateral to the usual side of migraine headache in two or three migraineurs, and pulsating in six (40%). Nausea, vomiting, photophobia, and phonophobia accompanied postangiography headache in 20%, 7%, 33%, and 20% respectively. Postangiography headache fulfilled the International Headache Society criteria for migraine without aura (except for the number of attacks) in 27% of patients. Patients with and those without postangiography headache were comparable in mean age, sex, and indication for angiography. Fifty-three percent (8/15) of patients with postangiography headache and 23% (7/30) of the non postangiography headache group reported prior recurrent headaches (P = 0.047, likelihood ratio chi-square).

CD009372,0,1997899,0,Emergent aneurysm surgery without cerebral angiography for the comatose patient.,"Neurologically based clinical grading scales offer excellent prognostic information for the patient suffering diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). These grading scales are less applicable to patients with life-threatening intraparenchymal hematomas after aneurysmal rupture. During the last 3 years, four patients in a comatose state with brain stem compression syndromes documented by computed tomographic scans have undergone emergent operation in our neurosurgical service. Each patient was so critically ill that we believed it unwise to delay craniotomy for diagnostic angiography. The average delay from the onset of coma to skin incision was 3.02 hours (range, 1.67-6.5 hours), and the average delay from arrival in our unit until skin incision was 1.8 hours (range, 0.75-2.5 hours). The condition of two arousable patients deteriorated while they were in the emergency room, presumably from new bleeding. Each patient underwent craniotomy for hematoma evacuation, definitive aneurysm clipping, and lobectomy for decompression. Temporary clipping was employed in one patient, and intraoperative rupture occurred in two others. Three patients survived but retain significant disability. Emergent craniotomy with empiric exploration of appropriate subarachnoid cisterns after hematoma decompression may be life-saving in some cases. The delay imposed for diagnostic angiography may be avoided in attempts to save vital minutes of severe brain stem compression."

CD009372,0,8519603,0,Diffusion and perfusion MR imaging of cerebral ischemia.,"Over the last few years, diffusion and perfusion magnetic resonance (MR) imaging methods have found increasing user for monitoring the effects of cerebral ischemia under clinical and experimental conditions. Blood perfusion can be visualized by studying the patency of the cerebrovascular bed (MR angiography), by recording exchange of diffusible tracers between blood and brain ([2H]water or [19F]trifluoromethane clearance), or by measuring the volume and transit time of the circulating blood (bolus track or spin-tagging imaging). In addition, changes in blood oxygenation level can be visualized by taking advantage of the susceptibility changes of the magnetic field homogeneity (functional or blood-oxygenation-level-dependent imaging). Diffusion imaging is based on the modulation of signal intensity by brain water diffusion. Recording a series of diffusion-weighted images allows calculation of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and the reconstruction of quantitative ADC images. Brain ADC changes are a function of intra-extracellular water homeostasis and therefore are a sensitive marker of ionic equilibrium. Since disturbances of ion and water homeostasis are among the first pathological alterations induced by brain ischemia, diffusion imaging is able to detect the incipient injury within minutes. Conversely, the reversal of these alterations is able to detect the incipient injury within minutes. Conversely, the reversal of these alterations is an early and reliable predictor of postischemic recovery. Applications of perfusion and diffusion imaging are reviewed in relation to the pathophysiology, the pathobiochemistry, and the therapy of evolving brain infarct after focal ischemia and the manifestation and reversal of ischemic injury during and after global ischemia."
CD009372,0,15257380,0,[Multimodal computed tomography in acute cerebral infarction. Experience with a standardized protocol in 100 patients].,"Computed tomography (CT) is the standard method of brain imaging in acute stroke. To an experienced examiner, nonenhanced CT will exclude hemorrhage and may indicate early ischemic signs. Reliable description of an ischemic area and the underlying vascular disease is not possible in the acute phase but is possible, particularly within the first hours, when therapeutic decisions on matters such as systemic thrombolysis are to be made. For such rapid decision-making, imaging must provide more information. Novel, contrast-enhanced CT techniques can provide this information. Perfusion CT (CTP) can show brain perfusion, allowing one to distinguish between reversible and irreversible damage in an ischemic area. Also, CT angiography (CTA) can detect occlusion or stenosis in the relevant vasculature. Using a modern, multislice CT scanner, it is now possible to combine these modalities of imaging. In a fast protocol for emergency evaluation, all three methods can be performed and evaluated to provide the crucial information within 15 min. In the first 102 patients examined within 6 h of symptom onset using this protocol, multimodal CT contributed substantially to therapeutic decisions, even though there are some limitations in these methods."

FMD affects the proximal one-third of the internal carotid artery in almost all cases and is bilateral in 60% to 85%, with middle-aged women affected in 85% of the cases. Ischaemic stroke has been postulated to result from severe stenosis or thrombotic occlusion at the FMD site. Cerebral embolism from FMD has rarely been reported. We report 3 young patients with acute ischaemic stroke who had FMD on cerebral angiography. They presented with a focal hemispheric stroke where the probable pathophysiology is embolism to the distal internal carotid artery from thrombus formed at the proximal FMD site. The patients were all males, with unilateral proximal internal carotid artery FMD lesions and occlusion of the internal carotid artery distally on the same side.

CT scans 4 days after the operation showed infarctions of the distribution of the bilateral cerebral hemispheres. Cerebral angiography on the 11th hospital day demonstrated narrowing of the extracranial internal carotid artery at C1-C2 vertebral levels. Slight arterial dilatation and retention of the contrast medium were found just above the narrowing segment, which was suspected to be a pseudolumen. Three D time-of flight MRA showed an intramural hematoma corresponding to the narrowing on the angiography. Original axial MRA images showed that narrowing of the lumen was surrounded by a crescent hematoma and that two flow velocity areas were in the area distal to the narrowing. High flow seemed to be ordinary artery flow rate. The low flow area, including turbulent flow, led to the retention of contrast medium mimicking a pseudolumen. Precise MRA imaging will bring us an accurate diagnosis of extracranial carotid dissections."

There were 118 patients with an initial major hemispheric syndrome; 14 patients (12%) had SSD. All but one SSD patient met criteria for cardiogenic brain embolism. Angiographic examination within 24 hours after stroke onset demonstrated that the occlusion sites in SSD differed from those in non-SSD and suggested that rapid embolus migration had occurred in all SSD patients but in only five of 39 non-SSD. Infarcts in SSD were smaller and often scattered over the cortices and deeper structures. Hemorrhagic transformation was less frequent in SSD. In patients with a potential cardiac source of emboli, SSD was more likely to occur in nondiabetic men less than 60 years of age."

The clinician is thus faced with a variety of tests, each with different cost implications and each altering management to a greater or lesser extent. This review will concentrate on the basic tests which should be performed for all strokes (full blood count, ESR, biochemical screen, blood glucose, cholesterol, syphilis serology, chest X-ray and electrocardiogram). Additional tests may be required in selected cases: CT scan to diagnose 'non-stroke' lesions, to exclude cerebral haemorrhage if anti-haemostatic therapy is planned, and to detect strokes which may require emergency intervention (such as cerebellar stroke with hydrocephalus); echocardiography to detect cardiac sources of emboli; and in a few cases lumbar puncture and specialized haematological tests. Other tests, which are currently research tools, may be suitable for widespread use in the future including NMR, SPECT and PET scanning."

Initial CT scan showed ventricular hematomas resulting in acute hydrocephalus, but no obvious parenchymal or subarachnoid hemorrhage. Ventricular drainage was carried out. Subsequently, cerebral angiography was performed, but neither, an aneurysm nor other vascular abnormality was detected. 50 days after admission, MRI revealed a homogenous and well-circumscribed hypointense mass (12 mm in diameter) in the right cerebellar tonsil, suggesting the presence of hemosiderin. 60 days after the onset, the second angiography showed an aneurysmal shadow arising from the distal part of the PICA. An aneurysmal clipping was performed via the suboccipital approach. A thrombosed aneurysm was identified in the right tonsil. At the time of the operation, we confirmed that the part of the PICA around the aneurysm was intact with neither branching nor discoloration.

CD009372,0,7753413,0,Evaluation of cerebral vasospasm in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage using single photon emission computed tomography.,"Cerebral vasospasm (CVS) occurs as a result of the breakdown in cerebral autoregulation mechanisms. Because cerebral vasospasm can occur after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), it is important to evaluate borderline perfusion. Evaluation of borderline vascular insufficiency is important to reduce ischemic complications. In this study 25 patients with SAH were investigated by somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP), computed tomography (CT), digital subtraction angiography (DSA) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in order to predict borderline ischemic areas. Clinical grades were also correlated with these investigations. Thirteen patients had symptomatic vasospasm and 15 patients had angiographic vasospasm. SPECT showed hypoperfusion in 22 out of 25 patients. CT predicted CVS in 8 of these 22 patients. Our study shows that brain perfusion SPECT is a non-traumatic, non-invasive, non-allergic, inexpensive method for the prediction of cerebral vasospasm. We conclude that brain SPECT with Tc-99m HM-PAO is an accessible technique that can demonstrate varying degrees of regional tissue hypoperfusion in patients with delayed ischemic deficits due to CVS following SAH."

CD009372,0,1564343,0,[Valve replacement in a patient with infective endocarditis and ruptured mycotic cerebral aneurysm].,"A 55-year-old man with a mild fever and sweating developed severe headache for the days before admission. Cerebral computed tomography and selected cerebral angiography on the day of admission revealed subarachnoid hemorrhage due to rupture of an aneurysm of a distal branch of the left middle cerebral artery. Detection of vegetation on the aortic valve by two dimensional echocardiography confirmed the diagnosis of infective endocarditis with a ruptured mycotic cerebral aneurysm. Because of rapid growth of the vegetation on the aortic valve and progression of heart failure despite antibiotic therapy, emergency cardiac surgery was performed. To prevent re-rupture of the aneurysm, the aortic valve was replaced with a bioprosthetic valve, and no anticoagulant was administered postoperatively. Repeated cerebral angiography revealed that the aneurysm was becoming progressively smaller during the next 9 months. No cerebrovascular accident occurred postoperatively. We believe that it is safe to treat a ruptured mycotic cerebral aneurysm without involvement of a hematoma mass in the brain conservatively, and that use of a bioprosthetic valve, if valve replacement is mandatory, and avoidance of anticoagulant therapy during the postoperative period are advisable in the treatment of a patient with infective endocarditis and a ruptured cerebral mycotic aneurysm."

Among those, circumscribed SAHs along the cortical convexity are rare and have only been described in singular case reports so far. Here, we present a collection of 12 cases of SAH along the convexity, of non-traumatic origin. Over a period of 10 years, 12 cases of circumscribed SAH along the convexity were identified at our clinic. The clinical presentations, neuroradiological SAH characteristics, further diagnostic work-up to identify the underlying aetiologies, the therapy and clinical outcome were analysed. The patients' chief complaints were unspecific cephalgia, focal or generalised seizures and focal neurological deficits. Typical signs of basal SAH, such as nuchal rigidity, thunderclap-headache or alteration of consciousness, were rare. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and digital subtraction angiography (DSA) revealed different aetiologies, namely postpartal posterior encephalopathy (three), cerebral vasculitis (two), dural sinus thrombosis (two), cortical venous thrombosis (one), intracerebral abscesses (one) and cerebral cavernoma (one). Two cases remained unresolved. Treatment of the underlying disease and symptomatic medication led to good clinical outcome in almost all cases. On the basis of these findings, we demonstrate that the clinical presentation, localisation and aetiology of cortical SAH differ clearly from other SAHs. A diagnostic work-up with MRI and eventually DSA is essential. Mostly, the causative disease can be identified, and specific treatment allows a favourable outcome."

CD009372,0,7425568,0,Lobar cerebral hemorrhages: acute clinical syndromes in 26 cases.,"The acute syndromes and CT findings are described in 26 cases of spontaneous cerebral hemorrhage. Occipital hemorrhage (11 cases) caused severe pain around the ipsilateral eye and dense hemianopia. Left temporal hemorrhage (7 cases) began with mild pain in or just anterior to the ear, fluent dysphasia with poor auditory comprehension but relatively good repetition, and a visual deficit subtending less than a hemianopia. Frontal hemorrhage (4 cases) caused a distinctive syndrome beginning with severe contralateral arm weakness, minimal leg and face weakness, and frontal headache. Parietal hemorrhage (3 cases) began with anterior temporal (""temple"") headache and hemisensory deficit, sometimes involving the trunk to the midline. One patient had a right temporal hemorrhage. Spontaneous lobar hemorrhage and branch artery embolism in the same region produce similar clinical syndromes. Headache is a first and prominent symptom. A rapid but not instantaneous onset over several minutes, when combined with one of the typical syndromes, suggests lobar hemorrhage rather than other types of stroke. Ancillary investigations (including CT scanning, angiography in 11 patients, and autopsy in 4) disclosed 2 patients with bleeding diatheses due to warfarin, 2 with arteriovenous malformations, and 1 with metastatic tumor. Only 8 of the 26 patients had chronic hypertension (blood pressure greater than 130/85 mm Hg), suggesting that hypertension is not an etiological factor in most lobar hemorrhages."

Neurological examination on admission revealed no abnormalities. Computed tomography showed subarachnoid hemorrhage of the interhemispheric fissure and intraparenchymal hematoma of the left cingulate gyrus. Magnetic resonance and cerebral angiography revealed a saccular aneurysm of the distal portion of the accessory ACA classified as the bihemispheric type. Neck clipping of the aneurysm was performed via an interhemispheric approach 17 days after symptom onset. The patient made a good postoperative recovery without neurological deficit. Distal accessory ACA aneurysms tend to arise from the first bifurcation and supply parietal branches. The aneurysms tend to occur on the bihemispheric type of distal accessory ACA.

CD009372,0,12956271,0,Measuring tortuosity of the intracerebral vasculature from MRA images.,"The clinical recognition of abnormal vascular tortuosity, or excessive bending, twisting, and winding, is important to the diagnosis of many diseases. Automated detection and quantitation of abnormal vascular tortuosity from three-dimensional (3-D) medical image data would, therefore, be of value. However, previous research has centered primarily upon two-dimensional (2-D) analysis of the special subset of vessels whose paths are normally close to straight. This report provides the first 3-D tortuosity analysis of clusters of vessels within the normally tortuous intracerebral circulation. We define three different clinical patterns of abnormal tortuosity. We extend into 3-D two tortuosity metrics previously reported as useful in analyzing 2-D images and describe a new metric that incorporates counts of minima of total curvature. We extract vessels from MRA data, map corresponding anatomical regions between sets of normal patients and patients with known pathology, and evaluate the three tortuosity metrics for ability to detect each type of abnormality within the region of interest. We conclude that the new tortuosity metric appears to be the most effective in detecting several types of abnormalities. However, one of the other metrics, based on a sum of curvature magnitudes, may be more effective in recognizing tightly coiled, ""corkscrew"" vessels associated with malignant tumors."

CD009372,0,22377893,0,Venous ischemic syndromes.,"Venous ischemic syndromes represent a rare type of cerebrovascular disease that more commonly affects young women. Because of the remarkable variability of clinical presentations and neuroimaging signs, these syndromes represent an important clinical challenge. The most common clinical presentations include headache, seizures, focal neurological deficits, altered consciousness, and papilledema, which can present in isolation or in association with other symptoms. According to the grouping of symptoms and signs, four main patterns have been identified: isolated intracranial hypertension, focal syndrome, cavernous sinus syndrome, and subacute encephalopathy. CT scan is commonly performed as the first-line diagnostic test, in most cases showing indirect signs such as cerebral edema, ischemic or hemorrhagic lesions, or signs of venous stasis. The most accurate diagnostic techniques to objectively confirm the diagnosis include magnetic resonance angiography and computed tomography angiography. Clinical presentations and neuroimaging signs are important predictors of outcome following venous ischemic syndromes. Coma, epileptic seizures and intracranial hemorrhage were shown, among others, to be independent predictors of poor outcome."

Plain CT scan of brain confirmed the diagnosis of SAH in all the 20 (100%) cases, but was able to demonstrate the cause of SAH in 11(55%) cases only. Contrast CT scan provided additional information in 7 more cases. CT was also able to demonstrate the site and extent of bleeding, evidence of intraventricular bleeding and hydrocephalus. Cerebral angiography done in all the cases, confirmed the diagnosis in 14 (70%) cases diagnosed on CT and was able to give additional information in 4 more cases. It also showed excellent vascular details which were not possible with CT scan. It is concluded that enhanced CT scan should be done first in all the cases of SAH for preliminary scouting and angiography should be done where CT scan gives incomplete information or where surgical management is contemplated. Both the investigations were found to be complementary to each other."

Later, 4D magnetic resonance (MR) angiography emerged beginning with techniques like Keyhole and time-resolved imaging of contrast kinetics (TRICKS) that provided frame rates of one every 5 seconds with limited spatial resolution. Undersampled radial acquisition was subsequently developed. The 3D vastly undersampled isotropic projection (VIPR) technique allowed undersampling factors of 30-40. Its combination with phase contrast displays time-resolved flow dynamics within the cardiac cycle and has enabled the measurement of pressure gradients in small vessels. Meanwhile similar accelerations were achieved using Cartesian acquisition with projection reconstruction (CAPR), a Cartesian acquisition with 2D parallel imaging. Further acceleration is provided by constrained reconstruction techniques such as highly constrained back-projection reconstruction (HYPR) and its derivatives, which permit acceleration factors approaching 1000. Hybrid MRA combines a separate phase contrast, time-of flight, or contrast-enhanced acquisition to constrain the reconstruction of contrast-enhanced time frames providing exceptional spatial and temporal resolution and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). This can be extended to x-ray imaging where a 3D DSA examination can be used to constrain the reconstruction of time-resolved 3D volumes. Each 4D DSA (time-resolved 3D DSA) frame provides spatial resolution and SNR comparable to 3D DSA, thus removing a major limitation of intravenous DSA. Similar techniques have provided the ability to do 4D fluoroscopy."

CD009372,0,2031790,0,Radiologic manifestations of focal cerebral hyperemia in acute stroke.,In 16 acute stroke patients with focal cerebral hyperemia angiography and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) were studied 1 to 4 days post stroke. CT was performed twice with and without contrast enhancement 3 +/- 1 days and 16 +/- 4 days post stroke. Angiographic evidence of focal cerebral hyperemia was seen in 8 patients in the form of early filling veins. In 5 of these the hyperemic areas were located within infarcted areas and in 3 patients in areas which appeared normal on CT. In the remaining 8 patients the hyperemias were located perifocally around ischemic infarcts. Early filling veins were not seen in this type of hyperemia. The blood flow was higher and the transit time of the contrast medium was faster in the former type of hyperemia probably because of arteriovenous shunting. Contrast enhancement was not observed on the early CT but was typically seen in the infarcts on the late CT at a time when the hyperemic state is known to have vanished. It is concluded that focal cerebral hyperemia is not responsible for contrast enhancement on CT.

Being a new imaging modality in our hospital, evaluation of the effectiveness of 64-row multislice CTA in detecting intracranial aneurysms in ruptured subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) cases is necessary. We conducted a descriptive prospective study by recruiting 30 consecutively operated SAH cases from May 2005 until November 2006. CTA findings were studied by radiologist and neurosurgeon and these were compared with operative findings. The sensitivity and specificity of CTA were 94.4% and 97.2% respectively. Approximately half of the patients were scanned within four hours and operated within 24 hours. In conclusion, CTA proves to be highly sensitive and specific in the diagnosis of intracranial aneurysms in our study."

Anamnesis and clinical aspects have still leading position. After that, computer-tomography stands first in the diagnostic line, followed by angiography, indicated in the acute phase only in progressive stroke. More often it is used during rehabilitation period for indication towards extra-intracranial anastomosis. Sonography gives informations specially in the extracranial stenoses by duplex sonography. The EEG is still necessary in the early stage and for follow-ups. Cerebro spinal fluid analysis, intern medicine (mainly cardiology) examinations, give extra information and should not be skipped. Psychological exams and intracranial bloodflow-studies are used during rehabilitation. Digital angiography, with the possibility of postprocessing, is in comparison to conventional angiography, less invasive. Nuclear-magnetic-resonance with its fast development is taking now place in the clinical field. Cerebro-vascular patients should be treated in specialized centers where beside the equipment, an experienced team is available, which has required its knowledge on a high number of cases and where the cooperation between the different fields of conservative (intern and neurology) radiology and surgery is guaranteed.

CD009372,0,7121818,0,NMR imaging of the brain.,"The basic features of an NMR imaging system are outlined and three pulse sequences which produce images with varying dependence on proton density T1 and T2 are described. The first of these sequences, Repeated Free Induction Decay produces images which demonstrate changes in proton density as well as flow effects. The second sequence, Inversion-recovery, produces images which are dependent on T1 and show a high level of grey, white matter contrast giving considerable anatomical detail. In addition pathological processes such as infarction, haemorrhages, demyelination and malignancy, produce changes in T1 enabling lesions to be localised. The third sequence, Spin-echo, produces images which are dependent on T2. These show very little grey, white matter contrast but demonstrate acute and space occupying lesions as well as cerebral oedema. The high level of grey, white matter contrast, lack of bone artefact, variety of sequences, capacity for multiplanar imaging, sensitivity to pathological change and lack of known hazard make NMR an important addition to existing techniques of neurological diagnosis."

A 57-year-old man had complained headache in the morning. Six hours later he was found unconsciousness and soon he was brought to our hospital. On admission he was comatose. There was no evidences of head injury and the X-rays were normal. A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed an acute subdural hematoma over the left temporoparietal region. Laboratory data revealed thrombocytosis of 85.7 x 10(4)/mm3 with increased red and white blood cell counts. Emergent right craniotomy was performed and a subdural clot was evacuated. Neither cortical damage nor vascular malformations were seen on the cortical surface. But a spurting cortical artery with a pin-hole could be seen. A postoperative CT scan revealed an intracerebral hemorrhage deep in the right hemisphere. Cerebral angiograms revealed no vascular anomalies. Postoperatively, the platelet count remained high and laboratory data including bone marrow finding, neutrophil alkali-phosphatase score and chromosome analysis were consistent with the diagnosis of essential thrombocythemia. The mechanisms of subdural hematoma formation and postoperative intracerebral hemorrhage associated with essential thrombocythemia were discussed."
CD009372,0,22162092,0,Correction for arterial-tissue delay and dispersion in absolute quantitative cerebral perfusion DSC MR imaging.,"The singular value decomposition deconvolution of cerebral tissue concentration-time curves with the arterial input function is commonly used in dynamic susceptibility contrast cerebral perfusion MR imaging. However, it is sensitive to the time discrepancy between the arrival of the bolus in the tissue concentration-time curve and the arterial input function signal. This normally causes inaccuracy in the quantitative perfusion maps due to delay and dispersion effects. A comprehensive correction algorithm has been achieved through slice-dependent time-shifting of the arterial input function, and a delay-dependent dispersion correction model. The correction algorithm was tested in 11 healthy subjects and three ischemic stroke patients scanned with a quantitative perfusion pulse sequence at 1.5 T. A validation study was performed on five patients with confirmed cerebrovascular occlusive disease scanned with MRI and positron emission tomography at 3.0 T. A significant effect (P < 0.05) was reported on the quantitative cerebral blood flow and mean transit time measurements (up to 50%). There was no statistically significant effect on the quantitative cerebral blood volume values. The in vivo results were in agreement with the simulation results, as well as previous literature. This minimizes the bias in patient diagnosis due to the existing errors and artifacts in dynamic susceptibility contrast imaging."

Beside pulmonary metastases there are often cerebral metastases, leading to intracerebral hemorrhage often responsible for the first clinical symptoms. In young women, symptoms like vaginal or pulmonary bleeding or neurologic disturbances shortly after a hydatiform mole or a normal pregnancy, accompanied by high levels of HCG in serum and CSF, choriocarcinoma should be considered. Choriocarcinoma are very sensitive to chemotherapy, which consists--depending on the stage of the disease--of a mono- or polychemotherapy. Cure rates are high, even in extended stages with cerebral metastases--as in the case described. Brain metastases with or without oncotic aneurysms can be rapidly controlled by immediate whole brain irradiation. Surgical interventions may be necessary in the case of life threatening bleedings. Levels of HCG in serum and cerebrospinal fluid are good markers to control the effect of therapy. But--as shown in this patient--levels of HCG in CSF may decrease protracted without affecting prognosis. Oncotic aneurysms are rarely reported and mostly detected post mortem. The presented case leads to a more optimistic attitude and demonstrates efficacy of immediately started radio- and chemotherapy."

She had been treated with anticonvulsant medication under a diagnosis of left mesial temporal sclerosis based on magnetic resonance imaging findings. Cerebral angiography on admission revealed occlusion of the P(2) segment of the left posterior cerebral artery (PCA) and extravasation of contrast medium during the procedure. The patient underwent left temporal lobectomy including the lesioned mesial temporal cortex, and the ruptured P(2) segment of the PCA was removed as well. The operative finding of the ruptured aneurysm was pseudoaneurysm. Histological examination of the resected PCA segment demonstrated a pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma invading the outer wall of the PCA. Presumably the bleeding was caused by the rupture of a pseudoaneurysm secondary to leptomeningeal involvement of this typically benign tumor."

For this purpose we compared retrospectively MRI data with digitized subtraction angiography (DSA) data in a group of 50 patients focusing onto the watershed area of the carotid artery vascular territories. In order to evaluate the presence of white matter lesions (WML) in the hemispheric watershed areas, coronal fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery or axial T2 weighted MRI images of patients with symptomatic cerebrovascular insufficiency areas were compared with the capillary phase of DSA studies in anterior-posterior projection. Presence of cerebrovascular occlusive disease was evaluated on DSA using North American symptomatic carotid endarterectomy trial criteria and including evaluation of collateral vascular supply. Pathological MRI findings in the region of the watershed territories correlated overall in 66% of cases with a defect or delayed filling on DSA. In the case of asymmetrical MRI findings, there was a pathological finding of the capillary phase in the watershed area in 92% of DSA studies. Hypoperfusion in the capillary phase of the watershed area as seen on DSA correlated with the stenosis degree of the concerned carotid artery. Our findings suggest that asymmetrical findings of WML in the watershed areas as seen on MRI are caused by hemodynamic effect and a differentiation between small vessel disease and a consequence of distant stenosis may be possible under such conditions."

CD009372,0,23269051,0,Simultaneous presentation of two cerebral aneurysms.,"A 48-year-old woman experienced sudden onset of severe headache. Computed tomography showed subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and intracerebral hematoma in the right frontal lobe. Digital subtraction angiography revealed three aneurysms in the anterior communicating artery (AcomA), the right posterior communicating artery (PcomA), and the right middle cerebral artery. The AcomA aneurysm was treated with endovascular coiling. However, her oculomotor nerve palsy was aggravated after the procedure. Embolization of the right PcomA aneurysm was conducted immediately and her oculomotor nerve palsy recovered completely 3 months later. Simultaneous presentation of multiple aneurysms with separate symptoms is rare. We speculate that the progressive oculomotor nerve palsy was caused by tiny enlargement or morphological change of the aneurysm caused by elevated blood pressure and pulsatile effect after SAH."

Aneurysms associated with PAN are common in visceral arteries, however, intracranial aneurysms are rare, especially in childhood. A pediatric patient with PAN developed serial hemorrhagic strokes from a ruptured superior cerebellar artery aneurysm (subarachnoid hemorrhage) and a de novo aneurysm of the frontoorbital artery (intracerebral hemorrhage) after 9 months.

We looked at these aspects in a collaborative study. We reviewed 13 patients diagnosed as having a dissecting aneurysm of the MCA based on clinical signs and neuroradiological findings in 46 stroke centres between 1995 and 1999. There were four patients who presented with cerebral ischaemia, and nine who presented with bleeding. Of the former group, three were aged less than 15 years. Cerebral angiography showed extensive stenosis and a double lumen of the M1 portion in all four patients. High signal on T1-weighted images around the arterial flow void, due to intramural haematoma, was often seen in the second week. MR angiography showed findings corresponding those of intra-arterial angiography in all four cases. We saw an infarct on CT or MRI in territory of the perforating branches of the M1 segment in all four patients. In the patients presenting with bleeding, pure subarachnoid haemorrhage or a sylvian fissure haematoma was seen on initial CT, and the predominant angiographic finding was dilatation with stenosis, but the site of the lesions was not uniform. A double lumen or intimal flap was seen in about half the cases. Rebleeding occurred within 14 days of the onset in five of the nine patients, with a poor prognosis."
CD009372,0,8866075,0,Non-invasive testing for cerebrovascular disease.,"Selecting the appropriate investigation for diagnosing occlusive cerebrovascular disease depends on the availability, cost, accuracy, invasiveness and the purpose of the test. Intraarterial digital subtraction angiography remains the gold standard, but for accuracy the stenosis should be measured rather than estimated. Duplex ultrasonography is almost as accurate and can additionally analyse plaque morphology. Of 2651 duplex tests carried out in our laboratory, 12.2% were for reversible ischaemic attacks, 2.7% for amaurosis, 12.1% for cervical bruit and 4.3% for vertebrobasilar ischaemia. Duplex within 30 days of operation was carried out on 607 patients (22.9%) and surveillance on 1000 others (37.7%). Asymptomatic carotid stenosis > 60% should be confirmed by intra-arterial digital subtraction angiography, magnetic resonance angiography or spiral computed tomography angiography. For typical transient ischaemic attacks, duplex or angiography alone is adequate but when the clinical presentation is atypical, a confirming test is required. Routine preoperative brain computed tomography is not cost-effective, being equivalent to US$ 4300-11840 per perioperative stroke in our institution. Postoperative surveillance is justified, costing only US$ 505 per patient over 4 years."

These cases comprise 2.0% of 1202 cases of hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage diagnosed by computed tomography and experienced from 1976 through 1987. Thirteen patients were male and 11 were female. Their average age was 61 years. Headache (67%) and nausea and vomiting (50%), which were often the initial symptoms, were similar to those of subarachnoid hemorrhage. The main clinical symptoms were signs of meningeal irritation. Ten patients (42%) had transient disturbance of consciousness, and nine (38%) of these were somnolent; only one patient, who had a massive hematoma, was stuporous. When the hematoma extended to the internal capsule, the patient showed motor disturbance (38%). Two patients (8%) had Horner's sign, five (21%) exhibited diminished activity, and one (4%) suffered anosognosia. The volume of the intracerebral hematoma averaged 4.7 ml and was less than 5 ml in 17 patients (71%). In 20 patients (83%), the hematoma was confined to the head of the caudate nucleus. The hemorrhage tended to rupture into the anterior horn of the lateral ventricle, and in nearly all cases (96%), intraventricular hematoma was observed. Seventeen patients (71%) underwent cerebral angiography. There were no instances of dilation of the recurrent artery of Heubner. Twenty patients (83%) were treated conservatively. Continuous ventricular drainage was employed in four patients (17%), and ventriculoperitoneal shunting in three (13%). However, it was judged retrospectively that continuous ventricular drainage had been necessary in only two cases in which disturbance of consciousness was progressed due to acute hydrocephalus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Effect of recanalization and/or collateral circulation on the lesion and prognosis.,"Findings of computed tomography (CT) and angiography in supratentorial cerebral infarction associated with complete stroke were compared with regard to prognosis. It was found that the extent of low-density areas on CT was perfectly in accordance with the areas of occluded arteries on angiograms. However, the low-density areas on CT were always smaller than the areas involved angiographically when early recanalization and/or collateral circulation were carried out within 2 to 3 days of onset. It was also found that smaller low-density areas only had favorable effect. We concluded that the prognosis was better with early recanalization and/or collateral circulation, despite the general acceptance of its poor prognostic implication."

Intracranial imaging is less satisfying with intravenous injections but reliable information is available in the assessment of the venous sinuses and parasellar internal arteries. The future of DSA lies with intraarterial contrast injections, as this technique substantially decreases the risks and costs of definitive cerebrovascular investigation."

CD009372,0,19811796,0,[Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome].,"Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS) is characterized by severe headaches, as well as vasoconstriction of cerebral arteries, which resolves spontaneously in one to three months. This condition has a moderate female preponderance. The mean age of onset is around 45 years. About 60% of the cases are secondary, mainly occurring during postpartum and/or after exposure to vasoactive substances. The main clinical presentation includes multiple recurrent thunderclap headaches over one to three weeks. The major complications of RCVS are localized cortical subarachnoid hemorrhages (cSAH) (20-25%) and parenchymal strokes (5-10%). Complications occur with different time courses: hemorrhages (cSAH and intracerebral hemorrhages), and posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome are early events occurring during the first week, while ischemic events including TIAs and cerebral infarcts occur significantly later, during the second week. Diagnosis requires the demonstration of the ""string and beads"" aspect of cerebral arteries by a cerebral angiogram (MRA, CTA or conventional) and the demonstration of the complete or marked normalisation of arteries by a repeat angiogram performed within 12 weeks of onset. Treatment is based on nimodipine that seems to reduce thunderclap headaches within 48h. However, nimodipine has not proven any efficacy against the hemorrhagic and ischemic complications of RCVS. Relapses are possible but rare and have not been reported yet in prospective series. It seems appropriate to advise the patients to avoid sympathomimetic and serotoninergic substances."

Besides the new scanning method, a new display system was also developed for the sake of more precise analysis of the isocount scanned data. This display method is called multilevel analysis or multilevel slicing of the scanned data. In the present investigation, this method was applied to thirty-two cases of cerebrovascular diseases, including seven cases of cerebral arterio-venous malformation, four cases of hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage and twenty-one cases of cerebral infarction, positive rates being 86%, 100% and 90% respectively. In case of arterio-venous malformation, minimum size detected by the isocount method was 2 cm in diameter. To twenty one cases of the cerebral infarction, total thirty two scanning examinations were performed, including postictal follow up studies. It is often said that it is two or three weeks after the ictus when the infarcted cerebral lesion is most clearly detectable by the scintigraphic procedures, presumably due to focal neovascularizations which may occur in the lesion most prominently at this postictal stage. Contradicted to the current concept, our experiences show that abnormal dot accumulations are recognized in the scintigrams even at the earlier stage, thus among five cases of cerebral infarction scanned within a week after the ictus positive figures were obtained in four cases, two of which were examined within two days after the ictus. Focal breakdown of blood brain barrier at the acute stage is considered to be responsible for the early positivity in cerebral infarctions. In eight cases among twenty one cerebral infarctions angiographies failed to demonstrate the vessel occluded. The isocount scanning method, however, succeeded in getting positive results in seven of the eight cases. It will be emphasized that the isocount scanning is a preferable diagnostic procedure in the cerebrovascular diseases, especially when the angiography is hesitated to be performed because of the patient severely affected."
CD009372,0,7792014,0,[Complementary echo flow imaging and digital angiography in the supra-aortic area for indication and intervention of carotid revascularization in 1587 subjects in the OPI (Stroke Prevention) program].,"The availability of non invasive carotid ultrasound imaging techniques actually allows planning and carrying on of large screening programs for detection of atherosclerotic carotid occlusive disease. The aim of non invasive ultrasound patient selection is to limit the practice of invasive carotid angiography only to patients for whom carotid endarterectomy is likely to be a therapeutic choice. PURPOSE. Testing the efficacy of sequential use of color coded echo flow imaging (echo color Doppler: ECD) and arterial digital angiography (ADA) respectively in the second and third phases of a screening program for detection and treatment of carotid occlusive disease in a resident population (OPI program). METHODS. From January 29th 1990 through March 31st 1992, 1,587 subjects underwent ECD out of 16,379 subjects that participated in the first level investigations. 404 of these (25.5%) were affected with carotid occlusive disease, 271 (17%) had inframural non stenosing carotid lesions and 228 (14.3%) carotid kinkings. At ECD, 71 showed lesions as severe as to be susceptible of surgical operation and underwent ADA. The percentage of carotid stenosis was calculated on the ADA imagins, applying the method suggested by the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial. RESULTS. Overall sensitivity and specificity of ECD versus ADA were 94% and 95.2% respectively. Cases in which ECD overestimated the lesion as compared to ADA results were recorded as false positive, while cases in which ECD underestimated the lesion were recorded as false negative. CONCLUSIONS. Both ultrasound imaging and ADA are useful in screening programs for carotid occlusive disease: informations different and complementary to the definition of the lesions can be obtained from each procedures in subsequent phases. Morphologic findings of carotid ECD are essentially consistent with ADA, thus allowing to carry on safely non invasive long-term follow-up programs for operated subjects as well as for people bearing carotid lesions originally not susceptible of surgical treatment."

Eighty-five patients with ischemic symptoms, decreased regional cerebral blood flow, and decreased regional cerebrovascular reactivity were recruited for surgery. The post-bypass mean regional blood flow increased by 35.8% compared to the pre-bypass value (p<0.001). Only minor re-establishment of vasculature after anastomosis was detected in three of four patients with middle cerebral artery stenosis, which suggests that there are fewer benefits of bypass surgery in this situation. Cerebral infarction occurred immediately post-operation in one patient who was predisposed to stroke due to a bilateral carotid occlusion. Hyperperfusion injury was infrequent in this series; only one patient developed intracerebral hemorrhage three weeks after the bypass. One ischemic and one hemorrhagic stroke occurred during the 90 months following surgery."

Two groups of patients were identified: (a) those suffering from a spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage (16 cases); (b) those suffering from an ischemic stroke (10 cases). Of those with spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage, 10 patients underwent surgery and evacuation of the hematoma. In 2 cases the hematoma was located in the posterior fossa, in 1 case in the upper brain stem, and in 3 cases in the basal ganglia; in the remainder the hematoma was supratentorial. Two patients died soon after the hemorrhage. Eight of the surviving patients completely recovered. In those with ischemic stroke, none suffered from congenital heart disease, a well-known predisposing factor. In this second group 1 patient died and 9 survived. Only one patient showed complete recovery. The data indicate that a hemorrhagic stroke is more common than an ischemic stroke in a child presenting with acute onset of hemiparesis and/or loss of consciousness: thus the value of CT scan as the first diagnostic procedure is clear, owing to the possibility of emergency surgical treatment. In children with ischemic strokes, a complete laboratory/clinical evaluation should be undertaken in order to exclude preexisting heart disease, coagulation disorders or lipoprotein abnormalities, and less common systemic diseases."
CD009372,0,9474281,0,Magnetic resonance angiography demonstration of an angiographically occult anterior communicating artery aneurysm.,"In almost one in six patients with spontaneous subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) no lesion responsible for the bleed will be found by cerebral angiography. Current management strategies include repeat cerebral angiography after a period of 1-8 weeks during which a number of these patients will rebleed with considerable morbidity and even mortality. We report the case of a young female patient with spontaneous subarachnoid haemorrhage. Brain computed tomography (CT) demonstrated blood mainly in the basal frontal interhemispheric fissure suggesting the presence of an anterior communicating artery (ACoA) aneurysm. Cerebral angiography was negative. Magnetic resonance (MR) angiography performed the same day showed a small aneurysm arising from the posterior wall of the ACoA. This was confirmed at surgery. It is suggested that MR angiography, guided by the CT findings, probably has a place in the management of patients with SAH of ""unknown aetiology"" before repeat catheter angiography is undertaken."

The first patient was a 63-year-old man who presented with headaches. Magnetic resonance venography was performed and suggested dural sinus thrombosis of the left transverse sinus and jugular vein. He was administered warfarin anticoagulation therapy but then suffered multiple intracranial hemorrhages. A DS angiogram was requested for a possible dural sinus thrombectomy, but the DS angiogram revealed a DAVF. The patient underwent serial liquid embolization with complete obliteration of the DAVF. The second patient, an 11-year-old boy, also presented with headaches and was diagnosed with dural sinus thrombosis on MR imaging. A DS angiogram was also requested for a possible thrombectomy and revealed a DAVF. This patient underwent serial liquid embolization and eventual operative resection. These reports emphasize that different venous flow abnormalities can appear similar on noninvasive imaging and that proper diagnosis is critical to avoid contraindicated therapies."

We present a patient who developed a sudden, severe, ""thunderclap"" headache, with no associated neurological deficit. Computed tomogram and lumbar cerebral spinal fluid obtained 5.5 hours after headache onset were negative for subarachnoid hemorrhage. The patient underwent cerebral angiography which revealed a posterior communicating artery aneurysm with an associated daughter aneurysm. Craniotomy and clip obliteration of the aneurysm were performed. The aneurysm dome was very thin and there was no evidence of recent or old hemorrhage. A ""thunderclap"" headache without subarachnoid hemorrhage may be an important harbinger of a cerebral aneurysm with the potential for future rupture.

CD009372,0,458892,0,Intracranial pressure monitoring in the acute neurologic assessment of multi-injured patients.,"The trauma victim with a severe closed head injury, who requires general anesthesia for emergency repair of concomitant exigent major injuries, poses a clinical dilemma. During general anesthesia and during the immediate postoperative period, the status of the patient's central nervous system cannot be clinically monitored, and emergency cerebral arteriograms and/or CAT scans are not easily obtained. Under these circumstances, delays in the diagnosis of intracranial blood accumulations frequently occur, and occult cerebral edema often goes untreated. In an attempt to avoid these management problems, we have employed intraoperative intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring in such patients, using a subarachnoid screw. Following placement of this screw, several clinical courses may occur: 1) The patient maintains a normal pressure; thus a significant mass lesion and/or cerebral edema requiring decompression is unlikely. 2) The patient's ICP is elevated but controlled by medical management. 3) The patient's ICP cannot be controlled below 20 to 25 mm Hg using medical management, and exploratory burr holes are made. 4) If intracranial blood is encountered during placement of the ICP monitor, immediate exploratory craniotomy is indicated."

CD009372,0,12452904,0,Dural sinus thrombosis presenting as unilateral lobar haematomas with mass effect: an easily misdiagnosed cause of cerebral haemorrhage.,"Dural sinus thrombosis has protean clinical and radiological manifestations ranging from minimal effacement of sulci with no symptoms to severe haemorrhagic infarcts associated with focal deficits, coma and even death. An uncommon form of presentation is characterized by unilateral lobar haemorrhage associated with extensive oedema and parenchymal distortion. In an acute presentation, this might resemble haemorrhage into a tumour. In delayed presentations, the haematoma, being iso- or hypodense and showing peripheral ring-like enhancement, can mimic aggressive tumours or infective processes. As this is an uncommon condition, misdiagnosis is common with the potential for mismanagement and adverse outcomes. We present five such consecutive cases that were initially misdiagnosed as other entities. Each of these cases on closer inspection show features observed on CT and MRI that should have suggested a diagnosis of dural venous sinus thrombosis. One of these cases progressed to not only extensively involve the superficial sinuses but also the deep veins, with a significant adverse outcome. The imaging features of this interesting variant of dural sinus thrombosis are reviewed. The haemodynamic basis for haemorrhage and anatomical basis for the lateralization of the lesions are discussed."
CD009372,0,21273741,0,Cortical subarachnoid hemorrhage caused by cerebral venous thrombosis.,"Patients with non-traumatic, non-aneurysmal, and non-perimesencephalic subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) tend to have clots circumscribed along the cortical convexity, a condition referred to as acute cortical SAH. Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) is a potential cause of cortical SAH. The study tried to establish the diagnosis and management of cortical SAH caused by CVT. Retrospective review of 145 patients with non-traumatic SAH identified 15 patients with no ruptured aneurysm. Clinical features were investigated with a specific focus on patients with SAH caused by CVT. Eight of the 15 patients had perimesencephalic SAH, and 7 had cortical SAH. SAH caused by CVT was diagnosed in 4 of the 7 patients with cortical SAH. The cortical SAH involved the unilateral convexity or sylvian cistern and spared the basal cistern on computed tomography in all 4 patients. CVT occurred in the transverse sinus and cortical vein (1 patient), insular vein (1 patient), and cortical vein (2 patients). Identification of thrombosed veins or sinuses was established directly by T(2)*-weighted and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in the acute stage and diffusion-weighted and T(1)-weighted MR imaging in the subacute stage. All patients had cortical swelling without findings of venous hemorrhagic infarction on T(2)*-weighted MR imaging. None of the 4 patients received active treatment, and all had favorable outcomes. CVT in patients with non-traumatic cortical SAH should be first excluded as a potential hemorrhagic cause by MR imaging for thrombosed veins or sinuses before initiating antifibrinolytic therapy."
CD009372,0,14669061,0,Radiological approach to disorders of arterial brain vessels associated with childhood arterial stroke-a comparison between MRA and contrast angiography.,"Recent studies of arterial ischaemic stroke in children have emphasised the higher frequency of cerebral arterial abnormalities than believed previously, explaining some of the strokes thought to have been idiopathic. Moreover, recurrent strokes are significantly more frequent in children with multiple risk factors, including those with demonstrable vascular abnormalities. Thus, cerebral arterial imaging is essential for the understanding and therapeutic approach to this pathology. Contrast angiography (CA) is the reference examination for the diagnosis of cerebral arterial abnormalities, but MR angiography (MRA) is a sensitive and non-invasive method to evaluate the vasculopathy of childhood stroke. In this article we highlight recent data concerning localisation and characterisation of arterial lesions and discuss the yield of MRA compared with CA."
CD009372,0,6640454,0,Carotid Doppler evaluation in cerebrovascular disease.,"The Doppler technique has proven to be a useful noninvasive technique for evaluating the patency of the carotid artery in patients at risk of stroke. The data obtained from 246 carotid Doppler examinations were compared with the angiographic findings in the same patients. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were high when the degree of stenosis was greater than 50%, but occlusions were less reliably detected, with 8 (33%) of the 24 being misdiagnosed as high-grade stenoses. Carotid Doppler evaluation guides and accelerates decisions regarding further investigations, such as cerebral angiography. It helps one decide whether a neck bruit is of arterial origin and aids assessment following cerebrovascular surgery. It is not a substitute for cerebral angiography because it poorly visualizes both the posterior and the intracranial circulations and cannot accurately detect low-grade (less than 50%) stenoses or ulcerated arterial plaques. Detection of stenosis in a carotid artery in an otherwise uncertain case is an indication for cerebral angiography, so the Doppler technique will probably increase the number of angiograms performed. However, this technique is also useful in follow-up, being without hazard, and should, therefore, reduce the likelihood of unnecessary angiographic examinations."

CD009372,0,7565039,0,[Dolichoectatic intracranial arteries. Advances in images and therapeutics].,"Dolichoectasia of intracranial arteries is an infrequent disease with an incidence less than 0.05% in general population. It represents 7% of all intracranial aneurysms. Commonly seen in middle age patients with severe atherosclerosis and hypertension, the affected arteries include the basilar artery, supraclinoid segment of the internal carotid artery, middle, anterior and posterior cerebral arteries; males are more frequently affected. The clinical features of these fusiform aneurysms are divided in three categories: ische-mic, cranial nerve compression and signs from mass effect. Hemorrhage may also occur. Nine patients with symptomatic cerebral blood vessel dolichoectasias are presented. Six of them were males with moderate or severe hypertension. Lesions were confined to the basilar artery in 3 cases, carotid arteries and the middle cerebral artery in 1 case, and both systems were affected in 4 patients. Middle cerebral arteries were affected in 5 cases and the anterior cerebral artery in one. An isolated fusiform aneurysm of the posterior cerebral artery is also presented (case 8) (Table 3). Motor or sensory deficits, ataxia, dementia, hemifacial spasm and parkinsonism were observed. One patient died from cerebro-meningeal hemorrhage (Table 2). All patients were studied with computerized axial tomography of the brain, 5 cases with four vessel cerebral angiography, 4 cases with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and case 5 with MRI angiography. Clinical symptoms depend on the affected vascular territory, size of the aneurysm and compression of adjacent structures. The histopathologic findings are atheromatous lesions, disruption of the internal elastic membrane and fibrosis of the muscular wall. The resultant is a diffuse deficiency of the muscular wall and the internal elastic membrane. Recent advances in neuroimaging such as better resolution of CT scan, magnetic resonance images (MRI) and MRI angiography increased the diagnosis of this pathology showing clearly the affected vessels. This avoids the use of conventional or digital subtraction angiography, reserved only for diagnosing suspected saccular aneurysm, evidence of subarachnoid hemorrhage or planning surgical treatment. The treatment of this entity may be medical or surgical. There is evidence suggesting a more favorable outcome with anticoagulation therapy, although antiaggregation is a reasonable alternative. In our experience no difference in clinical outcome was evident. Surgical treatment of this type of aneurysm includes intra- or extracranial occlusion of parent artery, clipping or aneurysm trapping, tourniquet occlusion, and circumferential wrapping with clip reinforcement. Endovascular occlusion has been accomplished with detachable balloon technique or coils. No surgical attempt was done in our cases. The prognosis is variable depending on the patients age, vessels involved and clinical complications.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

CD009372,0,1436415,0,Penetrating stab wounds to the brain: the timing of angiography in patients presenting with the weapon already removed.,"Angiography is always necessary in patients with penetrating stab wounds to the head, to exclude unexpected vascular lesions. The most important, since they are seldom clinically evident, are traumatic aneurysms and arteriovenous fistulae. It has previously been proposed that carotid angiography should be delayed until the start of the second week, to allow for better visualization of these complications. However, traumatic aneurysms can rupture at any time after the injury, and the mortality resulting from a second hemorrhage is unacceptably high. A prospective study was undertaken in which 330 patients with penetrating stab wounds to the head underwent angiography as soon as possible after admission. In 250 of these patients (76%), the weapon had already been removed by the assailant, and there was radiological evidence of penetration of the dura. Of these 250, 130 patients underwent angiography within 7 days of the injury. Another 51 patients, who presented late, underwent angiography more than 7 days after the injury. The timing of angiography did not affect the identification of traumatic aneurysms, the incidence of which was 12% in both groups. Of the patients with cranial stabs and who required urgent evacuation of intracerebral hematomas, 10% had traumatic aneurysms that could be dealt with simultaneously. No patient in this series suffered a secondary hemorrhage. We conclude that it is neither necessary nor safe to delay angiography. In some patients, either because of vasospasm or ""cut-off"" of a vessel, a second angiogram may be necessary to further elucidate a vascular abnormality that might not have been evident originally."

Case report.,"The mechanism of nonhemorrhagic neurological deterioration from spinal arteriovenous malformation (AVM) and the role of acute surgical intervention in this setting are not well understood. The case is described of a 65-year-old man who presented with a 2-year history of mild gait spasticity and vague sensory complaints affecting both lower extremities. Following a diagnostic lumbar puncture, these symptoms progressed painlessly over a 4-day period to total motor paraplegia, urinary retention, and hypesthesia in all modalities with a midthoracic sensory level. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a probable spinal AVM but no evidence of hemorrhage or cord compression. Spinal angiography confirmed the diagnosis of spinal AVM fed by radicular branches of left T-7 and T-8 segmental intercostal arteries. Drainage was via long dorsal veins caudally. Emergency laminectomy with intradural exploration was performed. There was no evidence of prior hemorrhage or focal mass effect, although the cerebrospinal fluid pressure was elevated. The dural component of the spinal AVM was excised, and its communications with the spinal cord were disconnected intradurally. Neurological function started improving within 6 hours of the patient awakening from anesthesia. He had achieved antigravity strength in every muscle group of the lower extremities by the time of discharge to a rehabilitation center 10 days after surgery. Three months postoperatively, he was ambulating with a walker and was continent of urine and stool. Possible pathophysiological mechanisms are discussed in light of the favorable response to timely surgical intervention."

CD009372,0,8004740,0,Cerebral arteriovenous malformations in children.,"The treatment of cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVM) or vascular anomalies are challenging neurosurgical procedures for an anaesthetist. Large AVMs are uncommon in children. Only 18% of AVMs become symptomatic before the age of 15 yr. This series reviews the experience at this institution during the period of 1982 to 1992. The symptoms at the time of presentation are varied and include haemorrhage (50%), seizures and hydrocephalus (36%) or congestive cardiac failure (18%). Symptoms of congestive heart failure predominate in the newborn whilst neurological symptoms, such as stroke, seizures or hydrocephalus occur more commonly in infants and older children. Approximately one third of AVMs in childhood present acutely. Radiological investigations, e.g., CT scan, MRI and cerebral angiography are essential to identify the precise location of the lesion. Therapeutic intervention in the acute presentation may involve craniotomy for evacuation of haematoma and treatment of increased intracranial pressure (ICP). Control of seizures and congestive heart failure may take priority and allow time to plan the elective procedures of embolization and surgical excision of the AVM. Operative intervention is hazardous and peroperative complications can be expected in more than 50% of patients. The morbidity and mortality associated with cerebral AVM are high, especially in infants who present in the neonatal period with congestive cardiac failure. The overall mortality in this series was 20%. Children presenting with intracranial arteriovenous malformations require a multidisciplinary approach. The successful management of anaesthesia either for embolization or surgical resection necessitates an understanding of the disciplines of paediatric and neuroanaesthesia. Special care and specific attention to detail may contribute to reduce the high morbidity and mortality encountered in these compromised children."

Brain computed tomography (CT) revealed a clot dominantly on the right (Fisher's classification Group 4). Cerebral angiography showed funnel-shaped widenings at the origins of the bilateral posterior communicating arteries. The maximum diameter of the widening was greater than 3 mm, so this widening was called an enlarged infundibular widening. Angiography showed a small bulge protruding posterolaterally from the wall of the right enlarged infundibular widening, and the right posterior communicating artery arose from the apex of the enlarged infundibular widening. Based on the findings of the brain CT and cerebral angiography, the diagnosis was SAH due to rupture of the right enlarged infundibular widening. Approximately 12 hours after the onset, the clot was evacuated through the right pterional approach. Bleeding from the small bulge of the right enlarged infundibular widening occurred intraoperatively, so a right-angled ring clip was applied parallel to the right internal carotid artery to obliterate the rupture point. Postoperatively, she was discharged without neurological deficit, and follow-up CT showed no other new infarction. We recommend clipping rather than wrapping or coating for similar cases of ruptured enlarged infundibular widening."

Distension and enlargement of the cavum septi pellucidi (CSP) and cavum vergae (CV), along with hydrocephalus, was detected during the course of the disease and was observed to regress together with resolution of the venous occlusion. Venous hypertension caused by sinus occlusion was thought to be responsible for the disturbed resorption of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the CSP and CV in this patient.

CD009372,0,8652145,0,"Acute neuroradiology: methods, indications and timing.","The rapid development of radiological examination methods, technical innovations and creative and critical radiological research have dramatically changed the diagnostic approach with new indications and changed timing in the examination of patients with acute neurological lesions. The role of CT as the primary radiological examination method in these patients is well established, and is routinely used before the start of suitable treatment to detect or exclude intracranial haemorrhage, either traumatic or nontraumatic, or to detect other causes of acute onset of neurological disease, such as intracerebral tumours or subdural haematoma. The role of MRI still needs further confirmation. The sensitivity of MRI is superior to that of CT, especially in examination of the spinal cord. The main drawbacks of MRI are the problems in monitoring acutely ill patients, the unfamiliarity with the method, and capacity problems. Today, MRI is mainly used as a complement to CT, with the exception of spine injuries where MRI is the method of first choice. Also, the role of digital subtraction angiography is changing from diagnostic examinations towards endovascular therapeutic procedures. An experienced neuroradiologist has the key position in choosing and performing the most suitable examination method for each specific indication."

CD009372,0,122463,0,[Acute disease pictures of cerebrovascular origin in childhood].,"To summarize it can be said that an analysis of 1080 cerebral angiographies of children and juveniles up to 16 years of age and an examination of clinical results obtained for a stock of unsifted pediatric and neurosurgical patients allowed as many as 145 cases of vascular processes to be detected in children and juveniles. This number appears to be relatively large even if we consider that we are concerned here with a selected patient stock of a supraregional specialized clinic. If we also consider that the number of angiographies presently performed in cases of vascular disease processes is still comparatively small and that patients have to wait indiscussibly long times before being finally angiographed, then it is obvious that many a vascular disease process still goes undetected or is either misinterpreted or made clear at too late a time. It is here that much remains to be done in order to provide the necessary material basis, for what we still lack is the necessary number of costly diagnostic facilities with highly qualified diagnosticians as well as the necessary follow-up facilities such as, for example, neurosurgical, vasculosurgical, and intensive care units. We therefore welcome recent improvements in this direction, especially since the realization of a large-scale project would make possible an optimum diagnosis and treatment of vascular disease processes in both children and juveniles."
CD009372,0,11720332,0,Three-dimensional image display without special eyeglasses: observation of magnetic resonance angiography using the stereoscopic liquid crystal display.,"The authors have developed a new stereoscopic liquid crystal display that provides real-time 3-dimensional image viewing without special eyeglasses. The device consists of 3 major parts: (1) an image display composed of a 10.4-inch color liquid crystal plate with a resolution of 640 x 480, (2) an automatic head tracking system, and (3) a special backlight unit for the right and left eyes. Eight radiologists interpreted 60 cases of magnetic resonance angiography (29 cases of cerebrovascular disease and 31 normal cases) to compare film display and the liquid crystal display (ie, pseudo 3-dimensional display and true 3-dimensional display). Using a continuously distributed scale ranging from 0% to 100%, the observers ranked their confidence levels in determining the presence or absence of steno-occlusive disease, aneurysm, and arteriovenous malformation (AVM) and their locations. For statistical evaluation, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and Brier score were used. For detecting AVM, film reading showed a significantly higher value in the area under the binormal ROC curve (Az) than did pseudo-3-dimensional display (P < .05). Excluding this, however, no significant difference existed in Az values among the 3 viewing methods. Also, there was no significant difference in Brier score between not only the stereoscopic view and nonstereoscopic view groups, but also the senior and junior groups. Subjective estimation of true 3-dimensional display showed that vessels were more distinguishable with less eye fatigue compared with stereoscopic film reading. The stereoscopic liquid crystal display provided almost equal efficacy to film reading; however, the short optimum distance for observation and the low resolution should be improved."

This IACNS has been a poorly characterized and infrequently reported illness since it was first described as a separate entity in 1959. However, a patient with IACNS has not been reported in Japan. A patient, 39-year old-male, with IACNS limited to small and middle vessels is described. Recurrent, transient consciousness disturbances, focal myoclonus, papilloedema and temporal lobe epilepsy were observed during disease course. CSF finding of this patient showed lymphocytosis with marked increased protein. Carotid and vertebral angiogram showed irregular luminal outline in branches of all arteries. The most specific finding is that of alternating areas of focal stenosis and ectasia giving a ""sausage"" pattern. These characteristic findings showed in the branch of external carotid arteries. There was no evidence of systemic vasculitis by systemic angiography. Biopsy of temporal artery showed lymphocyte infiltration, fibrinoid necrosis without giant cell and granuloma. Formation of A-V malformation in the branch of external carotid artery was also observed. This histopathological finding was compatible with necrotizing angitis, not granulomatous angitis. Isolated angitis of the central nervous system was diagnosed. In spite of his administration of corticosteroid, cerebrospinal fluid abnormalities has not responded markedly. Abnormal findings of carotid and vertebral angiogram also has not changed. After 7 years from his onset, his neurologic signs and symptoms were well controlled with administration of anti-epileptic drugs."

We evaluated the sensitivity and the quality of morphological analysis mode possible by an experimental system for imaging cerebrovascular disease versus standard digital subtraction angiography (DSA). The system, the 3D Morphometer, is a computerised X-ray angiography unit capable of acquiring a set of two-dimensional (2D) projections during a rotation and then reconstructing a 3D volume from them. We studied 78 patients with suspected cerebrovascular disease. 3D and 2D images (standard 2D DSA performed during the same procedure), were reviewed blindly to assess detection and display of morphological characteristics of cerebrovascular diseases. We found 53 aneurysms, 22 arteriovenous malformations and two venous angiomas. On 3D angiography we detected two aneurysms we missed on 2D angiography. In 47 aneurysms on which further data were obtained during surgery or embolisation, the 3D angiography allowed more accurate analysis of the neck and surrounding vessels in cases in which the 2D angiographic findings were doubtful. Assessment of arteriovenous malformations was equivalent with both techniques. Under the conditions of our study, the technical constraints being the same for both methods, 3D angiography was superior to 2D angiography. Implementation on C-arm vascular systems is being evaluated."

She had first experienced a transient pain in the left upper extremity one month before admission. She noticed dysesthesia in the same limb and weakness on her left hand, and, five days after, visited our hospital because of suddenly developed convulsion in the limb and loss of consciousness for a few minutes. Neurological examination revealed distal dominant flaccid paresis, positive pathological reflex and touch and position sense disturbances in the affected limb. Brain CT detected two high-density areas in the parietal lobe. Brain MRI demonstrated an acute phase subcortical hematoma in the left postcentral gyrus and a subacute phase one in the left superior parietal lobule. SPECT indicated hypoperfusion in the left frontal and parietal cortex. Cerebral angiography showed no abnormal findings. Her symptoms gradually improved, but left ulnar-type pseudoradicular sensory impairment remained on discharge. We considered the hemorrhage in this patient have arisen from rupture of cavernous hemangioma, because she was relatively young, the hematomas were oval in shape and successively developed in the left parietal lobe.

CD009372,0,20387576,0,[Case of ruptured multiple cerebral aneurysms associated with primary aldosteronism].,"Primary aldosteronism (PA) has been recognized as a relatively benign form of hypertension associated with a low incidence of vascular complications. Recent reports, however, indicate that cerebrovascular accidents are common in PA. We report a case of multiple aneurysms with PA in a middle-aged woman who presented with subarachnoid hemorrhage. A 47-year-old woman with a history of untreated hypertension was referred to our hospital for subarachnoid hemorrhage. Cerebral angiography showed multiple small aneurysms. The initial intervention was aneurysm clipping for a ruptured aneurysm at the bifurcation of the right middle cerebral artery. Despite medication, she continued to suffer from uncontrolled hypertension and hypokalemia. She was diagnosed with PA on the basis of elevated plasma aldosterone, suppressed plasma rennin, and a right adrenal tumor detected by abdominal CT scanning. She underwent several more neck clippings for the remaining aneurysms (unruptured), followed by a total right adrenectomy. Histological examination revealed an adrenal adenoma. After the operation, her blood pressure returned to normal without any vasodepressors. Recent studies have demonstrated that hyperaldosteronism might have direct vasculo-toxic actions, including remodeling, fibrosis, and proliferation. Cerebrovascular accidents caused by PA are reported to have high rates of mortality and recurrence when the PA is overlooked or untreated. Physicians must be alert to the possibility of PA in patients with hypertension and persistent hypokalemia, especially in those who are young or middle-aged. We also recommend screening for intracranial aneurysms by low-invasive magnetic resonance angiography."

CD009372,0,9600195,0,Diagnosis of intracranial vasculitis: a multi-disciplinary approach.,"Intracranial vasculitis, or primary angiitis of the central nervous system (PACNS), is an uncommon, often fatal disorder that frequently responds to aggressive immunosuppressive therapy. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), cerebral angiography, and brain biopsy are diagnostic modalities that vary in invasiveness and diagnostic accuracy. The purpose of this study was to determine whether certain clinical or radiologic features were predictive of a diagnostic biopsy. Thirty consecutive patients undergoing brain biopsy to ""rule out vasculitis"" were studied. Nine patients demonstrated granulomatous or lymphocytic vasculitis, 1 had lymphocytic vasculitis and encephalitis secondary to arbovirus infection, 5 had thickened vessels consistent with hypertensive changes, 5 had amyloid angiopathy and/or changes of Alzheimer disease, 5 demonstrated no pathologic abnormalities, and 1 each had acute infarct, vascular malformation, aneurysm, acellular fibrinoid necrosis, and demyelination. The spectrum of MRI and angiographic changes associated with PACNS were nonspecific, overlapping extensively with changes of chronic hypertension and amyloid deposition. The predictive values of brain biopsy (90-100%) were significantly higher than those of angiography (37-50%) or MRI (43-72%). In this study, morbidity associated with aggressive immunosuppression was significantly greater than that associated with cerebral angiography or brain biopsy. Thus, wedge biopsy of cortical and leptomeningeal tissues is central to the multi-disciplinary approach to a patient with clinical suspicion of PACNS."
CD009372,0,19833792,0,Overlying fluoroscopy and preacquired CT angiography for road-mapping in cerebral angiography.,We describe our preliminary experience using a road-mapping procedure that involves combining preacquired CTA with real-time fluoroscopy. This maneuver facilitates navigation in supra-aortic vessels from the arch to skull base levels.

NMR showed dural sinuses thrombosis better than CT even though cerebral angiography was more effective for the diagnosis. Intracranial hypertension due to hydrocephalus was relieved with a ventriculoperitoneal shunt. The authors suggest that the abnormal hemodynamic patterns due to the drainage of the malformation into the vein of Galen and dural sinuses led to venous occlusion and multiple intracranial hemorrhages.
CD009372,0,2349537,0,Cerebellar venous angioma associated with angiographically occult brain stem vascular malformation.

One patient had recurrent hemorrhage in the pontine tegmentum. The second patient had recurrent hemorrhage in the midbrain. None had hemorrhage originating from the abnormal cerebellar venous channels. The more benign nature of angiographic venous malformations is supported by the cases we are presenting, as well as from a review of the literature, which includes an autopsy study of similar cases. The management of multiple vascular brain lesions is contingent on the verification of symptomatic pathological blood vessels. It is emphasized that angiographically occult vascular malformation could possibly exist in the vicinity of angiographic venous malformation when the patient with intracerebral hemorrhage, especially in the posterior fossa, was diagnosed as having venous malformation."

The clinical diagnosis of cerebral vascular disease was made in 75% of the cases from that serie but the hemorrhagic mechanism was identified only in 50,6% of cases. The diagnosis accuracy was enhanced in large and recent hemorrhages occuring in patients under 70 years old. It seemed better in cerebellar and intermediate locations. It was enhanced in more recent observations (collected since 1974). The practice of cerebral angiography and lumbar puncture rose up (in a somewhat equivalent way) the proportion of accurate diagnoses. The lumbar puncture practice was not associated with a higher rate of cerebral herniae."

This disease primarily involves the intraabdominal arterial system, resulting in intraabdominal and retroperitoneal hemorrhage in most cases. The patient presented with severe headache and vomiting. The CT scans of the head revealed SAH. Cerebral angiography revealed 3 aneurysms: 1 in the right distal anterior cerebral artery (ACA), 1 in the distal portion of the A(1) segment of the right ACA, and 1 in the left vertebral artery. The patient had a history of multiple intraabdominal aneurysms involving the splenic, gastroepiploic, gastroduodenal, and bilateral renal arteries. He underwent a right frontotemporal craniotomy and fibrin coating of the dissecting aneurysm in the distal portion of the A(1) segment of the right ACA, which was the cause of the hemorrhage. Follow-up revealed no significant changes in the residual intracranial and intraabdominal aneurysms. An SAH due to SAM with associated multiple intraabdominal aneurysms is extremely rare. The authors describe their particular case and review the literature pertaining to SAM with associated intracranial and intraabdominal aneurysms."

Cerebral angiography demonstrated no vascular abnormality, and the hematoma was removed surgically. At operation, no abnormal vascular lesion was found in the brain adjoining the hematoma. Two years later, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging demonstrated a few foci of flow voids adjacent to the hematoma cavity. Four years after the hemorrhage, MR imaging showed more extensive flow-void abnormalities that indicated growth of an occult arteriovenous malformation (AVM). Cerebral angiography indicated a definite AVM supplied mainly by branches of the middle cerebral artery. Total resection of this lesion was performed. The histological diagnosis was typical AVM. Immunohistochemistry with vascular endothelial growth factor showed staining in the walls of the abnormal vessels. Serial MR imaging is very useful for the diagnosis and management of occult AVMs."

CD009372,0,22807022,0,Mapping of cerebral perfusion territories using territorial arterial spin labeling: techniques and clinical application.,"A knowledge of the exact cerebral perfusion territory which is supplied by any artery is of great importance in the understanding and diagnosis of cerebrovascular disease. The development and optimization of territorial arterial spin labeling (T-ASL) MRI techniques in the past two decades have made it possible to visualize and determine the cerebral perfusion territories in individual patients and, more importantly, to do so without contrast agents or otherwise invasive procedures. This review provides an overview of the development of ASL techniques that aim to visualize the general cerebral perfusion territories or the territory of a specific artery of interest. The first efforts of T-ASL with pulsed, continuous and pseudo-continuous techniques are summarized and subsequent clinical studies using T-ASL are highlighted. In the healthy population, the perfusion territories of the brain-feeding arteries are highly variable. This high variability requires special consideration in specific patient groups, such as patients with cerebrovascular disease, stroke, steno-occlusive disease of the large arteries and arteriovenous malformations. In the past, catheter angiography with selective contrast injection was the only available method to visualize the cerebral perfusion territories in vivo. Several T-ASL methods, sometimes referred to as regional perfusion imaging, are now available that can easily be combined with conventional brain MRI examinations to show the relationship between the cerebral perfusion territories, vascular anatomy and brain infarcts or other pathology. Increased availability of T-ASL techniques on clinical MRI scanners will allow radiologists and other clinicians to gain further knowledge of the relationship between vasculature and patient diagnosis and prognosis. Treatment decisions, such as surgical revascularization, may, in the near future, be guided by information provided by T-ASL MRI in close correlation with structural MRI and quantitative perfusion information."
CD009372,0,2396261,0,Clinical and laboratory findings in patients with antiphospholipid antibodies and cerebral ischemia. The Antiphospholipid Antibodies in Stroke Study Group.,"We reviewed the clinical and laboratory data of 128 patients with cerebrovascular disease and antiphospholipid antibodies. Cases were evenly divided between men and women, and the mean age of the study group was 46 years. Cerebral infarction occurred in 97 patients, and transient hemispheric ischemic attacks without stroke were recorded in 19; 12 suffered ocular ischemia. Systemic lupus erythematosus was diagnosed in 16% of all cases. Histories of systemic thromboembolic events and recurrent miscarriages were noted in 14% of the patients and in 19% of the women, respectively. Evidence of cerebral infarction preceding the index event was present in 30% of cases. During a mean follow-up of 16 months, nine of 96 (9%) patients sustained new cerebral infarctions. Of 72 echocardiographic studies, 16 (22%) showed valvular abnormalities. Cerebral angiography detected intracranial lesions in 24 of 49 patients (49%). These data indicate that antiphospholipid antibodies can be identified in stroke patients without known autoimmune disorders. They also suggest that antiphospholipid antibody-associated cerebrovascular ischemia may be recurrent and often occurs in patients with systemic thromboembolic events. Our findings should help design a prospective clinical trial that will assess the risk of recurrent thromboembolism in this population, identify stroke risk factors, and address therapy."

The aim of the study was to investigate possible connections between the angiographic data and the clinical condition some years later. In the 37 patients who were not subjected to surgical treatment prognosis was not significantly different in cases with, and those without stenoses/occlusions in the craniocervical vessels. However, patients suffering from severe stenoses/occlusions had a significantly worse prognosis than patients with stenoses of a mild degree. The clinical course in patients with stenoses/occlusions localized in the vertebro-basilar system was significantly more favourable than the course of the disease in patients with similar changes in the carotid system. There was a trend towards a worse clinical picture at the end of the follow-up period in cases with degenerative alterations in the small intracranial arteries. The difference in prognostic value of cerebral 4-vessel angiography in cases of stroke in the young, as opposed to the findings in older patients is discussed."

The protocol called for a three point assessment: on admission to the rehabilitation ward and at one month and one year after entry. Baseline and follow-up examinations included clinical and laboratory tests, CT scan, cerebral blood flow studies and angiography. Motor functions were evaluated by the Rivermead Motor Assessment and dependence (ADL) was measured by the Barthel index. Neuropsychological evaluations were also made using Benton's test, Bourdon's letter cancellation test and the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale.

This study was organized to gather preliminary data regarding the sensitivity and specificity of TCD when compared to cerebral angiography in detecting stenosing lesions and collateral flow patterns of the anterior cerebral circulation. Forty-two patients from six medical centers were prospectively enrolled. Each received cerebral angiography and TCD testing within 24 hours of each other. Based on TCD criteria established a priori, the results were first analyzed by a blinded investigator and then by computer. Computerized analyses were then repeated with modified criteria. Collateral flow through the anterior communicating and ophthalmic arteries was detected with sensitivities of 62% and 100%, and specificities of 98% and 92%, respectively. Internal carotid artery proximal and distal severe ( greater than 70%) stenoses were detected with sensitivities of 79% and 100% and specificities of 88% and 97%. Middle and anterior cerebral artery stenoses and middle cerebral artery occlusion were detected with specificities exceeding 98%; however, the data were insufficient to determine sensitivity. Computerized analyses did not permit improvement of sensitivity and specificity of the baseline criteria. The selected TCD criteria are highly specific in detecting intracranial stenoses and collateral flow patterns of the anterior circulation. The criteria have limited but acceptable sensitivity and specificity in detecting internal carotid artery origin severe stenoses, and are highly sensitive in detecting ophthalmic artery retrograde flow. A study with a larger sample is necessary to provide definitive guidelines for diagnosis."
CD009372,0,12805485,0,Reliability of assessing percentage of diffusion-perfusion mismatch.,Emergent neurovascular imaging holds promise in identifying new and optimum target populations for thrombolysis in stroke. Recent research has focused on patients with diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI)-perfusion-weighted MRI (PWI) mismatch as a marker of tissue at risk of infarction and a means to select the most suitable candidates for thrombolysis. The present study sought to estimate the reliability of assessing the percentage of DWI-PWI mismatch.
CD009372,0,8426937,0,Comparison of time-of-flight and phase-contrast MR neuroangiographic techniques.,"Magnetic resonance (MR) angiography constitutes a group of evolving MR imaging techniques that can be used to directly image flow in arteries, veins, and cerebrospinal fluid. By using multiple MR angiographic sequences in each of 18 patients with neurologic conditions such as aneurysms, arteriovenous malformations, and carotid atherostenotic disease, the advantages, disadvantages, and unique artifacts of each technique could be investigated. Time-of-flight imaging is susceptible to saturation effects, and short T1 substances may simulate flow. Two-dimensional time-of-flight imaging is useful in cranial venography in assessing the patency of the dural sinuses or venous drainage from an arteriovenous malformation. Three-dimensional time-of-flight images depict small and medium-sized aneurysms. Phase-contrast imaging has excellent background suppression, allows variable velocity encoding, and provides directional flow information. Two-dimensional phase-contrast imaging is useful in the assessment of the patency of major vascular structures. Three-dimensional phase-contrast imaging (with 30-cm/sec velocity encoding) is also useful in depicting small and medium-sized aneurysms. Although some applications of MR angiography are clear, further study and development of the techniques are necessary to determine which imaging sequence or combination of techniques is best suited for answering specific diagnostic questions."

Shortly after admission, she sustained a second subarachnoid hemorrhage with acute neurological decompensation. A repeat computed tomographic scan revealed increased blood along the right medial temporal region, as well as in the interhemispheric fissure and bilateral sylvian cisterns. Also evident was a right hemispheric acute subdural hematoma. The patient's rapidly deteriorating neurological status precluded a cerebral angiogram; therefore, a double-dose infusion computed tomographic scan was performed. This revealed a cerebral artery aneurysm adjacent to the right medial temporal hematoma. She was taken to the operating room on the basis of this study. After evacuation of the right hemispheric subdural hematoma and clipping of the right posterior communicating artery aneurysm, the patient made a rapid, full neurological recovery."

We studied 364 patients undergoing RCS at Washington Hospital Center between 2004 and 2008, including 137 clinically referred for MDCCTA. Baseline demographics, procedural data, and perioperative outcomes were recorded at the time of the procedure. The primary clinical endpoint was the composite of perioperative death, myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, and hemorrhage-related reoperation. Secondary clinical endpoints included surgical procedural variables and the perioperative volume of bleeding and transfusion. Length of stay was determined using the hospital's electronic medical record. Cost data were extracted from the hospital's billing summary. Analysis was performed on individual categories of care, as well as on total hospital charges. Data were compared between subjects with and without MDCCTA, after adjustment for the Society of Thoracic Surgeons score. Baseline characteristics were similar between the two groups. MDCCTA was associated with shorter procedural times, shorter intensive care unit stays, fewer blood transfusions, and less frequent perioperative MI. There was additionally a trend towards a lower incidence of the primary endpoint (17.5 vs. 24.2 %, p = 0.13) primarily due to a lower incidence of perioperative MI (0 vs. 5.7 %, p = 0.002). MDCCTA was also associated with lower median recovery room [$1,325 (1,250-3,302) vs. $3,217 (1,325-5,353) p < 0.001] and nursing charges [$6,335 (3,623-10,478) vs. $6,916 (3,915-14,499) p = 0.03], although operating room charges were higher [$24,100 (22,300-29,700) vs. $23,500 (19,900-27,700) p < 0.05]. Median total charges [$127,000 (95,000-188,000) vs. $123,000 (86,800-226,000) p = 0.77] and length of stay [9 days (6-19) vs. 11 days (7-19), p = 0.21] were similar. Means analysis demonstrated a strong trend towards lower mean total hospital charges [$163,000 (108,426) vs. $192,000 (181,706), p = 0.06] in the MDCCTA group. In conclusion, preoperative MDCCTA is associated with a number of improved perioperative outcomes and does not significantly effect the length of stay or total hospital charges during the index hospitalization."
CD009372,0,8267356,0,Comparison of accuracy of magnetic resonance angiography with conventional angiography: a report of 45 cases.,"To investigate the accuracy of magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), compared to conventional cerebral and carotid angiography (CA), 45 patients underwent MRA within one week after CA. The MRA involves a FISP (fast imaging steady precession) pulse sequence base on three-dimensional time-of-flight phenomena at 1.0 Tesla. Repetition time of 35-40 msec, echo time of 7-11 msec and a flip angle of 15-25 degrees were used to optimise the depiction of blood flow as high intensity. Volume data were then submitted to a maximum intensity projection programme and viewed at multiple arbitrary projection angles rotating through the three orthogonal planes. Venous structures were suppressed with a presaturation slab superior to the area of interest. All significant stenoses and occlusions at the carotid bifurcation and circle of Willis were detected. Other than the carotid siphon (61.4%), the rest of the arteries have above 70% complete agreement between MRA and CA. The carotid bifurcation and basilar artery show complete agreement of 75.4% and 76.2% respectively, making MRA a simple sensitive screening procedure. This report shows that MR angiography has an important role in the evaluation of blood flow in the head and neck regions."
CD009372,0,8267357,0,Cerebrovascular applications of magnetic resonance angiography.,"Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) has been applied to a variety of different manifestations of cerebrovascular disease to date. Practically, the limitations of these techniques must be taken into account such that the appropriate method is applied to answer a specific clinical question and the acquisition parameters are chosen to maximise the sensitivity and specificity of the study. Based upon these results, it must be decided whether the conventional parenchymal MR and MRA evaluations are sufficient in a particular setting or whether it is necessary to commit the patient to a more traditional, invasive angiographic study for a more thorough investigation. Presently, MR angiographic studies and flow measurement techniques serve to compliment the more traditional spin-echo evaluation of patients with small aneurysms, arterial and venous occlusions, vascular malformations and in some cases of neoplastic vascular invasion. With well-trained technicians and carefully prescribed protocols, this new information and improved diagnostic sensitivity can be used routinely with only a minor increase in patient exam time."

In fact, it is the commonest intracranial vascular malformation seen at autopsy. We report our experience of 15 patients with cerebral venous angiomas, 14 of whom had their lesions confirmed by cerebral angiography. Presentation was variable and non-specific. The commonest presenting symptom was headache (n = 7). Other clinical presentations included epilepsy (n = 5), intracerebral bleed (n = 4, two were thought to be due to an associated cerebral cavernous angioma and one was due to a ruptured arteriovenous malformation) and non-specific giddiness (n = 3). Six were diagnosed incidentally.

Their experience with over 150 patients indicates that this examination may be performed in conjunction with standard spin-echo imaging with only a minimal increase in patient examination time. This combined examination is most applicable to atherosclerotic disease of the carotid bifurcation, arterial occlusions of the primary and secondary branches of the intracranial circulation (particularly in pediatric patients such as those following ECMO or with sickle cell anemia), and patients with saccular berry aneurysms. This type of static, angiographic technique adds little to standard spin-echo imaging in patients with arteriovenous fistulae, neoplasms, and giant intracranial aneurysms. Limitations of the present technique include the inability to visualize slow flow lesions (e.g., giant aneurysms) and selected high flow states (arteriovenous fistulae, some severe stenoses)."

There were two patients with arteriovenous fistula (AVF), three with arteriovenous malformation (AVM), and one with multiple AVMs associated with AVF. Seizures were the most common presenting symptom (seen in three patients), and two of them had intracerebral hematomas (ICH). In the remainder, the malformations were incidentally found in the course of evaluation of other diseases. Their locations were variable, but the majority was superficially confined to the cerebral cortex. Arterial supply was from mostly one feeding artery that was a cortical branch of either anterior, middle, or posterior cerebral artery. In six of nine malformations, the venous drainage was through a superficial cerebral vein into either the superior sagittal sinus or transverse sinus. Direct surgery was done on two patients with ICH, artificial embolization on one, and stereotactic radiosurgery on one. The cerebral vascular malformations in HHT are not infrequent, and in particular the importance of computed tomography and cerebral angiography should be recognized in patients with pulmonary AVF associated with HHT."

CMBs were evaluated on T2∗-weighted MRI, and BA diameters were measured as the maximal width of the flow void on axial T2-weighted MRI to assess dilatation. Patients were divided into 2 groups, with CMBs and without CMBs, and clinical information and BA diameters were compared between the groups. Regression analyses of the data also were performed. The 2 groups had significant differences in mean blood pressure (MBP), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and uricemic acid levels, and BA diameter. Adjusted logistic regression analysis showed that MBP (odds ratio [OR], 1.059 per 1 mm Hg; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.019-1.101; P = .0035), LDL (OR, 0.976 per 1 mg/dL; 95% CI, 0.960-0.994; P = .0072), and BA diameter (OR, 3.266 per 1 mm; 95% CI, 1.504-7.103; P = .0028) each had an independent association with the presence of CMB. Adjusted multiple regression analysis showed that only BA diameter (β coefficient, 0.240; 95% CI, 0.775-3.734; P = .0031) was independently associated with the number of CMBs. Our data indicate that CMB, a manifestation of SVD, shows a strong association with BA dilatation."

The procedure hitherto, in which angiographic clarification of the intracranial space-occupying lesions and of the extracranial vascular changes is almost always performed, will change with the introduction of computer tomography in favor of the bloodless method (Doppler echography). Angiography will then only be carried out in proven hemodynamically active stenosis after the neurological symptoms have receded. The treatment of ischemic cerebral disease is a task for the hospital. Transient ischemic attacks also require hospital supervision, preferably under conditions of intensive care.

CD009372,0,11688694,0,MRI of acute post-ischemic cerebral hemorrhage in stroke patients: diagnosis with T2*-weighted gradient-echo sequences.,"The use of T2*-weighted sequences has been advocated for early differentiation between hematoma and ischemia in patients with acute stroke. Early hemorrhagic transformation of ischemic stroke is an adverse event which may occur under treatment and may impair the prognosis: our aim is to evaluate the ability of T2*-weighted gradient-echo sequence (T2* GRE) to detect post-ischemic cerebral hemorrhage. The imaging procedure included: (1) baseline CT scan at admission. (2) MRI performed within 24 h of therapy onset including: (a) dual fast spin echo T2 sequence, (b) axial isotropic echoplanar diffusion-weighted imaging sequence, (c) conventional T2* GRE, and (d) 3D TOF turbo MRA. Post-ischemic cerebral hemorrhage was diagnosed if T2* GRE detected a focal intraparenchymal area of signal loss. The diameter of this lesion had to be more than 5 mm in order to eliminate past microbleeds. (3) Patients who showed an early suspicion of bleeding on MRI promptly had a second CT scan, and, if this one was negative for bleeding, another CT scan was performed 1 day later. All the other patients had a control CT scan during the first week. Forty-five consecutive patients have been included. T2* GRE showed intracranial bleeding in seven. The diagnosis of post-ischemic cerebral bleeding was confirmed by CT in all patients. Control CT scans did not reveal any post-ischemic cerebral hemorrhage in patients with negative MRI. In one case, hemorrhage was seen earlier on MRI than on CT scan. In conclusion, T2* GRE appeared to be at least as efficient as CT scan in the detection of early post-ischemic cerebral hemorrhage."

An 83-year-old man had right homonymous hemianopsia and right mild hemiparesis. CT scan revealed hematoma and a perifocal low density area at the left occipital subcortex without subarchnoid hemorrhage (SAH). MRI showed repeated bleeding at the same location as the CT scan. Moreover, cerebral angiograms disclosed an aneurysm on the leptomeningeal anastomosis from the left posterior cerebral artery to the middle cerebral artery. The anterior trunk of the left middle cerebral artery was occluded at the origin. The aneurysm was not situated at the bifurcation and was trapped without new neurological complications. This case suggested that hemodynamic stress due to occlusion of the main artery contributed to the development of an aneurysm at the collateral artery. Even if intraparenchymal hematoma presents without SAH, and even if it is located at a rare site for aneurysms, we should inspect the source of bleeding considering factors preventing SAH arising from aneurysms."

The size and localisation of infarcts as shown on the computer tomogram were compared with the changes found in the carotid angiogram and were also related to the localisation of occlusion or stenosis of the corresponding extra- and intracranial vessels. In the presence of a normal carotid angiogram, CT may show infarcts of varying localisation and size; with stenoses or occlusion of the extracranial portion of the internal carotid artery, the infarcts tend to be smaller and that, in the presence of occulsions of the intracranial cerebral vessels, infarcts tend to be more extensive and to correspond to the territory supplied by the occluded vessels.

CD009372,0,740158,0,The diagnosis of cerebral atrophy on the basis of cerebral angiogram.,"An increased distance between brain surface, represented by the terminal arterial branches, and skull causes the appearance of a broad avascular band in the carotid angiogram, which--apart from other criteria--has been valued as a sign of cerebral atrophy. We investigated 54 patients (ages 60-79 years) suffering from cerebrovascular disease. Carotid angiographies of the afflicted hemispheres were carried out within 4 to 90 days after the stroke. The distance between vessels and skull was measured in frontal and lateral projection. We evaluated statistically the impact on this distance of alterations in extracranial vessel walls, number of attacks, severity of stroke, and patient's age. The results are compared to those of CAT. Only limited correlations have been found between the above-mentioned parameters and the distance between vessels and skull. Thus the distance is only of limited diagnostic value for the verification of senile cerebral atrophy on a vascular basis."

She initially presented with high fever and pancytopenia, leading to a diagnosis of most severe type aplastic anemia. We treated her with cyclosporine, methylprednisolone and anti-thymocyte globulin. Thereafter she recurrently complained of a very severe headache called as thunderclap, and finally exhibited loss of consciousness. Brain imaging revealed massive parenchymal hemorrhage between the left occipital and parietal lobes on computed tomography, and diffuse cerebral vasoconstriction on magnetic resonance angiography. The cerebral vasoconstriction resolved within two months, and thus we diagnosed her as having reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome associated with brain parenchymal hemorrhage. This syndrome has been frequently reported in adult females, but rarely in children. However, even in children, a so called thunderclap headache may become a clue for the diagnosis of reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome, especially in cases taking immunosuppressive agents. Immediate magnetic resonance angiography is essential to diagnose this syndrome, and a prompt application of calcium channel inhibitors should be considered to resolve constriction of the vessels and to prevent subsequent brain damage."

Two cases of cranial base dural arteriovenous fistula, one internal carotid pseudoaneurysm and one PICA aneurysm were demonstrated utilizing the angiographic CT for obtaining significant image details on the relative location of the diseases against the neighboring bony structure. An angiography suite outfitted with conventional DSA and rotational volume cone-beam was used, angiographic CT images being concomitantly produced together with the routine angiographic modalities.

CD009372,0,12931300,0,Real-time magnetic resonance imaging for interventional neuroradiological procedures.,"Over the last two decades, interventional neuroradiologists have developed powerful techniques for the treatment of cerebrovascular disorders and brain tumors. Current interventional neuroradiological procedures are performed under X-ray fluoroscopy, which has allowed for high temporal and spatial resolution. However, these imaging techniques do not provide the treating physician with vital anatomic and functional information regarding vessel walls and the surrounding brain tissue. Better visualization of vessel structures and real-time information about the state of perfusion and metabolism of the surrounding brain tissue (real-time magnetic resonance arteriography, diffusion and perfusion-weighted imaging, apparent diffusion coefficient maps) would enhance safety and efficacy of neuroendovascular procedures available currently. Recent advances in magnetic resonance hardware and software have permitted significant enhancements in temporal and spatial resolution, which have resulted in the capability of visualizing anatomic structures with real-time fluoroscopy and angiography. This review outlines how real-time magnetic resonance procedures may replace conventional X-ray fluoroscopy in diagnostic and interventional neuroradiology during the next decade."

We hypothesized that TNF-alpha measured from brain interstitial fluid would correlate with the severity of vasospasm following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). From a consecutive series of 10 aSAH patients who underwent cerebral microdialysis (MD) and evaluation of vasospasm by CT angiogram (CTA) or digital subtraction angiography (DSA), TNF-alpha levels from MD were measured at 8-hour intervals from aSAH days 4-6 using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. An attending neuroradiologist blinded to the study independently evaluated each CTA and DSA and assigned a vasospasm index (VI). Five patients had a VI<2 and 5 patients had a VI>2, where the median VI was 2 (range 0-13). The median log TNF-alpha area under the curve (AUC) was 1.64pg/mL *day (interquartile range 1.48-1.71) for the VI<2 group, and 2.11pg/mL *day (interquartile range 1.95-2.47) for the VI>2 group (p<0.01). Thus, in this small series of poor-grade aSAH patients, the AUC of TNF-alpha levels from aSAH days 4-6 correlates with the severity of radiographic vasospasm. Further analysis in a larger population is warranted based on our preliminary findings."

A 44-year-old female slipped and hit her head without loss of consciousness, one month ago. Recently she complained of headaches and visited the department of Neurosurgery, Washokai Sadamoto Hospital on May 21, 1985. There were no physical and neurological signs on examination. Plain CT scans showed a crescent-shaped high density area in the left frontal region with a slight mass sign. She was diagnosed as having a possible chronic subdural hematoma and further examination was recommended. Biplane ultrafast overlapping cerebral computed angiotomograms clearly demonstrated a so-called avascular area delineated by enhanced superficial cerebral vessels with contrast medium. Furthermore, a marked high density mass measuring 8 mm X 10 mm X 6 mm in diameters was simultaneously demonstrated around the right anterior clinoid process on the same image, suggesting a cerebral aneurysm. Right carotid angiograms showed a right internal carotid-posterior communicating junction aneurysm. The irrigation of the left chronic subdural hematoma was carried out on May 24 and the neck clipping of the right IC-PC junction aneurysm was done two weeks later. During the operation, there were no findings suggesting a previous subarachnoid hemorrhage from the aneurysm, but a bleb was found on the aneurysm. The post-operative course was uneventful. Since the introduction of the CT scanner, chronic subdural hematomas are usually operated without cerebral angiograms.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD009372,0,3258719,0,MR imaging in the management of supratentorial intracranial AVMs.,"The MR images, CT scans, and angiograms of 15 consecutive patients with intracranial, supratentorial arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) were studied retrospectively. The three imaging techniques were evaluated separately to assess their utility in defining the size, characteristics, and location of the AVM nidus, its arterial supply, and venous drainage. The studies were also evaluated for their ability to show associated parenchymal abnormalities, the presence of mass effect, and changes occurring after embolization. MR was superior to both CT and angiography in showing the exact anatomic relationships of the nidus, feeding arteries, and draining veins, as well as in demonstrating the extent of AVM nidus obliteration after embolization. MR was more sensitive than CT in revealing associated parenchymal abnormalities and subacute hemorrhage. Because of flow-related artifacts and low sensitivity in distinguishing calcification from rapid flow and/or hemosiderin, MR seemed to have a low sensitivity for detecting old hemorrhage within an AVM nidus. Angiography is still needed in the planning of either surgical or endovascular treatment of AVMs."

The patient suffered disturbed consciousness on the day after the examination, and was admitted to our emergency centre. A CT scan and magnetic resonance imaging revealed an ischaemic lesion in the left basal ganglia, suggesting deep sinus occlusion. Anticoagulant therapy was administered. One day after admission, a CT scan showed a haematoma and severe brain swelling in the same region. Cerebral angiography demonstrated a straight sinus occlusion.

CD009372,0,16093385,0,Imaging experimental cerebral malaria in vivo: significant role of ischemic brain edema.,"The first in vivo magnetic resonance study of experimental cerebral malaria is presented. Cerebral involvement is a lethal complication of malaria. To explore the brain of susceptible mice infected with Plasmodium berghei ANKA, multimodal magnetic resonance techniques were applied (imaging, diffusion, perfusion, angiography, spectroscopy). They reveal vascular damage including blood-brain barrier disruption and hemorrhages attributable to inflammatory processes. We provide the first in vivo demonstration for blood-brain barrier breakdown in cerebral malaria. Major edema formation as well as reduced brain perfusion was detected and is accompanied by an ischemic metabolic profile with reduction of high-energy phosphates and elevated brain lactate. In addition, angiography supplies compelling evidence for major hemodynamics dysfunction. Actually, edema further worsens ischemia by compressing cerebral arteries, which subsequently leads to a collapse of the blood flow that ultimately represents the cause of death. These findings demonstrate the coexistence of inflammatory and ischemic lesions and prove the preponderant role of edema in the fatal outcome of experimental cerebral malaria. They improve our understanding of the pathogenesis of cerebral malaria and may provide the necessary noninvasive surrogate markers for quantitative monitoring of treatment."

In Portugal we still do not have reliable statistics regarding the occurrence of the subarachnoid hemorrhage, however we can make a comparison through Kassel's and Drake's studies where they refer that annually 28,000 North-Americans suffer from subarachnoid hemorrhage attributed to the rupture of the cerebral aneurysm. This is a clinical situation that needs to be analyzed, more so because if it is not diagnosed and treated in time, it can cause a high level of morbidity and mortality. From 1984 to 1990, the authors studied 208 clinical cases of in-patients at the Santa Maria Hospital who had been diagnosed as having subarachnoid hemorrhage-cerebral aneurysm. They analyzed 172 cranium-encephalic Tomographies and 190 cerebral Angiographies. They found levels that overlapped the series already published with respect to the location of the lesion, dimensions and age groups involved. They tried to relate the presence aneurysm in the willis arterial circle with the occurrence of locoregional anatomic variants that were detected in 51% of the patients with aneurysm of the anterior communicating artery and in 33% of the cases in the posterior communicating artery. The high occurrence of serious forms of tomodensitrometric presentation should also be emphasized. As a matter of fact, 42.6% of the patients studied were grouped in degree IV of the Fisher Scale. This result translates the effort that is still required towards an early clinical and imaging diagnosis of warning hemorrhage to avoid or prevent a catastrophic hemorrhage recurrence."
CD009372,0,15045615,0,Neuroradiological features of vertigo.,"The diagnostic pathway in a patient with vertigo starts with the accurate evaluation of medical history followed by a general physical and neurological examination. This step can often lead to the identification of the correct cause of the disease or, at least, to a distinction between peripheral and central vertigo. Neuroradiological investigations have to be considered as elective diagnostic procedures and include: computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance (MR), MR angiography (MRA), angiography. For the diagnosis of peripheral vertigo, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, labyrinthitis, Meniere disease, perilymphatic fistula, local trauma, toxic labyrinthitis, acute otitis media and chronic middle ear effusion,the role of imaging techniques is controversial. CT and MR are performed to rule out other pathologies and to confirm the diagnosis. Increased resolution and application of special MR sequences enhancing the intralabyrinthine fluids have enabled more detailed analysis of labyrinthine structures and pathology. Both T2 and T1 contrast sequences are necessary. A high resolution CT study is required when otitis media is suspected and in the follow-up of post-traumatic vertigo. The causes of central vertigo are numerous and include: vertebro-basilar circulation vascular events, multiple sclerosis (MS), migraine-associated vertigo, cerebellar and brainstem tumors, CNS infections. Among them cerebrovascular ischemia and multiple sclerosis are the most frequent. In these situations imaging studies become mandatory. CT can diagnose most cerebellar hemorrhages and some cerebellar and brainstem acute ischemia, enhanced MR has proved to be the most sensitive tool to detect posterior fossa lesion. Diffusion-weighted MR can reveal acute ischemic changes before routine MR. There has been evidence that MR angiography, providing angiogram-like images of the intracranial vessels may sometimes avoid invasive angiography. MRA resolution is not as good as traditional angiography and may also be compromised by movements and other artifacts. Selective angiography of the posterior circulation is often indicated for therapeutic decisions."

This article reviews the most recent literature on these topics, provides the reader with useful clinical tips for performing and interpreting these increasingly complex diagnostic examinations, presents illustrative cases, and looks at future developments in this vibrant area of neuroradiology research."
CD009372,0,8634493,0,Detection of vasospasm by transcranial Doppler sonography. The challenges of the anterior and posterior cerebral arteries.,"Little information exists on the utility of transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD) in detecting anterior (ACA) and posterior cerebral artery (PCA) vasospasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage. During the period at risk for vasospasm, 53 patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage who had technically adequate TCD performed within 24 hours of cerebral angiography, allowing evaluation of 87 ACAs and 84 PCAs, were studied. ACA and PCA vasospasm were defined by mean blood flow velocities of at least 120 cm/sec and at least 90 cm/sec, respectively. For detection of ACA vasospasm, sensitivity was 18% and specificity was 65%. For PCA vasospasm, sensitivity was 48% and specificity was 69%. False-positive findings for occlusion accounted for 12 (92%) of 13 ACA of false-positive results and 7 (37%) of 19 PCA false-positive results, and were most often due to anatomical factors and operator error or inexperience. After exclusion of both true-positive and false-positive findings for occlusion and changes in the diagnostic criterion to at least 130 cm/sec for ACA vasospasm and at least 110 cm/sec for PCA vasospasm, specificity improved for both types of vasospasms (100 and 93%, respectively). However, the sensitivity of TCD to detect ACA and PCA vasospasm is limited by a variety of anatomical, technical, and other factors. It is concluded that TCD is highly specific in detecting both ACA and PCA vasospasm on arteries that can be insonated."
CD009372,0,16678729,0,Carotid cavernous aneurysm presenting as pituitary apoplexy.,"The authors report an interesting case with a ruptured internal carotid artery aneurysm that presented as a sellar haematoma mimicking radiologically a pituitary adenoma, and clinically a pituitary apoplexy. A 53-year-old woman presented with a 2-week history of episodic severe headache and vomiting associated, 3 days prior to admission, with left ophthalmoparesis and transient right hemiparesis. Brain MRI showed a large intra- and suprasellar mass suggestive of a pituitary macroadenoma. Hormonal profiles showed hyperprolactinaemia and subsequent cerebral angiography demonstrated a carotid cavernous aneurysm. The patient underwent surgery via a subfrontal approach to manage both lesions. At operation, the suspected pituitary adenoma was revealed to be a sellar haematoma; the aneurysm was successfully clipped. Postoperatively, the patient developed hypotension and right hemiparesis which, as well as the third nerve paresis, progressively improved to full recovery. At 12 months follow-up the patient is neurologically intact and generally well. The clinical features, the management of such a case and the importance of differential diagnosis in the acute stage are emphasised and discussed along with relevant literature."

Special attention is paid to three imaging parameters: cerebral microangiopathy, lesion size on diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), and the role of cerebral microbleeds. Both severe cerebral microangiopathy and increasing lesion size on DWI are now established risk factors for sICH following thrombolysis, while the presence of a single or few microbleeds is not associated with a substantially elevated sICH risk."

CD009372,0,16956767,0,Loss of M5 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors leads to cerebrovascular and neuronal abnormalities and cognitive deficits in mice.,"The M5 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (M5R) has been shown to play a crucial role in mediating acetylcholine-dependent dilation of cerebral blood vessels. We show that male M5R-/- mice displayed constitutive constriction of cerebral arteries using magnetic resonance angiography in vivo. Male M5R-/- mice exhibited a significantly reduced cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, basal ganglia, and thalamus. Cortical and hippocampal pyramidal neurons from M5R-/- mice showed neuronal atrophy. Hippocampus-dependent spatial and nonspatial memory was also impaired in M5R-/- mice. In M5R-/- mice, CA3 pyramidal cells displayed a significantly attenuated frequency of the spontaneous postsynaptic current and long-term potentiation was significantly impaired at the mossy fiber-CA3 synapse. Our findings suggest that impaired M5R signaling may play a role in the pathophysiology of cerebrovascular deficits. The M5 receptor may represent an attractive novel therapeutic target to ameliorate memory deficits caused by impaired cerebrovascular function."

TCD velocity measurements provided very valuable data to assist scheduling of angiography and delayed surgery. Angiography and surgery were planned significantly sooner in the TCD examined group of patients with TCD velocities indicative for the absence of vasospasm than in the group of patients who did not have TCD examinations.

CD009372,0,7134914,0,Site of brain lesion and functional capacity in rehabilitated hemiplegics.,"Degree of motor impairment, some sensory qualities and self-care ADL were registered in 53 patients with hemisyndrome due to stroke in whom the brain lesion could be visualized by computerized tomography or by cerebral angiography. Central brain damage (internal capsule, basal ganglia, thalamus) resulted in significantly higher degree of motor impairment than neo-cortical damage, while the size of the damage apparently did not influence the motor-function. Self-care ADL was significantly associated with level of motor impairment. Moreover, significantly less final recovery of exteroception and kinesthesia was observed for lesions in the non-dominant than the dominant hemisphere. It is suggested that in patients found suited for admittance to rehabilitation wards visualization of the brain damage may be a useful adjunct when stating the goals for the rehabilitation process."
CD009372,0,20648688,0,Removal of CSF pixels on brain MR perfusion images using first several images and Otsu's thresholding technique.,"Brain MR perfusion imaging is used to evaluate local perfusion in patients with cerebral vascular disease. Quantitative measurements on the hemodynamic parameters and volume of brain with abnormal perfusion provide an estimation of the severity of the brain perfusion defect. However, quantitative measurements of these focal cerebral hemodynamic parameters are limited by the presence of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pixels. We noticed that the CSF has a higher signal than other tissue types on the first perfusion image, which is usually discarded in routine parametric image calculations. This signal difference, however, can be used to segment CSF pixels on the perfusion images. An image division was used to generate ratio images to compensate for spatially dependent signal variation caused by the inhomogeneity of excitation radiofrequency field. By applying an appropriate signal threshold to the ratio images, CSF pixels can be identified and removed from the parametric images. With the removal of CSF pixels, the volume of delayed-perfusion brain parenchyma can be better visualized and the interference from the CSF can be avoided. The proposed technique is simple, fast, automatic, and effective, and no extra scanning is needed to use this technique."
CD009372,0,23965853,0,[Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome with cortical subarachnoid hemorrhage presenting as thunderclap headache-a long followed up case].,"A 59-year-old woman presented with thunderclap headache. Cranial CT showed cortical subarachnoid hemorrhage (cSAH) at the right parietal lobe and cerebral angiography on day 5 revealed multiple cerebral arterial constriction, diagnosed as reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS). We could not detect vasoconstriction in MRA at the first examination on day 4, and vasoconstrictive finding appeared around Willis circle 8 days later. There was a temporal difference in a cephalalgic symptom and vasoconstrictive appearance. Clinical symptoms completely recovered and head CT, MRI/MRA findings were reversible after two months, reflecting a rather good RCVS outcome. However, we also followed up this case precisely using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with easy Z-score imaging system (e-ZIS), and hypoperfusion at the locus of cSAH persisted for more than one year. This finding strongly suggests that tissue damage in the cSAH locus induced by RCVS may be subclinicaly irreversible, even though clinical symptoms and abnormalities in cranial MRI and MRA completely recover.SPECT may be a high sensitive technique to detect the irreversible lesion in RCVS."

Intravenous infusion of nicardipine started before or immediately after early operation. The dosage was from 4 to 10 mg/h with an average of 7.4 mg/h. The duration was from 2 to 17 days with an average of 12.3 days. Symptomatic vasospasm was observed in only one (3%) out of 33 patients. The remaining 32 patients (97%) showed neither ischemic symptoms nor low-density areas on computed tomography. Severe angiographical vasospasm was diagnosed in 3 patients, who entered hospital on day 3 to 5 after initial attacks. They were operated upon on day 4 to 6 under the administration of nicardipine before or immediately after the operation. No patients showed symptomatic vasospasm and angiographical vasospasm was improved markedly. The present study demonstrated that high dose nicardipine appeared to prevent both brain ischemia and angiographical vasospasm after aneurysmal SAH."
CD009372,0,22209646,0,Intraprocedural prediction of hemorrhagic cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome after carotid artery stenting.,"Hyperperfusion syndrome (HPS) is a rare but severe complication after carotid artery stenting (CAS). Reliable methods for predicting HPS remain to be developed. We aimed to establish a predictive value of hemorrhagic HPS after CAS. Our retrospective study included 136 consecutive patients who had undergone CAS. We determined the cerebral circulation time (CCT) by measuring the interval between the point of maximal opacification of the terminal portion of the internal carotid artery and the cortical vein. We calculated intraprocedural CCT changes (ΔCCT) by subtracting postprocedural CCT values from preprocedural CCT values. The mean ΔCCT was 0.9 ± 0.9 seconds; 3 patients (2.2%) with prolonged ΔCCT (2.7, 5.4, and 5.8 seconds) developed HPS. The cutoff time of 2.7 seconds predicted hemorrhagic HPS retrospectively with 100% sensitivity and 99% specificity. Our findings suggest that post-CAS HPS can be predicted by using the ΔCCT value obtained by intraprocedural digital subtraction angiography. Patients with a ΔCCT >2.7 seconds require careful intensive hemodynamic and neurologic monitoring after CAS."

CD009372,0,21273754,0,Subarachnoid hemorrhage caused by pilocytic astrocytoma--case report.,"A 20-year-old woman presented with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) in the frontal interhemispheric fissure, and a cystic lesion in the left frontal lobe. Cerebral angiography demonstrated no aneurysm or vascular abnormalities. T(1)-weighted magnetic resonance imaging with contrast medium revealed an enhanced lesion along the falx. The lesion and cyst were removed, and histological examination revealed a pilocytic astrocytoma. Spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage from pilocytic astrocytoma is rare, with only 15 reported cases mostly involving intratumoral hemorrhage in the parenchyma of hypothalamic and cerebellar tumors. SAH caused by cerebral hemisphere pilocytic astrocytoma is extremely rare. This case suggests that interhemispheric fissure SAH, not associated with aneurysm or abnormal vascularity, could originate from small, low-grade glioma in the superficial cerebral hemisphere."
CD009372,0,19289288,0,Fenestration of the middle cerebral artery with an associated ruptured aneurysm.,"Intracranial arterial fenestrations are uncommon developmental anomalies that may alter local hemodynamic stress patterns and may be associated with intracranial aneurysms. A 75-year-old woman presented with a mild subarachnoid hemorrhage. Cerebral angiography demonstrated a 5 mm aneurysm arising from the middle cerebral artery (MCA) associated with a dramatic fenestration of the proximal M1 segment of the MCA. The patient underwent craniotomy with microsurgical aneurysm clipping. The aneurysm arose immediately distal to the fenestration. Several fine perforating arteries were dissected away from the neck of the aneurysm to allow for safe clip placement. Postoperatively, the patient awoke without deficit and was discharged to home on the fifth postoperative day in good condition. Anomalies of the intracranial vasculature are common and we describe a rare proximal MCA fenestration with an associated ruptured aneurysm at the site of the fenestration. Neurosurgeons should be thoroughly familiar with such potential ""normal variants"" to avoid operative complications that may result from the anomalous circulation in such cases."

The right internal auditory canal was enlarged. Four-vessel angiography disclosed neither an aneurysm nor an arteriovenous malformation. A right suboccipital craniectomy revealed an encapsulated mass 3 cm in diameter in the right cerebellopontine angle. The tumor was totally removed. Histological examination revealed a typical neurinoma composed of Antoni type A and B cells.

CD009372,0,23824352,0,[A rare case of developmental venous anomaly with diffuse arteriovenous shunt in the posterior fossa presented as massive cerebellar hemorrhage].,"Developmental venous anomalies(DVAs), that have been previously called venous malformation, are extreme variations of normal transmedullary veins that are necessary for the drainage of white and gray matter. They are becoming the most commonly encountered intracranial vascular lesions in central nervous system imaging. Most DVAs are asymptomatic or uncomplicated, and surgery is no longer considered necessary. The author describes a rare case of an 8-year-old patient presenting with massive cerebellar hemorrhage due to DVA with diffuse arteriovenous(A-V)shunt. Cerebral angiography demonstrated diffuse A-V shunt from the basilar artery runs into the bilateral basal vein of Rosenthal through the enlarged transpontine vein. Caput medusae-like appearance was visualized, although the finding of nidus was not obvious. Moreover, three-dimensional computed tomography angiography demonstrated stenosis in part of the drainage routes. Then, we supposed that this lesion was a transitional form between a DVA and an arteriovenous malformation, and massive cerebellar hemorrhage might be caused by secondary venous hypertension due to venous stenosis. A careful follow-up should be made, because the prognosis of DVA with A-V shunt has not been fully elucidated."

The medical records of 92 patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease attended during the period from 1985 to 2003 were reviewed. The following data were recorded: age at diagnosis, gender, associated clinical manifestations, occurrence of stroke, age at loss of renal function (beginning of dialysis), and presence of a family history. The involvement of abdominal viscera was investigated by ultrasonography. Intracranial alterations were prospectively investigated by magnetic resonance angiography in 42 asymptomatic patients, and complemented with digital subtraction arteriography when indicated. Mean age at diagnosis was 35.1 +/- 14.9 years, and mean serum creatinine at referral was 2.4 +/- 2.8 mg/dL. The most frequent clinical manifestations during the disease were arterial hypertension (63.3%), lumbar pain (55.4%), an abdominal mass (47.8%), and urinary infection (35.8%). Loss of renal function occurred in 27 patients (mean age: 45.4 +/- 9.5 years). The liver was the second organ most frequently affected (39.1%). Stroke occurred in 7.6% of the patients. Asymptomatic intracranial aneurysm was detected in 3 patients and arachnoid cysts in 3 other patients. In conclusion, the most common clinical features were lumbar pain, arterial hypertension, abdominal mass, and urinary infection, and the most serious complications were chronic renal failure and stroke.

CD009372,0,9117074,0,Severe stroke.,"Severe stroke is an emergency and requires rapid neurological assessment and diagnosis. CT scan is the first diagnostic step with the aim of finding out the extent, localization and possible pathophysiology of ischaemia in order to direct specific diagnostic and therapeutic options. An intracranial haemorrhage must be excluded. Early CT signs, including the size of the hypodensity and brain swelling, are important prognostic markers. Extracranial and transcranial Doppler sonography are valid for primary assessment of vascular pathophysiology and haemodynamics in most cases. Cerebral angiography should be performed if acute occlusion of the basilar artery or middle cerebral artery trunk is suspected and intra-arterial thrombolysis is a potential therapy. Intravenous thrombolyis has been proven to be effective in improving outcome in severe stroke; it is safe if the exclusion criteria are strictly applied. Prevention of secondary complications of stroke include general medical treatment with control of blood pressure, infections and cardiac and respiratory function, anti-coagulation. anti-oedematous treatment and surgical decompressive therapy for cerebellar and MCA space-occupying infarcts. Monitoring in the ICU is recommended. The medical therapy of intracerebral haemorrhage consists of control of ventilation and blood pressure, seizure prevention and anti-oedema treatment. Treatment of secondary ICH due to anti-coagulation or thrombolysis consists of administration of specific antidotes and the correction of the coagulopathy. Ventricular drainage should be performed when there is marked ventricular dilatation due to obstruction or blood in the ventricles. Most patients with cerebellar haemorrhage of more than 3 cm in diameter should undergo surgery to avoid brain-stem compression and hydrocephalus. In younger patients, non-dominant hemisphere putaminal and lobar haemorrhages with lateral displacement of midline structures and extensive oedema should be evacuated if the patient's level of consciousness deteriorates rapidly, or if the elevation of ICP cannot be controlled pharmacologically, and herniation is incipient. New techniques such as stereotactic and endoscopic evacuation still need to be tested prospectively. Patient selection for surgery should be cautious considering age, clinical status and possible contraindications such as cerebral amyloid angiopathy and coagulation disorders. Stroke therapy is rapidly becoming a focus of research and major changes in diagnostic and therapeutic options can therefore be expected."
CD009372,0,16267665,0,Clinical evaluation of bone-subtraction CT angiography (BSCTA) in head and neck imaging.,"Fifty-one patients were examined with bone subtraction CT angiography (BSCTA). Data were acquired on 4-and 64-slice spiral CT systems. The post-processing method is based on fully automatic registration of non-enhanced and contrast-enhanced CT data and subsequent selective bone removal. Vascular structures and brain tissue are retained with the original CTA noise level. Image quality and delineation of the pathologic process were assessed and artifacts introduced by the bone removal process recorded. The bone subtraction algorithm worked successfully in all examinations. The processing time was 6 min on average. Image quality was rated excellent in 20 (39%), good in 26 (51%) and acceptable in 5 (10%) patients. Ophthalmic arteries were visible in 12 (24%) patients bilaterally, in 13 (25%) patients unilaterally and in 26 (51%) patients at least at the origin. BSCTA improved visualization of the infraclinoid ICA and the vertebral arteries. The depiction of stenosis of the extracranial ICA and supraclinoid aneurysms was not significantly improved. In patients with suspicion of sinus thrombosis, BSCTA and conventional CTA yielded similar results. To conclude, BSCTA improves the visualization of vessels with close contact to bone and can improve the diagnostic accuracy and therapy planning of infraclinoid aneurysms."

CD009372,0,10540722,0,[Cases of cavernous hemangioma discovered in patients with post traumatic intracerebral hematoma].,"Cavernous haemangioma has various forms. The cases with spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage are most common, but post-traumatic intracerebral haematoma was not reported. The aim of this report is to present cases of cavernous haemangioma with unusual clinical course. In seven patients with post-traumatic intracerebral haematoma, fragments of histologically confirmed cavernous haemangioma tissue situated in the place of haematoma were found. In one case, delayed intracerebral haematoma twenty four hours after trauma and initial CT-scan was observed. On the initial CT-scan in this patient only traumatic changes in the brain without haematoma or tumour were present. In our cases, cavernous haemangioma was situated most frequently in frontal and temporal region, shown as haematoma usually 24 hours after trauma, mainly in men in age range 30-44 years with disorders of consciousness (GCS 11). As the result of operation, the majority of patients (6 out of 7) were discharged as self-independent. The authors reviewed the literature for cavernous haemangioma. The tumour may be present in any region of the brain including infratentorial region. The lesion is disclosed most frequently in children as spontaneous brain haemorrhage and rarely as seizures or intracranial hypertension. Final diagnosis is based on cerebral angiography or MRI. CT-scans are not typical and before the appearance of haematoma do not suggest the presence of tumour. Surgical removal of haematoma with tumour fragments is the main method of therapy, but radiation is possible in order to diminish the mass. The authors conclude that in each patient with post-traumatic intracerebral haematoma, the presence of cavernous haemangioma is possible."

MR angiography was technically satisfactory in 20 of the 23 patients and documented patency of the right internal carotid artery proximal to the ophthalmic artery in nine of 16 patients with permanent carotid ligation and in all four patients with reanastomosis. This study suggests MR angiography is feasible in newborns and infants and that, in combination with parenchymal MR imaging, it provides a sensitive, noninvasive method to assess vessel patency and follow cerebrovascular and parenchymal changes in infants after ECMO."
CD009372,0,3875699,0,Intraventricular hemorrhage in a term neonate secondary to a third ventricular AVM. Case report.,"An initially healthy infant born of an uncomplicated full-term gestation was brought for evaluation of the acute onset of vomiting, irritability, lethargy, and opisthotonus at 14 days of age. Computerized tomography demonstrated an intraventricular hemorrhage. Arteriography defined an angioma on the roof of the third ventricle which was successfully removed via the transcallosal interfornicial approach on the 34th day of life. Other than an easily controlled seizure disorder, the postoperative course was uneventful. At 8 months of age the child is developing normally. Arteriovenous malformations should be considered in the differential diagnosis of intraventricular hemorrhage in full-term neonates without predisposing trauma or bleeding diathesis. High-speed digital subtraction arteriography may be used to screen for this diagnosis. The transcallosal interfornicial exposure offers a satisfactory approach for excising third ventricular angiomas in young infants."
CD009372,0,10203099,0,Role of positron emission tomography in determining the extent of CNS ischemia in patients with sickle cell disease.,"Nearly 25% of patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) experience central nervous system morbidity involving both large and small vessel disease. Optimal imaging methods for determining the extent of ischemia are not known. Positron emission tomography (PET) has the unique ability to show tissue function as well as structure. Reports concerning patients with non-SCD neurodegenerative disorders suggest PET may be useful in determining prognosis. We compared magnetic resonance imaging, magnetic resonance angiography, and neuropsychological testing with PET prospectively. Six patients with SCD and a history of stroke, aged 10 to 28, were enrolled. PET studies were performed on an ECAT HR 47 scanner (Siemens/CTI, Knoxville, TN) using 18-F-fluorodeoxyglucose as a tracer. PET interpretations were conducted in blinded fashion. MRI studies found two patients with only small vessel disease and four with both large and small vessel disease. In two of four subjects with large vessel disease, PET showed a corresponding metabolic abnormality and also identified an area of hypometabolism extending beyond the anatomical lesion as shown by MRI. PET did not demonstrate an abnormality corresponding with small vessel disease. Detailed neuropsychological testing demonstrated cognitive dysfunction in all cases. For some patients, PET may add sensitivity in detecting impaired metabolism in the area surrounding a major vessel infarct. However, the technique does not appear to be generally useful in characterizing small watershed or deep white matter infarcts. Larger studies, to include control subjects and carefully selected untransfused SCD patients, are needed. A combination of conventional imaging and neuropsychological testing remains the preferred evaluation for most SCD patients with neurologic symptoms."
CD009372,0,7885013,0,[Neurological complications in infectious endocarditis].,"Despite considerable progress in both diagnostic studies and therapeutic management serious complications of infectious endocarditis have become rather more common. Next to intracardiac complications arterial embolization to the central nervous system is the second most common life-threatening event, which might lead to infarction, hemorrhage, mycotic aneurysm and/or metastatic infection with a wide spectrum of neurological symptoms and an overall very poor prognosis. The most effective prevention of neurological complications is the early diagnosis of infectious endocarditis with isolation of the infecting agent and adequate antimicrobial chemotherapy in combination with well-timed cardiosurgical measures. Computed tomography and cerebral angiography is mandatory in any patient with neurological symptoms to check the need for a neurosurgical intervention as well as in patients assigned for anticoagulation for cardiac reasons."
CD009372,0,10102319,0,Emergency department presentations of cerebrovascular disease in children.,"Five cases of children with cerebrovascular disease presentations to the emergency department (ED) were selected as a series to illustrate the variety of presentation of cerebrovascular disease in children. This series shows that although cerebrovascular disease in children is uncommon, it is likely that cases will occasionally present acutely to an ED. The emergency physician's role in the management of suspected acute strokes in children is that of immediate stabilization, imaging to rule out hemorrhage, other studies to rule out emergent acute disease, and timely consultation for further management. Computed tomography (CT) is useful to detect an acute hemorrhage or old ischemic lesion. Magnetic resonance imaging has superior image resolution over CT, but CT may be more practical initially. Magnetic resonance angiography is a useful part of the stroke workup in children."

The most significant Doppler findings of the middle cerebral artery included no detection of the artery when occlusion of the carotid siphon or the middle cerebral artery at its origin was shown by angiography and reduced flow velocities and asymmetry (symptomatic less than asymptomatic) when the occlusion was located in the terminal tract of the middle cerebral artery mainstem or in numerous terminal branches. Higher flow velocities in the anterior cerebral artery or posterior cerebral artery, mostly in the symptomatic hemisphere, often accompanied middle cerebral artery pathology, probably indicating collateral compensatory pathways."
CD009372,0,7719689,0,Case report: radiation-induced vasculopathy implicated by depressed blood flow and metabolism in a pineal glioma.,"A case of radiation-induced vasculopathy of a pineal glioma was presented with haemodynamic and metabolic changes before and after radiotherapy. After radiation of 60 Gy with conventional fractionation (1.8-2.0 Gy daily, 5 days per week), regional blood flow, oxygen extraction fraction, metabolic rate of oxygen, kinetic metabolic rate of glucose and the rate constants (K2, K3) were markedly depressed (20% or greater) compared with the pre-irradiated study. 7 months after radiotherapy, the patient developed transient transient episodes of both right and left upper limb convulsion, terminating in generalized convulsion. When she developed status epilepticus, computed tomography showed extensive low density areas in the territory supplied by the right middle cerebral and the right posterior cerebral arteries. Cerebral angiography revealed diffuse stenosis at both carotid bifurcations and at the origins of the right posterior communicating and posterior cerebral arteries. Haemodynamic and metabolic depression therefore implicated radiation-induced vasculopathy in the present case."
CD009372,0,7351580,0,Efficacy of transfusion therapy for one to two years in patients with sickle cell disease and cerebrovascular accidents.,"Since 1974 we have entered 12 children with sickle cell disease and strokes on a transfusion protocol to maintain hemoglobin S less than 20%. Serial arteriography, EEGs, brain or CT scans, and neuropsychologic testing were also obtained. Transfusion has been stopped in ten patients after one to two years. Seven of these ten patients have had second strokes five weeks to 11 months after cessation of transfusion (median three months). Arteriography was normal at the time of the initial stroke in two patients; one of these had a second stroke. Arteriograms did not improve during transfusion therapy. EEGs and brain and CT scans were occasionally useful at the time of the initial stroke but were of little value in following these patients. Neuropsychologic testing indicated severe impairment of sensory-motor and cognitive processes at the time of the initial stroke and was useful in following improvement or deterioration and in designing remedial education programs. We conclude that short-term transfusion therapy will not prevent second strokes once transfusion is stopped and that arteriography is of limited value in these patients."
CD009372,0,7064602,0,[Technic of ultrasonic dopplerography in the diagnosis of occlusive lesions of the arteries of the base of the brain (doppleroangiographic study)].,"Use was made for the first time of the ultrasonic dopplerography method for diagnosing occlusions of the brain base arteries in patients with cerebrovascular diseases. For this purpose a functional-compression examination technique was developed that enabled one to evaluate indirectly the patency of the intracranial arteries. Dopplerographic criteria of occlusions of individual arteries were determined. A comparison of the diagnosis made with the use of the ultrasonic dopplerography with the data of subsequent cerebral angiography showed that the results coincided in 83.3% of occlusions in the basilar arteries; 90% of occlusions in the terminal parts of the vertebral arteries: 90% of occlusions in the anterior and posterior communicating arteries; 86% of occlusions of internal carotid arteries in the siphon region, and 80% of occlusion of the median cerebral arteries. The results obtained give one grounds to recommend the ultrasonic dopplerography for practical use as a simple and sufficiently reliable method for diagnosing occlusions of the brain basin arteries."
CD009372,0,9297930,0,Cerebral arteriovenous malformations in children: neuroimaging findings.,"Cerebral arteriovenous malformations (CAVMs) are uncommon in children. CAVMs represent the most frequent intracranial vascular pathology at pediatric ages. This report concerns 13 children below the age of 16; all were identified between September 1995 and December 1996 with 14 CAVMs among them. All were proved by conventional cerebral angiography (CCA). Thirteen computed tomography (CT), 7 magnetic resonance images (MRI), 2 magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and 13 conventional cerebral angiography (CCA) were analyzed. Most CAVMs nidus were located in cerebral hemispheres. Four in the temporal lobe, two in the parietal lobe, three in the frontal lobe, two in the occipital lobe, and three in the corpus callosum. One of them was of a mixed type with two nidi. The major clinical features of CAVMs were intracranial hemorrhage and seizures. Experience here was that MRI is superior to CT in showing the exact anatomic relationships of the nidus and in demonstrating the extent of CAVMs nidus obliteration after treatment. MRA provided a noninvasive means of studying blood vessels and vascular pathology in relationship to the CAVMs nidus. Standard angiography is still necessary to characterize in-flow and out-flow of vessels in CAVMs when definitive treatment is considered."

CD009372,0,20450093,0,[Pitfall in the interpretation of head CT and CT angiography].,"With the continuous increase in the volume of clinical imaging data continues to increase, there is an increasing demand for efficient and the capable people who can make accurate diagnosis on the basis of imaging findings. In general, errors in the interpretation of routine brain imaging, which is used as a screening tool, can be categorized as either perceptual or cognitive. Minimizing errors in the image interpretation is extremely essential for superior diagnostic and patient care. While performing head CT, it is important to consider the anatomical site and imaging aspects that may lead to false-positive and true-negative interpretation. In this manuscript, we discuss and present example of the various pitfalls of interpreting head CT images. With the knowledge of the process of image interpretation process, it is important to evaluate symmetrical findings such as brain edema, the median site such as the para-sellar region, the superior and inferior border images, and beam hardening artifact of the posterior fossa. In addition, CT angiography is being widely used as diagnostic tool for the cerebrovascular disease such as intracranial aneurysm. In this manuscript, we discuss the precaution that should be taken during the diagnosis of intracranial aneurysm with CT angiography findings."

CD009372,0,3431694,0,"Size determination of supratentorial arteriovenous malformations by MR, CT and angio.","Twenty patients with high-flow supratentorial arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) were studied by magnetic resonance imaging (MR), computed tomography (CT), and selective cerebral angiography. The size of the malformation measured on MR was found, in general, to be smaller than the size determined from angiographic films. This discrepancy increased as the size of the AVM increased. AVM size on CT and angiography was found to be essentially equivalent. The reason for these differences between MR and CT or angiography was the ability to separate out the draining veins by MR, whereas this was difficult on projection films and contrast enhanced CT. Calcification was more easily detected by CT than by MR. MR better detected hemorrhage, which could be mistaken for old infarction on CT. Foci of cystic change within the nidus of the AVM were equally evident on MR and CT. Due to its sensitivity in discriminating between AVM nidus and adjacent draining veins and MR's ability to show the AVM in three planes, MR appeared to be more accurate in defining the AVM nidus than either CT or cerebral angiography. Such accurate delineation is crucial in patients prior to stereotactic radiosurgery."
CD009372,0,3652067,0,Rare neonatal intracerebral hemorrhage. Two cases in full-term infants.,"Intracranial hemorrhage in neonates is often found in either the subependymal area or the subdural space. The former is observed particularly in premature infants and is attributable to damage of the germinal matrix layer. The latter usually occurs in the vicinity of the falx and tentorium cerebri of full-term neonates and is thought to be caused by birth injury. Two cases of intracerebral hemorrhage in full-term newborn babies are reported. In both the hematoma was located at the left frontal area under the coronal suture. Angiograms revealed no causative signs, such as arteriovenous malformation, aneurysm or angioma. Observations on CT scans and during surgery led to the conclusion that the hemorrhages were caused by the moulding which forced the frontal bone to slip under the parietal bone at the coronal suture and then press on the fragile cerebral vasculature of the neonates, thus causing contusion."

CD009372,0,20950938,0,Factor XIII deficiency related recurrent spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage: a case and literature review.,"Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) in young adults under 50 years of age is an uncommon occurrence associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. The differential diagnosis of ICH in this population differs from that of older individuals and includes vascular, toxic, inflammatory, oncologic, infectious and hematologic conditions. We present a case based observation of a spontaneous and recurrent ICH in a 25-year-old female secondary to undetected Factor XIII (FXIII) deficiency with no prior associated stigmata of hematologic disturbance admitted to a tertiary care neuroscience intensive care unit (NICU). Our patient was admitted after spontaneous development of left thalamic hemorrhage with ventricular extension. Initial management included external drain placement (EVD) and fresh frozen plasma administration. Diagnostic evaluation was unrevealing including CT angiography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with venography, conventional cerebral angiogram, and hematologic and rheumatologic screens. Our patient recovered but represented 6 months later with five foci of spontaneous ICH. She underwent vascular, infectious, oncologic, hematologic, and rheumatologic evaluations. She expired secondary to ICH expansion with uncal herniation. The results of our investigation revealed markedly diminished FXIII activity. The pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment of this disease are reviewed. FXIII deficiency should be considered in a case of cryptogenic ICH presenting with multifocal, recurrent ICH and a normal coagulation profile. Early diagnosis and initiation of factor replacement therapy offer the best strategies to reduce the morbidities associated with this disease."
CD009372,0,1933499,0,Multiple intracerebral cavernous angiomas.,"Eight patients (seven women and one man) with multiple intracerebral cavernous angiomas (cavernomas), also known as angiomatosis cerebri, were examined with high-field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Although previous articles have referred to such cases, a series similar to the one reported here has apparently not been described in the radiology literature. The patients presented with seizures, progressive neurologic deficit or cerebral hemorrhage. In all eight cases the multiplicity of the lesions was an incidental finding in the magnetic resonance images. The MRI appearance of the cavernomas, although characteristic, is similar to that of other angiographically occult intracranial vascular malformations, in particular thrombosed arteriovenous malformations and mixed vascular malformations, as well as that of hemorrhagic metastases. Additional criteria, such as the absence of edema, the presence of calcifications and the temporal evolution of the cavernomas on serial scans, should allow cavernomas to be differentiated from hemorrhagic metastases. The exquisite sensitivity in detecting angiomatosis cerebri and the ability to show the evolution of internal hemorrhage in individual lesions make MRI the method of choice for diagnosing and following this condition."

Currently, the evaluation of cerebrovascular disorders involving arteriovenous shunting or retrograde flow is accomplished with conventional radiographic digital subtraction angiography, because of its high spatial and temporal resolutions. Multiphase MRA could potentially provide the same diagnostic information noninvasively, though this is technically challenging because of the inherent trade-off between signal intensity-to-noise ratio (S/N), spatial resolution, and temporal resolution in MR imaging."
CD009372,0,11305560,0,Two-dimensional thick-slice MR digital subtraction angiography for assessment of cerebrovascular occlusive diseases.,"Although spatial resolution of current MR angiography is excellent, temporal resolution has remained unsatisfactory. We evaluated clinical applicability of 2D thick-slice, contrast-enhanced subtraction MR angiography (2D-MR digital subtraction angiography) with sub-second temporal resolution in cerebrovascular occlusive diseases. Twenty-five patients with cerebrovascular occlusive diseases (8 moyamoya diseases, 10 proximal internal carotid occlusions, and 2 sinus thromboses ) were studied with a 1.5-T MR unit. The MR digital subtraction angiography (MRDSA) was performed per 0.97 s continuously just after a bolus injection of 15 ml of gadolinium chelates up to 40 s in sagittal (covering hemisphere) or coronal planes. Subtraction images were generated at a workstation. We evaluated imaging quality and hemodynamic information of MRDSA in comparison with those of routine MR imaging, non-contrast MR angiography, and X-ray intra-arterial DSA. Major cerebral arteries, all of the venous sinuses, and most tributaries were clearly visualized with 2D MRDSA. Also, pure arterial phases were obtained in all cases. The MRDSA technique demonstrated prolonged circulation in sinus thromboses, distal patent lumen of proximal occlusion, and some collateral circulation. Such hemodynamic information was comparable to that of intra-arterial DSA. Two-dimensional thick-slice MRDSA with high temporal resolution has a unique ability to demonstrate cerebral hemodynamics equivalent to that of intra-arterial DSA and may play an important role for evaluation of cerebrovascular occlusive diseases."

We aimed to determine if a change in the plain radiographic appearances of the GDC ball could accurately predict the presence of unstable angiographic occlusion. Paired GDC radiographs (in two planes) and cerebral angiograms, performed immediately after treatment and at follow-up or at two consecutive follow-up examinations, were retrospectively compared. Radiographs were assessed for the radiographic change (loosening, compaction or reorientation) in the coil-ball and angiograms for unstable aneurysm occlusion (neck recurrence or deteriorating occlusion). We compared 49 paired films from 38 patients. Radiographic change in the coil ball had a negative predictive value of 96%, positive predictive value of 57% and accuracy of 76% for the presence of angiographic aneurysm instability. It may be possible to increase the interval between follow-up angiographic examinations after GDC treatment safely if there is no change in the radiographic appearances in two planes."

Plain CT scans revealed the right thalamic hemorrhage with ventricular penetration. Cerebral angiography demonstrated the characteristic appearance of moyamoya disease with a peripheral artery aneurysm in the territory of the right medial posterior choroidal artery. This aneurysm ruptured three times during 8 days since onset and the thalamic hemorrhage became larger on each occasion. Although the clinical symptoms and signs and plain CT scans disclosed thalamic hemorrhage, it was difficult to explain the cause of the hemorrhage. The authors emphasize that cerebral angiography and enhanced CT scans are quite necessary to clarify the genesis of cerebrovascular disease."

These are readily available should the early visualisation of affected territories be needed. Morphological changes include the depiction of oedema on T1- and T2-weighted images, and metabolic changes are reflected on magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Functional changes reflect haemodynamic failure seen on diffusion- and perfusion-weighted imaging. Modelling of behaviour of T2 and diffusion changes could predict the histological outcome of affected tissue regarding cell recovery on necrosis.

The cerebral angiography procedure may have caused the tumoral edema and intracranial hemorrhage because computed tomography on admission revealed the right convexity meningioma as slightly low density compared to before the hemorrhage. Administration of contrast medium is known to cause complications involving microcirculatory collapse and blood-brain barrier dysfunction associated with brain tumors.

CD009372,0,22729076,0,Acute subdural hematoma without subarachnoid hemorrhage caused by ruptured A1-A2 junction aneurysm. Case report.,"A 54-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with complaint of sudden headache. The patient had suffered two episodes of transient headache before admission. Computed tomography (CT) revealed acute subdural hematoma (ASDH) on the right side of the cerebral convexity with bilateral extension along the tentorium cerebelli without signs of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) or intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Three-dimensional CT angiography and conventional cerebral angiography revealed a left A1-A2 junction aneurysm. Neck clipping of the aneurysm was performed. The aneurysm extended inferiorly, with the dome embedded in the chiasmatic cistern and tightly adhered to the arachnoid membrane. There was no evidence of hematoma in the subarachnoid space. The patient was discharged without neurological deficit. Ruptured aneurysms resulting in ASDH without SAH or ICH are very rare. Radiological investigation such as three-dimensional CT angiography should be performed to find the causative aneurysm in a patient with ASDH with a history of repeated headaches and without traumatic signs or episodes, and the appropriate treatment should be planned with expediency."

The diagnostic sensitivity of CT was higher. The considerable prognostic importance of the degree of consciousness disturbances and their duration is stressed. In the group of patients with lucidum intervallum the mortality was higher. Four patients were treated conservatively since CT demonstrated in them only small haematomas without displacement of the ventricles.

CD009372,0,9409437,0,Hemorrhagic type moyamoya disease.,"The clinical picture of hemorrhagic type Moyamoya disease was analyzed in 20 cases. Hematoma at the basal ganglia was noted in 40% of cases, intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) in 30%, thalamic hemorrhage with ventricular rupture in 15% and subcortical hemorrhage in 5%. The location was undetermined in two cases (10%) due to bleeding in the pre-computed tomography (CT) era. The frequencies shown above were correlated well to previous reports. In magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed 1 year or more after IVH, the primary bleeding site was demonstrated at the lateral wall of lateral ventricle, in portion density weighted and T2 weighted images. MRI can detect the site of old bleeding points and its chronological change if the study is repeated. In a follow-up period of 6.2 years, 35% of the cases had rebleeding once or twice. The second bleeding occurred seven times and the third twice. IVH occurred five times and the most common, basal ganglia hematoma three times while thalamic hemorrhage once. As a result, the rate of good outcome was 60% after the first bleeding and 40% after rebleeding. The mortality rate was 5% after the first 25% after rebleedings. Factors related to rebleedings and their poorer outcome are sex (with women being more susceptible), massive ICH and early recurrence. Rebleeding worsened the outcome. Therefore, prevention of rebleeding is important. From a therapeutic viewpoint, although a close relation between rebleeding and untreated hypertension could not be established, blood pressure control is critical at the both acute and chronic stages. Bypass surgery for bleeding type of Moyamoya disease seems to be less promising than ischemic type, even though a definite answer may not be obtained from our small number of cases."

Only little is known about their natural development. They are characterized by an unpredictable course with a possibility of causing secondary intracranial hemorrhage with significant morbidity and mortality. We present two cases of traumatic pseudoaneurysms of the middle meningeal artery (MMA) treated via endovascular coil occlusion and review of literature. Pseudoaneurysms of the middle meningeal artery carry a potential risk of rupture. They can be detected via a computed tomography angiogram (CT-A). An endovascular embolization followed by catheter angiography may represent a safe treatment of traumatic middle meningeal artery pseudoaneurysms.

CD009372,0,17542541,0,Progressive perianeurysmal edema induced after endovascular coil embolization. Report of three cases and review of the literature.,"The authors report three cases of progressive vasogenic brain edema surrounding a cerebral aneurysm after endovascular coil embolization. In all three cases embolization was incomplete due to the aneurysms' large sizes and wide necks. Follow-up magnetic resonance imaging revealed de novo vasogenic brain edema surrounding the aneurysms 3 to 6 months after the initial treatment. The edema progressed in parallel with regrowth of the aneurysms. All three aneurysms were deep in the brain parenchyma and showed intramural enhancement, suggesting hemorrhage or inflammation. Each patient underwent a second embolization for the aneurysm regrowth, which resulted in improvement of the edema. Based on the findings in these cases and review of the literature, it is suggested that incomplete occlusion of larger aneurysms that are deep within the brain may lead to a disorganized intraluminal thrombosis, aneurysm pulsing, and intramural hemorrhage or inflammation, all of which are associated with brain edema following aneurysm recanalization and regrowth. It should be kept in mind that incomplete embolization of larger aneurysms may cause such malignant change and that this complication may occur after endovascular treatment."

T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) imaging demonstrated an isointense area in the left sigmoid sinus and T2-weighted imaging showed a hyperintense area reflecting the characteristics of oxyhemoglobin. MR angiography and cerebral angiography indicated occlusion of the left sigmoid sinus. After 4 days of conservative treatment, her symptoms subsided completely. Follow-up MR angiography and cerebral angiography showed recanalization of the sigmoid sinus. The MR images and MR angiograms were useful for both early diagnosis and follow-up.

The missing button sign (MBS) is defined as the absence of the ICA at the level of the foramen magnum on contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) scans. Two raters independently reviewed random CECT samples from consecutive patients with acute ischaemic stroke. A total of 399 patients with 798 carotid arteries were analysed. Rater A identified the MBS in 41 (5%) of the carotid arteries, and did not identify the MBS in 735 (92%) carotid arteries. Rater B identified the MBS in 45 (6%) of the arteries, and lack of the MBS in 731 (91%) arteries. The kappa value for agreement was 0.90 (95% CI 0.84-0.95). Compared with CT angiography, Rater A's sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for detecting proximal ICAO were 85%, 100%, 100%, and 99%, respectively, while Rater B's values were 87%, 99%, 93%, and 99%, respectively.

Relation to neuropathology and capillary ultrastructure.,"The present study investigates chronic changes in cerebral arterial vessel system, microvasculature, and brain histopathology using an adult rat model based on permanent and stepwise occlusion of four cerebral vessels. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) was performed to study chronic changes in arterial cerebral vessel system after permanent vessel occlusion. Long-lasting functional changes such as NMDA-, AMPA- and GABA(A)-receptor binding were detected in hippocampus and dentate gyrus using autoradiography. Structural changes in cerebral capillaries were investigated using light- and electron microscopy. Chronic cerebral oligemia did not cause any significant changes in the densities of excitatory glutamate and inhibitory GABA(A) receptors. By electron microscopy we could document, however, that most capillaries in vessel-occluded animals shrank, the endothelial cells were prominent with enlarged nuclei and increased cytoplasm, and the basal membrane was thickened. In contrast to the degenerative changes in brain capillaries, pronounced arterial collateralization was disclosed by DSA after chronic brain vessel occlusion. The model of chronic occlusion of four cerebral vessels is characterized by capillary degeneration and arterial collateralization proceeding in parallel. Thus, this rat model may be useful in investigations of long-lasting compensatory mechanisms contributing to cerebrovascular or neurodegenerative disorders."

However, certain conditions may not be accurately reflected by the ICD-9 codes. We assessed the accuracy of ICD-9 coding for cerebrovascular disease by comparing ICD-9 codes in an administrative database with clinical findings ascertained from medical record abstractions. We selected patients with ICD-9 diagnostic codes of 433 through 436 (in either the primary or secondary positions) from an administrative database of patients hospitalized in five academic medical centers in 1992. Medical records of the selected patients were reviewed by trained medical abstractors, and the patients' clinical conditions during the admission (stroke, TIA, asymptomatic) were recorded, as well as any history of cerebrovascular symptoms. Results of the medical record review were compared with the ICD-9 codes from the administrative database. More than 85% of those patients with the ICD-9 code 433 were asymptomatic for the index admission. More than one-third of these asymptomatic patients did not undergo either cerebral angiography or carotid endarterectomy. For ICD-9 code 434, 85% of patients were classified as having a stroke and for ICD-9 code 435, 77% had TIAs. For code 436, 77% of patients were classified as having strokes. Limiting the identifying ICD-9 code to the primary position increased the likelihood of agreement with the medical record review. The ICD-9 coding scheme may be inaccurate in the classification of patients with ischemic cerebrovascular disease. Its limitations must be recognized in the analyses of administrative databases selected by using ICD-9 codes 433 through 436."
CD009372,0,2424544,0,Cortical hypoperfusion as a possible cause of 'subcortical aphasia'.,"This study was designed to investigate whether aphasia in stroke patients with subcortical lesions ('subcortical aphasia') was due to the subcortical lesion itself or to dysfunction of cortical language zones. A consecutive series of 25 right-handed stroke patients with left hemisphere lesions verified by CT scanning were examined for aphasia in the acute stage, and two weeks, three months and six months after the insult. Cerebral angiography, CT scan and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) measurements with the 133Xe intracarotid method were performed in the acute stage. The CT scan was repeated six months later. Seven patients had lesions which involved cortical structures. All of these were severely aphasic in the acute stage and six months later. The rCBF studies showed severe reduction of flow in the infarcts; the perfusion was incompatible with tissue viability. Eighteen patients had subcortical lesions. Eight of these were midly to severely aphasic in the acute state. Recovery was always excellent. Five patients recovered completely, while 3 showed only discrete (clinically undetectable) aphasia after six months. The rCBF demonstrated low-flow areas in the cortex overlying the deep lesions, with a blood flow which was sufficient for tissue viability, but insufficient for normal tissue function (an 'ischaemic penumbra'). The blood flow was pressure dependent (showing impaired autoregulation) in these low flow areas. Ten patients with subcortical lesions were not aphasic. Their CBF was normal. The subcortical lesions were permanent on CT scan while aphasia was transient in these patients as recovery was seen within three months. It was therefore unlikely that the subcortical lesions as such were the cause of aphasia. The present findings indicate that aphasia in patients with subcortical lesions may be due to hypoperfusion and functional loss in cortical language zones. The cortical low-flow areas were invariably confined to occluded vascular territories. These territories were kept viable by collateral circulation characterized by penumbral flow and impaired autoregulation. The patients showed excellent recovery from aphasia. We suggest that the recovery of language is caused by spontaneous arterial recanalization or expansion of collaterals, giving rise to enhancement of flow in the hypoperfused cortical penumbra."

Clinical assessment by bedside evaluations is limited, especially in patients initially in poorer clinical condition or who are receiving sedative medication for whom deterioration may be more difficult to identify. Transcranial Doppler is a useful screening tool for middle cerebral artery vasospasm, with less utility in evaluating other intracranial vessels. Computed tomographic angiography correlates well with digital subtraction angiography. Computed tomographic perfusion may help predict DCI when used early or identify DCI when used later."

CD009372,0,1785389,0,[Urological management for stroke patients; relation between brain lesions and establishment of micturitional modality].,"A total of 154 stroke patients, 96 males and 58 females, were analyzed to establish the micturitional modality according to the type of detrusor function and the level of activities of daily living (ADL). All patients had only one episode of stroke attack and were checked at least one month after the onset. Localization of cerebral lesion in each patient was evaluated by neurological findings and cerebral angiography in addition to computed tomography of the brain. In the patient groups classified according to the type of detrusor function, micturitional modality was established in 50% of the patients with the underactive type, 70% of those with the overactive type and in 88% of those with normal function. This suggests that the overactive and normal type of detrusor function may not affect establishment of micturitional modality. On the other hand, when classified according to the level of ADL, none established micturitional modality in patients with poor ADL. By contrast, in the patients on higher levels of ADL who were able to transfer themselves from or to a wheel-chair without any assistance it was established in 75%, and in those who were able to gait with or without a brace upon discharged from the hospital, in 91%. It is concluded that establishment of micturitional modality in stroke patients is closely related to the level of ADL or function of lower extremities, but not to localization of the brain lesion."

First patient was a 28-year old woman on oral contraceptive treatment for a month who was referred to our Department with sudden-onset conscious level deterioration after presenting 24 hours previously with headache, vomits and hemiparesis. Computed Tomography revealed a predominant hypodense area containing hyperdense foci causing mild mass effect and midline-shift in keeping with a haemorrhagic infarction occupying almost completely the right frontal lobe. On CT, magnetic resonance (MR) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) there was a prominent tubular structure adjacent to the hematoma in keeping with a partly thrombosed vessel. Urgent craniotomy and partial hematoma evacuation was performed. Digital subtraction angiography confirmed the presence of a filling defect within the draining vein of a typical caputmedusae pattern developmental venous anomaly (DVA). Systemic anticoagulation was started and four days after surgery sedation was reversed and the patient awoke with normal conscious level although mild (4/5) hemiparesis persisted. Second patient was a 38-year old male evaluated in the Emergency Department due to tonic-clonic seizures in the left side followed by altered sensation in the same distribution. Initial CT revealed an intracranial bleed. After contrast administration there was an anomalous vessel in the same location that was confirmed angiographically represented a partly thrombosed DVA.

CD009372,0,19707002,0,Thrombosis of the superior petrosal vein mimicking brain tumor. Case report.,"A 77-year-old woman was admitted to a local hospital with a 7-day history of vertigo and nausea, followed by gait disturbance. Magnetic resonance imaging showed extensive brain edema with a hemorrhagic component in the right cerebellum. The lesion was heterogeneously enhanced after administration of contrast medium. The presumptive diagnosis was malignant glioma based on these findings, as well as the presence of mass effect and abnormal enhancement. She was referred to our hospital. However, cerebral angiography did not reveal tumor stain or arterial occlusion, but confirmed corkscrew-like venous collaterals and absence of opacification of the superior petrosal vein (SPV) and superior petrosal sinus. Topography of the brain edema was consistent with the drainage territory of the SPV. These findings suggested that the lesion was vasogenic edema caused by thrombosis of the SPV. The patient was conservatively treated without anticoagulation therapy, and the neurological and imaging abnormalities resolved spontaneously. To avoid unnecessary biopsy, thrombosis of the SPV should be considered in the differential diagnosis of infratentorial lesion mimicking brain tumors. Knowledge of the posterior fossa venous anatomy is essential to achieve the correct diagnosis."

The optic nerve, measuring 4 cm in length, was attached to the enucleated eye ball, but there was neither a wound in his eyelids nor cerebrospinal fluid leakage from inside the orbit. He was confused, but responsive and was able to recognize other persons with his right eye. His right-eye vision deteriorated within 24 hours and was almost totally lost for about one month. Three months after the trauma his vision recovered to 0.1, but his visual field showed severe concentric narrowing. An emergency CT on admission showed a small subarachnoid hemorrhage in the suprasellar cistern, and follow-up CT scanning on day 7 demonstrated a small infarction in the left globus pallidus and putamen. Cerebral angiography performed on day 17 showed residual vasospasm of the horizontal portion of left anterior cerebral artery. Left ophthalmic artery was patent and there was no aneurysm formation either on the intracranial or on the intraorbital arteries. Literature review yielded only three cases of eye ball enucleation by an assailant. Intracranial complications reported in the literature, including those associated with eye ball enucleation caused by other mechanisms, are; contralateral visual field defect: seven cases, hypothalamic involvement: two cases, subarachnoid hemorrhage: two cases, cerebrospinal fluid leakage: one case, and meningitis: one case. The optic nerve, from just behind the eye ball to the chiasm, is reported to be 40-50 mm long, and eye ball enucleation with the optic nerve measuring 4 cm or more is quite likely to cause intracranial complications such as are cited above."

Sixteen (group 1) showed lacunar capsular infarcts, and 5 (group 2) either ""giant lacunae"" or ""striatocapsular infarcts"". Angiography showed that 81% of group 1 and all group 2 patients had ipsilateral severe stenosis or occlusion of either the M1 segment of the middle cerebral artery or the internal carotid artery. Ten group 1 patients and 3 group 2 patients also had contralateral intra- or extracranial carotid artery stenosis. Apart from hypertension, other risk factors such as hyperfibrinogenaemia, polycythaemia, and low HDL-cholesterol level seem to play a role. Haemorheological abnormalities in the presence of atherostenosis at the orifice of lenticulostriate arteries and/or artery-to-artery embolism might be the cause of infarcts in the majority of the patients. A fifth of patients had recurrent large ipsilateral infarcts.

The efficiency of the ESS in the diagnosis of brain tumors and extracerebral hematomas in 295 neuroradiologically controlled cases out of an unselected number of patients during 1972-1974 is described. 3. Supratentorial brain tumors can be detected directly with the ESS by abnoramal reflections of the tumors as well as indirectly by displacement of intracranial reference structures, mainly the ventricular borders. In 239 cases of suspected brain tumor, 126 were neurodiologically confirmed as supratentorial brain tumors. Among these 126 brain tumors the correct localization was determined by the ESS in 86.5%. 4. The highest reliability of the ESS proved to be the direct demonstration of frontal tumors (93%), whereas space-occupying lesions near the midline could be shown only in 79%. Up to now there have been difficulties in the diagnosis of tumors situated near bony structures, e.g., calvarian meningiomas. 5. Subdural hematomas (56 patients) could be lateralized correctly in 93%. Hwever, direct demonstration of the border of the hematomas could be achieved only in 48,2%.

CD009372,0,3515980,0,Fibromuscular dysplasia of the carotid arteries.,"Fibromuscular disease of the carotid artery was identified in 30 patients, which represented 3.2 percent of all patients who had cerebral angiography at Brooke Army Medical Center in the 6 year period from 1978 to 1984. Focal neurologic events were the presenting symptoms in 63 percent of the patients. The majority of the patients were treated with antiplatelet therapy, and eight patients had a total of 10 carotid artery dilatations. The only patients with recurrent symptoms were those who received either no treatment or antiplatelet therapy. There were no recurrent symptoms in the operated patients. This study suggests that surgical treatment for the symptomatic patient may prevent recurrent symptoms with an acceptably low morbidity and mortality. There was, however, no indication that prophylactic dilation of the fibromuscular disease in the asymptomatic patient was beneficial. Fibromuscular dysplasia of the carotid arteries is often associated with intracranial aneurysms, and surgical therapy rather than antiplatelet therapy may be advisable in patients who have intracranial aneurysms. Patients with concomitant atherosclerosis of the carotid artery bifurcation should be treated like any patient with atherosclerotic disease and an endarterectomy should be performed with carotid dilatation when indicated. Fibromuscular disease of the carotid artery is an infrequent angiographic finding that is associated with focal and global neurologic symptoms. Most patients can be effectively treated with antiplatelet drugs with no recurrent symptoms, however, for persistent or progressive symptoms, some patients will require surgical dilatation of the carotid artery. Fibromuscular disease of the carotid artery may lead to catastrophic symptoms of stroke or intracranial hemorrhage if left undiagnosed or untreated."
CD009372,0,15045609,0,Neuroradiologic differential diagnosis of cerebral intraparenchymal hemorrhage.,"Cerebral intraparenchymal hematoma (IH) is one of the most common causes of sudden onset of focal neurologic deficit. This is particularly true in the acute phase, in which IH appears hyperdense compared to the cerebral tissue. By three to four weeks, it becomes isodense with the cerebral gray matter and hypodense within 2 to 6 months. After contrast media administration, IH shows a peripheral ring of enhancement owing to the breakdown of the blood brain barrier. On magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the appearance of IH depends upon the paramagnetic effects of the different derivates of hemoglobin and both the magnetic field strength and type of sequences used. In the hyperacute phase, IH appears hyperintense on T2 and hypointense on T1 owing to the presence of oxyhemoglobin. In the acute phase, IH is hypointense on T2 and iso-hypointense on T1 as a consequence of the presence of deoxyhemoglobin, which is converted into methemoglobin by 3 to 5 days. Methemoglobin has a strong paramagnetic effect, so in this phase IH becomes hyperintense on T1 and hypointense on T2. After 2 weeks, methemoglobin is converted in hemosiderin, responsible of the ring of hypointensity surrounding the lesion on T2WI. When an IH has been diagnosed, someone should think about the origin of bleeding. Among the different differential diagnosis, one should think about the possible origin, taking into account some parameters, such as: anamnestic data, site of the lesion, number of lesions, appearance on CT and MRI, and presence of perilesional edema. Computed tomography is a reliable and very fast tool for the diagnosis of IH, but MRI is able to provide additional information about the spontaneous or secondary nature of the hematoma, thus allowing a better characterization of the hemorrhagic lesion."

It is classified into two from etiological standpoint i.e. primary and secondary (most often seen after lumbar puncture). On the other hand, low spinal fluid pressure is one of the promoting factors of chronic subdural hematoma. We report 2 cases of primary low spinal fluid pressure syndrome (primary intracranial hypotension) associated with chronic subdural hematoma. Case 1 is a 47-year-old man who was admitted with disorientation following 2 week history of orthostatic headache. Spinal fluid pressure was 7mmH2O in the lateral recumbent position. CT scan revealed bilateral isodense chronic subdural hematoma. The subdural hematoma reaccumulated 17 days after the first operation. Case 2 is a 31-year-old woman who was admitted with 4 week history of progressive orthostatic headache accompanied by nausea and vomiting. Spinal fluid pressure was 0 mmH2O. CT scan and cerebral angiography showed bilateral chronic subdural hematoma. The hematoma reaccumulated 20 days after the first operation. Six cases including our two cases of primary intracranial hypotention associated with chronic subdural hematoma have been reported. When changes of characters of headache, especially mental symptoms and disturbances of consciousness occurred in patients with chronic orthostatic headache, association of chronic subdural hematoma should be suspected. In cases with chronic subdural hematoma associated with low spinal fluid pressure syndrome, the reaccumulation of hematoma tends to occur after burr hole opening and irrigation of hematoma."

CD009372,0,11201540,0,Pediatric cerebrovascular disease.,"Stroke in children is thought to be a rare phenomenon, but in a pediatric hospital, it is much more common than is expected. The development of rapid MRI imaging with diffusion techniques and MR spectroscopy has brought to the attention of both the neuroradiologists and clinicians that pediatric infarction, in both detection and management, are challenges for the future. Since 1995, cerebral diffusion has been performed at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia in the evaluation of patients with acute cerebral compromise. Diffusion imaging looks at the motion of water molecules both intra- and extracellular, and the manner in which they become restricted in their motion when higher gradient strength is applied during the imaging sequence. Restricted diffusion is seen in cytotoxic edema, an early acute manifestation of ischemia/infarction. Diffusion studies are often positive when routine MRI and CT are as yet negative. Confirmation of the death of tissue is provided on proton spectroscopy by a rise in lactate from anaerobic glycolysis and a loss of N-acetylaspartate from neuronal death. Confirmation of the diffusion image findings, by mapping the apparent co-efficient (ADC), is also valuable. Application of these techniques, together with magnetic resonance angiography and magnetic resonance venography, is the substance of this paper."

The CT, angiographic and MRI findings and clinical course of patients with initially negative angiograms were reviewed retrospectively. The overall incidence of negative cerebral panangiography was 31% (92/295). An aneurysm was disclosed on a second angiogram in 4 cases, and on a third angiogram in 1, giving a total false negative rate of 5%. In 55% of cases, only a small amount of SAH was present on CT. The distribution of the subarachnoid blood was nonspecific and resembled the pattern seen in aneurysmal SAH. Ninety-four percent of the patients presented in Hunt-Hess grades I and II. The complications of conservative treatment were few: a rebleed rate of 4%, delayed cerebral ischemia in 4%, cerebral infarcts in 8% and hydrocephalus requiring shunting in 3%. On discharge, 93% of patients had recovered completely and the others were left with moderate disability. There were two deaths related to massive rebleeding.

Although not part of published prospective randomized rtPA trials, information about the status of the brain vessels would be helpful in the selection of patients who may benefit the most. Our purpose was to determine the feasibility of CT angiography (CTA) in patients with acute hemispheric ischemia and to evaluate its relevance for thrombolytic therapy."

Strictly unilateral cerebrovascular disease was confirmed in 47 patients by clinical history and by transmission computerized tomography (TCT) and contrast angiography. Twenty-seven were excluded, considered normal. SPECT flow maps were evaluated visually (against TCT) or by automated region of interest (ROI) techniques (12 areas per slice) to measure area flow (AF) (ml/100 g-min) and interhemispherical area flow ratios (AR). These were compared with normal values. Minimum AF in affected hemisphere decreased, and AR-to-normal difference increased, with the severity of the disease. Visually, low-flow areas were detected twice as frequently in SPECT as areas of low density of TCT. In reversible episodes, sensitivity of AF alone ws significantly below the sensitivity of combined evaluation of flow and ratio."
CD009372,0,11157554,0,"Subarachnoid haemorrhage: diagnosis, causes and management.","The incidence of subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) is stable, at around six cases per 100 000 patient years. Any apparent decrease is attributable to a higher rate of CT scanning, by which other haemorrhagic conditions are excluded. Most patients are <60 years of age. Risk factors are the same as for stroke in general; genetic factors operate in only a minority. Case fatality is approximately 50% overall (including pre-hospital deaths) and one-third of survivors remain dependent. Sudden, explosive headache is a cardinal but non-specific feature in the diagnosis of SAH: in general practice, the cause is innocuous in nine out of 10 patients in whom this is the only symptom. CT scanning is mandatory in all, to be followed by (delayed) lumbar puncture if CT is negative. The cause of SAH is a ruptured aneurysm in 85% of cases, non-aneurysmal perimesencephalic haemorrhage (with excellent prognosis) in 10%, and a variety of rare conditions in 5%. Catheter angiography for detecting aneurysms is gradually being replaced by CT angiography. A poor clinical condition on admission may be caused by a remediable complication of the initial bleed or a recurrent haemorrhage in the form of intracranial haematoma, acute hydrocephalus or global brain ischaemia. Occlusion of the aneurysm effectively prevents rebleeding, but there is a dearth of controlled trials assessing the relative benefits of early operation (within 3 days) versus late operation (day 10-12), or that of endovascular treatment versus any operation. Antifibrinolytic drugs reduce the risk of rebleeding, but do not improve overall outcome. Measures of proven value in decreasing the risk of delayed cerebral ischaemia are a liberal supply of fluids, avoidance of antihypertensive drugs and administration of nimodipine. Once ischaemia has occurred, treatment regimens such as a combination of induced hypertension and hypervolaemia, or transluminal angioplasty, are plausible, but of unproven benefit."
CD009372,0,15912770,0,[A case of systemic Lupus erythematosus complicated with multiple subcortical hemorrhage].,"We described a case of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) complicated with multiple intracerebral hemorrhage. A 52-year-old female with no history of hypertension had been treated with steroid hormone therapy for more than 15 years. Four days before admission, she experienced acute onset of headache and nausea. On the day of admission, the patient suffered from headache and nausea again followed by a deteriorated level of consciousness. The computed tomographic scan revealed two subcortical hematomas in the right frontal and left temporo-occipital area with atypical findings compared to those of the usual intracerebral hemorrhage. Cerebral angiography demonstrated that cortical arteries around the hematomas were markedly stretched and displaced. Multiple segmental stenosis and irregular lumen of the internal carotid artery and bilateral cortical arteries were possibly representative of vasculopathy. Transit time of blood flow was severely delayed with no apparent obstruction of the cerebral arteries, veins and dural sinuses. These findings suggested the existence of severely increased intracranial pressure. Emergent surgical evacuation of the hematomas was successfully performed with a favorable outcome for the patient. Intraoperatively, the brain was congested even after the evacuation of the hematomas. Surgical manipulation was able easily to cause bleeding from the cavity of the hematomas, which was hard to control. It is supposed that vasculopathy including fibrinoid degeneration and vasculitis may have affected the susceptibility of small arteries and veins to rupture in the present case. Subsequent increase of intracranial pressure might cause another hematomas by adding of hemodynamic stress to small vessels apart from those at the site of the first hemorrhage."

CD009372,0,7754116,0,[Magnetic resonance angiography of the intracranial circle using magnetization transfer contrast (MTC)].,"Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA) is becoming an accurate technique to study vascular conditions, especially when the intracranial circulation is involved. Nevertheless, the contrast-to-noise (C/N) ratio in MRA images is often inadequate to obtain diagnostic images. C/N ratio can be increased by using magnetization transfer contrast (MTC), the technique which allows to reduce the signal from the stationary tissues surrounding vascular structures. To demonstrate the value of MTC, 10 healthy volunteers and 10 patients with different cerebral vascular conditions were examined. All exams were performed using 3D MOTSA (Multiple Overlapping Thin Slab Acquisition) Time of Flight sequences, with and without MTC. A quantitative analysis was carried out in the images with and without MTC, measuring the signal intensity value in the regions of interest at the vascular and stationary structures. A qualitative analysis was also carried out with a double blind study by two independent radiologists. Our results showed that MTC allows to reduce stationary tissues signal intensity, without affecting flowing blood signal intensity. Therefore, the C/N ratio is increased, thus allowing better depiction of smaller peripheral branches. In conclusion, MTC applied to intracranial MRA allows image quality to be markedly improved, with an overall increase in the diagnostic accuracy of this technique."

Angiograms from 125 patients with cerebral AVMs were evaluated, and 15 (12%) had intranidal aneurysms. All 15 patients had a history of bleeding. Five patients underwent particulate or liquid embolization before surgical excision of or radiation therapy for the AVM. All aneurysms were thrombosed at the time of embolization. Ten patients underwent radio-surgery alone. Eight of the 10 underwent angiographic follow-up (mean, 33 months); seven patients showed complete obliteration of the AVM without residual aneurysm. Histologic evaluation showed intranidal aneurysms to be thin-walled vascular structures, and they are the likely site for AVM hemorrhage. Embolization is an effective method for achieving thrombosis of the intranidal aneurysm and may be beneficial in patients undergoing radiation therapy because of a long latency period between treatment and thrombosis of the AVM."

CD009372,0,22787001,0,Recognizing false ischemic penumbras in CT brain perfusion studies.,"Computed tomography (CT) plays a pivotal role in the diagnosis of acute stroke and in treatment decision making. CT perfusion imaging performed with intravenous iodinated contrast material allows calculation of the time to peak enhancement, mean transit time, and cerebral blood volume, important parameters for differentiating between an ischemic penumbra, which might benefit from intravascular therapy with thrombolytic agents, and infarcted tissue, which would not benefit from such therapy. Differentiation between the two entities is important because thrombolytic therapy is associated with an increased risk for intracranial hemorrhage. A finding of delay in peak enhancement or increased mean transit time in a region with normal or only slightly abnormal cerebral blood volume is suggestive of an ischemic penumbra; however, accurate interpretation of the CT perfusion parameters may be difficult in the presence of a cerebrovascular anatomic variant or physiologic condition that produces benign oligemia leading to a false appearance of penumbra. For this reason, CT perfusion parameters must be correlated with the clinical history and findings at unenhanced head CT, angiography or CT angiography, and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. The authors identify five possible causes of false penumbras, each of which produces a different pattern at imaging: upstream flow restriction, evolution of ischemic change, vascular dysregulation, positioning of the patient's head at an angle during image acquisition, and variant anatomy in the circle of Willis. Familiarity with the imaging patterns and causes of false penumbras may increase the radiologist's confidence in diagnosis and help avoid costly errors in treatment."

A male neonate, the product of a precipitious, instrumented, footling breech delivery, exhibited seizures at the age of 18 hours. A computerized tomography scan of the head showed hemorrhage along the tentorium with a globular component at the incisura. Transfontanel Doppler ultrasound examination detected pulsatile arterial flow within the globular mass. Cerebral angiography demonstrated a 1.5-cm saccular aneurysm arising from a small distal branch of the superior cerebellar artery. The pathogenesis of aneurysms in children is obscure and controversial.

CD009372,0,2311610,0,Synthesized image processing in clinical neurosurgery.,"In an effort to achieve efficient image management in clinical neurosurgery utilizing a local image filing system (EFPACS, Fuji Electric Co., Ltd), adequate image-processing and display techniques were developed. One is a method whereby the anatomical location of the thalamic and basal ganglion lesions is determined by automatically superimposing these lesions defined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) directly onto the Schaltenbrand-Wahren's human brain atlas. Horizontal, coronal and sagittal MR images are initially obtained based on the intercommissural line and a perpendicular erected on the midcommissural point as the basic reference coordinates. Precise superimposition is accomplished by the use of these reference axes. This imaging technique may offer the potential for help in anatomical identification of small intracranial lesions. Another technique described in the current communication is automated synthesis of two cerebral angiograms. By simply indicating two reference points, nasion and inion, with a cursor on the display screen, two films are automatically superimposed and displayed as a single synthesized image, featuring two different vascular phases simultaneously by a positive(vein)-negative(artery) mode. This technique was applied to patients with complete occlusion of the middle cerebral artery with or without sufficient blood flow through collateral circulation and was found useful in evaluating basic hemodynamics on a single angiographic image."

Blood supply to the anterior cerebral circulation is most commonly through enlarged basilar and posterior communicating arteries. Occasionally collateral flow is through abnormal transsellar anastomoses or anastomoses between the external carotid and intracranial systems. Associated intracranial aneurysms occur in 25% of patients, accounting for a significant incidence of intracranial hemorrhage as the initial symptom. Diagnosis is best made by cerebral arteriography with computed tomography to verify the congenital nature of the abnormality by demonstrating the absence of carotid canals. This is the second case to begin with transient ischemic attacks suggestive of carotid territory ischemia but originating from the vertebral system.

She suffered from subarachnoid hemorrhage due to dissecting aneurysm of right vertebral artery. Cerebral angiography followed by coil embolization for the aneurysm was performed. During the interventional procedure, saturation of blood oxygen suddenly declined and chest X-ray photography obviously revealed pulmonary edema. At first we dealt with it as neurogenic phenomenon but subsequently interpreted it to non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema induced by radiographic contrast medium, since intra-arterial injection of contrast medium at follow-up angiography led the symptoms into more fulminant status. Intensive care including endotracheal intubation and continuous positive airway pressure ventilation consequently achieved complete remission and the patient discharged without any sequelae. Although low osmolar, non-ionic contrast medium has been regarded as relatively safe, severe reaction such as dyspnea, hypotension and cardiac arrest could emerge at certain intervals. We must perceive the adverse effects of it because the usage of contrast medium will dramatically increase with development of diagnostic radiographical methodology and interventional neurosurgery."
CD009372,0,9228109,0,Developmental venous anomalies of the posterior fossa with transpontine drainage: report of 3 cases.,"Developmental venous anomalies (DVA) are considered as variant patterns of cerebral venous drainage. Although generally not rare in the cerebellum, DVA of the brain stem or of the cerebellum with drainage through the brain stem are exceptional findings. Because it is not clear whether DVA may sometimes be of clinical significance, we try to correlate the clinical findings of the patients with the course of the variant vessels. We reviewed the literature and report three additional cases. All patients were examined by MRI and digital subtraction angiography. In particular, we discuss the drainage route as compared with the established patterns of posterior fossa blood drainage, which is directed to the dural sinuses, the petrosal vein or the vein of Galen. In one of our patients suffering from trigeminal neuralgia, the close topical relation of the DVA and the trigeminal nucleus and trigeminal nerve entry zone suggests a causal relationship. In a second case the brain stem symptoms were due to haemorrhage of a concomitant cavernoma. It remains unclear if the occurrence of dysarthria and dysaesthesia in the third patient with brain stem DVA was purely coincidental. The only clinical symptom directly attributable to a DVA with transpontine drainage in our series was trigeminal neuralgia."

All 15 VAs were identified both on the postcontrast MRIs and MRAs. The MRAs surpassed the MRIs in imaging entire structures, including the draining veins of the supratentorial VAs. For the infratentorial VAs, the MRAs and the MRIs were of equal value. Although the addition of MRA to the MRI procedure incurs more time and expense, the complete structure of the VA can thereby be identified three-dimensionally on MRA. Conventional angiography is apparently not required for the confirmation of a VA. Thus, it is concluded that MRA is very useful for diagnosing VAs."

Three patients demonstrated an isointense signal within the carotid artery's cavernous segment, correlating with complete carotid occlusion as seen angiographically. Ten patients had variable signal intensity and/or luminal narrowing in the carotid siphon; seven of these findings correlated with angiographic evidence of carotid occlusion, while carotid branch occlusion was seen angiographically in the other three. The demonstration of normal signal void within a normal-appearing cavernous segment of the internal carotid artery in the remaining 24 patients correlated with an absence of significant stenosis within the cervical segment in 21 patients. In the remaining three, significant disease of the internal carotid artery was found. Isointensity or luminal irregularity within the intracranial carotid artery can indicate complete occlusion or slow flow. The presence of normal flow void in the intracranial segment does not exclude significant abnormality of the cervical segment of the carotid artery."

Twenty-seven chronic stroke patients underwent either dynamic CT or intravenous digital subtraction angiography (IVDSA), and single photon emission CT (SPECT). We placed symmetric regions of interest as appropriate in each study, and obtained a peak time of each regional time-density curve in IVDSA or dynamic CT, and a laterality index of reconstructed counts in SPECT. Right-to-left difference of peak time significantly correlated to the laterality index both in IVDSA and dynamic CT (r = -0.88, p < 0.001, and r = -0.82, p < 0.001, respectively). Thus, time-density curve study well reflected unilateral reduction of cerebral perfusion.

Of 4,814 participants in the population-based Heinz Nixdorf Recall Study, 327 reported CHD (i.e., previous coronary bypass surgery, angioplasty); of those, 160 patients (mean age 66.4 years) were examined using MR of the brain, the heart (excluding the coronary arteries), and whole-body MR angiography. The prevalence of each vascular pathology was assessed, correlated to the others and compared to patients' histories. Of the 160 CHD patients, 16 (10%) showed MR signs of stroke, and 77 (48.1%) had a stenosis >50% in at least one extracerebral peripheral artery (other than the coronaries), including 28 (17.5%) with relevant renal artery stenoses, and 20 (12.5%) with relevant extracerebral internal carotid artery stenoses.

All twelve patients underwent cerebral angiography immediately after those 3D-CTA in every case. Angiographical findings were the same as 3D-CTA. Interventional superselective thrombolytic therapy was performed in ten of the twelve patients, and recanalization resulted in four of them. 3D-CTA may also be able to determine whether the occlusive vessel is the chief cerebral artery or the perforating artery."

Authors propose a protocol management by complete cerebral angiography and CT scan as soon as the least neurologic sign appears. A headache is the most frequent of these signs. 35 patients were explored during 3 years and 10 treated surgically. These authors conclude that: mycotic aneurysm must be detected aneurysm with subarachnoid haemorrhage must be operated on as soon as possible. With unruptured aneurysm, surgical decision is more difficult: sequential angiography after excision of the most dangerous aneurysm, demonstrates that an aneurysm can appear, enlarge, diminish or spontaneously resolve. Carrying on with this protocol should allow an answer to this question."

CD009372,0,11065268,0,Echo-enhanced color Doppler sonography in children and adolescents.,"Fifty-one patients, with a range of underlying pathologic conditions, were studied prospectively to assess the diagnostic value of echo-enhanced color Doppler sonography in the pediatric and adolescent population Their diagnoses included various tumors, vascular disorders, cerebral bleeding, pathologic conditions of small parts, and focal lesions of parenchymal organs. All patients underwent color Doppler sonography before proceeding to echo-enhanced color Doppler sonography. Diagnoses were confirmed by additional imaging (computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, angiography, and scintigraphy) performed as appropriate, with or without histologic study. An additional 20 children did not proceed to echoenhanced color Doppler sonography as color Doppler sonography alone was found to be sufficiently diagnostic. Levovist (SHU 508A), a contrast agent based on galactose-encapsulated air microbubbles, is approved for pediatric applications in Austria and was used as the echo-enhancing agent. Echo-enhanced color Doppler sonography was performed a total of 63 times in 51 patients (mean age, 9.8 years). Compared to color Doppler sonography, echo-enhanced color Doppler sonography either detected or enhanced visualization of pathologic conditions in 55 investigations (87.3%), yielding an overall accuracy of 95.2% (sensitivity, 95%), versus 65.7% with color Doppler sonography. One spinal arteriovenous malformation, one cerebral cavernoma, and one liver lesion were missed. The contrast material was easy to administer; no adverse reactions were observed. We conclude that echoenhanced color Doppler sonography is beneficial in pediatric sonography. It enhances visualization of vessels and perfusion, thus offering a nonionizing imaging tool for detection and follow-up evaluation of pathologic conditions with disturbed vasculature in specific cases. In infants and in persons with superficial lesions it did not offer significant advantages over color Doppler sonography."
CD009372,0,7731504,0,Dissecting aneurysms of the basilar artery.,"Ten patients (six men and four women; mean age, 40 yr) with spontaneous dissection of the basilar artery are reported. Clinically, six were admitted with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and four were admitted with brain stem ischemia. Angiography demonstrated string sign in four patients, pearl reaction in four, double lumen in one, and arterial ectasia with mural retention of contrast medium in one. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed in two patients. Follow-up angiograms or magnetic resonance angiography in six patients showed spontaneous healing in two patients, improvement in two, progression in one, and no change in one. Nine patients were treated medically, and one underwent selective intravascular occlusion of the dissecting aneurysm. One patient died after further SAH, two remain severely disabled, three have residual neurological deficit, and four are in good clinical condition. The most interesting observations in this series include a relatively good course in a substantial number of patients and low further bleeding potential after SAH, the late ""globular"" evolution, which may be favorable for reconstructive treatment, and the diagnostic value of associated computed tomographic/angiographic findings. Surgical options in basilar dissection are very poor; in some reported cases, wrapping has been tried with disappointing results. In light of the possibility of spontaneous healing or improvement, wrapping should be reserved for only those patients with recurrent SAH or angiographic progression of the dissection."

CD009372,0,571560,0,Noninvasive diagnosis of extracranial cerebrovascular disease: oculoplethysmography-phonoangiography and directional Doppler ultrasonography.,"The ability of two noninvasive diagnostic methods--oculoplethysmography-carotid phonoangiography (OPG/CPA) and directional Doppler ultrasonography--to detect extracranial cerebrovascular disease was examined in 400 consecutive studies. Cerebral arteriography was performed in 74 patients. Transient ischemic attack was the most common indication for study (30%). The OPG was normal in 95% of cases in which the diameter of the lumen of the internal carotid artery (ICA) was less than 60% reduced; the ocular pulse was delayed in 86% of cases with ICA stenosis of 60% or more. The overall diagnostic accuracy of OPG was 93%; CPA did not enhance the accuracy of OPG alone. Supraorbital Doppler tests detected 88% of cases of ICA stenosis of 60% or more, but there was a 13% false-positive rate with ICA stenosis of less than 60%. Supratrochlear Doppler tests had only a 1% false-positive rate, but detected only 48% of significant ICA stenoses. Doppler studies were most often abnormal in the presence of ICA occlusion. Thus, OPG was as sensitive as supraorbital Doppler and more sensitive than supratrochlear Doppler in detecting hemodynamically significant ICA stenoses, without the unacceptable false-positive rate observed with the supraorbital Doppler test."
CD009372,0,13677803,0,Adults and children with headache: evidence-based diagnostic evaluation.,"Headache represents one of the most common complaints in the outpatient and emergency room setting [1]. Most causes of headache are benign and do not require emergent imaging or intervention. The authors' review of the diagnostic tests does not offer absolute indications for neuroimaging because most of the evidence is based on studies that are not randomized controlled trials. Imaging guidelines for adults and children, however, have emerged based on the available level 2 and 3 literature. CT imaging remains the initial test of choice for new-onset headache in adults and headache suggestive of SAH. Most of the available literature also recommends performing lumbar puncture when CT is equivocal in ruling out SAH [1]. The sensitivity of MR imaging appears to be less than CT for SAH [1]. Newer MR imaging techniques need to be tested and developed to determine if they have higher sensitivity than CT or lumbar puncture in the detection of SAH. In adults with suspected brain metastatic disease, contrast-enhanced MR imaging is the imaging study of choice [38,39]. Contrast-enhanced MR imaging is the examination of choice for brain metastatic lesions less than 2 cm [39]. CT angiography and MR angiography have sensitivities greater than 85% for brain aneurysms larger than 5 mm [43]. If clinically warranted, aneurysms smaller than 5 mm may require digitally subtracted angiography because of the low sensitivity of MR and CT angiography. In children, the choice of diagnostic test strategy depends on the risk group. In high-risk patients, MR imaging is the test of choice whereas in low-risk patients, close clinical observation with periodic reassessment is the best strategy [44]. Clinical diagnosis will always play a key role in the evaluation of headache disorders; however, for the small subset of patients who present with headache secondary to an intracranial space-occupying lesion, bleeding, or SAH, making the diagnosis is crucial to decreasing morbidity and mortality. CT, MR imaging, and lumbar puncture play important roles in the assessment of headache disorders, but their future roles will continue to evolve as the technology becomes more sophisticated and robust, and physicians become more expert with their use [1]."
CD009372,0,22749486,0,[Loss of consciousness after a minor trauma revealing an aneurysm rupture in a child].,"In pediatrics, concussions are common after falls and are often banal. However, it is important to identify situations where a particular inquiry is essential. Cerebral hemorrhage and aneurysms, although more common in adults, can also occur the young. The best investigation for diagnosis is the brain CT scan. After a soccer head injury, a 13-year-old boy presented with headache, abdominal pain, and a feeling of being ill. Then, he quickly lost consciousness and had amnesia for several hours. On arrival, the clinical examination, including neurological testing was normal except for bradycardia and pallor. He then presented a severe meningeal syndrome. A CT scan showed cerebral hemorrhage at the left sylvian fissure and in the posterior fossa. MR angiography confirmed subarachnoid hemorrhage and made and us suspect an aneurismal lesion in the emergence of the left sylvian artery. Cerebral hemorrhage is rare in children (about 1.4/10,0000 per year), 18% of which are pure meningeal forms. In the cases of intraventricular or subarachnoid hemorrhage in children, it is essential to complete the assessment by angiography because the risk of underlying aneurysm is then 57%. Among children with aneurysm, 35% will have bleeding from aneurysm rupture, especially during adolescence. Cerebral aneurysms are usually not familial. A family screening should only be performed when two cases or more of intracerebral aneurysms are reported in first- or second-degree relatives. In this case, the best investigation is cerebral MR angiography."

It seemed to the author that moyamoya disease appeared to be prone to cause PIVH, this hemorrhage being likely due to ischemic malacia in the ventricular wall. The tortuous, abnormal network vessels ruptured and bled as a result of infarction and damage of the walls of the miliary aneurysms. PIVH might be divided into two types: the panventricular hemorrhage and partial ventricular hemorrhage, according to the amount of blood that filled into the ventricles. 6 cases of the panventricular type were fatal. The symptoms were in conformity with the traditional concept of the most critical, intraventricular hemorrhage. The external ventricular drainage in combination with lumber puncture drainage would be the better way of treatment for these patients. 14 cases of the partial ventricular hemorrhage type showed the clinical features of acute subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The treatment was similar to SAH too, and the prognosis was much better. It would be worth noting that moyamoya disease should be a factor not to be neglected in causing PIVH."

CD009372,0,6179227,0,Non-invasive studies of the extra-cranial cerebral arteries: indication for angiography and operation.,"During recent years, the risk involved in cerebral angiography has been considerably reduced. However, in our patient group this risk was still almost as high as that involved in operation. Non-invasive examination by means of the ultrasonic Doppler procedure has been improved with a resulting success rate of over 95%. Color coding stored in a computer program with the ""Echoflow""-procedure allows for demonstration of the neck vessels giving an indication of the degree of stenosis. By this method, pictures of document quality are provided which can also be obtained by inexperienced examiners and interpreted more easily than curve registrations of the acoustic signals. In comparison with angiography, the Echoflow method was less sensitive than the conventional ultrasonic Doppler procedure especially in cases of low-degree stenosis of the internal carotid artery. Nevertheless, in 2.7% of the cases, a correct Echoflow diagnosis could be confirmed during operation where angiography had not shown the changes correctly. As the Echoflow procedure does not give sufficient information on intracranial pathology, we have so far dropped angiography in emergency cases only when establishing the indication for operation; however, in follow-up examinations this method is used exclusively instead of angiography."

CD009372,0,1510352,0,New magnetic resonance techniques for evaluating cerebrovascular disease.,"Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of acute stroke has made important contributions to diagnosis. Several novel MR technologies, now in preclinical and clinical development, will contribute to stroke diagnosis and perhaps help to guide therapy. MR angiography is the most clinically advanced new MR technology and offers the clinician a method to image noninvasively the extra- and intracranial vasculature. Diffusion-weighted MR imaging can demonstrate ischemic lesions quantitatively within minutes of onset in experimental stroke models, and human application is proceeding. Perfusion MR studies can reveal the presence or absence of cerebral perfusion in specific arterial territories. MR spectroscopy can assess tissue metabolites in vivo and reveal changes in these metabolites associated with ischemic injury. The combination of these new MR techniques should provide a plethora of information about the extent of ischemic lesions, associated vascular and perfusion deficits, and metabolic consequences. This information will afford the clinician the opportunity to assess and subtype ischemic stroke patients more rapidly and could be used to monitor therapeutic responses."

We performed a computerized PubMed search of the literature from inception to 27 July 2011 to find reports of similar comparative studies and performed a meta-analysis of diagnostic accuracy. The pooled sensitivity was 97.0% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 93.2-99.1%), specificity was 98.9% (95% CI: 97.0-99.7%), accuracy was 98.2% (95% CI: 96.6-99.2%), positive predictive value was 97.8% (95% CI: 94.2-99.5%) and negative predictive value was 98.5% (95% CI: 96.6-99.5%). The false negative rate was 1% (95% CI: 0.4-2.6%).

The patient had not been aware of any traumatic head injuries or preceding infection, and had no contributory medical history. On admission, he was alert and well oriented, without neurological impairment or headache. He was afebrile and blood examination showed no abnormal findings. Computed tomography revealed an irregular intracerebral hematoma, 3 x 1.5 cm in diameter, in the left rectal gyrus. Cerebral angiography showed an arteriovenous fistula (AVF) in the anterior cranial fossa supplied only by the persistent primitive olfactory artery (PPOA) originating from the anterior cerebral artery, forming a shunt to an ascending cortical vein, and drained by the superior sagittal sinus. The patient underwent endovascular obliteration of the AVF via the transarterial route. Immediately after successful isolation, angiography showed that the bilateral anterior ethmoidal arteries supplied the AVF. The feeding branches from the left anterior ethmoidal artery were completely occluded via the ophthalmic artery, but introduction of the catheter into the right ophthalmic artery markedly decreased the stump pressure. Follow-up angiography performed at 3 and 8 weeks following embolization showed spontaneous resolution of the residual AVF without findings of recanalization or new abnormal channels. AVF arising in the anterior cranial fossa may be associated with an unusual pattern of the blood supply when including the PPOA."

This study was carried out to assess whether radioanatomical features on noncontrast enhanced computerised tomography (CT) scans may be of value in localizing ruptured intracranial aneurysms. The diagnostic CT scans of 56 consecutive patients, investigated for SAH with cerebral angiography, over a period of six months were available for review. Various radioanatomical features were assessed: (1) pattern of subarachnoid blood (e.g. predominant site and location near major vessel bifurcation), (2) presence of intraparenchymal haematoma, (3) presence of aneurysm contour and (4) hydrocephalus. On the basis of the findings an estimation of the anatomical location of the source of bleeding was made and then compared with the angiogram findings to which the reviewer was blinded. The location of the aneurysm was correctly identified in 89.5% of cases. Careful analysis of the pattern of bleeding was essential for the successful localization of the aneurysm in all these cases. The presence of an aneurysm contour was also associated with correct identification of the source of bleeding (chi(2) = 6.067, P = 0.02). Our findings suggest that radioanatomical features on CT scans in SAH can be a valuable aid in the correct identification of the location of the ruptured aneurysm. This would be of particular significance in the presence of multiple intracranial aneurysms."

However, the etiology was not apparent on CT angiography of the head. Catheter-based angiography was performed, demonstrating a single-hole, high-flow vertebrovertebral fistula, arising from the V2 segment and decompressing into both cervical and skull base venous structures. Definitive treatment consisted of endovascular fistula obliteration with a combination of coil and liquid embolic material. The patient made a full neurological recovery.

A follow-up study (4 to 61 months after treatment; median, 43 months) revealed a 4.5% mortality rate. Four patients chosen from among the 22 SAH cases underwent prophylactic operation. The decision to operate was based on repeated angiography showing regional cerebral vasospasm corresponding to a limited hyperdense area on the computed tomographic scan at the time of the onset of SAH. Microsurgery revealed a minute protrusion (less than 2 mm in diameter) or thinning of the arterial wall with old hematoma of the surrounding brain in all 4 cases, and treatment required only coating of the abnormal site. All 4 patients are now fully recovered.

Data, including demographic data, risk factor assessment, neuroimaging studies, blood tests, and cardiac studies, were collected by retrospective and then prospective chart review between January 2001 and July 2008. Outcome was based on the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score at admission, discharge, and latest follow-up. A total of 958 patients (204 with CVT and 754 with AIS) were included in the study. Age under 36 years, anemia, pregnancy or postpartum state, and presence of hemorrhagic infarcts on computed tomography scan or magnetic resonance imaging were significant predictors of CVT on univariate analysis. Age over 36 years, diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, recent myocardial infarction, electrocardiogram abnormalities, and blood glucose level >150 mg/dL were strong predictors of AIS. On multivariate analysis, postpartum state and hemorrhagic infarct were the strongest predictors of CVT (P < .001). Mortality was comparable in the 2 patient groups. Prognosis was significantly better for patients with CVT than for those with AIS (mRS score 0-2, 74% v 46%; P < .001). There was no difference in outcome between patients with obstetric and nonobstetric CVT. Our data indicate that in young Asian women, predictors of CVT differ from those for AIS. These findings could be useful in the early identification and diagnosis of patients with CVT."

To display continuous vessel contours without superimposed bone in a similar manner, postprocessing of the CTA data is necessary.

The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of a fully automated algorithm for bone subtraction in cranial CT angiography."
CD009372,0,1681340,0,Outcome in patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage and negative angiography according to pattern of haemorrhage on computed tomography.,"15% of patients with spontaneous subarachnoid haemorrhage have normal cerebral angiograms; they fare better than patients with demonstrated aneurysms, though rebleeding and cerebral ischaemia can still occur. In patients with a normal angiogram and accumulation of blood in the cisterns around the midbrain--""perimesencephalic nonaneurysmal haemorrhage""--outcome is excellent. To test the hypothesis that rebleeding and disability in angiogram-negative subarachnoid haemorrhage might be limited to those with other patterns of haemorrhage on initial computed tomography (CT), complications and long-term outcome were studied in 113 patients with angiogram-negative subarachnoid haemorrhage, admitted between January, 1983, and July, 1990. All patients were investigated with third-generation CT scans within 72 h of the event, and with cerebral angiography. The mean follow-up period was 45 (range 6-96) months. None of 77 patients with a perimesencephalic pattern of haemorrhage on CT died or was left disabled as a result of the haemorrhage (0% [95% confidence interval 0-5%]). Among the other 36 patients, who had a blood distribution on CT indistinguishable from that in proven aneurysmal bleeds, 4 had rebleeds and 9 died or were left disabled as result of the haemorrhage (25% [14-43%]). Thus, two distinct subsets of patients with angiogram-negative subarachnoid haemorrhage should be recognised. Patients with a perimesencephalic pattern of haemorrhage have an excellent prognosis. Rebleeding, cerebral ischaemia, and residual disability occur exclusively in patients with aneurysmal patterns of haemorrhage on initial CT. Repeated angiography in search of an occult aneurysm is justified only in the patients with aneurysmal patterns."

CD009372,0,22186849,0,Clinical predictors of cognitive decline in patients with mild cognitive impairment: the Chongqing aging study.,"Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is considered as the early stage of dementia which currently has no effective treatments. Reducing progression of cognitive decline at the MCI stage could be an important strategy for preventing conversion to dementia. The goal of this work was to screen for clinical predictors indicating the prognosis of MCI comprehensively; therefore, we assumed vascular risk factors (VRFs), carotid stenosis, and white matter changes (WMC) to be independent predictors. A total of 257 patients with MCI underwent collection of VRF information, neuropsychological evaluation, computed tomography angiography (CTA) to investigate carotid stenosis, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to identify severity of WMC. After a 3-year follow-up period, the neuropsychological evaluation, CTA, and MRI were repeated to assess the progression of cognitive decline, carotid stenosis, and WMC. The conversion rate from MCI to dementia was 11.65% per year, and the conversion rate from MCI to Alzheimer's disease was 7.05% per year in our cohort. Cognitive decline (in terms of changes in Mini Mental State Examination scores) was associated with diabetes mellitus (p = 0.004), baseline WMC severity (p < 0.001), baseline carotid stenosis (p < 0.001), and WMC severity change (p < 0.001). Besides, diabetes, baseline WMC severity, baseline moderate-to-severe carotid stenosis, and carotid stenosis change during follow-up were predictors of conversion from MCI to dementia. Given the potential clinical predictors, our findings could imply that controlling blood glucose, removing carotid stenosis, and improving cerebral perfusion could be effective measures to delay cognitive decline in patients with MCI and prevent conversion from MCI to dementia."

The cerebro vascular system is implicated in the pathogenesis of many diseases of the cerebral white matter, for example, stroke, microcerebrovascular disease, and multiple sclerosis (MS). In our work, white matter lesions and vessels are depicted using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and extracted using image analysis techniques. We focus on measuring distance relationships between white matter lesions and vessels, and distribution of lesions with respect to vessel caliber. Vascular distance maps are generated by computing for each voxel the Euclidean distance to the closest vessel. Analogously, radius maps assign the radius of the closest vessel to each voxel in the image volume. The distance and radius maps are used to analyze the distribution of lesions with respect to the vessels' locations and their calibers. The method was applied to three MS patients to demonstrate its functionality and feasibility. Preliminary findings indicate that larger MS lesions tend to be farther from detected vessels and that the caliber of the vessels nearest to larger lesions tends to be smaller, suggesting a possible role of relative hypoperfusion or hypoxia in lesion formation."

Clinical , imaging, and transcatheter therapeutic aspects of neonatal cerebral vascular malformations are described. Symptomatic high-flow vascular malformations characteristically present with cardiac failure and associated systemic problems in the neonate, whereas infants typically present with macrocephaly and hydrocephalus and older children with hemorrhage, developmental delay, or focal deficits. Neonatal cerebral hemorrhage is typically primary or associated with immaturity, parturitional trauma, or coagulopathy. Likewise, cerebral ischemic lesions are more likely secondary to hypoxic, ischemic events than to thromboembolic or structural cerebrovascular occlusive disease. The role of the current noninvasive imaging modalities in each of these clinical problems is reviewed and illustrated."

We report a case of VADA with isolated occipital headache at the time of onset and treatment using an endovascular approach. A 58-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with left occipital headache. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed neither subarachnoid hemorrhage(SAH)nor cerebral infarction, but magnetic resonance angiography (MRA)revealed left VADA. Conservative treatment including pain relief and blood pressure control was provided. After 2 weeks, the dissecting lesion showed spontaneous improvement and occipital headache was gradually improving. However, 4 months after onset, the VADA showed growing aneurysmal dilatation. We therefore performed endovascular surgery (coil embolization with parent artery occlusion). Symptoms improved, and the postoperative course was uneventful.

CD009372,0,17533973,0,[Clinical applications of 3.0 T magnetic resonance system in the neuroradiological field].,"Recently, the introduction of 3 tesla (3T) magnetic resonance (MR) system for more sophisticated clinical applications has yielded in important benefits, especially in neuroradiology. The aim of this article is to illustrate the practical scientific applications of the 3T system in the neuroradiological filed. From the clinical point of view, we focused on the usefulness of 3T system for the diagnosis of several neurological disorders, such as brain tumors, vascular lesions, hemorrhagic lesions, acute cerebral infarcts and degenerative diseases. The greatest advantage of high-field MR system is a higher signal to noise ratio. This higher spatial resolution can provide precise anatomical information for brain tumor itself and its surrounding structures. Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) also benefits from the higher signal to noise ratio and offers useful information for tumor characteristics. Navigation system with diffusion tensor tractgraphy is also available for surgical operation of brain tumors. Parallel imaging enables to improve the quality of tractgraphy by reducing susceptibility artifacts. 3T TOF (time-of-flight) MR angiography (MRA) demonstrates superior depiction of intracranial aneurysms compared with that of 1.5T TOF MRA. 3T TOF MRA is also useful for the evaluation and follow-up of stenoocclusive diseases including moyamoya disease. Susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) is a BOLD (blood oxygenation level dependent)-sensitive method for visualizing anatomical features such as small cerebral veins in high detail. Therefore, 3T system has advantages for obtaining detailed, high spatial resolution images of the venous network. SWI is useful for detection of hemorrhagic lesions and early diagnosis of acute hemorrhagic infarcts. SWI also can detect embolus and evaluate functional changes showing dilatation of medullary veins in the area of acute cerebral infarcts. Neuromelanin imaging using 3T system can directly demonstrate the locus ceruleus and substantia nigra by the neuromelanin content and have the potential to become a powerful tool in Parkinson's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders with Parkinsonism. Hyperintense putaminal rim can be often observed in clinically normal subjects on fast spin echo T2-weighted images at 3T system. This finding should not be mistaken for multiple system atrophy. 3T MR system indeed offers new potential because of a substantial increase in signal intensity provided by the higher magnetic field. Routine neuroradiologic imaging would benefit from higher magnetic field. However, It is required that extended knowledge of clinical data in comparison with 1.5T system to elucidate the efficacy of 3T system in the neuroradiology."

On CT, size of the ischemic region, mass effect and frequency of hemorrhagic infarct were most prominent in cerebral embolism. It is difficult to diagnose cerebral infarction within 6 hours of their onset on CT findings. The following signs by Tomura would be important criteria for identifying embolic infarction in the middle cerebral and internal carotid arteries: (a) obscured outline or partial disappearance of the lentiform nucleus, (b) slight decrease in tissue density, (c) effacement of the cortical sulci. Angiographic characteristics of embolism and thrombosis were discussed in terms of shape and configuration at the stump of the occluded arteries, formation of collateral pathway and recanalization. Cerebral hemorrhage were also compared between pathological and CT findings. Indication of cerebral angiography to patients of cerebrovascular disease was also discussed."

Noninvasive imaging techniques have not replaced conventional angiography for the comprehensive evaluation o aneurysms but are effective in screening patients suspected to have an unruptured aneurysm or for preoperative planning in emergency situations that preclude catheter angiography. CT, CT angiography, MR imaging, and MR angiography can all complement the information obtained with catheter angiography in presurgical planning, and the choice of supplemental studies should be individualized.

CD009372,0,23542422,0,Towards robust deconvolution of low-dose perfusion CT: sparse perfusion deconvolution using online dictionary learning.,"Computed tomography perfusion (CTP) is an important functional imaging modality in the evaluation of cerebrovascular diseases, particularly in acute stroke and vasospasm. However, the post-processed parametric maps of blood flow tend to be noisy, especially in low-dose CTP, due to the noisy contrast enhancement profile and the oscillatory nature of the results generated by the current computational methods. In this paper, we propose a robust sparse perfusion deconvolution method (SPD) to estimate cerebral blood flow in CTP performed at low radiation dose. We first build a dictionary from high-dose perfusion maps using online dictionary learning and then perform deconvolution-based hemodynamic parameters estimation on the low-dose CTP data. Our method is validated on clinical data of patients with normal and pathological CBF maps. The results show that we achieve superior performance than existing methods, and potentially improve the differentiation between normal and ischemic tissue in the brain."

The main inclusion criteria were: National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score ≥10; treatment performed within 8 h from the onset of symptoms and no large hypodensity on CT; and occlusion of a major cerebral artery on the CT angiogram. An admission and a post-interventional NIHSS score were calculated for all patients by two different neurologists. Efficacy was assessed radiologically by post-treatment thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) scores and clinically by a 30-day Modified Rankin Scale (MRS) score. The mean duration of neurointerventional treatment was 84 min. All interventions were successful, with TIMI scores of 2 or 3 achieved in 100% of patients. There was one procedural complication in our series owing to a self-detached stent and one patient had a small asymptomatic basal ganglia haemorrhage. There was improvement of more than 4 points on the NIHSS score in 5 (72%) of the patients following treatment, of whom 4 (57%) had a 30-day MRS score of ≤2.

These techniques were compared with MRI and conventional angiography. In addition, the value of MR angiography for surgical planning was subjectively evaluated. Our results showed that intracranial vessels were invariably better shown on MR angiography than on MRI. MRA and MRV were most useful in evaluating vascular distortions related to congenital brain malformations and intracranial tumors. MRA was valuable in detecting arterial narrowing but overestimated the degree of stenosis compared with conventional angiography. MRV was the technique of choice for evaluation of dural sinus and cerebral venous thrombosis and compression.

A 62-year-old right-handed bilingual gentleman, with a diagnosis of infective endocarditis, developed headache and became expressively aphasic in the English language. Three days later he was receptively and expressively aphasic in both English and Arabic. Cranial MRI scans showed a left-sided acute subdural haematoma with mass effect and midline shift. Contrast CT brain scans showed an enhancing speck adjacent to the clot and cerebral angiogram confirmed a distal middle cerebral artery aneurysm. He underwent image-guided craniotomy, evacuation of the subdural haematoma and excision of the aneurysm. Histopathological examination was consistent with an infectious intracranial aneurysm. Postoperatively his aphasia did not improve immediately. He had widened pulse pressure due to severe aortic regurgitation, confirmed on echocardiography. He underwent aortic valve replacement and mitral valve repair, following which his aphasia recovered gradually. Initially the recovery of his language was limited to Arabic. About a week later he recovered his English language as well. At 3-year follow-up he is doing well and has no neurological deficits. His aphasia has recovered completely. The present case is unique because of (a) presence of pure subdural haematoma, and (b) the differential susceptibility and recovery of native (L1) and acquired language (L2) in presence of a common pathology.

Furthermore, imaging at 3 T gives higher signal, thus affording higher spatial resolution and allowing dynamic 3D MRA to approach the diagnostic performance of conventional digital subtraction angiography. This article presents the authors' clinical experience using 4D-MRA to evaluate various vascular abnormalities in the brain, spine, orbits, and neck at 3 T, demonstrates the imaging findings of this novel technique, and discusses its advantages and use in current neuroradiology practice."

CD009372,0,15237729,0,[A case of organized chronic subdural hematoma presented with transient neurologic deficits].,"A 59-year-old diabetic male presented with transient motor aphasia and monoparesis of the right upper limb. Brain CT scan showed a low density area in the left subdural space with a mild midline shift. Magnetic resonance (MR) T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imagings revealed homogenous hyperintensity with a hypointense web-like structure in the subdural hematoma. Cervical MR angiography showed no abnormal lesion at the bifurcation of the bilateral common carotid arteries. Conventional cerebral angiography showed an avascular, crescent, space-occupying mass over the left hemisphere without an etiologic lesion of cerebral ischemia. CT perfusion imagings indicated reduced cerebral blood flow (CBF) and prolonged mean transit time (MTT) in the left middle cerebral artery territory underneath the subdural hematoma. No epileptic discharge was found in electroencephalogram. Operative findings indicated that the hematoma was encapsulated with thickened outer and inner membranes including paste-like materials, and the brain surface was intact. Postoperative CT perfusion imagings revealed normal CBF and MTT. The pathophysiological mechanism which the chronic subdural hematoma produces the transient neurological deficit is still uncertain. The mechanical pressure of the hematoma on the neighboring cerebral vessels may cause impairment of blood flow leading to cerebral ischemia and paralysis of function. Our case indicated the transient neurological deficits attributed to a decreased CBF around the subdural hematoma and a change in pressure exerted by the hematoma during changes of head position and increased blood viscosity."

CD009372,0,6595871,0,[Noninvasive measurement of cerebrovascular circulation with the scintillation camera. A neurologic nuclear medicine study].,"Repeated CBF-measurements can be performed after inhalation or intravenous injection of 133Xe. After the development of a bicompartmental model by Obrist et al. in 1975 atraumatic CBF-measurements became widely used but there were still some difficulties concerning the sensitivity of different flow-indices towards CBF changes in normals under test conditions or ischemia in stroke patients. Due to the ""slippage phenomenon"" mostly noncompartmental flow-indices are used for the detection of ischemic brain areas. In this study a scintillation camera, that is usually available in every nuclear medicine department, was used for atraumatic CBF-studies. A collimator consisting of hexagonal lead tubes (septa 0.2 mm thick; FWHM 1.7 cm in 10 cm) was constructed for this purpose. The obtained counting rate varied between 2432 and 9081 cps over the whole hemisphere and 116-1094 cps in regions of approximately 2.5 X 2.5 cm. In 31 patients with CVD CBF was measured with the intracarotid (i.c.) technique and 1 hour later after i.v. 133Xe-injection. Intravenous flow values were comparable to those obtained after i.c. 133Xe injection (fB X MFr = 0.904; p less than 0.001). In 12 of the used 13 regions also significant correlation coefficients were found. In order to estimate the reproducibility of the intravenous injection method CBF-measurements were performed in both hemispheres of 10 patients on two consecutive days. Highly significant correlation coefficients were found for hemispheric blood flow (r = 0.933; p less than 0.001) and temporal, frontotemporal, temporoparietal and praecentral regions, while in the high parietal, frontal and occipital region lower reporducibility was found. Normal CBF-values were obtained from 12 healthy volunteers (MF right hemisphere: 50.7 +/- 4.6 ml/100 g/min; MF left hemisphere: 50.6 +/- 4.6 ml/100 g/min). MF did not show any hyperfrontality, while F1 and the ISI gave highest flow values in frontal regions. The clinical status of 76 patients suffering from cerebral ischemia (68 with flow disturbances in one hemisphere, 8 with vertebrobasilar insufficiency) was estimated by a semiquantitative scorescale at time of admission and after an observation period lasting from 6 to 35 months. In each case CBF was measured twice: once in the subacute stage after onset of symptoms and once after the observation period. The duration of neurologic symptoms (TIA, RIND, CS) was compared to the obtained flow values. A significant relationship was found between the duration of symptoms and impairment of CBF, thus showing the prognostic value of intravenous CBF measurements.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

CD009372,0,6397697,0,Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): method and early clinical experiences in diseases of the central nervous system.,"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has undergone a rapid development which is still continuing. In this article a survey is given of the present status of this new diagnostic tool in the evaluation of diseases of the central nervous system. When atoms with uneven numbers of protons or neutrons in a homogeneous magnetic field are tilted against the main vector of this field by a radiofrequency pulse, nuclear magnetic resonance can be observed. During the relaxation of the little dipoles back to the direction of the underlying magnetic field, a resonance signal is generated. The superposition of variable field gradients enables the scanning of sectional images in the axial, frontal and sagittal plane. The variables of H+-magnetic resonance which can be utilized for imaging are: the proton density, the relaxation times T1 (spin-lattice) and T2 (spin-spin) and flow effects. While the proton density in organic tissue fluctuates only by some 10%, the relaxation times may vary by several hundred per cent. Tissue contrast, therefore, is mainly based on relaxation times differences. The image character can also be influenced by variations of imaging parameters (i.e. repetition rate, interpulse delay, read out or echo delay) in different imaging sequences, such as the spin-echo and the inversion recovery technique. Depending on these imaging parameters T1 and T2 will contribute to the signal to a varying degree. This fact is most important for the diagnostic information of MRI. In initial clinical experiences in the diagnosis of diseases of the central nervous system, MRI has demonstrated high sensitivity in the detection of lesions (such as oedema, neoplasms, demyelinating disease), but less significance in lesion discrimination. In spinal disease the direct sagittal imaging of MRI enables MRI-myelography without contrast medium, superior to conventional myelography in many cases. For detailed evaluation of disc disease, however, the spatial resolution still has to be improved. Promising results have been obtained from flow effects. Depending on the flow velocity of blood, vessels appear white with intensive signals (slow flow) or black due to low signal intensities (rapid flow). MRI-angiography including measurement of blood flow seems possible. MRI-contrast media are not yet available for routine clinical use. Promising results have been reported on the basis of rare-earth elements, such as gadolinium Gd3+. These substances decrease T1 and T2 with subsequent increase in signal intensity. Concerning harmful side-effects of MRI, three possible sources have to be considered: the static magnetic field, the changing magnetic field, and radiofrequency heating.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
CD009372,0,20029781,0,[Stroke].,"Ischemic stroke is a very frequent neurological disorder. It's incidence is increasing as western societies are aging. Effective therapies that reduce mortality and increase the chances of living symptom-free or, at least, in independence are available. Intravenous or intraarterial thrombolysis is an effective treatment with a number needed to treat of 6 if given within 4.5 hours after symptom onset. The safe use of thrombolysis requires an effective and repeatedly trained workflow established within a team of a neurologist and specialized nursing staff in an optimized environment (admission, imaging facility, laboratory, stroke unit). After peracute treatment, the patient should be transferred to a stroke unit. This unit is a spatially defined intermediate care unit with specifically trained personnel (physicians, nurses, therapists). Treating the patient in a stroke unit is as effective in improving outcome as thrombolysis and also reduces the length of hospital stay. In contrast to thrombolysis, which can be provided, on average, to only 5% of stroke patients, stroke unit care is applicable to most. The organization of medical care in most European countries and in Switzerland separate the acute phase from subacute rehabilitation and chronic stroke treatment. This can be highly confusing for the patient who, during the course of the disease, meets different physicians, nurses and therapists with often diverging opinions about prognosis and therapies. Consistent treatment approaches and patient/caregiver information is necessary and can only be implemented by providing a homogeneous pathway for continuous stroke care."

CD009372,0,8078609,0,Trigeminal neuralgia: differentiation between intracranial mass lesions and ordinary vascular compression as causative lesions.,"We investigated 164 patients who presented with trigeminal neuralgia as their initial symptom at our institute. Twenty-two patients (13.4%) had intracranial causative lesions other than vascular compression. There were 19 tumors (10 epidermoids, 5 meningiomas, and 4 neurinomas) and 3 vascular lesions (2 arteriovenous malformations and 1 aneurysm). Eleven patients (50%) demonstrated only trigeminal neuralgia without any other neurological deficits. Preoperative computed tomography could not identify any causative lesions in 6 of these 22 patients. In 3 of the 6 patients, a causative lesion was clearly detected only by magnetic resonance imaging, while in 1 of the 6 patients an arteriovenous malformation was detected by angiography alone. Intraoperatively tumor was encountered in 3 cases even though preoperative computed tomography could not detect any apparent causative lesions. A higher incidence of hypesthesia in the trigeminal nerve regions as well as a reduced corneal reflex was noted in patients with a mass lesion compared to those with vascular compression. We thus conclude that magnetic resonance imaging should be performed on all patients who complain of trigeminal neuralgia in order to rule out mass lesions, however, angiography is still considered useful for the diagnosis of some vascular lesions."

We report 3 cases of TIA in which the ischemic lesions were recognized on DWI at a later date (""late-imaged TIA""). Three men (average age, 72.7 years) were admitted to our hospital on complains of monoparesis or sensory disturbance in their right arms. On admission, no apparent ischemic lesion was detected by DWI; however, spotty lesions were apparent in the left precentral or postcentral gyrus on hospital days 2-5. The neurological symptoms resolved within 24 hours, and all the cases were clinically diagnosed as TIA. Carotid MRI revealed low-grade stenosis of the left internal carotid artery with atherosclerotic plaque, characterized as so-called ""vulnerable plaque"". These findings suggest that the carotid atherosclerotic plaque lead to artery-to-artery embolism. Carotid MRI is considered useful as an adjunct to other imaging modalities in the diagnosis of late-imaged TIA."
CD009372,0,3525871,0,The role of intravenous digital subtraction angiography in the evaluation of extracranial carotid artery disease. Can the decision for carotid artery surgery be made solely on the basis of its findings?,"This retrospective study compared intravenous digital subtraction angiography (IV-DSA) with conventional catheter angiography (CA) performed on 105 patients with suspected cerebrovascular disease. Comparisons were made considering CA as the ""gold standard."" Factors reviewed for correlation included carotid artery stenosis, ulceration, fibromuscular disease, vessel occlusion, and subclavian and intracranial lesions. Each IV-DSA was judged as to its quality. Eighty-seven patients (83%) had interpretable IV-DSA studies. IV-DSA differed from CA regarding stenosis on 46 carotid arteries (26%). Of 47 excellent quality IV-DSA studies, 18 (38%) were in disagreement with CA regarding stenosis. For the subcategory of patients having hemodynamically significant stenosis (greater than 50% luminal narrowing) according to CA, the sensitivity of IV-DSA was 85%. Specificity was 94% with an overall accuracy rate of 92%. The authors believe these high values are somewhat misleading. The IV-DSA interpretation of stenosis differed from CA in 32 of 48 patients (67%) in this group with a mean difference of 30%. IV-DSA identified 3 of 11 intracranial lesions (27%). Surgical therapy was modified in 13 of 87 patients (15%) on the basis of angiographic interpretation of carotid artery stenosis compared with IV-DSA. We conclude that IV-DSA should be used as a screening tool and the decision for carotid artery surgery made solely on its findings should be reached with the knowledge of its limitations and that any patient with hemispheric cerebral symptoms warrants CA as the first diagnostic examination."
CD009372,0,14968401,0,Factors leading to hydrocephalus after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.,"Hydrocephalus is not a rare complication following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Hydrocephalus following subarachnoid hemorrhage can progress acutely (0-3 days), subacutely (4-13 days) or chronically (after 13 days). The predisposing factors leading to hydrocephalus after subarachnoid hemorrhage are not known exactly. This study assessed the predictive factors for the development of this condition. All patients presenting with subarachnoid hemorrhage between 1992-2001 were evaluated. All of them had initial computed tomography (CT) and hydrocephalus was diagnosed on CT scans. Age, gender, preexisting diabetes mellitus and hypertension, neurological state according to the Hunt and Hess scale at admission, Fischer grade on CT, the presence of intraventricular hemorrhage and localization of aneurysm were analyzed to see if there was any meaningful relationship between hydrocephalus and these factors. One hundred and fourteen patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage were evaluated. The incidence of hydrocephalus was 28.1 %. The incidence for acute hydrocephalus was 18.4 %, for subacute 5.2 % and for chronic 4.3 %. Sixty-nine percent of patients with hydrocephalus were graded as 3, 4 or 5 according to the Hunt and Hess scale on admission. Fifty-five percent of patients with hydrocephalus were graded as 3 and 4 according to Fisher grade on initial CT scan. Preexisting diabetes, higher Fisher grade and intraventricular hemorrhage were statistically significant predictors for the development of hydrocephalus. But only preexisting diabetes and higher Fisher grade were independent predictors according to multivariate analyses."

Many of these problems, particulary those related to flow effects, can be avoided by the use of a suitable contrast agent. To avoid the problem of super-imposition of veins, ultrafast gradient echo MRA techniques with very short TR and TE have been developed.

CD009372,0,9251456,0,Magnetic resonance angiography.,"The field of MRA has progressed to a stage at which several clinical applications are of obvious value, including the diagnosis of cerebral aneurysms, venous disorders and disease of the carotid bifurcation. Additionally spin echo images are useful in studying the parenchyma and this together with MRA works to be an excellent diagnostic package in the presurgical workup of patients with cerebral vascular abnormalities. With further technical improvements, it seems likely that important applications of MRA will also be found in the diagnosis of peripheral artery disease, stenosis of the renal artery and ischemic heart disease. With the advent of fast imaging techniques like echoplanar imaging, the ability image the coronary and renal arteries accurately seems possible in the near future. At present, however the lack of optimal spatial resolution and the presence of flow artifacts precludes the use of this technique for imaging the vasculature with an accuracy comparable with conventional angiography. The advent for contrast 3-D CT angiography has resulted in a technique of studying the intracranial vessels immediately after assessing for the presence of subarachnoid hemorrhage. It is superior to MRA in demonstrating the actively filling and thrombused portions of giant, partially thrombused aneurysms and in planning the surgical approach in relation to bony landmarks. Though there are daunting obstacles, with continuous ongoing clinical research and the added inputs from a dramatically changing computer technology, MRA is all set to be an imaging study of great promise that may eventually replace diagnostic catheter angiography in most clinical situations."

EEG changes occurred in 102 patients (18%). The frequency of EEG changes, as related to cerebral vascular symptoms, was as follows: transient ischemic attacks, seven per cent (19/259); completed strokes, 37% (36/98); vertebral basilar insufficiency, 24% (32/135); asymptomatic, 21% (15/71). Patients with contralateral carotid occlusion exhibited EEG changes in 37% (28/76) of operations. Fifteen patients suffered perioperative strokes (2.6%). Nine of the 15 were associated with a technical problem of either thrombosis of the internal carotid artery (five) or emboli (four). Technical problems were more common when shunts were used (five per cent) than when they were not (0.9%). Patients who suffered strokes prior to surgery were more at risk to develop a perioperative stroke (three per cent) than those not suffering prior strokes (0.3%). The EEG did not change in three patients who had lacunar infarcts prior to surgery and who awoke with a worsened deficit. Our series does not clearly establish the advantages of EEG monitoring, which is expensive (+375/patient) and may not detect ischemia in all areas of the brain. However, the use of shunts may introduce a risk of stroke due to technical error that is equal or greater than the risk of stroke due to hemodynamic ischemia. Since the need for protection is unpredictable by angiographic or clinical criteria, the benefit of EEG monitoring may be in reducing the incidence of shunting in those patients whose tracing remains normal after clamping. The decision to shunt, however, when there is electrical dysfunction after carotid clamping should be based not only on the EEG but also on the clinical signs and computed tomography (CT) scan. Our data does not show a net benefit in selective shunting unless the patient has sustained a stroke prior to surgery."

CD009372,0,23615379,0,Thrombolytics in acute ischaemic stroke: historical perspective and future opportunities.,"The discovery of thrombolytic agents goes back to the 1930s, when it was shown that substances derived from bacteria (streptokinase, staphylokinase), tissue (fibrinokinase), urine (urokinase) or bat saliva could activate the fibrinolytic system. The potential to treat arterial thrombosis with plasmin was recognized, but it was not until 1958 that its first use in acute ischaemic stroke (AIS) was described. However, since computer tomography (CT) was not available until the mid 1970s, optimal selection of patients was not possible. Early studies with streptokinase in AIS showed an increased risk of intracranial haemorrhage and lack of efficacy, which was associated with low fibrin specificity. The search for new agents with a better risk-benefit profile continued until 1979 when tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) was discovered. In 1983 it became possible to produce recombinant t-PA (rt-PA) by expression of a cloned gene which enabled clinical trials to be started, mainly for coronary thrombolysis. In 1995, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke study showed that rt-PA was an effective treatment for AIS, nowadays for use up to 4.5 h after onset. However, rt-PA still often fails in achieving rapid reperfusion, has relatively low recanalization rates and is associated with an increased bleeding risk. Several attempts have been made to develop thrombolytics with a better risk-benefit profile than rt-PA, but no real impact on clinical practice was observed. In 1994, it was shown that tenecteplase (rt-PA-TNK) had a higher fibrin specificity than rt-PA, but its clinical use in AIS was described only in 2005. The recently reported results of a small phase 2B trial showed significantly better reperfusion and clinical outcome with rt-PA-TNK compared to rt-PA; patients were selected by CT perfusion and angiography, and treated within 6 h after stroke onset. Currently, a phase 3 trial of rt-PA-TNK versus rt-PA is being planned in patients at an onset up to 4.5 h. The most fibrin-specific recombinant plasminogen activator desmoteplase originates from 1991, and its clinical development in AIS started in 2005. Desmoteplase is in phase 3 development for the treatment of AIS between 3 and 9 h after onset in AIS patients presenting with occlusion or high-grade stenosis."

Case report.,"A 52-year-old woman with Sjögren's syndrome presented with multiple cerebral aneurysms, which resulted in recurrent subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) manifesting as severe headache. Computed tomography (CT) showed SAH. Cerebral angiography revealed aneurysms of the anterior communicating artery and the left middle cerebral artery. The necks of the aneurysms were successfully clipped. Postoperative course was uneventful and she was discharged without neurological deficit. Thirteen years later, she suddenly lost consciousness and was brought to our hospital. CT demonstrated recurrence of SAH. Cerebral angiography revealed cerebral aneurysms of the right internal carotid artery and the right middle cerebral artery. The clipped aneurysms were stable. The internal carotid artery aneurysm was successfully treated with endovascular coil embolization. However, she regained no neurological function and died. Patients with Sjögren's syndrome may develop cerebral aneurysm complicated with SAH."

These cases were ruptured aneurysms with subarachnoid hemorrhage. After detection of subarachnoid hemorrhage on CT scan, cerebral angiography was performed at first, but aneurysms were not detected. Subsequently 3D-CTA was carried out, and aneurysms were detected. In all cases, cerebral angiography was repeated, after the aneurysms had been found by 3D-CTA. This time aneurysms were all detected by cerebral angiography, but each case needed photographs from special direction. The aneurysms were small by usual cerebral angiography and they were almost invisible behind the artery near which they existed. 3D-CTA was very useful for detection of small aneurysms, but small perforating arteries around the aneurysms were invisible by 3D-CTA. To find these perforating arteries, cerebral angiography was needed."
CD009372,0,21129599,0,[Catastrophes caused by neurologic diagnostic procedures].,"Serious complications (catastrophes) resulting from diverse neurological diagnostic procedures can be caused by erroneous indication and omission, as well as by delay and erroneous execution or interpretation. Headache, caused by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) hypotension, is a frequent complication of lumbar puncture; hematic patch is a therapeutic option for severe cases. The most serious complication is cerebral herniation and, for its prevention, computed tomography (CT) or cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) must always be performed before lumbar puncture: a lesion with evident mass effect is a contraindication. Some cases of minor subarachnoid hemorrhages can produce sentinel headache: when the findings of CT scans are normal, lumbar puncture must be performed for diagnosis and prevention of a catastrophic recurrence. Edrophonium testing can be complicated with bradycardia and/or asystole. The lack of indication of this procedure is a cause of under-diagnosis of myasthenia gravis, especially in older people. Electromyography produces few complications (rare cases of paraspinal hematomas and pneumothorax). Ultrasound, CT angiography and MR angiography examinations have decreased the indications for cerebral angiography, whose main complications -in addition to contrast reactions, hemorrhage and infection at the injection site- are neurological deficits caused by vascular dissection or atheromatous embolus. Video-electroencephalogram (EEG) recording with medication suppression can be used in the presurgical evaluation of epilepsy, which can precipitate repeated seizures with the risk of injuries and status epilepticus. The possible complications of studies performed with invasive electrodes are infections and intracranial hemorrhages. Cerebral biopsy is indicated when treatable disease is suspected but the therapeutic options (radiotherapy, chemotherapy) have potential serious adverse effects. Furthermore, cerebral biopsy can aggravate previous neurological deficits or produce new deficits. Genetic testing is not indicated in healthy children when an untreatable disease is suspected. In adults, genetic testing is appropriate in selected cases, but detailed previous information should be gathered and the possibility of triggering serious emotional reactions should always be considered."

CD009372,0,2264073,0,Diagnostic significance of flow separation within the carotid bifurcation demonstrated by digital subtraction angiography.,"The presence of an area of reversed blood flow due to flow separation in the interval carotid artery is a normal finding in Doppler ultrasound studies in vivo as well as in model carotid bifurcations. This flow separation phenomenon is caused by the geometry of the carotid bifurcation and the fluid dynamics of blood. We demonstrated the flow separation phenomenon on lateral-projection intra-arterial digital subtraction angiograms in 99 of 100 carotid bifurcations. The mean duration of flow separation was 5.8 seconds, with values up to 14 seconds in normal carotid bifurcations. The presence of this flow separation phenomenon is almost independent of atherosclerotic lesions and is not correlated with cerebral ischemia. Therefore, the angiographic finding of a flow separation has no diagnostic value. However, our results refer to a factor that may be important in the genesis of atherosclerosis at the carotid bifurcation, namely the duration of the stay of blood and its components within the area of flow separation."

In up to 20% of these patients, no aneurysm is found, but the prognosis of these patients is known to be better than in those with aneurysms. The retrospective evaluation of the initial CT- and angiographic findings of 773 patients with spontaneous SAH, who underwent (up to three) 4-vessel DSA, brought a percentage of 12.4% with negative angiography. We found the favourable prognosis of these patients with negative angiography not only to be dependent from the distribution of the hemorrhage, with preference to perimesencephalic pattern, but the initial clinical state. 85% of our patients, who presented with perimesencephalic blood pattern and even 80% of those patients with additional intraventricular hemorrhage but the good clinical condition of Hunt-Hess I/II were discharged without neurological deficits.

A correlation with radiographic angiography.,"Cerebral radionuclide angiography with 99mTc pertechnetate (RNA) and directional Doppler sonography (DS) were employed to study patients with cerebrovascular disease (CBVD). The 86 patients investigated were divided following radiographic angiography (RGA) into normals (n = 26) and into patients with intracranial (n = 22) and extracranial (n = 38) vascular lesions. Of the patients with angiographically demonstrated CBVD, RNA detected 90%, DS 53.3%. The combined evaluation had a sensitivity of 93.3%. If intracranial arterial disease was excluded, the sensitivity of the studies was 92.1% for RNA and 84.2% for DS and combined evaluation had a sensitivity of 97.4%. The diagnostic accuracy by combined evaluation was 93.8% for the extracranial arterial lesions if the clinical findings were also used in patients with normal RGA pattern.

The differentiation is extremely important because of the different treatment regimens. We compared the findings of six patients with biopsy-proven IAN with the data of six patients with BE. Patients with IAN were younger (27-62 years) and presented with multiple strokes (n = 4), intracerebral hemorrhage (n = 1), epileptic seizures (n = 2), or encephalopathy (n = 1). All IAN patients had pathologic cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings (pleocytosis n = 5; protein elevation n = 4), and angiography revealed multilocular stenoses in two cases while digital subtraction angiography was normal in four. BE patients (32-77 years) presented multiple (n = 3) or single ischemic strokes (n = 2) or encephalopathy and headache (n = 2). While all patients showed inflammatory serum findings (C-reactive protein n = 6, leucocytosis n = 4), CSF-pleocytosis was present in two cases only. Angiography revealed a vasculitic pattern in two patients. The diagnosis of BE was established based on transesophageal echocardiography and blood cultures. Leptomeningeal and brain biopsies performed in two cases were normal. Both IAN and BE may present multiple strokes and encephalopathy. The frequency of a vasculitic pattern in angiography is similar in both conditions. While inflammatory serum findings are the rule in BE, pathologic CSF findings were present in all IAN patients. Transesophageal echocardiography and blood cultures should be performed in order to diagnose or exclude BE. Without brain biopsy, immunosuppressive therapy may be dangerous in suspected IAN."

CD009372,0,21807345,0,ACR Appropriateness Criteria® on cerebrovascular disease.,"Stroke is the sudden onset of focal neurologic symptoms due to ischemia or hemorrhage in the brain. Current FDA-approved clinical treatment of acute ischemic stroke involves the use of the intravenous thrombolytic agent recombinant tissue plasminogen activator given <3 hours after symptom onset, following the exclusion of intracerebral hemorrhage by a noncontrast CT scan. Advanced MRI, CT, and other techniques may confirm the stroke diagnosis and subtype, demonstrate lesion location, identify vascular occlusion, and guide other management decisions but, within the first 3 hours after ictus, should not delay or be used to withhold recombinant tissue plasminogen activator therapy after the exclusion of acute hemorrhage on noncontrast CT scans. MR diffusion-weighted imaging is highly sensitive and specific for acute cerebral ischemia and, when combined with perfusion-weighted imaging, may be used to identify potentially salvageable ischemic tissue, especially in the period >3 hours after symptom onset. Advanced CT perfusion methods improve sensitivity to acute ischemia and are increasingly used with CT angiography to evaluate acute stroke as a supplement to noncontrast CT. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria(®) are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed every 2 years by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and review include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of a well-established consensus methodology (modified Delphi) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures by the panel.

Hypertension-associated disease of small-diameter penetrating cerebral arteries may produce either lacunar infarction or intracerebral hemorrhage. The role of hypertension in the pathogenesis of atherothromboembolic cerebral infarction must be questioned in view of the evidence that antihypertensive therapy does not prevent myocardial infarction. Hypertension, in the absence of rheumatic heart disease, is frequently associated with atrial fibrillation. The incidence of stroke due to embolization of thrombus from the fibrillating left atrium of the nonrheumatic heart may have been overestimated in the past. Ideally, investigation of the patient who has had a stroke should include a brain-imaging study and a cerebral arteriogram. In practice, however, arteriography cannot always be justified. Treatment of the completed stroke is unsatisfactory but tissue plaminogen activator and calcium-channel blockers hold promise for cerebral infarction. Surgical decompression of the posterior fossa can be life-saving in cases of cerebellar infarction or hemorrhage.

A 3D sequence was acquired with the time-of-flight technique, using a transmitter-receiver cranial coil, followed by a strictly receiver Helmoltz coil on a 1 Tesla magnet. Two examiners evaluated the carotid bifurcations and measured the degree of stenosis in terms of diameters, according to the north american symptomatic carotid endarterectomy trial (NASCET). Five classes were established: class 1: normal; class 2: 1 to 29%; class 3: 30 to 69%; class 4: 70 to 99% and class 5: thrombosis. The results obtained in the determination of classes were identical with both coils: the coefficient of correlation with straight angiography were 0.973 with the cranial coil and 0.966 with the Helmoltz coil. Five stenoses were overestimated and classified as Class 3 instead of Class 2. The five stenoses greater than 70% (Class 4) showed a signal-void area at their level, due to severe dephasing induced by turbulences. Finally, there was a false-negative image of occlusion: the high-intensity signal of the thrombus was mistaken for one of flow. The data of our study were in accordance with the excellent results obtained by several authors in the literature, which makes it possible for us to propose this type of examination as a novel mean of investigating bifurcations of carotid arteries. Provided a strict technique is applied, and in addition to carotid bifurcation the Willis' circle and the cerebral parenchyma are explored, MR-angiography can complete the results of Doppler-echo. Standard arteriography could then be reserved to surgical patients and to those with discordant results of MR-arteriography and Doppler echo systems."

Subsequent 123I-IMP-single photon emission tomography (SPECT) revealed marked reduction of cerebral blood flow and disturbed reactivity to acetazolamide in the left cerebral hemisphere. Superficial temporal artery (STA)-MCA anastomosis was performed to improve cerebral blood flow and reduce hemodynamic stress for AN of the A-com and right MCA.

CD009372,0,15105978,1,Detection of intracranial aneurysms with multislice CT: comparison with conventional angiography.,"We assessed the diagnostic accuracy of multislice CT in detection of intracranial aneurysms in patients presenting with subarachnoid or intracranial haemorrhage. Multislice CT and multiplanar digital subtraction angiography (DSA) images were obtained in 50 consecutive patients presenting with subarachnoid (SAH) and/or intracranial haemorrhage and reviewed by three neuroradiologists for the number, size and site of any aneurysms. The CT data were assessed using multiplanar reformats (MPR), maximum-intensity projections (MIP), surface-shaded display (SSD) and volume-rendering (VRT). In conventional angiography 51 aneurysms were detected in 41 patients. CT angiography (CTA) showed up to 48 aneurysms in 39 patients, depending on the observer. The overall sensitivity of multislice CT was 83.3% for small (< 4 mm), 90.6% for medium-size (5-12 mm) and 100% for large (> 13 mm) aneurysms. The sensitivity of multislice CTA to medium-size and large intracranial aneurysm is within the upper part of the range reported for helical single-slice CT. However, as small aneurysms may not be found, DSA remains the standard technique for investigation of SAH."

CD009372,0,23498376,0,Haptoglobin phenotype predicts cerebral vasospasm and clinical deterioration after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.,"Vasospasm (VS) and delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) are thought to greatly affect prognosis. Haptoglobin (Hp) is a hemoglobin-binding protein expressed by a genetic polymorphism (1-1, 2-1, and 2-2). Our objects were to investigate whether the Hp phenotype could predict the incidence of cerebral infarction, favorable outcome, clinical deterioration by DCI, and angiographical VS after aneurysmal SAH. Ninety-five consecutive patients who underwent clipping or coil embolization were studied. Favorable functional outcome was defined as a modified Rankin Scale score of 0-2 at 3 months. Angiographical VS was diagnosed based on cerebral angiography findings performed between days 7 and 10 after SAH. The Hp 2-2 group had a significantly greater risk of angiographical VS than that of Hp 2-1 and 1-1 groups combined on univariate (odds ratio [OR]: 3.60, confidence interval [CI]: 1.49-8.67, P = .003) and multivariate logistic regression analyses after being adjusted for age, sex, Fisher groups, and other risk factors (OR: 3.75, CI: 1.54-9.16, P = .004). The Hp 2-2 group also showed the tendency of a greater risk of clinical deterioration by DCI with marginal significance on univariate and age- and sex-adjusted analyses (univariate OR: 2.46, CI: .90-6.74, P = .080; age- and sex-adjusted OR: 2.46, CI: .89-6.82, P = .080) but not after being adjusted for other multiple risk factors. The Hp 2-2 group was not associated with the favorable 3-month outcome and cerebral infarction (univariate: P = .867, P = .209; multivariate: P = .905, P = .292). The Hp phenotype seems to be associated with a higher rate of angiographical VS and clinical deterioration by DCI but does not affect the incidence of cerebral infarction and favorable outcome."

The study subjects were 30 adults with moyamoya disease. Unilateral STA-MCA anastomosis was conducted in 7 of these 30 cases, and bilateral STA-MCA anastomosis was conducted in 8 of these 30 cases. Therefore, anastomosis was performed in a total of 23 sides. The postoperative clinical course was observed for more than 5 years after the STA-MCA anastomosis. Cerebral hemorrhage occurred after operation in 2 sides (8.7%) among the 23 sides that received STA-MCA anastomosis. On the contrary, hemorrhage occurred during conservative therapy in 5 sides (13.5%) among 37 non-operation sides (no significance in chi2 test). Cerebral infarction occurred in 3 sides (13%) among 23 sides treated with STA-MCA anastomosis. However, the infarction occurred in 2 sides (5.4%) among the 37 non-operation sides (no significance in chi2 test). Cerebral hemorrhage tended to occur less frequently after STA-MCA anastomosis, and bypass surgery was suggested to have some beneficial effect in preventing cerebral hemorrhage in adult moyamoya disease. However, it was revealed that STA-MCA anastomosis exacerbated the brain ischemia. Therefore, strict management is mandatory in the perioperative period."

CD009372,0,8676838,0,Diagnostic testing for the evaluation of headaches.,"Headaches are one of the most common symptoms that neurologists evaluate. Although most are caused by primary disorders, the list differential diagnoses is one of the longest in all of medicine, with over 300 different types and causes. The cause or type of most headaches can be determined by a careful history supplemented by a general and neurologic examination. Reasons for obtaining neuroimaging include medical indications as well as anxiety of patients and families and medico-legal concerns. In the era of managed care, concerns over deselection and negative capitation may dissuade the physician from ordering even a medically indicated scan. The yield of neuroimaging in the evaluation of patients with headache and a normal neurologic examination is quite low. Combining the results of multiple studies performed since 1977 for a total of 3026 scans reveals the overall percentages of various pathologies as: brain tumors, 0.8%; arteriovenous malformations, 0.2%; hydrocephalus, 0.3%; aneurysm, 0.1%; subdural hematoma, 0.2%; and strokes, including chronic ischemic processes, 1.2%. EEG is not useful in the routine evaluation of patients with headache. Similarly, the yield of neuroimaging in the evaluation of migraine is quite low. Combining the results of multiple studies performed since 1976 for a total of 1440 scans of patients with various types of migraine, the overall percentages of various pathologies are: brain tumor, 0.3%; arteriovenous malformation, 0.07%; and saccular aneurysm, 0.07%. WMA have been reported on MRI studies of patients with all types of migraine, with a range from 12% to 46%. The cause of WMA in migraine is not certain. Cerebral atrophy has been variable reported as more frequent and no more frequent in migraineurs compared with controls. The ""first or worst"" headache has a long list of possible causes and always includes the possibility of acute subarachnoid hemorrhage. Headaches--especially the sentinel type caused by SAH--often are misdiagnosed. The probability of detecting an aneurysmal hemorrhage of CT scans performed at various intervals after the ictus is: day 0.95%; day 3, 74%; 1 week, 50%; 2 weeks, 30%; and 3 weeks, almost nil. The location of a ruptured saccular aneurysm often is suggested by the predominant site of the SAH. The probability of detecting xanthochromia with spectrophotometry in the CSF at various times after a subarachnoid hemorrhage is: 12 hours, 100%; 1 week, 100%; 2 weeks, 100%; 3 weeks, more than 70%; and 4 weeks, more than 40%. The management of thunderclap headaches with normal CT scan and CSF examinations is controversial. Most patients have a benign course but an unruptured saccular aneurysm occasionally may be responsible for the headache. MR angiography may be a reasonable test to obtain instead of a cerebral arteriogram in many of these cases. About 30% to 90% of patients have headaches of various types and causes after mild head injury. Although most headaches are relatively benign, perhaps 1% to 3% of these patients have life-threatening pathology, including subdural and epidural hematomas, that are detected on CT and MRI scans. Headaches caused by subdural hematomas can be nonspecific. When new-onset headaches begin in patients over the age of 50 years, the physician always should consider whether it may be a secondary headache disorder requiring specific diagnostic testing and treatment. Up to 15% of patients 65 years and over who present to neurologists with new-onset headaches may have serious pathology such as stroke, TA, neoplasm, and subdural hematoma. Headaches are the most common symptom of TA, reported by 60% to 90%. The only over the temple. The diagnosis of TA is based on a high index of clinical suspicion that usually but not always is confirmed by laboratory testing. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate can be normal in 10% to 36% of patients with TA. A superficial temporal artery biopsy can give a false-negative result in 5% to 44% of patients."

We assessed all subjects clinically by neurological examination (quantified on the Canadian Neurological Scale or CNS), by three-dimensional transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD-3D) and by computed tomography (CT) within 24 h of the acute event, repeating CT 15 days later. 15 patients also underwent magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and digital subtraction angiography (DSA). We used the following Doppler parameters: interhemispheric asymmetry index (AI), mean flow velocity (mV) and pulsatility index (PI) for the middle cerebral artery (MCA). The difference between patients and controls on analysis of the variance (ANOVA) in respect of AI was significant: F = 50.8, p < 0.0001. The CNS-AI correlation was equally valid: r = -0.56, p < 0.001. The CNS-CT correlation proved to be highly significant: r = -0.72, p < 0.0001.

CD009372,0,8837799,0,The role of computed tomographic angiography in the diagnosis of intracranial aneurysms and emergent aneurysm clipping.,"Conventional cerebral angiography has always been regarded as the gold standard for intracranial aneurysm detection. However, conventional angiography has the disadvantages of being invasive and time consuming. We present here 30 patients who underwent computed tomographic angiography (CTA) with three-dimensional reconstruction for the detection of intracranial aneurysms. All of these patients had subarachnoid hemorrhage or suspected intracranial aneurysms. CTA was performed in all patients with the use of a General Electric Hispeed Advantage helical scanner. Iohexol, 135 ml, was used as the contrast agent. Twenty-five patients also underwent conventional angiography for comparison. The five patients who underwent CTA only did not have conventional angiography because of poor clinical condition, and four of them subsequently died. Five patients had subarachnoid hemorrhage, but the results of both CTA and conventional angiography were negative for aneurysms. One patient had an incidental finding of a 3-mm left posterior communicating artery aneurysm on CTA, which was confirmed by conventional angiography. In the remaining 19 patients, 19 saccular aneurysms and 1 fusiform aneurysm were detected by CTA. Locations and sizes were confirmed by conventional angiography in all except two. The first exception was a patient who had a 2.5-mm anterior communicating artery aneurysm detected by CTA but not by conventional angiography. Surgical exploration confirmed the CTA diagnosis. The other exception was a patient in whom a 2-mm right posterior communicating artery aneurysm was detected by CTA but in whom conventional angiography showed a 2-mm left posterior communicating artery aneurysm. Unfortunately, there was no surgical confirmation in this case because the family of the patient refused surgery. Our results have demonstrated that CTA is a quick, reliable, and relatively simple diagnostic tool for intracranial aneurysms. In an emergent situation, such as a deteriorating patient with a hematoma, it is superior to either empiric exploration or infusion computed tomographic scans because it delineates the orientation and configuration of the aneurysm and its associated vascular anatomy."

CD009372,0,20636713,0,Fibromuscular dysplasia of cervical and intracranial arteries.,"Fibromuscular dysplasia is an uncommon, segmental, nonatherosclerotic arterial disease of unknown aetiology. The disease primarily affects women and involves intermediate-sized arteries in many areas of the body, including cervical and intracranial arteries. Although often asymptomatic, fibromuscular dysplasia can also be associated with spontaneous dissection, severe stenosis that compromises the distal circulation, or intracranial aneurysm, and is therefore responsible for cerebral ischaemia or subarachnoid haemorrhage. Fibromuscular dysplasia affects middle and distal portions of the internal carotid and vertebral arteries, and occasionally, intracranial arteries. Several pathological and angiographic patterns exist. The most frequent pathological type is medial fibromuscular dysplasia, which is associated with the 'string of beads' angiographic pattern. Unifocal lesions are less common and can be associated with several pathological subtypes. The pathophysiology of the disease is widely unknown. Fibromuscular dysplasia may in fact result from various causes and reflect a non-specific response to different insults. The poor knowledge of the natural history and the lack of randomised trials that compared the different treatment options do not allow any satisfactory judgement to be made regarding the need for or the efficacy of any treatment."
CD009372,0,23417929,0,Subarachnoid haemorrhage with bilateral intracranial vertebral artery dissecting aneurysms treated by staged endovascular stenting.,"Bilateral vertebral artery dissecting aneurysms (VADAs) presenting with subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) are an exceedingly rare and deadly clinical dilemma. Prompt intervention in the case of unilateral VADAs is advocated to prevent rebleed; however, in the case of bilateral VADAs, the optimal therapeutic intervention is unclear. We describe the case of a patient presenting with SAH with bilateral VADAs treated by staged endovascular stenting. This led to resolution of the aneurysms with patency of both vertebral arteries. Stent-based therapy of the symptomatic aneurysm followed by staged stenting of the asymptomatic, contralateral aneurysm appears to be a viable treatment option. This method allows the ability to preserve flow in both vertebral arteries with minimal changes in flow characteristics that may threaten the contralateral, asymptomatic VADA, and appears to be the ideal treatment in these rare cases."

The objective of this study was to estimate the sensitivity of 16-detector CT for the diagnosis of non-traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage in the Emergency Department (ED). A retrospective review was performed in an academic tertiary care hospital. Patients presenting to the ED from September 2003 through December 2004 with symptoms suggestive of subarachnoid hemorrhage and having a final diagnosis of non-traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage were eligible for study. Diagnosis was established by positive 16-detector CT examination of the brain, or spinal fluid analysis. Patient demographics and results of CT, angiogram, and spinal fluid analysis were reviewed. Sensitivity of 16-detector CT was calculated by comparing CT results and cerebral angiogram results. Refined Wilson Simple Asymptotic 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Sixty-one consecutive patients met the study criteria and had a final diagnosis of non-traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage. One of these patients did not have subarachnoid hemorrhage identified by 16-detector CT, but had a positive lumbar puncture and an aneurysm confirmed on cerebral angiography. Sensitivity of 16-detector CT for subarachnoid hemorrhage was 97% (95% confidence interval 84-100%). Sixteen-detector CT did not improve detection of non-traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage when compared with studies using single-detector CT.

They were followed up for 4 to 6 weeks and cerebral angiography was performed if indicated. CT scanning has identified a subset of these patients who have sustained a reversible ischemic neurologic deficit (RIND) rather than a completed stroke. The timing for angiography and surgery for this group has not been established. In an earlier study we found that 21% (4 of 19 patients) suffered a second stroke during the 4- to 6-week waiting period. To avoid this high rate of recurrence, we instituted an aggressive program of CT scan evaluation and surgical therapy for all ""stroke patients"" with negative CT scans. Two hundred forty-five patients were seen with a persistent neurologic deficit between July 1980 and December 1983. These patients underwent CT scans 1 and 5 days after the initial event. Of these 245 patients, 171 patients (70%) were found to have negative CT scans. Appropriate carotid lesions were found by arteriography in 110 (64%) of the negative CT scan group. There were 61 (55%) men and 49 (45%) women in this group. Eighty-five patients (77%) had previous neurologic symptoms or a cerebrovascular accident. Hypertension was present in 52% and diabetes mellitus in 30%. All 110 patients underwent carotid endarterectomy within 14 days (mean 10 days) of the initial onset of their neurologic deficit; these were all done with shunt protection.

She was managed conservatively for 1 year, then suffered right total ophthalmoplegia associated with enlargement of the aneurysm. Two months later, she became comatose due to intracerebral hemorrhage in the right temporal lobe. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated further enlargement of the aneurysm. Emergency craniotomy found the lateral dural wall of the cavernous sinus was markedly expanded and torn by compression from the aneurysm. Rupture of the aneurysm into the intradural space through this dural defect was confirmed. The aneurysm was trapped after high-flow bypass, but the patient did not recover and died.

Case report.","A 45-year-old man presented with bilateral acute subdural hematomas (ASDHs) without subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). He was found comatose in a parked car. Computed tomography showed left frontal intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and bilateral ASDHs but no signs of SAH. Magnetic resonance angiography demonstrated an internal carotid artery dorsal wall aneurysm. Emergent surgical intervention was performed. However, he died of cerebral herniation 6 days later. We inferred that massive intracranial bleeding might have ruptured through the cortex and lacerated the arachnoid membrane. Aneurysm rupture generally results in unilateral SDH, whereas trauma is the usual cause of bilateral ASDHs with ICH. Our case suggests that ruptured aneurysm should be considered in patients with non-traumatic bilateral ASDHs without SAH."

Although no trials directly comparing intra-arterial and i.v. delivery of thrombolytics exist, intra-arterial thrombolysis has several potential advantages, including angiographic assessment of the thrombus and the site of occlusion and collateral circulation, improved recanalization, and delivery of higher local concentrations of thrombolytic agents and extending the therapeutic time window for treatment. We conducted a retrospective audit of our experience with the use of intra-arterial urokinase to treat acute ischaemic stroke at an Australian tertiary-care hospital between June 1993 and June 2003. We examined time from stroke onset to assessment, computerized tomography scan, cerebral angiography and thrombolysis, anatomical classification of intra-arterial thrombus, rates of symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage, and clinical outcome at 3 months. We believe that in carefully selected individuals in appropriate centres of expertise, intra-arterial thrombolytic therapy holds great promise."

CD009372,0,7713091,0,Non-selective digital subtraction angiography in comparison with selective conventional angiography in the diagnosis of carotid artery disease.,"In the recent past, non-selective arterial digital subtraction angiography (NSDSA) seemed a less invasive alternative to conventional filmscreen angiography (CFA) in the diagnosis of carotid artery disease. NSDSA obviated the need for selective catheterization with its associated risks but yet took advantage of the DSA method. However, this technique has not found general application although there are no reports that formally assess the (dis)advantages of NSDSA. The aim of our study was to compare the reliability of NSDSA with CFA in evaluation of carotid bifurcations in patients with transient ischemic attacks or partial stroke by reviewing prospectively collected data. Over a 2-year period, 40 patients (upper age limit 65 years) underwent both NSDSA and CFA. Bilateral NSDSA was performed in all 40 patients (80 bifurcations). Bilateral CFA was performed in 27 patients whereas unilateral CFA was carried out in 13 patients (67 bifurcations). Inter- and intra-observer variability for the degree of stenosis was determined by calculation of kappa-values for a 4-point and a 2-point scale. The proportion of interpretable studies was significantly lower in NSDSA. The inter- and intra-observer agreement was on average better in CFA examinations, though the difference was only statistically significant for the inter-observer agreement. The results of our study indicate that images obtained with NSDSA give less reliable information about carotid artery disease than images obtained with CFA. This is in accordance with the fact that NSDSA now seems an abandoned technique."
CD009372,0,22958770,0,Fatal hemorrhage in cerebral proliferative angiopathy.,"Cerebral proliferative angiopathy (CPA) is a rare vascular abnormality with several angiomorphological features that are distinct from brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). The natural history of CPAs indicates a lower risk for hemorrhage compared to brain AVMs. A 62-year-old woman presented with gait instability and dysarthria. MRI and angiography revealed a diffuse vascular network involving the tectum and cerebellar vermis with intermingled brain parenchyma. This lesion had no dominant feeder, high-flow arteriovenous shunt, flow-related aneurysm or highly dilated veins on angiogram. These findings were consistent with a diagnosis of CPA. During follow-up, she developed progressive gait instability and eye movement abnormalities, but no remarkable change was detected on the repeated MRI and angiography. Nine years later, she died of mesencephalic hemorrhage originating from the CPA. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first description of a patient with CPA who died as a result of the initial hemorrhage. It is important to recognize that a part of CPAs is aggressive and can be more vulnerable to critical hemorrhage."

A 73-year-old male patient was admitted for a complaint of convulsion. Under CT examination, a tumor was observed at the left frontal convexity and found to be fed by the middle cerebral artery shown in the left cerebral angiograms. The tumor was diagnosed meningioma. After removing the tumor, we conducted histological study. Gross findings of its cross section had an atypical bleeding pattern which was resulted from the ruptures of the criss-crossing internal and external carotid arteries in the tumor. The findings indicated that the tumor was an angiomatous meningioma and contained meningotheliomatous components. The hemorrhage was occurred in the portion of the angiomatous meningioma. The possible reason for the hemorrhage was thought that sudden dynamic changes in blood flow which were triggered by the embolization. The sudden changes could have caused multiple ruptures on pathologic small vessels. Therefore, we strongly recommend that preoperative embolization should be proceeded with caution for exercising a cyst meningioma, since it could increase the possibility of bleeding from pathologic weak vessels."

Because the possible causal factors and clinical manifestations of this disorder are many and varied, imaging plays a primary role in the diagnosis. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, un-enhanced computed tomography (CT), unenhanced time-of-flight MR venography, and contrast material-enhanced MR venography and CT venography are particularly useful techniques for detecting cerebral venous and brain parenchymal changes that may be related to thrombosis. To achieve an accurate diagnosis, it is important to have a detailed knowledge of the normal venous anatomy and variants, the spectrum of findings (venous sinus thrombi and recanalization, parenchymal diffusion or perfusion changes or hemorrhage), other potentially relevant conditions (deep venous occlusion, isolated cortical venous thrombosis, idiopathic intracranial hypertension), and potential pitfalls in image interpretation."

Regions of interest (ROI) studied by MRS included regions appearing normal on MRI as well as regions showing complications of sickle cell disease, including focal deep white matter areas of high signal intensity (deep white matter ischemia, DWMI) seen on long TR images, focal atrophic brain areas, and infarcts. The findings in these studies are summarized as follows: Normal-appearing regions on MRI have normal MRS. In ROI including small areas of DWMI, lactate elevation was not detected, but the levels of N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA) appeared slightly elevated. In areas of DWMI 1-2 cm in size, reduced blood flow could be seen on MRA and lactate elevation could be detected with MRS. When blood flow to a DWMI region was normal, NAA was reduced and there was little lactate elevation, as cell death had already occurred.

CD009372,0,15055330,0,CT angiography ofthe carotid arteries.,"The introduction of multislice scanning has made CT angiography (CTA) a serious competitor to MR angiography (MRA) as a second line method for the evaluation of the carotid arteries. For optimum display of the morphology of stenoses, it is necessary to apply the thinnest possible section collimation (ideally [symbol: see text] 1.25mm). While the scan range is limited for single slice CTA, it is possible to cover the whole supraaortic circulation from the aortic arch to the intracranial vessels using multislice scanning. Timing of contrast injection is important, however, the injection technique for carotid CTA is more forgiving than for other body regions. Image evaluation is mainly based on axial sections and curved planar reformations (CPR). Other techniques only serve as an adjunct to better be able to demonstrate the findings. Most potential pitfalls can be avoided by using the appropriate technique. CTA has been shown to have a pooled sensitivity of 95% and specificity of 98% for the detection of >70% stenoses, even if only older single-slice techniques are used. Differentiation between lipid, fibrous and calcified plaques may be possible, especially with multislice scanning. Multislice CTA can in addition detect tandem stenoses in the region of the carotid origin from the aorta, the carotid siphon, and the intracranial portion of the carotids. CT is able to provide a comprehensive evaluation of patients with acute stroke by using a combined approach of pre-contrast CT to detect hemorrhage and manifest infarction, CT brain perfusion measurements to differentiate between penumbra and infarct and CTA to detect the occluded vessel as well as potential concomitant carotid abnormalities. In summary, carotid CTA has come of age and can be used to quantify stenoses more precisely than ultrasound, to detect tandem stenoses and for the workup of acute stroke patients. The learning objectives include learning how to chose acquisition parameters for carotid CTA, how to process and interpret carotid CTA, to become familiar with the artifacts and pitfalls of carotid CTA, and to comprehend the role of CTA relative to the other modalities for carotid imaging."

Twenty-seven patients with MS and 24 healthy volunteers underwent magnetic resonance imaging and pCASL to assess CBF. Differences in CBF between the two groups and the relationships of CBF values with the T2-hyperintense volume were evaluated. Compared to the healthy volunteers, reduced CBF was found in the bilateral thalami and right frontal region of the MS patients. The volume of the T2-hyperintense lesion was negatively correlated with regional CBF in some areas, such as both thalami.

CD009372,0,9045973,0,The role of duplex sonography and angiography in the investigation of carotid artery disease.,"Some patients with symptomatic carotid stenoses of greater than 70 % benefit from carotid endarterectomy. This study was designed to compare the accuracy of duplex ultrasound with angiography in assessing the degree of carotid stenosis in 73 patients with symptoms of recent carotid territory ischaemia. Ultrasound was found to be most accurate in the group of patients with normal vessels or mild stenoses (0-29 %) when there was 90 % concordance between ultrasound and angiography. Ultrasound was found to be least accurate in the group of patients with severe stenoses (70-99 %) in whom it was more likely to underestimate than to overestimate the degree of stenosis. Only one patient said to have < 30 % stenosis on ultrasonography had a > 70 % stenosis on IADSA. Our results indicate that patients with normal arteries or mild disease shown by ultrasound have a very small chance of having surgically amenable lesions in the neck. Ultrasound is reliable as an exclusory screening test. However, all other stenoses should also be investigated by catheter angiography if surgery is considered. Taking angiography as the reference, only 52 % of patients with severe stenoses, which might be taken as an indication for surgery, were correctly identified on ultrasonography. Ultrasound alone is a poor technique for identifying patients for surgery and a combination of ultrasound screening with angiography for > 30 % stenoses detected by ultrasound is recommended."

Patients underwent computerized tomography because of a suspected associated thoracic or abdominal injury, or indeterminate findings on excretory urography, nephrotomography or angiography. Blunt trauma accounted for 87.1 per cent of the renal injuries and penetrating trauma for 12.9 per cent. The most common findings on computerized tomography were perirenal hematoma in 29.4 per cent, intrarenal hematoma in 24.7 per cent and parenchymal disruption in 17.6 per cent. In 33 patients who underwent laparotomy computerized tomographic staging was confirmed. In contrast, the most common finding on excretory urography, diminished opacification (17 of 53 patients), was found to have no correlation with the severity of renal injury as assessed by computerized tomography or laparotomy. Angiography appreciably understaged 1 of 5 cases by failing to show extracapsular extravasation with parenchymal disruption. All findings on angiography were depicted by computerized tomography. We conclude that computerized tomographic staging for renal trauma is more sensitive and specific than excretory urography, nephrotomography and angiography, and that it should be used primarily when multiple traumatic injuries are suspected, when excretory urography suggests major trauma or is nonspecific and when clinical evidence of major trauma exists, regardless of what excretory urography shows."

CD009372,0,19322683,0,Intracranial microbial aneurysm (infectious aneurysm): current options for diagnosis and management.,"The histopathological characteristic of intracranial microbial aneurysm (MA)-infectious aneurysm is the presence of infection and destruction of the walls of the vessels. It can occur in the setting of predisposing infections that spread by endovascular mechanism (e.g., infective endocarditis) or extravascular mechanism (e.g., meningitis). MA is probably a better term than mycotic, infectious, or infective aneurysm as a wide variety of bacteria, fungi, mycobacteria, and virus can cause MA. Typically MAs are multiple, distal, and fusiform aneurysms, but the angiographic and clinical presentations can vary widely. The most common presentation of MA is intracranial bleed. CT angiography, MR angiography, or Digital subtraction angiography can be deployed to detect MA. By combining the clinical findings, imaging, and angiographic findings, it is possible to arrive at a correct diagnosis in most instances. MAs carry higher risk of rupture and fatal bleed when compared to other aneurysms. The treatment options include antimicrobial therapy, surgery, and endovascular therapy. The management strategy is based on large case series rather than controlled trials. All MA should receive appropriate antibiotic therapy. Ruptured MA with mass effect would require surgery in most situations, while those without mass effect and in non-eloquent locations could also be managed by endovascular therapy. Unruptured MA could be managed according to the size, location, and risk of bleeding-by antibiotic therapy, surgery, or endovascular therapy. Monitoring the resolution of the MA under antibiotic therapy by serial CT angiography is another option, but it carries higher risk of bleeding. Treatment of the underlying predisposing infection is an important component of therapy."

Since cerebral arteries were found to be sensitive to the vasoconstrictor effect of angiotensin II, the possibility of angiotensin's contribution to this vasospasm was investigated. Delayed cerebral arterial spasm was documented angiographically 72 hours after introduction of blood in the subarachnoid space of dogs. Following injection of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, teprotide, repeat cineangiograms at 30, 60, and 90 minutes demonstrated partial or total release of spasm of the basilar artery and its branches. It is concluded that angiotensin II participates in the delayed cerebral vasospasm after hemorrhage, and that angiotensin inhibition may release the spasm and prevent cerebral ischemia."

A 66-year-old female was found unconscious at home and transferred to our hospital in a deep coma on February 9, 1991. Emergency CT scan revealed subarachnoid hemorrhage in the posterior fossa. She was treated conservatively because of her poor neurological status. The angiograms performed on February 13 showed occlusion of the basilar artery and a saccular aneurysm at the cortical branch of the PICA. The contrast material remained in the aneurysm for a long time throughout the venous phase. The left vertebral artery was markedly hypoplastic. The patient improved remarkably after admission and became almost alert late in February, although she still presented tetraparesis, dysfunction of lower cranial nerves and other neurological signs linked with the brain stem. The unusual angiographical findings in this case prompted us to perform the examination again, expecting some angiographical changes. The angiograms taken on March 15 revealed spontaneous disappearance of the aneurysm, although the basilar artery occlusion remained unchanged.

Report of an EFNS task force.,"Neuroimaging techniques are necessary for the evaluation of stroke, one of the leading causes of death and neurological impairment in developed countries. The multiplicity of techniques available has increased the complexity of decision making for physicians. We performed a comprehensive review of the literature in English for the period 1965-2005 and critically assessed the relevant publications. The members of the panel reviewed and corrected an initial draft, until a consensus was reached on recommendations stratified according to the European Federation of Neurological Societies (EFNS) criteria. Non-contrast computed tomography (CT) scan is the established imaging procedure for the initial evaluation of stroke patients. However, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has a higher sensitivity than CT for the demonstration of infarcted or ischemic areas and depicts well acute and chronic intracerebral hemorrhage. Perfusion and diffusion MRI together with MR angiography (MRA) are very helpful for the acute evaluation of patients with ischemic stroke. MRI and MRA are the recommended techniques for screening cerebral aneurysms and for the diagnosis of cerebral venous thrombosis and arterial dissection. For the non-invasive study of extracranial vessels, MRA is less portable and more expensive than ultrasonography but it has higher sensitivity and specificity for carotid stenosis. Transcranial Doppler is very useful for monitoring arterial reperfusion after thrombolysis, for the diagnosis of intracranial stenosis and of right-to-left shunts, and for monitoring vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage. Currently, single photon emission computed tomography and positron emission tomography have a more limited role in the evaluation of the acute stroke patient."

Case report.,"A case of cerebral venous thrombosis due to polycythemia secondary to adaptation to a high altitude is reported. A 27-year-old previously healthy man developed severe neurological symptoms after climbing 8511 m.

CD009372,0,15506314,0,Endovascular treatment of arteriovenous malformation in a child.,"Arteriovenous malformations are direct communications between the arterial and venous circulations without the usual passage through the capillary net. They are the most frequent type of malformations of the intracranial circulation and the second most frequent cause of intracranial hematomas or hemorrhage. We report on a 7-year-old girl with intracerebral hematoma following acute rupture of an arteriovenous malformation. The girl experienced a spontaneous headache and later became unconscious. At the time of admission to the hospital, her neurological status scored 5 on the Glasgow Coma Scale. Computerized tomography of the brain revealed a round hyperdense lesion in the left frontoparietal region. Digital subtractional angiography of the left internal carotid artery confirmed the suspicion of an arteriovenous malformation with one main feeding artery: a distal branch of the left anterior cerebral artery. The nidus was round and about 2 cm in diameter. The venous drainage was of the superficial type, flowing into the left superior sagittal sinus. After consultation with a neurosurgeon, we decided to treat the arteriovenous malformation by means of an endovascular technique. A flow-guided catheter was placed close to the nidus. Control angiography before embolization revealed the proper position for the injection of embolic material. We used the conventional mixture of acrylic polymerization glue, Lipiodol oil contrast medium and particles of tantalum powder. Control angiography at the end of the procedure revealed complete occlusion of the malformation. There were no signs of potential new feeding arteries that could appear as a result of changed hemodynamic conditions after embolization. Endovascular treatment of arteriovenous malformations could become the treatment of choice for these lesions, especially in combination with radiosurgery. The established microsurgical treatment is very effective but carries a higher risk of hemorrhagic complications."
CD009372,0,9813400,0,Diagnosis of cerebral venous thrombosis with routine magnetic resonance: an update.,"Magnetic resonance imaging and angiography is the technique of choice in the diagnosis and follow-up of cerebral venous thrombosis: Thrombosis appears as an absence of flow void on spin echo images and lack of signal in angiographic techniques. The thrombus signal intensity is different on T1 and T2 spin echo weighted images and evolves according to hemoglobin degradation. Recognition of pitfalls and artefacts related to the different magnetic resonance imaging techniques employed is essential to interpret dural venous sinus thrombosis. In this paper the imaging of 27 patients with cerebral venous thromboses is reviewed. We describe the type of signal abnormalities, the different types of clot- and flow-related artefacts, and the indirect signs of cerebral venous thrombosis."
CD009372,0,21493767,0,Is it possible to recognize cervical artery dissection on stroke brain MR imaging? A matched case-control study.,Extracranial CAD accounts for nearly 20% of cases of stroke in young adults. The mural hematoma frequently extends cranially to the petrous carotid segment in cCAD or is distally located in vCAD. We hypothesized that standard brain MR imaging could allow the early detection of CAD of the upper portion of carotid and vertebral arteries.
CD009372,0,6504292,0,Ipsilateral hemiparesis caused by subarachnoid hemorrhage in a patient with a ruptured middle cerebral artery aneurysm: a case report.,"The authors report a patient with a ruptured middle cerebral artery (MCA) aneurysm who presented with ipsilateral hemiparesis. A computed tomographic (CT) scan and cerebral angiograms suggested that the ipsilateral hemiparesis was most likely due to compression by hematoma of the secondary motor area in the island of Reil. Two other cases that demonstrated ipsilateral motor weakness after rupture of MCA aneurysms have been reported. We emphasize not only the importance of considering dysfunction of the secondary motor area in patients with hemiparesis, but also the difficulty in differentiating ipsilateral secondary motor area dysfunction from contralateral primary motor area dysfunction in certain cases without CT scanning and angiography."
CD009372,0,1786128,0,Surgical treatment of pontomedullary cavernomas.,"Direct treatment of brainstem cavernous haemangiomas (cavernomas) naturally represents a considerable surgical challenge due to the close proximity of vital structures. The results of such treatment have only rarely been described. We report our experience in the management of seven patients with cavernomas of the brainstem treated by microsurgical resection. All patients presented with neurological symptoms directly attributable to one or more episodes of brainstem haemorrhage. CT scan examination in all cases revealed either obvious haematoma or a focal region of high density within the pons or medulla; calcification in and around the lesion was detected in two patients. MRI scanning was performed in four of our cases and was strongly suggestive of the diagnosis of cavernoma with evidence of both recent and older haemorrhage as evidenced by haemosiderin deposits. Cerebral angiography failed to disclose abnormal vessels to the cavernoma in any instance, although interestingly a co-existent but separate cerebellar venous malformation was observed in two of our cases. Surgery was performed between 19 days and 3 months following the most recent haemorrhage. Microsurgical removal of both haematoma and underlying cavernoma was accomplished either via a median suboccipital or retromastoid craniectomy, with an appropriate incision being made into that part of the brainstem most directly overlaying the lesion. Significant improvement in neurological function has followed in all seven cases. Although the natural history of symptomatic cavernous haemangiomas is incompletely understood, the favourable results obtained in our patients suggest that total surgical removal is both practicable and relatively safe even in the case of those lesions situated within the brainstem."

Here we present a series of 10 patients with subpial hemorrhage, 53 to 80 years old, diagnosed and treated within the last 4 years at a single center. Patients were identified based on imaging criteria with either magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) showing blood along the cortical surface. Presenting symptoms were diverse, with seizures being the most frequent followed by headaches and focal neurological signs such as sensory or motor deficits. Of 7 patients undergoing lumbar puncture, none showed fresh blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) xanthochromia. Neither digital subtraction angiography (DSA) nor MR venography (MRV) confirmed cerebral vein thrombosis as a possible etiologic factor for subpial hemorrhage. Patients for whom follow-up was available (n=8), showed complete recovery indicating an excellent prognosis. Overall, the etiology of subpial hemorrhage remains obscure.

A large percentage of ischemic strokes is secondary to extracranial carotid and vertebral arterial disease. While digital subtraction angiography has traditionally been used for the initial evaluation of the degree of stenosis, noninvasive imaging has moved to the forefront in the extracranial arterial evaluation.

CD009372,0,19319475,0,Middle meningeal artery aneurysm associated with meningioma.,"Middle meningeal artery aneurysm associated with meningioma is extremely rare, and only two cases have previously been reported. In our case, a 72-year-old woman with convexity meningioma underwent preoperative cerebral angiography, which revealed a flow-related aneurysm on the middle meningeal artery. Embolization of the aneurysm was performed with N-butycyanoacrylate glue, and complete obliteration was confirmed under craniotomy. In order to eliminate the risk of preoperative rupture resulting in intracranial hemorrhage, endovascular embolization with liquid glue is safe and effective for this kind of aneurysm."
CD009372,0,19945250,0,[Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome].,"Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS) is more frequent than previously thought and is probably underdiagnosed. The mean age of onset is 42 years, and it affects slightly more women than men. RCVS is attributed to a transient, reversible dysregulation of cerebral vascular tone, which leads to multifocal arterial constriction and dilation. More than half the cases (60%) are secondary to exposure to vasoactive substances (e.g., cannabis, antidepressants, and nasal decongestants) or occur in the postpartum period. RCVS has a characteristic clinical and radiological course, developing in a single phase after a sudden onset, and there is generally no new event after 1 month. The main pattern of presentation begins with recurrent thunderclap headaches, often triggered by sexual activity or various Valsalva's maneuvers, over a period of 1 to 3 weeks. Seizures and focal neurological deficits are less frequent and generally start after the headaches. Cortical subarachnoid hemorrhage (22%), intracerebral hemorrhage (6%), seizures (3%), and reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy (9%) are early complications, occurring mainly within the first week. Ischemic events, including TIAs (16%) and cerebral infarction (4%), occur significantly later than hemorrhagic strokes, mainly during the second week. Diagnosis requires the demonstration of the characteristic ""string and beads"" on cerebral angiography and can be difficult, for 21% of patients have a normal initial magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and 9% both a normal MRA and a normal transcranial Doppler. In these cases, the initial investigations must be repeated after a few days. The final diagnosis is made when a follow-up MRA shows resolution or at least marked improvement of the arterial abnormalities within 12 weeks. RCVS is sometimes associated with other large artery lesions of the head and neck, including dissections and unruptured aneurysms, especially during the postpartum period. Nimodipine is the treatment most often recommended. In our experience, it is not especially effective in severe RCVS. Relapses are possible but rare and have not yet been reported in prospective series. Although the exact pathophysiology remains speculative, strong recommendations against vasoactive substances appear prudent."

CD009372,0,1632359,0,MR angiography of the head and neck: value of two-dimensional phase-contrast projection technique.,"MR angiography is commonly performed by using two- and three-dimensional time-of-flight and three-dimensional phase-contrast techniques. These procedures require long examination times and processing of imaging data by computing maximum intensity projections. Two-dimensional phase-contrast projection angiography has neither of these disadvantages. We analyzed the value of this technique for head and neck MR angiography in 84 patients and 15 control subjects. Patients were examined to resolve specific clinical questions such as the presence of arteriovenous malformations (20 cases), patency of carotid and vertebral arteries (35 cases), patency of the superior sagittal sinus (14 cases), patency of saphenous vein bypass grafts (11 cases), and vascularity of masses (four cases). Conventional angiograms were available for correlation in 22 patients. Two-dimensional phase-contrast projection angiograms were generated by using a gradient-recalled-echo sequence sensitized to flow with the use of flow-encoding gradients. Projection MR angiograms were obtained in approximately 3.5 min by combining images obtained with flow-encoding gradients applied along the axes defining the image plane. MR angiograms were subjectively evaluated by three observers without reference to routine MR images or conventional angiograms. High-quality studies were obtained in 93% of control subjects and 90% of patients examined. The findings based on phase-contrast angiography were confirmed with conventional angiography in 21 of 22 patients for whom conventional angiograms were available. Evaluation of vascular grafts and of the patency of major cranial vessels was easily done with two-dimensional phase-contrast angiography and was useful in postoperative follow-up examinations. We also advocate its use for superior sagittal sinus thrombosis and follow-up examinations in patients with arteriovenous malformations."
CD009372,0,9420433,0,Fatal subarachnoid hemorrhage from an inflammatory cavernous carotid artery aneurysm: failure of conservative treatment after early diagnosis--case report.,"Inflammatory carotid artery aneurysm is a rare complication of acute paranasal sinusitis. A 50-year-old female presented with a ruptured giant carotid artery aneurysm secondary to infection of the sphenoid sinus and cavernous sinus. She had been healthy until 5 days before admission, when she developed orbital phlegmon and meningitis. She received antibiotic therapy for 10 days. Computed tomography (CT) of the brain 2 days after admission showed no abnormality. However, repeat CT on day 6 showed a round isodense mass in the suprasellar cistern suggesting a cerebral aneurysm. Twelve days after admission, she suffered a fatal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Cerebral angiography revealed a giant left cavernous carotid artery aneurysm with a very irregular shape. Autopsy found sphenoid sinusitis and osteomyelitis extending into the cavernous sinuses. Diagnosis of bacterial inflammatory aneurysms before rupture is very important. Appropriate surgical intervention should be considered if there is enlargement of the original aneurysm or appearance of a new aneurysm indicating a potentially dangerous situation."

The patient was a 14-month-old boy. Two months after intracardiac repair for a complex congenital heart disease, he presented with low-grade fever and was placed on oral antibiotics. A month later an echocardiography revealed 2 vegetations on the tricuspid valve. Although the vegetations became smaller with intravenous antibiotics, right hemiplegia was noted 5 weeks later. Brain CT and MR-angiography demonstrated left middle cerebral artery embolism. For fear of another embolism caused by a remaining movable vegetation on the tricuspid valve, intra-atrial vegetation removal under CPB was performed 5 days after cerebral infarction. Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography was utilized to locate the vegetation and confirm its removal. His postoperative course was uneventful without a recurrence of cerebral infarction or bleeding. He was weaned from the ventilator on postoperative day (POD) 1, started to move the right extremities on POD 5 and was discharged home on POD 66."

The risk factors for incidental embolism after cerebral angiography were retrospectively examined using diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) in 180 patients who underwent 247 angiography procedures, consisting of 174 diagnostic angiography and 73 interventional procedures, and magnetic resonance imaging including DWI within 72 hours after angiography. The two neuroradiologists in our hospital detected embolism after cerebral angiography as high-intensity lesions (HIL) on DWI. The relationships between HIL on DWI and procedural factors were evaluated. DWI after cerebral angiography revealed HIL related to the procedure in 72 of 247 angiographies. In all procedures, age (p < 0.01), past history of cerebral infarction (p < 0.05), anti-platelet therapy (p < 0.05), neuro-intervention (p < 0.01), and total amount of contrast medium (odds ratio [OR] 2.125, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.045-4.321) were significantly correlated with HIL. In diagnostic angiography, the performance of the procedure by a resident operator (OR 2.526, 95% CI 1.214-5.254) was significantly correlated with HIL. Age, past history of cerebral infarction, and previous anti-platelet therapy determined the risk of atherosclerotic changes in patients. The neuro-intervention and total amount of contrast medium used could predict the risk of time limitations for angiography. Resident operator is also a risk factor. This study demonstrates the importance of improving the risk of time limitations for angiography and the risk due to operator inexperience. Further training of residents may be needed to reduce the occurrence of embolic complications."

Craniogram showed in linear fracture in the left paritotemporal regions. In the CT scan, intraventricular hemorrhage associated with subarachnoid hemorrhage without intracerebral hematoma was shown. A symmetrical moderate dilatation of both lateral ventricles was also shown. Cerebral angiography revealed no abnormality. His condition deteriorated progressively, so ventricular drainage was performed, but he expired 5 days later. Considering this case, the mechanisms of pure intraventricular hemorrhage following head injury were discussed."
CD009372,0,11834281,0,Moyamoya disease in a Hispanic child: a case report.,"Moyamoya disease was initially described by Suzuki and Takaku in 1963 as a radiographic phenomenon relating to the tiny collateral vessels characteristic of the disease that resemble a cloud or puff of smoke. The disease is rare and initially it was believed that the disease was confined to the Japanese population. It consists of occlusive vascular disease at the Circle of Willis with a tendency toward multiple ischemic neurological events and small strokes. In older populations it can often be associated with further vascular degeneration and intracerebral hemorrhage. This paper discusses the diagnosis, treatment, and management of moyamoya disease in a Hispanic child."

A 73-year-old man with left ICA occlusion and no presence of moyamoya disease criteria underwent xenon-enhanced computed tomography with acetazolamide challenge test. The findings showed hypoperfusion and no vasoreactivity in the territory of the left middle cerebral artery. During follow-up he suffered bleeding in the left frontoparietal lobe. Cerebral angiography showed left ICA occlusion and cross flow via the anterior communicating artery without moyamoya vessels. Long-term ischaemia would make perforating or anastomotic arteries vulnerable. These arteries were easily ruptured by hypertension, resulting in intracerebral haemorrhage."

The patient was a 24-year-old female. She consulted our hospital because of a fever and was diagnosed with IE and a cerebral hemorrhage. A blood culture test on admission revealed methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed giant vegetation in the left atrium. Besides the management of an acute-stage cerebral hemorrhage, medical therapy for IE was performed. However, a severe infection was refractory, and mitral-regurgitation-related heart failure deteriorated. Despite acute-stage cerebral hemorrhage, mitral valve replacement was performed 10 days after admission because advanced disseminated intravascular coagulation syndrome made conservative management difficult. After surgery, neither exacerbation of cerebral symptoms nor recurrent IE was noted, and the patient was discharged."

Arteriography is the standard test for determining the presence of vasospasm. A retrospective review of 16 patients with cerebral aneurysm was undertaken to assess the sensitivity and specificity of SPECT for diagnosis of vasospasm. Fourteen patients were hospitalized after subarachnoid hemorrhage and 2 patients were hospitalized for elective aneurysmal clipping.

CD009372,0,7748357,0,Magnetic resonance angiography in 140 neuropediatric patients.,"Three-dimensional magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) is a noninvasive technique that images the intracranial arterial vasculature without contrast agents. The suitability of MRA was evaluated for routine use and all children were prospectively studied with conventional MR imaging and time off flight MRA (FISP3D). All MR studies were performed on a 1.5 T-MRA system using a circularly polarized head coil. The study comprised 140 children, ages 3 weeks to 18 years, with different neuropediatric diseases. Major cervical and intracranial arteries were visualized in all age groups. Smaller branches of the supratentorial arteries were identified inconstantly and the number of arteries visualized increased up to the age of 6 years. Sixty-seven children (47%) had normal intracranial vasculature. MRA demonstrated anatomic variations in 21 patients (15%). Twenty-two of 32 children with congenital malformations demonstrated abnormalities of the intracranial vasculature. The diagnostic value of MRA was confirmed in 11 of 12 patients after neonatal stroke and in 3 of 10 children after stroke at older ages. Seven of 18 children with acute hemorrhage demonstrated arteriovenous malformations or an aneurysm on MRA. The correlation with digital subtraction angiographic findings was established in 13 patients. In 9 of 13 children with brain tumor, MRA proved to be diagnostically valuable. MRA proved to be of particular value in the evaluation of the carotid artery following extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy. MRA can be used in children of all age groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD009372,0,2031074,0,Recent developments in the diagnosis and management of patients with transient ischaemic attacks and minor ischaemic strokes.,"Appropriate management of the patient with transient focal neurological symptoms must start with accurate clinical diagnosis. Wider use of clear diagnostic criteria and symptom checklists, and better knowledge of the clinical features of the 'funny turns' which are not related to transient focal cerebral ischaemia could reduce the present variability in clinical diagnosis of transient ischaemic attacks. More accurate clinical diagnosis contributes to better selection of the most appropriate investigation strategy for each patient. A basic minimum standard of investigation is outlined and perhaps provides a suitable template for audit. Patients with transient ischaemic attacks which are definitely in the carotid distribution may be eligible for entry in trials of carotid endarterectomy. Prudent use of duplex ultrasound studies of the carotid arteries in patients with appropriate symptoms is an effective way to reduce the costs of investigations and their complications (i.e. the number of strokes associated with cerebral angiography). Digital venous subtraction angiography has, by comparison, many disadvantages as a screening tool. Advances in management include: recent statistical overviews which have emphasized the need to consider blood pressure and plasma cholesterol reduction in a large proportion of patients, and the value of long term anti-platelet therapy in reducing the risks of stroke, myocardial infarction and vascular death in both males and females. The value of anticoagulants in patients with atrial fibrillation and transient ischaemic attacks or minor stroke is being tested in current trials."

CD009372,0,18655265,0,Perfusion imaging with computed tomography: brain and beyond.,"The availability of rapid imaging with multidetector CT systems and commercial analysis software has made perfusion imaging with CT an everyday technique, not only for the brain but also for other body organs. Perfusion imaging is usually performed as an adjunct to a conventional CT examination and is therefore particularly appropriate when a conventional CT is part of routine clinical protocols. The derived values are reproducible and have been validated against a range of reference techniques. Within neuroradiology, perfusion CT has attracted interest in the assessment of acute stroke but can also be used to assess secondary injury in head trauma and as an adjunct to CT angiography to evaluate cerebral spasm in subarachnoid haemorrhage. Within oncology, perfusion CT provides an imaging correlate for tumour vascularity that can be used to discriminate benign and malignant lesions, as an indicator of tumour aggressiveness, to reveal occult tumour and improve the delineation of tumours during radiotherapy planning, and as a functional assessment of tumour response to therapy. By exploiting the ability of CT systems to quantify contrast enhancement, CT perfusion imaging uses contrast media to assess vascular physiology and so improve diagnosis, prognosis, treatment selection and therapy monitoring."

Head computed tomography revealed an irregular intracerebral hematoma in the left temporoparietal region, associated with a tubular high density area compatible with a thrombosed transcerebral vein in the left temporal lobe. The patient was free of coagulopathy. Craniectomy was performed to remove the intracerebral hematoma and venous thrombosis was confirmed. Postoperative cerebral angiography demonstrated extensive venous malformation in the left parietal and occipital lobes. Multiple transcerebral draining veins converged in the vein of Galen associated with a varix. Segmental narrowing of the straight sinus was suggestive of congestion in the venous anomaly. The patient showed progressive recovery following surgery, and was discharged with moderate aphasia, mild right hemiparesis, and right homonymous hemianopsia 1 month later. Venous malformations are usually silent, but occasionally become symptomatic due to thrombosis of the draining vein. The presence of stenosis in the draining route may lead to venous congestion, thrombus formation, and catastrophic hemorrhagic venous infarct."

Twelve hours after the ischemic onset he suddenly complained of severe headache and his consciousness deteriorated. The follow-up CT showed diffuse SAH. Cerebral angiography showed occlusion of the right vertebral artery at the origin of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) and segmental stenosis of the left vertebral artery at the portion distal to the vertebral PICA junction. We treated the patient conservatively. Four days later, he suddenly fell into a coma, but CT showed no bleeding.

These areas of hyperattenuation were noted in the middle cerebral artery territory in the first patient and involving the brainstem, cerebellum, and tentorium in the second. Both were falsely interpreted as subarachnoid hemorrhage. The area of hyperattenuation resolved within a few hours in both patients, reflecting contrast medium extravasation/leakage.

All patients were comatose following head injury (GCS less than or equal to 8) and were treated homogeneously by the same neurosurgical team by a protocol that included immediate resuscitation on arrival, diagnosis of intracranial lesions by angiography, early surgery when needed, mechanical ventilation, steroids, and mannitol. Extracranial lesions, even if preponderant, were treated by various specialists in the Neurosurgical Department, which for all practical purposes operated as an Emergency Department. Admission criteria were very broad with no preadmission selection. The overall mortality for this series was 45%. A little less than half the patients made good recoveries or remained moderately disabled (47%); 6% were severely disabled, and 2% survived in a persistent vegetative state. More than two-thirds of the patients were brought to our Neurosurgical Department after a short stay at a general hospital; 72% were admitted within 6 hours of injury; 71% were traffic accident victims; and 34% had significant associated extracranial injuries. Carotid angiography was performed in 78% of the patients and indicated the presence of an intracranial haematoma requiring surgery in 36% of the whole series. Mortality was significantly higher in operated than in unoperated patients (56% versus 39%); those treated surgically, however, were older, in worse clinical condition, and showed a higher incidence of acute subdural haematomas associated with brain contusion. Carotid angiography proved very effective in revealing the presence of an expansive lesion but failed to reflect the severity of brain damage, since the group with ""negative"" angiograms showed a high mortality (52%). Patients with a lucid interval had a higher percentage of surgical lesions than those with immediate coma (58% versus 26%); but fully 42% of them did not require surgery, and 25% had negative angiograms. From the prognostic point of view the clinical data elicited after initial resuscitation were highly predictive of the outcome: some individual neurological signs, such as mydriasis, posturing and eye movements, were not inferior to the GCS score in that respect. Age also proved a strong predictor, since elderly patients are more likely to have severe subdural and parenchymal lesions and their clinical severity is accordingly greater.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

CD009372,0,4619849,0,[25 years of electroencephalography in cerebrovascular disease].,"The value of the EEG has not been diminished by the advent of new diagnostic procedures and the improvement of older techniques. For electro-encephalography is in essence a 'clinical' method, reflecting in its own particular way, the variable status of the brain. Moreover, in conjunction with these methods the EEG can provide for better information concerning the brain's condition. Furthermore in particular serio-angiography and C.B.F. measurements can furnish us more detailed insight in the EEG phenomena which may occur in differed types of cerebro-vascular disease. Generally the changes of the local EEG phenomena, which may occur in cerebral ischaemia correlate well with the angiographic and r.C.B.F. data. In cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral tumour however the r.C.B.F. values are commonly more diffusely reduced as could be expected from the extent of the EEG disturbances. Increased r.C.B.F. values may be encountered over meningioma due to increased perfusion of the Xenon133 in this electrically inactive tumour; they can also occur in malign glioblastoma, where direct arterio-venous connections are responsable for the so called shunt peaks. These peaks may also be found in patients with arterio-venous malformations or with acute ischaemia, in the latter case due to marked reduction of the local pH. Remarkable was the discrepancy between the local increase of the C.B.F. and the local deterioration in the EEG following intracarotid injection of HC1 papaverine; the same applied to the reaction of EEG and C.B.F. in case of acute induced hypertension with loss of autoregulation."

In 19 patients with ischemic stroke of presumed embolic or non-embolic cause we carried out diffusion-weighted and T2-weighted MR imaging within 48 h of onset, and obtained apparent diffusion coefficient of water (ADCw), and T2 weighted images. We used the signatures obtained from these ADCw/T2 maps to formulate two patterns of damage signifying accelerated or non-accelerated progression of cellular death after stroke onset. Those patients with the accelerated pattern corresponded to those with the neuroradiological (NRC) and clinical diagnosis (TOAST.1 and TOAST.2) of presumed embolic stroke, with clinical diagnosis performed blinded both to NRC and to SM. Agreement between the SM and NRC was substantial (kappa=0.62), moderate (0.60<kappa<0.40) between the SM or NRC and TOAST.2, and fair (0.40<kappa<0.20) among the SM or NRC and TOAST.1.

The patient presented with dysphasia and right hemiparesis. A medical workup revealed endocarditis and associated heart valve dysfunction with no evidence of congestive heart failure. Computed tomography demonstrated subarachnoid hemorrhage, and a subsequent cerebral arteriogram showed a distal left middle cerebral aneurysm, which, as demonstrated by angiography, did not change in size in 2 weeks. An endovascular approach was used to obliterate the aneurysm and its parent vessel. Endovascular techniques may be used to obliterate certain bacterial intracranial aneurysms, particularly in patients who harbor distal aneurysms."

A 34-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital because of headache and vomiting. Computed tomographic scans revealed a diffuse intraventricular hematoma and a thin subarachnoid hemorrhage. Cerebral angiography disclosed a saccular aneurysm in the peripheral portion of the right anterior choroidal artery, which was located in the temporal horn of the right lateral ventricle. We approached the temporal horn through a small inferior temporal incision, and the aneurysm was resected without any neurological damage. A histological examination of the surgical specimen revealed it to be a true aneurysm."
CD009372,0,2390370,0,[Clinical analysis of etiology of spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage diagnosed by computed tomography].,"In 575 cases with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) diagnosed by computed tomography (CT) scan, four vessel cerebral angiography was performed several times at more than two-week intervals to investigate a source of the hemorrhage. The first four-vessel study on admission revealed 530 cases (92.2%) of ruptured cerebral aneurysms, four (0.7%) of ruptured arteriovenous malformation, 25 (4.3%) of unknown etiology. Repeated four vessel study showed eight (32.0%) aneurysms among 25 cases whose first studies were negative. Six of the eight cases had aneurysms in the vertebro-basilar system. In 11 cases, repeated four-vessel study failed to detect the hemorrhagic source; and no generalized diseases were noted. One of them had recurrence of SAH 19 months after the onset of the initial one. The patient was underwent operation, which showed thrombosed ruptured aneurysm. Our present investigation demonstrated that ruptured aneurysm was responsible for 94.8% of all 575 cases of SAH detected by CT scans and 10 cases (1.7%) were diagnosed as cases of SAH of unknown etiology."
CD009372,0,2961755,0,"CT, MRI, and angiography of venous angiomas: a comparative study.","Seventeen venous angiomas in 16 patients were evaluated radiologically at the Montreal Neurological Hospital. Radiologic investigations included contrast-enhanced computed tomograms (CECT) in 15 patients, cerebral angiograms with a long venous phase study in 15, and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging with a spin-echo pulse sequence technique in six. CECT revealed abnormalities including six nodular nonspecific enhancing lesions and nine enhanced draining veins, whereas plain CT revealed intracerebral hemorrhages in four patients and calcification in one. All the angiograms showed the characteristic pattern of venous angiomas consisting of medullary veins converging to a large draining vein during the late venous phase. All six patients examined by MR showed abnormal vascular structures; parenchymal hemorrhages were present in two patients. In five patients with venous angiomas, medullary veins converging to a large draining vein were demonstrated as echo-void curvilinear structures. In two patients, the increased signal from medullary veins in long echo delay sequences was suggestive of a slow venous flow rate. Demonstration of the venous nature of the malformation may, in the future, obviate the need for angiography."
CD009372,0,2718199,0,Hemorrhagic transformation in cerebral embolism.,"We studied the mechanism of hemorrhagic infarction after acute cerebral embolism in 160 patients by brain computed tomography and angiography. Hemorrhagic infarction during the month after the embolic event was evident in 65 patients (40.6%). Initial angiography a median of 1.5 (range 1-60) days after the event revealed occlusion of the cerebral arteries in 117 of 142 patients (82.4%), and reopening of the vessels was observed in 56 (94.9%) of 59 patients who had follow-up angiography a median of 20 (range 3-47) days after the event. The incidence of hemorrhagic infarction was higher in patients greater than or equal to 70 years old (31 of 61, 50.8%) than in those aged 50-69 years (27 of 72, 37.5%) or less than 50 years (seven of 27, 25.9%) (greater than or equal to 70 vs. less than 50, p less than 0.05). In patients with moderate or large infarcts, hemorrhagic infarction developed in 50.0% or 51.5%, respectively, while in those with small infarcts it developed in only 2.9% (p less than 0.05). No correlation was found between hemorrhagic infarction and history of hypertension or blood pressure during the acute stage of stroke. Thrombolytic and/or anticoagulant therapy did not affect the incidence of hemorrhagic infarction (40.0% with vs. 40.7% without therapy) but tended to cause massive hematoma. Our results indicate that hemorrhagic transformation in cerebral embolism is caused not only by reopening of the occluded vessels but also by other factors such as age and size of the infarct. Hypertension per se seems to be less important for hemorrhagic infarction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

The risk of rebleeding and ischemic complications can be markedly reduced when the prompt diagnosis of cerebral aneurysmal rupture is made. The sudden onset of severe headache with or without neurologic deficit raises the clinical suspicion, however atypical symptoms exist making the diagnosis difficult. A 49-year-old male with a 3-day history of neck discomfort, without headache, was admitted following a generalized seizure. A serum sodium of 115 mEq/L was noted. A computed tomographic scan of the brain revealed a subarachnoid hemorrhage. Two intracranial cerebral aneurysms were identified by cerebral angiography and subsequently treated. The diagnosis and treatment of subarachnoid hemorrhage is reviewed."

CD009372,0,2366074,0,Surgical management of hematomas of the brain stem.,"Nine patients with brain-stem hematoma were admitted to the authors' institute during the period from 1985 to 1988. Clinical symptoms and signs pointed to pontine involvement in most cases. Progressive clinical deterioration was quite common and usually led to a clinical diagnosis of brain-stem intra-axial tumor. Angiography was noncontributory; computerized tomography (CT) was the main diagnostic test. This gave evidence of different pathological characteristics, including masses showing highly increased density, nonhomogeneous hyperdense lesions, and isodense lesions with peripheral contrast enhancement. No clear correlation was found, however, between the presumed duration of the clinical picture and the CT characteristics of the lesion. In the last four cases, magnetic resonance imaging was performed using a 0.015-tesla resistive system. This examination usually confirmed the presence of a brain-stem mass already shown by previous CT scans. There were, however, no cases in which direct evidence of an intra-axial vascular malformation could be obtained. The patients were all treated surgically with an attempt at total removal of the lesion and thorough inspection of the hematoma cavity and biopsy. Evidence of ""cryptic"" arteriovenous malformation was obtained in six of the nine cases. There were minor transitory complications in three cases. All of the patients were able to resume their previous activity, and none suffered recurrence of the symptoms following the operation. It may be concluded that surgery is the treatment of choice for brain-stem hematoma."

CD009372,0,22958768,0,Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome: treatment with multiple sessions of intra-arterial nimodipine and angioplasty.,Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS) is characterized by acute severe headache with or without additional neurological symptoms and reversible cerebral vasoconstriction. Unruptured aneurysms have been reported in some cases with RCVS. We describe a severe case of a 50-year-old woman with RCVS presenting as cortical subarachnoid hemorrhage. Cerebral angiogram demonstrated the typical angiographic findings of RCVS and two very small unruptured aneurysms of the left internal carotid artery. The patient was treated with calcium channel blockers and the two aneurysms were successfully treated endovascularly. On day 16 the patient developed new focal neurological symptoms (severe paraparesis) and was successfully treated with intraarterial nimodipine and angioplasty in multiple sessions.
CD009372,0,8613833,0,Ultra-early rebleeding in spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage.,"To determine the incidence of, and risk factors for, the occurrence of rebleeding between admission and early operation (ultra-early rebleeding) in patients with spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), the authors reviewed the cases of 179 patients admitted within 24 hours after their last attack of SAH. Thirty-one (17.3%) of these patients had ultra-early rebleeding despite scheduling of early operation (within 24 hours after admission). The incidence of rebleeding significantly decreased as the time interval between the last attack and admission increased. Patients with rebleeding before admission, high systolic blood pressure, intracerebral or intraventricular hematoma, those in poor neurological condition on admission, and those who underwent angiography within 6 hours of the last SAH were significantly more likely to have ultra-early rebleeding than those without these factors. The incidence of rebleeding also significantly increased as levels of enhancement of platelet sensitivity and thrombin-antithrombin complex increased. Multivariate analysis revealed that the following three factors were independently associated with ultra-early rebleeding: the level of enhancement of platelet sensitivity; the time interval between the last attack and admission; and the level of thrombin-antithrombin complex. On the basis of these findings, the authors suggest that many of the risk factors for ultra-early rebleeding are interrelated. A particularly high risk of ultra-early rebleeding was observed in those patients 1) who had platelet hypoaggregability; 2) who were admitted shortly after their last SAH; and 3) whose thrombin-antithrombin complex levels were extremely high and were thus in severe clinical condition."
CD009372,0,2336144,0,[Transbrachial artery approach for selective cerebral angiography].,"Transaxillary or transbrachial approaches to the cerebral vessels have been reported, but selective angiography of all four vessels has not been possible through one route. In this report, a new technique for selective cerebral angiography with transbrachial approach is described. One hundred and twenty three patients with cerebral infarction, vertebrobasilar insufficiency, intracerebral hemorrhage, epilepsy, or cerebral tumor were examined. Those patients consisted of 85 outpatients and 38 inpatients whose age ranged from 15 years old to 82 years old. The patients were examined via the transbrachial approach (97 cases via the right brachial, 29 cases via the left). Materials included a DSA system (Digital Fluorikon 5000, General Electric Co.), a 4 French tight J-curved Simmons 80-cm catheter, a 19-gauge extra-thin-wall Seldinger needle, and a J/Straight floppy 125-cm guidewire. Generally, the volume of the contrast agent (300 mgI/ml iopamidol) used in the common carotid artery angiogram was 6 ml, while that used in the vertebral artery angiogram was 4ml. If catheterization of the vertebral artery or right common carotid artery was unsuccessful, about 8ml of the contrast agent was injected into the subclavian or brachiocephalic artery. Definitive diagnosis and a decision on proper treatment of the patients can be easily obtained, and the results were clinically satisfactory. Moreover, no complications were encountered in this study. This new technique making a transbrachial approach to the cerebral vessels using the DSA system is introduced here. Neurosurgeons can use this technique easily, and they will find that it provides them with all the information they need about the patient."

The measurements of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) by the 133Xe intraarterial injection method was carried out in 40 patients. The evolution of the aphasic syndrome was analyzed according to Hirano's classification and the patients were divided into two groups: those having a favorable recovery from aphasia; those with a poor recovery. Twelve out of 20 patients with cerebral hemorrhage showed a favorable recovery from aphasia, whose left hemispheric mean blood flow (mCBF) was 33.1 +/- 9.7 ml/100 g/min. The mCBF was 30.8 +/- 10.3 ml/100 g/min in 8 patients with a poor recovery. There was no significant difference in mCBF values between the two groups. The favorable recovery group showed slightly higher regional values in the left frontal and temporal lobes than did the poor recovery group, but no significant difference was found between the two group. Here, rCBF values failed to correlate between the two kinds of recovery from aphasia in patients with cerebral hemorrhage. The marked variability in rCBF values in the acute stage might partly account for the poor correlation in cerebral hemorrhage. In contrast, a series of rCBF studies demonstrated that rCBF values stabilized in the acute and subacute stage in cerebral thrombosis. Nine out of 20 patients with cerebral thrombosis had a favorable recovery from aphasia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

CD009372,0,10081777,0,[Imaging of cerebrovascular disease in sickle cell anemia].,"Cerebral vascular disease is a common and serious complication of sickle cell disease that mainly involves the large blood vessels of the skull base. Because recurrences are common and residual deficits severe, attention has turned to detection of preclinical cerebral involvement with the goal of preventing clinical damage. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), an extremely sensitive tool for detecting cerebral infarction/ischemia, has shown that 10% of asymptomatic patients exhibit white matter lesions that seem to be associated with impaired cognitive function and may be predictive of stroke; magnetic resonance angiography demonstrates occlusions of skull base arteries but is not reliable for the diagnosis of stenosis because of artifacts generated by rapid turbulent flow. Transcranial Doppler is sensitive and specific for the detection of arterial stenosis and occlusion, even in asymptomatic patients. Digitized cerebral angiography remains the gold standard investigation for pretreatment confirmation of lesions detected by Doppler and/or MRI."
CD009372,0,7584251,0,Intracranial aneurysms.,"MR angiography provides a rapid, accurate, and extremely flexible noninvasive evaluation of intracranial aneurysms without the cost and risk of conventional angiography. TOF and phase contrast techniques each have specific advantages and disadvantages that can be selectively exploited to optimize aneurysm evaluation. Present indications for MR angiography in aneurysm evaluation include: (1) the presence of incidental findings on a CT or MR examination that suggest the possibility of aneurysm (Figs. 7 and 8), (2) when angiography is contraindicated or when the risk is too high, (3) non-invasive follow-up of patients with known aneurysms, (4) patient refusal of contrast angiography, and (5) evaluation of patients with specific clinical symptoms (i.e., third cranial nerve palsy) or patients with non-specific subacute symptoms in whom an aneurysm might explain the clinical presentation. Although MR angiography certainly can detect aneurysms with a high rate of sensitivity and specificity, detailed decision analyses generally have not supported the overall benefit of this type of screening. Future technical advances as well as advances in the overall understanding of aneurysms may one day prove unequivocally the benefit of MR angiography in screening high-risk patient groups. MR angiography has not yet been clinically evaluated as a tool in the evaluation of acute subarachnoid hemorrhage. Potential obstacles to such an evaluation include the clinical instability of SAH patients, limited spatial resolution of the MR angiography acquisitions, the potential for subarachnoid blood or focal intraparenchymal hematomas to obscure or mimic small aneurysms, and the unreliability of MR angiography in demonstrating vasospasm. Currently these factors continue to provide an integral role for contrast angiography in aneurysm evaluation."

CD009372,0,17709084,0,A practical approach to CT angiography of the neck and brain.,"Computed tomography angiography (CTA) is a rapidly developing technology with great potential. This is particularly true for evaluating neurovascular disease. Clinical stroke because of atherosclerotic disease of the carotid and vertebral arteries is a common examination indication; areas of stenosis, and soft and calcified plaque along the entire vessel, not only at the carotid bifurcation, permit a full assessment of the patient's disease process. Other diseases including dissection, trauma, intracranial stenosis, thrombosis, and aneurysms can be readily diagnosed. Although duplex ultrasound may be a first line examination in many patients, both magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and CTA offer distinct advantages over it. CTA and MRA are both highly accurate but CTA has several key advantages. CTA has been advanced by the development of improved multidetector CT (MDCT) and workstations that postprocess the data. Methods to obtain quality CTA images and to rapidly analyze the data for abnormalities are the subject of this chapter. In addition, evolving techniques in future CT scanners and workstations, and developing methods of vulnerable plaque and CT perfusion imaging are discussed."

However, 18 days after taking human placenta extract, she had three episodes of thunderclap headache. Repeated cranial CT did not show subarachnoid hemorrhage; CSF examination showed neither xanthochromia nor inflammation. Brain diffusion weighted and FLAIR images were normal. However, magnetic resonance angiography showed multifocal segmental stenosis of the right middle cerebral artery and bilateral anterior cerebral arteries. Follow-up angiography, which performed 12 days after the oncet of thunderclap headache, revealed almost normalized flow in all cerebral arteries; we made a diagnosis of RCVS.

Cerebral angiography had demonstrated occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery and steroid therapy had been started. Attempted tapering of the steroid therapy on admission for rehabilitation resulted in the patient having severe headaches and confusion. Blink reflex evaluation, somatosensory cerebral evoked potential determinations and visual evoked responses were all consistent with a widespread process involving the parietal lobe of the patient's left cerebral hemisphere. Computerized axial tomography indicated an abnormality consistent with a space-occupying lesion. Craniotomy revealed the presence of a glioblastoma multiforme in the left cerebral hemisphere. Electrodiagnostic evaluation was entirely consistent with the operative finding of widespread involvement of the patient's left parietal lobe. Stroke patients whose conditions deteriorate over time must be serially evaluated in order to determine possible other causes of their symptoms."
CD009372,0,2024274,0,Angiographic vasospasm and release of platelet thromboxane after subarachnoid hemorrhage.,"We studied adenosine diphosphate-induced platelet aggregation and the associated release of thromboxane B2 in 49 patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage in relation to angiographic vasospasm. Postoperative cerebral angiography was performed less than or equal to 3 (median 1) days after surgery for an aneurysm 5-14 days after subarachnoid hemorrhage. Correspondingly, one sample from each patient was taken within 24 hours either before or after angiography. The occurrence of severe as well as diffuse, moderate, or severe angiographic vasospasm was associated with the presence of delayed cerebral ischemia (p less than 0.05). Patients with diffuse angiographic vasospasm had significantly higher (p less than 0.05) values for thromboxane B2 release than the others, even after adjustment by the clinical grades on admission and before surgery, the timing of surgery, the time from subarachnoid hemorrhage to angiography and blood sampling, and nimodipine therapy. Severe and diffuse angiographic vasospasm were also associated with poor outcome at 1 year (p less than 0.05). Our results suggest that augmented release of platelet thromboxane may be involved in the pathogenesis of vasospasm in large cerebral arteries."

The cesarean section was performed because pregnancy induced hypertension (PIH) had worsened. The next day, she suddenly became drowsy and developed right hemiparesis and anisocoria. Computed tomography of the brain showed intracerebral hemorrhage in the parietal lobe with uncal herniation. She underwent an urgent craniotomy and removal of the hematoma. Five days later, magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the brain showed vasospasm of the bilateral intracranial internal carotid arteries, middle cerebral arteries, and anterior cerebral arteries. Thirteen days later, cerebral angiography showed cessation of vasospasm and vascular abnormalities such as moyamoya disease, arteriovenous malformation and cerebral aneurysm were not observed. Twenty-one days later, MRA showed the absence of vasospasm in those arteries, but her right hemiparesis and sensory aphasia persisted. Twenty-six days later, she was transferred to another hospital for further rehabilitation. Neurosurgeons should be aware of the possibility of intracerebral hemorrhage caused by PIH.

CD009372,0,19472612,0,Intracranial CT angiography obtained from a cerebral CT perfusion examination.,"CT perfusion (CTP) examinations of the brain are performed increasingly for the evaluation of cerebral blood flow in patients with stroke and vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage. Of the same patient often also a CT angiography (CTA) examination is performed. This study investigates the possibility to obtain CTA images from the CTP examination, thereby possibly obviating the CTA examination. This would save the patient exposure to radiation, contrast, and time. Each CTP frame is a CTA image with a varying amount of contrast enhancement and with high noise. To improve the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) we combined all 3D images into one 3D image after registration to correct for patient motion between time frames. Image combination consists of weighted averaging in which the weighting factor of each frame is proportional to the arterial contrast. It can be shown that the arterial CNR is maximized in this procedure. An additional advantage of the use of the time series of CTP images is that automatic differentiation between arteries and veins is possible. This feature was used to mask veins in the resulting 3D images to enhance visibility of arteries in maximum intensity projection (MIP) images. With a Philips Brilliance 64 CT scanner (64 x 0.625 mm) CTP examinations of eight patients were performed on 80 mm of brain using the toggling table technique. The CTP examination consisted of a time series of 15 3D images (2 x 64 x 0.625 mm; 80 kV; 150 mAs each) with an interval of 4 s. The authors measured the CNR in images obtained with weighted averaging, images obtained with plain averaging, and images with maximal arterial enhancement. The authors also compared CNR and quality of the images with that of regular CTA examinations and examined the effectiveness of automatic vein masking in MIP images. The CNR of the weighted averaged images is, on the average, 1.73 times the CNR of an image at maximal arterial enhancement in the CTP series, where the use of plain averaging increases the CNR only with a factor of 1.49. The quality of the weighted averaged images approaches that of CTA images, although in the present study the image quality of CTA was not quite reached. The automatic masking of veins is effective and only small remnants of veins were sometimes present in the masked images. Weighted averaging makes it possible to create CTA images from a CTP examination with a CNR considerably higher than that of images with maximal arterial enhancement. The quality of the resulting images approaches that of CTA images and offers the additional advantages to automatically differentiate between arteries and veins."

These malformations derive their arterial supply primarily from meningeal vessels, and the venous drainage is either via dural venous sinuses or through the cortical veins. DAVFs have a reported association with dural sinus thrombosis, venous hypertension, previous craniotomy, and trauma, though many lesions are idiopathic. The diagnosis is dependent on a high level of clinical suspicion and high-resolution imaging. Cross-sectional imaging techniques by using CT and MR imaging aid in the diagnosis, but conventional angiography remains the most accurate method for complete characterization and classification of DAVFs. The pattern of venous drainage observed on dynamic vascular imaging determines the type of DAVF and correlates with the severity of symptoms and the risk of hemorrhage."

The prognosis of patients with early reruptured aneurysms is discouraging. A rerupture of an aneurysm with active bleeding is extremely rare, and the mechanisms involved remain unclear. We report the management of active bleeding of reruptured aneurysms during diagnostic angiography. In two patients, emergency treatment of the active hemorrhage was performed by means of neurosurgical intervention and by an endovascular approach in one other case. The causes and management of reruptured aneurysms with active bleeding are also discussed within the context of a review of the literature."
CD009372,0,1489676,0,Magnetic resonance evaluation of stroke.,"Stroke is not a specific disease but is, instead, a symptom complex reflecting destruction of brain tissue by cerebrovascular disease. Several different specific diseases are included in the ""stroke"" category, including intra- and extracerebral hemorrhage as well as ischemic infarction. These different types of stroke have major differences regarding etiology, management, and prognosis. The goal of stroke imaging is to diagnose the type of stroke at clinical presentation, allowing prompt and appropriate management. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) provide powerful noninvasive means to evaluate the pathologic and metabolic changes that occur in acute stroke. These techniques allow the early detection of stroke and greatly increase the ability to determine the etiology of the stroke. One or more of these methods will surely become a standard means of evaluating acute stroke. The information provided, combined with new stroke therapies, should result in improved patient outcome."

Three patients either had no proteinuria or edema and therefore did not meet all accepted clinical criteria for the diagnosis of eclampsia. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain in all patients demonstrated high-signal foci most prominent in the parieto-occipital regions and the subcortical white matter. Cerebral angiogram in 2 patients revealed diffuse vasospasm. In 3 patients, MRI abnormalities resolved. MRI and angiographic abnormalities in our patients are identical to those of patients meeting accepted criteria for eclampsia. Our experience suggests that the current criteria for the diagnosis of eclampsia are too stringent, both in terms of clinical picture and days postpartum to cerebral manifestations."

A 77-year-old male with a medical history of prostate cancer was admitted to our hospital presenting with progressive left hemiparesis. Previous head CT scan and MRI findings during 3 weeks before admission revealed a subcortical acute to subacute hematoma under the right precentral gyrus with growing perifocal brainedema. The Head DSA showed tumor-stain with vascular compression corresponding to the hemorrhagic mass, and Tl-201 SPECT study revealed high L/N ratio (3.0) and high L/E ratio (0.8). The preoperative diagnosis was metastatic brain tumor originating from prostate cancer, and total removal of the mass was undergone with the postoperative diagnosis of EIH. Neither tumoral component nor vascular malformation was found even by detailed pathological study. EIH is a rare variant of intracranial hemorrhage and most of cases in past reports are preoperatively misdiagnosed as malignant brain tumor. In our case, even Tl-201 SPECT and DSA, which are reported as key studies for distinguishing EIH from other brain tumors, demonstrated brain tumor-like findings. It is necessary to consider the possibility of EIH when we encounter hemorrhagic mass in the brain parenchyma even with brain tumor-like radiographical images."

Eight of these patients had basal ganglia and/or capsular infarcts without cortical involvement. The outcome in the idiopathic group was favorable: after an average follow-up duration of 48 months, no child had recurrence, two children developed secondary epilepsy, and only two were severely mentally retarded. However, residual dystonia and dyskinesia constituted an incapacitating handicap, having been observed in 14 children of the idiopathic group and in 18 of the whole series.

CD009372,0,9535306,0,Stroke and fibromuscular dysplasia: confirmation by renal magnetic resonance angiography.,"Childhood stroke is uncommon and may require extensive evaluation to elucidate an underlying cause. A 9-year-old boy had clinical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features of an ischemic event in the left middle cerebral artery territory. Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) revealed beading of the left middle cerebral artery, consistent with irregular blood flow secondary to turbulence or luminal narrowing. Conventional angiography of the cerebral vessels confirmed the findings of cerebral MRA and raised further the suspicion of fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD). MRA of the renal vessels was subsequently performed, revealing beading of the left renal artery and confirming the diagnosis of FMD. MRA, a rapid and less invasive technique associated with far less morbidity and mortality as compared with conventional angiography, may prove to be as sensitive as conventional angiography in detecting the changes of FMD. MRA of the renal arteries should be performed with initial cranial MRI and MRA in children who present with cerebral infarction of possible vascular origin. This may obviate the need to perform further investigations and may make early diagnosis possible at the first MRI scan and under a single general anesthetic."

We carried out MRI within 6 h of symptom onset on five patients with minor (low Hunt and Hess grades 1 or 2) subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) diagnosed by CT to search for any specific pattern. We used our standard stroke MRI protocol, including multiecho proton density (PD)- and T2-weighted images, echoplanar (EPI) diffusion- (DWI) and perfusion- (PWI) weighted imaging, and MRA. In all cases SAH was clearly visible on PD-weighted images with a short TE. In four patients it caused a low-signal rim on the T2*-weighted source images of PWI, and DWI revealed high signal in SAH. In the fifth patient SAH was perimesencephalic; susceptibility effects from the skull base made it impossible to detect SAH on EPI DWI and T2*-weighted images. Perfusion maps were normal in all cases. MRA and conventional angiography revealed an aneurysm in only one patient. Stroke MRI within 6 h of SAH thus shows a characteristic pattern."

Twenty-three patients had native valve infectious endocarditis and 7 had prosthetic valve endocarditis. The clinical features were characterized by the frequency of aortic valve involvement (23 out of 30) and other complications, especially cardiac failure (16 cases) and peripheral vascular manifestations (7 cases). The commonest organism was the staphylococcus (53% of identified organisms) but the number of negative blood cultures was high (50% of cases). The neurological complication was often the presenting symptom of the endocarditis (19 cases) but it occurred after bacteriological cure in 4 cases. The complications observed were cerebral ischemia (16 cases), cerebral haemorrhage (11 cases), coma (2 cases), and one peripheral neuropathy causing a Claude Bernard Horner syndrome. These complications presented with hemiplegia in 17 cases, a meningeal syndrome in 8 cases, a convulsion in 1 case, a Von Wallenberg syndrome in 1 case, and a Claude Bernard Horner syndrome in 1 case. Twelve patients had a transient or permanent neurological coma. Cerebral CT scan showed ischemic lesions in 7 cases and haemorrhagic lesions in 10 cases. Carotid angiography demonstrated mycotic aneurysms in 6 patients. Twelve patients died: the cause of death was neurological coma (7 cases), low cardiac output (4 cases) and haemorrhagic shock (1 case). Four patients underwent neurosurgery: 3 for clipping a mycotic aneurysm and 1 for drainage of an intracerebral haematoma. Poor prognostic factors were: coma, cardiac failure, cardiac valve prosthesis and, above all, the extent and multiplicity of the neurological lesions. The authors propose the following measures to improve the prognosis: early surgery in cases of large and/or mobile vegetations especially when the infecting organism is a staphylococcus and when a systemic embolism has occurred; routine CT scanning and/or digitised cerebral angiography in all patients with infective endocarditis to detect surgically accessible mycotic aneurysms."

The patient responded well to corticosteroid therapy and there was later angiographic evidence of healing. After systemic angiitis and central nervous system infection were excluded, the diagnosis of isolated benign cerebral vasculitis was made. According to past reports, at least 13 patients have been described as having isolated benign cerebral vasculitis. The common features of isolated benign cerebral vasculitis are as follows: 1) benign evolution, 2) sensitiveness to corticosteroids, 3) absence or minimal change of CSF findings, 4) angiographic pattern of arteritis, 5) the most common symptom is headache.

CD009372,0,16944161,0,High spatial resolution contrast-enhanced MR angiography of the supraaortic arteries using the quadrature body coil at 3.0T: a feasibility study.,"To examine whether the the increased signal-to-noise (S/N) available at 3.0T would permit the use of the quadrature body coil for high spatial resolution contrast-enhanced (CE) MR angiography (MRA), and whether the large FOV that was used in our routine 1.5T protocol would also be feasible at 3.0T. In a prospective study, 43 patients and five volunteers were examined on a clinical whole-body 3.0T MR unit (Intera, Philips Medical Systems, Best, The Netherlands) after institutional review board approval and informed consent. Three-dimensional CE MRA (T1 gradient echo-sequence with TR/TE = 5.7/1.93 msec.; acquisition time, 1:54 min.) using randomly segmented central k-space ordering (CENTRA) was acquired with the quadrature body coil, using over a FOV of 350 mm. A high-image matrix of 432x432 yielded a non-zero filled voxel size of 0.81 mm x 0.81 mm x 1.0 mm (0.66 mm(3)). For quantitative analysis, contrast ratios (CR) between vessels (S) and signal in surrounding tissue (ST) were calculated [(S-ST)/(S+ST)]. For qualitative analysis, image quality and presence of artifacts were rated by two radiologists in consensus on a five-point scale (1=excellent to 5=nondiagnostic). Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) served as the standard of reference in patients with vascular disease. In the five volunteers, 1.5T CE MRA using a phased array neurovascular coil was available for intraindividual comparison. 3.0T CE MRA was successfully performed in 48/48 subjects (100%). Mean CR+/- SD were 0.76 (139.30/182.42) and 0.87 (235.18/270.14) at 3.0T and 1.5T respectively . Mean image quality was 3.82+/-0.86. Intraindividual comparison between 1.5T and 3.0T CE MRA in the volunteers revealed no significant difference in image quality (4.2+/-0.74 vs 4.6+/-0.80; p>0.05). Vascular disease was correctly identified in 13/13 patients with DSA correlation. CE MRA of the supraaortic arteries is feasible at 3.0T using a large FOV of 350 mm. The signal gain at 3.0T enables high spatial resolution contrast-enhanced MR angiography by using the built-in quadrature body coil only."
CD009372,0,10399263,0,Clinical utility of magnetic resonance angiography in the evaluation of aneurysms from a neurosurgical point of view.,"The possibilities and limitations of MRA in the evaluation of intracranial aneurysms were investigated in this study. 54 patients, 30 with acute SAH were diagnosed using the three dimensional time-of-flight MRA in comparison with a conventional four vessel digital subtraction angiography prior to surgery. Furthermore, postoperative MRA was performed to assess clip placement and vessel patency and to search for innocent additional aneurysms in patients with emergency surgery due to intracerebral hemorrhage causing mass effect in whom preoperatively only the side of the lesion was investigated in DSA. 64 aneurysms in all vessel territories were detected. Three aneurysms were missed in MRA and there were three false positive results. Four baby-aneurysms were missed by both imaging modalities and were found during surgery. In all patients with CT scans suspicious of aneurysms MRA was able to detect or rule out the aneurysm. Postoperative MRA to demonstrate clip placement and vessel patency was not possible due to susceptibility artefacts. MRA should be the diagnostic procedure of first choice in CT findings suspicious of aneurysms. The follow-up of confirmed aneurysms is safely possible. MRA is very well applicable in the acute setting after SAH. The axial acquisition films and the rotatable maximum intensity projection reconstructions provide useful insights into the location of the aneurysm and its neighboring structures thus influencing the preoperative planning of surgical strategies. Keeping the limitations in mind it is a safe tool in the evaluation of aneurysms, especially with the rapidly improving postoprocessing possibilities."

Cervical arterial dissection occurs when the intimal wall of an artery is damaged as a result of trauma or defect. As blood fills the layers of the arterial wall, thrombi form, which can lead to stroke, pseudoaneurysm, vessel occlusion, and stroke. Intracranial dissections may result in subarachnoid hemorrhage. Because cervical arterial dissections may present with common signs and symptoms such as headache, neck pain, neurological deficits, and stroke, it is essential that dissection be considered early and ruled out quickly. Computed tomographic angiography, magnetic resonance angiography, and digital subtraction angiography may be used for diagnosis. Anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy is the mainstay of treatment for spontaneous or traumatic dissections and will reduce the risk of stroke. Endovascular therapy or surgery may be indicated. Recurrence or rebleeding is a significant risk and must be managed."
CD009372,0,17050521,0,State-of-the-art imaging of acute stroke.,"Stroke is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity in the developed world. The goals of an imaging evaluation for acute stroke are to establish a diagnosis as early as possible and to obtain accurate information about the intracranial vasculature and brain perfusion for guidance in selecting the appropriate therapy. A comprehensive evaluation may be performed with a combination of computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance (MR) imaging techniques. Unenhanced CT can be performed quickly, can help identify early signs of stroke, and can help rule out hemorrhage. CT angiography and CT perfusion imaging, respectively, can depict intravascular thrombi and salvageable tissue indicated by a penumbra. These examinations are easy to perform on most helical CT scanners and are increasingly used in stroke imaging protocols to decide whether intervention is necessary. While acute infarcts may be seen early on conventional MR images, diffusion-weighted MR imaging is more sensitive for detection of hyperacute ischemia. Gradient-echo MR sequences can be helpful for detecting a hemorrhage. The status of neck and intracranial vessels can be evaluated with MR angiography, and a mismatch between findings on diffusion and perfusion MR images may be used to predict the presence of a penumbra. The information obtained by combining various imaging techniques may help differentiate patients who do not need intravenous or intraarterial therapy from those who do, and may alter clinical outcomes."

Perfusion MRI demonstrated reduced capillary perfusion. Approximately 170 days after BMT the patient experienced episodes of transient left-sided weakness and speech problems. Neuroimaging revealed progression of large vessel pathology by angiography despite significant improvement in cortical perfusion (MR perfusion scan). Molecular analysis by PCR and DNA fingerprinting confirmed absence of mixed mosaicism. Rheologic evaluation showed normal corrected bulk viscosity. It is possible that progression of large vessel pathology and return of clinical symptoms in the face of normal rheologic parameters may be due to worsening of the already damaged cerebral vessels by the BMT conditioning regimen. Further evaluations of patients with SCA undergoing BMT after a stroke are needed to answer this question."

It was possible to identify the expected cause of these initial false-negative angiograms in four of those seven patients. The aneurysm was located in the anterior communicating artery (ACoA) complex in four of the seven patients. When interpreting the angiograms of patients with SAH, neurologists and neurosurgeons should bear in mind the finding that the ACoA complex is the most frequent site of ""initially occult"" aneurysms.

Among 212 stroke patients with minor neurological deficits, incomplete hemiparesis progressed to complete hemiplegia in 15 patients several days after the beginning of symptoms. On admission, 3 had internal carotid artery occlusion, 2 had stenosis of the internal carotid artery, 5 had occlusion of the middle cerebral arterial trunk, 2 had occlusion of the middle cerebral arterial branch, and 3 had no angiographically visible occlusion. The changes between the first and the second angiograms were of different varieties: another recurrent occlusion, progression of occlusion, new occlusion in the cerebral arteries opacified through the collateral pathway, recanalization of the initially occluded artery, and no change. Such different patterns of pathophysiological events show that the mechanism of neurological worsening in infarcted patients is not uniform.

CD009372,0,1857782,0,[Comparison of magnetic resonance angiography and digital angiography of the epiaortic vessels].,"Atheromasic lesions and other pathologic conditions of the arterial vessels of the neck are the most frequent causes of cerebrovascular disease. Diagnostic imaging currently employs digital subtraction angiography (DSA), Doppler, and color-Doppler US to study these conditions. Digital subtraction intraarterial angiography (DSAA) can provide both an early diagnosis and an accurate preoperative depiction of neck vessels; however, in spite of its effective value, it still remains an invasive technique. Magnetic Resonance angiography (angio-MR) is the latest technique allowing the depiction of neck vessels morphology. It shares with digital angiography the capability of supplying spatial depiction of all the examined vascular structures, and with US its noninvasiveness. The authors investigated angio-MR capabilities in providing accurate and detailed images of neck arteries; the images were then compared with DSA ones. Thirty patients with cerebrovascular diseases were studied. MR imaging was performed with a 1.5 T unit with a dedicated coil, and gradient-echo sequences were employed. Refocused sequences for flow were acquired on both the coronal and the sagittal planes, with the following parameters: TR 40, TE 10, flip angle 25 degrees, acquisition volumes 80-35 mm, 64-15 frames. Digital angiography demonstrated 101 vascular lesions: 27 slight stenoses (less than 30%), 19 mild stenoses (31-70%), 12 severe stenoses (71-99%), 7 occlusions, 14 coilings, 7 kinkings, and 15 hypoplasias of vertebral artery. In slight stenoses, angio-MR underestimated the condition in 11/27 patients. In mild and severe stenoses, as well as in occlusive diseases, angio-MR tended to overestimate the condition.

There are many imaging techniques available for the investigation of patients with ischaemic symptoms, which permit early diagnosis using non invasive methods. The newer perfusion diffusion MR techniques may play an important part in evaluation and treatment, especially in patients at risk. Most treatment currently available is symptomatic. However, interventionist neuroradiology may in future play an important part in treatment in this age group. Recent studies have shown that the prognosis is not as good as previously thought and half the patients have motor sequelas and a similar number require special schooling."
CD009372,0,7800126,0,Vascular considerations and complications in cranial base surgery.,"The technical evolution of cranial base surgery has resulted in approaches that allow more radical surgical extirpation of complex cranial base lesions. Our service has extensively applied these cranial base approaches for lesions of the cranial base. A subgroup of 100 patients who had cranial base tumors involving potential manipulation or sacrifice of carotid arteries underwent 20-minute balloon test occlusions coordinated with vascular assessments consisting of a combination of the following: 1) four-vessel cerebral angiogram with compression studies; 2) occlusion transcranial Doppler ultrasonography; 3) occlusion single-photon emission computed tomography perfusion studies; and 4) xenon-133 cerebral blood flow studies. Transient neurological deficits associated with balloon test occlusion occurred in 7 of 100 patients (7%). Subsequently, 18 patients underwent permanent carotid occlusion by endovascular detachable balloons. Delayed ischemic complications (> 72 h) occurred in 4 of 18 (22%) patients. Additionally, a number of vascular complications not predicted by the balloon occlusion tests and vascular assessments were experienced. Repeat vascular assessments defined the causes and guided treatment of ischemic patients. Ischemic complications were caused by hemodynamic insufficiency, embolization, vasospasm, radiation vasculopathy, and venous anomaly. Our experience leads us to believe that no vascular assessment exists today that can predict the occurrence of vascular complications accurately. The current enthusiasm for cranial base surgery must be tempered with the sober reality that management of cerebrovascular anatomy and physiology remain significant limitations. Consideration of potential cerebrovascular complications is paramount to successful outcome and implementation of cranial base surgery."
CD009372,0,19132425,1,Accuracy of CT angiography for the diagnosis of vascular abnormalities causing intraparenchymal hemorrhage in young patients.,"The objective of this study is to measure the accuracy of multidetector CT angiography (MD CTA) in the detection of vascular abnormalities in patients <or=40 years with spontaneous intraparenchymal hemorrhage (IPH) presenting to the emergency department. After institutional review board approval, a retrospective study was performed of 43 consecutive patients <or=40 years, who presented to our emergency department with IPH and that were evaluated with MD CTA. MD CTA images were reviewed by a neuroradiologist to determine IPH location, presence of a vascular abnormality, and associated extraparenchymal hemorrhage. Diagnostic accuracy was measured comparing it to the available reference standards, which included conventional catheter angiogram (CCA), surgical macroscopic findings, and pathology results. Medical records were reviewed for risk factors and correlation with final diagnosis. MD CTA demonstrated an accuracy of 97.7%, with a sensitivity of 96.4% (95% CI 0.79-0.99) and a specificity of 100% (95% CI 0.74-0.99) for the detection of vascular abnormalities in young patients with IPH. Additionally, MD CTA had a PPV of 100%, and the NPV 93.8% in this population. Of the 43 patients included in the study, 28 patients (65%) had a causative vascular etiology for the IPH. Among the 28 patients with vascular etiologies for the IPH, 11 had an AVM (39.2%), nine a ruptured aneurysm (32.14%), seven dural venous sinus thrombosis (25%), and one had vasculitis (3.57%). MD CTA is highly accurate in the detection of vascular abnormalities in the setting of IPH, which as a group represents the most frequent etiology of IPH among patients age <or=40 years. MD CTA performed in the Emergency Department provides accurate, rapid and critical presurgical and premedical treatment information in young patients with IPH."

Fifty patients underwent MRA of the intracranial vessels with the TOF 3D (FISP) and the TOF 2D (FISP) techniques. Five patients were affected with sinus stenosis. MRA was performed with a 1.5-T superconductive magnet and a circular head coil. All patients underwent Magnetic Resonance Angiography with FISP 2D sequences (FA 40 degrees, TR 40 ms, TE 12 ms) acquired on coronal plane as well as FISP 3D (FA 15 degrees, TR 30 ms, TE 7 ms) acquired on axial plane. In the patients in whom FISP 2D sequences correctly demonstrated the whole confluence of sinuses, FISP 3D sequences always depicted the upper sagittal sinus, while the right transverse sinus was seen in 84.4% (38/45) of cases and the left transverse sinus in 24.2% (11/45) of cases. In the patients with a stenosis in the confluence of sinuses, FISP 3D sequences demonstrated two false-positive cases with respect to FISP 2D. The statistical analysis (McNemar test) of the results demonstrated the difference between 2D and 3D sequences in the detection of the two transverse sinuses to be statistically significant: p < 0.01 for the right transverse sinus and p < 0.001 for the left transverse sinus. In the study of the intracranial vessels (TOF 3D technique) the absence of one of the two transverse sinuses is suggestive of a diagnostic pitfall; the combination of 3D and 2D sequences answers this diagnostic question."
CD009372,0,6462338,0,[Use of real-time ultrasonography in neurosurgical operations].,"The authors' experience with the application of real-time ultrasonography during 29 and after 3 neurosurgical operations is reported. Intraoperative sonography was performed in 29 cases. The neurosurgical operations include aneurysm surgery in 13 cases, removal of intracerebral hematoma in 11 cases, neoplasm surgery in 2 cases, and so on. Moreover, sonographic examination through bone defect was performed in 3 cases after decompression craniectomy. The instrument used was an ATL (Advanced Technology Laboratories, Bellevue, WA, USA) mechanical sector scanner of which scanhead contained transducers of three frequencies: 3, 5 and 7.5 MHz. The scanhead was wrapped with a sterile rubber bag after acoustic coupling gel had been applied to the head's tip. Then the scanhead was placed on the dura and ultrasonic examination was performed. The result was that the lesion was clearly identified and localized in all cases except for three cases of mild subarachnoid hemorrhage. In addition, in the two cases of needle aspiration of cyst or hematoma, the needle was easily identified and needle aspiration was performed safely and accurately. Moreover, during aneurysm surgery, aneurysm itself was detected in two cases by the real-time ultrasonic imaging. Especially, in the case with large aneurysm of the left middle cerebral artery, the findings about the aneurysmal wall, that is to say, which part is thick and which part is thin, could be obtained. Prior to the operation of aneurysm, cerebral angiogram and computerized tomographic scan are always examined thoroughly, but information about aneurysmal wall can be rarely obtained by them.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD009372,0,22473742,0,Rapid time-resolved magnetic resonance angiography via a multiecho radial trajectory and GraDeS reconstruction.,Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography is challenging due to the need for both high spatial and temporal resolution. A multishot trajectory composed of pseudo-random rotations of a single multiecho radial readout was developed. The trajectory is designed to give incoherent aliasing artifacts and a relatively uniform distribution of projections over all time scales. A field map (computed from the same data set) is used to avoid signal dropout in regions of substantial field inhomogeneity. A compressed sensing reconstruction using the GraDeS algorithm was used. Whole brain angiograms were reconstructed at 1-mm isotropic resolution and a 1.1-s frame rate (corresponding to an acceleration factor > 100). The only parameter which must be chosen is the number of iterations of the GraDeS algorithm. A larger number of iterations improves the temporal behavior at cost of decreased image signal-to-noise ratio. The resulting images provide a good depiction of the cerebral vasculature and have excellent arterial/venous separation.

We discuss possible treatment for patients with moyamoya disease accompanied with distal choroidal artery aneurysms and review the literature to summarize clinical treatment and mechanisms. The cases of three male patients who suffered from intraventricular hemorrhage are presented. Computed tomography (CT) and digital subtractive angiography (DSA) revealed that bleeding was believed to be caused by ruptured aneurysms originating from distal choroidal artery aneurysms. Two patients successfully underwent superficial temporal artery (STA)-middle cerebral artery (MCA) bypass combined with encephalo-duro-myo-synangiosis (EDMS) and the obliteration of the aneurysm. The follow-up DSA or CT scan demonstrated that the aneurysms completely disappeared with the patency of the reconstructed artery. Neither of the patients experienced rebleeding during the follow-up period (up to 34 months). Given conservative treatment, the third patient experienced recurrent hemorrhages 4 months after the first ictus. This study describes treatment for moyamoya disease accompanied with distal choroidal artery aneurysms. Our experience suggests that cerebral revascularization combined with obliteration of the complicated distal aneurysm in the same session is a possible treatment."

Although ischemic stroke and subarachnoid hemorrhage have been reported in association with Lyme disease, intraparenchymal brain hemorrhage has not been previously described in the course of this disease. The patient is a 48-year old male with a progressive spastic paraparesis of months' duration who presented acute headache, confusion, severe left hemiparesis with sensory deficit and homonymous hemianopsia. A cranial computed tomography scan showed an extensive right temporal lobe hemorrhage with subarachnoid invasion. Brain angiographic and angio-magnetic resonance imaging studies excluded hemorrhage-predisposing vascular abnormalities. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies disclosed mononuclear pleocytosis with elevated protein levels. Both serum and CSF anti-Borrelia titers were significantly increased, and serum Western Blot showed bands to protein 34 (ops B), 57, 59 and 62. The patient was treated with ceftriaxone for 4 weeks, with a favorable outcome.

Thus, the purpose of the study was to evaluate the feasibility of a comprehensive 60-min MR-based screening examination in healthy volunteers and a limited number of patients with known target disease. In ten healthy volunteers (7 men, 3 women; mean age, 32.4 years) and five patients (4 men, 1 woman; mean age, 56.2 years) with proven target disease we evaluated the performance of a comprehensive MR screening strategy by combining well-established organ-based MR examination components encompassing the brain, the arterial system, the heart, the lungs, and the colon. All ten volunteers and five patients tolerated the comprehensive MR examination well. The mean in-room time was 63 min. In one volunteer, insufficient colonic cleansing on the part of the volunteer diminished the diagnostic reliability of MR colonography. All remaining components of the comprehensive MR examination were considered diagnostic in all volunteers and patients. In the five patients, the examination revealed the known pathologies [aneurysm of the anterior communicating artery ( n=1), renal artery stenosis ( n=1), myocardial infarct ( n=1), and colonic polyp ( n=2)]. The outlined MR screening strategy encompassing the brain, the arterial system, the heart, the lung, and the colon is feasible.

CD009372,0,11452501,0,[A case of aneurysm of the peripheral middle cerebral artery undetectable on preoperative angiogram].,"The authors describe a rare case of an aneurysm of the peripheral middle cerebral artery. A 63-year-old female with a past history of hypertension suddenly fell into a comatose state, and was brought to our hospital. On admission, CT scan showed intracerebral hematoma located in the right putamen with diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage. To exclude vascular lesions, an angiography was performed just after admission. The right carotid angiogram showed an aneurysm at the cavernous portion of the internal carotid artery (ICA), but failed to show any aneurysms in the rest of the intracranial circulation. Just after the angiography, emergent operation was performed for the main purpose of evacuation of the hematoma, and with only the secondary purpose of searching for undetectable aneurysms. The patient underwent a right frontotemporal craniotomy. After partial evacuation of the hematoma through the corticotomy of the right frontal operculum, the Sylvian fissure was opened widely. No aneurysm was observed either in the main trunk of the right ICA or the middle cerebral artery (MCA). During the final stage of evacuation of the hematoma through the corticotomy, arterial bleeding occurred. While evacuating the blood, we detected a saccular aneurysm arising from MCA branch (M2-M3 junction) and we clipped the aneurysm. We discuss peripheral MCA aneurysms with a review of the literature."

All patients underwent panangiography for definitive diagnosis. The dAVF were supplied by the external carotid artery system alone (14 patients), both external and internal carotid systems (10 patients) or both anterior and posterior circulation (6 patients). Depending on the venous drainage the fistulas were classified following a modification of Djindjian's description with 18 patients revealing Type I (main sinus with antegrade flow), 5 Type II a (main sinus with reflux into the contralateral sinus). 5 Type II b (cortical veins), 1 Type II a+b (both) and 1 of Type III (direct cortical drainage). Bruit, pulsatile tinnitus and headaches were the most common symptoms. 6 patients presented with intracranial haemorrhage, 4 with progressive neurological deficit or seizures and 3 with dementia. Arterial embolization was performed in all cases except one, where a transvenous approach for balloon occlusion of the transverse sinus was performed. 21 patients were treated by single or repeated embolization alone. Only in 9/21 cases did arterial embolization result in complete occlusion of the fistula. In 12/21 patients incomplete occlusion was achieved. Following embolization 8 patients underwent additional surgery including coagulation of the feeding arteries and arterialized veins, sinus resection and reconstruction of the sinus. Overall, 18 patients were cured, 11 improved and 1 patient was unchanged. There was a total number of 5 complications including transient stroke, transient facial nerve palsy, and a small necrotic skin area following embolization. Venous infarction of the occipital lobe was induced by transvenous occlusion and surgical resection of the transverse sinus in one patient each, respectively. From our results we conclude that the endovascular therapy alone is the treatment of choice in case of Type I fistulas. In dAVF of Type II and III repeated endovascular treatment seems not to be sufficient and additional surgery is necessary."

This article emphasizes new observations on transient focal neurological episodes in the context of cerebral amyloid angiopathy, a common but under-recognized small vessel disease most often encountered as a cause of symptomatic lobar intracerebral hemorrhage. Transient focal neurological episodes in cerebral amyloid angiopathy are of clinical and pathophysiological interest because they can mimic transient ischemic attacks, but are probably more often related to bleeding (especially superficial cortical siderosis or focal convexity sub-arachnoid hemorrhage) rather than ischemia. Importantly, such episodes may also herald a very high future risk of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage. The article highlights scenarios encountered in clinical practice and discusses implications for patient care including: (a) the value of blood-sensitive magnetic resonance imaging sequences in investigating transient focal neurological episodes; and (b) treatment implications, as giving antiplatelet or anticoagulant drugs for these episodes could increase the risk of serious intracerebral hemorrhage."

HIE is still the major recognized perinatal cause of neurological morbidity in full-term newborns. MRI offers today the highest sensitivity in detecting acute anoxic injury of the neonatal brain. Conventional acquisition techniques together with modern diffusion techniques can identify typical patterns of HIE injury, even in the early course of the disease. However, even though highly suggestive, these patterns cannot be considered as pathognomonic. Perinatal metabolic disease such as kernicterus and severe hypoglycaemia should be differentiated from classic HIE. Other conditions, such as infections, non-accidental injury and rarer metabolic diseases can be misinterpreted as HIE in their early course when diffuse brain swelling is still the predominant MRI feature. Diffusion techniques can help to differentiate different types of diffuse brain oedema. Typical examples of focal injuries are arterial or venous infarctions. In arterial infarction, diffusion techniques can define more precisely than conventional imaging the extent of focal infarction, even in the hyperacute phase. Moreover, diffusion techniques provide quantitative data of acute corticospinal tract injury, especially at the level of the cerebral peduncles. Venous infarction should be suspected in every case of unexplained cerebral haematoma in the full-term newborn. In the presence of spontaneous bleeding, venous structures should always be evaluated by MR angiography."

Evaluation included computed tomographic brain scan, arteriography, echocardiography, and blood tests. A probable migrainous infarction was diagnosed in six patients (10%) (all women with a history of migraine) who survived the initial stroke and were followed-up for an average of four years. In five patients the stroke occurred during a common migraine attack and in one patient during a classic migraine attack. The site of infarction was invariably the occipital lobe. During the follow-up, no subject had a further stroke. All six women had a permanent hemianopic deficit."

In general, the current practice is to treat these patients conservatively and repeat studies to rule out a treatable cause 6 weeks to 3 months later; more often than not these repeated studies fail to reveal any findings, and the patient is treated conservatively. For years, the senior author (R.C.H.) has treated these patients with early surgical exploration. This study was undertaken prospectively to ascertain the frequency of positive findings during surgical exploration."
CD009372,0,17720199,0,Spontaneous obliteration of MRI-silent cerebral angiomatosis revealed by CT angiography in a patient with Sturge-Weber syndrome.,"Type I Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS) is a neurocutaneous syndrome characterized by facial port wine stain and ipsilateral leptomeningeal angiomatosis. It is commonly complicated by glaucoma and neurological disturbances including seizures, hemiparesis, transient stroke-like deficits, and behavioral problems. Gadolinium-enhanced MRI is the study of choice for demonstrating the leptomeningeal angiomatosis, and is particularly useful for making the diagnosis. Cerebral hematoma and spontaneous obliteration of cerebral angiomatosis have never been reported in SWS. We describe a patient with type I SWS in which a hemorrhage in the left temporal lobe was caused by an underlying angiomatosis. No arteriovenous malformations were detected by brain CT or gadolinium-enhanced MRI, whereas a small angiomatous nidus draining into an ectasic venous collector near the hematoma was disclosed by brain CT angiography. Carotid angiography, performed 3 years after the hemorrhage, demonstrated the spontaneous obliteration of the angioma. This description expands the phenotypic spectrum of type I SWS in which the occurrence of cerebral hemorrhage and MRI-silent cerebral angiomatosis should be included, and emphasizes the need of performing a brain CT angiography in SWS patients whose routine neuroimaging studies fail to detect potentially harmful vessel malformation."
CD009372,0,8752466,0,[The current role of cerebral angiography in diagnosis of cerebrovascular disease].,"The role of cerebral angiography in diagnosis of cerebrovascular disease has changed considerably because of the increasing availability of neuroimaging (CT, MRI), especially MR angiography (MRA). MRA has almost entirely taken the place of cerebral angiography as a screening procedure in evaluation of the cervical carotid arteries and main trunks of intracranial arteries. However, detection of accurate morphological changes of arterial walls requires cerebral angiography, especially in cases of arteritis, arterial dissection and aneurysm of smaller than 3 mm in diameter. Cerebral angiography is still needed in order to obtain a more precise three dimensional concept of the vascular lesion, esp. in vascular malformations, their detailed blood supply, venous drainage and even for a mere (but definitive) diagnosis in some cases. Angiography is essential in preoperative surgical planning, for evaluation of residual AVM after surgery, etc. Technically, intraarterial stereoscopic DSA and serial cerebral angiography in stereoscopic magnification are most useful for angiographic diagnosis. Intravenous DSA has no advantage over MRA and is therefore no longer a useful diagnostic procedure. Cerebral angiography is also useful for evaluation of cerebral circulation which is most useful in conjunction with SPECT study. Although interventional neuroradiology has made a significant stride in the past, it requires further technical improvements and more skillful performance in the future."

These cases are not strictly correlated with haematologic alterations. The aetiopathogenesis remains uncertain in the most of patients, in which predisposing causes are absent and angiographic pictures do not demonstrate anatomical lesions or occlusions of cerebral vessels. In our series, cerebral angiography was performed in 16 children and showed vascular alterations only in 6 cases.

CD009372,0,3962749,0,Unruptured intracranial aneurysms in polycystic kidney disease.,"To detect unruptured intracranial aneurysms, we performed cerebral angiography in five patients with polycystic kidney disease (PKD) who had no neurological deficits and no history of subarachnoid haemorrhage. Three of the five patients had unruptured intracranial aneurysms and two underwent surgery with no mortality or morbidity. Our review of the literature revealed that the surgical risk of unruptured intracranial aneurysms is smaller than the risk of bleeding in conservatively treated patients. We discuss the importance of an early diagnosis, and early operation for unruptured aneurysms in patients with polycystic kidney disease and stress the need for intensive care for their renal dysfunction and hypertension during and after the operation."
CD009372,0,15708227,0,Thrombosed vertebral artery aneurysm presenting with hemorrhage and bulbar compression: report of two cases.,"Bulbar compression by vertebral artery (VA) aneurysm is extremely rare and only reported in a few cases. We report two cases with thrombosed VA aneurysm compressing medulla oblongata; one presented with bulbar apoplexy hemorrhage and the other with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). A 61-year-old male (case 1) presented with consciousness disturbances, left hemiplegia, and subsequent respiratory arrest. He was subjected to controlled ventilation, and computed tomography (CT) scan showed bulbar hemorrhage. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and digital subtraction angiogram (DSA) revealed fusiform right VA aneurysm with partial thrombosis and bulbar compression. Intra-aneurysmal embolization with Guglielmi detachable coils (GDCs) relieved his clinical symptom including respiratory disturbance. Three months after the onset, he remained moderately disabled. A 76-year-old male (case 2) presented with severe headache and subsequent respiratory disturbance. CT scan on admission showed subarachnoid hemorrhage with acute hydrocephalus. Ventricular drainage rapidly improved consciousness while respiratory disturbance persisted over several days. MRI and DSA suggested spontaneous thrombosis of the right VA dissection with bulbar compression. He showed gradual recovery of his respiration over a week. After ventriculo-peritoneal shunting, he was transferred with moderate disability. These results suggest that the elimination of the pulsatile effect of VA aneurysm adjacent to medulla oblongata can improve symptoms caused by aneurysm-related compression. Early diagnosis and appropriate treatment such as intra-aneurysmal embolization for ameliorating the blood flow inside the aneurysm can relieve mass effect and clinical symptoms."
CD009372,0,1881535,0,Extended use of cranial CT in the evaluation of patients with stroke and transient ischaemic attacks.,"The hypothesis was explored that patterns of ischaemic brain damage shown by CT may be of greater value in estimating the relevance of angiographic stenosis in the carotico-vertebral arteries in some patients than presenting clinical features. Five angiographic and six CT abnormalities were defined and charted independently in a blinded manner in 312 patients whom clinical features and subsequent management were known. Charts were combined for statistical analysis. Statistically significant associations were found between two types of CT lesion and angiographic abnormalities, but these were present in only 18% of cases. The distribution of clinical features did not differ significantly within this subset compared to the whole population, from which it was concluded that the hypothesis was upheld. Furthermore significantly more patients in this subset were subjected to carotid endarterectomy, suggesting that management decisions may have been modulated by CT findings in some patients."

We performed a blinded review of 68 acute and subacute hematomas caused by neoplasms (22), hypertension or presumed amyloid angiopathy (27), or vascular malformations (19). The extent of vasogenic edema was quantified on an axial T2-weighted image using the VE ratio: the maximum width of high signal surrounding a hematoma and the mean diameter of the hematoma. Hematomas caused by neoplasm were associated with more vasogenic edema (mean VE ratio 104%+/-15%; mean VE width 2.4+/-0.7 cm) than non-neoplastic hematomas (mean VE ratio 37%+/-5%; P =0.001). When the width of VE was equal to or more half the diameter the hematoma (VE ratio 50%), the positive predictive value for tumor was 66%; when it was equal to or more than the diameter, the positive predictive value was 71%. All six hematomas with VE ratios > or = 150% were caused by neoplasm."

The diagnostic effectiveness of different radiological techniques was compared. In cranial trauma without loss of consciousness no examination should be carried out. Skull films are of little use and may give a false safety, if no fracture is evident. Particular attention is paid to the importance of computed axial tomography in the diagnosis of various pathological conditions. It is revealed that a high agreement between the radiological results and the final clinical diagnosis in the patients with head injuries should be obtained only in the way based on a good cooperation between the radiologist and clinicians."
CD009372,0,8985069,0,Sestamibi parathyroid scanning and preoperative localization studies for patients with recurrent/persistent hyperparathyroidism or significant comorbid conditions: development of an optimal localization strategy.,"For patients with previous thyroid or parathyroid surgery and for those with significant comorbid conditions, noninvasive and invasive modalities exist for the preoperative localization of pathologic parathyroid tissue. Formal localization at our institution involves obtaining two studies that are independently positive for the same location. The studies utilized have included ultrasound, CT scans, MRI, technetium-99m/thallium-201 (Tc-Tl) imaging, and more recently, (99m)Tc-sestamibi (20-25 mCi) (MIBI) scans. These were followed by arteriography and/or venous sampling if necessary. From January 1992 through October 1995, 25 patients underwent preoperative parathyroid localization (10 reoperation, 3 grave hypercalcemia, 2 concurrent goiter, 2 cerebral vascular accident, 1 bleeding disorder, and 1 malignant ventricular arrhythmia) and were evaluated prospectively during the changeover from Tc-Tl to MIBI scanning at our institution. A total of 92 studies were obtained. All 25 patients were operated on by a single surgeon, and in each case the parathyroid adenoma was successfully resected with minimal morbidity (1 permanent hypoparathyroid and 1 temporary recurrent laryngeal nerve injury). True positives interpreted preoperatively: MIBI, 14 of 19 (74%); CT scan, 13 of 19 (68%); Tc-Tl, 4 of 8 (50%), ultrasound, 9 of 20 (45%); MRI, 8 of 14 (57%); arteriography, 3 of 7 (43%); venous sampling, 3 of 4 (75%); and positron emission tomography, 0 of 1. There were no false-positive MIBI scans. These results suggest that when formal parathyroid localization is needed in reoperative/complicated patients, 1) MIBI appears to be the most sensitive and specific study, and 2) the MIBI scan should be the initial study in any situation in which preoperative localization is needed. Ultrasound can be useful for patients with significant comorbidities who have not been previously explored. CT or MRI should then be used if further evaluation is needed. If the use of these noninvasive modalities does not produce positive gland localization, selective venous sampling should be utilized as the definitive procedure."

In total, 25 patients were included in the study (average age 53.2 years, range 25-75 years, 14 male, 11 female), all with intracranial bleeding on unenhanced brain CT and who underwent additional CTA performed on a dual-source CT in a dual-energy acquisition mode. The two X-ray tubes were operated at 140 and 80 kV, respectively. Data were analyzed using dual-energy evaluation software. Virtual unenhanced images were calculated by removing the relative iodine content from each voxel. The virtual unenhanced images were evaluated by a radiologist blinded to the findings of the conventional images related to the presence of intracranial bleeding. The image quality and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) between bleeding and brain tissue were assessed. The virtual image quality was found to be sufficient in 96%. The agreement in detection of intracranial bleeding on virtual and conventional unenhanced images reached 96% in per-lesion analysis and 100% in per-patient analysis. The averaged CNR reached 2.63 in virtual unenhanced images and 3.27 in conventional. Virtual unenhanced images are sufficient for the detection of intracranial bleeding."

Multiple CT scans and cerebral angiography failed to identify any vascular or neoplastic cause for the haemorrhage, and a presumptive diagnosis of hypertensive haemorrhage was made. Shunting of hydrocephalus was followed by early clinical improvement. However, delayed progressive deterioration necessitated MRI scan, which demonstrated a mass lesion in the basal ganglia and midbrain.

While several reports describe nonsurgical management of cerebellar hematomas in adults, the spontaneous resolution of juvenile cerebellar hematomas is almost unknown. This paper describes a 16-year-old boy with a cerebellar hematoma of obscure etiology that was managed conservatively. This report indicates that nonsurgical treatment of cerebellar hematomas, once structural lesions have been excluded, may be attempted in neurologically stable children."
CD009372,0,6738800,0,[Multiple anomalies of cerebral vessels. A case of multiple aneurysms associated with fenestration of the middle cerebral artery and persistent primitive trigeminal artery].,"A case of multiple intracranial anomalies was reported. They consisted of fenestration of the middle cerebral artery (MCA), persistent primitive trigeminal artery and four intracranial aneurysms. The patient, 45-year-old male, had an attack of subarachnoid hemorrhage on July 15, 1982. He was transferred and admitted to our Dept. of Neurosurgery on July 27. On admission neurological examinations revealed retinal hemorrhage, bilateral papilledema and abducens nerve paresis on the left. Cerebral angiography demonstrated multiple aneurysms, one in the left vertebral artery, one in the left MCA, one in the right IC-PC junction and one in the fenestrated right MCA and persistent primitive trigeminal artery. Computed tomography (CT) demonstrated high density areas in the basal cistern and bilateral sylvian fissures, and cavum septi pellucidi and cavum Vergae as well. Surgical intervention was done and all aneurysms were clipped or coated successfully. The aneurysm in the fenestrated right MCA had originated from the proximal end of the fenestration of the MCA. The cavum septi pellucidi and cavum Vergae were asymptomatic. The postoperative course was uneventful. The authors discussed the pathogenesis and clinical meanings of fenestration of the MCA and persistent primitive trigeminal artery, and inferred that the genetic abnormality at the stage of development of cerebral vessels could play one part of the formation of intracranial aneurysms, because of the fact that the cerebrovascular anomalies showed high incidence of coexistence of intracranial aneurysms."

The complementary roles of referring physician and neuroradiologist.,"The number and sophistication of neuroimaging methods for identifying location, size, type, and causes of stroke or stroke-like syndromes have expanded rapidly. In acute stroke, computed tomography is used to distinguish between nonhemorrhagic and hemorrhagic infarction and to eliminate several potential alternative diagnoses. Cerebral angiography can identify surgically treatable lesions in patients experiencing transient ischemic attacks and thus aid in preventing stroke. The superb sensitivity of magnetic resonance imaging has opened new vistas in the ongoing investigation of multiinfarct dementia and small infarcts in neurologically ""noneloquent"" regions of the brain.

The type of SAH i.e., nontraumatic perimesencephalic SAH versus focal or generalized non perimesencephalic SAH, as well as the amount and distribution of blood on the initial CT examination are important factors in decision making. 3D-Angio-CT, in 3/5 patients, and MR-angiography (MRA) in 1/5 patients were complementary non-invasive methods to diagnose aneurysms on repeated examinations.

CD009372,0,9809629,0,Echo contrast-enhanced three-dimensional power Doppler of intracranial arteries.,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the potential of contrast-enhanced three-dimensional (3-D) power Doppler (CE3DPD) in the assessment of intracranial vascular structures, and to compare the results with unenhanced 3-D power Doppler (3DPD) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) findings. We insonated 25 patients without cerebrovascular diseases through the temporal bone window using 3DPD and CE3DPD; for comparison, 13 patients underwent MRA. Identification rates of vascular segments and of small branches of intracranial vessels were evaluated by two independent investigators blinded to MRA results. In 21 patients with adequate insonation conditions, CE3DPD significantly improved identification rates compared to 3DPD for the complete visualization of the P1 segment (80.9 vs. 19.0%, p < 0.005, P2 segment (80.9 vs. 42.8%, p < 0.05 and A1 segment (85.7 vs. 38.1%, p < 0.005). Furthermore, CE3DPD depicted, in significantly more examinations, branches of the middle (MCA) and posterior cerebral artery (PCA). Interobserver agreement was higher than 95% for the main intracranial segments and branches of the MCA, but relatively low (80.1-85.7%) for branches of the PCA. In comparison to CE3DPD, MRA identified only parieto-occipital branches of the PCA, temporal branches of the MCA, frontal branches of the anterior cerebral artery and the MCA bifurcation more frequently and accurately. In 4 patients with inadequate acoustic temporal bone windows, the application of a galactose-based microbubble suspension allowed clear 3-D visualization of almost all major intracranial vascular segments and some branches of the large arteries. In conclusion, CE3DPD is a more sensitive ultrasonic tool compared to unenhanced 3-D reconstructions. It makes 3-D ultrasound imaging of the basal cerebral circulation easier to perform and interpret, by providing an improved spatially oriented display of image position. As such, this method may increase operator diagnostic confidence level under pathologic conditions."
CD009372,0,3219243,0,[An autopsy case of subarachnoid and intracerebral hemorrhage and necrotizing angitis associated with methamphetamine abuse].,"We report an autopsy case of methamphetamine-related intracranial hemorrhage and vasculitis. The possible relationship between drug usage and the occurrence of intracranial bleeding and cerebral vasculitis in such patients is discussed. A 22-year-old woman died after an intravenous injection of unknown dose of methamphetamine. A computed tomography head scan demonstrated massive subarachnoid hemorrhage and hematoma in corpus callosum. Cerebral angiography revealed nonfilling of bilateral intracranial carotid arteries and extravasation of contrast medium from right pericallosal artery which was visualized retrogradely via vertebral artery. Postmortem studies showed cerebral edema, subarachnoid and intracerebral hemorrhage, and intracranial vasculitis in the absence of aneurysm, arteriovenous malformation or chronic hypertension. Histological findings of necrosis of blood vessel walls with destruction of the elastica and smooth muscle layer, and without leukocytotic infiltration of the blood vessel walls were observed in order of anterior cerebral, middle cerebral, vertebral, posterior cerebral and basilar arteries. These angiographic and histological evidence suggests that such hemorrhage results from the development of fibrinonecrosis in the large intracerebral vessels, in addition to a sudden rise in blood pressure."

CD009372,0,2645691,0,Diagnostic significance of flow separation in the carotid bulb.,"Pulsatile blood flow within the normal carotid sinus involves at least two distinct components. That near the flow divider is laminar and antegrade, whereas a boundary layer separation zone in the posterolateral aspect exhibits transient blood flow reversal. It is now possible to document these flow velocity components using pulsed Doppler ultrasound methods. When atherosclerosis develops, it preferentially involves the posterolateral bulb region, obliterating the normal configuration of the sinus with consequent loss of the flow separation zone. It was therefore hypothesized that if flow separation could be detected, it should be predictive of a normal angiogram. To assess this, we evaluated 20 symptomatic patients and two with only bruits found by duplex scanning to have flow separation in either one or both carotid bulbs and who also underwent cerebral angiography. Initial diagnoses were stroke in seven, reversible ischemic neurologic deficit in one, transient ischemic attack in 12, and bruit in two. Flow separation was bilateral in 13 patients (59%). There were 15 patients with symptoms in the territory of a carotid bulb exhibiting flow separation. By angiography, of the 35 bulbs with boundary layer separation, 27 (77%) were normal, with the remainder showing lesions that reduced the diameter of the vessel by 20% or less. Final diagnoses of the 15 patients with symptoms ipsilateral to a carotid sinus exhibiting flow separation were fibromuscular disease in two, lacunar stroke in three, dissection in two, subclavian steal in one, cardiogenic embolus in three, migraine in one, hyperventilation syndrome in one, kink of the mid-internal carotid artery in one, and no diagnosis in one.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

CD009372,0,16540331,0,Adult moyamoya disease in the asymptomatic Japanese population.,"Moyamoya disease (MMD) is a spontaneous occlusive disease of the Willis circle. This study evaluated the presence of the radiological hallmarks of adult MMD on a ""brain check-up"" (BC) using MRI and MR angiography, in Japan. BC was offered to 11,402 healthy subjects (7570 men and 3832 women) between January 1997 and November 2003. The mean age of all subjects was 53.2 years (SD 11.1); the mean age of men was 53.2 years (SD 10.9) and women 53.2 years (SD 11.5). MMD was diagnosed according to the criteria of the Research Committee on Spontaneous Occlusion of the Circle of Willis in Japan. Eight subjects (4 men and 4 women) were diagnosed as probable MMD without neurological deficits. Thus, the percentage of subjects with asymptomatic MMD on BC was 0.07% for the total group, 0.05% in men and 0.10% in women. The female to male ratio was 3.3:1. The mean age of the MMD patients was 54.0 years (SD 12.0); men 54.8 years (SD 12.8) and women 53.3 years (SD 13.9). Estimates of the prevalence of MMD in the Japanese population were calculated as 50.7 per 100,000 people; 28.9 in men and 94.3 in women. Five patients had a family history of definite MMD and seven had a family history of subarachnoid or intracerebral hemorrhage. MRI and angiography showed stenosis of the bilateral internal carotid arteries (ICA) in five patients and a unilateral ICA in three. Moyamoya vessels were confirmed on cerebral angiography. Our standard BC protocol is limited for the detection of moyamoya vessels in the initial stages of MMD. The present study suggests that the radiological features of MMD are asymptomatic in the early stages of the disease."

The three dimensional digital subtraction angiography (3D-DSA) well demonstrated anatomical structures of cerebral arteries with high special resolution. This 3D observation allowed high quality planning for aneurysmal coil packing and neck clipping. Because of the bony structure and curvy arterial anatomy in the skull base region, 3D-CTA and MRA was sometimes distureved the demonstration of the anatomical relationship adjacent to the aneurysm. However, 3D-DSA not only demonstrated arterial anatomy, but also analyzed of vascular structure, quantifiably. And it was useful in radiation dose reduction by reduction of DSA exposure number. We believe that 3D-DSA should provided useful information for planning of surgical and endovascular treatment in the field of cerebro-vascular disease."

CD009372,0,22695125,0,Cortical vessel imaging and visualization for image guided depth electrode insertion.,"To avoid intracranial hemorrhage during minimally invasive depth electrode insertion without craniotomy for epilepsy surgery, precise in vivo imaging of cortical vessel and relevant rendering methods are critical, and should be used in preoperative planning. In this study, a non-invasive phase contrast MR angiography (PC-MRA) method was chosen for cortical vessel imaging. After image pre-processing (registration and segmentation), three visualization methods were implemented to optimize the vessel imaging and brain tissue rendering for surgical planning. The processed results were evaluated by comparing with intraoperative photographs. The results showed occurrences of missing vessels between imaging and photos (18.3%, 6 cases), but these could be compensated by realistic sulci visualization methods. The results showed 3D texture mapping to be the most suitable cortex visualization method for use in surgical navigation. Based on the methods and evaluations, a new surgical planning system and criteria of usage were developed with input from the surgeons' experience using the prototype system. This system could greatly help reduce the risk of the intracranial hemorrhage during electrode insertion and also avoid potential risks caused by contrast agent injections for contrast enhanced MRA or CTA."

CD009372,0,6728143,0,Can neuropsychological tests detect the sites of cerebrovascular stenoses and occlusions?,"Conventional neuropsychological data may not mirror the site of cerebrovascular stenosis in a patient with mild to moderate symptoms. In this study, three groups of cerebral revascularization candidates failed to differ on an extended Halstead-Reitan battery: patients with symptoms and angiographic results referable to the carotid arterial system, subjects with clinical signs and neuroradiological findings referable to the vertebrobasilar arterial system, and patients with symptoms of cerebral ischemia but negative angiograms. Consistent with previous work, these patients generally were mildly impaired on neuropsychological tests, even though many were not symptomatic at the time of assessment. Neuropsychological tests seem to be sensitive to the presence and severity of cerebral ischemia, but in isolation may not be sufficient to determine the loci of vascular stenoses. The incongruence between angiographic and neuropsychological findings underlines the importance of distinguishing among different levels and types of measurements in defining subgroups of cerebral revascularization candidates. Collaboration among neuroscientists will further our understanding of the interrelationships among neurodiagnostic tests."

On the plain scan they presented as a rounded, well defined lesion with a high density in 18 cases and a density equal to or lower than brain tissue in 10 cases. The density could be related to certain histologic features as the amount of connective tissue and extracellular water and the presence of psammoma bodies or lipid storage cells. After administration of contrast a homogeneous, markedly increased, sharply marginated density was seen in most meningiomas. Contrast enhancement appeared to be dependent on the vascularity of the tumour. +/- 50% of the cases demonstrated edema grade II or III. On first interpretation 93% of the meningiomas were recognized as a lesion and a tumour (2 false negative) and 79% as a meningioma (2 false negative and 4 incorrect).

CD009372,0,11147323,0,[Magnetic resonance angiography in inflammatory brain diseases].,"In this review, we discuss the diagnostic potential of time of flight (TOF) MRA and contrast enhanced (CE) MRA in inflammatory disorders of the meninges and the brain. Cerebrovascular complications are frequently observed during infectious meningoencepalitis. 3D TOF-MRA and CE-MRA are complementary for the detection of basal intracranial artery stenosis and septic cerebral vein and sinus thrombosis due to secondary vasculitis. MRA reveals stenosis and occlusion as indirect signs of vasculitis, whereas MRI shows the inflammation of the brain and meninges and occasionally the vessel wall, together with the ischemic or hemorrhagic complication. In case of septic emboli MRA can detect peripheral occlusions and ""mycotic"" aneurysms. For the diagnosis of noninfectious vasculitides of the intracranial vessels, high resolution 3D TOF-MRA is superior to CE-MRA for the detection of multiloculated segmental stenoses. However, there are presently no prospective studies on the sensitivity and specificity of MRA for these indications. Therefore, only positive MRA results can directly influence clinical management.

CD009372,0,8204251,0,[Subdural hemorrhage of aneurysmal origin].,"Although most subdural hematomas are considered to be venous in origin, they may also be of arterial origin. When subdural bleeding is due to the rupture of an intracranial aneurysm, most commonly at the middle cerebral or internal carotid arteries, the amount of subdural blood is usually small and of no clinical importance. We describe two patients with subdural hematomas secondary to rupture of an intracranial aneurysm, who needed prompt surgical treatment. The first patient had a left internal carotid artery aneurysm at the origin of the ophthalmic artery. In the second patient the aneurysm was at the anterior communicating artery and rebled into the subdural space directly through a right intraparenchymatous frontobasal hematoma. The most probable mechanism of subdural bleeding in our two patients was the existence of adhesions between the aneurysm and the arachnoid due to previous minor hemorrhages. The indication of cerebral angiography in a patient with subdural hematoma is based mainly upon the existence of meningeal signs, the presence of blood in more than one intracranial compartment or the rapid progression of bleeding."

We evaluate the accuracy of time of flight MR angiography (TOF-MRA) to assess the arterial diameters of the circle of Willis in SAH patients with suspected CVS. MR examinations (1.5 Tesla) including 3D TOF-MRA with maximum intensity projections (MIP) and digital subtraction angiography (DSA) were performed within 24 h in 21 patients with acute aneurysmal SAH and suspicion of CVS. Arterial diameters of the circle of Willis including the distal internal carotid artery (ICA) were measured as ratios to the extradural ICA in standard projections. The diagnosis of CVS was established by comparing the luminal size of baseline and follow-up DSA. The correlation between the arterial ratios measured on MIP angiograms and on follow-up DSA was assessed with Pearson's linear regression analysis. Arterial ratios on MIP angiograms were categorized as correct, overestimated, and underestimated compared to the ratios on follow-up DSA. Pearson's correlation coefficient between the ratios of MIP angiograms and DSA was r = 0.5799 and the regression coefficient was b = 0.4775. Highest correlation was found for the category of severe CVS (r = 0.8201). Of all MIP angiograms, 34.9% showed consistent results compared to the DSA, while 44.2% of MIP images overestimated the vascular narrowing. Standard MIP angiograms from TOF-MRA are not accurate to assess vascular narrowing in patients with suspected CVS after aneurysmal SAH. The multifocal arterial stenoses in CVS may induce severe changes in blood flow dynamics, which compromise the diagnostic accuracy of the TOF-MRA."

CD009372,0,6247579,0,Clinicomorphologic markers for predicting behavior and guiding therapy for brain tumors.,"More specific therapy can be achieved for brain tumors by identifying morphologic markers like primitive neuroectodermal tumor cells that tend to be radioresponsive and spread diffusely through the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Utilizing clinical manifestations to suspect and then localize the brain tumor, morphologic markers, that can be appreciated with computerized tomography and cerebral angiography as well as at operation, provide a basis for more aggressive extirpation and the usefulness of radiation and chemotherapy. Metastatic neoplasms possess such markers as tumor hemorrhage and meningeal involvement suggesting specific extraneural sources. In almost half of these patients, cytologic examination of the CSF should help to identify the malignant cells. Although most gliomas do not metastasize either within or outside the central nervous system, the occurrence of primitive neuroectodermal tumor cells (undifferentiated malignant small cells) in about 20% of all glioblastomas implies spread throughout the CSF and some radioresponsiveness. With thorough clinicomorphologic evaluations of all patients with brain tumors in concert with liberal clinical consultations, the aggressive, newer therapeutic modalities can be used more effectively."
CD009372,0,1766539,0,"[Cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage, and inhibitory effect of nicardipine investigated by means of transcranial Doppler ultrasonography].","Cerebral vasospasm is a major complication associated with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). However, real-time evaluation of vasospasm is very difficult via angiography, CT scan, and cerebral blood flow. In this study, for the evaluation of the arterial narrowing, the flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery (MCAFV) was measured with transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (TCD) in 41 patients with ruptured cerebral aneurysms which were repaired surgically within 48 hours after SAH. MCAFV was measured daily until the 25th day after onset. All patients underwent CT scan, angiography, and neurological assessments upon admission. To clarify the morphological changes of the cerebral vessels due to SAH, angiography was performed again about 10 days after surgery. For evaluation of the efficacy of treatment for vasospasm, 21 out of 41 cases were administered a calcium antagonist (4mg of nicardipine) through the cisternal drain every 12 hours for an average of 10 days. The other 20 cases did not receive nicardipine and served as controls. 15 patients with clinical symptoms had a rapid increase in MCAFV from the 3rd to 6th day after onset, and a high velocity of more than 150cm/sec continued for 7.6 +/- 3.6 days on the average. In marked contrast, 26 patients without clinical symptoms showed only a small increase in MCAFV of less than 110cm/sec. There was a significant correlation between the arterial narrowing of MCA and MCAFV (gamma = 0.72, p less than 0.01) except for 5 cases (12%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD009372,0,10971665,0,Case reports: postpartum cerebral angiopathy in a patient with chronic migraine with aura.,"A 25-year-old woman with a history of chronic severe migraine with aura presented in an apoplectic state 1 week after the delivery of her third child. She developed a severe headache and within hours lapsed into a coma. A CT scan of the brain showed cerebral edema and an occipital hemorrhage. A four-vessel angiogram showed diffuse arterial narrowing of all the intracranial vessels with segmental narrowing of the suprasellar portion of the internal carotid arteries bilaterally. She had no risk factors for stroke or vasculitis. Her pregnancy and delivery were uneventful with no preeclampsia or eclampsia. Apart from ergometrine at the time of the delivery, no vasoconstrictor drugs were used. She recovered spontaneously. Serial CT scans of the brain demonstrated resolution of the edema and hemorrhage with the development of cortical and watershed infarcts. A repeat cerebral angiogram was normal. She was, therefore, diagnosed as having suffered from postpartum cerebral angiopathy, a form of reversible cerebral vasoconstriction, called the Call or Call-Fleming syndrome. The relationship between migraine and postpartum angiopathy in the development of reversible cerebral vasoconstriction is discussed."

CD009372,0,15645155,0,New developments in MRA: time-resolved MRA.,"For many clinical questions, less invasive angiography methods have at least in part already replaced digital subtraction angiography (DSA) as a routine diagnostic procedure. However, temporal resolution achievable with DSA is still indispensable in some patients. Recent advances in MR hardware performance and imaging techniques permit sub-second frame rate MR angiographies to be performed using a rapidly repeated fast T1 weighted gradient echo sequence during administration of a contrast bolus, and subsequent complex subtraction in k-space to emphasise the difference in phase between stationary tissue and contrast-enhanced blood. This technique allows two-dimensional projection angiograms to be obtained at a temporal frame rate of three images per second and with a spatial in-plane resolution of about one square millimetre. This time-resolved information is important for (a) the detection and follow-up of arteriovenous malformations, including their arterial feeders, the size of the nidus and their venous drainage patterns, (b) the demonstration of dural arteriovenous fistulas, recognised as an early filling of a dural sinus during the early arterial phase, and (c) the characterization of the vascularisation of brain tumours. With regards to vascular malformations, the direction of venous drainage and therefore the most pressing clinical questions concerning the need for therapeutic intervention can be ascertained. This technique is the only MR imaging method able to provide dynamic information on the cerebral vasculature. It therefore constitutes a helpful adjunct to the imaging armentarium in many clinical situations."

CD009372,0,22302557,0,Blood oxygen level dependent angiography (BOLDangio) and its potential applications in cancer research.,"Clinically, development of anti-angiogenic drugs for cancer therapy is pivotal. Longitudinal monitoring of tumour angiogenesis can help clinicians determine the effectiveness of anti-angiogenic therapy. Blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) effect has been widely used for functional imaging and tumour oxygenation assessment. In this study, the BOLD effect is investigated under different levels of oxygen inhalation for the development of a novel angiographic MRI technique, blood oxygen level dependent angiography (BOLDangio). Under short-term (<10 min) generalized hypoxia induced by inhalation of 8% oxygen, we measure BOLD contrast as high as 25% from vessels at 9.4T using a simple gradient echo (GRE) pulse sequence. This produces high-resolution 2D and 3D maps of normal and tumour brain vasculature in less than 10 minutes. Additionally, this technique reliably detects metastatic tumours and tumour-induced intracranial hemorrhage. BOLDangio provides a sensitive research tool for MRI of vasculature under normal and pathological conditions. Thus, it may be applied as a simple monitoring technique for measuring the effectiveness of anti-angiogenic drugs in a preclinical environment."

Twenty-four patients with 26 large intracranial aneurysms underwent MRI and DSA. All these aneurysms, diameter from 15 to 39 mm, were located at internal cerebral artery (n=12), vertebral artery (n=3), basilar artery (n=4), anterior cerebral artery (n=2), middle cerebral artery (n=2), anterior communicate artery (n=2) and posterior communicate artery (n=1). Thirteen cases of hematoma or cavernoma were studied as control group. All patients were examined on GE 1.5T MR system. ECG-gated cine MRA was performed with 2D multi-phase fast gradient-recalled echo sequence in a single section. All the images were analyzed with signal intensity VS time curve for differentiating intraaneurysmal blood flow from static tissue. The results were analyzed by statistic ""t"" test. 3D-CEMRA was performed with spoiled gradient-recalled echo and one dose of Gd-DTPA. All data was processed with multi-plannar reformat (MPR) and tomography for the demonstration of aneurysms in detail. All 26 aneurysms were demonstrated successfully by combined application of both cine MRA and 3D-CEMRA. Compared to DSA and conventional 3D-MOTSA, its sensitivity and specificity figures were both 100%. Cine MRA could differentiate the blood flow from the static tissue. The intensity VS time curves of intraaneurysmal blood flow offered fluctuating form and average signal change between systole and diastole period was about 89.8 +/- 37.4; However, under the control group, intraaneurysmal thrombus or cerebral hemorrhage or cavernomas had no significant signal change and the curves offered steady form with the average signal change being about 8.2 +/- 6.3. There was statistically significant difference between the intraaneurysmal blood flow and static tissue (P=0.025, <0.05). 3D-CEMRA was very useful in demonstrating the aneurysmal size, intraaneurysmal thrombus formation, neck and the detailed relationship of the aneurysm to the surrounding structures. It was concluded that the combined application of both cine MRA and 3D-CEMRA might be a valuable clinical tool for the detection of large intracranial aneurysms."

In each case, the clinical course, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT) and angiographic (AG) findings were evaluated. Patients were followed up from 9 months to 2.5 years postoperatively. MRI was much more sensitive than CT for appreciating the ischaemic tissue. The infarct volume determined by MRI had greater extent than previously detected by CT. If the difference of the infarct volume, detected by MRI and CT was more than 30% the patients appeared to have benefited from bypass surgery as demonstrated clinically as well as with postoperative MRI and AG studies. Patients with lesser difference showed insignificant or no postoperative improvement."

CT scan was made in all patients on admission, with the use of intravenous infusion of contrast agent in 35 patients. Cerebral angiography was performed in 37 patients and MRI was performed in 22 patients. Forty-one patients underwent surgery and the other fourteen patients were treated conservatively. The cause of bleeding had been discovered before surgery in 12 cases; 10 arteriovenous malformations and 2 brain tumors. They were discovered by meticulous neuroradiological investigations including cerebral angiography, MRI, dynamic MRI, MRA and enhancing CT. The cause of bleeding was newly discovered after surgery in 7 cases; all of amyloid angiopathy. It remained unknown in the other 22 surgical cases although hypertensive angiopathy was suspected in eleven of them. Among the 14 patients who received conservative therapy, hemorrhagic diathesis including the use of Warfarin and DIC was the cause of bleeding in four cases and the etiology remained unknown in other ten, although hypertensive angiopathy was suspected in eight of them. The 32 patients in whom the etiology remained unknown had been observed as long as 12-120 months (mean, 40 months) and although bleeding has occurred at different locations in two of these patients, there has been no recurrence of bleeding at the same location in any of them. In conclusion, surgery is not indicated to determine the etiology of subcortical hemorrhage when meticulous neuroradiological investigations fail to disclose any vascular or tumorous lesions."

All 110 patients also had one or more 4-vessel digital subtraction cerebral angiograms. The CT scans were reviewed in each case without knowledge of the angiographic result. In nine patients (8%), SAH was confined to the perimesencephalic area, interpeduncular cistern and/or prepontine region at CT. All nine patients had at least two, and some as many as four, negative cerebral angiograms. Eighteen of the 110 patients (16%) ultimately had negative angiography. Hence, the patients with isolated perimesencephalic haemorrhage (PMH) accounted for 50% of the negative angiograms. There was a significant association between isolated PMH and negative angiography (chi 2 = 50.1, P < 0.005). The specificity of PMH for negative angiography was 100% (95% confidence interval (CI) = 97-100%) and the sensitivity of PMH for a negative study was 50% (95% CI = 16-84%). Six of the 110 patients had basilar artery aneurysms demonstrated angiographically as the cause of their SAH but none of these six had isolated PMH at CT. All patients with isolated PMH were alive and well at follow up and none had suffered repeat SAH or vasospasm-related ischaemic cerebral injury. Perimesencephalic haemorrhage should be distinguished from SAH in general, because of the good prognosis associated with it and the doubtful need for repeat cerebral angiography after an initial negative study."

Case report.","A ruptured blisterlike aneurysm of the supraclinoid ICA rarely occurs. Nevertheless, it is recognized as a dangerous lesion because of the high risk of intraoperative bleeding associated with this lesion's wide fragile neck. There has been only one report of a blisterlike aneurysm treated by endosaccular packing after surgical wrapping. The authors describe the case of a ruptured blisterlike aneurysm with a pseudoaneurysm cavity, which was treated by coil embolization. This 63-year-old woman suffered a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Three cerebral aneurysms were identified on cerebral angiograms. A large saccular aneurysm at the ophthalmic portion of the right ICA was embolized with Guglielmi Detachable Coils (GDCs). Two small hemipherically shaped aneurysms on the C-2 and C-3 portions of the left ICA were observed conservatively. Thirteen days later, recurrent SAH was identified on computerized tomography scans. Angiography demonstrated the formation of a pseudoaneurysm from the aneurysm on the C-2 portion of the left ICA. Endosaccular embolization with GDCs was performed 40 days after admission. Disappearance of the pseudoaneurysm cavity and residual dome filling was seen immediately after the procedure. Follow-up angiography performed 9 months after embolization demonstrated complete obliteration of the aneurysm. This case illustrates that when treatment options for a blisterlike aneurysm with a pseudoaneurysm are unsuitable during the acute phase, coil embolization can be applied following progression of the lesion into a saccular aneurysm during the chronic stage."

He first experienced repeated transient ischemic attacks, and cerebral angiography disclosed complete occlusion in the cervical portion of the left internal carotid artery. STA-MCA anastomosis was performed, and the ischemic attacks stopped. Postoperative angiography confirmed patency of the anastomosis and good filling of the cortical branches of the left MCA. Five years after surgery, the patient suffered sudden onset of generalized convulsions and consciousness disturbance. Computed tomography disclosed a massive intracerebral hemorrhage in the left frontoparietal region, and angiography revealed an aneurysmal dilatation at the site of the anastomosis that was not seen before. Emergency evacuation of the hematoma and clipping of the aneurysmal dilatation were performed. The patient recovered well and became ambulatory. Histological examination of the surgical specimen showed collagen tissue, indicating a pseudoaneurysm. Patients who undergo STA-MCA anastomosis, especially hypertensive patients, should be followed up by repeated magnetic resonance angiography to confirm the patency of the anastomosis and cerebral perfusion, and to detect the formation of pseudoaneurysms at the anastomosis site, which can cause fatal bleeding."

Throbbing headache occurred several hours prior to his weakness. Brain CT obtained on day 3 demonstrated low density areas in the medial part of the left frontal lobe. Cerebral angiography on day 14 demonstrated dilatation and narrowing of the left anterior cerebral artery (ACA) corresponding to ""pearl and string sign"". The diagnosis of spontaneous ACA dissection was established with clinical features, laboratory findings, and angiographic findings. Antiplatelet therapy was undertaken for the prevention of ischemic events. Serial Brain CT demonstrated hemorrhagic change in the area of infarction. However, there was no definite clinical deterioration. Antiplatelet therapy was withdrawn after hemorrhagic change was noted. Cerebral angiography on day 35 showed improvement of both dilatation and narrowing. Possible reperfusion injury caused by absorption of intramural hematoma seems to be responsible for hemorrhagic change. In patients with cerebral infarction due to dissection of intracranial arteries, antithrombotic therapy is controversial as hemorrhagic complications including hemorrhagic infarction as well as subarachnoidal hemorrhage can occur. Further accumulation of cases is required."

There is great interest amongst radiologists about the perceived benefits of clinical imaging at 3.0 T; however, it remains to be seen whether the theoretical advantages will bring real gains. MRI in patients with non-traumatic intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) is difficult, yet, these patients benefit from non-invasive angiography.

The axial stereoscopic images and multi-projection images were used in 3D-CTA, and the anteroposterior views and lateral views were used in DSA. DSA showed that the vein of Labbe (VL) was the most common venous flow on the lateral or basal surface of the temporal lobe, whereas 3D-CTA demonstrated that the involvement of the temporo-basal vein (TBV) was equal to that of VL in frequency. 3D-CTA showed that the VL flowed into the transverse sinus (TS) on 132 sides, the sigmoid sinus-TS junction on 29 sides, and the lateral tentorial sinus (LTS) on 40 sides. DSA showed that the VL flowed into the TS on 157 sides and into the LTS only on 5 sides. DSA showed that the TBV flowed into the TS on 37 sides but axial 3D-CTA showed that the TBV flowed into the LTS on 48 sides. This inconsistency reflects the difficulty in confirming and identifying these veins on the anteroposterior view of DSA, due to the overlapping of veins and poor delineation. Axial stereo and multi-projection images of 3D-CTA provided practical images of the deep veins of the skull base venous system and showed the relative anatomical relationships of the arteries and bony structures. This information can specify the venous inflow point, and help to determine the direction of approach and working space, and also help to identify intraoperative landmarks for the subtemporal approach. Presurgical examination of the deep venous system with 3D-CTA may help to minimize unexpected injury to veins and venous infarction."
CD009372,0,929652,0,"Incidence of stroke in Frederiksberg, Denmark.","Since 1971, stroke registers in several countries have been cooperating in a study of stroke epidemiology, initiated by WHO. One of the registers covers the population of Frederiksberg, Copenhagen. During the first two years of registration strokes were recorded in 556 Frederiksberg citizens. A certain diagnosis of cerebral hemorrhage--verified by angiography, spinal fluid examination, or autopsy--was made in 10% of the patients; subarachnoid hemorrhage was demonstrated in only 2%; most of the remaining patients probably had cerebral infarction. The overall annual incidence of stroke, when adjusted for age for the Danish population, was 1.9 per 1,000 for males, and 1.6 per 1,000 for females. For every type of stroke, except subarachnoid hemorrhage, the incidence increased markedly with age. The age-specific stroke incidence rates found in the present investigation are much lower than those demonstrated by Aho in a community-based study in Finland. In view of the strict comparability of the two studies, real differences in the risk of stroke may exist between the two communities."

The patient was a healthy 32-year-old woman with a sudden onset of severe occipitalgia. Next day, her headache improved gradually, and she consulted with our department. Although we initially suspected that she was suffering from SAH, neurological findings, CT, and cerebrospinal fluid examination did not reveal any abnormal conditions, including SAH. Therefore, she was treated conservatively with analgesics. Twelve days after the initial onset of the headache, she was admitted because of severe re-attack of headache, rt. hemiparesis with rt. oculomotor nerve palsy and loss of consciousness. CT revealed moderate SAH and cerebral angiograms showed VBA-DA. After the cerebral angiography, bleeding reoccurred two times and she lost her life. We present the case, review the literature and discuss the relationship between presenting symptom of headache and non-hemorrhagic VBA-DA. A few cases of non-hemorrhagic VBA-DA have been reported in the literature in which the only presenting symptom was headache, followed by delayed SAH from non-hemorrhagic dissecting aneurysm. Consequently, we concluded that her initial symptom of headache was due to dissection of vertebrobasilar artery, and that SAH was due to delayed hemorrhage of non-hemorrhagic VBA-DA. Even when neurological findings, CT and cerebrospinal fluid examination reveal no abnormalities in the early stage after the sudden onset of headache, especially in the occiptal or nuchal regions, non-hemorrhagic VBA-DA, which has a risk of fatal hemorrhage, cannot be ruled out with certainty. Therefore, MRI, MRA, three-dimensional CT, or cerebral angiography should be performed in such cases."

As outlined in this article, it has taken the efforts of several early pioneers to lay the ground work for interventional neurology, a specialty that has become one of the fastest growing neurological subspecialties. The ground work, along with a great clinical need, has allowed the modern interventional neurologist to tackle some of the most intractable diseases, especially those affecting the cerebral vasculature. The institutionalization of interventional neurology as a subspecialty was first advocated in 1995 in an article entitled, ""Interventional Neurology, a subspecialty whose time has come."" The institutions created in the wake of this article have provided the framework that has allowed interventional neurology to transition from ""a subspecialty whose time has come"" to a subspecialty that is here to stay and thrive."

CD009372,0,1999776,0,High risk of recurrent stroke after discontinuance of five to twelve years of transfusion therapy in patients with sickle cell disease.,"Although long-term transfusion therapy is at least 90% effective in preventing recurrent strokes after an initial cerebrovascular accident in patients with sickle cell disease, it is unknown how long transfusion therapy should be continued. To address this question, we prospectively discontinued transfusions in 10 patients with sickle cell disease whose median duration of transfusion therapy after an initial stroke was 9 1/2 years (range 5 to 12 years). Before the transfusions were discontinued, patients were examined by cerebral angiography, magnetic resonance imaging of the head, neuropsychologic testing, electroencephalography, and a complete neurologic examination. Within 12 months after transfusion therapy was stopped, 5 of 10 patients had had an ischemic event. Three events caused relatively mild deficits in the same areas as those originally affected. Two were associated with massive intracranial hemorrhage, including one on the contralateral side of original involvement. An additional patient died suddenly of unknown causes. Of the four remaining patients, three declined to resume transfusion and are relatively well at greater than or equal to 18 months after therapy was stopped. The studies performed before transfusions were stopped were not predictive of recurrent stroke. The risk of recurrent cerebrovascular accident in this group was significantly greater than the estimated risk of 10% in patients who are receiving long-term transfusion therapy (p = 0.002). This adverse outcome suggests that patients with sickle cell disease who have had a stroke must receive long-term transfusion indefinitely or a suitable therapeutic alternative must be devised."
CD009372,0,14669530,0,Thrombosis and recanalization of symptomatic nongiant saccular aneurysm.,Complete thrombosis followed by recanalization of giant aneurysms is an infrequent process that has been exceptionally mentioned in relation to nongiant saccular aneurysms. A 25-year-old male presented with a right temporal hematoma and associated subarachnoid hemorrhage. Cerebral angiography revealed a small blister-like dilatation at the right middle cerebral artery bifurcation. The cerebral hematoma was surgically removed and a large thrombosed aneurysm was discovered and was wrapped. Follow-up angiography revealed complete recanalization of the aneurysm with preservation of all the arterial branches and the aneurysm was then completely occluded with detachable coils. This case provides insight into the well-known but poorly understood dynamic process of thrombosis and recanalization of cerebral aneurysms. The possible role of a cerebral hematoma in the pathogenesis of this process is discussed.

CD009372,0,2353094,0,Cerebral blood flow: assessment with dynamic contrast-enhanced T2*-weighted MR imaging at 1.5 T.,"The authors assessed regional cerebral blood flow dynamics with magnetic resonance (MR) imaging enhanced with gadolinium diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA). After bolus administration of Gd-DTPA, rapid T2*-weighted gradient-echo images were acquired. Image acquisition time ranged from 2 to 3 seconds. The signal intensity (SI) of brain tissue and blood vessels markedly decreased during the first pass of contrast agent through the brain due to the local field inhomogeneity caused by the concentrated paramagnetic contrast agent. The method was used in 18 subjects with no cerebrovascular disease and 32 patients with stroke, vascular stenosis, arteriovenous malformation, and cerebral neoplasm. Comparison with intracranial angiography was performed in three patients and with single-photon emission computed tomography of blood flow in four. The change in T2* relaxation rate was approximately linearly related to the dose of contrast agent. The SI change increased as the echo time was lengthened. Regions in cerebral infarcts, metastases, and arteriovenous malformations showed different enhancement patterns than those of edema around a lesion and of normal brain tissue. Abnormal circulation times in patients with vascular stenoses were demonstrated. The method provides information about cerebral blood flow dynamics not available from conventional MR imaging and MR angiography."

An arterial ectasia was demonstrated on the basilar artery, arising at the origin of the left superior cerebellar artery. The left posterior cerebral artery was supplied only by the left carotid artery through a dilated posterior communicating artery. A second left vertebral angiogram was performed at D8, to make sure whether this ectasia was an aneurysm or a non aneurysmal dysplasia, but failed to provide certainty. The patient was operated upon at D17, with the diagnosis of possible aneurysm at the origin of the left superior cerebellar artery. Through a pterional route the posterior communicating artery was approached, no blood was found in the area of the upper basilar artery; there was an abnormal posterior circle of Willis, the superior cerebellar artery arising with a common trunk from the upper basilar artery; distal to this common trunk, the P1 segment was normal on the first three fourths of its course; the last fourth of the P1 segment was highly narrowed, the outer diameter of the narrowed P1 segment was approximately one third of the normal P1 segment, and was located at the junction with the complex posterior communicating artery-P2 segment.

A 69-year-old woman who had undergone artificial graft replacement for an aortic aneurysm presented with transient left hemiparesis. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a small fresh cerebral infarction in the right frontal lobe, although major cervical and cerebral arteries were shown to be intact on MR angiography. Antiplatelet and anticoagulation treatments commenced. On the 21st day after onset, the patient suffered a subarachnoid hemorrhage, and a digital subtraction angiogram revealed aneurysmal lesions in the distal MCA. Based on the histological examination of the resected aneurysms, proliferation of large B-cell lymphoma was identified in the dilated arterial lumen. On the 71st day after ischemic onset, intracranial hemorrhage recurred, and she died. Postmortem examination revealed similar lymphoma cells only in the intimal layer that had grown on the artificial graft, and it was decided that the patient had had intravascular large B-cell lymphoma. The preceding cerebral infarction was thought to be due to occlusion of the distal MCA by tumor embolus, which may be the initial pathological stage in aneurysm formation. For patients with incomprehensible ischemic cerebral stroke, neoplasm must be taken in consideration."

In addition, the predictive value of different clinical grading systems as applied to this series was compared. All patients had a computed tomographic scan and a positive angiogram before surgery. Complete resection was proven angiographically. The univariate Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon rank sum test, the Fisher exact test, Spearman's rank correlation coefficient analysis, and multivariate logistic regression were used as statistical methods. Duration of surgery, the development, of either new deficits or an increase in the preoperative neurological signs immediately after surgery, and rehabilitation (as measured by the Karnofsky index) were taken as target variables for the difficulty of operation and for postoperative morbidity, respectively. The largest diameter of the nidus of the arteriovenous malformation, eloquence of the adjacent brain, and deep venous drainage showed the most consistent correlation with these target variables. Intracerebral hematoma and other single factors, such as the age of the patient or localization of the arteriovenous malformation did not affect the outcome. The clinical grading scale of Spetzler and Martin provided better prediction of surgical risks than other proposed systems."

Case 1; a 68-year-old female suffered from sudden onset of severe headache and nausea. On admission, it was found she was lethargic. However, her consciousness deteriorated down to semicoma with tetraparetic condition soon after. CT revealed subarachnoid hemorrhage in the basal, quadrigeminal and supravermian cisterns and blood clots in the entire ventricle. Cerebral angiography demonstrated an aneurysm located at the distal segment of the left PICA. She was initially treated conservatively because of being in Hunt and Kosnik Grade 5, and then, 3 weeks after onset, suboccipital craniectomy was performed and the aneurysm was clipped successfully. Case 2; a 60-year-old, female, suddenly experienced severe suboccipitalgia and vomiting. CT revealed subarachnoid hemorrhage in the entire subarachnoid space and intraventricular hemorrhages in the 4th, 3rd and lateral ventricles. Subsequently cerebral angiography was performed and left VAG demonstrated an aneurysm at the left A2-A3 junction. She underwent bifrontal craniotomy and the aneurysm was clipped via the interhemispheric approach. Her postoperative course was uneventful.

CD009372,0,16447742,0,[Cerebral arterial dissection].,"We investigated a total of 98 cases with stroke caused by cerebral arterial dissection recruited in Strategies against Stroke Study for Young Adults in Japan (SASSY-Japan). The most frequent site of dissection was the intracranial vertebrobasilar artery. The stroke subtype was divided into ischemic (TIA and cerebral infarction) and hemorrhagic types (subarachnoid hemorrhage). The ischemic type was predominant (69%) and patients with the ischemic type were younger than those with the hemorrhagic type (P < 0.01). In the intracranial arterial dissection, nearly all cases were of the ischemic type. In contrast, in the extracranial arterial dissection, 60% of cases were ischemic and 40% were hemorrhagic. Cerebral angiography was the most important diagnostic procedure in the hemorrhagic type. In the ischemic type, MRI and MRA were more frequently used to show the findings specific to the dissection such as an intimal flap or double lumen and intramural hematoma. The outcome at discharge is generally good such that the modified Rankin Score was among 0-II in 69% of cases. However, in the hemorrhagic type, recurrence during an acute stage was frequent, and the outcome was poor with a mortalit rate of 19%. The establishment of an effective intervention to prevent the recurrence of subarachnoid hemorrhage is urgently required."

To compare these techniques, we examined 53 patients within 6 h of a stroke, using a standardised MRI protocol including fast-FLAIR and 3D time-of-flight TOF MR to detect vessel occlusion or reduced flow corresponding to the suspected ischaemic territory. Brain infarcts were confirmed on MRI after 1-5 days in 41 cases (77%). The overall accuracy of 3D-TOF MRA was 68% and sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values were 67%, 71%, 87%, and 43% respectively. Values for the fast-FLAIR sequence were: 65%, 85%, 93% and 44%, with an overall accuracy of 70%.

However, some patients diagnosed as having ""SAH of unknown cause"" actually harbor undetected aneurysms. The authors report six patients with SAH who, despite multiple negative cerebral angiograms, underwent exploratory surgery due to a high clinical and radiographic suspicion for the presence of an aneurysm. Brain computerized tomography (CT) scans revealed blood located mainly in the basal frontal interhemispheric fissure in four patients, in the sylvian fissure in one patient, and in the interpeduncular cistern in one patient. The patients were evaluated as Hunt and Hess Grades I to III, and had undergone at least two high-quality cerebral angiograms that did not reveal an aneurysm. Vasospasm was visualized in two patients. Three patients rebled while in the hospital. Exploratory surgery was performed at an average of 12 days post-SAH. Five aneurysms were discovered at surgery and were successfully clipped. All four patients with interhemispheric blood were found to have an anterior communicating artery (ACoA) aneurysm. The patient with blood in the sylvian fissure was found to have a middle cerebral artery aneurysm. These aneurysms were partially thrombosed. No aneurysm was detected in the patient with interpeduncular SAH, despite extensive basilar artery exploration. Five patients had an excellent outcome and one patient developed diabetes insipidus. These results show that exploratory aneurysm surgery is warranted, despite repeated negative cerebral angiograms, if the patient manifests the classical signs of SAH with CT scans localizing blood to a specific cerebral blood vessel (particularly the ACoA) and if a second SAH is documented at the same site."

CD009372,0,1297551,0,[Clinical significance of carotid and ocular bruits in cerebrovascular disease].,"We investigated the clinical significance of carotid and ocular bruits in 250 consecutive patients with cerebrovascular disease (CVD). The incidence of bruits was compared with that in 100 age- and sex-matched neurological controls without CVD. In the cerebrovascular disease group, carotid bruits alone were found in 12 patients, both carotid and ocular bruits in 7, and ocular bruits alone in 2. Carotid bruits were found only in 3 controls. We then evaluated cerebrovascular disease in the 25 patients (16 men and 9 women) who had bruits. The patients ranged from 55 to 81 years in age (mean: 70.6 years). The patients with carotid bruits alone constituted the largest group, and those with ocular bruits alone were the smallest group. Carotid bruits were heard and abnormal blood flow was observed in 19/28 arteries of the 21 patients who underwent echo-flow studies. Carotid artery stenosis/occlusion was detected in 24/31 arteries (77%) in 23 patients who underwent digital subtraction angiography (DSA). Thus, the sensitivity was 0.77 and specificity of a carotid bruit 0.91, respectively. In 9/10 patients with unilateral ocular bruits, ipsilateral or contralateral carotid artery stenosis/occlusion was detected. Diminished cerebral blood flow was observed in 10/15 patients with bruits who underwent SPECT. Of these 8 had reduced cerebral blood flow ipsilaterally to the bruit. Blood flow was reduced in the carotid artery territory in all of the patients, and watershed reductions were commonest. Among the 25 patients, some showed neurological semiology of the vertebrobasilar territory in addition to that of the carotid territory.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD009372,0,2950690,0,[Combined lesions of the major arteries of the head (clinico-doppleroangiographic correlations)].,"Using Doppler ultrasonography (DUSG) under outpatient conditions multiple combined lesions of the main arteries of the head were found in 127 patients. Comparison of the above results with the findings of cerebral angiography showed a high efficiency of DUSG. In occlusion of the carotid and vertebral arteries the accuracy of the method was 99%, specificity 99%, sensitivity 100%; in stenoses of the internal carotid arteries the respective values were 88, 84, and 95%; in cases of all stenoses of the vertebral arteries they were 93, 92, and 94%. A comparative analysis of the clinical, Doppler and angiographic findings revealed that an increase in the frequency and degree of impairment of the main arteries of the head correlated with an elevated rate of cerebral circulation disorders in several vascular beds."
CD009372,0,3895593,0,Comparison of ultrasound and IV-DSA for carotid evaluation.,"Sixty carotid bifurcations in 34 symptomatic patients were examined prospectively with ultrasound (continuous wave Doppler and high resolution, B-mode imaging) and intravenous digital subtraction angiography (IV-DSA). The overall quality of examination was better with DSA than with ultrasound. Imaging of the external carotid artery was particularly difficult with sonography. For evaluation of the common and internal carotid arteries, eight percent of IV-DSA studies were poor or inadequate as compared with 12% for B-mode imaging. Overall for detection of atherosclerotic plaque, high resolution B-mode sonography was 84% sensitive and DSA 81% sensitive. When only the common and internal carotid arteries were considered, the sensitivity of high resolution sonography improved to 93% and the sensitivity of IV-DSA increased to 86%. Ultrasound (combined high resolution, B-mode sonography and CW Doppler) correctly identified all six internal carotid occlusions in the series. While IV-DSA correctly identified five of the six occlusions, the sensitivity for detection of lesions causing 70% or more stenosis was 95% for both ultrasound and IV-DSA. Sensitivity for 50% or greater obstruction was 79% for ultrasound and 85% for IV-DSA. Ultrasound sensitivity for greater than 50.9% stenoses rose to 87% when only the common and internal carotid were considered while IV-DSA sensitivity remained at 85%. Specificity was good at all levels of obstruction. It may be concluded from this study that the accuracy of ultrasound and IV-DSA are quite similar for evaluation of the carotid bifurcation and that either test is a satisfactory screening method for carotid bifurcation atheromatous disease."

These patients underwent a protocol of T1 and T2 weighted sequences, diffusion weighted sequences and MR - angiography within 6 hours after onset of acute hemiparesis. The signal behaviour of ICH in any stage after bleeding was additionally reviewed in a retrospective series of 63 patients, who were submitted for MRI over a 12 months period because of known ICH.MRI correctly identified 4 hyperacute ICH in the prospective group and 4 hyperacute ICH in the retrospective group. These ICHs had high signal on T2 weighted images, were isointense in T1 weighted images and had signal voids on the diffusion weighted sequences. The signal intensities of acute, subacute and chronic ICHs correlated to previous experiences as reported in the literature.In conclusion, MRI reliably identified all hematomas even in the hyperacute stage. Diffusion weighted images were most sensitive to the presence of deoxyhemoglobine and helpful for the differentiation and characterization of acute ischemia. Therefore, MRI at 1.5 T can be employed as an alternative to CT for the emergency diagnosis of acute stroke."
CD009372,0,7222156,0,Limitations of quantitative oculoplethysmography and of directional Doppler ultrasonography in cerebrovascular diagnosis: assessment of an air-filled OPG system.,"500 consecutive patients were evaluated for extracranial disease of the internal carotid arteries by an automated, air-filled, digital oculoplethysmographic system (OPG) of the Kartchner type (Zira) and by supraorbital (SO) and supratrochlear (ST) directional Doppler ultrasonography. Cerebral arteriograms were performed in 58 patients (110 vessels), and OPG timing criteria for detecting hemodynamically significant carotid artery stenosis (60% or greater diameter reduction) were ascertained. Optimal criteria were a delay of one ocular pulse, relative to the other, of greater than 12 msec; and a delay of an ocular pulse, relative to the earlier ear (external carotid) pulse, of greater than 36 msec. These criteria correctly identified 73% of vessels with 0 to 59% stenosis and 76% of vessels with 60 to 100% stenosis. However, in 26% of the vessels, OPG was either inconclusive or inaccurate. Correct diagnosis of bilateral hemodynamically significant carotid artery stenoses was made by OPG in 6 of 9 affected patients. SO Doppler was normal in 70% of vessels with 0-59% stenosis, and abnormal in 75% of vessels with 60-100% stenosis. Corresponding percentages for ST Doppler were 95% and 44%. Abnormal Doppler responses to compression of contralateral facial branches were predictive of intracranial cross-collateralization in only 25% of patients. These results suggest that both quantitative OPG in its present form and directional Doppler studies have serious limitations as non-invasive diagnostic methods."
CD009372,0,6881442,0,A comparison of digital subtraction angiography and noninvasive testing in the diagnosis of cerebrovascular disease.,"Among the 1,892 patients who underwent cerebrovascular digital subtraction angiography at our hospital over the past 18 months, there was a subgroup of 34 patients (65 carotid arteries) for whom noninvasive cerebrovascular test results and standard cerebral arteriograms were also available. These patients were reviewed retrospectively and the ability of both methods to detect hemodynamically significant lesions, defined as a greater than 50 percent reduction in the diameter of the carotid artery, was determined using the arteriograms as the ""gold standard."" Noninvasive cerebrovascular tests had a sensitivity of 81 percent, a specificity of 95 percent, a positive predictive value of 92 percent, a negative prediction value of 88 percent, and an overall accuracy of 89 percent. Digital subtraction angiography had a sensitivity of 84 percent, a specificity of 92 percent, a positive predictive value of 88 percent, a negative predictive value of 89 percent, and an overall accuracy of 89 percent. If the four cases of hemodynamically significant stenosis of the carotid siphon not detected by digital subtraction angiography had been considered as false-negatives, its sensitivity would have been reduced to 72 percent. In patients with hemispheric cerebral ischemia, we found noninvasive cerebrovascular tests neither necessary nor cost-effective. Digital subtraction angiography, on the other hand, often provided definitive diagnostic information in such patients if the intracranial circulation was well defined and the extracranial lesion corresponded to the patients' symptoms. Noninvasive cerebrovascular testing was the safest and most cost-effective technique for screening patients with asymptomatic bruits, atypical, nonhemispheric cerebral symptoms, and those who have undergone carotid endarterectomy. If the noninvasive cerebrovascular test result was positive or equivocal, digital subtraction angiography was performed to localize the responsible lesion and exclude carotid occlusion."

CD009372,0,10377827,0,[Neuroimaging in patients with CVD].,"The development of the neuroimaging technique has revolutionized clinical neurology. This is also true in the field of stroke. Because of the easy accessibility and little time consuming, the computed tomography (CT) should be applied first to the stroke patient and other examinations should be prepared later to the patient due to the severity and the characteristic of the lesion. These are magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (including MR angiography. MR spectroscopy, diffusion MRI), cerebral angiography, neurosonography (carotid ultrasound, color flow imaging, transcranial Doppler), single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET), etc. It is a matter of common sense that CT and MRI are now particularly important among laboratory examinations for neurological diseases and these non-invasive techniques will become more important for the elderly stroke patients.

CD009372,0,8751488,0,Surgical prophylaxis of recurrent stroke in patients with patent foramen ovale: a pilot study.,"Prevention of recurrent stroke in adults with patent foramen ovale represents a therapeutic challenge. Antiplatelet or anticoagulant treatment is widely introduced, but its exact indication is not known. In this pilot study, eight men and three women with previous ischemic cerebral events underwent direct surgical closure of the patent foramen ovale. Mean age was 39.4 (from 30 to 58) years. No coexisting cause of stroke was found after extensive investigations, including blood and coagulation tests, echocardiography, 24-hour three-lead electrocardiographic monitoring, extracranial and transcranial Doppler ultrasonography, and cerebral angiography. Criteria for operation also included at least two of the following: atrial septal aneurysm, multiple cerebral infarcts, a history of multiple cerebral events, and Valsalva strain before stroke. Before operation, one patient had two shunts (1 patent foramen ovale, 1 intrapulmonary shunt). No intraoperative or postoperative complications occurred, but a few hours after operation transient arrhythmias developed in two patients without atrial fibrillation, hemodynamic instability, or embolism. During a median follow-up of 12.2 months, no patient had recurrent stroke. All patients prospectively underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging and contrast echocardiography with simultaneous transcranial Doppler ultrasonography. A residual right-to-left interatrial shunt, smaller than the preoperative one, was observed in only one patient, whereas no lesion was seen on magnetic resonance imaging. Our study suggests that surgical closure of patent foramen ovale in patients with presumed paradoxic embolism is safe, with no recurrent stroke in the first year of follow-up. Further studies are needed to evaluate the long-term prognosis of patients with versus without operation and to define the role of operation as an alternative to prolonged antithrombotic treatment."
CD009372,0,8361576,0,[Radiation-induced cerebrovasculopathy: a case report and review of the literature].,"We reported a case of a patient who suffered from a cerebrovasculopathy after irradiation therapy for astrocytoma located at the left temporal lobe. An eleven year-old boy who presented himself with headache and vomiting as his chief complaints received partial removal of a tumor. Histological diagnosis of the tumor was astrocytoma (grade II). His preoperative cerebral angiograms showed mass sign solely, without stenosis or occlusion of the cerebral vessel. Postoperatively, he was treated with irradiation therapy involving the whole brain with a total of 30 Gy, and gamma knife therapy. Six months after irradiation, he started suffering from frequent cerebral ischemic attacks, but there was no regrowth of the tumor visible on CT scans. Cerebral angiograms were made again, and revealed multifocal stenoses in the bilateral internal carotid arteries, middle cerebral arteries, and the anterior cerebral artery. His symptoms did not improve after conservative treatment with steroids, calcium antagonist, or low molecular weight dextran. Although he received a superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery (STA-MCA) anastomoses bilaterally, multiple cerebral infarctions appeared. Although irradiation therapy is acceptable in patients with brain tumor, a cerebrovasculopathy after irradiation should be considered as one of the most important complications, and the risk incurred by irradiation therapy should lead to more careful consideration and caution when treating intracranial brain tumors, especially in children. From our experience, the usefulness of bypass surgery for radiation-induced cerebrovasculopathy is still controversial."

CD009372,0,18619779,0,One patent intracranial collateral predicts tolerance of flow reversal during carotid angioplasty and stenting.,Internal carotid artery (ICA) flow reversal is an effective means of cerebral protection during carotid stenting. Its main limitation is that in the absence of adequate collateral flow it may not be tolerated by the patient. The purpose of this study was to determine if preoperative identification of intracranial collaterals with computerized tomographic (CTA) or magnetic resonance (MRA) angiography can predict adequate collateral flow and neurological tolerance of ICA flow reversal for embolic protection. This was a study of patients undergoing transcervical carotid angioplasty and stenting. Neuroprotection was established by ICA flow reversal. All patients underwent preoperative cervical and cerebral noninvasive angiography with CTA or MRA and had at least one patent intracranial collateral. Mean carotid artery back pressure was measured. Neurological changes during carotid clamping and flow reversal were continuously monitored with electroencephalography (EEG). Thirty-seven patients with at least one patent intracranial collateral on brain imaging with CTA or MRA were included. Mean carotid artery back pressure was 58 mm Hg. All procedures were technically successful. No EEG changes were present with common carotid artery occlusion and ICA flow reversal. One patent intracranial collateral provides sufficient cerebral perfusion to perform carotid occlusion and flow reversal with absence of EEG changes. Continued progress in noninvasive imaging modalities is becoming increasingly helpful in our understanding of cerebral physiology and selection of patients for invasive carotid procedures.
CD009372,0,8338918,0,Value of magnetic resonance angiography for the detection of intracranial aneurysms in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease.,"The association of intracranial aneurysms with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), the 30-day mortality rate exceeding 50% for aneurysmal rupture, the effectiveness of surgical repair of unruptured aneurysms with a low surgical risk, and the development of noninvasive imaging techniques for their detection have led physicians to consider the value of screening patients with ADPKD for unruptured intracranial aneurysms. The sensitivity and specificity of high-resolution computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging for the diagnosis of small intracranial aneurysms have been disappointing. To determine the value of magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), 85 patients with ADPKD without symptoms related to an intracranial aneurysm and 2 patients with ADPKD presenting with a subarachnoid hemorrhage or a suspected aneurysmal leak were studied. MRA was performed with the Multisequence Vascular Package (GE Medical Systems) with use of three-dimensional time-of-flight and three-dimensional phase-contrast techniques, and postprocessing maximum intensity projection images were generated to eliminate the problem of overlapping vessels. Asymptomatic intracranial aneurysms were detected in 6 (22%) of 27 patients with and 3 (5%) of 56 patients without a family history of intracranial aneurysm or subarachnoid hemorrhage (P = 0.02, information missing in 2 patients) and in the 2 patients who presented with a symptomatic aneurysm. A stepwise logistic regression analysis indicated that a family history of intracranial aneurysm or subarachnoid hemorrhage was independently associated with the presence of intracranial aneurysms. All of the aneurysms were < or = 6.5 mm in diameter.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

CD009372,0,9626183,0,Magnetic resonance imaging of acute stroke.,"In the investigation of ischemic stroke, conventional structural magnetic resonance (MR) techniques (e.g., T1-weighted imaging, T2-weighted imaging, and proton density-weighted imaging) are valuable for the assessment of infarct extent and location beyond the first 12 to 24 hours after onset, and can be combined with MR angiography to noninvasively assess the intracranial and extracranial vasculature. However, during the critical first 6 to 12 hours, the probable period of greatest therapeutic opportunity, these methods do not adequately assess the extent and severity of ischemia. Recent developments in functional MR imaging are showing great promise for the detection of developing focal cerebral ischemic lesions within the first hours. These include (1) diffusion-weighted imaging, which provides physiologic information about the self-diffusion of water, thereby detecting one of the first elements in the pathophysiologic cascade leading to ischemic injury; and (2) perfusion imaging. The detection of acute intraparenchymal hemorrhagic stroke by susceptibility weighted MR has also been reported. In combination with MR angiography, these methods may allow the detection of the site, extent, mechanism, and tissue viability of acute stroke lesions in one imaging study. Imaging of cerebral metabolites with MR spectroscopy along with diffusion-weighted imaging and perfusion imaging may also provide new insights into ischemic stroke pathophysiology. In light of these advances in structural and functional MR, their potential uses in the study of the cerebral ischemic pathophysiology and in clinical practice are described, along with their advantages and limitations."

This 41 old, right-handed, hypertensive female suffered sudden onset of headache and right hemiparesis. Next day hematoma was evacuated by the CT-guided stereotactic aspiration because of progressive deterioration of the consciousness and patient recovered well. Fourteen days after the evacuation when she presented mild right hand weakness and motor aphasia, angiography revealed a saccular aneurysm with broad neck derived from left posterior parietal artery. A neck clipping necessitated an additional anastomosis between superficial temporal artery and distal middle cerebral artery because of parent artery stenosis. Postoperatively she is doing well with slight motor aphasia. Among the typical hypertensive putaminal hemorrhage diagnosed on CT scan, it is stressed that there may be a possibility of ruptured aneurysm situated on the peripheral middle cerebral artery."

Results of computerized tomography (CT) scans of the head were normal, but on examination of the cerebrospinal fluid xanthochromia was found. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the cervical spine revealed a retroclival hematoma. Three cerebral angiographic studies did not reveal the source of the hemorrhage and a repeated MR image demonstrated resolution of the hematoma. The patient made an uneventful recovery.

Eighteen patients with a low likelihood of cerebrovascular disease (control group) and 40 patients with suspected cerebrovascular disease were imaged with a FISP (fast imaging with steady precession) sequence (repetition time of 50 msec, echo time of 15 msec, velocity compensation in the read and section-select directions with acceleration compensation in the read direction, 15 degrees anisotropic volume, and a 1.25-mm partition thickness). Ninety-four percent of images in the control group and 72% of images in the group with cerebrovascular disease were considered useful for diagnosis. This technique can provide accurate images of intracranial circulation and can be performed in conjunction with two-dimensional spin-echo or gradient-echo imaging. It was most useful in the evaluation of patent intracranial aneurysms, vessel displacement, and large-vessel occlusive disease. Disadvantages included limited field of view, persistent signal voids, limited spatial resolution, and inadequate depiction of lesions with slow flow."
CD009372,0,15580489,0,MR angiography of the intracranial vessels: technical aspects and clinical applications.,"Evaluation of the intracranial circulation provides valuable information in the diagnosis and prognosis of various intracranial abnormalities and may influence patient management. Technical advances in magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) have improved the accuracy of this technique in various clinical situations, such as aneurysms, arterial and venous steno-occlusive diseases, vascular malformations, inflammatory arterial diseases, preoperative assessment of the patency of dural sinuses, and congenital vascular abnormalities. In many centers, MRA has replaced conventional digital subtraction angiography in screening for intracranial vascular disease, because of its non-invasive and non-ionizing character. Several MRA techniques have been developed for the imaging of the intracranial vascular system, such as time-of-flight MRA (TOF MRA), phase-contrast MRA (PC MRA), and more recently contrast-enhanced MRA (CE MRA). In the evaluation of steno-occlusive disease, the three-dimensional (3D) TOF-MRA technique is recommended for arterial evaluation, and the 2D TOF or 2D PC-MRA technique for venous evaluation. For the evaluation of aneurysms and arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), we recommend the 3D CE-MRA technique, especially dynamic sequences in case of AVM. In this review, the technical aspects, limitations, and optimization of these MRA techniques will be discussed together with their indications in intracranial disease."

Contraindications to thrombolysis include NCCT hemorrhage (absolute) and significant parenchymal hypodensity (relative). The sensitivity of NCCT for early (<6 h) stroke detection, higher than that of conventional magnetic resonance imaging, is improved further by using nonstandard window and level review settings. CTA/CTP is fast and convenient, adding approximately 10 min to the NCCT examination. CTA/CTP's accuracy in diagnosing ischemia and localizing thrombus to proximal or distal intracranial vessels far exceeds that of clinical examination (including National Institutes of Health stroke scale use), facilitating triage of appropriate candidates to intra-arterial thrombolysis. The size of the ischemic CTP hypodensity (proportional to reduced cerebral blood volume) predicts final infarct volume and clinical outcome; its location can guide the decision to perform intra-arterial thrombolysis, intravenous thrombolysis, or other treatment."
CD009372,0,8657884,0,[Magnetic resonance angiography of intracranial aneurysms after subarachnoid hemorrhage].,"Magnetic resonance angiography is now commercially available for a variety of scanners and is being increasingly applied in the diagnosis of cerebrovascular disorders. Considering the clinical consequences, especially in intracranial aneurysms, studies to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the method are essential. Here we report our experience with a 3D-FISH time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography protocol in 52 patients who have suffered an acute subarachnoid hemorrhage. In 26 of the 52 patients, conventional angiography identified 31 aneurysms (3-20 mm) that were confirmed during surgery or autopsy. Magnetic resonance angiography correctly identified 28 of the 31 aneurysms (sensitivity 90.3%) and missed one ruptured (3 mm) and two incidental aneurysms (3 mm) in patients with multiple aneurysms. The sensitivity for a ruptured aneurysm was 96%. The 26 patients who suffered subarachnoid hemorrhage without evidence of an intracranial aneurysm on repeated angiography served as a control group. Magnetic resonance angiography revealed no false-positive findings, resulting in a specificity of 100%. In correlation with the literature, we conclude that magnetic resonance angiography is not sensitive enough for the management of acute subarachnoid hemorrhage. However, the method provides important complementary information for definition of the bleeding site in patients with multiple aneurysms. In addition, the calculation of projections not possible with conventional angiography can aid surgical planning. Since only very small aneurysms were missed by magnetic resonance angiography, the sensitivity seems appropriate to screen asymptomatic patients who are at risk for intracranial aneurysms."

CT scan showed marked subarachnoid hemorrhage, left temporal intracerebral hematoma and oval mass which was remarkably enhanced in the left Sylvian fissure. First left carotid angiogram demonstrated a giant aneurysm of the middle cerebral artery which was measured 4.5 cm in maximum diameter. Second left carotid angiogram demonstrated an extravasation of contrast medium around the aneurysm. The patient immediately underwent CT scan, which showed enlargement of intracerebral hematoma and intraventricular high density area as added lesion. By regulation of window level, the presence of contrast medium due to intra-angiographic rupture of the aneurysm was confirmed. The patient expired fifteen hours after admission. At autopsy, the thrombus in the aneurysmal sac was hardly present and the wall of the sac was made mainly of collagen fibers. From the following two points this case was very interesting. However this aneurysm was very large, the thrombus in the aneurysmal sac was hardly present. Extravasation of contrast medium was clearly demonstrated during cerebral angiography with confirmation by computed tomography in the giant aneurysm."
CD009372,0,11176220,0,Imaging in cerebrovascular disease.,"Various functional imaging modalities can be applied in acute ischaemic stroke to identify functionally impaired, but morphologically preserved tissue (i.e. the penumbra), and to distinguish it from irreversibly damaged tissue. Flow thresholds for irreversible tissue destruction resulting in functional impairment, as determined by positron emission tomography, perfusion and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, single-photon computed tomography and xenon computed tomography, were comparable and ranged between 5 and 12 ml/100 g per min for the lower and 14 and 22 ml/100 g per min for the upper limit of penumbra. These imaging modalities help to select patients for thrombolytic therapy and provide evidence for the effect of this treatment on critically perfused tissue. They can also serve as surrogate markers in the evaluation of therapeutic efficacy. Further progress in interventional neuroradiology has been achieved with intra-arterial thrombolysis, which has become a treatment option beyond the 3-h therapeutic window in acute ischaemic stroke. Angioplasty and stenting of stenosis of arteries that supply the brain with blood have reached a point in their development at which a randomized trial to compare these treatments with vascular surgery is warranted."

In connection with this, an interesting angiographic finding was reported. A 65-year-old man suffered from sudden disturbance of consciousness and left hemiparesis. Computed tomography (CT) scan revealed typical subarachnoid hemorrhage localized in the right Sylvian fissure. Next day, a cerebral angiography was performed, but no aneurysm was detected. A second angiography was performed 21 days after the onset, and it revealed a saccular right internal carotid-posterior communicating artery (IC-PC) aneurysm. An operation for the IC-PC aneurysm was performed by conventional pterional approach. However, intraoperative findings were unexpected. The collapsed ruptured true IC-PC aneurysm was found at the orifice of the larger bleb, and the ruptured point was in the neck of the true aneurysm. Clipping of the aneurysm was performed successfully. The patient was discharged on foot. The aneurysm detected by the second angiography was not a true one but a bleb formation. Continuous hemodynamic stress on the rupture point may induce the formation of such an aneurysm-like bleb. It should be kept in mind that an aneurysm found in the chronic period might be an aneurysm-like bleb."

A brain CT scan revealed a small cerebellar haemorrhage located in the right vermis. Brain MR angiography revealed left persistent primitive trigeminal artery (PPTA) and basilar artery (BA) dysplasia proximal to the shunting PPTA without arteriovenous malformation (AVM) or aneurysm. We speculate that BA dysplasia due to the PPTA, along with poorly controlled hypertension resulted in overload of the superior cerebellar artery blood vessels through the PPTA, leading to a haemorrhage in the right vermis. BA dysplasia and a PPTA without an obvious AVM or aneurysm possibly leading to cerebellar haemorrhage is rare. PPTA is a relatively common vascular anomaly; hence, we must consider it in the differential diagnosis for brain haemorrhages that may be caused by the specific haemodynamic consequences of PPTA."

In 65% of the patients, the digital subtraction angiogram was diagnostic, but the overall quality was inferior to conventional selective angiography. In 22%, the digital subtraction angiogram provided diagnostic information, but there was a significant chance of misinterpreting the results of the study. In 13% of cases, the subtraction angiogram was not diagnostic. As now developed, digital subtraction angiography can replace conventional cerebral angiography for preoperative evaluation of the juxtasellar carotid artery prior to transphenoidal surgery because the large intracerebral vessels are consistently well visualized with digital subtraction. The dural sinuses are better visualized with digital subtraction than with conventional angiography because with digital subtraction all the vessels of the brain are opacified, whereas with conventional angiography, there is a mixture of opacified and unopacified blood in the sinuses. Combined with computed tomography, digital subtraction angiography can replace conventional angiography for determining the preoperative extent and vascularity of tumors. It can be used for postoperative evaluation of aneurysms, arteriovenous malformations, extracranial to intracranial bypasses, and after the embolization of vascular lesions."

Cerebral angiograms revealed narrowed cortical vein with irregular wall in the right parietal region, where delayed local blood flow into the deep cerebral veins through collateral vessels was noted. The diagnosis was subcortical hemorrhage due to thrombosis of cortical vein. Her symptoms and brain edema were progressive. To reduce intracranial pressure, evacuation of the hematoma was performed. The hematoma which existed 1cm under the right parietal cortex was about 20g in weight. She remarkably improved soon after operation. Frequency of sinovenous thrombosis has been reported to be about 10% of all cerebral ischemic diseases, however, localized venous thrombosis is rare among them.

Contribution of computerized tomography].,"Thirty-two traumatic subdural haematomas were operated between 1984 and 1990. In 16 cases (50%), we encountered, after removal of the heamorrhage, a bleeding from a cortical artery at the lateral sulcus (middle cerebral artery). Four mechanisms of arterial bleeding have been reported: a) rupture of a cortico-dural bridging artery, b) ""fire-hose"" rupture, c) rupture at the level of an arachnoid attachment and d) rupture at the level of a dural adhesion. The characteristic finding of such haematomas on computerized tomography (CT-scan) was an indentation towards the lateral sulcus. This was called the ""double brackets sign"". In seventy-nine percent of subdural haematomas of arterial origin, the ""double brackets sign"" was demonstrated on CT-scan on at least two slices (9 mm). In 9% of subdural haematomas of non-arterial origin, this sign was absent or present in only one CT image. The characteristic ""double brackets sign"", when present on 3 or 4 CT-scan images, seems to have a very high specificity for an arterial origin of the haematoma."

Four patients presented with intracerebral haematoma and 3 patients had associated cavernous angioma, respectively. Patients with intracerebral haematoma had signs and symptoms due to the localization of the haematoma. The other patients presented with headache, seizures, vertigo, ataxia and mental disturbances. Pre-operative diagnosis was based on computerized tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and cerebral angiography. In 9 surgical cases it was confirmed by histopathological examination of operative specimens. After establishing the type, size and location of the lesion decision for operative treatment was made in nine cases, in four of them because of the presence of an intracerebral haematoma and in 5 of them due to severe disability. Eight of these 9 patients recovered completely and one improved. No severe cerebral oedema was encountered after converging medullary veins were excised and main draining veins partially coagulated. In this small series we encountered an unexpectedly large percentage of venous angiomas causing intracerebral haemorrhage which are commonly considered more benign than other vascular malformations. After reviewing previously reported cases of venous angiomas causing intracerebral haemorrhage and severe neurological deficit we think that the term ""benign"" is worth reconsidering. We propose a thorough examination of each case of venous angioma and the operative treatment when appropriate taking into account patients state and location of angioma."

The authors report two cases of bilateral chronic subdural hematomas, in which CT scans on admission were both misdiagnosed as delayed subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The first case was a 43-year-old woman who suffered from a sudden onset of headache and nausea. She had no past history of head injury. CT scans on admission did not clearly reveal the Sylvian fissures and the mesencephalic cistern, without any mass effects. A lumbar puncture demonstrated xanthochromic cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which was considered to be responsible for her headache. Cerebral angiography performed on day 4 failed to demonstrate any cerebral vascular disorders. Follow-up CT scans on day 7 demonstrated a high density lesion in the left subdural space. Magnetic resonance images (MRIs) confirmed a diagnosis of bilateral chronic subdural hematomas. Removal of the hematomas cleared all signs and symptoms smoothly. The second case was a 44-year-old man who was referred from another hospital because of xanthochromic CSF found by lumbar puncture. He began to suffer headache and be subject to vomiting 6 weeks earlier and these symptoms were still present on the day of admission. CT scans did not clearly show the cerebral cisterns without mass effects. Because the second lumbar puncture showed xanthochromic CSF again, SAH from aneurysm was suspected. However, emergency cerebral angiography failed to demonstrate cerebral aneurysms. MRI performed two days later demonstrated bilateral chronic subdural hematomas. Following surgery, the patient improved immediately and was discharged from hospital without any complications. In both cases, a retrospective study of the angiograms revealed the evidence of bilateral avascular areas over the convexities in the venous phase. The reason why these subdural hematomas were missed at the time of angiography was due to too much attention being paid to the arterial phase in an effort aimed only at identifying cerebral aneurysms. There are no reports of chronic subdural hematoma which demonstrated sudden onset of headache associated with xanthochromic CSF."
CD009372,0,3131146,0,Clinical criteria for the diagnosis of vascular dementia.,"The clinical diagnosis of dementia includes medical history, neurological examination, psychiatric interview and dementia scale. The identification of conditions producing dementia can only be achieved by adding to the clinical information the data gathered from ancillary investigations. The usual ancillary diagnostic investigations (biochemical tests, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), EEG, CT, MRI, angiography) can rather easily identify brain disorders due to tumors, vascular malformations, hematomas, infections, toxins and drugs, deficiency diseases, normal-pressure hydrocephalus, metabolic and endocrine derangements. The differential diagnosis between degenerative and vascular dementia needs laboratory tests such as CSF, EEG, Somatosensory Evoked Potentials, CT (which constitutes a major role in a modified ischemic score) and MRI. The three final diagnostic labels are possible, probable and definite vascular dementia, which include clinical features and laboratory investigations concurrently confirming the diagnosis. If ancillary investigations fail to show multiple infarct lesions or if mixed forms are suspected an unequivocal diagnosis can be made only on histopathological evidence."

At age 56 the patient was admitted with a subarachnoid hemorrhage and, during cerebral angiography, a thoracic aortic aneurysm was detected. Four years later the patient was referred to the outpatient hypertension clinic due to uncontrolled hypertension and cardiac failure. The echocardiogram disclosed left ventricular hypertrophy and aggressive treatment failed to control her hypertension. At age 61, due to lower limb muscular fatigue, arterial Doppler ultrasound was performed that revealed symmetrically decreased ankle/brachial pressure index, suggesting aortic stenosis. MRI angiography enabled a diagnosis of AC with a large poststenotic dilation which had been interpreted as an aortic aneurysm in successive CT scans.

We compared an MRI screening strategy with a nonscreening strategy. The screening strategy specified MRI screening and then neurosurgical management of detected aneurysms. The nonscreening strategy specified cerebrovascular care only in the event of subarachnoid hemorrhage. The decision tree incorporated estimates derived from the clinical literature for the prevalence of asymptomatic aneurysms in patients with ADPKD (15%), the annual incidence of aneurysmal rupture (1.6%), the morbidity and mortality rates associated with subarachnoid hemorrhage (70 and 56%, respectively), the risk of transfemoral arteriography (0.2%), the sensitivity and specificity of MRI, the morbidity and mortality rates associated with surgical treatment of an unruptured aneurysm (4.1 and 1.0%, respectively), and the life expectancy of patients with ADPKD. The model predicted that the screening strategy would provide 1.0 additional year of life without neurological disability to a 20-year-old patient with ADPKD. A sensitivity analysis showed that the model was most sensitive to estimates of the prevalence of aneurysms in ADPKD, the annual incidence of rupture, and the morbidity and mortality rates associated with rupture. A financial analysis showed that a screening strategy is likely to cost less than a nonscreening strategy. The model predicts that an MRI screening strategy would increase the life expectancy of young patients with ADPKD and reduce the financial impact on society of ADPKD."
CD009372,0,16832640,0,A fatal case of postpartum cerebral angiopathy with literature review.,"Postpartum cerebral angiopathy (PCA) is a rare and pathophysiologically ill-characterized cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome, occurring within 30 days of a usually uncomplicated pregnancy and delivery. Its onset has been associated with the use of vasoactive medications, particularly ergot alkaloids. Other cases have occurred in the absence of these medications, prompting conjecture into possible overlap between PCA and other conditions known to cause cerebral vasoconstriction, including primary angiitis of the central nervous system and postpartum eclampsia. The vast majority of cases follow a relatively benign course; however, a fatal case has been reported. Histopathologic findings in PCA, so far limited to the fatal case and two more recent biopsies, have been nonspecific."
CD009372,0,17163342,0,Clinical utility of multislice computed tomographic angiography for detection of cerebral vasospasm in acute subarachnoid hemorrhage.,"Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) has been used as the standard method for detecting cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Multislice computed tomographic angiography (CTA) is a relatively recent method used for evaluating the vasculature of the intracranial arteries. The purpose of this study was to compare multislice CTA and DSA for the detection and quantification of cerebral vasospasm after SAH, and to analyze the usefulness of multislice CTA. Eight patients with SAH underwent initial CTA with DSA within 72 hours after the onset of symptoms and follow-up multislice CTA and DSA 8 to 48 days after SAH. Five arterial locations were established in the A1 and A2 segments of the anterior cerebral artery, the M1 and M2 segments of the middle cerebral artery and the posterior cerebral artery (PCA) on both multislice CTA and DSA images. Vasospasm was classified as none, mild (up to 30% reduction in luminal diameter), moderate (31-60% reduction), and marked (at least 60% reduction) using the scale of Schneck and Kricheff. The multislice CT system used the following parameters: 1.25 mm collimation and 3.75 pitch with a 4-channel system. The degree of vasospasm revealed by the multislice CTA was significantly correlated with the degree of vasospasm revealed by DSA. In general, most discrepancies between CTA and DSA were in the detection of mild and moderate vasospasm. We found that the consistency between multislice CTA and DSA was greater for mild (100%, n=3) or moderate (100%, n=3) vasospasm than none (n=1) or marked vasospasm (n=1). However, it was unclear whether multislice CTA was more specific for a proximal location (A1, M1, PCA) or distal location (A2, M2) for evaluation of cerebral arteries. Multislice CTA can detect angiographic vasospasm after SAH with an accuracy similar to that of DSA. Multislice CTA is highly sensitive, specific and accurate in detecting mild and moderate cerebral vasospasm. It is less accurate for detecting no vasospasm and marked vasospasm. Therefore, the authors propose that multislice CTA be considered as a useful tool for the detection and management of intracranial vasospasm after SAH."

CD009372,0,12075669,0,White and black blood volumetric angiographic filtering: ellipsoidal scale-space approach.,"Prefiltering is a critical step in three-dimensional (3-D) segmentation of the blood vessel and its display (see the recent book by Suri et al.). This paper presents a scale-space approach for filtering the white blood and black blood angiographic volumes and its implementation issues. The raw MR angiographic volume is first converted to isotropic volume followed by 3-D higher order separable Gaussian derivative convolution with known scales to generate edge volume. The edge volume is then run by the directional processor at each voxel where the eigenvalues of the 3-D ellipsoid are computed. The vessel score per voxel is then estimated based on these three eigenvalues which suppress the nonvasculature and background structures yielding the filtered volume. The filtered volume is ray-cast to generate the maximum intensity projection images for display. The performance of the system is evaluated by computing the mean, variance, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) images. The system is run over 20 patient studies from different areas of the body such as the brain, abdomen, kidney, knee, and ankle. The computer program takes around 150 s of processing time per study for a data size of 512 x 512 x 194, which includes the complete performance evaluation. We also compare our strategy with the recently published MR filtering algorithms by Alexander et al. and Sun et al."

CD009372,0,22005694,0,Bleeding source identification and treatment in brain arteriovenous malformations.,"Arteriovenous malformation (AVM) patients who initially present with intracerebral haemorrhage may have an identifiable source of bleeding on angiogram, which can be a treatment target. Previous work suggests that the re-bleed rate may be lowered if a weak area is eliminated.A retrospective cohort study was conducted on patients who presented over a six-year period with a bled AVM. Cases were reviewed looking for the source of the hemorrhage by correlating haematoma location on CT or MRI and any angio-architectural weakness seen on digital subtraction angiography (DSA). Neuroendovascular notes were reviewed to identify the treatment targets. One hundred patients presented with a brain AVM with a 1.7:1 male: female ratio, 41 patients had an initial presentation of hemorrhage. The source of hemorrhage was identified in 18 subjects with 11 intranidal false aneurysms, five flow-related aneurysms, two associated aneurysms and one venous pouch. The location of haemorrhage on the presenting scan significantly correlated with the identified bleeding source using Chi-square analysis (P-value 0.039). Partial targeted embolization was used successfully in 90% with a 9% related technical complication rate not resulting in long-term morbidity or mortality. The mean follow-up period was 34 months with an annual hemorrhage rate of 0.7%. In just under half the patients with AVM bleeding a source of haemorrhage can be identified on DSA and in most cases this will be an intranidal false aneurysm. Flow-related and associated aneurysms in patients with brain AVM can cause haemorrhage and these patients are more likely to have SAH than intracerebral haemorrhage.These weak points are a good target for partial endovascular treatment, are usually accessible and may reduce the higher haemorrhage rate expected over the next two years."
CD009372,0,3340283,0,Migraine stroke.,"Because the cause of stroke during migraine is not known, we studied 22 (17 females, 5 males; mean age, 32.7 years) classic migraine sufferers who had an ischemic stroke during an attack of migraine, with CT, Doppler ultrasound, cerebral angiography, and two-dimensional echocardiography. We found no cardiac or arterial lesion in 91% of the patients, as compared with 9% of age- and sex-matched migraineurs with stroke remote from a migraine attack and 18% of age- and sex-matched nonmigraineurs with stroke (p less than 0.00001). Mitral valve prolapse, arterial dissection, and vasospasm were not significant causes of stroke during migraine. These patients had longer previous attacks of migraine and their infarct was more frequently in the territory involved during the attacks than the controls, supporting the hypothesis that a prolongation of the migrainous process beyond usual limits may explain most migraine strokes."
CD009372,0,1198631,0,The value of brain scanning in the management of strokes.,"The usefulness of brain scanning in the diagnosis and management of strokes was evaluated in 313 serial cases. Of 38 patients with transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), only one had a positive test. The optimal time for scanning completed strokes was between seven and 14 days after onset. The pattern of uptake was characteristic of a vascular lesion in 76.8%. When uptake was indistinguishable from tumor, follow-up scans were useful. Patients with negative scans in the second week have a significantly better prognosis than the ones with a positive study. Cerebral angiography and brain scan correlated well in 56 patients who had both tests performed. The postmortem findings in 12 cases again emphasize the importance of the correct timing of the study, and the fact that a brain scan does not usually demonstrate lesions smaller than 2 cm in diameter. It is concluded that the brain scan represents a useful tool in the diagnosis of strokes and helps in predicting the degree of recovery following a vascular insult."

The aim was to correlate clinical and radiologic findings and comparing them with the classical descriptions of brain stem syndromes. Twenty one consecutive patients were admitted at the Hospital de Base do Distrito Federal. The diagnosis and the follow up were carried out by neurological examination and neuroradiologic images: CT (100%), angiography (24%, 5) and MRI (5%, 1). Hypertension and old age were the most important risk factors and hemorrhage at pons with extension to midbrain was the most frequent finding. Coma at admission was associated to a poor outcome. The outcome was defined by the Glasgow Outcome Scale: 28% rated 5, 24% rated 4, 5% rated 3, 28% rated 2 and 14% rated 1. Our results show that the clinical presentation of ischemic strokes and hemorrhages of the brain stem very frequently follow a mixed pattern, which do not conciliate with the classical of these syndromes."

CD009372,0,9638675,0,Cerebellar arteriovenous malformations in children.,"We review the presentation, imaging findings and outcome in 18 children with cerebellar arteriovenous malformations (AVM). This group is of particular interest because of the reported poor outcome despite modern imaging and neurosurgical techniques. All children had CT and 15 underwent catheter angiography at presentation. Several of the children in the latter part of the study had MRI. Of the 18 children, 17 presented with a ruptured AVM producing intracranial haemorrhage. The remaining child presented with temporal lobe epilepsy and was shown to have temporal, vermian and cerebellar hemisphere AVM. This child had other stigmata of Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome. Three other children had pre-existing abnormalities of possible relevance. One had a vascular malformation of the cheek and mandible, one a documented chromosomal abnormality and another a midline cleft upper lip and palate. Six of the 17 children with a ruptured cerebellar AVM died within 7 days of the ictus. Vascular pathology other than an AVM was found in 10 of the 14 children with a ruptured cerebellar AVM who had angiography: 4 intranidal aneurysms, 5 venous aneurysms and 2 cases of venous outflow obstruction (one child having both an aneurysm and obstruction). The severity of clinical presentation was directly related to the size of the acute haematoma, which was a reasonable predictor of outcome."
CD009372,0,12710259,0,[Significance of magnetic resonance imaging in the diagnosis and surgical treatment in patients with intracranial arterial aneurysmal ruptures].,"In 123 patients with arterial aneurysms, brain MRI was performed in the routine and vascular modes. Ninety-five patients were hospitalized. Of them, 73 patients were operated on. Among the patients operated on, the diagnosis was verified and it corresponded to preoperative MRI diagnosis. In a group of patients who had died without being operated on, the diagnosis was verified at autopsy. In 11 cases, the diagnosis should be clarified by direct cerebral angiography. Analyzing MRI criteria that may be used to diagnose an aneurysm has indicated that the detection rate of some aneurysmal elements is not equal. The greatest problems arise in identifying the aneurysmal neck and carrying vessel, particularly in the presence of intracerebral hematoma that surrounds the aneurysm. The neck of aneurysm and its carrying artery could be visualized in 63 and 80% of cases, respectively. Nevertheless, aneurysmal clipping was successfully performed in 64 cases as shown by only MRI data. Aneurysmal MRI criteria were systematized, MRI signs being classified into direct and indirect and their rates presented. According to MRI, including MR angiography, the accuracy of diagnosis ranged from 61 to 88%. If there are no direct MRI signs of aneurysm, its preoperative diagnosis should be clarified by traditional cerebral serial angiography."

Following parameters of REG curve have been analysed: sphygmic amplitude, sphygmic interrelations between two homologous brain regions; sphygmic speed, rise time, slope of REG curve, dicrotic incisure, random oscillations of catacrotic phase. A reduction in sphygmic speed has been observed in 70 % of cases, with changes in slope of REG curve in 90 % and reduction or disappearance of catacrotic dicrotism in 93.5 % and progressively less frequent changes in the remaining REG parameters. The obtained data have been submitted to statistical analysis. Significant associations have been observed between two or more pathological REG parameters and between the pathology of REG curve as a whole and the different invasive methods employed for assessing the cerebrovascular insufficiency such as CT, CBF studies and angiographic data. Not significant correlations between the focal REG pathology, and the focal changes of REG or of the invasive methods have been found.

CD009372,0,3060062,0,[Treatment of acute cerebrovascular disorders].,"Recent advances in technology have improved stroke diagnosis, reduced the risks and increased the frequency of studies of stroke mechanism. Computer-assisted stroke data bank projects have provided new insights into the frequencies of stroke subtypes and the risks for progression and recurrence. A high frequency of strokes due to infarction remain unexplained despite thorough laboratory investigation. These infarcts of undetermined cause suffer recurrence rates almost as high as cardiogenic embolism, forcing a therapeutic decision even in the absence of a demonstrated cause. Stroke from atherosclerosis is far less common than formerly believed but carries the highest risk of worsening and early recurrence, prompting early treatment to attempt to avoid progression. Duplex and transcranial doppler methods of imaging blood vessels and insonating flow have now made it possible non-invasively to follow the course of atheromatous stenosis, embolism and recanalization, development of collateral flow, and vasospasm in ruptured aneurysms and arteriovenous malformations. Extracranial atheromatous disease may progress rapidly from mild to severe stenosis, stabilize at any point; intracranial collateral is not predicted by the degree of extracranial stenosis. Recanalization of cerebral embolism occurs early. Vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage is common and often severe. Where available, magnetic resonance imaging is preferred to CT scanning for the diagnosis of every form of stroke including hemorrhage."

Angiography revealed giant AVMs located at the left basal ganglia in both patients. Large frontotemporal craniotomies were performed following staged embolization of the feeding arteries. Through an extended transsylvian approach, the lesions were totally excised with confirmation using intraoperative digital subtraction angiography. The patients showed a transient postoperative worsening of symptoms, but recovered to their preoperative status at discharge. Motor functions of the right upper and lower extremities were graded 4/5 in both patients. These cases demonstrate that combined use of preoperative embolization and intraoperative angiography allows some giant deep AVMs to be resected with encouraging results."

Laboratory examinations on admission showed proteinuria, mild anemia, and positive antinuclear and anti-Sm antibodies. No abnormal findings except high pressure of 350 mmH2O were observed in his cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Fundoscopic examinations showed marked bilateral papilledema and retinal bleeding. Brain CT, MRI and angiography revealed diffuse brain edema without space occupying lesion and cerebrovascular diseases. Because there were no diseases such as endocrinological disorders, severe anemia, and no history of the administration of drugs which might cause intracranial hypertension, the diagnosis of BIH was made.

CD009372,0,9340684,0,[Indications for contrast medium administration in MR-angiography of cerebral blood vessels].,"Time-of-flight MR-angiography of large volumes is limited by the occurrence of saturation effects, which lead to low signal in both veins and arteries. Alternatively to a number of other MRA-techniques, intravenous application of paramagnetic contrast media in combination with 3D-pulse sequences with or without flow refocussing allows the depiction of slow vessels in large volumes without technical extra expenses. The main intracranial indication is anatomical 3D-imaging of normal and dysplastic cerebral veins with high spatial resolution, and the additional depiction of the venous drainage in AVMs, when unenhanced MRA shows only the arteriel supply and the nidus. In large cerebral aneurysms, bridging veins and venous sinuses, partial thromboses can easily be differentiated from slow flow. Contrast-enhancing tumors can be depicted together with normal or displaced vessels. Improvements of arterial signal due to contrast media with currently used routine MRA techniques are clinically not significant. Signal loss due to spin dephasing in vessels with complex flow is not influences by contrast media. Results of contrast-enhanced MRA are determined by the timing of injection. Since arteries and veins are both imaged with high signal intensity, improvements of postprocessing procedures for secondary vessel segmentation are necessary."

CD009372,0,11552375,0,[The vascular patient--diagnosis and minimally invasive therapy. Which technique for what illness?].,"The non-invasive imaging modalities, color coded duplex sonography (CCDS), magnetic resonance tomography (MRT), and computed tomography (CT), have pushed conventional angiography out of most diagnostic fields. The experienced user will achieve fast, reliable answers with CCDS in dedicated clinical settings. MRT as well as CT are concurring imaging modalities for the most appropriate diagnostic answer. Not only pure image quality, but also patient management, and availability play a major role. Catheter based angiography will in the future still play a role in mesenteric ischemia (non occlusive disease) and for imaging of very small vessel pathology, e.g. on panarteritis nodosa. At the moment, peripheral leg run-offs are still best performed with conventional angiography, nevertheless, MR as well as CT seem to have the ability to perform diagnostic procedures. Ongoing studies will allow a solid judgement in the near future. The true value of catheter angiography is in the direct assessment, planning, and performance of interventional procedures, e.g. catheter based obliteration or revascularization. Implantation of stent devices and a whole range of different mechanical and pharmacological revascularization procedures have improved the interventional management of vascular stenoses and occlusions. The interventional radiologist is treating physician in the classical sense in this setting. Acute bleeding episodes, e.g. in the brain, thorax, abdomen, or pelvis, are best imaged with computed tomography. Conventional angiography still plays a major diagnostic and therapeutic role in bleeding into preformed cavities, such as the bile ducts or the intestine. In this setting, all available information including CT scans should be valued. For complex therapeutic regimens in oncology or in pure palliative situations, angiographic diagnosis followed by embolization and/or ablation therapy is established."
CD009372,0,3120528,0,Nontraumatic lobar intracerebral hemorrhage: CT/angiographic correlation.,"Cerebral angiography in patients with nontraumatic lobar intracerebral hemorrhage may or may not uncover the underlying cause of the disorder. The CT and cerebral angiographic studies of 67 consecutive patients with nontraumatic lobar intracerebral hemorrhage were reviewed to assess the relationship between CT pattern and location of hemorrhage and the frequency of diagnostic angiographic findings. Origins of these hematomas were also determined and correlated with radiographic findings. CT revealed 26 temporal, 18 frontal, 17 parietal, three occipital, and three multiple lobar hematomas. Thirty-three patients had ""pure"" lobar hematomas, 12 had coexistent intraventricular hemorrhage, 12 had associated subarachnoid hemorrhage, and 10 had both intraventricular and subarachnoid hemorrhage accompanying their lobar hematomas. Angiographic findings were diagnostic in 29 cases (43%). In the presence of accompanying subarachnoid hemorrhage, angiographic findings were diagnostic in 17 (77%) of 22 patients; in its absence, angiography was diagnostic in 12 (27%) of the remaining 45 patients. Diagnostic angiograms were also more frequent in the presence of a frontal or temporal lobar hematoma than with a parietal or occipital lobar hematoma. While CT patterns do influence the frequency of diagnostic angiographic findings, cerebral angiography is recommended in all patients with otherwise unexplained nontraumatic lobar intracerebral hemorrhage."

CD009372,0,2615899,0,[Barbiturate therapy in traumatic cerebral vascular disease: report of two cases].,"We report two cases of traumatic cerebral vascular disease which were treated successfully with barbiturate. The first case sustained blunt trauma to the bilateral vertebral arteries, resulting in complete occlusion of both arteries. After ligation of the injured vertebral arteries, multiple cerebral infarction appeared. Cerebral angiography revealed dissection and stenosis of the bilateral internal carotid arteries. We treated this case with barbiturate (Thiamylal) in combination with administration of heparin. The second case sustained cerebral contusion and traumatic subarachnoidal hemorrhage as a result of a motor cycle accident. This patient deteriorated and cerebral angiography showed diffuse cerebral arterial vasospasms. When this was treated with induced hypertension, he developed recurrent subarachnoid hemorrhage. In order to protect the brain from ischemia without elevating blood pressure, we employed barbiturate therapy and the patient recovered without major neurological deficit. The condition of severe head injury with cerebral ischemia is complicated. Therefore it has been hard for neurosurgeons to cure the patient with this condition. But we treated it with barbiturate successfully. Barbiturate therapy in severe head injury with cerebral ischemia may decrease the mortality in that group of patients considered difficult to treat with the usual therapeutic modalities."

Here, we compared combined territorial ASL (TASL) and MR angiography (MRA) against DSA in the assessment of collateral circulation."
CD009372,0,10745267,0,MR angiographic diagnosis of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis following allogeneic bone marrow transplantation.,"Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation is frequently associated with neurological complications, particularly intracerebral bleeds and infections. Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis has only rarely been reported following allogeneic transplants. We report three cases of cortical venous thrombosis following allografting for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Two patients received marrow from HLA-identical siblings and one from an unrelated donor. Two of the patients presented with grand mal seizures and one presented with a headache. No neurological abnormalities were found upon clinical examination and lumbar puncture was normal in all three cases. In two of the patients computed tomography (CT) of the brain was normal and in the third showed non-specific abnormalities. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with MR angiography (MRA) demonstrated cerebral venous sinus thrombosis in all three patients. In conclusion, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis when neurological symptoms occur following allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. We therefore advocate the use of MRA for unexplained neurological symptoms post-allograft since without it cerebral venous sinus thrombosis may easily be missed."
CD009372,0,8161486,0,Selected indications for and applications of magnetic resonance angiography in children.,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy and practicality of magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) in evaluating pediatric cerebrovascular disorders. A retrospective evaluation was performed of MR angiograms in 20 pediatric patients with cerebrovascular pathology. When appropriate, comparisons were made with duplex ultrasonography or conventional catheter angiography. MRA accurately assessed the patency of carotid reanastomoses in 8 babies who had previously undergone extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). In 6 patients with moyamoya syndrome, MRA accurately evaluated stenotic intracranial carotid and circle of Willis arteries and progressive enlargement of the superficial temporal and middle cerebral arteries after revascularization procedures, and thus obviated the need for sequential angiograms. Thrombi and emboli were identified in 4 of 5 patients with symptoms and imaging evidence of an acute stroke. Two-dimensional time-of-flight MR venograms, acquired in both axial and coronal planes, were useful for preoperative venous mapping in a patient with an occipital encephalocele and detecting venoocclusive disease. MRA provided diagnostically useful information in a spectrum of pediatric cerebrovascular disorders. It can be used as the initial vascular imaging modality for patients with imaging evidence of acute cerebrovascular event, to evaluate progression of chronic vasoocclusive disease, to evaluate vessel patency following intracranial revascularization surgery, and for visualization of the venous circulation."

CD009372,0,15545944,0,[Emergency imaging of cerebrovascular accidents].,"Over the last 25 years, advances in neuroimaging have significantly changed the evaluation and management of acute stroke syndromes. In the seventies, computed tomography (CT) could differentiate between ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is nowadays the imaging modality of choice in the initial assessment of acute stroke. MRI images can better discriminate acute, subacute and chronic infarcts, differentiate venous from arterial infarcts, detect arterial dissection, stenosis or occlusion. Diffusion-weighted images are highly sensitive and specific to acute infarction and the combination with perfusion technique is suitable to define potentially reversible ischemia (area of cerebral ""mismatch"" which is thought to represent the so-called ischemic penumbra). This penumbra is a potential therapeutic target of valuable interest for the treating physician."

Signal intensity and blood-background contrast was measured in several regions of interest on conventional 3D TOF MR images, MTC images, and those with MTC and FS in seven volunteers. One patient each with an arteriovenous malformation, an aneurysm, and stenosis in the intracranial vascular system underwent the protocols with an echo time (TE) of 5 msec and then a TE of 8 msec. Use of the 5-msec-TE sequence with MTC and FS led to reduced problems associated with signal void in areas of fast flow in patients.

These cases represented 2.1% of intracerebral hemorrhage cases at Neurological Institute, Veterans General Hospital-Taipei, Taiwan. Cerebral angiography was performed on eight patients. Six patients were evaluated by an extensive neuropsychological battery. The most frequent symptoms of caudate hemorrhage were headache and/or vomiting, and decreased consciousness. Clinical features were similar to those of subarachnoid hemorrhage. Angiography showed characteristic moyamoya disease in one patient but did not show an aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation in any patient. The etiology in most patients was hypertension. Neuropsychological assessments showed significant impairment in tasks of short-term and long-term memory and in verbal fluency as well as trends of impairment of orientation rather than of controls.

CD009372,0,8208357,0,Antiphospholipid antibodies in cerebrovascular ischemia and stroke in childhood.,"We report on eight children who suffered from cerebrovascular ischemia or stroke at the age of 2 or up to 11 years. Antiphospholipid antibodies (APLA) were detected in two cases during the ischemic event and in six cases during follow-up examinations (after six weeks or within a span of six years). In two patients multiple stenoses of basal cerebral arteries were found; one of them suffered from moyamoya syndrome. The acute hemiplegia in one patient was linked to an asymptomatic mycoplasmal infection and APLA. In three cases, one of the parents was also APLA-positive. Seven patients were treated with acetylsalicylic acid, and in four cases immunoglobulin infusions were given. Transient ischemic attacks subsided after the child with the moyamoya syndrome received immunoglobulins. No effect of medication could be established in the other children. The concept of the antiphospholipid syndrome is still evolving. As none of the common risk factors pertaining to strokes in adults apply to children, pediatric research may offer a suitable platform for specific investigations on the causal, pathogenetic role of APLA.

CD009372,0,1362250,1,Application of magnetic resonance angiography to neurosurgical practice: a critical review of 150 cases.,"The potential role of magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) in clinical neurosurgical practice was evaluated in 150 consecutive patients in an attempt to define clinical situations in which it aided in diagnosis, helped guide treatment options, and/or possibly eliminated the need for conventional catheter angiography. Among patients with nonvascular pathology (n = 42), MRA provided useful clinical information in 55% of cases, and could have effectively replaced catheter angiography in 76% of cases. In this group of patients, MRA provided excellent depiction of tumour and vessel relationships, and in conjunction with conventional imaging modalities reliably ruled out the question of tumour versus aneurysm whenever that question was raised. Among patients with vascular lesions (n = 108), MRA visualized the lesion in 18 of 20 (90%) aneurysms, 11 of 11 (100%) vascular malformations, 31 or 31 (100%) cases with known occlusive vascular disease, and reliably excluded occlusive vascular disease in 19 of 30 (63%) cases. The MRA potentially could have replaced conventional catheter angiography in less than 8% of cases with vascular pathology treated surgically, and in 76% of cases with vascular pathology treated medically or expectantly. Imaging time was relatively short, 10 to 20 minutes for intracranial vessels and 6.5 to 13 minutes for extracranial vessels. Shortcomings included the lack of spacial resolution required for surgical planning and the possible misleading information in the settings of low flow and partial thrombosis. It is concluded that currently available MRA modalities contribute useful information in a wide spectrum of neurosurgical clinical situations including screening and serial follow-up.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

CD009372,0,21402376,0,Cross-sectional imaging for diagnosis and clinical outcome prediction of acute basilar artery thrombosis.,"Basilar artery occlusion is a potentially fatal condition and imaging findings can be subtle. Prompt diagnosis is vital, as recognition may lead to therapeutic recanalization that may improve functional outcome and survival. Furthermore, cross-sectional imaging signs may help predict eventual outcome and, therefore, guide which patients should be subjected to aggressive treatment. Computed tomography (CT) signs include a hyperdense basilar artery that has a high specificity, accuracy, positive and negative predictive value. Evidence regarding the prognostic significance of the hyperdense basilar artery sign is conflicting. Early magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features include loss of flow void, seen as increased signal intensity within the basilar artery on T2-weigted images and identification of acute thrombus, seen as intermediate signal on T1-weighted images. MRI sequences are more sensitive for early detection of acute ischaemia or infarction, ideally with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). Both CT and MR angiography are sensitive for detection of acute thrombus, seen as a filling defect or occlusion. These are the non-invasive imaging techniques of choice to confirm diagnosis, with perhaps the speed and accessibility of CT angiography resulting in this technique being valuable in the acute setting. Several new scoring systems based on arterial segmentation rather than global volume assessment using CT angiography source images and DWI have shown early promise in the prediction of eventual clinical outcome in order to isolate those patients who may benefit from therapeutic recanalization."

A total of 47 consecutive patients with sickle cell disease (28 females, 19 males; age range 8 months to 29 years, mean age 9 years 6 months) were evaluated by transcranial color and duplex Doppler ultrasonography via transtemporal and occipital (2-MHz probe) as well as by transocular (5-MHz probe) approach. Eleven vessels (middle, posterior, anterior cerebral artery, vertebral artery, ophthalmic artery on each side and basilar artery) were analyzed in each patient. Following nine transcranial Doppler findings predictive for cerebrovascular disease, patients with one or more of those abnormal sonographic findings underwent MR imaging and MR angiography. In 8 patients with abnormal transcranial Doppler the MR angiography was normal. Thirty-one patients demonstrated normal results. In 15 of 16 patients with one or more abnormal Doppler findings (34% of all studied patients) MR imaging and MR angiography were performed. The MR angiography disclosed cerebrovascular stenosis in 7 patients (15% of all patients, 44% of those with pathological transcranial Doppler findings). In one of those patients MR imaging revealed silent peripheral ischemic infarction as well. Our findings indicate the usefulness of transcranial Doppler ultrasonography to reveal occult cerebrovascular lesions in neurologically asymptomatic patients with sickle cell disease. It should regularly be performed in all sickle cell patients in order to detect patients at risk for later stroke. Patients with homozygous disease and a high frequency of preceding sickle cell crises should be followed most closely."
CD009372,0,23124634,1,Emergency noninvasive angiography for acute intracerebral hemorrhage.,"Spontaneous ICH is a devastating condition and is associated with significant mortality in the acute phase due to ongoing hemorrhage and hematoma expansion. A growing body of evidence suggests that there may be considerable utility in performing noninvasive vascular imaging during the acute-to-early phase of ICH. CTA has become widely available and is sensitive and specific for detecting vascular causes of secondary ICH such as aneurysms, arteriovenous malformations, dural arteriovenous fistulas, intracranial dissections, and neoplasm. CT venography can also diagnose dural sinus thrombosis presenting as hemorrhagic infarction. Recent data from stroke populations demonstrate a relatively low risk to patients when contrast is administered in the absence of a known serum creatinine. Detection of acute contrast extravasation within the hematoma (""spot sign"") with CT angiography is predictive of subsequent hematoma expansion and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Risk stratification based on acute CTA can inform and expedite decision-making regarding intensive care unit admission, blood pressure control, correction of coagulopathy, and neurosurgical consultation. Noninvasive vascular imaging should be considered as an important component of the initial diagnostic work-up for patients presenting with acute ICH."

CD009372,0,11684714,0,ACP Best Practice No 166: CSF spectrophotometry in the diagnosis of subarachnoid haemorrhage.,"After subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH), cerebral angiography is usually performed to establish a site of bleeding, which may then be treated surgically to prevent a potentially catastrophic re-bleed. The investigation of choice in the diagnosis of SAH is computerised tomography (CT). However, because CT can miss some patients with SAH, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) spectrophotometry should be performed in those patients with negative or equivocal CT scans or those who have presented several days after the suspected bleed. Spectrophotometry should aim to detect the presence of both oxyhaemoglobin and bilirubin because either one or both of these pigments may contribute to xanthochromia following SAH.

In the present study, we evaluated the efficacy of superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery (STA-MCA) anastomosis combined with encephalo-duro-myo-synangiosis (EDMS) in the treatment of non-moyamoya steno-occlusive cerebrovascular disease by retrospectively reviewing clinical and radiological data from 66 patients treated between January 2006 and April 2011. Forty-six double STA-MCA anastomoses and 20 single anastomoses were completed, and all remained patent in the perioperative phase, as confirmed by CT angiography. Postoperative CT perfusion imaging demonstrated immediate improvement in perfusion in the revascularized hemisphere. On discharge, 50 of the 66 patients (75.8%) had an improved National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score relative to preoperative values. After at least 6 months of follow-up, 54 (88.5%) patients had improved NIHSS scores relative to discharge values. CT perfusion imaging showed significant improvement compared to post-operative images. Follow-up digital subtraction angiography confirmed that 95 of 96 (99%) anastomoses remained patent. There was no significant difference between the single and double bypasses in terms of either clinical or hemodynamic outcomes on the revascularized side. STA-MCA combined with EDMS was effective for the treatment of non-moyamoya steno-occlusive cerebrovascular disease with hemodynamic impairment. Hemodynamic evaluation before and after surgery may help identify patients in need of a bypass and may be useful for predicting outcome."

CD009372,0,2054196,0,Magnetic resonance angiography of the intracranial vasculature.,"Preliminary experience has shown that MRA can provide useful clinical information that complements the more traditional SE brain evaluation of patients with cerebrovascular disease. MRA is particularly appealing in that it provides a relatively rapid, noninvasive alternative to the existing vascular imaging modalities and the capability to evaluate the brain parenchyma directly. This can often be done without repositioning the patient or significantly prolonging the examination time. MRA sequences have been applied in the evaluation of patients with intracranial aneurysms, vascular malformations, vasoocclusive disease, neoplasms, and dural sinus thrombosis. The MRA study design and acquisition parameters are crucial and need to be optimized to maximize sensitivity and specificity of the examination based on the individual clinical presentation. The results of the SE and MRA studies should be evaluated together to obtain a definitive diagnosis or to determine whether conventional angiography is needed. As with any other diagnostic procedure, it is important to recognize the strengths and limitations of these techniques. Despite its advantages, MRA will not replace conventional catheter angiography in the near future. Rather, it will complement existing indications for conventional MR studies. Spatial resolution and intravascular signal loss due to rapid, complex flow continue to be the most limiting factors in intracranial MRA imaging. Significant improvements in these areas are currently being realized."

X ray CT demonstrated a severe hemorrhagic infarction in right MCA territory accompanying marked shift of midline structures. Cerebral angiograms represented occlusion of right MCA showing floating emboli in the internal carotid. Hematocrit value was found to be high as 61.2 per cent. Elevated ICP levels were noted by means of epidural pressure monitoring. Deterioration of patient status was considered to be based on impairment of cerebral circulation due to hemostasis by elevated blood viscosity. In addition to administration of mannitol solution, intermittent exsanguinations, 1000 ml in total amount, were performed and hematocrit levels were corrected by hemodilution.

CD009372,0,1950901,0,Stroke associated with coronary artery bypass surgery.,"Medical records and neuroimaging studies of 30 patients with major neurologic events after coronary artery surgery were reviewed. Two thousand and twenty-nine coronary artery bypass graft operations were performed in our institution between October 15, 1985, and December 27, 1989. Of these, there were 30 documented neurologic events suggesting acute ischemic injury during the intraoperative or the postoperative period. Clinical manifestations included hemiparesis, monoparesis, aphasia, bilateral cortical dysfunction, cortical and brainstem dysfunction, and left homonymous hemianopsia. There were five deaths directly attributable to neurologic injury. Twenty-two patients had a CT scan of the head, of which 15 showed evidence of acute infarction, two suggested watershed lesions from cerebral hypoperfusion, and the remainder showed findings consistent with multiple cerebral emboli or primary intracranial occlusion. Five carotid arteriograms and one digital subtraction arteriogram of the carotids were obtained. Angiographic findings revealed two common carotid artery occlusions, one callosal marginal artery occlusion, and two cases of bilateral high-grade internal carotid stenoses. Our findings support the contention that in patients who suffer cerebral infarction associated with coronary artery bypass grafting, the main mechanism of injury is cerebral embolization rather than cerebral hypoperfusion."

CD009372,0,19194687,0,[Neuroimaging evaluation of intracerebral hemorrhage].,"Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is responsible for 10-15% of all strokes. Standard evaluation includes a CT examination, in which ICH is initially hyperdense but gradually decreases in density over days to weeks. In emergency situations, native CT can be supplemented with CT angiography, which reliably shows aneurysms and other vascular abnormalities larger than 2-3 mm. For detecting ICH in hyperacute situations, MRI is as sensitive as CT but signal characteristics are more complex, strongly depending on the oxygenation status of hemoglobin and the redox status of iron. In terms of localization, deep ICH in typical locations with hypertensive etiology is differentiated from atypical lobar ICH. Atypical ICH in elderly patients is often caused by cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Despite advances in noninvasive imaging techniques, today most atypical ICH patients still require digital subtraction angiography for a complete evaluation. In contrast, hypertensive ICH can be assumed in patients with known arterial hyperstension and ICH in a typical location."

The patient presented with aphasia, confusion, headaches, nausea, right hemianopia and early papilledema. CT revealed an intracerebral hematoma in the left occipital lobe but MRI and MRA failed to provide any further insight into the etiology of the hemorrhage. Due to persisting intracranial hypertension, the patient underwent neuroendoscopic removal of the hematoma. After blood clots were evacuated, pathologic vascularity was found. Tissue samples were collected from the walls of the hematoma cavity. Neoplastic cells adjacent to the blood vessels were identified in one of the samples. The patient was reoperated and a glioma-like tumor was removed. The diagnosis of cerebral intratumoral hemorrhage is difficult especially when there are no previous clinical signs of a tumor. Neuroendoscopy may speed up the diagnostic process which usually extends past resorption of the haematoma and the technique may be an alternative to stereotactic surgery."

Evidence is now rapidly accumulating that both diffusion- and perfusion-weighted imaging, particularly when used in combination with high-speed MR angiography, will lead to improvements in the clinical management of acute stroke patients. Other novel MR techniques, such as spectroscopic imaging, diffusion tensor imaging, and blood oxygenation level-dependent functional MRI, have not yet assumed a definitive role in the diagnostic evaluation of cerebrovascular disease.

Characteristics of the malformations on MR images were reviewed retrospectively, and a comparative evaluation of MR and CT images was made. Of 14 angiographically evident malformations, 13 intra-axial lesions were detected on both CT and MR images, and one dural malformation gave false-negative results on both modalities. The appearance of parenchymal lesions on MR images closely mirrored characteristic CT findings. Calcific foci were difficult to separate from vessels on both images. Clot was more easily identified on MR images. In the detection of 15 angiographically occult malformations, CT proved more sensitive when focal calcification was the only evidence of their presence. MR study failed to detect two small supratentorial lesions evidenced by faint calcifications on CT scans. In two patients, MR images showed small hemorrhages not detectable by CT, and MR provided strong evidence for the diagnosis of hematoma for 12 lesions. Angiographically evident malformations have a highly characteristic appearance on MR images. MR may be more sensitive than CT in the detection of small hemorrhagic foci associated with cryptic arteriovenous malformations and may add specificity in the diagnosis of occult malformations in some cases, but MR is less sensitive than CT for the detection of small calcified malformations."
CD009372,0,22051988,0,Imaging for carotid stenting.,Carotid artery stenting (CAS) using embolic protection devices (EPD) has emerged as a viable alternative to carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in select patients. Imaging plays a critical role in the selection of patients for CAS. Duplex ultrasonography alone is insufficient to assess patients for CAS suitability. Advancements in computed tomography angiography (CTA) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) techniques are helping to identify lesions vulnerable to cerebral embolization during carotid interventions - a more prevalent event during CAS in comparison to CEA. Here we review the relevant data on the various imaging techniques available to improve patient selection and minimize neurologic adverse events during carotid artery stenting.
CD009372,0,15588953,0,Intracranial collateral pathways assessed by contrast-enhanced three-dimensional transcranial color-coded sonography.,"Individual parameter settings of the duplex machine and limited insonation angles may influence the visualization of small intracranial vessels in 2-D transcranial color-coded sonography. The aim of our study was the morphologic assessment of intracranial collateral pathways (first auditory area celiac artery, A(1)CA; anterior communicating artery, AComA; first parental generation celiac artery P(1)CA; posterior communicating artery, PComA) using 3-D transcranial color-coded duplex sonography (3-D TCCS) and digital subtraction angiography (DSA). A total of 41 patients with large vessel disease and 30 patients who had suffered subarachnoidal hemorrhage (mean age 52 +/- 15 years) were involved. In all patients, angiography was performed within 10 days following 3-D sonography. The patients were investigated with a color-coded duplex system using the power mode. Contrast enhancement was achieved by continuous infusion of a galactose-based echo-enhancer using a perfusor pump. The 3-D system consists of an electromagnet that induces a low-intensity magnetic field near the head of the patient. A magnetic position sensor is attached to the ultrasound (US) probe and transmits the spatial orientation to a personal computer, which also receives the corresponding 2-D images from the video port of the duplex machine. Angiography revealed a ""complete"" circle of Willis in one third of the patients and, in the remaining patients at least one vessel was hypoplastic or absent. Sufficient temporal bone windows allowed the sonographic investigation of 466 (94%) of 497 expected arterial segments. The comparison of both techniques resulted in a weighted kappa value of 0.56 for the A(1)CA and 0.63 for the AComA. In the posterior circulation kappa values of 0.56 for the P(1)CA and 0.43 for the PComA were calculated. In 50 vessels (10%), 3-D sonography misdiagnosed the diameter of a collateral vessel as normal and angiography revealed hypoplasia or aplasia of this vessel. The main advantage of 3-D TCCS is that it enables the investigator to reconstruct virtually any arbitrary view angle. Compared with angiography or magnetic resonance (MR) angiography, 3-D sonography can be performed easily in critically ill patients on stroke units or intensive care units. The noninvasive assessment of the circle of Willis may be useful in patients who undergo carotid surgery without angiography. Combined with hemodynamic information, contrast-enhanced 3-D TCCS might increase the diagnostic impact of transcranial US."

CD009372,0,23361488,0,Cerebral perfusion imaging.,"Recent advances are allowing computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to add diagnostic information derived from microscopic-scale brain structure, pathology, and physiology to the gross pathologic information that has been the core of brain imaging diagnosis since the 1980s. Physiologic imaging with MR perfusion weighted imaging has joined MR diffusion imaging as an essential components of stroke and brain tumor MRI. At the same time, the volume scanning revolution in CT technology has dramatically decreased the radiation doses required for CT perfusion imaging by allowing routine simultaneous CT perfusion and noninvasive dynamic bone subtracted CT angiography (CTA) without a significant increase in radiation dose over conventional head CT-CTA alone. Although ongoing research and clinical trials is needed to define more precisely how these techniques can best be exploited to improve clinical care and patient outcomes, in the acute stroke and subarachnoid hemorrhage populations the radiation risk associated with CT perfusion imaging is negligible and the physiologic information promises significant patient safety benefits."

CD009372,0,11901239,0,Imaging of white matter lesions.,"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is very sensitive for the detection of white matter lesions (WML), which occur even in normal ageing. Intrinsic WML should be separated from physiological changes in the ageing brain, such as periventricular caps and bands, and from dilated Virchow-Robin spaces. Genuine WML are best seen with T2-weighted sequences such as long TR dual-echo spin-echo or FLAIR (fluid-attenuated inversion recovery); the latter has the advantage of easily separating WML from CSF-like lesions. Abnormal T2 signal in MRI is not specific, and can accompany any change in tissue composition. In the work-up of WML in small vessel disease, magnetic resonance angiography can be used to rule out (concomitant) large vessel disease, and diffusion-weighted MRI to identify new ischaemic lesions (amidst pre-existing old WML). The differential diagnosis of WML includes hereditary leukodystrophies and acquired disorders. The leukodystrophies that can present in adult age include metachromatic leukodystrophy, globoid cell leukodystrophy, adrenomyeloneuropathy, mitochondrial disorders, vanishing white matter, and cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis. These metabolic disorders typically present with symmetrical abnormalities that can be very diffuse, often with involvement of brainstem and cerebellum. Only the mitochondrial disorders tend to be more asymmetric and frequently involve the grey matter preferentially. Among the acquired white matter disorders, hypoxic-ischaemic causes are by far the most prevalent and without further clinical clues there is no need to even consider the next most common disorder, i.e. multiple sclerosis (MS). Among the nonischaemic disorders, MS is far more common than vasculitis, infection, intoxication and trauma. While vasculitis can mimic small vessel disease, MS has distinctive features with preferential involvement of the subcortical U-fibres, the corpus callosum, temporal lobes and the brainstem/cerebellum. Spinal cord lesions are very common in MS, but do not occur in normal ageing nor in small vessel disease."

Computed tomography revealed an acute subdural hematoma, intracerebral hematoma, and subarachnoid hemorrhage, for which a craniotomy was performed. Cerebral angiograms performed 9 days after the operation demonstrated a decrease in the size of the AVM. Repeated cerebral angiograms performed a month later demonstrated complete disappearance of the AVM. Follow-up angiograms performed 19 months after hemorrhage confirmed complete disappearance of the AVM. Spontaneous disappearance is known to occur occasionally in small AVMs but rarely in huge ones such as the one presented here. Several possible mechanisms for spontaneous disappearance of AVMs are discussed."
CD009372,0,1584363,0,Ruptured occult arteriovenous malformation associated with an unruptured intracranial aneurysm: report of three cases.,"Three patients who were admitted for intracranial hemorrhage are reported. Cerebral angiography demonstrated an aneurysm arising from the middle cerebral artery bifurcation. No other malformation was visible either on the computed tomographic scan or on angiography. The diagnosis was ruptured middle cerebral artery aneurysm with intracerebral hematoma. At surgery, there was no blood in the sylvian fissure and the aneurysm was not ruptured. Evacuation of the hematoma and thorough exploration of the cavity led to the discovery and resection of a small vascular anomaly typical of an arteriovenous malformation responsible for the hemorrhage. Occult vascular malformations and the association of aneurysm with arteriovenous malformations are discussed. In these 3 patients, the coexistence of these two malformations could be related to a common congenital abnormality."

Cerebral angiography revealed fistulas located in the anterior cranial fossa. Three patients underwent surgery, and the fistulas were successfully obliterated. One patient with nonruptured DAVF requested conservative medical management. Incidental detection of asymptomatic or nonruptured DAVFs in the anterior cranial fossa has increased with the wider use of MR imaging. Increase in the size of a venous varix is the indicator for aggressive therapeutic intervention in a patient receiving conservative medical management for asymptomatic or nonruptured DAVFs in the anterior cranial fossa."

Computed tomography on admission revealed small intraventricular hemorrhage in the right lateral ventricle. No intracranial vascular lesion was detected and magnetic resonance angiography was used at yearly follow up. Two years after the first admission, he suffered diplopia and cerebral angiography revealed transverse sinus dural AVF. Right pulsatile tinnitus occurred 4 years after the first admission. The symptoms suddenly disappeared 5 years after the first admission, and follow-up angiography showed disappearance of the dural AVF. The exact mechanism of the spontaneous occlusion of dural AVF remains unknown. This case of spontaneous transverse sinus dural AVF closure occurred without disruption of sinus patency, suggesting that thrombosis of the draining veins into sinuses was not involved."
CD009372,0,2678596,0,The value of angiography in cerebrovascular disease.,"The expanding availability of digital subtraction angiography has essentially contributed in lowering the risks in the use of angiography of the cerebral arteries. The best results in imaging the cerebral artery are achieved by conventional subtraction angiography after selective catheterisation. This is, however, only important for diagnosis in intracerebral pathological changes distal of the Circulus Willisi or in connection with preoperative interventional radiological treatment. Pre-clinical diagnosis of patients with cerebrovascular occlusive disease as well as clinical diagnosis with Doppler and B-scan US sonography can be optimally complemented by DSA using 4-5 French catheters entered in the thoracic ascending aorta. Using this technique, the sensitivity and specificity with an image-matrix of 512 is diagnostically adequate and includes an only limited examination risk. Complication with lasting neurological defects will be least observed after intravenous pre-atrial application of contrast media and most after selective angiography of the carotid artery. Here the extent of the multiple arteriosclerotic obliteration is of essential importance. The quality of interpretation of the diagnostic findings essentially depends on indications not only about the grade of obliteration but also on the morphological details. At present DSA with application of contrast media into the thoracic ascending aorta in combination with the duplex-scan method represent the optimum for the diagnosis of cerebrovascular disease. In spite of lower specificity intravenous application of contrast media has to be preferred for post-operative controls and controls of progressing disease with ""screening""."
CD009372,0,2678595,0,The value of diagnostic procedures in treating ischemic attacks and stroke.,"Diagnostic procedures for cerebral ischemia make clear strategies mandatory. Careful recording of case history, internal and neurological investigation either substantiate or make unlikely TIA and stroke. CT scan not only differentiates bleedings, tumors etc from ischemia but also can give very valuable information about the underlying vascular pathology. Multiple lacunes are characteristic of cerebral microangiopathy. Territorial and branch occlusion infarcts mostly indicate embolic occlusion of pial vessels from either cardiac or arterial sources. Endzone and borderline infarctions are seen with high grade stenosis or occlusion of the internal carotid artery. The identification of embolic sources necessitates cardiological (including echocardiography) and angiological (Doppler sonography and in selected cases angiography) investigations. Therapeutic and prophylactic measures depend on the etiology of TIA and stroke and are briefly dealt with."
CD009372,0,17981672,0,Subarachnoid hemorrhage: effect on cerebral blood flow and cerebral metabolism.,Alterations in cerebral blood flow and metabolism after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) are well known and have been extensively described. Many techniques exist in the intensive care setting to monitor for these alterations. Ranging from classic neurological exam to novel imaging studies a variety of modalities are available for intensive monitoring. Early identification of cerebral vasospasm is the key to prevention of its long term complications and as such the role of genetics and biochemical markers are currently being investigated. The dynamics of cerebral blood flow and metabolism following SAH are unique and require additional studies before any monitoring technique can be used as stand alone modality and supplant the DSA as the gold standard for detection of cerebral vasospasm.

Report of two cases.,"The authors report two cases of ischemic stroke secondary to occlusive vasculopathy two decades after radiation therapy (RT) for medulloblastoma. Both patients underwent posterior fossa medulloblastoma partial resection, followed by craniospinal RT in which a cobalt 60 source was used; 40 Gy were given to the whole brain plus a 15-Gy boost to the posterior fossa. Both patients received multiagent chemotherapy, immediately following radiation therapy in the first case and after repeated craniotomy for recurrence 13 years after radiation in the second case. They experienced multiple sequelae from radiation and chemotherapy, including growth retardation and psychomotor delay. However, 20 years after treatment, they remained tumor free and able to work, until they presented with focal neurological deficits and seizures. Computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain in both cases showed no tumor recurrence, but did demonstrate ischemia in a posterior cerebral artery distribution. Cerebral angiography revealed multiple mid-sized arterial wall irregularities as well as focal stenoses consistent with a postirradiation vasculopathy. The pathophysiological mechanisms, radiological appearance, and incidence of this syndrome are reviewed from the literature."

We examined the clinical characteristics of TIA patients presenting with enhanced lesions visualized by contrast-enhanced MRI. We retrospectively evaluated 64 patients with carotid TIAs. We evaluated the frequency and topography of TIA associated infarcts on contrast-enhanced MRI and compared the clinical background of patients with and without such lesions. Twenty-three patients underwent plain MRI only, while the remaining 41 patients underwent contrast-enhanced MRI. Of the latter 41 patients, 16 had abnormal enhanced lesions (39%: group L), while 25 had no lesions (61%: group NL). In group L, all lesions were spotty, and they were located in the cerebral cortex in 13 patients (81%), the subcortex in two (12%), and the perforator territory in one (6%). Aphasia or confusional state, hypertension, and emboligenic cardiac or arterial disease (stenosis > or =50%) were more frequently observed in group L than in group NL (38 vs. 8%, 81 vs. 48%, and 93 vs. 60%, respectively, P<0. 05).

There are no effective treatments other than surgical intervention. However, another option for decreasing the occurrence of SAH may be prevention of aneurysms formation and of their rupture by controlling risk factors. Cigarette smoking has been recently shown to be one of the major risk factors for SAH. We investigated whether cigarette smoking increased the risk of developing cerebral aneurysms and of SAH. Degree of smoking was investigated in 182 patients with SAH and in 123 patients with an unruptured cerebral aneurysm incidentally detected during investigation of other diseases. Sixty-nine patients with other diseases who were shown to be free of cerebral aneurysms through MR angiography served as controls. Smoking significantly increased the risk of both aneurysm formation and SAH; The odds ratio for SAH was 2.4, and for unruptured cerebral aneurysm 1.7. Smoking especially increased the occurrence of SAH in women and in youngsters. However, smoking did not influence the occurrence of cerebral vasospasm and multiplicity of aneurysms. These data suggest the importance of avoiding smoking to prevent the occurrence of cerebral aneurysms and of SAH."
CD009372,0,15757025,0,Emerging medical and surgical management strategies in the evaluation and treatment of intracerebral hemorrhage.,"Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) accounts for approximately 10% of all strokes and causes high morbidity and mortality. Rupture of the small perforating vessels of the cerebral arteries is caused by chronic hypertension, which induces pathologic changes in the small vessels and accounts for most cases of ICH; however, amyloid angiopathy and other secondary causes are being seen more frequently with the increasing age of the population. Recent computed tomographic studies have revealed that ICH is a dynamic process with up to one third of initial hemorrhages expanding within the first several hours of ictus. Secondary injury is believed to result from the development of cerebral edema and the release of specific neurotoxins associated with the breakdown products of hemoglobin. Treatment is primarily supportive. Surgical evacuation is the treatment of choice for patients with neurologic deterioration from infratentorial hematomas. Randomized trials comparing surgical evacuation to medical management have shown no benefit of surgical removal of supratentorial hemorrhages. New strategies focusing on early hemostasis, improved critical care management, and less invasive surgical techniques for clot evacuation are promising to decrease secondary neurologic injury. We review the pathophysiology of ICH, its medical management, and new treatment strategies for improving patient outcome."

Her past history and familial history were unremarkable. She became short-tempered at 56 years old (Oct. 1991). She had the first seizure attack and was admitted to a hospital at March 4, 1993, with prolonged disturbance of consciousness and subsequent mental deterioration. Her brain CT showed multiple small calcifications in the subcortical white matter and pons. The laboratory data including blood count, serum chemistry, serological studies and CSF was normal. MRI and digital subtraction angiography of the cranial vessels were unremarkable. There was a decrease in accumulation in the right cerebral hemisphere on 123I IMP SPECT. Despite anti-convulsant therapy, she had recurrent seizures several times, with gradual worsening of her mental state. She had the latest seizure attack and was transferred to Matsusaka Chuo Hospital, on August 29, 1993. After the attack she had been in the apallic state, and died on Nov. 13, 1995. This case was discussed in a neurological CPC. The discussants suggested that the isolated angiitis of the central nervous system caused secondary seizures and cerebral infarctions. Post-mortem examination revealed the CNS findings of vasculitis at various stages, calcification or mineralization mainly in the subcortical white matter and pons, massive cerebral infarctions with massive exudate, fresh and old small bleedings and exudate around the inflamed or calcified vessels. The white matter degeneration resembled that of Binswanger leukoencephalopathy.

The present report describes the case of a 70-year-old woman with an incidentally detected, asymptomatic, small basilar tip non-thrombosed aneurysm who experienced rupture of the aneurysm 2 years after coiling. Cerebral angiography taken on the day of rupture revealed only small recanalization of the aneurysm neck with no dome-filling. This is the first report of delayed rupture due to minor recurrence of a previously unruptured small asymptomatic cerebral aneurysm after saccular coil packing. A literature review of 26 reports of late bleeding after coil embolization of previously unruptured cerebral aneurysms showed that dome-filling after coil embolization, symptomatic aneurysms and large/giant aneurysms all increase the risk of delayed rupture in previously unruptured aneurysms after saccular coil packing."

Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging showed SAH localized in the interhemispheric fissure and cerebral infarction in the territory of the right ACA. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) demonstrated segmental narrowing and dilatation at the right A(1) and A(2) portions of the ACA, leading to a diagnosis of ACA dissection. Fourteen days after the onset, DSA confirmed the enlarged fusiform dilatation of the right A(2) portion with distal narrowing, suggesting the risk of rerupture of the dissection. Endovascular obliteration of the aneurysm with parent artery occlusion was performed without anastomosis on day 16. The aneurysm was catheterized and obliterated with detachable coils. Postoperative DSA revealed complete obliteration of the dissection and parent artery. The patient was doing well without recurrence of the dissection 8 months after the intervention. The simultaneous occurrence of SAH and cerebral infarction in patients with ACA dissection is extremely rare, and the optimal treatment has not yet been established.

A retrospective analysis of the digital subtraction angiogram and MR images suggested that the cervical spinal DAVFs were already present in 2004 (6 years previously). Multiple DAVFs, although rare, do exist and it is important to look for any evidence of their presence when evaluating patients with symptoms suggestive of arteriovenous fistulas."
CD009372,0,12916556,0,Neuroimaging of stroke: a review.,"Advances in neuroimaging technology during the past 30 years have resulted in a virtual explosion in the amount of pathologic information that can be obtained in the clinical stroke setting. This neuroimaging revolution has led to a much better understanding of cerebrovascular and tissue pathology, creating a wide array of opportunities for acute treatment and secondary prevention. Advances include early and accurate detection of ischemic and infarcted tissue and the ability to reveal hypoperfused tissue at risk. Clinicians are increasingly able to noninvasively detect embolic and atherothrombotic intravascular lesions. Vascular lesions associated with stroke can be characterized through endovascular neuroimaging techniques and repaired by various means. In this article, we provide an overview and update on the various techniques used in the neuroimaging of stroke and intracranial hemorrhage, including computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasound, and catheter angiography. We outline the specific role of each modality in clinical practice."
CD009372,0,3591482,0,Changes produced by CT scanning in the outlook of severe head injury.,"This is a study of the changes that have occurred in the field of severe head injury since the advent of CT scanning, comparing two homogeneous series of patients selected by clinical status (Glasgow Coma Scale less than or equal to 8), namely a series of 1,000 cases admitted to our Department between 1973 and 1976, already published in this Journal, and one of 385 cases cared for between 1979 and 1980, when CT scanning had become generally available. The two series of patients compare very closely in many respects, particularly in the incidence of surgical cases. In the more recent series the overall outcome was better both in surgical and in non-surgical cases. Among patients in the CT scan series the incidence of brain contusion associated with haematoma was greater than that of pure subdural haematomas. In non-surgical patients the CT scan, unlike cerebral angiography, afforded better identification of traumatic lesions and the grouping of patients into homogeneous categories correlating with a given outcome. On admission, cerebral angiography and CT scanning were equally effective in detecting lesions of surgical import; later in the course of the illness, however, CT scanning proved far more effective in detecting changes, with fully 15% of the patients being referred for surgery in the light of repeat CT scan findings as opposed to only 4% undergoing surgery on the indications of repeat angiography. Also, in the new series the mean interval from injury to surgery was shorter, with 64% of patients being operated on within 6 hours of the injury.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Localization of an aneurysm via computed tomography depends on the size of the aneurysm. Proof of an intracerebral haemorrhage is definitely a pointer towards lateral localization of the vascular malformation. This means that in severely ill patients, panangiography need not be effected for the purpose of diagnosis. Attention is drawn to the pathological emergence of the contrast medium after intravenous administration in subarachnoid haemorrhages. The authors considers this a sign of a disturbance of the blood-brain barrier, although the pathogenetic mechanism remains unknown. Computed tomography is a valuable complement to angiography in subarachnoidal haemorrhage. However, it is pointed out by means of a few examples that it may well be that an accurate diagnosis can be arrived at only via biopsy, i.e. by the histological approach only."
CD009372,0,1727311,0,Cerebral vasculitis: MR imaging and angiographic correlation.,"Cerebral vasculitis is an unusual disorder with numerous causes. One such entity, noninfectious granulomatous angiitis of the nervous system (GANS), is an extremely rare disease with a predilection for leptomeningeal and parenchymal arteries and veins. Isolated involvement of the central nervous system is characteristic of GANS, which has also been referred to as primary angiitis of the central nervous system (PACNS). The results of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and angiography in seven patients with presumed PACNS were retrospectively analyzed and correlated. MR images were positive in every case. Characteristically, lesions were multiple, bilateral, and supratentorial. Both gray- and white-matter infarcts were identified in four of seven patients; infarcts were most common in the deep white matter. PACNS can also appear as primary parenchymal hemorrhage or simulate low-grade glioma. All lesions identified on MR images were associated with positive angiographic findings of cerebral vasculitis in the corresponding vascular distribution. However, for 12 of 33 vascular distributions with angiographic evidence of cerebral vasculitis, no lesions were identified on MR images. These correlative observations suggest that some patients with proved PACNS may have normal MR imaging results."

Of the 136 consecutive patients with confirmed CCAD, 16 presented with pulsatile tinnitus. On admission 10 patients presented with subjective tinnitus and five with objective tinnitus, tinnitus being the only presenting symptom in one case. In one further case with bilateral ICA dissection (ICAD) subjective tinnitus appeared three months after the initial symptoms of arterial dissection, despite a contralateral cervical bruit being evident on admission. Thirteen patients presented with headache or neck pain. Ischaemic symptoms were detected in six and Horner's syndrome in four patients. Vertigo and dysgeusia were reported in two patients each. Arterial dissection involved unilateral ICA in 11, bilateral ICA in two, unilateral vertebral artery (VA) in two and bilateral ICA and bilateral VA in one patient. In angiography the most common finding was irregular stenosis, and the majority of these abnormalities normalized during follow-up. To avoid delay in diagnosis a high index of suspicion and early angiography (digital subtraction or magnetic resonance angiography) are warranted."

Their diseases included arterial trunk stenosis/occlusion ( n=4), aneurysm ( n=3), arteriovenous malformation ( n=2), venous angioma ( n=1), and sinus thrombosis ( n=1). The technique depicted not only anatomical features, comparably to MR angiography ( n=10/11), but also hemodynamics such as collateral flow at a temporal resolution of 1.68 s/frame. When compared with conventional angiograms ( n=7), details were missed in four patients (incomplete demonstration of aneurysmal neck in two and poor separation of AVM components in two).

Average age; 7.83 years (range: 2 months to 15 years). Confirming diagnosis was performed by computerised tomography (CT) scan, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, echography and/or cerebral arteriography. Ten cases of ischaemic stroke and ten of haemorrhagic stroke were catalogued. Average follow-up was 5.45 years (range: 9 months to 10.8 years). Fibromuscular dysplasia, arthritis and meningitis are predominant in ischaemic stroke etiology, there also being one case of Moya-Moya. Haemorrhagic strokes are mostly produced by arteriovenous malformation. The predominant presenting form of ischaemic stroke was hemiplegia and of haemorrhagic strokes it was intracranial hypertension. There were no deaths as a result of ischaemic accidents but three in the cerebral haemorrhage group. Treatment was surgical in two cases, embolisation in two others and medical support in the remaining sixteen. There were no cases of relapse, except in the Moya-Moya case. Clinical position and the ability to carry on day to day life were most affected in the cerebral attack cases, which would indicate ischaemic stroke recuperation is worse than that for haemorrhagic strokes."

CD009372,0,7624643,0,Stereotactic linear radiosurgery for cavernous angiomas.,"Optimal management of symptomatic cavernous angiomas (CA) located in the thalamus and the brainstem is problematic. Clinical and radiological (MRI) follow-up series suggest that having hemorrhaged once, recurrent hemorrhage with progressive neurologic dysfunction may commonly occur. We have therefore chosen to treat these lesions when first symptomatic with stereotactic linear radiosurgery (SLR). We now report, after a median follow-up of 27 months, 12 patients with CAs (9 women, 3 men, mean age 40 years) treated in this fashion. Ten patients presented with hemorrhage (3 had more than one hemorrhage): two patients had new onset seizures. All patients had enhanced MRI/MRAs characteristic of CA. There were five brainstem and five thalamic CAs, and one each in the temporal lobe and insula. Cerebral angiograms were done in 8 patients for comparison with their respective MRAs. Only one CA was visualized in the late venous phase on cerebral angiogram and identical vascular features were appreciated on the MRA. The diameter of the CAs ranged from 1.0 to 3.0 cm with a mean of 1.6 cm. Dosimetry planning was based on MRI/CT features and the mean dose at the isocenter was 2.167 cGy (range = 2,000-2,500 cGy) delivered with a mean collimation diameter of 1.46 cm (range = 1.0-2.0 cm). All 12 patients continued to improve neurologically after SLR and had MRI-documented changes in their lesions: in general, the lesions became smaller and signal characteristics converted to methemaglobin. However, 1 patient had an early post-SLR hemorrhage, documented by MRI, at 4.5 months.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

CD009372,0,200392,0,Computed tomography of extracerebral hematoma.,"The appearance on C.T. of 30 extracerebral hematomas is described. Acute subdural hematomas were seen as bandlike lesions with markedly increased, homogenous density. Epidural hematomas demonstrated a high density and a biconvex, lenticular shape. During the process of liquefaction the density decreases and three hematomas appeared as isodense lesions. The majority of chronic subdural hematomas presented a mildly to moderately decreased, nonhomogenous density, the clearly identifiable inner wall of the lesion being either convex or concave. Subdural hygromas showed a homogeneous, markedly decreased density. Almost all the hematomas caused compression of the homolateral lateral ventricle and displacement of midline structures, particularly of the septum pellucidum. In 60% of the hematomas a dilatation of the contralateral lateral ventricle, predominantly of the posterior part was seen. Acute hematomas presented oedema in varying degrees, in chronic hematomas oedema was usually absent. In the original interpretation extracerebral hematomas were recognized as a lesion on C.T. in 97% (1 false negative result), in 90%, the lesion was correctly diagnosed as an extracerebral hematoma (1 false negative and 2 incorrect). The series contained one false positive C.T. scan and 2 intracerebral hematomas were interpreted incorrectly as subdural hematomas. The review C.T. diagnosis proved to be correct in 100%. C.T. and angiography appeared to have about the same diagnostic accuracy. However, C.T. is a non invasive investigation and it provides valuable additional information with regard to all the intracranial contents. Therefore C.T. should be the method of first choice in the diagnosis of extracerebral hematomas."

Case report].,"A 48-year-old female suffered from severe headache, vomiting, and disturbance of consciousness. On admission, she was somnolent with mild paresis of the left leg. Precontrast computed tomography (CT) scans showed a high-density area in the left sylvian fissure and the posterior horn of the left lateral ventricle. Angiographically, a right middle cerebral artery aneurysm and a basilar artery aneurysm were recognized. Furthermore, on the venous phase of bilateral carotid angiograms, superior sagittal sinus (SSS) thrombosis was recognized. Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) was probably induced by rupture of a dilated vein associated with SSS thrombosis, because high-density area on CT scan and location of the aneurysms were different. The patient was initially treated conservatively. Two months later, craniotomy was performed which did not disclose any trace of hemorrhage around the aneurysms and aneurysms themselves. Postoperatively, acute brain swelling and generalized convulsion were induced. The patient became ambulatory 5 months after surgery. In SAH cases, the venous phase should be examined at least in one side of the carotid arteries. In such a SAH case induced by venous thrombosis complicated by aneurysms it is very difficult to decide the timing of surgery for aneurysms."

A review of the literature was made to clarify the incidence, the pathological change, and the prognosis of systemic lupus erythematosus with subarachnoid hemorrhage. The incidence of subarachnoid hemorrhage in SLE was about two percent in the reported clinical cases. The mechanisms of the subarachnoid hemorrhage and the aneurysmal formation in SLE seemed to be due to angitic changes, which involved the vessels of the whole body systematically. The exact prognosis of SLE with subarachnoid hemorrhage is difficult to say, but it seems to be unfortunately poor due to multiplicity of the lesion and the difficulty of its treatment."

In 13 consecutive patients with ICA dissections the diagnosis was made by means of non-invasive tests including extracranial and transcranial Doppler sonography, contrast enhanced computed tomography (ceCT), and, in five patients, MRI. Intra-arterial digital subtraction angiography used as the gold standard in all cases was confirmative. Extracranial and transcranial ultrasound findings indicative of the diagnosis could be identified. MRI directly demonstrated the intramural haematoma and the false lumen of the dissected artery. These non-invasive techniques also allowed for repetitive follow up examinations. They were, however, unable to demonstrate false aneurysms in the chronic state. Results show that the diagnosis of carotid dissection can be made by means of cerebrovascular ultrasound and MRI."

Twenty-two patients (16 men, 6 women) with a CA AVF (n = 5) or PA (n = 17) owing to a gunshot or stab wound, carotid endarterectomy, blunt trauma, a tumor, spontaneous dissection, or a central venous catheter were treated with percutaneous placement of stent grafts. The patients presented with tumor, bruit, headache, mouth and tracheostomy bleeding, transitory hemiparesis, seizure, or stroke. Diagnoses were made by using computed tomographic angiography (CTA) and digital subtraction angiography. Fourteen lesions were in the common CA; eight were in the internal CA. Homemade devices and stent grafts from a variety of manufacturers were employed. Follow-up evaluations included clinical, CTA, and Doppler ultrasound assessments. All patients had resolution of the PA or AVF. In one patient with a large petrous PA, acute occlusion of the CA developed after placement of three balloon-expandable stent grafts, but there were no neurologic complications because the circle of Willis was functional. During follow-up ranging from 2 months to 13 years, asymptomatic 90% stenosis owing to stent compression was observed on Doppler ultrasound and angiographic examinations in a patient with an autologous vein-covered stent graft in the internal CA. Three other patients died of causes unrelated to stent-graft placement. In all other patients, the stent graft remained patent. Our results indicate that stent grafting is an acceptable alternative to surgery in the treatment of AVF and PAs in the CA."

Previously described PCASL-based angiography techniques were limited to two-dimensional projection images or relatively low-resolution three-dimensional (3D) imaging due to long acquisition time. This work proposes a new PCASL-based 3D magnetic resonance angiography method that uses an accelerated 3D radial acquisition technique (VIPR, spoiled gradient echo) as the readout. Benefiting from the sparsity provided by PCASL and noise-like artifacts of VIPR, this new method is able to obtain submillimeter 3D isotropic resolution and whole head coverage with a 8-min scan. Intracranial angiography feasibility studies in healthy (N = 5) and diseased (N = 5) subjects show reduced saturation artifacts in PCASL-VIPR compared with a standard time-of-flight protocol. These initial results show great promise for PCASL-VIPR for static, dynamic, and vessel selective 3D intracranial angiography."

MRI showed infra- and supratentorial patchy hyperintensities in T2-weighted images and in the FLAIR sequence. Diffusion-weighted imaging revealed corresponding multi-focal hyperintense areas indicating increased diffusion and MRA showed a diffuse multisegmental narrowing of all pial arteries. MRI at day 10 was completely normal, but MRA still revealed vascular narrowing in the right posterior cerebral artery. General slight flow accelerations in all basal arteries occurred after 10 days and lasted for three weeks.

Arterial hypertension exists in a high proportion of cases. The some times complex clinical picture may be due to pressure of nervous structures by the ectatic vessels, ischemia or hemorrhagy. Mostly affected are men over 50 years of age although arteriectasis has been observed in younger patients including children and infants. The disease can be suspected clinically but is generally diagnosed after neuroradiological studies, mostly angiography and/or computerized tomography. Initially arteriectasis was supposed to be the result of arteriosclerosis but histopathology has shown that it may be independent of arteriosclerosis and appears to be the result of a congenital abnormality in the elastic component of the vessel wall. On the basis of our six observations and those already published it becomes apparent that diffuse intracranial arteriectasis represents a specific disease."

He had no medical history. On admission, he exhibited hypesthesia and disturbance of the touch and the vibratory sense on the right side of his body excluding the face. A brain T2* -weighted image revealed the a dot like lesion surrounded by an iso-signal lesion in the medial medulla oblongata. Therefore a diagnosis of medullary hemorrhage was made. Although a vascular malformation was considered as the cause of the hemorrhage, cerebral angiography did not reveal any vascular malformations. After admission, he developed left hypoglossal nerve palsy on day 6, and intractable hiccups on day 11. A T2* -weighted image and a FLAIR image disclosed edema surrounding the hematoma in the medial medullary lesion.

Computed axial tomography is a sensitive procedure for detection of cavernomas. Of 7 cases examined by this technique, 7 (7/7) have shown a well circumscribed round or oval hyperdense nodule, with calcifications in 6/7 cases, a slight surrounding oedema in 3/7 cases and without mass effect, except if there is a visible hematoma at operation (2/8). After contrast administration, 5/7 malformations were enhanced and 2/7 displayed draining veins, a fact that we underline. The differential diagnosis includes a low grade calcified glioma, a thrombosed arterio-venous malformation, a venous angioma or an intracerebral hematoma. Surgical excision is the best treatment of these vascular malformations that bleed frequently, and improved all the patients in this series (8/8)."

CD009372,0,7304126,0,[Capsulo-thalamic hemorrhage (author's transl)].,"The authors report clinical and scanographic findings in 26 cases of capsulo-thalamic hemorrhage. They stress the frequency of arterial hypertension as a pre-disposing factor. The clinical picture is represented by the association of disorders of consciousness (usually obnubilation), contralateral flaccid hemiplegia with hemianesthesia, oculomotor disorders (disturbance of vertical gaze, miosis) and disorders of linguistic and motor behaviour. The paraclinical examination of choice is scanography which enables the site, volume and extent of the hemorrhage to be estimated, together with the mass effect and intraventricular rupture. Clinical and scanographic follow-up indicates a favourable prognosis for capsulo-thalamic hemorrhage (77% survival). Follow-up findings point to several unfavourable prognostic factors: immediate coma, persistent and massive flaccid hemiplegia, hemorrhage size exceeding 3 cm, and severe intraventricular rupture. In the light of the data in the literature, the authors discuss the clinical and scanographic signs of capsulo-thalamic hemorrhage."
CD009372,0,1609697,0,Current role of cerebral angiography in the diagnosis of cerebrovascular diseases.,"The role of cerebral angiography in the diagnosis of cerebrovascular disease is currently being questioned because of the increasing availability of MR angiography. The purpose of this essay is to place the use of cerebral angiography in perspective in light of these new developments. In patients with atherosclerotic cerebrovascular disease, MR angiography can almost entirely supplant cerebral angiography as a screening procedure in the evaluation of the carotid bifurcation. However, detection of ""pseudoocclusion"" still requires cerebral angiography for accurate diagnosis. Atherosclerotic stenosis or occlusion of the major intracranial vessels at the base of the brain can be detected with MR angiography, but not as accurately as with cerebral angiography. Furthermore, for detection of more distal occlusions, cerebral angiography is still needed. A number of erroneous concepts about the risks and value of cerebral angiography have prevented its optimal use for patients with cerebrovascular disease. These myths can be countered by applying several rules to optimize the use of cerebral angiography. Subarachnoid hemorrhage is best evaluated with CT followed by detailed cerebral angiography, although MR angiography can be used as a screening test for aneurysms 3 mm or larger. Cerebral angiography is still necessary to confirm the diagnosis of cerebrovascular malformations, although MR angiography is a useful screening test. Cerebral angiography is required for the definitive diagnosis of arteritis, arterial dissection, or fibromuscular dysplasia."

Three hours later, she was transferred to our hospital by ambulance car because of continuous headache and vomiting. She had no history of head trauma. She had been medicated hypertension for five years. On admission she suffered from headache and nausea. But there was no clinical sign in physical and neurological examinations. The meningeal irritation was not present, but lumbar puncture showed slightly pinky CSF with normal pressure. A plain computed tomographic scan showed a thin high density mass in the left temporal extra-axial region and the slight deviation of the midline structures to the right. Left carotid arteriogram showed an avascular region over the left cerebral convexity, an aneurysm of the left A2-A3 junction and a questionable aneurysm of the bifurcation of left middle cerebral artery. Right carotid arteriogram showed an aneurysm of the bifurcation of right middle cerebral artery. We diagnosed this case as an acute subdural hematoma by CT scan and arteriogram. We were perplexed preoperatively whether this bleeding was spontaneous or secondary to the rupture of aneurysm, and we could not deny the possibility of a ruptured aneurysm. On March 15, 1984, three days after onset, operation was performed. At operation, a small subdural hematoma was removed, and the underlying cortex was normal.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

A rare subtype of arteriovenous fistula may occur from a pseudoaneurysm of the anterior communicating artery (AcoA) instead of the internal carotid artery. We describe a patient with a traumatic pseudoaneurysm of the AcoA with a cavernous sinus fistula treated with endovascular treatment. A 68-year-old man presented with a severe head injury after a fall. Coronal view multiplanar reformatted images with contrast medium showed gradual expansion of the pseudoaneurysm of the AcoA and the enhanced area of the cavernous sinus. Five weeks after the injury, the patient had a subarachnoid hemorrhage. A cerebral angiogram showed a fistula between the pseudoaneurysm of the AcoA and the cavernous sinus. The AcoA, left anterior cerebral artery and part of the pseudoaneurysm were obliterated by coil embolization. A postoperative angiogram showed no flow through the pseudoaneurysm and the cavernous sinus fistula. A traumatic AcoA pseudoaneurysm with a cavernous sinus fistula may occur as an extremely rare complication of head injury."
CD009372,0,10587470,0,Evaluation of measures of technical image quality for intracranial magnetic resonance angiography.,"We evaluate three measures of technical image quality for intracranial magnetic resonance angiography (MRA): (1) a two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) evaluation of vessel visibility, (2) vessel-to-background signal-difference-to-noise ratio (SDNR), and (3) observer ranking of the fidelity of vessel morphology compared to that in a gold standard image. The gold standard used for both the 2AFC and ranking measures is intraarterial catheter angiography. These measures are applied to healthy arterial segments. The 2AFC and SDNR measures directly evaluate the visibility of artery segments for which the existence is known from the gold standard images. We argue that (1) 2AFC evaluates the carrier signals on which any vascular disease process is modulated and provides an upper bound on the detectibility of vascular lesions, (2) SDNR is a predictor of 2AFC, and (3) ranking may be used to predict the relative performance of techniques in the detection of vascular lesions."
CD009372,0,2718867,0,Blood flow in the carotid arteries: quantification by using phase-sensitive MR imaging.,"The feasibility of MR phase-sensitive imaging for the quantification of blood flow in the carotid arteries was studied in two normal volunteers and six patients with carotid artery and/or cerebrovascular disease. The technique consists of sensitizing the phase of the MR signal to blood flow velocity gated to different times in the cardiac cycle. Flow velocities and volumes were measured by using transverse planes in the common, internal, and external carotid arteries, and flow curves were generated. Measurements made by using flow phantoms correlated well with calculated results. The MR measurements yielded values between 250 and 580 ml/min for the total flow through each of the common carotid arteries in the two normal volunteers. Markedly reduced flow (about 50% below normal) was detected in a patient whose arteriogram showed severe occlusion of the internal carotid artery. In a second patient, who had a large frontal intracranial arteriovenous malformation noted by arteriography, the MR-quantified flow was abnormally high (about 1 liter/min). In the remaining four patients, the findings on phase-sensitive quantification were consistent with those expected from clinical and other laboratory studies (including arteriography and sonography). These preliminary findings suggest that MR phase mapping may be a feasible tool for the noninvasive quantification of carotid blood flow."

Measurement of mCBF without blood sampling and single photon emission tomography (SPECT) were performed at 1 and 7 days after surgery in 35 consecutive SAH patients, of whom 16 were examined at day 30 as well. A decrease in mCBF of more than 10% on day 7 versus day 1 was considered to indicate vasospasm. On visual interpretation of SPECT, a perfusion decrease which appeared newly on day 7 was considered to indicate vasospasm. In total, nine of 35 patients had cerebral vasospasm confirmed by computed tomography (CT) and/or angiography. The mCBF measurement showed a 77.8% (7/9) sensitivity, a 88.5% (23/26) specificity, a 70.0% (7/10) positive predictive value, and a 92.0% (23/25) negative predictive value. SPECT yielded a 33.3% (3/9) sensitivity, a 73.1% (19/26) specificity, a 30.0% (3/10) positive predictive value, and a 76.0% (19/25) negative predictive value. On SPECT, decreased perfusion was observed in most of the patients at clipping sites, which might represent post-operative transient abnormal perfusion and should not be read as vasospasm. In conclusion, this mCBF measurement is more accurate than visual interpretation of SPECT for detecting vasospasm."

CD009372,0,1987608,0,Cerebral venography with MR.,"The authors describe a two-dimensional time-of-flight magnetic resonance (MR) angiography technique to create projection venograms of the head. The technique was applied to 27 healthy volunteers and 39 patients. The superior sagittal and straight sinuses, the internal cerebral veins, and the Galen vein were visualized in all the volunteers. Other veins were seen in a high percentage of subjects. Systematic comparison of digital subtraction angiography (DSA) after intraarterial contrast medium injection and MR venography in patients showed good correlation between the two techniques. MR venography proved helpful in identifying thrombosis or patency of cerebral veins and sinuses and showed collateral venous drainage and venous drainage from arteriovenous malformations. There was good correlation between conventional contrast angiography and MR venography. In conclusion, MR venography is considered reliable for showing the cerebral venous system and provides information additional to that of conventional spin-echo imaging."
CD009372,0,11507445,0,[Transcranial Doppler imaging: state of the art].,"Initially introduced in the early 1980's, transcranial Doppler followed by transcranial Doppler sonography were used in neurosurgical units for management and follow-up of intracranial vasospasm in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage. This imaging technique, more sensitive and less invasive than catheter angiography, also proved to be of value for diagnosis of intracranial atherosclerosis, management of patients with head trauma, and evaluation of collateral flow through the circle of Willis. Doppler US would also allow prediction of the risk of symptomatic embolic events through monitoring of HITS. Evaluation of the middle cerebral arteries during carotid occlusion testing is useful for evaluating the need for particular revascularization techniques. Finally, Doppler imaging is useful to assess patients with possible brain death. A recent advance in Doppler imaging is the ability to provide a three-dimensional projection (3D Doppler) of the intracranial arteries enabling improved detection and evaluation of stenoses involving the circle of Willis and improved characterization of intracranial aneurysms. These new applications benefit from the use of US contrast agents and harmonic US imaging."

Diagnostic procedures should include a spinal tap to rule out potentially treatable lesions. CT scan and cerebral angiography may also be helpful in certain cases. Transfusion therapy remains the mainstay of management in the acute phase of cerebral infarction. There is considerable evidence to indicate that long-term transfusion programs are effective in the prevention of recurrences.

His right visual acuity has disappeared after a traffic accident 5 years before, and he had hit his forehead again 3 years previously. He experienced severe headache twice for 2 weeks after his admission. He was transferred to Kanagawa Rehabilitation Center to be treated with intravascular surgery.

Forty-three patients with brain attack were examined with CE-MRA. A tracker volume of SmartPrep technique was placed along the ascending aorta in the coronal image. After the bolus injection of gadolinium, an increase in signal that corresponded to the arrival of gadolinium was used to trigger centric re-ordered spoiled gradient echo arterial selective MRA with imaging time of 20-40 sec. We were able to achieve a 100% successful triggering rate of SmartPrep technique and selectively arterial-phase carotid and vertebral arteries with almost no venous contamination could be delineated. These techniques enabled high resolution imaging of entire craniocervical arteries from aortic arch to the circle of Willis.

The case was that of a female aged 51 who was hospitalized with the chief complaint of consciousness disorder. The patient was discharged from the hospital 1 year before, after undergoing subtotal extirpation of a tumor through the transsphenoidal sinus in a case of pituitary adenoma, and post-operative radiotherapy (topical 50 Gy). Mild hyperlipidemia associated with hypothyroidism was observed by blood biochemical test during the patient's hospitalization, and multiple cerebral infarction was also observed by CT scanning and MR imaging. Therefore, conservative treatments including intensified endocrine-supplementing treatment, centering on thyroid hormone, were attempted. The patient's thyroid gland function and hyperlipidemia improved but the consciousness disorder persisted. Exacerbation of the consciousness disorder occurred suddenly 6 weeks after the patient's hospitalization. Subarachnoid hemorrhage and hydrocephalus were observed by CT scanning. Cerebral angiography detected a saccular aneurysm in the trifurcation of the right middle cerebral artery, 3 fusiform aneurysms in the periphery of the right middle cerebral artery, 2 fusiform aneurysms in the posterior cerebral artery and irregularity of wall width in the central artery including the terminal region of the internal carotid artery. These findings were not observed at the initial hospitalization and were considered to have been formed newly afterwards. Further, these findings were observed unexceptionally in all the radiated fields. The patient died 8 weeks after hospitalization, and no autopsy finding was obtained.

Hyperviscosity and hypoperfusion enhance thrombus formation promoting embolization of fresh thrombi. Hypoperfusion also reduces dissolution of emboli due to reduced flow velocity leading to classic hemodynamic patterns of stroke. To prove this concept further, we identified patients with severe hemodynamic compromise of either arterial or venous origin, or both, and natural or iatrogenic mechanisms of embolism. Three conditions were investigated in a stroke MRI protocol: 5 patients who had conventional cerebral angiography for the diagnosis of moyamoya disease, 1 patient with atrial fibrillation and thrombosis of the left transverse dural sinus and 1 patient with a patent foramen ovale with atrial septum aneurysm presenting with thrombosis of cortical cerebral veins.

CD009372,0,19306644,0,[Detection of intraplaque hemorrhage with use of screening black-blood MRI].,"The evaluation of plaque characteritics as well as the degree of luminal narrowing is important in the management of carotid stenosis. Several reports have shown that intraplaque hemorrhage (IPH), which plays a pivotal role in plaque vulnerability, emits high signal intensity on T1-weighted images of high-resolution black-blood (BB) MRIs. When an MRI is used to screen for vulnerable plaque, a short scanning duration and a simple MRI protocol are required. This study assessed the utility of screening BB-MRI to detect IPH. Ninety-three consecutive cases with atherosclerotic carotid stenosis scheduled for carotid endarterectomy (CEA) or carotid artery stenting between January 2005 and December 2007 were included. High-resolution BB-MRI scans were obtained with 2D double-inversion recovery fast spin-echo sequences with cardiac gating. Screening BB-MRIs were performed with 3D gradient-echo sequences suppressing blood flow signals by radiofrequency wave spatial saturation over the scanning field of 3D time-of-flight MRA. The relative overall plaque signal intensities with reference to the sternocleidomastoid muscle were calculated, and the correlation of intensities on T1-weighted images between high-resolution BB-MRI and screening BB-MRI was investigated. We excluded 50 cases because of restenosis following CEA, use of a pacemaker, a long interval (>10 days) between high-resolution and screening BB-MRI examinations, or poor-quality images. Among the 43 cases included, the relative overall plaque signal intensity of high-resolution BB-MRI and screening BB-MRI were closely correlated (r = 0.568, p < 0.001). Screening BB-MRI can be an alternative to high-resolution BB-MRI in the assessment of IPH and may be a useful tool for detection of vulnerable plaque."

She had suffered from cerebral hemorrhage of the left putamen at the age of 58, of the left parietal lobe at 64 and cerebral infarction of right internal capsule at 71. EDS type II or III was suggested by two times of skin biopsies. A brain CT at the age of 73 revealed a comparatively large cerebral aneurysm in the territory of the anterior cerebral artery. The patient was treated conservatively, but died due to rupture of the aneurysm. The wall of the aneurysm was made up thin collagen fibers without elastic fibers. There were other multiple small aneurysms in the cerebral arteries, but none in other organs. Deposition of acid mucopolysaccharides was noted in the media of the abdominal aorta. Finally, the present case was thought most likely to be of EDS type IV. It was suggested that one of the causes of the cerebral hemorrhage at the ages of 58 and 64 and the infarction at 71 was related to hypertension, since brain MR angiography at 71 showed no clear aneurysms. In cases of EDS, one should consider the possible formation or rupture of cerebral aneurysm even though the course is favorable."
CD009372,0,9773641,0,[Reasons against lumbar puncture diagnosis with cerebrospinal fluid drainage in subarachnoid hemorrhage].,"The necessity of cerebral angiography or angio-MRI was assessed in patients with thunderclap headache in whom subarachnoid haemorrhage had been ruled out on CT findings. In this cases the cerebrospinal fluid examination could be dangerous because could reduce the intracranial pressure with consequent risk of aneurysm rupture. CSF drainage, although, improves the clinical conditions and the symptoms of the patients, seems to not reduce the incidence of permanent neurological deficits caused by vasospasm; on the contrary, it increases the incidence of hydrocephalus requiring shunt procedures. We conclude that routine ventriculostomy with external ventricular drainage should be considered for all patients with altered sensorium and acute hyrocephalus following subarachnoid haemorrhage, with improvement in outcome."

She presented with sudden onset of headache. Computed tomography demonstrated diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage, and cerebral angiography disclosed a left anterior choroidal artery aneurysm. The aneurysm was treated by endovascular embolization with Guglielmi detachable coils. During the embolization procedure, the microcatheter perforated the aneurysm. For direct closure of the perforation site with coils, the microcatheter was withdrawn and coils were deployed partially in the subarachnoid space and partially in the aneurysm sac. The coil mass was spread in the subarachnoid space around the aneurysm immediately after embolization. The patient was discharged with no neurological deficit. Three months later, follow-up radiography demonstrated obvious reduction in the size and compaction of the coil mass. Magnetic resonance angiography and digital subtraction angiography demonstrated stable occlusion of the aneurysm. The coil mass probably spread in the cistern around the aneurysm and was compacted by the shape memory of the coils and pulsation of the brain and vessels, as the subarachnoid clots around the aneurysm had disappeared. This case suggests that cisternal coil migration should be considered in the follow up of intracranial aneurysm treated with detachable coils."

CD009372,0,22015965,0,Hyperdensity on non-contrast CT immediately after intra-arterial revascularization.,"Non-contrast enhanced computed tomography (NCCT) is usually performed to estimate bleeding complications immediately after procedures. However, hyperdense areas on NCCT have not yet been understood; different interpretations have been reported in the literature. It remains unclear whether NCCT performed immediately after intra-arterial revascularization (IAR) could be useful for predicting hemorrhagic transformation (HT) or clinical outcomes. Therefore, we investigated the diagnostic values of hyperdense areas on NCCT images obtained immediately after IAR. This was a retrospective study of acute ischemic stroke patients who underwent IAR between October 2007 and December 2010. NCCT scans were routinely obtained immediately after IAR and additional follow-up imaging protocols included diffusion weighted imaging (DWI)/gradient echo imaging (GRE) 24 h after IAR. HT was assessed by means of GRE obtained 24 h after IAR. Hounsfield Unit (HU) of the hyperdensity was measured in the manually drawn regions of interest. A total of 68 patients were analyzed in this study. Twenty-nine patients (42.6%) developed HT on follow-up images. Thirty-eight patients had hyperdense areas on NCCT immediately after IAR. Hyperdensity on NCCT performed immediately after IAR revealed 23 (60.5%) of the 38 patients with six false negative areas. NCCT performed immediately after IAR showed a sensitivity of 79.3%, a specificity of 61.5%, a positive predictive value of 60.5% and a negative predictive value of 80% for HT. The HU value was a predictor of HT without statistical significance (area under curve of 0.629; 95% CI: 0.49-0.76; p = 0.068). In addition, an HU of >90 poorly predicted HT with a low sensitivity (23%) and a high specificity (94%). In conclusion, our results showed that although hyperdensity on NCCT images obtained immediately after IAR had a moderate predictive value for HT, there were limitations to the prediction of subsequent parenchymal hematoma and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, with a low specificity and a low positive predictive value."
CD009372,0,8090273,0,[A case of polycystic kidney associated with new growth of cerebral aneurysm after aneurysmal operation].,"We have encountered a 66-year-old woman with a polycystic kidney (PCK). This was combined with the fact that the new growth of an aneurysm at the left anterior cerebral artery (A2-A3 junction) had ruptured 3 years after an operation for a right IC-PC aneurysm in 1985. The cause of the neogenesis and enlargement of an intracranial aneurysm is important because of the changes in the arterial wall due to congenital factors, hypertension, arteriosclerosis, etc, or hemodynamic stress caused by hypertension. We suspected that intracranial aneurysm formation was caused by hypertension due to PCK and the intracranial aneurysm is explained as being due to maldevelopment. In patients with PCK, it should be kept in mind that intracranial aneurysms may be present, and it is advisable to use cerebral angiography and MRA to see whether this is so or not. It should be also stressed that the control of hypertension is very important for the prognosis of patients with PCK. Not only new growth of cerebral aneurysms but also intracerebral hemorrhage is to be prevented."
CD009372,0,9819505,0,Primary intraventricular hemorrhage in adult--an analysis of 24 cases.,"Primary intraventricular hemorrhage in adults is rare, comprising only about 3.1 % of all intracranial hemorrhage. One of the major management tasks is to find out whether the hemorrhage is secondary to underlying structural vascular abnormality, such as arteriovenous malformation (AVM) and aneurysm, so that appropriate treatment can be carried out to prevent rebleeding. We retrospectively analyzed 24 patients with computerized tomography findings of intraventricular hemorrhage in our hospital from 1991 to 1996. Cerebral angiography was performed in eighteen patients. Eight patients (57%) had positive angiographic findings (five were AVM and three were aneurysm). The angiographic yield was five of seven patients (72%) younger than 45 years of age and three of eleven (27%) older than 45 years of age. On the basis of our results, we suggest that cerebral angiography should be considered for all primary intraventricular hemorrhage patients who are younger than 45 years old."

She was admitted to the department of pediatric hematology with a severe headache, vomiting, and progressive right flaccid hemiplegia and lethargy. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan showed subdural hematoma in posterior parietal region of the brain and impending cerebellar herniation. She was given fresh-frozen plasma (FFP) and then activated factor VII (rFVIIa), 80 microg/kg was infused for replacement of von Willebrand factor. The subdural hematoma was emergently drained. The results of coagulation tests before infusion of FFP and rFVIIa revealed hypofibrinogenemia, and FFP was given every 48 hours. The patient recovered dramatically in a few days. Five days after rFVIIa infusion, a magnetic resonance angiography-proven right middle cerebral arterial thrombosis developed. It is an interesting point of discussion whether the middle cerebral arterial thrombosis was provoked as a consequence of rFVIIa and FFP infusion."
CD009372,0,1256646,0,Cerebral cortical arteries in the diagnosis of epidural hematoma.,"Review of cerebral arteriograms of all our patients [19] with epidural hematoma over a 2 year period revealed evidence of localized extrinsic compression of the cerebral cortex in all cases. This finding, although not as specific as those previously described for epidural hematoma, was strongly suggestive. A 2 year prospective study was then initiated employing internal, rather than common carotid arteriography, because opacification of the external carotid artery is not necessary for evaluation of cortical compression. In this study, which consisted of 21 patients, epidural hematoma was correctly diagnosed in all, relying primarily on signs of localized extrinisic cerebral cortical compression. No epidural hematoma was misinterpreted as being a subdural hematoma or an intracerebral injury, and all epidural hematomas that were present were diagnosed correctly. We conclude that internal carotid arteriography is a sensitive method for diagnosing epidural hematoma. The signs of extrinsic cortical compression should be emphasized in the interpretation of arteriograms of patients with head injuries whether the internal or the common carotid artery is injected."
CD009372,0,21975501,0,The role of imaging studies for evaluation of stroke in children.,"Stroke is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in children and long-term neurological deficits. Although cerebrovascular disorders occur less often in children than in adults, recognition of stroke in children has probably increased because of the widespread application of noninvasive diagnostic studies such as magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography.Computed tomography (CT) should be the first imaging choice in the emergency setting when stroke is suspected. It will show the presence of hemorrhage (eg, bleeding from arteriovenous malformation). It is often normal within the first hours in arterial ischemic stroke. As in adults, magnetic resonance imaging is the neuroimaging modality to confirm the clinical diagnosis of ischemic stroke. In children, however, magnetic resonance imaging requires sedation and may not be as readily available as CT. Perfusion imaging demonstrates flow within the brain and can detect areas that are at risk of ischemia; however, further studies in the pediatric population need to be validated for this technique in children. Angiography detects arterial disease (eg, aneurysm); however, its use has been largely superseded by better magnetic resonance angiography, which is sensitive enough to visualize lesions in the proximal anterior cerebral artery, middle cerebral artery, and distal internal carotid artery (ICA). Magnetic resonance imaging using diffusion- weighted imaging is the most versatile and sensitive imaging technique for identifying ischemic lesions. In the future, we need to identify the pediatric patient presenting to the emergency department with an acute stroke and develop a pathway for the use of particular imaging techniques (eg, CT vs magnetic resonance imaging)."

The diagnosis of HELLP syndrome was confirmed by elevated liver enzymes, low platelets, increased total bilirubin and increased lactate dehydrogenase. The intracranial haematoma was removed with good neurological recovery ensuing.

CD009372,0,23945642,0,The emerging role of ferumoxytol-enhanced MRI in the management of cerebrovascular lesions.,"Inflammation is increasingly being understood to be a key component to the pathophysiology of cerebrovascular lesions. Ferumoxytol, an iron oxide nanoparticle coated by a carbohydrate shell, has been used in MRI studies as an inflammatory marker because it is cleared by macrophages. Ferumoxytol-enhanced MRI has emerged as an important tool for noninvasive assessment of the inflammatory status of cerebrovascular lesions, namely aneurysms and arteriovenous malformations. Moreover, preliminary evidence suggests that ferumoxytol-enhanced MRI could be applied as a non-invasive tool to differentiate ""unstable"" lesions that require early intervention from ""stable"" lesions in which observation may be safe. Assessment of the effects of anti-inflammatory pharmacological interventions on cerebrovascular lesions is also a potentially crucial application of the technique. Future improvements in technique and MRI signal quantification will certainly pave the way for widespread and efficient use of ferumoxytol-enhanced MRI in clinical practice. In this paper, we review current data regarding ferumoxytol-enhanced MRI and discuss its current/potential applications and future perspectives."
CD009372,0,1725812,0,Dynamic computed tomography for the evaluation of cerebrovascular disease.,"Dynamic computed tomography (DCT) was evaluated as a diagnostic indicator for chronic supratentorial ischemia in 50 cases with or without minor neurological deficits. Peak height (PH, the maximum value of the gamma fitted curve), peak time (PT, the time to PH from the start of DCT), transit time (TT, the time between the first and second inflection points of the gamma fitted curve), and their functional maps were analyzed. Cerebral angiography was then performed in all cases to identify stenotic or occlusive vascular lesions in major cerebral arteries. DCT clearly detected 12 of 13 occlusions of the internal carotid artery (ICA) or middle cerebral artery (MCA), although one ICA occlusion was masked by the contralateral MCA occlusion. However, DCT detected only severe ICA or MCA stenosis (more than 90%). Probably, stenotic lesions of less than 90% did not cause detectable hemodynamic compromise. DCT using PH, PT, and TT functional maps is a useful diagnostic method for hemodynamic changes in ischemic cerebrovascular disease, although bilateral lesions and less stenotic lesions (less than 90%) are difficult to detect."

CD009372,0,8333305,0,Intraventricular haemorrhage caused by aneurysms and angiomas.,"More than 200 intraventricular haematomas (IVH) have been treated in the Homburg Neurosurgical University Clinic since computed tomography was available and facilitated the diagnosis. Among 200 consecutive cases, which are analysed and presented in this publication, there were 71 patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH)--58 of whom with angiographically and/or pathologically verified aneurysms--, and 21 cases with intraventricular angiomas. IVH without concomitant intracerebral haematoma (ICH) and without evidence of SAH is highly suggestive of intraventricular angioma. In our experience panangiography [if available digital subtraction angiography (DAS)] should be done as soon as possible in all cases of IVH. It is a precondition for early diagnosis and operative elimination of the source of bleeding, because the retrospective analysis of our material shows that rebleeding is by far the highest single risk factor in cases with IVH caused by aneurysms or angiomas. We therefore recommend early microsurgical occlusion of the aneurysms and exstirpation or intravascular embolisation of the angioma. The best survival rate (76%) was achieved in IVH cases caused by angiomas. In aneurysms with IVH the survival rate was 35%, in IVH caused by other diseases 37%. The worst prognosis occurs in SAH with IVH without proven aneurysm or angioma. The survival rate of this group was only 8%."
CD009372,0,15662247,0,Computed tomography and magnetic resonance angiography in cervicocranial vascular disease.,"Although catheter angiography, or digital subtraction angiography (DSA), is still regarded as the gold standard for imaging of cervicocranial vascular disease, its morbidity, cost, and time-consuming features have prompted the development of noninvasive techniques based on computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging. With the advent of powerful software, CT and magnetic resonance angiography are complementing and, in some cases, even replacing DSA in the diagnostic evaluation of carotid atherostenosis, unruptured aneurysms, dissections, stroke, penetrating trauma to the neck, and dural venous sinus occlusive disease. They offer advantages over DSA not only in reduced morbidity and time-saving but also in assessment of brain parenchyma, quantitative perfusion, and abnormalities of vessel walls. In the evaluation of blunt neck injuries and intracranial vascular malformations, fistulas, and vasculitis, CT and magnetic resonance angiography still do not provide as much information as DSA."

X-ray of the skull showed no fracture but CT scans demonstrated a large frontal hematoma and interhemispheric bleeding. Initial cerebral angiography performed within 12 hours of trauma showed a small protrusion on the pericallosal portion of the left pericallosal artery with no branching point nearby. Angiography was repeated on the 9th day after admission and confirmed the presence of a saccular aneurysm of the pericallosal artery, which had been visible as a small protrusion on the initial angiogram. Traumatic aneurysm was suspected and successful neck clipping of the aneurysm was performed on the 14th day.

The results of R.A. and D.C.W. were compared with those of contrast carotid-angiography (C.A.). C.A. revealed stenosis above 50% or complete occlusion in 22% of cases, whereas D.C.W. and R.A. showed flow reduction in 27% and 48% of the cases respectively. In T.I.A., C.A. positivity went down to 8%; D.C.W. to 16%; and R.A. to 34%. In ""Complete Stroke"" positivity was 36% for C.A.; 41% for D.C.W.; and 62% for R.A. There was a high number of false positive findings with D.C.W. (8) but even more with R.A. (27). False negative findings occurred only in two cases with R.A. These data confirm the diagnostic value of these two noninvasive techniques to identify haemodynamically carotid stenosis. The use of both methods can reduce error due to false negativity. The rather marked frequency of false positivity, particularly with reference to R.A. doesn't affect the diagnostic value of the two methods."

MR consistently demonstrated the major intracranial arteries and showed three cases with occlusion and three with stenosis of either the internal carotid or middle cerebral arteries. Infarctions were better delineated on MR but were also seen on CT. Seven cases with and two without stroke had high-signal white matter lesions on MR. Further research using cranial MR to develop noninvasive means of identifying sickle cell patients at risk for stroke is warranted."
CD009372,0,22994214,0,"Advanced multimodal CT/MRI approaches to hyperacute stroke diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring.","Multimodal CT/MRI has dramatically changed the approach to ischemic stroke management, as noninvasive CT/MRI images detail brain tissue or parenchyma, angiography or vessel status, and collateral perfusion or blood flow in regions of the brain vulnerable to ischemic injury. Such snapshots of the dynamic process of cerebral ischemia may be used to gauge reversibility and therapeutic opportunities. Treatment of acute stroke may be rapidly tailored to clinical scenarios based on imaging correlation of ischemia, vessel status, and perfusion. Serial or repeated imaging from the initial presentation to later stages of the hospital course may illustrate infarct growth, persisting occlusion, reocclusion, recanalization, reperfusion, and hemorrhagic transformation. From acute stroke to rehabilitation phases and subsequent prevention, multimodal CT/MRI has emerged as a key tool to track the process of stroke and the impact of our therapeutic interventions."

We present a detailed history and clinical course of a patient with PCNSV along with a literature review. A 50-year-old Chinese female presented with a 6-month history of mild to moderate headache and sudden onset of visual loss. Early computed tomography of the brain showed multifocal infarctions. Over 3 weeks after admission, her clinical presentations changed considerably and her condition deteriorated. She became confused then fell in to semicoma, and developed left-sided paralysis and quadriparesis. At about 7 months after her illness, a magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed a tumour-like mass lesion within the right parietal lobe resulting in compressed posterior horn of the right lateral ventricle. In the end, a brain biopsy identified extensive vessel inflammation, which established the diagnosis of PCNSV. Steroid and immunosuppressive therapy dramatically improved the patient's condition. Our report highlights the importance of considering PCNSV as a differential diagnosis in patients who are suspected with encephalitis, multiple sclerosis, cerebral haemorrhage, cerebral thrombus, leukoencephalopathy, or brain tumour, etc. while their clinical presentations are exceptionally so changeable.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between renal function and intracranial arterial stenosis (IAS). We analyzed the records of 283 stroke-free Korean adults (≥45 years of age) who underwent brain 3D time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography as part of their voluntary health check. The presence of stenosis in the basilar artery and in the horizontal portion of the middle cerebral artery was defined as narrowing of the luminal diameter by 25% or more or occlusion on brain magnetic resonance angiography. We estimated the glomerular filtration rate using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation. The subjects were 133 men and 150 women (mean age of 56 ± 7 years). One hundred sixty-six subjects (59 %) had IAS. The serum creatinine concentration in the highest quartile compared with the lowest quartile was associated with increased prevalence of IAS; the eGFR in the upper two quartiles compared with the lowest quartile were associated with decreased prevalence of IAS. The prevalence of subjects with a high eGFR decreased significantly with the severity of IAS. In conclusion, poor renal function is associated with the presence and the degree of IAS in stroke-free Korean adults."

CD009372,0,3357564,0,Dynamic CT of micro- and macroangiopathic states of the cerebrum.,"Dynamic computed tomography utilizing intravenous contrast agents affords a unique opportunity to evaluate pathologic vascular states of the cerebrum in cross-section with an imaging system which is more contrast-sensitive than either conventional film-screen or digital subtraction angiography. Dynamic scanning therefore routinely allows the non-invasive detection of pathologic vascularity in-vivo in lesions that could previously only be detected reliably primarily with in-vitro techniques. The first section of this two part report examines the microscopic vascularity observed in active demyelination, inflammatory states, trauma, infarction and other forms of acquired cerebral disease. In the second section, the ability of intravenous dynamic cranial computed tomography to detect macroscopic pathologic vascularity is reviewed. The diagnostic principles of conventional angiography apply in this technique except that the lesion is viewed in cross-section, rather than in-toto with all structures superimposed. The method therefore yields a true tomographic angiogram. Abnormal vascular states associated with malignancies, vascular malformations, aneurysms, and vascular occlusions are simply evaluated and correlate precisely with the aberrant vascular patterns revealed angiographically."

CD009372,0,21878694,0,[Diagnostic imaging of cerebrovascular disease on multi-detector row computed tomography (MDCT)].,"In this study, we reviewed characteristic diagnostic findings of vascular diseases in the central nervous system with 3-dimensional computed tomographic angiography (3D-CTA) using multi-detector row computed tomography (MDCT) and a novel 320-row area detector CT (320-ADCT). With coverage of 160 mm in a single rotation, 320-ADCT enables acquisition of both 4-dimensional CT angiography (dynamic 4D-CTA) and whole-brain CT perfusion imaging. We describe our experience of investigating cerebrovascular diseases with MDCT and 320-ADCT, as well as several postprocessing techniques to acquire images useful for diagnosis, therapy planning, and simulation of neurosurgical and endovascular intervention. 3D-CTA demonstrates has high accuracy in detecting and evaluating cerebral aneurysms and steno-occlusive diseases. Angiographic analysis, including information of surrounding tissues on 3D-CTA, allows assessment of the feasibility of neurosurgical or endovascular approaches and the technique to accomplish the therapy. However, 3D-CTA using MDCT is limited in its detection of aneurysms less than 3 mm in size and aneurysms embedded in the skull base region. In addition, discrimination between intradural paraclinoid aneurysms and extradural intracavernous aneurysms remains an unresolved problem in imaging of cerebral aneurysms. 320-ADCT may solve this problem with its high accuracy in discriminating arteries from the venous system. 3D-CTA could be used as an alternative to DSA for detection of severe carotid artery disease. 3D-CTA enables measurement of the lesions, plaque imaging, prediction of anatomical variants, screening for asymptomatic vascular lesions, and exclusion of patients with risk factors from carotid endoarterectomy (CEA) or carotid artery stenting (CAS). The diagnosis of intracranial dural arteriovenous fistula (DAVF) with CTA is challenging. Recently, several authors proposed diagnostic findings of ADVF by CTA and reported high sensitivity and specificity. 320-ADCT may offer comprehensive information for diagnosis and therapy planning of intracranial DAVF. Although DSA is a standard modality to detect spinal vascular malformations, selective catheterization requires considerable time and a certain amount of contrast medium, and is associated with a risk of neurological complications. Spinal 3D-CTA prior to DSA is useful in selective catheterization to arteries at certain spinal levels as well as when considering treatment options and therapy planning."
CD009372,0,21878697,0,[Progress in NIRS monitoring of cerebral blood flow].,"Various studies have demonstrated the usefulness of near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) for detecting cerebral ischemia during a carotid endarterectomy; however, it is difficult to apply NIRS to the diagnosis of ischemic stroke, since commercially available NIRS, which uses continuous-wave light, does not provide quantitative values of baseline hemoglobin (Hb) concentrations. In contrast, time-resolved near-infrared spectroscopy (TRS) permits quantitative measurement of Hb concentrations. We applied TRS to detection of cerebra vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). We investigated 11 age-matched controls and 14 aneurysmal SAH patients that comprised 10 patients with World Federation of Neurological Societies (WFNS) grade V and 4 patients with WFNS grade II. Employing TR-NIRS, we measured the cortical oxygen saturation (CoSO2) and baseline Hb concentrations in the middle cerebral artery territory. The CoSO2 and Hb concentrations remained stable after SAH in 6 patients; digital subtraction angiography (DSA) did not reveal vasospasm in these patients. In 8 patients, however, CoSO2 and total Hb decreased abruptly between 5 and 9 days after SAH. DSA revealed diffuse vasospasms in 6 of 8 patients. The reduction of CoSO2 predicted occurrence of vasospasm at a cutoff value of 3.9%-6.4% with 100% sensitivity and 85.7% specificity. Trans cranial Doppler (TCD) failed to detect vasospasm in 4 cases, whereas TR-NIRS could. Finally, TRS performed on day 1 after SAH revealed significantly higher CoSO2 than that of the controls (p = 0.048), but there was no significant difference in total Hb. TRS detected vasospasm by evaluating the CBO in the cortex and may be more sensitive than TCD, which assesses the blood flow velocity in the M1 portion. TRS may be useful for the diagnosis of ischemic events in stroke patients."

A CT scan and MRI showed a cerebral hematoma located in the right frontoparietal region. Twelve days later he was transferred to our hospital. Although a CT scan, MRI, and cerebral angiography were repeated, they did not reveal any abnormality regarding an etiology. Only persistently abnormal finding in laboratory studies was positive for lupus anticoagulant and anticardiolipin antibody, i.e. antiphospholipid antibodies. There was no serological evidence of SLE or other autoimmune diseases. Stereotactic biopsy of the hematoma wall and scalp artery showed no abnormality. Based on above findings we conclude that antiphospholipid antibodies have played an important role for the hemorrhage.

By calculating the annual growth rate of aneurysms in long-term follow-up angiography (partly supplemented with MR-imaging and/or MR-angiography), we attempted to determine the surgical indications for these aneurysms. Long-term follow-up angiography ranging from one to 20 years was carried out on five patients whose ruptured aneurysms had been incompletely occluded, six patients with multiple aneurysms, of which the ruptured ones had been completely obliterated at operation and the small unruptured aneurysms, missed or misdiagnosed, and eight patients with unruptured aneurysms which were asymptomatic or symptomatic. The correlation of annual aneurysm growth rate to subsequent bleeding was investigated. Four out of six fast-growing aneurysms with high annual growth rates (more than 8% increase per year) resulted in subsequent bleeding whereas none of the fourteen slow-growing aneurysms with low annual growth rates (less than 8% increase per year) led to bleeding (Fisher's exact test; p < 0.01). Hypertension, patient age and aneurysmal location showed no significant correlation to the annual growth rate (Fisher's exact test; p > 0.05). This study suggests that aneurysmal rests after incomplete surgery and missed or misdiagnosed multiple or incidental aneurysms which are fast growing have a high possibility of subsequent bleeding and should be operated on as soon as possible."

This gave rise to the suspicion of a spontaneously ruptured cerebral aneurysm that might have caused the patient's accident. Preceding the evacuation of the hematoma, cerebral angiography ruled out the suspected vascular malformation, but revealed a pseudoaneurysm of the middle meningeal artery close to a skull fracture. Intraoperatively, this lesion proved to be the source of the bleeding which was exclusively directed towards the intradural space.

CD009372,0,8166011,0,Fibromuscular dysplasia of arteries of the head and neck: imaging findings.,"Cephalocervical fibromuscular dysplasia is an uncommon vascular disease that affects less than 1% of the population. Although often an incidental finding, patients may present with transient ischemic attacks, cerebral infarctions, or subarachnoid hemorrhage. Fibromuscular dysplasia is usually diagnosed in the fourth or fifth decade of life; it occurs in women more often than in men and in whites more frequently than in blacks. The purpose of this essay is to illustrate the broad spectrum of neuroimaging findings seen on CT scans, MR images, and angiograms of patients with cephalocervical fibromuscular dysplasia. The value of MR imaging in distinguishing tubular fibromuscular dysplasia from arterial dissection and arterial hypoplasia is demonstrated."

They were shown to have dural arteriovenous fistulae related to the cavernous sinus. Intracerebral haemorrhage occurred in both patients within 18 months of presentation; this gave rise to focal seizures and signs of unilateral hemisphere dysfunction. The haematomas were in the region drained by the superficial middle cerebral vein ipsilateral to the shunt and are presumed to have been the result of locally raised venous pressure."
CD009372,0,9766041,0,Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography of cerebral arteries. A review.,"The loss of blood vessel visibility due to the signal saturation of slow flow can be partially overcome by the T1 reduction that occurs with the use of contrast agents such as Gd-DTPA during magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) studies. Dynamic-imaging techniques that have been applied successfully in abdominal imaging may also be useful for intracranial applications. However, the time between arterial and venous enhancement is very short during intracranial circulation. This limits the spatial resolution that can be obtained between arterial and venous enhancement. Fortunately, the blood-brain barrier and the relatively long duration of significant decrease in blood T1 has led to the development of very high resolution intracranial MRA techniques. Knowledge of the contrast-agent dilution factors and the ultimate resulting relaxation rates can be used to optimize the imaging parameters to maximize vessel signal relative to the background signal (the signal-difference-to-noise ratio). The additional venous vascular detail in the contrast-enhanced study can be spatially resolved in the 3D image data and determined by incorporating information from both high-resolution precontrast and postcontrast studies. In this article, the history, development and application of contrast agents in MRA are presented."

CD009372,0,22271362,0,Spot sign score predicts rapid bleeding in spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage.,"This study was conducted to determine whether spot sign score correlates with average rate of hematoma expansion and whether average rate of expansion predicts in-hospital mortality and clinical outcome in spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). The study included 367 patients presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) from January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2008 with nontraumatic ICH. All received noncontrast computed tomography (NCCT) of the head and multidetector CT angiography (MDCTA) on presentation to the ED and a follow-up NCCT within 48 h. Imaging was used to determine the hematoma location and volume, average rate of expansion, and spot sign score. Primary outcome measures included in-hospital mortality and clinical outcome based on modified Rankin Scale at 3 months or at discharge. Regression analysis was performed to correlate spot sign score and average rate of hematoma expansion. ICH expansion was identified in 194 of 367 patients (53%). In a multivariate analysis, rate of ICH expansion predicted mortality (hazard ratio 1.1, CI 1.08-1.12, p < 0.0001). Patients who expired had an average rate of ICH expansion of 2.8 ml/h compared to 0.2 ml/h in survivors. Spot sign score on presentation to the ED correlated with the average rate of hematoma expansion. Average rate of hematoma expansion predicts mortality in spontaneous ICH. Spot sign score on presentation correlates with rate of expansion, supporting the hypothesis that high spot sign scores likely reflect active bleeding in acute ICH."

CD009372,0,18812685,0,Cervical perimedullary arteriovenous fistula in an infant presenting with subarachnoid hemorrhage--case report.,"A 9-month-old boy was transferred to our institute after suffering sudden seizure and loss of consciousness followed by cardiopulmonary arrest. Neurological examination on admission revealed deep coma and tetraparesis. Brain computed tomography revealed diffuse intracranial subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), whereas brain magnetic resonance (MR) angiography showed no intracranial abnormalities. MR imaging of the spine demonstrated a remarkable flow void extending from C3 to T1. Digital subtraction angiography revealed a perimedullary arteriovenous fistula (AVF) fed by the left thyrocervical trunk, associated with a varix and a dilated perimedullary vein. He had hypoxic encephalopathy due to transient cardiopulmonary arrest, and remained in the intensive care unit for 2 months. Thereafter, he was transferred to the pediatric ward, where his general condition improved, and after 7 months underwent embolization of the AVF to prevent further SAH. The perimedullary AVF was successfully interrupted by transarterial embolization with n-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate and platinum coils, and no additional neurological deficits developed. Post-embolization MR imaging showed loss of the flow void. The favorable outcome demonstrates the importance of spinal cord imaging in infants with SAH without other intracranial abnormalities to detect the presence of perimedullary AVF. Perimedullary AVFs in children are often associated with huge fistulas and varices, so are good candidates for endovascular surgery."

CD009372,0,9673972,0,[Extravasation of contrast medium in local intra-arterial fibrinolysis of the carotid territory].,"The safety of fibrinolytic therapy is determined with the incidence of intraparenchymatous hemorrhage. When interpreting CT studies after local intra-arterial fibrinolysis (LIF) in the carotid territory, one must consider that a hyperdense lesion may also be caused by extravasation of contrast material during angiography. In this study we retrospectively analyzed CT scans of 24 patients performed within 24 h after LIF and correlated the results with clinical and angiographic findings before and after therapy. Three of 24 patients (12.5%) showed striatocapsular parenchymal hematomas, 2 patients died and 1 showed marked clinical deterioration. Fifteen of 24 patients (62.5%) showed hyperdense lesions without space-occupying effect within striatocapsular infarctions. In 6 of these patients (25%) these lesions were attributable to an extravasation of contrast medium during angiography. This extravasation required at least partial recanalization of the middle cerebral artery and always occurred within a striatocapsular infarction. The pathogenesis of extravasation of contrast medium during local intra-arterial fibrinolysis is unknown. The identification of these lesions, however, is essential for the assessment of safety of local intra-arterial fibrinolysis."

The diagnosis of SAH rested on a typical history and the demonstration of blood in the cerebrospinal fluid (computed tomography (CT), lumbar puncture). Initial CT and four-vessel angiography were performed in all patients, and five had repeat angiography. Endocrinological assessment was done after the initial angiography, and abnormal findings from this first study were reassessed 3 months later. The follow-up study included a high resolution CT scan of the sellar region. One patient had panhypopituitarism. Insufficient growth hormone secretion alone or combined with a low plasma concentration of estradiol or testosterone was found in another seven patients. The sella was ballooned or enlarged in three patients, and four patients had at follow-up a partly empty sella. A spontaneous development of a partly empty sella from an adenoma with suprasellar extension was observed in the patient with panhypopituitarism. This patient had experienced pituitary apoplexy with resulting SAH. Based on sellar enlargement, an empty sella, and pituitary dysfunction, this pathogenesis was suggested in another three patients. Our findings suggest that hemorrhagic necrosis in a pituitary adenoma may be an important cause of SAH with normal angiography."

Case report.,"Intracranial dural arteriovenous fistula (DAVF) is rare and potentially life-threatening disease often presenting as vascular myelopathy. The early and proper diagnosis is challenging because the clinical manifestations are related to the distribution of the draining vein, not the fistula site, and imaging findings are similar to demyelinating disease of the spinal cord. The authors present the case of a 45-year-old man who developed acute progressive quadriplegia and respiratory difficulty with an enhancing, longitudinally extensive cervical cord lesion. These symptoms were highly suspicious for transverse myelitis but were caused by an intracranial DAVF. Intracranial DAVF with venous reflux to the brainstem and spinal cord is a rare but important differential diagnosis of progressive worsening myelopathy that is treatment resistant and gives the diagnostic impression of transverse myelitis."

A CT scan is the most sensitive method of detecting acute subarachnoid, parenchymal, and intraventricular hemorrhages. Small aneurysms are inconsistently visualized on MR scans. Angiography remains the standard for complete and accurate depiction of patent aneurysms, as well as of arteriovenous and venous malformations that have not thrombosed. Giant and thrombosed aneurysms present as mass lesions and are frequently detected when MR is used as a screening examination. Often MRI characterizes these lesions better than CT or angiography. Patients with vascular malformations who have focal neurologic symptoms without hemorrhage are best evaluated with MRI. Patent vascular malformations demonstrating flow void and other flow-related phenomena are readily demonstrated. Occult vascular malformations, including thrombosed arteriovenous, venous, and cavernous malformations and telangiectasia, are also best detected by MRI and are not visible on angiography."

Case 1: VS-3DCTA with volume rendering clearly showed carotid cave aneurysm of the internal carotid artery. The location and size of the aneurysm was confirmed by digital subtraction angiography (DSA). In evaluation of the aneurysm, VS-3DCTA was equal to DSA and endovascular findings. Case 2: VS-3DCTA with volume rendering clearly showed stenosis of the middle cerebral artery, and intramural calcification with the cause of the stenosis was subtracted. On the other hand, it was difficult for DSA to reveal the stenosis because of the limitation of the imaging angle. In evaluation of the stenosis, VS-3DCTA was superior to DSA. VS-3DCTA was an important diagnostic tool that enabled visualization of the aneurysm in the area of the skull base and stenosis of the intracerebral artery."
CD009372,0,7099381,0,[Traumatic aneurysm of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (author's transl)].,"The incidence of traumatic intracranial aneurysms are rare. In review of literature, only six cases of traumatic aneurysms in posterior fossa are reported. The patient, 15-year-old girl, was admitted on Dec. 18th, 1979, presented with unconsciousness after a traffic accident. She was developed impaired consciousness and left hemiparesis with right hemotympanum and nasal bleeding. Skull film showed an occipital linear fracture and a laminal fracture of the atlas. CT scan demonstrated traumatic subarachnoid, intraventricular hemorrhage and pneumocephalus. After accident, she regained consciousness with conservative therapy, but she deteriorated on the 10th hospitalized day. On the 17th day, lumbar puncture and CT scan revealed recurrent subarachnoid and intraventricular hemorrhage. The saccular aneurysm on the lateral medullary segment of the right posterior inferior cerebellar artery was obtained by cerebral angiogram on the 35th day. The configuration and size of the aneurysm was easily demonstrated by CT scans and cerebral angigrams. On the 43rd day, the clipping of the common trunk of the right posterior inferior cerebellar artery was employed. Her postoperative course was uneventful and she was discharged on the 97th day in good condition. This aneurysm was suggested to be induced by severe head injury with clinical ad operative findings. With the introduction of CT scan, CT scan is more available diagnostic modality than cerebral angiography in the follow up study with severe head injuries. And in the absence of pathological CT scan findings, suspicion of traumatic cerebrovascular impairments such as aneurysm should be paid. As the conservative management of traumatic intracranial aneurysms carries high mortality rate up to 30-50%, the prompt diagnosis and direct surgical intervention are recommended."

In 19 patients sodium levels fell below 130 mEq/l on at least two consecutive days. Hyponatremia developed at average 8.9 hospital day and lasted for 4.4 days. It was mild (126 to 130 mEq/l) in 15 patients, moderate (121 to 125 mEq/l) in 3 patients, and severe (116 to 120 mEq/l) in 1 patient. Cerebral vasospasm was evaluated by angiography, symptoms and CT finding. Angiographical vasospasm was found in 57 patients, symptomatic vasospasm in 38 patients and low density area on CT in 20 patients. Angiographical vasospasm developed in 15 of the 19 patients (78.9%) with hyponatremia, symptomatic vasospasm in 16 patients (84.2%), low density area on CT in 8 patients (42.1%), the difference being significantly high. (respectively, p < 0.01, p < 0.001 and p < 0.01 by chi-square test) Polyuria of 2500 ml or more immediately before the onset of hyponatremia developed in 14 patients (87.5%). When symptomatic vasospasm and hyponatremia coincided, there were only 4 patients in which symptomatic vasospasm was preceded by hyponatremia. So, it is difficult to predict the development of vasospasm from that of hyponatremia. This study found incidence of cerebral vasospasm after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage to be significantly higher in patients who developed hyponatremia, which raised suspicion about the presence of dehydration. Hyponatremia with central origin generally remains asymptomatic, but it is important to treat positively when the pathology of cerebral vasospasm is taken into consideration."

The tree-definition process can automatically exclude erroneous vessel segmentations. The parent-child connectivity information provided by our vessel trees is important to both surgical planning and to guidance of endovascular procedures. We evaluated the branch connection accuracy of our 3D vessel trees by asking two neuroradiologists to evaluate 140 parent-child connections comprising seven vascular trees against 17 digital subtraction angiography (DSA) views. Each reviewer rated each connection as (1) Correct, (2) Incorrect, (3) Partially correct (a minor error without clinical significance), or (4) Indeterminate. Analysis was summarized for each evaluator by calculating 95% confidence intervals for both the proportion completely correct and the proportion clinically acceptable (completely or partially correct). In order to protect the overall Type I error rate, alpha-splitting was done using a top down strategy. We additionally evaluated segmentation completeness by examining each slice in 11 MRA datasets in order to determine unlabeled vessels identifiable in cross-section following segmentation. Results indicate that only one vascular parent-child connection was judged incorrect by both reviewers. MRA segmentations appeared complete within MRA resolution limits. We conclude that our methods permit creation of detailed vascular trees from segmented 3D image data. We review the literature and compare other approaches to our own. We provide examples of clinically useful visualizations enabled by our methodology and taken from a visualization program now in clinical use."

Cranial magnetic resonance (MR) image obtained 4 weeks after the onset demonstrated intramural hematoma adjacent to intracranial left vertebral artery. MR image did not show any abnormal lesions in the brain parenchyma. Although cranial MR angiography did not show any definite aneurysms, three-dimensional CT angiography (3D-CTA) obtained 6 weeks after the onset disclosed an aneurysm of the left vertebral artery. The vessel distal to the aneurysm was occluded. Because the left posterior inferior cerebellar artery originated from the aneurysm, we did not perform embolization using coils. Spontaneous dissecting aneurysm of the left vertebral artery was diagnosed based on the clinical, MR image, and 3D-CTA findings. The systolic blood pressure was maintained under 130 mmHg using antihypertensive agents. Thereafter, 3D-CTA obtained 6 months after the onset showed recanalization of the occluded vessel distal to the aneurysm. The size of the aneurysm was unchanged.

Combined Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD)-perfusion experiments were applied in order to evaluate the relative sensitivity of these techniques to task-related reductions in cerebral blood flow (CBF). Results shows that, by matching the sensitivity of the methods (which exhibit a different contrast-to-noise ratio) in the primary motor cortex, the spatial extent of the regions of decreased perfusion signal is larger than those of the BOLD signal reduction. The above finding suggests that perfusion imaging, that already represents a gold standard method in the detection of vascular phenomena, may estimate task-related flow decreases in a functional time-series better than BOLD."

Over a 10-year period, we retrospectively assessed the prevalence, clinical manifestations, management, and outcome of cerebral vasculopathy in children with neurofibromatosis type 1. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain was performed on 78% of the patients (312/398) of which 46% (143/312) had magnetic resonance angiography of the intracranial arteries; 4.8% (15/312) had cerebral vasculopathy. Approximately half were asymptomatic at presentation; none had neurologic deficits. Cerebral vasculopathy included moyamoya changes (7) and stenosis/occlusion of major intracranial arteries (8). On follow-up (mean 4 years), 2 patients developed radiologic progression; 1 was treated with aspirin alone, whereas another underwent revascularization surgery. Although cerebral vasculopathy in neurofibromatosis type 1 may be asymptomatic at presentation, there may be radiologic and clinical progression leading to morbidity and mortality. Magnetic resonance angiography should be considered with brain MRI for early detection and timely intervention of cerebral vasculopathy."

The first cerebral angiogram on the day of ictus found minimal caliber change with lower contrast density at the V4 segment, but repeat angiography showed typical segmental narrowing of the artery on the 14th day.

CD009372,0,20004607,0,Automated detection of intracranial aneurysms based on parent vessel 3D analysis.,"The detection of brain aneurysms plays a key role in reducing the incidence of intracranial subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) which carries a high rate of morbidity and mortality. The majority of non-traumatic SAH cases is caused by ruptured intracranial aneurysms and accurate detection can decrease a significant proportion of misdiagnosed cases. A scheme for automated detection of intracranial aneurysms is proposed in this study. Applied to the segmented cerebral vasculature, the method detects aneurysms as suspect regions on the vascular tree, and is designed to assist diagnosticians with their interpretations and thus reduce missed detections. In the current approach, the vessels are segmented and their medial axis is computed. Small regions along the vessels are inspected and the writhe number is introduced as a new surface descriptor to quantify how closely any given region approximates a tubular structure. Aneurysms are detected as non-tubular regions of the vascular tree. The geometric assumptions underlying the approach are investigated analytically and validated experimentally. The method is tested on 3D-rotational angiography (3D-RA) and computed tomography angiography (CTA). In our experiments, 100% sensitivity was achieved with average false positives rates of 0.66 per study on 3D-RA data and 5.36 false positive rates per study on CTA data."

A simultaneous angiographic study discloses their strong correlation.","Cerebral artery stenosis (CAS) has the same pathogenesis as coronary artery disease (CAD), but the coexistence of these two diseases has been rarely reported. To detect coexistent CAS in CAD patients, we conducted a study of simultaneous coronary and cerebral angiography. Of the 663 consecutive newly diagnosed CAD patients who had not yet been explored to have CAS, 80 were admitted to undergo angiography of bilateral carotid and vertebral system during the same procedure. We defined significant vascular stenosis, either located intracranially or extracranially, as the lesions of diameter stenosis more than 50%. Association between carotid or vertebral stenosis and their potential risk factors were also analyzed. Of our patients, 18 (22.5%) had significant extracranial vascular stenosis, 14 (17.5%) suffered from intracranial stenosis, and 20 (25%) had both. Only 28 patients (35%) had no significant intracranial or extracranial stenosis. None of the demographic parameters as hypertension or diabetes showed significant differences between the cerebral patent group and the CAS group, except for the number of coronary stenotic vessels (1.71 +/- 0.81 versus 2.69 +/- 0.64, P < 0.001). The number of coronary stenotic vessels is correlated well to the number of cerebral stenotic lesions (r = 0.562, P < 0.001). Besides, 8 of the cerebral stenotic patients and 2 of the cerebral patent patients had ischemic stroke previously. We conclude the CAS is coexistent in more than half of the CAD patients in this study. Our study also implies a proportional increase in the severity of CAS to CAD severity."

CD009372,0,22133741,0,A case of embolic stroke imitating atherothrombotic brain infarction before massive hemorrhage from an infectious aneurysm caused by Streptococci.,"Early detection followed by treatment with antibiotics in conjunction with direct or endovascular surgery is integral in the management of patients with intracranial infectious aneurysms. These aneurysms often manifest as massive intracranial hemorrhages, which severely deteriorate the outcome. It is very important to detect infectious aneurysms before they rupture. Although usually associated with infective endocarditis, these aneurysms can occur in a variety of clinical settings. We present a case of α-Streptococcus-provoked infectious aneurysm in a patient without infective endocarditis, initially presenting as atherothrombotic-like brain infarction, before massive intracranial hemorrhage. The present case alerts clinicians to keep in mind possible development of infectious aneurysms, even in patients who appear to be suffering from atherothrombotic stoke, especially in patients presenting with signs of infection."

CD009372,0,2688197,0,Anterior cerebral artery velocity changes in disease of the middle cerebral artery stem.,"Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography can map the changes in blood velocity that result from stenosis or occlusion of the middle cerebral artery. To evaluate patterns of collateral blood flow in disease of the middle cerebral artery stem, we used both cerebral angiography and transcranial Doppler ultrasonography to study the systolic blood velocities in both anterior cerebral arteries in 10 consecutive patients with middle cerebral artery stenosis or occlusion. Five patients had no evidence of hemodynamically significant carotid disease and good-quality measurements of systolic velocity in each anterior cerebral artery. Two of the five patients had middle cerebral artery stem stenosis and the other three had occlusion. The ratios of mean blood velocity in the normal compared with the abnormal side for the five patients (mean 1.34 +/- 0.23, range 1.15-1.74) were significantly higher than ratios for 10 controls (mean 1.04 +/- 0.12, range 0.76 +/- 1.19) using an unpaired t test (t = 3.492, 0.0005 less than p less than 0.005). Our results suggest that transcranial Doppler ultrasound measurements of anterior cerebral artery blood velocity may be a useful index of collateral blood flow from the anterior cerebral artery territory into the middle cerebral artery territory. Changes in mean velocity ratio may document the evolution and adequacy of collateral blood flow over the cerebral convexity in middle cerebral artery stem disease. In addition, the changes in anterior cerebral artery blood velocity appear to be an important corroborative finding for middle cerebral artery stem occlusion."

We prospectively investigated 103 patients with acute stroke in the posterior circulation. All patients underwent CTA and Doppler ultrasound, and DSA was performed in 22 patients. Vascular findings were classified in categories according to the type of lesion and the location in the vertebral, basilar, or posterior cerebral artery. In the first part of the analysis we examined the correlation between CTA and intra-arterial DSA (n=22), and in the second part that between CTA and Doppler ultrasound (n=103). Intra-arterial DSA identified 11 stenoses, 13 occlusions, and 3 hypoplasias. The correlation between DSA and CTA was best for the basilar artery (all lesions were identified with CTA). Of the 14 lesions detected in the vertebral artery by DSA 13 were also detected by CTA, but the specific type of lesion was identified in only 7 cases. The correlation between CTA and Doppler ultrasound was lower. In conclusion, CTA is thus a reliable method for detecting lesions in the posterior circulation and may replace DSA in many cases. However, particularly in the vertebral artery DSA remains the superior technique."

On the basis of magnetic resonance imaging, magnetic resonance angiography, single photon emission computed tomography, and cerebral angiographic findings, 3 children were diagnosed as having infarctions due to moyamoya disease, and the others as having idiopathic infarctions. Serologic studies revealed elevated anticardiolipin antibody (ACA) IgG in 3 of the 5 patients with idiopathic infarction; no such elevation was revealed in patients with moyamoya disease. Values for all other tests, including ACA IgM and lupus anticoagulant, were within normal limits or negative in all patients. ACA IgG, therefore, may be a more important causative agent of childhood strokes than was previously considered."
CD009372,0,19342828,0,Relevance of neuroimaging in the evaluation of cerebral ischemia.,"The rapid development of neuroimaging techniques has provided us with a wide range of tools for the assessment of patients who may have experienced cerebrovascular events. Each of these technologies provides specific and potentially informative insights. For clinical practice, however, we always have to tailor our diagnostic approach according to a maximum benefit/minimal burden and cost ratio. We, therefore, propose a diagnostic algorithm which is tailored according to stroke phase and availability of distinct therapeutic strategies. In the acute phase of ischemic stroke, patients can be segregated into those who are potentially amenable to systemic thrombolysis within 3 h and into possible candidates for (i.v. or i.a.) thrombolysis outside approved criteria both within and beyond this time window. For patients in the postacute phase of acute ischemic stroke, neuroimaging should contribute a maximum of information to the clarification of stroke etiology to allow for specific secondary prevention. Patients with transient ischemic attacks appear to represent yet another distinct group of patients who can benefit greatly from a rapid and comprehensive neuroimaging evaluation, as this allows identification of individuals at a specifically high risk for a subsequent stroke. Using these categories, the relevance of respective neuroimaging tools can be substantiated by a large body of evidence."

Thirty healthy mongrel dogs were randomly divided into five groups; artificial cerebrospinal fluid group (group A), normal temperature control group (group C), mild hypothermia 8 h group (group H1), mild hypothermia 16 h group (group H2), and mild hypothermia 32 h group (group H3). The authors injected the artificial CSF into dog's foramen magnum in group A while the other four groups were injected with autologous arterial blood. The normal group's temperature maintained 38.5°C. The authors set the temperature at 33.5°C in mild hypothermia groups and this was maintained for 8, 16, and 32 h, respectively. ET-1 and NO levels in the cerebrospinal fluid and plasma were assayed in each group on days 0, 7, 14, and 21. Then the changes of the diameter of blood vessels of cerebral basilar artery and overall performance categories score in each group through application of CT angiography were recorded. In the cerebral vasospasm model which was constructed by injecting the blood to dog twice, mild hypothermia treatment, through the application of vascular heat-exchange controller, could reduce cerebral vasospasm. It was observed that the duration of the mild hypothermia is directly proportional to the longer duration of the relieving of cerebral vasospasm. The reciprocal changes observed in the levels of ET-1 and NO in cerebrospinal fluid and plasma revealed that it might be possible to reduce the cerebral vasospasm by regulating the rising amplitude of ET-1 and the decrease in NO in CSF and plasma."

Neurological grades of these patients were grade III in 2 and grade IV in 4 patients, and subarachnoid hemorrhage on CT was diffuse and thick in all patients. Cerebral blood flow was continuously measured for 7 to 19 days by the thermal diffusion flow probe with a peltier stack which was left on the cerebral cortex at the surgery for ruptured aneurysm. Moreover, CBF studies by cold xenon CT and 133Xe inhalation methods were also performed in discussing cases. At the same time intracranial pressure was monitored. Cerebral angiography was carried out in all except for 2 patients who died due to severe cerebral vasospasm. The initial CBF value of all patients was 20 to 40 ml/100 g/min (mean value: 27 ml/100 g/min), and these were significantly low compared to normal value (50 ml/100 g/min). Moreover, these CBF was substantially decreased several days after surgery in all patients, and it was marked in 3 patients who died. From these results it was clear that the degree of vasospasm is important to determine the prognosis. One of 3 patients who died had ruptured left posterior cerebral artery aneurysm with occlusion of bilateral internal carotid arteries. In this case further decrease of CBF due to vasospasm was observed in addition to low initial CBF resulting diffuse low flow in both hemispheres although extracranial to intracranial bypass was performed. On the other hand, it was also shown that the intracranial pressure was an important factor to influence the outcomes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Initial computed tomography and cerebral angiography revealed a severe subarachnoid hemorrhage, a large cystic lesion in the left occipital region, and an aneurysm at the bifurcation of the internal carotid and the posterior communicating artery on the right side. As the subarachnoid hemorrhage was thought to be due to rupture of the aneurysm, we attempted to clip the aneurysmal neck at first, and 2 weeks later the cystic tumor was removed for the purpose of internal decompression. The extirpated specimen proved to be an epidermoid tumor. Association of a brain tumor and an cerebral aneurysm is very rare, especially a combination of an epidermoid tumor and a cerebral aneurysm, and until now only 2 cases have been reported to the best of our knowledge. Moreover, the epidermoid tumor of our case was located intracerebrally. The phenomenon that the internal carotid aneurysm was on the left side and the tumor on the right side may suggest that these 2 lesions originated quite coincidentally. It is controversial to decide which lesion and when to treat first in a case of association of a tumor and an aneurysm, and we discussed as to the surgical therapy reviewing literature."

CD009372,0,8738083,0,How should we estimate carotid stenosis using magnetic resonance angiography?,"Our purpose was to assess the reproducibility of and differences between the most commonly used methods for assessing carotid artery stenosis using magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). We studied 55 patients who underwent axial three-dimensional time-of-flight MRA (1.5 T). Quantitative caliper measurements were performed from maximum intensity projection (MIP) and multiple planar reconstruction (MPR) images, according to the criteria of the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET) and European Carotid Surgery Trial (ECST). The measurements were compared to each other and to visual interpretation, using conventional angiography as the reference. The measured percentage stenoses were higher on MRA than on digital subtraction angiography (DSA) using both NASCET (mean difference 1.9-3.0%) and ECST (6.3-6.7%) criteria. The kappa coefficients for the agreement between DSA and MRA were higher using the NASCET (0.61-0.76) than the ECST criteria (0.52-0.65). No statistically significant differences were found between measurements from MIP and MPR images. The ECST measurement criteria gave significantly higher percentage stenoses than the NASCET criteria (P < 0.001), this difference being more prominent on MRA (mean difference in diameter stenosis percentage 14.3-16.4%) than on DSA (7.6-11.2%) and most important with mild stenoses. The difference between visual interpretation and quantitative measurements on MRA was significant (P = 0.01-0.001). There were no statistically significant interobserver differences in the MRA film readings, either in visually estimated degrees of stenosis or stenosis measurements. Thus, the different criteria of the two multicentre trials led to significantly different results, especially in the assessment of mild stenosis, and these differences are more important with MRA than with DSA. Differences between the imaging modalities or the reconstruction programs seem less important."

Early computed tomography (CT) detected no brain abnormalities, but repeat CT found subarachnoid hemorrhage. Internal carotid angiography detected a pseudoaneurysm, which was not treated because of his poor clinical condition. He died of multiple organ failure. Early detection of a traumatic intracranial aneurysm is important for the prevention of aneurysmal rupture, or ""delayed"" apoplexy. Review of 171 cases with traumatic aneurysms from the literature found that false negative angiography occurred only in three cases on post-trauma day 7 and thereafter. Early diagnostic angiography within a week of the initial trauma is indicated if traumatic aneurysm is suspected to detect early signs of irregularity, spasm, and narrowing of the arterial wall. Repeat angiography is indicated if aneurysmal formation is still highly suspected in spite of negative initial angiography."

CD009372,0,1511219,1,"Comparison of MRI, CT and angiography in cerebral arteriovenous malformations.","Computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and cerebral angiography were performed in 30 patients with cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Clinical data and radiographic findings are presented. The diagnostic values of CT and MRI are compared. 25 of 30 AVMs were seen on CT-scans, 27 on MR-images, 26 by angiography. Typical CT-findings were irregularly hyperdense areas with spotlike contrast enhancement. 4 out of 5 AVMs not depicted by CT were diagnosed for tumor, in one case the malformation was hidden by a hematoma. MRI mostly showed the AVM as round or oval lesions with spongelike structure of low signal intensity in T1-weighted sequences or as single enlarged vessels. The 26 AVM revealed by angiography presented typically enlarged vessels; in 2 cases angiography was without any pathological findings, 2 cases showed signs of a space occupying lesion. The results confirm that MRI is superior to CT in detecting and recognizing AVM. Its strength lies in the possibility to detect abnormal vessels even in presence of fresh or older hematoma, and in the precise information on size and location of the AVM. In our series, MRI and CT-scans together showed 28 of 30 AVMs, the remaining 2 cases were not seen with angiography either but only proven histologically. Although today MR-angiography is able to provide three dimensional images of blood vessels, it cannot yet replace angiography in the exact study of the vessels which is required for surgical planning."

CD009372,0,9781283,0,Intra-operative colour-duplex-sonography in the surgical management of cerebral AV-malformations.,"In this prospective study the role of intra-operative Colour-Duplex-Sonography (= CDS) during surgery of arteriovenous malformations (= AVM) is evaluated. During the last three years 20 consecutive patients with supratentorial AVMs were examined by intra-operative CDS in order to evaluate the potential of CDS to 1) localize the AVM, 2) differentiate between embolized and perfused parts, 3) identify feeding and draining vessels and 4) control the complete excision of the AVM. All AVMs were localized supratentorially, 9 were grade I and II (according to Spetzler and Martin [31]), 8 grade III and 3 grade IV. 11 were partly embolized and 8 associated with an intracerebral bleeding. In all cases the nidus was correctly localized sonographically by its typical bidirectional flow pattern in Colour-mode. CDS guided the surgeon directly to all (11 cases) deep-seated AVMs (2 to 4 cm subcortically). The smallest nidus measured 10 mm. 28 of 34 angiographically defined main feeding and 18 of 23 draining vessels were identified. 14 patients were controlled sonographically at the end of the resection regarding the completeness of excision. In 11 patients CDS was negative and was confirmed by either postoperative angiography or MRI in 10 patients. In one case residual AVM tissue was missed by CDS. Positive CDS findings in 3 cases were all confirmed by microscopic re-inspection, angiography and CCT. Our results suggest that CDS is able to localize AVMs intra-operatively with minimal instrumentation. It allows safe navigation to deep-seated malformations with high accuracy. Feeding and draining vessels can be identified and completeness of resection can be controlled."
CD009372,0,9266566,0,[A case of spontaneous middle cerebral artery occlusion associated with a cerebral aneurysm angiographically disappearing after STA-MCA anastomosis].,"We report a case of a rapidly growing cerebral aneurysm in the basal abnormal vascular network associated with spontaneous middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion. The aneurysm disappeared spontaneously shortly after performing STA-MCA anastomosis. A 54-year-old female was admitted to our hospital because of repeated attacks of right hemisensory disturbance and dysarthria. CT scan and MRI images showed the infarcted focus in the left parieto-occipital lobe. Bilateral MCAs were undetectable on MRI images. Cerebral angiography revealed that the bilateral MCAs were occluded in their proximal origin with basal abnormal vascular networks. The distal MCA branches were perfused via the vascular networks. A small aneurysm was detected in the distal portion of the left Heubner's artery. There were no abnormalities in the bilateral internal carotid arteries, the anterior cerebral arteries, and the basilar artery. The follow-up angiography performed 29 days after admission revealed a growing aneurysm with a diameter of 3 mm in the distal enhanced lesion consistent with the aneurysm observed in the angiography. An STA-MCA anastomosis was performed for improvement of cerebral misery perfusion. Single photon emission tomography (SPECT) performed 9 days after the bypass operation revealed improvement of cerebral blood flow in the left parieto-occipital lobe, and her TIA attacks disappeared. The aneurysm was undetected in the cerebral angiography performed 24 days after the bypass operation. Spontaneous MCA occlusion is a rare condition of chronic cerebrovascular occlusive diseases. Diagnostic criteria of the disease includes the MCA occlusions or stenosis with basal abnormal vascular networks. Usually the phenomenon is seen unilaterally, which differs from moyamoya disease. Diagnosis must exclude diseases caused by the etiologies such as those of arteriosclerotic origin. There have been 24 reported cases of spontaneous MCA occlusion including our case. Among them, 9 cases presented cerebral aneurysm located in abnormal vascular networks, and all the reported cases presented cerebral hemorrhage at their onset. The abnormal basal vascular network may be developed as collateral vessels to supply blood to the ischemic regions in this disease. An increased hemodynamic stress in the abnormal basal vascular network may produce a true aneurysm in the distal portion of the perforating arteries. STA-MCA anastomosis reduced the TIA attacks, but also decreased the hemodynamic stress on the abnormal basal vascular network and resulted in reduction in size or thrombosis of the aneurysm. STA-MCA anastomosis can be considered effective to treat cerebral aneurysms located in vessels with increased hemodynamic stress."

Sixty-three days later, she was admitted to the hospital again because of high fever, macroscopic hematuria, and dyspnea. Laboratory testing showed anemia and impaired renal function. High-resolution chest computed tomography (CT) revealed bilateral multiple peribronchial infiltrates with hemorrhage. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) angiography of the kidneys revealed left renal vein thrombosis combined with ischemia of the left kidney. Cyclophosphamide and methylprednisolone pulse treatment as well as intravenous immunoglobulins were started immediately. Despite intensive immunosuppressive and supportive treatment, she suffered three relapses of alveolar hemorrhage and died on day 40, due to severe intracerebral bleeding.

CD009372,0,16670864,0,Dissection of the V4 segment of the vertebral artery: clinicoradiologic manifestations and endovascular treatment.,"Intracranial vertebral artery (VA) dissection has three clinical presentations: ischemia, hemorrhage, and mass effect. Imaging findings of intracranial VA dissections vary according to clinical presentation. Irregular stenosis or occlusion of the VA is the most common finding in patients with posterior fossa infarction, whereas a dissecting aneurysm is the main feature in those with acute subarachnoid hemorrhage. A chronic, giant, dissecting aneurysm can cause mass effect on the brain stem or cranial nerves, as well as distal embolism. Magnetic resonance imaging is useful for detection of intramural hematomas and intimal flaps, both of which are diagnostic of VA dissection. Multidetector computed tomography angiography is increasingly used for diagnosis of VA dissection. Catheter angiography is still beneficial for evaluation of precise endoluminal morphology of the dissection before surgical or endovascular intervention. Endovascular treatment is now considered a major therapeutic option for patients with a ruptured dissecting aneurysm or a chronic dissecting aneurysm. Anticoagulation therapy is currently considered the initial treatment of choice in patients with posterior circulation ischemic symptoms. Endovascular treatment, such as stent-assisted angioplasty or coil occlusion at the dissection site, can be performed in selected patients with posterior fossa ischemic symptoms."

CD009372,0,3573823,0,Elevation of serum creatine kinase B-subunit levels by radiographic contrast agents in patients with neurologic disorders.,"The effect of radiographic contrast agents on the central nervous system was evaluated by measurement of serum creatine kinase B-subunit (CKB) levels with use of radioimmunoassay in 58 patients who underwent computed tomographic (CT) scanning and 46 patients who underwent cerebral angiography for evaluation of cerebrovascular diseases, brain tumors, and other neurologic disorders. In 11 patients (10.6%), the CKB increased to abnormally high levels within 4 hours after the radiographic procedures, and the median value after 30 minutes was significantly higher than the corresponding precontrast value (P less than 0.01). Eight of the 11 patients had recent ischemic cerebrovascular diseases, and 7 of the 11 had undergone CT scanning. On the basis of the information available in the literature, elevation of the serum CKB levels may be interpreted as reflecting breakdown of the blood-brain barrier and neural damage.

CD009372,0,11954867,0,Multi-slice CT angiography in the evaluation of patients with acute cerebrovascular disease--a promising new diagnostic tool.,"Single-slice computed tomographic angiography (CTA) is an established imaging method for the cerebrovascular system (CVS), but it suffers from technical limitations with respect to the coherent high resolution visualization of longer vascular segments, such as the extra- and intracranial CVS. The recently introduced multi-slice (MS) technology has been attributed with a superior imaging quality for angiographic procedures due to increased scan speed and improved spatial resolution. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the suitability of multi-slice CTA (MS-CTA) for the assessment of the arteriovenous CVS in patients with acute symptoms of either arterial or venous occlusive diseases. 41 patients with clinically suspected acute cerebral ischaemia (hemispheric in 29 and vertebrobasilar in 12 patients) and 4 patients with suspected cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) underwent CTA in a MS-CT scanner. In addition, doppler ultrasonography (DUS) was erformed in 34, magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) in 5 and digital subtraction angiography (DSA) in 6 patients. All findings were reviewed for stenoses or occlusion of the extra-and intracranial CVS and correlated with the clinical outcome. In 43 (96%) of 45 patients, MS-CTA yielded images of diagnostic quality with comprehensive visualization of the arterial and venous CVS including the cervical carotid bifurcation, the third segment of the major cerebral arteries and the dural sinus as well as internal cerebral veins. In 2 patients, assessment of the carotid bifurcation was limited because of tooth artefacts. In all patients, in whom imaging and clinical follow-up proved a non-lacunar infarction (n = 22), MS-CTA detected the underlying vascular pathology. Suspected CVT could be confirmed in 2 and ruled out in another 2 patients through MS-CTA. In conclusion, multi-slice CT an giography may be a promising new diagnostic tool for the rapid and comprehensive assessment of the arteriovenous CVS in patients with clinical signs of acute cerebrovascular diseases."
CD009372,0,23394535,0,Current management and treatment of cerebral vasospasm complicating SAH.,"Cerebral vasospasm is a common and serious complication of aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage. Despite the improvements in treatment of aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (aSAH), cerebral vasospasm complicating aSAH has remained the main cause of morbidity and mortality. Subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH)-induced vasospasm is a complex entity caused by vasculopathy, impaired autoregulation, and hypovolaemia, causing a regional reduction of cerebral brain perfusion which can then induce ischaemia. Cerebral vasospasm can present either asymptomatically detected only radiologically or symptomatically (delayed ischaemic neurologic deficit). The various diagnostic approaches include the use of transcranial doppler, digital subtraction angiography and multimodal computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) techniques. Although digital subtraction angiography is usually the gold standard for the diagnosis of cerebral vasospam, transcranial doppler is commonly the first-screening method for the detection of cerebral vasospam. The treatment of subarachnoid haemorrhage -induced vasospasm include the use of both medical and endovascular therapy. The aim of this review is to discuss the various current therapeutic options and future perspective measures for reducing cerebral vasospasm induced stroke after SAH."
CD009372,0,22192555,0,Spontaneous post-partum cervical carotid artery dissection in a patient with reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome.,"Post-partum cervicocephalic artery dissection (pp-CAD) is a rare and poorly understood condition. To our knowledge, only 21 cases have been reported. Reversible cerebral segmental vasoconstriction (RCSV) was first described by Call and Fleming in 1988, and its association with pp-CAD has only been reported in three cases. However, in those cases it is unclear whether the pp-CAD may have been caused by straining during labor and therefore merely coincidental to the intracranial arteriopathy. We describe a 41-year-old right-handed African-American woman who developed the syndrome of pp-CAD (headaches, trace subarachnoid hemorrhage and diffuse cerebral arteriopathy on angiogram) two weeks after delivery. In this unique case, the patient had fortuitously undergone an MR study twice over a four day period which included the carotid bifurcations. During that time the patient was an inpatient, on bed rest and subject to continuous cardiac monitoring. The interval studies documented a true spontaneous right internal carotid artery dissection occurring without obvious cause. The patient had noted moderate right neck pain developing between the two MR studies but experienced no neurological deficits. Subsequent conventional angiography confirmed the presence of postpartum cerebral arteriopathy and the cervical dissection. The patient was managed conservatively with antiplatelet medication and had an otherwise uneventful course.

For those lesions located deep within the cerebral hemispheres or near eloquent areas, conventional surgical resection may be associated with an unacceptable degree of morbidity and mortality. Herein we report our experience in the resection of these lesions using interactive image guidance. There were five women and five men in the patient group. Their age ranged from 16 to 73 years (mean = 41). Clinical presentation included hemorrhage (n = 7), headaches (n = 2), and seizures (n = 1). All lesions were classified using the Spetzler-Martin grading system as follows: grade I (n = 4), grade II (n = 5), and grade III (n = 1). The locations of the lesions were supratentorial (9) and infratentorial (1). Surgical planning was carried out using the Neurological Surgery Planning System software developed at Wayne State University. An infrared-based system was used to locate and define the lesion intraoperatively. For those lesions located near or within eloquent areas, an awake craniotomy with functional mapping was carried out. Clinical follow-up ranged from 3 to 62 months (mean = 34). Complete surgical excision was achieved in all patients, which was demonstrated postoperatively by digital substraction angiography. The preoperative neurological status remained unchanged in seven patients and improved in three. There was no associated morbidity and mortality with this technique. Image-guided surgical resection of arteriovenous malformations represents a valuable technique, especially in small deep-seated lesions and in those near eloquent areas."
CD009372,0,2256445,0,Lone atrial fibrillation and stroke.,"We studied 21 consecutive patients from the Lausanne Stroke Registry, who had first-ever ischemic stroke and lone atrial fibrillation, with a standard protocol of investigations including brain CT, and non-invasive cardiac and arterial tests. Rarity of associated risk factors and extracranial; arterial disease, presence of distal intracerebral occlusions on early angiography, and topography of cerebral infarct suggested that cardioembolism was the cause of stroke, though echocardiographic evidence for an atrial thrombus was uncommon. There was no recurrence during a post-stroke 14-day phase, during which anticoagulant and antiaggregant therapies were systematically avoided. Though low, the main risk of stroke recurrence was 0.99 per 100 patient-years during a mean follow-up period of 4.8 years, including a mean duration of anticoagulant therapy of 2.3 years in 18 patients. On the other hand, no death, severe cardiac events, or disabling anticoagulation-related hemorrhages occurred."

CD009372,0,18516978,0,[Isolated traumatic oculomotor nerve palsy caused by minor head trauma].,"Isolated traumatic oculomotor nerve palsy caused by minor head trauma is extremely rare. We report a case of this condition. A 65-year-old woman was transferred to our hospital after minor head injury. Initial examination of her right eye revealed a dilated pupil. The result of computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and magnetic resonance angiography of the brain were normal. An examination conducted 6 hours after the accident, examination demonstrated right ptosis, and another conducted 20 hours after the accident, she demonstrated partial limitation of adduction, supraduction, and infraduction of the right eye. Constructive interference in steady-state magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a slightly rough-shaped oculomotor nerve near the posterior petroclinoid ligament. After 8 months of the accident, the ptosis and limited eye movement were resolved. However, the right dilation of the right pupil persisted. Our case suggests that even minor head trauma can cause isolated oculomotor palsy, and that the posterior petroclinoid ligament is a candidate structure for causing oculomotor nerve palsy without intracranial hemorrhage and skull fracture."

The patients underwent cerebral angiography, x-ray computed tomography (CT) scan and regional cerebral measurements of CBF, CMRO2, oxygen extraction ratio (OER), and cerebral blood volume (CBV). Only minor arterial involvement was detected by angiography. In all patients, PET images of functional defects were more extensive than the corresponding CT hypodensity, and there were statistically significant reductions in CBF, CMRO2, and CBF/CBV ratio as compared with control subjects. Half of the regions analyzed in the affected hemisphere demonstrated a disruption of the normal coupling between CBF and CMRO2 as reflected by OER values significantly higher or lower than those of the corresponding region of the contralateral hemisphere. The pathophysiological pattern of high OER combined with a reduction in CBF proportionally greater than the reduction in CMRO2 was particularly indicative of regional chronic hemodynamic compromise in these patients."

In half the cases similar headaches returned after various time periods, and haemorrhage was again ruled out. In all patient chronic headaches of lower intensity developed. Control CT examination showed in 7 cases scars or atrophy of brain tissue. It is difficult to qualify such headaches as migraine and other known types of headache. Recently in the literature a new name has been coined for them--thunderclap headaches, and some authors regard them as a sign of minor intracranial haemorrhage. CT changes, raised protein level in cerebrospinal fluid, and the type of pain may suggest haemorrhage. The usefulness of cerebral arteriography in such patients should be considered.

CD009372,0,9117934,0,The neuroimaging features of the cardiolipin antibody syndrome.,"The purpose of our study was to define the neuroimaging features of the cardiolipin antibody syndrome. Thirty-eight patients with elevated anticardiolipin antibody titers were studied with magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography or both. Two patients underwent cerebral angiography. All patients had recurrent transient ischemic attacks, amaurosis, or strokes. One patient had normal imaging findings. The remaining patients had a combination of infarction and atrophy. Focal infarcts, the most common finding, were seen in 32 patients. Cerebral atrophy was seen in 26 patients and was the only radiographic finding in 5. Angiography demonstrated dramatic abnormalities in the distal portions of the anterior and posterior circulations, with multiple stenosis and occlusions and extensive pial and transdural collateral networks. The cardiolipin antibody syndrome should be suspected in young patients with transient ischemic attacks or strokes in the absence of the usual risk factors for cerebrovascular disease. The presence of raised anticardiolipin antibody titers or the cardiolipin antibody syndrome in patients with lupus, in those with other connective tissue diseases, and in patients without overt manifestations of an autoimmune disorder should be viewed as a risk factor for future ischemic cerebrovascular events. Further understanding of the precise role of these antibodies in the pathogenesis of vascular thrombosis may lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying certain forms of stroke."

Our purpose is to increase awareness of hemorrhagic complications following SA. A 69-year-old male without either coagulation disorders or anticoagulant/antiplatelet therapy developed acute radiculopathy, and severe mental confusion after SA for prostatectomy. CT showed intracranial subarachnoid and intraventricular acute hemorrhage. Cerebral angiography was negative. MRI showed subarachnoid and subdural hematoma in the dorsolumbar spine. Seven-year follow-up showed permanent cognitive and radicular damage. Multiple attempts for SA most likely caused spinal vessels rupture, either directly or indirectly by inducing differential pressure changes between cerebrospinal fluid and intravascular spaces; however, definite mechanisms have not been completely understood. Patients undergoing spinal puncture must report any neurological abnormality, which may result in irreversible damage. Cases of altered consciousness require an extensive neuroradiological evaluation. Proper competency of physicians responsible for spinal puncture is mandatory."

The results were compared with Doppler ultrasound and conventional angiography. MR angiography reliably demonstrated the direction of blood flow and the presence or absence of collateral flow in the circle of Willis. Collateral flow via leptomeningeal vessels and the ophthalmic artery could not be demonstrated. In the patient with superior sagittal sinus thrombosis, the absence of flow was well seen.

A 50-year-old woman with malignant otitis externa and bilateral temporal bone osteomyelitis presented with brisk bleeding from her left ear. She had bony dehiscence of the left carotid canal at CT and extravasation from a pseudoaneurysm of the carotid petrous segment at angiography. Carotid tortuosity proximally precluded placing a covered stent. After the lesion stopped bleeding spontaneously and given the presence of bilateral osteomyelitis putting the contralateral carotid at risk, the decision was made to attempt preservation of the parent vessel with flow diversion. However, bleeding recurred after 12 days, necessitating carotid sacrifice. This first reported experience in treating a carotid pseudoaneurysm at the skull base with the Pipeline device shows that transient cessation of bleeding is insufficient for flow diversion to be effective."

This report presents the usefulness of paraclinical tests applied during a 4-year period. Forty-four patients with severe brain lesions leading to brain death were treated during the 2004-2007 period. The appropriate test was chosen according to test availability and patient condition, appreciating restrictions according to the test protocol. Since the results of some tests were inconclusive, some patients underwent repeat testing with the same or different methods. Among 44 patients, 19 had neurotrauma, 11 massive aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, 1 massive arteriovenous subarachnoid and parenchymal hemorrhage, 12 hypertensive parenchymal hemorrhage, and 1 ischemic stroke. As a primary test, transcranial Doppler (TCD) was used in 30, brain scintigraphy in 2, multislice computed tomography angiography (MSCTA) in 10, and cerebral angiography in 2 patients; the diagnosis was confirmed in 26, 3, 9 and 2 patients, respectively. Due to inconclusive test results, MSCTA had to be repeated in 4 patients twice, and in one patient three times. Four patients where TCD was used died during the observation period, and in one patient the hemodynamic spectrum was inconclusive. In most patients (65%), TCD confirmed the clinical diagnosis of brain death, and in 61% the diagnosis was confirmed within a 2-hour period. TCD was the most useful confirmatory test for cerebral circulatory arrest in brain death diagnosis."

Intracranial hemorrhage occurred in 31 patients (18%), due to AVM rupture in 29 and secondary to AVM or aneurysm rupture in two. The mean risk of hemorrhage was 2.2% per year, and the observed annual rates of hemorrhage increased over time. The risk of death from rupture was 29%, and 23% of survivors had significant long-term morbidity. The size of the AVM and the presence of treated or untreated hypertension were of no value in predicting rupture."

The rare space-occupying lesion of the central organ seemed to point first of all to a peripheral disease due to the very unusual and highly special course in the infant; a gastrointestinal disorder seemed to be responsible for this phenomenon. It was only after observing mild convulsive manifestations that sonography was employed as a diagnostic tool, and thus the central disturbance was identified and its localisation and genesis demonstrated via computed tomography and angiographic diagnosis. Attention is drawn to the outstanding ""search method"" of noninvasive sonography via the still open fontanelle of the infant. This method should be employed if there is even the slightest suspicion of cerebral disease. A study of the literature shows clearly the superiority of the modern methods such as computed tomography and digital subtraction angiography over a femoralis catheter.

Attempts are also being made to characterize the main patterns of intracranial vascular diseases. The authors examined, with 3D TOF MRA, 40 patients presenting with 50 vascular lesions on MRI scans. Twenty of 40 patients were also studied with angiography. Seventeen aneurysms were detected, together with 3 stenoses of the cerebral arteries, 13 arteriovenous malformations, 12 dolichobasilar arteries, 3 postoperative and 2 post-embolization controls. MRI was performed with a superconductive magnet (1.5 T), a dedicated coil and gradient-echo 3D TOF FT sequences. The refocused sequence for flux, FISP 3DFT, required the following parameters: TR = 0.04 s, TE = 10 ms, flip angle = 15 degrees, 256 x 256 matrix, 1 acquisition. The 64-80 mm volume along the axial plane was divided so that an actual 1-mm thickness was excited. In post-processing, the maximum-intensity projection was employed on the axial plane 0 degrees-90 degrees (15 degrees interval). In the various conditions, the results obtained with MRA were correlated and compared with MRI findings. MRA provided useful additional information in 27.4% of cases in the study of aneurysms, arteriovenous malformations, vascular occlusion and dolichobasilar arteries, as well as in the follow-up of these lesions. MRA is currently suggested in the evaluation of cerebral circulation and is considered a complementary technique to MRI. MRA is also to be used preliminary to angiography."

The surgical cases were three cavernomas, two telangiectasias, and two venous malformations. We performed surgery when an angioma bled and the resulting hematoma was situated near the surface of the brainstem or the fourth ventricle. The cases were operated on at the subacute or chronic stages after hemorrhage. Although a magnetic resonance (MR) image showed a subacute or chronic localized hematoma with a low intensity rim, the case was not always a cavernoma, but a telangiectasia. Cavernomas could be totally removed, but telangiectasia could not. In the cases of medullary venous malformation the diagnosis was obtained radiologically, and when the hematoma was large, only hematoma evacuation was performed. In all cases the postoperative Karnofsky scores were improved or unchanged. Postoperative rebleeding in the hematoma cavity continued insidiously in a case of telangiectasia. The abnormal vessels of telangiectasia in the brainstem were preoperatively not visualized by cerebral angiography or MR imaging, but became visualized by enhanced MR imaging after evacuation of hematoma in two cases. It is stressed that an angioma with a hematoma intensity core surrounded by a low intensity rim on MR images is not always a cavernoma, but possibly is a telangiectasia."

We intend to study which pathophysiological changes are detected by CT and how CT contributes to prognosis and patient management in acute cerebral ischemia. We review recent publications about the role of CT in acute cerebral ischemia. Ischemic brain edema is associated with a decreased X-ray attenuation. Computed tomography is thus highly sensitive in detecting irreversibly damaged ischemic brain tissue. Patients showing large volumes of ischemic edema, exceeding one third of the middle cerebral artery territory, do not benefit from thrombolysis and have an increased risk of brain hemorrhage. The brain territory at risk from ischemia can be detected by CT angiography. To combine CT with CT angiography is a pragmatic approach which enables carefully directed treatment in acute cerebral ischemia."

CD009372,0,21125477,0,Neuroimaging research on cerebrovascular spasm and its current progress.,"The cerebrovascular spasm is a common complication of subarachnoid hemorrhage. The prognosis is affected severely with regard to quality of life of patients, and earlier determination of the cerebral vasospasm becomes very important. In recent years, there have been many research results in early judgment of cerebrovascular spasm, and imaging technology research is particularly prominent in this area. This article summarizes the advantages and disadvantages and the specific roles of several common imaging technologies to determine the early stage of cerebral vasospasm. Transcranial Doppler (TCD) was the first used to examine cerebral vasospasm and mainly detected vascular hemodynamic changes of cerebrovascular spasm in patients. Digital subtraction angiography is the gold standard for diagnosis of cerebral vasospasm, but its efficacy in determining severity of cerebrovascular spasm indexing is still in dispute. It is invasive, it is difficult to repeat the examination, and it can induce complications, so its clinical application is limited. CT imaging technology is a hot topic in this area. There is an important guiding significance in early diagnosis and treatment of cerebral vasospasm in CT perfusion imaging (PCT) and CT angiography (CTA). PCT mainly performs qualitative and quantitative analysis through hemodynamic parameters such as cerebral blood flow, cerebral blood volume, and mean transit time. CTA is minimally invasive, fast, and reliable as an efficient imaging technology, and will possibly replace DSA for the assessment of vasospasm, particularly in critically ill patients with cerebral vasospasm in an urgent examination. This means it has greater value and helps to improve the prognosis of patients. MR imaging in the early stages to judge cerebral vasospasm has great value. DWI can effectively assess the cerebral vascular spasm earlier to detect trace bleeding sites and reflect the damage of cerebral vasospasm by apparent diffusion coefficient. Combined with DWI and PWI, perfusion can be understood in all regions and can be found in ischemic penumbra, which is a more accurate way to determine cerebral vasospasm and more beneficial in guiding the treatment of patients and improving their prognosis. However, there have been false-negatives and false-positives when detecting cerebrovascular spasm post-SAH. It is of great importance to select accurate, convenient, non-invasive imaging technologies that judge cerebrovascular spasm and guide treatment that improves the prognosis of these patients and other aspects."

CD009372,0,17978598,0,Intracerebral hemorrhage: a life-threatening complication of hypertension during pregnancy.,Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is an infrequent but severe complication in pregnant women with hypertension. The authors describe a patient with chronic hypertension who developed superimposed preeclampsia and spontaneous ICH during the thirty-fifth week of pregnancy. ICH was diagnosed by computed tomographic scan. She underwent successful emergent cesarean section and neurosurgical decompression of the ICH. Both intraoperative surveillance and postoperative magnetic resonance angiographic examination of the cerebral vessels failed to identify an aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation. The authors discuss the diagnosis and management in this case and review the literature regarding this challenging complication of pregnancy and preeclampsia. Controversies regarding treatment of hypertension during pregnancy are discussed in light of the impact on the management of this patient.

CD009372,0,19605654,0,Normal variants of the cerebral circulation at multidetector CT angiography.,"Multidetector computed tomographic (CT) angiography is used in many institutions for initial evaluation of the cerebral circulation for acute stroke and subarachnoid hemorrhage as well as in various preoperative settings. A comprehensive CT examination that includes a review of three-dimensional and maximum intensity projection images of the intra- and extracranial arteries and axial images of the skull base (obtained with bone window settings) allows identification of most abnormalities and normal variants. Knowledge of the presence and clinical relevance of normal variants such as fenestrations, duplications, and persistent fetal arteries plays a crucial role in the diagnosis and management of acute stroke and subarachnoid hemorrhage and may aid in surgical planning. For example, the preoperative detection of a medial or intrasellar persistent trigeminal artery may help surgeons avoid a potentially life-threatening hemorrhage in a patient undergoing transsphenoidal surgery for pituitary adenoma. However, the significance of normal variants diverges widely: A clinically important association has been observed between fenestration and intracranial aneurysm formation, whereas early branching of the middle cerebral artery is not associated with an increased risk of aneurysm formation and has little clinical significance.

One year postoperatively, the patient was followed with CT angiography and was reported to show a de novo aneurysm at the bifurcation of the left inferior cerebellar artery (ICA). Subsequent DSA revealed an aberrant vein crossing over the ICA bifurcation on mask phase images. This is the first reported case of a such a reason for a 'false positive' on CT angiography (CTA). The case demonstrates that although CTA has a reported high specificity, careful interpretation of multiple views is required to diagnose intracranial aneurysms when compared to the 'gold' standard of CTA."

CD009372,0,8915761,0,Vasospasm following tumor removal: report of 5 cases.,"Cerebral vasospasm is a clinical/angiographical condition frequently observed after a subarachnoid hemorrhage due to the rupture of an intracranial aneurysm. Twenty cases of vasospasm observed after the removal of cerebral tumors have been reported in the literature; we here report on a further five. The time of onset of symptomatic vasospasm was 3-7 days after surgery; three of the patients died of an ischemic event induced by the vasospasm and two survive. Although no angiographic confirmation was obtained in our cases, serial transcranial Doppler (TCD) flow velocities were always high. It is suggested that the TCD-revealed accumulation of blood in the basal cisterns observed in all cases may have been responsible for this unusual condition, and it is therefore important to consider vasospasm as a probable etiological cause of clinical deterioration in patients undergoing the surgical removal of a cerebral tumor. For this reason, whenever any neurological deterioration occurs in such patients, it is advisable to perform TCD in order to verify the presence of any vasospasm and promptly commence suitable treatment."

Until not long ago, higher-field MR equipment was exclusively employed for research, not for clinical use. More recently, the introduction of 3.0-T MR machines for new and more sophisticated clinical applications has resulted in important benefits, especially in neuroradiology. Indeed, their high gradient power and field intensity (3.0 T) allow adjunctive and more advanced diagnostic methodologies to be performed with excellent resolution in a fraction of the acquisition time required with earlier machines. The purpose of this paper is to illustrate the distinctive semeiological characteristics of 3.0-T morphological and angiographic brain imaging compared with lower-field systems and highlight the respective advantages and drawbacks based on the experience gained in the first 5 years from the installation of a 3.0-T magnet."
CD009372,0,23564127,0,Usefulness of intraoperative computed tomography for the evacuation of lobar hemorrhage.,"There is a lot of debate on the treatment method for spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Intraoperative computed tomography (iCT) provides excellent images of cerebrovascular lesions. In this paper, we describe the surgical procedure and the efficacy of iCT during lobar hemorrhage evacuations and subsequent patient outcomes. Fifty-eight patients with lobar hemorrhage were treated using iCT. We performed preoperative cerebral angiography and/or three-dimensional (3D) CT angiography to detect abnormal vessels and identify the spatial relationships between the cerebrovascular structures and the hematoma. After administration of local anesthesia, an enlarged burr-hole was created just above the hematoma. Microsurgical evacuation of the hematoma was performed, and an iCT image was obtained to assess real-time 3D information on residual hematoma or unexpected rebleeding. Mean hematoma volume, evacuation rate, and duration of the surgery were 42 mL, 93 %, and 89 min respectively. Postoperative rebleeding occurred in 1 case. The median Glasgow Coma Scale score upon admission was 12. At discharge, most patients (60 %) had good functional outcomes defined by modified Rankin Scale scores of 0-3. Postoperative neurological findings and consciousness levels showed early improvement. Safe, accurate, and effective evacuation of lobar hemorrhage was possible with iCT as an image-guided intraoperative navigation tool."

CD009372,0,871004,0,Traumatic intracerebral hematoma with stable neurological deficit.,"The possibility of an intracerebral hematoma may be overlooked in the presence of a ""fixed"" neurologic deficit. The clinical complex that is emphasized is composed of (a) ipsilateral cranial trauma, (b) early development of focal neurological deficit, (c) a plateau in the subsequent course of the disease, (d) the delayed appearance of a positive radioactive isotope scan, and (e) a focal area of distorted vessels in angiographic studies. The availability of the computer tomographic scan has made the diagnosis of intracerebral hematomas more certain but it is important that the possibility of a hematoma be considered and pertinent investigations be performed. Even after diagnosis, an operative procedure may be delayed in patients who are neurologically stable. In the five cases presented, the diagnosis of cerebral contusion led to a delay in operative evacuation which was associated with improvement in the previously stable neurological deficit."

Our experience does not support such a conclusion. We report our experiences in 25 patients with SAH, who had a normal initial angiogram. Aneurysms were seen in five of 20 cases when angiography was repeated. On subsequent review of the initial angiograms, the aneurysm was apparent in four of the five cases. When these four initial angiograms were shown to a second observer, unaware of the results of the second study, three of the four aneurysms were correctly identified. We suggest that if, under strong clinical suspicion of SAH, the angiogram is reported as normal the study should be reviewed by a second neuro-radiologist before proceeding to repeat angiography."

CD009372,0,9601953,0,Intracranial vascular malformations.,"Many efforts and much research have been dedicated to the field of non-invasive angiographic techniques in the past few years. Thanks first to magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and subsequently to computed tomographic angiography (CTA), very interesting results have been obtained in the diagnosis of cerebrovascular diseases. Neck vessels are most successfully evaluated by both MRA and CTA, and the need for digital subtraction angiography (DSA) examinations in patients at risk for vascular occlusions has significantly decreased. The role and the diagnostic accuracy of these non-invasive modalities in intracranial vascular pathology is still under investigation, and several studies have been and are being performed. Both techniques have a better spatial resolution and sensitivity in detecting cerebrovascular malformations than DSA. In the diagnosis of cerebral aneurysms, both MRA and CTA - due to their high sensitivity - have become screening techniques in the population at risk for subarachnoid hemorrhage, these techniques may become basic diagnostic modalities in treatment planning. The results are less satisfying in the evaluation of brain arteriovenous malformations and in the different steps of pre- and post-therapeutic evaluation."

CD009372,0,2416213,0,Experimental chronic cerebrovascular spasm in the monkey: an assessment of the functional changes in the cerebral arteries and their protection by diltiazem.,"The structure and function of cerebral arteries obtained from a monkey model of chronic cerebral vascular spasm 5 days after hemorrhage have been examined. Narrowing of the larger cerebral arteries demonstrated by angiography at all sites of measurement seems to be due primarily to an increased wall rigidity associated with cellular damage, the resultant inflammatory response and large, long-lasting spontaneous increases in muscle tone. Changes in agonist sensitivity were extremely variable. The reduction of contractility of the vessel wall to a mean of 30% of control diminished the consequence of any changes in active tone characteristics. Neurogenic control on the side of the lesion was remarkably depressed. When treated with diltiazem, beginning 1 day before induction of hemorrhage and continuing to the time of sacrifice, arterial diameter was reduced at only 1 of the 6 standard sites of measurement and then by only a small amount. Neurologic effects invariably seen in the untreated monkeys were prevented by diltiazem. Many of the changes in the artery wall, including structural alterations, were diminished by the drug. Abnormal spontaneous myogenic tone was present but was less in the diltiazem-treated group; however, nerve damage and its functional consequences were not prevented. It is concluded that diltiazem, presumably by preventing the accumulation of intracellular calcium within the cell, prevents the initial events in the evolution of chronic cerebrovasospasm or narrowing. This is probably achieved by a diminishing of the direct vasoconstrictor effects and the toxicity of putative spasmogens released from blood clots, nerves and the brain on the vascular smooth muscle, thus interrupting the sequence leading to pathologic change."

All of these patients were examined at the Mayo Clinic between 1976 and 1989, and all available cerebral arteriograms were reviewed by a neuroradiologist. Follow-up information was obtained for 52 patients (96%) until death or treatment intervention, or for at least 1 year after diagnosis, with a mean follow-up period of 6.6 years. Throughout this 6.6-year follow-up period, ICH related to dural AVF occurred in five of the 52 patients, for a crude risk of hemorrhage of 1.6% per year. The risk of hemorrhage at the time of mean follow-up examination was 1.8% per year. Angiographic examination revealed several characteristics that were considered potential predictors of ICH during the follow-up period. Lesions of the petrosal sinus and straight sinus had a higher propensity to bleed, although the small numbers in the series precluded a definite conclusion. A person suffering from a dural AVF with a venous varix on a draining vein had an increased risk of hemorrhage, whereas no hemorrhage was seen in the 20 patients without a varix (p < 0.05). Lesions draining into leptomeningeal veins had an increased occurrence of hemorrhage, although this increased risk was not statistically significant. Patients' initial symptoms were compared to those at follow-up evaluation. Pulsatile tinnitus improved in more than half of the 52 patients, and resolved in 75% of those showing some improvement. Individuals without a sinus or venous outflow occlusion at initial cerebral angiography were more likely to improve or remain stable (89%), whereas patients with an occlusion showed infrequent improvement (11%; p < 0.05)."
CD009372,0,506289,0,[Occlusive cerebrovascular disease without angiographic evidence of stenosis of cerebral arteries (author's transl)].,"The angiographs of patients suffering from transient ischaemic attacks and ischaemic strokes were reviewed. No clinical data were given to the examiners and their diagnoses were then compared with the case histories. In 33 out of 69 patients the angiographs showed no arterial stenosis in the area corresponding to the neurological deficit. However, in this group of patients the incidence of elongation and dilatation of the arteries was significantly higher than in the group with visible stenosis. Among the patients without visible stenoses there was also a significantly higher incidence of hypertension, especially with an elevation of the diastolic blood pressure, and of symptoms related to the brain stem. The possibility is discussed that a special form of occlusive cerebrovascular disease exists, whereby the characteristic angiographic features are not circumscribed stenoses, but a generalized elongation and dilatation of the arteries.

Liquor analysis revealed erythrocytes, positive bilirubin and slightly elevated protein. Subsequent cerebral MRI showed no signs of aneurysm, vascular malformation, venous sinus thrombosis or infarction. An intraarterial cerebral angiography was then performed and showed bilateral widespread segmental vasoconstriction in the anterior, middle and posterior cerebral arteries. A diagnostic workup on systemic vasculitis was negative. The patient's good general condition in spite of extensive angiographic findings rendered the diagnosis cerebral vasculitis unlikely. A state of reversible cerebral segmental vasoconstriction was suspected and the patient was treated with the calcium antagonist nifedipine and observed for four weeks.

A 51-year-old man with a history of atrial fibrillation who was taking dabigatran presented with an acute ischemic stroke. The patient had a normal international normalized ratio, activated partial thromboplastin time, and an elevated thrombin time of 26.4 seconds. Recanalization of the middle cerebral artery with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator was apparent on digital subtraction angiography, and there was no evidence of intracerebral hemorrhage on the repeat computed tomographic scan. This is the first report of a patient who was taking dabigatran etexilate and who had an ischemic stroke caused by a middle cerebral artery occlusion, with an elevated thrombin time and radiographic recanalization with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator without evidence of hemorrhagic transformation."

CD009372,0,1950905,0,Nonaneurysmal perimesencephalic subarachnoid hemorrhage: CT and MR patterns that differ from aneurysmal rupture.,"We describe a characteristic distribution of cisternal blood in 52 patients with nonaneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage proved by a normal angiogram. On CT, the center of the bleeding was located immediately anterior to the brainstem in all patients, which was confirmed in four patients who were studied with MR imaging. Extension to the ambient cisterns or to the basal parts of the sylvian fissures was common, but the lateral sylvian or anterior interhemispheric fissures were never completely filled with blood. Rupture into the ventricular system did not occur. MR demonstrated downward extension of the blood anterior to the brainstem as far as the medulla, but failed to detect the source of hemorrhage. Our aim was to determine whether this so-called nonaneurysmal perimesencephalic hemorrhage could be distinguished from aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage on early CT scans. Two neuroradiologists were shown a consecutive series of 221 CT scans of patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage who subsequently underwent angiography. Only one patient with a basilar artery aneurysm on angiography was incorrectly labeled by both observers as having a nonaneurysmal perimesencephalic pattern of hemorrhage. The high predictive value of the perimesencephalic pattern of hemorrhage for a normal angiogram (0.95 and 0.94, respectively, for the two observers) and the excellent interobserver agreement (kappa 0.87) demonstrate that nonaneurysmal perimesencephalic hemorrhage can be distinguished on CT in the majority of patients. Recognition of this pattern of hemorrhage is important as patients with this subset of subarachnoid hemorrhage have an excellent prognosis."

A 23 year-old woman, who had undergone surgical closure of ventricular septal defect at age 2, suffered headache and general fatigue after dental treatment. She was admitted to another institution, and examinations revealed bacterial endcarditis. She was transferred to our hospital, and underwent aortic valve replacement. After the valve replacement, CT revealed parenchymal hematoma in the left frontal lobe. CT angiography (CTA) and cerebral angiography (CAG) demonstrated an aneurysm at the distal branch of the left middle cerebral artery. T2* weighted image demonstrated multiple signal loss lesions, which were not revealed by CAG and CTA. We speculated that these signal loss lesions were thrombosed mycotic intracranial aneurysms. She underwent left frontotemporal craniotomy, and the aneurysm was resected. Mycotic aneurysms are rare neurovascular lesions but their mortality and morbidity are high, so careful follow-up examinations are required.

Head CT scan demonstrated subarachnoid hemorrhage. Cerebral angiography showed the absence of the right internal carotid artery, and skull base CT of the bone window level revealed the absence of the right carotid canal. The right middle cerebral artery (MCA) and anterior cerebral artery (ACA) were opacified from the left internal carotid artery. The right A1 portion was hypoplastic and the distal portion of the right M1 portion was replaced by several minute complicated anastomotic vessels connected to the right M2 portion. The right MCA territory was mainly supplied by collateral flow from the right ACA and the right posterior cerebral artery via the leptomeningeal anastomosis. These was neither aneurysm nor arteriovenous malformation. The second angiography, 1 week after the initial angiography, showed the same hemodynamic pattern and aneurysms were not found. We diagnosed the patient as agenesis of the right internal carotid artery and the etiology of subarachnoid hemorrhage was suspected to be a rupture of the anastomotic vessels between the right M1 and M2. She was discharged on the 21st hospital day without any neurological deficit."

It means that changes of cerebral vessels are reversible after treatment with corticosteroids and calcium channel blockers, so these abnormalities are believed to reflect vasospasm rather than true vasculitis. The diagnosis is made on the basis of clinical presentation, brain magnetic resonance imaging and cerebral angiography. We present a young man with acute onset of headache and neurologic impairment secondary to ischemic stroke with intracerebral and subarachnoid hemorrhage.

The patient was transferred to our hospital for embolization of the basilar tip aneurysm. Endovascular embolization was performed using Guglielmi detachable coils (GDCs), and the aneurysm was completely occluded with preservation of the parent artery.

Endovascular treatment using GDCs appears to be particularly suitable for ruptured cerebral saccular aneurysms in patients with moyamoya disease."
CD009372,0,19004542,0,Expression of a latent ophthalmic artery collateral circulation after extracranial-intracranial bypass.,"We present the case of an unexpected response by the cerebral vasculature to bypass surgery. A 66-year-old man sustained a subarachnoid haemorrhage and cerebral angiography showed a large fusiform anterior communicating artery (ACoA) aneurysm and an anomalous anterior circulation. The right A1 segment was hypoplastic and blood supply to the entire right A2 was from the left anterior circulation via the ACoA. The aneurysm was therefore not amenable to endovascular coiling or surgical clipping alone. An extracranial-intracranial bypass was performed to revascularize the territory of the right A2 independently of the ACoA to allow the latter vessel to be clipped. Although the bypass graft was patent on post-operative cerebral angiography, it was in fact only perfusing a limited, peripheral anterior cerebral artery territory. The bulk of the right anterior circulation was derived retrogradely by latent collaterals from the internal carotid and ophthalmic arteries via small dural vessels which were not apparent prior to surgery."

CD009372,0,40442,0,[Progress of technical medicine within the field of gerontoneurology (author's transl)].,"1938 respectively 1978 are dates for progress of technical medicine concerning gerontoneurology. Following the discussion of the development in technical (apparatus), chemical and immunological diagnostic activities in neurology the applicability in elderly people should be described. On principle there are no methods of investigations which cannot be used in geriatric causes. Main point of interest is the correct indication. Non invasive methods can be used without somatic risk; one has to observe only the fact of psychological stress for the patient; indications of invasive methods (merely angiography of vessels within the brain) must be focused on special diagnosis of the illness. Suspicious facts of space occupying intracranial process almost everytime ask for angiography following EEG and cranial computertomography. In cases of arteriosclerosis in aged people with typical changes within the vessel system of the brain one should only use angiographical investigations if clinical findings (based on noninvasive methods) show indications for surgical treatment in extracranial regions of the brain vessels. It might be the same procedure if shunt-operation between carotis externa and interna circulation system can be expected as curative or prophylactic influence within the neurological condition. In these cases risk of selective angiography of the vessels within the brain (outgoing from arteria femoralis) are much less dangerous than in direct charges. First of all neurological status, general condition and age will be decive for medical indication. One should not use the full range of diagnostic features in gerontoneurology only to satisfy diagnostic appeasement."

There are no reports that demonstrate vertebral artery compression due to head turning in children without vertebral abnormalities. A child is reported with thalamic stroke in whom cerebral arteriography revealed vertebral artery compression on head turning. Blood flow in the vertebral artery, however, could be demonstrated by Doppler ultrasonography with the head in the midline. It is concluded that the vertebral artery is vulnerable to mechanical compression in the neck even in the absence of bony abnormalities."

Radiosurgery does not immediately lead to obliteration of the malformation, which often does not occur until years following treatment. Post-obliteration hemorrhage is rare, occurring months to years after radiosurgery, and has been associated with residual or recurrent AVM despite prior apparent nidus elimination. Three cases are reported of delayed intracranial hemorrhage in patients with cerebral AVMs treated with radiosurgery in which no residual AVM was found on catheter angiography at the time of delayed post-treatment hemorrhage. That the pathophysiology of these hemorrhages involves progressive venous outflow occlusion is speculated and the possible mechanistic link to subsequent vascular rupture is discussed."

We report two patients of PAN with multiple intracranial aneurysms. One patient presented with intracerebral hemorrhage and in the other patient multiple intracranial aneurysms were incidental findings and were asymptomatic. Both our cases suggest that multiple intracranial aneurysms are not very uncommon in PAN and cerebral angiography should be considered while doing abdominal angiogram in these patients.

CT and 3D-CT angiography showed subaracnoid hemorrhage and intracranial hemorrhage in the left hemisphere due to a saccular aneurysm at the occluded M2 portion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA). Her present illness started with a toothache and lumber pain 3 weeks earlier. Echocardiography revealed active infective endocarditis. We could have treated her by administering antibiotics, but during a cerebral angiography, she became comatose due to an aneurismal rerupture. Immediately, an emergency operation for aneurismal trapping was performed, but she died 19 days later because of left hemispheric swelling. We report a relatively rare case of infectious aneurysm at the proximal artery and discuss the pitfalls of its diagnosis and treatment. We should educate general physicians about infectious endocarditis because misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis of infectious aneurysm due to endocarditis results in unpleasant outcomes. We should treat infectious aneurysm at the proximal side artery by first administering antibiotics, and if necessary, subsequent direct surgery of the aneurismal trapping should be performed with a bypass. Unnecessary invasive treatment must be avoided while the disease is in the active infectious stage."

Two groups were defined. Group A consisted of 8 patients with diseases commonly associated with CNS aspergillosis: leukemia, lymphoma, aplastic anemia, and renal transplantation. Group B contained 9 patients with various illnesses not generally known to be associated with CNS aspergillosis. CNS aspergillosis was diagnosed and treated before death in only 1 patient. Patients in Group A received cytotoxic drugs, often had granulocytopenia, less commonly had focal neurological deficits, and seldom had seizures. Group B patients were not granulocytopenic, received no cytotoxic agents, underwent nontransplant surgery, and more frequently had focal neurological deficits. Eleven of the 17 patients (65%) had focal deficits, most of them hemiparesis. Meningeal signs were rare, but the cerebrospinal fluid was usually abnormal. The principal neuropathological process was Aspergillus invasion of blood vessels causing hemorrhagic infarction. Focal clinical deficits correlated neuroanatomically with Aspergillus lesions. In 2 patients, such lesions were detected by 99mTc-DTPA or cerebral angiography before computed tomographic scanning. The lungs were the usual portal of entry, but isolated CNS lesions occurred in 2 patients.

In our study of 277 patients carried out over an 18 month period, the most common reason of referral was subarachnoid haemorrhage followed by trauma. Aneurysms were the most common diagnosis (36%) with anterior and posterior communicating arteries being the most common locations. Fifty percent (50%) of patients investigated had a normal study. Our findings show that the yield from MDCTA and conventional angiography was relatively comparable, however, conventional angiography was superior in detection of aneurysms; hence, in cases were the MDCTA result was found to be normal despite a high index of suspicion for a subarachnoid haemorrhage, a follow-up MDCTA study or conventional angiography is useful.

Raised BFV may be caused by vessel narrowing or by hyperperfusion. In 44 SCD patients and 14 controls, intracranial arterial BFVs and global cerebral blood flow (CBF) were analyzed by TCCS and extracranial duplex ultrasound, respectively. Magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiography were performed in all patients with pathologic intracranial BFV rise. Intracranial BFVs and CBF in SCD were significantly higher than in controls. CBF in SCD correlated with BFV in all intracranial arteries and correlated inversely with age and hemoglobin values. Magnetic resonance angiography failed to demonstrate any stenosis in our SCD patients, thus raised intracranial BFVs must be interpreted as an anemia-dependent cerebral hyperperfusion. These findings suggest that the pathomechanism of stenosis-derived arterio-arterial embolism might be less relevant in SCD-related ischemic stroke, and other factors like small vessel disease or sickle cell-induced microvascular blood clotting have to be considered."

TCCD is relatively inexpensive and permits bedside examination. It improves the accuracy and reliability of conventional transcranial Doppler studies. The main limitation of TCCD are the ultrasonic windows. They restrict the area of insonation to the major cerebral arteries and the proximal part of its branches, lower the spatial resolution, and may prevent transtemporal insonation. Using MRA, both large and small intracranial arteries and veins can be imaged by selecting the appropriate imaging parameters. MRA provides morphologic information about the cerebral vessels, relying on blood flow as the physical basis for generating contrast between stationary tissues and moving spins. MRA is highly sensitive for the detection of occlusive disease in large intracranial arteries. However, with bright blood techniques the degree of stenosis tends to be exaggerated. Flow direction, eg, in collaterals, can be determined by selective or phase-contrast MRA. Perfusion imaging techniques provide information about blood flow at the capillary level. Diffusion imaging depicts molecular motion. TCCD and MRA used in combination or alone may eliminate the need for intra-arterial digital subtraction angiography (DSA) in most patients studied for occlusive cerebrovascular disease. DSA may be reserved for those patients where there is disagreement among the noninvasive techniques, and for the diagnosis of cerebral aneurysms and arteriovenous malformations. CTA relies on spiral CT technology and intravenous contrast injection. To date, intracranial use has been predominantly for the diagnosis of aneurysms. The role of CTA for the detection of nonaneurysmal intracranial vascular disease has yet to be established."

Despite extensive research, to date no effective treatment of vasospasm exists. Prostacyclin is a potent vasodilator and inhibitor of platelet aggregation. In vitro models have shown a relaxing effect of prostacyclin after induced contraction in cerebral arteries, and a recent pilot trial showed a positive effect on cerebral vasospasm in a clinical setting.

For this purpose the method of ultrasonic dopplerography with subsequent bilateral axillar cerebral angiography was used. The examinations were performed by the transcutaneous method in the author's modification. This made it possible to evaluate reliably the hemodynamics in the vertebral arteries in each patient using the asymmetry coefficient related to the linear speed of the blood flow in the vessels. It was found that in increase of the asymmetry coefficient by 50% or more was, as a rule, associated with an occluding process in one of the vertebral arteries. The agreement between the dopplerographic and the angiographic findings was observed in 80% of the cases of occlusions, and in 85,7% of the cases of vertebral artery stenoses. This makes it possible to recommend the ultrasonic dopplerography method for broad use in polyclinic conditions for examining patients with vertebrobasilar pathology, and for screening persons with an increased risk of cerebrovascular diseases."

Four-vessel angiograms disclosed no pathological findings. The patient was treated with bed rest and his blood pressure was maintained below 120 mmHg. Fortunately, no untoward events occurred during the period of bed rest, and a second vertebral angiogram was obtained 4 weeks after admission. At that time a vertebral artery aneurysm was discovered. At surgery a 3 X 3 X 3 mm aneurysm was found at the junction of the vertebral artery and a branch of the spinal artery. Small clots surrounding the aneurysm were removed. The aneurysm itself was easily clipped without destruction of the caudal cranial nerves and the patient recovered fully. The incidence of vertebral artery aneurysms is very small--about 5%. Moreover, to our knowledge an aneurysm on the proximal portion of the intracranial vertebral artery at the junction of the posterior-inferior cerebellar artery has never before been reported. On the other hand, our case might have been included among cases of subarachnoid hemorrhage of unknown etiology. The first cerebral angiogram revealed no aneurysm; it was found on the second set of angiograms. This case illustrates the importance of repeat angiography when the CT scan clearly shows a subarachnoid hemorrhage."

One hundred and sixteen presented with stroke (63%) and 68 patients with TIA (37%). One hundred and twenty-two were men (66.3%) and 62 were women (33.7%), mean age 63.5 years, range 25-86. The monitoring identified twelve (6.5%) patients with significant arrhythmias undetected by history, examination and admission electrocardiogram: six with atrial fibrillation (AF), four with 2 degrees heart block type Mobitz II and one each with 3 degrees heart block and sick sinus syndrome. Two-D echocardiography showed a previously unknown potential source for cardiac emboli in 22 patients (17.3%): segmental ventricular disease in eleven, mitral valve prolapse in seven, left ventricular thrombus in six, left ventricular aneurysm in three and one each with mitral valve endocarditis and global myocardial dysfunction. Only the mitral valve findings were expected on the basis of a previous M-mode echocardiographic study carried out in our city on healthy elderly volunteers. From the clinical history and all cardiac investigations, we found 59 patients (32%) with a possible cardiac source for cerebral emboli. After cerebral angiography, 29 of these 59 patients also showed a vascular lesion in the appropriate carotid artery and we could not decide definitely which lesion was responsible for the cerebral embolus. In the remaining 30 patients (16.4%), the evidence implicated the heart as the most likely source.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD009372,0,9039593,0,Contrast agents in functional MR imaging.,"Contrast agents have greatly expanded the role of MR imaging (MRI) to allow assessment of physiologic, or ""functional,"" parameters. Although activation mapping generally does not require contrast agents, other forms of functional MRI, including mapping of cerebral hemodynamics (eg, perfusion imaging), are best done with the use of contrast agents. Serial echo planar images are obtained after bolus injection of lanthanide chelates. Application of susceptibility contrast physics and standard tracer kinetic principles permits generation of relative cerebral blood volume maps. Deconvolution of cerebral blood flow and mean transit time parameters is also possible within technical limitations. By using diffusion and perfusion pulse sequences, an imaging correlate to the ischemic penumbra can be identified. Functional MRI perfusion imaging of intraaxial tumors is analogous to positron emission tomography for delineation of metabolic activity, yet may be even more sensitive to neovascularity and possesses improved image quality. Clinical applications include biopsy site selection and postirradiation follow-up. Further improvements in data analysis and map generation techniques may improve diagnostic accuracy and utility."

CD009372,0,1537062,0,Basic principles of magnetic resonance angiography.,"The flow of blood through magnetic field gradients and radiofrequency fields produces signal changes that can be used to distinguish blood vessels from surrounding stationary tissue. The field of magnetic resonance (MR) angiography attempts to overcome this limitation by creating images that depict blood vessels in a projective format similar to a conventional invasive angiogram, but without the need for ionizing radiation or a contrast agent. This article reviews basic concepts involved in MR angiography, including signal changes from time-of-flight and phase effects, maximum intensity projection algorithm for postprocessing of two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) image sets, and methods for flow quantification. Potential problems with MR angiography are considered, as well as means to overcome them."
CD009372,0,17290111,0,Traumatic cervical artery dissection.,"Traumatic cervical artery dissection (TCAD) is a complication of severe blunt head or neck trauma, the main cause being motor vehicle accidents. TCAD are increasingly recognized, and incidences of up to 0.86% for internal carotid and 0.53% for traumatic vertebral artery dissections (TVAD) among blunt trauma victims are reported. Diagnostic evaluation for TCAD is mandatory in the presence of (1) hemorrhage of potential arterial origin originating from the nose, ears, mouth, or a wound; (2) expanding cervical hematoma; (3) cervical bruit in a patient >50 years of age; (4) evidence of acute infarct at brain imaging; (5) unexplained central or lateralizing neurological deficit or transient ischemic attack, or (6) Horner syndrome, neck or head pain. In addition, a number of centers screen asymptomatic patients with blunt trauma for TCAD. Catheter angiography is the standard of reference for diagnosis of TCAD. Color duplex ultrasound, computed tomographic, and magnetic resonance angiography are noninvasive screening alternatives, but each method has its diagnostic limitations compared to catheter angiography. Anticoagulants and antiplatelet drugs may prevent ischemic stroke, but bleeding from traumatized tissues may offset the benefits of antithrombotic treatment. Endovascular therapy of dissected vessels, thrombarterectomy, direct suture of intimal tears, and extracranial-intracranial bypass should be considered in exceptional cases. Neurological outcome is probably worse in TCAD compared to spontaneous CAD, although it is unclear whether this is due to dissection-induced ischemic stroke or associated traumatic lesions."
CD009372,0,1537066,0,Pediatric magnetic resonance angiography: assessment of stroke.,"Thirty-one (59.6%) of 52 magnetic resonance angiographic (MRA) studies performed on pediatric patients were for evaluation of strokes. Thirteen of the 31 patients (41.9%) of MRA studies were positive for either vascular occlusion or congenital vascular malformation (arteriovenous, venous, or aneurysm). Results indicate that MRA is a valuable noninvasive diagnostic tool that can be routinely performed as part of the initial magnetic resonance evaluation, often thereby avoiding the need for conventional angiography in occlusive vascular disease, and permitting the performance of conventional angiography, in the case of vascular malformations, later when the patient is stable."
CD009372,0,1537068,0,Intracranial magnetic resonance angiography.,"Intraarterial angiography remains the ""gold standard"" for the evaluation of the intracranial vasculature, but it carries with it the risks of local vascular damage, systemic reactions, transient neurologic deficits, permanent neurologic compromise, and even death. To date, magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) has been applied to a variety of different manifestations of intracranial vascular disease. Presently, MRA studies and flow measurement techniques serve to compliment the more traditional spin-echo evaluation of patients with small aneurysms, arterial and venous occlusions, vascular malformations, and in some cases of neoplastic vascular invasion. Practically, the limitations of these techniques must be taken into account such that the appropriate method is applied to answer a specific clinical question and the acquisition parameters are chosen to maximize the sensitivity and specificity of the study. The intent of this review is to summarize the technical approaches, clinical role, pitfalls, and potential improvements in the MRA techniques as they apply to the intracranial circulation."

CD009372,0,1998890,0,The stroke syndrome of striatocapsular infarction.,"Striatocapsular infarction has recently been described as a distinct stroke entity and forms an important subgroup of subcortical infarctions. In a prospective study of 50 consecutive patients over a 10 yr period with this syndrome, clinical and neuropsychological features, pathogenesis and outcome were studied to provide information concerning management and prognosis. The most common clinical presentation was that of a stroke affecting mainly the upper limb with cortical signs such as dysphasia, neglect or dyspraxia. Evidence from EEG, angiographic and neuropsychological data supported a vascular/haemodynamic basis for the presence of the acute neuropsychological changes, while the chronic changes were more likely to be due to diaschisis. A study of risk factors and cerebral angiography enabled 4 pathophysiological subgroups to be identified: (1) cardiac emboli to the origin of the middle cerebral artery; (2) severe extra-cranial cranial carotid artery occlusive disease with presumed embolism to the same site and/or involvement of haemodynamic factors; (3) proximal middle cerebral artery abnormalities causing occlusion of multiple lateral striate arteries at their origins; (4) normal angiography where pathogenesis was uncertain. The risk factors of cardiac disease and smoking were significantly increased as compared with age and sex-matched controls with other forms of ischaemic stroke. Stroke or vascular death rate was 2.7% per yr during a mean follow-up period of 2.25 yrs. Predictors of an excellent recovery with return to normal lifestyle were younger age, only brachial or brachiofacial weakness with absence of cortical signs at presentation and minimal change on angiography. This stroke entity deserves particular recognition in the spectrum of subcortical infarctions because of its specific pathogenesis, distinct neuropsychological features and reasonable prognosis."

The sensor is 0.5 mm in diameter and was inserted into cortex tissue in 14 patients undergoing craniotomy for cerebrovascular surgery. A compromised cerebral circulation was identified in 8 of 14 patients by single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) scan, cerebral angiography, and transient ischemic episodes before surgery. Under baseline conditions with isoflurane anesthesia and normal blood gases, tissue P02 was lower in the eight compromised compared to six noncompromised patients (noncompromised 37 +/- 12 mm Hg, compromised 10 +/- 5 mm Hg; P < 0.05), PCO2 was increased (noncompromised 49 +/- 5 mm Hg, compromised 72 +/- 23 mm Hg; P < 0.05), and pH was decreased (noncompromised 7.16 +/- 0.08, compromised 6.82 +/- 0.21; P < 0.05). Critical tissue values for the identification of ischemia were a P02 of 20 mm Hg, PCO2 of 60 mm Hg, and a pH of 7.0. These results suggest that brain tissue measures of P02, PCO2, and pH provide information on the adequacy of cerebral perfusion in neurosurgical patients."

Computerized tomography (CT) and gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging demonstrated a large nonhomogeneous contrast-enhancing mass of the left frontal lobe, with a large cystic component. Cerebral angiography revealed the lesion to be highly vascular and fed entirely by the internal carotid artery system. The patient underwent craniotomy and the lesion was completely removed. Neuropathological study revealed that the tumor was a ganglioglioma. On review of the literature, it was found that gangliogliomas often present in the second and third decade, are known to have cystic components, and are contrast-enhancing on CT and MR imaging; however, they are classically known to be avascular on angiography. This case of a markedly vascular ganglioglioma emphasizes that these tumors should be included in the differential diagnosis of vascular supratentorial lesions."

In this study 44 patients with 45 ICH were included. All patients were investigated with MSCT and FD-CT during angiographic evaluation. As a control group we included 16 patients without ICH. In each haematoma we assessed volumetric data of the ICH and counted the numbers of ICH-positive slices. Using interobserver ratings, we additionally investigated the potential of FD-CT to serve as a diagnostic tool to detect ICH. In FD-CT three haematomas were not detected because of motion and beam-hardening artefacts in the region close to the skull base. The r value for the degree of interobserver agreement for the number of slices was 0.95 for MSCT and 0.94 for FD-CT. Measurements of the area and the calculated volume of the ICH showed high inter- and intraobserver agreement. Our results indicate that FD-CT is a helpful tool in the daily emergency management of ICH patients as detection of ICH was found to be nearly as reliable as in MSCT. Limitations of this technology are motion and beam-hardening artefacts that may mask small haematomas located in the posterior fossa or the skull base."

The association of BA aplasia with two aneurysms on the dominant posterior communicating artery (PCoA) has not been previously reported. This 40-year-old man presented in a state of drowsiness and responded to simple commands only after being coaxed. He had complete left cranial third nerve palsy, right hemiparesis, and persisting signs of meningeal irritation. A computerized tomography (CT) scan revealed subarachnoid and intraventricular hemorrhage. An angiogram revealed BA aplasia. The right PCoA followed a sinuous course with multiple loops and provided the dominant supply to the posterior circulation. This vessel harbored two aneurysms, one at the origin of the PCoA from the internal carotid artery and the other at the looping segment just proximal to the brainstem. The left PCoA was extremely thin. The pterional transsylvian approach was used to clip the two aneurysms on the PCoA. The hemodynamic changes produced by the BA aplasia may have produced alterations in the cerebral vasculature leading to aneurysm formation and consequent subarachnoid hemorrhage."
CD009372,0,11296888,0,Cerebral cast angiography as an aid to medicolegal autopsies in cases of death after adult cardiac surgery.,"Due to an increase in age of the patient population in cardiac surgery, cerebral complications are increasing in frequency, also as a cause of death. In order to reveal cerebral pathology associated with a fatal outcome after cardiac surgery, we re-evaluated the cast angiographs and medico-legal autopsy documents of 144 adult cardiac surgery subjects over a 7-year period. Special attention was paid to the ability of post-mortem cast angiography to aid in diagnosing cerebral pathology. The autopsy detected new ischemic cerebral lesions in 29 (20%) cases, of which 22 (15.3%) were recent infarcts, and 7 were cases of anoxic brain damage. Of the recent cerebral infarcts, 12 were associated with cerebral artery thrombosis, 4 showed multiple lesions, and the remaining 6 were small single infarcts. In addition, one subject had an intracerebral hemorrhage and 72 (50%) cerebral edema. By cast angiography, the leakage of contrast medium in the case of intracerebral hemorrhage and stenoses of intracranial and cervical arteries could be well demonstrated and also revealed 17 (77%) of the 22 recent cerebral infarcts. It was found to be suitable for detecting recent brain infarcts associated with main cerebral artery thrombosis, with a sensitivity of 92% (11 out of 12 cases), but was less sensitive in showing small recent infarcts with a sensitivity of 60% (6 out of 10 cases) and inferior for the older ones where none of the 6 cases were detected. Filling defects caused by cerebral edema were difficult to differentiate from technical errors and were encountered in 7 (4.8%) cases. A significant predictor for the 29 recent ischemic brain lesions was perioperative hypotension. The immediate cause of death was most often of cardiac (83%) and cerebral (14%) origin. In 14 cases, cerebral damage was considered to be an additional cause of death. The use of cerebral post-mortem cast angiography should be recommended, especially for its excellent ability to visualize intravascular pathology such as arterial stenoses and thromboses, with a 92% sensitivity in showing new main cerebral artery thromboses, before likely distortion of the vascular anatomy by dissection."

CD009372,0,2512776,0,Comparison of MR imaging with clinical history in the identification of hemorrhage in patients with cerebral arteriovenous malformations.,"Twenty-nine patients with true arteriovenous malformations as diagnosed by MR imaging or angiography were examined by MR to detect the presence of hemosiderin deposition, a marker for remote hemorrhage. The resulting information was compared with the clinical record to determine the frequency with which MR demonstrated prior hemorrhagic episodes where no clinical evidence for such episodes existed. Twenty (69%) of 29 patients with arteriovenous malformations showed evidence of acute or older hemorrhage. In four (14%) of 29 cases MR showed a hypointense signal on long TR images, suggesting hemosiderin, but no clinical history could account for prior hemorrhage. Additionally, six (21%) of 29 patients had a clinical history suggestive of acute hemorrhage, but no evidence of bleeding was found on MR. The presence of prior or current hemorrhage is critical to deciding whether to surgically resect the arteriovenous malformation or to treat it conservatively, because of the high rate of rebleeding in patients presenting with hemorrhage or those with a history of this disorder. For this reason, MR imaging has an important role in the management of patients with arteriovenous malformations."

CD009372,0,8797947,0,Regional association of developmental venous anomalies with angiographically occult vascular malformations.,"This study reviews the neuroradiological findings of 43 patients with a developmental venous anomaly in order to discuss the clinical significance of this entity. All patients underwent unenhanced and contrast-enhanced computer tomography and magnetic resonance tomography, as well as selective angiography, and were followed for at least 2 years. In 40% (17 of 43) of patients a cryptic vascular malformation was found in the proximity to the developmental venous anomaly. Neurological symptoms were present in 8 of 17 patients (47%) in this group. Patients with an isolated developmental venous anomaly had symptoms in 19% (5 of 26), but none of them had experienced a hemorrhage. Magnetic resonance was the most sensitive method for the diagnosis of both types of lesions and alterations of the adjacent parenchyma. These results further support that developmental venous anomalies represent a clinically benign entity. However, patients with an association of a developmental venous anomaly and a cryptic vascular malformation are at risk for hemorrhage from their angiographically occult vascular malformation. Magnetic resonance proved to be the imaging modality of choice for both entities and is appropriate for diagnosis and follow-up."
CD009372,0,20448426,0,Cerebral vasospasms after intraventricular hemorrhage from an arteriovenous malformation: case report.,"A 33-year-old female presented with a rare case of severe vasospasm following the rupture of an arteriovenous malformation (AVM) without subarachnoid hemorrhage. Initial computed tomography (CT) revealed a subcutaneous hematoma and cast formation of intraventricular clots without the deposition of subarachnoid blood in any basal cistern. Cerebral angiography revealed a small AVM located in the right parietal lobe without aneurysmal formations. Repeat CT demonstrated no evidence of subarachnoid clots expected with the presence of intraventricular clots and she was transferred to a general ward. She suffered sudden onset of motor aphasia and disturbance of consciousness on Day 17 after the hemorrhage. Magnetic resonance imaging indicated diffuse cortical infarction and subsequent magnetic resonance angiography revealed severe narrowing of the bilateral internal carotid arteries. Three-dimensional CT angiography on the same day indicated similar findings. She was transferred back to the intensive care unit for critical treatment. However, she suffered persistent mild right hemiparesis and motor aphasia. The characteristic features of vasospasm after intraventricular hemorrhage from AVMs are delayed onset, acute deterioration of consciousness, female predominance, and localization to the bilateral internal carotid arteries. Treatment of patients with AVM rupture should consider the risk of severe vasospasm, even if there is no subarachnoid clot."
CD009372,0,19272513,0,Cerebrovascular disease.,"Effective management of patients who have cerebrovascular disease depends on accurate diagnosis. Many conditions cause clinical findings that closely mimic cerebrovascular disorders and are often ruled out through brain imaging or laboratory findings. Diagnosis of cerebrovascular disorders is based on the presence of risk factors for vascular disease, the tempo of onset, the presence of concurrent conditions, and the clinical course of development of neurologic symptoms and signs. This article shares a process by which clinicians can combine a patient's history, neurologic examination, and brain and vascular imaging to localize a lesion and diagnose cerebrovascular disease."

MRA can demonstrate arteries to the second set of branches beyond the main cerebral vessels. It has the advantage of being able to produce rapidly and noninvasively 3-D images and, unlike conventional angiography, it can be repeated at will.

CD009372,0,660265,0,Occlusive arteriopathy and brain tumor.,"Four cases with the association of occlusive arteriopathy and brain tumor are presented. A clinical analysis of these cases and cases reported in the literature revealed that occlusive arteriopathy at the base of the brain was often associated with a slowly growing basal tumor in children. Possible causes of occlusive arteriopathy in these cases were compression of the circle of Willis by a slowly growing basal tumor, secondary artial occlusive changes by radiation therapy for a basal tumor, or vasculopathy associated with neurocutaneous syndrome. Symptoms of sudden onset or episodic nature suggest the presence of occlusive arteriopathy rather than the mass effect of a tumor. Cerebral angiography is mandatory whenever computerized tomography (CT), performed to rule out recurrence of a basal tumor, shows an ischemic lesion with low-density areas without any evidence of mass effect of the tumor. Cerebral angiography is also necessary when a basal tumor is suspected in children, particularly in cases associated with neurocutaneous syndrome and a basal tumor. Care should be taken not to scarify the abnormal vascular network at the base of the brain at the time of operation, because it is considered to be functioning as collateral circulation. The potential hazards of radiotherapy to radiation-induced occlusive changes of the circle of Willis must be considered in treating a benign basal brain tumor in children. Even in adults, repeated large doses of irradiation could cause occlusive arteriopathy."
CD009372,0,10602974,0,Dynamic contrast-enhanced subtraction MR angiography in intracranial vascular abnormalities.,"We present our clinical experience with dynamic contrast-enhanced MR angiography (MRA) with subtraction for assessing intracranial vascular abnormalities. Ten patients with various cerebrovascular disorders underwent dynamic contrast-enhanced MRA on a 1.0-T system. Thirty sections (2 mm) were acquired in 29-30 s. Maximum intensity projection images and subtracted source images were compared with those obtained by conventional angiography. In all cases, the presence or absence of abnormalities in the targeted vessels, as well as the morphology of the sagittal sinuses, was clearly visualized as in conventional angiography, without any obstructions such as hyperintense hematomas or thrombi, or intraluminal turbulence. Although the temporal and spatial resolutions with current hardware are insufficient, these preliminary results suggest that dynamic contrast-enhanced MRA with subtraction may be useful for assessing vascular lesions with hemorrhage or thrombus, and the dural sinuses."

Predictive value of CT compared with angiography.,"The aim of the present study was to assess the diagnostic accuracy of CT in determining the underlying causes of brain hematomas with a state-of-the art CT. For this purpose, CT and angiographic data of 149 subjects with spontaneous intracerebral hematomas (ICH) were statistically compared in a blind, retrospective study, taking angiography, supported when possible by surgical findings, as providing the correct diagnoses. 5 groups were distinguished on the basis of CT data: 103 patients with isolated deep ICH had normal angiograms; 9 patients with isolated superficial ICH and 8 with deep ICH and intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) had arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). 4 with this combination showed no angiographic abnormalities, one had an aneurysm. 14 subjects with ICH and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) had a middle cerebral or carotid artery aneurysm; and 10 with ICH, SAH and IVH had also an aneurysm, in 7 on the anterior communicating artery. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values were respectively: for AVMs 100, 96, 77 and 100%; and for aneurysms 96, 100, 100 and 99%. Kendall coefficient was 0.95, indicating close correlation between the two modalities. This study confirms that CT can accurately predict the likelihood, nature and location of vascular ICHs. It indicates whether angiography is necessary or not, and if so, what vascular tree ought to be explored."

The patient was heterozygotic for the G A mutation in position 20210 of the prothrombin gene, which is linked with a high risk of thrombosis. She was given heparin intravenously, but continued to display endocranial hypertension and tissue ischemia with partial response to hyperosmolar agents and barbituric coma. She was therefore submitted to selective catheterization of the superior sagittal sinus and continuous local fibrinolysis with urokinase for 72 hours.

CD009372,0,17705007,0,Cerebral hemorrhage with angiographic extravasation immediately after carotid artery stenting.,Recognizing cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome with intracerebral hemorrhage following carotid artery stenting is critical because the mortality rate is high. This type of hemorrhage usually arises from within several hours to a few days after the procedure.

CD009372,0,3419568,0,Traumatic aneurysms of brain due to high velocity missile head wounds.,"Two hundred twenty-three of 255 consecutive patients underwent cerebral angiography 16.9 +/- 11.6 days (SD) after high velocity missile injury to the head over a 29-month study period. Shell fragments were the most frequent projectiles (73.7%), and penetrating wounds were the most frequent injuries (61%). During the study, 2 patients (1 with an ophthalmic and the other with an anterior cerebral artery aneurysm) presented with delayed traumatic intracerebral hematoma; the first patient had had negative angiography 90 days earlier, and the second patient was admitted from a rehabilitation center after operation in another center 25 days earlier for a penetrating left frontal shell fragment injury. Six of 223 patients (2.7%) had dormant aneurysms (4 middle and 2 anterior cerebral arteries). Seven of 8 patients were operated on again to exclude their aneurysms from the cerebral circulation. Two of 8 patients died postoperatively (1 within 24 hours and another 51 days after discharge from the hospital in a vegetative state). Fragments penetrating temporal, temporoparietal, or pterional areas had a significantly greater chance of causing arterial injury (chi 2 = 11.46, P less than 0.001). There was a significant chance of having an aneurysm if a hematoma was seen at operation or on computed tomography of the head (chi 2 = 4.18, P less than 0.05). The penetrating mode of injury and shell fragments crossing the midline were two variables for which the statistical significance had a P value of 0.08. It is concluded that war casualties with penetrating shell fragment injuries near the pterion, especially when harboring intracerebral hematomas, should undergo cerebral angiography to rule out vascular injuries of the brain."

CD009372,0,15693812,0,Risk factors for occlusive lesions of intracranial arteries in stroke-free Japanese.,"The aim of this study was to identify relevant risk factors for occlusive lesions of the intracranial arteries in stroke-free population. The subjects of this study were 425 patients without a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack and without any abnormality on a neurological examination who consecutively visited a neurology clinic between January 1994 and June 2001 requesting medical evaluation for possible cerebrovascular diseases. Subjects included 245 men and 180 women ranging in age from 33 to 89 years (mean+/-SD=64.0+/-10.0 years). We performed cervical and intracranial magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) in all subjects. Using a validated rating scheme of MRA for occlusive lesions, we evaluated the degree of stenoses in the extracranial portion of the internal carotid artery (ICA) and the intracranial arteries including the intracranial portion of the ICA, middle cerebral artery (MCA) stem, intracranial portion of the vertebral artery (VA), and basilar artery (BA). More than 25% stenoses were regarded as significant lesions in this study. Multiple logistic regression analyses showed that significant and independent predictors for extracranial ICA lesions were age, hyperlipidemia, and ischemic heart disease (IHD), those for intracranial ICA lesions were age, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and IHD, those for MCA lesions were age and hypertension, those for intracranial VA lesions were hyperlipidemia and IHD, and those for BA lesions were hypertension and diabetes mellitus. The present study suggested that atherosclerosis of the intracranial VA was related to hyperlipidemia and IHD as was the case for the extracranial carotid artery, whilst atherosclerosis of other sites of intracranial arteries was associated with hypertension and diabetes mellitus in stroke-free Japanese."
CD009372,0,21571479,0,Semiautomated detection of cerebral microbleeds in magnetic resonance images.,"Cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) are increasingly being recognized as an important biomarker for neurovascular diseases. So far, all attempts to count and quantify them have relied on manual methods that are time-consuming and can be inconsistent. A technique is presented that semiautomatically identifies CMBs in susceptibility weighted images (SWI). This will both reduce the processing time and increase the consistency over manual methods. This technique relies on a statistical thresholding algorithm to identify hypointensities within the image. A support vector machine (SVM) supervised learning classifier is then used to separate true CMB from other marked hypointensities. The classifier relies on identifying features such as shape and signal intensity to identify true CMBs. The results from the automated section are then subject to manual review to remove false-positives. This technique is able to achieve a sensitivity of 81.7% compared with the gold standard of manual review and consensus by multiple reviewers. In subjects with many CMBs, this presents a faster alternative to current manual techniques at the cost of some lost sensitivity."

A 19-year-old woman in the 35th week of gestation by date was admitted due to a sudden onset of generalized clonic convulsion and disturbance of consciousness. The diagnosis was eclampsia. On the second hospital day, extraction of a stillborn female was performed by laminaria. Thereafter, the consciousness improved rapidly and she became alert on the following day. She was discharged without neurological deficit on the 18th hospital day. A CT scan on the day of admission showed narrow lateral ventricles and symmetrical low-density lesions in and around the basal ganglia. These had almost disappeared by the 10th hospital day. Carotid angiography on admission revealed no abnormality in the arterial phase including the lenticulostriate arteries, but, early appearance of deep cerebral veins and some cortical veins was noted. These deep veins, however, were not distinct even in the venous phase. These angiographic findings suggested medullary dilatation caused by circulatory disturbance of the deep cerebral veins. Most authors have stressed the contribution of diffuse arterial vasospasm in the pathogenesis of eclampsia in relation to low-density lesions on CT scans. In the present case, we could not find vasospasm but found circulatory disturbance of the deep cerebral veins. These angiographic findings suggested that the appearance of the low-density lesions on the CT scan was most likely due to venous congestion caused by circulatory disturbance of the deep cerebral veins, since most of the deep medullary veins in the low-density lesions flowed into the deep cerebral veins.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

An initial head CT showed a thin SAH in the interhemispheric cistern and cortical sulcus of the left frontal surface. Subsequent MRI performed 10 min after head CT scan revealed a fresh infarction in the left ACA region. MR-and digital subtraction angiograms demonstrated a dissection in the A2 portion of the left ACA with a leak of contrast media around the left A3 portion, suggesting that the bleeding occurred in a distal portion of the main dilation. Without anti-thrombotic therapy, the patient recovered without complications by blood pressure control and administration of brain-function protection therapies. We found 11 cases similar to the present case in the literature. All cases presented with lower-extremity dominant hemiparesis; however, sudden onset headache was rare. Blood pressure was not well-controlled in 4 out of the 6 known hypertensive cases. Main sites of dissection were located at the A2 portion in all cases except one A3 lesion, and extended to A3 in 2 cases. Conservative therapy led to favorable outcome in 8 cases, while 4 cases underwent surgical interventions for increasing risk of aneurysm rupture after initial observational therapies. Re-bleeding did not occur in any of the 12 cases reviewed. These data suggest that conservative treatment can be considered for an initial management of ACAD with simultaneous CI and SAH. More evidence needs to be accumulated to establish the optimal therapeutic approach for ACAD associated with CI and SAH."

Since the beginning of this decade, a fundamental change has taken place: Perfusion- and diffusion-MRI have shown to be capable of depicting the ischemic injury immediately after vessel occlusion. While perfusion MRI is sensitive to abnormalities in cerebral capillary blood flow (micro-circulation), diffusion MRI indicates tissue damage on a cellular level.

We investigated the degree of thrombus resolution and factors associated with thrombus resolution after intravenous (IV) recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) using thin-section noncontrast computed tomography (NCT). Thin-section NCTs were performed before and immediately after IV rt-PA infusion in acute stroke patients. The thrombus volume and Hounsfield unit were measured using three-dimensional imaging software. Immediate recanalisation was assessed immediately after IV rt-PA infusion using CT angiography. During a three-year study period, 130 patients were prospectively enrolled. On baseline thin-section NCT, no thrombi were found in 30 patients (23%). Among the 100 patients with confirmed thrombus, the median volume decreased by 20% on the follow-up NCT. The thrombus was completely resolved in 8%. Of note, an increase in thrombus volume was observed in 20 patients. Independent predictors of thrombus resolution were total rt-PA dose, thrombus location in the M2 segment of the middle cerebral artery, and time from baseline to follow-up NCT. Thrombus resolution increased by 9% per each 10-mg increase in rt-PA (p = 0.045). Immediate complete recanalisation was achieved in 12% of patients. Total dose of rt-PA was independently associated with complete recanalisation [odds ratio [OR] 4.52, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.345-15.184) and good functional outcome at three months (modified Rankin scale score <3, OR 2.34, 95% CI 1.104-4.962). In conclusion, rt-PA dose was associated with the degree of thrombus resolution, immediate complete recanalisation, and good outcome at three months.

CD009372,0,6621748,0,[Cardiac cerebral embolism].,"135 cases of cardiogenic emboli to the brain are reported in view of symptoms, diagnosis, prognosis and therapy. Brain embolism occurred most often in ischemic heart disease with atrial fibrillation, followed by valvular heart disease, myocardial infarction and carditis. Usually there was a sudden onset of neurological symptoms during the morning hours. Initial lapses of consciousness were a bad prognostic sign--they appeared as well as seizures more often in embolic than in thrombotic brain infarctions. The clearly higher incidence of emboli to the left cerebral hemisphere has anatomical reasons. Angiographic findings depend on the time of examination; common are occlusions of the supraclinoid portion of the internal carotid artery, media-occlusions at the trifurcation, media-branch-occlusions and disturbed middle cerebral blood flow. CT and lumbar puncture do not support the diagnosis. Cardiologic examination should include X-ray of the chest, long time electrocardiogram and echocardiography. In view of a mortality of 22 per cent and major neurological residual symptoms in 34 percent the prognosis of brain embolism is serious. Early anticoagulant therapy in the absence of brain hemorrhage in CT seems to improve the prognosis by preventing reembolization."

CD009372,0,20824304,0,A fast and fully automatic method for cerebrovascular segmentation on time-of-flight (TOF) MRA image.,"The precise three-dimensional (3-D) segmentation of cerebral vessels from magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) images is essential for the detection of cerebrovascular diseases (e.g., occlusion, aneurysm). The complex 3-D structure of cerebral vessels and the low contrast of thin vessels in MRA images make precise segmentation difficult. We present a fast, fully automatic segmentation algorithm based on statistical model analysis and improved curve evolution for extracting the 3-D cerebral vessels from a time-of-flight (TOF) MRA dataset. Cerebral vessels and other tissue (brain tissue, CSF, and bone) in TOF MRA dataset are modeled by Gaussian distribution and combination of Rayleigh with several Gaussian distributions separately. The region distribution combined with gradient information is used in edge-strength of curve evolution as one novel mode. This edge-strength function is able to determine the boundary of thin vessels with low contrast around brain tissue accurately and robustly. Moreover, a fast level set method is developed to implement the curve evolution to assure high efficiency of the cerebrovascular segmentation. Quantitative comparisons with 10 sets of manual segmentation results showed that the average volume sensitivity, the average branch sensitivity, and average mean absolute distance error are 93.6%, 95.98%, and 0.333 mm, respectively. By applying the algorithm to 200 clinical datasets from three hospitals, it is demonstrated that the proposed algorithm can provide good quality segmentation capable of extracting a vessel with a one-voxel diameter in less than 2 min. Its accuracy and speed make this novel algorithm more suitable for a clinical computer-aided diagnosis system."

Angiography demonstrated string-of-beads sign typical of fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) in the extracranial carotid and vertebral arteries. The aneurysm and the parent artery were successfully embolized with Guglielmi detachable coils. Severe vasospasm developed 1 week after admission, and was treated several times by selective injection of vasodilator. A new aneurysm of the left external carotid artery became evident 1 month later, whereas only slight dilation had previously been apparent. This angiographic sequence demonstrated a new arterial dissection. Despite the possibility of damage to the artery during multiple catheterizations, arterial wall changes caused by FMD appear to have been primarily responsible. This case emphasizes the need for particular care in performing vascular interventional procedures in the presence of FMD."

Digital subtraction angiogram showing thrombosis of the left transverse and sigmoid sinus. An intravenously administered regimen of heparin was begun, because of a protein S deficiency. On the 6th day the patients level of consciousness deteriorated, necessitating intubation, hyperventilation, and mannitol. Repeat CT scan revealed increasing edema with midline shift and obliteration of the basal cisterns, although the hemorrhagic lesion was unchanged. The patient developed signs of diencephalic dysfunction. A large left temporoparietooccipital craniectomy was performed and the dura was opened. The multiloculated intraparenchymatous hemorrhage portion of the brain was not removed. In addition, the patient was treated postoperatively with heparin therapy for three months, than a regimen of phenprocoumon was begun.

CD009372,0,19119890,0,Intracranial subarachnoid hemorrhage resulting from cervical spine dural arteriovenous fistulas: literature review and case presentation.,"Cervical dural arteriovenous fistulas (dAVFs) are a rare cause of intracranial subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) but should be considered when other sources are not found. Subarachnoid hemorrhage caused by dAVF is thought to occur as a result of venous hypertension in most cases. The clinical presentation, acute onset of severe headache, is similar to that in patients with other causes of SAH; however, severe neurological deficits (Hunt and Hess Grade IV and V SAH) have not been reported in SAH caused by cervical dAVFs. Patients with this type of SAH commonly report suboccipital headache, neck pain, and nausea, and thus these hemorrhages can be easily dismissed as perimesencephalic SAH. Vigilant evaluation with 4-vessel cerebral angiography, including selective catheterization of both proximal vertebral arteries, should be performed. The practice of unilateral vertebral artery injection with reflux into the contralateral vertebral and posterior inferior cerebellar arteries has the potential to overlook cervical dAVF. Magnetic resonance imaging may be useful to evaluate for other causes of SAH but is probably not sensitive for the identification of a cervical dAVF.

In the patient with myelopathy, angiographic exploration began with a spinal angiogram. Bilateral vertebral angiography initially failed to demonstrate the fistula, and a tentorial DAVF was established with carotid artery angiography.

The introduction of newer fibrinolytics along with the development of interventional catheterization techniques have extended its use to previously untreated events such as cerebrovascular occlusions. Between 1989-1991 six patients with basilar and/or middle cerebral artery thrombosis were treated at the University Hospital, Basel, by superselective local intraarterial infusion of 400,000 U/h urokinase for 1-2 hours. Two of four patients with basilar artery occlusion showed complete remission one year after the intervention. The third showed no neurological improvement despite angiographic recanalization, and 48 h later suffered a fatal brainstem haemorrhage, while the fourth did not recover from coma and succumbed. Both patients with occlusion of the middle cerebral artery showed complete recanalization, but one had complete and the other partial neurological remission. Signs of slight systemic fibrinolysis were present but never attained the intensity of systemic therapeutic fibrinolysis as the antiplasmin and fibrinogen values showed. In summary, local therapeutic fibrinolysis contributes to the reduction of mortality and to remission of symptoms in occlusions of basilar artery, and offers some advantage in occlusions of the middle cerebral artery. A definite benefit from the latter will be proved only through large-scale randomized trials. The indication for local therapeutic fibrinolysis for thromboses of cerebral arteries requires a careful benefit-risk evaluation, an experienced angiography team and a special infrastructure for computed tomography and digital subtraction angiography."

The blinded readers determined that enhanced MR angiography provided more information for visualization of vascular anatomy in more than 60% of cases. The additional information provided with gadoteridol would have changed the diagnosis in nine (8%) of 107 lesions seen by the unblinded readers, 11 (12%) of 90 lesions seen by reader A, and three (3%) of 93 lesions seen by reader B. The results confirm that the use of gadoteridol improves the visualization of intracranial vascular lesions with MR angiography. The authors conclude that development of new postprocessing algorithms will improve the utility of contrast-enhanced MR angiography."

In seven patients, nine out of ten cavernomas were removed by microsurgery. While MR-angiography demonstrated well branches of brain arteries adjacent to the lesions, no flow signal in the vascular malformations was observed. On the other hand, there was a high intensity signal induced by methaemoglobin in those three patients with brainstem cavernomas who had experienced a significant bleeding attack seven months prior to admission. It had a spotted appearance in MR-angiography with volumes of the largest spots around 1.8 cm3.

A 47-year-old male initially presented with a headache and became comatose 3 weeks later. CT and MR imaging demonstrated a massive hematoma in the right caudate head projecting into the lateral ventricle. A 60-year-old male sustained heaviness of his left extremities 8 days prior to admission and his condition gradually deteriorated. Neuroimaging revealed a right thalamic hematoma adjacent to the lateral ventricle. Cerebral angiography, CT, and MR imaging failed to detect any vascular anomaly. The hematomas increased in size gradually and were surgically explored. The histological diagnosis was arteriovenous malformation for the first case and cavernous angioma for the second case that had ruptured repeatedly. These cases were unique in the unusual location in the subependyma, and diagnostic neuroimaging modalities could not disclose the vascular anomalies, and the hematomas enlarged progressively to become critically symptomatic. Surgical intervention is mandatory for mass reduction and correct diagnosis of such lesions, with favorable outcome as long as the surgery is not delayed until too late."

CD009372,0,12869717,0,Trial design and reporting standards for intra-arterial cerebral thrombolysis for acute ischemic stroke.,"The National Institutes of Health (NIH) estimates that stroke costs now exceed 45 billion dollars per year. Stroke is the third leading cause of death and one of the leading causes of adult disability in North America, Europe, and Asia. A number of well-designed randomized stroke trials and case series have now been reported in the literature to evaluate the safety and efficacy of thrombolytic therapy for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke. These stroke trials have included intravenous studies, intra-arterial studies, and combinations of both, as well as use of mechanical devices for removal of thromboemboli and of neuroprotectant drugs, alone or in combination with thrombolytic therapy. At this time, the only therapy demonstrated to improve outcomes from an acute stroke is thrombolysis of the clot responsible for the ischemic event. There is room for improvement in stroke lysis studies. Divergent criteria, with disparate reporting standards and definitions, have made direct comparisons between stroke trials difficult to compare and contrast in terms of overall patient outcomes and efficacy of treatment. There is a need for more uniform definitions of multiple variables such as collateral flow, degree of recanalization, assessment of perfusion, and infarct size. In addition, there are multiple unanswered questions that require further investigation, in particular, questions as to which patients are best treated with thrombolysis. One of the most important predictors of clinical success is time to treatment, with early treatment of <3 hours for intravenous tissue plasminogen activator and <6 hours for intra-arterial thrombolysis demonstrating significant improvement in terms of 90-day clinical outcome and reduced cerebral hemorrhage. It is possible that improved imaging that identifies the ischemic penumbra and distinguishes it from irreversibly infarcted tissue will more accurately select patients for therapy than duration of symptoms. There are additional problems in the assessment of patients eligible for thrombolysis. These include being able to predict whether a particular site of occlusion can be successfully revascularized, predict an individual patient's prognosis and outcome after revascularization, and in particular, to predict the development of intracerebral hemorrhage, with and without clinical deterioration. It is not clear to assume that achieving immediate flow restoration due to thrombolytic therapy implies clinical success and improved outcome. There is no simple correlation between recanalization and observed clinical benefit in all ischemic stroke patients, because other interactive variables, such as collateral circulation, the ischemic penumbra, lesion location and extent, time to treatment, and hemorrhagic conversion, are all interrelated to outcome."
CD009372,0,11424358,0,[Usefulness of time-resolved projection MRA on evaluation of hemodynamics in cerebral occlusive diseases].,"The usefulness for evaluation of cerebral hemodynamics using time-resolved projection MRA was studied in normal volunteers and patients of cerebrovascular diseases. Six normal volunteers and ten patients with cerebrovascular occlusive diseases including 6 of IC occlusion and 4 of post EC/IC bypass surgery underwent time-resolved projection MRA on a 1.5 T clinical MRI system. Projection angiograms are acquired with 2 D-fast SPGR sequence with a time resolution of approximately one image per second, 40 images being acquired consecutively before and after bolus injection Gd-DTPA. And all images were calculated by complex subtraction from the background mask in a work station. In normal volunteers, the quality of images of time-resolved projection MRA was satisfactory. The arteries from internal carotid artery through M 2 segment of middle cerebral artery and all major venous systems were well portrayed. In 4 cases of IC occlusion who were assessed the collateral flow through the anterior communicating artery and posterior communicating artery, there were delayed to demonstrate the ipsilateral MCA. However, in 2 cases of IC occlusion that were assessed the collateral flow through leptomeningeal anastomosis, ipsilateral MCA and collateral circulation were not demonstrated. In all patients of post EC/IC bypass surgery, the patency of EC/IC bypass could be evaluated as properly with time-resolved projection MRA as 3 D-TOF MRA. Although the temporal and spatial resolutions are insufficient, time-resolved projection MRA was powerful non-invasive method to evaluate the cerebral hemodynamics via the basal communicating arteries in IC occlusion and identify the patency of EC/IC bypass."
CD009372,0,8752465,0,[MRA].,"With the recent development of MR techniques, it has become possible to obtain angiographic images (MRA) of relatively good quality with use of MR. The major indications of MRA have been to elucidate the MR findings on spin echo images when vascular lesions are suspected and to use MRA for conventional angiography when the latter is contra-indicated or additional information is needed. Follow-up studies of vascular diseases can be easily performed with MRA. The sensitivity of this technique for cerebral aneurysms is 73.6%, whereas specificity is 76.2%. The sensitivity and specificity for cerebrovascular diseases are 88.7% and 97.4% for stenoses of more than 50.0%. Because of rather limited diagnostic accuracy, this technique cannot be applied freely for screening of cerebral diseases, especially in mass survey for unruptured cerebral aneurysms. There have been many new techniques proposed for improvement of spatial resolution of MRA, including magnitisation transfer contrast (MTC), tilted optimized non-satulation excitation (TONE) and high resolution images. With full development of these new techniques, MRA will be used more freely in the diagnosis of vascular diseases."
CD009372,0,6392918,0,[Digital subtraction angiography of the cerebral vessels by intraarterial injection].,"Three hundred and fifty-seven digital subtraction angiography (DSA) were performed in 184 neurosurgical patients by intraarterial injection. Examinations consisted of 192 carotid angiography, 110 vertebral angiography, 23 aortography, 11 spinal angiography and 21 other angiography. In all examinations, visualization of the vessels was excellent and the complications were never experienced. High contrast sensitivity of DSA resulted in better visualization of tumor stains, phlebogram, and arteries in cerebral arteriovenous malformations with large shunt blood flow than conventional angiography. Selective catheterization into each cerebral arteries was not necessarily demanded for good opacification of the vessels because of high sensitivity. High contrast sensitivity also permitted low concentration of contrast material, small dose of contrast material, and slow injection rate. Low concentration of contrast material reduced pain and heat during injection especially in the external carotid and vertebral angiography. Using slow injection, recoiling of catheter into the aorta was reduced, so that injection from the innominate and subclavian arteries for visualization of origin of the cerebral arteries were always successful. Full study of cerebral arteries by Seldinger's method, if necessary, was easily achieved using DSA even in patient with high age or with severe atherosclerosis. Bolus injection of small dose of contrast material as well as serial imaging was helpful in evaluating hemodynamics in the lesion. Real time display of DSA reduced the time required for angiography and was very convenient for artificial embolization. Besides these advantages, DSA became comparable to conventional angiography in special resolution by use of intraarterial injection and could be a preoperative genuine examination as well as a screening method."

CD009372,0,20885090,0,Improved visualization of intracranial vessels by gradient moment nulling in hybrid of opposite-contrast magnetic resonance angiography (HOP MRA).,"Hybrid of opposite-contrast (HOP) magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) is a new method that combines the advantages of 3-dimensional (3D) time-of-flight (TOF) MRA and black-blood (BB) MRA without prolonging acquisition time. In phantom and clinical studies, we focused on image differences when we applied gradient moment nulling (GMN) to 2 or 3 axes in the first echo. We made an original phantom with a semicircular tube of 3- and 5-mm internal diameter, with flow rate in the tube of 0, 20, 60, 80, or 120 cm/s. In original images of the phantom obtained with TOF MRA and flow-sensitive BB MRA and in filter frequency-weighted subtraction (FWS) processed images acquired with HOP MRA, we measured the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) of both the inside and outside of the tubes. In FWS processed images with GMN applied to 2 axes, the CNR was high at various flow rates in both straight and bending portions of the tubes in comparison with TOF images. In a clinical study in 15 patients, we evaluated vessel visualization in images obtained using conventional TOF MRA with magnetization transfer contrast (MTC) and HOP MRA. In clinical studies, visualization scores of HOP MRA were equivalent to those of conventional TOF MRA in the bilateral internal carotid arteries (ICA) and inferior in the basilar arteries. However, visualization of the peripheral portion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) improved significantly in HOP MRA with GMN applied to 2 and 3 axes. Visualization of the main trunk of the ICA and MCA was superior in HOP MRA with GMN applied to 2 axes. HOP MRA with 2-axis GMN may be useful for excellent visualization of both major arteries and peripheral vessels in the head."
CD009372,0,22118795,1,Vascular imaging adds value in investigation of basal ganglia hemorrhage.,"The risk of basal ganglia hemorrhage (BGH) increases in patients of older age and with hypertension. Current guidelines do not recommend routine vascular imaging. However, a proportion of patients with BGH have underlying vascular abnormalities, and these patients may require a different treatment approach. We aimed to assess the proportion of underlying vascular abnormalities in patients with BGH. In this retrospective study, we included all patients who presented with BGH between January 2007 and December 2009 at a single institution. The following data were collected: patient demographics, vascular risk factors, medications, volume of hematoma, CT scans, CT angiogram, magnetic resonance angiography and digital subtraction angiography. We determined the proportion of underlying vascular abnormalities and correlated these findings with risk factors for BGH. A total of 113 consecutive patients with BGH were identified, and vascular imaging was performed in 61. The median age was 62 years and 48 (78.7%) of these patients were male. Forty-two (68.9%) of 61 patients had hypertension. Positive vascular imaging findings were identified in eight of 61 patients (13.1%): three intracranial aneurysms, three cavernous malformations, one Moyamoya disease and one arteriovenous malformation. There were no significant associations between demographic features, vascular risk factors and the hematoma volume between patients with positive and negative vascular imaging. Specifically, an underlying vascular abnormality was not associated with age (≥ 60 years, 6/36 patients had an underlying vascular abnormality, compared with 2/25 patients< 60 years; p=not significant [n.s.]). There was no relationship with hypertension (5/42 hypertensive patients and 3/19 normotensive patients (n.s.) had an underlying vascular abnormality). We concluded that there is a significant proportion of relevant underlying vascular abnormalities in patients with BGH. This likelihood is not predicted by risk factors such as hypertension and age. These findings indicate the importance of vascular imaging in patients with BGH who are not neurologically devastated."

The patient displayed the characteristic clinical features of Werner's syndrome, including premature senility, juvenile cataract, atrophic skin, and a tendency to ward familial occurrence was present. MRI and cerebral angiography revealed multiple intracerebral hemorrhages, perhaps due to amyloid angiopathy, multiple lacunar infarctions and parasagittal meningioma.

Features that identified aneurysms using this technique included the appearance of abnormal color where no normal artery was expected, abnormal bulging of an artery, and greater ""expansibility"" of the aneurysm in comparison to an adjacent normal vessel. In this exploratory study, 30 of 33 aneurysms were correctly identified in 35 patients with a good bone window. Color Doppler energy is considerably more sensitive to intracranial blood flow than conventional color Doppler imaging. Color Doppler energy is a useful research tool; if these preliminary results are verified in larger series, in addition to examination for vasospasm, the technique could be used for identification and follow up of aneurysms."

The subdural hematoma was removed and the aneurysmal neck was clipped, but she died 15 days after the operation. Autopsy found the giant aneurysm (33 x 30 x 27 mm) on the distal segment of the right pericallosal artery. Highly atheromatous changes were recognized in part of the aneurysmal wall, the arteries near the circle of Willis, and the distal anterior cerebral artery (ACA) adjacent to the aneurysm. There were no anomalous vessels such as azygos ACA. Giant aneurysms situated beyond the genu of the corpus callosum are extremely rare.

Noncontrast CT of the brain is the imaging test of choice for the initial evaluation of a patient with suspected acute ischemic stroke. It is rapid and readily available and has a high sensitivity for intracranial hemorrhage. Contrast-enhanced CT angiography and perfusion imaging may provide additional information with only a minimal increase in scanning time.

CD009372,0,12621685,0,[Diagnosis of stroke--an update].,"In practical day-to-day terms, most patients have one of the common causes of stroke: ischemic stroke caused by the complications of atherothrombosis, intracranial small Vessel disease, embolism from the heart, primary intracerebral hemorrhage caused by hypertension, or subarachnoid hemorrhage as a result of a ruptured saccular aneurysm. There are three issues to be considered in assessing the reliability of the clinical diagnosis of stroke: the diagnosis of stroke itself: is it a stroke or not; whether the stroke is caused by an infarct or a hemorrhage and particular in ischemic stroke the site and size of the lesion (anterior vs. posterior circulation, lacunar vs. cortical, etc.) No clinical scoring method can differentiate with absolute reliability ischemic stroke from primary intracerebral hemorrhage. To do this brain computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging is required. For vascular diagnosis ultrasound and magnetic resonance angiography are ideal and complementary non-invasive techniques. Both have no risks and are reasonably sensitive. Catheterangiography is only reserved for patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage with a view to surgical or endovascular treatment or in exceptional cases to establish a more firm prognosis. The diagnosis of ischemic stroke caused by embolism from the heart can only be considered at all if there is an identifiable cardioembolic source which is the case in about 30% of ischemic stroke, a higher proportion in recent studies using transoesophageal echocardiography. It is not clear that transoesophageal echocardiography provides much more information for clinical decision-making than transthoracic echocardiography, although it certainly provides more anatomical information in selected patients. This article summarises the diagnostic armamentarium which is used for the diagnosis of stroke and gives an overview of clinically reliable and relevant measures."

Emergent magnetic resonance image was useful not only for diagnosis by fluid attenuated inversion recovery image but also for evaluation of cerebral ischemia and vasospasm by magnetic resonance angiography, diffusion weighted image and perfusion weighted image. A 50-year-old man presented disturbance of consciousness and dysarthria. Neither computed tomographic scan nor cerebrospinal fluid study could diagnose subarachnoid hemorrhage clearly. However, emergent fluid attenuated inversion recovery image showed the show subarachnoid hemorrhage as high signal intensity. Diffusion weighted image showed multiple, round hypersignals both in the white and gray matter. In the area with diffusion hypersignal, the apparent diffusion coefficient value was 0.57 x 10(3) mm2/sec. Perfusion weighted image showed normal cerebral blood volume but prolonged mean transit time in the territory of the right middle cerebral artery. Magnetic resonance angiography revealed an aneurysm at the anterior communicating artery and severe vasospasm on the bilateral anterior cerebral artery, the right middle cerebral artery. Thus we are able to diagnose subarachnoid hemorrhage due to a ruptured anterior communicating artery aneurysm. The hyperintensity of the diffusion weighted image and the fluid attenuated inversion recovery image was caused by cerebral ischemia from vasospasm. After conservative therapy during the period of vasospasm, successful surgical clipping was performed with full clinical recovery."

Each patient fulfilled four criteria: 1. the patient was neurologically symptomatic; 2. the angiographic diagnosis was a venous malformation; 3. at operation, shunting arterioles (50-100 microns) were found to contribute to the malformation; and 4. histologically, a mixture of venous channels and arterioles with arterioles directly connected to venules was found. Based on the above findings, the malformation present in the 13 patients can be termed a 'pericapillary arteriovenous malformation'. Its angiographic distinction from the cerebral venous malformation requires technological advancement in the capability of magnifying images of arterioles and venules, along with improvement in image resolution."

CD009372,0,11677889,0,Continuous arterial spin labeling perfusion magnetic resonance imaging findings in postpartum vasculopathy.,"Postpartum vasculopathy (PPV) is a rare heterogeneous nonatherosclerotic vasculopathy that occurs in the puerperium. It occurs spontaneously but may be triggered by vasoconstrictor substances. The angiographic findings vary and include narrowing of the intracranial arteries and vasospasm. The angiographic findings and the occurrence of ischemic infarcts suggest that cerebral blood flow (CBF) is impaired in PPV. The purpose of this study is to determine CBF in patients with PPV. The authors conducted a case study of 3 patients with clinical and laboratory criteria for PPV examined during a 2-year period. Clinical examination, computed tomography imaging, structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), cerebral angiography, and continuous arterial spin labeling perfusion (CASL-PI) MRI were performed in all patients. Mean global CBF was determined, and perfusion maps were visually inspected. The CBF values and perfusion maps were correlated with the clinical symptoms and the neuroimaging findings. Three women were studied (22, 34, and 36 years old). The median time of presentation was 4 days postpartum. One presented with intracranial hemorrhage and diffuse arterial narrowing, the other 2 with stroke-like lesions, encephalopathy, and segmental narrowing mainly in the posterior circulation. CASL-PI was performed within 1 week of symptom onset in all 3 patients. Global mean CBF values were 51.8, 39.3, and 41.8 cc/100 g/min. Although global CBF was mildly diminished, it was above ischemic levels. Visual inspection of the CASL-PI perfusion maps did not reveal areas of focal hypoperfusion or hyperperfusion. In this series of patients with PPV, CBF was close to normal. Although angiography often reveals diffuse arterial narrowing, the CBF values encountered in this study do not support a state of generalized or focal oligoemia. Vasomotor tone may change intermittently in patients with PPV."

Despite many improvements in MR technology, CT is still the method of choice for most of these patients. Contrary to a long existing opinion, CT is a good diagnostic instrument even in the early phase of acute ischemic stroke. In combination with the new helical CT technique [CT angiography] all important questions regarding early therapeutic decisions can be answered. New MR perfusion techniques are just on the way to clinical application. Invasive angiography is only rarely indicated in acute ischemic stroke. The diagnosis of intracerebral hemorrhage is also mainly CT-based. MR and DSA are mandatory for further evaluation of the etiology of the hemorrhage. Nowadays, DSA is not longer mandatory for the diagnosis of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. In some patients CT is already diagnostic; the combination of different MR and MRA techniques nearly always allows a definite diagnosis or exclusion of a venous thrombosis."

CD009372,0,6362094,0,The pathogenesis of strokes from internal carotid artery occlusion. Diagnostic and therapeutical implications.,"In order to relate clinical, angiologic and brain-morphological findings, 107 patients with internal carotid artery occlusion were examined clinically and by Doppler sonography, computerized tomography and cerebral angiography. During computerized tomography, haemodynamically induced infarctions could be differentiated from those, caused by periocclusive embolism towards the major brain arteries. This differentiation was based on an integration of angiological as well as brain-morphological data and implicates some important diagnostic, therapeutic and prognostic consequences. The first group may benefit from immediate surgical restoration of carotid blood flow and have a relatively good prognosis. By contrast, subjects presenting territorial infarctions mostly experience severe and permanent neurological deficits. They should not undergo revascularization since endarterectomy increases the risk of cerebral hemorrhage but cannot cause clinical improvement. In five patients, following special angiographic techniques, the lesions of the internal carotid artery turned out to be pseudoocclusions. This condition threatens the patient considerably but is well accessible to surgical reconstruction. Thus, pseudooclusion seems to be one of the most convincing indication for emergency endarterectomy of the internal carotid artery."

Computed tomography on admission revealed thin SAH in the left parietooccipital sulcus. Cerebral angiography demonstrated a small saccular aneurysm on the cortical branch of the left PCA. The aneurysm was successfully clipped via the occipital interhemispheric approach. Distal PCA aneurysms frequently affect middle-aged persons and tend to be small, with good clinical course but may cause visual field defects. Direct aneurysm clipping is recommended for patients without visual defect from the onset. Parent artery occlusion by the endovascular technique should be considered for patients with visual loss caused by the initial hemorrhage."

Sixty-five of those aneurysms were carotid ophthalmic, 12 were located in the internal carotid-posterior communicating-anterior choroidal artery regions and 16 involved the internal carotid artery bifurcation. For the majority, clinical presentation was related to the mass of the aneurysms and compression of surrounding structures such as visual pathways, ocular motor cranial nerves, the fifth nerve, and hypothalamic-pituitary axis. Fourteen patients presented with subarachnoid hemorrhage.

Intracranial hemorrhage associated with CdAVS is rare. We describe a patient with CdAVS presenting with subarachnoid hemorrhage and acute subdural hematoma. A 65-year-old woman presented headache and temporary loss of consciousness and was transferred to our hospital. On admission, the patient was alert and complained of a left-sided temporal headache. There were no ocular symptoms. A CT scan revealed subarachnoid hemorrhage and left acute subdural hematoma. When we prepared for cerebral angiography, the patient presented loss of consciousness following sudden onset of severe headache. Urgent angiography revealed left CdAVS, which was fed by both the internal carotid artery and the external carotid artery and drained only into ipsilateral (left) vein of the sylvian fissure. Aneurysmal dilatation of the draining veins and leptomeningeal drainage were present. No cerebral aneurysms were detected. After the angiography, a CT scan showed enlarged subdural hematoma, so left fronto-temporo-parietal craniotomy was immediately performed. On opening the dura mater, arterial bleeding from Sylvian fissure appeared and was uncontrollable. Unfortunately, the patient died 3 days after the operation. We concluded that subarachnoid hemorrhage and subdural hematoma were due to the rupture of engorged cortical veins. Our case report suggests that CdAVS with angiographic findings such as aneurysmal dilatation of the draining veins and leptomeningeal drainage should be treated urgently because of the high risk of the life-threatening complications resulting from a surgically uncontrollable hemorrhage."

Case report.,"A 69-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital because of fluctuating dysarthria during the past 2 months. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed old cerebral infarction of the left cerebral hemisphere with acute subarachnoid hemorrhage in the left sylvian fissure. Cerebral angiography showed a large saccular aneurysm, 14 mm in diameter, at the bifurcation of the left middle cerebral artery (MCA) in association with moyamoya vasculopathy with atherosclerosis, including steno-occlusive changes at the bilateral terminal internal carotid arteries and abnormal net-like vessels at the base of the brain. She underwent microsurgical neck clipping of the large aneurysm followed by superficial temporal artery-MCA anastomosis without complication. Intraoperative findings showed no evidence of aneurysm rupture, suggesting that the subarachnoid hemorrhage was due to the intrinsic pathology of moyamoya vasculopathy. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient was discharged without neurological deficit. Association of moyamoya syndrome with large MCA aneurysm is extremely rare, and formation of large aneurysm at the vascular territory of an occluded vessel is apparently unique."

CD009372,0,10072055,0,Stroke-like episodes in autosomal recessive cytochrome oxidase deficiency.,"Stroke-like episodes, defined as periods of acute localized neurological dysfunction during which brain imagery suggests cerebral ischemia but vascular anatomy is normal, occurred in 3 patients with autosomal recessive Saguenay-Lac St-Jean (SLSJ) cytochrome oxidase (COX) deficiency. The patients developed focal neurological deterioration and frontal hypodensities on cerebral computerized tomography (CT). Arteriography, performed in 1 patient during an acute episode, showed normal vascular anatomy. Nevertheless, capillary shunting was evident both in regions that appeared abnormal on the initial cerebral CT study and in regions that appeared normal but subsequently developed Leigh disease. Stroke-like episodes did not exacerbate systemic acidosis, and acidotic decompensations occurred independently of stroke-like episodes. In conclusion, stroke-like episodes occur in autosomal recessively inherited congenital lactic acidoses as well as in those caused by mitochondrial DNA mutations. In some cases, acute localized neurovascular changes occur in regions that subsequently develop Leigh disease."

They are related to a degenerative disease of the small vessels that may be of ischemic (leukoaraiosis, lacunae and infarct) or hemorrhagic (microbleeds and hematomas) origin. These lesions are part of the aging process, and compounded by vascular risk factors. They increase the occurrence frequency and severity of ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke. Their importance is also associated with the presence of cognitive and/or affective symptoms, and their impact on the occurrence and evolution of dementia remains to be evaluated.

CD009372,0,9567070,0,[Intracranial aneurysms in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease detected by MR angiography: screening and treatment].,"The association of intracranial aneurysm with ADPKD is well-known, and patients with ADPKD are at increased risk of subarachnoid hemorrhage from rupture of intracranial aneurysms. We prospectively performed three-dimensional time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) in 30 nonselective adult patients with ADPKD. Sixteen were women and 14 were men with a mean age of 51 yr (range 24 to 79 yr). The diagnosis of ADPKD was made on the basis of abdominal ultrasound or computed tomographic studies. Three patients were on maintenance hemodialysis, 8 patients were nondialysed patients with chronic renal failure (serum creatinine > or = mg/dl) and 25 patients had hypertension (BP > or = 140/90 mmHg). None of these patients have a previous diagnosis of intracranial aneurysm. Unruptured intracranial aneurysms were suspected in 5 patients by MRA, and 8 aneurysms were confirmed in 4 (13.3%) of 30 patients by conventional arteriography. These aneurysms were 3 approximately 10 mm in diameter and 3 aneurysms (3 approximately 4 mm in diameter) were newly detected by cerebral arteriography. After informed consent was obtained, neck clipping of the intracranial aneurysms were performed successfully in all the patients. These results suggest that the prevalence of intracranial aneurysms is about 13% in ADPKD, and that MRA is useful in screening for occult intracranial aneurysms in patients with ADPKD."
CD009372,0,1616402,0,[CT vs MRI in the diagnosis of acute stroke].,"70 patients who had suffered an acute stroke (52 ischaemic and 18 haemorrhagic) were studied with CT and MR, performing both techniques during the first week of disease and correlating the findings with the clinical data. MR proved superior in the detection of ischaemic infarcts, specially those in the posterior territory and with a small size; it was also superior to CT in the detection of leukoaraiosis and the demonstration of vascular obstructions. CT failed to detect a small brain stem haemorrhage secondary to bleeding of a cavernoma, while its performance was similar to that of MR in the remaining cases. In all patients with intracerebral haemorrhages, including two who were examined on the first day, an area of increased density was evidenced in the T1 sequences. It is concluded that CT, due to its greater availability and easiness of performance, must be maintained as first choice in acute stroke in order to differentiate haemorrhage from ischaemia, while MR may provide additional information in selected cases."
CD009372,0,18155383,0,Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage: update for emergency physicians.,"Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a serious cause of stroke that affects 30,000 patients in North America annually. Due to a wide spectrum of presentations, misdiagnosis of SAH has been reported to occur in a significant proportion of cases. Headache, the most common chief complaint, may be an isolated finding; the neurological examination may be normal and neck stiffness absent. Emergency physicians must decide which patients to evaluate beyond history and physical examination. This evaluation--computed tomography (CT) scanning and lumbar puncture (LP)--is straightforward, but each test has important limitations. CT sensitivity falls with time from onset of symptoms and is lower in mildly affected patients. Traumatic LP must be distinguished from true SAH. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis centers on measuring xanthochromia. Debate exists about the best method to measure it--visual inspection or spectrophotometry. An LP-first strategy is also discussed. If SAH is diagnosed, the priority shifts to specialist consultation and cerebrovascular imaging to define the offending vascular lesion. The sensitivity of CT and magnetic resonance angiography are approaching that of conventional catheter angiography. Emergency physicians must also address various management issues to treat or prevent early complications. Endovascular therapy is being increasingly used, and disposition to neurovascular centers that offer the full range of treatments leads to better patient outcomes. Emergency physicians must be expert in the diagnosis and initial stabilization of patients with SAH. Treatment in a hospital with both neurosurgical and endovascular capability is becoming the norm."

CD009372,0,1407338,0,[Clinical application of phase contrast angiography].,"""Phase Contrast Angiography"" is a new technique of Magnetic Resonance Angiography as reported by Dumoulin CL et al. Using this technique, we can obtain images of vessels (angiograms) without injection of contrast medium. We present the results of phase contrast angiography on cerebral and spinal vascular disease. We utilized the General Electric SIGNA, 1.5 tesla NMR. One hundred and ninety-one cases of cerebral and spinal vascular diseases were scanned using phase contrast angiography. Included were 90 cases of occlusive vascular disease, 16 cases of moyamoya disease, 39 cases of arteriovenous malformation, and 28 aneurysms. The phase contrast angiography uses flow encoding gradient pulses, which impart a velocity-dependent phase shift to the transverse magnetization of moving spins. The resulting image contains only information from the moving spins; while information from stationary tissue remains suppressed. In cases using 3-D angiogram, we made 32 images 6 degrees apart in their projection direction and displayed them on a video terminal. We were able to visualize occlusions of vessels, aneurysms, bypassed vessels, and abnormal vessels of arteriovenous malformations. Retrospective evaluation comparing phase contrast angiography with conventional angiography of the stenotic findings on the horizontal portion of middle cerebral arteries (64 vessels of 32 patients), resulted in a false positive ratio of 39.1%. We obtained clinically valuable results regarding the hydrodynamics of patients using ""phase contrast angiography"" non-invasively. These results reveal not only ""anatomical"" images of vessels, but also ""functional"" images, which are sensitive to the pattern of the blood flow. This study would strongly suggest that phase contrast angiography presents a valuable tool for the clinical diagnosis of cerebral and spinal vascular diseases."

The rCBF patterns were correlated with clinical presentation, electroencephalographic patterns, radiologic studies, including computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging of the head, and cerebral angiography. All patients presented with motor weakness that was accompanied in some with dysphasia, defects in visual fields, obtundation, seizures, and high temperature. Perturbations of rCBF with Tc 99m-HMPAO SPECT brain scanning were detected in all patients investigated, with no adverse effects related to the radiotracer. All patients had a focal area of decreased rCBF, with adjacent hyperemia in 3 patients. In 7 patients, there was an rCBF decrease in a vascular distribution, mainly that of the middle cerebral artery, that correlated with the clinical findings and a focal electroencephalogram, as well as computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging of the head. Impairment of rCBF was more extensive in 3 children, while early abnormal SPECT findings preceded abnormal computed tomographic findings in another 2 children. In 2 patients, Tc 99m-HMPAO SPECT was the only positive radiologic test to correlate with focal clinical and electroencephalographic abnormalities, in view of repeated normal computed tomographic scans. We conclude that Tc 99m-HMPAO SPECT brain scanning is a sensitive, complementary diagnostic measure in the early detection, localization, and estimation of rCBF alterations in pediatric cerebrovascular disease."

Seven weeks after the onset of HZO, she complained of headache, mild right hemiparesis, and disturbance of consciousness. Computed tomography revealed subcortical hemorrhage at the left temporo-occipital lobe. Cerebral angiography showed vascular irregularities such as segmental narrowing and sausage-like dilation on proximal portion of the ipsilateral anterior, middle and posterior cerebral arteries. Same findings were seen on peripheral portions of the posterior cerebral artery on the same side. Moreover sequential angiograms showed appearance of an aneurysm in the left middle cerebral artery (M2 potion). Under the diagnosis of cerebral angiitis associated with HZO, she was treated with antiviral agents, antiplatelet drugs, steroid and stellate ganglion block. Those irregularities were found to diminish on the sequential angiograms, and the aneurysm disappeared four month later."
CD009372,0,16699848,0,MR angiography of the carotid arteries and intracranial circulation: advantage of a high relaxivity contrast agent.,"Several studies have shown the usefulness of contrast-enhanced MR angiography (CE-MRA) for imaging the supraortic vessels, and, as a consequence, it has rapidly become a routine imaging modality. The main advantage over unenhanced techniques is the possibility to acquire larger volumes, allowing demonstration of the carotid artery from its origin to the intracranial portion. Most published studies on CE-MRA of the carotid arteries have been performed with standard Gd-based chelates whose T1 relaxivity values are similar. Recently new gadolinium chelates such as gadobenate dimeglumine (Gd-BOP-TA, MultiHance; Bracco Imaging, Milan, Italy) have been developed which have markedly higher intravascular T1 relaxivity values. When administered at an equivalent dose to that of a standard agent, these newer contrast agents produce significantly greater intravascular signal enhancement. The availability of an appropriate high-relaxivity contrast agent might also help to overcome some of the intrinsic technical problems (e. g. those related to flow) that affect time-of-flight (TOF) and phase contrast (PC) MR angiography of the intracranial vasculature. To avoid the problem of superimposition of veins, ultrafast gradient echo MRA techniques with very short TR and TE have been developed. Although the precise sequence parameters vary between manufacturers, they are basically similar. The choice between performing a time-resolved or high spatial resolution CE-MRA examination depends upon the precise clinical application. The most common applications include the study of cerebral aneurysms, arteriovenous malformations, dural arteriovenous fistulas and dural venous diseases."

The cerebral artery diameter is regulated by complex physiological mechanisms. Among them the regulation of intracellular calcium homeostasis seems to play a crucial role. Recent data suggest that ryanodine receptors (RYRs) are involved in regulating the luminal calcium concentration in vascular smooth muscle cells. In this gene association investigation, we studied the question as to whether variants in the gene for the ryanodine receptors subtype 1 (RYR1) are associated with symptomatic cerebral vasospasm following SAH."

A uniform technique for measuring carotid stenosis from an arteriogram (% stenosis = [1 - minimum residual lumen/normal distal cervical internal carotid artery diameter] x 100) was used in both trials, with reproducibility internally validated. The reliability of this measurement when used outside the trials for defining carotid stenosis has not been validated.

This is a prospective study of the reliability of carotid stenosis measurements performed by practicing physicians of different specialties and different levels of clinical experience."

Cerebral angiography 2 hours after the onset of the symptom showed pearl-and-string sign in the right vertebral artery. Serial angiography showed that the affected artery was occluded at 12 hours but was recanalized on the 4th day. The dissecting aneurysm was resected with side-to-side anastomosis between the bilateral posterior inferior cerebellar arteries. Postoperative cerebral angiography demonstrated disappearance of the lesion and patency of the right posterior inferior cerebellar artery via the anastomosis. Histological examination of the lesion showed hematoma between the media and adventitia, disrupting the internal elastica and intima. Acute occlusion and early recanalization of the affected artery may occur in ruptured vertebral artery dissecting aneurysms.

However, the clinical efficacy of mass screening of UIA using MRA has not been established. This study aims to establish the clinical efficacy of mass screening of UIA using MRA by decision-making. The decision tree is constructed simulating a flow of population (100,000 persons, aged 50-59) starting from the MRA screening until the final outcomes of quality adjusted life or death in ten years. In order to estimate the numerical values various parameters were used as follows, prevalence rate: 1%; sensitivity of MRA: 74%; specificity of MRA: 76%; death rate by intracranial angiography: 0.1%; rupture rate of UIA: 2%/year; death rate of SAH: 57%; and death rate for surgery for UIA: 0.0%. The following results were obtained: 1. The number of lives saved by the MRA screening was 760, while the number saved without MRA was 79. 2. The number of deaths in those receiving the MRA screening was 52, while the number of deaths without MRA was 104. 3. The level of quality adjusted life with the MRA screening was higher than that without MRA in all cases. In conclusion, mass screening of UIA using MRA appears to be effective."

Standard methods of investigation appropriate to the period were used, i.e. cerebral angiography, CT and MR scanning. Recently, some patients had specific venous studies including intraluminal cranial venous sinus pressure measurements. A sub-group (25 patients) was investigated for haematological abnormalities. The overall incidence of cranial venous outflow abnormality was 19.7% (37 cases). In decades, related to the predominant investigative method, the figures were: to 1979, 4.2% (2 cases); to 1989, 15.0% (8 cases); to 1999, 31.0% (27 cases). A cause of the venous abnormality was identified in 20 cases, most commonly haematological and iatrogenic. In 17 patients (all females) no cause was identified. Fifteen of the 25 patients (60%) tested specifically were found to have a haematological abnormality, although no correlation was shown between this and a demonstrable venous outflow abnormality. The conclusion was drawn that there is a high incidence (close to one-third) of venous outflow abnormalities in PTS with detailed investigation. Issues of mechanism and therapy are discussed."

CD009372,0,2980426,0,Focal recurrent hemorrhage on magnetic resonance at 0.5 tesla. An aid to the diagnosis of cryptic cerebral vascular malformations.,"The MR appearance of focal recurrent hemorrhage is characteristic and highly suggestive of an underlying cryptic vascular malformation. We reviewed the MR findings in 14 cases (3 biopsy proven), 9 in the brainstem and 5 supratentorial. CT in all cases demonstrated the lesion to be hyperdense before contrast with minimal to moderate enhancement post contrast. The angiograms were negative in all 14 cases demonstrating mass effect in some but no blush or neovascularity. MR showed focal hyperintensities on both short (T1) and long (T2) TR sequences surrounded by a well-circumscribed hypointense rim particularly on the long TR sequence. Focal central hyperintensity is felt to be secondary to the presence of methemoglobin and indicates relatively recent hemorrhage. In our experience hyperintensity in a solitary hemorrhage usually resolves in 4-6 weeks. In 8 cases serial MR studies over 2-3 years demonstrated evidence of repeated hemorrhage as manifested by increases in size and persistent or new hyperintensity. The intense rim due to a short T2 did not correlate with vessels angiographically nor with calcification on the pre-contrast CT and, therefore, does not represent the vascular malformation itself but rather some portion of the hematoma, possibly the hemosiderin laden capsule. Using CT and angiography alone it is difficult to differentiate cryptic arteriovenous malformations from a neoplasm particularly in the brainstem. MR's specific configuration of focal recurrent hemorrhage can make a more definitive diagnosis at 0.5 T as well as at 1.5 T."

Endovascular procedure may be a therapeutic option when evolution is unfavourable despite medical treatment, but the use of stenting is rarely reported in CVT treatment. We report the case of a man who presented a jugular vein thrombosis responsible for severe intracranial hypertension. Because of clinical worsening despite intravenous heparin and symptomatic treatment, endovascular procedure including the placement of five venous stents, thrombolysis and balloon angioplasty, was performed and led to venous recanalization with successful clinical outcome.

A 43-year-old male suffered sudden headache and vomiting. Neurological examination revealed mild consciousness disturbance and dysarthria. The computed tomography (CT) scans showed intraventricular hemorrhage, which was drained through burr holes bifrontally. The diagnosis of Moyamoya disease was subsequently made by cerebral angiography. A month later he was discharged with mild gait disturbance and mental retardation. Seven years later he suddenly complained of gait disturbance, dysarthria and sensory disturbance involving the right upper extremity. A CT scan revealed a small hemorrhage in the left putamen. Carotid angiograms disclosed transcranial EC-IC anastomosis through the burr holes which had been made previously.

CD009372,0,20227278,1,Comparisons of DSA and MR angiography with digital subtraction angiography in 151 patients with subacute spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage.,"To exclude underlying vascular abnormalities in patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage, the traditional paradigm requires investigation using digital subtraction angiography (DSA) in both the acute and subacute phases. We investigated whether MRI and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), in the subacute stage of intracerebral hematoma, had high positive predictive values (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV) in screening for vascular abnormality in the routine clinical setting. In a regional neurosurgical center in Hong Kong, we retrospectively reviewed 151 patients investigated with both MRI and DSA for underlying structural vascular abnormalities during the subacute phase. Sensitivity, specificity, and intermodality agreement were assessed. A total of 70/151 (46%) vascular lesions accountable for the hemorrhage were found. Patients with vascular abnormalities tended to be younger (mean age+/-standard deviation [SD], 33+/-15years), less likely to be hypertensive (6.3%), and the lesion was more likely to be accompanied by intraventricular hemorrhage (22%). In terms of cerebral arteriovenous malformation and dural arteriovenous fistulas, MRI/MRA had a PPV of 0.98 and a NPV of 1.00. We concluded that MRI/MRA was able to detect most structural vascular abnormalities in the subacute phase in most patients and, thus, its use is recommended as the screening test."

Stroke diagnosis: factors influencing the diagnostic evaluation of patients following acute stroke.","Among the 4129 patients of the Community Hospital-based Stroke Program, 30% had an unspecified stroke diagnosis. Since specific diagnosis and, perhaps, eventual treatment, derives in part from diagnostic testing, we examined the effect of clinical condition, geographic and demographic factors on the incidence of certain diagnostic tests after acute stroke. In this multivariable analysis, race, sex, history of hypertension and history of diabetes did not influence the chance of having any test, but older age strongly reduced the chances of receiving extensive evaluation. When CT scanning was available, the utilization of a CT as well as other diagnostic studies including cerebral angiography, radionuclide brain scan, EEG and EKG was increased. The odds of receiving a CT scan increased if the patient was married, and decreased with a history of previous stroke. A history of previous TIA increased the chance of having a cerebral angiogram while a history of cardiac disease decreased the chance. There were striking regional geographic differences in the use of CT, radionuclide brain scanning and cerebral angiography which may, in part, reflect differences between the availability of these technologies in urban and rural hospitals. These results indicate that evaluation of stroke patients remains heterogenous."

The 10 cases, in which CT was performed within 7 days after the onset of a ruptured AVM, presented with blood stained CSF except for two cases. All of the 10 cases showed intracerebral haemorrhages in the CT findings, and four of these cases were associated with ventricular rupture. In the plain CT of these 10 cases, high density in the cerebral cistern, such as seen in the acute stage of ruptured intracranial aneurysms, was not found except for 1 case. In the enhanced CT within 7 days after the onset of ruptured AVM, no enhanced findings were found in eight cases. On the contrary, in 12 cases in which CT was performed later than the 8th day after the onset, enhanced findings were found in 11 cases. It has been previously reported that SAH is seen in the lesion of ruptured AVM in the acute stage. From our CT findings of ruptured AVM in the acute stage, however, it was concluded that the lesion of a ruptured AVM in the acute stage does not cause SAH but an intracerebral haematoma or ventricular rupture and that blood may enter the CSF only secondarily."

CD009372,0,17555581,0,Fibromuscular dysplasia.,"Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD), formerly called fibromuscular fibroplasia, is a group of nonatherosclerotic, noninflammatory arterial diseases that most commonly involve the renal and carotid arteries. The prevalence of symptomatic renal artery FMD is about 4/1000 and the prevalence of cervicocranial FMD is probably half that. Histological classification discriminates three main subtypes, intimal, medial and perimedial, which may be associated in a single patient. Angiographic classification includes the multifocal type, with multiple stenoses and the 'string-of-beads' appearance that is related to medial FMD, and tubular and focal types, which are not clearly related to specific histological lesions. Renovascular hypertension is the most common manifestation of renal artery FMD. Multifocal stenoses with the 'string-of-beads' appearance are observed at angiography in more than 80% of cases, mostly in women aged between 30 and 50 years; they generally involve the middle and distal two-thirds of the main renal artery and in some case also renal artery branches. Cervicocranial FMD can be complicated by dissection with headache, Horner's syndrome or stroke, or can be associated with intracerebral aneurysms with a risk of subarachnoid or intracerebral hemorrhage. The etiology of FMD is unknown, although various hormonal and mechanical factors have been suggested. Subclinical lesions are found at arterial sites distant from the stenotic arteries, and this suggests that FMD is a systemic arterial disease. It appears to be familial in 10% of cases. Noninvasive diagnostic tests include, in increasing order of accuracy, ultrasonography, magnetic resonance angiography and computed tomography angiography. The gold standard for diagnosing FMD is catheter angiography, but this invasive procedure is only used for patients in whom it is clinically pertinent to proceed with revascularization during the same procedure. Differential diagnosis include atherosclerotic stenoses and stenoses associated with vascular Ehlers-Danlos and Williams' syndromes, and type 1 neurofibromatosis. Management of cases with renovascular hypertension includes antihypertensive therapy, percutaneous angioplasty of severe stenoses, and reconstructive surgery in cases with complex FMD that extends to segmental arteries. The therapeutic options for securing ruptured intracerebral aneurysms are microvascular neurosurgical clipping and endovascular coiling. Stenosis progression in renal artery FMD is slow and rarely leads to ischemic renal failure."

CD009372,0,23466430,0,Hematoma expansion following acute intracerebral hemorrhage.,"Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), the most devastating form of stroke, has no specific therapy proven to improve outcome by randomized controlled trial. Location and baseline hematoma volume are strong predictors of mortality, but are nonmodifiable by the time of diagnosis. Expansion of the initial hematoma is a further marker of poor prognosis that may be at least partly preventable. Several risk factors for hematoma expansion have been identified, including baseline ICH volume, early presentation after symptom onset, anticoagulation, and the CT angiography spot sign. Although the biological mechanisms of hematoma expansion remain unclear, accumulating evidence supports a model of ongoing secondary bleeding from ruptured adjacent vessels surrounding the initial bleeding site. Several large clinical trials testing therapies aimed at preventing hematoma expansion are in progress, including aggressive blood pressure reduction, treatment with recombinant factor VIIa guided by CT angiography findings, and surgical intervention for superficial hematomas without intraventricular extension. Hematoma expansion is so far the only marker of outcome that is amenable to treatment and thus a potentially important therapeutic target."

Causal treatment is possible only during the first few hours following the stroke, in the form of systemic fibrinolysis. An exact diagnosis of the causative pathology must be made before starting the therapy, and this must happen in the shortest possible period of time. Using imaging techniques, the whole spectrum of differential diagnoses of cerebral ischemia must be covered, including above all intracerebral and subarachnoid hemorrhage. Although computed tomography (CT) is excellently suited for determining hemorrhage, infarct can be recognized with much better contrast using diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) imaging (DWI). Stroke MR imaging additionally allows the representation of vital ""tissue at risk"" of infarction using perfusion images as well as the recognition of vessel occlusion using MR angiography. This paper is intended to define the usefulness of DWI in comparison to CT techniques and to elucidate the use of diffusion coefficients for differentiating the various stages of infarction.

The image quality was evaluated for each artery and ostium on MIP reconstructions. A comparison with conventional angiography was achieved in 27 patients. All MR examinations were assessable; a second injection was performed in ten patients. All carotid bifurcations were visualized. The ostium of the common carotid artery was not assessable in 44% of cases due to the limited coverage. The evaluation of the posterior circulation was good in 90% of cases. The agreement between MR angiography and conventional angiography was good despite a tendency to overestimate moderate stenoses. Stenoses greater than 70%, carotid occlusions and vertebral stenoses greater than 50% were correctly detected."

A 43-year-old jogger hit his forehead in the traffic accident. After medical care for the wound at the near hospital, he walked to home without any neurological deficits. On the following day, he complained of headache, nausea and slight gait disturbance, so the visited us 5 days after head trauma. On the biplane computed tomograms, interhemispheric subdural hematoma was detected. A distinct avascular space in this portion was found on the right carotid angiograms. Treated conservatively with repeated computed tomography, he recovered completely well about a month after head trauma. Analyzing 7 cases, following comments were obtained; Age distribution was between 23 to 74 and all were male. The mechanism of the hematoma formation in such region remained still unclear, but seemed to be caused partially due to rotational cerebral injuries. Characteristic clinical symptom was hemiparesis, predominantly crural or crural monoparesis. This symptom was found in four of seven cases on the same side of the hematoma, that was supposed due to the compression of the contralateral blood flow the distal anterior cerebral artery. Neuroradiologically, on the angiograms, the internal branches of callosomarginal arteries turned away from the middle parallel to the pericallosal artery stayed in the middle and between them, a distinct avascular space was found. On the biplane computed tomograms, semilunar high density area was identified along the midline, bounded medially by the falx cerebri, laterally by the convex border against the brain parenchyma, inferiorly by the tentorium. Although the anteroposterior extension of the hematoma was recognized on the axial plane, the superoinferior extension, especially in relation to the tentorium, was well shown on the coronal plane. On the electroencephalogram, no characteristic findings were obtained. Abnormalities blood coagulation were found in a case. Five cases were operated on and 2 cases treated conservatively, and the outcome was good in all. The following diseases had to be differentiated: hematomas due to the rupture of peripheral anterior cerebral artery aneurysms, including traumatic ones, blood coagulopathy or medication of anticoagulants. Tumors such as parasagittal or falx meningiomas, subdural abscesses localized in the interhemisphere, infarctions of distal anterior cerebral artery."
CD009372,0,1878867,0,Cerebral cavernous malformations (cavernomas) in the pediatric age-group.,"Cavernomas are vascular malformations composed of a compact mass of sinusoidal-type vessels that are immediately contiguous with one another and have no intervening parenchyma. Cavernous malformations were previously held to be a rare pathology occurring predominantly in adults. New neuroradiological techniques such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrate, on the contrary, that these lesions are also more frequent during childhood than was previously thought. In our institution we observed 17 cases of cavernous malformations in patients aged between 18 months and 16 years, 16 of whom were diagnosed after 1982. In 4 of these cases there was a documented familial history; in 2 multiple malformations were present. The most common site was the subcortical frontal region, but in 1 case the malformation was located in the pineal region. The most frequent (in 12 cases) initial symptom was hemorrhage, with the characteristics of an intracerebral hematoma. In 4 cases the initial symptom consisted of epileptic fits and 2 of these patients subsequently suffered hemorrhage. In one case the symptoms observed were those of an expansile process. All our patients underwent cerebral angiography and only in 1 case did this show a vascular abnormality. CT, performed in 16 patients, gave positive results in all cases. MRI, performed in 12 patients, gave highly significant images in all cases. Radical surgical removal of the malformation was performed in 15 of the 17 patients, and the results can be considered excellent in the majority of cases. Cavernous malformations are, therefore, more frequent lesions than had previously been thought, especially in pediatric patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

CD009372,0,10461508,0,Stroke: indications for emergent surgical intervention.,"As the brain attack message is disseminated throughout our medical community and the awareness of the public increases, neurosurgeons will have the opportunity to treat patients with stroke at a much earlier time in the evolution of the process than we have been accustomed. Are the relatively unimpressive results of acute surgical intervention in patients operated on later in the course of the disease applicable to those who seek medical attention early, within the first few hours of ictus? There is little firm data. However, there is an overwhelming amount of anecdotal and experimental evidence supporting the potential for ultra-early intervention, which frequently should be surgical. New surgical techniques may improve safety and feasibility of emergent operations. In the coming years, diagnostic techniques such as perfusion/diffusion magnetic resonance imaging will allow the clinician to determine who may benefit from intervention. These determinations will be made on physiological data, addressing the issues of tissue viability and degree of compromise of the blood-brain barrier. In the future, the window of opportunity for intervention will not be solely a function of time from ictus or a qualitative impression based on collateral circulation as extrapolated from angiography, transcranial Doppler, or magnetic resonance angiography. These new magnetic resonance imaging techniques, which are beginning to be tested clinically or are still in the developmental stages, will provide the functional data now provided by positron emission tomography and xenon computed tomography, but with improved sensitivity, specificity, and logistical ease. Neurosurgeons have been leaders in stroke care and have provided some of the most important experimental rationale for the brain attack concept. These contributions include demonstration of the ischemic penumbra, the importance of time and potential collateral circulation as factors determining viability of ischemic tissue, and the value of early revascularization and many neuroprotective maneuvers in preserving brain tissue after arterial occlusion. There is every reason to preserve and to enhance the role of the neurosurgeon as a ""stroke expert"" and as a leading member of the brain attack team. Early access to patients with stroke will offer us the opportunity to test clinically, in a rigorous fashion, the value of surgical revascularization procedures (open or endovascular) and medical maneuvers that we have developed clinically and tested in the laboratory. We have shown, as we did with the bypass study, that neurosurgeons know how to perform these trials and abide by their results, even when they are not to our liking."

Thorough workup of these patients revealed no underlying pathology (i.e., arteriovenous malformations) or other possible causes such as hemorrhage into a tumor. It is well known that heroin, ephedrine, and methamphetamine use may result in cerebral vasculitis, but only one case study in the literature has reported on cerebral vasculitis with ischemic stroke secondary to cocaine abuse.

CD009372,0,2654588,0,Doppler diagnosis in cases of acute stroke.,"Ultrasound techniques are employed increasingly for the evaluation of patients with cerebrovascular disease. We determined the accuracy of carotid Doppler ultrasonography, which incorporated spectral analysis and periorbital directional Doppler assessment, by comparison with conventional or digital-subtraction arteriography in 93 patients (186 vessels). We also reviewed our experience with the Doppler technique in consecutive patients who were admitted to hospital with established carotid-territory stroke. The Doppler technique had a sensitivity of 93% and a specificity of 97% as a screening test for the presence of carotid stenosis, and a high level of precision. The arteriography rate in patients with completed stroke was 40% before the introduction of Doppler ultrasonography but decreased to 24% after its introduction, and to 16% in the last 100 cases. The proportion of cases in whom an underlying cause for stroke could not be identified decreased from 31% of cases to 21% of cases. Extracranial carotid stenosis was implicated in only 22 of the last 100 patients with carotid-territory stroke. Doppler ultrasonography is a valuable diagnostic tool in patients with completed stroke. It aids in the selection of patients for arteriography and provides clues to the pathogenesis of stroke in patients in whom arteriography is inappropriate."

However, there are reports in the literature of proven traumatic intracranial hematoma of delayed onset after a negative computer tomographic or arteriographic study of the brain. We present a case of a 70-year-old patient admitted to the Clinic after a road accident. On admission the patient was disoriented in regard to time but his neurological status was otherwise normal. On the second day after admission the patient's condition deteriorated and he became comatose with moderate left hemiparesis.

Thirty-two normal subjects, and 11 patients with cerebrovascular diseases including vasospasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage, middle cerebral artery stenosis, and extracranial internal carotid artery stenosis were studied by transcranial Doppler. Increased peak velocity and spectral broadening of the reflected signal corresponded to clinical and angiographic evidence of middle cerebral artery vasospasm or stenosis. Decreased peak velocity and blunted waveforms occurred in the middle cerebral artery ipsilateral to severe extracranial internal carotid stenosis with poor crossfilling from the contralateral carotid artery. Abnormalities resolved following carotid endarterectomy. Transcranial Doppler identifies vasospasm or stenosis of the middle cerebral artery and may allow noninvasive evaluation of collateral flow across the anterior circle of Willis in patients with extracranial carotid artery stenosis."

We report such a case and review the literature. A 69-year-old female was admitted for a sudden onset of severe headache with nausea and vomiting. Soon after arrival, she became less responsive. CT of the head revealed an intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH) predominantly in the fourth and third ventricles without subarachnoid hemorrhage and associated with hydrocephalus. Cerebral angiography demonstrated an aneurysm at the choroidal branch of the PICA. The aneurysm was resected through a bilateral suboccipital craniotomy. The patient made a remarkable recovery. The literature describes five other cases of aneurysms arising from a choroidal branch of the PICA. Hypertension was a common finding in this population. In summary, aneurysms arising from a choroidal branch of the PICA are rare. Hypertensive vessel damage might be a major factor in their pathogenesis.

Group 1 patients were thought to have a high probability of an underlying structural lesion and underwent cerebral angiography acutely. If normal, this was repeated at three months. Group 2 patients were thought not to have such a lesion and underwent angiography at three months. Patients older than the mean age of the study population, and hypertensive patients were much less likely to harbour an aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation than younger or normotensive patients (p < 0.01; sensitivity 87.9%, specificity 88.6%). An aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation was the cause of haemorrhage in 12.8% of hypertensive patients, in 30.9% of patients with haematoma involving the basal ganglia, and 18.2% of those with posterior fossa haemorrhage. Features of CT in isolation give a sensitivity of 77.2% and a specificity of 84.2%. Follow up angiography in group 1 showed an arteriovenous malformation in one of seven patients in whom the original study was normal. These results contrast sharply with data from previous retrospective studies.

We report two cases of intracerebral hemorrhage with biopsy-proven cerebral vasculitis associated with the use of cocaine. The first case involved a 32-year-old man who presented with headache, left-sided hemiparesis, and severe hypertension and who was found to have a large right putaminal hemorrhage on cranial tomographic (CT) scan. Cerebral angiography did not show vasculitic changes, but brain tissue obtained during hematoma evacuation revealed a nonnecrotizing leukocytoclastic angiitis of the small vessels. The second case involved a 20-year-old man who presented with headache, agitation, and speech difficulty that progressed to disorientation and dysphasia. He had a large left temporoparietal hematoma seen on CT scan. Cerebral angiography was consistent with vasculitis, and brain tissue obtained during hematoma evacuation revealed a small vessel vasculitis. In both cases, thorough clinical and laboratory investigations found no evidence of systemic vasculitis or an etiologic agent other than cocaine. We also critically reviewed the previously reported cases of cocaine-associated cerebral vasculitis and the relevant medical literature to discuss the ""cocaine-associated vasculitis syndrome"" in the context of more established vasculitidies, including hypersensitivity vasculitis.

A 22-year-old female was comatose after an intravenous injection of an unknown dose of methamphetamine. Computed tomographic scans demonstrated massive subarachnoid hemorrhage and hematoma in the corpus callosum. Cerebral angiography revealed nonfilling of bilateral intracranial carotid arteries and extravasation of contrast medium from the right pericallosal artery which was visualized retrogradely via the vertebral artery. Postmortem studies found cerebral edema, subarachnoid, intraventricular, and intracerebral hemorrhage, and intracranial vasculitis, but no aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation. Necrosis of vessel walls with destruction of the smooth muscle layer, but no leukocytotic infiltration of the vessel walls were observed in all major cerebral arteries.

Tumour-associated bleeding is the cause of 6-10% of ICHs, mostly from metastases. We present the case of a 40-year-old female admitted originally for neck pain of sudden onset, accompanied by nausea and marked right arm paresis. A CT-scan revealed left fronto-central cortico-subcortical haemorrhage. Cerebral angiography was normal. Two months after the initial event the residual paresis worsened and the patient developed neuropsychological deficits. A CT-scan showed oedema around the original bleeding site, on MRI a solid lesion with a diameter of 5 cm could be seen, with some cystic alterations and contact to the meninges. The tumour was surgically removed, and removal at the time was considered complete. Histological analysis proved it to be an embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma. The patient's neurological deficits gradually improved. Almost three months after the operation she complained of intense left-sided headache. On CT a hyperdense left fronto-central lesion with positive enhancement could be seen; MRI confirmed a relapse tumour and showed bleeding in the rostral portion of the tumour as well as oedema. The patient started radiation therapy with a total dose of 60 Gy. Whole body image studies at the time failed to reveal any other neoplastic lesions. Two months later a CT-scan showed continued tumour growth. We present this case as a rare aetiology of intracerebral haemorrhage, more frequently associated with arterial hypertension or vascular pathology, as well as being an unusual manifestation of embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma, rarely found in the brain. The case also serves to illustrate the importance of a thorough diagnosis including MRI imaging in patients with so-called atypical ICH."

Systemic hypotension made by stepwise hemorrhage distended the perforators up to 158% of control values but constricted most of the large cerebral trunk vessels. In spontaneous hypertensive rats, systemic hypotension-induced distension disappeared in perforators, indicating that perforators with chronic hypertension lose their autoregulatory distensibility."

CD009372,0,22285527,0,A pediatric case of reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome with cortical subarachnoid hemorrhage.,"Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS) is a rare disorder characterized by acute onset, severe headache, with reversible vasoconstriction of cerebral arteries often accompanied by additional neurological symptoms. This syndrome is seen mainly in middle-aged adults, predominantly women. Herein, we report on a pediatric case of RCVS with cortical subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). A 12-year-old boy developed acute, severe headache with paralysis of lower extremities causing gait disturbance after administration of eletriptan. Brain magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) revealed multifocal narrowing of the cerebral arteries, whereas magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated sulcal hyperintensity on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, consistent with cortical SAH. The patient's clinical symptoms resolved spontaneously after a few days and the MRI and MRA findings disappeared 3 months later, suggesting a diagnosis of RCVS. Eletriptan might cause vasoconstriction of cerebral arteries. Although most patients with RCVS are adults and pediatric cases are rare, RCVS should be considered in a child complaining of severe headache."

The patient was alert and complained of precordial chest discomfort, dyspnea and shoulder stiffness. Echocardiography demonstrated normal left ventricle contraction with hypertrophy. Computed tomography (CT) and subsequent cerebral angiography revealed subarachnoid hemorrhage and saccular aneurysm at the anterior communicating artery. It is important to consider the possibility of subarachnoid hemorrhage when a patient shows pulmonary edema and ECG abnormalities even without typical clinical signs of subarachnoid hemorrhage."

CD009372,0,23406825,0,Idiopathic intraventricular aneurysm presenting with intraventricular hemorrhage: case report and review of the literature.,"Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) is a relatively commonly encountered problem in neurosurgical practice. The underlying causes could include hypertension, arteriovenous malformations (AVM), angiomas, trauma, tumors, aneurysms and moyamoya disease. Truly idiopathic intraventricular aneurysms (IVA) are rare. A high index of suspicion needs to be maintained since, with the appropriate treatment, the outcome is generally good. We report the case of a 14-year-old boy who presented with sudden onset headache and vomiting. CT angiogram pointed to the possibility of an IVA. This was confirmed by MRI with three-dimensional constructive interference in steady state (CISS-3D) sequences and digital subtraction angiography. The patient underwent microsurgical excision of the aneurysm and is doing well on follow-up. Idiopathic IVA can present with IVH at any age. MRI with CISS-3D and MR angiography would be the imaging modality of choice since it can also rule out other causes of intraventricular bleeding such as tumors and AVM. These lesions could be managed effectively by microsurgical excision/clipping. The necessity of investigating every patient who presents with IVH is debatable."

We conducted a retrospective analysis of the clinical and radiological outcomes of this treatment strategy and morphological factors associated with the success of endovascular coiling, to assess the safety and feasibility of our management strategy. From January 2003 to January 2012, we attempted endovascular coiling as the first-intention treatment for 30 consecutive patients with ruptured pericallosal artery aneurysms including those with intracerebral hematoma. Twenty-seven cases of ruptured pericallosal artery aneurysms were successfully embolized with coiling whereas three failures required surgery. Four patients experienced periprocedural complications including thromboembolic event in two and hematoma enlargement after coiling in two. A maximum aneurysm diameter of <3 mm was most strongly associated with failure of endovascular coiling. Of the 27 coil-treated aneurysms, immediate angiographic results showed complete aneurysm occlusion in 19 cases, neck remnant in 6, and residual aneurysm in 2. One patient had a major aneurysm recurrence that was uneventfully reembolized. Sixteen of our 30 patients had good outcomes (modified Rankin scale [mRS] 0-2), 7 had moderate disability (mRS 3), and 4 had severe disability (mRS 4-5) at 3 months after treatment. The management strategy for coiling as the first-intention treatment for ruptured pericallosal artery aneurysms has the potential to become an acceptable alternative to surgical clipping for selected cases, although a larger study population and longer follow-up periods are needed before definitive conclusions can be drawn."

MR-perfusion imaging primarily depicts the relative cerebral blood volume. The aim of this study was to test whether MR-perfusion imaging with a clinical MR scanner using a standard 2D-FLASH sequence provides clinically relevant information on patients with cerebrovascular diseases and brain tumors. Brain infarctions, lesions in cerebral microangiopathy and occlusions of the carotid artery with very poor collateralization showed definite differences in perfusion imaging compared with normal controls. However, our results show that acceleration of the imaging sequence and optimization of the contrast bolus and data processing are prerequisites for the clinical use of this method, which in principle may provide information on the absolute cerebral blood volume and even blood flow."
CD009372,0,8873103,0,The role of computed tomographic angiography in the assessment of intracranial vascular disease.,"Both technical and clinical implications of three-dimensional computed tomographic angiography in the evaluation of intracranial circulation, and in particular cerebral aneurysms, are presented. Three-dimensional computed tomographic angiography allows excellent visualization of the aneurysm, its neck, and its relationship with the parent artery and important adjacent bony structures. This technique has a major role in the evaluation of difficult aneurysms. In addition, advantages and disadvantages are discussed in comparison with more conventional techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging, magnetic resonance angiography, and digital subtraction angiography. Three-dimensional computed tomographic angiography will continue to develop with the advent of more rapid computed tomography scanners, playing a key role in the investigation and screening of patients with a family history of cerebral aneurysms."
CD009372,0,22904102,0,Severe venous congestive encephalopathy secondary to a dialysis arteriovenous graft.,"The clinical presentation and imaging of venous congestive encephalopathy (VCE) can mimic several neurological conditions, making the diagnosis challenging. We report a patient with end stage renal disease on dialysis who presented with a right occipital infarction. The patient developed progressive encephalopathy and increased intracranial pressure. Extensive imaging, electroencephalography and serum analysis did not explain the cause of his infarction and progressive neurological deterioration. Finally, cerebral angiography and venography demonstrated severe generalized VCE due to arterial shunting from a right upper extremity arteriovenous graft (AVG) and an occluded right innominate venous trunk. The right arm shunt resulted in severe cerebral venous hypertension due to ipsilateral occlusion of the innominate venous trunk. After the AVG was repaired, the cerebral venous hypertension resolved and the patient returned to baseline."

A brain CT scan showed intracerebral haemorrhage in the left frontoparietal area, but a cerebral angiogram and MRI revealed no vascular anomaly. The patient was managed conservatively and his headache and visual loss improved over time. Hypertension in the form of paroxysmal attacks led us to suspect phaeochromocytoma. Subsequently, the patient was diagnosed with an extra-adrenal phaeochromocytoma in the left para-aortic area following endocrinological evaluation, abdominal CT scan and (131)I-meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy. The patient presented here illustrates the importance of a careful search for a remediable cause of hypertension in children and young adults with spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage."
CD009372,0,19950046,0,[The dural arteriovenous fistula - an unimposing morphological correlate with imposing consequences].,"Dural arteriovenous fistulas (DAVFs) are abnormal arteriovenous shunts located within the dura mater representing approximately 10 - 15 % of all arteriovenous shunts in the central nervous system. The aetiology of spontaneous DAVFs remains to be elucidated. The symptoms associated with DAVFs can be highly variable and dependent upon the direction of the blood flow, the amount of arteriovenous shunting and the specific location of the fistula. Considering the diversity of clinical presentation in the setting of unremarkable imaging results, diagnosing a DAVF can be difficult. To avoid permanent neurological deficits due to DAVFs, it is important to consider the possibility of a DAVF whenever one encounters unclear neurological symptoms and to initiate appropriate diagnostic procedures including intraarterial DSA and MRI/MRA. The current DAVF classification accounts for the disparity of clinical symptoms, therapeutic/interventional implications as well as vital complications depending on each particular fistula subtype. While type I DAVFs drain anterogradely into a cerebral sinus and mainly cause functional deficits, the risk for severe intracerebral bleeding increases when DAVFs drain retrogradely (type II), or into cortical (types III and IV), perimedullar or radiculo-medullar veins (type V), respectively. In particular in the case of type IIb to V DAVFs, the appropriate treatment option is a complete fistula occlusion by transvenous embolization, transarterial glue or particulate embolization or surgery. In the following we systematically explain the differential anatomy underlying DAVFs and discuss possible symptoms and necessary diagnostic and therapeutic means. In that, we are seeking to increase attention for this rare, but clinically relevant neurological disease."

Stroke was diagnosed by CT scan in eight full-term neonates. Three dimensional (volume) magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) is a noninvasive technique that images the arterial vessels without contrast agents. All patients, aged from 1.5 to 8.4 years, were investigated by MRI and MRA and by neuropsychological tests. Cognitive development was investigated by intelligence tests, tests of visual perception, motor and language development. Out of the eight patients, seven had a retarded mental and motor development, and 50% of the children were treated for epilepsy. Seven patients had a spastic hemiparesis. Seven out of eight children showed major cognitive deficits. In all patients, MRI revealed clear parenchymal defects with variable distribution patterns. MRA studies showed abnormalities corresponding to the expected vascular distribution. Children with complications at delivery, with seizures, and an interruption of the main stem of MCA as demonstrated on MRA had the least favourable long-term follow up prognosis with severe cognitive delays."

CD009372,0,1633456,0,Charged-particle radiosurgery for intracranial vascular malformations.,"Heavy charged-particle radiation has unique physical characteristics that offer several advantages over photons and protons for stereotactic radiosurgery of intracranial AVMs. These include improved dose distributions with depth in tissue, small angle of lateral scattering, and sharp distal fall-off of dose in the Bragg ionization peak. Under multi-institutionally approved clinical trials, we have used stereotactic helium-ion Bragg peak radiosurgery to treat approximately 400 patients with symptomatic, surgically inaccessible vascular malformations at the UCB-LBL 184-in synchrocyclotron and bevatron. Treatment planning for stereotactic heavy charged-particle radiosurgery for intracranial vascular disorders integrates anatomic and physical information from the stereotactic cerebral angiogram and stereotactic CT and MR imaging scans for each patient, using computerized treatment-planning calculations for optimal isodose contour distribution. The shape of an intracranial AVM is associated strongly with its treatability and potential clinical outcome. In this respect, heavy charged-particle radiosurgery has distinct advantages over other radiosurgical methods; the unique physical properties allow the shaping of individual beams to encompass the contours of large and complexly shaped AVMs, while sparing important adjacent neural structures. We have had a long-term dose-searching clinical protocol in collaboration with SUMC and UCSF and have followed up over 300 patients for more than 2 years. Initially, treatment doses ranged from 45 GyE to 35 GyE. Currently, total doses up to 25 GyE are delivered to treatment volumes ranging from 0.1 cm3 to 70 cm3. This represents a relatively homogeneous dose distribution, with the 90% isodose surface contoured to the periphery of the lesion; there is considerable protection of normal adjacent brain tissues, and most of the brain receives no radiation exposure. Dose selection depends on the volume, shape, and location of the AVM and several other factors, including the volume of normal brain that must be traversed by the plateau portion of the charged-particle beam. The first 230 patients have been evaluated clinically to the end of 1989. Using the clinical grading of Drake, about 90% of the patients had an excellent or good neurologic grade, about 5% had a poor grade, and about 5% had progression of disease and died, or died as a result of unrelated intercurrent illness. Neuroradiologic follow-up to the end of 1989 indicated the following rates of complete angiographic obliteration 3 years after treatment: 90% to 95% for AVM treatment volumes less than 4 cm3, 90% to 95% for volumes 4 to 14 cm3, and 60% to 70% for volumes greater than 14 cm3.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

CD009372,0,20110380,0,Cerebral microvascular disease predicts renal failure in type 2 diabetes.,"Abnormalities in small renal vessels may increase the risk of developing impaired renal function, but methods to assess these vessels are extremely limited. We hypothesized that the presence of small vessel disease in the brain, which manifests as silent cerebral infarction (SCI), may predict the progression of kidney disease in patients with type 2 diabetes. We recruited 608 patients with type 2 diabetes without apparent cerebrovascular or cardiovascular disease or overt nephropathy and followed them for a mean of 7.5 years. At baseline, 177 of 608 patients had SCI, diagnosed by cerebral magnetic resonance imaging. The risk for the primary outcome of ESRD or death was significantly higher for patients with SCI than for patients without SCI [hazard ratio, 2.44; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.36 to 4.38]. The risk for the secondary renal end point of any dialysis or doubling of the serum creatinine concentration was also significantly higher for patients with SCI (hazard ratio, 4.79; 95% CI 2.72 to 8.46). The estimated GFR declined more in patients with SCI than in those without SCI; however, the presence of SCI did not increase the risk for progression of albuminuria. In conclusion, independent of microalbuminuria, cerebral microvascular disease predicted renal morbidity among patients with type 2 diabetes."
CD009372,0,10883918,0,Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis following subarachnoid hemorrhage. Case report.,"The authors present a case of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (HITT) that occurred after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), and they review the relevant literature. An immune-mediated syndrome, HITT is characterized by moderate thrombocytopenia and paradoxical vascular thromboses. Although it has been estimated in prospective studies that HITT occurs in between 1 and 3% of patients receiving heparin, it is underrecognized in the neurosurgical literature. In the present case, a 49-year-old woman underwent clipping of a right posterior communicating artery aneurysm after suffering a Hunt and Hess Grade III SAH. She had an uncomplicated postoperative course with good clip positioning and no vasospasm observed on a cerebral angiogram obtained on Day 7. On Day 23, the patient developed a right hemiparesis and experienced a grand mal seizure. A head computerized tomography scan revealed a hemorrhagic infarct in the left middle cerebral artery distribution. Repeated cerebral angiograms did not show vasospasm. She was thrombocytopenic (platelet count as low as 46 x 10(9)/L on Day 28 compared with 213 x 10(9)/L on Day 1) and had been receiving heparin flushes to maintain intravenous catheter patency. An assay for HITT-associated antibodies was positive. The heparin flushes were discontinued and the platelet count recovered (121 x 10(9)/L). She improved neurologically, but was left with a significant right hemiparesis at discharge. This patient had assay-proven heparin-induced thrombocytopenia despite minimal exposure to heparin. Because there was no evidence of vasospasm or other factors to account for her delayed hemorrhagic infarction, an HITT-related disorder seemed most likely. Despite a large body of literature describing HITT in nonneurosurgical patients, only three previous neurosurgical cases have been published. This case report may serve to heighten awareness of this disorder."

The study is prospective and consecutive comprising stroke patients below the age of 75 years, admitted in the acute state i.e. within 3 days after stroke onset. Excluded were patients with intracerebral hematoma, subarachnoid hemorrhage, vertebrobasilar stroke and patients in whom another severe disease was present. Cerebral angiography and CT-scan were performed in all patients within one and two days after admission. CT-scan was repeated 2 weeks and 6 months later. Forty percent had MCA occlusion, none had MCA stenosis, 12% had ICA occlusion, 14% had severe ICA stenosis (half of these were associated with MCA occlusion) and 41% were without significant MCA/ICA lesions. Twenty-seven percent had large infarcts with a diameter greater than 3 cm; 34% had medium-sized infarcts with a diameter between 3 and 1.5 cm; 21% had small infarcts with a diameter less than 1.5 cm; 18% had no identifiable infarct on CT-scan. MCA occlusion was responsible for 62% of the large or medium-sized infarcts. ICA occlusion or severe ICA stenosis were responsible for only 27% of the large or medium-sized infarcts.

CD009372,0,8350110,0,Transcranial Doppler detection of anterior cerebral artery vasospasm.,"The performance of transcranial Doppler in the detection of anterior cerebral artery vasospasm and vasospasm in patients after subarachnoid haemorrhage was analysed. Transcranial Doppler and cerebral angiography were performed within the same 24 hours on each of 41 patients with acute subarachnoid haemorrhage. Sensitivity and specificity of transcranial Doppler to classify middle cerebral arteries, anterior cerebral arteries, and patients with angiographic vasospasm were determined at mean velocities of 120 and 140 cm/s. Accuracy of transcranial Doppler was better at 140 than at 120 cm/s. For the middle cerebral artery, sensitivity was 86%, specificity 98%. For the anterior cerebral artery, sensitivity was 13%, specificity 100%. Among all patients, sensitivity was 45%, specificity 96%. Among patients with anterior communicating artery aneurysms, sensitivity was 14%, specificity 90%. Therefore, transcranial Doppler accurately differentiates between middle cerebral arteries with and without vasospasm on angiography, but has a very low sensitivity for detecting anterior cerebral artery vasospasm and vasospasm in patients with anterior communicating artery aneurysms. Since vasospasm may involve anterior cerebral arteries while sparing middle cerebral arteries, especially after rupture of an anterior communicating artery aneurysm, caution should be exercised in using negative transcranial Doppler results to make treatment decisions based on the assumed absence of vasospasm."

Currently, time-of-flight (TOF) MRA, phase contrast (PC) MRA, and contrast-enhanced MRA are being studied for their potential for diagnosing cerebrorascular diseases. Many specific flow signal patterns and artifacts are observed on MRI. MRA has recently been developed on the basis of the studies on the MR flow phenomenon. However, flow artifacts are observed even in MRA, and most of the pitfalls associated with MRA have arisen due to the MR flow phenomenon. To avoid false-negative and false-positive results in MRA, it is very important to understand the MR flow phenomenon and flow artifacts. The purpose of this paper is to explain the MR flow phenomenon, flow artifacts, and the principle of MRA. Furthermore, the technical development of TOF MRA and the pitfalls observed while evaluating clinical cases have been discussed. This paper also clarifies MR flow artifacts and the current status of cerebral 3D TOF MRA, and explains how to avoid false negative and false positive results in MRA."

CD009372,0,23693044,0,Coil embolization of intracranial aneurysm in polyarteritis nodosa. A case report and review of the literature.,"Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) is a rare multisystem disease characterized by systemic necrotizing arteritis of small and medium size arteries. The skin, joints, kidneys, gastrointestinal tract and peripheral nerves are most commonly involved. Although aneurysms are commonly seen in the visceral vessels, intracranial aneurysms are rare with 15 reported cases. The intracranial aneurysms are usually multiple and located in supra- as well as infra-tentorial compartments. Most of the cases presented with subarachnoid or parenchymal hemorrhage. The aneurysms were usually small, although large cavernous aneurysms were reported in one case. Treatment guidelines are not clear regarding the management of these cases. Most patients were treated conservatively by medical management with surgical excision performed in only two cases and coiling done in one patient with cavernous aneurysms. Repeat hemorrhages or re-bleed in spite of medical treatment have also been reported. We describe the case of a 22-year-old woman, a known case of PAN who presented with subarachnoid hemorrhage. Cerebral angiogram showed a ruptured right middle cerebral artery bifurcation aneurysm along with unruptured left middle cerebral, right posterior communicating and left posterior inferior cerebellar artery aneurysms. Her previous abdominal angiogram had revealed multiple aneurysms in visceral arteries. Successful coil embolization of the ruptured right MCA bifurcation aneurysm was performed with preservation of the parent vessel. The patient made a complete recovery and was placed on medical treatment for PAN. Follow-up MR angiography at three months revealed stable occlusion of the embolized aneurysm with no change in the unruptured aneurysms. Although rare, PAN can be associated with intracranial aneurysms which can cause subarachnoid or parenchymal hemorrhage. Selected cases can be treated safely by coil embolization."

CD009372,0,1392244,0,Automated local maximum-intensity projection with three-dimensional vessel tracking.,"Despite the simplicity and widespread acceptance of the maximum-intensity-projection (MIP) technique for displaying three-dimensional (3D) magnetic resonance angiographic data, several disadvantages are associated with MIP as it is applied to all of the 3D data. These include elevated noise level, reduced contrast between small vessels and background tissue, and the inability to distinguish arteries from veins. The authors have developed a 3D vessel tracking method combined with a local MIP around a given vessel to complement conventional MIP and alleviate these problems. The method is referred to as a traveling MIP (TMIP). TMIP was evaluated in both patients and healthy volunteers. The results indicate that TMIP provides better contrast between vessels and background tissue, better lumen definition, and better vascular visualization than either MIP or vessel tracking alone."

CD009372,0,10360773,0,Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging: detection of ischemic injury 39 minutes after onset in a stroke patient.,A neurologist witnessed the in-hospital onset of an ischemic stroke in a 71-year-old right-handed male who suddenly developed global aphasia and right hemiplegia. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) 39 minutes after the ictus demonstrated high signals in the left internal carotid artery territory. T1- and T2-weighted images failed to detect this change. Magnetic resonance angiography showed occlusions in branches of the left anterior and middle cerebral arteries and an atheromatous stenotic lesion in the ipsilateral proximal internal carotid artery. The patient was treated with intravenous heparin and low molecular dextran solution. Repeated magnetic resonance imagings identified an infarction slightly smaller than the abnormality demonstrated by the initial DWI. DWI detects hyperacute ischemic injury within 1 hour of symptom onset in human ischemic stroke.

CD009372,0,10037831,0,[Preoperative magnetic resonance angiography findings and postoperative neurological complications in 93 cases of CABG with cardiopulmonary bypass].,"Between February 1994 and January 1997, 102 of the 146 patients treated by coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) had undergone magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the brain and neck before the operation, and arterial stenosis or occlusion had been detected in 38 (36.9%) of them. Two of these patients had complicating severe calcification of the ascending aorta, and CABG was performed without cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Seven patients without stenotic lesions on MRA were also treated by CABG without CPB for other complications. In addition to the 102 patients one patient had been found to have occlusion of the left common carotid artery and poor enhancement of the distal portion, and as a result we switched from CABG to percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTCA). We enrolled 93 patients in this study excluding these 10 patients. The patients were distributed into the three groups according to the MRA findings. Group C = no stenotic lesions (58 patients). Group S = stenosis of < 70% (26 patients), Group SS = stenosis of > or = 70% (9 patients). Enhancement distal to the stenotic or occlusive lesions was good in all patients in group S and SS. We then examined them for the incidence of postoperative neurological complications. There were no significant differences among the three groups in regard to age, male/female ratio, or incidence of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. In Group S, the incidence of diabetes was significantly higher than in the other Groups. The incidence of prior stroke was significantly higher and the number of coronary arteries affected was significantly larger in group SS than the other groups. There were no significant differences among the three groups with regard to intraoperative variables. The lowest mean arterial pressure on CPB was 44.3 +/- 7.4 mmHg, 48.0 +/- 8.8 mmHg, 46.3 +/- 7.8 mmHg in Group C, S, and SS, respectively, In all groups the lowest mean arterial pressure on CPB was below 50 mmHg. There were no significant differences among the three groups with regard to time to awaken and time to extubation. Two patients experienced transient conciousness disturbance after CABG, one in Group C, the other in Group SS, but no new lesions were detected by brain CT. Only one patient, in Group C. suffered a stroke and had a new lesion on brain CT a month after the operation. No strokes occurred in the perioperative period. In nine patients with good enhancement distal to the severe stenotic or occlusive lesion on MRA of the brain and neck the lowest mean arterial pressure on CPB was below 50 mmHg, but there was no postoperative neurological complications due to the low perfusion pressure on CPB. The results of this study suggested that CABG with CPB can be performed safely in patients with good enhancement distal to the stenotic or occlusive lesions on MRA of the brain and neck."
CD009372,0,9589619,0,Familial intracranial aneurysms.,"We describe a 53-year-old mother and a her 34-year-old son who suffered from spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and/or intracerebral hemorrhage due to a ruptured intracranial aneurysm. Diagnosis of the intracranial aneurysm was made by CT scan of the brain, and cerebral angiography. These two cases received surgical intervention and returned to their previous social activity after discharge, even though the mother had arrived in a comatose condition. The literature is reviewed and the characteristic expressions of familial intracranial aneurysms are described. The etiology of cerebral aneurysms is still uncertain but it is likely multifactorial. For the 176 patients with intracranial aneurysm(s) treated at Kaohsiung Medical College Hospital, the mean age at diagnosis was 51.9 years and these aneurysms were distributed mainly at the internal carotid artery (43.8%) and the anterior communicating artery (33.5%). The familial aneurysms tend to rupture at a younger age, occur less often at the anterior communicating artery and more often at the internal carotid artery and the middle cerebral artery as compared with that of non-familial aneurysms. In siblings, aneurysms occur at identical sites or at mirror sites and rupture within the same decade of life twice as frequently as expected in non-familial aneurysm cases. The familial aggregation of intracranial aneurysms and the above characteristic expressions suggest that heredity may play a role in some familial aneurysms. The pattern of inheritance, however, has not been established. Screening examinations and the treatment of unruptured intracranial aneurysms in asymptomatic relatives of the familial cases are also discussed."
CD009372,0,15782005,0,Incomplete oculomotor nerve palsy caused by an unruptured internal carotid-anterior choroidal artery aneurysm--case report--.,"A 59-year-old woman visited our institute with the chief complaint of dizziness which persisted whenever she tried to focus on objects. She had not experienced apparent double vision and had no history of intracranial bleeding. Neurological examination revealed no abnormality except for exotropia at the mid-position and at upper gaze. Cerebral angiography revealed that the intracranial portion of the left internal carotid artery ran more horizontally and also identified an unruptured left internal carotid-anterior choroidal artery (IC-AChA) aneurysm of 3.0 mm diameter. The aneurysm at the origin of the AChA was confirmed during surgery. The proximal lateral wall of the aneurysm was in contact with the oculomotor nerve. This contact was released after complete obliteration of the aneurysm. The exotropia resolved 3 months later. Oculomotor nerve palsy usually indicates the presence of internal carotid-posterior communicating artery (IC-PcomA) aneurysm. Since sacrifice of the AChA will result in severe neurological deficits, accurate neuroimaging information is needed prior to the operation. Conventional angiography and/or three-dimensional computed tomography angiography should be performed to ascertain whether the aneurysm is an IC-PcomA or IC-AChA aneurysm, even if some neurosurgeons insist that conventional angiography is not always needed before surgery for an unruptured aneurysm."

A previously silent lesion in the spinal canal may be responsible for the ictus in a small percentage of this group. The etiological factors include tumors and arteriovenous malformations; however, investigations of such lesions have been limited to patients with signs and symptoms of spinal cord or nerve root pathological processes. This report describes the management of a 56-year-old woman with clinical findings typical of an aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage and negative findings on cerebral angiography, in whom magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium enhancement revealed an intradural extramedullary cervical schwannoma. For this reason, cervicothoracic magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium enhancement should be considered as an adjunctive scanning examination in all patients with a subarachnoid hemorrhage and negative findings on angiography."

CD009372,0,23001815,0,Advanced neuroimaging to guide acute stroke therapy.,"Traditionally non-contrast CT has been considered the first choice imaging modality for acute stroke. Acute ischemic stroke patients presenting to the hospital within 3-hours from symptom onset and without any visible hemorrhages or large lesions on CT images are considered optimum reperfusion therapy candidates. However, non-contrast CT alone has been unable to identify best reperfusion therapy candidates outside this window. New advanced imaging techniques are now being used successfully for this purpose. Non-invasive CT or MR angiography images can be obtained during initial imaging evaluation for identification and characterization of vascular lesions, including occlusions, aneurysms, and malformations. Either CT-based perfusion imaging or MRI-based diffusion and perfusion imaging performed immediately upon arrival of a patient to the hospital helps estimate the extent of fixed core and penumbra in ischemic lesions. Patients having occlusive lesions with small fixed cores and large penumbra are preferred reperfusion therapy candidates."
CD009372,0,9394867,0,Magnetic resonance techniques in the evaluation of the newborn brain.,"MR imaging provides unequaled sensitivity as compared with US or CT scanning for evaluating developmental changes and pathologic processes in the newborn brain. Myelination can be assessed qualitatively and quantitatively using newer 3D-MR imaging methods. MR imaging provides a much clearer delineation of many developmental disorders, including anomalies of migration and organization, as well as a variety of metabolic disorders and congenital infections. Neonatal intracranial hemorrhage is detected in all its locations by MR imaging. The timing of the hemorrhage is a unique feature of MR imaging. Venous thrombosis also can be identified by MR imaging and confirmed with MR angiography. HIE is the major cause of potentially preventable or reversible brain injury that results in considerable long-term neurologic morbidity. Early detection is crucial for interventions aimed at preventing or reversing ongoing injury. DWI can show early changes at the cellular level that are not detectable by any other imaging modality. MR spectroscopy has further opened the possibility of studying the metabolic mechanisms that define the pathophysiologic events taking place in neonatal brain injury. Both 31P-MR spectroscopy, as a marker of the acute changes in energy metabolism, and 1H-MR spectroscopy, with the measurement of lactate and the excitotoxic aminoacids glutamate and glutamine, have enabled us to study the early and late effects of insults to the newborn brain in a noninvasive fashion. Studies performed to determine the predictive value of MR spectroscopy for later neurodevelopmental outcome after HIE have shown promising results but need further evaluation on larger patient samples. The potential use of these methods in the evaluation of early neuroprotective treatment regimens in the newborn remains to be determined."

In 19 patients, LAA was larger than LDA beyond the vascular territory. Brain angiogram showed either obstruction or stenosis of the major arteries in as many as 59 percentages of this discrepancy group. In many patients of this group, cortical neurological symptoms were observed. In 37 patients in which the size of LAA was equal to that of LDA, abnormality of the major arteries was observed in only 7 percentages. These results indicated that the discrepancy mainly reflected the infarction due to irreversible ischemic change of perforate artery with the cortical low perfusion caused by the major artery disease. In some patients, the discrepancy was believed to show the remote effect caused by neurological pathway disturbance."

TCH is a rare manifestation in cerebral or cerebellar infarctions. Herein, we report on a 60-year-old woman with a thunderclap headache as the first symptom of cerebellar infarction, in the absence of abnormal findings in the brain computed tomography (CT), CT angiography, and lumbar puncture. An urgent brain MRI showed an acute infarction of the right cerebellar hemisphere. The next day, the patient presented with right side ataxia.

CD009372,0,22721822,0,Multistage indocyanine green videoangiography for the convexity dural arteriovenous fistula with angiographically occult pial fistula.,"Recently, intraoperative indocyanine green (ICG) videoangiography has become a common technique for treating cerebrovascular diseases. We report a case of dural arteriovenous fistula (AVF) treated with direct surgery using intraoperative ICG videoangiography. A 41-year-old man with right hemiplegia caused by a left subcortical hemorrhage was transferred to our hospital. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) revealed a left convexity parasagittal dural AVF. Surgical resection of the dural AVF was performed using step-by-step ICG videoangiography 4 times in each dissection procedure, which precisely delineated the structure of the dural AVF. After a circular incision of the dura around the fistular point, repeated ICG videoangiography identified the residual fistula between the pial artery from the middle cerebral artery and the draining vein. Complete disappearance of the AVF was confirmed by ICG videoangiography after this pial fistula was removed. Postoperative DSA revealed no residual AVF. Accurate detection of all fistular points and complete resection, including the dura mater and pial vessels, are necessary to avoid rebleeding caused by the residual dural AVF due to incomplete obliteration of the fistular points. Intraoperative ICG videoangiography could provide information on angiographically occult vascular malformation, such as pial fistulas, that cannot be detected by preoperative DSA. Our findings suggest that multistage intraoperative ICG videoangiography can be quite useful for complete resection of a dural AVF with angiographically occult pial fistula."

Perfusion measured by ASL carries relevant information for patients suffering from pathologies associated with singular perfusion patterns. However, to date, individual identification of abnormal perfusion patterns in ASL usually relies on visual inspection or manual delineation of regions of interest. In this paper, we introduce a new framework to automatically outline patterns of abnormal perfusion in individual patients by means of an ASL template. We compare two models of normal perfusion and assess the quality of detections comparing an a contrario approach to the generalized linear model (GLM)."

Magnetic resonance angiography and other tests have made diagnosis easier and safer, particularly in very young children and in patients with sickle cell disease. Transcranial Doppler examination makes it possible to accurately predict without angiography which patients with sickle cell disease are at most risk for stroke. Many patients with mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episodes (MELAS) syndrome have a specific mutation of the mitochondrial DNA, and soon the recently devised diagnostic criteria for MELAS syndrome may be replaced by molecular markers. There are many causes of cerebrovascular disease in children, and a thorough evaluation will discover a likely cause in about two thirds of the patients. Recent attention has focused on the HLA-B51 antigen and chicken pox as possible risk factors.

CD009372,0,11452855,1,Our own experience with CT angiography in early diagnosis of cerebral vascular malformations.,"Computed tomography (CT) and intraarterial cerebral angiography are essential methods in early diagnosis of cerebral vascular malformations. In recent years however non-invasive or minimally invasive methods like MR angiography and CT angiography (CTA), which could potentially replace angiography, have been developed. The aim of presented study is to demonstrate our own experience in application of CTA in early diagnosis of cerebral vascular malformations. The material consists of 86 CTA examinations performed shortly after non-traumatic intracranial haemorrhage. Angiographic correlation has been available in 23 patients and surgical one--in 31 cases. CTA studies began with serio-CT to select the optimal time between contrast injection and CT scanning. After that 100-120 ml of non-ionic contrast medium was injected intravenously (5 ml per sec.) and spiral CT acqusition was performed with the delay calculated on the basis of the serio-CT. The obtained images were postprocessed on the workstation using always MIP and in many cases also SSD and VRT reconstructions. Vascular malformations have been diagnosed in 44 of 86 CTA studies including 38 patients with aneurysms (total number 51) and 6 patients with AVMs. In 17 cases the diameter of the aneurysm did not exceed 5 mm. In all surgical cases the CTA diagnosis of the aneurysm has been confirmed. There was however one false-negative case. On the other hand in 7 patients CTA revealed the small aneurysm, despite unclear angiographic appearance. In 2 of 6 patients with CTA suspicion of AVM this diagnosis has been excluded either by angiography or surgery. Comparison of CTA and angiography in 22 aneurysms showed in 17 cases superiority of CTA in evaluation of aneurysmal neck and the relationship between aneurysm and adjacent vessels (especially with VRT and SSD reconstructions). In patients with AVMs however the evaluation of supplying and draining vessels was better with angiography. On the base of our material we can conclude that CTA is very efficient in detecting and evaluating the aneurysms. We believe that CTA can replace angiography if it reveals aneurysm in a site corresponding with location of haemorrhage on CT. In patients with suspicion of AVM value of CTA is doubtful and angiography remains the method of choice."

CD009372,0,8851433,0,Quantitative MR imaging of children with sickle cell disease: striking T1 elevation in the thalamus.,"Nineteen patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) were examined with conventional MR imaging (cMRI), including T1- and T2-weighted sequences and MR angiography (MRA). qMRI mapping of T1 was also done using a precise and accurate inversion-recovery (PAIR) technique optimized and validated previously. In addition, 21 healthy African-American control subjects had the qMRI examination. Nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance of control subjects, of SCD patients without stroke, and of SCD patients with stroke showed that T1 increased with disease severity in the thalamus, frontal white matter, genu, and occipital white matter. T1 was significantly longer in SCD patients without stroke (n = 13) than in control subjects (n = 21) in the thalamus and frontal white matter. In addition, T1 values were significantly longer in SCD patients with stroke than in patients without stroke in the genu and frontal white matter. Abnormality of the thalamus was identified by qMRI in a substantial fraction of patients read as normal by both cMRI and MRA, suggesting that it may be possible to use T1 elevation to identify a subset of patients with SCD who are at elevated risk for stroke."

CD009372,0,2164304,0,[Surgical treatment of multiple arterial aneurysms of the brain].,"On the basis of analysis of 83 cases with multiple arterial aneurysms of the brain, the authors arrived at the following conclusions. The frequency of their recognition is 10.3% and is directly dependent on the completeness and thoroughness of the angiographic examination. Recurrent hemorrhages in multiple aneurysms occur mostly from one and the same aneurysm (85.3%) and in rare cases form different aneurysms (14.7%). With the use of a diagnostic complex (cerebral angiography, EEG, CT, careful study of the medical history and the clinical picture of the disease) the aneurysm which is the source of the intracranial bleeding can be identified in most cases (93%), which is important in planning the tactics of surgical treatment. Exclusion of all aneurysms, in one stage if possible, is the main principle of surgical management of multiple aneurysms. The aneurysm which caused the intracranial bleeding should be excluded first. The development of surgical approaches to the aneurysms and the use of microsurgery made it possible to achieve definite successes in surgery of multiple aneurysms. Postoperative lethality was 2.7%. Most of the patients (84.7%) are capable of working or are adapted to every-day life."

Cohorts of mildly cognitively impaired (MCI) elderly (n = 73) and cognitively normal participants (n = 33) have been serially evaluated for up to 50 months. SWI phase values (putative iron levels) in 14 brain regions were measured and the number of BMB were counted for each SWI study. SWI phase values showed a left putaminal mean increase of iron (decrease of phase values) over the study duration in 27 participants who progressed to dementia compared to Normals (p = 0.035) and stable MCI (p = 0.01). BMB were detected in 9 out of 26 (38%) MCI participants who progressed to dementia and are a significant risk factor for cognitive failure in MCI participants [risk ratio = 2.06 (95% confidence interval 1.37-3.12)]. SWI is useful to measure regional iron changes and presence of BMB, both of which may be important MR-based biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases."

We report a rare case of idiopathic dolichoectasia of the anterior cerebral artery in a 22-year-old female. The patient caused an automobile accident and was brought to our hospital in an ambulance. A computed tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging revealed no fresh lesions, but showed a prominent serpentine structure with calcification and flow void in the region of the interhemispheric fissure, which was suspicious for arteriovenous malformation or arteriovenous fistula. Cerebral angiography demonstrated extensive dilatation of the anterior cerebral artery, but no evidence of arteriovenous malformation or arteriovenous fistula. Single photon emission computed tomography revealed hypoperfusion of the right frontal lobe at rest. Electroencephalography showed no epileptic discharge. The patient's course was uneventful, and she was discharged with no neurologic deficit. There are few reports of hemodynamic changes in cases of dolichoectasia. In the diagnosis of cerebral dolichoectasia, cerebral hemodynamics should be examined carefully in addition to evaluating vascular disease by angiography."
CD009372,0,1468873,0,Intracranial magnetic resonance imaging.,"Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) is currently being incorporated into the routine MR evaluations of patients with suspected cerebrovascular disease. Currently, MRA serves as a useful adjunct to routine parenchymal spin-echo imaging of the head. Intracranial MRA is predominantly used as a screening test for cerebrovascular disease in situations where the clinical suspicion and/or the patient's physical condition does not warrant a conventional arteriogram. Clinical experience to date suggests that MRA can play a significant role in the evaluation of patients with suspected intracranial aneurysms, arteriovenous fistulae, large vessel occlusive disease, and dural sinus occlusion/thrombosis. MRA has not yet reached the point where it can replace conventional catheter angiography. This is most apparent when trying to evaluate 1) larger vessels which are typically difficult to visualize due to higher order motion terms (eg, carotid siphon); 2) the smaller cortical branches with relatively slow flow that would be necessary to see in patients with suspected vasculitis; and 3) any situation in which dynamic information is important such as with mass lesions or vascular malformations. These limitations must be taken into account when deciding on the appropriate imaging study for an individual patient. Large-scale, well-controlled prospective clinical trials will ultimately determine the role intracranial MRA will play in the evaluation of patients with suspected cerebrovascular disease."

CD009372,0,1730952,0,"Lobar intracerebral hemorrhage. A clinical, radiographic, and pathological study of 29 consecutive operated cases with negative angiography.","The authors operated consecutively on 50 patients with lobar intracerebral hemorrhage during a prospectively designed study period from January, 1986, to March, 1990. They investigated the correlations between the underlying causes and the clinicoradiographic features in 29 patients who showed no angiographic vascular abnormalities, in order to elucidate the operative indication for such cases. Patients with ruptured saccular aneurysm or trauma were not included in this study. There were 15 males and 14 females, ranging in age from 7 to 76 years (mean 52.4 years). Histological diagnoses of the surgical specimens were as follows: vascular malformation in nine cases (arteriovenous malformation (AVM) in six and cavernous malformation in three), microaneurysm in 11, cerebral amyloid angiopathy in six, and brain tumor in two; in the remaining case the cause was not verified histologically. The underlying cause was determined in 96.5% of cases. The mean patient age was lowest in the cavernous malformation group (27.0 years), followed by the AVM (45.8 years), microaneurysm (59.8 years), and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (70.0 years) groups. Four patients with vascular malformation (three AVM's and one cavernous malformation) had previous episodes of bleeding at the same site, whereas none of those with microaneurysms or cerebral amyloid angiopathy had such episodes. On computerized tomography (CT) scans, the round to oval hematoma was related to the presence of an AVM or cavernous malformation in contrast to microaneurysms and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Upon infusion of contrast material, variable enhancement was seen in five (two AVM's and three cavernous malformations) of the nine vascular malformations while no enhancement was noted in any patient with microaneurysm or cerebral amyloid angiopathy at the acute stage. Subarachnoid extension of the hematoma was associated with cerebral amyloid angiopathy significantly more frequently than with AVM's (p less than 0.05) and microaneurysms (p less than 0.01). The results suggest that clinicoradiographic pictures in cases with negative angiography are quite different among the three major pathological categories; namely, vascular malformation (AVM and cavernous malformation), microaneurysm, and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. It is suggested that the underlying etiology of a given lobar intracerebral hemorrhage with negative angiography may be predicted by a combination of patient age, history of previous bleeding at the same site, hematoma shape, and subarachnoid extension of the hematoma on CT scans. Based upon these findings, the authors discuss operative indications for such cases."

Two children had subarachnoid hemorrhage, one having resolution of symptoms after aneurysm surgery and another dying of a presumed second hemorrhage 14 days later. The remaining 15 strokes were presumed to be cerebral infarction, although autopsy, angiographic, or computed tomographic evidence was available in only 8 children. There were 6 deaths, 2 in the acute event and 4 after recurrence, which occurred in 6 (46%) of 13 patients who survived the initial episode. There were 10 recurrent episodes at a median interval of 9 months after the initial event. Steady-state hematologic data revealed significantly higher leukocyte counts than in control subjects without strokes at age 1 year and in the last study preceding the stroke. The initial stroke coincided with an acutely lowered hemoglobin value in 5 patients (3 aplastic crises, 1 acute splenic sequestration, 1 probable pulmonary sequestration) and with painful crises in another 7 patients. We conclude that a high leukocyte count and an acute decrease of hemoglobin are risk factors for stroke in patients with homozygous sickle cell disease."

CD009372,0,9186035,0,Magnetic resonance angiography in children.,"MRA in children utilizes the same pulse sequences used in adults, but for investigation of the differing forms of vascular pathology found in the pediatric population. Because of the extreme sensitivity of MRA to motion artifact, sedation is an important adjunct to the performance of diagnostic MRI and MRA in children. Because of the noninvasive nature of MRA, strictly diagnostic conventional angiography in children is uncommonly performed and frequently directed toward investigation and therapy of intracranial vascular malformations. Common indications for MRA in children include sickle cell vasculopathy, cerebral and posterior fossa infarction, tumors, vascular malformations, and follow-up of patients recently on extra corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Non-invasive follow-up subsequent to surgical or medical therapy of intra or extra cranial vascular pathology is another important use for MRA in children."

CD009372,0,7868330,0,Postangiography headache.,"In order to study the frequency and characteristics of post-angiography headache, we interviewed 45 consecutive patients (mean age +/- SD = 57 +/- 15 years; M/F = 15/30) who underwent transfemoral cerebral angiography for: ischemic cerebrovascular disease (n = 33); suspected arteriovenous malformations (n = 4; one confirmed); suspected cerebral aneurysm (n = 5; two confirmed); and arterial dissection (n = 3; one confirmed and one was a follow-up study of a previously demonstrated dissection). Postangiography headache developed in 15 (33%) patients, 125 +/- 99 min after the completion of the study. It was unilateral in nine (60%) patients, homolateral to the usual side of migraine headache in two or three migraineurs, and pulsating in six (40%). Nausea, vomiting, photophobia, and phonophobia accompanied postangiography headache in 20%, 7%, 33%, and 20% respectively. Postangiography headache fulfilled the International Headache Society criteria for migraine without aura (except for the number of attacks) in 27% of patients. Patients with and those without postangiography headache were comparable in mean age, sex, and indication for angiography. Fifty-three percent (8/15) of patients with postangiography headache and 23% (7/30) of the non postangiography headache group reported prior recurrent headaches (P = 0.047, likelihood ratio chi-square). Postangiography headache has the characteristics of delayed arterial pain which may be related to a catheter-induced or contrast dye-induced release of vasoactive substances, notably nitric oxide and serotonin."

CD009372,0,1997899,0,Emergent aneurysm surgery without cerebral angiography for the comatose patient.,"Neurologically based clinical grading scales offer excellent prognostic information for the patient suffering diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). These grading scales are less applicable to patients with life-threatening intraparenchymal hematomas after aneurysmal rupture. During the last 3 years, four patients in a comatose state with brain stem compression syndromes documented by computed tomographic scans have undergone emergent operation in our neurosurgical service. Each patient was so critically ill that we believed it unwise to delay craniotomy for diagnostic angiography. The average delay from the onset of coma to skin incision was 3.02 hours (range, 1.67-6.5 hours), and the average delay from arrival in our unit until skin incision was 1.8 hours (range, 0.75-2.5 hours). The condition of two arousable patients deteriorated while they were in the emergency room, presumably from new bleeding. Each patient underwent craniotomy for hematoma evacuation, definitive aneurysm clipping, and lobectomy for decompression. Temporary clipping was employed in one patient, and intraoperative rupture occurred in two others. Three patients survived but retain significant disability. Emergent craniotomy with empiric exploration of appropriate subarachnoid cisterns after hematoma decompression may be life-saving in some cases. The delay imposed for diagnostic angiography may be avoided in attempts to save vital minutes of severe brain stem compression."

CD009372,0,8519603,0,Diffusion and perfusion MR imaging of cerebral ischemia.,"Over the last few years, diffusion and perfusion magnetic resonance (MR) imaging methods have found increasing user for monitoring the effects of cerebral ischemia under clinical and experimental conditions. Blood perfusion can be visualized by studying the patency of the cerebrovascular bed (MR angiography), by recording exchange of diffusible tracers between blood and brain ([2H]water or [19F]trifluoromethane clearance), or by measuring the volume and transit time of the circulating blood (bolus track or spin-tagging imaging). In addition, changes in blood oxygenation level can be visualized by taking advantage of the susceptibility changes of the magnetic field homogeneity (functional or blood-oxygenation-level-dependent imaging). Diffusion imaging is based on the modulation of signal intensity by brain water diffusion. Recording a series of diffusion-weighted images allows calculation of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and the reconstruction of quantitative ADC images. Brain ADC changes are a function of intra-extracellular water homeostasis and therefore are a sensitive marker of ionic equilibrium. Since disturbances of ion and water homeostasis are among the first pathological alterations induced by brain ischemia, diffusion imaging is able to detect the incipient injury within minutes. Conversely, the reversal of these alterations is able to detect the incipient injury within minutes. Conversely, the reversal of these alterations is an early and reliable predictor of postischemic recovery. Applications of perfusion and diffusion imaging are reviewed in relation to the pathophysiology, the pathobiochemistry, and the therapy of evolving brain infarct after focal ischemia and the manifestation and reversal of ischemic injury during and after global ischemia."
CD009372,0,15257380,0,[Multimodal computed tomography in acute cerebral infarction. Experience with a standardized protocol in 100 patients].,"Computed tomography (CT) is the standard method of brain imaging in acute stroke. To an experienced examiner, nonenhanced CT will exclude hemorrhage and may indicate early ischemic signs. Reliable description of an ischemic area and the underlying vascular disease is not possible in the acute phase but is possible, particularly within the first hours, when therapeutic decisions on matters such as systemic thrombolysis are to be made. For such rapid decision-making, imaging must provide more information. Novel, contrast-enhanced CT techniques can provide this information. Perfusion CT (CTP) can show brain perfusion, allowing one to distinguish between reversible and irreversible damage in an ischemic area. Also, CT angiography (CTA) can detect occlusion or stenosis in the relevant vasculature. Using a modern, multislice CT scanner, it is now possible to combine these modalities of imaging. In a fast protocol for emergency evaluation, all three methods can be performed and evaluated to provide the crucial information within 15 min. In the first 102 patients examined within 6 h of symptom onset using this protocol, multimodal CT contributed substantially to therapeutic decisions, even though there are some limitations in these methods."

FMD affects the proximal one-third of the internal carotid artery in almost all cases and is bilateral in 60% to 85%, with middle-aged women affected in 85% of the cases. Ischaemic stroke has been postulated to result from severe stenosis or thrombotic occlusion at the FMD site. Cerebral embolism from FMD has rarely been reported. We report 3 young patients with acute ischaemic stroke who had FMD on cerebral angiography. They presented with a focal hemispheric stroke where the probable pathophysiology is embolism to the distal internal carotid artery from thrombus formed at the proximal FMD site. The patients were all males, with unilateral proximal internal carotid artery FMD lesions and occlusion of the internal carotid artery distally on the same side.

CT scans 4 days after the operation showed infarctions of the distribution of the bilateral cerebral hemispheres. Cerebral angiography on the 11th hospital day demonstrated narrowing of the extracranial internal carotid artery at C1-C2 vertebral levels. Slight arterial dilatation and retention of the contrast medium were found just above the narrowing segment, which was suspected to be a pseudolumen. Three D time-of flight MRA showed an intramural hematoma corresponding to the narrowing on the angiography. Original axial MRA images showed that narrowing of the lumen was surrounded by a crescent hematoma and that two flow velocity areas were in the area distal to the narrowing. High flow seemed to be ordinary artery flow rate. The low flow area, including turbulent flow, led to the retention of contrast medium mimicking a pseudolumen. Precise MRA imaging will bring us an accurate diagnosis of extracranial carotid dissections."

During the second week the accuracy of CT scanning increased to 100%, but static scintigraphy improved to only 50%. Fifty percent of scintiangiograms performed during the first week showed either luxuriant perfusion or flip-flop patterns. In some patients these two flow patterns changed to that of cerebral hemispheric ischemia after going through a phase during which perfusion appeared to be equal in the two hemispheres. Dynamic scintigraphy is believed to be the test of choice for stroke detection in children during the first week."

Initial CT scan showed ventricular hematomas resulting in acute hydrocephalus, but no obvious parenchymal or subarachnoid hemorrhage. Ventricular drainage was carried out. Subsequently, cerebral angiography was performed, but neither, an aneurysm nor other vascular abnormality was detected. 50 days after admission, MRI revealed a homogenous and well-circumscribed hypointense mass (12 mm in diameter) in the right cerebellar tonsil, suggesting the presence of hemosiderin. 60 days after the onset, the second angiography showed an aneurysmal shadow arising from the distal part of the PICA. An aneurysmal clipping was performed via the suboccipital approach. A thrombosed aneurysm was identified in the right tonsil. At the time of the operation, we confirmed that the part of the PICA around the aneurysm was intact with neither branching nor discoloration.

CD009372,0,7753413,0,Evaluation of cerebral vasospasm in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage using single photon emission computed tomography.,"Cerebral vasospasm (CVS) occurs as a result of the breakdown in cerebral autoregulation mechanisms. Because cerebral vasospasm can occur after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), it is important to evaluate borderline perfusion. Evaluation of borderline vascular insufficiency is important to reduce ischemic complications. In this study 25 patients with SAH were investigated by somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP), computed tomography (CT), digital subtraction angiography (DSA) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in order to predict borderline ischemic areas. Clinical grades were also correlated with these investigations. Thirteen patients had symptomatic vasospasm and 15 patients had angiographic vasospasm. SPECT showed hypoperfusion in 22 out of 25 patients. CT predicted CVS in 8 of these 22 patients. Our study shows that brain perfusion SPECT is a non-traumatic, non-invasive, non-allergic, inexpensive method for the prediction of cerebral vasospasm. We conclude that brain SPECT with Tc-99m HM-PAO is an accessible technique that can demonstrate varying degrees of regional tissue hypoperfusion in patients with delayed ischemic deficits due to CVS following SAH."

CD009372,0,1564343,0,[Valve replacement in a patient with infective endocarditis and ruptured mycotic cerebral aneurysm].,"A 55-year-old man with a mild fever and sweating developed severe headache for the days before admission. Cerebral computed tomography and selected cerebral angiography on the day of admission revealed subarachnoid hemorrhage due to rupture of an aneurysm of a distal branch of the left middle cerebral artery. Detection of vegetation on the aortic valve by two dimensional echocardiography confirmed the diagnosis of infective endocarditis with a ruptured mycotic cerebral aneurysm. Because of rapid growth of the vegetation on the aortic valve and progression of heart failure despite antibiotic therapy, emergency cardiac surgery was performed. To prevent re-rupture of the aneurysm, the aortic valve was replaced with a bioprosthetic valve, and no anticoagulant was administered postoperatively. Repeated cerebral angiography revealed that the aneurysm was becoming progressively smaller during the next 9 months. No cerebrovascular accident occurred postoperatively. We believe that it is safe to treat a ruptured mycotic cerebral aneurysm without involvement of a hematoma mass in the brain conservatively, and that use of a bioprosthetic valve, if valve replacement is mandatory, and avoidance of anticoagulant therapy during the postoperative period are advisable in the treatment of a patient with infective endocarditis and a ruptured cerebral mycotic aneurysm."

Among those, circumscribed SAHs along the cortical convexity are rare and have only been described in singular case reports so far. Here, we present a collection of 12 cases of SAH along the convexity, of non-traumatic origin. Over a period of 10 years, 12 cases of circumscribed SAH along the convexity were identified at our clinic. The clinical presentations, neuroradiological SAH characteristics, further diagnostic work-up to identify the underlying aetiologies, the therapy and clinical outcome were analysed. The patients' chief complaints were unspecific cephalgia, focal or generalised seizures and focal neurological deficits. Typical signs of basal SAH, such as nuchal rigidity, thunderclap-headache or alteration of consciousness, were rare. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and digital subtraction angiography (DSA) revealed different aetiologies, namely postpartal posterior encephalopathy (three), cerebral vasculitis (two), dural sinus thrombosis (two), cortical venous thrombosis (one), intracerebral abscesses (one) and cerebral cavernoma (one). Two cases remained unresolved. Treatment of the underlying disease and symptomatic medication led to good clinical outcome in almost all cases. On the basis of these findings, we demonstrate that the clinical presentation, localisation and aetiology of cortical SAH differ clearly from other SAHs. A diagnostic work-up with MRI and eventually DSA is essential. Mostly, the causative disease can be identified, and specific treatment allows a favourable outcome."

CD009372,0,7425568,0,Lobar cerebral hemorrhages: acute clinical syndromes in 26 cases.,"The acute syndromes and CT findings are described in 26 cases of spontaneous cerebral hemorrhage. Occipital hemorrhage (11 cases) caused severe pain around the ipsilateral eye and dense hemianopia. Left temporal hemorrhage (7 cases) began with mild pain in or just anterior to the ear, fluent dysphasia with poor auditory comprehension but relatively good repetition, and a visual deficit subtending less than a hemianopia. Frontal hemorrhage (4 cases) caused a distinctive syndrome beginning with severe contralateral arm weakness, minimal leg and face weakness, and frontal headache. Parietal hemorrhage (3 cases) began with anterior temporal (""temple"") headache and hemisensory deficit, sometimes involving the trunk to the midline. One patient had a right temporal hemorrhage. Spontaneous lobar hemorrhage and branch artery embolism in the same region produce similar clinical syndromes. Headache is a first and prominent symptom. A rapid but not instantaneous onset over several minutes, when combined with one of the typical syndromes, suggests lobar hemorrhage rather than other types of stroke. Ancillary investigations (including CT scanning, angiography in 11 patients, and autopsy in 4) disclosed 2 patients with bleeding diatheses due to warfarin, 2 with arteriovenous malformations, and 1 with metastatic tumor. Only 8 of the 26 patients had chronic hypertension (blood pressure greater than 130/85 mm Hg), suggesting that hypertension is not an etiological factor in most lobar hemorrhages."

Case report and review of the literature.,"Sneddon's syndrome is characterized by livedo reticularis and multiple ischemic infarcts often associated with antiphospholipid antibodies. Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is unusual in Sneddon's syndrome and has not been reported as the presenting complaint. We report a 38-year-old woman with a history of two miscarriages, Raynaud's phenomenon and livedo reticularis who presented acutely with ICH. Angiography showed prominent leptomeningeal and transdural anastomoses (pseudoangiomatosis). Anticardiolipin antibodies were positive. A right frontal brain biopsy failed to reveal vasculitis and a skin biopsy was nonspecific. MRI showed residual intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), diffuse atrophy, multiple small white matter infarcts and leptomeningeal enhancement. This is the first report of Sneddon's syndrome presenting with an ICH. It shares features with the Divry-van Bogaert syndrome.

Neurological examination on admission revealed no abnormalities. Computed tomography showed subarachnoid hemorrhage of the interhemispheric fissure and intraparenchymal hematoma of the left cingulate gyrus. Magnetic resonance and cerebral angiography revealed a saccular aneurysm of the distal portion of the accessory ACA classified as the bihemispheric type. Neck clipping of the aneurysm was performed via an interhemispheric approach 17 days after symptom onset. The patient made a good postoperative recovery without neurological deficit. Distal accessory ACA aneurysms tend to arise from the first bifurcation and supply parietal branches. The aneurysms tend to occur on the bihemispheric type of distal accessory ACA. Hemodynamic stress may contribute to formation or development of these aneurysms.

CD009372,0,12956271,0,Measuring tortuosity of the intracerebral vasculature from MRA images.,"The clinical recognition of abnormal vascular tortuosity, or excessive bending, twisting, and winding, is important to the diagnosis of many diseases. Automated detection and quantitation of abnormal vascular tortuosity from three-dimensional (3-D) medical image data would, therefore, be of value. However, previous research has centered primarily upon two-dimensional (2-D) analysis of the special subset of vessels whose paths are normally close to straight. This report provides the first 3-D tortuosity analysis of clusters of vessels within the normally tortuous intracerebral circulation. We define three different clinical patterns of abnormal tortuosity. We extend into 3-D two tortuosity metrics previously reported as useful in analyzing 2-D images and describe a new metric that incorporates counts of minima of total curvature. We extract vessels from MRA data, map corresponding anatomical regions between sets of normal patients and patients with known pathology, and evaluate the three tortuosity metrics for ability to detect each type of abnormality within the region of interest. We conclude that the new tortuosity metric appears to be the most effective in detecting several types of abnormalities. However, one of the other metrics, based on a sum of curvature magnitudes, may be more effective in recognizing tightly coiled, ""corkscrew"" vessels associated with malignant tumors."

CD009372,0,22377893,0,Venous ischemic syndromes.,"Venous ischemic syndromes represent a rare type of cerebrovascular disease that more commonly affects young women. Because of the remarkable variability of clinical presentations and neuroimaging signs, these syndromes represent an important clinical challenge. The most common clinical presentations include headache, seizures, focal neurological deficits, altered consciousness, and papilledema, which can present in isolation or in association with other symptoms. According to the grouping of symptoms and signs, four main patterns have been identified: isolated intracranial hypertension, focal syndrome, cavernous sinus syndrome, and subacute encephalopathy. CT scan is commonly performed as the first-line diagnostic test, in most cases showing indirect signs such as cerebral edema, ischemic or hemorrhagic lesions, or signs of venous stasis. The most accurate diagnostic techniques to objectively confirm the diagnosis include magnetic resonance angiography and computed tomography angiography. Clinical presentations and neuroimaging signs are important predictors of outcome following venous ischemic syndromes. Coma, epileptic seizures and intracranial hemorrhage were shown, among others, to be independent predictors of poor outcome."

Plain CT scan of brain confirmed the diagnosis of SAH in all the 20 (100%) cases, but was able to demonstrate the cause of SAH in 11(55%) cases only. Contrast CT scan provided additional information in 7 more cases. CT was also able to demonstrate the site and extent of bleeding, evidence of intraventricular bleeding and hydrocephalus. Cerebral angiography done in all the cases, confirmed the diagnosis in 14 (70%) cases diagnosed on CT and was able to give additional information in 4 more cases. It also showed excellent vascular details which were not possible with CT scan. It is concluded that enhanced CT scan should be done first in all the cases of SAH for preliminary scouting and angiography should be done where CT scan gives incomplete information or where surgical management is contemplated. Both the investigations were found to be complementary to each other."

CD009372,0,22566099,0,"Time-resolved angiography: Past, present, and future.","The introduction of digital subtraction angiography (DSA) in 1980 provided a method for real time 2D subtraction imaging. Later, 4D magnetic resonance (MR) angiography emerged beginning with techniques like Keyhole and time-resolved imaging of contrast kinetics (TRICKS) that provided frame rates of one every 5 seconds with limited spatial resolution. Undersampled radial acquisition was subsequently developed. The 3D vastly undersampled isotropic projection (VIPR) technique allowed undersampling factors of 30-40. Its combination with phase contrast displays time-resolved flow dynamics within the cardiac cycle and has enabled the measurement of pressure gradients in small vessels. Meanwhile similar accelerations were achieved using Cartesian acquisition with projection reconstruction (CAPR), a Cartesian acquisition with 2D parallel imaging. Further acceleration is provided by constrained reconstruction techniques such as highly constrained back-projection reconstruction (HYPR) and its derivatives, which permit acceleration factors approaching 1000. Hybrid MRA combines a separate phase contrast, time-of flight, or contrast-enhanced acquisition to constrain the reconstruction of contrast-enhanced time frames providing exceptional spatial and temporal resolution and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). This can be extended to x-ray imaging where a 3D DSA examination can be used to constrain the reconstruction of time-resolved 3D volumes. Each 4D DSA (time-resolved 3D DSA) frame provides spatial resolution and SNR comparable to 3D DSA, thus removing a major limitation of intravenous DSA. Similar techniques have provided the ability to do 4D fluoroscopy."

The hematoma was small and subcortical in one and large and putaminal in the other. They had no history of hypertension, cerebrovascular disorders, or eclampsia. Cerebral angiography studied in one case revealed no abnormalities. Idiopathic cerebral hemorrhage during delivery without any evidence of vascular risk factors is discussed."
CD009372,0,2031790,0,Radiologic manifestations of focal cerebral hyperemia in acute stroke.,In 16 acute stroke patients with focal cerebral hyperemia angiography and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) were studied 1 to 4 days post stroke. CT was performed twice with and without contrast enhancement 3 +/- 1 days and 16 +/- 4 days post stroke. Angiographic evidence of focal cerebral hyperemia was seen in 8 patients in the form of early filling veins. In 5 of these the hyperemic areas were located within infarcted areas and in 3 patients in areas which appeared normal on CT. In the remaining 8 patients the hyperemias were located perifocally around ischemic infarcts. Early filling veins were not seen in this type of hyperemia. The blood flow was higher and the transit time of the contrast medium was faster in the former type of hyperemia probably because of arteriovenous shunting. Contrast enhancement was not observed on the early CT but was typically seen in the infarcts on the late CT at a time when the hyperemic state is known to have vanished. It is concluded that focal cerebral hyperemia is not responsible for contrast enhancement on CT.
CD009372,0,18942299,0,Clinical utility of 64-row multislice CT angiography in the detection of cerebral aneurysms in acute subarachnoid haemorrhage.,"CT angiography (CTA) is a fast examination performed with a time-optimised contrast injection to enhance the cerebral arteries. Being a new imaging modality in our hospital, evaluation of the effectiveness of 64-row multislice CTA in detecting intracranial aneurysms in ruptured subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) cases is necessary. We conducted a descriptive prospective study by recruiting 30 consecutively operated SAH cases from May 2005 until November 2006. CTA findings were studied by radiologist and neurosurgeon and these were compared with operative findings. The sensitivity and specificity of CTA were 94.4% and 97.2% respectively. Approximately half of the patients were scanned within four hours and operated within 24 hours. In conclusion, CTA proves to be highly sensitive and specific in the diagnosis of intracranial aneurysms in our study."
CD009372,0,3300046,0,[A hierarchy of findings within the scope of cerebrovascular diagnosis today].,"Table 5 gives an overview as to the timing and indication for diagnostic methods and procedures in cerebro-vascular diseases. Anamnesis and clinical aspects have still leading position. After that, computer-tomography stands first in the diagnostic line, followed by angiography, indicated in the acute phase only in progressive stroke. More often it is used during rehabilitation period for indication towards extra-intracranial anastomosis. Sonography gives informations specially in the extracranial stenoses by duplex sonography. The EEG is still necessary in the early stage and for follow-ups. Cerebro spinal fluid analysis, intern medicine (mainly cardiology) examinations, give extra information and should not be skipped. Psychological exams and intracranial bloodflow-studies are used during rehabilitation. Digital angiography, with the possibility of postprocessing, is in comparison to conventional angiography, less invasive. Nuclear-magnetic-resonance with its fast development is taking now place in the clinical field. Cerebro-vascular patients should be treated in specialized centers where beside the equipment, an experienced team is available, which has required its knowledge on a high number of cases and where the cooperation between the different fields of conservative (intern and neurology) radiology and surgery is guaranteed. This paper however has tried to show the up-to-date-guidelines to the other medical specialties that handle cerebrovascular patients."

CD009372,0,7121818,0,NMR imaging of the brain.,"The basic features of an NMR imaging system are outlined and three pulse sequences which produce images with varying dependence on proton density T1 and T2 are described. The first of these sequences, Repeated Free Induction Decay produces images which demonstrate changes in proton density as well as flow effects. The second sequence, Inversion-recovery, produces images which are dependent on T1 and show a high level of grey, white matter contrast giving considerable anatomical detail. In addition pathological processes such as infarction, haemorrhages, demyelination and malignancy, produce changes in T1 enabling lesions to be localised. The third sequence, Spin-echo, produces images which are dependent on T2. These show very little grey, white matter contrast but demonstrate acute and space occupying lesions as well as cerebral oedema. The high level of grey, white matter contrast, lack of bone artefact, variety of sequences, capacity for multiplanar imaging, sensitivity to pathological change and lack of known hazard make NMR an important addition to existing techniques of neurological diagnosis."

A 57-year-old man had complained headache in the morning. Six hours later he was found unconsciousness and soon he was brought to our hospital. On admission he was comatose. There was no evidences of head injury and the X-rays were normal. A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed an acute subdural hematoma over the left temporoparietal region. Laboratory data revealed thrombocytosis of 85.7 x 10(4)/mm3 with increased red and white blood cell counts. Emergent right craniotomy was performed and a subdural clot was evacuated. Neither cortical damage nor vascular malformations were seen on the cortical surface. But a spurting cortical artery with a pin-hole could be seen. A postoperative CT scan revealed an intracerebral hemorrhage deep in the right hemisphere. Cerebral angiograms revealed no vascular anomalies. Postoperatively, the platelet count remained high and laboratory data including bone marrow finding, neutrophil alkali-phosphatase score and chromosome analysis were consistent with the diagnosis of essential thrombocythemia. The mechanisms of subdural hematoma formation and postoperative intracerebral hemorrhage associated with essential thrombocythemia were discussed."
CD009372,0,22162092,0,Correction for arterial-tissue delay and dispersion in absolute quantitative cerebral perfusion DSC MR imaging.,"The singular value decomposition deconvolution of cerebral tissue concentration-time curves with the arterial input function is commonly used in dynamic susceptibility contrast cerebral perfusion MR imaging. However, it is sensitive to the time discrepancy between the arrival of the bolus in the tissue concentration-time curve and the arterial input function signal. This normally causes inaccuracy in the quantitative perfusion maps due to delay and dispersion effects. A comprehensive correction algorithm has been achieved through slice-dependent time-shifting of the arterial input function, and a delay-dependent dispersion correction model. The correction algorithm was tested in 11 healthy subjects and three ischemic stroke patients scanned with a quantitative perfusion pulse sequence at 1.5 T. A validation study was performed on five patients with confirmed cerebrovascular occlusive disease scanned with MRI and positron emission tomography at 3.0 T. A significant effect (P < 0.05) was reported on the quantitative cerebral blood flow and mean transit time measurements (up to 50%). There was no statistically significant effect on the quantitative cerebral blood volume values. The in vivo results were in agreement with the simulation results, as well as previous literature. This minimizes the bias in patient diagnosis due to the existing errors and artifacts in dynamic susceptibility contrast imaging."

CD009372,0,12741100,0,[Cerebral metastasis in choriocarcinoma a case report].,"Choriocarcinoma are malignant neoplastic tumors from the trophoblastic tissue with a tendency to early metastases. Beside pulmonary metastases there are often cerebral metastases, leading to intracerebral hemorrhage often responsible for the first clinical symptoms. In young women, symptoms like vaginal or pulmonary bleeding or neurologic disturbances shortly after a hydatiform mole or a normal pregnancy, accompanied by high levels of HCG in serum and CSF, choriocarcinoma should be considered. Choriocarcinoma are very sensitive to chemotherapy, which consists--depending on the stage of the disease--of a mono- or polychemotherapy. Cure rates are high, even in extended stages with cerebral metastases--as in the case described. Brain metastases with or without oncotic aneurysms can be rapidly controlled by immediate whole brain irradiation. Surgical interventions may be necessary in the case of life threatening bleedings. Levels of HCG in serum and cerebrospinal fluid are good markers to control the effect of therapy. But--as shown in this patient--levels of HCG in CSF may decrease protracted without affecting prognosis. Oncotic aneurysms are rarely reported and mostly detected post mortem. The presented case leads to a more optimistic attitude and demonstrates efficacy of immediately started radio- and chemotherapy."

The aetiology of these circumscribed disorders of neuronal migration is often unknown although in some instances proximity to areas of prenatal infarction suggests that severe ischaemia was responsible. A patient is described with intractable complex partial seizures associated with heterotopic grey matter and cerebral hypoplasia confined to the territory of the left posterior cerebral artery; the left hippocampus was spared.

She had been treated with anticonvulsant medication under a diagnosis of left mesial temporal sclerosis based on magnetic resonance imaging findings. Cerebral angiography on admission revealed occlusion of the P(2) segment of the left posterior cerebral artery (PCA) and extravasation of contrast medium during the procedure. The patient underwent left temporal lobectomy including the lesioned mesial temporal cortex, and the ruptured P(2) segment of the PCA was removed as well. The operative finding of the ruptured aneurysm was pseudoaneurysm. Histological examination of the resected PCA segment demonstrated a pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma invading the outer wall of the PCA. Presumably the bleeding was caused by the rupture of a pseudoaneurysm secondary to leptomeningeal involvement of this typically benign tumor."

For this purpose we compared retrospectively MRI data with digitized subtraction angiography (DSA) data in a group of 50 patients focusing onto the watershed area of the carotid artery vascular territories. In order to evaluate the presence of white matter lesions (WML) in the hemispheric watershed areas, coronal fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery or axial T2 weighted MRI images of patients with symptomatic cerebrovascular insufficiency areas were compared with the capillary phase of DSA studies in anterior-posterior projection. Presence of cerebrovascular occlusive disease was evaluated on DSA using North American symptomatic carotid endarterectomy trial criteria and including evaluation of collateral vascular supply. Pathological MRI findings in the region of the watershed territories correlated overall in 66% of cases with a defect or delayed filling on DSA. In the case of asymmetrical MRI findings, there was a pathological finding of the capillary phase in the watershed area in 92% of DSA studies. Hypoperfusion in the capillary phase of the watershed area as seen on DSA correlated with the stenosis degree of the concerned carotid artery. Our findings suggest that asymmetrical findings of WML in the watershed areas as seen on MRI are caused by hemodynamic effect and a differentiation between small vessel disease and a consequence of distant stenosis may be possible under such conditions."

CD009372,0,23269051,0,Simultaneous presentation of two cerebral aneurysms.,"A 48-year-old woman experienced sudden onset of severe headache. Computed tomography showed subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and intracerebral hematoma in the right frontal lobe. Digital subtraction angiography revealed three aneurysms in the anterior communicating artery (AcomA), the right posterior communicating artery (PcomA), and the right middle cerebral artery. The AcomA aneurysm was treated with endovascular coiling. However, her oculomotor nerve palsy was aggravated after the procedure. Embolization of the right PcomA aneurysm was conducted immediately and her oculomotor nerve palsy recovered completely 3 months later. Simultaneous presentation of multiple aneurysms with separate symptoms is rare. We speculate that the progressive oculomotor nerve palsy was caused by tiny enlargement or morphological change of the aneurysm caused by elevated blood pressure and pulsatile effect after SAH."

Aneurysms associated with PAN are common in visceral arteries, however, intracranial aneurysms are rare, especially in childhood. A pediatric patient with PAN developed serial hemorrhagic strokes from a ruptured superior cerebellar artery aneurysm (subarachnoid hemorrhage) and a de novo aneurysm of the frontoorbital artery (intracerebral hemorrhage) after 9 months.

We looked at these aspects in a collaborative study. We reviewed 13 patients diagnosed as having a dissecting aneurysm of the MCA based on clinical signs and neuroradiological findings in 46 stroke centres between 1995 and 1999. There were four patients who presented with cerebral ischaemia, and nine who presented with bleeding. Of the former group, three were aged less than 15 years. Cerebral angiography showed extensive stenosis and a double lumen of the M1 portion in all four patients. High signal on T1-weighted images around the arterial flow void, due to intramural haematoma, was often seen in the second week. MR angiography showed findings corresponding those of intra-arterial angiography in all four cases. We saw an infarct on CT or MRI in territory of the perforating branches of the M1 segment in all four patients. In the patients presenting with bleeding, pure subarachnoid haemorrhage or a sylvian fissure haematoma was seen on initial CT, and the predominant angiographic finding was dilatation with stenosis, but the site of the lesions was not uniform. A double lumen or intimal flap was seen in about half the cases. Rebleeding occurred within 14 days of the onset in five of the nine patients, with a poor prognosis."
CD009372,0,8866075,0,Non-invasive testing for cerebrovascular disease.,"Selecting the appropriate investigation for diagnosing occlusive cerebrovascular disease depends on the availability, cost, accuracy, invasiveness and the purpose of the test. Intraarterial digital subtraction angiography remains the gold standard, but for accuracy the stenosis should be measured rather than estimated. Duplex ultrasonography is almost as accurate and can additionally analyse plaque morphology. Of 2651 duplex tests carried out in our laboratory, 12.2% were for reversible ischaemic attacks, 2.7% for amaurosis, 12.1% for cervical bruit and 4.3% for vertebrobasilar ischaemia. Duplex within 30 days of operation was carried out on 607 patients (22.9%) and surveillance on 1000 others (37.7%). Asymptomatic carotid stenosis > 60% should be confirmed by intra-arterial digital subtraction angiography, magnetic resonance angiography or spiral computed tomography angiography. For typical transient ischaemic attacks, duplex or angiography alone is adequate but when the clinical presentation is atypical, a confirming test is required. Routine preoperative brain computed tomography is not cost-effective, being equivalent to US$ 4300-11840 per perioperative stroke in our institution. Postoperative surveillance is justified, costing only US$ 505 per patient over 4 years."

These cases comprise 2.0% of 1202 cases of hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage diagnosed by computed tomography and experienced from 1976 through 1987. Thirteen patients were male and 11 were female. Their average age was 61 years. Headache (67%) and nausea and vomiting (50%), which were often the initial symptoms, were similar to those of subarachnoid hemorrhage. The main clinical symptoms were signs of meningeal irritation. Ten patients (42%) had transient disturbance of consciousness, and nine (38%) of these were somnolent; only one patient, who had a massive hematoma, was stuporous. When the hematoma extended to the internal capsule, the patient showed motor disturbance (38%). Two patients (8%) had Horner's sign, five (21%) exhibited diminished activity, and one (4%) suffered anosognosia. The volume of the intracerebral hematoma averaged 4.7 ml and was less than 5 ml in 17 patients (71%). In 20 patients (83%), the hematoma was confined to the head of the caudate nucleus. The hemorrhage tended to rupture into the anterior horn of the lateral ventricle, and in nearly all cases (96%), intraventricular hematoma was observed. Seventeen patients (71%) underwent cerebral angiography. There were no instances of dilation of the recurrent artery of Heubner. Twenty patients (83%) were treated conservatively. Continuous ventricular drainage was employed in four patients (17%), and ventriculoperitoneal shunting in three (13%). However, it was judged retrospectively that continuous ventricular drainage had been necessary in only two cases in which disturbance of consciousness was progressed due to acute hydrocephalus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Effect of recanalization and/or collateral circulation on the lesion and prognosis.,"Findings of computed tomography (CT) and angiography in supratentorial cerebral infarction associated with complete stroke were compared with regard to prognosis. It was found that the extent of low-density areas on CT was perfectly in accordance with the areas of occluded arteries on angiograms. However, the low-density areas on CT were always smaller than the areas involved angiographically when early recanalization and/or collateral circulation were carried out within 2 to 3 days of onset. It was also found that smaller low-density areas only had favorable effect. We concluded that the prognosis was better with early recanalization and/or collateral circulation, despite the general acceptance of its poor prognostic implication."

Venous drainage flows either through superficial leptomeningeal veins or through the sphenoparietal, sphenopetrous and/or sphenobasilar sinuses. They often have an aggressive course and therefore poor outcome. It is essential to analyse and understand the angioarchitecture of the dural arteriovenous malformations in order to select and plan the correct treatments.

Intravenous DSA (IV-DSA) is still an accurate screening technique for extracranial carotid atherosclerosis, comparable to duplex ultrasound. Intracranial imaging is less satisfying with intravenous injections but reliable information is available in the assessment of the venous sinuses and parasellar internal arteries. The future of DSA lies with intraarterial contrast injections, as this technique substantially decreases the risks and costs of definitive cerebrovascular investigation."

CD009372,0,19811796,0,[Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome].,"Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS) is characterized by severe headaches, as well as vasoconstriction of cerebral arteries, which resolves spontaneously in one to three months. This condition has a moderate female preponderance. The mean age of onset is around 45 years. About 60% of the cases are secondary, mainly occurring during postpartum and/or after exposure to vasoactive substances. The main clinical presentation includes multiple recurrent thunderclap headaches over one to three weeks. The major complications of RCVS are localized cortical subarachnoid hemorrhages (cSAH) (20-25%) and parenchymal strokes (5-10%). Complications occur with different time courses: hemorrhages (cSAH and intracerebral hemorrhages), and posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome are early events occurring during the first week, while ischemic events including TIAs and cerebral infarcts occur significantly later, during the second week. Diagnosis requires the demonstration of the ""string and beads"" aspect of cerebral arteries by a cerebral angiogram (MRA, CTA or conventional) and the demonstration of the complete or marked normalisation of arteries by a repeat angiogram performed within 12 weeks of onset. Treatment is based on nimodipine that seems to reduce thunderclap headaches within 48h. However, nimodipine has not proven any efficacy against the hemorrhagic and ischemic complications of RCVS. Relapses are possible but rare and have not been reported yet in prospective series. It seems appropriate to advise the patients to avoid sympathomimetic and serotoninergic substances."

CD009372,0,1240606,0,[Diagnostic value of isocount scanning in cerebrovascular diseases (author's transl)].,"In the previous report the theoretical background and technical details of the isocount scanning were described. Based on clinical experiences of various brain diseases, the newly developed scanning method was confirmed to be more useful than the conventional scintiscanning. Besides the new scanning method, a new display system was also developed for the sake of more precise analysis of the isocount scanned data. This display method is called multilevel analysis or multilevel slicing of the scanned data. In the present investigation, this method was applied to thirty-two cases of cerebrovascular diseases, including seven cases of cerebral arterio-venous malformation, four cases of hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage and twenty-one cases of cerebral infarction, positive rates being 86%, 100% and 90% respectively. In case of arterio-venous malformation, minimum size detected by the isocount method was 2 cm in diameter. To twenty one cases of the cerebral infarction, total thirty two scanning examinations were performed, including postictal follow up studies. It is often said that it is two or three weeks after the ictus when the infarcted cerebral lesion is most clearly detectable by the scintigraphic procedures, presumably due to focal neovascularizations which may occur in the lesion most prominently at this postictal stage. Contradicted to the current concept, our experiences show that abnormal dot accumulations are recognized in the scintigrams even at the earlier stage, thus among five cases of cerebral infarction scanned within a week after the ictus positive figures were obtained in four cases, two of which were examined within two days after the ictus. Focal breakdown of blood brain barrier at the acute stage is considered to be responsible for the early positivity in cerebral infarctions. In eight cases among twenty one cerebral infarctions angiographies failed to demonstrate the vessel occluded. The isocount scanning method, however, succeeded in getting positive results in seven of the eight cases. It will be emphasized that the isocount scanning is a preferable diagnostic procedure in the cerebrovascular diseases, especially when the angiography is hesitated to be performed because of the patient severely affected."

From January 29th 1990 through March 31st 1992, 1,587 subjects underwent ECD out of 16,379 subjects that participated in the first level investigations. 404 of these (25.5%) were affected with carotid occlusive disease, 271 (17%) had inframural non stenosing carotid lesions and 228 (14.3%) carotid kinkings. At ECD, 71 showed lesions as severe as to be susceptible of surgical operation and underwent ADA. The percentage of carotid stenosis was calculated on the ADA imagins, applying the method suggested by the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial. RESULTS. Overall sensitivity and specificity of ECD versus ADA were 94% and 95.2% respectively. Cases in which ECD overestimated the lesion as compared to ADA results were recorded as false positive, while cases in which ECD underestimated the lesion were recorded as false negative. CONCLUSIONS. Both ultrasound imaging and ADA are useful in screening programs for carotid occlusive disease: informations different and complementary to the definition of the lesions can be obtained from each procedures in subsequent phases. Morphologic findings of carotid ECD are essentially consistent with ADA, thus allowing to carry on safely non invasive long-term follow-up programs for operated subjects as well as for people bearing carotid lesions originally not susceptible of surgical treatment."

Eighty-five patients with ischemic symptoms, decreased regional cerebral blood flow, and decreased regional cerebrovascular reactivity were recruited for surgery. The post-bypass mean regional blood flow increased by 35.8% compared to the pre-bypass value (p<0.001). Only minor re-establishment of vasculature after anastomosis was detected in three of four patients with middle cerebral artery stenosis, which suggests that there are fewer benefits of bypass surgery in this situation. Cerebral infarction occurred immediately post-operation in one patient who was predisposed to stroke due to a bilateral carotid occlusion. Hyperperfusion injury was infrequent in this series; only one patient developed intracerebral hemorrhage three weeks after the bypass. One ischemic and one hemorrhagic stroke occurred during the 90 months following surgery."

Two groups of patients were identified: (a) those suffering from a spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage (16 cases); (b) those suffering from an ischemic stroke (10 cases). Of those with spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage, 10 patients underwent surgery and evacuation of the hematoma. In 2 cases the hematoma was located in the posterior fossa, in 1 case in the upper brain stem, and in 3 cases in the basal ganglia; in the remainder the hematoma was supratentorial. Two patients died soon after the hemorrhage. Eight of the surviving patients completely recovered. In those with ischemic stroke, none suffered from congenital heart disease, a well-known predisposing factor. In this second group 1 patient died and 9 survived. Only one patient showed complete recovery. The data indicate that a hemorrhagic stroke is more common than an ischemic stroke in a child presenting with acute onset of hemiparesis and/or loss of consciousness: thus the value of CT scan as the first diagnostic procedure is clear, owing to the possibility of emergency surgical treatment. In children with ischemic strokes, a complete laboratory/clinical evaluation should be undertaken in order to exclude preexisting heart disease, coagulation disorders or lipoprotein abnormalities, and less common systemic diseases."
CD009372,0,9474281,0,Magnetic resonance angiography demonstration of an angiographically occult anterior communicating artery aneurysm.,"In almost one in six patients with spontaneous subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) no lesion responsible for the bleed will be found by cerebral angiography. Current management strategies include repeat cerebral angiography after a period of 1-8 weeks during which a number of these patients will rebleed with considerable morbidity and even mortality. We report the case of a young female patient with spontaneous subarachnoid haemorrhage. Brain computed tomography (CT) demonstrated blood mainly in the basal frontal interhemispheric fissure suggesting the presence of an anterior communicating artery (ACoA) aneurysm. Cerebral angiography was negative. Magnetic resonance (MR) angiography performed the same day showed a small aneurysm arising from the posterior wall of the ACoA. This was confirmed at surgery. It is suggested that MR angiography, guided by the CT findings, probably has a place in the management of patients with SAH of ""unknown aetiology"" before repeat catheter angiography is undertaken."

The first patient was a 63-year-old man who presented with headaches. Magnetic resonance venography was performed and suggested dural sinus thrombosis of the left transverse sinus and jugular vein. He was administered warfarin anticoagulation therapy but then suffered multiple intracranial hemorrhages. A DS angiogram was requested for a possible dural sinus thrombectomy, but the DS angiogram revealed a DAVF. The patient underwent serial liquid embolization with complete obliteration of the DAVF. The second patient, an 11-year-old boy, also presented with headaches and was diagnosed with dural sinus thrombosis on MR imaging. A DS angiogram was also requested for a possible thrombectomy and revealed a DAVF. This patient underwent serial liquid embolization and eventual operative resection. These reports emphasize that different venous flow abnormalities can appear similar on noninvasive imaging and that proper diagnosis is critical to avoid contraindicated therapies."

A similar headache in the absence of subarachnoid blood has rarely been ascribed to an unruptured cerebral aneurysm, but may result from acute aneurysm expansion and indicate a high risk of future rupture. We present a patient who developed a sudden, severe, ""thunderclap"" headache, with no associated neurological deficit. Computed tomogram and lumbar cerebral spinal fluid obtained 5.5 hours after headache onset were negative for subarachnoid hemorrhage. The patient underwent cerebral angiography which revealed a posterior communicating artery aneurysm with an associated daughter aneurysm. Craniotomy and clip obliteration of the aneurysm were performed. The aneurysm dome was very thin and there was no evidence of recent or old hemorrhage. A ""thunderclap"" headache without subarachnoid hemorrhage may be an important harbinger of a cerebral aneurysm with the potential for future rupture.

CD009372,0,458892,0,Intracranial pressure monitoring in the acute neurologic assessment of multi-injured patients.,"The trauma victim with a severe closed head injury, who requires general anesthesia for emergency repair of concomitant exigent major injuries, poses a clinical dilemma. During general anesthesia and during the immediate postoperative period, the status of the patient's central nervous system cannot be clinically monitored, and emergency cerebral arteriograms and/or CAT scans are not easily obtained. Under these circumstances, delays in the diagnosis of intracranial blood accumulations frequently occur, and occult cerebral edema often goes untreated. In an attempt to avoid these management problems, we have employed intraoperative intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring in such patients, using a subarachnoid screw. Following placement of this screw, several clinical courses may occur: 1) The patient maintains a normal pressure; thus a significant mass lesion and/or cerebral edema requiring decompression is unlikely. 2) The patient's ICP is elevated but controlled by medical management. 3) The patient's ICP cannot be controlled below 20 to 25 mm Hg using medical management, and exploratory burr holes are made. 4) If intracranial blood is encountered during placement of the ICP monitor, immediate exploratory craniotomy is indicated."

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the brain showed dilated cerebellar veins and T2WI hypersignal in the basal ganglia without WMCs. After admission, he suffered sequential bilateral deep intracerebral hemorrhages. A repeated angioMRI disclosed thrombosis of the distal sagittal and the proximal lateral sinuses. Angiography revealed a torcullar region DAVF. Embolization of the dural fistula was performed. On follow-up, the patients' cognitive deficits improved and myoclonus disappeared.

In the first group, vertebrobasilar ischemic disease could be reasonably excluded. In the second, such disease was nearly certain. In the third group, the vertebrobasilar system could not readily be assessed by the MRA alone and often required further studies.

CD009372,0,12452904,0,Dural sinus thrombosis presenting as unilateral lobar haematomas with mass effect: an easily misdiagnosed cause of cerebral haemorrhage.,"Dural sinus thrombosis has protean clinical and radiological manifestations ranging from minimal effacement of sulci with no symptoms to severe haemorrhagic infarcts associated with focal deficits, coma and even death. An uncommon form of presentation is characterized by unilateral lobar haemorrhage associated with extensive oedema and parenchymal distortion. In an acute presentation, this might resemble haemorrhage into a tumour. In delayed presentations, the haematoma, being iso- or hypodense and showing peripheral ring-like enhancement, can mimic aggressive tumours or infective processes. As this is an uncommon condition, misdiagnosis is common with the potential for mismanagement and adverse outcomes. We present five such consecutive cases that were initially misdiagnosed as other entities. Each of these cases on closer inspection show features observed on CT and MRI that should have suggested a diagnosis of dural venous sinus thrombosis. One of these cases progressed to not only extensively involve the superficial sinuses but also the deep veins, with a significant adverse outcome. The imaging features of this interesting variant of dural sinus thrombosis are reviewed. The haemodynamic basis for haemorrhage and anatomical basis for the lateralization of the lesions are discussed."
CD009372,0,21273741,0,Cortical subarachnoid hemorrhage caused by cerebral venous thrombosis.,"Patients with non-traumatic, non-aneurysmal, and non-perimesencephalic subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) tend to have clots circumscribed along the cortical convexity, a condition referred to as acute cortical SAH. Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) is a potential cause of cortical SAH. The study tried to establish the diagnosis and management of cortical SAH caused by CVT. Retrospective review of 145 patients with non-traumatic SAH identified 15 patients with no ruptured aneurysm. Clinical features were investigated with a specific focus on patients with SAH caused by CVT. Eight of the 15 patients had perimesencephalic SAH, and 7 had cortical SAH. SAH caused by CVT was diagnosed in 4 of the 7 patients with cortical SAH. The cortical SAH involved the unilateral convexity or sylvian cistern and spared the basal cistern on computed tomography in all 4 patients. CVT occurred in the transverse sinus and cortical vein (1 patient), insular vein (1 patient), and cortical vein (2 patients). Identification of thrombosed veins or sinuses was established directly by T(2)*-weighted and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in the acute stage and diffusion-weighted and T(1)-weighted MR imaging in the subacute stage. All patients had cortical swelling without findings of venous hemorrhagic infarction on T(2)*-weighted MR imaging. None of the 4 patients received active treatment, and all had favorable outcomes. CVT in patients with non-traumatic cortical SAH should be first excluded as a potential hemorrhagic cause by MR imaging for thrombosed veins or sinuses before initiating antifibrinolytic therapy."
CD009372,0,14669061,0,Radiological approach to disorders of arterial brain vessels associated with childhood arterial stroke-a comparison between MRA and contrast angiography.,"Recent studies of arterial ischaemic stroke in children have emphasised the higher frequency of cerebral arterial abnormalities than believed previously, explaining some of the strokes thought to have been idiopathic. Moreover, recurrent strokes are significantly more frequent in children with multiple risk factors, including those with demonstrable vascular abnormalities. Thus, cerebral arterial imaging is essential for the understanding and therapeutic approach to this pathology. Contrast angiography (CA) is the reference examination for the diagnosis of cerebral arterial abnormalities, but MR angiography (MRA) is a sensitive and non-invasive method to evaluate the vasculopathy of childhood stroke. In this article we highlight recent data concerning localisation and characterisation of arterial lesions and discuss the yield of MRA compared with CA."
CD009372,0,6640454,0,Carotid Doppler evaluation in cerebrovascular disease.,"The Doppler technique has proven to be a useful noninvasive technique for evaluating the patency of the carotid artery in patients at risk of stroke. The data obtained from 246 carotid Doppler examinations were compared with the angiographic findings in the same patients. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were high when the degree of stenosis was greater than 50%, but occlusions were less reliably detected, with 8 (33%) of the 24 being misdiagnosed as high-grade stenoses. Carotid Doppler evaluation guides and accelerates decisions regarding further investigations, such as cerebral angiography. It helps one decide whether a neck bruit is of arterial origin and aids assessment following cerebrovascular surgery. It is not a substitute for cerebral angiography because it poorly visualizes both the posterior and the intracranial circulations and cannot accurately detect low-grade (less than 50%) stenoses or ulcerated arterial plaques. Detection of stenosis in a carotid artery in an otherwise uncertain case is an indication for cerebral angiography, so the Doppler technique will probably increase the number of angiograms performed. However, this technique is also useful in follow-up, being without hazard, and should, therefore, reduce the likelihood of unnecessary angiographic examinations."

In selected patients, however, cerebral angiography in place of, or along with, computed tomography may be necessary to demonstrate an underlying cause for the subdural hematoma."
CD009372,0,7565039,0,[Dolichoectatic intracranial arteries. Advances in images and therapeutics].,"Dolichoectasia of intracranial arteries is an infrequent disease with an incidence less than 0.05% in general population. It represents 7% of all intracranial aneurysms. Commonly seen in middle age patients with severe atherosclerosis and hypertension, the affected arteries include the basilar artery, supraclinoid segment of the internal carotid artery, middle, anterior and posterior cerebral arteries; males are more frequently affected. The clinical features of these fusiform aneurysms are divided in three categories: ische-mic, cranial nerve compression and signs from mass effect. Hemorrhage may also occur. Nine patients with symptomatic cerebral blood vessel dolichoectasias are presented. Six of them were males with moderate or severe hypertension. Lesions were confined to the basilar artery in 3 cases, carotid arteries and the middle cerebral artery in 1 case, and both systems were affected in 4 patients. Middle cerebral arteries were affected in 5 cases and the anterior cerebral artery in one. An isolated fusiform aneurysm of the posterior cerebral artery is also presented (case 8) (Table 3). Motor or sensory deficits, ataxia, dementia, hemifacial spasm and parkinsonism were observed. One patient died from cerebro-meningeal hemorrhage (Table 2). All patients were studied with computerized axial tomography of the brain, 5 cases with four vessel cerebral angiography, 4 cases with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and case 5 with MRI angiography. Clinical symptoms depend on the affected vascular territory, size of the aneurysm and compression of adjacent structures. The histopathologic findings are atheromatous lesions, disruption of the internal elastic membrane and fibrosis of the muscular wall. The resultant is a diffuse deficiency of the muscular wall and the internal elastic membrane. Recent advances in neuroimaging such as better resolution of CT scan, magnetic resonance images (MRI) and MRI angiography increased the diagnosis of this pathology showing clearly the affected vessels. This avoids the use of conventional or digital subtraction angiography, reserved only for diagnosing suspected saccular aneurysm, evidence of subarachnoid hemorrhage or planning surgical treatment. The treatment of this entity may be medical or surgical. There is evidence suggesting a more favorable outcome with anticoagulation therapy, although antiaggregation is a reasonable alternative. In our experience no difference in clinical outcome was evident. Surgical treatment of this type of aneurysm includes intra- or extracranial occlusion of parent artery, clipping or aneurysm trapping, tourniquet occlusion, and circumferential wrapping with clip reinforcement. Endovascular occlusion has been accomplished with detachable balloon technique or coils. No surgical attempt was done in our cases. The prognosis is variable depending on the patients age, vessels involved and clinical complications.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

However, traumatic aneurysms can rupture at any time after the injury, and the mortality resulting from a second hemorrhage is unacceptably high. A prospective study was undertaken in which 330 patients with penetrating stab wounds to the head underwent angiography as soon as possible after admission. In 250 of these patients (76%), the weapon had already been removed by the assailant, and there was radiological evidence of penetration of the dura. Of these 250, 130 patients underwent angiography within 7 days of the injury. Another 51 patients, who presented late, underwent angiography more than 7 days after the injury. The timing of angiography did not affect the identification of traumatic aneurysms, the incidence of which was 12% in both groups. Of the patients with cranial stabs and who required urgent evacuation of intracerebral hematomas, 10% had traumatic aneurysms that could be dealt with simultaneously. No patient in this series suffered a secondary hemorrhage. We conclude that it is neither necessary nor safe to delay angiography. In some patients, either because of vasospasm or ""cut-off"" of a vessel, a second angiogram may be necessary to further elucidate a vascular abnormality that might not have been evident originally."
CD009372,0,2181079,0,Neurological deterioration in a patient with a spinal arteriovenous malformation following lumbar puncture. Case report.,"The mechanism of nonhemorrhagic neurological deterioration from spinal arteriovenous malformation (AVM) and the role of acute surgical intervention in this setting are not well understood. The case is described of a 65-year-old man who presented with a 2-year history of mild gait spasticity and vague sensory complaints affecting both lower extremities. Following a diagnostic lumbar puncture, these symptoms progressed painlessly over a 4-day period to total motor paraplegia, urinary retention, and hypesthesia in all modalities with a midthoracic sensory level. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a probable spinal AVM but no evidence of hemorrhage or cord compression. Spinal angiography confirmed the diagnosis of spinal AVM fed by radicular branches of left T-7 and T-8 segmental intercostal arteries. Drainage was via long dorsal veins caudally. Emergency laminectomy with intradural exploration was performed. There was no evidence of prior hemorrhage or focal mass effect, although the cerebrospinal fluid pressure was elevated. The dural component of the spinal AVM was excised, and its communications with the spinal cord were disconnected intradurally. Neurological function started improving within 6 hours of the patient awakening from anesthesia. He had achieved antigravity strength in every muscle group of the lower extremities by the time of discharge to a rehabilitation center 10 days after surgery. Three months postoperatively, he was ambulating with a walker and was continent of urine and stool. Possible pathophysiological mechanisms are discussed in light of the favorable response to timely surgical intervention."

CD009372,0,8004740,0,Cerebral arteriovenous malformations in children.,"The treatment of cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVM) or vascular anomalies are challenging neurosurgical procedures for an anaesthetist. Large AVMs are uncommon in children. Only 18% of AVMs become symptomatic before the age of 15 yr. This series reviews the experience at this institution during the period of 1982 to 1992. The symptoms at the time of presentation are varied and include haemorrhage (50%), seizures and hydrocephalus (36%) or congestive cardiac failure (18%). Symptoms of congestive heart failure predominate in the newborn whilst neurological symptoms, such as stroke, seizures or hydrocephalus occur more commonly in infants and older children. Approximately one third of AVMs in childhood present acutely. Radiological investigations, e.g., CT scan, MRI and cerebral angiography are essential to identify the precise location of the lesion. Therapeutic intervention in the acute presentation may involve craniotomy for evacuation of haematoma and treatment of increased intracranial pressure (ICP). Control of seizures and congestive heart failure may take priority and allow time to plan the elective procedures of embolization and surgical excision of the AVM. Operative intervention is hazardous and peroperative complications can be expected in more than 50% of patients. The morbidity and mortality associated with cerebral AVM are high, especially in infants who present in the neonatal period with congestive cardiac failure. The overall mortality in this series was 20%. Children presenting with intracranial arteriovenous malformations require a multidisciplinary approach. The successful management of anaesthesia either for embolization or surgical resection necessitates an understanding of the disciplines of paediatric and neuroanaesthesia. Special care and specific attention to detail may contribute to reduce the high morbidity and mortality encountered in these compromised children."

Brain computed tomography (CT) revealed a clot dominantly on the right (Fisher's classification Group 4). Cerebral angiography showed funnel-shaped widenings at the origins of the bilateral posterior communicating arteries. The maximum diameter of the widening was greater than 3 mm, so this widening was called an enlarged infundibular widening. Angiography showed a small bulge protruding posterolaterally from the wall of the right enlarged infundibular widening, and the right posterior communicating artery arose from the apex of the enlarged infundibular widening. Based on the findings of the brain CT and cerebral angiography, the diagnosis was SAH due to rupture of the right enlarged infundibular widening. Approximately 12 hours after the onset, the clot was evacuated through the right pterional approach. Bleeding from the small bulge of the right enlarged infundibular widening occurred intraoperatively, so a right-angled ring clip was applied parallel to the right internal carotid artery to obliterate the rupture point. Postoperatively, she was discharged without neurological deficit, and follow-up CT showed no other new infarction. We recommend clipping rather than wrapping or coating for similar cases of ruptured enlarged infundibular widening."

Distension and enlargement of the cavum septi pellucidi (CSP) and cavum vergae (CV), along with hydrocephalus, was detected during the course of the disease and was observed to regress together with resolution of the venous occlusion. Venous hypertension caused by sinus occlusion was thought to be responsible for the disturbed resorption of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the CSP and CV in this patient.

CD009372,0,8652145,0,"Acute neuroradiology: methods, indications and timing.","The rapid development of radiological examination methods, technical innovations and creative and critical radiological research have dramatically changed the diagnostic approach with new indications and changed timing in the examination of patients with acute neurological lesions. The role of CT as the primary radiological examination method in these patients is well established, and is routinely used before the start of suitable treatment to detect or exclude intracranial haemorrhage, either traumatic or nontraumatic, or to detect other causes of acute onset of neurological disease, such as intracerebral tumours or subdural haematoma. The role of MRI still needs further confirmation. The sensitivity of MRI is superior to that of CT, especially in examination of the spinal cord. The main drawbacks of MRI are the problems in monitoring acutely ill patients, the unfamiliarity with the method, and capacity problems. Today, MRI is mainly used as a complement to CT, with the exception of spine injuries where MRI is the method of first choice. Also, the role of digital subtraction angiography is changing from diagnostic examinations towards endovascular therapeutic procedures. An experienced neuroradiologist has the key position in choosing and performing the most suitable examination method for each specific indication."

CD009372,0,122463,0,[Acute disease pictures of cerebrovascular origin in childhood].,"To summarize it can be said that an analysis of 1080 cerebral angiographies of children and juveniles up to 16 years of age and an examination of clinical results obtained for a stock of unsifted pediatric and neurosurgical patients allowed as many as 145 cases of vascular processes to be detected in children and juveniles. This number appears to be relatively large even if we consider that we are concerned here with a selected patient stock of a supraregional specialized clinic. If we also consider that the number of angiographies presently performed in cases of vascular disease processes is still comparatively small and that patients have to wait indiscussibly long times before being finally angiographed, then it is obvious that many a vascular disease process still goes undetected or is either misinterpreted or made clear at too late a time. It is here that much remains to be done in order to provide the necessary material basis, for what we still lack is the necessary number of costly diagnostic facilities with highly qualified diagnosticians as well as the necessary follow-up facilities such as, for example, neurosurgical, vasculosurgical, and intensive care units. We therefore welcome recent improvements in this direction, especially since the realization of a large-scale project would make possible an optimum diagnosis and treatment of vascular disease processes in both children and juveniles."
CD009372,0,11720332,0,Three-dimensional image display without special eyeglasses: observation of magnetic resonance angiography using the stereoscopic liquid crystal display.,"The authors have developed a new stereoscopic liquid crystal display that provides real-time 3-dimensional image viewing without special eyeglasses. The device consists of 3 major parts: (1) an image display composed of a 10.4-inch color liquid crystal plate with a resolution of 640 x 480, (2) an automatic head tracking system, and (3) a special backlight unit for the right and left eyes. Eight radiologists interpreted 60 cases of magnetic resonance angiography (29 cases of cerebrovascular disease and 31 normal cases) to compare film display and the liquid crystal display (ie, pseudo 3-dimensional display and true 3-dimensional display). Using a continuously distributed scale ranging from 0% to 100%, the observers ranked their confidence levels in determining the presence or absence of steno-occlusive disease, aneurysm, and arteriovenous malformation (AVM) and their locations. For statistical evaluation, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and Brier score were used. For detecting AVM, film reading showed a significantly higher value in the area under the binormal ROC curve (Az) than did pseudo-3-dimensional display (P < .05). Excluding this, however, no significant difference existed in Az values among the 3 viewing methods. Also, there was no significant difference in Brier score between not only the stereoscopic view and nonstereoscopic view groups, but also the senior and junior groups. Subjective estimation of true 3-dimensional display showed that vessels were more distinguishable with less eye fatigue compared with stereoscopic film reading. The stereoscopic liquid crystal display provided almost equal efficacy to film reading; however, the short optimum distance for observation and the low resolution should be improved."

A patient, 39-year old-male, with IACNS limited to small and middle vessels is described. Recurrent, transient consciousness disturbances, focal myoclonus, papilloedema and temporal lobe epilepsy were observed during disease course. CSF finding of this patient showed lymphocytosis with marked increased protein. Carotid and vertebral angiogram showed irregular luminal outline in branches of all arteries. The most specific finding is that of alternating areas of focal stenosis and ectasia giving a ""sausage"" pattern. These characteristic findings showed in the branch of external carotid arteries. There was no evidence of systemic vasculitis by systemic angiography. Biopsy of temporal artery showed lymphocyte infiltration, fibrinoid necrosis without giant cell and granuloma. Formation of A-V malformation in the branch of external carotid artery was also observed. This histopathological finding was compatible with necrotizing angitis, not granulomatous angitis. Isolated angitis of the central nervous system was diagnosed. In spite of his administration of corticosteroid, cerebrospinal fluid abnormalities has not responded markedly.

We evaluated the sensitivity and the quality of morphological analysis mode possible by an experimental system for imaging cerebrovascular disease versus standard digital subtraction angiography (DSA). The system, the 3D Morphometer, is a computerised X-ray angiography unit capable of acquiring a set of two-dimensional (2D) projections during a rotation and then reconstructing a 3D volume from them. We studied 78 patients with suspected cerebrovascular disease. 3D and 2D images (standard 2D DSA performed during the same procedure), were reviewed blindly to assess detection and display of morphological characteristics of cerebrovascular diseases. We found 53 aneurysms, 22 arteriovenous malformations and two venous angiomas. On 3D angiography we detected two aneurysms we missed on 2D angiography. In 47 aneurysms on which further data were obtained during surgery or embolisation, the 3D angiography allowed more accurate analysis of the neck and surrounding vessels in cases in which the 2D angiographic findings were doubtful. Assessment of arteriovenous malformations was equivalent with both techniques. Under the conditions of our study, the technical constraints being the same for both methods, 3D angiography was superior to 2D angiography.

She had first experienced a transient pain in the left upper extremity one month before admission. She noticed dysesthesia in the same limb and weakness on her left hand, and, five days after, visited our hospital because of suddenly developed convulsion in the limb and loss of consciousness for a few minutes. Neurological examination revealed distal dominant flaccid paresis, positive pathological reflex and touch and position sense disturbances in the affected limb. Brain CT detected two high-density areas in the parietal lobe. Brain MRI demonstrated an acute phase subcortical hematoma in the left postcentral gyrus and a subacute phase one in the left superior parietal lobule. SPECT indicated hypoperfusion in the left frontal and parietal cortex. Cerebral angiography showed no abnormal findings. Her symptoms gradually improved, but left ulnar-type pseudoradicular sensory impairment remained on discharge. We considered the hemorrhage in this patient have arisen from rupture of cavernous hemangioma, because she was relatively young, the hematomas were oval in shape and successively developed in the left parietal lobe.

Recent reports, however, indicate that cerebrovascular accidents are common in PA. We report a case of multiple aneurysms with PA in a middle-aged woman who presented with subarachnoid hemorrhage. A 47-year-old woman with a history of untreated hypertension was referred to our hospital for subarachnoid hemorrhage. Cerebral angiography showed multiple small aneurysms. The initial intervention was aneurysm clipping for a ruptured aneurysm at the bifurcation of the right middle cerebral artery. Despite medication, she continued to suffer from uncontrolled hypertension and hypokalemia. She was diagnosed with PA on the basis of elevated plasma aldosterone, suppressed plasma rennin, and a right adrenal tumor detected by abdominal CT scanning. She underwent several more neck clippings for the remaining aneurysms (unruptured), followed by a total right adrenectomy. Histological examination revealed an adrenal adenoma. After the operation, her blood pressure returned to normal without any vasodepressors. Recent studies have demonstrated that hyperaldosteronism might have direct vasculo-toxic actions, including remodeling, fibrosis, and proliferation. Cerebrovascular accidents caused by PA are reported to have high rates of mortality and recurrence when the PA is overlooked or untreated. Physicians must be alert to the possibility of PA in patients with hypertension and persistent hypokalemia, especially in those who are young or middle-aged. We also recommend screening for intracranial aneurysms by low-invasive magnetic resonance angiography."

CD009372,0,9600195,0,Diagnosis of intracranial vasculitis: a multi-disciplinary approach.,"Intracranial vasculitis, or primary angiitis of the central nervous system (PACNS), is an uncommon, often fatal disorder that frequently responds to aggressive immunosuppressive therapy. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), cerebral angiography, and brain biopsy are diagnostic modalities that vary in invasiveness and diagnostic accuracy. The purpose of this study was to determine whether certain clinical or radiologic features were predictive of a diagnostic biopsy. Thirty consecutive patients undergoing brain biopsy to ""rule out vasculitis"" were studied. Nine patients demonstrated granulomatous or lymphocytic vasculitis, 1 had lymphocytic vasculitis and encephalitis secondary to arbovirus infection, 5 had thickened vessels consistent with hypertensive changes, 5 had amyloid angiopathy and/or changes of Alzheimer disease, 5 demonstrated no pathologic abnormalities, and 1 each had acute infarct, vascular malformation, aneurysm, acellular fibrinoid necrosis, and demyelination. The spectrum of MRI and angiographic changes associated with PACNS were nonspecific, overlapping extensively with changes of chronic hypertension and amyloid deposition. The predictive values of brain biopsy (90-100%) were significantly higher than those of angiography (37-50%) or MRI (43-72%). In this study, morbidity associated with aggressive immunosuppression was significantly greater than that associated with cerebral angiography or brain biopsy. Thus, wedge biopsy of cortical and leptomeningeal tissues is central to the multi-disciplinary approach to a patient with clinical suspicion of PACNS."

The more benign nature of angiographic venous malformations is supported by the cases we are presenting, as well as from a review of the literature, which includes an autopsy study of similar cases. The management of multiple vascular brain lesions is contingent on the verification of symptomatic pathological blood vessels. It is emphasized that angiographically occult vascular malformation could possibly exist in the vicinity of angiographic venous malformation when the patient with intracerebral hemorrhage, especially in the posterior fossa, was diagnosed as having venous malformation."

The CT scans of the head revealed SAH. Cerebral angiography revealed 3 aneurysms: 1 in the right distal anterior cerebral artery (ACA), 1 in the distal portion of the A(1) segment of the right ACA, and 1 in the left vertebral artery. The patient had a history of multiple intraabdominal aneurysms involving the splenic, gastroepiploic, gastroduodenal, and bilateral renal arteries. He underwent a right frontotemporal craniotomy and fibrin coating of the dissecting aneurysm in the distal portion of the A(1) segment of the right ACA, which was the cause of the hemorrhage. Follow-up revealed no significant changes in the residual intracranial and intraabdominal aneurysms. An SAH due to SAM with associated multiple intraabdominal aneurysms is extremely rare. The authors describe their particular case and review the literature pertaining to SAM with associated intracranial and intraabdominal aneurysms."

Cerebral angiography demonstrated no vascular abnormality, and the hematoma was removed surgically. At operation, no abnormal vascular lesion was found in the brain adjoining the hematoma. Two years later, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging demonstrated a few foci of flow voids adjacent to the hematoma cavity. Four years after the hemorrhage, MR imaging showed more extensive flow-void abnormalities that indicated growth of an occult arteriovenous malformation (AVM). Cerebral angiography indicated a definite AVM supplied mainly by branches of the middle cerebral artery. Total resection of this lesion was performed. The histological diagnosis was typical AVM. Immunohistochemistry with vascular endothelial growth factor showed staining in the walls of the abnormal vessels. Serial MR imaging is very useful for the diagnosis and management of occult AVMs."

CD009372,0,22807022,0,Mapping of cerebral perfusion territories using territorial arterial spin labeling: techniques and clinical application.,"A knowledge of the exact cerebral perfusion territory which is supplied by any artery is of great importance in the understanding and diagnosis of cerebrovascular disease. The development and optimization of territorial arterial spin labeling (T-ASL) MRI techniques in the past two decades have made it possible to visualize and determine the cerebral perfusion territories in individual patients and, more importantly, to do so without contrast agents or otherwise invasive procedures. This review provides an overview of the development of ASL techniques that aim to visualize the general cerebral perfusion territories or the territory of a specific artery of interest. The first efforts of T-ASL with pulsed, continuous and pseudo-continuous techniques are summarized and subsequent clinical studies using T-ASL are highlighted. In the healthy population, the perfusion territories of the brain-feeding arteries are highly variable. This high variability requires special consideration in specific patient groups, such as patients with cerebrovascular disease, stroke, steno-occlusive disease of the large arteries and arteriovenous malformations. In the past, catheter angiography with selective contrast injection was the only available method to visualize the cerebral perfusion territories in vivo. Several T-ASL methods, sometimes referred to as regional perfusion imaging, are now available that can easily be combined with conventional brain MRI examinations to show the relationship between the cerebral perfusion territories, vascular anatomy and brain infarcts or other pathology. Increased availability of T-ASL techniques on clinical MRI scanners will allow radiologists and other clinicians to gain further knowledge of the relationship between vasculature and patient diagnosis and prognosis. Treatment decisions, such as surgical revascularization, may, in the near future, be guided by information provided by T-ASL MRI in close correlation with structural MRI and quantitative perfusion information."
CD009372,0,2396261,0,Clinical and laboratory findings in patients with antiphospholipid antibodies and cerebral ischemia. The Antiphospholipid Antibodies in Stroke Study Group.,"We reviewed the clinical and laboratory data of 128 patients with cerebrovascular disease and antiphospholipid antibodies. Cases were evenly divided between men and women, and the mean age of the study group was 46 years. Cerebral infarction occurred in 97 patients, and transient hemispheric ischemic attacks without stroke were recorded in 19; 12 suffered ocular ischemia. Systemic lupus erythematosus was diagnosed in 16% of all cases. Histories of systemic thromboembolic events and recurrent miscarriages were noted in 14% of the patients and in 19% of the women, respectively. Evidence of cerebral infarction preceding the index event was present in 30% of cases. During a mean follow-up of 16 months, nine of 96 (9%) patients sustained new cerebral infarctions. Of 72 echocardiographic studies, 16 (22%) showed valvular abnormalities. Cerebral angiography detected intracranial lesions in 24 of 49 patients (49%). These data indicate that antiphospholipid antibodies can be identified in stroke patients without known autoimmune disorders. They also suggest that antiphospholipid antibody-associated cerebrovascular ischemia may be recurrent and often occurs in patients with systemic thromboembolic events. Our findings should help design a prospective clinical trial that will assess the risk of recurrent thromboembolism in this population, identify stroke risk factors, and address therapy."

The aim of the study was to investigate possible connections between the angiographic data and the clinical condition some years later. In the 37 patients who were not subjected to surgical treatment prognosis was not significantly different in cases with, and those without stenoses/occlusions in the craniocervical vessels. However, patients suffering from severe stenoses/occlusions had a significantly worse prognosis than patients with stenoses of a mild degree. The clinical course in patients with stenoses/occlusions localized in the vertebro-basilar system was significantly more favourable than the course of the disease in patients with similar changes in the carotid system. There was a trend towards a worse clinical picture at the end of the follow-up period in cases with degenerative alterations in the small intracranial arteries. The difference in prognostic value of cerebral 4-vessel angiography in cases of stroke in the young, as opposed to the findings in older patients is discussed."

The angiographic changes of cerebral vasospasm (CVS) are uncommon in patients with this type of SAH. NSAH is uniformly associated with an excellent outcome without associated rebleeding or symptomatic CVS. We report a patient with NSAH who developed severe and diffuse CVS. He was treated with transluminal balloon angioplasty because he has been refractory to conventional treatment measures for CVS.

An asymptomatic woman underwent magnetic resonance angiographic screening in an investigational setting. Three years later, she had an onset of sudden headache, after which her condition rapidly deteriorated. Severe subarachnoid hemorrhage and an intracerebral hematoma were diagnosed. Conventional angiography detected a small ruptured middle cerebral artery trifurcation aneurysm and two very small aneurysms. There are still limitations in the ability of magnetic resonance angiography to detect small or very small aneurysms.

The protocol called for a three point assessment: on admission to the rehabilitation ward and at one month and one year after entry. Baseline and follow-up examinations included clinical and laboratory tests, CT scan, cerebral blood flow studies and angiography. Motor functions were evaluated by the Rivermead Motor Assessment and dependence (ADL) was measured by the Barthel index. Neuropsychological evaluations were also made using Benton's test, Bourdon's letter cancellation test and the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale. Significant improvement was found in functional conditions both one month and one year after entry. There was a strong correlation between the Rivermead Motor Assessment and the Barthel index.

CD009372,0,10150152,0,Transcranial Doppler validation pilot study.,"The use of transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD) for the evaluation of patients with ischemic cerebrovascular disease remains controversial. This study was organized to gather preliminary data regarding the sensitivity and specificity of TCD when compared to cerebral angiography in detecting stenosing lesions and collateral flow patterns of the anterior cerebral circulation. Forty-two patients from six medical centers were prospectively enrolled. Each received cerebral angiography and TCD testing within 24 hours of each other. Based on TCD criteria established a priori, the results were first analyzed by a blinded investigator and then by computer. Computerized analyses were then repeated with modified criteria. Collateral flow through the anterior communicating and ophthalmic arteries was detected with sensitivities of 62% and 100%, and specificities of 98% and 92%, respectively. Internal carotid artery proximal and distal severe ( greater than 70%) stenoses were detected with sensitivities of 79% and 100% and specificities of 88% and 97%. Middle and anterior cerebral artery stenoses and middle cerebral artery occlusion were detected with specificities exceeding 98%; however, the data were insufficient to determine sensitivity. Computerized analyses did not permit improvement of sensitivity and specificity of the baseline criteria. The selected TCD criteria are highly specific in detecting intracranial stenoses and collateral flow patterns of the anterior circulation. The criteria have limited but acceptable sensitivity and specificity in detecting internal carotid artery origin severe stenoses, and are highly sensitive in detecting ophthalmic artery retrograde flow. A study with a larger sample is necessary to provide definitive guidelines for diagnosis."
CD009372,0,12805485,0,Reliability of assessing percentage of diffusion-perfusion mismatch.,Emergent neurovascular imaging holds promise in identifying new and optimum target populations for thrombolysis in stroke. Recent research has focused on patients with diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI)-perfusion-weighted MRI (PWI) mismatch as a marker of tissue at risk of infarction and a means to select the most suitable candidates for thrombolysis. The present study sought to estimate the reliability of assessing the percentage of DWI-PWI mismatch.
CD009372,0,8426937,0,Comparison of time-of-flight and phase-contrast MR neuroangiographic techniques.,"Magnetic resonance (MR) angiography constitutes a group of evolving MR imaging techniques that can be used to directly image flow in arteries, veins, and cerebrospinal fluid. By using multiple MR angiographic sequences in each of 18 patients with neurologic conditions such as aneurysms, arteriovenous malformations, and carotid atherostenotic disease, the advantages, disadvantages, and unique artifacts of each technique could be investigated. Time-of-flight imaging is susceptible to saturation effects, and short T1 substances may simulate flow. Two-dimensional time-of-flight imaging is useful in cranial venography in assessing the patency of the dural sinuses or venous drainage from an arteriovenous malformation. Three-dimensional time-of-flight images depict small and medium-sized aneurysms. Phase-contrast imaging has excellent background suppression, allows variable velocity encoding, and provides directional flow information. Two-dimensional phase-contrast imaging is useful in the assessment of the patency of major vascular structures. Three-dimensional phase-contrast imaging (with 30-cm/sec velocity encoding) is also useful in depicting small and medium-sized aneurysms. Although some applications of MR angiography are clear, further study and development of the techniques are necessary to determine which imaging sequence or combination of techniques is best suited for answering specific diagnostic questions."

CD009372,0,1641092,0,Acute subdural hematoma after aneurysmal rupture; evacuation with aneurysmal clipping after emergent infusion computed tomography: case report.,"A 74-year-old woman sought treatment after an initial subarachnoid hemorrhage verified on computed tomographic scan with no focal neurological deficit. Shortly after admission, she sustained a second subarachnoid hemorrhage with acute neurological decompensation. A repeat computed tomographic scan revealed increased blood along the right medial temporal region, as well as in the interhemispheric fissure and bilateral sylvian cisterns. Also evident was a right hemispheric acute subdural hematoma. The patient's rapidly deteriorating neurological status precluded a cerebral angiogram; therefore, a double-dose infusion computed tomographic scan was performed. This revealed a cerebral artery aneurysm adjacent to the right medial temporal hematoma. She was taken to the operating room on the basis of this study. After evacuation of the right hemispheric subdural hematoma and clipping of the right posterior communicating artery aneurysm, the patient made a rapid, full neurological recovery."

CD009372,0,23065095,0,"Relationship between routine multi-detector cardiac computed tomographic angiography prior to reoperative cardiac surgery, length of stay, and hospital charges.","While multi-detector cardiac computed tomography angiography (MDCCTA) prior to reoperative cardiac surgery (RCS) has been associated with improved clinical outcomes, its impact on hospital charges and length of stay remains unclear. We studied 364 patients undergoing RCS at Washington Hospital Center between 2004 and 2008, including 137 clinically referred for MDCCTA. Baseline demographics, procedural data, and perioperative outcomes were recorded at the time of the procedure. The primary clinical endpoint was the composite of perioperative death, myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, and hemorrhage-related reoperation. Secondary clinical endpoints included surgical procedural variables and the perioperative volume of bleeding and transfusion. Length of stay was determined using the hospital's electronic medical record. Cost data were extracted from the hospital's billing summary. Analysis was performed on individual categories of care, as well as on total hospital charges. Data were compared between subjects with and without MDCCTA, after adjustment for the Society of Thoracic Surgeons score. Baseline characteristics were similar between the two groups. MDCCTA was associated with shorter procedural times, shorter intensive care unit stays, fewer blood transfusions, and less frequent perioperative MI. There was additionally a trend towards a lower incidence of the primary endpoint (17.5 vs. 24.2 %, p = 0.13) primarily due to a lower incidence of perioperative MI (0 vs. 5.7 %, p = 0.002). MDCCTA was also associated with lower median recovery room [$1,325 (1,250-3,302) vs. $3,217 (1,325-5,353) p < 0.001] and nursing charges [$6,335 (3,623-10,478) vs. $6,916 (3,915-14,499) p = 0.03], although operating room charges were higher [$24,100 (22,300-29,700) vs. $23,500 (19,900-27,700) p < 0.05]. Median total charges [$127,000 (95,000-188,000) vs. $123,000 (86,800-226,000) p = 0.77] and length of stay [9 days (6-19) vs. 11 days (7-19), p = 0.21] were similar. Means analysis demonstrated a strong trend towards lower mean total hospital charges [$163,000 (108,426) vs. $192,000 (181,706), p = 0.06] in the MDCCTA group. In conclusion, preoperative MDCCTA is associated with a number of improved perioperative outcomes and does not significantly effect the length of stay or total hospital charges during the index hospitalization."
CD009372,0,8267356,0,Comparison of accuracy of magnetic resonance angiography with conventional angiography: a report of 45 cases.,"To investigate the accuracy of magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), compared to conventional cerebral and carotid angiography (CA), 45 patients underwent MRA within one week after CA. The MRA involves a FISP (fast imaging steady precession) pulse sequence base on three-dimensional time-of-flight phenomena at 1.0 Tesla. Repetition time of 35-40 msec, echo time of 7-11 msec and a flip angle of 15-25 degrees were used to optimise the depiction of blood flow as high intensity. Volume data were then submitted to a maximum intensity projection programme and viewed at multiple arbitrary projection angles rotating through the three orthogonal planes. Venous structures were suppressed with a presaturation slab superior to the area of interest. All significant stenoses and occlusions at the carotid bifurcation and circle of Willis were detected. Other than the carotid siphon (61.4%), the rest of the arteries have above 70% complete agreement between MRA and CA. The carotid bifurcation and basilar artery show complete agreement of 75.4% and 76.2% respectively, making MRA a simple sensitive screening procedure. This report shows that MR angiography has an important role in the evaluation of blood flow in the head and neck regions."
CD009372,0,8267357,0,Cerebrovascular applications of magnetic resonance angiography.,"Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) has been applied to a variety of different manifestations of cerebrovascular disease to date. Practically, the limitations of these techniques must be taken into account such that the appropriate method is applied to answer a specific clinical question and the acquisition parameters are chosen to maximise the sensitivity and specificity of the study. Based upon these results, it must be decided whether the conventional parenchymal MR and MRA evaluations are sufficient in a particular setting or whether it is necessary to commit the patient to a more traditional, invasive angiographic study for a more thorough investigation. Presently, MR angiographic studies and flow measurement techniques serve to compliment the more traditional spin-echo evaluation of patients with small aneurysms, arterial and venous occlusions, vascular malformations and in some cases of neoplastic vascular invasion. With well-trained technicians and carefully prescribed protocols, this new information and improved diagnostic sensitivity can be used routinely with only a minor increase in patient exam time."

Its incidence was thought to be radiologically rare previously but with greater clinical awareness, the routine use of contrast enhanced computerised tomography (CECT) and the increasing availability of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), it is no longer perceived to be a rare lesion. In fact, it is the commonest intracranial vascular malformation seen at autopsy. We report our experience of 15 patients with cerebral venous angiomas, 14 of whom had their lesions confirmed by cerebral angiography. Presentation was variable and non-specific. The commonest presenting symptom was headache (n = 7). Other clinical presentations included epilepsy (n = 5), intracerebral bleed (n = 4, two were thought to be due to an associated cerebral cavernous angioma and one was due to a ruptured arteriovenous malformation) and non-specific giddiness (n = 3). Six were diagnosed incidentally.

Their experience with over 150 patients indicates that this examination may be performed in conjunction with standard spin-echo imaging with only a minimal increase in patient examination time. This combined examination is most applicable to atherosclerotic disease of the carotid bifurcation, arterial occlusions of the primary and secondary branches of the intracranial circulation (particularly in pediatric patients such as those following ECMO or with sickle cell anemia), and patients with saccular berry aneurysms. This type of static, angiographic technique adds little to standard spin-echo imaging in patients with arteriovenous fistulae, neoplasms, and giant intracranial aneurysms. Limitations of the present technique include the inability to visualize slow flow lesions (e.g., giant aneurysms) and selected high flow states (arteriovenous fistulae, some severe stenoses)."

There were two patients with arteriovenous fistula (AVF), three with arteriovenous malformation (AVM), and one with multiple AVMs associated with AVF. Seizures were the most common presenting symptom (seen in three patients), and two of them had intracerebral hematomas (ICH). In the remainder, the malformations were incidentally found in the course of evaluation of other diseases. Their locations were variable, but the majority was superficially confined to the cerebral cortex. Arterial supply was from mostly one feeding artery that was a cortical branch of either anterior, middle, or posterior cerebral artery. In six of nine malformations, the venous drainage was through a superficial cerebral vein into either the superior sagittal sinus or transverse sinus. Direct surgery was done on two patients with ICH, artificial embolization on one, and stereotactic radiosurgery on one. The cerebral vascular malformations in HHT are not infrequent, and in particular the importance of computed tomography and cerebral angiography should be recognized in patients with pulmonary AVF associated with HHT."

Clinical information and MRI images were reviewed for 149 outpatients aged 46-90 years, excluding those who had a previous symptomatic cerebrovascular event. CMBs were evaluated on T2∗-weighted MRI, and BA diameters were measured as the maximal width of the flow void on axial T2-weighted MRI to assess dilatation. Patients were divided into 2 groups, with CMBs and without CMBs, and clinical information and BA diameters were compared between the groups. Regression analyses of the data also were performed. The 2 groups had significant differences in mean blood pressure (MBP), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and uricemic acid levels, and BA diameter. Adjusted logistic regression analysis showed that MBP (odds ratio [OR], 1.059 per 1 mm Hg; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.019-1.101; P = .0035), LDL (OR, 0.976 per 1 mg/dL; 95% CI, 0.960-0.994; P = .0072), and BA diameter (OR, 3.266 per 1 mm; 95% CI, 1.504-7.103; P = .0028) each had an independent association with the presence of CMB. Adjusted multiple regression analysis showed that only BA diameter (β coefficient, 0.240; 95% CI, 0.775-3.734; P = .0031) was independently associated with the number of CMBs.

The procedure hitherto, in which angiographic clarification of the intracranial space-occupying lesions and of the extracranial vascular changes is almost always performed, will change with the introduction of computer tomography in favor of the bloodless method (Doppler echography). Angiography will then only be carried out in proven hemodynamically active stenosis after the neurological symptoms have receded. The treatment of ischemic cerebral disease is a task for the hospital. Transient ischemic attacks also require hospital supervision, preferably under conditions of intensive care. In addition to support from infusions and digitalization, Actovegin infusions are standard therapy."
CD009372,0,11688694,0,MRI of acute post-ischemic cerebral hemorrhage in stroke patients: diagnosis with T2*-weighted gradient-echo sequences.,"The use of T2*-weighted sequences has been advocated for early differentiation between hematoma and ischemia in patients with acute stroke. Early hemorrhagic transformation of ischemic stroke is an adverse event which may occur under treatment and may impair the prognosis: our aim is to evaluate the ability of T2*-weighted gradient-echo sequence (T2* GRE) to detect post-ischemic cerebral hemorrhage. The imaging procedure included: (1) baseline CT scan at admission. (2) MRI performed within 24 h of therapy onset including: (a) dual fast spin echo T2 sequence, (b) axial isotropic echoplanar diffusion-weighted imaging sequence, (c) conventional T2* GRE, and (d) 3D TOF turbo MRA. Post-ischemic cerebral hemorrhage was diagnosed if T2* GRE detected a focal intraparenchymal area of signal loss. The diameter of this lesion had to be more than 5 mm in order to eliminate past microbleeds. (3) Patients who showed an early suspicion of bleeding on MRI promptly had a second CT scan, and, if this one was negative for bleeding, another CT scan was performed 1 day later. All the other patients had a control CT scan during the first week. Forty-five consecutive patients have been included. T2* GRE showed intracranial bleeding in seven. The diagnosis of post-ischemic cerebral bleeding was confirmed by CT in all patients. Control CT scans did not reveal any post-ischemic cerebral hemorrhage in patients with negative MRI. In one case, hemorrhage was seen earlier on MRI than on CT scan. In conclusion, T2* GRE appeared to be at least as efficient as CT scan in the detection of early post-ischemic cerebral hemorrhage."
CD009372,0,19663337,0,[A case of repeated intracerebral hemorrhage due to a ruptured aneurysm of collateral circulation from the posterior cerebral artery to the middle cerebral artery].,"We present a case of ruptured distal middle cerebral artery aneurysm associated with occlusion of the anterior trunk of the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery. An 83-year-old man had right homonymous hemianopsia and right mild hemiparesis. CT scan revealed hematoma and a perifocal low density area at the left occipital subcortex without subarchnoid hemorrhage (SAH). MRI showed repeated bleeding at the same location as the CT scan. Moreover, cerebral angiograms disclosed an aneurysm on the leptomeningeal anastomosis from the left posterior cerebral artery to the middle cerebral artery. The anterior trunk of the left middle cerebral artery was occluded at the origin. The aneurysm was not situated at the bifurcation and was trapped without new neurological complications. This case suggested that hemodynamic stress due to occlusion of the main artery contributed to the development of an aneurysm at the collateral artery. Even if intraparenchymal hematoma presents without SAH, and even if it is located at a rare site for aneurysms, we should inspect the source of bleeding considering factors preventing SAH arising from aneurysms."

In 185 of these patients cerebral angiography was performed in addition. The size and localisation of infarcts as shown on the computer tomogram were compared with the changes found in the carotid angiogram and were also related to the localisation of occlusion or stenosis of the corresponding extra- and intracranial vessels. In the presence of a normal carotid angiogram, CT may show infarcts of varying localisation and size; with stenoses or occlusion of the extracranial portion of the internal carotid artery, the infarcts tend to be smaller and that, in the presence of occulsions of the intracranial cerebral vessels, infarcts tend to be more extensive and to correspond to the territory supplied by the occluded vessels.

The indirect criteria are based on measurement of flow in the common carotid and in the terminal branches of the ophthalmic artery before and after the common carotid artery and branches of the external carotid artery are compressed. With the direct criteria, internal and external carotid artery are differentiated by diastolic flow, and local inhomogenetics of flow (turbulence) are detected.

CD009372,0,740158,0,The diagnosis of cerebral atrophy on the basis of cerebral angiogram.,"An increased distance between brain surface, represented by the terminal arterial branches, and skull causes the appearance of a broad avascular band in the carotid angiogram, which--apart from other criteria--has been valued as a sign of cerebral atrophy. We investigated 54 patients (ages 60-79 years) suffering from cerebrovascular disease. Carotid angiographies of the afflicted hemispheres were carried out within 4 to 90 days after the stroke. The distance between vessels and skull was measured in frontal and lateral projection. We evaluated statistically the impact on this distance of alterations in extracranial vessel walls, number of attacks, severity of stroke, and patient's age. The results are compared to those of CAT. Only limited correlations have been found between the above-mentioned parameters and the distance between vessels and skull. Thus the distance is only of limited diagnostic value for the verification of senile cerebral atrophy on a vascular basis."

A grading system was used to evaluate the ability of IV-DSA to answer specific diagnostic questions regarding intracranial tumors, vasospasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage, lesions of the sella, dural sinus occlusion, and post-therapeutic embolization. Eighty-four per cent of the examinations provided clinically useful information. In 15% of the cases limited but useful information was obtained; only 1% of the examinations provided no useful information.

CD009372,0,22386063,0,Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome associated with brain parenchymal hemorrhage.,"We described a 7-year-old girl with reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome associated with brain parenchymal hemorrhage. She initially presented with high fever and pancytopenia, leading to a diagnosis of most severe type aplastic anemia. We treated her with cyclosporine, methylprednisolone and anti-thymocyte globulin. Thereafter she recurrently complained of a very severe headache called as thunderclap, and finally exhibited loss of consciousness. Brain imaging revealed massive parenchymal hemorrhage between the left occipital and parietal lobes on computed tomography, and diffuse cerebral vasoconstriction on magnetic resonance angiography. The cerebral vasoconstriction resolved within two months, and thus we diagnosed her as having reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome associated with brain parenchymal hemorrhage. This syndrome has been frequently reported in adult females, but rarely in children. However, even in children, a so called thunderclap headache may become a clue for the diagnosis of reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome, especially in cases taking immunosuppressive agents. Immediate magnetic resonance angiography is essential to diagnose this syndrome, and a prompt application of calcium channel inhibitors should be considered to resolve constriction of the vessels and to prevent subsequent brain damage."

Two cases of cranial base dural arteriovenous fistula, one internal carotid pseudoaneurysm and one PICA aneurysm were demonstrated utilizing the angiographic CT for obtaining significant image details on the relative location of the diseases against the neighboring bony structure. An angiography suite outfitted with conventional DSA and rotational volume cone-beam was used, angiographic CT images being concomitantly produced together with the routine angiographic modalities. By virtue of the angiographic CT images integrating the selective angiography and reconstructed cranial base tomography, we succeeded in getting significant information on the relative location of various vascular diseases to the skull base, greatly facilitating the diagnosis and treatment procedures."
CD009372,0,12931300,0,Real-time magnetic resonance imaging for interventional neuroradiological procedures.,"Over the last two decades, interventional neuroradiologists have developed powerful techniques for the treatment of cerebrovascular disorders and brain tumors. Current interventional neuroradiological procedures are performed under X-ray fluoroscopy, which has allowed for high temporal and spatial resolution. However, these imaging techniques do not provide the treating physician with vital anatomic and functional information regarding vessel walls and the surrounding brain tissue. Better visualization of vessel structures and real-time information about the state of perfusion and metabolism of the surrounding brain tissue (real-time magnetic resonance arteriography, diffusion and perfusion-weighted imaging, apparent diffusion coefficient maps) would enhance safety and efficacy of neuroendovascular procedures available currently. Recent advances in magnetic resonance hardware and software have permitted significant enhancements in temporal and spatial resolution, which have resulted in the capability of visualizing anatomic structures with real-time fluoroscopy and angiography. This review outlines how real-time magnetic resonance procedures may replace conventional X-ray fluoroscopy in diagnostic and interventional neuroradiology during the next decade."

We hypothesized that TNF-alpha measured from brain interstitial fluid would correlate with the severity of vasospasm following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). From a consecutive series of 10 aSAH patients who underwent cerebral microdialysis (MD) and evaluation of vasospasm by CT angiogram (CTA) or digital subtraction angiography (DSA), TNF-alpha levels from MD were measured at 8-hour intervals from aSAH days 4-6 using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. An attending neuroradiologist blinded to the study independently evaluated each CTA and DSA and assigned a vasospasm index (VI). Five patients had a VI<2 and 5 patients had a VI>2, where the median VI was 2 (range 0-13). The median log TNF-alpha area under the curve (AUC) was 1.64pg/mL *day (interquartile range 1.48-1.71) for the VI<2 group, and 2.11pg/mL *day (interquartile range 1.95-2.47) for the VI>2 group (p<0.01). Thus, in this small series of poor-grade aSAH patients, the AUC of TNF-alpha levels from aSAH days 4-6 correlates with the severity of radiographic vasospasm. Further analysis in a larger population is warranted based on our preliminary findings."

The patient was a 55-year-old woman in a state of semicoma. We observed widespread neurofibromas and café au lait spots on her trunk and limbs. Computed tomography (CT) scan revealed diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage and right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage (WFNS grade IV, Fisher's classification group 4). Cerebral angiography showed two intracranial aneurysms at the anterior communicating artery, an aneurysm at the cavernous portion of the right carotid artery, a PPTA, and MCA fenestration.

A 44-year-old female slipped and hit her head without loss of consciousness, one month ago. Recently she complained of headaches and visited the department of Neurosurgery, Washokai Sadamoto Hospital on May 21, 1985. There were no physical and neurological signs on examination. Plain CT scans showed a crescent-shaped high density area in the left frontal region with a slight mass sign. She was diagnosed as having a possible chronic subdural hematoma and further examination was recommended. Biplane ultrafast overlapping cerebral computed angiotomograms clearly demonstrated a so-called avascular area delineated by enhanced superficial cerebral vessels with contrast medium. Furthermore, a marked high density mass measuring 8 mm X 10 mm X 6 mm in diameters was simultaneously demonstrated around the right anterior clinoid process on the same image, suggesting a cerebral aneurysm. Right carotid angiograms showed a right internal carotid-posterior communicating junction aneurysm. The irrigation of the left chronic subdural hematoma was carried out on May 24 and the neck clipping of the right IC-PC junction aneurysm was done two weeks later. During the operation, there were no findings suggesting a previous subarachnoid hemorrhage from the aneurysm, but a bleb was found on the aneurysm. The post-operative course was uneventful. Since the introduction of the CT scanner, chronic subdural hematomas are usually operated without cerebral angiograms.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD009372,0,3258719,0,MR imaging in the management of supratentorial intracranial AVMs.,"The MR images, CT scans, and angiograms of 15 consecutive patients with intracranial, supratentorial arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) were studied retrospectively. The three imaging techniques were evaluated separately to assess their utility in defining the size, characteristics, and location of the AVM nidus, its arterial supply, and venous drainage. The studies were also evaluated for their ability to show associated parenchymal abnormalities, the presence of mass effect, and changes occurring after embolization. MR was superior to both CT and angiography in showing the exact anatomic relationships of the nidus, feeding arteries, and draining veins, as well as in demonstrating the extent of AVM nidus obliteration after embolization. MR was more sensitive than CT in revealing associated parenchymal abnormalities and subacute hemorrhage. Because of flow-related artifacts and low sensitivity in distinguishing calcification from rapid flow and/or hemosiderin, MR seemed to have a low sensitivity for detecting old hemorrhage within an AVM nidus. Angiography is still needed in the planning of either surgical or endovascular treatment of AVMs."

The patient suffered disturbed consciousness on the day after the examination, and was admitted to our emergency centre. A CT scan and magnetic resonance imaging revealed an ischaemic lesion in the left basal ganglia, suggesting deep sinus occlusion. Anticoagulant therapy was administered. One day after admission, a CT scan showed a haematoma and severe brain swelling in the same region. Cerebral angiography demonstrated a straight sinus occlusion.

CD009372,0,16093385,0,Imaging experimental cerebral malaria in vivo: significant role of ischemic brain edema.,"The first in vivo magnetic resonance study of experimental cerebral malaria is presented. Cerebral involvement is a lethal complication of malaria. To explore the brain of susceptible mice infected with Plasmodium berghei ANKA, multimodal magnetic resonance techniques were applied (imaging, diffusion, perfusion, angiography, spectroscopy). They reveal vascular damage including blood-brain barrier disruption and hemorrhages attributable to inflammatory processes. We provide the first in vivo demonstration for blood-brain barrier breakdown in cerebral malaria. Major edema formation as well as reduced brain perfusion was detected and is accompanied by an ischemic metabolic profile with reduction of high-energy phosphates and elevated brain lactate. In addition, angiography supplies compelling evidence for major hemodynamics dysfunction. Actually, edema further worsens ischemia by compressing cerebral arteries, which subsequently leads to a collapse of the blood flow that ultimately represents the cause of death. These findings demonstrate the coexistence of inflammatory and ischemic lesions and prove the preponderant role of edema in the fatal outcome of experimental cerebral malaria. They improve our understanding of the pathogenesis of cerebral malaria and may provide the necessary noninvasive surrogate markers for quantitative monitoring of treatment."

CD009372,0,1492601,0,[Neuroradiology in the physiopathologic diagnosis of subarachnoid hemorrhage--cerebral aneurysm].,"The clinical importance of the cerebral aneurismatic lesion in well known. In Portugal we still do not have reliable statistics regarding the occurrence of the subarachnoid hemorrhage, however we can make a comparison through Kassel's and Drake's studies where they refer that annually 28,000 North-Americans suffer from subarachnoid hemorrhage attributed to the rupture of the cerebral aneurysm. This is a clinical situation that needs to be analyzed, more so because if it is not diagnosed and treated in time, it can cause a high level of morbidity and mortality. From 1984 to 1990, the authors studied 208 clinical cases of in-patients at the Santa Maria Hospital who had been diagnosed as having subarachnoid hemorrhage-cerebral aneurysm. They analyzed 172 cranium-encephalic Tomographies and 190 cerebral Angiographies. They found levels that overlapped the series already published with respect to the location of the lesion, dimensions and age groups involved. They tried to relate the presence aneurysm in the willis arterial circle with the occurrence of locoregional anatomic variants that were detected in 51% of the patients with aneurysm of the anterior communicating artery and in 33% of the cases in the posterior communicating artery. The high occurrence of serious forms of tomodensitrometric presentation should also be emphasized. As a matter of fact, 42.6% of the patients studied were grouped in degree IV of the Fisher Scale. This result translates the effort that is still required towards an early clinical and imaging diagnosis of warning hemorrhage to avoid or prevent a catastrophic hemorrhage recurrence."
CD009372,0,15045615,0,Neuroradiological features of vertigo.,"The diagnostic pathway in a patient with vertigo starts with the accurate evaluation of medical history followed by a general physical and neurological examination. This step can often lead to the identification of the correct cause of the disease or, at least, to a distinction between peripheral and central vertigo. Neuroradiological investigations have to be considered as elective diagnostic procedures and include: computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance (MR), MR angiography (MRA), angiography. For the diagnosis of peripheral vertigo, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, labyrinthitis, Meniere disease, perilymphatic fistula, local trauma, toxic labyrinthitis, acute otitis media and chronic middle ear effusion,the role of imaging techniques is controversial. CT and MR are performed to rule out other pathologies and to confirm the diagnosis. Increased resolution and application of special MR sequences enhancing the intralabyrinthine fluids have enabled more detailed analysis of labyrinthine structures and pathology. Both T2 and T1 contrast sequences are necessary. A high resolution CT study is required when otitis media is suspected and in the follow-up of post-traumatic vertigo. The causes of central vertigo are numerous and include: vertebro-basilar circulation vascular events, multiple sclerosis (MS), migraine-associated vertigo, cerebellar and brainstem tumors, CNS infections. Among them cerebrovascular ischemia and multiple sclerosis are the most frequent. In these situations imaging studies become mandatory. CT can diagnose most cerebellar hemorrhages and some cerebellar and brainstem acute ischemia, enhanced MR has proved to be the most sensitive tool to detect posterior fossa lesion. Diffusion-weighted MR can reveal acute ischemic changes before routine MR. There has been evidence that MR angiography, providing angiogram-like images of the intracranial vessels may sometimes avoid invasive angiography. MRA resolution is not as good as traditional angiography and may also be compromised by movements and other artifacts. Selective angiography of the posterior circulation is often indicated for therapeutic decisions."

CD009372,0,8634493,0,Detection of vasospasm by transcranial Doppler sonography. The challenges of the anterior and posterior cerebral arteries.,"Little information exists on the utility of transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD) in detecting anterior (ACA) and posterior cerebral artery (PCA) vasospasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage. During the period at risk for vasospasm, 53 patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage who had technically adequate TCD performed within 24 hours of cerebral angiography, allowing evaluation of 87 ACAs and 84 PCAs, were studied. ACA and PCA vasospasm were defined by mean blood flow velocities of at least 120 cm/sec and at least 90 cm/sec, respectively. For detection of ACA vasospasm, sensitivity was 18% and specificity was 65%. For PCA vasospasm, sensitivity was 48% and specificity was 69%. False-positive findings for occlusion accounted for 12 (92%) of 13 ACA of false-positive results and 7 (37%) of 19 PCA false-positive results, and were most often due to anatomical factors and operator error or inexperience. After exclusion of both true-positive and false-positive findings for occlusion and changes in the diagnostic criterion to at least 130 cm/sec for ACA vasospasm and at least 110 cm/sec for PCA vasospasm, specificity improved for both types of vasospasms (100 and 93%, respectively). However, the sensitivity of TCD to detect ACA and PCA vasospasm is limited by a variety of anatomical, technical, and other factors. It is concluded that TCD is highly specific in detecting both ACA and PCA vasospasm on arteries that can be insonated."

At operation, the suspected pituitary adenoma was revealed to be a sellar haematoma; the aneurysm was successfully clipped. Postoperatively, the patient developed hypotension and right hemiparesis which, as well as the third nerve paresis, progressively improved to full recovery. At 12 months follow-up the patient is neurologically intact and generally well. The clinical features, the management of such a case and the importance of differential diagnosis in the acute stage are emphasised and discussed along with relevant literature."

Special attention is paid to three imaging parameters: cerebral microangiopathy, lesion size on diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), and the role of cerebral microbleeds. Both severe cerebral microangiopathy and increasing lesion size on DWI are now established risk factors for sICH following thrombolysis, while the presence of a single or few microbleeds is not associated with a substantially elevated sICH risk."

Case report.,"The authors describe the case of a 13-year-old boy who presented with an intraventricular hemorrhage caused by a left trigonal arteriovenous malformation. After an initial recovery, the patient experienced complete right-sided paresis on posthemorrhage Day 6. Severe cerebral vasospasm was found on MR angiography and confirmed on conventional cerebral angiography. Intraarterial nicardipine injection and balloon angioplasty were successfully performed with improved vasospasm and subsequent neurological recovery. Cerebral vasospasm should be considered in the differential diagnosis for neurological deterioration following an arteriovenous malformation hemorrhage, and aggressive treatment can be administered to prevent ischemia and further neurological deficits."

CD009372,0,16956767,0,Loss of M5 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors leads to cerebrovascular and neuronal abnormalities and cognitive deficits in mice.,"The M5 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (M5R) has been shown to play a crucial role in mediating acetylcholine-dependent dilation of cerebral blood vessels. We show that male M5R-/- mice displayed constitutive constriction of cerebral arteries using magnetic resonance angiography in vivo. Male M5R-/- mice exhibited a significantly reduced cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, basal ganglia, and thalamus. Cortical and hippocampal pyramidal neurons from M5R-/- mice showed neuronal atrophy. Hippocampus-dependent spatial and nonspatial memory was also impaired in M5R-/- mice. In M5R-/- mice, CA3 pyramidal cells displayed a significantly attenuated frequency of the spontaneous postsynaptic current and long-term potentiation was significantly impaired at the mossy fiber-CA3 synapse. Our findings suggest that impaired M5R signaling may play a role in the pathophysiology of cerebrovascular deficits. The M5 receptor may represent an attractive novel therapeutic target to ameliorate memory deficits caused by impaired cerebrovascular function."

Central brain damage (internal capsule, basal ganglia, thalamus) resulted in significantly higher degree of motor impairment than neo-cortical damage, while the size of the damage apparently did not influence the motor-function. Self-care ADL was significantly associated with level of motor impairment. Moreover, significantly less final recovery of exteroception and kinesthesia was observed for lesions in the non-dominant than the dominant hemisphere. It is suggested that in patients found suited for admittance to rehabilitation wards visualization of the brain damage may be a useful adjunct when stating the goals for the rehabilitation process."
CD009372,0,20648688,0,Removal of CSF pixels on brain MR perfusion images using first several images and Otsu's thresholding technique.,"Brain MR perfusion imaging is used to evaluate local perfusion in patients with cerebral vascular disease. Quantitative measurements on the hemodynamic parameters and volume of brain with abnormal perfusion provide an estimation of the severity of the brain perfusion defect. However, quantitative measurements of these focal cerebral hemodynamic parameters are limited by the presence of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pixels. We noticed that the CSF has a higher signal than other tissue types on the first perfusion image, which is usually discarded in routine parametric image calculations. This signal difference, however, can be used to segment CSF pixels on the perfusion images. An image division was used to generate ratio images to compensate for spatially dependent signal variation caused by the inhomogeneity of excitation radiofrequency field. By applying an appropriate signal threshold to the ratio images, CSF pixels can be identified and removed from the parametric images. With the removal of CSF pixels, the volume of delayed-perfusion brain parenchyma can be better visualized and the interference from the CSF can be avoided. The proposed technique is simple, fast, automatic, and effective, and no extra scanning is needed to use this technique."

Cranial CT showed cortical subarachnoid hemorrhage (cSAH) at the right parietal lobe and cerebral angiography on day 5 revealed multiple cerebral arterial constriction, diagnosed as reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS). We could not detect vasoconstriction in MRA at the first examination on day 4, and vasoconstrictive finding appeared around Willis circle 8 days later. There was a temporal difference in a cephalalgic symptom and vasoconstrictive appearance. Clinical symptoms completely recovered and head CT, MRI/MRA findings were reversible after two months, reflecting a rather good RCVS outcome. However, we also followed up this case precisely using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with easy Z-score imaging system (e-ZIS), and hypoperfusion at the locus of cSAH persisted for more than one year. This finding strongly suggests that tissue damage in the cSAH locus induced by RCVS may be subclinicaly irreversible, even though clinical symptoms and abnormalities in cranial MRI and MRA completely recover.SPECT may be a high sensitive technique to detect the irreversible lesion in RCVS."

Intravenous infusion of nicardipine started before or immediately after early operation. The dosage was from 4 to 10 mg/h with an average of 7.4 mg/h. The duration was from 2 to 17 days with an average of 12.3 days. Symptomatic vasospasm was observed in only one (3%) out of 33 patients. The remaining 32 patients (97%) showed neither ischemic symptoms nor low-density areas on computed tomography. Severe angiographical vasospasm was diagnosed in 3 patients, who entered hospital on day 3 to 5 after initial attacks. They were operated upon on day 4 to 6 under the administration of nicardipine before or immediately after the operation. No patients showed symptomatic vasospasm and angiographical vasospasm was improved markedly. The present study demonstrated that high dose nicardipine appeared to prevent both brain ischemia and angiographical vasospasm after aneurysmal SAH."
CD009372,0,22209646,0,Intraprocedural prediction of hemorrhagic cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome after carotid artery stenting.,"Hyperperfusion syndrome (HPS) is a rare but severe complication after carotid artery stenting (CAS). Reliable methods for predicting HPS remain to be developed. We aimed to establish a predictive value of hemorrhagic HPS after CAS. Our retrospective study included 136 consecutive patients who had undergone CAS. We determined the cerebral circulation time (CCT) by measuring the interval between the point of maximal opacification of the terminal portion of the internal carotid artery and the cortical vein. We calculated intraprocedural CCT changes (ΔCCT) by subtracting postprocedural CCT values from preprocedural CCT values. The mean ΔCCT was 0.9 ± 0.9 seconds; 3 patients (2.2%) with prolonged ΔCCT (2.7, 5.4, and 5.8 seconds) developed HPS. The cutoff time of 2.7 seconds predicted hemorrhagic HPS retrospectively with 100% sensitivity and 99% specificity. Our findings suggest that post-CAS HPS can be predicted by using the ΔCCT value obtained by intraprocedural digital subtraction angiography. Patients with a ΔCCT >2.7 seconds require careful intensive hemodynamic and neurologic monitoring after CAS."

Cerebral angiography demonstrated no aneurysm or vascular abnormalities. T(1)-weighted magnetic resonance imaging with contrast medium revealed an enhanced lesion along the falx. The lesion and cyst were removed, and histological examination revealed a pilocytic astrocytoma. Spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage from pilocytic astrocytoma is rare, with only 15 reported cases mostly involving intratumoral hemorrhage in the parenchyma of hypothalamic and cerebellar tumors. SAH caused by cerebral hemisphere pilocytic astrocytoma is extremely rare. This case suggests that interhemispheric fissure SAH, not associated with aneurysm or abnormal vascularity, could originate from small, low-grade glioma in the superficial cerebral hemisphere."
CD009372,0,19289288,0,Fenestration of the middle cerebral artery with an associated ruptured aneurysm.,"Intracranial arterial fenestrations are uncommon developmental anomalies that may alter local hemodynamic stress patterns and may be associated with intracranial aneurysms. A 75-year-old woman presented with a mild subarachnoid hemorrhage. Cerebral angiography demonstrated a 5 mm aneurysm arising from the middle cerebral artery (MCA) associated with a dramatic fenestration of the proximal M1 segment of the MCA. The patient underwent craniotomy with microsurgical aneurysm clipping. The aneurysm arose immediately distal to the fenestration. Several fine perforating arteries were dissected away from the neck of the aneurysm to allow for safe clip placement. Postoperatively, the patient awoke without deficit and was discharged to home on the fifth postoperative day in good condition. Anomalies of the intracranial vasculature are common and we describe a rare proximal MCA fenestration with an associated ruptured aneurysm at the site of the fenestration. Neurosurgeons should be thoroughly familiar with such potential ""normal variants"" to avoid operative complications that may result from the anomalous circulation in such cases."

CD009372,0,23824352,0,[A rare case of developmental venous anomaly with diffuse arteriovenous shunt in the posterior fossa presented as massive cerebellar hemorrhage].,"Developmental venous anomalies(DVAs), that have been previously called venous malformation, are extreme variations of normal transmedullary veins that are necessary for the drainage of white and gray matter. They are becoming the most commonly encountered intracranial vascular lesions in central nervous system imaging. Most DVAs are asymptomatic or uncomplicated, and surgery is no longer considered necessary. The author describes a rare case of an 8-year-old patient presenting with massive cerebellar hemorrhage due to DVA with diffuse arteriovenous(A-V)shunt. Cerebral angiography demonstrated diffuse A-V shunt from the basilar artery runs into the bilateral basal vein of Rosenthal through the enlarged transpontine vein. Caput medusae-like appearance was visualized, although the finding of nidus was not obvious. Moreover, three-dimensional computed tomography angiography demonstrated stenosis in part of the drainage routes. Then, we supposed that this lesion was a transitional form between a DVA and an arteriovenous malformation, and massive cerebellar hemorrhage might be caused by secondary venous hypertension due to venous stenosis. A careful follow-up should be made, because the prognosis of DVA with A-V shunt has not been fully elucidated."

The medical records of 92 patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease attended during the period from 1985 to 2003 were reviewed. The following data were recorded: age at diagnosis, gender, associated clinical manifestations, occurrence of stroke, age at loss of renal function (beginning of dialysis), and presence of a family history. The involvement of abdominal viscera was investigated by ultrasonography. Intracranial alterations were prospectively investigated by magnetic resonance angiography in 42 asymptomatic patients, and complemented with digital subtraction arteriography when indicated. Mean age at diagnosis was 35.1 +/- 14.9 years, and mean serum creatinine at referral was 2.4 +/- 2.8 mg/dL. The most frequent clinical manifestations during the disease were arterial hypertension (63.3%), lumbar pain (55.4%), an abdominal mass (47.8%), and urinary infection (35.8%). Loss of renal function occurred in 27 patients (mean age: 45.4 +/- 9.5 years). The liver was the second organ most frequently affected (39.1%). Stroke occurred in 7.6% of the patients. Asymptomatic intracranial aneurysm was detected in 3 patients and arachnoid cysts in 3 other patients.

CD009372,0,9117074,0,Severe stroke.,"Severe stroke is an emergency and requires rapid neurological assessment and diagnosis. CT scan is the first diagnostic step with the aim of finding out the extent, localization and possible pathophysiology of ischaemia in order to direct specific diagnostic and therapeutic options. An intracranial haemorrhage must be excluded. Early CT signs, including the size of the hypodensity and brain swelling, are important prognostic markers. Extracranial and transcranial Doppler sonography are valid for primary assessment of vascular pathophysiology and haemodynamics in most cases. Cerebral angiography should be performed if acute occlusion of the basilar artery or middle cerebral artery trunk is suspected and intra-arterial thrombolysis is a potential therapy. Intravenous thrombolyis has been proven to be effective in improving outcome in severe stroke; it is safe if the exclusion criteria are strictly applied. Prevention of secondary complications of stroke include general medical treatment with control of blood pressure, infections and cardiac and respiratory function, anti-coagulation. anti-oedematous treatment and surgical decompressive therapy for cerebellar and MCA space-occupying infarcts. Monitoring in the ICU is recommended. The medical therapy of intracerebral haemorrhage consists of control of ventilation and blood pressure, seizure prevention and anti-oedema treatment. Treatment of secondary ICH due to anti-coagulation or thrombolysis consists of administration of specific antidotes and the correction of the coagulopathy. Ventricular drainage should be performed when there is marked ventricular dilatation due to obstruction or blood in the ventricles. Most patients with cerebellar haemorrhage of more than 3 cm in diameter should undergo surgery to avoid brain-stem compression and hydrocephalus. In younger patients, non-dominant hemisphere putaminal and lobar haemorrhages with lateral displacement of midline structures and extensive oedema should be evacuated if the patient's level of consciousness deteriorates rapidly, or if the elevation of ICP cannot be controlled pharmacologically, and herniation is incipient. New techniques such as stereotactic and endoscopic evacuation still need to be tested prospectively. Patient selection for surgery should be cautious considering age, clinical status and possible contraindications such as cerebral amyloid angiopathy and coagulation disorders. Stroke therapy is rapidly becoming a focus of research and major changes in diagnostic and therapeutic options can therefore be expected."

CD009372,0,10540722,0,[Cases of cavernous hemangioma discovered in patients with post traumatic intracerebral hematoma].,"Cavernous haemangioma has various forms. The cases with spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage are most common, but post-traumatic intracerebral haematoma was not reported. The aim of this report is to present cases of cavernous haemangioma with unusual clinical course. In seven patients with post-traumatic intracerebral haematoma, fragments of histologically confirmed cavernous haemangioma tissue situated in the place of haematoma were found. In one case, delayed intracerebral haematoma twenty four hours after trauma and initial CT-scan was observed. On the initial CT-scan in this patient only traumatic changes in the brain without haematoma or tumour were present. In our cases, cavernous haemangioma was situated most frequently in frontal and temporal region, shown as haematoma usually 24 hours after trauma, mainly in men in age range 30-44 years with disorders of consciousness (GCS 11). As the result of operation, the majority of patients (6 out of 7) were discharged as self-independent. The authors reviewed the literature for cavernous haemangioma. The tumour may be present in any region of the brain including infratentorial region. The lesion is disclosed most frequently in children as spontaneous brain haemorrhage and rarely as seizures or intracranial hypertension. Final diagnosis is based on cerebral angiography or MRI. CT-scans are not typical and before the appearance of haematoma do not suggest the presence of tumour. Surgical removal of haematoma with tumour fragments is the main method of therapy, but radiation is possible in order to diminish the mass. The authors conclude that in each patient with post-traumatic intracerebral haematoma, the presence of cavernous haemangioma is possible."

MR angiography was technically satisfactory in 20 of the 23 patients and documented patency of the right internal carotid artery proximal to the ophthalmic artery in nine of 16 patients with permanent carotid ligation and in all four patients with reanastomosis. This study suggests MR angiography is feasible in newborns and infants and that, in combination with parenchymal MR imaging, it provides a sensitive, noninvasive method to assess vessel patency and follow cerebrovascular and parenchymal changes in infants after ECMO."
CD009372,0,3875699,0,Intraventricular hemorrhage in a term neonate secondary to a third ventricular AVM. Case report.,"An initially healthy infant born of an uncomplicated full-term gestation was brought for evaluation of the acute onset of vomiting, irritability, lethargy, and opisthotonus at 14 days of age. Computerized tomography demonstrated an intraventricular hemorrhage. Arteriography defined an angioma on the roof of the third ventricle which was successfully removed via the transcallosal interfornicial approach on the 34th day of life. Other than an easily controlled seizure disorder, the postoperative course was uneventful. At 8 months of age the child is developing normally. Arteriovenous malformations should be considered in the differential diagnosis of intraventricular hemorrhage in full-term neonates without predisposing trauma or bleeding diathesis. High-speed digital subtraction arteriography may be used to screen for this diagnosis. The transcallosal interfornicial exposure offers a satisfactory approach for excising third ventricular angiomas in young infants."
CD009372,0,10203099,0,Role of positron emission tomography in determining the extent of CNS ischemia in patients with sickle cell disease.,"Nearly 25% of patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) experience central nervous system morbidity involving both large and small vessel disease. Optimal imaging methods for determining the extent of ischemia are not known. Positron emission tomography (PET) has the unique ability to show tissue function as well as structure. Reports concerning patients with non-SCD neurodegenerative disorders suggest PET may be useful in determining prognosis. We compared magnetic resonance imaging, magnetic resonance angiography, and neuropsychological testing with PET prospectively. Six patients with SCD and a history of stroke, aged 10 to 28, were enrolled. PET studies were performed on an ECAT HR 47 scanner (Siemens/CTI, Knoxville, TN) using 18-F-fluorodeoxyglucose as a tracer. PET interpretations were conducted in blinded fashion. MRI studies found two patients with only small vessel disease and four with both large and small vessel disease. In two of four subjects with large vessel disease, PET showed a corresponding metabolic abnormality and also identified an area of hypometabolism extending beyond the anatomical lesion as shown by MRI. PET did not demonstrate an abnormality corresponding with small vessel disease. Detailed neuropsychological testing demonstrated cognitive dysfunction in all cases. For some patients, PET may add sensitivity in detecting impaired metabolism in the area surrounding a major vessel infarct. However, the technique does not appear to be generally useful in characterizing small watershed or deep white matter infarcts. Larger studies, to include control subjects and carefully selected untransfused SCD patients, are needed. A combination of conventional imaging and neuropsychological testing remains the preferred evaluation for most SCD patients with neurologic symptoms."
CD009372,0,7885013,0,[Neurological complications in infectious endocarditis].,"Despite considerable progress in both diagnostic studies and therapeutic management serious complications of infectious endocarditis have become rather more common. Next to intracardiac complications arterial embolization to the central nervous system is the second most common life-threatening event, which might lead to infarction, hemorrhage, mycotic aneurysm and/or metastatic infection with a wide spectrum of neurological symptoms and an overall very poor prognosis. The most effective prevention of neurological complications is the early diagnosis of infectious endocarditis with isolation of the infecting agent and adequate antimicrobial chemotherapy in combination with well-timed cardiosurgical measures. Computed tomography and cerebral angiography is mandatory in any patient with neurological symptoms to check the need for a neurosurgical intervention as well as in patients assigned for anticoagulation for cardiac reasons."

This series shows that although cerebrovascular disease in children is uncommon, it is likely that cases will occasionally present acutely to an ED. The emergency physician's role in the management of suspected acute strokes in children is that of immediate stabilization, imaging to rule out hemorrhage, other studies to rule out emergent acute disease, and timely consultation for further management. Computed tomography (CT) is useful to detect an acute hemorrhage or old ischemic lesion. Magnetic resonance imaging has superior image resolution over CT, but CT may be more practical initially.

The most significant Doppler findings of the middle cerebral artery included no detection of the artery when occlusion of the carotid siphon or the middle cerebral artery at its origin was shown by angiography and reduced flow velocities and asymmetry (symptomatic less than asymptomatic) when the occlusion was located in the terminal tract of the middle cerebral artery mainstem or in numerous terminal branches. Higher flow velocities in the anterior cerebral artery or posterior cerebral artery, mostly in the symptomatic hemisphere, often accompanied middle cerebral artery pathology, probably indicating collateral compensatory pathways."
CD009372,0,7719689,0,Case report: radiation-induced vasculopathy implicated by depressed blood flow and metabolism in a pineal glioma.,"A case of radiation-induced vasculopathy of a pineal glioma was presented with haemodynamic and metabolic changes before and after radiotherapy. After radiation of 60 Gy with conventional fractionation (1.8-2.0 Gy daily, 5 days per week), regional blood flow, oxygen extraction fraction, metabolic rate of oxygen, kinetic metabolic rate of glucose and the rate constants (K2, K3) were markedly depressed (20% or greater) compared with the pre-irradiated study. 7 months after radiotherapy, the patient developed transient transient episodes of both right and left upper limb convulsion, terminating in generalized convulsion. When she developed status epilepticus, computed tomography showed extensive low density areas in the territory supplied by the right middle cerebral and the right posterior cerebral arteries. Cerebral angiography revealed diffuse stenosis at both carotid bifurcations and at the origins of the right posterior communicating and posterior cerebral arteries. Haemodynamic and metabolic depression therefore implicated radiation-induced vasculopathy in the present case."
CD009372,0,7351580,0,Efficacy of transfusion therapy for one to two years in patients with sickle cell disease and cerebrovascular accidents.,"Since 1974 we have entered 12 children with sickle cell disease and strokes on a transfusion protocol to maintain hemoglobin S less than 20%. Serial arteriography, EEGs, brain or CT scans, and neuropsychologic testing were also obtained. Transfusion has been stopped in ten patients after one to two years. Seven of these ten patients have had second strokes five weeks to 11 months after cessation of transfusion (median three months). Arteriography was normal at the time of the initial stroke in two patients; one of these had a second stroke. Arteriograms did not improve during transfusion therapy. EEGs and brain and CT scans were occasionally useful at the time of the initial stroke but were of little value in following these patients. Neuropsychologic testing indicated severe impairment of sensory-motor and cognitive processes at the time of the initial stroke and was useful in following improvement or deterioration and in designing remedial education programs. We conclude that short-term transfusion therapy will not prevent second strokes once transfusion is stopped and that arteriography is of limited value in these patients."
CD009372,0,7064602,0,[Technic of ultrasonic dopplerography in the diagnosis of occlusive lesions of the arteries of the base of the brain (doppleroangiographic study)].,"Use was made for the first time of the ultrasonic dopplerography method for diagnosing occlusions of the brain base arteries in patients with cerebrovascular diseases. For this purpose a functional-compression examination technique was developed that enabled one to evaluate indirectly the patency of the intracranial arteries. Dopplerographic criteria of occlusions of individual arteries were determined. A comparison of the diagnosis made with the use of the ultrasonic dopplerography with the data of subsequent cerebral angiography showed that the results coincided in 83.3% of occlusions in the basilar arteries; 90% of occlusions in the terminal parts of the vertebral arteries: 90% of occlusions in the anterior and posterior communicating arteries; 86% of occlusions of internal carotid arteries in the siphon region, and 80% of occlusion of the median cerebral arteries. The results obtained give one grounds to recommend the ultrasonic dopplerography for practical use as a simple and sufficiently reliable method for diagnosing occlusions of the brain basin arteries."
CD009372,0,9297930,0,Cerebral arteriovenous malformations in children: neuroimaging findings.,"Cerebral arteriovenous malformations (CAVMs) are uncommon in children. CAVMs represent the most frequent intracranial vascular pathology at pediatric ages. This report concerns 13 children below the age of 16; all were identified between September 1995 and December 1996 with 14 CAVMs among them. All were proved by conventional cerebral angiography (CCA). Thirteen computed tomography (CT), 7 magnetic resonance images (MRI), 2 magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and 13 conventional cerebral angiography (CCA) were analyzed. Most CAVMs nidus were located in cerebral hemispheres. Four in the temporal lobe, two in the parietal lobe, three in the frontal lobe, two in the occipital lobe, and three in the corpus callosum. One of them was of a mixed type with two nidi. The major clinical features of CAVMs were intracranial hemorrhage and seizures. Experience here was that MRI is superior to CT in showing the exact anatomic relationships of the nidus and in demonstrating the extent of CAVMs nidus obliteration after treatment. MRA provided a noninvasive means of studying blood vessels and vascular pathology in relationship to the CAVMs nidus. Standard angiography is still necessary to characterize in-flow and out-flow of vessels in CAVMs when definitive treatment is considered."

CD009372,0,20450093,0,[Pitfall in the interpretation of head CT and CT angiography].,"With the continuous increase in the volume of clinical imaging data continues to increase, there is an increasing demand for efficient and the capable people who can make accurate diagnosis on the basis of imaging findings. In general, errors in the interpretation of routine brain imaging, which is used as a screening tool, can be categorized as either perceptual or cognitive. Minimizing errors in the image interpretation is extremely essential for superior diagnostic and patient care. While performing head CT, it is important to consider the anatomical site and imaging aspects that may lead to false-positive and true-negative interpretation. In this manuscript, we discuss and present example of the various pitfalls of interpreting head CT images. With the knowledge of the process of image interpretation process, it is important to evaluate symmetrical findings such as brain edema, the median site such as the para-sellar region, the superior and inferior border images, and beam hardening artifact of the posterior fossa. In addition, CT angiography is being widely used as diagnostic tool for the cerebrovascular disease such as intracranial aneurysm. In this manuscript, we discuss the precaution that should be taken during the diagnosis of intracranial aneurysm with CT angiography findings."

CD009372,0,3431694,0,"Size determination of supratentorial arteriovenous malformations by MR, CT and angio.","Twenty patients with high-flow supratentorial arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) were studied by magnetic resonance imaging (MR), computed tomography (CT), and selective cerebral angiography. The size of the malformation measured on MR was found, in general, to be smaller than the size determined from angiographic films. This discrepancy increased as the size of the AVM increased. AVM size on CT and angiography was found to be essentially equivalent. The reason for these differences between MR and CT or angiography was the ability to separate out the draining veins by MR, whereas this was difficult on projection films and contrast enhanced CT. Calcification was more easily detected by CT than by MR. MR better detected hemorrhage, which could be mistaken for old infarction on CT. Foci of cystic change within the nidus of the AVM were equally evident on MR and CT. Due to its sensitivity in discriminating between AVM nidus and adjacent draining veins and MR's ability to show the AVM in three planes, MR appeared to be more accurate in defining the AVM nidus than either CT or cerebral angiography. Such accurate delineation is crucial in patients prior to stereotactic radiosurgery."
CD009372,0,3652067,0,Rare neonatal intracerebral hemorrhage. Two cases in full-term infants.,"Intracranial hemorrhage in neonates is often found in either the subependymal area or the subdural space. The former is observed particularly in premature infants and is attributable to damage of the germinal matrix layer. The latter usually occurs in the vicinity of the falx and tentorium cerebri of full-term neonates and is thought to be caused by birth injury. Two cases of intracerebral hemorrhage in full-term newborn babies are reported. In both the hematoma was located at the left frontal area under the coronal suture. Angiograms revealed no causative signs, such as arteriovenous malformation, aneurysm or angioma. Observations on CT scans and during surgery led to the conclusion that the hemorrhages were caused by the moulding which forced the frontal bone to slip under the parietal bone at the coronal suture and then press on the fragile cerebral vasculature of the neonates, thus causing contusion."

CD009372,0,20950938,0,Factor XIII deficiency related recurrent spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage: a case and literature review.,"Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) in young adults under 50 years of age is an uncommon occurrence associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. The differential diagnosis of ICH in this population differs from that of older individuals and includes vascular, toxic, inflammatory, oncologic, infectious and hematologic conditions. We present a case based observation of a spontaneous and recurrent ICH in a 25-year-old female secondary to undetected Factor XIII (FXIII) deficiency with no prior associated stigmata of hematologic disturbance admitted to a tertiary care neuroscience intensive care unit (NICU). Our patient was admitted after spontaneous development of left thalamic hemorrhage with ventricular extension. Initial management included external drain placement (EVD) and fresh frozen plasma administration. Diagnostic evaluation was unrevealing including CT angiography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with venography, conventional cerebral angiogram, and hematologic and rheumatologic screens. Our patient recovered but represented 6 months later with five foci of spontaneous ICH. She underwent vascular, infectious, oncologic, hematologic, and rheumatologic evaluations. She expired secondary to ICH expansion with uncal herniation. The results of our investigation revealed markedly diminished FXIII activity. The pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment of this disease are reviewed. FXIII deficiency should be considered in a case of cryptogenic ICH presenting with multifocal, recurrent ICH and a normal coagulation profile. Early diagnosis and initiation of factor replacement therapy offer the best strategies to reduce the morbidities associated with this disease."
CD009372,0,1933499,0,Multiple intracerebral cavernous angiomas.,"Eight patients (seven women and one man) with multiple intracerebral cavernous angiomas (cavernomas), also known as angiomatosis cerebri, were examined with high-field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Although previous articles have referred to such cases, a series similar to the one reported here has apparently not been described in the radiology literature. The patients presented with seizures, progressive neurologic deficit or cerebral hemorrhage. In all eight cases the multiplicity of the lesions was an incidental finding in the magnetic resonance images. The MRI appearance of the cavernomas, although characteristic, is similar to that of other angiographically occult intracranial vascular malformations, in particular thrombosed arteriovenous malformations and mixed vascular malformations, as well as that of hemorrhagic metastases. Additional criteria, such as the absence of edema, the presence of calcifications and the temporal evolution of the cavernomas on serial scans, should allow cavernomas to be differentiated from hemorrhagic metastases. The exquisite sensitivity in detecting angiomatosis cerebri and the ability to show the evolution of internal hemorrhage in individual lesions make MRI the method of choice for diagnosing and following this condition."

Currently, the evaluation of cerebrovascular disorders involving arteriovenous shunting or retrograde flow is accomplished with conventional radiographic digital subtraction angiography, because of its high spatial and temporal resolutions.

CD009372,0,11305560,0,Two-dimensional thick-slice MR digital subtraction angiography for assessment of cerebrovascular occlusive diseases.,"Although spatial resolution of current MR angiography is excellent, temporal resolution has remained unsatisfactory. We evaluated clinical applicability of 2D thick-slice, contrast-enhanced subtraction MR angiography (2D-MR digital subtraction angiography) with sub-second temporal resolution in cerebrovascular occlusive diseases. Twenty-five patients with cerebrovascular occlusive diseases (8 moyamoya diseases, 10 proximal internal carotid occlusions, and 2 sinus thromboses ) were studied with a 1.5-T MR unit. The MR digital subtraction angiography (MRDSA) was performed per 0.97 s continuously just after a bolus injection of 15 ml of gadolinium chelates up to 40 s in sagittal (covering hemisphere) or coronal planes. Subtraction images were generated at a workstation. We evaluated imaging quality and hemodynamic information of MRDSA in comparison with those of routine MR imaging, non-contrast MR angiography, and X-ray intra-arterial DSA. Major cerebral arteries, all of the venous sinuses, and most tributaries were clearly visualized with 2D MRDSA. Also, pure arterial phases were obtained in all cases. The MRDSA technique demonstrated prolonged circulation in sinus thromboses, distal patent lumen of proximal occlusion, and some collateral circulation. Such hemodynamic information was comparable to that of intra-arterial DSA. Two-dimensional thick-slice MRDSA with high temporal resolution has a unique ability to demonstrate cerebral hemodynamics equivalent to that of intra-arterial DSA and may play an important role for evaluation of cerebrovascular occlusive diseases."

We aimed to determine if a change in the plain radiographic appearances of the GDC ball could accurately predict the presence of unstable angiographic occlusion. Paired GDC radiographs (in two planes) and cerebral angiograms, performed immediately after treatment and at follow-up or at two consecutive follow-up examinations, were retrospectively compared. Radiographs were assessed for the radiographic change (loosening, compaction or reorientation) in the coil-ball and angiograms for unstable aneurysm occlusion (neck recurrence or deteriorating occlusion). We compared 49 paired films from 38 patients. Radiographic change in the coil ball had a negative predictive value of 96%, positive predictive value of 57% and accuracy of 76% for the presence of angiographic aneurysm instability. It may be possible to increase the interval between follow-up angiographic examinations after GDC treatment safely if there is no change in the radiographic appearances in two planes."

The patient was discharged without neurological deficit. Ruptured aneurysms resulting in ASDH without SAH or ICH are very rare. Radiological investigation such as three-dimensional CT angiography should be performed to find the causative aneurysm in a patient with ASDH with a history of repeated headaches and without traumatic signs or episodes, and the appropriate treatment should be planned with expediency."

The diagnostic sensitivity of CT was higher. The considerable prognostic importance of the degree of consciousness disturbances and their duration is stressed. In the group of patients with lucidum intervallum the mortality was higher. Four patients were treated conservatively since CT demonstrated in them only small haematomas without displacement of the ventricles.

CD009372,0,9409437,0,Hemorrhagic type moyamoya disease.,"The clinical picture of hemorrhagic type Moyamoya disease was analyzed in 20 cases. Hematoma at the basal ganglia was noted in 40% of cases, intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) in 30%, thalamic hemorrhage with ventricular rupture in 15% and subcortical hemorrhage in 5%. The location was undetermined in two cases (10%) due to bleeding in the pre-computed tomography (CT) era. The frequencies shown above were correlated well to previous reports. In magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed 1 year or more after IVH, the primary bleeding site was demonstrated at the lateral wall of lateral ventricle, in portion density weighted and T2 weighted images. MRI can detect the site of old bleeding points and its chronological change if the study is repeated. In a follow-up period of 6.2 years, 35% of the cases had rebleeding once or twice. The second bleeding occurred seven times and the third twice. IVH occurred five times and the most common, basal ganglia hematoma three times while thalamic hemorrhage once. As a result, the rate of good outcome was 60% after the first bleeding and 40% after rebleeding. The mortality rate was 5% after the first 25% after rebleedings. Factors related to rebleedings and their poorer outcome are sex (with women being more susceptible), massive ICH and early recurrence. Rebleeding worsened the outcome. Therefore, prevention of rebleeding is important. From a therapeutic viewpoint, although a close relation between rebleeding and untreated hypertension could not be established, blood pressure control is critical at the both acute and chronic stages. Bypass surgery for bleeding type of Moyamoya disease seems to be less promising than ischemic type, even though a definite answer may not be obtained from our small number of cases."

Only little is known about their natural development. They are characterized by an unpredictable course with a possibility of causing secondary intracranial hemorrhage with significant morbidity and mortality. We present two cases of traumatic pseudoaneurysms of the middle meningeal artery (MMA) treated via endovascular coil occlusion and review of literature. Pseudoaneurysms of the middle meningeal artery carry a potential risk of rupture. They can be detected via a computed tomography angiogram (CT-A).

CD009372,0,17542541,0,Progressive perianeurysmal edema induced after endovascular coil embolization. Report of three cases and review of the literature.,"The authors report three cases of progressive vasogenic brain edema surrounding a cerebral aneurysm after endovascular coil embolization. In all three cases embolization was incomplete due to the aneurysms' large sizes and wide necks. Follow-up magnetic resonance imaging revealed de novo vasogenic brain edema surrounding the aneurysms 3 to 6 months after the initial treatment. The edema progressed in parallel with regrowth of the aneurysms. All three aneurysms were deep in the brain parenchyma and showed intramural enhancement, suggesting hemorrhage or inflammation. Each patient underwent a second embolization for the aneurysm regrowth, which resulted in improvement of the edema. Based on the findings in these cases and review of the literature, it is suggested that incomplete occlusion of larger aneurysms that are deep within the brain may lead to a disorganized intraluminal thrombosis, aneurysm pulsing, and intramural hemorrhage or inflammation, all of which are associated with brain edema following aneurysm recanalization and regrowth. It should be kept in mind that incomplete embolization of larger aneurysms may cause such malignant change and that this complication may occur after endovascular treatment."

The missing button sign (MBS) is defined as the absence of the ICA at the level of the foramen magnum on contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) scans. Two raters independently reviewed random CECT samples from consecutive patients with acute ischaemic stroke. A total of 399 patients with 798 carotid arteries were analysed. Rater A identified the MBS in 41 (5%) of the carotid arteries, and did not identify the MBS in 735 (92%) carotid arteries. Rater B identified the MBS in 45 (6%) of the arteries, and lack of the MBS in 731 (91%) arteries. The kappa value for agreement was 0.90 (95% CI 0.84-0.95). Compared with CT angiography, Rater A's sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for detecting proximal ICAO were 85%, 100%, 100%, and 99%, respectively, while Rater B's values were 87%, 99%, 93%, and 99%, respectively.

Relation to neuropathology and capillary ultrastructure.,"The present study investigates chronic changes in cerebral arterial vessel system, microvasculature, and brain histopathology using an adult rat model based on permanent and stepwise occlusion of four cerebral vessels. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) was performed to study chronic changes in arterial cerebral vessel system after permanent vessel occlusion. Long-lasting functional changes such as NMDA-, AMPA- and GABA(A)-receptor binding were detected in hippocampus and dentate gyrus using autoradiography. Structural changes in cerebral capillaries were investigated using light- and electron microscopy. Chronic cerebral oligemia did not cause any significant changes in the densities of excitatory glutamate and inhibitory GABA(A) receptors. By electron microscopy we could document, however, that most capillaries in vessel-occluded animals shrank, the endothelial cells were prominent with enlarged nuclei and increased cytoplasm, and the basal membrane was thickened. In contrast to the degenerative changes in brain capillaries, pronounced arterial collateralization was disclosed by DSA after chronic brain vessel occlusion. The model of chronic occlusion of four cerebral vessels is characterized by capillary degeneration and arterial collateralization proceeding in parallel. Thus, this rat model may be useful in investigations of long-lasting compensatory mechanisms contributing to cerebrovascular or neurodegenerative disorders."

However, certain conditions may not be accurately reflected by the ICD-9 codes. We assessed the accuracy of ICD-9 coding for cerebrovascular disease by comparing ICD-9 codes in an administrative database with clinical findings ascertained from medical record abstractions. We selected patients with ICD-9 diagnostic codes of 433 through 436 (in either the primary or secondary positions) from an administrative database of patients hospitalized in five academic medical centers in 1992. Medical records of the selected patients were reviewed by trained medical abstractors, and the patients' clinical conditions during the admission (stroke, TIA, asymptomatic) were recorded, as well as any history of cerebrovascular symptoms. Results of the medical record review were compared with the ICD-9 codes from the administrative database. More than 85% of those patients with the ICD-9 code 433 were asymptomatic for the index admission. More than one-third of these asymptomatic patients did not undergo either cerebral angiography or carotid endarterectomy. For ICD-9 code 434, 85% of patients were classified as having a stroke and for ICD-9 code 435, 77% had TIAs. For code 436, 77% of patients were classified as having strokes. Limiting the identifying ICD-9 code to the primary position increased the likelihood of agreement with the medical record review. The ICD-9 coding scheme may be inaccurate in the classification of patients with ischemic cerebrovascular disease. Its limitations must be recognized in the analyses of administrative databases selected by using ICD-9 codes 433 through 436."
CD009372,0,2424544,0,Cortical hypoperfusion as a possible cause of 'subcortical aphasia'.,"This study was designed to investigate whether aphasia in stroke patients with subcortical lesions ('subcortical aphasia') was due to the subcortical lesion itself or to dysfunction of cortical language zones. A consecutive series of 25 right-handed stroke patients with left hemisphere lesions verified by CT scanning were examined for aphasia in the acute stage, and two weeks, three months and six months after the insult. Cerebral angiography, CT scan and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) measurements with the 133Xe intracarotid method were performed in the acute stage. The CT scan was repeated six months later. Seven patients had lesions which involved cortical structures. All of these were severely aphasic in the acute stage and six months later. The rCBF studies showed severe reduction of flow in the infarcts; the perfusion was incompatible with tissue viability. Eighteen patients had subcortical lesions. Eight of these were midly to severely aphasic in the acute state. Recovery was always excellent. Five patients recovered completely, while 3 showed only discrete (clinically undetectable) aphasia after six months. The rCBF demonstrated low-flow areas in the cortex overlying the deep lesions, with a blood flow which was sufficient for tissue viability, but insufficient for normal tissue function (an 'ischaemic penumbra'). The blood flow was pressure dependent (showing impaired autoregulation) in these low flow areas. Ten patients with subcortical lesions were not aphasic. Their CBF was normal. The subcortical lesions were permanent on CT scan while aphasia was transient in these patients as recovery was seen within three months. It was therefore unlikely that the subcortical lesions as such were the cause of aphasia. The present findings indicate that aphasia in patients with subcortical lesions may be due to hypoperfusion and functional loss in cortical language zones. The cortical low-flow areas were invariably confined to occluded vascular territories. These territories were kept viable by collateral circulation characterized by penumbral flow and impaired autoregulation. The patients showed excellent recovery from aphasia. We suggest that the recovery of language is caused by spontaneous arterial recanalization or expansion of collaterals, giving rise to enhancement of flow in the hypoperfused cortical penumbra."

Clinical assessment by bedside evaluations is limited, especially in patients initially in poorer clinical condition or who are receiving sedative medication for whom deterioration may be more difficult to identify. Transcranial Doppler is a useful screening tool for middle cerebral artery vasospasm, with less utility in evaluating other intracranial vessels. Computed tomographic angiography correlates well with digital subtraction angiography. Computed tomographic perfusion may help predict DCI when used early or identify DCI when used later."

CD009372,0,1785389,0,[Urological management for stroke patients; relation between brain lesions and establishment of micturitional modality].,"A total of 154 stroke patients, 96 males and 58 females, were analyzed to establish the micturitional modality according to the type of detrusor function and the level of activities of daily living (ADL). All patients had only one episode of stroke attack and were checked at least one month after the onset. Localization of cerebral lesion in each patient was evaluated by neurological findings and cerebral angiography in addition to computed tomography of the brain. In the patient groups classified according to the type of detrusor function, micturitional modality was established in 50% of the patients with the underactive type, 70% of those with the overactive type and in 88% of those with normal function. This suggests that the overactive and normal type of detrusor function may not affect establishment of micturitional modality. On the other hand, when classified according to the level of ADL, none established micturitional modality in patients with poor ADL. By contrast, in the patients on higher levels of ADL who were able to transfer themselves from or to a wheel-chair without any assistance it was established in 75%, and in those who were able to gait with or without a brace upon discharged from the hospital, in 91%. It is concluded that establishment of micturitional modality in stroke patients is closely related to the level of ADL or function of lower extremities, but not to localization of the brain lesion."

First patient was a 28-year old woman on oral contraceptive treatment for a month who was referred to our Department with sudden-onset conscious level deterioration after presenting 24 hours previously with headache, vomits and hemiparesis. Computed Tomography revealed a predominant hypodense area containing hyperdense foci causing mild mass effect and midline-shift in keeping with a haemorrhagic infarction occupying almost completely the right frontal lobe. On CT, magnetic resonance (MR) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) there was a prominent tubular structure adjacent to the hematoma in keeping with a partly thrombosed vessel. Urgent craniotomy and partial hematoma evacuation was performed. Digital subtraction angiography confirmed the presence of a filling defect within the draining vein of a typical caputmedusae pattern developmental venous anomaly (DVA). Systemic anticoagulation was started and four days after surgery sedation was reversed and the patient awoke with normal conscious level although mild (4/5) hemiparesis persisted. Second patient was a 38-year old male evaluated in the Emergency Department due to tonic-clonic seizures in the left side followed by altered sensation in the same distribution. Initial CT revealed an intracranial bleed. After contrast administration there was an anomalous vessel in the same location that was confirmed angiographically represented a partly thrombosed DVA.

Case report.,"A 77-year-old woman was admitted to a local hospital with a 7-day history of vertigo and nausea, followed by gait disturbance. Magnetic resonance imaging showed extensive brain edema with a hemorrhagic component in the right cerebellum. The lesion was heterogeneously enhanced after administration of contrast medium. The presumptive diagnosis was malignant glioma based on these findings, as well as the presence of mass effect and abnormal enhancement. She was referred to our hospital. However, cerebral angiography did not reveal tumor stain or arterial occlusion, but confirmed corkscrew-like venous collaterals and absence of opacification of the superior petrosal vein (SPV) and superior petrosal sinus. Topography of the brain edema was consistent with the drainage territory of the SPV. These findings suggested that the lesion was vasogenic edema caused by thrombosis of the SPV. The patient was conservatively treated without anticoagulation therapy, and the neurological and imaging abnormalities resolved spontaneously. To avoid unnecessary biopsy, thrombosis of the SPV should be considered in the differential diagnosis of infratentorial lesion mimicking brain tumors.

The optic nerve, measuring 4 cm in length, was attached to the enucleated eye ball, but there was neither a wound in his eyelids nor cerebrospinal fluid leakage from inside the orbit. He was confused, but responsive and was able to recognize other persons with his right eye. His right-eye vision deteriorated within 24 hours and was almost totally lost for about one month. Three months after the trauma his vision recovered to 0.1, but his visual field showed severe concentric narrowing. An emergency CT on admission showed a small subarachnoid hemorrhage in the suprasellar cistern, and follow-up CT scanning on day 7 demonstrated a small infarction in the left globus pallidus and putamen. Cerebral angiography performed on day 17 showed residual vasospasm of the horizontal portion of left anterior cerebral artery. Left ophthalmic artery was patent and there was no aneurysm formation either on the intracranial or on the intraorbital arteries. Literature review yielded only three cases of eye ball enucleation by an assailant. Intracranial complications reported in the literature, including those associated with eye ball enucleation caused by other mechanisms, are; contralateral visual field defect: seven cases, hypothalamic involvement: two cases, subarachnoid hemorrhage: two cases, cerebrospinal fluid leakage: one case, and meningitis: one case. The optic nerve, from just behind the eye ball to the chiasm, is reported to be 40-50 mm long, and eye ball enucleation with the optic nerve measuring 4 cm or more is quite likely to cause intracranial complications such as are cited above."

Sixteen (group 1) showed lacunar capsular infarcts, and 5 (group 2) either ""giant lacunae"" or ""striatocapsular infarcts"". Angiography showed that 81% of group 1 and all group 2 patients had ipsilateral severe stenosis or occlusion of either the M1 segment of the middle cerebral artery or the internal carotid artery. Ten group 1 patients and 3 group 2 patients also had contralateral intra- or extracranial carotid artery stenosis. Apart from hypertension, other risk factors such as hyperfibrinogenaemia, polycythaemia, and low HDL-cholesterol level seem to play a role. Haemorheological abnormalities in the presence of atherostenosis at the orifice of lenticulostriate arteries and/or artery-to-artery embolism might be the cause of infarcts in the majority of the patients. A fifth of patients had recurrent large ipsilateral infarcts. Thus capsular lacunar syndromes with prior ipsilateral TIA or RIND are not as benign as previously thought, and they should indicate more intensive studies including cerebral angiography, and more vigorous therapy."

Six patients had extracranial arterial obstruction, all correctly diagnosed by Doppler. Six children had obstruction of the middle cerebral artery, four were indirectly predicted by Doppler. Four of these twelve patients had extra-intracranial bypass surgery. The patency of the anastomosis could be documented in all cases by Doppler. Ten children had arterio-venous shunts. Of these, 7 patients with an av-angioma and one patient with a carotid-cavernous-sinus fistula were diagnosed correctly by Doppler, as was the cessation of pathologically increased blood flow in the feeding and draining vessels in the 5 patients who had surgical intervention. cv-Doppler results were normal in 3 cases with normal angiography.

The efficiency of the ESS in the diagnosis of brain tumors and extracerebral hematomas in 295 neuroradiologically controlled cases out of an unselected number of patients during 1972-1974 is described. 3. Supratentorial brain tumors can be detected directly with the ESS by abnoramal reflections of the tumors as well as indirectly by displacement of intracranial reference structures, mainly the ventricular borders. In 239 cases of suspected brain tumor, 126 were neurodiologically confirmed as supratentorial brain tumors. Among these 126 brain tumors the correct localization was determined by the ESS in 86.5%. 4. The highest reliability of the ESS proved to be the direct demonstration of frontal tumors (93%), whereas space-occupying lesions near the midline could be shown only in 79%. Up to now there have been difficulties in the diagnosis of tumors situated near bony structures, e.g., calvarian meningiomas. 5. Subdural hematomas (56 patients) could be lateralized correctly in 93%. Hwever, direct demonstration of the border of the hematomas could be achieved only in 48,2%. Chronic subdural hematomas in children are easier to recognize and the border could be demonstrated in 18 out of 19 cases. 6.

CD009372,0,3515980,0,Fibromuscular dysplasia of the carotid arteries.,"Fibromuscular disease of the carotid artery was identified in 30 patients, which represented 3.2 percent of all patients who had cerebral angiography at Brooke Army Medical Center in the 6 year period from 1978 to 1984. Focal neurologic events were the presenting symptoms in 63 percent of the patients. The majority of the patients were treated with antiplatelet therapy, and eight patients had a total of 10 carotid artery dilatations. The only patients with recurrent symptoms were those who received either no treatment or antiplatelet therapy. There were no recurrent symptoms in the operated patients. This study suggests that surgical treatment for the symptomatic patient may prevent recurrent symptoms with an acceptably low morbidity and mortality. There was, however, no indication that prophylactic dilation of the fibromuscular disease in the asymptomatic patient was beneficial. Fibromuscular dysplasia of the carotid arteries is often associated with intracranial aneurysms, and surgical therapy rather than antiplatelet therapy may be advisable in patients who have intracranial aneurysms. Patients with concomitant atherosclerosis of the carotid artery bifurcation should be treated like any patient with atherosclerotic disease and an endarterectomy should be performed with carotid dilatation when indicated. Fibromuscular disease of the carotid artery is an infrequent angiographic finding that is associated with focal and global neurologic symptoms. Most patients can be effectively treated with antiplatelet drugs with no recurrent symptoms, however, for persistent or progressive symptoms, some patients will require surgical dilatation of the carotid artery. Fibromuscular disease of the carotid artery may lead to catastrophic symptoms of stroke or intracranial hemorrhage if left undiagnosed or untreated."
CD009372,0,15045609,0,Neuroradiologic differential diagnosis of cerebral intraparenchymal hemorrhage.,"Cerebral intraparenchymal hematoma (IH) is one of the most common causes of sudden onset of focal neurologic deficit. This is particularly true in the acute phase, in which IH appears hyperdense compared to the cerebral tissue. By three to four weeks, it becomes isodense with the cerebral gray matter and hypodense within 2 to 6 months. After contrast media administration, IH shows a peripheral ring of enhancement owing to the breakdown of the blood brain barrier. On magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the appearance of IH depends upon the paramagnetic effects of the different derivates of hemoglobin and both the magnetic field strength and type of sequences used. In the hyperacute phase, IH appears hyperintense on T2 and hypointense on T1 owing to the presence of oxyhemoglobin. In the acute phase, IH is hypointense on T2 and iso-hypointense on T1 as a consequence of the presence of deoxyhemoglobin, which is converted into methemoglobin by 3 to 5 days. Methemoglobin has a strong paramagnetic effect, so in this phase IH becomes hyperintense on T1 and hypointense on T2. After 2 weeks, methemoglobin is converted in hemosiderin, responsible of the ring of hypointensity surrounding the lesion on T2WI. When an IH has been diagnosed, someone should think about the origin of bleeding. Among the different differential diagnosis, one should think about the possible origin, taking into account some parameters, such as: anamnestic data, site of the lesion, number of lesions, appearance on CT and MRI, and presence of perilesional edema. Computed tomography is a reliable and very fast tool for the diagnosis of IH, but MRI is able to provide additional information about the spontaneous or secondary nature of the hematoma, thus allowing a better characterization of the hemorrhagic lesion."

It is classified into two from etiological standpoint i.e. primary and secondary (most often seen after lumbar puncture). On the other hand, low spinal fluid pressure is one of the promoting factors of chronic subdural hematoma. We report 2 cases of primary low spinal fluid pressure syndrome (primary intracranial hypotension) associated with chronic subdural hematoma. Case 1 is a 47-year-old man who was admitted with disorientation following 2 week history of orthostatic headache. Spinal fluid pressure was 7mmH2O in the lateral recumbent position. CT scan revealed bilateral isodense chronic subdural hematoma. The subdural hematoma reaccumulated 17 days after the first operation. Case 2 is a 31-year-old woman who was admitted with 4 week history of progressive orthostatic headache accompanied by nausea and vomiting. Spinal fluid pressure was 0 mmH2O. CT scan and cerebral angiography showed bilateral chronic subdural hematoma. The hematoma reaccumulated 20 days after the first operation. Six cases including our two cases of primary intracranial hypotention associated with chronic subdural hematoma have been reported. When changes of characters of headache, especially mental symptoms and disturbances of consciousness occurred in patients with chronic orthostatic headache, association of chronic subdural hematoma should be suspected. In cases with chronic subdural hematoma associated with low spinal fluid pressure syndrome, the reaccumulation of hematoma tends to occur after burr hole opening and irrigation of hematoma."

One hundred ten (64.3%) MS patients and 30 (38%) HCs presented ≥2 venous hemodynamic CCSVI criteria (p<.0001). Both DS and MRV showed relatively high specificity but lower sensitivity for determining a CCSVI diagnosis in patients with MS vs HCs and between MS subgroups. In MS patients this diagnostic specificity increased to over 90% by combining internal jugular vein and vertebral vein abnormal DS and MRV findings, reflux in deep cerebral veins and MRV findings of >1 collateral veins.

CD009372,0,11201540,0,Pediatric cerebrovascular disease.,"Stroke in children is thought to be a rare phenomenon, but in a pediatric hospital, it is much more common than is expected. The development of rapid MRI imaging with diffusion techniques and MR spectroscopy has brought to the attention of both the neuroradiologists and clinicians that pediatric infarction, in both detection and management, are challenges for the future. Since 1995, cerebral diffusion has been performed at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia in the evaluation of patients with acute cerebral compromise. Diffusion imaging looks at the motion of water molecules both intra- and extracellular, and the manner in which they become restricted in their motion when higher gradient strength is applied during the imaging sequence. Restricted diffusion is seen in cytotoxic edema, an early acute manifestation of ischemia/infarction. Diffusion studies are often positive when routine MRI and CT are as yet negative. Confirmation of the death of tissue is provided on proton spectroscopy by a rise in lactate from anaerobic glycolysis and a loss of N-acetylaspartate from neuronal death. Confirmation of the diffusion image findings, by mapping the apparent co-efficient (ADC), is also valuable. Application of these techniques, together with magnetic resonance angiography and magnetic resonance venography, is the substance of this paper."

An aneurysm was disclosed on a second angiogram in 4 cases, and on a third angiogram in 1, giving a total false negative rate of 5%. In 55% of cases, only a small amount of SAH was present on CT. The distribution of the subarachnoid blood was nonspecific and resembled the pattern seen in aneurysmal SAH. Ninety-four percent of the patients presented in Hunt-Hess grades I and II. The complications of conservative treatment were few: a rebleed rate of 4%, delayed cerebral ischemia in 4%, cerebral infarcts in 8% and hydrocephalus requiring shunting in 3%. On discharge, 93% of patients had recovered completely and the others were left with moderate disability. There were two deaths related to massive rebleeding.

Any apparent decrease is attributable to a higher rate of CT scanning, by which other haemorrhagic conditions are excluded. Most patients are <60 years of age. Risk factors are the same as for stroke in general; genetic factors operate in only a minority. Case fatality is approximately 50% overall (including pre-hospital deaths) and one-third of survivors remain dependent. Sudden, explosive headache is a cardinal but non-specific feature in the diagnosis of SAH: in general practice, the cause is innocuous in nine out of 10 patients in whom this is the only symptom. CT scanning is mandatory in all, to be followed by (delayed) lumbar puncture if CT is negative. The cause of SAH is a ruptured aneurysm in 85% of cases, non-aneurysmal perimesencephalic haemorrhage (with excellent prognosis) in 10%, and a variety of rare conditions in 5%. Catheter angiography for detecting aneurysms is gradually being replaced by CT angiography. A poor clinical condition on admission may be caused by a remediable complication of the initial bleed or a recurrent haemorrhage in the form of intracranial haematoma, acute hydrocephalus or global brain ischaemia. Occlusion of the aneurysm effectively prevents rebleeding, but there is a dearth of controlled trials assessing the relative benefits of early operation (within 3 days) versus late operation (day 10-12), or that of endovascular treatment versus any operation. Antifibrinolytic drugs reduce the risk of rebleeding, but do not improve overall outcome. Measures of proven value in decreasing the risk of delayed cerebral ischaemia are a liberal supply of fluids, avoidance of antihypertensive drugs and administration of nimodipine. Once ischaemia has occurred, treatment regimens such as a combination of induced hypertension and hypervolaemia, or transluminal angioplasty, are plausible, but of unproven benefit."
CD009372,0,15912770,0,[A case of systemic Lupus erythematosus complicated with multiple subcortical hemorrhage].,"We described a case of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) complicated with multiple intracerebral hemorrhage. A 52-year-old female with no history of hypertension had been treated with steroid hormone therapy for more than 15 years. Four days before admission, she experienced acute onset of headache and nausea. On the day of admission, the patient suffered from headache and nausea again followed by a deteriorated level of consciousness. The computed tomographic scan revealed two subcortical hematomas in the right frontal and left temporo-occipital area with atypical findings compared to those of the usual intracerebral hemorrhage. Cerebral angiography demonstrated that cortical arteries around the hematomas were markedly stretched and displaced. Multiple segmental stenosis and irregular lumen of the internal carotid artery and bilateral cortical arteries were possibly representative of vasculopathy. Transit time of blood flow was severely delayed with no apparent obstruction of the cerebral arteries, veins and dural sinuses. These findings suggested the existence of severely increased intracranial pressure. Emergent surgical evacuation of the hematomas was successfully performed with a favorable outcome for the patient. Intraoperatively, the brain was congested even after the evacuation of the hematomas. Surgical manipulation was able easily to cause bleeding from the cavity of the hematomas, which was hard to control. It is supposed that vasculopathy including fibrinoid degeneration and vasculitis may have affected the susceptibility of small arteries and veins to rupture in the present case. Subsequent increase of intracranial pressure might cause another hematomas by adding of hemodynamic stress to small vessels apart from those at the site of the first hemorrhage."

CD009372,0,7754116,0,[Magnetic resonance angiography of the intracranial circle using magnetization transfer contrast (MTC)].,"Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA) is becoming an accurate technique to study vascular conditions, especially when the intracranial circulation is involved. Nevertheless, the contrast-to-noise (C/N) ratio in MRA images is often inadequate to obtain diagnostic images. C/N ratio can be increased by using magnetization transfer contrast (MTC), the technique which allows to reduce the signal from the stationary tissues surrounding vascular structures. To demonstrate the value of MTC, 10 healthy volunteers and 10 patients with different cerebral vascular conditions were examined. All exams were performed using 3D MOTSA (Multiple Overlapping Thin Slab Acquisition) Time of Flight sequences, with and without MTC. A quantitative analysis was carried out in the images with and without MTC, measuring the signal intensity value in the regions of interest at the vascular and stationary structures. A qualitative analysis was also carried out with a double blind study by two independent radiologists. Our results showed that MTC allows to reduce stationary tissues signal intensity, without affecting flowing blood signal intensity. Therefore, the C/N ratio is increased, thus allowing better depiction of smaller peripheral branches. In conclusion, MTC applied to intracranial MRA allows image quality to be markedly improved, with an overall increase in the diagnostic accuracy of this technique."

Angiograms from 125 patients with cerebral AVMs were evaluated, and 15 (12%) had intranidal aneurysms. All 15 patients had a history of bleeding. Five patients underwent particulate or liquid embolization before surgical excision of or radiation therapy for the AVM. All aneurysms were thrombosed at the time of embolization. Ten patients underwent radio-surgery alone. Eight of the 10 underwent angiographic follow-up (mean, 33 months); seven patients showed complete obliteration of the AVM without residual aneurysm. Histologic evaluation showed intranidal aneurysms to be thin-walled vascular structures, and they are the likely site for AVM hemorrhage. Embolization is an effective method for achieving thrombosis of the intranidal aneurysm and may be beneficial in patients undergoing radiation therapy because of a long latency period between treatment and thrombosis of the AVM."

CD009372,0,22787001,0,Recognizing false ischemic penumbras in CT brain perfusion studies.,"Computed tomography (CT) plays a pivotal role in the diagnosis of acute stroke and in treatment decision making. CT perfusion imaging performed with intravenous iodinated contrast material allows calculation of the time to peak enhancement, mean transit time, and cerebral blood volume, important parameters for differentiating between an ischemic penumbra, which might benefit from intravascular therapy with thrombolytic agents, and infarcted tissue, which would not benefit from such therapy. Differentiation between the two entities is important because thrombolytic therapy is associated with an increased risk for intracranial hemorrhage. A finding of delay in peak enhancement or increased mean transit time in a region with normal or only slightly abnormal cerebral blood volume is suggestive of an ischemic penumbra; however, accurate interpretation of the CT perfusion parameters may be difficult in the presence of a cerebrovascular anatomic variant or physiologic condition that produces benign oligemia leading to a false appearance of penumbra. For this reason, CT perfusion parameters must be correlated with the clinical history and findings at unenhanced head CT, angiography or CT angiography, and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. The authors identify five possible causes of false penumbras, each of which produces a different pattern at imaging: upstream flow restriction, evolution of ischemic change, vascular dysregulation, positioning of the patient's head at an angle during image acquisition, and variant anatomy in the circle of Willis. Familiarity with the imaging patterns and causes of false penumbras may increase the radiologist's confidence in diagnosis and help avoid costly errors in treatment."

A male neonate, the product of a precipitious, instrumented, footling breech delivery, exhibited seizures at the age of 18 hours. A computerized tomography scan of the head showed hemorrhage along the tentorium with a globular component at the incisura. Transfontanel Doppler ultrasound examination detected pulsatile arterial flow within the globular mass. Cerebral angiography demonstrated a 1.5-cm saccular aneurysm arising from a small distal branch of the superior cerebellar artery. The pathogenesis of aneurysms in children is obscure and controversial. Birth trauma may be responsible for some pediatric aneurysms that are currently classified as idiopathic or congenital, particularly aneurysms in the region of the tentorial incisura."
CD009372,0,2311610,0,Synthesized image processing in clinical neurosurgery.,"In an effort to achieve efficient image management in clinical neurosurgery utilizing a local image filing system (EFPACS, Fuji Electric Co., Ltd), adequate image-processing and display techniques were developed. One is a method whereby the anatomical location of the thalamic and basal ganglion lesions is determined by automatically superimposing these lesions defined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) directly onto the Schaltenbrand-Wahren's human brain atlas. Horizontal, coronal and sagittal MR images are initially obtained based on the intercommissural line and a perpendicular erected on the midcommissural point as the basic reference coordinates. Precise superimposition is accomplished by the use of these reference axes. This imaging technique may offer the potential for help in anatomical identification of small intracranial lesions. Another technique described in the current communication is automated synthesis of two cerebral angiograms. By simply indicating two reference points, nasion and inion, with a cursor on the display screen, two films are automatically superimposed and displayed as a single synthesized image, featuring two different vascular phases simultaneously by a positive(vein)-negative(artery) mode. This technique was applied to patients with complete occlusion of the middle cerebral artery with or without sufficient blood flow through collateral circulation and was found useful in evaluating basic hemodynamics on a single angiographic image."

Blood supply to the anterior cerebral circulation is most commonly through enlarged basilar and posterior communicating arteries. Occasionally collateral flow is through abnormal transsellar anastomoses or anastomoses between the external carotid and intracranial systems. Associated intracranial aneurysms occur in 25% of patients, accounting for a significant incidence of intracranial hemorrhage as the initial symptom. Diagnosis is best made by cerebral arteriography with computed tomography to verify the congenital nature of the abnormality by demonstrating the absence of carotid canals. This is the second case to begin with transient ischemic attacks suggestive of carotid territory ischemia but originating from the vertebral system. Angiographic findings included absent internal carotid arteries, small common carotid arteries, and bilateral high-grade stenoses at the origins of large vertebral arteries.

CD009372,0,16001811,0,[Non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema induced by non-ionic radiographic contrast media during the coil embolization for a ruptured cerebral aneurysm].,"We describe a 48(correction of 44) year-old woman, who presents a non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema caused by non-ionic radiographic contrast medium. She suffered from subarachnoid hemorrhage due to dissecting aneurysm of right vertebral artery. Cerebral angiography followed by coil embolization for the aneurysm was performed. During the interventional procedure, saturation of blood oxygen suddenly declined and chest X-ray photography obviously revealed pulmonary edema. At first we dealt with it as neurogenic phenomenon but subsequently interpreted it to non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema induced by radiographic contrast medium, since intra-arterial injection of contrast medium at follow-up angiography led the symptoms into more fulminant status. Intensive care including endotracheal intubation and continuous positive airway pressure ventilation consequently achieved complete remission and the patient discharged without any sequelae. Although low osmolar, non-ionic contrast medium has been regarded as relatively safe, severe reaction such as dyspnea, hypotension and cardiac arrest could emerge at certain intervals. We must perceive the adverse effects of it because the usage of contrast medium will dramatically increase with development of diagnostic radiographical methodology and interventional neurosurgery."
CD009372,0,9228109,0,Developmental venous anomalies of the posterior fossa with transpontine drainage: report of 3 cases.,"Developmental venous anomalies (DVA) are considered as variant patterns of cerebral venous drainage. Although generally not rare in the cerebellum, DVA of the brain stem or of the cerebellum with drainage through the brain stem are exceptional findings. Because it is not clear whether DVA may sometimes be of clinical significance, we try to correlate the clinical findings of the patients with the course of the variant vessels. We reviewed the literature and report three additional cases. All patients were examined by MRI and digital subtraction angiography. In particular, we discuss the drainage route as compared with the established patterns of posterior fossa blood drainage, which is directed to the dural sinuses, the petrosal vein or the vein of Galen. In one of our patients suffering from trigeminal neuralgia, the close topical relation of the DVA and the trigeminal nucleus and trigeminal nerve entry zone suggests a causal relationship. In a second case the brain stem symptoms were due to haemorrhage of a concomitant cavernoma. It remains unclear if the occurrence of dysarthria and dysaesthesia in the third patient with brain stem DVA was purely coincidental. The only clinical symptom directly attributable to a DVA with transpontine drainage in our series was trigeminal neuralgia."
CD009372,0,8539440,0,Postcontrast 3D-TOF-MR angiography of intracranial venous angiomas.,"The clinical value of three-dimensional time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography (3D-TOF-MRA) was assessed in 15 patients with intracranial venous angiomas (VAs), by comparing results thereof with those of postcontrast T1-weighted MR images (MRIs). All 15 VAs were identified both on the postcontrast MRIs and MRAs. The MRAs surpassed the MRIs in imaging entire structures, including the draining veins of the supratentorial VAs. For the infratentorial VAs, the MRAs and the MRIs were of equal value. Although the addition of MRA to the MRI procedure incurs more time and expense, the complete structure of the VA can thereby be identified three-dimensionally on MRA. Conventional angiography is apparently not required for the confirmation of a VA. Thus, it is concluded that MRA is very useful for diagnosing VAs."
CD009372,0,1285924,0,MR imaging of the internal carotid artery in ischemic cerebrovascular disorders--clinical and angiographic correlation.,"This study was intended to correlate the appearance of the cavernous segment of the carotid artery on MR images with the presence of significant stenosis or occlusion of the cervical carotid artery as seen on angiograms in 37 patients with cerebrovascular disorders who had brain MRI and arteriography. Three patients demonstrated an isointense signal within the carotid artery's cavernous segment, correlating with complete carotid occlusion as seen angiographically. Ten patients had variable signal intensity and/or luminal narrowing in the carotid siphon; seven of these findings correlated with angiographic evidence of carotid occlusion, while carotid branch occlusion was seen angiographically in the other three. The demonstration of normal signal void within a normal-appearing cavernous segment of the internal carotid artery in the remaining 24 patients correlated with an absence of significant stenosis within the cervical segment in 21 patients. In the remaining three, significant disease of the internal carotid artery was found. Isointensity or luminal irregularity within the intracranial carotid artery can indicate complete occlusion or slow flow. The presence of normal flow void in the intracranial segment does not exclude significant abnormality of the cervical segment of the carotid artery."

Twenty-seven chronic stroke patients underwent either dynamic CT or intravenous digital subtraction angiography (IVDSA), and single photon emission CT (SPECT). We placed symmetric regions of interest as appropriate in each study, and obtained a peak time of each regional time-density curve in IVDSA or dynamic CT, and a laterality index of reconstructed counts in SPECT. Right-to-left difference of peak time significantly correlated to the laterality index both in IVDSA and dynamic CT (r = -0.88, p < 0.001, and r = -0.82, p < 0.001, respectively). Thus, time-density curve study well reflected unilateral reduction of cerebral perfusion.

Of 4,814 participants in the population-based Heinz Nixdorf Recall Study, 327 reported CHD (i.e., previous coronary bypass surgery, angioplasty); of those, 160 patients (mean age 66.4 years) were examined using MR of the brain, the heart (excluding the coronary arteries), and whole-body MR angiography. The prevalence of each vascular pathology was assessed, correlated to the others and compared to patients' histories. Of the 160 CHD patients, 16 (10%) showed MR signs of stroke, and 77 (48.1%) had a stenosis >50% in at least one extracerebral peripheral artery (other than the coronaries), including 28 (17.5%) with relevant renal artery stenoses, and 20 (12.5%) with relevant extracerebral internal carotid artery stenoses. False negative histories were reported in 12 of 81 cases with myocardial infarctions, and in 11 of 16 cases with cerebrovascular infarctions.

All patients underwent color Doppler sonography before proceeding to echo-enhanced color Doppler sonography. Diagnoses were confirmed by additional imaging (computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, angiography, and scintigraphy) performed as appropriate, with or without histologic study. An additional 20 children did not proceed to echoenhanced color Doppler sonography as color Doppler sonography alone was found to be sufficiently diagnostic. Levovist (SHU 508A), a contrast agent based on galactose-encapsulated air microbubbles, is approved for pediatric applications in Austria and was used as the echo-enhancing agent. Echo-enhanced color Doppler sonography was performed a total of 63 times in 51 patients (mean age, 9.8 years). Compared to color Doppler sonography, echo-enhanced color Doppler sonography either detected or enhanced visualization of pathologic conditions in 55 investigations (87.3%), yielding an overall accuracy of 95.2% (sensitivity, 95%), versus 65.7% with color Doppler sonography. One spinal arteriovenous malformation, one cerebral cavernoma, and one liver lesion were missed. The contrast material was easy to administer; no adverse reactions were observed. We conclude that echoenhanced color Doppler sonography is beneficial in pediatric sonography. It enhances visualization of vessels and perfusion, thus offering a nonionizing imaging tool for detection and follow-up evaluation of pathologic conditions with disturbed vasculature in specific cases. In infants and in persons with superficial lesions it did not offer significant advantages over color Doppler sonography."
CD009372,0,7731504,0,Dissecting aneurysms of the basilar artery.,"Ten patients (six men and four women; mean age, 40 yr) with spontaneous dissection of the basilar artery are reported. Clinically, six were admitted with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and four were admitted with brain stem ischemia. Angiography demonstrated string sign in four patients, pearl reaction in four, double lumen in one, and arterial ectasia with mural retention of contrast medium in one. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed in two patients. Follow-up angiograms or magnetic resonance angiography in six patients showed spontaneous healing in two patients, improvement in two, progression in one, and no change in one. Nine patients were treated medically, and one underwent selective intravascular occlusion of the dissecting aneurysm. One patient died after further SAH, two remain severely disabled, three have residual neurological deficit, and four are in good clinical condition. The most interesting observations in this series include a relatively good course in a substantial number of patients and low further bleeding potential after SAH, the late ""globular"" evolution, which may be favorable for reconstructive treatment, and the diagnostic value of associated computed tomographic/angiographic findings. Surgical options in basilar dissection are very poor; in some reported cases, wrapping has been tried with disappointing results. In light of the possibility of spontaneous healing or improvement, wrapping should be reserved for only those patients with recurrent SAH or angiographic progression of the dissection."

CD009372,0,571560,0,Noninvasive diagnosis of extracranial cerebrovascular disease: oculoplethysmography-phonoangiography and directional Doppler ultrasonography.,"The ability of two noninvasive diagnostic methods--oculoplethysmography-carotid phonoangiography (OPG/CPA) and directional Doppler ultrasonography--to detect extracranial cerebrovascular disease was examined in 400 consecutive studies. Cerebral arteriography was performed in 74 patients. Transient ischemic attack was the most common indication for study (30%). The OPG was normal in 95% of cases in which the diameter of the lumen of the internal carotid artery (ICA) was less than 60% reduced; the ocular pulse was delayed in 86% of cases with ICA stenosis of 60% or more. The overall diagnostic accuracy of OPG was 93%; CPA did not enhance the accuracy of OPG alone. Supraorbital Doppler tests detected 88% of cases of ICA stenosis of 60% or more, but there was a 13% false-positive rate with ICA stenosis of less than 60%. Supratrochlear Doppler tests had only a 1% false-positive rate, but detected only 48% of significant ICA stenoses. Doppler studies were most often abnormal in the presence of ICA occlusion. Thus, OPG was as sensitive as supraorbital Doppler and more sensitive than supratrochlear Doppler in detecting hemodynamically significant ICA stenoses, without the unacceptable false-positive rate observed with the supraorbital Doppler test."
CD009372,0,13677803,0,Adults and children with headache: evidence-based diagnostic evaluation.,"Headache represents one of the most common complaints in the outpatient and emergency room setting [1]. Most causes of headache are benign and do not require emergent imaging or intervention. The authors' review of the diagnostic tests does not offer absolute indications for neuroimaging because most of the evidence is based on studies that are not randomized controlled trials. Imaging guidelines for adults and children, however, have emerged based on the available level 2 and 3 literature. CT imaging remains the initial test of choice for new-onset headache in adults and headache suggestive of SAH. Most of the available literature also recommends performing lumbar puncture when CT is equivocal in ruling out SAH [1]. The sensitivity of MR imaging appears to be less than CT for SAH [1]. Newer MR imaging techniques need to be tested and developed to determine if they have higher sensitivity than CT or lumbar puncture in the detection of SAH. In adults with suspected brain metastatic disease, contrast-enhanced MR imaging is the imaging study of choice [38,39]. Contrast-enhanced MR imaging is the examination of choice for brain metastatic lesions less than 2 cm [39]. CT angiography and MR angiography have sensitivities greater than 85% for brain aneurysms larger than 5 mm [43]. If clinically warranted, aneurysms smaller than 5 mm may require digitally subtracted angiography because of the low sensitivity of MR and CT angiography. In children, the choice of diagnostic test strategy depends on the risk group. In high-risk patients, MR imaging is the test of choice whereas in low-risk patients, close clinical observation with periodic reassessment is the best strategy [44]. Clinical diagnosis will always play a key role in the evaluation of headache disorders; however, for the small subset of patients who present with headache secondary to an intracranial space-occupying lesion, bleeding, or SAH, making the diagnosis is crucial to decreasing morbidity and mortality. CT, MR imaging, and lumbar puncture play important roles in the assessment of headache disorders, but their future roles will continue to evolve as the technology becomes more sophisticated and robust, and physicians become more expert with their use [1]."
CD009372,0,22749486,0,[Loss of consciousness after a minor trauma revealing an aneurysm rupture in a child].,"In pediatrics, concussions are common after falls and are often banal. However, it is important to identify situations where a particular inquiry is essential. Cerebral hemorrhage and aneurysms, although more common in adults, can also occur the young. The best investigation for diagnosis is the brain CT scan. After a soccer head injury, a 13-year-old boy presented with headache, abdominal pain, and a feeling of being ill. Then, he quickly lost consciousness and had amnesia for several hours. On arrival, the clinical examination, including neurological testing was normal except for bradycardia and pallor. He then presented a severe meningeal syndrome. A CT scan showed cerebral hemorrhage at the left sylvian fissure and in the posterior fossa. MR angiography confirmed subarachnoid hemorrhage and made and us suspect an aneurismal lesion in the emergence of the left sylvian artery. Cerebral hemorrhage is rare in children (about 1.4/10,0000 per year), 18% of which are pure meningeal forms. In the cases of intraventricular or subarachnoid hemorrhage in children, it is essential to complete the assessment by angiography because the risk of underlying aneurysm is then 57%. Among children with aneurysm, 35% will have bleeding from aneurysm rupture, especially during adolescence. Cerebral aneurysms are usually not familial. A family screening should only be performed when two cases or more of intracerebral aneurysms are reported in first- or second-degree relatives. In this case, the best investigation is cerebral MR angiography."

It seemed to the author that moyamoya disease appeared to be prone to cause PIVH, this hemorrhage being likely due to ischemic malacia in the ventricular wall. The tortuous, abnormal network vessels ruptured and bled as a result of infarction and damage of the walls of the miliary aneurysms. PIVH might be divided into two types: the panventricular hemorrhage and partial ventricular hemorrhage, according to the amount of blood that filled into the ventricles. 6 cases of the panventricular type were fatal. The symptoms were in conformity with the traditional concept of the most critical, intraventricular hemorrhage. The external ventricular drainage in combination with lumber puncture drainage would be the better way of treatment for these patients. 14 cases of the partial ventricular hemorrhage type showed the clinical features of acute subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The treatment was similar to SAH too, and the prognosis was much better. It would be worth noting that moyamoya disease should be a factor not to be neglected in causing PIVH."

CD009372,0,6179227,0,Non-invasive studies of the extra-cranial cerebral arteries: indication for angiography and operation.,"During recent years, the risk involved in cerebral angiography has been considerably reduced. However, in our patient group this risk was still almost as high as that involved in operation. Non-invasive examination by means of the ultrasonic Doppler procedure has been improved with a resulting success rate of over 95%. Color coding stored in a computer program with the ""Echoflow""-procedure allows for demonstration of the neck vessels giving an indication of the degree of stenosis. By this method, pictures of document quality are provided which can also be obtained by inexperienced examiners and interpreted more easily than curve registrations of the acoustic signals. In comparison with angiography, the Echoflow method was less sensitive than the conventional ultrasonic Doppler procedure especially in cases of low-degree stenosis of the internal carotid artery. Nevertheless, in 2.7% of the cases, a correct Echoflow diagnosis could be confirmed during operation where angiography had not shown the changes correctly. As the Echoflow procedure does not give sufficient information on intracranial pathology, we have so far dropped angiography in emergency cases only when establishing the indication for operation; however, in follow-up examinations this method is used exclusively instead of angiography."

CD009372,0,1510352,0,New magnetic resonance techniques for evaluating cerebrovascular disease.,"Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of acute stroke has made important contributions to diagnosis. Several novel MR technologies, now in preclinical and clinical development, will contribute to stroke diagnosis and perhaps help to guide therapy. MR angiography is the most clinically advanced new MR technology and offers the clinician a method to image noninvasively the extra- and intracranial vasculature. Diffusion-weighted MR imaging can demonstrate ischemic lesions quantitatively within minutes of onset in experimental stroke models, and human application is proceeding. Perfusion MR studies can reveal the presence or absence of cerebral perfusion in specific arterial territories. MR spectroscopy can assess tissue metabolites in vivo and reveal changes in these metabolites associated with ischemic injury. The combination of these new MR techniques should provide a plethora of information about the extent of ischemic lesions, associated vascular and perfusion deficits, and metabolic consequences. This information will afford the clinician the opportunity to assess and subtype ischemic stroke patients more rapidly and could be used to monitor therapeutic responses."

We performed a computerized PubMed search of the literature from inception to 27 July 2011 to find reports of similar comparative studies and performed a meta-analysis of diagnostic accuracy. The pooled sensitivity was 97.0% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 93.2-99.1%), specificity was 98.9% (95% CI: 97.0-99.7%), accuracy was 98.2% (95% CI: 96.6-99.2%), positive predictive value was 97.8% (95% CI: 94.2-99.5%) and negative predictive value was 98.5% (95% CI: 96.6-99.5%). The false negative rate was 1% (95% CI: 0.4-2.6%). We concluded that CTA with venography could replace DSA as the initial vascular investigation in patients presenting with spontaneous ICH during the acute phase. Future studies should focus on whether refinement of the techniques could preclude the false negative results."
CD009372,0,19779285,0,Arteriovenous fistula arising from the persistent primitive olfactory artery with dual supply from the bilateral anterior ethmoidal arteries.,"A 59-year-old male presented with generalized seizure. The patient had not been aware of any traumatic head injuries or preceding infection, and had no contributory medical history. On admission, he was alert and well oriented, without neurological impairment or headache. He was afebrile and blood examination showed no abnormal findings. Computed tomography revealed an irregular intracerebral hematoma, 3 x 1.5 cm in diameter, in the left rectal gyrus. Cerebral angiography showed an arteriovenous fistula (AVF) in the anterior cranial fossa supplied only by the persistent primitive olfactory artery (PPOA) originating from the anterior cerebral artery, forming a shunt to an ascending cortical vein, and drained by the superior sagittal sinus. The patient underwent endovascular obliteration of the AVF via the transarterial route. Immediately after successful isolation, angiography showed that the bilateral anterior ethmoidal arteries supplied the AVF. The feeding branches from the left anterior ethmoidal artery were completely occluded via the ophthalmic artery, but introduction of the catheter into the right ophthalmic artery markedly decreased the stump pressure. Follow-up angiography performed at 3 and 8 weeks following embolization showed spontaneous resolution of the residual AVF without findings of recanalization or new abnormal channels. AVF arising in the anterior cranial fossa may be associated with an unusual pattern of the blood supply when including the PPOA."

CD009372,0,17674417,0,The value of radio-anatomical features on non-contrast CT scans in localizing the source in aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage.,"Identification of the source of subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) can be a challenge in the presence of multiple aneurysms. This study was carried out to assess whether radioanatomical features on noncontrast enhanced computerised tomography (CT) scans may be of value in localizing ruptured intracranial aneurysms. The diagnostic CT scans of 56 consecutive patients, investigated for SAH with cerebral angiography, over a period of six months were available for review. Various radioanatomical features were assessed: (1) pattern of subarachnoid blood (e.g. predominant site and location near major vessel bifurcation), (2) presence of intraparenchymal haematoma, (3) presence of aneurysm contour and (4) hydrocephalus. On the basis of the findings an estimation of the anatomical location of the source of bleeding was made and then compared with the angiogram findings to which the reviewer was blinded. The location of the aneurysm was correctly identified in 89.5% of cases. Careful analysis of the pattern of bleeding was essential for the successful localization of the aneurysm in all these cases. The presence of an aneurysm contour was also associated with correct identification of the source of bleeding (chi(2) = 6.067, P = 0.02). Our findings suggest that radioanatomical features on CT scans in SAH can be a valuable aid in the correct identification of the location of the ruptured aneurysm. This would be of particular significance in the presence of multiple intracranial aneurysms."

However, the etiology was not apparent on CT angiography of the head. Catheter-based angiography was performed, demonstrating a single-hole, high-flow vertebrovertebral fistula, arising from the V2 segment and decompressing into both cervical and skull base venous structures. Definitive treatment consisted of endovascular fistula obliteration with a combination of coil and liquid embolic material. The patient made a full neurological recovery. High cervical and skull base fistulae are rare causes of intracranial hemorrhage; endovascular treatment is effective at disconnection of the arteriovenous shunt."

Twenty-two cases of nontraumatic SAH of unknown cause of a total of 254 cases of SAH treated during a 5-year period (1980-1984) were available for this study. A follow-up study (4 to 61 months after treatment; median, 43 months) revealed a 4.5% mortality rate. Four patients chosen from among the 22 SAH cases underwent prophylactic operation. The decision to operate was based on repeated angiography showing regional cerebral vasospasm corresponding to a limited hyperdense area on the computed tomographic scan at the time of the onset of SAH. Microsurgery revealed a minute protrusion (less than 2 mm in diameter) or thinning of the arterial wall with old hematoma of the surrounding brain in all 4 cases, and treatment required only coating of the abnormal site. All 4 patients are now fully recovered. Frequently, abnormal changes of such cerebral arteries as the anterior communicating artery, the internal carotid artery (C-1 and C-2), and the middle cerebral artery (M-1) may occur.

Clinically differentiating the 2 diseases on clinical grounds may be difficult. The main objective of this study was to identify predictors differentiating CVT from AIS in a large cohort of young Asian women, based on risk factors and investigations. Twelve centers in 8 Asian countries participated. Women aged 15-45 years were included if they had a diagnosis of first-ever symptomatic AIS or CVT confirmed by brain computed tomography scan or magnetic resonance imaging/magnetic resonance venography. Patients with head trauma, cerebral contusions, intracranial hemorrhage, and subarachnoid or subdural hemorrhage were excluded. Data, including demographic data, risk factor assessment, neuroimaging studies, blood tests, and cardiac studies, were collected by retrospective and then prospective chart review between January 2001 and July 2008. Outcome was based on the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score at admission, discharge, and latest follow-up. A total of 958 patients (204 with CVT and 754 with AIS) were included in the study. Age under 36 years, anemia, pregnancy or postpartum state, and presence of hemorrhagic infarcts on computed tomography scan or magnetic resonance imaging were significant predictors of CVT on univariate analysis. Age over 36 years, diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, recent myocardial infarction, electrocardiogram abnormalities, and blood glucose level >150 mg/dL were strong predictors of AIS. On multivariate analysis, postpartum state and hemorrhagic infarct were the strongest predictors of CVT (P < .001). Mortality was comparable in the 2 patient groups. Prognosis was significantly better for patients with CVT than for those with AIS (mRS score 0-2, 74% v 46%; P < .001). There was no difference in outcome between patients with obstetric and nonobstetric CVT. Our data indicate that in young Asian women, predictors of CVT differ from those for AIS. These findings could be useful in the early identification and diagnosis of patients with CVT."

To test the hypothesis that rebleeding and disability in angiogram-negative subarachnoid haemorrhage might be limited to those with other patterns of haemorrhage on initial computed tomography (CT), complications and long-term outcome were studied in 113 patients with angiogram-negative subarachnoid haemorrhage, admitted between January, 1983, and July, 1990. All patients were investigated with third-generation CT scans within 72 h of the event, and with cerebral angiography. The mean follow-up period was 45 (range 6-96) months. None of 77 patients with a perimesencephalic pattern of haemorrhage on CT died or was left disabled as a result of the haemorrhage (0% [95% confidence interval 0-5%]). Among the other 36 patients, who had a blood distribution on CT indistinguishable from that in proven aneurysmal bleeds, 4 had rebleeds and 9 died or were left disabled as result of the haemorrhage (25% [14-43%]). Thus, two distinct subsets of patients with angiogram-negative subarachnoid haemorrhage should be recognised. Patients with a perimesencephalic pattern of haemorrhage have an excellent prognosis. Rebleeding, cerebral ischaemia, and residual disability occur exclusively in patients with aneurysmal patterns of haemorrhage on initial CT. Repeated angiography in search of an occult aneurysm is justified only in the patients with aneurysmal patterns."

Tumors are responsible for about two-thirds of the temporal lesions and about one-half to one-third of the parietal and occipital lesions. With brain tumors a chronological sequence of two groups of signs and symptoms is the rule: first the focal symptoms corresponding to the tumor lesion in a defined cerebral area, later the distant effects of the increasing volume of the tumor, which lead to the general signs of increased intracranial pressure. The different types of homonymous hemianopia in tumor lesions along the suprachiasmatic pathway (optic tract, lateral geniculate body, temporal lobe, parietal lobe, occipital lobe) are described and discussed. The general neurological signs and symptoms are briefly reviewed.

Reducing progression of cognitive decline at the MCI stage could be an important strategy for preventing conversion to dementia. The goal of this work was to screen for clinical predictors indicating the prognosis of MCI comprehensively; therefore, we assumed vascular risk factors (VRFs), carotid stenosis, and white matter changes (WMC) to be independent predictors. A total of 257 patients with MCI underwent collection of VRF information, neuropsychological evaluation, computed tomography angiography (CTA) to investigate carotid stenosis, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to identify severity of WMC. After a 3-year follow-up period, the neuropsychological evaluation, CTA, and MRI were repeated to assess the progression of cognitive decline, carotid stenosis, and WMC. The conversion rate from MCI to dementia was 11.65% per year, and the conversion rate from MCI to Alzheimer's disease was 7.05% per year in our cohort. Cognitive decline (in terms of changes in Mini Mental State Examination scores) was associated with diabetes mellitus (p = 0.004), baseline WMC severity (p < 0.001), baseline carotid stenosis (p < 0.001), and WMC severity change (p < 0.001). Besides, diabetes, baseline WMC severity, baseline moderate-to-severe carotid stenosis, and carotid stenosis change during follow-up were predictors of conversion from MCI to dementia. Given the potential clinical predictors, our findings could imply that controlling blood glucose, removing carotid stenosis, and improving cerebral perfusion could be effective measures to delay cognitive decline in patients with MCI and prevent conversion from MCI to dementia."

The cerebro vascular system is implicated in the pathogenesis of many diseases of the cerebral white matter, for example, stroke, microcerebrovascular disease, and multiple sclerosis (MS). In our work, white matter lesions and vessels are depicted using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and extracted using image analysis techniques. We focus on measuring distance relationships between white matter lesions and vessels, and distribution of lesions with respect to vessel caliber. Vascular distance maps are generated by computing for each voxel the Euclidean distance to the closest vessel. Analogously, radius maps assign the radius of the closest vessel to each voxel in the image volume. The distance and radius maps are used to analyze the distribution of lesions with respect to the vessels' locations and their calibers. The method was applied to three MS patients to demonstrate its functionality and feasibility. Preliminary findings indicate that larger MS lesions tend to be farther from detected vessels and that the caliber of the vessels nearest to larger lesions tends to be smaller, suggesting a possible role of relative hypoperfusion or hypoxia in lesion formation."

Clinical , imaging, and transcatheter therapeutic aspects of neonatal cerebral vascular malformations are described. Symptomatic high-flow vascular malformations characteristically present with cardiac failure and associated systemic problems in the neonate, whereas infants typically present with macrocephaly and hydrocephalus and older children with hemorrhage, developmental delay, or focal deficits. Neonatal cerebral hemorrhage is typically primary or associated with immaturity, parturitional trauma, or coagulopathy. Likewise, cerebral ischemic lesions are more likely secondary to hypoxic, ischemic events than to thromboembolic or structural cerebrovascular occlusive disease. The role of the current noninvasive imaging modalities in each of these clinical problems is reviewed and illustrated."

A 58-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with left occipital headache. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed neither subarachnoid hemorrhage(SAH)nor cerebral infarction, but magnetic resonance angiography (MRA)revealed left VADA. Conservative treatment including pain relief and blood pressure control was provided. After 2 weeks, the dissecting lesion showed spontaneous improvement and occipital headache was gradually improving. However, 4 months after onset, the VADA showed growing aneurysmal dilatation. We therefore performed endovascular surgery (coil embolization with parent artery occlusion). Symptoms improved, and the postoperative course was uneventful.

CD009372,0,17533973,0,[Clinical applications of 3.0 T magnetic resonance system in the neuroradiological field].,"Recently, the introduction of 3 tesla (3T) magnetic resonance (MR) system for more sophisticated clinical applications has yielded in important benefits, especially in neuroradiology. The aim of this article is to illustrate the practical scientific applications of the 3T system in the neuroradiological filed. From the clinical point of view, we focused on the usefulness of 3T system for the diagnosis of several neurological disorders, such as brain tumors, vascular lesions, hemorrhagic lesions, acute cerebral infarcts and degenerative diseases. The greatest advantage of high-field MR system is a higher signal to noise ratio. This higher spatial resolution can provide precise anatomical information for brain tumor itself and its surrounding structures. Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) also benefits from the higher signal to noise ratio and offers useful information for tumor characteristics. Navigation system with diffusion tensor tractgraphy is also available for surgical operation of brain tumors. Parallel imaging enables to improve the quality of tractgraphy by reducing susceptibility artifacts. 3T TOF (time-of-flight) MR angiography (MRA) demonstrates superior depiction of intracranial aneurysms compared with that of 1.5T TOF MRA. 3T TOF MRA is also useful for the evaluation and follow-up of stenoocclusive diseases including moyamoya disease. Susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) is a BOLD (blood oxygenation level dependent)-sensitive method for visualizing anatomical features such as small cerebral veins in high detail. Therefore, 3T system has advantages for obtaining detailed, high spatial resolution images of the venous network. SWI is useful for detection of hemorrhagic lesions and early diagnosis of acute hemorrhagic infarcts. SWI also can detect embolus and evaluate functional changes showing dilatation of medullary veins in the area of acute cerebral infarcts. Neuromelanin imaging using 3T system can directly demonstrate the locus ceruleus and substantia nigra by the neuromelanin content and have the potential to become a powerful tool in Parkinson's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders with Parkinsonism. Hyperintense putaminal rim can be often observed in clinically normal subjects on fast spin echo T2-weighted images at 3T system. This finding should not be mistaken for multiple system atrophy. 3T MR system indeed offers new potential because of a substantial increase in signal intensity provided by the higher magnetic field. Routine neuroradiologic imaging would benefit from higher magnetic field. However, It is required that extended knowledge of clinical data in comparison with 1.5T system to elucidate the efficacy of 3T system in the neuroradiology."

It is difficult to diagnose cerebral infarction within 6 hours of their onset on CT findings. The following signs by Tomura would be important criteria for identifying embolic infarction in the middle cerebral and internal carotid arteries: (a) obscured outline or partial disappearance of the lentiform nucleus, (b) slight decrease in tissue density, (c) effacement of the cortical sulci.

CD009372,0,23542422,0,Towards robust deconvolution of low-dose perfusion CT: sparse perfusion deconvolution using online dictionary learning.,"Computed tomography perfusion (CTP) is an important functional imaging modality in the evaluation of cerebrovascular diseases, particularly in acute stroke and vasospasm. However, the post-processed parametric maps of blood flow tend to be noisy, especially in low-dose CTP, due to the noisy contrast enhancement profile and the oscillatory nature of the results generated by the current computational methods. In this paper, we propose a robust sparse perfusion deconvolution method (SPD) to estimate cerebral blood flow in CTP performed at low radiation dose. We first build a dictionary from high-dose perfusion maps using online dictionary learning and then perform deconvolution-based hemodynamic parameters estimation on the low-dose CTP data. Our method is validated on clinical data of patients with normal and pathological CBF maps. The results show that we achieve superior performance than existing methods, and potentially improve the differentiation between normal and ischemic tissue in the brain."

The main inclusion criteria were: National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score ≥10; treatment performed within 8 h from the onset of symptoms and no large hypodensity on CT; and occlusion of a major cerebral artery on the CT angiogram. An admission and a post-interventional NIHSS score were calculated for all patients by two different neurologists. Efficacy was assessed radiologically by post-treatment thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) scores and clinically by a 30-day Modified Rankin Scale (MRS) score. The mean duration of neurointerventional treatment was 84 min. All interventions were successful, with TIMI scores of 2 or 3 achieved in 100% of patients. There was one procedural complication in our series owing to a self-detached stent and one patient had a small asymptomatic basal ganglia haemorrhage. There was improvement of more than 4 points on the NIHSS score in 5 (72%) of the patients following treatment, of whom 4 (57%) had a 30-day MRS score of ≤2.

Our results showed that intracranial vessels were invariably better shown on MR angiography than on MRI. MRA and MRV were most useful in evaluating vascular distortions related to congenital brain malformations and intracranial tumors. MRA was valuable in detecting arterial narrowing but overestimated the degree of stenosis compared with conventional angiography. MRV was the technique of choice for evaluation of dural sinus and cerebral venous thrombosis and compression.

A 62-year-old right-handed bilingual gentleman, with a diagnosis of infective endocarditis, developed headache and became expressively aphasic in the English language. Three days later he was receptively and expressively aphasic in both English and Arabic. Cranial MRI scans showed a left-sided acute subdural haematoma with mass effect and midline shift. Contrast CT brain scans showed an enhancing speck adjacent to the clot and cerebral angiogram confirmed a distal middle cerebral artery aneurysm. He underwent image-guided craniotomy, evacuation of the subdural haematoma and excision of the aneurysm. Histopathological examination was consistent with an infectious intracranial aneurysm. Postoperatively his aphasia did not improve immediately. He had widened pulse pressure due to severe aortic regurgitation, confirmed on echocardiography. He underwent aortic valve replacement and mitral valve repair, following which his aphasia recovered gradually. Initially the recovery of his language was limited to Arabic. About a week later he recovered his English language as well. At 3-year follow-up he is doing well and has no neurological deficits. His aphasia has recovered completely.

Brain CT scan showed a low density area in the left subdural space with a mild midline shift. Magnetic resonance (MR) T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imagings revealed homogenous hyperintensity with a hypointense web-like structure in the subdural hematoma. Cervical MR angiography showed no abnormal lesion at the bifurcation of the bilateral common carotid arteries. Conventional cerebral angiography showed an avascular, crescent, space-occupying mass over the left hemisphere without an etiologic lesion of cerebral ischemia. CT perfusion imagings indicated reduced cerebral blood flow (CBF) and prolonged mean transit time (MTT) in the left middle cerebral artery territory underneath the subdural hematoma. No epileptic discharge was found in electroencephalogram. Operative findings indicated that the hematoma was encapsulated with thickened outer and inner membranes including paste-like materials, and the brain surface was intact. Postoperative CT perfusion imagings revealed normal CBF and MTT. The pathophysiological mechanism which the chronic subdural hematoma produces the transient neurological deficit is still uncertain. The mechanical pressure of the hematoma on the neighboring cerebral vessels may cause impairment of blood flow leading to cerebral ischemia and paralysis of function.

MRA and conventional angiography were assessed separately for evidence of stenosis or occlusion. Follow up MRI/MRA studies were also assessed for evidence of progression, regression or stability of the disease in these patients. In the carotid circulation, MRA made the correct diagnosis in 85% of the vessels evaluated with a sensitivity of 80.5% and a specificity of 94%. MRA was also found to show evidence of disease progression, more often than did MRI or the clinical condition of the patients."

They are frequently asymptomatic and often remain undiagnosed until they present with associated symptoms of headaches, seizures, neurological deficits, or hemorrhages. Occurrence of headache during pregnancy and labor is associated with several diverse etiologies, making definitive diagnosis extremely difficult. This case report describes the anesthetic management of a 31-year-old laboring patient who first complained of headache, then suffered an acute subarachnoid hemorrhage secondary to rupture of a previously undiagnosed AVM during emergent cesarean delivery."

CD009372,0,6595871,0,[Noninvasive measurement of cerebrovascular circulation with the scintillation camera. A neurologic nuclear medicine study].,"Repeated CBF-measurements can be performed after inhalation or intravenous injection of 133Xe. After the development of a bicompartmental model by Obrist et al. in 1975 atraumatic CBF-measurements became widely used but there were still some difficulties concerning the sensitivity of different flow-indices towards CBF changes in normals under test conditions or ischemia in stroke patients. Due to the ""slippage phenomenon"" mostly noncompartmental flow-indices are used for the detection of ischemic brain areas. In this study a scintillation camera, that is usually available in every nuclear medicine department, was used for atraumatic CBF-studies. A collimator consisting of hexagonal lead tubes (septa 0.2 mm thick; FWHM 1.7 cm in 10 cm) was constructed for this purpose. The obtained counting rate varied between 2432 and 9081 cps over the whole hemisphere and 116-1094 cps in regions of approximately 2.5 X 2.5 cm. In 31 patients with CVD CBF was measured with the intracarotid (i.c.) technique and 1 hour later after i.v. 133Xe-injection. Intravenous flow values were comparable to those obtained after i.c. 133Xe injection (fB X MFr = 0.904; p less than 0.001). In 12 of the used 13 regions also significant correlation coefficients were found. In order to estimate the reproducibility of the intravenous injection method CBF-measurements were performed in both hemispheres of 10 patients on two consecutive days. Highly significant correlation coefficients were found for hemispheric blood flow (r = 0.933; p less than 0.001) and temporal, frontotemporal, temporoparietal and praecentral regions, while in the high parietal, frontal and occipital region lower reporducibility was found. Normal CBF-values were obtained from 12 healthy volunteers (MF right hemisphere: 50.7 +/- 4.6 ml/100 g/min; MF left hemisphere: 50.6 +/- 4.6 ml/100 g/min). MF did not show any hyperfrontality, while F1 and the ISI gave highest flow values in frontal regions. The clinical status of 76 patients suffering from cerebral ischemia (68 with flow disturbances in one hemisphere, 8 with vertebrobasilar insufficiency) was estimated by a semiquantitative scorescale at time of admission and after an observation period lasting from 6 to 35 months. In each case CBF was measured twice: once in the subacute stage after onset of symptoms and once after the observation period. The duration of neurologic symptoms (TIA, RIND, CS) was compared to the obtained flow values. A significant relationship was found between the duration of symptoms and impairment of CBF, thus showing the prognostic value of intravenous CBF measurements.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
CD009372,0,14504847,0,Neurovascular MRI with dynamic contrast-enhanced subtraction angiography.,The first generation of digital subtraction MR angiography using thick-slab contrast-enhanced 2D projection techniques has confirmed the potential of MRI to produce noninvasive subsecond angiograms of the craniocervical circulation. As time-resolved techniques become more sophisticated and 3D acquisitions can be obtained with high isotropic spatial resolution we may start to see the demise of catheter angiography as a diagnostic procedure.
CD009372,0,6397697,0,Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): method and early clinical experiences in diseases of the central nervous system.,"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has undergone a rapid development which is still continuing. In this article a survey is given of the present status of this new diagnostic tool in the evaluation of diseases of the central nervous system. When atoms with uneven numbers of protons or neutrons in a homogeneous magnetic field are tilted against the main vector of this field by a radiofrequency pulse, nuclear magnetic resonance can be observed. During the relaxation of the little dipoles back to the direction of the underlying magnetic field, a resonance signal is generated. The superposition of variable field gradients enables the scanning of sectional images in the axial, frontal and sagittal plane. The variables of H+-magnetic resonance which can be utilized for imaging are: the proton density, the relaxation times T1 (spin-lattice) and T2 (spin-spin) and flow effects. While the proton density in organic tissue fluctuates only by some 10%, the relaxation times may vary by several hundred per cent. Tissue contrast, therefore, is mainly based on relaxation times differences. The image character can also be influenced by variations of imaging parameters (i.e. repetition rate, interpulse delay, read out or echo delay) in different imaging sequences, such as the spin-echo and the inversion recovery technique. Depending on these imaging parameters T1 and T2 will contribute to the signal to a varying degree. This fact is most important for the diagnostic information of MRI. In initial clinical experiences in the diagnosis of diseases of the central nervous system, MRI has demonstrated high sensitivity in the detection of lesions (such as oedema, neoplasms, demyelinating disease), but less significance in lesion discrimination. In spinal disease the direct sagittal imaging of MRI enables MRI-myelography without contrast medium, superior to conventional myelography in many cases. For detailed evaluation of disc disease, however, the spatial resolution still has to be improved. Promising results have been obtained from flow effects. Depending on the flow velocity of blood, vessels appear white with intensive signals (slow flow) or black due to low signal intensities (rapid flow). MRI-angiography including measurement of blood flow seems possible. MRI-contrast media are not yet available for routine clinical use. Promising results have been reported on the basis of rare-earth elements, such as gadolinium Gd3+. These substances decrease T1 and T2 with subsequent increase in signal intensity. Concerning harmful side-effects of MRI, three possible sources have to be considered: the static magnetic field, the changing magnetic field, and radiofrequency heating.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
CD009372,0,20029781,0,[Stroke].,"Ischemic stroke is a very frequent neurological disorder. It's incidence is increasing as western societies are aging. Effective therapies that reduce mortality and increase the chances of living symptom-free or, at least, in independence are available. Intravenous or intraarterial thrombolysis is an effective treatment with a number needed to treat of 6 if given within 4.5 hours after symptom onset. The safe use of thrombolysis requires an effective and repeatedly trained workflow established within a team of a neurologist and specialized nursing staff in an optimized environment (admission, imaging facility, laboratory, stroke unit). After peracute treatment, the patient should be transferred to a stroke unit. This unit is a spatially defined intermediate care unit with specifically trained personnel (physicians, nurses, therapists). Treating the patient in a stroke unit is as effective in improving outcome as thrombolysis and also reduces the length of hospital stay. In contrast to thrombolysis, which can be provided, on average, to only 5% of stroke patients, stroke unit care is applicable to most. The organization of medical care in most European countries and in Switzerland separate the acute phase from subacute rehabilitation and chronic stroke treatment. This can be highly confusing for the patient who, during the course of the disease, meets different physicians, nurses and therapists with often diverging opinions about prognosis and therapies. Consistent treatment approaches and patient/caregiver information is necessary and can only be implemented by providing a homogeneous pathway for continuous stroke care."

CD009372,0,8078609,0,Trigeminal neuralgia: differentiation between intracranial mass lesions and ordinary vascular compression as causative lesions.,"We investigated 164 patients who presented with trigeminal neuralgia as their initial symptom at our institute. Twenty-two patients (13.4%) had intracranial causative lesions other than vascular compression. There were 19 tumors (10 epidermoids, 5 meningiomas, and 4 neurinomas) and 3 vascular lesions (2 arteriovenous malformations and 1 aneurysm). Eleven patients (50%) demonstrated only trigeminal neuralgia without any other neurological deficits. Preoperative computed tomography could not identify any causative lesions in 6 of these 22 patients. In 3 of the 6 patients, a causative lesion was clearly detected only by magnetic resonance imaging, while in 1 of the 6 patients an arteriovenous malformation was detected by angiography alone. Intraoperatively tumor was encountered in 3 cases even though preoperative computed tomography could not detect any apparent causative lesions. A higher incidence of hypesthesia in the trigeminal nerve regions as well as a reduced corneal reflex was noted in patients with a mass lesion compared to those with vascular compression. We thus conclude that magnetic resonance imaging should be performed on all patients who complain of trigeminal neuralgia in order to rule out mass lesions, however, angiography is still considered useful for the diagnosis of some vascular lesions."

We report 3 cases of TIA in which the ischemic lesions were recognized on DWI at a later date (""late-imaged TIA""). Three men (average age, 72.7 years) were admitted to our hospital on complains of monoparesis or sensory disturbance in their right arms. On admission, no apparent ischemic lesion was detected by DWI; however, spotty lesions were apparent in the left precentral or postcentral gyrus on hospital days 2-5. The neurological symptoms resolved within 24 hours, and all the cases were clinically diagnosed as TIA. Carotid MRI revealed low-grade stenosis of the left internal carotid artery with atherosclerotic plaque, characterized as so-called ""vulnerable plaque"". These findings suggest that the carotid atherosclerotic plaque lead to artery-to-artery embolism. Carotid MRI is considered useful as an adjunct to other imaging modalities in the diagnosis of late-imaged TIA."
CD009372,0,3525871,0,The role of intravenous digital subtraction angiography in the evaluation of extracranial carotid artery disease. Can the decision for carotid artery surgery be made solely on the basis of its findings?,"This retrospective study compared intravenous digital subtraction angiography (IV-DSA) with conventional catheter angiography (CA) performed on 105 patients with suspected cerebrovascular disease. Comparisons were made considering CA as the ""gold standard."" Factors reviewed for correlation included carotid artery stenosis, ulceration, fibromuscular disease, vessel occlusion, and subclavian and intracranial lesions. Each IV-DSA was judged as to its quality. Eighty-seven patients (83%) had interpretable IV-DSA studies. IV-DSA differed from CA regarding stenosis on 46 carotid arteries (26%). Of 47 excellent quality IV-DSA studies, 18 (38%) were in disagreement with CA regarding stenosis. For the subcategory of patients having hemodynamically significant stenosis (greater than 50% luminal narrowing) according to CA, the sensitivity of IV-DSA was 85%. Specificity was 94% with an overall accuracy rate of 92%. The authors believe these high values are somewhat misleading. The IV-DSA interpretation of stenosis differed from CA in 32 of 48 patients (67%) in this group with a mean difference of 30%. IV-DSA identified 3 of 11 intracranial lesions (27%). Surgical therapy was modified in 13 of 87 patients (15%) on the basis of angiographic interpretation of carotid artery stenosis compared with IV-DSA. We conclude that IV-DSA should be used as a screening tool and the decision for carotid artery surgery made solely on its findings should be reached with the knowledge of its limitations and that any patient with hemispheric cerebral symptoms warrants CA as the first diagnostic examination."
CD009372,0,14968401,0,Factors leading to hydrocephalus after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.,"Hydrocephalus is not a rare complication following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Hydrocephalus following subarachnoid hemorrhage can progress acutely (0-3 days), subacutely (4-13 days) or chronically (after 13 days). The predisposing factors leading to hydrocephalus after subarachnoid hemorrhage are not known exactly. This study assessed the predictive factors for the development of this condition. All patients presenting with subarachnoid hemorrhage between 1992-2001 were evaluated. All of them had initial computed tomography (CT) and hydrocephalus was diagnosed on CT scans. Age, gender, preexisting diabetes mellitus and hypertension, neurological state according to the Hunt and Hess scale at admission, Fischer grade on CT, the presence of intraventricular hemorrhage and localization of aneurysm were analyzed to see if there was any meaningful relationship between hydrocephalus and these factors. One hundred and fourteen patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage were evaluated. The incidence of hydrocephalus was 28.1 %. The incidence for acute hydrocephalus was 18.4 %, for subacute 5.2 % and for chronic 4.3 %. Sixty-nine percent of patients with hydrocephalus were graded as 3, 4 or 5 according to the Hunt and Hess scale on admission. Fifty-five percent of patients with hydrocephalus were graded as 3 and 4 according to Fisher grade on initial CT scan. Preexisting diabetes, higher Fisher grade and intraventricular hemorrhage were statistically significant predictors for the development of hydrocephalus. But only preexisting diabetes and higher Fisher grade were independent predictors according to multivariate analyses."

Many of these problems, particulary those related to flow effects, can be avoided by the use of a suitable contrast agent. To avoid the problem of super-imposition of veins, ultrafast gradient echo MRA techniques with very short TR and TE have been developed. Although the precise sequence parameters vary between different manufacturers, they are similar.

CD009372,0,9251456,0,Magnetic resonance angiography.,"The field of MRA has progressed to a stage at which several clinical applications are of obvious value, including the diagnosis of cerebral aneurysms, venous disorders and disease of the carotid bifurcation. Additionally spin echo images are useful in studying the parenchyma and this together with MRA works to be an excellent diagnostic package in the presurgical workup of patients with cerebral vascular abnormalities. With further technical improvements, it seems likely that important applications of MRA will also be found in the diagnosis of peripheral artery disease, stenosis of the renal artery and ischemic heart disease. With the advent of fast imaging techniques like echoplanar imaging, the ability image the coronary and renal arteries accurately seems possible in the near future. At present, however the lack of optimal spatial resolution and the presence of flow artifacts precludes the use of this technique for imaging the vasculature with an accuracy comparable with conventional angiography. The advent for contrast 3-D CT angiography has resulted in a technique of studying the intracranial vessels immediately after assessing for the presence of subarachnoid hemorrhage. It is superior to MRA in demonstrating the actively filling and thrombused portions of giant, partially thrombused aneurysms and in planning the surgical approach in relation to bony landmarks. Though there are daunting obstacles, with continuous ongoing clinical research and the added inputs from a dramatically changing computer technology, MRA is all set to be an imaging study of great promise that may eventually replace diagnostic catheter angiography in most clinical situations."

EEG changes occurred in 102 patients (18%). The frequency of EEG changes, as related to cerebral vascular symptoms, was as follows: transient ischemic attacks, seven per cent (19/259); completed strokes, 37% (36/98); vertebral basilar insufficiency, 24% (32/135); asymptomatic, 21% (15/71). Patients with contralateral carotid occlusion exhibited EEG changes in 37% (28/76) of operations. Fifteen patients suffered perioperative strokes (2.6%). Nine of the 15 were associated with a technical problem of either thrombosis of the internal carotid artery (five) or emboli (four). Technical problems were more common when shunts were used (five per cent) than when they were not (0.9%). Patients who suffered strokes prior to surgery were more at risk to develop a perioperative stroke (three per cent) than those not suffering prior strokes (0.3%). The EEG did not change in three patients who had lacunar infarcts prior to surgery and who awoke with a worsened deficit. Our series does not clearly establish the advantages of EEG monitoring, which is expensive (+375/patient) and may not detect ischemia in all areas of the brain. However, the use of shunts may introduce a risk of stroke due to technical error that is equal or greater than the risk of stroke due to hemodynamic ischemia. Since the need for protection is unpredictable by angiographic or clinical criteria, the benefit of EEG monitoring may be in reducing the incidence of shunting in those patients whose tracing remains normal after clamping. The decision to shunt, however, when there is electrical dysfunction after carotid clamping should be based not only on the EEG but also on the clinical signs and computed tomography (CT) scan. Our data does not show a net benefit in selective shunting unless the patient has sustained a stroke prior to surgery."

CD009372,0,23615379,0,Thrombolytics in acute ischaemic stroke: historical perspective and future opportunities.,"The discovery of thrombolytic agents goes back to the 1930s, when it was shown that substances derived from bacteria (streptokinase, staphylokinase), tissue (fibrinokinase), urine (urokinase) or bat saliva could activate the fibrinolytic system. The potential to treat arterial thrombosis with plasmin was recognized, but it was not until 1958 that its first use in acute ischaemic stroke (AIS) was described. However, since computer tomography (CT) was not available until the mid 1970s, optimal selection of patients was not possible. Early studies with streptokinase in AIS showed an increased risk of intracranial haemorrhage and lack of efficacy, which was associated with low fibrin specificity. The search for new agents with a better risk-benefit profile continued until 1979 when tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) was discovered. In 1983 it became possible to produce recombinant t-PA (rt-PA) by expression of a cloned gene which enabled clinical trials to be started, mainly for coronary thrombolysis. In 1995, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke study showed that rt-PA was an effective treatment for AIS, nowadays for use up to 4.5 h after onset. However, rt-PA still often fails in achieving rapid reperfusion, has relatively low recanalization rates and is associated with an increased bleeding risk. Several attempts have been made to develop thrombolytics with a better risk-benefit profile than rt-PA, but no real impact on clinical practice was observed. In 1994, it was shown that tenecteplase (rt-PA-TNK) had a higher fibrin specificity than rt-PA, but its clinical use in AIS was described only in 2005. The recently reported results of a small phase 2B trial showed significantly better reperfusion and clinical outcome with rt-PA-TNK compared to rt-PA; patients were selected by CT perfusion and angiography, and treated within 6 h after stroke onset. Currently, a phase 3 trial of rt-PA-TNK versus rt-PA is being planned in patients at an onset up to 4.5 h.

Case report.,"A 52-year-old woman with Sjögren's syndrome presented with multiple cerebral aneurysms, which resulted in recurrent subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) manifesting as severe headache. Computed tomography (CT) showed SAH. Cerebral angiography revealed aneurysms of the anterior communicating artery and the left middle cerebral artery. The necks of the aneurysms were successfully clipped. Postoperative course was uneventful and she was discharged without neurological deficit. Thirteen years later, she suddenly lost consciousness and was brought to our hospital. CT demonstrated recurrence of SAH. Cerebral angiography revealed cerebral aneurysms of the right internal carotid artery and the right middle cerebral artery. The clipped aneurysms were stable. The internal carotid artery aneurysm was successfully treated with endovascular coil embolization. However, she regained no neurological function and died. Patients with Sjögren's syndrome may develop cerebral aneurysm complicated with SAH."
CD009372,0,10721523,0,[The three-dimensional CT angiography findings of ruptured aneurysms hardly detectable by repeated cerebral angiography].,"We reported three cases of cerebral aneurysms hardly detectable by cerebral angiography, but easily detected by three-dimensional CT angiography (3D-CTA). These cases were ruptured aneurysms with subarachnoid hemorrhage. After detection of subarachnoid hemorrhage on CT scan, cerebral angiography was performed at first, but aneurysms were not detected. Subsequently 3D-CTA was carried out, and aneurysms were detected. In all cases, cerebral angiography was repeated, after the aneurysms had been found by 3D-CTA. This time aneurysms were all detected by cerebral angiography, but each case needed photographs from special direction. The aneurysms were small by usual cerebral angiography and they were almost invisible behind the artery near which they existed. 3D-CTA was very useful for detection of small aneurysms, but small perforating arteries around the aneurysms were invisible by 3D-CTA. To find these perforating arteries, cerebral angiography was needed."
CD009372,0,21129599,0,[Catastrophes caused by neurologic diagnostic procedures].,"Serious complications (catastrophes) resulting from diverse neurological diagnostic procedures can be caused by erroneous indication and omission, as well as by delay and erroneous execution or interpretation. Headache, caused by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) hypotension, is a frequent complication of lumbar puncture; hematic patch is a therapeutic option for severe cases. The most serious complication is cerebral herniation and, for its prevention, computed tomography (CT) or cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) must always be performed before lumbar puncture: a lesion with evident mass effect is a contraindication. Some cases of minor subarachnoid hemorrhages can produce sentinel headache: when the findings of CT scans are normal, lumbar puncture must be performed for diagnosis and prevention of a catastrophic recurrence. Edrophonium testing can be complicated with bradycardia and/or asystole. The lack of indication of this procedure is a cause of under-diagnosis of myasthenia gravis, especially in older people. Electromyography produces few complications (rare cases of paraspinal hematomas and pneumothorax). Ultrasound, CT angiography and MR angiography examinations have decreased the indications for cerebral angiography, whose main complications -in addition to contrast reactions, hemorrhage and infection at the injection site- are neurological deficits caused by vascular dissection or atheromatous embolus. Video-electroencephalogram (EEG) recording with medication suppression can be used in the presurgical evaluation of epilepsy, which can precipitate repeated seizures with the risk of injuries and status epilepticus. The possible complications of studies performed with invasive electrodes are infections and intracranial hemorrhages. Cerebral biopsy is indicated when treatable disease is suspected but the therapeutic options (radiotherapy, chemotherapy) have potential serious adverse effects. Furthermore, cerebral biopsy can aggravate previous neurological deficits or produce new deficits. Genetic testing is not indicated in healthy children when an untreatable disease is suspected. In adults, genetic testing is appropriate in selected cases, but detailed previous information should be gathered and the possibility of triggering serious emotional reactions should always be considered."

CD009372,0,2264073,0,Diagnostic significance of flow separation within the carotid bifurcation demonstrated by digital subtraction angiography.,"The presence of an area of reversed blood flow due to flow separation in the interval carotid artery is a normal finding in Doppler ultrasound studies in vivo as well as in model carotid bifurcations. This flow separation phenomenon is caused by the geometry of the carotid bifurcation and the fluid dynamics of blood. We demonstrated the flow separation phenomenon on lateral-projection intra-arterial digital subtraction angiograms in 99 of 100 carotid bifurcations. The mean duration of flow separation was 5.8 seconds, with values up to 14 seconds in normal carotid bifurcations. The presence of this flow separation phenomenon is almost independent of atherosclerotic lesions and is not correlated with cerebral ischemia. Therefore, the angiographic finding of a flow separation has no diagnostic value. However, our results refer to a factor that may be important in the genesis of atherosclerosis at the carotid bifurcation, namely the duration of the stay of blood and its components within the area of flow separation."

The retrospective evaluation of the initial CT- and angiographic findings of 773 patients with spontaneous SAH, who underwent (up to three) 4-vessel DSA, brought a percentage of 12.4% with negative angiography. We found the favourable prognosis of these patients with negative angiography not only to be dependent from the distribution of the hemorrhage, with preference to perimesencephalic pattern, but the initial clinical state. 85% of our patients, who presented with perimesencephalic blood pattern and even 80% of those patients with additional intraventricular hemorrhage but the good clinical condition of Hunt-Hess I/II were discharged without neurological deficits.

Magnetic resonance imaging revealed an infarct in the right dorsolateral aspect of the medulla oblongata. Antiplatelet therapy was administered. Vertebral angiography performed on the 9th hospital day (Day 9) revealed pearl and string sign in the right vertebral artery and narrowing of the left vertebral artery. Second angiography performed on Day 25 showed no change, but third angiography performed on Day 74 revealed spontaneous resolution of the bilateral vertebral artery dissections. Magnetic resonance angiography performed on Day 250 showed no evidence of dissection. However, magnetic resonance imaging revealed a small infarct in the splenium of the corpus callosum. Spontaneous resolution of stenotic dissections of the bilateral vertebral arteries is extremely unusual.

A correlation with radiographic angiography.,"Cerebral radionuclide angiography with 99mTc pertechnetate (RNA) and directional Doppler sonography (DS) were employed to study patients with cerebrovascular disease (CBVD). The 86 patients investigated were divided following radiographic angiography (RGA) into normals (n = 26) and into patients with intracranial (n = 22) and extracranial (n = 38) vascular lesions. Of the patients with angiographically demonstrated CBVD, RNA detected 90%, DS 53.3%. The combined evaluation had a sensitivity of 93.3%. If intracranial arterial disease was excluded, the sensitivity of the studies was 92.1% for RNA and 84.2% for DS and combined evaluation had a sensitivity of 97.4%. The diagnostic accuracy by combined evaluation was 93.8% for the extracranial arterial lesions if the clinical findings were also used in patients with normal RGA pattern.

The differentiation is extremely important because of the different treatment regimens. We compared the findings of six patients with biopsy-proven IAN with the data of six patients with BE. Patients with IAN were younger (27-62 years) and presented with multiple strokes (n = 4), intracerebral hemorrhage (n = 1), epileptic seizures (n = 2), or encephalopathy (n = 1). All IAN patients had pathologic cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings (pleocytosis n = 5; protein elevation n = 4), and angiography revealed multilocular stenoses in two cases while digital subtraction angiography was normal in four. BE patients (32-77 years) presented multiple (n = 3) or single ischemic strokes (n = 2) or encephalopathy and headache (n = 2). While all patients showed inflammatory serum findings (C-reactive protein n = 6, leucocytosis n = 4), CSF-pleocytosis was present in two cases only. Angiography revealed a vasculitic pattern in two patients. The diagnosis of BE was established based on transesophageal echocardiography and blood cultures. Leptomeningeal and brain biopsies performed in two cases were normal. Both IAN and BE may present multiple strokes and encephalopathy. The frequency of a vasculitic pattern in angiography is similar in both conditions. While inflammatory serum findings are the rule in BE, pathologic CSF findings were present in all IAN patients. Transesophageal echocardiography and blood cultures should be performed in order to diagnose or exclude BE. Without brain biopsy, immunosuppressive therapy may be dangerous in suspected IAN."

CD009372,0,21807345,0,ACR Appropriateness Criteria® on cerebrovascular disease.,"Stroke is the sudden onset of focal neurologic symptoms due to ischemia or hemorrhage in the brain. Current FDA-approved clinical treatment of acute ischemic stroke involves the use of the intravenous thrombolytic agent recombinant tissue plasminogen activator given <3 hours after symptom onset, following the exclusion of intracerebral hemorrhage by a noncontrast CT scan. Advanced MRI, CT, and other techniques may confirm the stroke diagnosis and subtype, demonstrate lesion location, identify vascular occlusion, and guide other management decisions but, within the first 3 hours after ictus, should not delay or be used to withhold recombinant tissue plasminogen activator therapy after the exclusion of acute hemorrhage on noncontrast CT scans. MR diffusion-weighted imaging is highly sensitive and specific for acute cerebral ischemia and, when combined with perfusion-weighted imaging, may be used to identify potentially salvageable ischemic tissue, especially in the period >3 hours after symptom onset. Advanced CT perfusion methods improve sensitivity to acute ischemia and are increasingly used with CT angiography to evaluate acute stroke as a supplement to noncontrast CT. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria(®) are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed every 2 years by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and review include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of a well-established consensus methodology (modified Delphi) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures by the panel. In those instances in which evidence is lacking or not definitive, expert opinion may be used to recommend imaging or treatment."
CD009372,0,2667572,0,"Pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of hypertension-associated stroke.","Chronically elevated blood pressure predisposes to stroke through effects on the extracranial and intracranial cerebral vessels. Hypertension-associated disease of small-diameter penetrating cerebral arteries may produce either lacunar infarction or intracerebral hemorrhage. The role of hypertension in the pathogenesis of atherothromboembolic cerebral infarction must be questioned in view of the evidence that antihypertensive therapy does not prevent myocardial infarction. Hypertension, in the absence of rheumatic heart disease, is frequently associated with atrial fibrillation. The incidence of stroke due to embolization of thrombus from the fibrillating left atrium of the nonrheumatic heart may have been overestimated in the past. Ideally, investigation of the patient who has had a stroke should include a brain-imaging study and a cerebral arteriogram. In practice, however, arteriography cannot always be justified. Treatment of the completed stroke is unsatisfactory but tissue plaminogen activator and calcium-channel blockers hold promise for cerebral infarction. Surgical decompression of the posterior fossa can be life-saving in cases of cerebellar infarction or hemorrhage.

A 3D sequence was acquired with the time-of-flight technique, using a transmitter-receiver cranial coil, followed by a strictly receiver Helmoltz coil on a 1 Tesla magnet. Two examiners evaluated the carotid bifurcations and measured the degree of stenosis in terms of diameters, according to the north american symptomatic carotid endarterectomy trial (NASCET). Five classes were established: class 1: normal; class 2: 1 to 29%; class 3: 30 to 69%; class 4: 70 to 99% and class 5: thrombosis. The results obtained in the determination of classes were identical with both coils: the coefficient of correlation with straight angiography were 0.973 with the cranial coil and 0.966 with the Helmoltz coil. Five stenoses were overestimated and classified as Class 3 instead of Class 2. The five stenoses greater than 70% (Class 4) showed a signal-void area at their level, due to severe dephasing induced by turbulences. Finally, there was a false-negative image of occlusion: the high-intensity signal of the thrombus was mistaken for one of flow. The data of our study were in accordance with the excellent results obtained by several authors in the literature, which makes it possible for us to propose this type of examination as a novel mean of investigating bifurcations of carotid arteries. Provided a strict technique is applied, and in addition to carotid bifurcation the Willis' circle and the cerebral parenchyma are explored, MR-angiography can complete the results of Doppler-echo. Standard arteriography could then be reserved to surgical patients and to those with discordant results of MR-arteriography and Doppler echo systems."

Subsequent 123I-IMP-single photon emission tomography (SPECT) revealed marked reduction of cerebral blood flow and disturbed reactivity to acetazolamide in the left cerebral hemisphere. Superficial temporal artery (STA)-MCA anastomosis was performed to improve cerebral blood flow and reduce hemodynamic stress for AN of the A-com and right MCA. At 5 months after the first operation, neck clipping was performed successfully for the non-ruptured A-com AN and right MCA AN. CASE 2: A 65-year-old male was admitted to our hospital.

Haptoglobin (Hp) is a hemoglobin-binding protein expressed by a genetic polymorphism (1-1, 2-1, and 2-2). Our objects were to investigate whether the Hp phenotype could predict the incidence of cerebral infarction, favorable outcome, clinical deterioration by DCI, and angiographical VS after aneurysmal SAH. Ninety-five consecutive patients who underwent clipping or coil embolization were studied. Favorable functional outcome was defined as a modified Rankin Scale score of 0-2 at 3 months. Angiographical VS was diagnosed based on cerebral angiography findings performed between days 7 and 10 after SAH. The Hp 2-2 group had a significantly greater risk of angiographical VS than that of Hp 2-1 and 1-1 groups combined on univariate (odds ratio [OR]: 3.60, confidence interval [CI]: 1.49-8.67, P = .003) and multivariate logistic regression analyses after being adjusted for age, sex, Fisher groups, and other risk factors (OR: 3.75, CI: 1.54-9.16, P = .004). The Hp 2-2 group also showed the tendency of a greater risk of clinical deterioration by DCI with marginal significance on univariate and age- and sex-adjusted analyses (univariate OR: 2.46, CI: .90-6.74, P = .080; age- and sex-adjusted OR: 2.46, CI: .89-6.82, P = .080) but not after being adjusted for other multiple risk factors. The Hp 2-2 group was not associated with the favorable 3-month outcome and cerebral infarction (univariate: P = .867, P = .209; multivariate: P = .905, P = .292). The Hp phenotype seems to be associated with a higher rate of angiographical VS and clinical deterioration by DCI but does not affect the incidence of cerebral infarction and favorable outcome."
CD009372,0,23544266,0,Cerebral hemorrhage and cerebral infarction in 30 cases of adult moyamoya disease: comparison between conservative therapy and superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery anastomosis.,"To clarify the effect of surgery on the prevention cerebral hemorrhage in adult moyamoya disease, we compared postoperative courses between superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery (STA-MCA) anastomosis and conservative therapy. The study subjects were 30 adults with moyamoya disease. Unilateral STA-MCA anastomosis was conducted in 7 of these 30 cases, and bilateral STA-MCA anastomosis was conducted in 8 of these 30 cases. Therefore, anastomosis was performed in a total of 23 sides. The postoperative clinical course was observed for more than 5 years after the STA-MCA anastomosis. Cerebral hemorrhage occurred after operation in 2 sides (8.7%) among the 23 sides that received STA-MCA anastomosis. On the contrary, hemorrhage occurred during conservative therapy in 5 sides (13.5%) among 37 non-operation sides (no significance in chi2 test). Cerebral infarction occurred in 3 sides (13%) among 23 sides treated with STA-MCA anastomosis. However, the infarction occurred in 2 sides (5.4%) among the 37 non-operation sides (no significance in chi2 test). Cerebral hemorrhage tended to occur less frequently after STA-MCA anastomosis, and bypass surgery was suggested to have some beneficial effect in preventing cerebral hemorrhage in adult moyamoya disease. However, it was revealed that STA-MCA anastomosis exacerbated the brain ischemia. Therefore, strict management is mandatory in the perioperative period."

CD009372,0,8676838,0,Diagnostic testing for the evaluation of headaches.,"Headaches are one of the most common symptoms that neurologists evaluate. Although most are caused by primary disorders, the list differential diagnoses is one of the longest in all of medicine, with over 300 different types and causes. The cause or type of most headaches can be determined by a careful history supplemented by a general and neurologic examination. Reasons for obtaining neuroimaging include medical indications as well as anxiety of patients and families and medico-legal concerns. In the era of managed care, concerns over deselection and negative capitation may dissuade the physician from ordering even a medically indicated scan. The yield of neuroimaging in the evaluation of patients with headache and a normal neurologic examination is quite low. Combining the results of multiple studies performed since 1977 for a total of 3026 scans reveals the overall percentages of various pathologies as: brain tumors, 0.8%; arteriovenous malformations, 0.2%; hydrocephalus, 0.3%; aneurysm, 0.1%; subdural hematoma, 0.2%; and strokes, including chronic ischemic processes, 1.2%. EEG is not useful in the routine evaluation of patients with headache. Similarly, the yield of neuroimaging in the evaluation of migraine is quite low. Combining the results of multiple studies performed since 1976 for a total of 1440 scans of patients with various types of migraine, the overall percentages of various pathologies are: brain tumor, 0.3%; arteriovenous malformation, 0.07%; and saccular aneurysm, 0.07%. WMA have been reported on MRI studies of patients with all types of migraine, with a range from 12% to 46%. The cause of WMA in migraine is not certain. Cerebral atrophy has been variable reported as more frequent and no more frequent in migraineurs compared with controls. The ""first or worst"" headache has a long list of possible causes and always includes the possibility of acute subarachnoid hemorrhage. Headaches--especially the sentinel type caused by SAH--often are misdiagnosed. The probability of detecting an aneurysmal hemorrhage of CT scans performed at various intervals after the ictus is: day 0.95%; day 3, 74%; 1 week, 50%; 2 weeks, 30%; and 3 weeks, almost nil. The location of a ruptured saccular aneurysm often is suggested by the predominant site of the SAH. The probability of detecting xanthochromia with spectrophotometry in the CSF at various times after a subarachnoid hemorrhage is: 12 hours, 100%; 1 week, 100%; 2 weeks, 100%; 3 weeks, more than 70%; and 4 weeks, more than 40%. The management of thunderclap headaches with normal CT scan and CSF examinations is controversial. Most patients have a benign course but an unruptured saccular aneurysm occasionally may be responsible for the headache. MR angiography may be a reasonable test to obtain instead of a cerebral arteriogram in many of these cases. About 30% to 90% of patients have headaches of various types and causes after mild head injury. Although most headaches are relatively benign, perhaps 1% to 3% of these patients have life-threatening pathology, including subdural and epidural hematomas, that are detected on CT and MRI scans. Headaches caused by subdural hematomas can be nonspecific. When new-onset headaches begin in patients over the age of 50 years, the physician always should consider whether it may be a secondary headache disorder requiring specific diagnostic testing and treatment. Up to 15% of patients 65 years and over who present to neurologists with new-onset headaches may have serious pathology such as stroke, TA, neoplasm, and subdural hematoma. Headaches are the most common symptom of TA, reported by 60% to 90%. The only over the temple. The diagnosis of TA is based on a high index of clinical suspicion that usually but not always is confirmed by laboratory testing. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate can be normal in 10% to 36% of patients with TA. A superficial temporal artery biopsy can give a false-negative result in 5% to 44% of patients."

We used the following Doppler parameters: interhemispheric asymmetry index (AI), mean flow velocity (mV) and pulsatility index (PI) for the middle cerebral artery (MCA). The difference between patients and controls on analysis of the variance (ANOVA) in respect of AI was significant: F = 50.8, p < 0.0001. The CNS-AI correlation was equally valid: r = -0.56, p < 0.001. The CNS-CT correlation proved to be highly significant: r = -0.72, p < 0.0001.

CD009372,0,8837799,0,The role of computed tomographic angiography in the diagnosis of intracranial aneurysms and emergent aneurysm clipping.,"Conventional cerebral angiography has always been regarded as the gold standard for intracranial aneurysm detection. However, conventional angiography has the disadvantages of being invasive and time consuming. We present here 30 patients who underwent computed tomographic angiography (CTA) with three-dimensional reconstruction for the detection of intracranial aneurysms. All of these patients had subarachnoid hemorrhage or suspected intracranial aneurysms. CTA was performed in all patients with the use of a General Electric Hispeed Advantage helical scanner. Iohexol, 135 ml, was used as the contrast agent. Twenty-five patients also underwent conventional angiography for comparison. The five patients who underwent CTA only did not have conventional angiography because of poor clinical condition, and four of them subsequently died. Five patients had subarachnoid hemorrhage, but the results of both CTA and conventional angiography were negative for aneurysms. One patient had an incidental finding of a 3-mm left posterior communicating artery aneurysm on CTA, which was confirmed by conventional angiography. In the remaining 19 patients, 19 saccular aneurysms and 1 fusiform aneurysm were detected by CTA. Locations and sizes were confirmed by conventional angiography in all except two. The first exception was a patient who had a 2.5-mm anterior communicating artery aneurysm detected by CTA but not by conventional angiography. Surgical exploration confirmed the CTA diagnosis. The other exception was a patient in whom a 2-mm right posterior communicating artery aneurysm was detected by CTA but in whom conventional angiography showed a 2-mm left posterior communicating artery aneurysm. Unfortunately, there was no surgical confirmation in this case because the family of the patient refused surgery. Our results have demonstrated that CTA is a quick, reliable, and relatively simple diagnostic tool for intracranial aneurysms. In an emergent situation, such as a deteriorating patient with a hematoma, it is superior to either empiric exploration or infusion computed tomographic scans because it delineates the orientation and configuration of the aneurysm and its associated vascular anatomy."

CD009372,0,20636713,0,Fibromuscular dysplasia of cervical and intracranial arteries.,"Fibromuscular dysplasia is an uncommon, segmental, nonatherosclerotic arterial disease of unknown aetiology. The disease primarily affects women and involves intermediate-sized arteries in many areas of the body, including cervical and intracranial arteries. Although often asymptomatic, fibromuscular dysplasia can also be associated with spontaneous dissection, severe stenosis that compromises the distal circulation, or intracranial aneurysm, and is therefore responsible for cerebral ischaemia or subarachnoid haemorrhage. Fibromuscular dysplasia affects middle and distal portions of the internal carotid and vertebral arteries, and occasionally, intracranial arteries. Several pathological and angiographic patterns exist. The most frequent pathological type is medial fibromuscular dysplasia, which is associated with the 'string of beads' angiographic pattern. Unifocal lesions are less common and can be associated with several pathological subtypes. The pathophysiology of the disease is widely unknown. Fibromuscular dysplasia may in fact result from various causes and reflect a non-specific response to different insults. The poor knowledge of the natural history and the lack of randomised trials that compared the different treatment options do not allow any satisfactory judgement to be made regarding the need for or the efficacy of any treatment."
CD009372,0,23417929,0,Subarachnoid haemorrhage with bilateral intracranial vertebral artery dissecting aneurysms treated by staged endovascular stenting.,"Bilateral vertebral artery dissecting aneurysms (VADAs) presenting with subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) are an exceedingly rare and deadly clinical dilemma. Prompt intervention in the case of unilateral VADAs is advocated to prevent rebleed; however, in the case of bilateral VADAs, the optimal therapeutic intervention is unclear. We describe the case of a patient presenting with SAH with bilateral VADAs treated by staged endovascular stenting. This led to resolution of the aneurysms with patency of both vertebral arteries. Stent-based therapy of the symptomatic aneurysm followed by staged stenting of the asymptomatic, contralateral aneurysm appears to be a viable treatment option. This method allows the ability to preserve flow in both vertebral arteries with minimal changes in flow characteristics that may threaten the contralateral, asymptomatic VADA, and appears to be the ideal treatment in these rare cases."

The objective of this study was to estimate the sensitivity of 16-detector CT for the diagnosis of non-traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage in the Emergency Department (ED). A retrospective review was performed in an academic tertiary care hospital. Patients presenting to the ED from September 2003 through December 2004 with symptoms suggestive of subarachnoid hemorrhage and having a final diagnosis of non-traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage were eligible for study. Diagnosis was established by positive 16-detector CT examination of the brain, or spinal fluid analysis. Patient demographics and results of CT, angiogram, and spinal fluid analysis were reviewed. Sensitivity of 16-detector CT was calculated by comparing CT results and cerebral angiogram results. Refined Wilson Simple Asymptotic 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Sixty-one consecutive patients met the study criteria and had a final diagnosis of non-traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage. One of these patients did not have subarachnoid hemorrhage identified by 16-detector CT, but had a positive lumbar puncture and an aneurysm confirmed on cerebral angiography. Sensitivity of 16-detector CT for subarachnoid hemorrhage was 97% (95% confidence interval 84-100%). Sixteen-detector CT did not improve detection of non-traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage when compared with studies using single-detector CT.

They were followed up for 4 to 6 weeks and cerebral angiography was performed if indicated. CT scanning has identified a subset of these patients who have sustained a reversible ischemic neurologic deficit (RIND) rather than a completed stroke. The timing for angiography and surgery for this group has not been established. In an earlier study we found that 21% (4 of 19 patients) suffered a second stroke during the 4- to 6-week waiting period. To avoid this high rate of recurrence, we instituted an aggressive program of CT scan evaluation and surgical therapy for all ""stroke patients"" with negative CT scans. Two hundred forty-five patients were seen with a persistent neurologic deficit between July 1980 and December 1983. These patients underwent CT scans 1 and 5 days after the initial event. Of these 245 patients, 171 patients (70%) were found to have negative CT scans. Appropriate carotid lesions were found by arteriography in 110 (64%) of the negative CT scan group. There were 61 (55%) men and 49 (45%) women in this group. Eighty-five patients (77%) had previous neurologic symptoms or a cerebrovascular accident. Hypertension was present in 52% and diabetes mellitus in 30%.

She was managed conservatively for 1 year, then suffered right total ophthalmoplegia associated with enlargement of the aneurysm. Two months later, she became comatose due to intracerebral hemorrhage in the right temporal lobe. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated further enlargement of the aneurysm. Emergency craniotomy found the lateral dural wall of the cavernous sinus was markedly expanded and torn by compression from the aneurysm. Rupture of the aneurysm into the intradural space through this dural defect was confirmed. The aneurysm was trapped after high-flow bypass, but the patient did not recover and died. Symptomatic enlarged intracavernous carotid artery aneurysm is potentially fatal and may indicate prompt surgical management."

Case report.","A 45-year-old man presented with bilateral acute subdural hematomas (ASDHs) without subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). He was found comatose in a parked car. Computed tomography showed left frontal intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and bilateral ASDHs but no signs of SAH. Magnetic resonance angiography demonstrated an internal carotid artery dorsal wall aneurysm. Emergent surgical intervention was performed. However, he died of cerebral herniation 6 days later. We inferred that massive intracranial bleeding might have ruptured through the cortex and lacerated the arachnoid membrane. Aneurysm rupture generally results in unilateral SDH, whereas trauma is the usual cause of bilateral ASDHs with ICH. Our case suggests that ruptured aneurysm should be considered in patients with non-traumatic bilateral ASDHs without SAH."

Although no trials directly comparing intra-arterial and i.v. delivery of thrombolytics exist, intra-arterial thrombolysis has several potential advantages, including angiographic assessment of the thrombus and the site of occlusion and collateral circulation, improved recanalization, and delivery of higher local concentrations of thrombolytic agents and extending the therapeutic time window for treatment. We conducted a retrospective audit of our experience with the use of intra-arterial urokinase to treat acute ischaemic stroke at an Australian tertiary-care hospital between June 1993 and June 2003. We examined time from stroke onset to assessment, computerized tomography scan, cerebral angiography and thrombolysis, anatomical classification of intra-arterial thrombus, rates of symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage, and clinical outcome at 3 months. We believe that in carefully selected individuals in appropriate centres of expertise, intra-arterial thrombolytic therapy holds great promise."

CD009372,0,7713091,0,Non-selective digital subtraction angiography in comparison with selective conventional angiography in the diagnosis of carotid artery disease.,"In the recent past, non-selective arterial digital subtraction angiography (NSDSA) seemed a less invasive alternative to conventional filmscreen angiography (CFA) in the diagnosis of carotid artery disease. NSDSA obviated the need for selective catheterization with its associated risks but yet took advantage of the DSA method. However, this technique has not found general application although there are no reports that formally assess the (dis)advantages of NSDSA. The aim of our study was to compare the reliability of NSDSA with CFA in evaluation of carotid bifurcations in patients with transient ischemic attacks or partial stroke by reviewing prospectively collected data. Over a 2-year period, 40 patients (upper age limit 65 years) underwent both NSDSA and CFA. Bilateral NSDSA was performed in all 40 patients (80 bifurcations). Bilateral CFA was performed in 27 patients whereas unilateral CFA was carried out in 13 patients (67 bifurcations). Inter- and intra-observer variability for the degree of stenosis was determined by calculation of kappa-values for a 4-point and a 2-point scale. The proportion of interpretable studies was significantly lower in NSDSA. The inter- and intra-observer agreement was on average better in CFA examinations, though the difference was only statistically significant for the inter-observer agreement. The results of our study indicate that images obtained with NSDSA give less reliable information about carotid artery disease than images obtained with CFA. This is in accordance with the fact that NSDSA now seems an abandoned technique."
CD009372,0,22958770,0,Fatal hemorrhage in cerebral proliferative angiopathy.,"Cerebral proliferative angiopathy (CPA) is a rare vascular abnormality with several angiomorphological features that are distinct from brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). The natural history of CPAs indicates a lower risk for hemorrhage compared to brain AVMs. A 62-year-old woman presented with gait instability and dysarthria. MRI and angiography revealed a diffuse vascular network involving the tectum and cerebellar vermis with intermingled brain parenchyma. This lesion had no dominant feeder, high-flow arteriovenous shunt, flow-related aneurysm or highly dilated veins on angiogram. These findings were consistent with a diagnosis of CPA. During follow-up, she developed progressive gait instability and eye movement abnormalities, but no remarkable change was detected on the repeated MRI and angiography. Nine years later, she died of mesencephalic hemorrhage originating from the CPA. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first description of a patient with CPA who died as a result of the initial hemorrhage.

The findings indicated that the tumor was an angiomatous meningioma and contained meningotheliomatous components. The hemorrhage was occurred in the portion of the angiomatous meningioma. The possible reason for the hemorrhage was thought that sudden dynamic changes in blood flow which were triggered by the embolization. The sudden changes could have caused multiple ruptures on pathologic small vessels. Therefore, we strongly recommend that preoperative embolization should be proceeded with caution for exercising a cyst meningioma, since it could increase the possibility of bleeding from pathologic weak vessels."

Because the possible causal factors and clinical manifestations of this disorder are many and varied, imaging plays a primary role in the diagnosis. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, un-enhanced computed tomography (CT), unenhanced time-of-flight MR venography, and contrast material-enhanced MR venography and CT venography are particularly useful techniques for detecting cerebral venous and brain parenchymal changes that may be related to thrombosis. To achieve an accurate diagnosis, it is important to have a detailed knowledge of the normal venous anatomy and variants, the spectrum of findings (venous sinus thrombi and recanalization, parenchymal diffusion or perfusion changes or hemorrhage), other potentially relevant conditions (deep venous occlusion, isolated cortical venous thrombosis, idiopathic intracranial hypertension), and potential pitfalls in image interpretation."

Regions of interest (ROI) studied by MRS included regions appearing normal on MRI as well as regions showing complications of sickle cell disease, including focal deep white matter areas of high signal intensity (deep white matter ischemia, DWMI) seen on long TR images, focal atrophic brain areas, and infarcts. The findings in these studies are summarized as follows: Normal-appearing regions on MRI have normal MRS. In ROI including small areas of DWMI, lactate elevation was not detected, but the levels of N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA) appeared slightly elevated. In areas of DWMI 1-2 cm in size, reduced blood flow could be seen on MRA and lactate elevation could be detected with MRS. When blood flow to a DWMI region was normal, NAA was reduced and there was little lactate elevation, as cell death had already occurred.

CD009372,0,15055330,0,CT angiography ofthe carotid arteries.,"The introduction of multislice scanning has made CT angiography (CTA) a serious competitor to MR angiography (MRA) as a second line method for the evaluation of the carotid arteries. For optimum display of the morphology of stenoses, it is necessary to apply the thinnest possible section collimation (ideally [symbol: see text] 1.25mm). While the scan range is limited for single slice CTA, it is possible to cover the whole supraaortic circulation from the aortic arch to the intracranial vessels using multislice scanning. Timing of contrast injection is important, however, the injection technique for carotid CTA is more forgiving than for other body regions. Image evaluation is mainly based on axial sections and curved planar reformations (CPR). Other techniques only serve as an adjunct to better be able to demonstrate the findings. Most potential pitfalls can be avoided by using the appropriate technique. CTA has been shown to have a pooled sensitivity of 95% and specificity of 98% for the detection of >70% stenoses, even if only older single-slice techniques are used. Differentiation between lipid, fibrous and calcified plaques may be possible, especially with multislice scanning. Multislice CTA can in addition detect tandem stenoses in the region of the carotid origin from the aorta, the carotid siphon, and the intracranial portion of the carotids. CT is able to provide a comprehensive evaluation of patients with acute stroke by using a combined approach of pre-contrast CT to detect hemorrhage and manifest infarction, CT brain perfusion measurements to differentiate between penumbra and infarct and CTA to detect the occluded vessel as well as potential concomitant carotid abnormalities. In summary, carotid CTA has come of age and can be used to quantify stenoses more precisely than ultrasound, to detect tandem stenoses and for the workup of acute stroke patients. The learning objectives include learning how to chose acquisition parameters for carotid CTA, how to process and interpret carotid CTA, to become familiar with the artifacts and pitfalls of carotid CTA, and to comprehend the role of CTA relative to the other modalities for carotid imaging."

Twenty-seven patients with MS and 24 healthy volunteers underwent magnetic resonance imaging and pCASL to assess CBF. Differences in CBF between the two groups and the relationships of CBF values with the T2-hyperintense volume were evaluated. Compared to the healthy volunteers, reduced CBF was found in the bilateral thalami and right frontal region of the MS patients. The volume of the T2-hyperintense lesion was negatively correlated with regional CBF in some areas, such as both thalami. Our results suggest that demyelinated lesions in MS mainly have a remote effect on the thalamus and that the measurement of CBF using ASL could be an objective marker for monitoring disease activity in MS."

CD009372,0,9045973,0,The role of duplex sonography and angiography in the investigation of carotid artery disease.,"Some patients with symptomatic carotid stenoses of greater than 70 % benefit from carotid endarterectomy. This study was designed to compare the accuracy of duplex ultrasound with angiography in assessing the degree of carotid stenosis in 73 patients with symptoms of recent carotid territory ischaemia. Ultrasound was found to be most accurate in the group of patients with normal vessels or mild stenoses (0-29 %) when there was 90 % concordance between ultrasound and angiography. Ultrasound was found to be least accurate in the group of patients with severe stenoses (70-99 %) in whom it was more likely to underestimate than to overestimate the degree of stenosis. Only one patient said to have < 30 % stenosis on ultrasonography had a > 70 % stenosis on IADSA. Our results indicate that patients with normal arteries or mild disease shown by ultrasound have a very small chance of having surgically amenable lesions in the neck. Ultrasound is reliable as an exclusory screening test. However, all other stenoses should also be investigated by catheter angiography if surgery is considered. Taking angiography as the reference, only 52 % of patients with severe stenoses, which might be taken as an indication for surgery, were correctly identified on ultrasonography. Ultrasound alone is a poor technique for identifying patients for surgery and a combination of ultrasound screening with angiography for > 30 % stenoses detected by ultrasound is recommended."

Patients underwent computerized tomography because of a suspected associated thoracic or abdominal injury, or indeterminate findings on excretory urography, nephrotomography or angiography. Blunt trauma accounted for 87.1 per cent of the renal injuries and penetrating trauma for 12.9 per cent. The most common findings on computerized tomography were perirenal hematoma in 29.4 per cent, intrarenal hematoma in 24.7 per cent and parenchymal disruption in 17.6 per cent. In 33 patients who underwent laparotomy computerized tomographic staging was confirmed. In contrast, the most common finding on excretory urography, diminished opacification (17 of 53 patients), was found to have no correlation with the severity of renal injury as assessed by computerized tomography or laparotomy. Angiography appreciably understaged 1 of 5 cases by failing to show extracapsular extravasation with parenchymal disruption. All findings on angiography were depicted by computerized tomography. We conclude that computerized tomographic staging for renal trauma is more sensitive and specific than excretory urography, nephrotomography and angiography, and that it should be used primarily when multiple traumatic injuries are suspected, when excretory urography suggests major trauma or is nonspecific and when clinical evidence of major trauma exists, regardless of what excretory urography shows."

CD009372,0,19322683,0,Intracranial microbial aneurysm (infectious aneurysm): current options for diagnosis and management.,"The histopathological characteristic of intracranial microbial aneurysm (MA)-infectious aneurysm is the presence of infection and destruction of the walls of the vessels. It can occur in the setting of predisposing infections that spread by endovascular mechanism (e.g., infective endocarditis) or extravascular mechanism (e.g., meningitis). MA is probably a better term than mycotic, infectious, or infective aneurysm as a wide variety of bacteria, fungi, mycobacteria, and virus can cause MA. Typically MAs are multiple, distal, and fusiform aneurysms, but the angiographic and clinical presentations can vary widely. The most common presentation of MA is intracranial bleed. CT angiography, MR angiography, or Digital subtraction angiography can be deployed to detect MA. By combining the clinical findings, imaging, and angiographic findings, it is possible to arrive at a correct diagnosis in most instances. MAs carry higher risk of rupture and fatal bleed when compared to other aneurysms. The treatment options include antimicrobial therapy, surgery, and endovascular therapy. The management strategy is based on large case series rather than controlled trials. All MA should receive appropriate antibiotic therapy. Ruptured MA with mass effect would require surgery in most situations, while those without mass effect and in non-eloquent locations could also be managed by endovascular therapy. Unruptured MA could be managed according to the size, location, and risk of bleeding-by antibiotic therapy, surgery, or endovascular therapy. Monitoring the resolution of the MA under antibiotic therapy by serial CT angiography is another option, but it carries higher risk of bleeding. Treatment of the underlying predisposing infection is an important component of therapy."

Since cerebral arteries were found to be sensitive to the vasoconstrictor effect of angiotensin II, the possibility of angiotensin's contribution to this vasospasm was investigated. Delayed cerebral arterial spasm was documented angiographically 72 hours after introduction of blood in the subarachnoid space of dogs. Following injection of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, teprotide, repeat cineangiograms at 30, 60, and 90 minutes demonstrated partial or total release of spasm of the basilar artery and its branches. It is concluded that angiotensin II participates in the delayed cerebral vasospasm after hemorrhage, and that angiotensin inhibition may release the spasm and prevent cerebral ischemia."

A 66-year-old female was found unconscious at home and transferred to our hospital in a deep coma on February 9, 1991. Emergency CT scan revealed subarachnoid hemorrhage in the posterior fossa. She was treated conservatively because of her poor neurological status. The angiograms performed on February 13 showed occlusion of the basilar artery and a saccular aneurysm at the cortical branch of the PICA. The contrast material remained in the aneurysm for a long time throughout the venous phase. The left vertebral artery was markedly hypoplastic. The patient improved remarkably after admission and became almost alert late in February, although she still presented tetraparesis, dysfunction of lower cranial nerves and other neurological signs linked with the brain stem. The unusual angiographical findings in this case prompted us to perform the examination again, expecting some angiographical changes. The angiograms taken on March 15 revealed spontaneous disappearance of the aneurysm, although the basilar artery occlusion remained unchanged. The authors discussed some problems involved in this case, including the relation between the aneurysm and the arterial occlusion, and the mechanism of spontaneous disappearance of the aneurysm."
CD009372,0,17116208,0,EFNS guideline on neuroimaging in acute stroke. Report of an EFNS task force.,"Neuroimaging techniques are necessary for the evaluation of stroke, one of the leading causes of death and neurological impairment in developed countries. The multiplicity of techniques available has increased the complexity of decision making for physicians. We performed a comprehensive review of the literature in English for the period 1965-2005 and critically assessed the relevant publications. The members of the panel reviewed and corrected an initial draft, until a consensus was reached on recommendations stratified according to the European Federation of Neurological Societies (EFNS) criteria. Non-contrast computed tomography (CT) scan is the established imaging procedure for the initial evaluation of stroke patients. However, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has a higher sensitivity than CT for the demonstration of infarcted or ischemic areas and depicts well acute and chronic intracerebral hemorrhage. Perfusion and diffusion MRI together with MR angiography (MRA) are very helpful for the acute evaluation of patients with ischemic stroke. MRI and MRA are the recommended techniques for screening cerebral aneurysms and for the diagnosis of cerebral venous thrombosis and arterial dissection. For the non-invasive study of extracranial vessels, MRA is less portable and more expensive than ultrasonography but it has higher sensitivity and specificity for carotid stenosis. Transcranial Doppler is very useful for monitoring arterial reperfusion after thrombolysis, for the diagnosis of intracranial stenosis and of right-to-left shunts, and for monitoring vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage. Currently, single photon emission computed tomography and positron emission tomography have a more limited role in the evaluation of the acute stroke patient."

Computerized tomography of the brain revealed a round hyperdense lesion in the left frontoparietal region. Digital subtractional angiography of the left internal carotid artery confirmed the suspicion of an arteriovenous malformation with one main feeding artery: a distal branch of the left anterior cerebral artery. The nidus was round and about 2 cm in diameter. The venous drainage was of the superficial type, flowing into the left superior sagittal sinus. After consultation with a neurosurgeon, we decided to treat the arteriovenous malformation by means of an endovascular technique. A flow-guided catheter was placed close to the nidus. Control angiography before embolization revealed the proper position for the injection of embolic material. We used the conventional mixture of acrylic polymerization glue, Lipiodol oil contrast medium and particles of tantalum powder. Control angiography at the end of the procedure revealed complete occlusion of the malformation. There were no signs of potential new feeding arteries that could appear as a result of changed hemodynamic conditions after embolization. Endovascular treatment of arteriovenous malformations could become the treatment of choice for these lesions, especially in combination with radiosurgery. The established microsurgical treatment is very effective but carries a higher risk of hemorrhagic complications."
CD009372,0,9813400,0,Diagnosis of cerebral venous thrombosis with routine magnetic resonance: an update.,"Magnetic resonance imaging and angiography is the technique of choice in the diagnosis and follow-up of cerebral venous thrombosis: Thrombosis appears as an absence of flow void on spin echo images and lack of signal in angiographic techniques. The thrombus signal intensity is different on T1 and T2 spin echo weighted images and evolves according to hemoglobin degradation. Recognition of pitfalls and artefacts related to the different magnetic resonance imaging techniques employed is essential to interpret dural venous sinus thrombosis. In this paper the imaging of 27 patients with cerebral venous thromboses is reviewed. We describe the type of signal abnormalities, the different types of clot- and flow-related artefacts, and the indirect signs of cerebral venous thrombosis."
CD009372,0,21493767,0,Is it possible to recognize cervical artery dissection on stroke brain MR imaging? A matched case-control study.,Extracranial CAD accounts for nearly 20% of cases of stroke in young adults.

CD009372,0,6504292,0,Ipsilateral hemiparesis caused by subarachnoid hemorrhage in a patient with a ruptured middle cerebral artery aneurysm: a case report.,"The authors report a patient with a ruptured middle cerebral artery (MCA) aneurysm who presented with ipsilateral hemiparesis. A computed tomographic (CT) scan and cerebral angiograms suggested that the ipsilateral hemiparesis was most likely due to compression by hematoma of the secondary motor area in the island of Reil. Two other cases that demonstrated ipsilateral motor weakness after rupture of MCA aneurysms have been reported. We emphasize not only the importance of considering dysfunction of the secondary motor area in patients with hemiparesis, but also the difficulty in differentiating ipsilateral secondary motor area dysfunction from contralateral primary motor area dysfunction in certain cases without CT scanning and angiography."
CD009372,0,1786128,0,Surgical treatment of pontomedullary cavernomas.,"Direct treatment of brainstem cavernous haemangiomas (cavernomas) naturally represents a considerable surgical challenge due to the close proximity of vital structures. The results of such treatment have only rarely been described. We report our experience in the management of seven patients with cavernomas of the brainstem treated by microsurgical resection. All patients presented with neurological symptoms directly attributable to one or more episodes of brainstem haemorrhage. CT scan examination in all cases revealed either obvious haematoma or a focal region of high density within the pons or medulla; calcification in and around the lesion was detected in two patients. MRI scanning was performed in four of our cases and was strongly suggestive of the diagnosis of cavernoma with evidence of both recent and older haemorrhage as evidenced by haemosiderin deposits. Cerebral angiography failed to disclose abnormal vessels to the cavernoma in any instance, although interestingly a co-existent but separate cerebellar venous malformation was observed in two of our cases. Surgery was performed between 19 days and 3 months following the most recent haemorrhage. Microsurgical removal of both haematoma and underlying cavernoma was accomplished either via a median suboccipital or retromastoid craniectomy, with an appropriate incision being made into that part of the brainstem most directly overlaying the lesion. Significant improvement in neurological function has followed in all seven cases. Although the natural history of symptomatic cavernous haemangiomas is incompletely understood, the favourable results obtained in our patients suggest that total surgical removal is both practicable and relatively safe even in the case of those lesions situated within the brainstem."

Of 7 patients undergoing lumbar puncture, none showed fresh blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) xanthochromia. Neither digital subtraction angiography (DSA) nor MR venography (MRV) confirmed cerebral vein thrombosis as a possible etiologic factor for subpial hemorrhage. Patients for whom follow-up was available (n=8), showed complete recovery indicating an excellent prognosis. Overall, the etiology of subpial hemorrhage remains obscure.

CD009372,0,19945250,0,[Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome].,"Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS) is more frequent than previously thought and is probably underdiagnosed. The mean age of onset is 42 years, and it affects slightly more women than men. RCVS is attributed to a transient, reversible dysregulation of cerebral vascular tone, which leads to multifocal arterial constriction and dilation. More than half the cases (60%) are secondary to exposure to vasoactive substances (e.g., cannabis, antidepressants, and nasal decongestants) or occur in the postpartum period. RCVS has a characteristic clinical and radiological course, developing in a single phase after a sudden onset, and there is generally no new event after 1 month. The main pattern of presentation begins with recurrent thunderclap headaches, often triggered by sexual activity or various Valsalva's maneuvers, over a period of 1 to 3 weeks. Seizures and focal neurological deficits are less frequent and generally start after the headaches. Cortical subarachnoid hemorrhage (22%), intracerebral hemorrhage (6%), seizures (3%), and reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy (9%) are early complications, occurring mainly within the first week. Ischemic events, including TIAs (16%) and cerebral infarction (4%), occur significantly later than hemorrhagic strokes, mainly during the second week. Diagnosis requires the demonstration of the characteristic ""string and beads"" on cerebral angiography and can be difficult, for 21% of patients have a normal initial magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and 9% both a normal MRA and a normal transcranial Doppler. In these cases, the initial investigations must be repeated after a few days. The final diagnosis is made when a follow-up MRA shows resolution or at least marked improvement of the arterial abnormalities within 12 weeks. RCVS is sometimes associated with other large artery lesions of the head and neck, including dissections and unruptured aneurysms, especially during the postpartum period. Nimodipine is the treatment most often recommended. In our experience, it is not especially effective in severe RCVS. Relapses are possible but rare and have not yet been reported in prospective series. Although the exact pathophysiology remains speculative, strong recommendations against vasoactive substances appear prudent."

CD009372,0,1632359,0,MR angiography of the head and neck: value of two-dimensional phase-contrast projection technique.,"MR angiography is commonly performed by using two- and three-dimensional time-of-flight and three-dimensional phase-contrast techniques. These procedures require long examination times and processing of imaging data by computing maximum intensity projections. Two-dimensional phase-contrast projection angiography has neither of these disadvantages. We analyzed the value of this technique for head and neck MR angiography in 84 patients and 15 control subjects. Patients were examined to resolve specific clinical questions such as the presence of arteriovenous malformations (20 cases), patency of carotid and vertebral arteries (35 cases), patency of the superior sagittal sinus (14 cases), patency of saphenous vein bypass grafts (11 cases), and vascularity of masses (four cases). Conventional angiograms were available for correlation in 22 patients. Two-dimensional phase-contrast projection angiograms were generated by using a gradient-recalled-echo sequence sensitized to flow with the use of flow-encoding gradients. Projection MR angiograms were obtained in approximately 3.5 min by combining images obtained with flow-encoding gradients applied along the axes defining the image plane. MR angiograms were subjectively evaluated by three observers without reference to routine MR images or conventional angiograms. High-quality studies were obtained in 93% of control subjects and 90% of patients examined. The findings based on phase-contrast angiography were confirmed with conventional angiography in 21 of 22 patients for whom conventional angiograms were available. Evaluation of vascular grafts and of the patency of major cranial vessels was easily done with two-dimensional phase-contrast angiography and was useful in postoperative follow-up examinations. We also advocate its use for superior sagittal sinus thrombosis and follow-up examinations in patients with arteriovenous malformations."
CD009372,0,9420433,0,Fatal subarachnoid hemorrhage from an inflammatory cavernous carotid artery aneurysm: failure of conservative treatment after early diagnosis--case report.,"Inflammatory carotid artery aneurysm is a rare complication of acute paranasal sinusitis. A 50-year-old female presented with a ruptured giant carotid artery aneurysm secondary to infection of the sphenoid sinus and cavernous sinus. She had been healthy until 5 days before admission, when she developed orbital phlegmon and meningitis. She received antibiotic therapy for 10 days. Computed tomography (CT) of the brain 2 days after admission showed no abnormality. However, repeat CT on day 6 showed a round isodense mass in the suprasellar cistern suggesting a cerebral aneurysm. Twelve days after admission, she suffered a fatal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Cerebral angiography revealed a giant left cavernous carotid artery aneurysm with a very irregular shape. Autopsy found sphenoid sinusitis and osteomyelitis extending into the cavernous sinuses. Diagnosis of bacterial inflammatory aneurysms before rupture is very important. Appropriate surgical intervention should be considered if there is enlargement of the original aneurysm or appearance of a new aneurysm indicating a potentially dangerous situation."

The patient was a 14-month-old boy. Two months after intracardiac repair for a complex congenital heart disease, he presented with low-grade fever and was placed on oral antibiotics. A month later an echocardiography revealed 2 vegetations on the tricuspid valve. Although the vegetations became smaller with intravenous antibiotics, right hemiplegia was noted 5 weeks later. Brain CT and MR-angiography demonstrated left middle cerebral artery embolism. For fear of another embolism caused by a remaining movable vegetation on the tricuspid valve, intra-atrial vegetation removal under CPB was performed 5 days after cerebral infarction. Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography was utilized to locate the vegetation and confirm its removal. His postoperative course was uneventful without a recurrence of cerebral infarction or bleeding. He was weaned from the ventilator on postoperative day (POD) 1, started to move the right extremities on POD 5 and was discharged home on POD 66."

The risk factors for incidental embolism after cerebral angiography were retrospectively examined using diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) in 180 patients who underwent 247 angiography procedures, consisting of 174 diagnostic angiography and 73 interventional procedures, and magnetic resonance imaging including DWI within 72 hours after angiography. The two neuroradiologists in our hospital detected embolism after cerebral angiography as high-intensity lesions (HIL) on DWI. The relationships between HIL on DWI and procedural factors were evaluated. DWI after cerebral angiography revealed HIL related to the procedure in 72 of 247 angiographies. In all procedures, age (p < 0.01), past history of cerebral infarction (p < 0.05), anti-platelet therapy (p < 0.05), neuro-intervention (p < 0.01), and total amount of contrast medium (odds ratio [OR] 2.125, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.045-4.321) were significantly correlated with HIL. In diagnostic angiography, the performance of the procedure by a resident operator (OR 2.526, 95% CI 1.214-5.254) was significantly correlated with HIL. Age, past history of cerebral infarction, and previous anti-platelet therapy determined the risk of atherosclerotic changes in patients. The neuro-intervention and total amount of contrast medium used could predict the risk of time limitations for angiography. Resident operator is also a risk factor. This study demonstrates the importance of improving the risk of time limitations for angiography and the risk due to operator inexperience. Further training of residents may be needed to reduce the occurrence of embolic complications."

The patient was a 24-year-old female. She consulted our hospital because of a fever and was diagnosed with IE and a cerebral hemorrhage. A blood culture test on admission revealed methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed giant vegetation in the left atrium. Besides the management of an acute-stage cerebral hemorrhage, medical therapy for IE was performed. However, a severe infection was refractory, and mitral-regurgitation-related heart failure deteriorated. Despite acute-stage cerebral hemorrhage, mitral valve replacement was performed 10 days after admission because advanced disseminated intravascular coagulation syndrome made conservative management difficult. After surgery, neither exacerbation of cerebral symptoms nor recurrent IE was noted, and the patient was discharged."

CD009372,0,7748357,0,Magnetic resonance angiography in 140 neuropediatric patients.,"Three-dimensional magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) is a noninvasive technique that images the intracranial arterial vasculature without contrast agents. The suitability of MRA was evaluated for routine use and all children were prospectively studied with conventional MR imaging and time off flight MRA (FISP3D). All MR studies were performed on a 1.5 T-MRA system using a circularly polarized head coil. The study comprised 140 children, ages 3 weeks to 18 years, with different neuropediatric diseases. Major cervical and intracranial arteries were visualized in all age groups. Smaller branches of the supratentorial arteries were identified inconstantly and the number of arteries visualized increased up to the age of 6 years. Sixty-seven children (47%) had normal intracranial vasculature. MRA demonstrated anatomic variations in 21 patients (15%). Twenty-two of 32 children with congenital malformations demonstrated abnormalities of the intracranial vasculature. The diagnostic value of MRA was confirmed in 11 of 12 patients after neonatal stroke and in 3 of 10 children after stroke at older ages. Seven of 18 children with acute hemorrhage demonstrated arteriovenous malformations or an aneurysm on MRA. The correlation with digital subtraction angiographic findings was established in 13 patients. In 9 of 13 children with brain tumor, MRA proved to be diagnostically valuable. MRA proved to be of particular value in the evaluation of the carotid artery following extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy. MRA can be used in children of all age groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD009372,0,2031074,0,Recent developments in the diagnosis and management of patients with transient ischaemic attacks and minor ischaemic strokes.,"Appropriate management of the patient with transient focal neurological symptoms must start with accurate clinical diagnosis. Wider use of clear diagnostic criteria and symptom checklists, and better knowledge of the clinical features of the 'funny turns' which are not related to transient focal cerebral ischaemia could reduce the present variability in clinical diagnosis of transient ischaemic attacks. More accurate clinical diagnosis contributes to better selection of the most appropriate investigation strategy for each patient. A basic minimum standard of investigation is outlined and perhaps provides a suitable template for audit. Patients with transient ischaemic attacks which are definitely in the carotid distribution may be eligible for entry in trials of carotid endarterectomy. Prudent use of duplex ultrasound studies of the carotid arteries in patients with appropriate symptoms is an effective way to reduce the costs of investigations and their complications (i.e. the number of strokes associated with cerebral angiography). Digital venous subtraction angiography has, by comparison, many disadvantages as a screening tool. Advances in management include: recent statistical overviews which have emphasized the need to consider blood pressure and plasma cholesterol reduction in a large proportion of patients, and the value of long term anti-platelet therapy in reducing the risks of stroke, myocardial infarction and vascular death in both males and females. The value of anticoagulants in patients with atrial fibrillation and transient ischaemic attacks or minor stroke is being tested in current trials."

CD009372,0,18655265,0,Perfusion imaging with computed tomography: brain and beyond.,"The availability of rapid imaging with multidetector CT systems and commercial analysis software has made perfusion imaging with CT an everyday technique, not only for the brain but also for other body organs. Perfusion imaging is usually performed as an adjunct to a conventional CT examination and is therefore particularly appropriate when a conventional CT is part of routine clinical protocols. The derived values are reproducible and have been validated against a range of reference techniques. Within neuroradiology, perfusion CT has attracted interest in the assessment of acute stroke but can also be used to assess secondary injury in head trauma and as an adjunct to CT angiography to evaluate cerebral spasm in subarachnoid haemorrhage. Within oncology, perfusion CT provides an imaging correlate for tumour vascularity that can be used to discriminate benign and malignant lesions, as an indicator of tumour aggressiveness, to reveal occult tumour and improve the delineation of tumours during radiotherapy planning, and as a functional assessment of tumour response to therapy. By exploiting the ability of CT systems to quantify contrast enhancement, CT perfusion imaging uses contrast media to assess vascular physiology and so improve diagnosis, prognosis, treatment selection and therapy monitoring."

Head computed tomography revealed an irregular intracerebral hematoma in the left temporoparietal region, associated with a tubular high density area compatible with a thrombosed transcerebral vein in the left temporal lobe. The patient was free of coagulopathy. Craniectomy was performed to remove the intracerebral hematoma and venous thrombosis was confirmed. Postoperative cerebral angiography demonstrated extensive venous malformation in the left parietal and occipital lobes. Multiple transcerebral draining veins converged in the vein of Galen associated with a varix. Segmental narrowing of the straight sinus was suggestive of congestion in the venous anomaly. The patient showed progressive recovery following surgery, and was discharged with moderate aphasia, mild right hemiparesis, and right homonymous hemianopsia 1 month later. Venous malformations are usually silent, but occasionally become symptomatic due to thrombosis of the draining vein. The presence of stenosis in the draining route may lead to venous congestion, thrombus formation, and catastrophic hemorrhagic venous infarct."

Twelve hours after the ischemic onset he suddenly complained of severe headache and his consciousness deteriorated. The follow-up CT showed diffuse SAH. Cerebral angiography showed occlusion of the right vertebral artery at the origin of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) and segmental stenosis of the left vertebral artery at the portion distal to the vertebral PICA junction. We treated the patient conservatively. Four days later, he suddenly fell into a coma, but CT showed no bleeding.

These areas of hyperattenuation were noted in the middle cerebral artery territory in the first patient and involving the brainstem, cerebellum, and tentorium in the second. Both were falsely interpreted as subarachnoid hemorrhage. The area of hyperattenuation resolved within a few hours in both patients, reflecting contrast medium extravasation/leakage.

CD009372,0,6475574,0,"Review of 1,000 consecutive cases of severe head injury treated before the advent of CT scanning.","This is a review of 1,000 consecutive cases of severe head injury admitted to our Neurosurgical Department between January 1973 and August 1976, before the advent of CT scanning. All patients were comatose following head injury (GCS less than or equal to 8) and were treated homogeneously by the same neurosurgical team by a protocol that included immediate resuscitation on arrival, diagnosis of intracranial lesions by angiography, early surgery when needed, mechanical ventilation, steroids, and mannitol. Extracranial lesions, even if preponderant, were treated by various specialists in the Neurosurgical Department, which for all practical purposes operated as an Emergency Department. Admission criteria were very broad with no preadmission selection. The overall mortality for this series was 45%. A little less than half the patients made good recoveries or remained moderately disabled (47%); 6% were severely disabled, and 2% survived in a persistent vegetative state. More than two-thirds of the patients were brought to our Neurosurgical Department after a short stay at a general hospital; 72% were admitted within 6 hours of injury; 71% were traffic accident victims; and 34% had significant associated extracranial injuries. Carotid angiography was performed in 78% of the patients and indicated the presence of an intracranial haematoma requiring surgery in 36% of the whole series. Mortality was significantly higher in operated than in unoperated patients (56% versus 39%); those treated surgically, however, were older, in worse clinical condition, and showed a higher incidence of acute subdural haematomas associated with brain contusion. Carotid angiography proved very effective in revealing the presence of an expansive lesion but failed to reflect the severity of brain damage, since the group with ""negative"" angiograms showed a high mortality (52%). Patients with a lucid interval had a higher percentage of surgical lesions than those with immediate coma (58% versus 26%); but fully 42% of them did not require surgery, and 25% had negative angiograms. From the prognostic point of view the clinical data elicited after initial resuscitation were highly predictive of the outcome: some individual neurological signs, such as mydriasis, posturing and eye movements, were not inferior to the GCS score in that respect. Age also proved a strong predictor, since elderly patients are more likely to have severe subdural and parenchymal lesions and their clinical severity is accordingly greater.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

CD009372,0,4619849,0,[25 years of electroencephalography in cerebrovascular disease].,"The value of the EEG has not been diminished by the advent of new diagnostic procedures and the improvement of older techniques. For electro-encephalography is in essence a 'clinical' method, reflecting in its own particular way, the variable status of the brain. Moreover, in conjunction with these methods the EEG can provide for better information concerning the brain's condition. Furthermore in particular serio-angiography and C.B.F. measurements can furnish us more detailed insight in the EEG phenomena which may occur in differed types of cerebro-vascular disease. Generally the changes of the local EEG phenomena, which may occur in cerebral ischaemia correlate well with the angiographic and r.C.B.F. data. In cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral tumour however the r.C.B.F. values are commonly more diffusely reduced as could be expected from the extent of the EEG disturbances. Increased r.C.B.F. values may be encountered over meningioma due to increased perfusion of the Xenon133 in this electrically inactive tumour; they can also occur in malign glioblastoma, where direct arterio-venous connections are responsable for the so called shunt peaks. These peaks may also be found in patients with arterio-venous malformations or with acute ischaemia, in the latter case due to marked reduction of the local pH. Remarkable was the discrepancy between the local increase of the C.B.F. and the local deterioration in the EEG following intracarotid injection of HC1 papaverine; the same applied to the reaction of EEG and C.B.F. in case of acute induced hypertension with loss of autoregulation."

In 19 patients with ischemic stroke of presumed embolic or non-embolic cause we carried out diffusion-weighted and T2-weighted MR imaging within 48 h of onset, and obtained apparent diffusion coefficient of water (ADCw), and T2 weighted images. We used the signatures obtained from these ADCw/T2 maps to formulate two patterns of damage signifying accelerated or non-accelerated progression of cellular death after stroke onset. Those patients with the accelerated pattern corresponded to those with the neuroradiological (NRC) and clinical diagnosis (TOAST.1 and TOAST.2) of presumed embolic stroke, with clinical diagnosis performed blinded both to NRC and to SM. Agreement between the SM and NRC was substantial (kappa=0.62), moderate (0.60<kappa<0.40) between the SM or NRC and TOAST.2, and fair (0.40<kappa<0.20) among the SM or NRC and TOAST.1.

The first four-vessel study on admission revealed 530 cases (92.2%) of ruptured cerebral aneurysms, four (0.7%) of ruptured arteriovenous malformation, 25 (4.3%) of unknown etiology. Repeated four vessel study showed eight (32.0%) aneurysms among 25 cases whose first studies were negative. Six of the eight cases had aneurysms in the vertebro-basilar system. In 11 cases, repeated four-vessel study failed to detect the hemorrhagic source; and no generalized diseases were noted. One of them had recurrence of SAH 19 months after the onset of the initial one. The patient was underwent operation, which showed thrombosed ruptured aneurysm. Our present investigation demonstrated that ruptured aneurysm was responsible for 94.8% of all 575 cases of SAH detected by CT scans and 10 cases (1.7%) were diagnosed as cases of SAH of unknown etiology."
CD009372,0,2961755,0,"CT, MRI, and angiography of venous angiomas: a comparative study.","Seventeen venous angiomas in 16 patients were evaluated radiologically at the Montreal Neurological Hospital. Radiologic investigations included contrast-enhanced computed tomograms (CECT) in 15 patients, cerebral angiograms with a long venous phase study in 15, and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging with a spin-echo pulse sequence technique in six. CECT revealed abnormalities including six nodular nonspecific enhancing lesions and nine enhanced draining veins, whereas plain CT revealed intracerebral hemorrhages in four patients and calcification in one. All the angiograms showed the characteristic pattern of venous angiomas consisting of medullary veins converging to a large draining vein during the late venous phase. All six patients examined by MR showed abnormal vascular structures; parenchymal hemorrhages were present in two patients. In five patients with venous angiomas, medullary veins converging to a large draining vein were demonstrated as echo-void curvilinear structures. In two patients, the increased signal from medullary veins in long echo delay sequences was suggestive of a slow venous flow rate. Demonstration of the venous nature of the malformation may, in the future, obviate the need for angiography."
CD009372,0,2718199,0,Hemorrhagic transformation in cerebral embolism.,"We studied the mechanism of hemorrhagic infarction after acute cerebral embolism in 160 patients by brain computed tomography and angiography. Hemorrhagic infarction during the month after the embolic event was evident in 65 patients (40.6%). Initial angiography a median of 1.5 (range 1-60) days after the event revealed occlusion of the cerebral arteries in 117 of 142 patients (82.4%), and reopening of the vessels was observed in 56 (94.9%) of 59 patients who had follow-up angiography a median of 20 (range 3-47) days after the event. The incidence of hemorrhagic infarction was higher in patients greater than or equal to 70 years old (31 of 61, 50.8%) than in those aged 50-69 years (27 of 72, 37.5%) or less than 50 years (seven of 27, 25.9%) (greater than or equal to 70 vs. less than 50, p less than 0.05). In patients with moderate or large infarcts, hemorrhagic infarction developed in 50.0% or 51.5%, respectively, while in those with small infarcts it developed in only 2.9% (p less than 0.05). No correlation was found between hemorrhagic infarction and history of hypertension or blood pressure during the acute stage of stroke. Thrombolytic and/or anticoagulant therapy did not affect the incidence of hemorrhagic infarction (40.0% with vs. 40.7% without therapy) but tended to cause massive hematoma. Our results indicate that hemorrhagic transformation in cerebral embolism is caused not only by reopening of the occluded vessels but also by other factors such as age and size of the infarct. Hypertension per se seems to be less important for hemorrhagic infarction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

The risk of rebleeding and ischemic complications can be markedly reduced when the prompt diagnosis of cerebral aneurysmal rupture is made. The sudden onset of severe headache with or without neurologic deficit raises the clinical suspicion, however atypical symptoms exist making the diagnosis difficult. A 49-year-old male with a 3-day history of neck discomfort, without headache, was admitted following a generalized seizure. A serum sodium of 115 mEq/L was noted. A computed tomographic scan of the brain revealed a subarachnoid hemorrhage. Two intracranial cerebral aneurysms were identified by cerebral angiography and subsequently treated. The diagnosis and treatment of subarachnoid hemorrhage is reviewed."

We sought to determine whether antegrade flow can be demonstrated on time-resolved 4-dimensional computed tomographic angiography (4-dimensional CTA), whether it can be distinguished from retrograde collateral flow, and if it can be used to predict early recanalization."
CD009372,0,2366074,0,Surgical management of hematomas of the brain stem.,"Nine patients with brain-stem hematoma were admitted to the authors' institute during the period from 1985 to 1988. Clinical symptoms and signs pointed to pontine involvement in most cases. Progressive clinical deterioration was quite common and usually led to a clinical diagnosis of brain-stem intra-axial tumor. Angiography was noncontributory; computerized tomography (CT) was the main diagnostic test. This gave evidence of different pathological characteristics, including masses showing highly increased density, nonhomogeneous hyperdense lesions, and isodense lesions with peripheral contrast enhancement. No clear correlation was found, however, between the presumed duration of the clinical picture and the CT characteristics of the lesion. In the last four cases, magnetic resonance imaging was performed using a 0.015-tesla resistive system. This examination usually confirmed the presence of a brain-stem mass already shown by previous CT scans. There were, however, no cases in which direct evidence of an intra-axial vascular malformation could be obtained. The patients were all treated surgically with an attempt at total removal of the lesion and thorough inspection of the hematoma cavity and biopsy. Evidence of ""cryptic"" arteriovenous malformation was obtained in six of the nine cases. There were minor transitory complications in three cases. All of the patients were able to resume their previous activity, and none suffered recurrence of the symptoms following the operation. It may be concluded that surgery is the treatment of choice for brain-stem hematoma."
CD009372,0,6740477,0,Completely thrombosed giant aneurysm of the angular artery.,An unusual case of a completely thrombosed giant aneurysm arising from the angular artery is reported.

CD009372,0,22958768,0,Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome: treatment with multiple sessions of intra-arterial nimodipine and angioplasty.,Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS) is characterized by acute severe headache with or without additional neurological symptoms and reversible cerebral vasoconstriction. Unruptured aneurysms have been reported in some cases with RCVS. We describe a severe case of a 50-year-old woman with RCVS presenting as cortical subarachnoid hemorrhage. Cerebral angiogram demonstrated the typical angiographic findings of RCVS and two very small unruptured aneurysms of the left internal carotid artery. The patient was treated with calcium channel blockers and the two aneurysms were successfully treated endovascularly. On day 16 the patient developed new focal neurological symptoms (severe paraparesis) and was successfully treated with intraarterial nimodipine and angioplasty in multiple sessions.
CD009372,0,8613833,0,Ultra-early rebleeding in spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage.,"To determine the incidence of, and risk factors for, the occurrence of rebleeding between admission and early operation (ultra-early rebleeding) in patients with spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), the authors reviewed the cases of 179 patients admitted within 24 hours after their last attack of SAH. Thirty-one (17.3%) of these patients had ultra-early rebleeding despite scheduling of early operation (within 24 hours after admission). The incidence of rebleeding significantly decreased as the time interval between the last attack and admission increased. Patients with rebleeding before admission, high systolic blood pressure, intracerebral or intraventricular hematoma, those in poor neurological condition on admission, and those who underwent angiography within 6 hours of the last SAH were significantly more likely to have ultra-early rebleeding than those without these factors. The incidence of rebleeding also significantly increased as levels of enhancement of platelet sensitivity and thrombin-antithrombin complex increased. Multivariate analysis revealed that the following three factors were independently associated with ultra-early rebleeding: the level of enhancement of platelet sensitivity; the time interval between the last attack and admission; and the level of thrombin-antithrombin complex. On the basis of these findings, the authors suggest that many of the risk factors for ultra-early rebleeding are interrelated. A particularly high risk of ultra-early rebleeding was observed in those patients 1) who had platelet hypoaggregability; 2) who were admitted shortly after their last SAH; and 3) whose thrombin-antithrombin complex levels were extremely high and were thus in severe clinical condition."
CD009372,0,2336144,0,[Transbrachial artery approach for selective cerebral angiography].,"Transaxillary or transbrachial approaches to the cerebral vessels have been reported, but selective angiography of all four vessels has not been possible through one route. In this report, a new technique for selective cerebral angiography with transbrachial approach is described. One hundred and twenty three patients with cerebral infarction, vertebrobasilar insufficiency, intracerebral hemorrhage, epilepsy, or cerebral tumor were examined. Those patients consisted of 85 outpatients and 38 inpatients whose age ranged from 15 years old to 82 years old. The patients were examined via the transbrachial approach (97 cases via the right brachial, 29 cases via the left). Materials included a DSA system (Digital Fluorikon 5000, General Electric Co.), a 4 French tight J-curved Simmons 80-cm catheter, a 19-gauge extra-thin-wall Seldinger needle, and a J/Straight floppy 125-cm guidewire. Generally, the volume of the contrast agent (300 mgI/ml iopamidol) used in the common carotid artery angiogram was 6 ml, while that used in the vertebral artery angiogram was 4ml. If catheterization of the vertebral artery or right common carotid artery was unsuccessful, about 8ml of the contrast agent was injected into the subclavian or brachiocephalic artery. Definitive diagnosis and a decision on proper treatment of the patients can be easily obtained, and the results were clinically satisfactory. Moreover, no complications were encountered in this study. This new technique making a transbrachial approach to the cerebral vessels using the DSA system is introduced here. Neurosurgeons can use this technique easily, and they will find that it provides them with all the information they need about the patient."

CD009372,0,6204665,0,[Recovery from aphasia and cerebral blood flow: a comparison between cerebral hemorrhage and cerebral thrombosis].,"To compare cerebral circulation in aphasic patients who had cerebral hemorrhage against those who with cerebral thrombosis, we studies 50 patients with hypertensive intracranial (putaminal) hemorrhage and 20 patients with cerebral thrombosis whose diagnoses were confirmed on repeated CT scan and cerebral angiography. The measurements of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) by the 133Xe intraarterial injection method was carried out in 40 patients. The evolution of the aphasic syndrome was analyzed according to Hirano's classification and the patients were divided into two groups: those having a favorable recovery from aphasia; those with a poor recovery. Twelve out of 20 patients with cerebral hemorrhage showed a favorable recovery from aphasia, whose left hemispheric mean blood flow (mCBF) was 33.1 +/- 9.7 ml/100 g/min. The mCBF was 30.8 +/- 10.3 ml/100 g/min in 8 patients with a poor recovery. There was no significant difference in mCBF values between the two groups. The favorable recovery group showed slightly higher regional values in the left frontal and temporal lobes than did the poor recovery group, but no significant difference was found between the two group. Here, rCBF values failed to correlate between the two kinds of recovery from aphasia in patients with cerebral hemorrhage. The marked variability in rCBF values in the acute stage might partly account for the poor correlation in cerebral hemorrhage. In contrast, a series of rCBF studies demonstrated that rCBF values stabilized in the acute and subacute stage in cerebral thrombosis. Nine out of 20 patients with cerebral thrombosis had a favorable recovery from aphasia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

CD009372,0,10081777,0,[Imaging of cerebrovascular disease in sickle cell anemia].,"Cerebral vascular disease is a common and serious complication of sickle cell disease that mainly involves the large blood vessels of the skull base. Because recurrences are common and residual deficits severe, attention has turned to detection of preclinical cerebral involvement with the goal of preventing clinical damage. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), an extremely sensitive tool for detecting cerebral infarction/ischemia, has shown that 10% of asymptomatic patients exhibit white matter lesions that seem to be associated with impaired cognitive function and may be predictive of stroke; magnetic resonance angiography demonstrates occlusions of skull base arteries but is not reliable for the diagnosis of stenosis because of artifacts generated by rapid turbulent flow. Transcranial Doppler is sensitive and specific for the detection of arterial stenosis and occlusion, even in asymptomatic patients. Digitized cerebral angiography remains the gold standard investigation for pretreatment confirmation of lesions detected by Doppler and/or MRI."
CD009372,0,7584251,0,Intracranial aneurysms.,"MR angiography provides a rapid, accurate, and extremely flexible noninvasive evaluation of intracranial aneurysms without the cost and risk of conventional angiography. TOF and phase contrast techniques each have specific advantages and disadvantages that can be selectively exploited to optimize aneurysm evaluation. Present indications for MR angiography in aneurysm evaluation include: (1) the presence of incidental findings on a CT or MR examination that suggest the possibility of aneurysm (Figs. 7 and 8), (2) when angiography is contraindicated or when the risk is too high, (3) non-invasive follow-up of patients with known aneurysms, (4) patient refusal of contrast angiography, and (5) evaluation of patients with specific clinical symptoms (i.e., third cranial nerve palsy) or patients with non-specific subacute symptoms in whom an aneurysm might explain the clinical presentation. Although MR angiography certainly can detect aneurysms with a high rate of sensitivity and specificity, detailed decision analyses generally have not supported the overall benefit of this type of screening. Future technical advances as well as advances in the overall understanding of aneurysms may one day prove unequivocally the benefit of MR angiography in screening high-risk patient groups. MR angiography has not yet been clinically evaluated as a tool in the evaluation of acute subarachnoid hemorrhage. Potential obstacles to such an evaluation include the clinical instability of SAH patients, limited spatial resolution of the MR angiography acquisitions, the potential for subarachnoid blood or focal intraparenchymal hematomas to obscure or mimic small aneurysms, and the unreliability of MR angiography in demonstrating vasospasm. Currently these factors continue to provide an integral role for contrast angiography in aneurysm evaluation."

The current applications of these techniques are reviewed, and pitfalls as well as problems in the diagnosis of acute stroke are discussed. With the availability of these techniques, patients can almost instantaneously be approved for pharmacotherapy and monitored and thus clinical outcome potentially can be improved tremendously."
CD009372,0,17709084,0,A practical approach to CT angiography of the neck and brain.,"Computed tomography angiography (CTA) is a rapidly developing technology with great potential. This is particularly true for evaluating neurovascular disease. Clinical stroke because of atherosclerotic disease of the carotid and vertebral arteries is a common examination indication; areas of stenosis, and soft and calcified plaque along the entire vessel, not only at the carotid bifurcation, permit a full assessment of the patient's disease process. Other diseases including dissection, trauma, intracranial stenosis, thrombosis, and aneurysms can be readily diagnosed. Although duplex ultrasound may be a first line examination in many patients, both magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and CTA offer distinct advantages over it. CTA and MRA are both highly accurate but CTA has several key advantages. CTA has been advanced by the development of improved multidetector CT (MDCT) and workstations that postprocess the data. Methods to obtain quality CTA images and to rapidly analyze the data for abnormalities are the subject of this chapter. In addition, evolving techniques in future CT scanners and workstations, and developing methods of vulnerable plaque and CT perfusion imaging are discussed."

A 44-year-old woman started taking human placenta extract with the aim of improving her menopausal symptoms, fatigue, and beauty. However, 18 days after taking human placenta extract, she had three episodes of thunderclap headache. Repeated cranial CT did not show subarachnoid hemorrhage; CSF examination showed neither xanthochromia nor inflammation. Brain diffusion weighted and FLAIR images were normal. However, magnetic resonance angiography showed multifocal segmental stenosis of the right middle cerebral artery and bilateral anterior cerebral arteries. Follow-up angiography, which performed 12 days after the oncet of thunderclap headache, revealed almost normalized flow in all cerebral arteries; we made a diagnosis of RCVS.

Cerebral angiography had demonstrated occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery and steroid therapy had been started. Attempted tapering of the steroid therapy on admission for rehabilitation resulted in the patient having severe headaches and confusion. Blink reflex evaluation, somatosensory cerebral evoked potential determinations and visual evoked responses were all consistent with a widespread process involving the parietal lobe of the patient's left cerebral hemisphere. Computerized axial tomography indicated an abnormality consistent with a space-occupying lesion. Craniotomy revealed the presence of a glioblastoma multiforme in the left cerebral hemisphere. Electrodiagnostic evaluation was entirely consistent with the operative finding of widespread involvement of the patient's left parietal lobe. Stroke patients whose conditions deteriorate over time must be serially evaluated in order to determine possible other causes of their symptoms."
CD009372,0,2024274,0,Angiographic vasospasm and release of platelet thromboxane after subarachnoid hemorrhage.,"We studied adenosine diphosphate-induced platelet aggregation and the associated release of thromboxane B2 in 49 patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage in relation to angiographic vasospasm. Postoperative cerebral angiography was performed less than or equal to 3 (median 1) days after surgery for an aneurysm 5-14 days after subarachnoid hemorrhage. Correspondingly, one sample from each patient was taken within 24 hours either before or after angiography. The occurrence of severe as well as diffuse, moderate, or severe angiographic vasospasm was associated with the presence of delayed cerebral ischemia (p less than 0.05). Patients with diffuse angiographic vasospasm had significantly higher (p less than 0.05) values for thromboxane B2 release than the others, even after adjustment by the clinical grades on admission and before surgery, the timing of surgery, the time from subarachnoid hemorrhage to angiography and blood sampling, and nimodipine therapy. Severe and diffuse angiographic vasospasm were also associated with poor outcome at 1 year (p less than 0.05). Our results suggest that augmented release of platelet thromboxane may be involved in the pathogenesis of vasospasm in large cerebral arteries."

The cesarean section was performed because pregnancy induced hypertension (PIH) had worsened. The next day, she suddenly became drowsy and developed right hemiparesis and anisocoria. Computed tomography of the brain showed intracerebral hemorrhage in the parietal lobe with uncal herniation. She underwent an urgent craniotomy and removal of the hematoma. Five days later, magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the brain showed vasospasm of the bilateral intracranial internal carotid arteries, middle cerebral arteries, and anterior cerebral arteries. Thirteen days later, cerebral angiography showed cessation of vasospasm and vascular abnormalities such as moyamoya disease, arteriovenous malformation and cerebral aneurysm were not observed. Twenty-one days later, MRA showed the absence of vasospasm in those arteries, but her right hemiparesis and sensory aphasia persisted. Twenty-six days later, she was transferred to another hospital for further rehabilitation. Neurosurgeons should be aware of the possibility of intracerebral hemorrhage caused by PIH. In this manuscript, we provide a case presentation and review of the literature."

CD009372,0,19472612,0,Intracranial CT angiography obtained from a cerebral CT perfusion examination.,"CT perfusion (CTP) examinations of the brain are performed increasingly for the evaluation of cerebral blood flow in patients with stroke and vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage. Of the same patient often also a CT angiography (CTA) examination is performed. This study investigates the possibility to obtain CTA images from the CTP examination, thereby possibly obviating the CTA examination. This would save the patient exposure to radiation, contrast, and time. Each CTP frame is a CTA image with a varying amount of contrast enhancement and with high noise. To improve the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) we combined all 3D images into one 3D image after registration to correct for patient motion between time frames. Image combination consists of weighted averaging in which the weighting factor of each frame is proportional to the arterial contrast. It can be shown that the arterial CNR is maximized in this procedure. An additional advantage of the use of the time series of CTP images is that automatic differentiation between arteries and veins is possible. This feature was used to mask veins in the resulting 3D images to enhance visibility of arteries in maximum intensity projection (MIP) images. With a Philips Brilliance 64 CT scanner (64 x 0.625 mm) CTP examinations of eight patients were performed on 80 mm of brain using the toggling table technique. The CTP examination consisted of a time series of 15 3D images (2 x 64 x 0.625 mm; 80 kV; 150 mAs each) with an interval of 4 s. The authors measured the CNR in images obtained with weighted averaging, images obtained with plain averaging, and images with maximal arterial enhancement. The authors also compared CNR and quality of the images with that of regular CTA examinations and examined the effectiveness of automatic vein masking in MIP images. The CNR of the weighted averaged images is, on the average, 1.73 times the CNR of an image at maximal arterial enhancement in the CTP series, where the use of plain averaging increases the CNR only with a factor of 1.49. The quality of the weighted averaged images approaches that of CTA images, although in the present study the image quality of CTA was not quite reached. The automatic masking of veins is effective and only small remnants of veins were sometimes present in the masked images. Weighted averaging makes it possible to create CTA images from a CTP examination with a CNR considerably higher than that of images with maximal arterial enhancement. The quality of the resulting images approaches that of CTA images and offers the additional advantages to automatically differentiate between arteries and veins."

These malformations derive their arterial supply primarily from meningeal vessels, and the venous drainage is either via dural venous sinuses or through the cortical veins. DAVFs have a reported association with dural sinus thrombosis, venous hypertension, previous craniotomy, and trauma, though many lesions are idiopathic. The diagnosis is dependent on a high level of clinical suspicion and high-resolution imaging. Cross-sectional imaging techniques by using CT and MR imaging aid in the diagnosis, but conventional angiography remains the most accurate method for complete characterization and classification of DAVFs. The pattern of venous drainage observed on dynamic vascular imaging determines the type of DAVF and correlates with the severity of symptoms and the risk of hemorrhage."

The prognosis of patients with early reruptured aneurysms is discouraging. A rerupture of an aneurysm with active bleeding is extremely rare, and the mechanisms involved remain unclear. We report the management of active bleeding of reruptured aneurysms during diagnostic angiography.

Several different specific diseases are included in the ""stroke"" category, including intra- and extracerebral hemorrhage as well as ischemic infarction. These different types of stroke have major differences regarding etiology, management, and prognosis. The goal of stroke imaging is to diagnose the type of stroke at clinical presentation, allowing prompt and appropriate management. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) provide powerful noninvasive means to evaluate the pathologic and metabolic changes that occur in acute stroke. These techniques allow the early detection of stroke and greatly increase the ability to determine the etiology of the stroke. One or more of these methods will surely become a standard means of evaluating acute stroke. The information provided, combined with new stroke therapies, should result in improved patient outcome."

Three patients either had no proteinuria or edema and therefore did not meet all accepted clinical criteria for the diagnosis of eclampsia. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain in all patients demonstrated high-signal foci most prominent in the parieto-occipital regions and the subcortical white matter.

CD009372,0,16910500,0,[A case of encapsulated intracerebral hematoma mimicking metastatic brain tumor].,"We report a case of encapsulated intracranial hematoma (EIH) mimicking metastatic brain tumor. A 77-year-old male with a medical history of prostate cancer was admitted to our hospital presenting with progressive left hemiparesis. Previous head CT scan and MRI findings during 3 weeks before admission revealed a subcortical acute to subacute hematoma under the right precentral gyrus with growing perifocal brainedema. The Head DSA showed tumor-stain with vascular compression corresponding to the hemorrhagic mass, and Tl-201 SPECT study revealed high L/N ratio (3.0) and high L/E ratio (0.8). The preoperative diagnosis was metastatic brain tumor originating from prostate cancer, and total removal of the mass was undergone with the postoperative diagnosis of EIH. Neither tumoral component nor vascular malformation was found even by detailed pathological study. EIH is a rare variant of intracranial hemorrhage and most of cases in past reports are preoperatively misdiagnosed as malignant brain tumor. In our case, even Tl-201 SPECT and DSA, which are reported as key studies for distinguishing EIH from other brain tumors, demonstrated brain tumor-like findings. It is necessary to consider the possibility of EIH when we encounter hemorrhagic mass in the brain parenchyma even with brain tumor-like radiographical images."
CD009372,0,3598117,0,Ischemic strokes in children.,"Of 44 infants and children (neonates excluded) with ischemic strokes of arterial origin documented by CT scan and/or cerebral angiography, idiopathic strokes, occurring in 22 cases, accounted for half the total. Eight of these patients had basal ganglia and/or capsular infarcts without cortical involvement. The outcome in the idiopathic group was favorable: after an average follow-up duration of 48 months, no child had recurrence, two children developed secondary epilepsy, and only two were severely mentally retarded. However, residual dystonia and dyskinesia constituted an incapacitating handicap, having been observed in 14 children of the idiopathic group and in 18 of the whole series. It may be concluded from the present study that the long-term prognosis of ischemic strokes in children is excellent except for the risk of secondary evolutive dystonia in the absence of any detectable cause."

CD009372,0,9535306,0,Stroke and fibromuscular dysplasia: confirmation by renal magnetic resonance angiography.,"Childhood stroke is uncommon and may require extensive evaluation to elucidate an underlying cause. A 9-year-old boy had clinical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features of an ischemic event in the left middle cerebral artery territory. Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) revealed beading of the left middle cerebral artery, consistent with irregular blood flow secondary to turbulence or luminal narrowing. Conventional angiography of the cerebral vessels confirmed the findings of cerebral MRA and raised further the suspicion of fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD). MRA of the renal vessels was subsequently performed, revealing beading of the left renal artery and confirming the diagnosis of FMD. MRA, a rapid and less invasive technique associated with far less morbidity and mortality as compared with conventional angiography, may prove to be as sensitive as conventional angiography in detecting the changes of FMD. MRA of the renal arteries should be performed with initial cranial MRI and MRA in children who present with cerebral infarction of possible vascular origin. This may obviate the need to perform further investigations and may make early diagnosis possible at the first MRI scan and under a single general anesthetic."

We carried out MRI within 6 h of symptom onset on five patients with minor (low Hunt and Hess grades 1 or 2) subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) diagnosed by CT to search for any specific pattern. We used our standard stroke MRI protocol, including multiecho proton density (PD)- and T2-weighted images, echoplanar (EPI) diffusion- (DWI) and perfusion- (PWI) weighted imaging, and MRA. In all cases SAH was clearly visible on PD-weighted images with a short TE. In four patients it caused a low-signal rim on the T2*-weighted source images of PWI, and DWI revealed high signal in SAH. In the fifth patient SAH was perimesencephalic; susceptibility effects from the skull base made it impossible to detect SAH on EPI DWI and T2*-weighted images. Perfusion maps were normal in all cases. MRA and conventional angiography revealed an aneurysm in only one patient. Stroke MRI within 6 h of SAH thus shows a characteristic pattern."

Twenty-three patients had native valve infectious endocarditis and 7 had prosthetic valve endocarditis. The clinical features were characterized by the frequency of aortic valve involvement (23 out of 30) and other complications, especially cardiac failure (16 cases) and peripheral vascular manifestations (7 cases). The commonest organism was the staphylococcus (53% of identified organisms) but the number of negative blood cultures was high (50% of cases). The neurological complication was often the presenting symptom of the endocarditis (19 cases) but it occurred after bacteriological cure in 4 cases. The complications observed were cerebral ischemia (16 cases), cerebral haemorrhage (11 cases), coma (2 cases), and one peripheral neuropathy causing a Claude Bernard Horner syndrome. These complications presented with hemiplegia in 17 cases, a meningeal syndrome in 8 cases, a convulsion in 1 case, a Von Wallenberg syndrome in 1 case, and a Claude Bernard Horner syndrome in 1 case. Twelve patients had a transient or permanent neurological coma. Cerebral CT scan showed ischemic lesions in 7 cases and haemorrhagic lesions in 10 cases. Carotid angiography demonstrated mycotic aneurysms in 6 patients. Twelve patients died: the cause of death was neurological coma (7 cases), low cardiac output (4 cases) and haemorrhagic shock (1 case). Four patients underwent neurosurgery: 3 for clipping a mycotic aneurysm and 1 for drainage of an intracerebral haematoma. Poor prognostic factors were: coma, cardiac failure, cardiac valve prosthesis and, above all, the extent and multiplicity of the neurological lesions. The authors propose the following measures to improve the prognosis: early surgery in cases of large and/or mobile vegetations especially when the infecting organism is a staphylococcus and when a systemic embolism has occurred; routine CT scanning and/or digitised cerebral angiography in all patients with infective endocarditis to detect surgically accessible mycotic aneurysms."

The patient responded well to corticosteroid therapy and there was later angiographic evidence of healing. After systemic angiitis and central nervous system infection were excluded, the diagnosis of isolated benign cerebral vasculitis was made. According to past reports, at least 13 patients have been described as having isolated benign cerebral vasculitis. The common features of isolated benign cerebral vasculitis are as follows: 1) benign evolution, 2) sensitiveness to corticosteroids, 3) absence or minimal change of CSF findings, 4) angiographic pattern of arteritis, 5) the most common symptom is headache.

CD009372,0,16944161,0,High spatial resolution contrast-enhanced MR angiography of the supraaortic arteries using the quadrature body coil at 3.0T: a feasibility study.,"To examine whether the the increased signal-to-noise (S/N) available at 3.0T would permit the use of the quadrature body coil for high spatial resolution contrast-enhanced (CE) MR angiography (MRA), and whether the large FOV that was used in our routine 1.5T protocol would also be feasible at 3.0T. In a prospective study, 43 patients and five volunteers were examined on a clinical whole-body 3.0T MR unit (Intera, Philips Medical Systems, Best, The Netherlands) after institutional review board approval and informed consent. Three-dimensional CE MRA (T1 gradient echo-sequence with TR/TE = 5.7/1.93 msec.; acquisition time, 1:54 min.) using randomly segmented central k-space ordering (CENTRA) was acquired with the quadrature body coil, using over a FOV of 350 mm. A high-image matrix of 432x432 yielded a non-zero filled voxel size of 0.81 mm x 0.81 mm x 1.0 mm (0.66 mm(3)). For quantitative analysis, contrast ratios (CR) between vessels (S) and signal in surrounding tissue (ST) were calculated [(S-ST)/(S+ST)]. For qualitative analysis, image quality and presence of artifacts were rated by two radiologists in consensus on a five-point scale (1=excellent to 5=nondiagnostic). Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) served as the standard of reference in patients with vascular disease. In the five volunteers, 1.5T CE MRA using a phased array neurovascular coil was available for intraindividual comparison. 3.0T CE MRA was successfully performed in 48/48 subjects (100%). Mean CR+/- SD were 0.76 (139.30/182.42) and 0.87 (235.18/270.14) at 3.0T and 1.5T respectively . Mean image quality was 3.82+/-0.86. Intraindividual comparison between 1.5T and 3.0T CE MRA in the volunteers revealed no significant difference in image quality (4.2+/-0.74 vs 4.6+/-0.80; p>0.05). Vascular disease was correctly identified in 13/13 patients with DSA correlation. CE MRA of the supraaortic arteries is feasible at 3.0T using a large FOV of 350 mm. The signal gain at 3.0T enables high spatial resolution contrast-enhanced MR angiography by using the built-in quadrature body coil only."
CD009372,0,10399263,0,Clinical utility of magnetic resonance angiography in the evaluation of aneurysms from a neurosurgical point of view.,"The possibilities and limitations of MRA in the evaluation of intracranial aneurysms were investigated in this study. 54 patients, 30 with acute SAH were diagnosed using the three dimensional time-of-flight MRA in comparison with a conventional four vessel digital subtraction angiography prior to surgery. Furthermore, postoperative MRA was performed to assess clip placement and vessel patency and to search for innocent additional aneurysms in patients with emergency surgery due to intracerebral hemorrhage causing mass effect in whom preoperatively only the side of the lesion was investigated in DSA. 64 aneurysms in all vessel territories were detected. Three aneurysms were missed in MRA and there were three false positive results. Four baby-aneurysms were missed by both imaging modalities and were found during surgery. In all patients with CT scans suspicious of aneurysms MRA was able to detect or rule out the aneurysm. Postoperative MRA to demonstrate clip placement and vessel patency was not possible due to susceptibility artefacts. MRA should be the diagnostic procedure of first choice in CT findings suspicious of aneurysms. The follow-up of confirmed aneurysms is safely possible. MRA is very well applicable in the acute setting after SAH. The axial acquisition films and the rotatable maximum intensity projection reconstructions provide useful insights into the location of the aneurysm and its neighboring structures thus influencing the preoperative planning of surgical strategies. Keeping the limitations in mind it is a safe tool in the evaluation of aneurysms, especially with the rapidly improving postoprocessing possibilities."
CD009372,0,22567808,0,Carotid and vertebral arterial dissections in the emergency department.,"Although carotid and vertebral (cervical) arterial dissections are not common presentations to the emergency department, timely and appropriate diagnostic strategies will allow early initiation of effective treatment therapies. Cervical arterial dissection occurs when the intimal wall of an artery is damaged as a result of trauma or defect. As blood fills the layers of the arterial wall, thrombi form, which can lead to stroke, pseudoaneurysm, vessel occlusion, and stroke. Intracranial dissections may result in subarachnoid hemorrhage. Because cervical arterial dissections may present with common signs and symptoms such as headache, neck pain, neurological deficits, and stroke, it is essential that dissection be considered early and ruled out quickly. Computed tomographic angiography, magnetic resonance angiography, and digital subtraction angiography may be used for diagnosis. Anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy is the mainstay of treatment for spontaneous or traumatic dissections and will reduce the risk of stroke. Endovascular therapy or surgery may be indicated. Recurrence or rebleeding is a significant risk and must be managed."
CD009372,0,17050521,0,State-of-the-art imaging of acute stroke.,"Stroke is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity in the developed world. The goals of an imaging evaluation for acute stroke are to establish a diagnosis as early as possible and to obtain accurate information about the intracranial vasculature and brain perfusion for guidance in selecting the appropriate therapy. A comprehensive evaluation may be performed with a combination of computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance (MR) imaging techniques. Unenhanced CT can be performed quickly, can help identify early signs of stroke, and can help rule out hemorrhage. CT angiography and CT perfusion imaging, respectively, can depict intravascular thrombi and salvageable tissue indicated by a penumbra. These examinations are easy to perform on most helical CT scanners and are increasingly used in stroke imaging protocols to decide whether intervention is necessary. While acute infarcts may be seen early on conventional MR images, diffusion-weighted MR imaging is more sensitive for detection of hyperacute ischemia. Gradient-echo MR sequences can be helpful for detecting a hemorrhage. The status of neck and intracranial vessels can be evaluated with MR angiography, and a mismatch between findings on diffusion and perfusion MR images may be used to predict the presence of a penumbra. The information obtained by combining various imaging techniques may help differentiate patients who do not need intravenous or intraarterial therapy from those who do, and may alter clinical outcomes."

Graft vs. host disease prophylaxis was daily cyclosporine for 6 months. There were no significant complications during BMT. Engraftment occurred on day +17 and the patient was transfusion independent since day +45. Pre-BMT cerebral arteriography showed multiple stenotic cerebral vessels and a moya-moya pattern. Perfusion MRI demonstrated reduced capillary perfusion. Approximately 170 days after BMT the patient experienced episodes of transient left-sided weakness and speech problems. Neuroimaging revealed progression of large vessel pathology by angiography despite significant improvement in cortical perfusion (MR perfusion scan). Molecular analysis by PCR and DNA fingerprinting confirmed absence of mixed mosaicism. Rheologic evaluation showed normal corrected bulk viscosity. It is possible that progression of large vessel pathology and return of clinical symptoms in the face of normal rheologic parameters may be due to worsening of the already damaged cerebral vessels by the BMT conditioning regimen. Further evaluations of patients with SCA undergoing BMT after a stroke are needed to answer this question."

It was possible to identify the expected cause of these initial false-negative angiograms in four of those seven patients. The aneurysm was located in the anterior communicating artery (ACoA) complex in four of the seven patients. When interpreting the angiograms of patients with SAH, neurologists and neurosurgeons should bear in mind the finding that the ACoA complex is the most frequent site of ""initially occult"" aneurysms.

What is progressing stroke?","In order to understand the mechanism of clinical worsening in patients with cerebral infarction, attention was focused on the changes in cerebral angiograms obtained repeatedly before and after neurological deterioration. Among 212 stroke patients with minor neurological deficits, incomplete hemiparesis progressed to complete hemiplegia in 15 patients several days after the beginning of symptoms. On admission, 3 had internal carotid artery occlusion, 2 had stenosis of the internal carotid artery, 5 had occlusion of the middle cerebral arterial trunk, 2 had occlusion of the middle cerebral arterial branch, and 3 had no angiographically visible occlusion. The changes between the first and the second angiograms were of different varieties: another recurrent occlusion, progression of occlusion, new occlusion in the cerebral arteries opacified through the collateral pathway, recanalization of the initially occluded artery, and no change. Such different patterns of pathophysiological events show that the mechanism of neurological worsening in infarcted patients is not uniform. Based on the results from the present study, several problems which arose during the investigation and the somewhat vague definition of ""progressing stroke"" currently in use are discussed."
CD009372,0,1857782,0,[Comparison of magnetic resonance angiography and digital angiography of the epiaortic vessels].,"Atheromasic lesions and other pathologic conditions of the arterial vessels of the neck are the most frequent causes of cerebrovascular disease. Diagnostic imaging currently employs digital subtraction angiography (DSA), Doppler, and color-Doppler US to study these conditions. Digital subtraction intraarterial angiography (DSAA) can provide both an early diagnosis and an accurate preoperative depiction of neck vessels; however, in spite of its effective value, it still remains an invasive technique. Magnetic Resonance angiography (angio-MR) is the latest technique allowing the depiction of neck vessels morphology. It shares with digital angiography the capability of supplying spatial depiction of all the examined vascular structures, and with US its noninvasiveness. The authors investigated angio-MR capabilities in providing accurate and detailed images of neck arteries; the images were then compared with DSA ones. Thirty patients with cerebrovascular diseases were studied. MR imaging was performed with a 1.5 T unit with a dedicated coil, and gradient-echo sequences were employed. Refocused sequences for flow were acquired on both the coronal and the sagittal planes, with the following parameters: TR 40, TE 10, flip angle 25 degrees, acquisition volumes 80-35 mm, 64-15 frames. Digital angiography demonstrated 101 vascular lesions: 27 slight stenoses (less than 30%), 19 mild stenoses (31-70%), 12 severe stenoses (71-99%), 7 occlusions, 14 coilings, 7 kinkings, and 15 hypoplasias of vertebral artery. In slight stenoses, angio-MR underestimated the condition in 11/27 patients. In mild and severe stenoses, as well as in occlusive diseases, angio-MR tended to overestimate the condition. In coiling, kinking, and hypoplasia, angio-MR yielded the same results as DSA."

CD009372,0,7800126,0,Vascular considerations and complications in cranial base surgery.,"The technical evolution of cranial base surgery has resulted in approaches that allow more radical surgical extirpation of complex cranial base lesions. Our service has extensively applied these cranial base approaches for lesions of the cranial base. A subgroup of 100 patients who had cranial base tumors involving potential manipulation or sacrifice of carotid arteries underwent 20-minute balloon test occlusions coordinated with vascular assessments consisting of a combination of the following: 1) four-vessel cerebral angiogram with compression studies; 2) occlusion transcranial Doppler ultrasonography; 3) occlusion single-photon emission computed tomography perfusion studies; and 4) xenon-133 cerebral blood flow studies. Transient neurological deficits associated with balloon test occlusion occurred in 7 of 100 patients (7%). Subsequently, 18 patients underwent permanent carotid occlusion by endovascular detachable balloons. Delayed ischemic complications (> 72 h) occurred in 4 of 18 (22%) patients. Additionally, a number of vascular complications not predicted by the balloon occlusion tests and vascular assessments were experienced. Repeat vascular assessments defined the causes and guided treatment of ischemic patients. Ischemic complications were caused by hemodynamic insufficiency, embolization, vasospasm, radiation vasculopathy, and venous anomaly. Our experience leads us to believe that no vascular assessment exists today that can predict the occurrence of vascular complications accurately. The current enthusiasm for cranial base surgery must be tempered with the sober reality that management of cerebrovascular anatomy and physiology remain significant limitations.

After institutional review board approval, a retrospective study was performed of 43 consecutive patients <or=40 years, who presented to our emergency department with IPH and that were evaluated with MD CTA. MD CTA images were reviewed by a neuroradiologist to determine IPH location, presence of a vascular abnormality, and associated extraparenchymal hemorrhage. Diagnostic accuracy was measured comparing it to the available reference standards, which included conventional catheter angiogram (CCA), surgical macroscopic findings, and pathology results. Medical records were reviewed for risk factors and correlation with final diagnosis. MD CTA demonstrated an accuracy of 97.7%, with a sensitivity of 96.4% (95% CI 0.79-0.99) and a specificity of 100% (95% CI 0.74-0.99) for the detection of vascular abnormalities in young patients with IPH. Additionally, MD CTA had a PPV of 100%, and the NPV 93.8% in this population. Of the 43 patients included in the study, 28 patients (65%) had a causative vascular etiology for the IPH. Among the 28 patients with vascular etiologies for the IPH, 11 had an AVM (39.2%), nine a ruptured aneurysm (32.14%), seven dural venous sinus thrombosis (25%), and one had vasculitis (3.57%). MD CTA is highly accurate in the detection of vascular abnormalities in the setting of IPH, which as a group represents the most frequent etiology of IPH among patients age <or=40 years. MD CTA performed in the Emergency Department provides accurate, rapid and critical presurgical and premedical treatment information in young patients with IPH."

Fifty patients underwent MRA of the intracranial vessels with the TOF 3D (FISP) and the TOF 2D (FISP) techniques. Five patients were affected with sinus stenosis. MRA was performed with a 1.5-T superconductive magnet and a circular head coil. All patients underwent Magnetic Resonance Angiography with FISP 2D sequences (FA 40 degrees, TR 40 ms, TE 12 ms) acquired on coronal plane as well as FISP 3D (FA 15 degrees, TR 30 ms, TE 7 ms) acquired on axial plane. In the patients in whom FISP 2D sequences correctly demonstrated the whole confluence of sinuses, FISP 3D sequences always depicted the upper sagittal sinus, while the right transverse sinus was seen in 84.4% (38/45) of cases and the left transverse sinus in 24.2% (11/45) of cases. In the patients with a stenosis in the confluence of sinuses, FISP 3D sequences demonstrated two false-positive cases with respect to FISP 2D. The statistical analysis (McNemar test) of the results demonstrated the difference between 2D and 3D sequences in the detection of the two transverse sinuses to be statistically significant: p < 0.01 for the right transverse sinus and p < 0.001 for the left transverse sinus. In the study of the intracranial vessels (TOF 3D technique) the absence of one of the two transverse sinuses is suggestive of a diagnostic pitfall; the combination of 3D and 2D sequences answers this diagnostic question."
CD009372,0,6462338,0,[Use of real-time ultrasonography in neurosurgical operations].,"The authors' experience with the application of real-time ultrasonography during 29 and after 3 neurosurgical operations is reported. Intraoperative sonography was performed in 29 cases. The neurosurgical operations include aneurysm surgery in 13 cases, removal of intracerebral hematoma in 11 cases, neoplasm surgery in 2 cases, and so on. Moreover, sonographic examination through bone defect was performed in 3 cases after decompression craniectomy. The instrument used was an ATL (Advanced Technology Laboratories, Bellevue, WA, USA) mechanical sector scanner of which scanhead contained transducers of three frequencies: 3, 5 and 7.5 MHz. The scanhead was wrapped with a sterile rubber bag after acoustic coupling gel had been applied to the head's tip. Then the scanhead was placed on the dura and ultrasonic examination was performed. The result was that the lesion was clearly identified and localized in all cases except for three cases of mild subarachnoid hemorrhage. In addition, in the two cases of needle aspiration of cyst or hematoma, the needle was easily identified and needle aspiration was performed safely and accurately. Moreover, during aneurysm surgery, aneurysm itself was detected in two cases by the real-time ultrasonic imaging. Especially, in the case with large aneurysm of the left middle cerebral artery, the findings about the aneurysmal wall, that is to say, which part is thick and which part is thin, could be obtained. Prior to the operation of aneurysm, cerebral angiogram and computerized tomographic scan are always examined thoroughly, but information about aneurysmal wall can be rarely obtained by them.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD009372,0,22473742,0,Rapid time-resolved magnetic resonance angiography via a multiecho radial trajectory and GraDeS reconstruction.,Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography is challenging due to the need for both high spatial and temporal resolution. A multishot trajectory composed of pseudo-random rotations of a single multiecho radial readout was developed. The trajectory is designed to give incoherent aliasing artifacts and a relatively uniform distribution of projections over all time scales. A field map (computed from the same data set) is used to avoid signal dropout in regions of substantial field inhomogeneity. A compressed sensing reconstruction using the GraDeS algorithm was used. Whole brain angiograms were reconstructed at 1-mm isotropic resolution and a 1.1-s frame rate (corresponding to an acceleration factor > 100). The only parameter which must be chosen is the number of iterations of the GraDeS algorithm. A larger number of iterations improves the temporal behavior at cost of decreased image signal-to-noise ratio. The resulting images provide a good depiction of the cerebral vasculature and have excellent arterial/venous separation.

We discuss possible treatment for patients with moyamoya disease accompanied with distal choroidal artery aneurysms and review the literature to summarize clinical treatment and mechanisms. The cases of three male patients who suffered from intraventricular hemorrhage are presented. Computed tomography (CT) and digital subtractive angiography (DSA) revealed that bleeding was believed to be caused by ruptured aneurysms originating from distal choroidal artery aneurysms. Two patients successfully underwent superficial temporal artery (STA)-middle cerebral artery (MCA) bypass combined with encephalo-duro-myo-synangiosis (EDMS) and the obliteration of the aneurysm. The follow-up DSA or CT scan demonstrated that the aneurysms completely disappeared with the patency of the reconstructed artery. Neither of the patients experienced rebleeding during the follow-up period (up to 34 months). Given conservative treatment, the third patient experienced recurrent hemorrhages 4 months after the first ictus. This study describes treatment for moyamoya disease accompanied with distal choroidal artery aneurysms. Our experience suggests that cerebral revascularization combined with obliteration of the complicated distal aneurysm in the same session is a possible treatment."

The patient is a 48-year old male with a progressive spastic paraparesis of months' duration who presented acute headache, confusion, severe left hemiparesis with sensory deficit and homonymous hemianopsia. A cranial computed tomography scan showed an extensive right temporal lobe hemorrhage with subarachnoid invasion. Brain angiographic and angio-magnetic resonance imaging studies excluded hemorrhage-predisposing vascular abnormalities. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies disclosed mononuclear pleocytosis with elevated protein levels. Both serum and CSF anti-Borrelia titers were significantly increased, and serum Western Blot showed bands to protein 34 (ops B), 57, 59 and 62.

Thus, the purpose of the study was to evaluate the feasibility of a comprehensive 60-min MR-based screening examination in healthy volunteers and a limited number of patients with known target disease. In ten healthy volunteers (7 men, 3 women; mean age, 32.4 years) and five patients (4 men, 1 woman; mean age, 56.2 years) with proven target disease we evaluated the performance of a comprehensive MR screening strategy by combining well-established organ-based MR examination components encompassing the brain, the arterial system, the heart, the lungs, and the colon. All ten volunteers and five patients tolerated the comprehensive MR examination well. The mean in-room time was 63 min. In one volunteer, insufficient colonic cleansing on the part of the volunteer diminished the diagnostic reliability of MR colonography. All remaining components of the comprehensive MR examination were considered diagnostic in all volunteers and patients. In the five patients, the examination revealed the known pathologies [aneurysm of the anterior communicating artery ( n=1), renal artery stenosis ( n=1), myocardial infarct ( n=1), and colonic polyp ( n=2)]. The outlined MR screening strategy encompassing the brain, the arterial system, the heart, the lung, and the colon is feasible.

CD009372,0,11452501,0,[A case of aneurysm of the peripheral middle cerebral artery undetectable on preoperative angiogram].,"The authors describe a rare case of an aneurysm of the peripheral middle cerebral artery. A 63-year-old female with a past history of hypertension suddenly fell into a comatose state, and was brought to our hospital. On admission, CT scan showed intracerebral hematoma located in the right putamen with diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage. To exclude vascular lesions, an angiography was performed just after admission. The right carotid angiogram showed an aneurysm at the cavernous portion of the internal carotid artery (ICA), but failed to show any aneurysms in the rest of the intracranial circulation. Just after the angiography, emergent operation was performed for the main purpose of evacuation of the hematoma, and with only the secondary purpose of searching for undetectable aneurysms. The patient underwent a right frontotemporal craniotomy. After partial evacuation of the hematoma through the corticotomy of the right frontal operculum, the Sylvian fissure was opened widely. No aneurysm was observed either in the main trunk of the right ICA or the middle cerebral artery (MCA). During the final stage of evacuation of the hematoma through the corticotomy, arterial bleeding occurred. While evacuating the blood, we detected a saccular aneurysm arising from MCA branch (M2-M3 junction) and we clipped the aneurysm. We discuss peripheral MCA aneurysms with a review of the literature."

All patients underwent panangiography for definitive diagnosis. The dAVF were supplied by the external carotid artery system alone (14 patients), both external and internal carotid systems (10 patients) or both anterior and posterior circulation (6 patients). Depending on the venous drainage the fistulas were classified following a modification of Djindjian's description with 18 patients revealing Type I (main sinus with antegrade flow), 5 Type II a (main sinus with reflux into the contralateral sinus). 5 Type II b (cortical veins), 1 Type II a+b (both) and 1 of Type III (direct cortical drainage). Bruit, pulsatile tinnitus and headaches were the most common symptoms. 6 patients presented with intracranial haemorrhage, 4 with progressive neurological deficit or seizures and 3 with dementia. Arterial embolization was performed in all cases except one, where a transvenous approach for balloon occlusion of the transverse sinus was performed. 21 patients were treated by single or repeated embolization alone. Only in 9/21 cases did arterial embolization result in complete occlusion of the fistula. In 12/21 patients incomplete occlusion was achieved. Following embolization 8 patients underwent additional surgery including coagulation of the feeding arteries and arterialized veins, sinus resection and reconstruction of the sinus. Overall, 18 patients were cured, 11 improved and 1 patient was unchanged. There was a total number of 5 complications including transient stroke, transient facial nerve palsy, and a small necrotic skin area following embolization. Venous infarction of the occipital lobe was induced by transvenous occlusion and surgical resection of the transverse sinus in one patient each, respectively. From our results we conclude that the endovascular therapy alone is the treatment of choice in case of Type I fistulas. In dAVF of Type II and III repeated endovascular treatment seems not to be sufficient and additional surgery is necessary."

This article emphasizes new observations on transient focal neurological episodes in the context of cerebral amyloid angiopathy, a common but under-recognized small vessel disease most often encountered as a cause of symptomatic lobar intracerebral hemorrhage. Transient focal neurological episodes in cerebral amyloid angiopathy are of clinical and pathophysiological interest because they can mimic transient ischemic attacks, but are probably more often related to bleeding (especially superficial cortical siderosis or focal convexity sub-arachnoid hemorrhage) rather than ischemia. Importantly, such episodes may also herald a very high future risk of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage. The article highlights scenarios encountered in clinical practice and discusses implications for patient care including: (a) the value of blood-sensitive magnetic resonance imaging sequences in investigating transient focal neurological episodes; and (b) treatment implications, as giving antiplatelet or anticoagulant drugs for these episodes could increase the risk of serious intracerebral hemorrhage."
CD009372,0,16770665,0,Patterns of damage in the mature neonatal brain.,"Patterns of damage in the mature neonatal brain can be subdivided into focal, multifocal and diffuse. The main cause of diffuse brain damage in the term newborn is hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE). HIE is still the major recognized perinatal cause of neurological morbidity in full-term newborns. MRI offers today the highest sensitivity in detecting acute anoxic injury of the neonatal brain. Conventional acquisition techniques together with modern diffusion techniques can identify typical patterns of HIE injury, even in the early course of the disease. However, even though highly suggestive, these patterns cannot be considered as pathognomonic. Perinatal metabolic disease such as kernicterus and severe hypoglycaemia should be differentiated from classic HIE. Other conditions, such as infections, non-accidental injury and rarer metabolic diseases can be misinterpreted as HIE in their early course when diffuse brain swelling is still the predominant MRI feature. Diffusion techniques can help to differentiate different types of diffuse brain oedema. Typical examples of focal injuries are arterial or venous infarctions. In arterial infarction, diffusion techniques can define more precisely than conventional imaging the extent of focal infarction, even in the hyperacute phase. Moreover, diffusion techniques provide quantitative data of acute corticospinal tract injury, especially at the level of the cerebral peduncles. Venous infarction should be suspected in every case of unexplained cerebral haematoma in the full-term newborn. In the presence of spontaneous bleeding, venous structures should always be evaluated by MR angiography."

In general, the current practice is to treat these patients conservatively and repeat studies to rule out a treatable cause 6 weeks to 3 months later; more often than not these repeated studies fail to reveal any findings, and the patient is treated conservatively. For years, the senior author (R.C.H.) has treated these patients with early surgical exploration. This study was undertaken prospectively to ascertain the frequency of positive findings during surgical exploration."
CD009372,0,17720199,0,Spontaneous obliteration of MRI-silent cerebral angiomatosis revealed by CT angiography in a patient with Sturge-Weber syndrome.,"Type I Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS) is a neurocutaneous syndrome characterized by facial port wine stain and ipsilateral leptomeningeal angiomatosis. It is commonly complicated by glaucoma and neurological disturbances including seizures, hemiparesis, transient stroke-like deficits, and behavioral problems. Gadolinium-enhanced MRI is the study of choice for demonstrating the leptomeningeal angiomatosis, and is particularly useful for making the diagnosis. Cerebral hematoma and spontaneous obliteration of cerebral angiomatosis have never been reported in SWS. We describe a patient with type I SWS in which a hemorrhage in the left temporal lobe was caused by an underlying angiomatosis. No arteriovenous malformations were detected by brain CT or gadolinium-enhanced MRI, whereas a small angiomatous nidus draining into an ectasic venous collector near the hematoma was disclosed by brain CT angiography. Carotid angiography, performed 3 years after the hemorrhage, demonstrated the spontaneous obliteration of the angioma. This description expands the phenotypic spectrum of type I SWS in which the occurrence of cerebral hemorrhage and MRI-silent cerebral angiomatosis should be included, and emphasizes the need of performing a brain CT angiography in SWS patients whose routine neuroimaging studies fail to detect potentially harmful vessel malformation."
CD009372,0,8752466,0,[The current role of cerebral angiography in diagnosis of cerebrovascular disease].,"The role of cerebral angiography in diagnosis of cerebrovascular disease has changed considerably because of the increasing availability of neuroimaging (CT, MRI), especially MR angiography (MRA). MRA has almost entirely taken the place of cerebral angiography as a screening procedure in evaluation of the cervical carotid arteries and main trunks of intracranial arteries. However, detection of accurate morphological changes of arterial walls requires cerebral angiography, especially in cases of arteritis, arterial dissection and aneurysm of smaller than 3 mm in diameter. Cerebral angiography is still needed in order to obtain a more precise three dimensional concept of the vascular lesion, esp. in vascular malformations, their detailed blood supply, venous drainage and even for a mere (but definitive) diagnosis in some cases. Angiography is essential in preoperative surgical planning, for evaluation of residual AVM after surgery, etc. Technically, intraarterial stereoscopic DSA and serial cerebral angiography in stereoscopic magnification are most useful for angiographic diagnosis. Intravenous DSA has no advantage over MRA and is therefore no longer a useful diagnostic procedure. Cerebral angiography is also useful for evaluation of cerebral circulation which is most useful in conjunction with SPECT study. Although interventional neuroradiology has made a significant stride in the past, it requires further technical improvements and more skillful performance in the future."

These cases are not strictly correlated with haematologic alterations. The aetiopathogenesis remains uncertain in the most of patients, in which predisposing causes are absent and angiographic pictures do not demonstrate anatomical lesions or occlusions of cerebral vessels.

Three of the five patients had unruptured intracranial aneurysms and two underwent surgery with no mortality or morbidity. Our review of the literature revealed that the surgical risk of unruptured intracranial aneurysms is smaller than the risk of bleeding in conservatively treated patients. We discuss the importance of an early diagnosis, and early operation for unruptured aneurysms in patients with polycystic kidney disease and stress the need for intensive care for their renal dysfunction and hypertension during and after the operation."
CD009372,0,15708227,0,Thrombosed vertebral artery aneurysm presenting with hemorrhage and bulbar compression: report of two cases.,"Bulbar compression by vertebral artery (VA) aneurysm is extremely rare and only reported in a few cases. We report two cases with thrombosed VA aneurysm compressing medulla oblongata; one presented with bulbar apoplexy hemorrhage and the other with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). A 61-year-old male (case 1) presented with consciousness disturbances, left hemiplegia, and subsequent respiratory arrest. He was subjected to controlled ventilation, and computed tomography (CT) scan showed bulbar hemorrhage. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and digital subtraction angiogram (DSA) revealed fusiform right VA aneurysm with partial thrombosis and bulbar compression. Intra-aneurysmal embolization with Guglielmi detachable coils (GDCs) relieved his clinical symptom including respiratory disturbance. Three months after the onset, he remained moderately disabled. A 76-year-old male (case 2) presented with severe headache and subsequent respiratory disturbance. CT scan on admission showed subarachnoid hemorrhage with acute hydrocephalus. Ventricular drainage rapidly improved consciousness while respiratory disturbance persisted over several days. MRI and DSA suggested spontaneous thrombosis of the right VA dissection with bulbar compression. He showed gradual recovery of his respiration over a week. After ventriculo-peritoneal shunting, he was transferred with moderate disability. These results suggest that the elimination of the pulsatile effect of VA aneurysm adjacent to medulla oblongata can improve symptoms caused by aneurysm-related compression. Early diagnosis and appropriate treatment such as intra-aneurysmal embolization for ameliorating the blood flow inside the aneurysm can relieve mass effect and clinical symptoms."
CD009372,0,1881535,0,Extended use of cranial CT in the evaluation of patients with stroke and transient ischaemic attacks.,"The hypothesis was explored that patterns of ischaemic brain damage shown by CT may be of greater value in estimating the relevance of angiographic stenosis in the carotico-vertebral arteries in some patients than presenting clinical features. Five angiographic and six CT abnormalities were defined and charted independently in a blinded manner in 312 patients whom clinical features and subsequent management were known. Charts were combined for statistical analysis. Statistically significant associations were found between two types of CT lesion and angiographic abnormalities, but these were present in only 18% of cases. The distribution of clinical features did not differ significantly within this subset compared to the whole population, from which it was concluded that the hypothesis was upheld. Furthermore significantly more patients in this subset were subjected to carotid endarterectomy, suggesting that management decisions may have been modulated by CT findings in some patients."

We performed a blinded review of 68 acute and subacute hematomas caused by neoplasms (22), hypertension or presumed amyloid angiopathy (27), or vascular malformations (19). The extent of vasogenic edema was quantified on an axial T2-weighted image using the VE ratio: the maximum width of high signal surrounding a hematoma and the mean diameter of the hematoma. Hematomas caused by neoplasm were associated with more vasogenic edema (mean VE ratio 104%+/-15%; mean VE width 2.4+/-0.7 cm) than non-neoplastic hematomas (mean VE ratio 37%+/-5%; P =0.001). When the width of VE was equal to or more half the diameter the hematoma (VE ratio 50%), the positive predictive value for tumor was 66%; when it was equal to or more than the diameter, the positive predictive value was 71%. All six hematomas with VE ratios > or = 150% were caused by neoplasm."

The diagnostic effectiveness of different radiological techniques was compared. In cranial trauma without loss of consciousness no examination should be carried out. Skull films are of little use and may give a false safety, if no fracture is evident. Particular attention is paid to the importance of computed axial tomography in the diagnosis of various pathological conditions. It is revealed that a high agreement between the radiological results and the final clinical diagnosis in the patients with head injuries should be obtained only in the way based on a good cooperation between the radiologist and clinicians."
CD009372,0,8985069,0,Sestamibi parathyroid scanning and preoperative localization studies for patients with recurrent/persistent hyperparathyroidism or significant comorbid conditions: development of an optimal localization strategy.,"For patients with previous thyroid or parathyroid surgery and for those with significant comorbid conditions, noninvasive and invasive modalities exist for the preoperative localization of pathologic parathyroid tissue. Formal localization at our institution involves obtaining two studies that are independently positive for the same location. The studies utilized have included ultrasound, CT scans, MRI, technetium-99m/thallium-201 (Tc-Tl) imaging, and more recently, (99m)Tc-sestamibi (20-25 mCi) (MIBI) scans. These were followed by arteriography and/or venous sampling if necessary. From January 1992 through October 1995, 25 patients underwent preoperative parathyroid localization (10 reoperation, 3 grave hypercalcemia, 2 concurrent goiter, 2 cerebral vascular accident, 1 bleeding disorder, and 1 malignant ventricular arrhythmia) and were evaluated prospectively during the changeover from Tc-Tl to MIBI scanning at our institution. A total of 92 studies were obtained. All 25 patients were operated on by a single surgeon, and in each case the parathyroid adenoma was successfully resected with minimal morbidity (1 permanent hypoparathyroid and 1 temporary recurrent laryngeal nerve injury). True positives interpreted preoperatively: MIBI, 14 of 19 (74%); CT scan, 13 of 19 (68%); Tc-Tl, 4 of 8 (50%), ultrasound, 9 of 20 (45%); MRI, 8 of 14 (57%); arteriography, 3 of 7 (43%); venous sampling, 3 of 4 (75%); and positron emission tomography, 0 of 1. There were no false-positive MIBI scans. These results suggest that when formal parathyroid localization is needed in reoperative/complicated patients, 1) MIBI appears to be the most sensitive and specific study, and 2) the MIBI scan should be the initial study in any situation in which preoperative localization is needed. Ultrasound can be useful for patients with significant comorbidities who have not been previously explored. CT or MRI should then be used if further evaluation is needed. If the use of these noninvasive modalities does not produce positive gland localization, selective venous sampling should be utilized as the definitive procedure."

In total, 25 patients were included in the study (average age 53.2 years, range 25-75 years, 14 male, 11 female), all with intracranial bleeding on unenhanced brain CT and who underwent additional CTA performed on a dual-source CT in a dual-energy acquisition mode. The two X-ray tubes were operated at 140 and 80 kV, respectively. Data were analyzed using dual-energy evaluation software. Virtual unenhanced images were calculated by removing the relative iodine content from each voxel. The virtual unenhanced images were evaluated by a radiologist blinded to the findings of the conventional images related to the presence of intracranial bleeding. The image quality and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) between bleeding and brain tissue were assessed. The virtual image quality was found to be sufficient in 96%. The agreement in detection of intracranial bleeding on virtual and conventional unenhanced images reached 96% in per-lesion analysis and 100% in per-patient analysis. The averaged CNR reached 2.63 in virtual unenhanced images and 3.27 in conventional. Virtual unenhanced images are sufficient for the detection of intracranial bleeding."

Multiple CT scans and cerebral angiography failed to identify any vascular or neoplastic cause for the haemorrhage, and a presumptive diagnosis of hypertensive haemorrhage was made. Shunting of hydrocephalus was followed by early clinical improvement. However, delayed progressive deterioration necessitated MRI scan, which demonstrated a mass lesion in the basal ganglia and midbrain.

While several reports describe nonsurgical management of cerebellar hematomas in adults, the spontaneous resolution of juvenile cerebellar hematomas is almost unknown. This paper describes a 16-year-old boy with a cerebellar hematoma of obscure etiology that was managed conservatively. This report indicates that nonsurgical treatment of cerebellar hematomas, once structural lesions have been excluded, may be attempted in neurologically stable children."

They consisted of fenestration of the middle cerebral artery (MCA), persistent primitive trigeminal artery and four intracranial aneurysms. The patient, 45-year-old male, had an attack of subarachnoid hemorrhage on July 15, 1982. He was transferred and admitted to our Dept. of Neurosurgery on July 27. On admission neurological examinations revealed retinal hemorrhage, bilateral papilledema and abducens nerve paresis on the left. Cerebral angiography demonstrated multiple aneurysms, one in the left vertebral artery, one in the left MCA, one in the right IC-PC junction and one in the fenestrated right MCA and persistent primitive trigeminal artery. Computed tomography (CT) demonstrated high density areas in the basal cistern and bilateral sylvian fissures, and cavum septi pellucidi and cavum Vergae as well. Surgical intervention was done and all aneurysms were clipped or coated successfully. The aneurysm in the fenestrated right MCA had originated from the proximal end of the fenestration of the MCA. The cavum septi pellucidi and cavum Vergae were asymptomatic. The postoperative course was uneventful. The authors discussed the pathogenesis and clinical meanings of fenestration of the MCA and persistent primitive trigeminal artery, and inferred that the genetic abnormality at the stage of development of cerebral vessels could play one part of the formation of intracranial aneurysms, because of the fact that the cerebrovascular anomalies showed high incidence of coexistence of intracranial aneurysms."

The complementary roles of referring physician and neuroradiologist.,"The number and sophistication of neuroimaging methods for identifying location, size, type, and causes of stroke or stroke-like syndromes have expanded rapidly. In acute stroke, computed tomography is used to distinguish between nonhemorrhagic and hemorrhagic infarction and to eliminate several potential alternative diagnoses. Cerebral angiography can identify surgically treatable lesions in patients experiencing transient ischemic attacks and thus aid in preventing stroke. The superb sensitivity of magnetic resonance imaging has opened new vistas in the ongoing investigation of multiinfarct dementia and small infarcts in neurologically ""noneloquent"" regions of the brain.

The type of SAH i.e., nontraumatic perimesencephalic SAH versus focal or generalized non perimesencephalic SAH, as well as the amount and distribution of blood on the initial CT examination are important factors in decision making. 3D-Angio-CT, in 3/5 patients, and MR-angiography (MRA) in 1/5 patients were complementary non-invasive methods to diagnose aneurysms on repeated examinations.

CD009372,0,9809629,0,Echo contrast-enhanced three-dimensional power Doppler of intracranial arteries.,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the potential of contrast-enhanced three-dimensional (3-D) power Doppler (CE3DPD) in the assessment of intracranial vascular structures, and to compare the results with unenhanced 3-D power Doppler (3DPD) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) findings. We insonated 25 patients without cerebrovascular diseases through the temporal bone window using 3DPD and CE3DPD; for comparison, 13 patients underwent MRA. Identification rates of vascular segments and of small branches of intracranial vessels were evaluated by two independent investigators blinded to MRA results. In 21 patients with adequate insonation conditions, CE3DPD significantly improved identification rates compared to 3DPD for the complete visualization of the P1 segment (80.9 vs. 19.0%, p < 0.005, P2 segment (80.9 vs. 42.8%, p < 0.05 and A1 segment (85.7 vs. 38.1%, p < 0.005). Furthermore, CE3DPD depicted, in significantly more examinations, branches of the middle (MCA) and posterior cerebral artery (PCA). Interobserver agreement was higher than 95% for the main intracranial segments and branches of the MCA, but relatively low (80.1-85.7%) for branches of the PCA. In comparison to CE3DPD, MRA identified only parieto-occipital branches of the PCA, temporal branches of the MCA, frontal branches of the anterior cerebral artery and the MCA bifurcation more frequently and accurately. In 4 patients with inadequate acoustic temporal bone windows, the application of a galactose-based microbubble suspension allowed clear 3-D visualization of almost all major intracranial vascular segments and some branches of the large arteries. In conclusion, CE3DPD is a more sensitive ultrasonic tool compared to unenhanced 3-D reconstructions. It makes 3-D ultrasound imaging of the basal cerebral circulation easier to perform and interpret, by providing an improved spatially oriented display of image position. As such, this method may increase operator diagnostic confidence level under pathologic conditions."

The possible relationship between drug usage and the occurrence of intracranial bleeding and cerebral vasculitis in such patients is discussed. A 22-year-old woman died after an intravenous injection of unknown dose of methamphetamine. A computed tomography head scan demonstrated massive subarachnoid hemorrhage and hematoma in corpus callosum. Cerebral angiography revealed nonfilling of bilateral intracranial carotid arteries and extravasation of contrast medium from right pericallosal artery which was visualized retrogradely via vertebral artery. Postmortem studies showed cerebral edema, subarachnoid and intracerebral hemorrhage, and intracranial vasculitis in the absence of aneurysm, arteriovenous malformation or chronic hypertension. Histological findings of necrosis of blood vessel walls with destruction of the elastica and smooth muscle layer, and without leukocytotic infiltration of the blood vessel walls were observed in order of anterior cerebral, middle cerebral, vertebral, posterior cerebral and basilar arteries. These angiographic and histological evidence suggests that such hemorrhage results from the development of fibrinonecrosis in the large intracerebral vessels, in addition to a sudden rise in blood pressure."

CD009372,0,2645691,0,Diagnostic significance of flow separation in the carotid bulb.,"Pulsatile blood flow within the normal carotid sinus involves at least two distinct components. That near the flow divider is laminar and antegrade, whereas a boundary layer separation zone in the posterolateral aspect exhibits transient blood flow reversal. It is now possible to document these flow velocity components using pulsed Doppler ultrasound methods. When atherosclerosis develops, it preferentially involves the posterolateral bulb region, obliterating the normal configuration of the sinus with consequent loss of the flow separation zone. It was therefore hypothesized that if flow separation could be detected, it should be predictive of a normal angiogram. To assess this, we evaluated 20 symptomatic patients and two with only bruits found by duplex scanning to have flow separation in either one or both carotid bulbs and who also underwent cerebral angiography. Initial diagnoses were stroke in seven, reversible ischemic neurologic deficit in one, transient ischemic attack in 12, and bruit in two. Flow separation was bilateral in 13 patients (59%). There were 15 patients with symptoms in the territory of a carotid bulb exhibiting flow separation. By angiography, of the 35 bulbs with boundary layer separation, 27 (77%) were normal, with the remainder showing lesions that reduced the diameter of the vessel by 20% or less. Final diagnoses of the 15 patients with symptoms ipsilateral to a carotid sinus exhibiting flow separation were fibromuscular disease in two, lacunar stroke in three, dissection in two, subclavian steal in one, cardiogenic embolus in three, migraine in one, hyperventilation syndrome in one, kink of the mid-internal carotid artery in one, and no diagnosis in one.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

MMD was diagnosed according to the criteria of the Research Committee on Spontaneous Occlusion of the Circle of Willis in Japan. Eight subjects (4 men and 4 women) were diagnosed as probable MMD without neurological deficits. Thus, the percentage of subjects with asymptomatic MMD on BC was 0.07% for the total group, 0.05% in men and 0.10% in women. The female to male ratio was 3.3:1. The mean age of the MMD patients was 54.0 years (SD 12.0); men 54.8 years (SD 12.8) and women 53.3 years (SD 13.9). Estimates of the prevalence of MMD in the Japanese population were calculated as 50.7 per 100,000 people; 28.9 in men and 94.3 in women. Five patients had a family history of definite MMD and seven had a family history of subarachnoid or intracerebral hemorrhage. MRI and angiography showed stenosis of the bilateral internal carotid arteries (ICA) in five patients and a unilateral ICA in three. Moyamoya vessels were confirmed on cerebral angiography. Our standard BC protocol is limited for the detection of moyamoya vessels in the initial stages of MMD. The present study suggests that the radiological features of MMD are asymptomatic in the early stages of the disease."
CD009372,0,15106337,0,[Angiography].,"The clinical usefulness of three dimensional images was widely recognized. The three dimensional digital subtraction angiography (3D-DSA) well demonstrated anatomical structures of cerebral arteries with high special resolution. This 3D observation allowed high quality planning for aneurysmal coil packing and neck clipping. Because of the bony structure and curvy arterial anatomy in the skull base region, 3D-CTA and MRA was sometimes distureved the demonstration of the anatomical relationship adjacent to the aneurysm. However, 3D-DSA not only demonstrated arterial anatomy, but also analyzed of vascular structure, quantifiably. And it was useful in radiation dose reduction by reduction of DSA exposure number. We believe that 3D-DSA should provided useful information for planning of surgical and endovascular treatment in the field of cerebro-vascular disease."

The parallel image with multiple phased-array coils can improve time resolution and reduce MRI artifacts. Fusion of 3D anatomical MRI with CT, various functional MRI, SPECT, and PET results in precise diagnosis and improves the accuracy in navigational neurosurgery and stereotactic radiosurgery. High-field 3-tesla MRI can be clinically used, but its role on 3D MRI is not clear. As the data of 3D MRI and multi detector-row CT increases, it becomes the major problem how to restore and protect these data."

CD009372,0,22695125,0,Cortical vessel imaging and visualization for image guided depth electrode insertion.,"To avoid intracranial hemorrhage during minimally invasive depth electrode insertion without craniotomy for epilepsy surgery, precise in vivo imaging of cortical vessel and relevant rendering methods are critical, and should be used in preoperative planning. In this study, a non-invasive phase contrast MR angiography (PC-MRA) method was chosen for cortical vessel imaging. After image pre-processing (registration and segmentation), three visualization methods were implemented to optimize the vessel imaging and brain tissue rendering for surgical planning. The processed results were evaluated by comparing with intraoperative photographs. The results showed occurrences of missing vessels between imaging and photos (18.3%, 6 cases), but these could be compensated by realistic sulci visualization methods. The results showed 3D texture mapping to be the most suitable cortex visualization method for use in surgical navigation. Based on the methods and evaluations, a new surgical planning system and criteria of usage were developed with input from the surgeons' experience using the prototype system. This system could greatly help reduce the risk of the intracranial hemorrhage during electrode insertion and also avoid potential risks caused by contrast agent injections for contrast enhanced MRA or CTA."

Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations showed bilateral roundish parasellar and intracavernous masses, with homogeneous contrast-enhancement and absence of subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH). Cerebral angiography revealed bilateral aneurysms of the intracavernous carotid artery. Once considered the age of the patient, the anatomical features of the aneurysms and the risks of traditional or endovascular surgery, we decided not to proceed to any treatment other than the orthoptic correction of the diplopia and the careful correction of arterial hypertension.

It was established in 90% of cases by results of angioscan (type and site of vascular malformation causing the cerebromeningeal hemorrhage are defined with this percent exactitude). Cerebral arteriography provides indispensable precise morphologic data on the vascular malformation: exact site of aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation, orientation of the aneurysm and presence or absence of a collar.

CD009372,0,6728143,0,Can neuropsychological tests detect the sites of cerebrovascular stenoses and occlusions?,"Conventional neuropsychological data may not mirror the site of cerebrovascular stenosis in a patient with mild to moderate symptoms. In this study, three groups of cerebral revascularization candidates failed to differ on an extended Halstead-Reitan battery: patients with symptoms and angiographic results referable to the carotid arterial system, subjects with clinical signs and neuroradiological findings referable to the vertebrobasilar arterial system, and patients with symptoms of cerebral ischemia but negative angiograms. Consistent with previous work, these patients generally were mildly impaired on neuropsychological tests, even though many were not symptomatic at the time of assessment. Neuropsychological tests seem to be sensitive to the presence and severity of cerebral ischemia, but in isolation may not be sufficient to determine the loci of vascular stenoses. The incongruence between angiographic and neuropsychological findings underlines the importance of distinguishing among different levels and types of measurements in defining subgroups of cerebral revascularization candidates. Collaboration among neuroscientists will further our understanding of the interrelationships among neurodiagnostic tests."

Symptoms include neurological deficits, headache, seizures, and coma. There are many predisposing factors for CVST including prothrombotic conditions, oral contraceptives, pregnancy/puerperium, malignancy, infection, and head injury. Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis has no identifiable underlying etiology in about 12.5% to 33% of the cases. Diagnosis has become easier with newer imaging techniques, such as magnetic resonance venography. The treatment options for CVST include symptomatic treatment, anticoagulation (AC), thrombolysis, and thrombectomy.

On the plain scan they presented as a rounded, well defined lesion with a high density in 18 cases and a density equal to or lower than brain tissue in 10 cases. The density could be related to certain histologic features as the amount of connective tissue and extracellular water and the presence of psammoma bodies or lipid storage cells. After administration of contrast a homogeneous, markedly increased, sharply marginated density was seen in most meningiomas. Contrast enhancement appeared to be dependent on the vascularity of the tumour. +/- 50% of the cases demonstrated edema grade II or III. On first interpretation 93% of the meningiomas were recognized as a lesion and a tumour (2 false negative) and 79% as a meningioma (2 false negative and 4 incorrect). Only one false positive C.T. scan was encountered. As a screening method R.N. scanning has about the same accuracy as C.T.; in establishing a definite diagnosis angiography equals C.T.; but C.T. is superior as it combines the diagnostic qualities of both methods."

CD009372,0,11147323,0,[Magnetic resonance angiography in inflammatory brain diseases].,"In this review, we discuss the diagnostic potential of time of flight (TOF) MRA and contrast enhanced (CE) MRA in inflammatory disorders of the meninges and the brain. Cerebrovascular complications are frequently observed during infectious meningoencepalitis. 3D TOF-MRA and CE-MRA are complementary for the detection of basal intracranial artery stenosis and septic cerebral vein and sinus thrombosis due to secondary vasculitis. MRA reveals stenosis and occlusion as indirect signs of vasculitis, whereas MRI shows the inflammation of the brain and meninges and occasionally the vessel wall, together with the ischemic or hemorrhagic complication. In case of septic emboli MRA can detect peripheral occlusions and ""mycotic"" aneurysms. For the diagnosis of noninfectious vasculitides of the intracranial vessels, high resolution 3D TOF-MRA is superior to CE-MRA for the detection of multiloculated segmental stenoses. However, there are presently no prospective studies on the sensitivity and specificity of MRA for these indications. Therefore, only positive MRA results can directly influence clinical management. In case of normal MRA, confirmation by catheder angiography may still be required."

CD009372,0,8204251,0,[Subdural hemorrhage of aneurysmal origin].,"Although most subdural hematomas are considered to be venous in origin, they may also be of arterial origin. When subdural bleeding is due to the rupture of an intracranial aneurysm, most commonly at the middle cerebral or internal carotid arteries, the amount of subdural blood is usually small and of no clinical importance. We describe two patients with subdural hematomas secondary to rupture of an intracranial aneurysm, who needed prompt surgical treatment. The first patient had a left internal carotid artery aneurysm at the origin of the ophthalmic artery. In the second patient the aneurysm was at the anterior communicating artery and rebled into the subdural space directly through a right intraparenchymatous frontobasal hematoma. The most probable mechanism of subdural bleeding in our two patients was the existence of adhesions between the aneurysm and the arachnoid due to previous minor hemorrhages. The indication of cerebral angiography in a patient with subdural hematoma is based mainly upon the existence of meningeal signs, the presence of blood in more than one intracranial compartment or the rapid progression of bleeding."

We evaluate the accuracy of time of flight MR angiography (TOF-MRA) to assess the arterial diameters of the circle of Willis in SAH patients with suspected CVS. MR examinations (1.5 Tesla) including 3D TOF-MRA with maximum intensity projections (MIP) and digital subtraction angiography (DSA) were performed within 24 h in 21 patients with acute aneurysmal SAH and suspicion of CVS. Arterial diameters of the circle of Willis including the distal internal carotid artery (ICA) were measured as ratios to the extradural ICA in standard projections. The diagnosis of CVS was established by comparing the luminal size of baseline and follow-up DSA. The correlation between the arterial ratios measured on MIP angiograms and on follow-up DSA was assessed with Pearson's linear regression analysis. Arterial ratios on MIP angiograms were categorized as correct, overestimated, and underestimated compared to the ratios on follow-up DSA. Pearson's correlation coefficient between the ratios of MIP angiograms and DSA was r = 0.5799 and the regression coefficient was b = 0.4775. Highest correlation was found for the category of severe CVS (r = 0.8201). Of all MIP angiograms, 34.9% showed consistent results compared to the DSA, while 44.2% of MIP images overestimated the vascular narrowing. Standard MIP angiograms from TOF-MRA are not accurate to assess vascular narrowing in patients with suspected CVS after aneurysmal SAH.

Metastatic neoplasms possess such markers as tumor hemorrhage and meningeal involvement suggesting specific extraneural sources. In almost half of these patients, cytologic examination of the CSF should help to identify the malignant cells. Although most gliomas do not metastasize either within or outside the central nervous system, the occurrence of primitive neuroectodermal tumor cells (undifferentiated malignant small cells) in about 20% of all glioblastomas implies spread throughout the CSF and some radioresponsiveness. With thorough clinicomorphologic evaluations of all patients with brain tumors in concert with liberal clinical consultations, the aggressive, newer therapeutic modalities can be used more effectively."
CD009372,0,1766539,0,"[Cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage, and inhibitory effect of nicardipine investigated by means of transcranial Doppler ultrasonography].","Cerebral vasospasm is a major complication associated with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). However, real-time evaluation of vasospasm is very difficult via angiography, CT scan, and cerebral blood flow. In this study, for the evaluation of the arterial narrowing, the flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery (MCAFV) was measured with transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (TCD) in 41 patients with ruptured cerebral aneurysms which were repaired surgically within 48 hours after SAH. MCAFV was measured daily until the 25th day after onset. All patients underwent CT scan, angiography, and neurological assessments upon admission. To clarify the morphological changes of the cerebral vessels due to SAH, angiography was performed again about 10 days after surgery. For evaluation of the efficacy of treatment for vasospasm, 21 out of 41 cases were administered a calcium antagonist (4mg of nicardipine) through the cisternal drain every 12 hours for an average of 10 days. The other 20 cases did not receive nicardipine and served as controls. 15 patients with clinical symptoms had a rapid increase in MCAFV from the 3rd to 6th day after onset, and a high velocity of more than 150cm/sec continued for 7.6 +/- 3.6 days on the average. In marked contrast, 26 patients without clinical symptoms showed only a small increase in MCAFV of less than 110cm/sec. There was a significant correlation between the arterial narrowing of MCA and MCAFV (gamma = 0.72, p less than 0.01) except for 5 cases (12%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD009372,0,10971665,0,Case reports: postpartum cerebral angiopathy in a patient with chronic migraine with aura.,"A 25-year-old woman with a history of chronic severe migraine with aura presented in an apoplectic state 1 week after the delivery of her third child. She developed a severe headache and within hours lapsed into a coma. A CT scan of the brain showed cerebral edema and an occipital hemorrhage. A four-vessel angiogram showed diffuse arterial narrowing of all the intracranial vessels with segmental narrowing of the suprasellar portion of the internal carotid arteries bilaterally. She had no risk factors for stroke or vasculitis. Her pregnancy and delivery were uneventful with no preeclampsia or eclampsia. Apart from ergometrine at the time of the delivery, no vasoconstrictor drugs were used. She recovered spontaneously. Serial CT scans of the brain demonstrated resolution of the edema and hemorrhage with the development of cortical and watershed infarcts. A repeat cerebral angiogram was normal. She was, therefore, diagnosed as having suffered from postpartum cerebral angiopathy, a form of reversible cerebral vasoconstriction, called the Call or Call-Fleming syndrome. The relationship between migraine and postpartum angiopathy in the development of reversible cerebral vasoconstriction is discussed."

The anatomic features of aneurysms can be characterized by three-dimensional reconstructed images by use of rotational digital subtraction angiography (3D-DSA). The purpose of this study was to determine the anatomic factors that could help predict complete endosaccular packing of cerebral aneurysms by use of 3D-DSA and to design a simple scoring system to predict the difficulty of achieving complete occlusion of the aneurysm.

CD009372,0,15645155,0,New developments in MRA: time-resolved MRA.,"For many clinical questions, less invasive angiography methods have at least in part already replaced digital subtraction angiography (DSA) as a routine diagnostic procedure. However, temporal resolution achievable with DSA is still indispensable in some patients. Recent advances in MR hardware performance and imaging techniques permit sub-second frame rate MR angiographies to be performed using a rapidly repeated fast T1 weighted gradient echo sequence during administration of a contrast bolus, and subsequent complex subtraction in k-space to emphasise the difference in phase between stationary tissue and contrast-enhanced blood. This technique allows two-dimensional projection angiograms to be obtained at a temporal frame rate of three images per second and with a spatial in-plane resolution of about one square millimetre. This time-resolved information is important for (a) the detection and follow-up of arteriovenous malformations, including their arterial feeders, the size of the nidus and their venous drainage patterns, (b) the demonstration of dural arteriovenous fistulas, recognised as an early filling of a dural sinus during the early arterial phase, and (c) the characterization of the vascularisation of brain tumours. With regards to vascular malformations, the direction of venous drainage and therefore the most pressing clinical questions concerning the need for therapeutic intervention can be ascertained. This technique is the only MR imaging method able to provide dynamic information on the cerebral vasculature. It therefore constitutes a helpful adjunct to the imaging armentarium in many clinical situations."

A variety of factors have led to under diagnosis of PHACES syndrome in the past including lack of awareness and limited imaging modalities. Also, patients with PHACES syndrome with arterial cerebrovascular abnormalities can present with acute ischemic stroke. However, these patients usually present before one year of age.

CD009372,0,22302557,0,Blood oxygen level dependent angiography (BOLDangio) and its potential applications in cancer research.,"Clinically, development of anti-angiogenic drugs for cancer therapy is pivotal. Longitudinal monitoring of tumour angiogenesis can help clinicians determine the effectiveness of anti-angiogenic therapy. Blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) effect has been widely used for functional imaging and tumour oxygenation assessment. In this study, the BOLD effect is investigated under different levels of oxygen inhalation for the development of a novel angiographic MRI technique, blood oxygen level dependent angiography (BOLDangio). Under short-term (<10 min) generalized hypoxia induced by inhalation of 8% oxygen, we measure BOLD contrast as high as 25% from vessels at 9.4T using a simple gradient echo (GRE) pulse sequence. This produces high-resolution 2D and 3D maps of normal and tumour brain vasculature in less than 10 minutes. Additionally, this technique reliably detects metastatic tumours and tumour-induced intracranial hemorrhage. BOLDangio provides a sensitive research tool for MRI of vasculature under normal and pathological conditions. Thus, it may be applied as a simple monitoring technique for measuring the effectiveness of anti-angiogenic drugs in a preclinical environment."

Twenty-four patients with 26 large intracranial aneurysms underwent MRI and DSA. All these aneurysms, diameter from 15 to 39 mm, were located at internal cerebral artery (n=12), vertebral artery (n=3), basilar artery (n=4), anterior cerebral artery (n=2), middle cerebral artery (n=2), anterior communicate artery (n=2) and posterior communicate artery (n=1). Thirteen cases of hematoma or cavernoma were studied as control group. All patients were examined on GE 1.5T MR system. ECG-gated cine MRA was performed with 2D multi-phase fast gradient-recalled echo sequence in a single section. All the images were analyzed with signal intensity VS time curve for differentiating intraaneurysmal blood flow from static tissue. The results were analyzed by statistic ""t"" test. 3D-CEMRA was performed with spoiled gradient-recalled echo and one dose of Gd-DTPA. All data was processed with multi-plannar reformat (MPR) and tomography for the demonstration of aneurysms in detail. All 26 aneurysms were demonstrated successfully by combined application of both cine MRA and 3D-CEMRA. Compared to DSA and conventional 3D-MOTSA, its sensitivity and specificity figures were both 100%. Cine MRA could differentiate the blood flow from the static tissue. The intensity VS time curves of intraaneurysmal blood flow offered fluctuating form and average signal change between systole and diastole period was about 89.8 +/- 37.4; However, under the control group, intraaneurysmal thrombus or cerebral hemorrhage or cavernomas had no significant signal change and the curves offered steady form with the average signal change being about 8.2 +/- 6.3. There was statistically significant difference between the intraaneurysmal blood flow and static tissue (P=0.025, <0.05). 3D-CEMRA was very useful in demonstrating the aneurysmal size, intraaneurysmal thrombus formation, neck and the detailed relationship of the aneurysm to the surrounding structures. It was concluded that the combined application of both cine MRA and 3D-CEMRA might be a valuable clinical tool for the detection of large intracranial aneurysms."

In each case, the clinical course, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT) and angiographic (AG) findings were evaluated. Patients were followed up from 9 months to 2.5 years postoperatively. MRI was much more sensitive than CT for appreciating the ischaemic tissue. The infarct volume determined by MRI had greater extent than previously detected by CT. If the difference of the infarct volume, detected by MRI and CT was more than 30% the patients appeared to have benefited from bypass surgery as demonstrated clinically as well as with postoperative MRI and AG studies. Patients with lesser difference showed insignificant or no postoperative improvement."

CT scan was made in all patients on admission, with the use of intravenous infusion of contrast agent in 35 patients. Cerebral angiography was performed in 37 patients and MRI was performed in 22 patients. Forty-one patients underwent surgery and the other fourteen patients were treated conservatively. The cause of bleeding had been discovered before surgery in 12 cases; 10 arteriovenous malformations and 2 brain tumors. They were discovered by meticulous neuroradiological investigations including cerebral angiography, MRI, dynamic MRI, MRA and enhancing CT. The cause of bleeding was newly discovered after surgery in 7 cases; all of amyloid angiopathy. It remained unknown in the other 22 surgical cases although hypertensive angiopathy was suspected in eleven of them. Among the 14 patients who received conservative therapy, hemorrhagic diathesis including the use of Warfarin and DIC was the cause of bleeding in four cases and the etiology remained unknown in other ten, although hypertensive angiopathy was suspected in eight of them. The 32 patients in whom the etiology remained unknown had been observed as long as 12-120 months (mean, 40 months) and although bleeding has occurred at different locations in two of these patients, there has been no recurrence of bleeding at the same location in any of them. In conclusion, surgery is not indicated to determine the etiology of subcortical hemorrhage when meticulous neuroradiological investigations fail to disclose any vascular or tumorous lesions."

All 110 patients also had one or more 4-vessel digital subtraction cerebral angiograms. The CT scans were reviewed in each case without knowledge of the angiographic result. In nine patients (8%), SAH was confined to the perimesencephalic area, interpeduncular cistern and/or prepontine region at CT. All nine patients had at least two, and some as many as four, negative cerebral angiograms. Eighteen of the 110 patients (16%) ultimately had negative angiography. Hence, the patients with isolated perimesencephalic haemorrhage (PMH) accounted for 50% of the negative angiograms. There was a significant association between isolated PMH and negative angiography (chi 2 = 50.1, P < 0.005). The specificity of PMH for negative angiography was 100% (95% confidence interval (CI) = 97-100%) and the sensitivity of PMH for a negative study was 50% (95% CI = 16-84%). Six of the 110 patients had basilar artery aneurysms demonstrated angiographically as the cause of their SAH but none of these six had isolated PMH at CT. All patients with isolated PMH were alive and well at follow up and none had suffered repeat SAH or vasospasm-related ischaemic cerebral injury. Perimesencephalic haemorrhage should be distinguished from SAH in general, because of the good prognosis associated with it and the doubtful need for repeat cerebral angiography after an initial negative study."

Nevertheless, it is recognized as a dangerous lesion because of the high risk of intraoperative bleeding associated with this lesion's wide fragile neck. There has been only one report of a blisterlike aneurysm treated by endosaccular packing after surgical wrapping. The authors describe the case of a ruptured blisterlike aneurysm with a pseudoaneurysm cavity, which was treated by coil embolization. This 63-year-old woman suffered a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Three cerebral aneurysms were identified on cerebral angiograms. A large saccular aneurysm at the ophthalmic portion of the right ICA was embolized with Guglielmi Detachable Coils (GDCs). Two small hemipherically shaped aneurysms on the C-2 and C-3 portions of the left ICA were observed conservatively. Thirteen days later, recurrent SAH was identified on computerized tomography scans. Angiography demonstrated the formation of a pseudoaneurysm from the aneurysm on the C-2 portion of the left ICA. Endosaccular embolization with GDCs was performed 40 days after admission. Disappearance of the pseudoaneurysm cavity and residual dome filling was seen immediately after the procedure. Follow-up angiography performed 9 months after embolization demonstrated complete obliteration of the aneurysm. This case illustrates that when treatment options for a blisterlike aneurysm with a pseudoaneurysm are unsuitable during the acute phase, coil embolization can be applied following progression of the lesion into a saccular aneurysm during the chronic stage."

He first experienced repeated transient ischemic attacks, and cerebral angiography disclosed complete occlusion in the cervical portion of the left internal carotid artery. STA-MCA anastomosis was performed, and the ischemic attacks stopped. Postoperative angiography confirmed patency of the anastomosis and good filling of the cortical branches of the left MCA. Five years after surgery, the patient suffered sudden onset of generalized convulsions and consciousness disturbance. Computed tomography disclosed a massive intracerebral hemorrhage in the left frontoparietal region, and angiography revealed an aneurysmal dilatation at the site of the anastomosis that was not seen before. Emergency evacuation of the hematoma and clipping of the aneurysmal dilatation were performed. The patient recovered well and became ambulatory. Histological examination of the surgical specimen showed collagen tissue, indicating a pseudoaneurysm. Patients who undergo STA-MCA anastomosis, especially hypertensive patients, should be followed up by repeated magnetic resonance angiography to confirm the patency of the anastomosis and cerebral perfusion, and to detect the formation of pseudoaneurysms at the anastomosis site, which can cause fatal bleeding."

Throbbing headache occurred several hours prior to his weakness. Brain CT obtained on day 3 demonstrated low density areas in the medial part of the left frontal lobe. Cerebral angiography on day 14 demonstrated dilatation and narrowing of the left anterior cerebral artery (ACA) corresponding to ""pearl and string sign"". The diagnosis of spontaneous ACA dissection was established with clinical features, laboratory findings, and angiographic findings. Antiplatelet therapy was undertaken for the prevention of ischemic events. Serial Brain CT demonstrated hemorrhagic change in the area of infarction. However, there was no definite clinical deterioration. Antiplatelet therapy was withdrawn after hemorrhagic change was noted. Cerebral angiography on day 35 showed improvement of both dilatation and narrowing. Possible reperfusion injury caused by absorption of intramural hematoma seems to be responsible for hemorrhagic change. In patients with cerebral infarction due to dissection of intracranial arteries, antithrombotic therapy is controversial as hemorrhagic complications including hemorrhagic infarction as well as subarachnoidal hemorrhage can occur. Further accumulation of cases is required."

The axial stereoscopic images and multi-projection images were used in 3D-CTA, and the anteroposterior views and lateral views were used in DSA. DSA showed that the vein of Labbe (VL) was the most common venous flow on the lateral or basal surface of the temporal lobe, whereas 3D-CTA demonstrated that the involvement of the temporo-basal vein (TBV) was equal to that of VL in frequency. 3D-CTA showed that the VL flowed into the transverse sinus (TS) on 132 sides, the sigmoid sinus-TS junction on 29 sides, and the lateral tentorial sinus (LTS) on 40 sides. DSA showed that the VL flowed into the TS on 157 sides and into the LTS only on 5 sides. DSA showed that the TBV flowed into the TS on 37 sides but axial 3D-CTA showed that the TBV flowed into the LTS on 48 sides. This inconsistency reflects the difficulty in confirming and identifying these veins on the anteroposterior view of DSA, due to the overlapping of veins and poor delineation. Axial stereo and multi-projection images of 3D-CTA provided practical images of the deep veins of the skull base venous system and showed the relative anatomical relationships of the arteries and bony structures. This information can specify the venous inflow point, and help to determine the direction of approach and working space, and also help to identify intraoperative landmarks for the subtemporal approach. Presurgical examination of the deep venous system with 3D-CTA may help to minimize unexpected injury to veins and venous infarction."
CD009372,0,929652,0,"Incidence of stroke in Frederiksberg, Denmark.","Since 1971, stroke registers in several countries have been cooperating in a study of stroke epidemiology, initiated by WHO. One of the registers covers the population of Frederiksberg, Copenhagen. During the first two years of registration strokes were recorded in 556 Frederiksberg citizens. A certain diagnosis of cerebral hemorrhage--verified by angiography, spinal fluid examination, or autopsy--was made in 10% of the patients; subarachnoid hemorrhage was demonstrated in only 2%; most of the remaining patients probably had cerebral infarction. The overall annual incidence of stroke, when adjusted for age for the Danish population, was 1.9 per 1,000 for males, and 1.6 per 1,000 for females. For every type of stroke, except subarachnoid hemorrhage, the incidence increased markedly with age. The age-specific stroke incidence rates found in the present investigation are much lower than those demonstrated by Aho in a community-based study in Finland.

CD009372,0,11064872,0,[A case of delayed subrachnoid hemorrhage from vertebrobasilar artery dissecting aneurysm].,"We report a case of delayed subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) from a vertebrobasilar artery dissecting aneurysm (VBA-DA). The patient was a healthy 32-year-old woman with a sudden onset of severe occipitalgia. Next day, her headache improved gradually, and she consulted with our department. Although we initially suspected that she was suffering from SAH, neurological findings, CT, and cerebrospinal fluid examination did not reveal any abnormal conditions, including SAH. Therefore, she was treated conservatively with analgesics. Twelve days after the initial onset of the headache, she was admitted because of severe re-attack of headache, rt. hemiparesis with rt. oculomotor nerve palsy and loss of consciousness. CT revealed moderate SAH and cerebral angiograms showed VBA-DA. After the cerebral angiography, bleeding reoccurred two times and she lost her life. We present the case, review the literature and discuss the relationship between presenting symptom of headache and non-hemorrhagic VBA-DA. A few cases of non-hemorrhagic VBA-DA have been reported in the literature in which the only presenting symptom was headache, followed by delayed SAH from non-hemorrhagic dissecting aneurysm. Consequently, we concluded that her initial symptom of headache was due to dissection of vertebrobasilar artery, and that SAH was due to delayed hemorrhage of non-hemorrhagic VBA-DA. Even when neurological findings, CT and cerebrospinal fluid examination reveal no abnormalities in the early stage after the sudden onset of headache, especially in the occiptal or nuchal regions, non-hemorrhagic VBA-DA, which has a risk of fatal hemorrhage, cannot be ruled out with certainty. Therefore, MRI, MRA, three-dimensional CT, or cerebral angiography should be performed in such cases."

As outlined in this article, it has taken the efforts of several early pioneers to lay the ground work for interventional neurology, a specialty that has become one of the fastest growing neurological subspecialties. The ground work, along with a great clinical need, has allowed the modern interventional neurologist to tackle some of the most intractable diseases, especially those affecting the cerebral vasculature. The institutionalization of interventional neurology as a subspecialty was first advocated in 1995 in an article entitled, ""Interventional Neurology, a subspecialty whose time has come."" The institutions created in the wake of this article have provided the framework that has allowed interventional neurology to transition from ""a subspecialty whose time has come"" to a subspecialty that is here to stay and thrive."

Digital angiography has a lower resolution ability than conventional angiography but is less invasive and may be presently a good screening or control technique.
CD009372,0,1999776,0,High risk of recurrent stroke after discontinuance of five to twelve years of transfusion therapy in patients with sickle cell disease.,"Although long-term transfusion therapy is at least 90% effective in preventing recurrent strokes after an initial cerebrovascular accident in patients with sickle cell disease, it is unknown how long transfusion therapy should be continued. To address this question, we prospectively discontinued transfusions in 10 patients with sickle cell disease whose median duration of transfusion therapy after an initial stroke was 9 1/2 years (range 5 to 12 years). Before the transfusions were discontinued, patients were examined by cerebral angiography, magnetic resonance imaging of the head, neuropsychologic testing, electroencephalography, and a complete neurologic examination. Within 12 months after transfusion therapy was stopped, 5 of 10 patients had had an ischemic event. Three events caused relatively mild deficits in the same areas as those originally affected. Two were associated with massive intracranial hemorrhage, including one on the contralateral side of original involvement. An additional patient died suddenly of unknown causes. Of the four remaining patients, three declined to resume transfusion and are relatively well at greater than or equal to 18 months after therapy was stopped. The studies performed before transfusions were stopped were not predictive of recurrent stroke. The risk of recurrent cerebrovascular accident in this group was significantly greater than the estimated risk of 10% in patients who are receiving long-term transfusion therapy (p = 0.002). This adverse outcome suggests that patients with sickle cell disease who have had a stroke must receive long-term transfusion indefinitely or a suitable therapeutic alternative must be devised."
CD009372,0,14669530,0,Thrombosis and recanalization of symptomatic nongiant saccular aneurysm.,Complete thrombosis followed by recanalization of giant aneurysms is an infrequent process that has been exceptionally mentioned in relation to nongiant saccular aneurysms. A 25-year-old male presented with a right temporal hematoma and associated subarachnoid hemorrhage. Cerebral angiography revealed a small blister-like dilatation at the right middle cerebral artery bifurcation. The cerebral hematoma was surgically removed and a large thrombosed aneurysm was discovered and was wrapped. Follow-up angiography revealed complete recanalization of the aneurysm with preservation of all the arterial branches and the aneurysm was then completely occluded with detachable coils. This case provides insight into the well-known but poorly understood dynamic process of thrombosis and recanalization of cerebral aneurysms. The possible role of a cerebral hematoma in the pathogenesis of this process is discussed.

CD009372,0,2353094,0,Cerebral blood flow: assessment with dynamic contrast-enhanced T2*-weighted MR imaging at 1.5 T.,"The authors assessed regional cerebral blood flow dynamics with magnetic resonance (MR) imaging enhanced with gadolinium diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA). After bolus administration of Gd-DTPA, rapid T2*-weighted gradient-echo images were acquired. Image acquisition time ranged from 2 to 3 seconds. The signal intensity (SI) of brain tissue and blood vessels markedly decreased during the first pass of contrast agent through the brain due to the local field inhomogeneity caused by the concentrated paramagnetic contrast agent. The method was used in 18 subjects with no cerebrovascular disease and 32 patients with stroke, vascular stenosis, arteriovenous malformation, and cerebral neoplasm. Comparison with intracranial angiography was performed in three patients and with single-photon emission computed tomography of blood flow in four. The change in T2* relaxation rate was approximately linearly related to the dose of contrast agent. The SI change increased as the echo time was lengthened. Regions in cerebral infarcts, metastases, and arteriovenous malformations showed different enhancement patterns than those of edema around a lesion and of normal brain tissue. Abnormal circulation times in patients with vascular stenoses were demonstrated. The method provides information about cerebral blood flow dynamics not available from conventional MR imaging and MR angiography."

An arterial ectasia was demonstrated on the basilar artery, arising at the origin of the left superior cerebellar artery. The left posterior cerebral artery was supplied only by the left carotid artery through a dilated posterior communicating artery. A second left vertebral angiogram was performed at D8, to make sure whether this ectasia was an aneurysm or a non aneurysmal dysplasia, but failed to provide certainty. The patient was operated upon at D17, with the diagnosis of possible aneurysm at the origin of the left superior cerebellar artery. Through a pterional route the posterior communicating artery was approached, no blood was found in the area of the upper basilar artery; there was an abnormal posterior circle of Willis, the superior cerebellar artery arising with a common trunk from the upper basilar artery; distal to this common trunk, the P1 segment was normal on the first three fourths of its course; the last fourth of the P1 segment was highly narrowed, the outer diameter of the narrowed P1 segment was approximately one third of the normal P1 segment, and was located at the junction with the complex posterior communicating artery-P2 segment.

A 69-year-old woman who had undergone artificial graft replacement for an aortic aneurysm presented with transient left hemiparesis. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a small fresh cerebral infarction in the right frontal lobe, although major cervical and cerebral arteries were shown to be intact on MR angiography. Antiplatelet and anticoagulation treatments commenced. On the 21st day after onset, the patient suffered a subarachnoid hemorrhage, and a digital subtraction angiogram revealed aneurysmal lesions in the distal MCA. Based on the histological examination of the resected aneurysms, proliferation of large B-cell lymphoma was identified in the dilated arterial lumen. On the 71st day after ischemic onset, intracranial hemorrhage recurred, and she died. Postmortem examination revealed similar lymphoma cells only in the intimal layer that had grown on the artificial graft, and it was decided that the patient had had intravascular large B-cell lymphoma. The preceding cerebral infarction was thought to be due to occlusion of the distal MCA by tumor embolus, which may be the initial pathological stage in aneurysm formation. For patients with incomprehensible ischemic cerebral stroke, neoplasm must be taken in consideration."

CD009372,0,2918970,0,Evaluation of prognostic factors in cerebral arteriovenous malformations.,"In a retrospective study of 48 patients who underwent elective surgery for cerebral arteriovenous malformations, a statistical analysis of demographic, clinical, and neuroradiological data was undertaken in order to discover the best predictors of operative morbidity. In addition, the predictive value of different clinical grading systems as applied to this series was compared. All patients had a computed tomographic scan and a positive angiogram before surgery. Complete resection was proven angiographically. The univariate Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon rank sum test, the Fisher exact test, Spearman's rank correlation coefficient analysis, and multivariate logistic regression were used as statistical methods. Duration of surgery, the development, of either new deficits or an increase in the preoperative neurological signs immediately after surgery, and rehabilitation (as measured by the Karnofsky index) were taken as target variables for the difficulty of operation and for postoperative morbidity, respectively. The largest diameter of the nidus of the arteriovenous malformation, eloquence of the adjacent brain, and deep venous drainage showed the most consistent correlation with these target variables. Intracerebral hematoma and other single factors, such as the age of the patient or localization of the arteriovenous malformation did not affect the outcome. The clinical grading scale of Spetzler and Martin provided better prediction of surgical risks than other proposed systems."

Case 1; a 68-year-old female suffered from sudden onset of severe headache and nausea. On admission, it was found she was lethargic. However, her consciousness deteriorated down to semicoma with tetraparetic condition soon after. CT revealed subarachnoid hemorrhage in the basal, quadrigeminal and supravermian cisterns and blood clots in the entire ventricle. Cerebral angiography demonstrated an aneurysm located at the distal segment of the left PICA. She was initially treated conservatively because of being in Hunt and Kosnik Grade 5, and then, 3 weeks after onset, suboccipital craniectomy was performed and the aneurysm was clipped successfully. Case 2; a 60-year-old, female, suddenly experienced severe suboccipitalgia and vomiting. CT revealed subarachnoid hemorrhage in the entire subarachnoid space and intraventricular hemorrhages in the 4th, 3rd and lateral ventricles. Subsequently cerebral angiography was performed and left VAG demonstrated an aneurysm at the left A2-A3 junction. She underwent bifrontal craniotomy and the aneurysm was clipped via the interhemispheric approach. Her postoperative course was uneventful. Postoperative left CAG showed successful clipping of the aneurysm. However, left VAG suggested an aneurysm-like shadow in the right PICA.

CD009372,0,16447742,0,[Cerebral arterial dissection].,"We investigated a total of 98 cases with stroke caused by cerebral arterial dissection recruited in Strategies against Stroke Study for Young Adults in Japan (SASSY-Japan). The most frequent site of dissection was the intracranial vertebrobasilar artery. The stroke subtype was divided into ischemic (TIA and cerebral infarction) and hemorrhagic types (subarachnoid hemorrhage). The ischemic type was predominant (69%) and patients with the ischemic type were younger than those with the hemorrhagic type (P < 0.01). In the intracranial arterial dissection, nearly all cases were of the ischemic type. In contrast, in the extracranial arterial dissection, 60% of cases were ischemic and 40% were hemorrhagic. Cerebral angiography was the most important diagnostic procedure in the hemorrhagic type. In the ischemic type, MRI and MRA were more frequently used to show the findings specific to the dissection such as an intimal flap or double lumen and intramural hematoma. The outcome at discharge is generally good such that the modified Rankin Score was among 0-II in 69% of cases. However, in the hemorrhagic type, recurrence during an acute stage was frequent, and the outcome was poor with a mortalit rate of 19%. The establishment of an effective intervention to prevent the recurrence of subarachnoid hemorrhage is urgently required."

To compare these techniques, we examined 53 patients within 6 h of a stroke, using a standardised MRI protocol including fast-FLAIR and 3D time-of-flight TOF MR to detect vessel occlusion or reduced flow corresponding to the suspected ischaemic territory. Brain infarcts were confirmed on MRI after 1-5 days in 41 cases (77%). The overall accuracy of 3D-TOF MRA was 68% and sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values were 67%, 71%, 87%, and 43% respectively. Values for the fast-FLAIR sequence were: 65%, 85%, 93% and 44%, with an overall accuracy of 70%. The fast-FLAIR sequence was thus able to show occluded vessels or reduced flow with about the same accuracy as 3D-TOF MRA and enabled better prediction of the ischaemic area."

However, some patients diagnosed as having ""SAH of unknown cause"" actually harbor undetected aneurysms. The authors report six patients with SAH who, despite multiple negative cerebral angiograms, underwent exploratory surgery due to a high clinical and radiographic suspicion for the presence of an aneurysm. Brain computerized tomography (CT) scans revealed blood located mainly in the basal frontal interhemispheric fissure in four patients, in the sylvian fissure in one patient, and in the interpeduncular cistern in one patient. The patients were evaluated as Hunt and Hess Grades I to III, and had undergone at least two high-quality cerebral angiograms that did not reveal an aneurysm. Vasospasm was visualized in two patients. Three patients rebled while in the hospital. Exploratory surgery was performed at an average of 12 days post-SAH. Five aneurysms were discovered at surgery and were successfully clipped. All four patients with interhemispheric blood were found to have an anterior communicating artery (ACoA) aneurysm. The patient with blood in the sylvian fissure was found to have a middle cerebral artery aneurysm. These aneurysms were partially thrombosed. No aneurysm was detected in the patient with interpeduncular SAH, despite extensive basilar artery exploration. Five patients had an excellent outcome and one patient developed diabetes insipidus. These results show that exploratory aneurysm surgery is warranted, despite repeated negative cerebral angiograms, if the patient manifests the classical signs of SAH with CT scans localizing blood to a specific cerebral blood vessel (particularly the ACoA) and if a second SAH is documented at the same site."

In the cerebrovascular disease group, carotid bruits alone were found in 12 patients, both carotid and ocular bruits in 7, and ocular bruits alone in 2. Carotid bruits were found only in 3 controls. We then evaluated cerebrovascular disease in the 25 patients (16 men and 9 women) who had bruits. The patients ranged from 55 to 81 years in age (mean: 70.6 years). The patients with carotid bruits alone constituted the largest group, and those with ocular bruits alone were the smallest group. Carotid bruits were heard and abnormal blood flow was observed in 19/28 arteries of the 21 patients who underwent echo-flow studies. Carotid artery stenosis/occlusion was detected in 24/31 arteries (77%) in 23 patients who underwent digital subtraction angiography (DSA). Thus, the sensitivity was 0.77 and specificity of a carotid bruit 0.91, respectively. In 9/10 patients with unilateral ocular bruits, ipsilateral or contralateral carotid artery stenosis/occlusion was detected. Diminished cerebral blood flow was observed in 10/15 patients with bruits who underwent SPECT. Of these 8 had reduced cerebral blood flow ipsilaterally to the bruit. Blood flow was reduced in the carotid artery territory in all of the patients, and watershed reductions were commonest. Among the 25 patients, some showed neurological semiology of the vertebrobasilar territory in addition to that of the carotid territory.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD009372,0,2950690,0,[Combined lesions of the major arteries of the head (clinico-doppleroangiographic correlations)].,"Using Doppler ultrasonography (DUSG) under outpatient conditions multiple combined lesions of the main arteries of the head were found in 127 patients. Comparison of the above results with the findings of cerebral angiography showed a high efficiency of DUSG. In occlusion of the carotid and vertebral arteries the accuracy of the method was 99%, specificity 99%, sensitivity 100%; in stenoses of the internal carotid arteries the respective values were 88, 84, and 95%; in cases of all stenoses of the vertebral arteries they were 93, 92, and 94%. A comparative analysis of the clinical, Doppler and angiographic findings revealed that an increase in the frequency and degree of impairment of the main arteries of the head correlated with an elevated rate of cerebral circulation disorders in several vascular beds."
CD009372,0,3895593,0,Comparison of ultrasound and IV-DSA for carotid evaluation.,"Sixty carotid bifurcations in 34 symptomatic patients were examined prospectively with ultrasound (continuous wave Doppler and high resolution, B-mode imaging) and intravenous digital subtraction angiography (IV-DSA). The overall quality of examination was better with DSA than with ultrasound. Imaging of the external carotid artery was particularly difficult with sonography. For evaluation of the common and internal carotid arteries, eight percent of IV-DSA studies were poor or inadequate as compared with 12% for B-mode imaging. Overall for detection of atherosclerotic plaque, high resolution B-mode sonography was 84% sensitive and DSA 81% sensitive. When only the common and internal carotid arteries were considered, the sensitivity of high resolution sonography improved to 93% and the sensitivity of IV-DSA increased to 86%. Ultrasound (combined high resolution, B-mode sonography and CW Doppler) correctly identified all six internal carotid occlusions in the series. While IV-DSA correctly identified five of the six occlusions, the sensitivity for detection of lesions causing 70% or more stenosis was 95% for both ultrasound and IV-DSA. Sensitivity for 50% or greater obstruction was 79% for ultrasound and 85% for IV-DSA. Ultrasound sensitivity for greater than 50.9% stenoses rose to 87% when only the common and internal carotid were considered while IV-DSA sensitivity remained at 85%. Specificity was good at all levels of obstruction. It may be concluded from this study that the accuracy of ultrasound and IV-DSA are quite similar for evaluation of the carotid bifurcation and that either test is a satisfactory screening method for carotid bifurcation atheromatous disease."

These patients underwent a protocol of T1 and T2 weighted sequences, diffusion weighted sequences and MR - angiography within 6 hours after onset of acute hemiparesis. The signal behaviour of ICH in any stage after bleeding was additionally reviewed in a retrospective series of 63 patients, who were submitted for MRI over a 12 months period because of known ICH.MRI correctly identified 4 hyperacute ICH in the prospective group and 4 hyperacute ICH in the retrospective group. These ICHs had high signal on T2 weighted images, were isointense in T1 weighted images and had signal voids on the diffusion weighted sequences. The signal intensities of acute, subacute and chronic ICHs correlated to previous experiences as reported in the literature.In conclusion, MRI reliably identified all hematomas even in the hyperacute stage. Diffusion weighted images were most sensitive to the presence of deoxyhemoglobine and helpful for the differentiation and characterization of acute ischemia. Therefore, MRI at 1.5 T can be employed as an alternative to CT for the emergency diagnosis of acute stroke."
CD009372,0,7222156,0,Limitations of quantitative oculoplethysmography and of directional Doppler ultrasonography in cerebrovascular diagnosis: assessment of an air-filled OPG system.,"500 consecutive patients were evaluated for extracranial disease of the internal carotid arteries by an automated, air-filled, digital oculoplethysmographic system (OPG) of the Kartchner type (Zira) and by supraorbital (SO) and supratrochlear (ST) directional Doppler ultrasonography. Cerebral arteriograms were performed in 58 patients (110 vessels), and OPG timing criteria for detecting hemodynamically significant carotid artery stenosis (60% or greater diameter reduction) were ascertained. Optimal criteria were a delay of one ocular pulse, relative to the other, of greater than 12 msec; and a delay of an ocular pulse, relative to the earlier ear (external carotid) pulse, of greater than 36 msec. These criteria correctly identified 73% of vessels with 0 to 59% stenosis and 76% of vessels with 60 to 100% stenosis. However, in 26% of the vessels, OPG was either inconclusive or inaccurate. Correct diagnosis of bilateral hemodynamically significant carotid artery stenoses was made by OPG in 6 of 9 affected patients. SO Doppler was normal in 70% of vessels with 0-59% stenosis, and abnormal in 75% of vessels with 60-100% stenosis. Corresponding percentages for ST Doppler were 95% and 44%. Abnormal Doppler responses to compression of contralateral facial branches were predictive of intracranial cross-collateralization in only 25% of patients. These results suggest that both quantitative OPG in its present form and directional Doppler studies have serious limitations as non-invasive diagnostic methods."
CD009372,0,6881442,0,A comparison of digital subtraction angiography and noninvasive testing in the diagnosis of cerebrovascular disease.,"Among the 1,892 patients who underwent cerebrovascular digital subtraction angiography at our hospital over the past 18 months, there was a subgroup of 34 patients (65 carotid arteries) for whom noninvasive cerebrovascular test results and standard cerebral arteriograms were also available. These patients were reviewed retrospectively and the ability of both methods to detect hemodynamically significant lesions, defined as a greater than 50 percent reduction in the diameter of the carotid artery, was determined using the arteriograms as the ""gold standard."" Noninvasive cerebrovascular tests had a sensitivity of 81 percent, a specificity of 95 percent, a positive predictive value of 92 percent, a negative prediction value of 88 percent, and an overall accuracy of 89 percent. Digital subtraction angiography had a sensitivity of 84 percent, a specificity of 92 percent, a positive predictive value of 88 percent, a negative predictive value of 89 percent, and an overall accuracy of 89 percent. If the four cases of hemodynamically significant stenosis of the carotid siphon not detected by digital subtraction angiography had been considered as false-negatives, its sensitivity would have been reduced to 72 percent. In patients with hemispheric cerebral ischemia, we found noninvasive cerebrovascular tests neither necessary nor cost-effective. Digital subtraction angiography, on the other hand, often provided definitive diagnostic information in such patients if the intracranial circulation was well defined and the extracranial lesion corresponded to the patients' symptoms. Noninvasive cerebrovascular testing was the safest and most cost-effective technique for screening patients with asymptomatic bruits, atypical, nonhemispheric cerebral symptoms, and those who have undergone carotid endarterectomy. If the noninvasive cerebrovascular test result was positive or equivocal, digital subtraction angiography was performed to localize the responsible lesion and exclude carotid occlusion."

CD009372,0,10377827,0,[Neuroimaging in patients with CVD].,"The development of the neuroimaging technique has revolutionized clinical neurology. This is also true in the field of stroke. Because of the easy accessibility and little time consuming, the computed tomography (CT) should be applied first to the stroke patient and other examinations should be prepared later to the patient due to the severity and the characteristic of the lesion. These are magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (including MR angiography. MR spectroscopy, diffusion MRI), cerebral angiography, neurosonography (carotid ultrasound, color flow imaging, transcranial Doppler), single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET), etc. It is a matter of common sense that CT and MRI are now particularly important among laboratory examinations for neurological diseases and these non-invasive techniques will become more important for the elderly stroke patients. Recent study cleared the combination of 3-dimensional computed angiography and neurosonography has an informative value and this is especially important for the elderly patients who are fragile and need rapid and accurate diagnosis."
CD009372,0,8751488,0,Surgical prophylaxis of recurrent stroke in patients with patent foramen ovale: a pilot study.,"Prevention of recurrent stroke in adults with patent foramen ovale represents a therapeutic challenge. Antiplatelet or anticoagulant treatment is widely introduced, but its exact indication is not known. In this pilot study, eight men and three women with previous ischemic cerebral events underwent direct surgical closure of the patent foramen ovale. Mean age was 39.4 (from 30 to 58) years. No coexisting cause of stroke was found after extensive investigations, including blood and coagulation tests, echocardiography, 24-hour three-lead electrocardiographic monitoring, extracranial and transcranial Doppler ultrasonography, and cerebral angiography. Criteria for operation also included at least two of the following: atrial septal aneurysm, multiple cerebral infarcts, a history of multiple cerebral events, and Valsalva strain before stroke. Before operation, one patient had two shunts (1 patent foramen ovale, 1 intrapulmonary shunt). No intraoperative or postoperative complications occurred, but a few hours after operation transient arrhythmias developed in two patients without atrial fibrillation, hemodynamic instability, or embolism. During a median follow-up of 12.2 months, no patient had recurrent stroke. All patients prospectively underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging and contrast echocardiography with simultaneous transcranial Doppler ultrasonography. A residual right-to-left interatrial shunt, smaller than the preoperative one, was observed in only one patient, whereas no lesion was seen on magnetic resonance imaging. Our study suggests that surgical closure of patent foramen ovale in patients with presumed paradoxic embolism is safe, with no recurrent stroke in the first year of follow-up. Further studies are needed to evaluate the long-term prognosis of patients with versus without operation and to define the role of operation as an alternative to prolonged antithrombotic treatment."
CD009372,0,8361576,0,[Radiation-induced cerebrovasculopathy: a case report and review of the literature].,"We reported a case of a patient who suffered from a cerebrovasculopathy after irradiation therapy for astrocytoma located at the left temporal lobe. An eleven year-old boy who presented himself with headache and vomiting as his chief complaints received partial removal of a tumor. Histological diagnosis of the tumor was astrocytoma (grade II). His preoperative cerebral angiograms showed mass sign solely, without stenosis or occlusion of the cerebral vessel. Postoperatively, he was treated with irradiation therapy involving the whole brain with a total of 30 Gy, and gamma knife therapy. Six months after irradiation, he started suffering from frequent cerebral ischemic attacks, but there was no regrowth of the tumor visible on CT scans. Cerebral angiograms were made again, and revealed multifocal stenoses in the bilateral internal carotid arteries, middle cerebral arteries, and the anterior cerebral artery. His symptoms did not improve after conservative treatment with steroids, calcium antagonist, or low molecular weight dextran. Although he received a superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery (STA-MCA) anastomoses bilaterally, multiple cerebral infarctions appeared. Although irradiation therapy is acceptable in patients with brain tumor, a cerebrovasculopathy after irradiation should be considered as one of the most important complications, and the risk incurred by irradiation therapy should lead to more careful consideration and caution when treating intracranial brain tumors, especially in children. From our experience, the usefulness of bypass surgery for radiation-induced cerebrovasculopathy is still controversial."

CD009372,0,18619779,0,One patent intracranial collateral predicts tolerance of flow reversal during carotid angioplasty and stenting.,Internal carotid artery (ICA) flow reversal is an effective means of cerebral protection during carotid stenting. Its main limitation is that in the absence of adequate collateral flow it may not be tolerated by the patient. The purpose of this study was to determine if preoperative identification of intracranial collaterals with computerized tomographic (CTA) or magnetic resonance (MRA) angiography can predict adequate collateral flow and neurological tolerance of ICA flow reversal for embolic protection. This was a study of patients undergoing transcervical carotid angioplasty and stenting. Neuroprotection was established by ICA flow reversal. All patients underwent preoperative cervical and cerebral noninvasive angiography with CTA or MRA and had at least one patent intracranial collateral. Mean carotid artery back pressure was measured. Neurological changes during carotid clamping and flow reversal were continuously monitored with electroencephalography (EEG). Thirty-seven patients with at least one patent intracranial collateral on brain imaging with CTA or MRA were included. Mean carotid artery back pressure was 58 mm Hg. All procedures were technically successful. No EEG changes were present with common carotid artery occlusion and ICA flow reversal. One patent intracranial collateral provides sufficient cerebral perfusion to perform carotid occlusion and flow reversal with absence of EEG changes. Continued progress in noninvasive imaging modalities is becoming increasingly helpful in our understanding of cerebral physiology and selection of patients for invasive carotid procedures.
CD009372,0,8338918,0,Value of magnetic resonance angiography for the detection of intracranial aneurysms in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease.,"The association of intracranial aneurysms with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), the 30-day mortality rate exceeding 50% for aneurysmal rupture, the effectiveness of surgical repair of unruptured aneurysms with a low surgical risk, and the development of noninvasive imaging techniques for their detection have led physicians to consider the value of screening patients with ADPKD for unruptured intracranial aneurysms. The sensitivity and specificity of high-resolution computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging for the diagnosis of small intracranial aneurysms have been disappointing. To determine the value of magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), 85 patients with ADPKD without symptoms related to an intracranial aneurysm and 2 patients with ADPKD presenting with a subarachnoid hemorrhage or a suspected aneurysmal leak were studied. MRA was performed with the Multisequence Vascular Package (GE Medical Systems) with use of three-dimensional time-of-flight and three-dimensional phase-contrast techniques, and postprocessing maximum intensity projection images were generated to eliminate the problem of overlapping vessels. Asymptomatic intracranial aneurysms were detected in 6 (22%) of 27 patients with and 3 (5%) of 56 patients without a family history of intracranial aneurysm or subarachnoid hemorrhage (P = 0.02, information missing in 2 patients) and in the 2 patients who presented with a symptomatic aneurysm. A stepwise logistic regression analysis indicated that a family history of intracranial aneurysm or subarachnoid hemorrhage was independently associated with the presence of intracranial aneurysms. All of the aneurysms were < or = 6.5 mm in diameter.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

CD009372,0,9626183,0,Magnetic resonance imaging of acute stroke.,"In the investigation of ischemic stroke, conventional structural magnetic resonance (MR) techniques (e.g., T1-weighted imaging, T2-weighted imaging, and proton density-weighted imaging) are valuable for the assessment of infarct extent and location beyond the first 12 to 24 hours after onset, and can be combined with MR angiography to noninvasively assess the intracranial and extracranial vasculature. However, during the critical first 6 to 12 hours, the probable period of greatest therapeutic opportunity, these methods do not adequately assess the extent and severity of ischemia. Recent developments in functional MR imaging are showing great promise for the detection of developing focal cerebral ischemic lesions within the first hours. These include (1) diffusion-weighted imaging, which provides physiologic information about the self-diffusion of water, thereby detecting one of the first elements in the pathophysiologic cascade leading to ischemic injury; and (2) perfusion imaging. The detection of acute intraparenchymal hemorrhagic stroke by susceptibility weighted MR has also been reported. In combination with MR angiography, these methods may allow the detection of the site, extent, mechanism, and tissue viability of acute stroke lesions in one imaging study. Imaging of cerebral metabolites with MR spectroscopy along with diffusion-weighted imaging and perfusion imaging may also provide new insights into ischemic stroke pathophysiology. In light of these advances in structural and functional MR, their potential uses in the study of the cerebral ischemic pathophysiology and in clinical practice are described, along with their advantages and limitations."

This 41 old, right-handed, hypertensive female suffered sudden onset of headache and right hemiparesis. Next day hematoma was evacuated by the CT-guided stereotactic aspiration because of progressive deterioration of the consciousness and patient recovered well. Fourteen days after the evacuation when she presented mild right hand weakness and motor aphasia, angiography revealed a saccular aneurysm with broad neck derived from left posterior parietal artery. A neck clipping necessitated an additional anastomosis between superficial temporal artery and distal middle cerebral artery because of parent artery stenosis. Postoperatively she is doing well with slight motor aphasia. Among the typical hypertensive putaminal hemorrhage diagnosed on CT scan, it is stressed that there may be a possibility of ruptured aneurysm situated on the peripheral middle cerebral artery."

The authors describe a patient with this type of headache who was found to have a spontaneous retroclival hematoma. A 49-year-old woman experienced an instantaneous excruciating headache. Results of computerized tomography (CT) scans of the head were normal, but on examination of the cerebrospinal fluid xanthochromia was found. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the cervical spine revealed a retroclival hematoma. Three cerebral angiographic studies did not reveal the source of the hemorrhage and a repeated MR image demonstrated resolution of the hematoma. The patient made an uneventful recovery. Spontaneous retroclival hematoma is an exceedingly rare type of intracranial hemorrhage and may be associated with normal findings on CT scans.

Eighteen patients with a low likelihood of cerebrovascular disease (control group) and 40 patients with suspected cerebrovascular disease were imaged with a FISP (fast imaging with steady precession) sequence (repetition time of 50 msec, echo time of 15 msec, velocity compensation in the read and section-select directions with acceleration compensation in the read direction, 15 degrees anisotropic volume, and a 1.25-mm partition thickness). Ninety-four percent of images in the control group and 72% of images in the group with cerebrovascular disease were considered useful for diagnosis. This technique can provide accurate images of intracranial circulation and can be performed in conjunction with two-dimensional spin-echo or gradient-echo imaging. It was most useful in the evaluation of patent intracranial aneurysms, vessel displacement, and large-vessel occlusive disease. Disadvantages included limited field of view, persistent signal voids, limited spatial resolution, and inadequate depiction of lesions with slow flow."
CD009372,0,15580489,0,MR angiography of the intracranial vessels: technical aspects and clinical applications.,"Evaluation of the intracranial circulation provides valuable information in the diagnosis and prognosis of various intracranial abnormalities and may influence patient management. Technical advances in magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) have improved the accuracy of this technique in various clinical situations, such as aneurysms, arterial and venous steno-occlusive diseases, vascular malformations, inflammatory arterial diseases, preoperative assessment of the patency of dural sinuses, and congenital vascular abnormalities. In many centers, MRA has replaced conventional digital subtraction angiography in screening for intracranial vascular disease, because of its non-invasive and non-ionizing character. Several MRA techniques have been developed for the imaging of the intracranial vascular system, such as time-of-flight MRA (TOF MRA), phase-contrast MRA (PC MRA), and more recently contrast-enhanced MRA (CE MRA). In the evaluation of steno-occlusive disease, the three-dimensional (3D) TOF-MRA technique is recommended for arterial evaluation, and the 2D TOF or 2D PC-MRA technique for venous evaluation. For the evaluation of aneurysms and arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), we recommend the 3D CE-MRA technique, especially dynamic sequences in case of AVM. In this review, the technical aspects, limitations, and optimization of these MRA techniques will be discussed together with their indications in intracranial disease."

CD009372,0,11142626,0,Computed tomographic angiography and computed tomographic perfusion imaging of hyperacute stroke.,"The roles of noncontrast computed tomography (NCCT) and CT angiographic/CT perfusion (CTA/CTP) imaging in the rapid triage of clinically suspected hyperacute stroke patients to appropriate therapy is reviewed. Contraindications to thrombolysis include NCCT hemorrhage (absolute) and significant parenchymal hypodensity (relative). The sensitivity of NCCT for early (<6 h) stroke detection, higher than that of conventional magnetic resonance imaging, is improved further by using nonstandard window and level review settings. CTA/CTP is fast and convenient, adding approximately 10 min to the NCCT examination. CTA/CTP's accuracy in diagnosing ischemia and localizing thrombus to proximal or distal intracranial vessels far exceeds that of clinical examination (including National Institutes of Health stroke scale use), facilitating triage of appropriate candidates to intra-arterial thrombolysis. The size of the ischemic CTP hypodensity (proportional to reduced cerebral blood volume) predicts final infarct volume and clinical outcome; its location can guide the decision to perform intra-arterial thrombolysis, intravenous thrombolysis, or other treatment."
CD009372,0,8657884,0,[Magnetic resonance angiography of intracranial aneurysms after subarachnoid hemorrhage].,"Magnetic resonance angiography is now commercially available for a variety of scanners and is being increasingly applied in the diagnosis of cerebrovascular disorders. Considering the clinical consequences, especially in intracranial aneurysms, studies to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the method are essential. Here we report our experience with a 3D-FISH time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography protocol in 52 patients who have suffered an acute subarachnoid hemorrhage. In 26 of the 52 patients, conventional angiography identified 31 aneurysms (3-20 mm) that were confirmed during surgery or autopsy. Magnetic resonance angiography correctly identified 28 of the 31 aneurysms (sensitivity 90.3%) and missed one ruptured (3 mm) and two incidental aneurysms (3 mm) in patients with multiple aneurysms. The sensitivity for a ruptured aneurysm was 96%. The 26 patients who suffered subarachnoid hemorrhage without evidence of an intracranial aneurysm on repeated angiography served as a control group. Magnetic resonance angiography revealed no false-positive findings, resulting in a specificity of 100%. In correlation with the literature, we conclude that magnetic resonance angiography is not sensitive enough for the management of acute subarachnoid hemorrhage. However, the method provides important complementary information for definition of the bleeding site in patients with multiple aneurysms. In addition, the calculation of projections not possible with conventional angiography can aid surgical planning. Since only very small aneurysms were missed by magnetic resonance angiography, the sensitivity seems appropriate to screen asymptomatic patients who are at risk for intracranial aneurysms."

A 33-year-old man suddenly lost consciousness and vomited frequently. Three hours later, he was admitted to our hospital in semicomatose state with left hemiplegia. Within two hours after admission, plain CT scan, enhanced CT scan, left carotid angiography and post-angiographic CT scan were performed. CT scan showed marked subarachnoid hemorrhage, left temporal intracerebral hematoma and oval mass which was remarkably enhanced in the left Sylvian fissure. First left carotid angiogram demonstrated a giant aneurysm of the middle cerebral artery which was measured 4.5 cm in maximum diameter. Second left carotid angiogram demonstrated an extravasation of contrast medium around the aneurysm. The patient immediately underwent CT scan, which showed enlargement of intracerebral hematoma and intraventricular high density area as added lesion. By regulation of window level, the presence of contrast medium due to intra-angiographic rupture of the aneurysm was confirmed. The patient expired fifteen hours after admission. At autopsy, the thrombus in the aneurysmal sac was hardly present and the wall of the sac was made mainly of collagen fibers. From the following two points this case was very interesting. However this aneurysm was very large, the thrombus in the aneurysmal sac was hardly present. Extravasation of contrast medium was clearly demonstrated during cerebral angiography with confirmation by computed tomography in the giant aneurysm."
CD009372,0,11176220,0,Imaging in cerebrovascular disease.,"Various functional imaging modalities can be applied in acute ischaemic stroke to identify functionally impaired, but morphologically preserved tissue (i.e. the penumbra), and to distinguish it from irreversibly damaged tissue. Flow thresholds for irreversible tissue destruction resulting in functional impairment, as determined by positron emission tomography, perfusion and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, single-photon computed tomography and xenon computed tomography, were comparable and ranged between 5 and 12 ml/100 g per min for the lower and 14 and 22 ml/100 g per min for the upper limit of penumbra. These imaging modalities help to select patients for thrombolytic therapy and provide evidence for the effect of this treatment on critically perfused tissue. They can also serve as surrogate markers in the evaluation of therapeutic efficacy. Further progress in interventional neuroradiology has been achieved with intra-arterial thrombolysis, which has become a treatment option beyond the 3-h therapeutic window in acute ischaemic stroke. Angioplasty and stenting of stenosis of arteries that supply the brain with blood have reached a point in their development at which a randomized trial to compare these treatments with vascular surgery is warranted."

In connection with this, an interesting angiographic finding was reported. A 65-year-old man suffered from sudden disturbance of consciousness and left hemiparesis. Computed tomography (CT) scan revealed typical subarachnoid hemorrhage localized in the right Sylvian fissure. Next day, a cerebral angiography was performed, but no aneurysm was detected. A second angiography was performed 21 days after the onset, and it revealed a saccular right internal carotid-posterior communicating artery (IC-PC) aneurysm. An operation for the IC-PC aneurysm was performed by conventional pterional approach. However, intraoperative findings were unexpected. The collapsed ruptured true IC-PC aneurysm was found at the orifice of the larger bleb, and the ruptured point was in the neck of the true aneurysm. Clipping of the aneurysm was performed successfully. The patient was discharged on foot. The aneurysm detected by the second angiography was not a true one but a bleb formation. Continuous hemodynamic stress on the rupture point may induce the formation of such an aneurysm-like bleb. It should be kept in mind that an aneurysm found in the chronic period might be an aneurysm-like bleb."

A brain CT scan revealed a small cerebellar haemorrhage located in the right vermis. Brain MR angiography revealed left persistent primitive trigeminal artery (PPTA) and basilar artery (BA) dysplasia proximal to the shunting PPTA without arteriovenous malformation (AVM) or aneurysm. We speculate that BA dysplasia due to the PPTA, along with poorly controlled hypertension resulted in overload of the superior cerebellar artery blood vessels through the PPTA, leading to a haemorrhage in the right vermis. BA dysplasia and a PPTA without an obvious AVM or aneurysm possibly leading to cerebellar haemorrhage is rare. PPTA is a relatively common vascular anomaly; hence, we must consider it in the differential diagnosis for brain haemorrhages that may be caused by the specific haemodynamic consequences of PPTA."
CD009372,0,7034508,0,Digital subtraction angiography of the intracranial vascular system: comparative study in 55 patients.,"Intracranial vessels were examined in 55 patients with both conventional selective catheterization and intravenous digital subtraction angiography using a prototype digital subtraction unit. In 65% of the patients, the digital subtraction angiogram was diagnostic, but the overall quality was inferior to conventional selective angiography. In 22%, the digital subtraction angiogram provided diagnostic information, but there was a significant chance of misinterpreting the results of the study. In 13% of cases, the subtraction angiogram was not diagnostic. As now developed, digital subtraction angiography can replace conventional cerebral angiography for preoperative evaluation of the juxtasellar carotid artery prior to transphenoidal surgery because the large intracerebral vessels are consistently well visualized with digital subtraction. The dural sinuses are better visualized with digital subtraction than with conventional angiography because with digital subtraction all the vessels of the brain are opacified, whereas with conventional angiography, there is a mixture of opacified and unopacified blood in the sinuses. Combined with computed tomography, digital subtraction angiography can replace conventional angiography for determining the preoperative extent and vascularity of tumors. It can be used for postoperative evaluation of aneurysms, arteriovenous malformations, extracranial to intracranial bypasses, and after the embolization of vascular lesions."

Cerebral angiograms revealed narrowed cortical vein with irregular wall in the right parietal region, where delayed local blood flow into the deep cerebral veins through collateral vessels was noted. The diagnosis was subcortical hemorrhage due to thrombosis of cortical vein. Her symptoms and brain edema were progressive. To reduce intracranial pressure, evacuation of the hematoma was performed. The hematoma which existed 1cm under the right parietal cortex was about 20g in weight. She remarkably improved soon after operation. Frequency of sinovenous thrombosis has been reported to be about 10% of all cerebral ischemic diseases, however, localized venous thrombosis is rare among them.

Nine years after irradiation, the patient was referred to our center with a sudden onset of severe headache, vomiting and neck stiffness. Computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and cerebral angiography demonstrated an intratumoral, intraventricular, and subarachnoidal hemorrhage from an anterior communicating artery aneurysm encased in the pilocytic astrocytoma. The aneurysm was clipped and the patient recovered nicely from the hemorrhage. Three years later, the patient suddenly died of cardiac failure. Autopsy disclosed vessel wall changes compatible with radiation-induced vasculopathy. In light of this finding, the importance of radiation therapy and intracranial neoplasms for aneurysm formation is discussed."

Conservative treatment and was used and she was discharged 10 days later. However, follow-up CT demonstrated a parenchymal hematoma in the right posterior temporal lobe. Cerebral angiography demonstrated a large right posterior cerebral aneurysm and multiple right middle cerebral aneurysms. A cardiac ultrasonography showed a verruca at the mitral valve. The posterior cerebral aneurysms increased in size and one new middle cerebral aneurysm appeared at follow-up angiography one week later. Endovascular treatment with coils was applied for the right posterior cerebral aneurysm, and others were treated with antibiotic therapy under serial observation, using MR angiography. She was discharged without any symptoms two months after embolization. Follow-up angiography at one year after embolization showed disappearance of the aneurysms.

The distribution of cisternal blood can be identified which, in combination with the localization of a possible intracerebral hematoma, yields a rather good predictability as to the site of the ruptured aneurysm. The subsequent angiography can thus be directed to the relevant vessel in most cases.

Contribution of computerized tomography].,"Thirty-two traumatic subdural haematomas were operated between 1984 and 1990. In 16 cases (50%), we encountered, after removal of the heamorrhage, a bleeding from a cortical artery at the lateral sulcus (middle cerebral artery). Four mechanisms of arterial bleeding have been reported: a) rupture of a cortico-dural bridging artery, b) ""fire-hose"" rupture, c) rupture at the level of an arachnoid attachment and d) rupture at the level of a dural adhesion. The characteristic finding of such haematomas on computerized tomography (CT-scan) was an indentation towards the lateral sulcus. This was called the ""double brackets sign"". In seventy-nine percent of subdural haematomas of arterial origin, the ""double brackets sign"" was demonstrated on CT-scan on at least two slices (9 mm). In 9% of subdural haematomas of non-arterial origin, this sign was absent or present in only one CT image. The characteristic ""double brackets sign"", when present on 3 or 4 CT-scan images, seems to have a very high specificity for an arterial origin of the haematoma."

Four patients presented with intracerebral haematoma and 3 patients had associated cavernous angioma, respectively. Patients with intracerebral haematoma had signs and symptoms due to the localization of the haematoma. The other patients presented with headache, seizures, vertigo, ataxia and mental disturbances. Pre-operative diagnosis was based on computerized tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and cerebral angiography. In 9 surgical cases it was confirmed by histopathological examination of operative specimens. After establishing the type, size and location of the lesion decision for operative treatment was made in nine cases, in four of them because of the presence of an intracerebral haematoma and in 5 of them due to severe disability. Eight of these 9 patients recovered completely and one improved. No severe cerebral oedema was encountered after converging medullary veins were excised and main draining veins partially coagulated. In this small series we encountered an unexpectedly large percentage of venous angiomas causing intracerebral haemorrhage which are commonly considered more benign than other vascular malformations. After reviewing previously reported cases of venous angiomas causing intracerebral haemorrhage and severe neurological deficit we think that the term ""benign"" is worth reconsidering. We propose a thorough examination of each case of venous angioma and the operative treatment when appropriate taking into account patients state and location of angioma."

Ten children with sickle cell hemoglobinopathy and a history of acute neurologic syndromes were studied with combined parenchymal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and MRA. Six had abnormal MRI findings and MRA-defined luminal lesions in the vascular distribution of these parenchymal infarctions.

We conclude that a combination of MRI and MRA provides a noninvasive screening test for large-vessel disease in this population.
CD009372,0,8677008,0,[Bilateral chronic subdural hematomas presented with subarachnoid hemorrhage: report of two cases].,"Computed tomography (CT) findings of chronic subdural hematomas are usually diagnostic, unless hematomas are isodense and bilateral. The authors report two cases of bilateral chronic subdural hematomas, in which CT scans on admission were both misdiagnosed as delayed subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The first case was a 43-year-old woman who suffered from a sudden onset of headache and nausea. She had no past history of head injury. CT scans on admission did not clearly reveal the Sylvian fissures and the mesencephalic cistern, without any mass effects. A lumbar puncture demonstrated xanthochromic cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which was considered to be responsible for her headache. Cerebral angiography performed on day 4 failed to demonstrate any cerebral vascular disorders. Follow-up CT scans on day 7 demonstrated a high density lesion in the left subdural space. Magnetic resonance images (MRIs) confirmed a diagnosis of bilateral chronic subdural hematomas. Removal of the hematomas cleared all signs and symptoms smoothly. The second case was a 44-year-old man who was referred from another hospital because of xanthochromic CSF found by lumbar puncture. He began to suffer headache and be subject to vomiting 6 weeks earlier and these symptoms were still present on the day of admission. CT scans did not clearly show the cerebral cisterns without mass effects. Because the second lumbar puncture showed xanthochromic CSF again, SAH from aneurysm was suspected. However, emergency cerebral angiography failed to demonstrate cerebral aneurysms. MRI performed two days later demonstrated bilateral chronic subdural hematomas. Following surgery, the patient improved immediately and was discharged from hospital without any complications. In both cases, a retrospective study of the angiograms revealed the evidence of bilateral avascular areas over the convexities in the venous phase. The reason why these subdural hematomas were missed at the time of angiography was due to too much attention being paid to the arterial phase in an effort aimed only at identifying cerebral aneurysms. There are no reports of chronic subdural hematoma which demonstrated sudden onset of headache associated with xanthochromic CSF."
CD009372,0,3131146,0,Clinical criteria for the diagnosis of vascular dementia.,"The clinical diagnosis of dementia includes medical history, neurological examination, psychiatric interview and dementia scale. The identification of conditions producing dementia can only be achieved by adding to the clinical information the data gathered from ancillary investigations. The usual ancillary diagnostic investigations (biochemical tests, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), EEG, CT, MRI, angiography) can rather easily identify brain disorders due to tumors, vascular malformations, hematomas, infections, toxins and drugs, deficiency diseases, normal-pressure hydrocephalus, metabolic and endocrine derangements. The differential diagnosis between degenerative and vascular dementia needs laboratory tests such as CSF, EEG, Somatosensory Evoked Potentials, CT (which constitutes a major role in a modified ischemic score) and MRI. The three final diagnostic labels are possible, probable and definite vascular dementia, which include clinical features and laboratory investigations concurrently confirming the diagnosis. If ancillary investigations fail to show multiple infarct lesions or if mixed forms are suspected an unequivocal diagnosis can be made only on histopathological evidence."

Left untreated fewer than 20% of patients survive to age 50. We describe a case of thoracic AC, diagnosed at age 61, in a woman with known hypertension since age 45. At age 56 the patient was admitted with a subarachnoid hemorrhage and, during cerebral angiography, a thoracic aortic aneurysm was detected. Four years later the patient was referred to the outpatient hypertension clinic due to uncontrolled hypertension and cardiac failure. The echocardiogram disclosed left ventricular hypertrophy and aggressive treatment failed to control her hypertension. At age 61, due to lower limb muscular fatigue, arterial Doppler ultrasound was performed that revealed symmetrically decreased ankle/brachial pressure index, suggesting aortic stenosis. MRI angiography enabled a diagnosis of AC with a large poststenotic dilation which had been interpreted as an aortic aneurysm in successive CT scans.
