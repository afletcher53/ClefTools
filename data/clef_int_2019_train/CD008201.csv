CD008201,0,1516307,0,Pulmonary embolism in total hip and knee arthroplasty. Risk factors in patients on warfarin prophylaxis and analysis of the prothrombin time as an indicator of warfarin's prophylactic effect.,"This study was designed to identify those total arthroplasty patients at high risk for embolism even while on a proven warfarin prophylactic regimen and to identify the measure of anticoagulation that would be most efficacious in the prevention of pulmonary embolism (PE). A series of 2348 total arthroplasty patients had a preoperative perfusion scan and a postoperative ventilation/perfusion scan. All patients were placed on a low-dose warfarin protocol. Eighty-one patients were identified as having a PE by pulmonary arteriography (incidence of 3.4%). Of these, 89% were asymptomatic and no case was fatal. A control group of 159 patients without PE was used for comparison. Patients older than 65 years of age with a history of genitourinary infection were identified as being at higher risk of PE while on a proven warfarin prophylactic program. These patients may need additional prophylactic measures to reduce the risk of PE. In contrast, patients with a history of phlebitis, PE, obesity, or varicosities were not at excess risk for PE while on warfarin prophylaxis; therefore, no additional prophylactic measures are required. All prothrombin time profiles were within the prophylactic range. Therefore, the actual prothrombin time may not be the critical determinant of the level of anticoagulation or prophylaxis achieved."

CD008201,0,23622906,0,Rationale and design of the LEADERS FREE trial: A randomized double-blind comparison of the BioFreedom drug-coated stent vs the Gazelle bare metal stent in patients at high bleeding risk using a short (1 month) course of dual antiplatelet therapy.,"Major bleeding is a powerful predictor of morbidity and mortality after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). To avoid prolonged dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), current guidelines recommend using a bare metal stent when PCI is indicated to treat patients at high risk of bleeding. The Biolimus A9-coated BioFreedom is a new stainless steel drug-coated stent devoid of polymer and has been shown to be associated with a low median late-loss of 0.17 mm at 12 months of follow-up. In an animal model, 98% of the drug has diffused into the vessel wall at 1 month. It is therefore reasonable to consider that such a device may have a potential safety advantage, and a lesser dependence on prolonged DAPT than a polymer-coated drug-eluting stent."
CD008201,0,23073856,0,Do medical patients need to receive pharmacologic prophylaxis for the prevention of venous thromboembolism?,"Acutely ill medical patients with reduced mobility are at increased risk of venous thromboembolism, which can occur during hospitalization or after discharge. A number of clinical trials and meta-analyses have shown that pharmacologic prophylaxis with anticoagulant drugs in these patients significantly reduces the risk of fatal pulmonary embolism as compared to placebo or no treatment, without significant increase in the risk of major bleeding. Thus, the use of anticoagulant prophylaxis is recommended for all high risk medical patients during hospitalization. To identify these high risk patients, clinicians may use the inclusion criteria applied in the trials, with a selection that is mostly qualitative, or risk assessment models, with a selection that is both qualitative and quantitative. With both approaches, about 40 % of medical patients would be at increased risk of venous thrombosis. Because in the real world medical patients tend to be much older and with more comorbidities than in clinical trials, patient selection needs to also take into account risk factors for bleeding. Among others, estimation of creatinine clearance appears to be particularly important to prevent excessive exposure to anticoagulant drugs. Finally, although the risk of venous thrombosis may persist in some patients after hospital discharge, clinical trials assessing extended prophylaxis in this setting have failed to show a convincing clinical benefit with this approach."
CD008201,0,14691412,0,Periprocedural thromboprophylaxis in patients receiving chronic anticoagulation therapy.,"Patients receiving chronic anticoagulation therapy pose a clinical challenge when therapy needs to be interrupted for surgical or invasive procedures. Maintaining anticoagulation places them at risk for serious bleeding complications, whereas discontinuing anticoagulation puts them at risk of thromboembolic complications. Most patients can undergo dental procedures, cataract surgery, and diagnostic endoscopy without discontinuing anticoagulation. The main patient groups that may require a periprocedural alternative to oral anticoagulation (periprocedural thromboprophylaxis or bridging) include patients with prosthetic heart valves, atrial fibrillation, and hypercoagulable states and patients with chronic venous thrombosis who are undergoing surgery. Currently, there is little consensus on the appropriate perioperative treatment of patients on long-term warfarin therapy. There are an increasing number of studies that evaluate the benefits of periprocedural bridging with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) in place of unfractionated heparin (UFH). An advantage of LMWH over UFH is that perioperative conversion from warfarin therapy with LMWH can be carried out in the outpatient setting, which is more convenient for patients and is cost effective. As with the use of UFH, there are reports of maternal thromboembolic complications with LMWHs in pregnant women with mechanical heart valves. This review brings together the available data on periprocedural bridging to assess the available options for patients on long-term warfarin therapy who are undergoing surgical procedures. It provides a rationale for using LMWHs while individualizing the risks versus benefits in a given patient population."
CD008201,0,10356603,0,Oral anticoagulation in venous thromboembolism: decisions based on more than mere feelings.,"Although there is a very limited scientific basis for the recommendation to target the intensity of oral anticoagulation after venous thromboembolism at an international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.0-3.0, this has been widely adopted. It seems possible from the DURAC I and II trials that a slight lowering of the upper limit could further reduce the risk of major haemorrhage. The optimal duration of anticoagulation in this group of patients has been extensively investigated. For the majority of patients a treatment duration of 6 months eliminates the high risk of relatively early recurrences without yielding an increase in the incidence of major haemorrhages. Patients with a distal deep vein thrombosis and a temporary risk factor or those with poor compliance should have a shorter treatment duration, whereas further prolongation is warranted in patients with certain biochemical abnormalities or recurrent thromboembolic episodes. The optimal treatment regimen is individualized, taking into account a variety of risk factors, and re-evaluated regularly in case of prolonged therapy."

CD008201,0,22409858,0,Variation in thromboembolic complications among patients undergoing commonly performed cancer operations.,There is widespread evidence that cancer confers an increased risk of deep venous thrombosis (DVT).

In addition, anticoagulation is used in the prevention of venous thromboembolic events. We assess the balance between preventing symptomatic pulmonary embolism (sPE) and causing symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH) in patients with recent stroke who were randomized to low-dose subcutaneous anticoagulation in trials."
CD008201,0,18954836,0,Epidemiology of venous thromboembolism in cardiorespiratory and infectious disease.,"Venous thromboembolic complications -- deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism -- occur in a significant proportion of hospitalized medical patients. The incidence in acutely ill medical patients is 10%-40%, equivalent to that seen in general surgical patients. Prophylaxis is effective and well tolerated, yet remains under-prescribed in medical wards. Current recommendations for prophylaxis are generalized and do not specifically address many patient groups. Data on the prevalence in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart failure, and infectious diseases are limited. However, studies on large numbers of hospitalized patients with these admission diagnoses have provided important information on incidence, and the efficacy of thromboprophylaxis. This review summarizes current knowledge of the epidemiology of venous thromboembolism in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart failure, and infectious diseases, and highlights the benefits of, and needs for, appropriate prophylaxis in these groups. Increased awareness of the prevalence of thrombosis in the major subgroups of medical inpatients should improve the prescribing of prophylaxis and prevent potentially avoidable and costly complications."
CD008201,0,22385880,0,Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis of acutely ill hospitalized medical patients. Are we under-treating our patients?,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is frequent in patients hospitalized in Internal Medicine wards. It carries a considerable morbidity and mortality. Recommendations for use of anticoagulation are graded 1A in leading evidence-based consensus guidelines. Implementation of these guidelines is suboptimal. Lack of awareness seems to be an important factor for the low implementation rate of thromboprophylaxis in Internal Medicine wards, but other factors may be equally important: some clinicians find the data favoring thromboprophylaxis unconvincing or believe that pharmacological prevention is too risky for the average medical inpatient. The following review will show that although there is a dispute about the clinical importance of some manifestations of thromboembolic disease, anticoagulation significantly reduces the risk for clinically relevant VTE. The bleeding risk in most patients is low and does not outweigh the benefit of treatment. Pharmacological or mechanical thromboprophylaxis is cost-effective when administered to at-risk patients. Better awareness and judicious use of risk assessment models should help the attending physician to balance the risk of VTE against the potential bleeding risk."

CD008201,0,8512044,0,Contraception and dyslipidemia.,"The risks of cardiovascular disease associated with dyslipidemia differ in women and men, being more strongly associated with triglyceride/high-density lipoprotein in middle-aged women than in men. Although the incidence of heart disease is lower in women because they live longer, over a lifetime, cardiovascular disease in women is equal to that in men, with the greatest incidence after age 65 years. Major coronary events are rare among reproductive-age women who use oral contraceptives and are related to the concomitant effects of age, smoking, diabetes, hypertension, and obesity. Low estrogen-progestin dose oral contraceptives appear not to promote cardiovascular disease and can be used in women with controlled cholesterol elevations. Alternative contraceptive measures should be considered for patients with severe uncontrolled hypercholesterolemia or a lipid disorder that carries a high risk of coronary heart disease. In these conditions, thrombotic propensity associated with supraphysiologic doses of estrogen in oral contraceptives might accelerate coronary thrombosis should an arteriosclerotic plaque rupture. Treatment of hypercholesterolemia should follow the guidelines of the National Cholesterol Education Program and emphasize hygienic measures. Contraceptive selection in hyperlipidemic patients should reflect a balance between the risks--and their management--of developing cardiovascular disease versus the risks of pregnancy."
CD008201,0,22873346,0,Advances in monitoring of aspirin therapy.,"The efficacy of aspirin to prevent thrombotic events in cardiovascular patients is well established, with >100 randomized trials having been conducted in high-risk patients and demonstrating a reduction in vascular death of approximately 15% and a further reduction in non-fatal vascular events of approximately 30%. While the benefit of aspirin is undisputed, it is also known that aspirin is associated with a dose-dependent increase in the risk of bleeding. It follows that most treatment guidelines advocate the use of the lowest aspirin dose effective in preventing thrombotic complications to minimize the risk of major bleeding. From this, a need for monitoring of aspirin therapy has emerged and prompted the development and investigation of numerous assays of platelet function. The intention behind monitoring of aspirin's antithrombotic effects is to maximize benefit and to personalize treatment based on individual patient characteristics. This article reviews the recent literature on the usefulness of platelet function testing in patients requiring aspirin; the variability of platelet reactivity in patients taking aspirin and its clinical impact; the potential mechanisms underlying suboptimal platelet inhibition by aspirin and future directions in terms of management of aspirin therapy."

CD008201,0,19087855,0,[Future directions in prophylaxis and treatment of venous thromboembolic disease].,"Substantial changes in both the prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) can be expected in the near future. First, we should expand the prescription of thromboprophylaxis to acutely ill medical patients and improve the early detection of VTE in patients at high risk. The new antithrombotic drugs, which will shortly become available, will probably improve adherence to thromboprophylaxis. Future perspectives focus on better identification of which patients with acute pulmonary embolism may safely be treated at home, and on how to individually tailor antithrombotic therapy to VTE patients with special conditions."
CD008201,0,11684864,0,Evaluation of an optimal dose of low-molecular-weight heparin for thromboprophylaxis in pregnant women at risk of thrombosis using coagulation activation markers.,"There is no consensus on the dose of low-molecular-weight (LMW) heparin for thromboprophylaxis in pregnant women at increased risk of thrombosis. Based upon monitoring with anti-factor Xa activity, the studies showed conflicting results suggesting either fixed dosages throughout the pregnancy or dosages adapted to the gestational age. We tested whether monitoring thromboprophylaxis with D-dimers and thrombin-antithrombin complexes (TAT) would provide additional information on the optimal dose of LMW heparin. Women (165 women and 202 pregnancies) with hereditary or acquired thrombophilia or a history of thrombosis were considered to receive prophylactic LMW heparin therapy. All women received initially 5,000 IU/day of dalteparin s.c. All further dosages were determined solely on the basis of TAT and/or D-dimer values which were determined every 2-3 weeks. As soon as one of these values increased above the normal range, the dose of LMW heparin was adjusted. In 84.6% of all pregnancies, TAT and/or D-dimer values increased above the normal range once or more during the pregnancy. Consequently, the dose of LMW heparin had to be adjusted at least once over the course of the pregnancy. The mean daily dose of LMW heparin increased from 5,000 to 11,200 U between the 6th and 40th week of gestation. Adverse effects included one major bleeding and six local complications, but no thromboembolic event. In conclusion, increasing doses of LMW heparin are needed to keep TAT and D-dimers within the normal range during pregnancy. Hence, to suppress thrombin generation, apparently, the dosage of LMW heparin should be adjusted to the gestational age rather than using fixed doses throughout the pregnancy. However, it remains to be further established whether elevated TAT and D-dimers truly reflect a prothrombotic state during pregnancy."
CD008201,0,21507832,0,Anticoagulation in the management of non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome.,"There are currently over 1 million patients admitted to hospitals in the United States with the diagnosis of non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE ACS). Due to the significant morbidity and mortality associated with NSTE ACS, appropriate use of the numerous medications employed is critical in ensuring optimal outcomes. Because atherosclerotic plaque rupture and thrombus formation are the central pathophysiologic process in patients with NSTE ACS, it is important to utilize effective and safe combinations of antiplatelet and anticoagulant drug therapy. There are a number of different anticoagulant agents available for use in patients with NSTE ACS, but it is essential to have an in-depth knowledge of the setting in which these agents have been investigated, what current consensus guidelines recommend, as well as an appreciation for the treatment approach and philosophy of the institution for management of patients with NSTE ACS. In this review manuscript, the reader will find an evaluation of the current guidelines concerning the use of anticoagulant therapy in patients with NSTE ACS, as well as a detailed examination of the literature with critical analysis on issues that should be considered when deciding on the appropriate implementation of anticoagulant therapy in protocols for NSTE ACS patients."

CD008201,0,19806254,0,Long-term complications of medical patients with hospital-acquired venous thromboembolism.,"Long-term complications from hospital-acquired acute venous thromboembolism (VTE) include recurrent VTE, postthrombotic syndrome (PTS), and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH). We used a probability model to estimate the number of these events among hospitalised medical patients in the 2003 United States Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) Nationwide Inpatient Sample database. Of 8,077,919 hospitalised medical patients at risk for VTE, we calculate that 122,235 were stricken with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and 32,654 with pulmonary embolism (PE). These events generated 49,843 VTE-related deaths, 28,052 recurrent DVTs, 6,680 recurrent PEs, 140,156 cases of PTS, and 5,288 cases of CTEPH over the ensuing 5 years, for a total of 180,176 patients afflicted with long-term complications of VTE. In our model, rates of pharmacological thromboprophylaxis prescribing varied across populations, ranging from 15.3% to 49.2%. When we modeled universal utilisation of pharmacological prophylaxis, the number of VTE-related deaths decreased from 49,843 to 20,739, recurrent DVT was reduced from 28,052 to 13,384, and recurrent PE was reduced from 6,680 to 3,187 events. Incident cases of PTS decreased from 140,156 to 54,651, and CTEPH decreased from 5,288 to 1,115 cases. The number of hospitalised medical patients with long-term VTE complications was reduced by 60% to 72,337. In conclusion, hospitalised medical patients are particularly vulnerable to the development of recurrent VTE, PTS, and CTEPH. These VTE complications would be reduced by more than half with universal thromboprophylaxis. Further efforts should focus on improving VTE prophylaxis utilisation."

The major reason for failure of mechanical methods of DVT prophylaxis is ineffective usage. It has been postulated that foot pumps may have a better compliance rate than do other devices. One thousand observations were performed on trauma patients in both the intensive care unit (ICU) and on the surgical ward. Foot pumps were applied properly and functioning correctly 59% of the time. Patients in the ICU had significantly better compliance than did patients on the surgical ward. These rates are not better than published rates for other devices for DVT prophylaxis.

CD008201,0,23129036,0,Drug-eluting stents and perioperative risk - more than matters of the heart?,"The introduction of drug-eluting stents (DES) to interventional cardiology has been a breakthrough in the treatment of in-stent restenosis. However, the downside of reduced restenosis is a significantly prolonged and practically incalculable time to reendothelialization of thrombogenic stent-surfaces with an increased risk for coronary thrombosis. As the use of DES in non-coronary arteries (e.g. carotid, renal, infrainguinal and even cerebral arteries) is increasing, new vascular beds might be put at risk of ischemia. The practice of stopping antiplatelet drugs in a perioperative setting is highly problematic and contemporary guidelines released by scientific societies from different medical specialties have recently addressed this problem. While many case reports have reported alarming incidents of stent thrombosis, prospective clinical data are scarcely available to guide anticoagulation during the perioperative phase. This review summarizes information on the vascular biology of DES and associated adverse events based on a systematic search of the available literature in public data bases. An emphasis is put on the growing use of DES in non-coronary vessels and the associated danger of putting new vascular beds at risk of thrombotic complications."

CD008201,0,27312021,0,[Management of hypercholesterolemia in patients with acute coronary syndrome: current mechanisms and future perspectives].,"Acute coronary syndromes (ACS) are a major health problem both in industrialized countries and in developing ones, and a leading cause of death and disability. The pathogenesis of ACS is multifactorial and complex, with approximately 65-70% of cases caused by the abrupt occlusion of a coronary vessel. This usually occurs as a result of thrombus formation over a vulnerable, lipid-rich atherosclerotic plaque, which undergoes rupture or erosion. High levels of LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) are a well known risk factor for the development of atherosclerosis, and the reduction in plasma LDL-C is a fundamental treatment both in primary and secondary prevention. Statins are the most extensively used lipid-lowering drugs. They have been associated with reduced progression of coronary atherosclerosis and a decreased incidence of new ACS episodes or post-ACS major cardiovascular events. For ACS patients, the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) has suggested an early treatment - starting with the acute phase - together with a well defined target value of LDL-C level, which should be achieved during the follow-up. While statin therapy has significantly lowered cardiovascular risk, several cardiovascular events are still not prevented and a residual risk remains also after intensive therapy. In addition, a significant proportion of high-risk patients do not achieve the LDL-C target recommended by the ESC guidelines or present with statin intolerance, which does not allow a continuative and effective treatment. This is the main reason why innovative lipid-lowering therapies might become a new opportunity in ACS patients. The recently published results of the IMPROVE-IT trial have shown that the association statin + ezetimibe is superior to statin alone in preventing cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, rehospitalization for unstable angina, coronary revascularization and stroke in a population of medium to high-risk patients stabilized after ACS. Monoclonal antibodies targeting human PCSK9 are currently being tested on top of statins in patients with ACS, to investigate their superiority in reducing major cardiovascular adverse events as compared with statins alone at the maximally tolerated dose. The results, expected for 2017, will hopefully benefit the treatment of patients in secondary prevention and contribute to a better outcome of ACS patients worldwide."

CD008201,0,20135622,0,[Oral prevention of thromboembolism with rivaroxaban and dabigatran: are the newly approved drugs innovations in orthopaedic and trauma surgery? ].,"Today the indication for thrombosis prophylaxis is a relevant and daily concern in orthopaedic surgery. Recently there are some changes concerning the German guidelines, which are approved by 27 German medical societies. For the first time the guidelines give distinct recommendations for the different indications, the kind of thrombosis prophylaxis and its duration. Some of the recommendations will lead to changes of both processes in outpatient and inpatient management. In parallel 2 new oral anticoagulants have been approved for the prevention of thromboembolic events after elective knee and hip replacement. Dabigatran is an oral thrombin inhibitor. Compared to enoxaparin it has a comparable profile of side effects and efficacy. Rivaroxaban is an oral Xa inhibitor which shows a significantly better efficacy compared to enoxaparin and no difference in side effects. The significant reduction of symptomatic thromboembolisms after elective knee and hip replacement was shown for rivaroxaban compared to enoxaparin in a pooled analysis of phase III data. This review discusses the main topics of the new German guideline and impact of the new oral anticoagulants on in- and outpatient treatment procedures."

CD008201,0,26402815,0,Effects of Exercise and Nutrition on the Coagulation System During Bedrest Immobilization.,"Immobilization in hospitalized medical patients or during simulation of spaceflight induced deconditioning has been shown to be associated with loss of muscle mass and bone. Resistance vibrating exercise (RVE) and/or high protein diet are countermeasures, which are capable of mitigating the adverse effects of immobilization. We investigated the effect of these countermeasures on the coagulation system. Two groups of volunteers, each of whom performed such countermeasures, were enrolled in the study. Volunteers, who did nothing while bed rested, served as controls. The berest and the intervention protocols were carried out at Clinique d' Investigation, MEDES, Toulouse, France. Eleven healthy men volunteered for this randomized crossover study. The subjects underwent 21 day of 6° head down bed rest (HDBR) followed by a washout period of 4 months. The first group followed an exercise schedule using resistance-vibrating exercise (RVE group). The second group also used the RVE but complemented it with high-protein supplement diet (NeX group). The third group only did bed rest. The highly sensitive methods calibrated automated thrombography (CAT) and thrombelastometry (TEM) were applied to monitor hemostatic changes. In all 3 groups, the hemostatic system shifted toward hypocoagulability during bed rest. For example, peak and thrombin formation velocity (VELINDEX) reduced in this period. Interestingly, a tendency toward hypercoagulation was observed during re-ambulation. In all 3 groups, ttPeak and StartTail were reduced, and Peak and VELINDEX (except in the RVE group) were significantly higher in relation to baseline values. Influence of bed rest on the coagulation system in the 2 groups performing countermeasures (RVE and NeX group) was the same as in the control bed-rested group. Clotting does not seem to be worsened by prolonged immobilization, or by countermeasures such as RVE/exercise or high-protein supplementation during immobilization. Therefore, only hospitalized medical patients at an elevated risk for thrombosis should be treated with anticoagulants. However, clinicians have to be aware that the re-ambulation period following immobilization might be associated with an elevated risk of thrombotic events."

Non pharmacological methods must be reserved to patients with high hemorrhagic risk and in association to heparin to patients with particularly high thromboembolic risk. In high risk Ortopedic Surgery prophylaxis with high doses LMWH or oral anticoagulants (OA) is indicated. Il Neurosurgical Surgery and in politraumatized patients prophylaxis must be individualized taking account of hemorrhagic risk; patients with acute medullary lesion with paraplegia must be treated with LMWH. In Internal Medicine conditions which determine prolonged bed rest need prophylaxis with UFH or LMWH. In pregnancy, pharmacological prophylaxis is indicated only in cases of preceding thrombotic events or documented congenital risk factors."
CD008201,0,24226257,0,Multicentre validation of the Geneva Risk Score for hospitalised medical patients at risk of venous thromboembolism. Explicit ASsessment of Thromboembolic RIsk and Prophylaxis for Medical PATients in SwitzErland (ESTIMATE).,"There is a need to validate risk assessment tools for hospitalised medical patients at risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). We investigated whether a predefined cut-off of the Geneva Risk Score, as compared to the Padua Prediction Score, accurately distinguishes low-risk from high-risk patients regardless of the use of thromboprophylaxis. In the multicentre, prospective Explicit ASsessment of Thromboembolic RIsk and Prophylaxis for Medical PATients in SwitzErland (ESTIMATE) cohort study, 1,478 hospitalised medical patients were enrolled of whom 637 (43%) did not receive thromboprophylaxis. The primary endpoint was symptomatic VTE or VTE-related death at 90 days. The study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01277536. According to the Geneva Risk Score, the cumulative rate of the primary endpoint was 3.2% (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.2-4.6%) in 962 high-risk vs 0.6% (95% CI 0.2-1.9%) in 516 low-risk patients (p=0.002); among patients without prophylaxis, this rate was 3.5% vs 0.8% (p=0.029), respectively. In comparison, the Padua Prediction Score yielded a cumulative rate of the primary endpoint of 3.5% (95% CI 2.3-5.3%) in 714 high-risk vs 1.1% (95% CI 0.6-2.3%) in 764 low-risk patients (p=0.002); among patients without prophylaxis, this rate was 3.2% vs 1.5% (p=0.130), respectively. Negative likelihood ratio was 0.28 (95% CI 0.10-0.83) for the Geneva Risk Score and 0.51 (95% CI 0.28-0.93) for the Padua Prediction Score. In conclusion, among hospitalised medical patients, the Geneva Risk Score predicted VTE and VTE-related mortality and compared favourably with the Padua Prediction Score, particularly for its accuracy to identify low-risk patients who do not require thromboprophylaxis."

Diagnosis of NHL was confirmed by histology. Nine had lymphoblastic lymphoma, three had histiocytic lymphoma and one had small non-cleaved cell lymphoma, according to the Rappaport classification. After thorough clinical evaluation eight children were NHL stage IV; four were stage III; and one was stage II. All these children had received chemotherapy as acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) high-risk protocol for a total of three years, including central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis. Of the 13 patients, 9 (69.2%) gained complete remission. Over-all survival rate was 46.2%, with a median interval of 36 months. The complete remission rate and survival rate for the nine children with lymphoblastic lymphoma was better at 77.7% & 66.6% respectively. Within the nonresponsive group, two failed to remit because of early withdrawal from the protocol; the other two patients were refractory to treatment. Relapse was noted in one patient. As to the side effects, neutropenic fever was the most common problem encountered (9 occurrences in 13 patients). Other major complications included severe mucositis, massive GI bleeding, intracranial thrombosis induced by l-asparaginase and tumor lysis syndrome. Childhood NHL is often of diffuse types in pathology, and most affected children have advanced diseases at diagnosis. Choosing an optimal treatment protocol is important for good treatment results."
CD008201,0,20127272,0,Venous thromboembolism risk stratification in medically-ill hospitalized cancer patients. A comprehensive cancer center experience.,"Cancer and its treatment are recognized risk factors for VTE. Compliance rate with published VTE prophylaxis guidelines is low. Decision on when to offer prophylaxis for hospitalized cancer patients is difficult to make. This paper describes current clinical practice in offering VTE prophylaxis to hospitalized cancer patients. Prophylaxis rate and rate of VTE will be correlated with the risk level. We prospectively followed all consecutive adult cancer patients admitted to medical units over a 5-month period. Caprini risk assessment model, with some modifications, was utilized to determine risk of VTE. Six hundred and six patients (51% males, median age 52 years, range 18-91) were included. Reasons for admission included infections (25%), chemotherapy (22%) and palliative care (10%). In addition to cancer, the most frequently encountered risk factors for VTE were: Immobilization (35%), age > 60 years (31%) and body mass index > 30 in (20%). Patients were grouped according to their total risk score: low (9%), moderate (44%) and high risk (47%). VTE prophylaxis rate was 55.1% for the whole study group. Following discharge, patients were followed for 60 days. The incidence of VTE was 3.4% in the moderate and 4.2% in the high risk groups, while none in the low risk group developed VTE. Many additional risk factors for VTE are usually encountered in hospitalized cancer patients. Cancer alone may not be an enough reason for VTE prophylaxis. Risk assessment model able to stratify patients into different risk categories will simplify decision making and enhance VTE prophylaxis rate."

CD008201,0,20433681,0,Defining the population in need of thromboprophylaxis - making hospitals safer.,"Venous thromboembolism in adults is related to recent hospitalisation in approximately half of all cases and approximately half of all hospitalised adult patients are considered to be at risk by conventional criteria. Due to advances in surgical practice, the identification of surgical patients in need of prophylaxis has become less rather than more certain. Faster surgical technique, regional anaesthesia and early mobilisation are considered to reduce the risk of venous thromboembolism and hence possibly obviate the need for prophylaxis after early discharge from hospital. An increasing proportion of patients with hospital-acquired venous thromboembolism are medical patients, but the need to identify medical patients that require thromboprophylaxis is a new aspect of clinical practice for many physicians and prophylaxis remains under-utilised in non-surgical hospitalised patients. In this review prevention of hospital-acquired venous thromboembolism is considered as a patient safety issue in the context of changing clinical practice. Strategies for refining and validating risk assessment models and evaluating the effect of risk assessment and thromboprophylaxis are suggested."
CD008201,0,18828167,0,Prevention of venous thromboembolism in hospitalized medical patients.,"The hospitalized medical patient in the US today has multiple risk factors for venous thromboembolism (VTE) and is therefore at a significant risk of developing this condition both during hospitalization and after discharge. The American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) guidelines recommend pharmacologic prophylaxis unless there are contraindications. Low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWH) are the preferred class of drugs due to multiple advantages, including daily dosing and a decreased risk of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, to name a few. Several emerging oral anticoagulants, including Factor Xa inhibitors and direct thrombin inhibitors, are currently being evaluated in Phase III clinical trials as prophylaxis against VTE in medically ill patients and may some day replace parenteral drugs."
CD008201,0,15213839,0,Thromboprophylaxis in medical patients: the role of low-molecular-weight heparin.,"Many hospitalised medical patients are at increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Consensus statements recommend that such patients be assessed for risk of VTE on admission to hospital and receive thromboprophylaxis where appropriate. However, VTE prophylaxis is not widely used in medical patients. One explanation is that assessing medical patients' risk of VTE is complicated. The risk depends not only on the current illness but also on multiple intrinsic factors, and a variety of strategies for identifying patients who should receive thromboprophylaxis have been suggested. Thromboprophylaxis with unfractionated heparin (UFH) has proved to be effective in reducing the incidence of deep-vein thrombosis and overall mortality in medical patients. Clinical trial evidence, including a meta-analysis, suggests that thromboprophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is at least as effective as with UFH, and also has the advantage of fewer bleeding complications. In particular, two large, randomised clinical trials--Prophylaxis in Medical Patients with Enoxaparin (MEDENOX) and Prospective Evaluation of Dalteparin Efficacy for Prevention of VTE in Immobilized Patients Trial (PREVENT)--showed that thromboprophylaxis with the LMWHs enoxaparin (40 mg s.c. once daily) or dalteparin (5,000 IU once daily) is more effective than placebo and well tolerated in medical patients. In addition, the Thromboembolism-Prevention in Cardiopulmonary Diseases with Enoxaparin (THE-PRINCE) trial showed that enoxaparin treatment was as effective as UFH. These studies provide solid evidence for the widespread use of thromboprophylaxis in medical patients."

However, the increasing number of marginal donors, and the improvements in posttransplant immunossuppresion, chemotherapy and methods to assess the extrahepatic disseminationof colorectal cancer, opened the perspective of liver transplantation to certain patients with malignancies (such as HCC beyond Milan criteria, and selected patients with cholangiocarcinomaor liver metastases from neuroendocrine tumors).Since some of these patients experienced favorable outcomes,in the last years, there were authors that considered a rationalerevisitation of the benefits of liver transplantation in patients with unresectable colorectal liver metastases. Thus, in 2006, a Norwegian group started a study which aims to assess the results of liver transplantation in patients with unresectable colorect alliver metastases. Their results were unexpectedly favorable, revealing that 5-year overall survival rate was 60%, and the quality of life was excellent in the first year following transplantation.However, all the patients presented relapse of the disease in the first two years following transplantation. In the present paper we present the clinico-pathologic characteristics,the pre- and postoperative management and the outcome of a patient with unresectable colorectal liver metastases who underwent liver transplantation in a very advanced state of the disease (when he developed subacute liver failure due to insufficient functional liver parenchyma and toxicity of chemotherapy).We consider useful to present such observations,because collecting the data presented by different centers maybe contributive to identification of a selected group of patients who could benefit from liver transplantation."

CD008201,0,16270626,0,Assessment of venous thromboembolism risk and the benefits of thromboprophylaxis in medical patients.,"Hospitalized patients with acute medical conditions are at significant risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE): approximately 10-30% of general medical patients may develop deep-vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, and the latter is a leading contributor to deaths in hospital. Despite consensus-group recommendations that at-risk medical patients should receive thromboprophylaxis, there is currently no consensus as to which patients are at risk, and many patients may not receive appropriate thromboprophylaxis. This paper reviews evidence for the risk of VTE associated with different medical conditions and risk factors, and presents a risk-assessment model for risk stratification in medical patients. Medical conditions associated with a moderate to high risk of VTE include cardiac disease, cancer, respiratory disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and infectious diseases. Importantly, analyses of data from the MEDENOX study show that thromboprophylaxis significantly reduces the risk of VTE in these patient subgroups. Risk factors in medical patients include a history of VTE, history of malignancy, increasing age, thrombophilia, prolonged immobility, and obesity. These medical conditions and risk factors are included in a risk-assessment model which is hoped will provide a simple means of assisting clinicians in deciding whether thromboprophylaxis should be used in an individual patient."
CD008201,0,15194994,0,Antithrombotic therapies for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation.,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is now regarded as the arrhythmia for which patients are hospitalized the most frequently, an arrhythmia that is responsible for significant morbidity and mortality. Of particular importance is that the arrhythmia is associated with a significant incidence of thromboembolism which may induce disabling and incapacitating strokes, sometimes fatal. In the past, it was thought that in patients with AF restoration and maintenance of sinus rhythm prevent the development of strokes, a presumption that has not been vindicated by controlled clinical trials. On the other hand, over many decades, it has been established that appropriate anticoagulation especially with warfarin can reduce stroke rate in nonvalvular AF by about 70%, and mortality by 26%. Aspirin reduces stroke rate by 26%, mortality by about 10%. Thus, in AF oral anticoagulants have become the focal point of therapy for the prevention of strokes and the safety and efficacy of such a therapy has been established by controlled clinical trials; moreover, the subsets of patients with AF in whom anticoagulation is mandatory have been defined on the basis of defined risk factors. Warfarin is now the anticoagulant of choice although its limitations are considerable in terms of drug-drug interactions, narrow range of therapeutic index requiring strict monitoring of intensity of anticoagulation, among other limitations which influence compliance of therapy with the agent. In this review, the continuing role of warfarin in the prevention of stroke in patients with AF is discussed as a background for the development of newer anticoagulants. The issue is of particular importance in the older patients, in whom the development of safer antithrombotic therapies remain a major challenge. In this context, the potential role of the direct thrombin inhibitors hold promise for the future and the evolving data on leading compounds of this class which may be competitive with warfarin are discussed."

CD008201,0,7511449,0,[Severe dextran-induced anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reaction despite preventive hapten administration].,"Dextran-60 is widely used as a colloid volume substitute and for thromboprophylaxis. In order to avoid the most dangerous complication associated with dextran, the dextran-induced anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reaction (DIAR), hapten dextran is infused before starting the first application of dextran. We report of a 60-year-old man with multiple trauma, who received a dextran infusion for thromboprophylaxis because of high risk for thrombosis due to a severe thrombocytosis developing in the late postoperative period. Despite prophylaxis with monovalent hapten dextran, an anaphylactic reaction occurred. Although a serum sample drawn prior to the reaction is lacking, the causal relationship to dextran can be classified as likely, due to the close time relationship to the dextran-60 infusion. In addition, there were high titers of dextran-reactive antibodies in the blood drawn immediately after the reaction occurred. It is concluded that even after correct application of monovalent hapten dextran, dextran infusions carry the risk of severe anaphylactic reactions. They should therefore only be administered if clinical observation of the patient and the possibility of resuscitation are guaranteed."

In 50 consecutive stage II breast cancer patients (pre-peri-postmenopausal), and 50 controls, serial coagulation parameters including prothrombin time (P.T.), partial thromboplastin time (P.T.T.), fibrinogen, fibrinogen/fibrin degradation products (F.D.P.), protein C, protein S, antithrombin III (AT-III) and platelet count were performed. Blood samples for coagulation tests were collected at pretherapy, midtherapy (before the 3rd course), before the 6th course of chemotherapy, and 2 months after the cessation of therapy (post-therapy) of 6 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy (Cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2, Novantrone 10 mg/m2, 5-Fluorouracil 500 mg/m2). Chemotherapy was repeated every 3 weeks. None of our stage II breast cancer patients receiving adjuvant CNF chemotherapy developed thromboembolic complications. Before any treatment all the tested coagulation parameters were within the normal limits as compared to controls. No statistically significant changes of FDP were noted throughout the study. Fibrinogen, plasma protein C, protein S and AT-III were significantly decreased during chemotherapy. This decline was more evident at midtherapy. Their levels returned to the pretherapy values 2 months after the completion of chemotherapy. The P.T. was statistically shortened, while the P.T.T. showed a statistically significant prolongation during chemotherapy. In conclusion, it appears that monitoring stage II breast cancer with sophisticated coagulation tests during adjuvant CNF chemotherapy can not identify patients at high risk for thromboembolic events. These serially performed coagulation tests, could be considered as a cost-intensive monitoring and not justifiable as a screening for breast cancer patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy. However, the increasing number of reports of life-threatening and sometimes fatal thromboembolic events following chemotherapy or hormonochemotherapy are of great concern. Our results suggest caution when using chemotherapeutic agents in patients with other thrombosis risk factors, since a significant decrease of protein C and protein S was observed in all patients. Additional studies are required to determine the exact association between chemotherapy and/or hormonochemotherapy and thrombotic events."

In addition, the time from the operation to the time when the patients were readmitted with clinically suspected DVT and the distribution of radiologically-confirmed DVT were recorded. Thromboprophylaxis was routinely given for about 10 days to the high-risk groups during the hospital stay but not to patients undergoing knee arthroscopy. During 9 years, the annual incidence of DVT following major procedures was 2.1% (95% CI 1.6-2.6) vs. 0.6% (95% CI 0.2-1.1) after diagnostic knee arthroscopy. Symptoms appeared, on average, 27 (3-150) days after total hip replacement surgery, 36 (3-150) days after nailed hip fracture, 17 (6-30) days after total knee replacement and 1 (1-6) day after knee arthroscopy.

Surveillance bias occurs when some clinicians use imaging studies to detect VTE more frequently than other clinicians. Because they look more, they find more VTE events, paradoxically worsening their hospital's VTE quality measure performance. A surveillance bias may influence VTE measurement if (1) greater hospital VTE prophylaxis adherence fails to result in lower measured VTE rates, (2) hospitals with characteristics suggestive of higher quality (eg, more accreditations) have greater VTE prophylaxis adherence rates but worse VTE event rates, and (3) higher hospital VTE imaging utilization use rates are associated with higher measured VTE event rates."

Because high risk stigmata (visible vessels, active bleeders and adherent clots) often persist despite apparently successful initial hemostasis and have a variable natural history, it would seem reasonable to at least consider a routine second look endoscopy. However, a review of the literature revealed six randomized trials that, in aggregate, do not support such a strategy. In fact, a second look does not appear to be effective and is associated with an increased number of procedures, treatment sessions and possibly retreatment-related complications. In addition, the cointerventions in these trials are already out of date and the potential absolute risk reductions are low when a second look is used with intravenous proton pump inhibitors and/or the application of endoscopic hemoclips or combination endoscopic therapy. Finally, the Forrest classification may provide dangerously misleading estimates of prognosis because it is being used out of context. This review critically analyzes routine second look endoscopy."
CD008201,0,19839182,0,[Pravastatin and acetylsalycilic acid fixed-combination: a strategy to improve cardiovascular outcomes].,"The rationale behind combined statin-acetylsalicylic acid therapy is based on the beneficial effects ofacetylsalicylic acid on thrombosis, the leading immediate cause of the majority of occlusive cardiovascular events, and those of statins on atherosclerosis, which is the main underlying cause. The clinical benefits of combined pravastatin-acetylsalicylic acid in the management of coronary patients have been demonstrated by a meta-analysis of five randomized clinical trials for secondary prevention; compared with pravastatin alone, the pravastatin-acetylsalicylic acid combination reduced the risk of fatal or non fatal myocardial infarction by 26%, the risk of ischemic stroke by 31%, and the risk of cardiovascular events at 5 years by 13%. Combined pravastatin-acetylsalicylic acid therefore appears to significantly reduce the cardiovascular risk in coronary patients. Following the AHA/ACC and National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) I and II guidelines, the proportion of patients treated by acetylsalicylic acid, beta-blockers and statins increased significantly: 94%, 57% and 91% respectively at one year versus 68%, 18% and 10% before the guidelines were applied. The impact of these treatments on clinical outcomes is statistically significant in terms of recurrent myocardial infarction, the need for re-hospitalization, sudden death or all-cause mortality. Patients treated with combined statin-acetylsalicylic acid therapy have significantly improved clinical outcome and a significantly lower rate of coronary events at 1 year of follow-up. These data therefore confirm the importance of optimizing therapeutic management of coronary patients, and in particular with combined acetylsalicylic acid-statin therapy."
CD008201,0,26780743,0,Guidance for the prevention and treatment of the post-thrombotic syndrome.,"The post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) is a frequent, potentially disabling complication of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) that reduces quality of life and is costly. Clinical manifestations include symptoms and signs such as leg pain and heaviness, edema, redness, telangiectasia, new varicose veins, hyperpigmentation, skin thickening and in severe cases, leg ulcers. The best way to prevent PTS is to prevent DVT with pharmacologic or mechanical thromboprophylaxis used in high risk patients and settings. In patients whose DVT is treated with a vitamin K antagonist, subtherapeutic INRs should be avoided. We do not suggest routine use of elastic compression stockings (ECS) after DVT to prevent PTS, but in patients with acute DVT-related leg swelling that is bothersome, a trial of ECS is reasonable. We suggest that selecting patients for catheter-directed thrombolytic techniques be done on a case-by-case basis, with a focus on patients with extensive thrombosis, recent symptoms onset, and low bleeding risk, who are seen at experienced hospital centers. For patients with established PTS, we suggest prescribing 20-30 mm Hg knee-length ECS to be worn daily. If ineffective, a stronger pressure stocking can be tried. We suggest that intermittent compression devices or pneumatic compression sleeve units be tried in patients with moderate-to-severe PTS whose symptoms are inadequately controlled with ECS alone. We suggest that a supervised exercise training program for 6 months or more is reasonable for PTS patients who can tolerate it. We suggest that management of post-thrombotic ulcers should involve a multidisciplinary approach. We briefly discuss upper extremity PTS and PTS in children."
CD008201,0,16259529,0,Pharmacological prevention of venous thromboembolism in medical patients at risk.,"Acutely ill general medical patients are at moderate-to-high risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE); approximately 10-30% may develop deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, the latter being a leading contributor to deaths in hospital. Medical conditions associated with a high risk of VTE include cardiac disease, cancer, respiratory disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and infectious disease. Predisposing risk factors for VTE in medical patients include history of VTE, history of malignancy, complicating infections, increasing age, thrombophilia, prolonged immobility, and obesity. Unfractionated heparin (UFH), low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH), and fondaparinux sodium have been shown to be effective agents in the prevention of VTE in medical patients. In this setting, UFH has a higher rate of bleeding complications than LMWH. There is no evidence supporting the use of aspirin, warfarin, or mechanical methods to prevent VTE in medical patients. We recommend either LMWH or fondaparinux sodium as well tolerated and effective thromboprophylactic agents in medical patients."

This patient population includes those with brain neoplasm, intracranial hemorrhage, ischemic stroke, subarachnoid hemorrhage, pre- and post-operative patients undergoing neurosurgical procedures and those with traumatic brain injury, and acute spinal cord injury (SCI). There is a wide variability in clinical practice for thromboprophylaxis in these patients, in part due to paucity of data based on randomized clinical trials. Here, we review the current literature on the incidence of VTE in the critically ill neurological and neurosurgical patients as well as appraise available data to support particular practice paradigms for specific subsets of these patients. Data synthesis was conducted via search of Medline, Cochrane databases, and manual review of article bibliographies. Critically ill neurological and neurosurgical patients have higher susceptibility to VTE. Intermittent compression devices with or without anti-thrombotics is generally the method of choice for thromboprophylaxis. Low molecular weight heparin is the method of choice in certain patient subgroups such as those with SCI and ischemic stroke. Inferior vena cava filters may play a role in thromboprophylaxis in selected cases. Without clear guidelines that can be universally applied to this diverse group of patients, prophylaxis for VTE should be tailored to the individual patient with cautious assessment of benefits versus risks. There is a need for higher level evidence to guide VTE prophylaxis in certain subgroups of this patient population."

Etiology of EA COPD are mainly infectious, viral (rhinovirus, influenzae or parainfluenzae virus, coronavirus, adenovirus and respiratory syncytial virus) or bacterial (Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, or Moraxella catarrhalis). Pollutant exposure can also lead to AE COPD, such as NO2, SO2, ozone or particulates (PM10 and PM2.5). In 30% the etiology remains unknown. Differential diagnoses of AE COPD include infectious pneumonia, pneumothorax, acute heart failure and pulmonary embolism. Presences of signs of severity impose hospitalization: signs of respiratory distress, shock, acute confusion but also fragile patients, insufficient home support or absence of response to initial treatment. AE COPD treatments consist on increase in bronchodilators, chest physiotherapy, and antibiotics if sputum is frankly purulent. Systemic corticosteroids should not be systematic. Recommended dose is 0.5 mg/kg on short course (5-7 days). During hospitalization, oxygen supplementation and thromboprophylaxis could be prescribed.

CD008201,0,19022169,0,Knowledge of venous thromboembolism (VTE) prevention among hospitalized patients.,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE), which includes deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), is a serious cause of patient morbidity and mortality in hospitals, that is highly preventable. Literature strongly supports patient education on VTE prevention as it can promote strategies such as early ambulation and encourages self assessment and self reporting of VTE signs and symptoms. The purpose of this study was to investigate patient awareness and knowledge of thromboprophylaxis, as well as patient satisfaction with thromboprophylaxis. A quantitative, cross-sectional survey design was used, and 48 participants receiving pharmacological thromboprophylaxis participated. Most hospitalized patients (83%) were aware that were receiving injections to prevent blood clots and 81.2% reported hearing of either DVT, PE or both conditions. Of the participants who had heard of DVT and/or PE, 74.2% knew immobility was a risk factor but had limited knowledge of symptoms and prevention modalities. Participants reported hearing about VTE more frequently from friends, family or the media than from healthcare providers, including nurses. Participants were satisfied with pharmacological thromboprophylaxis but were less satisfied with the information received on VTE. Findings suggest that patients require further information on VTE during their hospitalization to enhance their involvement in VTE prevention and recognition, and that the provision of written, patient-directed information could begin to address that lack of involvement. This study also highlights the need to strengthen the nurses' role in providing patient education about VTE."

Dental implants, socket preservation peri-apical endodontic surgery and alveolar bone augmentation were introduced to dentistry within the last three decades. The common characteristics of all these treatments are the surgical technique involving soft as well as heard tissue. Within the last decade various new anti-thrombotic indications for treatments of patients at risk for thrombotic events and a new armamentarium of anti-thrombotics techniques were introduced. Both medical improvements confront the dental health providers with the problem of surgical treatment with the threat of bleeding. The treatment approach is based on a tradeoff between major bleeding versus a catastrophic thrombotic event. The magnitude of bleeding risk is a summation of the antithrombotic treatment and the extant of surgical treatment. In this article we will summarize the clinical guidelines of dental treatment for patients under anti-thrombotic treatment."

However, there is little information about its usefulness for predicting long-term prognosis of cardiovascular events in Japanese patients with paroxysmal AF. This study retrospectively included 332 paroxysmal AF patients (224 men, mean age 65±13 years, mean follow-up period 53±35 months) without receiving anticoagulant therapy between June 1995 and August 2008 who were categorized into risk stratification on the basis of CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc score."
CD008201,0,20967400,0,Treatments for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation: a network meta-analysis and indirect comparisons versus dabigatran etexilate.,"Patients with atrial fibrillation at moderate to high risk of stroke are not always anticoagulated despite a lack of contraindications to vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) like warfarin. These patients are treated with aspirin, aspirin-clopidogrel combination therapy or even receive no thromboprophylaxis. The oral direct thrombin inhibitor, dabigatran etexilate 150 mg BID and 110 mg BID, might represent an alternative for these patients; however, no head-to-head clinical trial data exist versus these alternative treatments. A network meta-analysis (NMA) was performed to indirectly compare dabigatran etexilate with antiplatelets and placebo. Compared with placebo, dabigatran etexilate 150 mg BID was estimated to significantly reduce the risk of any stroke (ischaemic and haemorrhagic) by 75% (relative risk [RR] 0.25; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.12-0.51), ischaemic stroke by 77% (RR 0.23; 95% CI 0.14-0.38), systemic embolism by 83% (RR 0.17; 95% CI 0.05-0.50) and mortality by 36% (RR 0.64; 95% CI 0.45-0.91). Dabigatran etexilate 150 mg BID was estimated to significantly reduce the risk of any stroke compared with aspirin monotherapy by 63% (RR 0.37; 95% CI 0.20-0.69) and aspirin plus clopidogrel by 61% (RR 0.39; 95% CI 0.21-0.72). Trends toward reduced risk with both dabigatran etexilate regimens were found for most clinical outcomes. Relative risk estimates of dabigatran etexilate versus adjusted-dose VKAs within the NMA were consistent with results from the head-to-head randomised trial of these two strategies. Indirect evidence suggests treatment with dabigatran etexilate offers benefit for the prevention of stroke, systemic embolism and mortality over antiplatelets and placebo. There was no indication of increased intracranial or extracranial haemorrhage with dabigatran etexilate compared to antiplatelet agents."

Because the biggest advantage of OPCAB may be that it can prevent perioperative stroke, we selected patients for OPCAB based on the preoperative evaluation of neck and intracranial vessels. We could totally eliminate intraoperative stroke in patients undergoing OPCAB, although some patients with a severe neck vessel disease developed postoperative stroke/transient ischemic attack in an early postoperative period (the 4th approximately 8th postoperative day) mostly due to thrombosis from the diseased vessel. Therefore, high-risk patients with a severe neck vessel disease should be treated with a more aggressive anticoagulation protocol postoperatively. As for the quality of grafting, the number of graft, the rate of complete revascularization, and early graft patency were comparable between OPCAB and CABG with a cardiopulmonary bypass. The long-term results in terms of freedom from cardiac death and cardiac events were also comparable. We conclude that we could achieve less invasiveness in coronary revascularization by using an OPCAB technique without compromising the quality of grafting."

However, many are already taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) that can have antihaemostatic effects. We assessed the bleeding risk in patients treated with thromboprophylactic dabigatran etexilate, with and without concomitant NSAID or ASA. A post-hoc analysis was undertaken of the pooled data from trials comparing dabigatran etexilate (220 mg and 150 mg once daily) and enoxaparin. Major bleeding event (MBE) rates were determined and odds ratios (ORs) generated for patients who received study treatment plus NSAID (half-life ≤12 hours) or ASA (≤160 mg/day) versus study treatment alone. Relative risks were calculated for comparisons between treatments. Overall, 4,405/8,135 patients (54.1%) received concomitant NSAID and 386/8,135 (4.7%) received ASA.ORs for the comparison with/without concomitant NSAID were 1.05 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.55-2.01) for 220 mg dabigatran etexilate; 1.19 (0.55-2.55) for 150 mg; and 1.32 (0.67-2.57) for enoxaparin. ORs for the comparison with/without ASA were 1.14 (0.26-5.03); 1.64 (0.36-7.49); and 2.57 (0.83-7.94), respectively. For both NSAIDs and ASA there was no significant difference in bleeding between patients with and without concomitant therapy in any treatment arm. Patients concomitantly taking NSAIDs or ASA have a similar risk of MBE to those taking dabigatran etexilate alone. No significant differences in MBE were detected between dabigatran etexilate and enoxaparin within co-medication subgroups, suggesting that no increased major bleeding risk exists when dabigatran etexilate is administered with NSAID or ASA."

Previous studies have relied on retrospective and often incomplete clinical data, for comparison with pathological findings. The present study is based on 1073 consecutive stroke patients admitted to an intensive care stroke unit from a well-defined population. There were 212 deaths within the first 30 days, yielding a mortality rate of 20%. Clinical, radiological, and laboratory data were collected prospectively according to a standardized protocol. Autopsies were performed on 90 of the 212 patients, and CT scanning on a further 27. Early mortality after stroke exhibits a bimodal distribution. One peak occurs during the first week, and a second during the second and third weeks. The majority of deaths in the first week are due to transtentorial herniation. Of these, deaths due to hemorrhage usually occur within the first three days, whilst deaths due to infarction peak between the third and sixth day post ictus. After the first week, deaths due to relative immobility (pneumonia, pulmonary embolism and sepsis) predominate, peaking towards the end of the second week. Cardiac deaths occur throughout the first month, and unfortunately account for many deaths in patients with small functional deficits."

A member of the clinical staff was seconded to oversee this implementation and co-ordinate audit of current in the main clinical specialties within the trust. The Trust Clinical Audit Committee agreed to fund this low cost initiative (approximately 3,800 pounds) from clinical guideline monies. Findings from the initial audit revealed a total of 224 patients identified as 'at risk' of developing deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. Of this number 72.8%, (n = 163), were prescribed prophylaxis compared with the pre-set standard of 90.0%. Fifty four percent, (n = 122), of all identified patients were prescribed the correct prophylaxis in accordance with SIGN guideline recommendations. As a result of the initial findings local prevention protocols were developed or upgraded as required in line with the national guideline. The repeat audit findings highlighted a significant increase in the number of 'at risk' patients prescribed prophylaxis rising from 72.8% to 97.4% (P < 0.001) and similarly from 54.5% to 95.9% for those prescribed the correct prophylaxis (P < 0.001)."

The regimens differed in the time of Fraxiparin administration (before or after surgery). Fraxiparin and spinal anesthesia were found to promote the lower incidence of venous thromboembolism. The preoperative preventive treatment of venous thromboembolism, by using a low molecular-weight heparin in patients undergoing spinal anesthesia is unnecessary because of a high risk of epidural hematomas. If the risk for venous thromboembolism is higher before surgery and remains the same after it, thromboprophylaxis should be prolonged for at least one month."

Without prophylaxis, pulmonary embolism is known to occur in 1% to 2% of hospitalized patients. Pneumatic foot compression devices have recently been developed to increase lower extremity circulation and, as a result, are effective in thromboembolic disease prophylaxis. Recent studies in total hip and total knee arthroplasty have documented a statistically significant reduction in deep venous thrombosis using these devices. Interestingly, studies utilizing pneumatic foot compression have demonstrated a reduction in lower extremity edema both postoperatively and after significant lower extremity trauma. Pneumatic foot compression appears to be more applicable than the previous mechanical devices, and as a result, compliance appears to have improved."

In guidelines we read that elective surgery, at the asymptomatic stage, can only be recommended in selected patients, at low operative risk (see guidelines of European Society of Cardiology and American Heart Association), but we have not read any reference to patients with severe calcific aortic stenosis after symptomatic spontaneous calcium cerebral embolism. Because cardioembolic stroke is associated with poor prognosis compared to other stroke subtypes, in patients with asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis and spontaneous calcific embolic stroke valve replacement appears to offer the best hope of avoiding a recidivation of stroke and should be considered in most cases. On the contrary, is it still correct to consider as asymptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis and cerebral thromboembolism from a calcified aortic valve?"
CD008201,0,23127461,0,Paradoxical cerebral embolism after total knee arthroplasty.,"Deep vein thrombosis is a frequent complication following total joint arthroplasty and other major orthopedic procedures. Pulmonary embolism occurs with or without a diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis, although infrequently (1.5%-10%). In patients with congenital cardiac defects, such as a patent foramen ovale, paradoxical cerebral embolism may also occur. This article describes a case of a 52-year-old woman who sustained a paradoxical cerebral embolism following total knee arthroplasty. In the workup of a patient with a known murmur and stroke symptoms, paradoxical cerebral embolism should be included in the differential. The initial evaluation should incorporate transesophageal echocardiography because of its accuracy in the demonstration of the cardiac physiology. An abnormal intracardiac or intrapulmonary shunt is essential for paradoxical cerebral embolism, allowing the entrance of the thrombus into cerebral circulation from the venous system. No clear consensus has been reached on the management of patients at risk for paradoxical cerebral embolism prior to orthopedic procedures. However, when an embolic stroke is diagnosed acutely, ideal management includes thrombolytic therapy, but further research is needed to confirm that this is the correct management. Due to the risk of recurrence, postoperative thromboprophylaxis is recommended with or without closure of the foramen ovale. Most importantly, and as demonstrated by the current patient, who partially recovered but did not require walking assistance after 2-year follow-up, treating physicians should be prepared to counsel patients through a lengthened physical rehabilitative process."

CD008201,0,17024597,0,Inherited thrombophilia and venous thromboembolism.,"The term thrombophilia includes any inherited and acquired disorders associated with an increased tendency to venous thromboembolism (VTE). Inherited thrombophilia is one of the main determinants of VTE, and the presence of inherited thrombophilic defects exposed carriers to increased risks for VTE compared with noncarriers. There is no clear relationship between clinical manifestations and the type of underlying thrombophilic defect. Thus, the diagnosis of inherited thrombophilia has to be established on a laboratory basis. Carriers of thrombophilic defects may experience thrombosis at a younger age than noncarriers. However, a first thrombotic manifestation that occurs late in life may also be an expression of thrombophilia and this remains in many cases the only etiopathogenetic explanation for the event. Screening of family members of symptomatic probands has the potential to identify still asymptomatic carriers who may benefit from more appropriate thromboprophylaxis during high-risk situations for VTE. Women of fertile age who belong to these thrombophilic families might receive the greatest advantage from screening. Many inherited thrombophilic disorders can be considered risk factors for recurrent VTE, especially if more than one defect is present in the same patient. More intensive or prolonged duration of VTE treatment might be requested for the prevention of recurrent VTE in the most severe thrombophilic conditions. The availability of new methods for the assessment of thrombin generation in terms of endogenous thrombin potential are very promising tools for the identification of those carriers of inherited thrombophilia who will develop thrombosis or who will encounter recurrence of VTE."

Recent practice guidelines on VTE in oncology from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network and American Society of Clinical Oncologists have further highlighted this relationship and could bridge performance measures and outcomes that can affect the strategies for preventing deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in oncology patients. Hospitals and physicians with poor performance data will have problems with payment from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and contracting the best rates from other payors. Hospital accreditation from The Joint Commission could be an issue for poorly performing institutions, as could consumer acceptance.

CD008201,0,21932963,0,Anti-thrombotic therapy in infective endocarditis.,"Despite advances in medical and surgical treatment, infective endocarditis (IE) still carries a high risk of morbidity and mortality. One of the determinants of an adverse outcome is the presence of systemic embolization and in particular, of CNS embolization. IE vegetations consist of bacteria, platelets and inflammatory cells in a fibrin mesh. The interactions between pathogens, platelets and the coagulation system are critical to vegetation initiation and growth. This understanding has led to the study of the effect of anti-thrombotic treatment on IE vegetation formation and embolization. Although it has been demonstrated that antiplatelet and anticoagulant strategies have an impact on in vitro and animal models of IE, results from the available clinical studies are conflicting. In this article, we provide an overview of the available experimental and clinical data on anti-thrombotic treatment in IE and summarize the current guidelines. An early diagnosis, prompt empiric antibiotic treatment and a careful selection of patients who benefit from early surgical intervention remain essential in the prevention of embolic complications. In patients who have other indications for antiplatelet or anticoagulant treatment, the continuation of this treatment is deemed safe in the absence of hemorrhagic complications."

CD008201,0,15028346,0,Comparing the guidelines: anticoagulation therapy to optimize stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation.,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an important risk factor for stroke. According to a pooled analysis of controlled clinical trials with warfarin, anticoagulation therapy reduces stroke risk by 62%. However, clinicians must decide whether the benefit of long-term anticoagulation therapy with available agents outweighs the risk of bleeding for individual patients. Guidelines issued by the American College of Chest Physicians and by the joint American College of Cardiology, American Heart Association, and the European Society of Cardiology task force recommend antithrombotic therapy to protect AF patients from stroke based on risk-stratification algorithms. Risk factors for stroke AF patients include age > or =75 years; hypertension; thyrotoxicosis; diabetes; cardiovascular disease; congestive heart failure; and history of stroke, transient ischemic attack, or thromboembolism. Patients at high risk for stroke experience greater absolute benefit from anticoagulation therapy than patients at low risk. The guidelines are consistent in recommendations for high-risk patients (warfarin therapy, international normalized ratio 2.0 to 3.0) and low-risk patients (aspirin 325 mg), but differ for intermediate-risk patients with diabetes or heart disease. The guidelines continue to evolve, and future guidelines are likely to incorporate new clinical data, including the CHADS(2) algorithm for determining risk and the results of the Atrial Fibrillation Follow-up Investigation of Rhythm Management trial, the Rate Control versus Electrical Cardioversion for Persistent Atrial Fibrillation study, and the Stroke Prevention Using an Oral Thrombin Inhibitor in Atrial Fibrillation II to V trials."

They do not require routine coagulation monitoring. However, in special clinical settings (emergency surgery, bleeding, thrombosis, control of the patient's compliance, suspected overdose, potential drug interference, and so on), measurement of plasma levels is needed. Several available anti-FXa assays are used for monitoring anticoagulant activity of heparins and fondaparinux. They must be modified and standardized for the measurement of direct FXa inhibitors (rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, betrixaban and others). The use of calibrators (lyophilized plasma with a known concentration of drug) allows an expression of the results in ng per ml of plasma. Two categories of assays - endogenous and exogenous assays are available. Endogenous assays are useful in pharmaceutical research, while exogenous assays are used in clinical laboratories. The preferred anti-FXa assay is a specific method in contrast to prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time, but it is not available everywhere at any time. A specific measurement of direct FXa inhibitors is feasible with the use of a new test developed by the authors' group.

A total of 148 papers were found using the reported search, of which four presented the best evidence to answer the clinical question. The author, date and country of publication, patient group studied, study type, relevant outcomes, results and study weaknesses of these best papers are tabulated. The clinical bottom line is that ambulatory patients with temporary lower leg immobilisation who are over 50, in a rigid cast, non-weight bearing or with a severe injury should be considered as an at risk group for venous thromboembolism (VTE). If there are any other current proven VTE risk factors, patients should be considered as high risk."

CD008201,0,17992495,0,[Care of patients after coronary stent implantation: what is important in practice?].,"The introduction of Drug Eluting Stents was an important step to reduce restenosis rate after coronary stent implantation. Unfortunately, reduction of restenosis was paid off by the price of potential increased late (>30 days) stent thrombosis. However, current data are not completely conclusive with respect to extent and duration of stent thrombosis and cardiovascular risk after drug eluting stent implantation. Until now, especially for patients at risk for stent thrombosis a prolonged (12 instead of 6 months) dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel is recommended. Thereby, the quality of physician instructions is predictive for patient's compliance. Premature termination of dual antiplatelet therapy should be avoided; many small surgical interventions (e.g. tooth extraction) can be performed under dual antiplatelet therapy. Patients with ""triple therapy"" (aspirin, clopidogrel and coumarin derivate) should be monitored carefully, since they have an excessive bleeding risk. An elective coronary angiography after coronary stent implantation is not routinely necessary. However in selected high-risk patients (e.g. left main or multivessel stent implantation) control angiography may be useful. Medical therapy of risk factors (hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus) is essential also after coronary stent implantation. It is important to screen patients for diabetes mellitus, since approximately 1/3 of patients after coronary intervention have an otherwise unrecognized diabetes mellitus or glucose tolerance disturbance."

This tumor is known to occur in the central nervous system and soft tissue, but recently determined to also invade the kidney. Although primary renal PNET is very rare, we encountered a case of primary renal PNET with multiple lung metastasis. This case was a 35-year-old man with a chief complaint of macroscopic hematuria, which he noticed in January 1996. He was hospitalized because of right renal tumor detected with ultrasonography. On CT scan, a low-density solid tumor with a maximum diameter of 8 cm was visualized in the right kidney. Low-signal and high-signal tumorous lesions were demonstrated in the same region on T 1-weighted and T 2-weighted MR images, respectively. Then right radical nephrectomy was performed on Feb. 5, 1996. On histopathological observation, the tumor was composed of small tumor cells with solid growth. Immunohistochemical staining revealed that the tumor was positive for CD 99. Thus our final diagnosis was primary right renal PNET. Although 2 metastatic lesions with a diameter of about 1 cm were observed in the right lower lung before the time of surgery, pulmonary metastatic lesions markedly increased in number 3 months after surgery. Thus we initiated CAP chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and CDDP. After 3 cycles, pulmonary metastatic lesions disappeared at CT scan, indicating complete remission. However, a tumor with a maximum diameter of about 10 cm recurred in the retroperitoneum 7 months after complete remission.

A prospective trial involving 25 trauma patients admitted to Memorial Regional Hospital (Hollywood, Florida), a Level I trauma center, from April 1997 to April 1998, meeting the criteria for insertion of a prophylactic IVC filter according to Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma trauma practice guidelines was conducted. IVC filters were placed in the ICU with the use of a digital C-arm (Siemens) and strict adherence to sterile technique. Renal vein anatomy and size of the IVC were documented for every case. Charges for equipment and supplies were analyzed and compared with those placed in the radiology suite and the operating room. Of 810 patients admitted as trauma alerts during the study period, 25 had an IVC filter placed at the bedside in the ICU. The indications for filter placement included a contraindication to anticoagulation and one of the following: severe pelvic fracture and/or associated long-bone fracture (32%); bilateral lower extremity fractures (28%); spinal cord injury with para- or quadriplegia (16%); femoral vein thrombosis (16%); and severe brain injury (8%). There were no intraoperative nor postoperative complications; overall mortality was 20 per cent, unrelated to the IVC filter placement. Average time for insertion was 47 minutes for the series and 20 minutes for the last five cases. Savings of $1844 or $2245 per filter are obtained when IVC filters are placed in the ICU when compared with the operating room or radiology suite, respectively. Bedside placement of IVC filters in the ICU is a safe, cost-effective method that can be performed without compromising the patient and avoids the potential disasters involved in transporting critically ill patients."

CD008201,0,15383488,0,Use of antithrombotic agents during pregnancy: the Seventh ACCP Conference on Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy.,"This chapter about the use of antithrombotic agents during pregnancy is part of the Seventh ACCP Conference on Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy: Evidence Based Guidelines. Grade 1 recommendations are strong and indicate that the benefits do, or do not, outweigh risks, burden, and costs. Grade 2 suggests that individual patients' values may lead to different choices (for a full understanding of the grading see Guyatt et al, CHEST 2004; 126:179S-187S). Among the key recommendations in this chapter are the following: for women requiring long-term vitamin K antagonist therapy who are attempting pregnancy, we suggest performing frequent pregnancy tests and substituting unfractionated heparin (UFH) or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) for warfarin when pregnancy is achieved (Grade 2C). In women with acute venous thromboembolism (VTE), we recommend adjusted-dose LMWH throughout pregnancy or IV UFH for at least 5 days, followed by adjusted-dose UFH or LMWH for the remainder of the pregnancy and at least 6 weeks postpartum (Grade 1C+). In patients with a single episode of VTE associated with a transient risk factor that is no longer present, we recommend antepartum clinical surveillance and postpartum anticoagulants (Grade 1C). In patients with a single episode of VTE and thrombophilia or strong family history of thrombosis and not receiving long-term anticoagulants, we suggest antepartum prophylactic or intermediate-dose LMWH or minidose or moderate-dose UFH, plus postpartum anticoagulants (Grade 2C). In patients with multiple (two or more) episodes of VTE and/or women receiving long-term anticoagulants, we suggest antepartum adjusted-dose UFH or adjusted-dose LMWH followed by long-term anticoagulants postpartum (Grade 2C). For pregnant patients with antiphospholipid antibodies (APLAs) and a history of two or more early pregnancy losses or one or more late pregnancy losses, preeclampsia, intrauterine growth retardation, or abruption, we suggest antepartum aspirin plus minidose or moderate-dose UFH or prophylactic LMWH (Grade 2B). We suggest one of the following approaches for women with APLAs without prior VTE or pregnancy loss: surveillance, minidose heparin, prophylactic LMWH, and/or low-dose aspirin, 75 to 325 mg/d (all Grade 2C). In women with prosthetic heart valves, we recommend adjusted-dose bid LMWH throughout pregnancy (Grade 1C), aggressive adjusted-dose UFH throughout pregnancy (Grade 1C), or UFH or LMWH until the thirteenth week and then change to warfarin until the middle of the third trimester before restarting UFH or LMWH (Grade 1C). In high-risk women with prosthetic heart valves, we suggest the addition of low-dose aspirin, 75 to 162 mg/d (Grade 2C)."

CD008201,0,21478058,0,Therapeutics and anaesthesia.,"Many aspects of hypertension care outside pregnancy may be applied in pregnancy, but little information is available on which to base decision-making. It would seem reasonable to continue previous dietary salt restriction and physical activity in women with pre-existing (and controlled) hypertension, encourage a heart-healthy diet in all women with a hypertension disorder of pregnancy, and take patient preference into account when deciding on place of care. Although bed rest has become a key part of obstetric practice and for care of women with a hypertension disorder of pregnancy, in particular, the evidence is lacking to support this practice. This may also increase thromboembolic risk. Antihypertensive treatment is strongly advised for women with severe hypertension. The most common agents are parenteral labetalol, hydralazine, or oral nifedipine capsules. Clinicians should familiarise themselves with multiple agents. Until the role of antihypertensive treatment for non-severe hypertension in pregnancy is clarified by ongoing research, clinicians should explicitly state an individual patient's blood pressure goal, which could reasonably be anywhere between 130/80 and 155/105 mmHg. Labetalol and methyldopa are used most commonly. Breastfeeding should be encouraged. Many risk factors for hypertension (e.g. obesity), as well as hospitalisation and pre-eclampsia, all increase the thromboembolic risk for pregnant women, and care providers should consider thromboprophylaxis in the appropriate setting. Finally, anaesthetists play a critical role in the management of women with a hypertension disorder of pregnancy, and should be involved earlier rather than later in the course of their care."

The information and advice given to pregnant patients by healthcare professionals are generally of good-to-excellent quality, but not universally offered. A total of 40% of mothers wore the GECS all the time, while 38% did not wear them at all. Among the non-wearers, the two major groups were those who did not receive any advice (28%) and those who found them uncomfortable (18%).

CD008201,0,15953008,0,Thromboembolism in children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia treated on Dana-Farber Cancer Institute protocols: effect of age and risk stratification of disease.,"Children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) are at increased risk for thromboembolism (TE). Identification of a susceptible population is crucial for effective thromboprophylaxis. However, the risk factors for ALL-associated TE are unclear. Concomitant asparaginase (ASP) and steroid therapy has been shown to increase the incidence of TE. Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI)-ALL protocols use a combination of ASP and steroids during the postinduction intensification phase when high-risk (HR) patients receive thrice the steroid-dose given to standard-risk (SR) patients. We studied prospectively assembled cohorts of children treated on two consecutive DFCI-ALL protocols to define the risk factors for symptomatic TE. Ten (11%) of 91 patients developed symptomatic TE; eight (seven HR) during intensification. Seven (44%) of 16 older patients (>/=10 years) compared with three of 75 (4%) younger patients developed TE (P < 0.0001). Nine of 35 (26%) HR and one of 56 (2%) SR patients developed TE (P = 0.0006). Gender, ALL-immunophenotype, steroid-type or ASP dosing schedule did not alter the risk but older age and HR-disease were factors predisposing to TE associated with DFCI-ALL protocols. Age-related risk may partly reflect the effect of ALL-risk stratification. Higher dose steroids combined with ASP may lead to an increased risk of TE in HR patients."

CD008201,0,23568790,0,Advances in stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation: enhanced risk stratification combined with the newer oral anticoagulants.,"Patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) have an increased stroke risk compared with those in sinus rhythm, although the absolute risk for individual patients is modulated by the presence of various additional risk factors. Patient selection for oral anticoagulation for stroke prevention is based on risks of stroke and bleeding. Although CHADS2 (congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥75 years, diabetes mellitus, stroke or transient ischemic attack) is the most widely used scheme for evaluating stroke risk in patients with AF, several other stroke risk factors are not included; therefore, many patients' stroke risk may be underestimated, contributing to the underuse of anticoagulants. Furthermore, a substantial proportion of patients are categorized as being at moderate risk (CHADS2 = 1), and there has been some ambiguity regarding optimum thromboprophylaxis in this group. The refinement of CHADS2 , CHA2 DS2 -VASc (Congestive heart failure, Hypertension, Age 75 years [2 points], Diabetes mellitus, Stroke or transient ischemic attack [2 points], Vascular disease, Age 65 to 74 years, Sex category [female]), considers additional risk factors. Its main advantage is its ability to identify patients truly at low risk of thromboembolism (CHA2 DS2 -VASc = 0), who are unlikely to benefit from antithrombotic therapy. For all others, an oral anticoagulant may be the preferred approach, simplifying clinical decision making. Implementation of CHA2 DS2 -VASc may also result in an increased proportion of patients receiving anticoagulation. The emergence of newer oral anticoagulants that can be given without routine coagulation monitoring, with improved benefit-risk profiles vs vitamin K antagonists, promises to simplify therapy for patients with AF at risk of stroke. This, coupled with advances in stroke risk stratification, is expected to improve patient outcomes and reduce the burden of AF-related stroke."
CD008201,0,24547604,0,Treatment and prognosis in peptic ulcer bleeding.,"Peptic ulcer bleeding is a frequent cause of admission. Despite several advances in treatment the 30-day mortality seems unchanged at a level around 11%. Use of risk scoring systems is shown to be advantageous in the primary assessment of patients presenting with symptoms of peptic ulcer bleeding. Studies performed outside Denmark have demonstrated that use of risk scoring systems facilitates identification of low-risk patients suitable for outpatient management. Nevertheless, these systems have not been implemented for routine use in Denmark. This is mainly explained by concerns about the external validity due to considerable inter-country variation in patients' characteristics. In recent years, transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) has become increasingly used for achievement of hemostasis in patients with peptic ulcer bleeding not responding to endoscopic therapy. As rebleeding is associated with poor outcome TAE could, in theory, also be beneficial as a supplementary treatment in patients with ulcer bleeding responding to endoscopic therapy. This has not been examined previously. Several studies have concluded that peptic ulcer bleeding is associated with excess long-term mortality. These findings are, however, questioned as the studies were based on life-table analysis, unmatched control groups, or did not perform adequate adjustment for comorbidity. Treatment with blood transfusion is, among patients undergoing cardiac bypass surgery, shown to increase the long-term mortality. Despite frequent use of blood transfusion in treatment of peptic ulcer bleeding a possible adverse effect of on long-term survival has not been examined in these patients. The aims of the present thesis were: 1. To examine which risk scoring system is best at predicting need of hospital-based intervention, rebleeding, and mortality in patients presenting with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (Study I) 2. To evaluate if supplementary transcatheter arterial embolization (STAE) after successful endoscopic haemostasis improves outcome in patients with PUB with active bleeding, a non-bleeding visible vessel, or an adherent clot (Study II) 3. To examine the short- and long-term mortality in PUB compared to a matched control group including identification of predictive factors for adverse outcome, identification of underlying causes of death, and investigation of a possible association between treatment with blood transfusion and long-term mortality (Study III). Study I was conducted as a prospective validation study. During a two-year period 831 patients presenting with upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage were included. The study demonstrated that the Glasgow Blatchford Score (GBS) was superior to the other risk scoring systems at predicting need for hospital-based intervention. The GBS was found to be favourable for the assessment of Danish patients presenting with symptoms of upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage. According to the findings of Study 1 implementation of the GBS at a 1000-bed hospital would be associated with a 90.000 EUR annual saving through avoidance of admission of patients in very low risk of needing hospital-based intervention. None of the examined risk scoring systems were suitable for predicting risk of rebleeding or 30-day mortality. Study II was designed as a non-blinded, stratified, parallel group, randomized controlled trial. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive STAE within 24 hours from therapeutic endoscopy or to continue standard treatment. A total of 105 patients were included. After adjustment for possible imbalances STAE was associated with a clear trend of reduced rate of rebleeding (P=.079). Numbers needed to treat in order to avoid one case of rebleeding was 10. Study III was conducted as a prospective cohort study. The long-term survival of 455 patients admitted with peptic ulcer bleeding was compared to an age- and sex-matched control group consisting of 2224 individuals selected from the same geographical area. Long-term mortality was adjusted for differences in comorbidity using the Charlson comorbidity index. The study demonstrated that peptic ulcer bleeding is associated with long-lasting excess mortality. Age, recurrent bleeding, and comorbidity were predictors for 30-day mortality. The underlying cause of 30-day mortality was in the majority of patients related to comorbidity. The main predictors for long-term mortality were old age, comorbidity, male sex, severe anaemia and tobacco use. Although severe anaemia predicted long-term mortality treatment with blood transfusion was not associated with long-term mortality per se."

CD008201,0,19768886,0,Breast Cancer Risk Reduction Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology.,"Breast cancer risk factor analysis allows the identification of women at very high risk for the future development of breast cancer. Many of the known risk factors are either not modifiable or are not reasonably modifiable because of social implications or other potential health benefits (eg, those associated with hormone replacement therapy). Thus, effective strategies to decrease the risk of breast cancer are needed. The recent demonstration that the use of tamoxifen for 5 years decreases the future risk of breast cancer by approximately 49% provides the opportunity for a risk-reduction intervention. Women taking tamoxifen must be monitored for the occurrence of well-defined toxicities, including hot flashes and, more rarely, endometrial carcinoma, thromboembolic disease, and cataract formation. Strategies are available for the management of tamoxifen toxicity. In special circumstances, such as in carriers of BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations, the risk of future breast cancer is very high, and the performance of a bilateral prophylactic mastectomy may be considered. Women considering bilateral prophylactic mastectomy should undergo multidisciplinary consultation so that they may make a fully informed decision. The panel strongly encourages patients and health care providers to participate in clinical trials to test new strategies for decreasing the risk of breast cancer. Only through the accumulated experience gained from well-designed, prospective clinical trials will additional advances in the reduction of breast cancer risk be realized."

CD008201,0,2568180,0,Postinfarction unstable angina. Pathophysiologic basis for current treatment modalities.,"Unstable angina is an acute coronary syndrome characterized by the rapid progression of clinical symptoms which may culminate in acute myocardial infarction, infarct extension or sudden death. The pathologic substrate involves atherosclerotic plaque rupture with platelet deposition, thrombus formation and coronary arterial spasm. Patients with postinfarction angina represent a high-risk subgroup with severe multivessel disease, compromised collateral vessels and/or partially occlusive thrombi; their risk of infarct extension and death is significantly increased. Initial therapy includes nitrates, beta-adrenergic blockers, calcium channel antagonists, aspirin and possibly i.v. heparin, as well as prompt identification and control of exacerbating factors. Thrombolytic therapy may assume a more central role based on its ability to achieve rapid clinical stabilization. Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and coronary artery bypass grafting may be used emergently in patients refractory to medical therapy, or electively when clinically indicated."
CD008201,0,20044690,0,The impact of national guidelines for the prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism on the complications of arthroplasty of the lower limb.,"The National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) produces recommendations on appropriate treatment within the National Health Service (NHS) in England and Wales. The NICE guidelines on prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism in orthopaedic surgery recommend that all patients be offered a low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). The linked hospital episode statistics of 219 602 patients were examined to determine the rates of complications following lower limb arthroplasty for the 12-month periods prior to and following the publication of these guidelines. These were compared with data from the National Joint Registry (England and Wales) regarding the use of LMWH during the same periods. There was a significant increase in the reported use of LMWH (59.5% to 67.6%, p < 0.001) following the publication of the guidelines. However, the 90-day venous thromboembolism events actually increased slightly following total hip replacement (THR, 1.69% to 1.84%, p = 0.06) and remained unchanged following total knee replacement (TKR, 1.99% to 2.04%). Return to theatre in the first 30 days for infection did not show significant changes. There was an increase in the number of patients diagnosed with thrombocytopenia, which was significant following THR (0.11% to 0.16%, p = 0.04). The recommendations from NICE are based on predicted reductions in venous thromboembolism events, reducing morbidity, mortality and costs to the NHS. The early results in orthopaedic patients do not support these predictions, but do show an increase in complications."

CD008201,0,19355809,0,Antiplatelet therapy for improving post-PCI outcomes: interpreting current treatment guidelines for optimal management of the post-ACS patient.,"Dual antiplatelet therapy with a thienopyridine in combination with aspirin for 1 to 6 months after stenting has been recommended by the manufacturers to reduce ischemic cardiovascular events and thrombosis after coronary stenting, whereas the current leading guidelines recommend dual antiplatelet therapy for 12 months following percutaneous coronary intervention in all patients not at high risk of bleeding. Despite the established benefits of dual antiplatelet therapy in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients, there are concerns regarding the risk of major bleeding. The risks, benefits, and complexity identified in these interventional trials are communicated in this article to enable well-informed therapeutic decisions. Thienopyridine nonresponsiveness and variability of response are emerging as significant concerns in ACS patients that may lead to poor long-term cardiovascular outcomes. Current research on thienopyridine responsiveness and evidence-based mechanisms for overcoming thienopyridine nonresponsiveness are discussed. In addition, adherence to dual antiplatelet therapy is critical but difficult to achieve, and a considerable proportion of patients (1 of 7) discontinue therapy before 30 days of drug-eluting stent implantation. It has been established that premature discontinuation of thienopyridine therapy is associated with a marked increase in the risk of stent thrombosis (and consequently myocardial infarction and/or death) and is the leading independent predictor of stent thrombosis in multivariate analyses. The factors related to premature cessation of thienopyridine therapy are listed with recommendations for minimizing the complications arising as a result of premature discontinuation."
CD008201,0,17534792,0,Color Doppler ultrasonography percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of vascular access grafts.,"Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) is a possible treatment for stenosis. This study aimed to verify the impact of a vascular access (VA) surveillance protocol, based on the detection of functional changes and their correction by a new PTA method for VA performed under color Doppler ultrasonography (CDU) guidance. We divided the patients into two groups: group A, before May 1999 (retrospective study) without the surveillance protocol, and group B, from 1 May 1999 to January 2001 (prospective study) with the surveillance protocol. Access blood flow (Qa) was assessed every 4 weeks by ultrasound velocity dilution. In cases of a reduction of >or=35% from the baseline value, VA was examined using CDU: if a stenosis >50% was detected, angioplasty was performed. In cases of Qa reduction <35% we continued monitoring. By Coxs multivariate analyses, only the use of PTA with or without stenting reduced the relative risk of thrombosis by 64% during the follow-up (p=0.017 confidence intervals 88%-15%) in group B patients. Secondary patency was 80% for VA in which we performed PTA with or without stenting at 18 months, and 58% at 18 months in which we did not perform PTA. Our data show how PTA under CDU is useful to maintain and to improve graft patency. This PTA under CDU guidance allows patients to avoid surgical intervention, hospitalization, and adverse reactions to contrast media and exposure to ionizing radiation, with reduced cost and with better graft survival."

The First American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) Consensus Conference took place in 1985 and, using a systematic approach, provided recommendations for anti-thrombotic therapy based on published studies, and graded those recommendations on the level of clinical evidence. The European Consensus Conference was convened in 1991 to build on this process. During this period, the main developments included the introduction and widespread use of new thromboprophylactic agents such as low-molecular-weight heparins, and improved risk assessment, including an awareness that outpatients and general medical patients may also be at risk. Subsequently, the recommendations have been carefully reviewed and updated by experts who represent the extensive range of opinions in the field. The latest International Consensus Statement was published in 1997, and the most recent ACCP Consensus in 2001 and they provide extensive practice guidelines in the management of venous thromboembolism."

CD008201,0,11484303,0,Outpatient-based treatment protocols in the management of venous thromboembolic disease.,"Clinical trial data are demonstrating that the safety and efficacy of treating deep vein thrombosis (DVT) on an outpatient basis with low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) are equal to inpatient care with unfractionated heparin (UFH). Moreover, LMWH therapy offers multiple advantages, including improved bioavailability at lower doses, reduced heparin resistance, a longer half-life, and potentially, less bleeding. Although these potential advantages are acknowledged, patient selection and risk stratification criteria for patients being considered for LMWH therapy are discussed less frequently; nonetheless, they deserve careful consideration. The protocol utilized by Lovelace Health Systems, a staff model health maintenance organization, features an outpatient-based DVT treatment program that includes exclusionary risk factors for outpatient treatment of venous thromboembolic disease (VTE). Evidence from clinical findings at Lovelace suggests that patients without absolute exclusionary risk factors can successfully be treated with LMWH as outpatients. Specific study results show that 61% of patients were eligible for outpatient therapy and had fewer recurrences of VTE (1.9%) than those comorbid matched patients who were hospitalized with traditional UFH therapy the previous year (4.1%). These findings suggest that LMWH is both safe and efficacious in the home treatment of VTE in a managed care setting when established patient selection criteria and risk stratification strategies are carefully maintained."

CD008201,0,21399956,0,Management of common oncologic emergencies.,"The common oncologic emergencies include Superior Vena Cava Syndrome (SVCS) and Superior Mediastinal Syndrome (SMS), Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS), Hyperleukocytosis and Febrile Neutropenia. SVCS denotes compression, obstruction or thrombosis of SVC and SMS denotes SVCS and tracheal compression. The diagnosis should be established early with minimum invasive techniques. Steroids should be administered immediately. Sedatives are contraindicated. TLS describes the metabolic derangements in various combinations that include hyperuricemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyperkalemia hypocalcemia and uremia which arise from death of and release of contents from tumor cells. Early recognition of patients at risk and initiation of preventive therapy for TLS is essential. Treatment is directed at adequate hydration, use of allopurinol and alkalinization of urine. Hyperluekocytosis is defined as peripheral leukocyte count exceeding 100,000 per microlitre and therapy is tailored at reduction of blood viscosity with hydration, alkalinization of urine allopurinol; chemotherapy should be started once the child is metabolically stable. Febrile neutropenia is a common oncologic emergency directly related to the immune suppression related to cancer treatment. Successful outcome depends on careful evaluation, identification of cause and prompt treatment with antimicrobials (empirical/directed to a specific focus)."

CD008201,0,10494482,0,Screening for activated protein C resistance before oral contraceptive treatment: a pilot study.,"The feasibility and cost-effectiveness of screening women for congenital thrombophilic alterations before oral contraceptive (OC) treatment was investigated. A total of 525 women (mean age 21.9 years, 73% aged < 25 years) were examined before their first OC course. At first screening, completely normal results were recorded in 485 (92.4%) women, the remaining showing single (n = 34) or multiple (n = 6) alterations. At second examination (possible in 37 of 40), activated protein C resistance (APCR) was confirmed in 21 cases (4.0%, 18 with factor V Leiden), protein C, or protein S reduction in 8 (1.5%) and 2 (0.4%) cases, respectively. No cases with antithrombin III deficiency were detected. The global estimated cost ($US) to detect one altered case was: $7795 for protein S, $2696 for antithrombin III (no case found), $1374 for protein C and $433 for APCR. The present study confirms that extensive thrombophilic screening before OC treatment is not currently advisable. APCR assessment, however, seems to have a favorable cost-effectiveness ratio: the alteration is frequent and has a synergistic effect with OC; sensibility and specificity of some methods are good; family history is unreliable to single out possible carriers; finally, carriers can be fully informed of their increased thrombotic risk if treated with OC and can receive thromboprophylaxis during life situations associated with high thrombotic risk (e.g., pregnancy and puerperium)."

CD008201,0,20548800,0,Contemporary treatment of unstable angina and non-ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (part 2).,"In Part 1 of this review, we discussed how plaque rupture is the most common underlying cause of most cases of unstable angina/non-ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (UA/NSTEMI) and how early risk stratification is vital for the timely diagnosis and treatment of acute coronary syndromes (ACS). Now, in Part 2, we focus on the medical therapies and treatment strategies (early conservative vs early invasive) used for UA/NSTEMI. We also discuss results from various large randomized controlled trials that have led to the contemporary standards of practice for, and reduced morbidity and death from, UA/NSTEMI. In summary, ACS involving UA/NSTEMI is associated with high rates of adverse cardiovascular events, despite recent therapeutic advances. Plaque composition and inflammation are more important in the pathogenesis of ACS than is the actual degree of arterial stenosis. As results from new trials challenge our current practices and help us develop the optimal treatment strategy for UA/NSTEMI patients, the cornerstones of contemporary treatment remain early risk stratification and aggressive medical therapy, supplemented by coronary angiography in appropriately selected patients. An early-invasive-treatment strategy is of most benefit to high-risk patients, whereas an early-conservative strategy is recommended for low-risk patients. Adjunctive medical therapy with acetylsalicylic acid, clopidogrel or another adenosine diphosphate antagonist, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors, and either low-molecular-weight heparin or unfractionated heparin, in the appropriate setting, further reduces the risk of ischemic events secondary to thrombosis. Short- and long-term inhibition of platelet aggregation should be achieved by appropriately evaluating the risk of bleeding complications in these patients."

CD008201,0,16817957,0,An update on prevention of venous thromboembolism in hospitalized acutely ill medical patients.,"Both the recently updated consensus guidelines published by the American College of Chest Physicians, and the International Union of Angiology recommend thromboprophylaxis with either low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) or unfractionated heparin (UFH) in medical patients at risk of VTE. However, no guidance is given regarding the appropriate dosing regimens that should be used for thromboprophylaxis in this patient group. LMWH (enoxaparin and dalteparin) and UFH have been shown to be effective for thromboprophylaxis in at-risk hospitalized medical patients. Although LMWH once daily (o.d.) has been shown to be as effective as UFH three times daily (t.i.d.) for thromboprophylaxis in at-risk medical patients, there are no data to show that UFH twice daily (b.i.d) is as effective as either LMWH o.d. or UFH t.i.d. On the basis of currently available evidence, the LMWHs enoxaparin and dalteparin are more attractive alternatives to UFH for the prevention of VTE in hospitalized medical patients because of their convenient once-daily administration and better safety profile, demonstrated in terms of reduced bleeding, HIT, and other adverse events."

CD008201,0,21553780,0,What is the state of the art in orthopaedic thromboprophylaxis in lower extremity reconstruction?,"Venous thromboembolic events, including deep venous thromboses and pulmonary embolisms, have a high risk of occurrence in patients treated with lower extremity arthroplasty and hip fracture surgery. Although the prevalence of these complications has been lowered with the use of venous thromboembolic prophylaxis, the current rate is still troublesome because of the possibility of death or the need for lifetime treatment of postthrombotic syndrome and/or pulmonary hypertension. Prophylactic methods currently include mechanical devices and pharmacologic agents. Mechanical devices are difficult to compare because they are not standardized, the devices are often used in multimodal prophylactic regimens, and the devices cannot be used when the patient is ambulating or at home. A new portable compression device allows use during ambulation and can be used by the patient at home. A recent study of this portable device in patients treated with total hip arthroplasty showed an efficacy similar to that of low-molecular-weight heparin, with fewer major bleeding complications. Pharmacologic prophylaxis includes low-molecular-weight heparin, synthetic pentasaccharide, warfarin, and aspirin. All of these agents have different degrees of efficacy and safety. New oral agents for thromboprophylaxis are on the horizon but are not yet approved by the Food and Drug Administration."

Enoxaparin is a highly effective antithrombotic drug that is well tolerated and without the need for monitoring. Numerous controlled trials in these patient groups have demonstrated enoxaparin to be at least as effective as heparin in reducing the occurrence of deep vein thrombosis while showing a tendency towards lower risk of bleeding complications; therefore, enoxaparin is recommended as thromboprophylaxis in patients undergoing major hip or knee surgery or suffering from multiple trauma."
CD008201,0,7969830,0,Prophylactic vena cava filter insertion in patients with traumatic spinal cord injury: preliminary results.,"Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a devastating complication in patients with traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI). Prophylactic measures such as venous compression hose or low-dose heparin are only partially protective in reducing the risk of venous thromboembolism and are contraindicated in some patients. Because of extended perturbations in fibrinolytic activity, catecholamine effects on platelet aggregation, increased activity of complement and acute phase reactants, abnormally high factor VIII concentrations, and persistent venous stasis with ongoing endothelial damage, the patient with an SCI remains at prolonged risk for venous thromboembolism. A retrospective 5-year review at the Medical Center Hospital of Vermont revealed seven patients with eight documented PEs (three fatal; 2.7%) in 111 SCI patients (6.3%). Six PEs (75%) occurred after discharge from the acute care facility. Median time to PE after injury was 78 days (range, 9-5993). Although comprising only 4% of all trauma admissions, SCI accounted for 31% of all PEs in the total trauma population (2525 patients). Beginning in July 1991, a new prophylaxis protocol was instituted, which included the percutaneous insertion of vena cava filters under local anesthesia in all SCI patients with paraplegia or quadriplegia. Fifteen patients have undergone the insertion of titanium filters. Impedance plethysmography was performed weekly to detect deep venous thrombosis. No complications were associated with vena cava filter insertion. No patients developed deep venous thrombosis during their acute hospitalization (median, 22 d), and no patients have developed PE after filter insertion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

CD008201,0,20497598,0,Preferences in traumatic intracranial hemorrhage: bleeding vs. clotting.,"Patients with traumatic brain injury and resultant intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) are at high risk for developing venous thromboembolism (VTE). The use of thromboprophylaxis is effective at decreasing the rate of VTE, but at the potential expense of an increased risk of ICH progression. Physicians must carefully consider both the benefits and risks of VTE prophylaxis before prescribing chemical anticoagulants to these patients. To help clarify this difficult choice, Scales and colleagues performed a decision analysis to determine whether the benefits of thromboprophylaxis outweigh the potential risk of worsening ICH. There is increasing evidence that bleeding risks are not as prominent as previously thought. Although the results were largely inconclusive, the present study has identified areas for future research."
CD008201,0,25502874,0,Residual platelet reactivity to predict long-term clinical outcomes after clopidogrel loading in patients with acute coronary syndromes: comparison of different cutoff values by light transmission aggregometry from the responsiveness to clopidogrel and stent thrombosis 2-acute coronary syndrome (RECLOSE 2-ACS) study.,"The aim of this study was the identification of the optimal cutoff value of high residual platelet reactivity (HRPR) assessed by light transmission aggregometry (LTA) in the responsiveness to clopidogrel and stent thrombosis 2-acute coronary syndrome (RECLOSE 2-ACS) patient cohort to discriminate patients with and without major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and cardiac death at 2 years. The RECLOSE 2-ACS study included 1,789 patients with ACS who underwent LTA after clopidogrel loading. A post hoc cutoff value for HRPR was defined with the ROC curve and the Youden index and compared with the protocol-defined cutoff of 70 %. By ROC analysis, 63 % resulted the optimal cutoff value to predict both MACE and cardiac death at 2 years follow-up. A significant sensitivity improvement for the ROC-based cutoff value was noted (p < 0.001), at the price of lower specificity and predictive accuracy. The latter were 81 % for MACE and 85 % for cardiac death with the 70 % cutoff, while the respective figures were 73 and 75 % with the 63 % cutoff. The areas under the curve were virtually identical with the 70 and 63 % cutoffs both for MACE (0.71) and cardiac death (0.79). A residual platelet reactivity cutoff of 70 % by LTA, compared to the ROC-based cutoff of 63 %, allows for the identification of a subset of patients at very high risk of adverse ischemic events, making LTA-ADP test more acceptable in clinical practice for the identification of subjects at risk than other platelet function assays with broader definitions of HRPR."
CD008201,0,15383480,0,Antithrombotic therapy in atrial fibrillation: the Seventh ACCP Conference on Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy.,"This chapter about antithrombotic therapy in atrial fibrillation (AF) is part of the Seventh ACCP Conference on Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy: Evidence Based Guidelines. Grade 1 recommendations are strong and indicate that the benefits do, or do not, outweigh risks, burden, and costs. Grade 2 suggests that individual patients' values may lead to different choices (for a full understanding of the grading see Guyatt et al, CHEST 2004; 126:179S-187S). Among the key recommendations in this chapter are the following (all vitamin K antagonist [VKA] recommendations have a target international normalized ratio [INR] of 2.5; range, 2.0 to 3.0): In patients with persistent or paroxysmal AF (PAF) [intermittent AF] at high risk of stroke (ie, having any of the following features: prior ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attack, or systemic embolism, age > 75 years, moderately or severely impaired left ventricular systolic function and/or congestive heart failure, history of hypertension, or diabetes mellitus), we recommend anticoagulation with an oral VKA, such as warfarin (Grade 1A). In patients with persistent AF or PAF, age 65 to 75 years, in the absence of other risk factors, we recommend antithrombotic therapy with either an oral VKA or aspirin, 325 mg/d, in this group of patients who are at intermediate risk of stroke (Grade 1A). In patients with persistent AF or PAF < 65 years old and with no other risk factors, we recommend aspirin, 325 mg/d (Grade 1B). For patients with AF and mitral stenosis, we recommend anticoagulation with an oral VKA (Grade 1C+). For patients with AF and prosthetic heart valves, we recommend anticoagulation with an oral VKA (Grade 1C+); the target INR may be increased and aspirin added depending on valve type and position, and on patient factors. For patients with AF of > or = 48 h or of unknown duration for whom pharmacologic or electrical cardioversion is planned, we recommend anticoagulation with an oral VKA for 3 weeks before and for at least 4 weeks after successful cardioversion (Grade 1C+). For patients with AF of > or = 48 h or of unknown duration undergoing pharmacologic or electrical cardioversion, an alternative strategy is anticoagulation and screening multiplane transesophageal echocardiography (Grade 1B). If no thrombus is seen and cardioversion is successful, we recommend anticoagulation for at least 4 weeks (Grade 1B). For patients with AF of known duration < 48 h, we suggest cardioversion without anticoagulation (Grade 2C). However, in patients without contraindications to anticoagulation, we suggest beginning IV heparin or low molecular weight heparin at presentation (Grade 2C)."

We evaluated the prothrombotic state and anticoagulant intensity of fondaparinux (2.5 mg daily) after total hip replacement (THR). Twenty patients underwent THR - seven bilateral and 13 unilateral. Blood samples were collected preoperatively and at 6 h, 8 h (2 h after fondaparinux), 1 day (12-14 h after fondaparinux), and 4 weeks (12-14 h after fondaparinux) postoperatively. Antithrombin (AT), fibrinogen, factor VIII activity, coagulation times, thrombin-AT (TAT) complex, D-dimer, C-reactive protein, prothrombinase-induced clotting time (PiCT) and anti-Xa activity were measured. The latter two were also tested after plasma spiking with fondaparinux 0-1.25 μg/ml. In spiked prophylactic fondaparinux samples (0-0.25 μg/ml), PiCT and anti-Xa activity correlated (r = 0.84) better than in the patient samples (r = 0.35). On the first day, anti-Xa activity and PiCT dissociated, and PiCT lost sensitivity for fondaparinux. AT decreased but stayed within the normal range, whereas TAT complex and D-dimer peaked at 6 h as signs of thrombin generation. On the first postoperative day, TAT and D-dimer halved. Bilateral THR associated with higher TAT and D-dimer levels up to 4 weeks. Perioperative FVIII levels were not affected, but were elevated in both groups (range 191-211%) after 4 weeks. Anti-Xa activity detected prophylactic fondaparinux with higher sensitivity than PiCT in vitro, but even more so in vivo. Thus, PiCT is not the method of choice to assess fondaparinux at least in association with THR. THR, bilateral more than unilateral, increased thrombin generation and D-dimer 7-11-fold early after surgery. Factor VIII activity and D-dimer remained elevated even after 4 weeks despite the compliant thromboprophylaxis with fondaparinux."

The Brain Trauma Foundation Guidelines (2007) state that low-molecular-weight heparin or unfractionated heparin should be used to prevent VTE complications, but suggest that there is an increased risk of expansion of intracranial hemorrhages (ICH) with VTE prophylaxis. In addition, it is unclear which treatment regimen (i.e., medication, dose, and timing) provides the best risk:benefit ratio in TBI patients. We reviewed all moderate-to-severe TBI patients admitted over a 5-year period to: (1) examine the occurrence of VTEs and their timing; (2) examine the symptomatic expansion of ICH while on VTE prophylaxis; and (3) compare the efficacy of two prophylactic agents: enoxaparin and dalteparin. Two-hundred eighty-seven patients were included. VTE prophylaxis was started 48-72 h post-trauma in all individuals who had no confounding coagulopathy, when two consecutive computed tomography (CT) scans revealed hemorrhage stability. VTEs occurred in 7.3% of treated patients, mostly within 2 weeks after trauma. Proximal VTEs occurred in 3.1% of treated patients. No significant difference in VTE rates was seen between enoxaparin (7.0%) and dalteparin (7.5%; p = 0.868). Moreover, the group treated with dalteparin was more severely injured (higher Injury Severity Score [p = 0.002]), had lower Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores (p = 0.003), and had more inferior vena cava (IVC) filters placed (p = 0.007). The two groups did not show significant differences in the development of VTE when controlled for ISS and IVC filters (p = 0.819). Importantly, only one patient suffered a symptomatic expansion of ICH while on VTE prophylaxis, at 15 days post-trauma. These results suggest that current regimens of VTE prophylaxis used in our TBI population provide a relatively high level of protection against VTEs, and an extremely low risk of expanding ICH. They also suggest that there was no difference in VTE between dalteparin- and enoxaparin-treated patients."

CD008201,0,9284039,0,Atrial fibrillation and stroke: elucidating a newly discovered risk factor.,"Atrial fibrillation is the most common sustained arrhythmia reported in the United States; an estimated 1-2 million Americans have chronic nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. This disorder is associated with a substantial risk of stroke. Several recent studies provide evidence that anticoagulation therapy is indicated for stroke prevention in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation after recovery from a minor stroke. Clinical and echocardiographic criteria help to identify those patients who are at especially high risk for thromboembolic stroke and are candidates for carefully controlled anticoagulation. In an effort to reduce the possibility of thromboembolic events following either chemical or electrical cardioversion, the American College of Chest Physicians has recently prepared guidelines for the use of anticoagulation in the conversion of atrial fibrillation. The efficacy of antiarrhythmic drug therapy for cardioversion is often difficult to assess. Furthermore, it is associated with major risks, including heart failure and exacerbation of arrhythmia, and minor risks, including systemic intolerance. A new National Institutes of Health trial, Atrial Fibrillation Follow-up Investigation of Rhythm Management (AFFIRM), will clarify the true risks and benefits of antiarrhythmic therapy for conversion of atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm. Patients who cannot tolerate drug therapy may benefit from interruption of conduction in the bundle of His, followed by implantation of a permanent pacemaker, the use of radiofrequency energy ablation, or the implantation of an atrial defibrillator. Some patients may benefit from surgical procedures, such as left atrial isolation, the corridor operation, and the maze operation."

Our prospective study enrolled 395 hospitalized cases with neuroepithelial tumors. All cases underwent measurement of serum D-dimer concentration and neurological examination on admission. Serum D-dimer concentration was measured on days 1, 3, and 7 after surgery and weekly during follow up in patients who underwent surgery, and once a week during follow up in patients without surgery. Fourteen clinical parameters were evaluated as indicators of VTE, and among them, age, body-mass index, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, corticosteroid usage, pretreatment serum D-dimer concentration, paresis of the lower extremity (manual muscle test: MMT), performance status, and World Health Organization grade of the tumor achieved statistical significance. Multivariable logistic regression analysis demonstrated age >65 years, corticosteroid usage, paresis of the lower extremity, and serum D-dimer concentration over 1.0 mg/dl were independent factors. Total risk score was defined as the total of the scores for risk factors assigned based on the adjusted odds ratio: pretreatment serum D-dimer concentration over 1.0 mg/dl (2 points), and age over 65 years old, paresis of the lower extremity of MMT ≤2, and corticosteroid usage (1 point each). Rates of VTE were 2.0% in the low risk (total score 0 or 1), 14.8% in the intermediate risk (total score 2 or 3), and 51.9% in the high risk groups (total score = 4 or 5).

The concern regarding prolonged antiplatelet therapy is the increased risk of bleeding. Gastrointestinal bleeding is the most common site of bleeding and presents a serious threat to patients due to the competing risks of gastrointestinal hemorrhage and stent thrombosis. Currently, there are no guidelines and little evidence on how best to manage these patients who are at high risk of morbidity and mortality from both the bleeding itself and the consequences of achieving optimum hemostasis by interruption of antiplatelet therapy. Managing gastrointestinal bleeding in a patient who has undergone recent percutaneous coronary intervention requires balancing the risk of stent thrombosis against further catastrophic bleeding. Close combined management between gastroenterologist and cardiologist is advocated to optimize patient outcomes."
CD008201,0,26167970,0,[Treatment and diagnosis of pulmonary embolism in pregnancy].,"When occurring during pregnancy, venous thrombo-embolism is a major cause of maternal mortality. The risk is highest in the third trimester of pregnancy and over the 6 weeks of the postpartum period. Exposure of the foetus to ionizing radiation is a concern when investigating suspected PE during pregnancy; although this concern is largely overruled by the hazards of missing a potentially fatal diagnosis. This is particularly true for pregnant patients with suspected high risk. A normal D-dimer value has the same exclusion value for PE in pregnant women as for other patients with suspected PE but is found more rarely, because plasma D-dimer levels physiologically increase throughout pregnancy. In pregnant women with suspected PE and signs and symptoms of DVT, guidelines suggest performing bilateral compression ultrasound of lower extremities. Use of lung scintigraphy as the preferred test in the setting of a normal CXR. The treatment of PE in pregnancy is based on heparin anticoagulation. Increasing experience suggests that LMWHs are safe in pregnancy, and their use is endorsed in several reports. Treatment should consist of a weight-adjusted dose of LMWH."

As in surgical patients, risk factors and high- and low-risk groups have been identified, but no useful risk assessment models (RAMs) have yet been developed for medical patients. The incidence of VTE varies widely, but a history of previous VTE, age greater than 40 years, obesity, and prolonged immobilization are all associated with an increase In risk. Stroke, spinal cord injury, and cancer patients are at particular risk of VTE. Low-dose unfractionated heparin (UFH), low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs), antiplatelet agents, and warfarin reduce the incidence of VTE. Current standards of thromboprophylaxis vary with indication. However, utilization is frequently low, even in high-risk patients.

Some chemotherapeutic agents used for cancer may induce thrombosis but their biological alterations in the hemostatic system are not yet well understood. This study evaluated alterations of coagulative and fibrinolytic parameters following chemotherapy. In plasma samples of 38 patients (median age: 49 years) receiving CMF (schedule 1-21 or 1-8) for Stage II breast cancer, we evaluated: PT, aPTT, antithrombin III (AT-III), protein C (PC), protein S (PS), thrombin-antithrombin complex (TAT), prothrombin fragment F 1 + 2 (F 1 + 2), fibrinogen (Fbg), tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA), plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) and D-dimer (D-D). PT, aPTT, and Fbg were determined with routine methods; AT-III, PC, and PS were measured with coagulative tests; PC and PS were also evaluated with immunoenzymatic methods, t-PA, PAI-1, D-D, TAT, and F 1 + 2 were measured with immunoenzymatic methods. All tests were performed immediately before starting therapy and after each cycle. A PC antigen decrease appeared soon after beginning therapy and lasted throughout chemotherapy. The lowest values were present after the first treatment both in the CMF 1-21 group (mean +/- SD = 72.5 +/- 10.8%) and in the CMF 1-8 group (mean +/- SD = 77.2 +/- 6.9%): PC activity was also decreased. PS antigen decreased after the first administration (mean +/- SD = 73.3 +/- 10% in CMF 1-21 group, and 72.5 +/- 4.9% in CMF 1-8 group): PS activity also decreased. PAI-1 antigen levels increased (mean +/- SD = 43.1 +/- 20.4 ng/ml in the CMF 1-21 group, and 37.5 +/- 12.2 ng/ml in CMF 1-8 group) lasting up to the last cycle.

CD008201,0,23510827,0,Morbus diureticus in the elderly: epidemic overuse of a widely applied group of drugs.,"Diuretics (thiazides, loop diuretics) are established as treatments of common diseases: arterial hypertension, heart failure, and renal disease. In aging societies, their prevalence sharply rises with age. Thus, diuretic efficacy and safety need to be considered in the elderly as main consumers. Diuretics expose several disadvantages with particular relevance for the elderly. The most acknowledged side effects concern electrolyte disturbances. Hypokalemia (up to 8%) may not only precipitate cardiac arrhythmias and related sudden death but also adynamia by muscular weakness. Hyponatremia (up to 17%) may contribute to confusion, delirium, and irreversible brain damage adding to age-related dementia. Thiazides are the antihypertensive drugs with the strongest diabetogenic activity. In heart failure treatment, overdosing of diuretics is common, as doses often reflect requirements for acute recompensation, which is two- to threefold the requirement of that in maintenance therapy. Trial data demonstrate a positive correlation between mortality and diuretic use/dose, which may also be related to volume contraction, related ACE-inhibitor intolerance, renal impairment, and venous thromboembolism. Combining loop and thiazide diuretics may be indicated for severe cardiac or renal failure, but it is also excessively used in less severe stages, causing an even more severe threat to patients; thiazides are often added unintentionally if overlooked in combination pills. Diuretics may be used to treat peripheral ""edema"" in obese patients, patients on calcium antagonists, or those with venous thrombotic disease. Here they are not indicated and may even induce edema. In statistics on adverse drug reactions leading to hospitalization, diuretics are among the 5 leading drug classes. Misleading interpretations of clinical trials and their low cost have pushed them into the front position of hypertension treatment. Here, side effects, including the urge of voiding, lead to the lowest adherence rate among first-line antihypertensives. It is proposed to term the syndrome of inappropriate diuretic application ""morbus diureticus."" It should be diagnosed by history taking, force assessment (timed-up-and-go, chair-rise tests), clinical hydration assessment, and laboratory tests (electrolytes, creatinine). In heart failure, dose reductions/step-down from loop to thiazide diuretics should be tested routinely at 3- to 6-month intervals. In hypertension treatment, diuretics should be third in line if control by RAS inhibitors and long-acting dihydropyridine calcium antagonists is insufficient. If symptoms improve after diuretic step-down (including improved tolerance to RAS inhibitors or renal function), this diagnosis may also be made ""ex juvantibus."""

Since decades, vitamin K antagonists (VKA) were the only available oral anticoagulants. Even though VKA are very effective, they have numerous practical problems: Due to their narrow therapeutic window, highly variable dose requirements and drug interactions, close monitoring is mandatory, aiming towards an INR of 2-3 for most indications. At present, new oral anticoagulants are being studied, such as the oral direct thrombin inhibitor Ximelagatran, which in trials for prevention and treatment of VTE appears at least equivalent to heparin and VKA. Heparins have to be administered parenterally, and low molecular-weight heparins have been able to overcome some of the shortcomings of standard heparins, such as limited bioavailability, variable dose response and heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Heparinoids and hirudins are alternative anticoagulants to treat HIT. With the development of synthetic pentasaccharides, such as Fondaparinux an increase in efficacy could be achieved in high-risk thromboprophylaxis."

Oral administration of ibuprofen (75 or 175 mg/kg in divided doses) prevented occlusive LCX thrombosis. Compared to controls, oral ibuprofen treatment resulted in a significant reduction in developed LCX thrombus mass (20 +/0 2 mg vs. 10 +/- 0.3 mg wet weight, P < .005) and left ventricular infarct mass (24 +/- 4% vs. 1 +/- 0.5%, P < .005). Scanning electron microscopy of the luminal surface of the LCX revealed minimal platelet adherence on the damaged intima in ibuprofen-treated animals. In a separate series of experiments, intervention with oral ibuprofen (12.5 mg/kg every 4 hr) reduced the extent of myocardial ischemic injury resulting from 60 min of complete LCX occlusion followed by reperfusion, whether assessed on the basis of the total left ventricular mass (18 +/- 2% vs. 9 +/- 3%, P < .02) or the area at risk (50 +/- 7% vs. 20 +/- 3%, P < .02).

Pathogenesis of blood clotting activation in these diseases is multifactorial, and it involves various abnormalities of platelets, erythrocytes, and leukocytes, as well as dysfunctions of endothelial cells. These include not only elevations in the counts of circulating blood cells, arising from the clonal proliferation of hematopoietic progenitor cells, but also modifications of several physiological/molecular properties. Patients with MPN can be stratified in ""high-risk"" or ""low-risk"" thrombotic categories according to the age and history of thrombosis. The most commonly used front-line drugs for the treatment of high-risk patients include hydroxyurea and interferon alpha, whereas in low-risk patients, primary antithrombotic prophylaxis with aspirin is used. Future research should be focused on the evaluation of the role of biomarkers in identifying MPN patients at higher risk of thrombosis, who may benefit from primary thromboprophylaxis. Finally, a better understanding of the molecular events leading to the progress of the hypercoagulable state in MPN patients may provide appropriate tools for the development of targeted therapies based on reversal of coagulopathy."
CD008201,0,21553280,0,Standard or extended-duration prophylaxis in medical patients? A review of the evidence.,"Acutely ill medical patients are at significant risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Thromboprophylaxis can substantially reduce the incidence of VTE, but to be optimally effective must consist of the correct choice of agent, at an appropriate dose, and for sufficient duration. Increasing evidence suggests that VTE risk persists beyond the standard period of prophylaxis. Although there is evidence that extended-duration prophylaxis is beneficial in preventing late VTE complications in high-risk surgical patients, few data exist in medical patients. The recent EXCLAIM study demonstrated that, subsequent to a standard prophylaxis regimen of 10 ± 4 days with enoxaparin 40 mg once daily, extended-duration prophylaxis (28 ± 4 days) with enoxaparin reduced total VTE events compared with placebo: 2.5% versus 4.0%; (absolute risk difference -1.53%; 95.8% confidence interval [CI] -2.54 to -0.52), with parallel increases in major bleeding rates (0.8% vs. 0.3%; absolute risk difference 0.51%; 95% CI 0.12-0.89%). The reduction in total VTE was principally driven by a decrease in symptomatic deep-vein thrombosis (absolute risk difference -0.60%; 95.8% CI -1.00 to -0.19%). Favorable benefit-to-risk ratios were observed in certain high-risk patient groups: level 1 immobility, women, and age >75 years. In addition to their underlying medical condition, medical patients often have multiple risk factors, placing them at sustained risk of VTE. Extended-duration prophylaxis might be most relevant in such patients. The development of appropriate risk assessment tools could help identify medical patients at greatest risk of late VTE events who might benefit most from extended-duration prophylaxis."

Results from recent clinical trials of antiplatelet medications, given alone or in combination, may be of special interest to cardiologists. The MATCH study demonstrated no significant difference between clopidogrel alone and clopidogrel plus aspirin in reducing risk of vascular events after stroke or transient ischemic attack. A 1.3% increased risk of major bleeding was associated with clopidogrel plus aspirin. In CHARISMA, clopidogrel plus aspirin did not reach statistical significance vs. placebo plus aspirin in reducing incidence of myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes in patients with stable atherothrombotic disease; clopidogrel was associated with an increase in moderate bleeding. These results suggest that clopidogrel plus aspirin may be inappropriate as first-line therapy for secondary stroke prevention. In patients with established cardiovascular disease at risk for MI or other vascular events, physicians must weigh the benefits and risks before choosing this therapy. Selection of an antiplatelet agent must be based on patient history, including previous MI and stroke, susceptibility to bleeding, and other high-risk factors (e.g. advanced age and diabetes). Aspirin plus extended-release dipyridamole may be more effective than clopidogrel for preventing stroke in high-risk patients. This article strives to put MATCH and CHARISMA results into context by providing an overview of antiplatelet therapy, including relevant clinical trial results, a review of current practice guidelines, and a summary of an ongoing study that will improve clinical decision making."

However, there are some studies that suggest continuing warfarin may be safe. The study by Birnie et al. investigates this important clinical question in a randomized controlled trial setting. They randomly assigned 681 patients with high thrombotic risk (5% or more per year), in 18 centers, to receive either stopping warfarin combined with heparin bridging (standard of care) or continued uninterrupted warfarin therapy for cardiac rhythm device surgery. The trial was terminated after a second prespecified interim analysis by the data and safety monitoring board. Clinically significant device-pocket hematoma was noted in 12 out of 343 patients (3.5%) in the uninterrupted warfarin group, compared with 54 out of 338 (16.0%) in the heparin-bridging group (relative risk: 0.19; 95% CI: 0.10-0.36; p < 0.001). Uninterrupted warfarin was associated with better patient satisfaction, and there was no significant difference in thromboembolic or surgical complications between the two groups. These results demonstrate that device surgeries can be safely performed with continued warfarin, and bridging with heparin is associated with high risk of device-pocket hematoma."

CD008201,0,23683384,0,Prediction of postdischarge venous thromboembolism using a risk assessment model.,The risk of postdischarge venous thromboembolism (VTE) (either deep vein or pulmonary embolism) is increasingly recognized yet the prescription of postdischarge thromboprophylaxis is inconsistent. There is a paucity of information to aid clinicians in identifying surgical patients who are at increased risk for postdischarge VTE. This study aimed to determine the incidence and risk factors associated with symptomatic postdischarge VTE and develop a risk score to identify patients who may benefit from extended duration thromboprophylaxis.
CD008201,0,24686103,0,Impact of the national venous thromboembolism risk assessment tool in secondary care in England: retrospective population-based database study.,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common and important cause of death in hospital patients. We therefore investigated possible associations between the introduction of the compulsory national VTE risk assessment tool in England in 2010 and patient outcomes. A retrospective database study, using data from the Health and Social Care Information Centre and Office of National Statistics, was undertaken. The main outcome measures were VTE-related secondary diagnosis rates, 30-day and 90-day readmission rates and mortality rates. The observed mean VTE-related secondary diagnosis rate for 2011-2012 was 91% of the rate estimated from a linear regression model of the data for 2006-2007 to 2010-2011 (P = 0.001). Similarly, the observed mean 30-day VTE-related readmission rate for 2011 was 96% of the estimated rate (P = 0.067) and the observed mean 90-day VTE-related readmission rate for 2011 was 96% of the estimated rate (P = 0.022). The observed annual VTE-related national mortality rate was 91% of the estimated rate for 2011 and 92% of the estimated rate for 2012. This study shows a reduction in VTE-related secondary diagnoses and readmissions among adults admitted to hospital, and a reduction in VTE-related population mortality, since the introduction of a national VTE risk assessment screening tool in England. Despite some study limitations, this suggests that the concerted effort made by NHS England to improve prevention of hospital-acquired VTE has been successful."
CD008201,0,2508536,0,Antiphospholipid antibodies.,"Lupus anticoagulants and anticardiolipin antibodies, known collectively as antiphospholipid antibodies, are becoming established as markers for increased risk of thrombosis, including ischemic cerebrovascular disease. In this brief review, we highlight evidence for and against a pathogenetic role of these antibodies in ischemic brain disease and comment on currently available laboratory studies to detect them. Future research on the association of antiphospholipid antibodies with neurological disease should focus on establishing the pathogenicity of these antibodies, identifying groups at high risk for recurrent ischemic cerebrovascular events, and initiating prospective multicenter natural history and treatment protocols."
CD008201,0,15751368,0,Patient compliance with outpatient prophylaxis: an observational study.,"The need for prophylaxis against venous thromboembolic disease following lower-extremity joint replacement is well documented and accepted. Although low molecular weight heparin is approved for inpatient and extended prophylaxis beyond the hospital environment, orthopedic surgeons must determine the duration of injectable low molecular weight heparin based on the period of venous thromboembolic disease risk and on patient compliance with self-administration of medication at home. Lack of confidence in patients' ability to self-administer injections may contribute to hesitancy in prescribing injectable prophylaxis. This observational study evaluated the effectiveness of a self-injection education program. Findings demonstrate that when properly instructed, patients safely and efficaciously self-administer low molecular weight heparin at home. With shorter hospital stays, self-administration of low molecular weight heparin may optimize the clinical outcomes of orthopedic patients."

CD008201,0,23454032,0,Evaluation of a policy of selective drug-eluting stent implantation for patients at high risk of restenosis.,"Drug-eluting stent (DES) deployment during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has reduced target-vessel revascularisation rates (TVR). The selective use of DES in patients at highest risk of restenosis may allay concerns about universal compliance of dual antiplatelet therapy for one year, and potentially reduce costs. If this strategy achieved acceptably low TVR rates, such an approach could be attractive. Late clinical outcomes were examined in 2115 consecutive patients (mean age 63±12 years, 75% male, 22% diabetics) who underwent PCI in the first three years from October 2003, after commencing the following selective criteria for DES use: left main stenosis; ostial lesions of major epicardial arteries; proximal LAD lesions; lesions≥20mm in length with vessel diameter≤3.0mm; lesions in vessels≤2.5mm; diabetics with vessel(s)≤3.0mm; and in-stent restenosis. Among patients undergoing PCI, 2075 (98%) patients received stents (29%≥1 DES and 71% bare metal stent [BMS]), and among those who received DES, there was a 92% compliance with these criteria. There were no differences in clinical outcomes between the two stent groups except for definite stent thrombosis, which occurred in 2% after DES, and 0.6% after BMS at one year (p=0.002). With BMS, large coronary arteries (≥3.5mm), intermediate (3-3.49mm) and small arteries (<3mm) in diameter had a TVR rate at one year of 3.6%, 7.2% and 8.2% respectively (p=0.005). It is possible to use selective criteria for DES while maintaining low TVR rates. The TVR rate with BMS was low in those with stent diameters≥3.5mm. The higher DES stent thrombosis rate reflects first generation DES use, though whether routine second generation DES use reduces these rates needs confirmation."

CD008201,0,23951977,0,Implementation of thromboprophylaxis guidelines.,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) remains one of the leading direct causes of maternal death. Risk factors for VTE and prophylaxis guidelines have been highlighted by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG). A cross sectional study was completed in Cork University Maternity Hospital (CUMH) to determine pattern of VTE risk and compliance with 2004 RCOG guidelines. 364 women's charts were reviewed. Forty percent (n = 145) were at risk for VTE, 69% (n = 100) of these received thromboprophylaxis but only 54% (n = 54) received the correct weight adjusted dose. Three of four morbidly obese women in this study received recommended thromboprophylaxis but none at the appropriate dose. Only 67% (n = 245) had a recorded body mass index (BMI). Increased BMI is a significant risk factor for VTE and should be measured and recorded at the booking visit. Awareness of the risks for VTE and the need for appropriate dosing should be improved."

CD008201,0,21951830,0,Clinicians adopting evidence based guidelines: a case study with thromboprophylaxis.,Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) is a cause of hospital mortality and managing its morbidity is associated with significant expenditure. Uptake of evidenced based guideline recommendations intended to prevent VTE in hospital settings is sub-optimal. This study was conducted to explore clinicians' attitudes and the clinical environment in which they work to understand their reluctance to adopt VTE prophylaxis guidelines.
CD008201,0,24519568,0,Prophylaxis for venous thromboembolic disease in pregnancy and the early postnatal period.,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE), although rare, is a major cause of maternal mortality and morbidity, and methods of prophylaxis are therefore often used for women considered to be at risk. This may include women who have given birth by caesarean section, those with a personal or family history of VTE and women with inherited or acquired thrombophilias (conditions that predispose people to thrombosis). Many methods of prophylaxis carry risks of adverse effects, and as the risk of VTE is often low, it is possible that the benefits of thromboprophylaxis may be outweighed by harms. Guidelines for clinical practice have been based on expert opinion rather than high-quality evidence from randomised trials."
CD008201,0,20204827,0,Safer surgery using zymogen protein C concentrate.,"This is the first case (November 12, 2007) of peri-operative use of zymogen protein C (ZPC) for a heterozygote Protein C deficient (50%) patient with heterozygosity for the prothrombin gene mutation. The surgery involved total left hip replacement. The patient was 74 years of age and at very high-risk for Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) thus possible lung emboli. He was a survivor of Venous thrombo-embolism (VTE) in 1999.For this case the need for increased heparin to prevent a reoccurrence of thrombosis led to a further concern of internal bleeding and possible infection. As proposed by the authors in previous publications the use of a ZPC concentrate would decrease the chance of a thrombosis, with minimum or no internal bleeding. ZPC is activated at the endothelium cell surface and on the surface of the platelets where and when it is needed, therefore providing a safer procedure.This protocol was implemented by administering ZPC concentrate 1 day prior to surgery and continuing for 10 days after. Slightly higher than normal blood loss occurred, however, a safe procedure was achieved without dangerous side effects while several additional benefits were experienced (level of PC activity as high as 235% above normal were measured during the procedure.). It is felt that positive effects were the result of increased blood flow and oxygen transport to the tissues by reducing blood sludging in the microcirculation. Further studies on Protein C dose levels will be necessary to provide economical, safe and efficacious use of Protein C products.It is suggested that ZPC should be considered for patients with high probability of VTE which could cause thrombotic occlusion of the pulmonary and peripheral vasculature. These phenomena can result in hypoxia and hypo perfusion causing organ failure and death.Our research includes a focused effort to optimize upstream and downstream bio-processing to produce both zymogen and activated Protein C at a lower cost and to examine the medical indications that could benefit from a more available and affordable Protein C product."
CD008201,0,16978036,0,Cardiovascular health and aromatase inhibitors.,"Cardiovascular disease is the most frequent cause of death in North American women, and so death resulting from cardiovascular disease, rather than from malignancy, is not uncommon in breast cancer patients. This may be a consequence of the shared risk factors for developing breast cancer and cardiovascular disease, as well as the difficulty of managing cancer patients at higher risk for developing cardiovascular disease. Recently, much attention has focused on understanding the cardiovascular risk factors associated with breast cancer therapies. Tamoxifen has a lowering effect on serum lipids and is reported to decrease the risk of myocardial infarction but to increase the risk of thromboembolic events. Current data indicate that aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are not associated with an increased risk of thromboembolic or cerebrovascular events. Reports of a greater incidence of hypercholesterolaemia when AIs are compared head-to-head with tamoxifen may be a result of the intrinsic lipid-lowering effects of tamoxifen therapy and may be confounded by differences in data collection among trials. The incidence of cardiovascular events associated with AIs in large trials has been reported to be higher in trials comparing AIs with tamoxifen; comparisons within the MA.17 trial, which evaluated an AI versus placebo, did not show increases in hypercholesterolaemia or in cardiovascular events with the AI. When treating breast cancer patients, oncologists should consider the same positive lifestyle changes that are proposed to lower the risk of cardiovascular disease in patients who do not have breast cancer. Moreover, physicians should assess cardiovascular risk, and monitor and treat patients already diagnosed with or at risk for coronary heart disease, according to established guidelines."

CD008201,0,25669625,0,Implementation of a Hemostatic and Antithrombotic Stewardship program.,"Hemostatic and antithrombotic (HAT) agents are high risk, high cost products. They require close monitoring and dose titration to adequately treat or prevent thrombosis while avoiding bleeding events. Incorporating the principles of inpatient anticoagulation management service into a stewardship program not only improves outcomes and decreases cost, but also improves transitions of care, exposes gaps in therapy management, and leads to the development of institution specific protocols and guidelines. We implemented a HAT Stewardship to provide real time clinical surveillance and management of these agents in an effort to optimize appropriate use, decrease serious adverse events, and minimize costs. The stewardship is staffed daily by an interdisciplinary team comprised of a pharmacist, hematology attending, and medical director. The stewardship focuses on (1) management of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), (2) management of patients with Hemophilia A/B with inhibitors and acquired Factor VIII deficiency due to inhibitors, (3) oversight of anticoagulation in patients on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and (4) assistance with anticoagulation management for patients with mechanical cardiac assist devices. Through implementation of this service, we have been able to demonstrate improved patient care and a positive economic impact exceeding the cost of this program by almost sixfold. Other centers should consider instituting a HAT Stewardship to maximize patient outcomes and minimize adverse events."

CD008201,0,10348713,0,APC-resistance is a risk factor for postoperative thromboembolism in elective replacement of the hip or knee--a prospective study.,"Postoperative venous thromboembolic complications are commonly seen after total replacement of the hip or knee. Recently, an inherited defect with resistance to the anticoagulant activity of activated protein C (APC-resistance) has been detected. APC-resistance seems to be a common risk factor, especially in Sweden, and it increases the propensity for venous thrombosis. This study assesses the prevalence of APC-resistance in a general population and its clinical significance for patients undergoing surgery associated with a high risk of thromboembolic complications. In a prospective cohort study, we analysed for APC-resistance in 645 consecutive patients before elective replacement of the hip or knee at 3 hospitals in southern Sweden. Thromboprophylaxis with LMWH-heparin was given to all patients throughout the hospitalisation period. We recorded events of clinical thromboembolism for 3 months postoperatively. Venography, ultrasonography or pulmonary scintigraphy was requested by the clinicians according to the existing routines, i.e. only patients with symptoms of thromboembolism were examined. A thromboembolic complication was registered in 20 (3.1%) patients. Fifty per cent of the venous thrombi had a proximal location. Only 0.3% of the patients had verified pulmonary embolism. APC-resistance was found in 14.1% of the patients, of whom 9.9% had experienced postoperative thromboembolism compared with 2.0% of the patients without APC-resistance (p<0.0007). We conclude that APC-resistance is a frequent risk factor for symptomatic postoperative deep venous thrombosis with an estimated relative risk of 5.0 (95% confidence interval: from 1.9 to 12.9) in elective replacement of the hip or knee."
CD008201,0,26356085,0,Drug delivery and therapeutic impact of extended-release acetylsalicylic acid.,"Current treatment guidelines recommend once-daily, low-dose acetylsalicylic acid (ASA; aspirin) for secondary prevention of cardiovascular events. However, the anti-thrombotic benefits of traditional ASA formulations may not extend over a 24-h period, especially in patients at high risk for a recurrent cardiovascular event. A next-generation, extended-release ASA formulation (ER-ASA) has been developed to provide 24-h anti-thrombotic coverage with once-daily dosing. The pharmacokinetics of ER-ASA indicates slower absorption and prolonged ASA release versus immediate-release ASA, with a favorable safety profile. ER-ASA minimizes systemic ASA absorption and provides sustained antiplatelet effects over a 24-h period."
CD008201,0,23218627,0,Intermittent pneumatic compression for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in total knee arthroplasty.,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is controversial. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of bilateral intra- and postoperative intermittent pneumatic compression without major anticoagulation as prophylaxis for VTE in TKA.This retrospective study involved 157 consecutive patients undergoing TKA performed by 1 surgeon who were treated with bilateral intra- and postoperative intermittent pneumatic compression stockings. All patients were followed for at least 6 weeks postoperatively. Postoperative color duplex ultrasound imaging with compression by certified vascular technologists was obtained for 120 patients 2 to 3 days postoperatively. During hospitalization, 2 (1.7%) patients had acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT) diagnosed, 2 (1.7%) had DVT of indeterminate age, and 4 (3.3%) had chronic DVT. During follow-up, 1 (0.8%) patient had an acute DVT diagnosed at 5 weeks postoperatively and 1 (0.8%) had a superficial phlebitis and subsequently had a nonfatal pulmonary embolism 23 days postoperatively. The predominant chemoprophylaxis used was aspirin alone in 107 (89.2%) patients. Epidural anesthesia was used in the majority (n=96; 80%) of patients.The results of this study support the use of a multimodal approach to VTE prophylaxis in TKA, using bilateral intra- and postoperative intermittent pneumatic compression, epidural anesthesia, early mobilization, and postoperative aspirin without the use of major anticoagulation as an effective, safe VTE prophylactic protocol for patients undergoing elective TKA. The study suggests that the protocol is highly effective, has low morbidity, and is cost effective."

CD008201,0,15176958,0,Liver transplantation in infants weighing under 7 kilograms: management and outcome of PICU.,"Liver transplantation (LT) is an established treatment for children with acute and chronic liver failure. Some reports suggest that infants under the age of 1 yr and children weighing under 13 kg are high-risk groups associated with less satisfactory results. This report describes our experience during the pediatric intensive care unit stay of 16 infants weighing <7 kg who received LT. We reviewed the records of 16 infants with median age 7.4 months and median weight 5.8 kg, who received 18 liver allografts, nine whole and nine reduced. We also reviewed the use of adrenergic agonist agents, anti-infectious agents, antihypertensive agents, diuretics, immunosuppression protocol, sedation-analgesia agents, others agents (prostaglandin E(1), heparin and dipyridamole), diagnosis and management of rejection episodes, follow-up examination, nutrition and outcome. Mean peri-operative blood transfusions were 204 mL/kg, 188 mL/kg of plasma and 36 mL/kg of platelets; mean operative time was 5 h. Primary abdominal wound closure was possible in nine patients. Median initial intensive care unit stay was 18 days. Reasons for an initial stay of more than 18 days were retransplantation (1), gastrointestinal bleeding (2), paralytic ileus and atelectasis (2), septic shock (2), diaphragmatic paralysis, renal impairment and acute respiratory distress syndrome (2). Mean requirement for artificial ventilation was 168 h. Mean use of dobutamine, prostaglandin E(1) and dopamine was 3.3, 7.5 and 8.8 days, respectively. Parenteral nutrition was started at a mean of 48 h and oral food intake was started at a mean of 72 h. The most frequent complications were infection, atelectasis, gastrointestinal bleeding, acute renal failure and hepatic artery thrombosis. Four children required six re-explorations and two received retransplantation. Mean overall survival rate was 82% and graft survival was 72%. Weight alone (under 7 kg) should not be considered as a contraindication for LT. The survival rate of children post-LT is excellent regardless of graft type."
CD008201,0,23089110,0,[Venous thromboembolism prevention in non-surgical adult patients admitted in a general hospital].,"Adult patients hospitalized for a non-surgical condition, usually have a high risk of venous thromboembolism and may develop some form of this disease when they do not receive appropriate preventive treatment. The objectives of this prospective, analytical, observational and cross-sectional study were: 1) to determine what percentage of adult patients hospitalized for a non-surgical acute condition at the Hospital de Clínicas José de San Martín, Universidad de Buenos Aires, had indication for preventive thromboprophylaxis, 2) to establish how many of them had been prescribed a preventive treatment of venous thromboembolism, 3) to establish how many of them had been prescribed a preventive treatment of venous thromboembolism without having reasons to justify the treatment. The study was performed on 93 patients for 72 consecutive hours. It resulted in 90.3% in need of preventive treatment for venous thromboembolism and 76.2% of these patients had received pharmacological thromboprophylaxis. A 33.3% of the studied patients had received preventive pharmacological treatment without having a proper indication. In this study, the percentage of patients treated is higher than in those reported in other published observational studies."

CD008201,0,16476626,0,Current status of carotid artery stenting.,"This Clinical Update summarizes the results of larger case series, industry-sponsored registries, and randomized trials of carotid artery stenting (CAS). In >20 case series that studied >24,000 patients undergoing CAS, 51% of patients were symptomatic, most procedures (97%) resulted in successful stent deployment, and 30-day stroke rates varied from 1% to 8%, with a trend toward lower rates as experience and embolic protection device (EPD) use increased. In 12 industry-sponsored registries (none were published in peer-reviewed journals), 30-day stroke rates varied from 2% to 7%, and 30-day combined adverse events, including stroke, death, and myocardial infarction, were 3% to 9%. More than 12 randomized trials comparing CAS and carotid endarterectomy (CEA) have been initiated since 1998. Results have varied over time, depending on the population studied and the technology used. However, the largest and most recent results of the completed SAPPHIRE trial in high-risk patients undergoing CAS with the use of EPDs demonstrated that CAS is at least not inferior to CEA, with a 1-year combined adverse event rate of 12% for CAS and 20% for CEA (P = .05). Other ongoing trials will address not only whether CAS could be superior to CEA in high-risk patients but also, more importantly, whether CAS is beneficial in other subgroups, such as low-risk and asymptomatic patients."

CD008201,0,24599438,0,Risk assessment for thrombosis in cancer.,"Patients with active malignancy are well-known to be at higher risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE). However, the risk of VTE varies considerably between patients and in the same patient over the natural history of their malignancy. Multiple clinical risk factors including primary site of cancer, use of systemic therapy including novel targeted agents, surgery, and hospitalization are known to increase the risk of VTE. Multiple candidate biomarkers including tissue factor, D-dimer, and soluble P-selectin have been identified. However, risk cannot be reliably predicted based on single risk factors or biomarkers. A risk assessment score has been validated in multiple populations and can identify patients at high risk for cancer-associated VTE. This review discusses the risk factors, predictive biomarkers, and new guidelines, which recommend risk assessment of VTE for all cancer patients. Potential applications of risk assessment, including targeted thromboprophylaxis, are also identified in this review."
CD008201,0,10493226,0,Limitations of established antithrombotic strategies.,"The incidence of venous thromboembolism has declined in recent years, probably due to the successful use of prophylactic strategies. However, pulmonary embolism remains the most common preventable cause of hospital death in industrialized countries. A number of clinical studies have shown that when used appropriately current antithrombotic therapies, such as unfractionated heparin, oral anticoagulants and low-molecular-weight heparins, are effective in preventing thromboembolic events in the majority of patients. However, surveillance data indicate that in certain high-risk clinical settings a significant proportion of patients still develop deep vein thrombosis despite use of the most effective prophylaxis methods currently available. Currently available antithrombotic therapies are also associated with a risk of treatment-specific adverse effects and various practical limitations which restrict their clinical benefit and influence cost-effectiveness. Risk of bleeding, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, and drug interactions are the most important safety concerns. The need for inconvenient and costly dose adjustment and laboratory monitoring, intravenous or subcutaneous administration, and restrictions on methods of anaesthesia are key practical drawbacks. This paper reviews clinical and practical aspects of existing therapeutic options and develops a profile for the ideal thromboprophylactic agent. The direction of current research into the development of improved prophylactic modalities designed to overcome existing limitations is briefly discussed."

There are a number of pathophysiologic mechanisms for venous thromboembolism that are specific to patients with IBD that may be active. The use of anticoagulants for prophylaxis against venous thromboembolism in hospitalized patients with IBD needs to be balanced against the potential for worsening of rectal bleeding. Evidence from randomized trials suggests that heparin and low-molecular weight heparin are generally safe to use in patients with active IBD, and a number of guidelines support their use for thromboprophylaxis in this patient population."

To predict which patients are at greatest risk for thromboembolic stroke, numerous risk stratification schemas have been developed to guide thromboprophylactic treatment decisions. The well-known CHADS(2) scoring system incorporates risk factors such as congestive heart failure, hypertension, age 75 years or older, diabetes mellitus, and previous stroke or transient ischemic attack. Recently, a novel risk stratification model, CHA2DS2 -VASc, has entered the literature and international guidelines, prompting further review of newly added risk factors-age 65-74 years, presence of vascular disease, and female sex-and the increased allotment of 2 points (vs 1 point in CHADS2) for age 75 years or older. The rationale for CHA2DS2 -VASc, as put forth by its authors, is that other risk assessment models omit important risk factors, have low predictive ability, and categorize too many patients as intermediate risk, leaving the choice of anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy to the discretion of the clinician. Although CHA2DS2 -VASc readily identifies those patients truly at low risk, it classifies more patients as high risk who would then receive anticoagulation therapy. Therefore, implementation of this risk schema warrants further evaluation, especially when weighing the risk for bleeding and the risk for stroke. This critical review provides practitioners with an understanding of the literature that prompted the inclusion of these new risk factors and increased point allocations, compares and contrasts the risk schemas, and reviews national and international guidelines, thereby equipping the health care provider with the knowledge to aid clinical decision-making."

CD008201,0,15210400,0,Thromboprophylaxis and early antithrombotic therapy in patients with acute ischemic stroke and cerebral venous and sinus thrombosis.,"So far, neither treatment with standard unfractionated heparin (UFH) nor with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) has been shown to reduce mortality or to improve neurological outcome in patients with acute ischemic stroke. Although a reduction of early recurrent stroke has been demonstrated for the use of subcutaneous UFH, this benefit was offset by a similar-sized increase in hemorrhagic stroke. Double-blinded studies of LMWH have demonstrated no difference between active treatment and placebo suggesting that LMWH is not effective for the early secondary prevention of ischemic stroke. Although UFH and LMWH may be beneficial in certain subgroups of stroke who are at high risk for early stroke recurrence, these subgroups are still to be defined. Currently, low-dose UFH and LMWH can only be recommended for prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis in patients with acute ischemic stroke with impaired mobility or other factors determining a particular high risk of venous thromboembolism. Available treatment data from controlled trials favor the use of anticoagulation as the first-line therapy for patients with cerebral venous and sinus thrombosis because it may reduce the risk of a fatal outcome and severe disability and does not promote intracranial hemorrhage."

CD008201,0,19062245,0,[Clinical prediction rule for diagnosing deep vein thrombosis in primary care].,"Patients with suspected deep vein thrombosis (DVT) are often managed on an outpatient basis by primary care physicians. International guidelines recommend anticoagulant treatment for patients with suspected DVT when diagnostic testing is delayed or when clinical probability is high. Our goal was to build a clinical prediction rule specifically for easy use in primary care to help decide about starting anticoagulant therapy while awaiting ultrasound examination. Between January and December 2006, 276 patients with clinically suspected DVT were included in this study by 189 general practitioners from Brittany, France. All patients underwent a standardized clinical assessment and were then referred for ultrasonography. The diagnosis of DVT was confirmed in 103 (37%) patients. The final clinical prediction rule comprises four risk factors for DVT (personal history of venous thromboembolism +1, immobilization in previous month +1, estrogen contraceptive +2, active malignancy +3), one clinical sign (swelling of the calf +1), and the presence of an alternative diagnosis more likely than that of DVT (-3). The proportion of confirmed DVT was 26% in patients classified as at low risk, with a score less than 2 points, and 63% in patients classified at high risk, that is, with a score of 2 points or more. This clinical prediction rule is based on simple history and clinical factors that are routinely collected by GPs from patients with suspected DVT. It could help to decide about the immediate prescription of anticoagulation pending ultrasound. This rule should be externally validated before its use in clinical practice can be recommended."

CD008201,0,8541199,0,Use of inferior vena cava filters in the Medicare population.,"To examine the use of inferior vena cava (IVC) filters, we performed a population-based study using a 5% random sample of the United States Medicare population (1.25 million persons). Filter placement and its timing relative to diagnosis of venous thromboembolism (VTE) were determined using both hospital and physician Medicare billing codes after detailed review of large samples of complete individual claims records. Comorbid conditions and mortality were also noted. From July 1986 through June 1989, a total of 806 patients in the sample population received IVC filters. Mortality rates after filter placement were high: 16% during initial hospitalization, 32% within 6 months of filter placement, and 48% after 2 years. However, only 3 (1%) of 423 patients who underwent filter placement without the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) suffered PE within 1 year of filter placement. Use of IVC filters increased significantly over the study period (p < 0.001). Rates of filter placement among the nine census divisions of the United States differed significantly (p < 0.001). An East-West trend was notable with the highest rate (37 filters/100,000 enrollees/yr) in New England, as compared with 14 filters/100,000 enrollees/yr in the Pacific Division. No explanation for these regional differences was evident after patient demographics and comorbidity were examined. Vena cava filters prevent PE for at least 1 year after placement. The frequency of IVC filter use in elderly patients is increasing and varies substantially by region. Although reasons for these trends are unclear, these findings suggest the need for uniform practice guidelines for IVC filter placement."

No convincing evidence that warfarin is better than acetylsalicylic acid].","Current guidelines relating to the primary prevention of stroke in non-valvular atrial fibrillation are primarily based on randomised trials comparing warfarin with placebo. Warfarin is recommended in the majority of patients. However, weaknesses in the design and performance of these trials tend to overestimate the treatment effect. Furthermore, the inclusion of highly selected patients with a low percentage of elderly subjects, low bleeding risk, short follow-up periods and high discontinuation rates makes it impossible to generalize the results and apply them to general practice. Trials directly comparing warfarin with aspirin are the most reliable when it comes to comparing treatment efficacy. These trials have included a similar number of patients but a larger percentage of elderly patients and they comprise more years of observation and end-point events compared with the placebo-controlled warfarin trials. The results show that warfarin is not convincingly superior to aspirin in terms of stroke prevention. Warfarin can only be recommended in patients with a high risk of thromboembolic events."

CD008201,0,18544310,0,Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia: diagnosis and management.,"Heparin is the predominant anticoagulant used in cardiac and vascular surgery. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is one of the most serious and life-threatening adverse drug reactions associated with heparin use. In addition to the development of thrombocytopenia, HIT is associated with a high risk (40-50%) of thrombotic complications. The pathophysiology of HIT is now well understood and results from the formation of platelet-activating antibodies against the heparin-platelet factor 4 complex (H-PF4) on the platelet surface. The risk of HIT varies significantly depending on the type of heparin (unfractionated heparin greater than low-molecular-weight heparin), duration of heparin use, and patient population (surgery greater than medical). Readily available serologic assays for serum antibodies against H-PF4 allow for rapid confirmation of a clinical diagnosis of HIT. Owing to the high risk of thrombosis associated with HIT, antithrombotic therapy with direct thrombin inhibitors (lepirudin or argatroban) should be started when serologic assays confirm clinical suspicion."
CD008201,0,9522064,0,[Surgical technical guidelines in intestinal ischemia].,"Acute occlusive mesenteric ischemia is caused by a local impairment of splanchnic blood flow and poses a particular surgical challenge. Acute superior mesenteric occlusion is a medical/surgical emergency mandating prompt diagnosis (clinical awareness, angiography) and therapy (exploratory laparotomy with possible arterial reconstruction; embolectomy, thrombectomy; and/or bowel resection). The difficulty of early diagnosis is probably the most important cause of the high mortality which varies from 70% to 90% in arterial and functional mesenteric ischemia and from 20% to 70% in an acute thrombosis of the mesenteric veins. Improved survival from nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia is dependent upon the identification of high-risk groups and on aggressive diagnostic and therapeutic measures (intra-arterial infusion of papaverine through the angiographic catheter with or without bowel resection). For assessment of bowel viability, the clinical judgement during first- or second-look exploration is still the most reliable parameter. The surgical management of chronic mesenteric ischemia includes aortomesenteric grafting and transaortic endarterectomy in the majority of patients with comorbidity of cardiovascular arteriosclerotic diseases and results in a high rate of symptom-free patients. Prophylactic reconstruction of visceral arteries is indicated only in certain limited circumstances."

CD008201,0,21108553,0,Prevention of venous thromboembolism in obesity.,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients. Where appropriate, evidence-based methods of prophylaxis are implemented and the burden of VTE can be reduced substantially. Obesity, including morbid obesity, is associated with a high risk of VTE and, unfortunately, fixed doses of US FDA-approved anticoagulant regimens, including unfractionated heparins, low-molecular-weight heparins and factor Xa inhibitors, may not provide optimal VTE prophylaxis in these patients. Although the data are still limited, a rapidly growing body of literature and cumulative evidence suggests that anticoagulant dose adjustments in morbidly obese patients may optimize pharmacodynamic activity and reduce VTE risk. With the prevalence of morbid obesity continuing to rise, more high-quality clinical data are needed to better understand the pathobiology of VTE in obesity and provide effective, yet safe, prevention strategies."
CD008201,0,22628585,0,Combined (mechanical and pharmacological) modalities for the prevention of venous thromboembolism in joint replacement surgery.,"We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare the efficacy of intermittent mechanical compression combined with pharmacological thromboprophylaxis, against either mechanical compression or pharmacological prophylaxis in preventing deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism in patients undergoing hip or knee replacement. A total of six randomised controlled trials, evaluating a total of 1399 patients, were identified. In knee arthroplasty, the rate of DVT was reduced from 18.7% with anticoagulation alone to 3.7% with combined modalities (risk ratio (RR) 0.27, p = 0.03; number needed to treat: seven). There was moderate, albeit non-significant, heterogeneity (I(2) = 42%). In hip replacement, there was a non-significant reduction in DVT from 8.7% with mechanical compression alone to 7.2% with additional pharmacological prophylaxis (RR 0.84) and a significant reduction in DVT from 9.7% with anticoagulation alone to 0.9% with additional mechanical compression (RR 0.17, p < 0.001; number needed to treat: 12), with no heterogeneity (I(2) = 0%). The included studies had insufficient power to demonstrate an effect on pulmonary embolism. We conclude that the addition of intermittent mechanical leg compression augments the efficacy of anticoagulation in preventing DVT in patients undergoing both knee and hip replacement. Further research on the role of combined modalities in thromboprophylaxis in joint replacement and in other high-risk situations, such as fracture of the hip, is warranted."

CD008201,0,20662869,0,Venous thromboembolic disease in congestive heart failure.,"Congestive heart failure (CHF) is a medical condition associated with a relatively high risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Without thromboprophylaxis, venographically proven deep vein thrombosis occurs in 10% to 22% of hospitalized patients with CHF. Although the elevated VTE risk associated with CHF has been attributed to a variety of abnormalities in the context of Virchow's triad, newer information suggests that an associated chronic inflammatory state may be culpable. Both traditional VTE risk factors and cardiac-specific risk factors further increase the risk of VTE in patients with CHF. Severe left ventricular dysfunction, clinical instability (New York Heart Association class III-IV), young age, and/or right ventricular dysfunction appear to enhance the VTE risk associated with CHF. Grade IA pharmacologic thromboprophylactic recommendations for the hospitalized CHF patient include low molecular weight-heparin, fondaparinux, and low-dose unfractionated heparin. Regrettably, a variance in societal guidelines on the importance of VTE in hospitalized CHF patients may lead to underutilization of thromboprophylaxis."
CD008201,0,20691885,0,Management of the lymph nodes in penile cancer.,"A comprehensive literature study was conducted to evaluate the levels of evidence (LEs) in publications on the diagnosis and staging of penile cancer. Recommendations from the available evidence were formulated and discussed by the full panel of the International Consultation on Penile Cancer in November 2008. The final grades of recommendation (GRs) were assigned according to the LE of the relevant publications. The following consensus recommendations were accepted. Fine needle aspiration cytology should be performed in all patients (with ultrasound guidance in those with nonpalpable nodes). If the findings are positive, therapeutic, rather than diagnostic, inguinal lymph node dissection (ILND) can be performed (GR B). Antibiotic treatment for 3-6 weeks before ILND in patients with palpable inguinal nodes is not recommended (GR B). Abdominopelvic computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are not useful in patients with nonpalpable nodes. However, they can be used in those with large, palpable inguinal nodes (GR B). The statistical probability of inguinal micrometastases can be estimated using risk group stratification or a risk calculation nomogram (GR B). Surveillance is recommended if the nomogram probability of positive nodes is <0.1 (10%). Surveillance is also recommended if the primary lesion is grade 1, pTis, pTa (verrucous carcinoma), or pT1, with no lymphovascular invasion, and clinically nonpalpable inguinal nodes, but only provided the patient is willing to comply with regular follow-up (GR B). In the presence of factors that impede reliable surveillance (obesity, previous inguinal surgery, or radiotherapy) prophylactic ILND might be a preferable option (GR C). In the intermediate-risk group (nomogram probability .1-.5 [10%-50%] or primary tumor grade 1-2, T1-T2, cN0, no lymphovascular invasion), surveillance is acceptable, provided the patient is informed of the risks and is willing and able to comply. If not, sentinel node biopsy (SNB) or limited (modified) ILND should be performed (GR B). In the high-risk group (nomogram probability >.5 [50%] or primary tumor grade 2-3 or T2-T4 or cN1-N2, or with lymphovascular invasion), bilateral ILND should be performed (GR B). ILND can be performed at the same time as penectomy, instead of 2-6 weeks later (GR C). SNB based on the anatomic position can be performed, provided the patient is willing to accept the potential false-negative rate of </=25% (GR C). Dynamic SNB with lymphoscintigraphic and blue dye localization can be performed if the technology and expertise are available (GR C). Limited ILND can be performed instead of complete ILND to reduce the complication rate, although the false-negative rate might be similar to that of anatomic SNB (GR C). Frozen section histologic examination can be used during SNB or limited ILND. If the results are positive, complete ILND can be performed immediately (GR C). In patients with cytologically or histologically proven inguinal metastases, complete ILND should be performed ipsilaterally (GR B). In patients with histologically confirmed inguinal metastases involving >/=2 nodes on one side, contralateral limited ILND with frozen section analysis can be performed, with complete ILND if the frozen section analysis findings are positive (GR B). If clinically suspicious inguinal metastases develop during surveillance, complete ILND should be performed on that side only (GR B), and SNB or limited ILND with frozen section analysis on the contralateral side can be considered (GR C). Endoscopic ILND requires additional study to determine the complication and long-term survival rates (GR C). Pelvic lymph node dissection is recommended if >/=2 proven inguinal metastases, grade 3 tumor in the lymph nodes, extranodal extension (ENE), or large (2-4 cm) inguinal nodes are present, or if the femoral (Cloquet's) node is involved (GR C). Performing ILND before pelvic lymph node dissection is preferable, because pelvic lymph node dissection can be avoided in patients with minimal inguinal metastases, thus avoiding the greater risk of chronic lymphedema (GR B). In patients with numerous or large inguinal metastases, CT or MRI should be performed. If grossly enlarged iliac nodes are present, neoadjuvant chemotherapy should be given and the response assessed before proceeding with pelvic lymph node dissection (GR C). Antibiotic treatment should be started before surgery to minimize the risk of wound infection (GR C). Perioperative low-dose heparin to prevent thromboembolic complications can be used, although it might increase lymph leakage (GR C). The skin incision for ILND should be parallel to the inguinal ligament, and sufficient subcutaneous tissue should be preserved to minimize the risk of skin flap necrosis (GR B). Sartorius muscle transposition to cover the femoral vessels can be used in radical ILND (GR C). Closed suction drainage can be used after ILND to prevent fluid accumulation and wound breakdown (GR B). Early mobilization after ILND is recommended, unless a myocutaneous flap has been used (GR B). Elastic stockings or sequential compression devices are advisable to minimize the risk of lymphedema and thromboembolism (GR C). Radiotherapy to the inguinal areas is not recommended in patients without cytologically or histologically proven metastases nor in those with micrometastases, but it can be considered for bulky metastases as neoadjuvant therapy to surgery (GR B). Adjuvant radiotherapy after complete ILND can be considered in patients with multiple or large inguinal metastases or ENE (GR C). Adjuvant chemotherapy after complete ILND can be used instead of radiotherapy in patients with >/=2 inguinal metastases, large nodes, ENE, or pelvic metastases (GR C). Follow-up should be individualized according to the histopathologic features and the management chosen for the primary tumor and inguinal nodes (GR B)."

In eight patients (18%) a total of ten DVT appeared within the first postoperative week. Four thrombi were located at or above knee level. More extensive surgery was associated with higher DVT incidence than lesser operations (32% v. 8%). In patients belonging to blood groups B and AB, DVT was more common than in other blood groups. Five of the six unilateral DVT were detected on the same side as the thoracotomy.

CD008201,0,22987320,0,Anticoagulation in heart failure: current status and future direction.,"Despite therapeutic advances, patients with worsening heart failure (HF) requiring hospitalization have unacceptably high post-discharge mortality and re-admission rates soon after discharge. Evidence suggests a hypercoagulable state is present in patients with HF. Although thromboembolism as a direct consequence of HF is not frequently clinically recognized, it may contribute to mortality and morbidity. Additionally, many patients with HF have concomitant disorders conferring additional thrombotic risk, including atrial fibrillation (AF) and coronary artery disease (CAD). Acute coronary syndrome (ACS), a known consequence of coronary thrombosis, is a common precipitating factor for worsening HF. Coronary thrombosis may also cause sudden death in patients with HF and CAD. Because data are largely derived from observational studies or trials of modest size, guideline recommendations on anticoagulation for HF vary between organizations. The recently presented Warfarin versus Aspirin in Reduced Cardiac Ejection Fraction trial of HF patients in sinus rhythm suggested anticoagulation reduces the risk of stroke, although rates of the combined primary endpoint (death, ischemic stroke, or intracerebral hemorrhage) were similar for acetylsalicylic acid and warfarin. Newer oral anticoagulants dabigatran, apixaban, and rivaroxaban have successfully completed trials for the prevention of stroke in patients with AF and have shown benefits in the subpopulation of patients with concomitant HF. Positive results of the Anti-Xa Therapy to Lower Cardiovascular Events in Addition to Standard Therapy in Subjects with Acute Coronary Syndrome-Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 51 (ATLAS ACS 2-TIMI 51) trial of rivaroxaban in ACS are also encouraging. These data suggest there is a need to assess the potential role for these newer agents in the management of patients hospitalized for HF who continue to have a high post-discharge event rate despite available therapies."

CD008201,0,26920607,0,Individualized approaches to thromboprophylaxis in atrial fibrillation.,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia worldwide. The prevalence of AF in persons older than 55 years is at least 33.5 million globally and is predicted to more than double in the next half-century. Anticoagulation, heart rate control, and heart rhythm control comprise the 3 main treatment strategies in AF. Anticoagulation is aimed at preventing debilitating stroke, systemic embolism, and associated mortality. Historically, anticoagulation in AF was achieved with a vitamin K antagonist such as warfarin, which is supported by evidence demonstrating reduced incident stroke and all-cause mortality. However, warfarin has unpredictable pharmacokinetics with many drug-drug interactions that require regular monitoring to ensure patients remain in the therapeutic anticoagulant range. Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants including dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban provide a possible solution to these issues with their more predictable pharmacokinetics, rapid onset of action, and greater specificity. Results from large randomized, controlled trials indicate that these agents are at least noninferior to warfarin in prevention of stroke. These trials also demonstrate a consistently lower incidence of intracranial hemorrhage, almost always all life-threatening bleeds, and many forms of major bleeds with the possible exception of gastrointestinal and some other forms of mucosal bleeding, compared with warfarin. Patients with AF are a heterogeneous population with diverse risk of stroke and bleeding, and different subgroups respond differently to anticoagulation. Important clinical questions have arisen regarding optimal anticoagulation drug selection in distinct populations such as those with renal impairment, older age, coronary artery disease, and heart failure as well as those at particularly high risk for bleeding or thromboembolism. In this review, treatment strategies in AF management are discussed in the context of different individual subgroups of patients."

One of the major changes has been the widespread adoption of pediatric-based protocols, which appears to have significantly improved survival and probably renders allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) unnecessary in most standard-risk patients. However, high-risk patients, such as those with BCR-ABL or MLL rearrangements or high white count presentations, should still be referred for HSCT in CR-1. Minimal residual disease positivity has also been identified as a high-risk feature. Patients with BCR-ABL-positive ALL should receive combined therapy with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor and chemotherapy prior to HSCT. The adoption of pediatric-based regimens has been associated with significant additional toxicities, including venous thromboembolism, osteonecrosis, other steroid-related changes, and neuropathy, which can potentially have a major adverse impact on the quality of life of these young ALL patients."

Thromboprophylaxis with low doses of heparin and aspirin may be discussed in order to reduced adverse obstetric outcomes. No randomized controlled trials are currently published in the literature. Thromboprophylaxis may be unwarranted in asymptomatic women because of the lack for an association between thrombophilia and pregnancy outcome. Women with antiphospholipid syndrome are at high risk for pregnancy loss and maternal complications. Pregnancy in women with antiphospholipid syndrome appears to be improved by thromboprophylaxis, but adverse obstetric outcome may occur despite treatment. Thromboprophylaxis is recently reported in women with previous poor obstetric outcomes.

CD008201,0,23798715,0,Advanced drug delivery systems for antithrombotic agents.,"Despite continued achievements in antithrombotic pharmacotherapy, difficulties remain in managing patients at high risk for both thrombosis and hemorrhage. Utility of antithrombotic agents (ATAs) in these settings is restricted by inadequate pharmacokinetics and narrow therapeutic indices. Use of advanced drug delivery systems (ADDSs) may help to circumvent these problems. Various nanocarriers, affinity ligands, and polymer coatings provide ADDSs that have the potential to help optimize ATA pharmacokinetics, target drug delivery to sites of thrombosis, and sense pathologic changes in the vascular microenvironment, such as altered hemodynamic forces, expression of inflammatory markers, and structural differences between mature hemostatic and growing pathological clots. Delivery of ATAs using biomimetic synthetic carriers, host blood cells, and recombinant fusion proteins that are activated preferentially at sites of thrombus development has shown promising outcomes in preclinical models. Further development and translation of ADDSs that spare hemostatic fibrin clots hold promise for extending the utility of ATAs in the management of acute thrombotic disorders through rapid, transient, and targeted thromboprophylaxis. If the potential benefit of this technology is to be realized, a systematic and concerted effort is required to develop clinical trials and translate the use of ADDSs to the clinical arena."
CD008201,0,25312482,0,The prevention of pregnancy-related venous thromboembolism.,"Pregnancy-related venous thromboembolism (VTE) remains one of the leading causes of maternal mortality and morbidity in the developed world. There is a lack of high-level data surrounding the use of thromboprophylaxis in pregnancy. In the UK, following the publication of the first Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) guideline for VTE prophylaxis during pregnancy and the puerperium in 2004, a fall in maternal deaths secondary to VTE was observed during the subsequent triennium (2006-2008). For the first time since 1985, VTE was no longer the most common cause of maternal death. Low-molecular-weight-heparin (LMWH) is generally the agent of choice for thromboprophylaxis in this setting, and is considered safe and efficacious. The accurate risk stratification of women in order to allow the targeted provision of thromboprophylaxis is challenging. A number of international guidelines support risk assessment for pregnancy-related VTE and the provision of LMWH for those who are deemed at sufficiently high risk. This review describes the importance of VTE in pregnancy and the puerperium, the part played by different risk factors and the role of thromboprophylaxis in this group of patients."

Current practice guidelines (EAST and ACCP) are based on the critical appraisal of observational studies. As a result, their recommendations are conflicting and may account for practice pattern variation. The purpose of this study is to critically review the available literature and ascertain the level of evidence both for and against the use of pIVCFs for PE prophylaxis in trauma patients. We searched PubMed and Web of Science for publications from 1950 until July 2010 that assessed the efficacy of PE prevention with pIVCFs in the trauma population. We followed the MOOSE (Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology) guidelines for design, implementation, and reporting. The Newcastle-Ottawa Score was used for quality and comparability assessment. Seven observational studies met inclusion criteria for this meta-analysis, representing 1,900 patients. Only one study was published in this decade. The rate of PE was statistically lower in the IVCF group compared to a matched control group without IVCFs (OR 0.21, 95% CI 0.09-0.49). There was no significant difference in DVT. Using the MOOSE criteria these results show a decreased likelihood of PE among trauma patients who receive pIVCFs. Although these results could favor the placement of pIVCFs, the lack of contemporary use of pharmacologic prophylaxis across studies does not allow us to make firm conclusions either for or against the routine use of pIVCFs. Prospective randomized trials are needed to determine the role of pIVCFs in high-risk trauma patients."

CD008201,0,16638458,0,Treatment of cancer-associated thrombosis: distinguishing among antithrombotic agents.,"The risk of cancer-associated thrombosis can be substantial, depending on tumor type, extent of cancer, and type of treatment. Unfractionated heparin and warfarin have been used in the prevention of cancer-associated thrombosis, but low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is widely used for the prevention of venous thromboembolism in high-risk patients. Long-term management with warfarin is associated with close monitoring, an increased risk of drug interactions, and bleeding. LMWHs may offer an alternative outpatient treatment strategy for prophylactic treatment because of their simpler dosing, more predictable anticoagulant activity, and improved safety profile. Clinical trials examining the treatment of venous thromboembolism with LMWH in patients with cancer suggest a survival advantage for the treated groups. Subtle differences in the pharmacokinetics of available LMWHs exist, and each LMWH should be regarded as a distinct drug. Pharmacists should be aware of the US Food and Drug Administration-approved uses for each LMWH, dosing options, and the advantages and disadvantages of available delivery systems for various patient populations. Pharmacists can play a major role in educating patients and other health care professionals on risk factor recognition, patient risk stratification, and proper agent selection for prevention and treatment of cancer-associated thrombosis."

CD008201,0,19323620,0,Key articles and guidelines for the prevention of venous thromboembolism.,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is an important medical problem that affects millions of patients each year. With appropriate prophylaxis, many of these thromboembolic events can be prevented. Although strong evidence supporting VTE prophylaxis spans several decades, several large American and global registries have documented very poor use of appropriate prophylaxis. Because of increasing regulatory requirements, hospitals nationwide are in the process of developing documentation of appropriate VTE prophylaxis programs for both surgical and medical patients. A wide range of clinicians must understand what constitutes appropriate VTE prophylaxis in various patient populations. With the existence of numerous pharmacologic agents, abundance of data from major clinical trials, and several nationally recognized clinical guidelines, compiling the needed reference material to make evidence-based decisions on appropriate VTE prophylaxis can be difficult for clinicians. Therefore, we provide a bibliography of key articles and guidelines related to the prevention of VTE in various patient groups.

Extra protection against this can be given to patients with cancer by using a higher dose of LMWH than normally used for prophylaxis, with no increase in bleeding complications. Despite thromboprophylaxis with high-dose LMWH for the first postoperative week, the rate of late VTE is estimated to be between 10% and 20%. A meta-analysis of two studies using dalteparin or enoxaparin has shown that prolonging thromboprophylaxis for a further 3 weeks significantly reduces the risk of late occurring VTE by 62%.

CD008201,0,18464681,0,[Drug-eluting stent-associated thrombosis: clinical relevance of impaired vessel-wall healing].,"In-stent thrombosis remains to bo an uncommon but dreadful complication of coronary angioplasty manifesting as sudden death or acute coronary syndrome. Drug-eluting stents (DES) proved to be an effective approach in the prevention and treatment of restenosis across a broad spectrum of lesion and patient subsets. Considerable concerns over this technology were raised when a modest increase in the incidence of very late in-stent thrombosis was demonstrated in DES-treated patients which in some trials even translated into higher mortality and myocardial infarctions compared with bare metal stenting (BMS). Unfortunately, DES not only suppress neointimal formation, but also impair the vessel healing process. Delayed and incomplete endothelialization is frequently observed after DES application. Increased blood thrombogenicity due to the prothrombotic effects of eluting drugs and inadequate platelet inhibition along with altered blood flow through remodeled arteries with dysfunctional endothelium contribute to late DES thrombosis. However, a large amount of data from randomized trials suggest that DES when used on label are not associated with unfavourable clinical outcomes. In these patients DES are probably responsible for a slightly elevated risk of late thrombotic events and simultaneously decreased rates of restenosis-related myocardial infarctions and deaths compared with BMS. The potential benefits and risks of DES off-label stenting are yet to be assessed. Since insufficient platelet inhibition was reported as the strongest predictor of DES thrombosis, the necessity of prolonged dual antiplatelet therapy has constituted a major limitation of this device. Therefore, DES implantation should be particularly avoided in non-compliant patients, in those who are scheduled for major surgery requiring premature discontinuation of dual antiplatelet therapy, and in persons who are at high risk of bleeding. Elective operations in DES patients are suggested to be postponed until 12 months after stenting, while dental procedures, when needed, may be performed on dual antiplatelet treatment. Although recent European and American guidelines recommend dual antiplatelet therapy after DES placement for 6-12 and 12 months, respectively, its optimal duration is a matter of ongoing debate. Subsequent generations of DES developed for a better safety profile as well as novel technologies dedicated to facilitate endothelialization are currently under investigation. Finally, caution is advised in the choice of the particular device for each patient."

Therefore, the prevention of VTE is essential and foremost involves the assessment of individual patient risk factors for VTE and, consequently, the correction of those risk factors that are modifiable. Mechanical and pharmacological prophylaxis are highly effective at preventing VTE in patients hospitalized for acute disease, and they are recommended by the leading guidelines for hospitalized patients with IBD. Unfortunately, several recent surveys reported that prophylaxis against VTE is still poorly implemented because of concerns about its safety and a lack of awareness of the magnitude of thrombotic risk in patients with IBD. Therefore, further efforts are required to increase the thromboprophylaxis rate in these patients to bridge the gap between the best care and standard care and, consequently, to avoid preventable VTE-associated morbidity and mortality.

Three of four cases of fatal pulmonary embolism occur in nonsurgical settings, but thromboprophylaxis is far less common in medical than in surgical patients. This is mainly attributable to the heterogeneity of nonsurgical populations and lack of high-quality evidence to support specific thromboprophylactic measures. The recent Prophylaxis of Venous Thromboembolism in MEDical Patients With ENOXaparin (MEDENOX) trial addressed this deficiency by assessing the need for and the benefit:risk ratio of thromboprophylaxis in a well-defined group of medical patients immobilized with severe illness. The MEDENOX study showed that these patients are at significant risk of VTE. Enoxaparin, 40 mg once daily for 6 to 14 days, reduced the risk of VTE by 63% without increasing adverse events. It is anticipated that data from the MEDENOX study will be incorporated into future consensus guidelines on the prevention of VTE.

Optimal management of thromboembolic disease, both to prevent VTE and to avoid recurrence of pregnancy complications such as miscarriage, centers on the use of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH). LMWHs, such as enoxaparin and dalteparin, have clinical and practical advantages compared with unfractionated heparin in terms of improved safety (significantly lower incidence of osteoporosis, thrombocytopenia, and possibly allergic skin reactions) and the potential for outpatient treatment of acute VTE. However, many unanswered questions remain, including who to treat, how to treat them, and when to treat in the case of patients with thrombophilia and a history of previous pregnancy complications."

CD008201,0,17670663,0,Should patients post-cardiac surgery be given low molecular weight heparin for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis?,"A best evidence topic in cardiac surgery was written according to a structured protocol. The question addressed was whether the use of prophylactic postoperative low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or unfractionated heparin after cardiac surgery would significantly reduce morbidity by reducing the incidence of deep vein thromboses (DVTs) and pulmonary emboli (PEs). Altogether 390 papers were identified on Medline. Relevant major guidelines were also searched together with their reference lists. Sixteen papers represented the best evidence on the topic. The author, journal, date and country of publication, patient group studied, study type, relevant outcomes, results and study weaknesses were tabulated. We conclude that the benefit of heparin prophylaxis for the prevention of DVTs and PEs is well established in non-cardiac surgery with reductions in the incidence of DVTs reported to be of the order of 50-70% in orthopaedic, general and obstetric surgery and in general medicine. No studies have yet been performed in cardiac surgery, but contrary to the view that DVTs are rare, in fact the incidence of DVT post-cardiac surgery is up to 15-20% and the incidence of PE is around 0.5 to 4% although many of these occur after discharge and many may be difficult to detect clinically. This is similar to the incidence of patients undergoing high risk general surgery. There is no evidence that heparin prophylaxis started the day after surgery increases the risk of pericardial effusions and the risk of bleeding complications is estimated to be 4%. Thus, we recommend that all patients post-cardiac surgery be commenced on heparin prophylaxis the day after their surgery and continue this up to discharge even if mobile. The particular regime should be guided by the ACCP recommendations for prophylaxis in high risk general surgical patients."

Although the risks associated with VTE have been well recognized in surgical cancer patients, there is also considerable and increasing risk in medical cancer patients. VTE risk factors in medical cancer patients include the type and stage of cancer, major comorbid illnesses, current hospitalization, active chemotherapy, hormone therapy, and antiangiogenic agents. Low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs) are recommended commonly for the prevention of VTE in hospitalized cancer patients and in higher risk ambulatory cancer patients because of their favorable risk-to-benefit profile. These agents have demonstrated effectiveness in both the primary and secondary prevention of VTE in medical cancer patients. Extended-duration anticoagulant therapy is often recommended to reduce the risk of VTE recurrence in patients with cancer. LMWHs are often used for long-term prophylaxis because of a reduced need for coagulation monitoring, few major bleeding episodes, and once-daily dosing. Despite clinical and practical benefits, a substantial proportion of medical cancer patients do not receive VTE prophylaxis. To improve the appropriate prevention and treatment of VTE in cancer patients, guidelines have been published recently by the American Society of Clinical Oncology and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network. Widespread dissemination and application of these guidelines are encouraged to improve the appropriate use of these agents and to improve clinical outcomes in medical cancer patients at risk for VTE and its complications."

Head-of-bed up at 30 degrees and glucose control, although variably practiced, were formally instituted in 2005. Enforcement of daily weaning parameters and sedation holidays were also implemented after 2005. The time period before institution of the core measures was 2003 to 2004 (pregroup), which was compared with the study time period of 2006 to 2008 (postgroup). There were no differences in the mean burn size, percent of inhalation injuries, or age between the two time periods. The VAP rate fell from 42/1000 to 13/1000 ventilator days, P = .0001. The BSI rate also declined from 12/1000 to 4/1000 line days, P = .05. Hospital and ICU lengths of stay and ventilator days did not change significantly between the periods. Risk-adjusted mortality for ICU patients improved from 13 to 7% (P = 0.01, odds ratio = 0.5 [0.29-0.85]). Although not specifically designed for the burn population, implementation of the proposed Joint Commission on the Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations ICU core measures for burn patients was associated with improvements in VAP and BSI rates, as well as a lower mortality."

CD008201,0,12071575,0,Platelet membrane glycoproteins in haemostasis.,"Platelets play a critical role in both primary and secondary haemostasis. In primary haemostasis, specialised glycoprotein receptors enable platelets to adhere to proteins that are exposed in areas of vascular damage. The process of adhesion, and/or the interaction of soluble agonists with receptors on the platelet, activates the platelets, which are then able to aggregate together. This aggregation creates a platelet plug that seals the breach in the vessel wall and prevents excess blood loss. Activated platelets then facilitate secondary haemostasis, the formation of a fibrin clot, by carrying coagulation factors and providing a catalytic surface for the major interactions of the coagulation cascade. This review briefly describes the adhesion, activation and aggregation of platelets; their role in blood coagulation and clot retraction; and how they may be inhibited in order to prevent thrombosis in at-risk patients."

These benefits of early reperfusion may be confounded, however, by platelet mediated reocclusion after initial lysis, and ""reperfusion injury"" mediated by oxygen derived free radicals. Superoxide dismutase (SOD)--as well as its action as a potent free radical scavenging agent--inhibits platelet aggregation in vitro. Thus our primary objectives were to determine whether SOD+catalase, given as adjuvant therapy with recombinant human tissue plasminogen activator, could inhibit platelet aggregation and thereby reduce the time to lysis and maintain arterial patency. Whether SOD+catalase enhanced myocardial salvage or improved acute recovery of contractile function in the setting of thrombosis/thrombolysis was also assessed."

All patients admitted with a diagnosis of hip fracture to our institution between July 1, 1987, and December 31, 1999, were evaluated. Study inclusion criteria were age 65 years or older, previously ambulatory, cognitively intact, home-dwelling, and having a nonpathologic intertrochanteric or femoral neck fracture. Each patient received mechanical thromboprophylaxis (above-knee elastic stockings) and 1 pharmacologic agent (aspirin, dextran 40, or enoxaparin); patients who received aspirin were also given a calf sequential compression device. Meeting the selection criteria and included in the study were 917 patients. Findings included low incidence of thromboembolic phenomena (deep vein thrombosis, 0.5%-1.7%; pulmonary embolism, 0%-2.0%; fatal pulmonary embolism, 0%-0.5%) and no difference among the 3 pharmacologic agents in thromboembolic prophylaxis efficacy. Use of enoxaparin was associated with a significant increase (3.8%) in wound hematoma compared with dextran 40 (1.6%) and aspirin (2.4%) (P<.01). The 3 agents were found not to differ with respect to mortality, thromboembolic phenomena, hemorrhagic complications, or wound complications."
CD008201,0,15912431,0,[Diagnosis of ischemia].,"Clinically, coronary artery disease (CAD) presents either as stable angina pectoris or as an acute coronary syndrome. Atypical chest pain or silent myocardial ischemia is not uncommon and may obscure the diagnosis of CAD. Whereas primary or secondary prevention is indicated in all cases with suspected or documented atherosclerosis, cardiac catheterization and revascularization therapy is restricted to patients with significant CAD. In order to detect hemodynamically significant coronary artery stenoses, exercise stress tests or noninvasive stress imaging are usually implemented in the diagnostic workup. By contrast, patients presenting with an acute coronary syndrome require an initial risk stratification for estimation of the acute thrombotic risk associated with the underlying vulnerable plaque. Consecutively, patients without high-risk features need a thorough noninvasive evaluation for the presence of significant CAD which is comparable to patients presenting with chronic stable angina pectoris."

Nevertheless, thromboprophylaxis remains greatly underused. The National Quality Forum, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, and the Joint Commission have developed quality measures aimed at improving the provision of appropriate thromboprophylaxis. Reporting of these measures will increasingly become mandatory and hospitals will face financial penalties for failure to report. The approval of new oral anticoagulants (direct thrombin and factor Xa inhibitors) may simplify provision of thromboprophylaxis and eventually increase adherence to guidelines and quality measures. The primary objective of this review is to present evidence supporting the core quality measures for VTE prevention and stroke prevention in patients with AF. The secondary objective is to familiarize physicians with the new anticoagulants and their approved indications. This review concludes with a brief description of the Society of Hospital Medicine online resources for VTE prevention as well as recommendations for planning and implementation of quality improvement in the management of VTE."
CD008201,0,24095288,0,Thrombosis in inflammatory bowel disease: are we tailoring prophylaxis to those most at risk?,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a disease-specific risk factor for incident and recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE). The reasons are acquired, multifactorial, and related to prothrombotic aberrations during active disease, although the mechanisms remain incompletely elucidated. VTE represents a potentially life-threatening extraintestinal manifestation of IBD, but the associated morbidity and mortality can be reduced by appropriate use of thromboprophylaxis. Nevertheless, despite international guidelines advocating thromboprophylaxis in hospitalised patients with IBD, practice is highly variable, since 65% of gastroenterologists may not use pharmacological VTE prophylaxis in hospitalised patients with acute severe colitis. Furthermore, there is no guidance on appropriate prophylaxis for ambulatory outpatients with active disease who are at an appreciable risk of VTE. Thus the question: are we tailoring thromboprophylaxis to those patients with IBD who are most at risk?"

CD008201,0,20449887,0,High incidence of symptomatic venous thromboembolism in Thai hospitalized medical patients without thromboprophylaxis.,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common preventable cause of mortality during hospitalization. However, prophylaxis is frequently under-utilized due to the belief that it is rare in Asia. The objective of the study was to estimate the incidence of symptomatic VTE in hospitalized nonsurgical Thai patients. We performed a prospective study in medical wards in Chulalongkorn Hospital, a tertiary care university-based center, from June 2007 to December 2008. We included adult patients admitted beyond 3 days. Patients with VTE before admissions or undergoing major surgery during hospitalization were excluded. According to the usual practice, heparin prophylaxis was not given. However, the program of primary physician education and fast-track diagnostic imaging were implemented. Forty-two VTEs from 7126 susceptible patients [0.59%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.41-0.77%] were found; 20 (48%) definite pulmonary embolism, four of which also had symptomatic deep vein thrombosis (DVT), 19 (45%) definite DVT and three sudden deaths from possible pulmonary embolism. Immobilization (74%), active cancer (52%) and rheumatologic diseases (12%), including arthritis of lower extremities and systemic lupus erythematosus with antiphospholipid, were common VTE risk factors, which were present in our patients. The incidences in total cases of arthritis, cancer, mechanical ventilation and congestive heart failure were 7.7, 1.8, 1.5 and 0.5%, respectively. Notably, nine of 23 (39%) pulmonary embolism cases were fatal and two more patients (9.5%) expired from bleeding after treatment (one pulmonary embolism and one DVT). In conclusion, VTE contributes significant hazard to hospitalized nonsurgical Thai patients. Appropriate measures to assure proper thromboprophylaxis in high-risk patients are strongly needed."
CD008201,0,15383484,0,Thrombolysis and adjunctive therapy in acute myocardial infarction: the Seventh ACCP Conference on Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy.,"This chapter about antithrombotic therapy for acute myocardial infarction (MI) is part of the Seventh ACCP Conference on Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy: Evidence Based Guidelines. Grade 1 recommendations are strong and indicate that the benefits do, or do not, outweigh risks, burden, and costs. Grade 2 suggests that individual patients' values may lead to different choices (for a full understanding of the grading see Guyatt et al, CHEST 2004; 126:179S-187S). Among the key recommendations in this chapter are the following: For patients with ischemic symptoms characteristic of acute MI of < 12 h in duration, and ST-segment elevation or left bundle-branch block (of unknown duration) on the ECG, we recommend administration of any approved fibrinolytic agent (Grade 1A). We recommend the use of streptokinase, anistreplase, alteplase, reteplase, or tenecteplase over placebo (all Grade 1A). For patients with symptom duration < 6 h, we recommend the administration of alteplase over streptokinase (Grade 1A). For patients with known allergy or sensitivity to streptokinase, we recommend alteplase, reteplase, or tenecteplase (Grade 1A). For patients with acute posterior MI of < 12 h duration, we suggest fibrinolytic therapy (Grade 2C). In patients with any history of intracranial hemorrhage, closed head trauma, or ischemic stroke within past 3 months, we recommend against administration of fibrinolytic therapy (Grade 1C+). For patients with acute ST-segment elevation MI whether or not they receive fibrinolytic therapy, we recommend aspirin, 160 to 325 mg p.o., at initial evaluation by health-care personnel followed by indefinite therapy, 75 to 162 mg/d p.o. (both Grade 1A). In patients allergic to aspirin, we suggest use of clopidogrel as an alternative therapy to aspirin (Grade 2C). For patients receiving streptokinase, we suggest administration of either i.v. unfractionated heparin (UFH) [Grade 2C] or subcutaneous UFH (Grade 2A). For all patients at high risk of systemic or venous thromboembolism (anterior MI, pump failure, previous embolus, atrial fibrillation, or left ventricular thrombus), we recommend administration of IV UFH while receiving streptokinase (Grade 1C+)."

There is no evidence of heparin or heparinoid to improve long-term outcome, although anticoagulant therapy might be indicated for stroke associated with coagulation activation such as progressing stroke, basilar artery thrombosis, cardioembolic stroke at high risk, coagulopathy, and arterial dissection. In patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, there is no evidence of immediate anticoagulation with heparin to improve long-term outcome, which is rather contraindicated for large hemispheric stroke, and it is recommended to start warfarin directly in the safety issue. Aspirin is recommended in the guidelines of many countries, although the efficacy is modest. A clinical trial of the GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor abciximab, which is a more potent antiplatelet agent than aspirin, had recently been conducted, although it was stopped because of the concern on the safety.

CD008201,0,18364658,0,Role of antiplatelet agents in the primary and secondary prevention of atherothrombotic events in high risk-patients.,"Atherothrombosis describes the superimposition of a thrombus on a ruptured atherosclerotic plaque, and is the primary cause of acute ischemic events. Atherothrombosis is a generalized and progressive process with an inflammatory component. Patients with disease in one vascular bed are at risk of disease in another, a concept known as ""cross-risk."" Platelet adhesion, activation, and aggregation in the final stage of atherothrombosis are ultimately responsible for arterial occlusion and consequent ischemia. Therefore, antiplatelet therapy is an effective treatment choice for secondary prevention. Clopidogrel, an adenosine diphosphate receptor antagonist, given alone or in combination with aspirin, may benefit secondary prevention of ischemic events. Current treatment guidelines suggest the use of a combination of these two agents for secondary prevention where appropriate. However, data conflict regarding the efficacy of antiplatelet therapy for primary prevention. A recent meta-analysis demonstrated that aspirin significantly reduces the risk of first myocardial infarction in both men and women. The recent Clopidogrel for High Atherothrombotic Risk and Ischemic Stabilization, Management, and Avoidance trial, which evaluated the effects of clopidogrel plus aspirin compared with aspirin alone, seems to support the use of dual antiplatelet therapy in secondary prevention, but suggests that it may not be more effective than aspirin alone in primary prevention."

Of the 1,161 patients in the PSROP database, 383 (32.99%) patients without DVT and 8 (0.69%) with DVT had no documented orders for anticoagulant medications. Sixty-five (5.60%) patients had DVTs during the inpatient rehabilitation facility stay. Of 10 (0.86%) patients with DVTs in the common femoral vein, 4 (40%) were diagnosed within 24 hours of admission. Nine (90%) of these 10 patients were classified as moderate or severe strokes.

CD008201,0,19076173,0,The prevention of hospital-acquired venous thromboembolism in the United Kingdom.,"Hospital-acquired venous thromboembolism (VTE) remains the number one safety issue in hospitals and is estimated to cause more preventable deaths than the more publicized hospital-acquired infection. There has been a failure of implementation of thromboprophylaxis (TP), mainly because of lack of awareness among health professionals, despite the large number of evidence-based studies available. The situation in the UK is gradually changing because of tireless campaigning by politicians, a charity and key opinion leaders. In response, the Department of Health has issued a national risk assessment tool, and National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines for the prevention of VTE in all hospitalised patients, which will be available in August 2009. Although NICE guidelines are only applicable in England, it is to be hoped Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland will also follow. Despite this, the consensus of expert opinion is that TP needs mandating to prevent pockets of non-adherence. Low molecular weight heparins are currently the gold standard pharmacological agent for TP; but are likely to be superseded within the next 5 years by new classes of oral anticoagulants, such as dabigatran and rivaroxiban, which are already licensed for TP after orthopaedic surgery."
CD008201,0,26414590,0,Venous thromboembolism: identifying patients at risk and establishing prophylaxis.,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality and is associated with substantial healthcare costs. Identification of patients at risk of developing VTE enables appropriate thromboprophylaxis to be implemented. Although no predisposing risk factors can be identified in many patients in whom VTE develops, most have at least one underlying risk factor which can be categorized according to whether it confers low, moderate, or high risk. Clinical trials have demonstrated the effectiveness of thromboprophylaxis, both non-pharmacological and pharmacological, in a host of medical settings and there is sufficient evidence to support routine prophylaxis in many groups of patients. The implementation of decision making tools based on risk factor assessment improves the prescription of appropriate VTE prophylaxis. Nonetheless, thromboprophylaxis is often inadequate, with haphazard risk assessment and application of guidelines, leading to easily preventable instances of VTE. The most commonly used agents for pharmacological thromboprophylaxis of VTE are low dose unfractionated heparin; a low molecular weight heparin such as dalteparin, enoxaparin or tinzaparin; fondaparinux; warfarin; or aspirin. However, these have a number of drawbacks, principally the need for parenteral administration (with heparins) and frequent coagulation monitoring (with warfarin). The optimal anticoagulant would be orally administered, with a wide therapeutic window, rapid onset of action, predictable pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics, minimal interactions with food and other drugs, an ability to inhibit free and clot-bound coagulation factors, low, non-specific binding, and no requirement for routine coagulation monitoring or dose adjustment. A number of novel, single-target oral anticoagulants have been developed that appear to fulfill many of these requirements. This narrative review discusses the use of guidelines and risk assessment tools to identify patients at risk of VTE; it provides an overview of appropriate prophylaxis strategies in these patients with a summary of clinical trial results with novel oral anticoagulants."

Surgery represents one of the most common reasons for premature antiplatelet therapy discontinuation, which is associated with a significant increase in mortality and major adverse cardiac events, in particular stent thrombosis. Clinical practice guidelines provide little support with regard to managing antiplatelet therapy in the perioperative phase in the case of patients with non-deferrable surgical interventions and/or high haemorrhagic risk. Moreover, a standard definition of ischaemic and haemorrhagic risk has never been determined. Finally, recommendations shared by cardiologists, surgeons and anaesthesiologists are lacking. The present consensus document provides practical recommendations on the perioperative management of antiplatelet therapy in patients with coronary stents undergoing surgery. Cardiologists, surgeons and anaesthesiologists have contributed equally to its creation. On the basis of clinical and angiographic data, the individual thrombotic risk has been defined. All surgical interventions have been classified according to their inherent haemorrhagic risk. A consensus on the optimal antiplatelet regimen in the perioperative phase has been reached on the basis of the ischaemic and haemorrhagic risk. Aspirin should be continued perioperatively in the majority of surgical operations, whereas dual antiplatelet therapy should not be withdrawn for surgery in the case of low bleeding risk. In selected patients at high risk for both bleeding and ischaemic events, when oral antiplatelet therapy withdrawal is required, perioperative treatment with short-acting intravenous glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors (tirofiban or eptifibatide) should be taken into consideration."

The incidence of these complications has declined as a result of recent advances in surgical procedures, early postoperative patient mobilization, and prophylactic alternatives. This paper reviews the benefits and disadvantages of current mechanical and pharmacologic thromboprophylactic alternatives, as well as the prophylactic effects of different anesthesia techniques and of presurgical autologous blood donation. The pharmacologic agents that are widely used in North America today include aspirin, warfarin, and low-molecular-weight heparins. The low-molecular-weight heparins-enoxaparin and dalteparin-have recently gained increasing acceptance among orthopedic surgeons. The effectiveness and safety of extending prophylaxis beyond the time of hospital discharge are also discussed. It is concluded that the optimal thromboprophylactic regimen is one that is customized, adjusted according to each patient's risk factors and other characteristics."
CD008201,0,15374018,0,Stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation: physicians' attitudes to anticoagulation in older people.,"The increased prevalence of atrial fibrillation (AF) in older people contributes to an increased risk of stroke. Although clear guidelines exist, there is considerable variation in physicians' approaches to the selection of patients appropriate for warfarin treatment as stroke prevention. We compared attitudes to the anticoagulation of elderly patients with AF, in a postal study of geriatricians and specialist physicians (general physicians with specialist interests in Cardiology, Gastroenterology, Diabetes and Endocrinology, Nephrology and Neurology). A structured questionnaire was mailed to all 108 consultant physicians and geriatricians in South East Wales. This explored their attitude to their patients' age and comorbidity when considering the benefits and risks of warfarin prophylaxis for AF. About 25/30 geriatricians (83%) and 43/78 specialist physicians (55%) responded; an overall response rate of 63%. About 94% of the respondents agreed that patients aged over 75 with atrial fibrillation were at a greater risk of stroke than younger patients. About 68% considered warfarin related bleeds more likely in this age group, despite which most thought that the benefits of warfarin outweighed the risks. In people aged above 75, only 13/25 (52%) geriatricians and 17/43 (40%) specialist physicians viewed lone AF (AF with no underlying risk factor) as an indication for anticoagulation. When considering the use of warfarin, geriatricians' appeared more likely to be influenced by coexisting problems such as disability, falls, cerebrovascular disease and limited life expectancy. Only a history of falls (96% geriatricians vs. 86% specialist physicians) and cerebrovascular disease (79% geriatricians vs. 51% specialist physicians) had a significant influence on prescribing practice (P<0.05, chi(2) test). There appears to be widespread uncertainty about the indications for warfarin as stroke prophylaxis, and ageist attitudes or a lack of conviction of benefit appear to be disadvantaging older people. Patients aged below 65 with lone AF who are at the lowest risk of embolic events are often considered for treatment, whilst the use of warfarin in 75-year-olds with lone AF who are at a moderately high risk of embolic events remains disappointing."

CD008201,0,18278178,0,"Stroke and thromboembolism in atrial fibrillation: a systematic review of stroke risk factors, risk stratification schema and cost effectiveness data.","The risk of stroke in atrial fibrillation (AF) needs to be assessed in each patient to determine the clinical and cost-effectiveness of thromboprophylaxis, with the aim of appropriate use of antithrombotic therapy. To achieve this, stroke risk factors in AF populations need to be identified and stroke risk stratification models have been devised on the basis of these risk factors. In this article, we firstly provide a systematic review of studies examining the attributable stroke risk of various clinical, demographic and echocardiographic patient characteristics in AF populations. Secondly, we performed a systematic review of published stroke risk stratification models, in terms of the results of the review of stroke risk factors and their ability to accurately discriminate between different levels of stroke risk. Thirdly, we review the health economic evidence relating to the cost-effectiveness of anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy as thromboprophylaxis in AF patients. The studies included in the systematic review of stroke risk factors identified history of stroke or TIA, increasing age, hypertension and structural heart disease (left-ventricular dysfunction or hypertrophy) to be good predictors of stroke risk in AF patients. The evidence regarding diabetes mellitus, gender and other patient characteristics was less consistent. Three stroke risk stratification models were identified that were able to discriminate between different categories of stroke risk to at least 95% accuracy. Few models had addressed the cumulative nature of risk factors where a combination of risk factors would confer a greater risk than either factor alone. In patients at high risk of stroke, anticoagulation is cost effective, but not for those with a low risk of stroke. With the evidence available for stroke risk factors and the various alternative stroke risk stratification models, a review of these models in terms of the evidence on which they are devised and their performance in representative AF populations is important. The appropriate administration of thromboprophylaxis in AF patients would need to balance the risks and benefits of antithrombotic therapy with its cost-effectiveness."

CD008201,0,11557249,0,Markers of myocardial damage in acute coronary syndromes--therapeutic implications.,"Patients admitted with suspicion of an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) still constitute a diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic challenge for the treating physician. The final diagnosis ranges from a noncardiac diagnosis to a full-blown myocardial infarction (MI). Biochemical markers of myocardial damage are essential for diagnosis and, especially troponin T and troponin I, have been shown to be valuable for early risk stratification and for selection of treatment in ACS. Patients identified to be at low risk of future cardiac events might be discharged early, and unnecessary investigations and treatments avoided. On the contrary, a more intense treatment can be started in patients identified to be at high risk. Unstable angina patients with, compared to without, elevation of troponin, have a more activated coagulation system and more frequently complex lesions and visible thrombus in their coronary arteries. Accordingly, antithrombotic and antiplatelet therapies, i.e. l.m.w heparin and GP IIb/IIIa receptor antagonists, have been proved to have beneficial effects in troponin positive patients, but little or no beneficial effects in troponin negative patients. Also, the beneficial effects of an invasive compared to a noninvasive approach seem to be much more pronounced in troponin positive patients. In patients with ST-elevation MI, an elevated troponin T level at admission are associated with an increased mortality. However, the therapeutic implications of this finding remain speculative. Patients admitted with chest pain and left bundle branch block (LBBB) and who develop an MI have a poor prognosis. Current guidelines in acute myocardial infarction state that these patients should receive thrombolysis. Despite that, only a minority of these patients do receive thrombolysis, most probably because of the great diagnostic uncertainty. Rapid testing with a cardiac marker, e.g. myoglobin, would most probably increase the proportion of patients with chest pain and LBBB who receive appropriate reperfusion treatment."
CD008201,0,15485112,0,Risk factors for osteoporosis in female patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.,"In the last years it has been recognized that patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are at high risk of osteoporosis (OP) and fractures, both occurring through disease-specific (chronic arthritis, reduced physical activity, induction of cytokines promoting bone resorption, renal impairment, endocrine factors) and nondisease-specific mechanisms (sunshine avoidance with consequent vitamin D deficiency, glucocorticoids, immunosuppressants and chronic anticoagulants). Regarding anticoagulants, subcutaneous heparin is crucial against the risk of recurrent thromboembolism or pregnancy loss, specifically in patients with SLE and anti-phospholipid syndrome (APS). Thus heparin-induced OP represents one of the hazards of this treatment, first because heparin must be used long-term and secondly because pregnancy and lactation themselves may predispose to OP and fractures. Current data suggest the use of prophylaxis with calcium and vitamin D in all patients treated with heparin during pregnancy. Nevertheless glucocorticoid-induced OP (GIOP) is considered the most serious risk factor for OP and fractures in SLE patients. All guidelines recommend general measures and supplementation with calcium and vitamin D in all patients. However when considering premenopausal patients, there is no generally recommended treatment. Bisphosphonates, which are considered the first choice therapy for the prevention and treatment of GIOP, should be used 'cautiously' in these patients. Therefore the potential risks and lack of efficacy data on fracture risk reduction in premenopausal patients must be weighed against their proven efficacy in postmenopausal patients."

From January 2000 until December 2005, there were 42 patients admitted with MPM for further intervention at our institution. Thirty patients were suitable for surgery and thus received a multimodal treatment with neo-adjuvant chemotherapy using Cisplatin and Gemcitabin (Gemzar), EPP followed by 54 Gray (Gy) adjuvant radiotherapy. Data were collected from the surgical and oncological records. There were 37 male patients (88%), the median age was 65 years (range 40-83 years). Seven (17%) patients had concomitant diseases. Forty patients (95%) had asbestos exposition. The operative procedures were EPP with muscle flap through an anterolateral thoracotomy. Univariate and multivariate analyses were done. One patient (3%) died on the 2nd postoperative day due to lung embolism. Mild complications were noticed in the early postoperative phase in 8 (25%) patients. There was no early or late stump insufficiency during the 15-month follow-up. Surgical techniques using muscle flap seems to play a major role in the prevention of bronchus stump insufficiency especially after neo-adjuvant chemotherapy."

CD008201,0,7937602,0,[Hepatocellular carcinoma: treatment with arterial chemo-embolization].,"Due to extensive tumoural invasion, less than 10% of the patients with hepatocellular carcinoma can benefit from surgery. A variety of proposed palliative procedures, including general chemotherapy and radiotherapy, have given quite less than satisfactory results. Percutaneous alcoolization and hormone therapy are currently being evaluated. Increased use of intra-arterial embolization has developed over the last 10 years, initially in Asia and now in Europe. The aim of intra-arterial chemotherapy is to increase the concentration of anticancer agents within the tumour. Adding lipiodol with certain agents would increase the duration of cancer cell exposure. Arterial embolization aims at creating tumour necrosis by ischaemia and relies on the fact that the main blood supply from hepatocellular carcinomas comes from arteries while non-tumoural hepatic tissue is supplied by the portal vein. Numerous reports on intra-arterial treatment protocols combining chemotherapy and embolization have demonstrated that this technique can produce partial or total tumour necrosis. However, due to the variable nature of the natural history of hepatocellular carcinoma the clinically beneficial effect in terms of survival rate has not been established and would not appear to be highly significant, probably due to chemoresistance which cannot be overcome by intra-arterial administration. Indeed, the necrotic effect appears to result from hepatic embolization itself. In two randomized studies necrosis was significantly greater in patients who underwent repeated embolizations than in those receiving general or intra-arterial chemotherapy. It is generally accepted that intra-arterial chemoembolization is contraindicated in cases of portal thrombosis or major liver failure. In addition, each procedure requires at least one week hospitalization with the inherent effect on patient comfort and quality of life. Nevertheless, should intra-arterial, chemoembolization be abandoned? Probably not because there is no alternative method, at least for inoperable patients. Efforts should be made to improve the technique which should be reserved for carefully selected patients. New, more liposoluble drugs and possible combinations with glycoprotein inhibitors could be studied. Until an effective treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma has been developed, the role of palliative care must be evaluated in terms of survival rate, cost and quality of life."

New protocols have been suggested to overcome the main limitations of stenting, namely subacute stent thrombosis, local vascular complications, and the length of hospitalization. In this report we describe our current results with coronary stenting in 100 patients: we modified our standard protocol and used high pressure noncompliant balloons to expand the stent, added ticlopidine to some of the patients to inhibit platelet activity, and used the transradial approach in some patients to reduce the risk of vascular complications. These results were compared to those obtained in our initial group of 50 patients in whom we used a standard implantation protocol. Subacute thrombosis occurred in one patient in the current group of patients compared to five patients in our early experience (P = 0.026). There was no change in local vascular complications. This preliminary report shows that subacute thrombosis can almost be eliminated by the new stent implantation protocols. Less aggressive anticoagulation and radial artery catheterization can decrease vascular complications."

CD008201,0,15252738,0,"Clinical use and rational management of homocysteine, folic acid, and B vitamins in cardiovascular and thrombotic diseases.","About half of all deaths are due to cardiovascular disease and its complications. The economic burden on society and the healthcare system from cardiovascular disability, complications, and treatments is huge and becoming larger in the rapidly aging populations of developed countries. As conventional risk factors fail to account for part of the cases, homocysteine, a ""new"" risk factor, is being viewed with mounting interest. Homocysteine is a sulfur-containing intermediate product in the normal metabolism of methionine, an essential amino acid. Folic acid, vitamin B(12), and vitamin B(6) deficiency and reduced enzyme activities inhibit the breakdown of homocysteine, thus increasing the intracellular homocysteine concentration. Numerous retrospective and prospective studies have consistently found an independent relationship between mild hyperhomocysteinemia and cardiovascular disease or all-cause mortality. Starting at a plasma homocysteine concentration of approximately 10 micromol/l, the risk increase follows a linear dose-response relationship with no specific threshold level. Hyperhomocysteinemia as an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease is thought to be responsible for about 10 percent of total risk. Elevated plasma homocysteine levels (> 12 micromol/l; moderate hyperhomocysteinemia) are considered cytotoxic and are found in 5 to 10 percent of the general population and in up to 40 percent of patients with vascular disease. Additional risk factors (smoking, arterial hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia) may additively or, by interacting with homocysteine, synergistically (and hence overproportionally) increase overall risk. Hyperhomocysteinemia is associated with alterations in vascular morphology, loss of endothelial antithrombotic function, and induction of a procoagulant environment. Most known forms of damage or injury are due to homocysteine-mediated oxidative stresses. Especially when acting as direct or indirect antagonists of cofactors and enzyme activities, numerous agents, drugs, diseases, and life style factors have an impact on homocysteine metabolism. Folic acid deficiency is considered the most common cause of hyperhomocysteinemia. An adequate intake of at least 400 microg of folate per day is difficult to maintain even with a balanced diet, and high-risk groups often find it impossible to meet these folate requirements. Based on the available evidence, there is an increasing call for the diagnosis and treatment of elevated homocysteine levels in high-risk individuals in general and patients with manifest vascular disease in particular. Subjects of both populations should first have a baseline homocysteine assay. Except where manifestations are already present, intervention, if any, should be guided by the severity of hyperhomocysteinemia. Consistent with other working parties and consensus groups, we recommend a target plasma homocysteine level of < 10 micromol/l. Based on various calculation models, reduction of elevated plasma homocysteine concentrations may theoretically prevent up to 25 percent of cardiovascular events. Supplementation is inexpensive, potentially effective, and devoid of adverse effects and, therefore, has an exceptionally favorable benefit/risk ratio. The results of ongoing randomized controlled intervention trials must be available before screening for and treatment of hyperhomocysteinemia can be recommended for the apparently healthy general population."

CD008201,0,24076493,0,Consensus and update on the definition of on-treatment platelet reactivity to adenosine diphosphate associated with ischemia and bleeding.,"Dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and a P2Y12 receptor blocker is a key strategy to reduce platelet reactivity and to prevent thrombotic events in patients treated with percutaneous coronary intervention. In an earlier consensus document, we proposed cutoff values for high on-treatment platelet reactivity to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) associated with post-percutaneous coronary intervention ischemic events for various platelet function tests (PFTs). Updated American and European practice guidelines have issued a Class IIb recommendation for PFT to facilitate the choice of P2Y12 receptor inhibitor in selected high-risk patients treated with percutaneous coronary intervention, although routine testing is not recommended (Class III). Accumulated data from large studies underscore the importance of high on-treatment platelet reactivity to ADP as a prognostic risk factor. Recent prospective randomized trials of PFT did not demonstrate clinical benefit, thus questioning whether treatment modification based on the results of current PFT platforms can actually influence outcomes. However, there are major limitations associated with these randomized trials. In addition, recent data suggest that low on-treatment platelet reactivity to ADP is associated with a higher risk of bleeding. Therefore, a therapeutic window concept has been proposed for P2Y12 inhibitor therapy. In this updated consensus document, we review the available evidence addressing the relation of platelet reactivity to thrombotic and bleeding events. In addition, we propose cutoff values for high and low on-treatment platelet reactivity to ADP that might be used in future investigations of personalized antiplatelet therapy."
CD008201,0,18064317,0,Venous thromboembolism in patients undergoing surgery: low rates of prophylaxis and high rates of filter insertion.,"Patients who undergo surgery are at a high risk of developing venous thromboembolism (VTE). To further define the demographics, comorbidities, and risk factors of VTE in patients undergoing major surgery, we analyzed 1,375 hospitalized non-orthopedic surgery patients in a prospective registry of 5,451 patients with ultrasound confirmed deep vein thrombosis (DVT) from 183 hospitals in the United States. Extremity edema (67.9%), extremity discomfort (44.9%), and dyspnea (18.9%) were among the most common presenting symptoms among these surgical patients. Compared to medical patients, surgical patients presented with a more occult clinical picture and complained less often of extremity edema (67.9% vs. 73.7%; p = 0.0001), extremity discomfort (44.9% vs. 56.4%; p < 0.0001), or difficulty walking (6.6% vs. 11.2%; p < 0.0001). Immobility within 30 days of DVT diagnosis, prior hospitalization within 30 days of DVT diagnosis, presence of an indwelling central venous catheter, obesity (BMI>30 kg/m2), and previous smoking were the most commonVTE risk factors among surgical patients. Among surgical patients who developed DVT, some form of prophylaxis had been used in only 44%. Once diagnosed with DVT, surgical patients received IVC filters more often than medical patients (20.0% vs. 14.1%; p < 0.0001; adjusted OR = 1.49, 95% CI = 1.17-1.92; p < 0.001). In conclusion, VTE prophylaxis remains underutilized in surgical patients. The IVC filter utilization rate in surgical patients is significantly higher than in medical patients. Future studies should focus on devising mechanisms to improve implementation of prophylaxis and investigate the long-term safety and efficacy of IVC filters in surgical patients."

PCI guidelines advocate the use of distal embolic protection devices, when technically feasible, in patients undergoing PCI for SVG disease. To date, alternative management strategies are not fully investigated. We report a case of an 84-year-old male patient with acute coronary syndrome who underwent PCI for a quite occlusive stenosis of an SVG on the first diagonal branch of the left anterior descending artery complicated by wide endoluminal thrombosis with poor antegrade coronary blood flow and absent opacity of the distal first diagonal vessel. A strategy of delayed PCI after upstream, 48 h long tirofiban administration in order to obtain a thrombus burden reduction was decided. After tirofiban administration, a high-level thrombus resolution was obtained, with a significant improvement in coronary flow, and a successful PCI with stenting was performed. There was neither clinical nor instrumental periprocedural sign of ischemia, and the patient remained asymptomatic throughout his hospital stay. Preprocedural tirofiban administration followed by PCI with stenting of an SVG thrombotic lesion without a distal protection device might be a well-tolerated and feasible option for patients with degenerated SVG disease. Further studies are needed to further expand our findings."
CD008201,0,26729187,0,Prevention and Treatment of Venous Thromboembolism in Patients with Cancer: Focus on Drug Therapy.,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a frequent complication in patients with cancer and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The use of anticoagulants for the prevention and treatment of VTE in this population is challenging given the high risk of both recurrent VTE and bleeding complications. Thromboprophylaxis with subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is recommended in cancer patients hospitalized for an acute medical illness and in those undergoing major surgery. In ambulatory cancer patients with or without central venous catheters, routine thromboprophylaxis is not recommended because of the relatively low benefit-to-risk ratio. To identify cancer outpatients at very high risk of VTE who may benefit from thromboprophylaxis, VTE risk stratification tools based on tumour type, clinical parameters, or coagulation biomarkers have been proposed, but their clinical utility needs validation. The mainstay of treatment for cancer-associated VTE is LMWH for at least 6 months or longer in case of active disease. The same initial and long-term treatment for incidental VTE as for symptomatic VTE can be suggested while awaiting additional studies in this area."

Two NHS teaching hospitals were studied for 24 months from January 2003. Patients were risk stratified according to the THRIFT (thromboembolic risk factor) consensus group guidelines and compared with the recommendations of the THRIFT and ACCP (American College of Chest Physicians) consensus groups. Six months following presentation of the initial results, a further analysis was made to assess changes in clinical practice. 1128 patients were assessed of whom 1062 satisfied the inclusion criteria for thromboprophylaxis. 89% of all patients were stratified as having high or moderate risk of developing VTE. Of these only 28% were prescribed some form of thromboprophylaxis-4% received the THRIFT-recommended and 22% received the ACCP-recommended thromboprophylaxis. The vast majority (72%) received no thromboprophylaxis at all. Reassessment, following data presentation at grand rounds, showed a significant increase to 31% inpatients receiving THRIFT (P<0.0001) and ACCP (P=0.002) recommended thromboprophylaxis. However,the proportion of patients receiving no form of prophylaxis barely changed (72% to 69%: P=0.59). We found a gross underutilization of thromboprophylaxis in hospitalized medical patients. A simple grand-round presentation of the data and recommended guidelines to clinicians significantly increased the proportion of patients receiving recommended thromboprophylaxis but did not increase the overall proportion of patients receiving it. We therefore conclude that a single presentation of guidelines is not enough to achieve the desired levels. Such presentations may only serve to make DVT (deep venous thromboembolism) aware clinicians prescribe prophylaxis more accurately."

The importance of thrombophilia screening.,"Venous thromboembolism is a chronic disease with an annual incidence of recurrence of 5 to 10%. Patients with venous thrombosis should be treated with anticoagulants for at least 3 months. The optimal duration of anticoagulation entails balancing the risk of recurrence against the risk of treatment-associated bleeding. Candidates for extended anticoagulation are patients with a high risk of recurrence. The risk of recurrence is increased in patients with antithrombin deficiency, the lupus anticoagulant, homozygous F V Leiden, combined defects, high F VIII, high F IX, high TAFI, hyperhomocysteinemia or more than one episode of thrombosis. The risk of recurrence is low in patients with venous thrombosis secondary to surgery or trauma. Routine thrombophilia screening is aimed at identifying patients who could benefit from extended anticoagulation. This population consists of patients with venous thrombosis at a young age, an unprovoked episode of venous thrombosis, patients with a strong positive family history or patients with recurrent venous thrombosis. Screening should comprise antithrombin determination and the search for the lupus anticoagulant. Patients harbouring one of these defects are at high risk of recurrence and most likely will profit from prolonged anticoagulation. The clinical relevance of new treatment strategies such as extended low-intensity warfarin or administration of the direct thrombin inhibitor (xi-)melagatran is at present unclear."

On average patients were interviewed 38 days following surgery with a focus on low molecular weight heparins. The analysis showed that nearly 90% of patients need to carry out thrombosis prophylaxis in an outpatient or home environment for at least 1 day and for 47.2% of patients a linking period between acute and rehabilitation stay is relevant. The obviously existing quantitative importance of outpatient thrombosis prophylaxis is also reflected by its duration and 45.7% of interviewed patients needed at least 5 days of outpatient prophylaxis.Outpatient thrombosis prophylaxis clearly makes high demands on the patients, in particular when combined with the task of administering complex forms of injections. Those involved in inpatient and outpatient provision of care should not assume that all patients carry out the necessary prophylaxis at the required level of reliability.

For pregnant women with acute VTE, we recommend that subcutaneous LMWH or UFH should be continued throughout pregnancy (Grade 1B) and suggest that anticoagulants should be continued for at least 6 weeks postpartum (for a total minimum duration of therapy of 6 months) [Grade 2C]. For pregnant patients with a single prior episode of VTE associated with a transient risk factor that is no longer present and no thrombophilia, we recommend clinical surveillance antepartum and anticoagulant prophylaxis postpartum (Grade 1C). For other pregnant women with a history of a single prior episode of VTE who are not receiving long-term anticoagulant therapy, we recommend one of the following, rather than routine care or full-dose anticoagulation: antepartum prophylactic LMWH/UFH or intermediate-dose LMWH/UFH or clinical surveillance throughout pregnancy plus postpartum anticoagulants (Grade 1C). For such patients with a higher risk thrombophilia, in addition to postpartum prophylaxis, we suggest antepartum prophylactic or intermediate-dose LMWH or prophylactic or intermediate-dose UFH, rather than clinical surveillance (Grade 2C). We suggest that pregnant women with multiple episodes of VTE who are not receiving long-term anticoagulants receive antepartum prophylactic, intermediate-dose, or adjusted-dose LMWH or intermediate or adjusted-dose UFH, followed by postpartum anticoagulants (Grade 2C). For those pregnant women with prior VTE who are receiving long-term anticoagulants, we recommend LMWH or UFH throughout pregnancy (either adjusted-dose LMWH or UFH, 75% of adjusted-dose LMWH, or intermediate-dose LMWH) followed by resumption of long-term anticoagulants postpartum (Grade 1C). We suggest both antepartum and postpartum prophylaxis for pregnant women with no prior history of VTE but antithrombin deficiency (Grade 2C). For all other pregnant women with thrombophilia but no prior VTE, we suggest antepartum clinical surveillance or prophylactic LMWH or UFH, plus postpartum anticoagulants, rather than routine care (Grade 2C). For women with recurrent early pregnancy loss or unexplained late pregnancy loss, we recommend screening for antiphospholipid antibodies (APLAs) [Grade 1A]. For women with these pregnancy complications who test positive for APLAs and have no history of venous or arterial thrombosis, we recommend antepartum administration of prophylactic or intermediate-dose UFH or prophylactic LMWH combined with aspirin (Grade 1B). We recommend that the decision about anticoagulant management during pregnancy for pregnant women with mechanical heart valves include an assessment of additional risk factors for thromboembolism including valve type, position, and history of thromboembolism (Grade 1C). While patient values and preferences are important for all decisions regarding antithrombotic therapy in pregnancy, this is particularly so for women with mechanical heart valves. For these women, we recommend either adjusted-dose bid LMWH throughout pregnancy (Grade 1C), adjusted-dose UFH throughout pregnancy (Grade 1C), or one of these two regimens until the thirteenth week with warfarin substitution until close to delivery before restarting LMWH or UFH) [Grade 1C]. However, if a pregnant woman with a mechanical heart valve is judged to be at very high risk of thromboembolism and there are concerns about the efficacy and safety of LMWH or UFH as dosed above, we suggest vitamin K antagonists throughout pregnancy with replacement by UFH or LMWH close to delivery, after a thorough discussion of the potential risks and benefits of this approach (Grade 2C)."
CD008201,0,18832911,0,Efficacy and safety of once daily low molecular weight heparin (tinzaparin sodium) in high risk pregnancy.,"Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is widely regarded as the anticoagulant treatment of choice for the prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism during pregnancy. However, previous studies have demonstrated that the pharmacokinetic profiles of LMWH vary significantly with increasing gestation. Consequently, it remains unclear whether LMWH regimens recommended for use in nonpregnant individuals can be safely extrapolated to pregnant women. The aims of this study were to assess the safety and the efficacy of tinzaparin sodium (Innohep) administered only once daily during pregnancy. A systematic retrospective review identified a cohort of 37 high-risk pregnancies which had been managed using tinzaparin 175 IU/kg once daily. In 26 cases, the index pregnancy had been complicated by development of an acute venous thromboembolism (17 deep vein thrombosis and nine pulmonary embolism). For each individual, case notes were examined and data extracted using a predetermined questionnaire. No episodes of recurrent venous thromboembolism were identified amongst this cohort of pregnancies managed using once daily LMWH administration. However, two unusual thrombotic complications were observed, including a parietal infarct in one patient, and a postpartum cerebral venous thrombosis in another. Once daily tinzaparin was well tolerated, with no cases of heparin-induced thrombocytopaenia, symptomatic osteoporosis, or foetal malformations. Tinzaparin dose modification based upon peak anti-Xa levels occurred in 45% of the cases examined. The present study is the largest study to have examined the clinical efficacy of once daily LMWH for use in pregnant women at high risk of venous thromboembolism. Our data support the safety and efficacy of antenatal tinzaparin at a dose of 175 IU/kg. In order to determine whether this once daily regimen provides equivalent (or indeed greater) thromboprophylaxis to twice daily LMWH regimens during pregnancy will require highly powered direct comparative studies."
CD008201,0,20822807,0,Antiphospholipid syndrome.,"The antiphospholipid syndrome causes venous, arterial, and small-vessel thrombosis; pregnancy loss; and preterm delivery for patients with severe pre-eclampsia or placental insufficiency. Other clinical manifestations are cardiac valvular disease, renal thrombotic microangiopathy, thrombocytopenia, haemolytic anaemia, and cognitive impairment. Antiphospholipid antibodies promote activation of endothelial cells, monocytes, and platelets; and overproduction of tissue factor and thromboxane A2. Complement activation might have a central pathogenetic role. Of the different antiphospholipid antibodies, lupus anticoagulant is the strongest predictor of features related to antiphospholipid syndrome. Therapy of thrombosis is based on long-term oral anticoagulation and patients with arterial events should be treated aggressively. Primary thromboprophylaxis is recommended in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and probably in purely obstetric antiphospholipid syndrome. Obstetric care is based on combined medical-obstetric high-risk management and treatment with aspirin and heparin. Hydroxychloroquine is a potential additional treatment for this syndrome. Possible future therapies for non-pregnant patients with antiphospholipid syndrome are statins, rituximab, and new anticoagulant drugs."

Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) offers advantages in the method of administration, but it has not been evaluated in severe ulcerative colitis. We therefore assessed the tolerability, safety and potential therapeutical effects of LMWH in hospitalized patients with steroid refractory ulcerative colitis."
CD008201,0,19371871,0,Haemodynamically unstable pelvic fractures.,"Bleeding pelvic fractures that result in haemodynamic instability have a reported mortality rate as high as 40%. Because of the extreme force needed to disrupt the pelvic ring, associated injuries are common and mortality is usually from uncontrolled haemorrhage from extra-pelvic sources. Identifying and controlling all sources of bleeding is a complex challenge and is best managed by a multi-disciplinary team, which include trauma surgeons, orthopaedic surgeons and interventional radiologists. Once the pelvis is identified as the major source of haemorrhage, component therapy reconstituting whole blood should be used and the pelvic region wrapped circumferentially with a sheet or pelvic binder. Patients at risk for arterial bleeding who continue to show haemodynamic instability despite resuscitative efforts should undergo immediate arteriography and embolisation of bleeding pelvic vessels. If this is unavailable or delayed, or the patient has other injuries (i.e., head, chest, intra-abdominal, long bone), external fixation and pelvic packing, performed concomitantly with other life-saving procedures, may be used to further reduce pelvic venous bleeding. If however, the patient remains haemodynamically labile without apparent source of blood loss, transcatheter angiographic embolisation should be attempted to locate and stop pelvic arterial bleeding. Institutional practice guidelines have been shown to reduce mortality and should be developed by all centres treating pelvic fractures."

CD008201,0,16757417,0,Safety of dalteparin for the prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism in elderly medical patients with renal insufficiency: a pilot study.,"The aim of this prospective cohort study was to determine the incidence of dalteparin bioaccumulation (measured using anti-Xa levels), and bleeding during thromboprophylaxis in elderly patients with renal failure who were admitted to hospital with an acute medical illness. Patients who met the criteria for being at high thromboembolic risk received dalteparin 5,000 IU subcutaneously once daily while the other patients (low risk) received 2,500 IU daily. Thromboprophylaxis was administered for at least 6 days. Anti-Xa activity was determined before the first dalteparin dose and again on day 6, 4 hours after the administration of the dalteparin dose. Bleeding was assessed daily. Compression ultrasonography was performed to identify any deep vein thromboses. There was no evidence of bioaccumulation on day 6 of therapy, irrespective of renal function. No episodes of major bleeding or venous thromboembolism occurred. Larger, randomized studies are warranted to confirm the safety of dalteparin in this patient population."
CD008201,0,19587584,0,Use of deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis in hospitalized cancer patients.,"Venous thromboembolism is a common complication and a major cause of morbidity and mortality in cancer patients. Patients with malignancies have a four-fold greater risk of venous thromboembolism compared with patients without malignancies. Underuse of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis persists, despite guidelines supporting its use in hospitalized cancer patients. This study was conducted to evaluate the use of DVT prophylaxis and its appropriateness in hospitalized cancer patients. This retrospective study included cancer patients admitted to Rafik Hariri University Hospital, a tertiary referral center in Beirut, Lebanon, over 2-month period, who were hospitalized for at least 2 days. We evaluated the use of anticoagulants for DVT prophylaxis in the absence of contraindications for their use. The risk factor profiles of the patients were reported in addition to the choice of the anticoagulant and the use of mechanical prophylaxis in patients with contraindications to anticoagulation. One hundred and thirty patients were studied out of which 34 (26.2%) had contraindications to anticoagulation use. In addition, 21 patients out of 95 (22.1%) who qualified for DVT prophylaxis received pharmacologic DVT prophylaxis. Enoxaparin was the most frequently prescribed anticoagulant (76.2% of the patients). Of those who received anticoagulation, only 47.6% received appropriate agent and dose. Among patients with contraindications to anticoagulation, only three (8.8%) received mechanical devices as nonpharmacologic DVT prophylaxis. DVT prophylaxis in hospitalized cancer patients is significantly underutilized. Several options are available to increase physicians' awareness of the problem."

We studied 212 RRMM patients who received RD in RW. Objective response (≥PR (partial response)) rate was 77.4 % (complete response (CR), 20.2 %). Median time to first and best response was 2 and 5 months, respectively. Median time to CR when RD was given as 2nd or >2(nd)-line treatment at 4 and 11 months, respectively. Quality of response was independent of previous lines of therapies or previous exposure to thalidomide or bortezomib. Median duration of response was 34.4 months, and it was higher in patients who received RD until progression (not reached versus 19 months, p < 0.001). Improvement of humoral immunity occurred in 60 % of responders (p < 0.001) and in the majority of patients who achieved stable disease. Adverse events were reported in 68.9 % of patients (myelosuppression in 49.4 %) and 12.7 % of patients needed hospitalization. Peripheral neuropathy was observed only in 2.5 % of patients and deep vein thrombosis in 5.7 %. Dose reductions were needed in 31 % of patients and permanent discontinuation in 38.9 %. Median time to treatment discontinuation was 16.8 months. Performance status (PS) and initial lenalidomide dose predicted for treatment discontinuation. Extra-medullary relapses occurred in 3.8 % of patients. Our study confirms that RD is effective and safe in RRMM in the RW; it produces durable responses especially in patients who continue on treatment till progression and improves humoral immunity even in patients with stable disease."
CD008201,0,15334760,0,Mechanical circulatory support: reality and dreams experience of a single center.,"Because of the increasing number of patients waiting for heart transplantation and the decreasing number of donor organs, mechanical circulatory support has become a generally accepted therapeutic option. Several high-tech devices developed in the last 15 years differ in terms of location, kind of support, and driving units. They are suitable for different patients and their therapeutics objectives. Based on 13 years of experience, we developed a specific protocol for selection and management of patients and devices. Six hundred two patients have received mechanical circulatory support (MCS) in our institution since 1987. The indication spectrum includes cardiogenic shock for various reasons: acute myocarditis, right heart failure, acute rejection and postcardiotomy heart failure, alternative to transplantation, and bridge to recovery. Eight different systems are in use at our center. The extracorporeal devices, the Biomedicus centrifugal pump (n = 169) and the Abiomed BVS 5000 (n = 92) are used for short-term support. The Thoratec VAD (n = 179), and Medos HIA-VAD (n = 10) located in paracorporeal position preferably used for midterm support. Novacor LVAS (n= 96), and HeartMate (n = 58) are partially implantable systems used for long-term ventricular assistance in patients who did not require biventricular support. The advantage of the implantable devices is the option of discharging patients under support if they fulfill special criteria before being discharged to home. Eighty-five LVAD patients were discharged home with support, Novacor (n = 52), HeartMate (n = 27), ThoratecTLC-II (n = 8), Lionheart (n = 3) fulfill our criteria for being discharged home while on support. Careful postoperative patient management does not exclude a variety of complications. Bleeding: occurred in 22-35% of patients, right heart failure in 15-26%, neurologic disorder in 7-28%, infection in 7-30%, and liver failure in 11-20%. Complications varied with different devices, and the patients' preoperative conditions. Eighty-five patients fulfilled the criteria of our out of hospital program (OOH) and were discharged from hospital for a mean period of 184 days. Readmission was necessary for complications caused by thromboembolism and infection. This report describes our patient device selection criteria as a bridge to transplant setting."

Although recent data support the benefit of pharmacological thromboembolic prophylaxis, the optimal starting point for the different neurosurgical procedures remains unclear because the potentially devastating consequences of intracranial or intraspinal haemorrhage could easily offset the reduction in thromboembolic morbidity and mortality resulting from pharmacological thromboembolic prophylaxis. The objective of our study was to assess the use of pharmacological methods of thromboembolic prophylaxis in contemporary German neurosurgery using a postal survey in 34 neurosurgical departments. Low-dose heparin or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) were used in 88% to 97% of neurosurgical units participating in our survey. In craniotomies, in 2 units (6%) heparin or LMWH was routinely started before surgery, in 10 units (29%) < 8 hours after surgery, in 15 units (44%) < 24 hours after surgery, in one unit at the second day and in 5 units at the third day after surgery. Data for burr hole craniotomy or spinal surgery were similar. In our survey a high rate of perioperative use of pharmacological thromboembolic prophylaxis was found. However, given the data from the literature, the optimum protocol remains unclear."

A senior surgeon identified the adverse events by reviewing the complete record with a minimal 6-months follow-up for every patient attending the emergency unit during a 10-week period. To test the reliability of this review, a blind re-review of all records corresponding to the detected adverse events, mixed with an equal number of controls, was carried out by two independent experts. The review of the 2604 records identified 210 medical adverse events, most of them occurring early in the care process. Sixty-seven per cent of the adverse events involved prevention failure, mainly for tetanus but also for thrombosis and rabies. For the other 33% it was possible to determine two situations with a high risk of adverse event: body contusions following a traffic accident and metacarpo-phalangeal thumb sprains. The re-review evaluated the positive predictive value of the initial review to be 97.5% and its negative predictive value to be 96%. It is concluded that the review of the initial record by a single senior is effective in detecting the adverse events. Prevention of two-thirds of them could be possible by the implementation and monitoring of protocols."

NICE and SIGN guidelines therefore recommend that all hospitalised patients are risk assessed for venous thromboembolism. The guidelines would recommend using pharmacological thromboprophylaxis for all patients aged 60 and above with reduced mobility and acute medical illness unless obvious contra-indications exist. Meta-analysis data regarding pharmacological thromboprophylaxis for medical patients demonstrate reductions in asymptomatic deep vein thrombosis (DVT) rather than fatal pulmonary embolism and mortality. There is also the potential for increased bleeding risk with this approach. Evidence for older medical in-patients, particularly those aged over 75, is more limited being derived from subgroup analyses of larger clinical trials. In addition, based on exclusion criteria such as increased bleeding risk, frailer older adults were unlikely to have been included within such trials. This commentary will (i) critically appraise available data on the incidence of DVT and PE in older hospitalised patients; (ii) review the evidence available from meta-analyses and subgroup analyses in older medical in-patients for the use of venous thromboembolism prophylaxis; (iii) discuss those situations out-with the guidelines where venous thromboprophylaxis may not be appropriate and even potentially harmful in this patient group and (iv) suggest future research directions."

Current guidelines do not recommend routine prophylaxis against venous thromboembolism (VTE) in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy, but the risk increases about 6.5-fold because of this treatment. D-dimer was measured at baseline in 124 cancer patients scheduled for their first chemotherapy. VTE events, including symptomatic episodes of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism or both, were recorded during the first 6 months of therapy, and asymptomatic deep vein thrombosis was revealed by compression ultrasonography at baseline and after 90 and 180 days. During follow-up, there were 11 episodes of VTE (8.9%). Mean D-dimer values were higher in patients with VTE (2195 +/- 1382 vs. 695 +/- 1039 ng/ml, (P < 0.001). On grouping D-dimer values in tertiles, only 2.4% (confidence interval, 0.9-5.7%) in the first (<262 ng/ml) and second tertiles (262-650 ng/ml) suffered a deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism event as compared with 22% (confidence interval, 9-34%) in the third (>650 ng/dl) (P = 0.003).

Beside new more convenient anticoagulant agents, the exclusion of the left atrial appendage recognized as main source of thrombi, may be an alternative in patients with both high risk of thrombotic and haemorrhagic events. Surgical experience showed that the results depend on the quality of the exclusion. For over the past 10 years, several percutaneous exclusion systems of the left atrial appendage have been developed. A randomized study (PROTECT AF) demonstrated the non-inferiority of the percutaneous exclusion in comparison with the warfarin. However, the place of this interventional therapy remains to be clarified, particularly the definition of the target population. This often multidisciplinary approach will have to be accompanied by a reduction of periprocedural complications, increase in rate of complete occlusion, and enough long clinical follow-up to assess the efficiency of this strategy."
CD008201,0,8129253,0,Surgical prophylaxis for pulmonary embolism.,"The trauma patient population is at special risk for fatal pulmonary embolism. We experienced 11 fatalities in one 12-month period. Specific risk factors for both deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism can be identified among trauma patients. The latter usually cannot be offered prophylactic anticoagulation, and the nature of their injuries (e.g., long bone fractures) makes not only bedside surveillance difficult but also precludes use of pneumatic compression, etc. We have developed a protocol for prophylactic inferior vena caval filtration for our trauma patients deemed at particular risk for pulmonary embolism. Since 1986 we have inserted 205 Greenfield filters in 201 patients. Two hundred were inserted prophylactically. There was no mortality, and morbidity was minimal. No patient with a Greenfield filter sustained a fatal pulmonary embolism during this period. Four patients died from pulmonary embolism before vena caval filters could be inserted. We believe that the trauma patient, at risk for pulmonary embolism, should be offered a Greenfield filter prophylactically as soon after hospitalization as logistically possible."

CD008201,0,26603795,0,Fast-track rapid warfarin reversal for elective surgery: extending the efficacy profile to high-risk patients with cancer.,"Periprocedural management of patients on long-term warfarin therapy remains a common and important clinical issue, with little high-quality data to guide this complex process. The current accepted practice is cessation of warfarin five days preoperatively, but this is not without risk and can be complicated, particularly if bridging is required. An alternative method utilising low-dose intravenous vitamin K the day before surgery has been shown previously to be efficacious, safe and convenient in an elective surgical population receiving chronic warfarin therapy. The efficacy and utility of this 'fast-track' warfarin reversal protocol in surgical patients with cancer, who were at high risk of both thromboembolism and bleeding was investigated in a prospective, single-arm study at a dedicated cancer centre. Seventy-one patients underwent 82 episodes of fast-track warfarin reversal (3 mg intravenous vitamin K 18 to 24 hours before surgery). No patient suffered an adverse reaction to intravenous vitamin K, all but one achieved an International Normalized Ratio =1.5 on the day of surgery, and no surgery was deferred. Assays of vitamin K-dependent factor levels pre- and post-vitamin K demonstrated restoration of functional activity to within an acceptable range for surgical haemostasis. While this alternative method requires further validation in a larger prospective randomised study, we have now extended our use of fast-track warfarin reversal using vitamin K to patients with cancer, on the basis of our experience of its safety, convenience, reliability and efficacy."
CD008201,0,18687764,0,Venous thromboembolism in women.,"The risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) varies throughout a woman's life and is associated primarily with underlying hormonal exposure. Alteration in hemostatic mechanisms, including resistance to activated protein C, may explain this altered risk. Initially, development of VTE with the use of contraception in young adulthood may reveal inherited thrombophilia. Pregnancy, and particularly the post-partum period, likely confer the greatest risk of VTE, but the absolute risk is small. Guidelines for prevention of VTE during pregnancy are based on personal or family history of VTE, and known inherited thrombophilia. Use of hormone replacement therapy later in life is associated with increased risk of VTE, and may be safest if given as an estrogen-only preparation to young postmenopausal women for less than 5 years. Universal screening for thrombophilia prior to pregnancy or initiating hormonal therapy is not recommended; however, selected testing in high-risk groups may be warranted. The lack of firm recommendations for the prevention of VTE in women highlights the need for future investigation aimed at identifying high-risk groups and evaluating the efficacy of prophylactic measures."
CD008201,0,22826444,0,Relevance of immobility and importance of risk assessment management for medically ill patients.,"Recent or continued immobility is a significant risk factor for venous thromboembolism (VTE) in acutely ill medical patients. Patients may benefit from thromboprophylaxis; however, its optimal duration remains unclear. The Extended Clinical Prophylaxis in Acutely Ill Medical Patients (EXCLAIM) study was the first trial to systematically investigate how the degree of immobilization relates to the risk of developing VTE. EXCLAIM offers insights into the duration of VTE risk associated with reduced mobility and helps identify which patients would benefit most from extended-duration thromboprophylaxis. Further recent studies suggest that extended-duration thromboprophylaxis may be in order in certain high-risk patients to protect the patients from the risk of VTE events occurring, particularly in the posthospitalization period. Baseline d-dimer data and level of mobility could be included in risk assessment. Physicians are recommended to consider the use of extended-duration thromboprophylaxis based on individual risk assessment management (RAM) and balance of benefit and harm."

CD008201,0,10364768,0,Antithrombotic and thrombolytic therapy for ischemic stroke.,"Anthithrombotic therapy is widely used as primary and secondary preventative treatment for ischemic cerebrovascular disease. Aspirin modestly reduces the risk for subsequent ischemic stroke after a transient ischemic attack or initial stroke. Adding dipyridamole may enhance this benefit. Ticlopidine confers a small additional benefit, but with more side effects and cost. The best dose of aspirin remains unsettled, but recent studies support the concept of very early initiation of treatment. Intravenous and subcutaneous heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin is not recommended because of enhanced bleeding side effects, unless venous thrombosis in debilitated patients is a concern. Thrombolytic therapy with rt-PA was recently demonstrated to improve outcome in ischemic stroke patients treated within 3 hours of onset. However, the risk-benefit ratio is narrow because of the substantial risk for intracerebral hemorrhage with rt-PA. An enhanced ability to identify patients at risk for bleeding and newer thrombolytic drugs may expand the utility of this therapy, as would extending the time window beyond the current 3-hour period. Clinicians should anticipate continued advances in the fields of antithrombotic and thrombolytic therapy for ischemic stroke over the next few years."
CD008201,0,12152961,0,Acute management of atrial fibrillation: Part II. Prevention of thromboembolic complications.,"Family physicians should be familiar with the acute management of atrial fibrillation and the initiation of chronic therapy for this common arrhythmia. Initial management should include hemodynamic stabilization, rate control, restoration of sinus rhythm, and initiation of antithrombotic therapy. Part II of this two-part article focuses on the prevention of thromboembolic complications using anticoagulation. Heparin is routinely administered before medical or electrical cardioversion. Warfarin is used in patients with persistent atrial fibrillation who are at higher risk for thromboembolic complications because of advanced age, history of coronary artery disease or stroke, or presence of left-sided heart failure. Aspirin is preferred in patients at low risk for thromboembolic complications and patients with a high risk for falls, a history of noncompliance, active bleeding, or poorly controlled hypertension. The recommendations provided in this article are consistent with guidelines published by the American Heart Association and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality."

Additional postoperative length of stay (LOS) is necessary to achieve a therapeutic international normalized ratio with traditional protocols using unfractionated heparin. In part one of this 2-part article, low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), specifically enoxaparin, was shown to be a safe and effective alternative for anticoagulation after vascular surgical procedures. At the same time, its use can significantly reduce the average postoperative LOS after vascular procedures. This article describes a successful discharge planning experience using the LMWH enoxaparin after vascular procedures. We share our perspective on the role of the various members of the vascular surgical team as implemented in our acute care vascular surgical service clinical setting. Our discussion may offer ideas for consideration by vascular clinicians in their clinical settings."
CD008201,0,3147632,0,[Anticoagulants in the treatment of severe pulmonary embolism. A prospective study].,"This prospective study was designed to obtain information on the fate of patients with severe pulmonary embolism who received anticoagulants as first-line treatment, in order to identify those in whom other treatments available might be expected to reduce mortality or sequelae. Thirty-seven patients selected as they showed evidence of acute cor pulmonale entered the study. Seven of them (18.9 p. 100) died in hospital, and these were patients whose age (p = 0.004), degree of pulmonary obstruction (p = 0.008) and serum lactate dehydrogenase level (p = 0.001) were significantly higher than those of the other patients. The mean values of these parameters (64 years, 72 p. 100 and 450 IU/l respectively) made it possible to select patients with a high risk of death. At the end of the follow-up period (25 +/- 12 months) only 2 patients complained of moderate dyspnoea, in contrast with the high incidence (17/18 patients) of paraclinical abnormalities observed 3 months after the initial accident. We conclude that clinical trials comparing other treatments with the one we used would be useful if their objective was to reduce mortality in high risk patients. On the other hand, it seems impossible to demonstrate a functional improvement: we found our treatment satisfactory and its results independent of the abnormalities observed on the 3rd month."

There are available clinical guidelines that have brought forward current initiatives around thromboprophylaxis in pediatric hospitals addressing this safety practice in children."
CD008201,0,1607612,0,Etiology and course of acute bleeding esophageal ulcers.,"Twenty (2%) of 1,140 patients with acute gastrointestinal bleeding had esophageal ulcers. Patients with esophageal ulcers most commonly had either melena (40%) or melena and hematemesis (40%). Fifty percent had orthostatic hypotension, and 80% required transfusions. Ulcers were associated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) use in 50%, hiatal hernia in 60%, and esophagitis in 40%. Endoscopic stigmata of recent hemorrhage consisted of oozing blood (35%) and adherent clot (25%). Six patients had multiple ulcers. The majority of ulcers (90%) were in the distal esophagus. Nine patients were endoscopically treated without complications except for rebleeding in 1 patient. Endoscopic therapy was associated with decreased duration of hospitalization. Overall mortality was 45% in these patients, but no deaths were related to bleeding. Although uncommon, esophageal ulcers are a cause of significant acute gastrointestinal bleeding that appears to respond to endoscopic treatment."

CD008201,0,16363242,0,Venous thromboembolism and fractured neck of femur.,"The post-operative incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) is high for patients undergoing hip fracture surgery. Proven prophylactic measures are available although underutilized due to concern on post-operative bleeding with use of anticoagulants. This study retrospectively reviewed the clinical incidence of VTE and utilisation of thromboprophylactic protocols over an eight year period. Demographic details, mechanism of injury, VTE risk factors, prophylactic modalities (mechanical and pharmacological), operation duration, mode of anaesthesia, hospital length of stay (LOS) and post-operative complications with particular attention to suspected deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and/or pulmonary embolism (PE) were analysed. Male to female ratio was 1:2.7 with a median age of 78 years (IQR: 70-86 years) and 83 years (IQR: 77-87 years) respectively (p<0.001). Median hospital LOS was 8 days (IQR: 5-13 days) and differed with mechanism of injury. The in-hospital incidence of VTE was 1.6% (95% CI: 1.1-2.5%) with a probably underestimated three month rate of 8.2% (95% CI: 5.3-12.4%). Non fatal PE was 0.5% (95% CI: 0.2-1.0%) in-hospital and 2.6% (95% CI: 1.2-5.5%) at three months. Fatal PE was 0.5% (95% CI: 0.2-1.0%) with a three month incidence of 0.4% (95% CI: 0.1-2.4%). The in-hospital VTE incidence was kept relatively low with use of prophylactic protocols with almost all patients receiving prophylaxis by the end of the study period. Given the five-fold out of hospital increase in incidence, consideration should be given to continue prophylaxis beyond hospital discharge in this high risk group of patients."

The authors conducted a literature analysis to characterize the uses, dosing patterns, and safety of argatroban anticoagulation in pediatric patients. A comprehensive literature search identified nine articles describing 34 patients aged 1 week to 16 years who received argatroban anticoagulation for prophylaxis or treatment of thrombosis, cardiac catheterization, hemodialysis, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or ventricular assist device support, or cardiopulmonary bypass. Most (85%) patients had HIT, a history of HIT, and/or HIT antibodies. For HIT thromboprophylaxis or treatment, argatroban dosing varied widely (0.1-12 mcg/kg/min), with no obvious relationship between patient age and dosage requirement. Overall, in these pediatric patients, therapeutic levels of anticoagulation were achieved despite the wide range of doses used. For pediatric patients undergoing cardiac catheterization, argatroban doses lower than those recommended in adults appeared to provide therapeutic anticoagulation. There was an unacceptably high bleeding risk with argatroban anticoagulation during pediatric cardiopulmonary bypass. Due to the limitations of case reports and/or case series, prospective studies with pharmacokinetic analyses are needed to evaluate the use of argatroban in pediatric patients."

CD008201,0,23787230,0,Inferior vena cava filters.,"Venous thromboembolism is common. Most pulmonary emboli arise as thromboses in the deep veins of the lower extremities and may result in serious complications. Inferior vena cava filters (IVCF) are intended to prevent the passage of deep vein thrombosis to the pulmonary arteries. Accepted indications for IVCF placement include the presence of acute venous thromboembolism with inability to administer anticoagulation medication or failure of anticoagulation. Despite these clear indications, IVCF have been commonly placed in patients for primary prevention of pulmonary emboli in patients deemed to be at high risk, along with several other ""soft"" indications. As a result, IVCF use has been rising over the past 2 decades, especially given the retrievable nature of modern devices. Nonetheless, IVCF are not free of complications, which may occur during implantation and retrieval and while retained in the body. Despite this increase in use, the long-term efficacy remains unclear, and the management of patients with retained filters is often controversial. Finally, filter retrieval in eligible patients is relatively infrequent, suggesting that systems must be in place to improve appropriate filter use and to increase retrieval."
CD008201,0,16909697,0,API expert consensus document on management of ischemic heart disease.,"The incidence of coronary artery disease (CAD) has dramatically increased in India during the recent years. There are two facets of CAD: stable CAD and unstable CAD which includes patients with acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina, non-ST elevation myocardial infarction, ST elevation myocardial infarction). The treatment of stable CAD (stable angina) includes anti-anginal medication, medication to modify atherosclerosis and aggressive treatment of causative risk factors. Those patients with stable CAD who have symptoms refractory to medical treatment usually require coronary angiography to be followed by either percutaneous or surgical revascularization. Percutaneous coronary revascularization using drug eluting stents has been a major revolution during the last five years for symptomatic relief of angina in symptomatic CAD and can be applied to large subsets of patients. Off-pump surgical revascularization using arterial grafts is a major advance and bypass surgery continues to remain treatment of choice in diabetics with multi-vessel CAD, left main CAD and in patients with multivessel disease and impaired ventricles. Acute coronary syndromes are usually caused by plaque rupture with resultant thrombus and present as unstable angina, non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). It is now increasingly realized that these patients (particularly the one with high risk) are best managed in advanced cardiac care centres with facilities for cardiac catheterization laboratory, percutaneous coronary interventions and coronary bypass surgery. In both, NSTEMI and STEMI aggressive medical management involving nitrates, ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, dual anti-platelet agents, heparin and statins are recommended. High risk patients with NSTE-ACS require use of glycoprotein IIa / IIIb inhibitors along with early invasive approach involving coronary angiography, angioplasty using drug eluting stent and in some patients bypass surgery. Early reperfusion is key to management of patients presenting with STEMI. If facilities are available, primary percutaneous coronary intervention (angioplasty with stenting) is treatment of choice for patients with STEMI. In our country, thrombolysis still remains the most frequently utilized reperfusion therapy and all efforts should be devoted to provide this therapy at the earliest. All high risk patients with STEMI (including cardiogenic shock) are best treated in higher centres and these patients should be promptly transported to such centres. Early coronary angiography is recommended for majority of patients following thrombolysis for risk stratification and further treatment. In acute coronary syndromes there is drift towards early invasive treatment and this is reflected in marked increase in cardiac care (catheterization laboratories and cardiac surgery centers) facilities throughout India. All patients with CAD require life-long supervised treatment which includes medication, control of risk factors and lifestyle modification. Avoidance of smoking, heart healthy diet, proper exercise, ideal weight management are important for all the patients. Statins, ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, antiplatelet agents have a great role to play in treatment and prevention and these drugs should be utilized under medical supervision. It is important that the medical profession play an important role in critically evaluating the use of diagnostic procedures and therapies as they are introduced and tested in the detection and management of cardiac disorders. The American College of Cardiology (ACC), American Heart Association (AHA), European Society of Cardiology (ESC), Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions (SCAI) and several other societies engage in production of guidelines in the area of cardiovascular diseases from time to time. These guidelines attempt to define practices that meet the needs of most patients in most circumstances. The aim of the guidelines is to improve the patient care. The ultimate judgement regarding the care of the particular patient is to be made by the clinician / healthcare provider keeping in mind all the circumstances. The incidence and prevalence of coronary artery disease (CAD) has increased tremendously in India during the last two decades and this change is largely attributable to lifestyle changes. There has also been a rapid progress in the treatment of CAD with proliferation of specialized cardiac care units, intensive care units, cardiac catheterization laboratories and facilities for bypass surgery. It is estimated that there are over 400 catheterization laboratories currently in India and nearly half of them are located in six major cities. The increase in disease and availability of facilities has resulted in a dramatic change and the focus is shifting from only medical treatment to invasive treatment. This document is an expert consensus document which has been prepared by going through the available guidelines and other relevant literature on the subject. The experts have performed a formal review of the literature and have weighed the strength of evidence for or against a particular therapy as it can be applied in Indian scenario. The consensus document deals with the management of ischemic heart disease (IHD) under following sections: 1) Stable Angina 2) Non ST Elevation Acute Coronary Syndrome (NSTE-ACS) 3) ST Elevation Acute Coronary Syndrome (STE-ACS) or Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI)."

The goal of this study was to determine the incidence of DVT in neurosurgical patients who, by hospital protocol, receive surveillance ultrasonography of the lower extremities twice weekly, in addition to prophylaxis with unfractionated heparin and external pneumatic compression sleeves. A retrospective review of 7,298 ultrasound studies carried out on 2,593 patients over 4 years at a university neurosurgical hospital was conducted. There was a 7.4% incidence of proximal lower extremity DVT and a 9.7% total incidence including distal DVT. A greater number of distal DVTs were detected with the implementation of whole-leg ultrasonography in the last 2 years of observation. Chart review of 237 patients diagnosed with DVT demonstrated an admitting diagnosis of subarachnoid hemorrhage in nearly half of the patients. The median hospital length of stay for DVT patients was 18 days. Institutional control data demonstrated non-ruptured aneurysm and cerebrovascular anomalies to be the leading reason for admission, followed closely by subarachnoid hemorrhage. The hospital protocol of biweekly screening ultrasound and dual modality prophylaxis for neurosurgery patients resulted in a proximal DVT incidence consistent with that demonstrated by previous studies of standardized dual modality prophylaxis, and higher than that demonstrated in previous studies that employed ultrasound screening protocols."

There are currently enough data to support the notion that anticoagulation with warfarin or dabigatran is far superior to aspirin in the prevention of stroke or systemic embolism in AF. Aspirin is the preferred modality in patients who are either not candidates for anticoagulation, such as patients with increased risk for bleeding, low-risk patients based on the CHADS2 score or patients who have difficulty in maintaining a therapeutic international normalized ratio. There is no dispute on the recommendations regarding stroke prevention in high-risk patients (CHADS2 risk score of 2 and beyond) with AF. However, there is some controversy regarding the appropriate strategy (anticoagulation vs aspirin) for stroke prevention in low-risk patients (CHA2DS2-VASc score of 0-1). Novel oral anticoagulant drugs (direct thrombin inhibitors and Factor Xa inhibitors) might further diminish the role of aspirin for stroke prevention in AF due to their superior efficacy, lack of need for monitoring of therapeutic effects and lower bleeding risk when compared with warfarin, especially in patients with stable vascular disease."

Of 78 patients screened, 41% were eligible and 18 (23%) were enrolled. Follow-up venous ultrasound examination was performed 6 weeks after discharge. Of enrolled patients, 16 (89%) completed the protocol. Hospital length of stay was 2 days in protocol patients compared with 5 days for patients receiving conventional inpatient heparin with a continuous intravenous infusion (p = 0.0009). Very high heparin doses (mean 42,000 to 62,000 U daily, given in three divided doses every 8 hours) and a median time of 21 hours were required initially to achieve a target activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) > 55 seconds. Subsequently many patients had supratherapeutic levels, yet there were no bleeding complications. Four patients (25%) did not show improvement at follow-up ultrasound in spite of aPTTs > 55 seconds after the second injection. Clot regression was evident in remaining patients.

CD008201,0,3945121,0,Heparin and the in-hospital management of deep venous thrombosis: cost considerations.,"Numerous protocols for the treatment of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) with heparin have been recommended. In the past, physicians rarely considered costs in their decision to use a particular protocol; however, the recent introduction of the diagnosis-related groups (DRGs) and other cost-reduction measures has imposed financial limitations on the practice of medicine and surgery. To determine how the cost of treatment for DVT at the Mayo Clinic might be affected by the use of alternative heparin protocols, we conducted a two-stage study. In the first part, charts of 40 patients with uncomplicated DVT were analyzed retrospectively to determine an ""average"" Mayo Clinic heparin protocol for DVT. In the second part, this ""average"" protocol was compared with four other currently advocated protocols, and the cost of using each protocol at the Mayo Clinic was estimated. These protocols differed from the Mayo Clinic protocol with respect to method and route of heparin administration, frequency of monitoring anticoagulation, and duration of heparin treatment. This analysis revealed that the average charges resulting from treatment of DVT at the Mayo Clinic exceeded the corresponding DRG payment and that the cost of treatment varied substantially with the protocol used (a difference of more than $2,000 between two of the protocols analyzed). A review of the literature provided little evidence to suggest that the alternative protocols were not equally effective. Therefore, we concluded that measures such as shortening the duration of heparin therapy, administration of heparin by the subcutaneous route, and minimal monitoring of anticoagulation (in patients with a low risk of bleeding) can substantially reduce the cost of treating DVT and may be no less effective than other protocols for heparinization.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

CD008201,0,8758598,0,[Pharmacological therapeutic prospects of cerebral vasospasm].,"New therapies of cerebral vasospasm aim to prevent the effects of subarachnoid haemorrhage. These effects result in red blood cell haemolysis and release of oxyhaemoglobin, free radicals formation and lipid peroxidations, imbalance in endothelial modulation of vasomotor tone and activation of the complement system. Low doses of fibrinolytic agents administered intrathecally accelerate the fibrinolysis of the clot and reduce the oxyhaemoglobin release. The tissue-type plasminogen activator has proven to be effective in preventing vasospasm, but the modalities of this therapy remain to be defined. Free radical reactions may be inhibited by free radical scavengers and inhibitors of lipid peroxidations. Tirilazad is a potent inhibitor of lipid peroxidations, which improves the patients' outcome and has gone to Phase III human trials. Superoxide dismutase and tropolone derivatives are currently evaluated in animal models. Vasomotor tone can be modified in experimental models either by blocking endothelin receptors (BQ-123), or by facilitating the release and enhancing the effect of nitric oxide using protein kinase C inhibitors, drugs that increase intracellular calcium (cyclopiazonic acid, LP-805) and free radicals scavengers (superoxide dismutase). These possibilities are being investigated. Finally, preliminary studies have demonstrated the efficacy of FUT-175, an inhibitor of the complement system, in the prevention of vasospasm. In the next years, these new therapies have to be validated by prospective and randomized clinical trials to propose guidelines for the management of patients at risk of cerebral vasospasm after aneurysmal rupture."
CD008201,0,25320158,0,Infective Endocarditis.,"Infective endocarditis (IE) is a noncontagious infection of the endocardium and heart valves. The epidemiology of IE has shifted recently with an increase in health care-associated IE. Infective endocarditis requiring intensive care unit stay is increasing, and nosocomial IE is frequently responsible. Diagnosis of IE requires multiple clinical data points encompassing history and physical examination, microbiology, and cardiac imaging as no one test is sufficiently sensitive or specific. The modified Duke criteria algorithm is the standard of care in the clinical diagnosis of IE. Complications from IE are common, particularly so in the critical care setting, and include congestive heart failure, embolism, septic shock, invasive infection, prosthetic valve dehiscence, heart block, and mycotic aneurysm. A multidisciplinary care team of infectious disease, cardiology, and cardiac surgery physicians is recommended to reduce complications. Intravenous antibiotics are first-line therapy with cardiac surgery being reserved for certain complications of IE and/or for clinical situations in which there is a high risk of complications. Timing of surgery for IE remains controversial and depends on a variety of clinical factors."
CD008201,0,8184096,0,The natural history and epidemiology of venous thrombosis.,"Epidemiologic studies over the past 30 years have provided much of the basis for the understanding of venous thromboembolic disease. There has been an evolution from simple descriptive studies using clinical diagnosis to various forms of comparative studies using objective diagnoses. Identification of high-risk cases in the hospitalized population has led to the development of both general and specific antithrombotic prophylactic regimens. This has occurred against a background of an increased understanding of the pathophysiology of venous thrombosis. Inhospital case interventions have allowed direct questions concerning pathophysiology to be addressed. Examples would include the use of certain types and dosages of anticoagulants and the use of mechanical devices to avoid stasis. Despite these advances, there are still areas that require further attention. One aspect of importance is to evaluate the thrombotic risk of new procedures. The possibility that a new procedure may be either less or more thrombotic than its predecessor should be addressed. In the case of the former, additional antithrombotic measures are needed. An example of this is the relatively disappointing results of regular low-dose heparin treatment in some orthopedic procedures. In the case of the latter, less severe measures may be indicated. Current antithrombotic methods are not without risks and may not be necessary with some of the new endoscopic surgical procedures. Another area of importance relates to the monitoring of compliance. The information on antithrombotic methods has been available for two decades, yet surveys of the application of these methods consistently show that antithrombotic protocols are used less in North America relative to their use in equivalent institutions in Europe. A third area that still needs further epidemiologic study is the incidence and effects of venous thrombosis in the general community. Despite the two recent descriptive studies cited above, relatively little, as compared with the in-patient perspective, is known about community risk factors and their prevention. With respect to the natural history of hospital-based cases it seems unlikely that much is to be gained from surveying the efficacy of heparin or heparin-like treatment for mortality end points. However, a large and still unsatisfactorily examined area is the true frequency and impact of the postphlebitic syndrome. This aspect is germane to both hospital- and community-acquired DVT and, with an aging population, clearly deserves a lot more attention."

CD008201,0,26586393,0,Extended Dual Antiplatelet for Diabetic Elderly Patients After Drug-eluting Stent Implantation: an Evidence-based Clinical Review.,"Antiplatelet is an important drug for patients with coronary heart disease undergoing drug-eluting stent implantation. Current guidelines recommend dual antiplatelet with aspirin and a P2Y12 inhibitor for at least 12 months. Continuation of DAPT beyond 12 months may be considered for preventing very late stent thrombosis. Several patient-related factors that contribute to stent thrombosis have been recognized, including diabetes and advanced age, but the optimal DAPT duration for these patients is still controversial. This article reviews the efficacy of extended (>12 months) compared to standard (12 months) DAPT for reducing myocardial infarction and stent thrombosis rates, especially in diabetic elderly patients. Literature screening was conducted at PubMed and Cochrane database using ""dual antiplatelet"", ""duration"", ""adult-onset diabetes mellitus"", ""elderly"" and, ""drug-eluting stent"" as keywords. Article types were limited to meta-analysis, systematic review, randomized clinical trial, or clinical trial that compared the efficacy of extended to standard duration of DAPT. Clinical outcomes used were myocardial infarction and stent thrombosis. The initial search was done to find relevant studies specifically assessing diabetic and elderly patients, then widened to diabetic and non-diabetic patients of any age above eighteen years. A total of 5 clinical trials and 1 meta-analysis were reviewed, showing an overall risk reduction of stent thrombosis and myocardial infarction. This review has several limitations, such as its potential selection bias and under-represented proportion of diabetic and elderly patients. High-risk subgroups like diabetes mellitus has a tendency of increased ischemic risk, while advanced age could have both increased ischemic risk and bleeding risk. This review suggests that it is better to reserve extended dual antiplatelet therapy for patients with high ischemic risk and low bleeding risk (tailored therapy)."

Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a highly prothrombotic immune reaction to heparin that may result in death, limb ischemia leading to amputation, graft occlusion, and other severe thrombotic events. Patients undergoing cardiac surgery are at high risk for HIT antibody seroconversion and at risk for clinical HIT. For patients with acute or subacute HIT and needing urgent cardiac surgery, accepted protocols for alternative, non-heparin anticoagulation are needed. The direct thrombin inhibitor bivalirudin offers promise in this area and is currently being evaluated in multicenter trials as an alternative for heparin/protamine in patients with HIT undergoing cardiac surgery."
CD008201,0,21769596,0,Implementation and evaluation of a pharmacy-led thromboprophylaxis campaign in a community hospital.,"In hospitalized patients, venous thromboembolism (VTE) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality. Despite evidence demonstrating efficacy and safety of pharmacological thromboprophylaxis in the prevention of VTE, its use remains low. The aim of this study is to compare the incidence of use of thromboprophylaxis before and after a pharmacy-led thrombosis prevention campaign in medical patients hospitalized in a community hospital. A pharmacy-led multifaceted thromboprophylaxis campaign including continuing education activities for physicians and pharmacists and individualized academic detailing activities supported by clinical tools were implemented over an 8-week period. In a quasi-experimental study, the incidence of pharmacological thromboprophylaxis was evaluated using a retrospective chart review and compared before and after the campaign in medical patients at high and non-high risk of VTE as defined by the American College of Chest Physicians criteria. The medical charts of 461 patients were reviewed; 66 and 58 patients were at high-risk of VTE prior to and after the campaign, respectively. After the campaign, thromboprophylaxis ordering in high-risk patients increased from 15.2 to 43.1% (adjusted OR: 6.8; 95% CI: 2.5-18.0). Thromboprophylaxis ordering in non-high risk patients was 1.8% before the campaign and 6.0% after. This increase was not statistically significant (adjusted OR: 4.6; 95% CI: 1.0-20.4). The incidence of pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis in hospitalized medical patients at high-risk of VTE increased significantly after the campaign but remained sub-optimal. Longer or a different campaign may be needed to ensure long-term optimal thromboprophylaxis use."
CD008201,0,16801812,0,Antithrombotic therapy in atrial fibrillation: beyond the AFFIRM study.,"In the last few decades several clinical studies evaluated the efficacy and safety of different strategies for antithrombotic prophylaxis to prevent thromboembolic events in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). Nowadays, a frequently debated point is related to the high embolic risk deriving from the asymptomatic and symptomatic AF recurrence after cardioversion or in paroxysmal AF, especially in patients with a large number of prolonged episodes of AF. In fact, after the recent AFFIRM and RACE trials, patients after successful cardioversion at risk for thromboembolism could also need lifelong anticoagulation. Considering this, should we anticoagulate all patients with clinical risk factors for thromboembolism with a single episode of AF, without considering the hemorrhagic risk? Based on recent trials, it is reasonable to hypothesize that long AF recurrences (> 48 h), both symptomatic and asymptomatic, are present mostly (if not exclusively) in patients with structural left atrial appendage (LAA) dysfunction and remodeling. Conversely, AF recurrences in patients without LAA dysfunction and remodeling, could be too short to allow thrombi formation in the LAA, and the anticoagulation could also be avoided. Once other clinical and echocardiographic determinants of stroke have been excluded, the LAA velocity could select patients with a normal appendage function at low embolic risk who could benefit from anti-aggregation and patients with irreversible appendage dysfunction, at high embolic risk, who need lifelong anticoagulation."

Emerging data from clinical trials over the last decade indicates that statin therapy may provide broad beneficial effects beyond their primary lipid lowering mechanisms. In coronary heart disease, statins have demonstrated a unique ability to target several cellular pathways, which appear to play an underappreciated role in acute inflammation and subsequent thrombosis. Herein, we review the potential mechanisms where statins may act as antithrombotic agents in the setting of acute coronary syndromes and discuss the clinical implications of these findings."

CD008201,0,25773476,0,Dual antiplatelet therapy duration after the placement of a drug-eluting stent: what are the data?,"The data supporting the immediate use of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) post implantation of drug-eluting stents (DESs) is irrefutable. DAPT in this early period is necessary to prevent stent thrombosis during endothelialization of the stent, a process known to be delayed when DESs are placed. In addition, DAPT helps prevent thrombosis from plaque rupture that occurs outside of the initial stented area and/or at neo-atherosclerotic lesions within a previously coated stent. The ACC/AHA current guidelines (Levine et al. J Am Coll Cardiol. 58(24):e44-122, 2011) recommend 12 months of DAPT post DES implantation. As the result of several randomized clinical trials (Task Force on Myocardial Revascularization of the European Society of Cardio-Thoracic Surgery (EACTS) et al. Eur Heart J. 31(20):2501-55, 2010) showing the safety of a shorter duration of DAPT, the European Heart Society altered their recommendations to 6-12 months of DAPT post DES implantation. However, recent data from the DAPT trial (Mauri et al. N Engl J Med. 371(23):2156-66, 2014) clearly demonstrated less ischemic events with 30 months of DAPT. This trial and others have established that an increased DAPT duration increases bleeding risk which, in turn, increases subsequent morbidity and mortality. The current conundrum lies in defining the optimal time of DAPT post DES to adequately reduce ischemic events while minimizing bleeding risks. Future studies are required to better stratify patients into low and high risk for both ischemic and bleeding risks to assess whether shorter or longer courses of DAPT are the most appropriate for any specific patients. Until then, instead of a ""one size fits all"" approach to patients who receive DESs, the treating physician must consider both procedural and patient factors when deciding the optimal duration of DAPT for each patient."

CD008201,0,11358047,0,Cholesterol emboli to the kidney: an immunoperoxidase study.,"Cholesterol emboli (CE) are an increasingly recognised cause of renal impairment in the elderly population, especially following diagnostic vascular procedures and aortic surgery. They can present as part of a multisystem disease which can mimic many conditions, depending on the site of the emboli. As a pathological entity, it was described by Florey in 1945. Relatively few cases have been reported in the literature. At this stage there is no accepted treatment protocol for CE induced renal failure. Little is known about the precise nature of the cells involved in the proliferating tissue surrounding CE in the kidney. To date, all studies on CE have involved routine Haematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stains. By studying the cellular interactions, hopefully this will contribute further to our understanding of CE in the kidney. Nine (n = 9) out of 1150 consecutive renal biopsies over a six year period were analysed. Standard three- and four-layered peroxidase-antiperoxidase techniques were employed. A panel of antibodies to specific cells were used. The particular cells analysed were the myofibroblast, smooth muscle, endothelium, macrophage, neutrophil, T cell and B cell. All vessels in the biopsy specimen containing CE were analysed. T cell, B cell, macrophage and neutrophil infiltrates were counted and expressed as cells/mm2 using a 0.022 mm2 graticule under 400 (10x40) magnification. The vessel and perivascular space were analysed. The myofibroblast, smooth muscle and endothelial cell proliferation were graded semiquantitatively. Vessels without evidence of CE were used as controls. The data were subjected to statistical analysis using the unpaired non-parametric Mann-Whitney Two Sample test. P values <0.05 were accepted as significant. Histological sections demonstrated the host response in the vessel to CE involve a significant response including the myofibroblast, endothelium, T cell and macrophage. The B cell response was absent and the smooth muscle cell response was not significantly different. The perivascular responses were not different for the cells studied. This study has characterised the host response to CE in the human kidney by demonstrating the presence of the myofibroblast, macrophage T cell and endothelial cell response. The myofibroblast is a cell which is increasingly being recognised in the host response of both granulation tissue and pathological tissue. The population at risk for CE is growing and the disease is increasingly iatrogenic in origin. Currently our only treatment is prevention."

CD008201,0,17670706,0,Should high risk patients receive clopidogrel as well as aspirin post coronary arterial bypass grafting?,"A best evidence topic in cardiac surgery was written according to a structured protocol. The question addressed was whether clopidogrel should be given in addition to aspirin in high risk patients after coronary bypass surgery to reduce thrombotic complications. High risk patients would include patients recently post MI or patients with a patent stent in situ. Altogether 511 papers were identified using the below mentioned search and all major international guidelines were included. Eleven presented the best evidence to answer the clinical question. The author, journal, date and country of publication, patient group, relevant outcomes and weaknesses were tabulated. The 2004 American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) guidelines recommend 9-12 months of clopidogrel in addition to aspirin for patients undergoing coronary arterial bypass grafting (CABG) for non-ST segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (grade 1C). This is based on subanalyses of the CURE and CAPRIE studies that showed significant reductions in the incidence of death, myocardial infarction and stroke in patients who had CABG during these trials. A randomised trial is currently underway to investigate this further. Thus, patients post CABG who have had a recent NSTEMI or have a stent not covered by a graft should have clopidogrel in addition to aspirin for 9-12 months."
CD008201,0,19179814,0,The potential role of prasugrel in secondary prevention of ischemic events in patients with acute coronary syndromes.,"Acute coronary syndromes (ACS) are life-threatening manifestations of coronary artery disease, occurring when a thrombus forms at the site of atherosclerotic plaque rupture or fissuring. Almost all patients discharged from the hospital after an ACS (myocardial infarction or unstable angina) in the United States receive antiplatelet therapy. Current recommendations for post-ACS antiplatelet therapy are aspirin 75 to 162 mg/day indefinitely for all patients, plus a thienopyridine (currently clopidogrel 75 mg/day) for > or = 12 months in those receiving stents unless there is a high risk of bleeding. Dual antiplatelet therapy is indicated because patients with ACS have a hypercoagulable state which persists for at least 6 months after the acute event, and agents targeting different mechanisms have synergistic antiplatelet effects. The thienopyridine class includes ticlopidine, clopidogrel, and prasugrel. Clopidogrel is recommended in guidelines because ticlopidine carries a higher risk of adverse events including blood dyscrasias. Prasugrel is not yet available outside of a research setting. Clopidogrel + aspirin reduces the risk of an adverse clinical event after ACS by 15% and after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) by 34%. However, there is considerable interpatient variability in response to clopidogrel and a mean of 21% of patients (95% confidence interval [CI], 17 % - 25%) are nonresponsive to the drug as measured by platelet aggregation inhibition. Nonresponsiveness is associated with an increased risk of secondary ischemic events. Compared with clopidogrel, the newest thienopyridine, prasugrel, has a faster onset of platelet inhibition and less variability of response. In clinical trials, the combination of prasugrel + aspirin reduced the risk of a second ischemic event by 19% compared with clopidogrel + aspirin. There is a small increase in the risk of bleeding with dual antiplatelet therapy, but the benefit still outweighs the risk in most patients. Patients with a history of transient ischemic attack or stroke should not receive prasugrel + aspirin because of increased risk of events."
CD008201,0,10731377,0,"[The clinical use of the GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors eptifibatide and tirofiban in the treatment of acute coronary syndromes of the ""non-ST elevation"" type].","Acute coronary syndromes not associated with ST-segment elevation, i.e. unstable angina and non-Q wave myocardial infarction, represent a heterogeneous group of clinical disorders sharing similar pathogenic mechanisms, clinical presentation and medical management. Current guidelines recommended an early anti-thrombotic and anti-ischemic treatment in these patients, as well as their prompt risk evaluation based on easily available clinical and instrumental data, to identify those subjects at greater risk in whom a more aggressive management is warranted. Despite the association of aspirin, heparin and anti-ischemic drugs, the 30-day rate of death or myocardial infarction remains high (9-15%) in patients with markers of greater risk (i.e. Braunwald class III, ST-segment depression, abnormal creatine kinase or troponin values). Moreover, in patients with acute coronary syndromes undergoing percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI), complex coronary lesions increase the peri-procedural risk of thrombotic complications. Regardless of the agonist responsible for platelet activation and aggregation, platelet glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa receptor activation is the key factor in thrombosis formation. Several clinical trials in the past few years have documented the beneficial value of GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors in patients treated with aspirin and heparin, with a significant reduction in the cumulative end-point of death and/or myocardial infarction at 48-96 hours (odds ratio--OR 0.81, 95% confidence interval--CI 0.71-0.92, p < 0.01). Such therapeutical benefit is still present at 30 days (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.81-0.97, p < 0.001) and 6 months (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.79-0.97, p < 0.001). In patients treated with abciximab, eptifibatide or tirofiban, undergoing early PCI, a remarkable relative reduction in the risk of death and non-fatal acute myocardial infarction was shown before PCI (-34%, p < 0.001). The pre-PCI administration of GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors is associated with a significant reduction in peri-procedural complications (-41% relative reduction of death or acute myocardial infarction in the 48 hours after PCI, p < 0.001). In this subset of patients the benefit correlates with abnormal pre-PCI values of troponin, a reliable surrogate marker of active thrombosis. The greatest clinical benefit from GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors is expected in patients presenting high-risk features (early post-infarction angina; older age with a history of left ventricular dysfunction or diabetes; heart failure symptoms, ST-segment depression, abnormal troponin, creatine kinase, and C-reactive protein values at admission) as well as in patients with recurrent ischemic attacks and those undergoing early PCI. Although the combination of GP IIb/IIIa inhibition and standard doses of unfractionated heparin is associated with an increased risk of major bleeding, such risk can be remarkably reduced adopting simple technical suggestions."

CD008201,0,22518392,0,What is the most effective and safest delivery of thromboprophylaxis in atrial fibrillation?,"The presence of atrial fibrillation (AF) increases the risk of stroke fivefold, but the risk is dependent upon the presence of stroke risk factors. The challenge is defining patients who would best benefit from thromboprophylaxis, and how to deliver it in the most effective and safe way. The objective of this brief overview is to address this question. Previously, attention has been directed towards identifying high-risk patients who could be subjected to an inconvenient (and potentially dangerous) drug, warfarin. Aspirin has been increasingly recognised as an inferior choice for stroke prevention, and may not be any safer than warfarin in terms of major bleeding, especially in the elderly. Thus, the focus more recently has been directed towards identifying truly low-risk patients who do not need any antithrombotic therapy, and all others with ≥ 1 stroke risk factors should be considered for oral anticoagulation therapy (whether as well-controlled warfarin or one of the new oral anticoagulant drugs), as the most effective means of reducing the risk of stroke and thromboembolism in AF."

CD008201,0,9854464,0,Deep venous thrombosis: a prospective 3-month follow-up using duplex scanning and strain-gauge plethysmography.,"1. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the degree of thrombus regression, development of valvular insufficiency, impaired calf muscle pump function and clinical symptoms after a period of acute deep venous thrombosis. 2. Seventy patients with acute deep venous thrombosis, diagnosed by duplex scanning or venography, received treatment with heparin and oral coumarin derivatives according to a standard protocol. All patients wore graduated compression stockings during the whole study period. Duplex scanning was performed at diagnosis and 1 and 3 months later to measure thrombus mass and reflux. The supine venous pump function test was used to assess calf muscle pump function. 3. Three months follow-up was completed in 60 patients. In total 218 (28%) out of 780 vein segments were initially thrombosed and 134 (17%) could not be traced. A statistically significant reduction of thrombus mass was recorded throughout the study period. Total resolution of thrombosis in all vein segments occurred in 25% of the patients within 1 month and in 40% in 3 months. There was no difference in regression between the various proximal vein segments. Distal segments showed more regression than proximal segments. Reflux occurred in 27% of the initially thrombosed veins and in 15% of the patent veins. Patients who showed total resolution after 1 month had a significantly higher calf muscle pump function than patients without total resolution (70%pf vs 61%pf, P < 0.05). Patients with reflux in two or more segments had a significantly lower calf muscle pump function than patients with reflux in less than two segments (58%pf vs 69%pf, P < 0.05). 4. Using duplex scanning and the supine venous pump function test 3 months after an acute deep venous thrombosis, overall haemodynamic abnormalities and local site of valve incompetence could readily be identified. Patients with haemodynamic abnormalities might be at risk to develop the post-thrombotic syndrome. There was no difference in thrombus regression between the various proximal vein segments. Reflux was significantly more often seen in initially thrombosed veins. Thirty-five percent of the patients developed an abnormal calf muscle pump function after 3 months. Patients with early resolution of thrombus had a higher calf muscle pump function after 3 months."

Their uses in breast cancer are continually evolving as new clinical trial results become available. Although tamoxifen, the most widely used HT for breast cancer, was originally approved for and used in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer (MBC), its effectiveness as MBC therapy led to its subsequent assessment and use as adjuvant and risk-reduction therapy for breast cancer. However, tamoxifen is not universally effective in these settings and is associated with infrequent known toxicities such as increased risk of thromboembolism and endometrial cancer; therefore, a search for more effective and more tolerable HTs has evolved."

CD008201,0,15516194,0,"Warfarin reversal: consensus guidelines, on behalf of the Australasian Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis.","For most warfarin indications, the target maintenance international normalised ratio (INR) is 2-3. Risk factors for bleeding complications with warfarin use include age, history of past bleeding and specific comorbid conditions. To reverse the effects of warfarin, vitamin K(1) can be given. Immediate reversal is achieved with a prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP). Vitamin K(1) is essential for sustaining the reversal achieved by PCC and FFP. When oral vitamin K(1) is used for warfarin reversal, the injectable formulation of vitamin K(1) is preferable to tablets because of its flexible dosing; this formulation can be given orally or injected. To temporarily reverse the effect of warfarin when there is a need to continue warfarin therapy, vitamin K(1) should be given in a dose that will quickly lower the INR to a safe, but not subtherapeutic, range and will not cause resistance once warfarin is reinstated. Prothrombinex-HT is the only PCC approved in Australia and New Zealand for warfarin reversal. It contains factors II, IX and X, and low levels of factor VII. FFP should be added to Prothrombinex-HT as a source of factor VII when used for warfarin reversal. Simple dental or dermatological procedures may not require interruption to warfarin therapy. If necessary, warfarin therapy can be withheld 5 days before elective surgery, when the INR usually falls to below 1.5 and surgery can be conducted safely. Bridging anticoagulation therapy for patients at high risk for thromboembolism should be undertaken in consultation with the relevant experts."

CD008201,0,18000798,0,Prevention of deep vein thrombosis in cancer patients.,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients with cancer follows an aggressive course, and it is often resistant to traditional regimens of pharmacological prophylaxis and treatment. Anticoagulant-related bleeding is also common and can complicate VTE treatment as well as cancer therapy. Consequently, the most effective approach to reducing the burden of VTE and its associated morbidity and mortality is to provide appropriate prophylaxis. Few clinical trials have focused on the prevention of VTE in this high-risk patient population, and they consistently demonstrate the efficacy and safety of anticoagulant prophylaxis in reducing thrombotic complications. Currently, low-molecular-weight heparins and oral vitamin K antagonists are the most commonly used anticoagulants for primary prevention in patients with cancer, but compliance with consensus guidelines is poor. Novel anticoagulants with a convenient and favorable risk/benefit profile may help to improve prophylaxis utilization and treatment. This review will provide a summary of the evidence on the primary prevention of VTE in patients with cancer."

CD008201,0,16786943,0,Venous thromboembolism following major orthopedic surgery: what is the risk after discharge?,"Guidelines recommend thromboprophylaxis for at least 10 days to prevent venous thromboembolism in patients undergoing high-risk orthopedic surgery, such as total hip arthroplasty (THA) or total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Furthermore, the recently updated ACCP guidelines also recommend extending the duration of thromboprophylaxis for 28 to 35 days following THA or hip fracture surgery as the risk for venous thromboembolism persists for up to 3 months after surgery. Extended-duration thromboprophylaxis (up to 6 weeks) with low-molecular-weight heparin is significantly more effective in preventing venous thromboembolism in orthopedic surgery patients than the recommended practice of at least 10 days. Extended-duration thromboprophylaxis may require risk stratification to identify high-risk patients. Current risk-assessment models have limitations and are not specific to orthopedic surgery patients; therefore, improvements may facilitate the use of extended-duration thromboprophylaxis in high-risk patients, thereby reducing the burden of venous thromboembolism."

CD008201,0,17019655,0,Venous thromboembolism: a review of risk and prevention in colorectal surgery patients.,"Hospitalization for surgery has a high risk of developing venous thromboembolism, a condition that encompasses both deep-vein thrombosis and its potentially fatal complication, pulmonary embolism. Colorectal surgery implies a specific high risk for postoperative thromboembolic complications relative to other general surgery. This may be a result of pelvic dissection, the perioperative positioning of these patients, or the presence of additional risk factors common to this patient group, such as cancer, advanced age, or inflammatory bowel disease. The potential impact of venous thromboembolism and the need for effective thromboprophylaxis often are underestimated in these patients. Recommendations for thromboprophylaxis in colorectal surgery patients are based on the American College of Chest Physicians guidelines for thrombosis prevention in general surgery patients, with treatment stratified according to the type of surgery and additional venous thromboembolism risk factors present. Prophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin or unfractionated heparin is recommended for colorectal surgery patients classified as moderate to high risk. The small number of studies focusing specifically on colorectal patients, or on cancer or abdominal surgery patients with a colorectal subgroup, has shown that both low-molecular-weight heparin and unfractionated heparin can effectively reduce the incidence of venous thromboembolism. Low-molecular-weight heparin has the practical advantage of once-daily administration and shows a lower risk of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. This review will assess the risk of venous thromboembolism in colorectal surgery patients and discuss current evidence-based guidelines and recommendations for prevention of venous thromboembolism."
CD008201,0,26886395,0,Platelet Function Testing in Patients on Antiplatelet Medications.,"Guidelines provide a Class IA recommendation for the use of dual antiplatelet therapy in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). However, there is interindividual variability in the pharmacodynamic response to antiplatelet medications. Some patients present with a status of high on-treatment platelet reactivity (HPR) during platelet function testing after standard doses of antiplatelet drugs, reflecting a failure to achieve adequate platelet inhibition. As an example, patients with HPR on clopidogrel are at increased risk for thrombotic events, particularly for stent thrombosis and myocardial infarction, but cardiovascular mortality is also elevated. On the contrary, low on-treatment platelet reactivity or an enhanced response to antiplatelet medications has been linked to a higher risk for bleeding. Although both thrombotic and bleeding events are multifactorial in origin, there is supportive evidence for the prognostic value of platelet function testing for risk prediction of both sides of the coin. However, although small studies have provided evidence that treatment adjustments based on platelet function testing results may improve clinical outcomes, the available randomized controlled trials showed no benefit of modifying antiplatelet treatment based on platelet function testing. This review presents the current evidence regarding platelet function testing in patients undergoing PCI. The prognostic value of platelet function testing regarding ischemic and bleeding events is highlighted. Furthermore, the value of platelet function testing for guiding treatment and possible explanations for the so-far negative trial results are presented. The possible future role of platelet function testing for individualized antiplatelet treatment regimens in high-risk patients will be also discussed."

CD008201,0,25174711,0,Triple antiplatelet therapy after PCI--should or could it be done?,"In case of coronary stenting in patients taking long-term oral anticoagulants (OAC), addition of both aspirin and clopidogrel in the drug regimen (so-called triple antiplatelet therapy) is recommended. However such triple therapy increases the risk of serious bleeding events. Comparative data on the efficacy and safety of the triple therapy versus therapy with a single antiplatelet agent and oral anticoagulants in case of coronary stenting are very rare. Most studies show a decreased stroke and myocardial infarction risk, but an increased risk of bleeding events in case of triple therapy. There is general agreement that, when possible, the duration of triple therapy should be shortened followed by clopidogrel and an oral anticoagulant to minimize bleeding risk without increasing other adverse events. In patients with a high risk of bleeding, BMS should be used and triple therapy should be applied for only 1 month, followed by one antiplatelet agent and oral anticoagulant. The WOEST study was the first study showing that therapy with clopidogrel and OAC is safe and reduces bleeding and mortality more effectively than triple therapy including aspirin in patients undergoing coronary stenting. Although the risk of bleeding increases with triple therapy as compared to OAC plus a single antiplatelet agent, the second treatment regimen cannot be recommended to all patients. However for those at the highest risk of bleeding it is not unreasonable to consider. Additional randomized studies are needed for the implementation of future treatment guidelines in patients with high risk for bleeding and thrombotic complications."
CD008201,0,26595043,0,Controversies in the Management of Life-Threatening Pulmonary Embolism.,"Patients with life-threatening pulmonary embolism (PE) offer clinicians a unique opportunity to intervene effectively on the patient's behalf. Hemodynamic status remains the most important short-term prognostic factor for patients with acute PE. Although the evidence is limited, the use of thrombolytic therapy is recommended for patients with acute symptomatic PE and associated hypotension or shock (i.e., high-risk PE) because these patients have a high short-term mortality risk (i.e., >15%) even when receiving anticoagulant treatment. In this setting, the hemodynamic benefits of thrombolytic treatment far outweigh its bleeding risk. For hemodynamically stable patients with PE, the identification of a subgroup of patients with a risk of PE-related complications similar to patients with PE and cardiovascular instability (i.e., intermediate-risk group) may assist with decision making regarding therapy. Given the lack of clear mortality benefit and increased bleeding risk, guidelines do not recommend routine use of systemic thrombolysis for this subgroup of patients. Careful monitoring and rescue fibrinolysis for intermediate-risk PE patients who experience hemodynamic compromise or deterioration while receiving standard anticoagulant therapy can minimize deaths from PE. For patients with life-threatening PE at high risk of bleeding, clinicians might consider the use of low-dose thrombolytic therapy, catheter-directed thrombolysis, or surgical embolectomy, if they have access to the required expertise and resources. The evidence does not support the use of inferior vena cava filters in patients with life-threatening PE unless there is a contraindication to anticoagulation. Since various medical and surgical specialties offer different perspectives and expertise, a multidisciplinary approach to patients with intermediate- and high-risk PE might improve patient outcomes."

CD008201,0,22915978,0,Comparative assessment of low-molecular-weight heparins in cancer from the perspective of patient outcomes and survival.,"Patients with cancer are at high risk of developing venous thromboembolism (VTE), including deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Compared to non-cancer patients, VTE in cancer is more frequently associated with clinical consequences, including recurrent VTE, bleeding, and an increase in the risk of death. Low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs) are commonly recommended for the prevention and treatment of VTE in cancer patients because of their favorable risk-to-benefit profile. Indeed, compared with vitamin K antagonists, LMWHs are characterized by a reduced need for coagulation monitoring, few major bleeding episodes, and once-daily dosing, which make these drugs more suitable in the cancer setting. Guidelines have been published recently with the aim to improve the clinical outcomes in cancer patients at risk of VTE and its complications. Coagulation activation in cancer may have a role not only in thrombosis but also in tumor growth and dissemination. Hence, inhibition of fibrin formation has been considered a possible tool against the progression of malignant disease. Clinical studies show that anticoagulant drugs may have a beneficial effect on survival in cancer patients, with a major role for LMWHs. Recently a number of prospective randomized clinical trials to test LMWHs to improve cancer survival as a primary endpoint in cancer patients have been conducted. Although the results are controversial, the interest in this research area remains high."
CD008201,0,24365189,0,Carotid artery stenting for stroke prevention.,"Stroke is a global epidemic with a significant economic burden to patients, families, and societies at large. In the industrialized world, stroke is the third most common cause of death, the second most common cause of dementia, and the most common reason for acquired disability in adulthood. Overall, 20%-30% of ischemic strokes are related to extracranial carotid artery stenosis. Revascularization with carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is the gold-standard treatment for patients with significant carotid stenosis. Carotid artery stenting (CAS) has become an accepted alternative to CEA over the past decade for patients at high surgical risk, and has progressively evolved into an elegant procedure over the past 3 decades, with dedicated equipment including proximal embolic occlusion devices that have minimized procedural strokes. High-surgical-risk CAS registries have established this procedure as an alternative to CEA for high-risk patients. The Carotid Revascularization Endarterectomy vs Stent Trial (CREST) has shown similar outcomes with CAS and CEA for patients at standard risk, although CAS is associated with higher minor stroke events and CEA is associated with higher myocardial infarction (MI) events. However, CAS is technically challenging and requires a meticulous approach, with a protracted learning curve that should involve experience with > 70 cases. Careful patient selection is instrumental in avoiding procedural complications, and the procedure should be avoided in patients with prohibitive anatomy. This article reviews the use of CAS for extracranial carotid artery stenosis, considering technical aspects, registry and clinical trial outcomes data, determinants of success, and contemporary guidelines."
CD008201,0,22705598,0,How I manage venous thromboembolism risk in hospitalized medical patients.,"Venous thromboembolism is a significant cause of illness and death worldwide. Large bodies of evidence support the heightened risk status of hospitalized medical patients, and that prophylactic measures significantly reduce the risk of thrombosis, yet these patients often fail to receive adequate prophylactic therapy. This failure may be accounted for by a lack of awareness of the relevant indications, poorly designed implementation systems, and clinical concerns over the side effects of anticoagulant medications. This article briefly summarizes our understanding of the clinical factors relevant to the evaluation of venous thromboembolism risk in hospitalized medical patients. We describe our approach to the use of thromboprophylaxis, through which we aim to minimize the disease burden of this under-recognized and preventable pathology."

CD008201,0,22086826,0,Risk assessment models for cancer-associated venous thromboembolism.,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is common in cancer patients, and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Several factors, including procoagulant agents secreted by tumor cells, immobilization, surgery, indwelling catheters, and systemic treatment (including chemotherapy), contribute to an increased risk of VTE in cancer patients. There is growing interest in instituting primary prophylaxis in high-risk patients to prevent incident (first-time) VTE events. The identification of patients at sufficiently high risk of VTE to warrant primary thromboprophylaxis is essential, as anticoagulation may be associated with a higher risk of bleeding. Current guidelines recommend the use of pharmacological thromboprophylaxis in postoperative and hospitalized cancer patients, as well as ambulatory cancer patients receiving thalidomide or lenalidomide in combination with high-dose dexamethasone or chemotherapy, in the absence of contraindications to anticoagulation. However, the majority of cancer patients are ambulatory, and currently primary thromboprophylaxis is not recommended for these patients, even those considered at very high risk. In this concise review, the authors discuss risk stratification models that have been specifically developed to identify cancer patients at high risk for VTE, and thus might be useful in future studies designed to determine the potential benefit of primary thromboprophylaxis."

In contrast, antifibrinolytic drugs can reduce blood loss in this setting, but there is concern that they may increase thrombotic complications. Published guidelines are limited by a lack of large randomized trials addressing the risks and benefits of each of these commonly used therapies in cardiac surgery.

CD008201,0,24655745,0,AFib in special populations.,"For physicians who see and treat patients who present with AFib in routine clinical practice there are 4 important factors to understand and bear in mind when diagnosing and planning treatment strategies: age, gender, prior or incident heart failure, and underlying coronary artery disease (CAD) and acute coronary syndrome (ACS). (online video available at: http://education.amjmed.com/video.php?event_id=445&stage_id=5&vcs=1). This review addresses the clinical characteristics of each of these presentations in order. For all patients with AFib, of either gender or any age, the greatest risk is failure to prescribe anticoagulation therapy, with currently only about half of these patients are being prescribed anticoagulation therapy, a percentage that is often much lower in the elderly, where only about 1 in 3 eligible patients receive anticoagulation. This highlights the most important clinical point for physicians: first, diagnose! This means ensuring the simple procedure of taking the pulse; if that is irregular, then record the ECG and look for AFib. After these 2 simple steps, physicians should be aware of the 2 most important risk scoring systems at present, CHADS2, which has been updated as the CHAD2DS2 vascular score (CHA2DS2-VASc); the latter takes gender into account and is a more sensitive scoring system for differentiating truly low-risk patients from those who may appear to be low risk, but actually are at significant risk. As discussed, while the 2012 ESC guidelines recommend a shift toward a greater emphasis on identifying patients who are truly low-risk (vs those who are only apparently low risk), the US emphasis is on identifying the high-risk patients, and how use of the CHADS2 versus CHA2DS2-VASc to accomplish these 2 goals is outlined. Two further important subpopulations of AFib patients are those with congestive heart failure (CHF) and those with acute coronary syndromes (ACS). As discussed, the real progress that has been seen in the prognosis of CHF has not been seen for patients with CHF and concomitant AFib, meaning that even with optimal therapy, the patient with AFib who develops CHF is at higher risk of mortality. The challenge for patients with ACS and AFib is that their ACS will probably require antiplatelet therapy, and addition of anticoagulation therapy as prophylaxis against stroke and systemic embolism because of the AFib creates the problem of so-called ""triple therapy."" This review includes a clinical decision algorithm for balancing the lowest risk of thromboembolic events against the highest risk of bleeding in patients who must receive triple therapy. Finally, this review concludes with a brief overview of the possible benefits of the NOACs in these populations, while also emphasizing that all clinicians-especially primary care physicians, who may become the principal caregivers for these patients with AFib in the era of NOACs-should be familiar with one of current bleeding scores, perhaps the best of which is the HAS-BLED score, which includes patients who have hypertension, abnormal renal or liver function, bleeding history, predisposition or labile INR, elderly patients who are frail or >65 years, or with a history of drugs/alcohol concomitantly."
CD008201,0,25087291,0,"[Treatment of very old patients with non valvular atrial fibrillation. The valuable opportunity offered by new oral anticoagulants, to be cautiously used].","Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is the most frequent cardiac arrhythmia and its incidence increases with age reaching a 10% prevalence in the oldest old. Patients with AF have a five-fold increase in the risk of stroke. Current guidelines on AF management recommend the prescription of oral anticoagulant therapy in patients at medium and high risk of thromboembolic events. Advanced age is a risk factor for stroke in AF, but despite clear evidences a high rate of OAT under prescription is reported and particularly in the oldest old. Among the main causes of this phenomenon an enhanced risk of bleeding is often reported: this due to several factors: risk of falls, the presence of comorbidity and polifarmacy and a reduction in compliance and adherence that are common in the elderly. In recent years the international scenario in the management of OAT has significantly changed since the introduction of the new oral anticoagulants (NOA): Dabigatran, a direct thrombin inhibitor, and two oral factor Xa inhibitors Rivaroxaban and Apixaban, which have all been tested in randomized clinical trial (RELY, ROCKET-AF e ARISTOTLE) which have demonstrated non inferiority compared to warfarin in the prevention of thromboembolic events with an optimal safety profile. NOA could be an important therapeutic opportunity for stroke prevention in elderly patients with AF even if the substantial differences in mean age, anthropometric measures and comorbidity of the patients enrolled in these trials compared with those of the real world setting, oblige some caution and discussion."
CD008201,0,21268568,0,Antiplatelet therapy in the perioperative period.,"Antiplatelet drugs are the cornerstone treatment in the secondary prevention of arterial thrombosis. Until recently, their intake was interrupted in the perioperative period because of fear for bleeding, but new insights have challenged this old habit: In patients at high risk for atherothrombotic events who need to undergo surgery or an invasive procedure, the risk for bleeding complications because of a treatment with low-dose acetylsalicylic acid (LD ASA) needs to be balanced against the risk of atherothrombotic events after treatment discontinuation. For patients at high risk of atherothrombotic complications recent guidelines do no longer advocate to interrupt LD ASA routinely. However, the likelihood of bleeding versus atherothrombotic complications should be considered on a case-by-case basis. When continued perioperatively, the bleeding risk associated with thienopyridines (ticlopidine, clopidogrel and prasugrel) is higher than that of LD ASA. It is recommended to stop their intake 1 week before the surgical intervention, except in patients with (recent) coronary stenting."

CD008201,0,21127701,0,Low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol: current status and future strategies for management.,"Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is the foremost cause of death and disability in the Western world, and it is rapidly becoming so in the developing nations. Even though the use of statin therapy aiming at the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) has significantly reduced cardiovascular events and mortality, substantial residual cardiac events still occur in those being treated to the currently recommended targets. In fact, residual risk is also seen in those who are treated ""aggressively"" such as the ""high risk"" patients so defined by the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III). Consequently, one must look for the predictors of risk beyond LDL reduction. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) is the next frontier. The protectiveness of elevated HDL against atherosclerosis is well described in the literature. HDL subdues several atherogenic processes, such as oxidation, inflammation, cell proliferation and thrombosis. It also helps mobilize the excess LDL via reverse cholesterol transport. Low levels of HDL have been shown to be independent predictors of risk. Thus, therapies to raise the HDL hold promise for additional cardiac risk reduction. In this regard, several randomized trials have recently tested this hypothesis, especially in patients at high risk. In addition to the use of aggressive lifestyle modification, clinical outcomes have been measured following augmentation of HDL levels with various treatment modalities, including aggressive statin therapy, combination therapy with fibrates and niacin, and direct HDL-raising drug treatments. These data for low HDL as an independent risk factor and as the new treatment target are reviewed in this paper."
CD008201,0,18199102,0,Adult nephrotic syndrome: non-specific strategies for treatment.,"Irrespective of aetiology, the nephrotic syndrome presents a range of potentially serious complications. These include thrombo-embolism, infection and hyperlipidaemia. Despite the prevalence of the nephrotic state among renal patients, there has been little prospective analysis of the therapeutic approach to these potentially life-threatening events even though their pathogenesis has been examined in some detail. Most of these complications are more prevalent once the albumin concentration falls below 20 g/L and it is recognized that restoration of serum albumin significantly diminishes their frequency. However, this may be difficult to achieve, especially in adults. The problems of thrombo-embolism and infection are of immediate concern but, in persistent cases, the additional issues of hyperlipidaemia and loss of bone density also require consideration for therapy. Thus, in addition to specific attempts to reduce proteinuria, it is recommended that high-risk nephrotic patients receive anticoagulation, pneumococcal vaccination and lipid lowering therapy. Strategies for the preservation of bone density should also be considered, particularly in patients who receive high-dose corticosteroids. Among a range of non-specific treatments for proteinuria, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors appear best in terms of efficacy and safety. Prospective trials are required to clarify the longitudinal impact of these generic strategies on the protection of the persistently nephrotic patient."

CD008201,0,23159964,0,Use of eptifibatide as a bridge antiplatelet agent for intrathecal drug delivery system placement.,"Use of antiplatelet agents is becoming increasingly common, and their management may require new strategies if neuroaxial techniques are to be employed in patients who will not tolerate discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy. The patient was a 46-year-old man with a past medical history significant for coronary artery disease and who had undergone 14 stents. He developed stent thrombosis (ST) while on clopidogrel. Following the ST, he was subsequently placed on prasugrel. While on prasugrel, the patient presented for an intrathecal drug delivery system (IDDS) trial and placement due to severe peripheral neuropathy unresponsive to several conservative medical treatments. He had previously undergone an unsuccessful spinal cord stimulator trial and received no pain relief. In consultation with his outside cardiologist, the patient received permission to hold his prasugrel for 7 days prior to his intrathecal pump trial. During the trial period's inpatient hospitalization, the patient developed chest pain. In consultation with the cardiology service in our institution, it was decided antiplatelet therapy should be re-instituted. The patient was bridged to his IDDS placement after the trial with intravenous eptifibatide. The eptifibatide drip was administered 6 hours prior to the IDDS implant. Functional platelet count was checked one hour before the IDDS was placed and the pump was placed without incident. The eptifibatide drip was reinstituted one hour after the IDDS implantation. The patient was observed for 24 hours on the eptifibatide drip, transitioned to his home dose of prasugrel, and discharged home. At outpatient follow-up one week later, the patient demonstrated no neurologic or hemorrhagic complications and was satisfied with the pain control provided by the IDDS. Prasugrel is an irreversible platelet inhibitor, which prevents ADP-induced platelet aggregation by binding the P2Y12 receptor. Patients taking prasugrel will have deficient platelet activity until new platelets have been produced, a span of approximately 7 days. Eptifibatide is an intravenous glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor with a short half-life of ½ hours. Inhibition of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa prevents platelet activation and aggregation. The drug effect ceases once it is discontinued and restoration of platelet function is not dependent upon new platelet production. Patients requiring antiplatelet therapy in need of neuroaxial pain management procedures present challenging problems to pain management physicians. Current guidelines from the American Society of Regional Anesthesia have not identified any bridging agent suitable for patients who may not tolerate prolonged withdrawal from their antiplatelet therapy. In this case, eptifibatide was successfully utilized to bridge a patient whose comorbid conditions necessitated continuous antiplatelet therapy without the prolonged washout common to irreversible antiplatelet agents."
CD008201,0,16304421,0,Thrombosis and the antiphospholipid syndrome.,"The antiphospholipid syndrome is an antibody-mediated hypercoagulable state characterized by recurrent venous and arterial thromboembolic events. Several studies have determined that the frequency of antiphospholipid syndrome in patients presenting with a venous thromboembolic event is between 4% and 14%. Because of the high risk for recurrent thromboembolism in these patients, current recommendations suggest a longer, potentially lifelong, course of antithrombotic therapy following an initial event. Although most authorities agree on an extended course of therapy, considerable controversy surrounds the optimal target therapeutic INR for patients with antiphospholipid syndrome. For an initial venous thromboembolic event, a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 is supported by two prospective, randomized clinical trials. In contrast, relatively limited data exist for an initial arterial thromboembolic event in patients who have the antiphospholipid syndrome, and therapeutic recommendations range from aspirin to warfarin with a high target INR. Recurrent thromboembolic events can be extremely difficult to treat, and some patients may benefit from the addition of immunosuppressive therapies. Importantly, as many as 50% of the initial thromboembolic events sustained by patients with antiphospholipid antibodies occur in the setting of additional, coincident prothrombotic risk factors, indicating the importance of addressing any additional risk factors, such as hypercholesterolemia, in these patients. Prospective studies are needed to address the role of thromboprophylactic strategies in asymptomatic individuals with antiphospholipid antibodies in the absence of additional risk factors."

CD008201,0,25018062,0,Thrombosis and hemostatic abnormalities in hematological malignancies.,"There is a paucity of data that pertain to thrombosis in patients with hematological malignancies. Recent studies showed that patients with lymphoma, multiple myeloma, and acute leukemia have an increased thrombotic risk, particularly at the time of diagnosis and during chemotherapy. We searched the PubMed database for articles on thromboembolic complications in patients with hematological malignancies published between 1996 and 2013. The incidence of thrombotic events is variable, and is influenced by the type and the stage of hematological malignancy, the antitumor therapy, and the use of central venous devices. The pathogenesis of thromboembolic disease in hematological malignancies is multifactorial. Tumor cell-derived procoagulant, fibrinolytic, or proteolytic factors, and inflammatory cytokines affect clotting activation, and chemotherapy and immunomodulatory drugs increase the thrombotic risk in patients with lymphoma, acute leukemia, and multiple myeloma. Infections might also contribute to the pathogenesis of the thromboembolic complications: endotoxins from gram-negative bacteria induce the release of tissue factor, tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-1b, and gram-positive organisms can release bacterial mucopolysaccharides that directly activate factor XII. In the setting of plasma cell dyscrasias, hyperviscosity, decreased fibrinolysis, procoagulant autoantibody production, inflammatory cytokines, acquired activated protein C resistance, and the prothrombotic effects of antimyeloma agents might be the cause of thromboembolic complications. Anticoagulant therapy is very complicated because of high risk of hemorrhage. Therefore, an accurate estimate of a patient's thrombotic risk is essential to allow physicians to target thromboprophylaxis in high-risk patients."

These patients are at particularly high risk of thromboembolism (Scylla) but also of the hemorrhagic complications of thromboprophylaxis (Charybdis). A frequent compromise is to use as antithrombotic agents instead of vitamin-K antagonists aspirin or other antiplatelet drugs, which are ineffective for thromboprophylaxis in the oldest old and definitely not free from a high risk of severe bleeding. All the new direct anticoagulants currently licensed (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban) are at least as effective as warfarin for thromboprophylaxis in AF, but the risk of the intracranial bleeding, the most feared complication of anticoagulant therapy, is at least halved. In the oldest patients of 80 years of age or more preliminary data, available so far only for dabigatran, indicate that the favorable outcomes of direct anticoagulants are also present in this subgroup, often left untreated for fear of intracranial bleeding. The choice between the different direct anticoagulants is driven by the presence or not of renal insufficiency, the presence and degree of multimorbidity and polypharmacy and by the likelihood or not of poor treatment adherence in patients who are often frail and with some degree of cognitive impairment."

CD008201,0,19178131,0,Extended dalteparin prophylaxis for venous thromboembolic events: cost-utility analysis in patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery.,"Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) are manifestations of venous thromboembolic events (VTEs). Patients undergoing major surgical procedures such as total hip replacement (THR), total knee replacement (TKR), and hip fracture surgery (HFS) are at an elevated risk for VTEs. The American College of Chest Physicians' (ACCP) guidelines recommend that such patients receive thromboprophylaxis for at least 10 days. In patients undergoing THR or HFS, extended prophylaxis for up to 28-35 days is the recommended approach for those at high risk of thromboembolic events. The NAFT (North American Fragmin Trial) compared the prophylactic efficacy of dalteparin with that of warfarin during the in-hospital period, and with that of placebo during the period of hospital discharge until day 35 postsurgery, in patients who underwent total hip arthroplasty. During both the in-hospital and the postdischarge time periods, dalteparin significantly reduced the occurrence of DVT. Given the clinical relevance of these results, the low specificity of the ACCP recommendations regarding optimal prophylaxis duration, and the importance of optimizing the efficiency of DVT prophylaxis in the practice setting, a cost-utility analysis was conducted comparing dalteparin 10-day and 35-day (extended) with a warfarin 10-day protocol, in patients undergoing major orthopedic surgeries such as THR, TKR, or HFS."
CD008201,0,26056799,0,Chronic Complications After Femoral Central Venous Catheter-related Thrombosis in Critically Ill Children.,"Prescription of thromboprophylaxis is not a common practice in pediatric intensive care units. Most thrombi are catheter-related and asymptomatic, without causing acute complications. However, chronic complications of these (a)symptomatic catheter-related thrombi, that is, postthrombotic syndrome (PTS) and residual thrombosis have not been studied. To investigate these complications, critically ill children of 1 tertiary center with percutaneous inserted femoral central venous catheters (FCVCs) were prospectively followed. Symptomatic FCVC-thrombosis occurred in 10 of the 134 children (7.5%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.4-9.5). Only FCVC-infection appeared to be independently associated (P=0.001) with FCVC-thrombosis. At follow-up 2 of the 5 survivors diagnosed with symptomatic thrombosis developed mild PTS; one of them had an occluded vein on ultrasonography. A survivor without PTS had a partial occluded vein at follow-up. Asymptomatic FCVC-thrombosis occurred in 3 of the 42 children (7.1%; 95% CI, 0.0-16.7) screened by ultrasonography within 72 hours after catheter removal. At follow-up, mild PTS was present in 6 of the 33 (18.2%; 95% CI, 6.1-30.3) screened children. Partial and total vein occlusion was present in 1 (3%) and 4 (12%) children, respectively. In conclusion, children on pediatric intensive care units are at risk for (a)symptomatic FCVC-thrombosis, especially children with FCVC-infection. Chronic complications of FCVC-thrombosis are common. Therefore, thromboprophylaxis guidelines are warranted in pediatric intensive care units to minimize morbidity as a result of FCVC-thrombosis."

CD008201,0,18226435,0,Aspirin and other antiplatelet drugs in the prevention of venous thromboembolism.,"While there is good evidence for a protective effect of aspirin against occlusive vascular events in individuals with arterial disease, its role in preventing venous thromboembolism (VTE) is unclear. In this article we review the role of aspirin and other antiplatelet drugs in prevention of venous thromboembolism in surgical patients, high risk medical patients requiring aspirin for other reasons, patients with myeloproliferative disorders, long distance travellers and patients receiving treatment with the IMiD class of drugs. Overall, data from the PEP study and Anti-Platelet Trialists' systematic review show that aspirin reduces the risk of VTE by around 25% in high risk surgical patients. Data from retrospective and before/after studies also suggest efficacy in reducing VTE in myeloma patients on IMiD drugs in combination with dexamethasone or chemotherapy. However, there has been no direct comparison with coumarins or heparin to indicate that aspirin is the optimal form of thromboprophylaxis. In patients who require aspirin because of high risk of arterial vascular occlusion (including patients with polycythaemia vera and essential thrombocythaemia), the additional small reduction in VTE risk is an added benefit with no additional risk associated. There is no evidence for a role of aspirin in prevention of travel-related thrombosis. At present there is no clear evidence that aspirin is the drug of choice for the prevention of VTE in any patient group."

CD008201,0,24488527,0,Warfarin overdose: a 25-year experience.,"Warfarin, a vitamin K antagonist, is widely used for the prophylaxis and treatment of thromboembolic disease. While guidelines exist for management of a supratherapeutic international normalized ratio following therapeutic warfarin use, these guidelines are not designed for management of the acute warfarin overdose. There is a paucity of literature describing the latter. The primary objective of this manuscript is to characterize the coagulopathy and describe the bleeding events that occur after a warfarin overdose. A secondary goal is to describe the amount of vitamin K administered to patients presenting with warfarin overdoses. A retrospective chart review of patients admitted with an acute warfarin overdose at two tertiary care medical centers in the USA was conducted. Clinical characteristics were abstracted, and bleeding categories (major, minor, trivial) were defined a priori. Twenty-three patients were admitted during the time period; males accounted for 15/23 (62.5 %) subjects. The median (interquartile range (IQR)) age was 43 (32-48.5) years. Seventeen subjects received vitamin K, with a median (IQR) dose of 15 (10-50) mg. The maximal total amount of vitamin K administered to a single patient during the index hospitalization was 110 mg. Three bleeding events occurred; one classified as major, and two as minor. All patients made a full recovery.

In the past few years, 3 large randomized clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of prophylaxis of VTE in the medical setting. The prophylaxis in MEDical patients with ENOXaparin (MEDENOX), Prospective Evaluation of Dalteparin Efficacy for PREVENTion of VTE in Immobilized Patients Trial (PREVENT), and ARixta for ThromboEmbolism Prevention in a Medical Indications Study (ARTEMIS) studies have compared the low-molecular-weight heparins enoxaparin and dalteparin, and the specific factor Xa inhibitor fondaparinux, respectively, with placebo in acutely ill medical patients hospitalized with heart failure, respiratory failure, infectious disease, or inflammatory disease. All studies showed both a statistically significant reduction in the rate of venous thromboembolic events (as assessed by venography or compression ultrasonography) and a rate of major bleeding events that were comparable to placebo.

Although low-molecular-weight heparin monotherapy has been identified as a simple and efficacious regimen compared with an initial parenteral anticoagulant followed by long-term therapy with a vitamin K antagonist, many clinical questions remain unanswered. These include optimal duration of anticoagulant therapy, treatment of recurrent VTE, and the treatment of patients with concurrent bleeding or those with a high risk of bleeding. Treatment recommendations from consensus clinical guidelines are largely based on retrospective reports or extrapolated data from the noncancer population with VTE, as randomized controlled trials focused on cancer-associated thrombosis are sorely lacking. Furthermore, with improvements in imaging technology and extended survival duration of patients with cancer, we are encountering more unique challenges, such as the management of incidental VTE. Clinicians should be aware of the limitations of the novel oral anticoagulants and avoid the use of these agents because of the paucity of evidence in the treatment of cancer-associated thrombosis."

CD008201,0,20887966,0,Implications of the CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc and HAS-BLED Scores for thromboprophylaxis in atrial fibrillation.,"There is increasing recognition of the value of oral anticoagulation for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation, as well as the availability of new oral anticoagulants that overcome the limitations of warfarin, implying that even more atrial fibrillation patients will be using oral anticoagulation, with the role of aspirin being less defined. Thus, we need a paradigm shift so that stroke risk assessment can be simplified in the identification of those patients who are truly at low risk (ie, CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc [Congestive heart failure, Hypertension, Age ≥75 years, Diabetes mellitus, Stroke, Vascular disease, Age 65-74 years, Sex category] score=0) who could be treated with no antithrombotic therapy, and all others (ie, CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc score ≥1), would be considered for oral anticoagulation. A simple bleeding risk assessment can clearly help guide office management here. The new HAS-BLED (Hypertension, Abnormal renal/liver function, Stroke, Bleeding history or predisposition, Labile International Normalized Ratio, Elderly, Drugs/alcohol concomitantly) bleeding risk schema has been proposed as a simple, easy calculation to assess bleeding risk in atrial fibrillation patients, whereby a score of ≥3 indicates ""high risk"" and some caution and regular review of the patient is needed, following the initiation of antithrombotic therapy, whether with oral anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy."

CD008201,0,19303498,0,Unanswered questions in venous thromboembolism.,"We have made great strides in the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Despite these advances, however, questions remain. Perhaps the most important unmet need is the development and implementation of strategies to increase the uptake of guidelines for thromboprophylaxis. VTE is largely preventable with appropriate prophylaxis. New oral anticoagulants have the potential to further streamline VTE prevention and treatment. Although heparin, low molecular weight heparins or fondaparinux are frequently used for thromboprophylaxis in hospitalized medical or surgical patients, these agents are not ideal for out-of-hospital use. There is now good evidence that patients undergoing major orthopaedic surgery require extended thromboprophylaxis. Medical patients may also benefit from extended prophylaxis. The new oral anticoagulants will be more convenient than existing agents for this purpose and will help physicians and patients to adhere to optimal preventive strategies. VTE treatment also may be simplified with the new oral anticoagulants. With a rapid onset of action, these drugs may obviate the need for a parenteral anticoagulant for initial therapy. In addition, the new agents have the potential to streamline extended VTE therapy because, unlike vitamin K antagonists, they can be given in fixed doses without the need for coagulation monitoring."

This paper examines recent national trends in admission rates and mortality for PE to help inform clinical practice. Admissions to NHS hospitals in England between 1 April 1996 and 31 March 2006 were studied. Trends in admission rates, the proportion of all admissions with PE as primary or secondary diagnosis and hospital mortality following PE identified. There were 251,449 admissions with a diagnosis of pulmonary embolus in the study period. Non-elective admission rates rose from 28.0 per 100,000 in 1996/7 to 32.1 per 100,000 in 2005/6. There was a significant increase in secondary diagnosis rates and a clear seasonal pattern with excess admissions in winter. There was significant in-hospital mortality for both primary (13%) and secondary diagnosis (31%). Mortality decreased over time and was highest among the elderly. Pulmonary embolism is associated with a significant mortality although overall trends in mortality are improving in England.

CD008201,0,9951075,0,[Therapeutic recommendations. Secondary prevention of cerebral vascular accident].,"The guidelines for secondary stroke prevention, graded following available scientific evidence, are presented. Stroke and TIA are defined and the indications for referral established. Basic assessment of stroke patients should include laboratory evaluation, ECG, brain CT, ultrasound examination of the extracranial vessels for events in the carotid distribution, and transthoracic or transesophageal echocardiogram if cardioembolism is suspected. The pharmacological and non-pharmacological reduction of blood pressure and serum cholesterol, stopping smoking and reducing alcohol intake are general measures recommended for secondary stroke prevention, together with healthier life-style changes (eating a Mediterranean type diet and performing regular moderate physical exercise). Concerning antithrombotic therapy, oral anticoagulants are recommended for patients with atrial fibrillation and other high to medium emboligenic cardiac risk conditions. Antiplatelet drugs are recommended for all other survivors of an ischemic cerebral event. Aspirin (75-325 mg/day) is the drug of choice. Alternative antiplatelet agents are clopidrogrel, ticlopidine, dipiridamol or triflusal. They can be used in patients with intolerance or contraindication to aspirin or in high-risk subjects.

CD008201,0,9274836,0,Guidelines for looking at the antiphospholipid antibodies in systemic lupus erythematosus.,"Lupus anticoagulant (LA), anticardiolipin (aCL), and/or antiphospholipid (aPL) antibodies are the hallmarks of the antiphospholipid syndrome, characterized by widespread thrombosis. The syndrome has been described as primary or secondary when aCL/aPL are the only classes of detectable autoantibodies or occur in the context of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or SLE-like disease. However, since LA/aCL/aPL have been extensively looked for, it has become evident that they may also be detected in the absence of any clinical correlation with thrombosis. In particular, among SLE patients, these antibodies mean a high risk of thrombosis only in a small subset, sharing clinical features with primary antiphospholipid syndrome. As laboratory examination is still unable to distinguish between high-risk and non-high-risk antiphospholipid antibodies, it is crucial to have some reasonable criteria able to guide the day-to-day clinical practice. We attempt to trace the following guidelines: (1) distinguish between transient and persistent LA/aCL/aPL results; (2) do not forget the LA phenomenon in the era of aCL/aPL; (3) maintain a strict communication with the laboratory; (4) exclude other causes of primary coagulation abnormalities; (5) look at the time of appearance of LA/aCL/aPL with respect to thrombosis; (6) analyze any possible laboratory clue putatively useful to distinguish between 'rouge' and 'non-rouge' LA/aCL/aPL; (7) look for signs of widespread noninflammatory vasculopathy; (8) do not engage a war to the knife against LA/aCL/aPL by immunosuppressive therapies."

CD008201,0,19492151,0,Bridging of oral anticoagulation with low-molecular-weight heparin: experience in 373 patients with renal insufficiency undergoing invasive procedures.,"If surgery or another intervention is planned, current guidelines recommend bridging oral anticoagulation (OAC) with heparins in patients at elevated thromboembolic (TE) risk. While patients with renal impairment have a higher risk of bleeding and dosing of heparins is more difficult, there are no specific recommendations for bridging the latter patients. Hence, we aimed to investigate the efficacy and tolerability of using reduced low-molecular-weight heparin (enoxaparin) dosages for bridging of OAC. Three hundred twenty-two hospitalised and 51 ambulatory adult patients at moderate to high TE risk were enrolled. Patients with renal insufficiency (n=274 with creatinine clearance [CrCl] 30-50 ml/min and n=99 with CrCl 20-29 ml/min) received after discontinuation of OAC therapy enoxaparin 1mg/ kg once daily. Surgery was performed at international normalised ratio (INR) <1.5. Mean time between the last enoxaparin dose and procedure was 26.8 +/- 2.7 hours. Within 30 days of individual follow-up, no case of TE was observed (0 %; 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0- 0.9). A total of 30 bleeding events (8.0 %; CI 5.5-11.3) occurred (3 major [0.8 %; CI 0.2-2.3] and 27 minor [7.2 %; CI 4.8-10.4]). Bleeding events occurred in 6.5% (CI 3.9-10.2) of patients with CrCl 30-50 ml/min and in 12.1% (CI 6.4-20.2) of patients with CrCl 20-29 ml/min (p between groups =0.08). Logistic regression analysis identified the CHADS(2) score as the only independent haemorrhagic risk factor (p= 0.03). No heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT-II) was reported. Bridging therapy could be performed in 51 (13.7%) ambulatory patients. In renally impaired patients undergoing bridging of OAC, the use of a priori reduced dosage of enoxaparin was not compromised by any TE events. It appeared well tolerated as the rate of major bleeds was low."
CD008201,0,17581513,0,Compliance with Low Molecular Weight Heparin in abulatory orthopedic patients.,"Background The prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism with unfractioned heparins (UFH) was introduced in 1970s and initially applied only in high-risk orthopedic surgery patients. While further studies proved its importance also in those with lower risk, it was the development of LMWH, that enabled wide practical application. The primary objective of this study was to provide a complex evaluation of actual compliance with self-administered Low Molecular Weight Heparin in ambulatory orthopedic patients. Assessment of incidence of LMWH side-effects and thromboembolic episodes despite proper prophylaxis were defined as secondary objectives. Material and methods The research was conducted in Brodnowski Hospital, Warsaw and WSzZ Hospital, Kielce. The group consisted of n=120 (58 females, age 17-82) patients. The selection criteria were: having plaster immobilization definitely removed and being prescribed LMWH as a part of the treatment. Participants were given anonymous questionnaires composed of 25 questions. Satisfactory compliance was defined as application of at least 80% of prescribed injections. Results Compliance with LMWH appeared to be satisfactory in 95.8% cases of which 63,6% were fully and 32,2% partially compliant. The most frequent reasons for dose omission were forgetfulness (48.9%), fear of side-effects (20.0%) and side-effects (13.3%). Side effects were observed in 26.7% of drug applying patients and due to this fact 16.4% temporarily stopped injections. Venous thromboembolism was reported in 6.0%. Conclusions Compliance level in great majority proved to be satisfactory, although the necessity of prophylaxis was far from being fully recognized by the patients. It also seemed unaffected by the significant number of side effects. Thromboembolic episodes were sporadically reported."
CD008201,0,17405561,0,[The best of valvular heart disease in 2006].,"In the field of valvular diseases, the year 2006 has been above all marked by the publication of new joint AHA/ACC guidelines. Besides, other publications included severe aortic stenosis, drug therapy in chronic aortic regurgitation, the indications for surgery in asymptomatic mitral regurgitation, as well as valve surgery in the elderly and mismatch severity after aortic valve replacement. In a series of 66 cases of aortic stenosis with poor LV function undergoing stress echocardiography, it has been shown that whether the absence of contractile reserve identifies a high-risk subgroup for aortic valve replacement (33% vs. 6%), this exam does not predict the functional prognosis and the post-operative LV function improvement. Hence, the absence of contractile reserve should not contra-indicate aortic valve replacement surgery, even though the prognosis is severe, since the natural prognosis is extremely severe. The question of aortic valve replacement in case of mild stenosis with the indication of CABG remains difficult. Taking into account the important mortality of redo surgery, a study was in favor of a systematic aortic valve replacement associated to CABG in patients <75 years who had a mean aortic gradient > 30 mmHg, a LVH and aortic valve calcifications. Old patients (>80 years) with severe aortic stenosis have a very severe natural prognosis, authorizing wide indications for aortic valve replacement, in the absence of important comorbidities. The use of vasodilators in severe chronic aortic regurgitation remains debated. In a randomized study comparing Nifedipine 40 mg vs. Enalapril 20 mm vs. placebo, it has been shown that the use of a vasodilator does not modify the time of valvular surgery at all. After a mean follow-up of 7 years, the rates of aortic valve replacement were identical in the 3 groups, and there wa no difference regarding the preoperative regurgitation volume, LV dimensions and mass, and LVEF. The timing for huge chronic and asymptomatic mitral regurgitation remains debated, even though the present trend is to prefer early surgery, due to the risk of sudden death. A new study evidenced the interest of clinical and echocardiographic surveillance on a prospective series of 129 consecutive asymptomatic patients with severe degenerative mitral regurgitation. The surgical indication was only based on the occurrence of symptoms, an echographic LV diameters increase, a LV dysfunction, the presence of pulmonary hypertension or atrial fibrillation. At 8 years, the overall mortality was at 91 + 3%, with a survival rate not statistically different from the expected rates; 35 patients have been operated. The 6-years and 8-years surgical indication-free survival were respectively at 65 +/- 5% and 55 +/- 6%, with a null operative mortality, and favorable data regarding post-operative survival, symptoms and LV function. The indication for surgical correction of mitral regurgitation in the elderly remains a difficult problem, due to the surgical risk. The Mayo Clinic team analyzed the evolution of 284 patients > 75 years operated for mitral regurgitation between 1980 and 1995, compared to younger subjects (65 - 74 years old, n=504, and <65 years, n=556). The age-adjusted 5-years survival was lower in the older patients, but the age-adjusted observed/estimated survival ratios were similar in the different age groups. The perioperative risk, significantly higher in the older patients (p<0.001) decreased systematically for all age ranges in the most recent periods (the 1980-83 period vs. 1992-95), from 27% to 5%, 21% to 4%, and 7% to 2% respectively in patients > 75 years, 65-74 years and <65 years. An age >75 years was an independent predictive factor for the surgical mortality. These data show that, despite the surgical risk, the surgical treatment of mitral regurgitation should be extended to the oldest patients. One of the most surprising information provided in the ACC/AHA guidelines is the necessity of adding a daily dose of 75 to 100 mg of aspirin systematically to VKA in patients with mechanical prosthetic valves or in those with a valvular bioprosthesis with one or several risk factors for thrombo-embolic events (AF, history of thromboembolic event, LV dysfunction, hypercoagulable state). This major recommendation (Class 1, level of evidence B) appears surprising, since it is not actually based on definite results issued from randomized studies using these doses of aspirin. According to these guidelines, this association not only reduces the risk of thrombo-embolic events in patients with valvular prosthesis, but also decreases the mortality related to other cardiovascular causes (especially coronary artery disease), with the cost of a minimal risk augmentation for hemorrhagic complications. The importance of pejorative prognosis of mismatch (defined as an inadequacy between the aortic orifice size and patient's body surface after aortic valve replacement) has been subject to several publications this year. The substantial increase of post-operative events and poor survival in patients with this mismatch imply adapted preventive strategies in terms of selection of diameters and type of aortic valvular prosthesis and associated aortic surgical techniques (such as annular enlargement or supra-annular position)."

Discharge and billing records for patients admitted to any of 16 acute-care hospitals from January 2005 to December 2006 were obtained. Patients 18 years or older who had an inpatient stay >or=2 days and no apparent contraindications for thromboprophylaxis were grouped into the categories of critical care, surgery and medically ill before being assessed for additional VTE risk factors based on the diagnostic criteria outlined in ACCP7. For patients at risk, the recommended type (mechanical or pharmacologic), dose, and duration of thromboprophylaxis was identified based on the guidelines and compared to the regimen actually received, if any. Among the 258,556 hospitalized patients, 68,278 (26.4%) were determined to be at risk of VTE without apparent contraindications for thromboprophylaxis. The proportions of patients who received the appropriate type, dose, and duration of thromboprophylaxis were 10.5, 9.8, and 17.9% for critical care, medical, and surgical patients, respectively. Of those at risk, 36.8% received no thromboprophylaxis and an additional 50.2% received thromboprophylaxis deemed inappropriate for one or more reasons. The implementation of ACCP7 guidelines for type, dosage, and duration of thromboprophylaxis is low in patients at risk of VTE.

CD008201,0,18044139,0,Prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism in the elderly patient.,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common complication among hospitalized patients. Pharmacological thromboprophylaxis has emerged as the cornerstone for VTE prevention. As trials on thromboprophylaxis in medical patients have proven the efficacy of both low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs) and unfractionated heparin (UFH), all acutely medical ill patients should be considered for pharmacological thromboprophylaxis. Unlike in the surgical setting where the risk of associated VTE attributable to surgery is well recognized, and where widespread use of pharmacological thromboprophylaxis and early mobilization has resulted in significant reductions in the risk of VTE, appropriate VTE prophylaxis is under-used in medical patients. Many reasons for this under-use have been identified, including low perceived risk of VTE in medical patients, absence of optimal tools for risk assessment, heterogeneity of patients and their diseases, and fear of bleeding complications. A consistent group among hospitalized medical patients is composed of elderly patients with impaired renal function, a condition potentially associated with bleeding. How these patients should be managed is discussed in this review. Particular attention is devoted to LMWHs and fondaparinux and to measures to improve the safety and the efficacy of their use."

Symptomatic events are relatively rare, but the mortality and morbidity rates of patients demand an attempt to reduce the risk. However, the costs and risks of these attempts must be balanced against the efficacy. Until recently, the simplest and most effective chemical prophylactic method has been low molecular weight heparin, which should be continued for at least 5 weeks after surgery. Recent data show that pentasaccharide is more effective. Chemical agents should be used carefully to avoid bleeding into the surgical wound and spinal cord. Mechanical methods, such as the A-V Impulse Foot Pump (Novamedix, Andover, Hampshire, UK), offer a safe and effective alternative, which is attractive in the perioperative period and could be used as an additional method in patients at high risk of thrombosis.

LMWH are recommended over unfractionated heparins and vitamin K antagonists for initial treatment and secondary prophylaxis (3-6 months) after cancer-related VTE. Long-term secondary prophylaxis should be considered for patients with ongoing active malignancy and low bleeding risk. Due to absence of clinical studies in cancer patients, the use of novel oral anticoagulants is currently not recommended."

CD008201,0,25612280,0,[Pulmonary embolism].,"Acute pulmonary embolism is an important differential diagnosis of acute chest pain. The clinical signs are often non-specific. However, diagnosis and therapy must be done quickly in order to reduce morbidity and mortality. The new (2014) European guidelines for acute pulmonary embolism (PE) focus on risk-adapted diagnostic algorithms and prognosis adapted therapy concepts. According to the hemodynamic presentation the division in a high-risk group (unstable patient with persistent hypotension or shock) or in non-high-risk groups (hemodynamically stable) was proposed. In the high-risk group the immediate diagnosis is usually done by multidetector spiral computed tomography (MDCT) and primarily the medical therapy of right ventricular dysfunction and thrombolysis is recommended.In the non-high-risk group, this is subdivided into an intermediate-risk group and low-risk group, the diagnosis algorithm based on the PE-pretest probability--determined by validated scores. Moreover, the diagnosis is usually secured by MDCT--the new gold standard in the PE-diagnosis, scores, or it can be primarily ruled out due to the high negative predictive value of D-dimer determination. To improve the prognostic risk stratification in non-high-risk group patients the additional detection of right ventricular dysfunction (MDCT, echocardiography), cardiac biomarkers (troponin, NT proBNP) and validated scores (e.g. Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index) is recommended. Therefore, the intermediate-risk group can be further subdivided. For treatment of non-high-risk group patients, the initial anticoagulation (except those with severe renal insufficiency) using low molecular weight heparin/fondaparinux and conversion to vitamin-K antagonists or alternatively with direct oral anticoagulants (DOAK) is recommended. Hemodynamically stable patients with right ventricular dysfunction and myocardial ischemia (Intermediate-high-risk group patients) but with clinically progressive hemodynamic decompensation may benefit from systemic thrombolysis as well. Due to the high risk of bleeding in the PEITHO study, however, a critical individual risk-benefit evaluation should be done. A dose reduced systemic or local ultrasound-assisted thrombolysis could gain importance in the future. For very selected patients in the low-risk group early outpatient treatment could be considered.The diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary embolism remains complex. Improved algorithms support the diagnosis procedures and therapy decisions. Direct oral anticoagulants are a new first-line therapy alternative for hemodynamically stable non-high-risk patients."
CD008201,0,19715379,0,International recommendations for the prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism associated with cancer.,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common complication and a leading cause of death in oncological patients. Recent guidelines have been established for the treatment and prevention of VTE in oncological patients in various clinical situations. These guidelines recommend: (a) prophylactic anticoagulation in all hospitalized oncological patients in whom there are no contraindications; (b) prophylactic anticoagulation in patients scheduled for major oncological surgery in whom there are no contraindications; (c) prolonged (>or=6 months) anticoagulant therapy in oncological patients with manifest VTE in order to prevent a new episode; (d) no routine prophylactic anticoagulation in ambulatory patients without VTE receiving chemotherapy, except when they are receiving treatment with anti-cancer agents with a high risk of thrombogenicity, such as thalidomide- or lenalidomide-based chemotherapeutic regimens; and (e) no use of prophylactic anticoagulants to improve survival in patients with cancer without manifest VTE. Although vitamin K antagonists, unfractionated heparin and in some cases fondaparinux sodium could be used for the treatment of VTE, low molecular weight heparins are recommended for initial and continuous anticoagulant treatment in oncological patients with VTE, as well as for its prevention."

A random sample of 624 patients consisting of every fourth admission was chosen. The stratification of risk factors was assessed using Caprini model and the ACCP score. The mean age of the patients (229 males and 395 females) was 45.34 +/- 18.3 years. More than 80% of the admitted patients were considered at high risk for VTE but heparin was used in only 26% of the patients. The majority of our patients constitute a high-risk population.

CD008201,0,23204871,0,Prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism in medical patients: too much or too little?,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a potentially serious complication occurring in 1%-2% of hospitalized medical patients. Despite this low absolute risk, as many as 82% of medical patients are considered to be at increased risk of developing VTE and are eligible for medical thromboprophylaxis. In this commentary, The author will discuss the main findings of a recent paper published in Clinical Epidemiology that questions the large proportion of individuals who are eligible for medical thromboprophylaxis, and also discuss the potential implications for the prevention of VTE. The recent paper demonstrated that when a population is divided into high- and low-risk groups, the maximum absolute risk depends on the inverse of the proportion of patients that is considered to be high risk. Consequently, even an effective treatment will only result in a small reduction in the absolute risk when the high-risk group comprises the largest proportion of this population. For medical thromboprophylaxis, this implies that even patients considered to be at high-risk for developing VTE have a maximum absolute VTE risk of 2% when the overall risk is 1.6%. Therefore, even an effective preventive initiative will only result in a small risk reduction. This small potential benefit should be weighed against potential harms associated with prophylaxis, mainly bleeding events. Still, there may be a reasonable overall balance between prevention of pulmonary embolism and major bleeding, mainly because major bleeding events are rare. Nonetheless, this discussion underscores that future risk prediction models should aim to predict the benefits and harms in individual patients in order to provide optimal care for the right patients."
CD008201,0,8675895,0,Nursing assessment of clients at risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT): the Autar DVT scale.,"Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) poses a threat to hospitalized clients' recovery. It is preventable and the cost of treating this problem is considerably more than that of preventative practices. Accurate DVT risk assessment facilitates the application of the most appropriate venous thromboprophylaxis. Founded on Virchow's triad of risk factors in the genesis of deep vein thrombosis, the Autar DVT scale was developed as a predictive index. The DVT scale is composed of the following seven risk categories: increasing age, build and body mass index (BMI), immobility, special DVT risk, trauma, surgery and high risk disease. The DVT scale was tested on two trauma wards and the study was essentially a data generating exercise. Clinical data were gathered on 21 clients to validate the reliability, sensitivity and specificity of the DVT scale. Pearson moment correlation coefficient (r) and total percentage agreement (T%) measurement yielded a value of r at 0.98 and a T% ranging between 70% and 87% respectively for both reliability studies. Predictive validity of the scale calculated from a threshold score of 16 achieved 100% sensitivity and 81% specificity. The Autar DVT scale has produced some interesting results and holds considerable promise as a predictive index. However, as this was a small study further testing in diverse clinical areas of a large client population is recommended."

Surprisingly, the incidence has not declined over the last 30 years, and now with more health care interventions, such as pacer/defibrillators, and an increasingly elderly population with degenerative valvular heart disease, the number susceptible to endocarditis is actually increasing. Given the weak evidence for endocarditis prophylaxis, there remains a large population at risk. Much has been learned recently about the pathogenesis of endocarditis, including the role of endothelial damage, platelet adhesion, and microbial adherence to the vegetation or intact valvular tissue. Three-fourths of patients have preexisting structural heart disease. Once infection is manifest, major cardiac complications include congestive heart failure, embolization, mycotic aneurysms, renal dysfunction, and abscess formation. The diagnosis of endocarditis has been enhanced recently by modifications in the Duke criteria to include the use of transesophageal echocardiography and microbial antibody titers. Surgery continues to play an important role, with criteria for emergency, urgent, and early surgery now defined. The major organisms involved in infective endocarditis include streptococci and staphylococcus (representing 75% or so of all cases). Enterococcal infections account for many of the remaining cases, although small series and case reports suggest almost all organisms that infect humans can be implicated at times. A sizeable number of ""culture-negative"" cases still occur despite all the improvements in diagnostic methodology. Recent guidelines for the diagnosis, treatment, and management of infective endocarditis from the American Heart Association are reviewed and the issues surrounding prophylaxis are summarized. International cooperative databases are now being developed that hold promise for a continual reexamination of the epidemiology of this highly aggressive disease and may help provide sorely needed prospective trial data that will enhance our understanding and treatment."

The results showed that despite an established unit policy, only 43% of patients undergoing primary hip replacement and 14% undergoing revision replacement received subcutaneous heparin. All patients undergoing primary and revision total knee replacement received subcutaneous heparin, but 75% of these patients received an incorrect dose. Use of TED stockings in patients who had sustained a fractured neck of the femur, ranged from 0% to 70% depending on the type of fixation. Use of subcutaneous heparin in these patients ranged between 0% and 20% and inclusion into the PEP trial from 0% to 20%. The results of this study were presented to the clinicians working in the orthopaedic department and 3 months later the audit cycle was completed by repeating the study. It was found there was a statistically significant improvement in the administration of subcutaneous heparin and in the wearing of TED stockings in the joint arthroplasty group as well as in the inclusion of hip fracture patients into the PEP trial. This study demonstrates that established protocols are of little value unless audited and that completion of the audit cycle is essential.

A full arsenal of effective pharmacological and mechanical methods can help prevent VTE and many professional organizations have provided extensive evidence-based statements for VTE prophylaxis. Disappointingly, however, VTE has remained the major preventable cause of hospital death. Adherence rate to clinical guidelines is undesirably low. Many real-world patients have also been excluded from VTE prevention trials and hence practice guidelines recommendations. The comprehensive and repetitious formats of many available guidelines also limit their readability and applicability by nonthrombosis specialists. Moreover, some patients suffer from VTE despite complying with the contemporary prophylaxis regimens. Besides, significant heterogeneity exists in thromboprophylaxis practice and pitfalls between different countries. Last but not the least; although many at-risk patients are underprophylaxed, there is evidence to suggest that overprophylaxis (i.e., prescription of thromboprophylaxis in low-risk patients) comprises another important problem. We review the thromboprophylaxis practice and pitfalls around the world and provide recommendations on how the major obstacles can be overcome."

CD008201,0,10364776,0,Deep venous thrombosis: early discharge strategies and outpatient management.,"Conventional management of acute deep venous thrombosis (DVT) consists of initiating continuous infusion intravenous unfractionated heparin (UFH) for 5 days in the hospital as well as warfarin. Low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs) appear to confer similar protection against recurrent DVT compared with UFH but exhibit prolonged bioavailability; increased ease of dosing, and fewer side effects. The advent of LMWH has resulted in increased numbers of patients undergoing initial management of acute DVT with only several days of hospitalization. While 3-month follow-up studies with LMWH demonstrate similar efficacy and safety to UFH, longer term experience with these new agents is necessary to determine their optimal use and safety. We suggest a system for triage in the initial management of DVT patients for: (1) complete outpatient management with LMWH, or (2) short-term hospitalization for initiation of LMWH, or (3) 5-day hospitalization for treatment with UFH. A review of DVT management with LMWH and algorithms for each of these pathways are provided."

An anticoagulation clinic established by the pharmacy service at the Denver VA Medical Center cares for 600 patients by using 1.35 fulltime-equivalent pharmacists. The pharmacists are privileged by medical staff to write prescriptions for warfarin, adjust warfarin dosages, and conduct appropriate laboratory monitoring. A protocol has been developed to standardize care. Patients referred to the clinic are scheduled for a same-day warfarin class and laboratory so that International Normalized Ratios (INRs) are available for the patient's appointment with the pharmacist; the patient's understanding of the material presented in the class is assessed during this appointment.

CD008201,0,23674896,0,Potential role of new anticoagulants for prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism in cancer patients.,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE), encompassing deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, represents a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with cancer. Low molecular weight heparins are the preferred option for anticoagulation in cancer patients according to current clinical practice guidelines. Fondaparinux may also have a place in prevention of VTE in hospitalized cancer patients with additional risk factors and for initial treatment of VTE. Although low molecular weight heparins and fondaparinux are effective and safe, they require daily subcutaneous administration, which may be problematic for many patients, particularly if long-term treatment is needed. Studying anticoagulant therapy in oncology patients is challenging because this patient group has an increased risk of VTE and bleeding during anticoagulant therapy compared with the population without cancer. Risk factors for increased VTE and bleeding risk in these patients include concomitant treatments (surgery, chemotherapy, placement of central venous catheters, radiotherapy, hormonal therapy, angiogenesis inhibitors, antiplatelet drugs), supportive therapies (ie, steroids, blood transfusion, white blood cell growth factors, and erythropoiesis-stimulating agents), and tumor-related factors (local vessel damage and invasion, abnormalities in platelet function, and number). New anticoagulants in development for prophylaxis and treatment of VTE include parenteral compounds for once-daily administration (ie, semuloparin) or once-weekly dosing (ie, idraparinux and idrabiotaparinux), as well as orally active compounds (ie, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, betrixaban). In the present review, we discuss the pharmacology of the new anticoagulants, the results of clinical trials testing these new compounds in VTE, with special emphasis on studies that included cancer patients, and their potential advantages and drawbacks compared with existing therapies."

The preoperative management depends on the original indication for long-term anticoagulation, the interval since the last thromboembolic event, and the extent and type of surgery planned. Only patients who are undergoing major surgery, and who have a high risk of recurrent thrombosis or embolism, require preoperative admission to hospital and conversion to an intravenous heparin regimen. Patients undergoing minor surgery may require no change to their oral anticoagulation. The remainder require cessation of oral anticoagulation and alternative thromboprophylaxis preoperatively, which can be achieved on an outpatient basis using low molecular weight heparin. Outpatient anticoagulation management requires a clear protocol that is understood and agreed to by all parties involved in the care of surgical patients perioperatively."

CD008201,0,21243449,0,Approach to venous thromboembolism in the cancer patient.,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is frequently encountered in cancer patients, acts as an important cause of morbidity and mortality, and may be a predictor of worse prognosis. In cancer patient who have a poor life expectancy, preventing death from pulmonary embolism is the mainstay of treatment. Patients who present with severe hypotension or other clinical manifestations suggestive of critical pulmonary embolism and do not have contraindications to thrombolysis should promptly be administered thrombolytic drugs. Except for selected cases requiring aggressive therapy, treatment of VTE in patients with cancer should not differ from that of patients without malignancy; the initial treatment should be conducted with adjusted dose of unfractionated heparin (UH), fixed dose of low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWH), or fondaparinux. LMWHs and fondaparinux have the potential to greatly simplify the initial treatment of VTE, making the management of the pathology feasible in an outpatient setting for selected patients. Traditionally, in cancer as well as in non-cancer patients, UH or LMWH or fondaparinux are overlapped by oral anticoagulation, targeted to reach an International Normalized Ratio (INR) between 2.0 and 3.0, and then followed by oral anticoagulants. However, during oral anticoagulant therapy, cancer patients exhibit a two- to fourfold higher risk of recurrent VTE and major bleeding complications when compared to non-cancer patients. Studies performed during the current decade have demonstrated that LMWHs offer several advantages in terms of efficacy in preventing VTE recurrences without increasing the bleeding risk. According to International Guidelines, the long-term administration of LMWH should be considered an alternative to anti-vitamin K drugs in patients with advanced disease and in those with conditions limiting the use of oral anticoagulants. The targeted policy is to administer LMWH at full therapeutic doses for the first month of treatment and then 75% of the initial dose for at least the following 5 months of therapy. Prolongation of anticoagulation should be considered for as long as the malignant disorder is active. In patients with acute deep venous thrombosis and contraindications to anticoagulation, vena cava filters should be considered. If anticoagulation is temporarily contraindicated, retrievable filters should be considered. Only patients who are actively bleeding or who are at extremely high risk for bleeding should receive a filter without anticoagulation coverage."

CD008201,0,21950269,0,Recommendations for the prevention of pregnancy-associated venous thromboembolism.,"Pregnancy is a risk factor for venous thromboembolism (VTE), an important cause of maternal morbidity and mortality. Although there is a 4-5-fold increased risk compared to that of nonpregnant women of the same age, the absolute risk is low at no more than two episodes of VTE per 1000 pregnancies. There is uncertainty about which women require thromboprophylaxis during pregnancy or postpartum because of a lack of data from appropriate clinical trials. For this reason, recommendations for prophylaxis should be made only after explaining the available evidence to the patient and taking into account her perception of the balance of risk and benefit in thromboprophylaxis. The aim of these recommendations is to provide clinicians with practical advice to assist in decisions regarding thromboprophylaxis in women considered to be at risk of VTE during pregnancy and the postpartum. The authors are clinicians from across New Zealand and Australia representing the fields of haematology, obstetric medicine, anaesthesiology, maternal-fetal medicine and obstetrics. Authors were invited to review the relevant literature and then worked collaboratively to devise recommendations and resolve areas of controversy. The recommendations contained herein were reached by consensus and represent the opinion of the panel. The absence of randomised clinical trials in this area limits the strength of evidence that can be used, and it is acknowledged that they represent level C evidence. The panel advocates for appropriate clinical studies to be carried out in this patient population to address the inadequacy of present evidence."

Risk factors for spinal hematoma during neuraxial anesthesia are anatomic abnormalities, impaired hemostasis and difficult needle placement. Japanese guideline for prevention of venous thromboembolism recommends low-dose unfractionated heparin (LDUH) to patients with moderate and high risk in perioperative period. LDUH is not contraindication for neuraxial anesthesia in this guideline. In order to reduce the risk of spinal hematoma in patients receiving heparin, it is recommended that the needle placement and catheter removal should be done when the anticoagulant effect of heparin is at the minimum. Postoperative evaluation of the neurological status is also important for early detection of a spinal hematoma."

CD008201,0,22781382,0,[Coronary stenting and surgery: perioperative management of antiplatelet therapy in patients undergoing surgery after coronary stent implantation].,"The management of antiplatelet therapy in patients with coronary stents undergoing surgery is a growing clinical problem and often represents a matter of debate between cardiologists and surgeons. It has been estimated that about 4-8% of patients undergoing coronary stenting need to undergo surgery within the next year. Surgery represents one of the most common reasons for premature antiplatelet therapy discontinuation, which is associated with a significant increase in mortality and major adverse cardiac events, in particular stent thrombosis. In addition, surgery confers an additional risk of perioperative cardiac ischemic events, being high in these patients because of the pro-inflammatory and pro-thrombotic effects of surgery. Current international guidelines recommend to postpone non-urgent surgery for at least 6 weeks after bare metal stent implantation and for 6-12 months after drug-eluting stent implantation. However, these recommendations provide little support with regard to managing antiplatelet therapy in the perioperative phase in case of urgent operations and/or high hemorrhagic risk. Furthermore, ischemic and hemorrhagic risk is not defined in detail on the basis of clinical and procedural characteristics. Finally, guidelines shared with cardiologists and surgeons are lacking. The present consensus document provides practical recommendations on the management of antiplatelet therapy in the perioperative period in patients with coronary stents undergoing surgery. Cardiologists and surgeons contributed equally to its creation. An ischemic risk stratification has been provided on the basis of clinical and procedural data. All surgical interventions have been defined on the basis of the hemorrhagic risk. A consensus on the most appropriate antiplatelet regimen in the perioperative phase has been reached on the basis of the ischemic and hemorrhagic risk. Dual antiplatelet therapy should not be withdrawn for surgery at low bleeding risk, whereas aspirin should be continued perioperatively in the majority of surgical operations. In the event of interventions at high risk for both bleeding and ischemic events, when oral antiplatelet therapy withdrawal is required, perioperative treatment with short-acting intravenous glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors (tirofiban or eptifibatide) should be considered."

CD008201,0,20686822,0,Venous thromboembolism (VTE) in hospitalized cancer patients: prophylaxis failure or failure to prophylax!,"Cancer patients are at higher risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE). Anticoagulants, when used for prophylaxis, had successfully reduced the incidence of VTE in high risk patients. Nevertheless, many registry studies have shown low compliance rate with published prophylaxis guidelines. From January 2004 through June 2008, hospital database was searched for all discharge diagnoses of cancer with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and/or pulmonary embolism (PE). Prophylaxis rate for the whole group and for subgroups in relation to recent hospitalization, duration of cancer diagnosis and number of other coexisting risk factors were studied. Two hundred patients were identified; majority (91.8%) had advanced-stage cancer at time of VTE diagnosis. In addition to cancer, many patients had multiple coexisting risk factors for VTE with 137 (68.5%) patients had at least three while 71 (35.5%) had four or more. Overall, 111(55.5%) patients developed lower-extremity DVT while 52 (26%) patients developed PE, other sites accounted for 18%. Majority of the patients (72%) had VTE diagnosed within the first 12 months following cancer diagnosis. Almost three quarters of the patients (73.5%) had not received any antecedent prophylaxis. Prophylaxis rate was 23% among patients with ≥ 3 risk factors and 50% among the highest risk group with ≥ 5 risk factors. Based on our findings, majority of VTE in cancer patients occurred due to failure to offer prophylaxis, minority were due to prophylaxis failure. Meticulous quality improvement programs should be established to emphasize the importance of implementing more intensive prophylaxis among high-risk cancer patients."

CD008201,0,16849000,0,Prophylaxis against venous thromboembolism in orthopedic surgery.,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE), which is manifested as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), represents a significant cause of death, disability, and discomfort. They are frequent complications of various surgical procedures. The aging population and the survival of more severely injured patients may suggest an increasing risk of thromboembolism in the trauma patients. Expanded understanding of the population at risk challenges physicians to carefully examine risk factors for VTE to identify high-risk patients who can benefit from prophylaxis. An accurate knowledge of evidence-based risk factors is important in predicting and preventing postoperative DVT, and can be incorporated into a decision support system for appropriate thromboprophylaxis use. Standard use of DVT prophylaxis in a high-risk trauma population leads to a low incidence of DVT. The incidence of VTE is common in Asia. The evaluation includes laboratory tests, Doppler test and phlebography. Screening Doppler sonography should be performed for surveillance on all critically injured patients to identify DVT. D-Dimer is a useful marker to monitor prophylaxis in trauma surgery patients. The optimal time to start prophylaxis is between 2 hours before and 10 hours after surgery, but the risk of PE continues for several weeks. Thromboprophylaxis includes graduated compression stockings and anticoagulants for prophylaxis. Anticoagulants include Warfarin, which belongs to Vitamin K antagonists, unfractionated heparin, low molecular weight heparins, factor Xa indirect inhibitor Fondaparinux, and the oral IIa inhibitor Melagatran and ximelagatran. Recombinant human soluble thrombomodulin is a new and highly effective antithrombotic agent. Prophylactic placement of vena caval filters in selected trauma patients may decrease the incidence of PE. The indications for prophylactic inferior vena cava filter insertion include prolonged immobilization with multiple injuries, closed head injury, pelvic fracture, spine fracture, multiple long bone fracture, and attending discretion. Multiple-trauma patients are at increased risk for DVT but are also at increased risk of bleeding, and the use of heparin may be contraindicated. Serial compression devices (SCDs) are an alternative for DVT prophylaxis. Compression devices provide adequate DVT prophylaxis with a low failure rate and no device-related complications. Immobilization is one of important reasons of VTE. The ambulant patient is far less likely to develop complications of inactivity, not only venous thrombosis, but also contractures, decubitus ulcers, or osteoporosis (with its associated fatigue fractures), as well as bowel or bladder complications."

Unfractionated heparin three times a day versus enoxaparin in the prevention of deep vein thrombosis in trauma patients.,"Venous thromboembolic disease is a significant source of morbidity and mortality in hospitalized trauma patients. Multiple drugs and dosing regimens have been suggested for pharmacoprophylaxis. In this study, we compared efficacy, complications, and cost of unfractionated heparin administered subcutaneously three times a day with standard-dosed enoxaparin for prophylaxis of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in adult trauma patients over 1 year. Patients admitted for greater than 72 hours who received pharmacoprophylaxis as part of a comprehensive DVT protocol were included. A change was made in the protocol from enoxaparin (30 mg twice a day or 40 mg per day) to heparin (5000 U three times a day) at midyear. Surveillance lower extremity venous ultrasound was performed according to established institutional guidelines. Data, including demographics, associated injuries, complications, and cost, were collected and analyzed. Four hundred seventy-six patients met inclusion criteria. Two hundred thirty-seven (49.8%) patients received enoxaparin and 239 (50.2%) received heparin. Proximal lower extremity DVTs were detected in 16 (6.75%) patients in the enoxaparin group and 17 (7.11%) in the heparin group (P = 0.999). Risk factors for DVT in these patients included spinal cord injury (P = 0.001) and closed head injury (P = 0.031). There was no difference between the incidence of pulmonary emboli and bleeding. There was an estimated yearly pharmacy cost savings of $135,606. In trauma patients, subcutaneous heparin dosed three times a day may be as effective as standard-dosed enoxaparin for prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism without increased complications. Heparin three times a day for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis was associated with significant pharmaceutical cost savings."

The ETHOS registry evaluated post-operative VTE prophylaxis prescribed, and actual VTE prophylaxis received, compared with the 2004 American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) guidelines in HROS patients. We performed a subanalysis of ETHOS to assess patient compliance with ACCP-adherent prophylaxis after discharge and the factors predicting poor compliance. Consecutive patients undergoing hip fracture surgery, total hip arthroplasty, or knee arthroplasty were enrolled at discharge from 161 centres in 17 European countries if they had received adequate in-hospital VTE prophylaxis. Data on prescribed and actual prophylaxis received were obtained from hospital charts and patient post-discharge diaries. Good compliance was defined as percentage treatment intake ≥80% with no more than two consecutive days without treatment. A total of 3,484 patients (79.4%) received ACCP-adherent anticoagulant prescription at discharge and 2,999 (86.0%) had an evaluable patient diary. In total, 87.7% of evaluable patients were compliant with prescribed treatment after discharge. The most common reason for non-compliance (33.4%) was ""drug was not bought"". Injection of treatment was not a barrier to good compliance. Main factors affecting compliance related to purchase of and access to treatment, patient education, the person responsible for administering injections, country, and type of hospital ward at discharge. Within our study population, patient compliance with ACCP-adherent thromboprophylaxis prescribed at discharge was good. Improvements in patient education and prescribing practices at discharge may be important in further raising compliance levels in high-risk orthopaedic surgery patients."

This incorporates the use of intravenous tranexamic acid (IVTA; 15 mg/kg) at the induction of anaesthesia. Recently there was a national shortage of IVTA for 18 weeks; during this period all patients received an oral preparation of tranexamic acid (OTA; 25 mg/kg). This retrospective study compares the safety (surgical and medical complications) and efficacy (reduction of transfusion requirements) of OTA and IVTA. During the study period a total of 2698 patients received IVTA and 302 received OTA. After adjusting for a range of patient and surgical factors, the odds ratio (OR) of receiving a blood transfusion was significantly higher with IVTA than with OTA (OR 0.48 (95% confidence interval 0.26 to 0.89), p = 0.019), whereas the safety profile was similar, based on length of stay, rate of readmission, return to theatre, deep infection, stroke, gastrointestinal bleeding, myocardial infarction, pneumonia, deep-vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. The financial benefit of OTA is £2.04 for a 70 kg patient; this is amplified when the cost saving associated with significantly fewer blood transfusions is considered. Although the number of patients in the study is modest, this work supports the use of OTA, and we recommend that a randomised trial be undertaken to compare the different methods of administering tranexamic acid."

It can be also associated to disabling chronic conditions. In spite of this, prophylaxis in healthcare assistance is still underused. In this article, the available evidence in thromboprophylaxis was analyzed to offer recommendations (1) or suggestions (2) classified according to different levels of evidence (A, B or C). Different medical scenarios and types of thromboprophylaxis were analyzed. In major orthopedic surgeries low molecular weight heparins, LMWH, inhibitors of the Xa and IIa factors are recommended (1B) to be started during hospitalization and continued for 35 days in hip replacement surgery and for 10 days in total knee replacement surgery. Knee arthroscopy and spine surgery do not require pharmacologic treatment (2B) unless the patient has other risks factors for thrombosis. In such cases, LMWH are recommended. Non-surgical patients who have at least one risk factor should receive LMWH, NFH or fondaparinux (1B) if they are to be bedridden or unable to walk for three or more days. Patients undergoing neurosurgery or with intracranial hemorrhage should receive mechanic prophylaxis (2C), and accordingly they should start LMWH or NFH 24 to 72 hours afterwards (2C). The latter two drugs are recommended for critically ill patients. Patients with low risk for VTD undergoing other type of surgeries should be prescribed with mechanical prophylaxis (2C) and encouraged to walk promptly (2C), while those with high risk should be prescribed with LMWH or NFH (1B or 2C according to bleeding risk factors)."

CD008201,0,16231170,0,[Anticoagulation for secondary prevention: which drug in which situation?].,"Thromboembolic events are a major complication of cardiovascular diseases. Secondary prevention of thromboembolic complications can be achieved by anticoagulation with heparin or vitamin-K-antagonists. A new class of direct thrombin inhibitors has been recently introduced into clinical medicine. Clinical studies have demonstrated theses agents to be comparable in efficacy for prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism. However, the results of ongoing trials are awaited in helping to define the place of direct thrombin inhibitors in secondary prevention. Antiplatelet therapy constitutes the cornerstone in the management of patients with acute coronary syndromes and generally high-risk patients with atherothrombosis. Until recently, long-term antiplatelet therapy for the treatment and prevention of atherothrombotic disease was traditionally limited to aspirin. The availability of the thienopyridines and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors represents an important addition to the physician's armamentarium. Due to the increased risk of major bleeding, for each patient the decision of anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy must be tightly correlated to the individual benefit-risk ratio."

TG is a major sequel of chronic active antibody-mediated rejection (cABMR), from pre-existing or de novo anti-HLA antibodies. Hepatitis C infection, thrombotic microangiopathy or other factors may also contribute to TG development. TG prevalence is 5-20% in most series, reaching 55%, in some high-risk cohorts, and is associated with worse allograft outcomes. Despite its prevalence and clinical significance, few well-studied treatment options have been proposed. Similar to desensitization protocols, plasmapheresis with or without immunoabsorption, high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin, rituximab, bortezomib and eculizumab have been proposed in the treatment of TG due to cABMR individually or in various combinations.

CD008201,0,7473949,0,Asymptomatic deep venous thrombosis in the trauma patient: is an aggressive screening protocol justified?,"The incidence and sequelae of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in trauma patients are unclear because the majority of patients who develop DVT are asymptomatic. This study evaluated the incidence, risk factors, and efficacy of prophylaxis for DVT in trauma patients over a 5-year period. Trauma patients at high risk for DVT were evaluated biweekly with lower extremity venous duplex scans. The DVT prophylaxis was instituted on admission with low-dose heparin therapy and pneumatic compression. The incidence of asymptomatic DVT identified by duplex screening was 10% (45 of 458); one pulmonary embolus occurred. Five variables were significant from bivariate and multiple logistic regression analysis: age (p = 0.005), Injury Severity Score (p = 0.005), length of stay (p = 0.004), Trauma and Injury Severity Score (p = 0.01), and spinal injury (p = 0.014). This analysis documents that trauma patients with these risk factors are at increased risk for the development of asymptomatic DVT, despite prophylaxis, and warrant surveillance with venous duplex sonography."

CD008201,0,16563815,0,Thrombotic complications in essential thrombocythemia (ET): clinical facts and biochemical riddles.,"Hemostatic complications which can occur in the arterial or venous vasculature or in the microcirculation are the major causes of morbidity and mortality in patients with ET. In order to prevent these complications, often platelet reductive drugs are used. These agents are by themselves potentially toxic, i.e. may cause leukemia or cardiac side effects. In order to avoid these adverse effects, a better understanding of the mechanism of thrombus formation which is causative in ET is mandatory. Unfortunately, until now, no biomarkers have been identified which allow the estimation of the risk of thrombotic complications. Platelet number is not a good predictor per se since thrombotic complications can occur in some patients at low platelet numbers whereas others do not encounter a thrombosis even at very high platelet levels. On the other hand, lowering of the platelet count usually results in symptomatic improvement. In ET, morphological alterations of the megakaryocyte in the bone marrow and the circulating platelets are observed: megakaryocyte nuclei show a staghorn appearance, circulating platelets are characterized by anisocytosis and giant size. Functional studies indicate that these anatomically altered platelets function abnormally. When platelets are analyzed with a platelet function analyzer (PFA-100, which uses cartridges that measure how well a patient's platelets adhere and aggregate to form a platelet plug in the first phase of thrombus formation), in many patients with ET, closure time using collagen/ADP and collagen/epinephrine cartridges is prolonged. This seems paradoxical since these patients do not show an increased bleeding time. These results indicate that either receptors and/or consecutive signaling events are abnormal in ET platelets. Proteomic analysis of platelets of ET patients has revealed individual differences but not yet led to the identification of disease-specific proteins. Moreover, the search for alternative risk factors (factor V Leiden, prothrombin gene polymorphism, etc.) has not provided evidence for the contribution of these factors to the generation of the thrombotic risk in ET patients. In summary, despite intensive research over several decades, relatively little is known about the pathogenesis and risk factors for thrombosis in ET. I expect that this conference will contribute to the development of new strategies to identify patients at risk for hemostatic complications."
CD008201,0,20007990,0,Maternal haemorrhage.,"Maternal haemorrhage is the leading cause of preventable maternal death worldwide and encompasses antepartum, intrapartum, and postpartum bleeding. This review highlights factors that predispose to severe bleeding, its management, and the most recent treatment and guidelines. Advances in obstetric care have provided physicians with the diagnostic tools to detect, anticipate, and prevent severe life-threatening maternal haemorrhage in most patients who have had prenatal care. In an optimal setting, patients at high risk for haemorrhage are referred to tertiary care centres where multidisciplinary teams are prepared to care for and deal with known potential complications. However, even with the best prenatal care, unexpected haemorrhage occurs. The first step in management is stabilization of haemodynamic status, which involves securing large bore i.v. access, invasive monitoring, and aggressive fluid management and transfusion therapy. Care for the patient with maternal bleeding should follow an algorithm that goes through a rapid and successive sequence of medical and surgical approaches to stem bleeding and decrease morbidity and mortality. With the addition of potent uterotonic agents and the advent of minimally invasive interventional radiological techniques such as angiographic embolization and arterial ligation, definitive yet conservative management is now possible in an attempt to avoid hysterectomy in patients with severe peripartum bleeding. If these interventions are inadequate to control the bleeding, the decision to proceed to hysterectomy must be made expeditiously. Recombinant factor VIIa is a relatively new treatment that could prove useful for severe coagulopathy and intractable bleeding."
CD008201,0,22652310,0,Review of the off-label use of recombinant activated factor VII in pediatric cardiac surgery patients.,"In recent years the off-label use of recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) has markedly increased, particularly in pediatric cardiac surgery patients, and practitioners differ widely in their usage of the drug. In 2009, the Congenital Cardiac Anesthesia Society (CCAS) assembled a task force to review the literature on rFVIIa administration to pediatric cardiac surgery patients. The goal of the CCAS Task Force was to assess current practices and make recommendations about rFVIIa therapy to enhance quality of care, improve patient outcomes, reduce costs, and develop future research. In this review we summarized the important topics on current administration of rFVIIa to pediatric cardiac surgery patients including indications for use, efficacy, safety, dosing, and monitoring. All pediatric and pertinent adult literature regarding the administration of rFVIIa to cardiac surgical patients and published since 2000 were selected and studied. Of the 40 pediatric publications reviewed for this report, only 1 was a prospective randomized controlled trial thus making determinations of efficacy difficult. There is no substantive evidence to support the efficacy of rFVIIa as prophylactic or routine therapy during pediatric cardiac surgery. It may prove reasonable as rescue therapy because current observational evidence suggests that potential benefits of rFVIIa for this indication might outweigh the risks. Rescue therapy is appropriate for bleeding that is massive, potentially life-threatening, and refractory to conventional therapy. Nevertheless, extreme caution is advised when considering the administration of rFVIIa to patients who are at risk for thromboembolic complications because rates for clinical and subclinical thrombosis secondary to rFVIIa therapy are unknown at this time. This review is designed to aid practitioners in deciding when and how to administer rFVIIa to pediatric cardiac surgery patients; it is not intended to determine standard-of-care or practice guidelines. There are insufficient data to make evidence-based recommendations. Randomized controlled trials are needed to assess the efficacy of rFVIIa as prophylactic, routine, or rescue therapy and to determine the drug's safety profile particularly with regard to thrombosis. The CCAS rFVIIa Task Force will continue to monitor the literature, gather data, and make updates as more information becomes available."
CD008201,0,21044026,0,Early postoperative bleeding in polytrauma patients treated with fondaparinux: literature review and institutional experience.,"Surgery for pelvic or acetabular fractures carries a high risk of deep-vein thrombosis (DVT). Reports indicate that fondaparinux is a more effective thromboprophylactic agent than low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) after major orthopaedic surgery. The safety and efficacy of fondaparinux was evaluated in a new protocol used for DVT prophylaxis. One hundred and twenty seven patients with pelvic or acetabular fractures received either fondaparinux or enoxaparin and were analysed in a historical non-concurrent study. Specific review points included clinical deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) and evidence of adverse effects such as bleeding or allergic reactions. Two patients that received enoxaparin were found to have a DVT and one patient had a PE. There was no documented DVT or PE in patients that received fondaparinux. The mean number of units of blood transfused postoperatively was higher in the enoxaparin group; however, multivariate regression modelling demonstrated no significant difference between the groups. The most current large randomised controlled studies investigating the administration of fondaparinux following joint arthroplasty or hip fracture surgery, have demonstrated a slight increase or a similar number of bleeding events in patients treated with fondaparinux when compared to those treated with enoxaparin. The current report supports that fondaparinux, in patients with pelvic and acetabular fractures, can be equally effective as enoxaparin and not associated with adverse bleeding events."

We evaluated inpatient and postdischarge DVT/PE and thromboprophylaxis rates in US medical patients, using patient admissions from January 2005 to November 2007 in the Premier Perspective™-i3 Pharma Informatics database. Among 15 721 patients with cancer, congestive heart failure, severe lung disease, and infectious disease, 39.0% received inpatient thromboprophylaxis, with the highest rate in patients with cancer (51.9%). In all, 3.4% received outpatient pharmacological prophylaxis. Mean ± SD prophylaxis duration was 2.2 ± 5.7 days. Overall, 3.0% of inpatients had symptomatic DVT/PE, and an additional 1.1% of patients were rehospitalized for DVT/PE or treated in the outpatient setting. Patients with infectious disease had the highest rate of DVT/PE (4.6%). Inpatient DVT/PE and prophylaxis rates of the different medical conditions had a negative correlation (R(2) = 0.72). This analysis demonstrates the burden of DVT/PE and highlights the underuse of thromboprophylaxis across the continuum of care."
CD008201,0,25583683,0,Total joint arthroplasty in cancer patients.,"Increasing numbers of total joint arthroplasty (TJA) patients have a history, or an active diagnosis, of cancer. We aimed to evaluate the risk of early postoperative complications in these patients. In our series, a history of malignancy was associated with an elevated risk of ischemic cardiac events and postoperative deep vein thrombosis (DVT), while active malignancy was associated with increased respiratory and renal complications, hematoma/seroma formation and early postoperative mortality. Both groups presented increased rates of overall in-hospital complications. Patients with bone metastasis to the hip demonstrated increased DVT and 90-day mortality rates. Cancer patients have increased morbidity and mortality after TJA and should undergo comprehensive medical optimization and adapted thromboprophylaxis."
CD008201,0,25120366,0,Clinical and economic studies of eptifibatide in coronary stenting.,"Platelet adhesion and aggregation at the site of coronary stenting can have catastrophic clinical and economic consequences. Therefore, effective platelet inhibition is vital during and after percutaneous coronary intervention. Eptifibatide is an intravenous antiplatelet agent that blocks the final common pathway of platelet aggregation and thrombus formation by binding to glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptors on the surface of platelets. In clinical studies, eptifibatide was associated with a significant reduction of mortality, myocardial infarction, or target vessel revascularization in patients with acute coronary syndrome undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. However, recent trials conducted in the era of dual antiplatelet therapy and newer anticoagulants failed to demonstrate similar results. The previously seen favorable benefit of eptifibatide was mainly offset by the increased risk of bleeding. Current American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines recommend its use as an adjunct in high-risk patients who are undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention with traditional anticoagulants (heparin or enoxaparin), who are not otherwise at high risk of bleeding. In patients receiving bivalirudin (a newer safer anticoagulant), routine use of eptifibatide is discouraged except in select situations (eg, angiographic complications). Although older pharmacoeconomic studies favor eptifibatide, in the current era of P2Y12 inhibitors and newer safer anticoagulants, the increased costs associated with bleeding make the routine use of eptifibatide an economically nonviable option. The cost-effectiveness of eptifibatide with the use of strategies that decrease the bleeding risk (eg, transradial access) is unknown. This review provides an overview of key clinical and economic studies of eptifibatide well into the current era of potent antiplatelet agents, novel safer anticoagulants, and contemporary percutaneous coronary intervention."

CD008201,0,25294587,0,Risk-assessment and pharmacological prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism in hospitalized patients with chronic liver disease.,There is a lack of evidence regarding the need for thromboprophylaxis in hospitalized patients with liver disease. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the Padua Predictor Score (PPS) as a risk-stratification tool for the development of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients with chronic liver disease.
CD008201,0,24599439,0,Thrombosis in brain tumors.,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is common in patients with brain tumors, occurring in up to 30% of patients with high-grade glioma and up to 20% of those with brain metastasis and primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma. The risk is correlated with higher grade malignancies and is directly associated with the production of the potent procoagulant, tissue factor (TF). Upregulation of TF influences both the coagulation pathway and oncogenic signaling mechanisms important for cancer progression. The risk of intracranial hemorrhage with the use of anticoagulants complicates the management of VTE in patients with brain tumor. We discuss the recommended anticoagulants used for initial and long-term treatment of established VTE, including unfractionated heparin, low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), and warfarin. Therapeutic anticoagulation, particularly LMWH followed by secondary prophylaxis, is generally safe and effective in the treatment of VTE, including patients on antiangiogenic agents. Anticoagulation also reduces the risk of VTE during the perioperative period. However, despite the high risk of VTE throughout the course of disease, present data do not support routine thromboprophylaxis in brain tumor patients. Further investigation regarding the mechanisms underlying the hypercoagulable state of patients with brain tumors and the potential role of the factors and products of thrombogenesis as biomarkers for risk stratification will be useful in identification and management of patients at risk of developing VTE. Novel oral anticoagulants that directly inhibit thrombin such as dabigatran or factor Xa, including rivaroxaban and apixaban have several potential advantages; however, due to limited data in the cancer population, the use of these newer oral anticoagulants is not currently recommended for patients with malignancy and VTE. Recent studies have explored the role of anticoagulants as anticancer agents, which may contribute to cancer treatment in the future."

CD008201,0,19356947,0,The perioperative management of patients with gynaecological cancer undergoing major surgery: A debated clinical challenge.,"Major extensive surgery still represents a cornstone of therapy of gynaecological cancer, and the adoption of implemented clinical guidelines for perioperative management can significantly decrease patient morbidity and mortality and reduce hospital stay. The overall risk of deep venous thrombosis in patients undergoing gynaecological surgery ranges from 7% to 45%, and fatal pulmonary embolism occurs in approximately 1% of these women. A meta-analyses of randomised trials showed a significant decrease in deep venous thrombosis in women receiving unfractioned heparin [UFH] compared with controls, and revealed no significant difference in deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism between patients who received UFH and those who received low-molecular weight heparin [LMWH]. Potential advantages favouring LMWH over UFH include once-daily versus repeated daily injections and a lower risk of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. All patients undergoing major surgical operations should receive LMWH that should be started preoperatively and then given for 7-10 days at least and prolonged for up to 4 weeks in high-risk cases. Antithrombotic mechanical methods can be added to pharmacological agents, but should not been used alone. Cephalosporins and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid have been widely used in gynaecological surgery prophylaxis. Both amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and cefazolin have good in vitro activity against the microbes more frequently involved in postoperative infections, such as Gram-negative bacilli, but amoxicillin-clavulanic acid is more effective against anaerobes. A single dose of antibiotics has been shown to be as effective as multiple doses in many trials that have compared a single-dose regimen with a multiple-dose regimen. Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid prophylaxis at the induction of anaesthesia can be suggested for gynaecological cancer patients undergoing major gynaecological surgery with or without colorectal resection. An additional antibiotic dose is recommended for prolonged operations or when intraoperative blood loss is important. Cephalosporins can be administered to women with a history of penicillin allergy not manifested by an immediate hypersensitivity reaction, whereas tigecyclin should be reserved to patients with a prior anaphylactic reaction to beta-lactams. Recent meta-analyses of randomised trials on patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery found more anastomotic leakages in patients who had preoperative mechanical bowel preparation with oral administration of different solutions than in those who had not, whereas there were no significant differences between the two arms as for wound infections, other septic complications, and non-septic complications. Therefore, preoperative mechanical bowel cleansing is not warranted for gynaecological cancer patients scheduled for surgery that may involve colon-rectum. After major abdominal gynaecological surgery, early oral feeding (within the first 24h regardless of the resolution of postoperative ileus) appears to be associated with increased nausea, shorter time to the presence of bowel sound, shorter time to first solid diet, and a trend toward shorter hospital stay when compared with delayed feeding. Since early oral feeding is safe but associated with increased nausea, the decision whether to adopt this postoperative regimen should be individualised. Decision making processes about thromboprophylaxis, antibiotic prophylaxis, bowel preparation for surgery that may involve colon-rectum, and timing of postoperative oral feeding will become more and more relevant for improved safety and quality of life of women with gynaecological cancer."

CD008201,0,21333476,0,[Thrombosis and assisted reproductive techniques (ART)].,"Assisted reproductive techniques (ART) concern procedures designed to increase fertility of couples: artificial insemination, in vitro fertilization (IVF), either classical or after intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), transfer of frozen embryos, or gamete intrafallopian transfer. Their use has greatly increased these last years. They may be associated with severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome and one possible major complication is venous or arterial thrombosis. Thromboses are rare but potentially serious with important sequellae. They are mostly observed in unusual sites such as head and neck vessels and the mechanism is still unknown although hypotheses have been proposed. This review is an update of our knowledge and an attempt to consider guidelines for the prevention and treatment of ART-associated thromboses, which frequently occur when the woman is pregnant. Prevention of severe ovarian hyperstimulation by appropriate stimulation procedures, detection of women at risk of hyperstimulation and of women at high risk of thrombosis should allow reduction of the risk of thrombosis, possibly by administration of a thromboprophylaxis at a timing and dose which can be only determined by extrapolation."
CD008201,0,17615800,0,Thromboprophylaxis with dalteparin in medical patients: which patients benefit?,"It is unclear whether thromboprophylaxis produces a consistent risk reduction in different subgroups of medical patients at risk from venous thromboembolism. We performed a retrospective, post hoc analysis of 3706 patients enrolled in the PREVENT study. Patients were at least 40 years old with an acute medical condition requiring hospitalization for at least 4 days and had no more than 3 days of immobilization prior to enrolment. Patients received either subcutaneous dalteparin (5000 IU) or placebo once daily. The primary end point was the composite of symptomatic deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism, asymptomatic proximal DVT, or sudden death. Primary diagnosis subgroups were acute congestive heart failure, acute respiratory failure, infectious disease, rheumatological disorders, or inflammatory bowel disease. All patients, except those with congestive heart or respiratory failure, had at least one additional risk factor for venous thromboembolism. A risk reduction was shown in patients receiving dalteparin versus placebo. The relative risk (RR) was 0.73 in patients with congestive heart failure, 0.72 for respiratory failure, 0.46 for infectious disease, and 0.97 for rheumatological disorders. The RR was 0.52 in patients aged > or = 75 years, 0.64 in obese patients, 0.34 for patients with varicose veins, and 0.71 in patients with chronic heart failure. No subgroup had a significantly different response from any other. Importantly, multivariate analysis showed that all patient groups benefited from thromboprophylaxis with dalteparin. Our findings, therefore, support the broad application of thromboprophylaxis in acutely ill hospitalized medical patients."
CD008201,0,22633209,0,[Management of direct action oral anticoagulants in the peri-operative period and invasive techniques].,"The new direct-acting oral anticoagulants (ACOD) in patients on prolonged treatment require the need to balance the risk of haemorrhage by administering them against the risk of thrombosis on withdrawing them. Recommendations for their management are proposed in the present article: A) Thromboprophylaxis and general anaesthesia: the performing of regional anaesthesia if administered with an ACOD as thromboprophylaxis requires some safety intervals based on their pharmacokinetic parameters; B) Management of ACOD in elective surgery: in patients with normal renal function and a low haemorrhage/thrombosis risk, stop the ACOD two days before the surgery; it the haemorrhage/thrombosis risk is high and/or renal function is impaired, therapy with a low molecular weight heparin is proposed from 5 days prior to the surgery, and C) Management of ACOD in urgent surgery and associated haemorrhage: the systematic prophylactic administration of haemostatics is recommended. In the event of acute bleeding that may place the life of the patient at risk (due to volume or location), the administration of concentrated prothrombin complex, fresh plasma, or factor VIIa, must be assessed, together with general control measures of acute haemorrhage. These recommendations should be considered in the context of the use drugs that do have a specific antidote, where their monitoring by the usual coagulation tests is not routine, and with those in which there is limited experience. We believe they need to be reviewed in the future, depending on further studies and clinical experience obtained."
CD008201,0,18794394,0,Cerebrovascular thromboprophylaxis in mice by erythrocyte-coupled tissue-type plasminogen activator.,"Cerebrovascular thrombosis is a major source of morbidity and mortality after surgery, but thromboprophylaxis in this setting is limited because of the formidable risk of perioperative bleeding. Thrombolytics (eg, tissue-type plasminogen activator [tPA]) cannot be used prophylactically in this high-risk setting because of their short duration of action and risk of causing hemorrhage and central nervous system damage. We found that coupling tPA to carrier red blood cells (RBCs) prolongs and localizes tPA activity within the bloodstream and converts it into a thromboprophylactic agent, RBC/tPA. To evaluate the utility of this new approach for preventing cerebrovascular thrombosis, we examined the effect of RBC/tPA in animal models of cerebrovascular thromboembolism and ischemia."
CD008201,0,16884132,0,The use of retrievable inferior vena cava filters in trauma: implications for the trauma team.,"Prevention of venothromboembolic complications remains a challenge in trauma care. Guidelines for prophylaxis published by the Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma stratify patients by risk and recommend therapies based on scientific evidence. New innovations such as retrievable inferior vena cava filters are being used by trauma surgeons for patients at risk for pulmonary embolism but in whom anticoagulation is contraindicated. Some available devices offer a limited timeframe for retrieval beyond which the device becomes permanent. The increased utilization of this technology presents case management challenges to trauma teams. Patients who are unreliable or may be difficult to track posthospitalization (homeless, migrant workers, prison system, etc.) run the risk of not having their filters removed as initially intended. Nurses can play a critical role in helping to manage and direct the discharge plan and case management of trauma patients with retrievable inferior vena cava filters."
CD008201,0,15770559,0,[Thrombosis prophylaxis with heparins in intensive care patients].,"Venous thromboembolism is a common complication in critically ill patients, resulting in high morbidity and mortality. Most patients treated in intensive care units (ICU) face a high risk of thromboembolic complications. There is a need for well-defined strategies for prevention of thrombosis in ICU patients. Mechanical methods such as compression stockings are frequently used, even though evidence for these measures in ICU patients is limited. Unfractionated heparin (UFH) is still the leading drug for thromboprophylaxis in ICU patients, but pharmacokinetic disadvantages such as low predictability of effect on anticoagulation are relevant, especially in ICU patients. Additionally, there is no sufficient evidence from clinical trials to support subcutaneous or intravenous prophylaxis with UFH. At least equivalent efficacy and safety of subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) compared with subcutaneous UFH have been shown in numerous studies investigating non-ICU high-risk groups. First studies on the use of LMWH in critically ill patients are promising. Some conclusions for safe use of subcutaneous LMWH in ICU patients can be drawn. Intravenous LMWH may be the optimal prophylaxis in most ICU patients, but there is a lack of sufficient data on dosing. Precautions such as monitoring of anticoagulation in patients with renal insufficiency are fundamental if LMWH is given. Further investigations into prevention of venous thromboembolism in ICU patients are urgently needed."
CD008201,0,26734300,0,A simple measure to improve the rates of thromboprophylaxis prescription post surgical fixation of neck of femur fractures in a district general hospital.,"Neck of femur (NOF) fractures are a major public health concern because of the ageing population and higher incidence of fragility fractures. NOF fractures are associated with high mortality and morbidity rates, and there is a high risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) after hip fractures (Ref 1). Therefore thromboprophylaxis is vital. Current NICE guidelines advocate 28 - 35 days of thromboprophylaxis after NOF fractures (Ref 1, 2). It came to our attention that patients post NOF fixation were getting variable prescriptions in regards to their thromboprophylaxis. Therefore a retrospective study on prescription of thromboprophylaxis was conducted from October 2012 to February 2013 within the trauma and orthopaedics department at Queens Hospital, Romford. Data was collected on all NOF fractures from electronic discharge summaries. Basic descriptive statistics were used to analysis the data. There were 110 cases of NOF fractures during this period. 100 patients were included since two were discounted as they were already on long term anticoagulants and eight patients died in hospital. No thromboprophylaxis was prescribed for 15 patients (15%). Three patients (3%) were prescribed less than 28 days (mean 14 days, range (14 - 14 days)). 69 patients (69%) received 28 - 35 days of thromprophylaxis, whilst five patients (5%) received more than 35 days (mean 42 days, range 40 - 42 days). Formal departmental teaching and presentation of the findings was given after the initial study and a small label with the message, 'POST NOF #: 28-35 days Enoxaparin', was attached to the back of all the junior doctor work phones. After the intervention, data was collected from the period of 7th of January to 7th of February 2013. The second study showed that 50 patients were admitted with NOF fractures in this time period. Four patients died in hospital and three patients were discounted as they were on Warfarin. Two patients were not prescribed thromboprophylaxis (5%). 34 (79%) patients received 28 - 35 days, whereas seven patients (16%) received 42 days of thromboprophylaxis. The older patients with multiple co-morbidities and reduced mobility are at high risk of developing thromboembolism post NOF fixation. Our initial study identified inadequate prescription of thromboprophylaxis post NOF fractures. After introduction of simple measures such as the reminder label attached to phones, our repeat study found that there was improvement in prescription rates. Our study highlights that simple measures can increase awareness and improve patient safety."

Long-term follow-up and recommendations.,"Eighty patients underwent isolated mitral valve replacement with the Kay-Shiley prosthesis during a 6 year period (September, 1966, in October, 1972) at Walter Reed Army Medical Center. One-hundred percent follow-up has been achieved with this group. Sixty-four percent of this group have experienced one or more thromboembolic episodes (TEEs), for a TEE rate of 28.7 episodes per 1,000 patient months at risk. The 5 year survival rate is 45%. Eleven of 43 (25%) late deaths resulted from TEEs, and 13 of 43 (30%) late deaths were secondary in the hemorrhagic complications of long-term anticoagulant therapy. The dismal TEE rate prompted as to initiate a policy of elective replacement of all Kay-Shiley mitral prostheses. Eighteen of the 26 survivors underwent replacement of the Kay-Shiley mitral prosthesis. The other eight patients either declined reoperation or were not considered suitable candidates. The reoperative mortality rate was 22% (4/18). Fifteen of 18 explained prostheses revealed a yellow disclored, grooved occluder disc with loosely adherent clot. We recommend elective replacement of Kay-Shiley mitral prostheses in all patients in whom the risk of operation is reasonable."
CD008201,0,21982188,0,[The venous thromboembolic disease].,"Venous thromboembolic disease (VTD) is a frequent medical problem. The VTD includes deep vein thrombosis (DVT), the posthrombotic syndrome (PTS) and pulmonary embolism (PE). The generation of a thrombus in the venous system, is caused by several abnormalities that induce the loss of the most important characteristic of the blood, the liquid state. DVT is due to the formation of a thrombus. Main causes for thrombus formation are thrombophilias which may be classified as primary and secondary. All thrombophilias may affect the homeostasis favoring a hypercoagulable state. In the XIX Century, Virchow classified all the causes of hypercoagulable states as follows: due to stasis of the venous blood flow, due to damage of the endothelium an a hypercoagulable clinical condition. Several risk factors for VTD has been described, during the hospitalization to both, medical and surgical conditions. Among the last, orthopedic and vascular surgery of the legs. Although nearly 50 % of DVTs are asymptomatic and 3 % of the patients with VTD develop PE and 30 % of them die. Thromboprophylaxis is the main strategy to prevent and to diminish the incidence of DVT and its complications. Thromboprophylaxis is useful to improve the quality of life of the patients at risk and it is an effective economical strategy for health care institutions."
CD008201,0,26638268,0,Death Associated with Inadequate Reassessment of Venous Thromboembolism Prophylaxis at and after Hospital Discharge.,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis, also known as thromboprophylaxis, reduces the risk of deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and associated complications, including death, in high-risk patients. VTE prophylaxis is recommended for acutely ill, hospitalized medical patients at risk of thrombosis. Anticoagulants, the pharmacologic agents of choice to prevent VTE, are considered high-alert medications. By definition, therefore, anticoagulants bear a hightened risk of causing significant patient harm when they are used in error. As part of ongoing collaboration with a provincial death investigation service, ISMP Canada received a report of a fatal incident that involved continuation of VTE prophylaxis with enoxaparin for a patient discharge to a long-term care (LTC) facility from an acute care setting. The findings and recommendations from this case are charged to highlight the need to build routine reassessment of VTE prophylaxis into the process for discharging patients from the acute care setting and upon transfer to another facility or to primary care."
CD008201,0,23222928,0,Asian venous thromboembolism guidelines: prevention of venous thromboembolism.,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis is under-utilized in Asia because of the misconception that its incidence is lower in Asians as compared to the Caucasians. The available data on VTE in Asia is limited due to the lack of well-designed multicenter randomized controlled trials as well as non-standardized research designs, making data comparison difficult. Emerging data indicates that the VTE incidence is not low in Asia, and is comparable to that reported in the Western literature in some instances. There is also a trend towards increasing incidence of VTE, as demonstrated by a number of hospital-based studies in Asia. This could be attributed to lifestyle changes, ageing population, increasing awareness of VTE and wider availability of Duplex ultrasound. The risk of VTE in hospitalized patients remain the same in Asians and Caucasians, even though there may be factors that are inherent to patients in Asia that influence the slight variation in incidence. The utilization rate of VTE prophylaxis remains suboptimal in Asia. The Asian Venous Thrombosis Forum (AVTF) comprises participants from various countries such as China, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and experts from Australia and Europe. The forum evaluated the available data on VTE from the Asian region and formulated guidelines tailored to meet the needs of the region. We recommend that serious considerations are given to VTE prophylaxis especially in the at-risk group and a formal hospital policy be established to facilitate the implementation. On admission to the hospital, we recommend assessing the patients for both VTE and bleeding risk. We recommend mechanical prophylaxis for patients at increased risk of bleeding and utilizing it as an adjunctive measure in combination with pharmacological prophylaxis in patients with high risk of VTE. For patients undergoing general or gynecological surgery and with moderate risk for VTE, we recommend prophylaxis with one of the following: low dose unfractionated heparin (LDUH), low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), fondaparinux or intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC). For the same group of patients at high risk of VTE, we recommend pharmacological or combination of pharmacological and mechanical prophylaxis. For patients undergoing major orthopedic surgeries like total hip replacement, total knee replacement and proximal hip fracture surgery, we recommend using one of the following: LMWH, fondaparinux, rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, dabigatran, warfarin or aspirin with IPC. For patients admitted to the hospital with acute medical illness and has moderate risk of VTE, we recommend prophylaxis with LDUH, LMWH or Fondaparinux. For the same group at high risk of VTE, we recommend combination of pharmacological and mechanical prophylaxis."

CD008201,0,18327398,0,Treatment of pulmonary embolism: The use of low-molecular-weight heparin in the inpatient and outpatient settings.,"Pulmonary embolism (PE) remains a major clinical problem associated with considerable mortality and morbidity. In patients with PE, appropriate anticoagulant therapy has been shown to significantly reduce both recurrence and mortality. Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is at least as effective as unfractionated heparin (UFH) in the treatment of PE, with a similar risk of bleeding. Furthermore, LMWH offers more predictable pharmacokinetics and anticoagulant effects. As a result, current guidelines from both the American College of Chest Physicians and the joint American College of Physicians/American Academy of Family Physicians recommend the use of LMWH over UFH (in patients with submassive PE). Outpatient treatment with LMWH has been shown to be feasible in many patients, and offers the potential for cost-savings and improvements in health-related quality of life. Further data are needed to support an evidence-based recommendation for the use of LMWH in the outpatient treatment of PE."

In the United States and Europe, DVT is present in over 5 million events each year, while PE is present in over 500,000 cases. The purpose of this study is to review the cases that undergo surgery during a period of three months (1,500 cases), from June 15th to September 15th, 2003, at the Angeles of Pedregal Hospital in Mexico City, in order to evaluate the type of risk that each one represents (International Consensus, 1997 ACCP, and the 2000 Mexican Consensus over venous thromboembolism (VTE) questionnaire), and the prophylaxis applied in each case, to be compared with international standards. The Angeles of Pedregal Hospital maintains a general prophylactic standard with its patients equivalent in number to the international standard; however, there is deficiency in the measures taken in orthopedic, high-risk, and very high-risk patients, where prophylaxis was low. It has also been called to our attention that the prophylactic measures taken were insufficient, both in the type of measure that was chosen and the combination of those that were applied, which in relation to the international recommendations were extremely low."

Usually, the diagnosis of APS is made after the first thrombotic event, when a thrombophilia screen is performed. These patients have a high risk of recurrent thromboses and current therapy centres on the use of thromboprophylaxis with warfarin. However, a number of clinical questions keep recurring: do arterial and venous thrombosis require the same intensity of anti-coagulation? When should warfarin be stopped? Should patients who develop thrombosis when other risk factors (oral contraceptive pill, prolonged resting etc.) are present be treated like those without any risk factors but the presence of anti-phospholipid antibodies (aPL)? How to manage a patient with recurrent thrombosis despite a high intensity anti-coagulation (International normalized ratio (INR) between 3.0-4.0)? Since many of the patients with aPL are fertile women, a substantial group of patients are diagnosed after recurrent pregnancy loss. Low-dose aspirin for those patients without previous thrombosis and aspirin plus heparin for patients with a history of thrombotic events are the current therapeutic options. However, some questions remain unanswered: does the addition of heparin to low-dose aspirin in women with first trimester recurrent miscarriage but without previous thrombosis improve foetal outcome over and above aspirin alone? Which is the best therapeutic regime during pregnancy for patients with aPL-associated stroke? When should high-dose intravenous gammaglobulin be considered? Finally, very little is known about the risk of thrombosis in individuals positive for aPL but still free of thrombosis. Should these individuals receive any treatment? If so, which one? In this review we attempt to address some of these questions taking into account available data from retrospective and prospective studies and our own clinical experience."
CD008201,0,18973982,0,Compliance of abdominal aortic aneurysms before and after stenting with tissue doppler imaging: evolution during follow-up and correlation with aneurysm diameter.,"Usual imaging after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) consists of AAA diameter monitoring and endoleak detection. Among additional predictor parameters previously proposed to help clinicians in better identifying subgroups of AAA still at risk of rupture, AAA wall motion after EVAR has been studied, but its value was not clearly established. Tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) is an ultrasonographic modality which allows wall motion measurements along an arterial segment. The aim of the current study was to analyze AAA wall motion with TDI before and after EVAR and to describe its evolution in patients with more than 1 month of follow-up. Twenty-five consecutive patients undergoing EVAR between February 2005 and June 2007 gave informed consent to be prospectively investigated with the TDI system before EVAR and at each visit during follow-up. The mean (SD) follow-up was 13.7 (9.7) months. Maximum mean segmental dilation (MMSD), segmental compliance, dilation at maximum diameter, pressure strain elastic modulus (Ep), and stiffness were compared between three periods (before stenting, before discharge, and at last follow-up), and their relation with AAA diameter was analyzed. A significant decrease in AAA compliance was immediately observed after successful EVAR and remained stable during later follow-up. On the other hand, AAA diameter progressively decreased along time and was statistically lower at the last control compared to the initial value. MMSD, segmental compliance, and dilation at maximum diameter were positively related to AAA diameter. This means that the larger the AAA diameter after stenting, the higher the value for these parameters can be expected. On the contrary, percentage of AAA diameter decrease and percentage of MMSD decrease were not related after successful EVAR. There was no parallelism between loss in compliance and diameter decrease along time, and there is not a unique pattern of AAA diameter and compliance evolution after EVAR. Even if comparison between patients without and with endoleak was weak due to the small sample of the latter group (five patients with endoleak), compliance tended to be greater in case of endoleak. AAA wall motion after successful EVAR reflects complex interactions between all the components of the stented aneurysm which evolve over time, including true compliance of the aneurysm wall itself; intra-aneurysm sac pressure with possible different effects for peak, mean, and pulse pressures; remodeling of the thrombus; stiffness characteristics of the graft; and systemic pressure. Combining simultaneous MMSD records with actual intrasaccular pressure measurements in patients with and without endoleak would improve our understanding of the clinical pulsatility mechanism within AAA after EVAR."
CD008201,0,22653706,0,Thromboprophylaxis in major knee and hip replacement surgery: a review.,"Patients undergoing total knee and total hip replacement (THR/TKR) surgery are at high risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), and routine thromboprophylaxis is recommended after these procedures. However, current thromboprophylaxis may require daily injections, careful anticoagulation monitoring, and dietary restrictions, which can lead to poor patient compliance and suboptimal outcomes. Therefore, there is an unmet need for simpler medication options. Newer oral anticoagulants have improved efficacy over standard treatments, with convenient dosing regimens, more predictable pharmacologic profiles that reduce the need for anticoagulation monitoring, and fewer drug or food interactions. These drugs have the potential to simplify anticoagulation after THR or TKR surgery, which may lead to improved adherence, thus lowering the incidence of VTE and associated complications after surgery."
CD008201,0,22669753,0,"Recurrent miscarriage, antiphospholipid antibodies and the risk of thromboembolic disease.","Miscarriage affects 15 % of women, and while most are sporadic, there is a subset comprising 2-5 % of couples that suffers recurrent miscarriage (RM). Much work has been carried out to try to identify the RM underlying mechanisms. A subgroup of women with RM has been demonstrated to be in a prothrombotic state before pregnancy. The long-term health implications of this hypercoagulability may imply an increased risk of thrombotic events, including ischemic heart disease. Moreover, the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL), rather than thrombophilic genetic defects (i.e., factor V Leiden or prothrombin G202010A mutation) in patients with RM, is a determinant of thrombotic events later in life, especially among those patients having also classic cardiovascular risk factors. These facts may have therapeutic implications. The efficacy of long-term thromboprophylaxis and its associated risk of bleeding is a complex problem in aPL-positive patients who have not developed previous thrombosis or in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome with isolated obstetric morbidity (i.e., RM). While most authors advocate the use of antithrombotic therapy only in patients with aPL and thromboembolic events, there is no consensus as to whether patients who have not experienced yet any thrombotic event might also be given prophylaxis. Low-dose aspirin may be effective in the prevention of thrombosis for asymptomatic, persistently aPL-positive individuals who have additional thrombosis risk factors, i.e., hypertension and lupus anticoagulant have been found to be independent risk factors for thrombosis in aPL carriers, and therefore, the use of thromboprophylaxis in these high-risk subjects could be recommend."

CD008201,0,21765019,0,Incidence of a first thromboembolic event in asymptomatic carriers of high-risk antiphospholipid antibody profile: a multicenter prospective study.,"Persistent antiphospholipid (aPL) antibodies are occasionally found in subjects without prior history of thromboembolic events (TEs), raising the dilemma of whether to initiate or not a primary thromboprophylaxis. A first TE is considered rare in aPL carriers, but previous studies did not consider the aPL profile nor was the test positivity confirmed in a reference laboratory. In this study, 104 subjects with high-risk aPL profile (positive lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin, and anti-β(2)-glycoprotein I antibodies, triple positivity) confirmed in a reference laboratory, were followed up for a mean of 4.5 years. There were 25 first TEs (5.3% per year): the cumulative incidence after 10 years was 37.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 19.9%-54.3%). On multivariate analysis, male sex (hazard ratio = 4.4; 95% CI, 1.5-13.1, P = .007) and risk factors for venous thromboembolism (hazard ratio = 3.3; 95% CI, 1.3-8.5, P = .01) were independent predictors for TEs. Aspirin did not significantly affect the incidence of TE. In conclusion, the occurrence of a first TE in carriers of high-risk aPL profile is considerable; it is more frequent among male subjects and in the presence of additional risk factors for venous TE. These data can help in the decision to initiate primary thromboprophylaxis in these subjects."

Various studies have pointed out that South Asians have a higher prevalence of CAD as compared with other ethnicities. South Asians may have a genetic predisposition to CAD; however, environmental, nutritional, and lifestyle factors may also be responsible. South Asians have a much higher prevalence of metabolic syndrome, diabetes, insulin resistance (and resultant hyperinsulinemia), central obesity, dyslipidemias (lower high-density lipoprotein, increased lipoprotein[a], higher triglyceride levels), increased thrombotic tendency (increased plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and decreased tissue plasminogen activator levels), decreased levels of physical activity, and low birth weights (""fetal origins hypothesis""). In addition, the dietary indiscretions and sedentary lifestyle practiced by most South Asians puts them at a higher risk. A multidisciplinary approach involving the population at risk, healthcare personnel, and the government is required to diminish the incidence. Educational programs regarding the genetic predisposition as well as risk factors for CAD, physical activity, and dietary modifications need to be encouraged. There is a need for implementation of newer guidelines as well as a lower threshold for initiating therapeutic interventions in this population. Mass media should be involved to bring about behavioral changes, and these changes should be reinforced at the physician's level."

CD008201,0,2818889,0,Nursing considerations for the patient with a total artificial heart.,"At our institution, the TAH has been identified as a valuable support to a select subgroup of individuals with end-stage heart disease as a bridge to transplantation. Length of implantation has varied from 1 to 48 days in the PUH series. Management of the care of the TAH-implanted patient requires a collaborative effort by nurses, physicians, and biomedical engineers. Nurses caring for the patient must have extensive knowledge of postoperative care of the high-risk cardiac surgical patient that is supplemented by the specialized knowledge of TAH function and monitoring. We have identified specialized components to the nursing care of the patient following TAH implantation. Monitoring for hemorrhage is important in the immediate postoperative period; anticoagulation and assessment of possible embolic events are later considerations. Knowledge of the relationship between TAH function and changing preload and afterload enhances the nurses' interpretation of COMDU and hemodynamic monitoring parameters, and is essential when applied to other nursing interventions, such as patient positioning and mobilization. Nursing-care measures to prevent atelectasis or consolidation are essential to prevention of pneumonia. Prevention of infection is crucial to facilitate transplantation. Practice of aseptic technique with particular care to drive-line insertion sites is necessary. Pain management, as well as nutritional and psychologic support, are important to promote patient well-being (a nursing-care plan is outlined in Table 1). The goals of all nursing-care measures are an improved perfusion state as offered by the TAH, prevention of possible complications associated with TAH implantation, and prevention of possible complications of critical illness and immobility. The desired outcome is a patient with a stabilized or improving condition prior to cardiac transplantation. It has been exciting to participate in the development of nursing-care guidelines for a patient population that has little precedent. The TAH creates a symbiotic relationship between man and machine, and nursing-care responsibilities have grown to encompass the mechanical aspects of this relationship. Satisfaction has increased as well, as the nurse is able to provide a specialized service in the provision of a life-saving therapy and be a vital element in the successful implementation of an artificial-heart program. As advances are made in the development of mechanical devices that assist or replace the human heart, ongoing evaluation and refinement of nursing care guidelines are essential."

The reasons for this are unclear. To explore specialist palliative care units (SPCU) directors' views on thromboprophylaxis in the inpatient unit, audiotaped semi-structured interviews were conducted with SCPU medical directors to explore factors influencing thromboprophylaxis practice. Purposive sampling of units known not to have thromboprophylaxis guidelines was conducted (as identified from previous research). The hospice directory was used to sample from units in each region of Great Britain and Ireland to ensure representation across the specialty. Interviews were transcribed and analysed using interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA). Four major and four sub themes were identified. Participants were progressive in their attitudes to palliative care and comfortable with instigating active interventions for patient benefit. Symptomatic venous thromboembolism (VTE) was rarely seen and therefore not considered important enough to warrant guidelines. There was concern that evidence informing thromboprophylaxis guidelines in the general population was not transferable to the advanced cancer population and that the outcome measures from these studies were less meaningful to a palliative care patient. Thromboprophylaxis was considered a life prolonging intervention which may result in a poorer death than one because of VTE. Nevertheless, participants were receptive to change if presented with convincing evidence derived from a representative population. Until the true prevalence and symptomatic burden of VTE is known, the role of thromboprophylaxis in the SPCU setting will remain controversial. There is a need for a well-designed study to explore the utility of thromboprophylaxis in the palliative care inpatient setting. However, this will require meaningful outcome measures to be used within a clinically applicable population."

The presence of AF increases lifetime stroke risk nearly 5-fold. Conventionally, patients at moderate or high risk of stroke have been prescribed antiplatelet agents or vitamin K antagonists to reduce the risk, but each has significant limitations. Accordingly, the development of new oral anticoagulants (direct thrombin inhibitors [DTIs] and factor Xa inhibitors) has attracted significant interest. The DTI dabigatran etexilate was recently shown to provide superior risk reduction to warfarin for stroke and systemic embolism for patients with nonvalvular AF and recently gained US Food and Drug Administration approval for this indication. Dabigatran etexilate is the first new agent for this indication in the United States in more than 50 years. Herein, we outline the options for stroke prevention in AF in the new oral anticoagulant era. The efficacy and practical obstacles surrounding the use of warfarin are summarized. We then review the mechanism of action, efficacy, and safety of dabigatran-including clinically relevant pharmacokinetics. Practical issues of initiation, conversion of anticoagulant therapy, and recommendations for dabigatran use in patients at high risk of bleeding and other special populations are discussed.

We investigated the rate of venous thromboembolism and wound leakage in 1728 patients undergoing primary joint replacement, both before and after the introduction of dabigatran, and following its subsequent withdrawal from our unit. We found that the use of dabigatran led to a significant increase in post-operative wound leakage (20% with dabigatran, 5% with a multimodal regimen; p < 0.001), which also resulted in an increased duration of hospital stay. The rate of thromboembolism in patients receiving dabigatran was higher (1.3%) than in those receiving the multimodal thromboprophylaxis regimen, including low molecular weight heparin as an inpatient and the extended use of aspirin (0.3%, p = 0.047).

Radical retropubic prostatectomy is a common treatment for localized prostate cancer and has been identified as a high risk procedure for postoperative venous thromboembolism. However, most patients diagnosed with prostate cancer in the current era have clinically localized, low volume disease and the risk of venous thromboembolism is very low. Multiple guidelines exist for the prevention of venous thromboembolism in patients undergoing radical retropubic prostatectomy and pharmacological venous thromboembolism prophylaxis is recommended. Most urological surgeons in the USA however, do not routinely utilize pharmacological prophylaxis. A major concern arises when radical retropubic prostatectomy is performed with a concomitant pelvic lymphadenectomy. Pharmacological prophylaxis is known to increase the rate of lymph drainage and the rate of lymphocele formation. Evidence suggests that lymphocele may be an independent risk factor for venous thromboembolism in the postoperative period. These factors raise concern over current guidelines calling for routine use of pharmacological venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in radical retropubic prostatectomy especially when lymphadenectomy is performed simultaneously."

A risk model was derived and validated in an independent cohort of 1365 patients from the same study. Five predictive variables were identified in a multivariate model: site of cancer (2 points for very high-risk site, 1 point for high-risk site), platelet count of 350 x 10(9)/L or more, hemoglobin less than 100 g/L (10 g/dL) and/or use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, leukocyte count more than 11 x 10(9)/L, and body mass index of 35 kg/m(2) or more (1 point each). Rates of VTE in the derivation and validation cohorts, respectively, were 0.8% and 0.3% in low-risk (score = 0), 1.8% and 2% in intermediate-risk (score = 1-2), and 7.1% and 6.7% in high-risk (score >/= 3) category over a median of 2.5 months (C-statistic = 0.7 for both cohorts).

Pharmacologic prophylaxis with either subcutaneous heparin or low molecular heparinoids should be given to all high-risk neurologic and neurosurgical patients provided there are no major contraindications. The major concern would be a risk of bleeding but in some patients alternate drugs must be considered given the risk of thrombosis (i.e., in the context of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia). The immediate or long-term treatment of full dose anticoagulation for VTE may not be appropriate in all patients as VTE therapy represents a balance between the risks of bleeding related to anticoagulant therapy versus the risk of recurrent events. An inferior vena cava (IVC) filter is another option in these patients but may not necessarily be the best choice for most neurologic patients. Given the high risk of VTE in patients with neurologic diseases, early recognition by clinicians of the signs and symptoms of VTE is essential."

CD008201,0,17916101,0,The management of antenatal venous thromboembolism in the UK and Ireland: a prospective multicentre observational survey.,"This prospective observational study reports on 126 women from 25 UK centres with image-proven antenatal venous thromboembolism (VTE), 62% deep vein thrombosis and 38% pulmonary embolism. Thrombophilia screening was of limited benefit except to identify antithrombin deficiency. Sixteen (13%) patients had previous VTE, all but one was related to previous pregnancy or combined oral contraceptive and 12 received no thromboprophylaxis in the index pregnancy, the other four thus received inadequate low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) doses. Treatment was with dalteparin in 25%, enoxaparin in 47%, tinzaparin in 25% and unfractionated heparin alone in 3%. 66% of patients received once-daily LMWH. Anti-activated factor X (anti-Xa) monitoring was performed at 90% of centres, with a wide range of target values. Thus current management of antenatal VTE, despite widely diverse clinical practice, appeared effective and safe, for there were no recurrent events and postpartum haemorrhage was not increased when compared to known rates. Larger studies are required to confirm this. The need for twice as opposed to once daily LMWH and for anti-Xa monitoring is questioned by this study. The importance of clinical risk assessment and adherence to the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists guidelines on antenatal thromboprophylaxis, with adequate LMWH dosing is confirmed."
CD008201,0,8629673,0,A critical pathway to treat proximal lower-extremity deep vein thrombosis.,"To address variation in treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) while maximizing the efficiency and quality of care, our institution developed a critical pathway guideline. This paper presents this critical pathway and the clinical rationale underlying its recommendations. The DVT pathway synthesizes recommendations for all aspects of patient care, including laboratory evaluation at admission, dosing and management of heparin therapy, timing of warfarin initiation, elements of patient education, discharge planning, and anticipated duration of heparinization and hospitalization. Differences among interpretations of the medical literature, patient populations, physician skills, test availability, and other variables make it unlikely that all elements of this pathway would best meet the needs of another institution. Nevertheless, the critical pathway format and the specific contents of this pathway may serve as a useful benchmark for others involved in creating clinical guidelines for this patient population."

CD008201,0,23556111,0,Prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism in patients with cancer.,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is the second leading cause of death and a major cause of morbidity in patients with cancer. Pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis is recommended in all hospitalized cancer patients without contraindications to anticoagulants. The role of thromboprophylaxis in outpatients undergoing chemotherapy is less certain because of the diversity of the tumor types and their associated risks of VTE and bleeding. Thromboprophylaxis should only be considered in patients at high risk for VTE. Cancer patients with a newly diagnosed VTE should be preferably treated with low-molecular-weight heparin for a minimum of 3-6 months. Treatment duration should be individualized based on the clinical status and stage of the cancer, the risk of recurrent VTE, the risk of bleeding, and personal preference of the patient. Further research is required to assess the role of the new oral anticoagulants (direct Xa and thrombin inhibitors) for this high-risk population."
CD008201,0,23953696,0,In-hospital major bleeding and its clinical relevance in patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention.,"Advances in antithrombotic therapy for ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) enhance the risk of bleeding. Therefore, the incidence, determinants, and prognostic implications of in-hospital major bleeding after primary percutaneous coronary intervention for STEMI were investigated. In 963 consecutive patients, the incidence of bleeding was evaluated according to commonly used classifications including Can Rapid risk stratification of Unstable angina patients Suppress Adverse outcomes with Early implementation of the ACC/AHA guidelines, Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction, Global Use of Strategies To Open coronary arteries, and Bleeding Academic Research Consortium. Multivariate regression analyses investigated determinants of bleeding and the relation between bleeding and 1-year all-cause mortality. Large variability in incidence existed depending on classification (1.3% to 21%). Female gender, heart rate, creatinine, multivessel disease, cardiogenic shock, and procedural failure were independently associated with bleeding. One-year mortality reached 10.2% in bleeders versus 2.0% in nonbleeders (p <0.001). Bleeding was independently associated with an increased risk of 1-year mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 2.41, p <0.017). Assessment of individual classifications confirmed the increased risk of mortality for Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (HR 2.27, p = 0.048), but not for Can Rapid risk stratification of Unstable angina patients Suppress Adverse outcomes with Early implementation of the ACC/AHA guidelines, Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction, and Global Use of Strategies To Open coronary arteries bleeding. Thrombotic events occurred more frequently in bleeders (5.8% vs 1.5%, p <0.001); however, bleeding remained independently related to mortality with a negligible reduction in HR (2.25, p = 0.028) after adjustment. In conclusion, in-hospital major bleeding was frequently observed after STEMI, but a widespread variation in incidence existed depending on the applied definition. Patient and procedural characteristics were related to bleeding, allowing identification of high-risk patients. In-hospital major bleeding was independently associated with 1-year all-cause mortality; however, not all bleeding classifications proved equally relevant to prognosis. The relation between bleeding and mortality was shown not to be driven by the higher rate of thrombotic events among bleeders."

CD008201,0,12911587,0,Acenocoumarol therapy in pediatric patients.,"To determine guidelines for administering and monitoring acenocoumarol therapy in children, 93 patients (median 5.1 years, range: 0.2-18 years) were prospectively evaluated over a 33-month period. The loading doses used were: <1 year, 0.20 mg x kg-1; >1-5 years, 0.09 mg x kg-1; 6-10 years, 0.07 mg x kg-1; 11-18 years, 0.06 mg x kg-1. In this study, the loading dose and the dose to achieve and maintain target therapeutic range (TTR) for acenocoumarol are age-dependent, with infants having the highest and teenagers having the lowest requirements. The use of a different loading dose according to age has allowed most of the children (80%) in all the age groups to achieve TTR in less than 1 week. No patients had serious bleeding or thrombotic complications. We conclude that there is an age-dependent response to acenocoumarol in pediatric patients. The implementation of an age-adjusted loading dose regimen reduces the length of hospitalization required to achieve effective anticoagulant therapy."

CD008201,0,22487774,0,The efficacy of rivaroxaban in patients with atrial fibrillation.,"Atrial fibrillation (AF), the most common form of cardiac arrhythmia, is a major risk factor for cardioembolic stroke. Dose-adjusted warfarin has been the gold standard for stroke prophylaxis in moderate- to high-risk patients with AF. However, the use of warfarin therapy is greatly limited by its narrow therapeutic window, numerous dietary restrictions, and drug-drug interactions, and an increased risk of hemorrhage. As a result, great emphasis has been placed on developing a new anticoagulant agent with fewer risks and limitations. Current data suggest that the oral direct factor Xa inhibitor rivaroxaban is a safe and effective alternative to warfarin. Furthermore, rivaroxaban does not require routine coagulation monitoring, which may improve patient compliance to anticoagulant therapy. The ROCKET AF trial demonstrated that 20-mg oral rivaroxaban taken once daily was noninferior to dose-adjusted warfarin in the prevention of stroke and non-central nervous system systemic embolism and had a comparable risk of bleeding. Based primarily on the ROCKET AF trial results, the US Food and Drug Administration recently approved the use of rivaroxaban for stroke prophylaxis in patients with nonvalvular AF. However, additional postmarketing studies on its safety and cost effectiveness are needed before it can be widely accepted as a sound alternative to warfarin."
CD008201,0,24111601,0,Evolving pattern of platelet P2Y12 inhibition in patients with acute coronary syndromes.,"Dual antiplatelet therapy consisting of clopidogrel in addition to aspirin has previously been the standard of care for patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) but international guidelines have been evolving over the last 4 years with the introduction of prasugrel and ticagrelor. In October 2009, prasugrel was approved in the UK by the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) for use in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), diabetic patients with non-ST-elevation (NSTE) ACS undergoing PCI and patients with stent thrombosis while other ACS patients were to continue receiving clopidogrel. Ticagrelor was approved in October 2011 by NICE for use in patients with moderate-to-high risk NSTE ACS and STEMI undergoing primary PCI and was recommended in preference to clopidogrel in European guidelines. These recommendations were adopted in our region, constituting a population of 1.8 million. We studied the effect of changing patterns of P2Y12 inhibitor usage on levels of platelet inhibition during maintenance therapy. Patients admitted to Northern General Hospital, Sheffield, with NSTE ACS or STEMI managed with primary PCI were enrolled over two periods of time: May 2010 to November 2011 (T1); and October 2012 to February 2013 (T2). Venous blood samples were obtained at 1 month after the onset of ACS. Light transmittance aggregometry (LTA) was performed and maximum aggregation response to ADP 20 μM was determined. A total of 116 patients were enrolled in T1 of whom 82 were receiving clopidogrel and 34 were receiving prasugrel. Twenty-nine patients were enrolled in T2, all of whom were receiving ticagrelor. Mean LTA results according to treatment with clopidogrel, prasugrel and ticagrelor were 57 ± 18%, 41 ± 20%, and 31 ± 12%, respectively. Prasugrel was associated with significantly lower platelet aggregation responses than clopidogrel (p < 0.001) and ticagrelor was associated with significantly lower platelet aggregation responses than both prasugrel (p = 0.015) and clopidogrel (p < 0.001). We conclude that international guidelines and NICE approval have led to increasing levels of P2Y12 inhibition in ACS patients in this UK centre between May 2010 and February 2013. Ticagrelor was associated with significantly greater P2Y12 inhibition than both clopidogrel and prasugrel during maintenance therapy."
CD008201,0,18574271,0,Prevention of venous thromboembolism: American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines (8th Edition).,"This article discusses the prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and is part of the Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy: American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines (8th Edition). Grade 1 recommendations are strong and indicate that the benefits do or do not outweigh risks, burden, and costs. Grade 2 suggestions imply that individual patient values may lead to different choices (for a full discussion of the grading, see the ""Grades of Recommendation"" chapter by Guyatt et al). Among the key recommendations in this chapter are the following: we recommend that every hospital develop a formal strategy that addresses the prevention of VTE (Grade 1A). We recommend against the use of aspirin alone as thromboprophylaxis for any patient group (Grade 1A), and we recommend that mechanical methods of thromboprophylaxis be used primarily for patients at high bleeding risk (Grade 1A) or possibly as an adjunct to anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis (Grade 2A). For patients undergoing major general surgery, we recommend thromboprophylaxis with a low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), low-dose unfractionated heparin (LDUH), or fondaparinux (each Grade 1A). We recommend routine thromboprophylaxis for all patients undergoing major gynecologic surgery or major, open urologic procedures (Grade 1A for both groups), with LMWH, LDUH, fondaparinux, or intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC). For patients undergoing elective hip or knee arthroplasty, we recommend one of the following three anticoagulant agents: LMWH, fondaparinux, or a vitamin K antagonist (VKA); international normalized ratio (INR) target, 2.5; range, 2.0 to 3.0 (each Grade 1A). For patients undergoing hip fracture surgery (HFS), we recommend the routine use of fondaparinux (Grade 1A), LMWH (Grade 1B), a VKA (target INR, 2.5; range, 2.0 to 3.0) [Grade 1B], or LDUH (Grade 1B). We recommend that patients undergoing hip or knee arthroplasty or HFS receive thromboprophylaxis for a minimum of 10 days (Grade 1A); for hip arthroplasty and HFS, we recommend continuing thromboprophylaxis > 10 days and up to 35 days (Grade 1A). We recommend that all major trauma and all spinal cord injury (SCI) patients receive thromboprophylaxis (Grade 1A). In patients admitted to hospital with an acute medical illness, we recommend thromboprophylaxis with LMWH, LDUH, or fondaparinux (each Grade 1A). We recommend that, on admission to the ICU, all patients be assessed for their risk of VTE, and that most receive thromboprophylaxis (Grade 1A)."

However, VTE risk may be underestimated using computer-based tools alone.

CD008201,0,23576900,0,Mechanism of and therapeutic strategy for atrial fibrillation associated with diabetes mellitus.,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is one of the most important risk factors for atrial fibrillation (AF) and is a predictor of stroke and thromboembolism. DM may increase the incidence of AF, and when it is combined with other risk factors, the incidence of stroke and thromboembolism may also be higher; furthermore, hospitalization due to heart failure appears to increase. Maintenance of well-controlled blood glucose and low levels of HbA1c in accordance with guidelines may decrease the incidence of AF. The mechanisms of AF associated with DM are autonomic remodeling, electrical remodeling, structural remodeling, and insulin resistance. Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system is suggested to be an upstream therapy for this type of AF. Studies have indicated that catheter ablation may be effective for AF associated with DM, restoring sinus rhythm and improving prognosis. Catheter ablation combined with hypoglycemic agents may further increase the rate of maintenance of sinus rhythm and reduce the need for reablation."
CD008201,0,12958614,0,Incidence of symptomatic venous thromboembolism after different elective or urgent surgical procedures.,"There have been no comprehensive studies that have compared the incidence of symptomatic VTE over a spectrum of different urgent or elective surgical procedures. In this study we determined the incidence of symptomatic venous thromboembolic events (VTE) within a 3 month period after 76 different surgical procedures. Using a large administrative data-base, we analyzed 1,653,275 cases that underwent one of 76 selected surgical procedures between January 1, 1992 and September 30, 1996. The principal outcomes were venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, during either the initial hospitalization or a re-hospitalization for VTE within 91 days of the date of surgery. Predictors of VTE were analyzed using logistic regression. Overall, VTE was diagnosed in 13,533 cases (0.8%, 95% CI = 0.7-0.9%) and of these, 5049 (37%, 95% CI = 36-38%) had pulmonary embolism. Predictors of VTE included: advancing age (OR=1.1 per 5 year increment in age, 95% CI =1.1-1.1), Latino ethnicity (OR = 0.9, 95% CI = 0.8-0.9), Asian/Pacific Islander ethnicity (OR = 0.5, 95% CI = 0.4-0.6), presence of a malignancy (OR = 1.7, 95% CI = 1.6-1.8) and prior VTE (OR = 6.2, 95% CI = 5.5-7.0). High-risk procedures that had an incidence of symptomatic VTE of approximately 2 to 3% included invasive neurosurgery, total hip arthroplasty, major vascular surgery and radical cystectomy. Fifty-six percent of all VTE events diagnosed within 91 days of surgery occurred after discharge. The findings of this study provide a basis for categorizing different surgical procedures as low, intermediate, high and very high risk for VTE. Because of the high incidence of VTE diagnosed after hospital discharge, further studies of extended thromboprophylaxis appear warranted."

However, there are concerns as to the long-term safety profile of DES, particularly in terms of late stent thrombosis.

CD008201,0,10445613,0,Contribution of noninvasive evaluation to the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism in hospitalized patients.,"The effectiveness of new diagnostic tools for suspected pulmonary embolism (PE), such as clinical probability assessment, plasma D-dimer (DD) measurement and lower limb venous compression ultrasonography (US), has not been specifically studied in patients with a suspected PE occurring during hospital stay. This study applied a sequential, decision analysis-based strategy adding these instruments to a ventilation/perfusion lung scan in a cohort of 114 consecutive inpatients clinically suspected of PE in order to establish in how many patients a pulmonary angiogram could thereby be avoided. A definitive diagnosis could be established by the noninvasive protocol in 61% of these patients: normal/near-normal lung scan, 14%; high probability lung scan, 19%; clinical probability combined with lung scan result, 18%; and US, 8%. Specificity of DD was only 7% and contributed to the exclusion of PE in only two patients. Pulmonary angiography was required in 39% of patients. The 3-month thromboembolic risk in patients in whom PE was excluded by the diagnostic process was 0% (95% confidence interval 0-4.9%). In conclusion, a noninvasive work-up for suspected pulmonary embolism is effective in hospitalized patients, allowing to forego angiography in 61% of them, and it appears to be safe, although this should be further investigated. In contrast to outpatients, D-dimer measurement appears to be useless in hospitalized patients."
CD008201,0,24522152,0,Epidemiology of venous thrombosis in children with cancer.,"There has been an extensive body of research focusing on the epidemiology of thrombosis in adult cancer populations; however, there is significantly less knowledge about thrombosis in paediatric cancer populations. Thrombosis is diagnosed with increasing frequency in children being treated for cancer, and there is an urgent need to increase our understanding of the epidemiology of thrombosis in this population. Currently, there are no guidelines for identification of high-risk groups, prophylaxis or management of thrombotic complications in paediatric cancer patients. We reviewed the available literature regarding the epidemiology, mechanisms, risk factors, prophylaxis and outcomes of thrombosis in children with cancer and identified areas that require further research. The reported incidence of symptomatic venous thromboembolism (VTE) in children with cancer ranges between 2.1% and 16%, while the incidence of asymptomatic events is approximately 40%. Approximately 30% of VTE in this population is associated with central venous lines (CVL). The most common location of VTE is upper and lower extremity deep venous thrombosis (43 to 50% of events, respectively), while 50% of events in ALL patients occur in the central nervous system. Key characteristics that increase the risk of thrombosis include the type of cancer, age of the patient, the presence of a CVL, presence of pulmonary/intra thoracic disease, as well as the type of chemotherapy. Outcomes for paediatric cancer patients with VTE include post-thrombotic syndrome, pulmonary embolism, recurrent thromboembolism, destruction of upper venous system and death. Prospective studies aimed at enabling risk stratification of patients are required to facilitate development of paediatric specific recommendations related to thromboprophylaxis in this population."
CD008201,0,14740967,0,Should nursing home residents with atrial fibrillation be anticoagulated?,"Most long-term care residents with atrial fibrillation would be at high risk for embolic stroke based on age and comorbidities according to the criteria presented here. Additionally, they are theoretically excellent candidates for adjusted-dose warfarin treatment for atrial fibrillation. They are accessible for monitoring and tend to have less dietary variability, a controlled medication list, and supervised medication administration. Balancing these features is at least a moderate risk of severe bleeding from anticoagulation based on age, comorbidities, and polypharmacy. However, studies suggest that even those long-term care residents identified as ideal candidates for anticoagulation may not receive warfarin. Those residents who do receive warfarin may not be anticoagulated within the therapeutic range much of the time. This treatment pattern may expose older adults with a high stroke risk to dying from a cardioembolic stroke or to acquiring functional deficits that make them more dependent and lower their quality of life."
CD008201,0,16127001,0,Management of thrombosis in antiphospholipid syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus in pregnancy.,"Pregnancy is a high risk period for thrombosis in women with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL). Thrombosis may affect the mother, both in the venous and arterial beds, and also have a role in pregnancy loss. Thromboprophylaxis thus is warranted in most of these women. However, specific regimens containing low-dose aspirin, unfractionated heparin (UH), low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), and even dicumarinics in some circumstances after the first trimester are still a matter of controversy. Women with previous thrombosis should receive full antithrombotic doses of UH or LMWH during the whole pregnancy. Treatment of pregnancy losses is more debated, consisting of low-dose aspirin with or without associated heparin. The choice of treatment for a given patient must always take into account the woman's opinion after a careful discussion with the treating physician. Peripartum thromboprophylaxis with LMWH in women receiving aspirin-only regimens and prevention of osteoporosis in those treated with heparin are considered essential in the medical management of these patients."

CD008201,0,23553464,0,Role of the pharmacist in achieving performance measures to improve the prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism.,"Current prescribing practices for venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis and treatment are suboptimal, particularly regarding the use of appropriate prophylaxis in accordance with evidence-based guidelines. Failure to prevent avoidable VTE is associated with a substantial clinical and economic burden, due not only to the initial event, but also to VTE recurrence and long-term sequelae. Quality improvement initiatives such as the Surgical Care Improvement Project, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the National Quality Forum, and The Joint Commission have developed performance measures to address the shortfall and improve adherence with best-practice recommendations. Several studies have highlighted the benefits of pharmacist-led anticoagulation services for reducing the occurrence of VTE and bleeding complications while reducing excess hospitalization and health care costs. By assuming responsibility for anticoagulation management, pharmacists can ensure that at-risk patients receive the correct drug at the correct dose for the correct duration, from initial presentation to outpatient follow-up. Increasing continuity of care in this manner will ultimately improve patient outcomes and reduce costs. Pharmacists can also play a key role in helping hospitals achieve performance measures by aiding in the development and implementation of local VTE guidelines, policies, and other quality improvement initiatives; by helping to establish critical pathways with protocols; and by providing valuable education for other health care professionals and patients alike. Pharmacists are in an ideal position to facilitate achievement of VTE-related performance measures and can thus substantially contribute to the much-needed improvement in current VTE prevention and care."
CD008201,0,10939307,0,Use of oral anticoagulants in older patients.,"Recently published American and British guidelines have comprehensively reviewed the indications for long term anticoagulation. The best evidence currently available supports the use of long term oral anticoagulants in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF), venous thromboembolic disease, ischaemic heart disease, mural thrombi, and mechanical heart valves. Selected patients with valvular heart disease, cerebral vascular disease, and peripheral arterial disease may also benefit from the use of these drugs. When no specific contraindications are present, elderly patients with either paroxysmal or persistent NVAF should be considered candidates for treatment with anticoagulants. Pooled analyses of the results from 9 randomised trials demonstrate that warfarin significantly reduces the risk of ischaemic stroke in patients with NVAF, particularly those in a 'high risk' category defined by the presence of additional clinical or echocardiographic risk factors. Long term anticoagulation does not appear to be justified in patients with NVAF considered to be at 'low risk' for stroke. Because the prevalence of NVAF and most other cardiovascular conditions increases with advancing age, many elderly patients will be candidates for thromboprophylaxis. The potential benefit of long term anticoagulation must be carefully weighed against the risk of serious haemorrhage in such patients. Bleeding complications with anticoagulant drugs appear to occur more frequently in older patients than in younger individuals. Advanced age (>75 years), intensity of anticoagulation [International Normalised Ratio (INR) >4.0], history of cerebral vascular disease (recent or remote), and concomitant use of drugs that interfere with haemostasis [aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs] are among the most important variables in determining an individual's risk for major bleeding with anticoagulants. Older patients often display increased sensitivity to the effects of warfarin, both in the early induction phase and during the long term maintenance phase of therapy. Conditions such as congestive heart failure, malignancy, malnutrition, diarrhoea and unsuspected vitamin K deficiency, enhance the prothrombin time response. The decision to interrupt anticoagulant therapy before elective surgery in elderly patients should evaluate the thrombotic risk of such a manoeuvre versus the risk of bleeding if anticoagulants are continued. In non-surgical patients, excessively elevated INRs without associated haemorrhage can usually be managed by simply witholding one or several doses of warfarin. If more rapid reversal is needed, small doses of phytomenadione (vitamin K1) can be administered safely without overcorrection or the development of vitamin K-induced warfarin resistance."
CD008201,0,22707553,0,A 56-year-old woman with early acute pulmonary emboli following pelvic reconstructive surgery.,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) remains a significant cause of postoperative morbidity and mortality. There are few reports on acute symptomatic pulmonary embolism (PE) following urogynaecological surgery. The authors report a case of an adult woman who developed a massive acute PE early on postoperative day 1 following a complex reconstructive surgery. Following anticoagulation treatment and placement of an inferior vena cava filter, the patient recovered and was discharged without discomfort on the ninth postoperative day. While recognition of the early occurrence of VTE is important to ensure optimal patient care following major pelvic surgery, this case highlights the need to reconsider VTE prophylaxis protocols in moderate to high-risk populations undergoing elective surgery."

Risk factors for stroke include hypertension, family history, and diabetes mellitus. The subtypes of stroke are ischemia, infarction, and hemorrhage. Ischemia and infarction are the result of atherosclerotic development of thrombi and emboli. Decreased and/or absent cerebral circulation causes neuronal cellular injury and death. Intracerebral hemorrhage occurs from rupture of cerebral vessels often as the result of hypertension. Patient assessment and diagnosis include the use of computed tomography scans, magnetic resonance imaging, and the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale, and treatment depends on the etiology of the stroke. Thrombolytic therapy is the mainstay of treatment for thrombotic and embolic events. Current recommendations for future stroke care include the development of designated stroke centers. Directions for research in stroke treatment includes examining neuroprotective therapies."

Her ECG in clinic showed ST elevation inferiorly and she was admitted from clinic for further investigations as inpatient. She was initiated on the acute coronary syndrome protocol and underwent emergency left heart catheterisation on the day of admission. The coronary angiogram revealed large aneurysmal dilations in the right coronary artery and left main stem. A ventriculogram showed poor left ventricular (LV) systolic function in line with subsequent transthoracic echocardiogram, which revealed her to have an left ventricular ejection-fraction (LVEF) of approximately 20%. It was agreed with the cardiothoracic surgeons to treat the aneurysms non-operatively and start low-molecular weight heparin. Furthermore the underlying biventricular impairment was treated with ACE-inhibitors, β-blockers and diuretic therapy (loop and potassium-sparing). The strategy was to prevent further thrombus formation with the aneurysmal vessels and to achieve this the patient was initiated on lifelong warfarin. Other medical risk factors were optimised and patient started on statin medication. The aneurysm was monitored with serial CTs with a view to reconsider surgical intervention if any evidence of dilation. This case highlights an unusual cause of ST elevation myocardial infarction."

This disease is multifactorial and chronic, due to the risks of recurrence, and can cause severe complications (death, pulmonary hypertension, residual postphlebitic syndrome). Randomized, controlled clinical trials (Medenox, Prevent, Artemis) demonstrated the unquestionable preventive benefits of low-molecular-weight heparins and fondaparinux from hospitalization on, in a specific group of ""medical"" patients at minimum risk of bleeding. These findings support the systematic use of medical thromboprophylaxis in patients meeting the study criteria, as per the ACCP 2008 guidelines. However, only 50% of the patients in which thromboprophylaxis is indicated receive a treatment. This under-use can be explained by with the wide variety of patients, as well as the difficulty to assess thromboembolic risks. Overall risk assessment models, simple and clinically relevant, were developed to facilitate the decision to initiate an appropriate thromboprophylaxis in patients hospitalized in medical area."

CD008201,0,17904084,0,"Prevention of venous thromboembolism, recurrent stroke, and other vascular events after acute ischemic stroke: the role of low-molecular-weight heparin and antiplatelet therapy.","Patients with stroke or transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) are at increased risk of vascular events, such as recurrent stroke or venous thromboembolism (VTE), and thus the secondary prevention of such events is an important element of managing these patients. Current guidelines recommend that patients with acute stroke, restricted mobility, and no contraindications to anticoagulants receive thromboprophylactic therapy with low-dose unfractionated heparin (UFH), low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), or heparinoids to prevent VTE. This recommendation is based on clinical trial evidence that UFH is effective in reducing the incidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) after stroke. LMWHs have been shown to be at least as effective as UFH in preventing VTE, and offer advantages in terms of a more predictable anticoagulant effect, lower risk of bleeding, and ease of administration. However, adequately powered trials are needed to confirm their relative benefits and risks; the Prevention of VTE after Acute Ischemic Stroke with LMWH (PREVAIL) study with enoxaparin, currently in progress, should provide valuable information in this context. Antiplatelet therapy has been shown to be effective in preventing recurrent vascular events, as evidenced by the results of studies such as the Clopidogrel versus Aspirin in Patients at Risk of Ischaemic Events (CAPRIE) trial. In contrast, evidence for the efficacy of LMWH in this situation is contradictory. Given the potential benefits of LMWH in preventing VTE in stroke patients, a potential rationale exists for combination therapy with antiplatelet agents and LMWHs. Clinical trials with such combinations are warranted."

In a post hoc analysis of a randomized study (MC-4), which compared the efficacy and safety of certoparin (3000 anti-Xa IU, subcutaneously, once-daily) with unfractionated heparin (5000 IU, subcutaneously, three-times daily) in 23078 patients undergoing surgery lasting more than 30 min, the incidence of autopsy-confirmed fatal pulmonary embolism, death and bleeding in the cancer patients (n=6124) was compared with non-cancer patients (n=16954).

Triple therapy confers a higher bleeding risk than either warfarin or dual antiplatelet therapy alone. However, warfarin alone is inadequate for patients with indications for triple therapy because of an unacceptable risk of stent thrombosis, and dual antiplatelet therapy is inferior to warfarin for the prevention of ischemic strokes in patients with atrial fibrillation, mechanical valves, or intraventricular thrombosis. Hospitalists face the challenge of balancing the aforementioned risks; the optimal management of these patients requires knowledge of the relevant literature and expertise. In this paper, we review the current literature on antiplatelet and anticoagulant combinations in patients with atrial fibrillation and coronary stents in order to improve adherence to published guidelines and to reduce the risk of bleeding."

The LMWHs dalteparin and enoxaparin reduce the rate of VTE by at least 50% if administered for 4-5 weeks following major orthopedic surgery, compared with in-hospital prophylaxis for 7-15 days. Meta-analyses have confirmed that the size of the reduction is similar for both clinical and asymptomatic VTE. Vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) have been shown to be associated with significantly higher bleeding rates compared with LMWH when used as prolonged prophylaxis against VTE following major orthopedic surgery. Patients with cancer are a recognized group at high risk of VTE, and those undergoing major surgery for their malignancy are at particular risk. Evidence from clinical trials is amassing to show that prolonged prophylaxis with LMWH (dalteparin, enoxaparin) in these patients can significantly reduce the rate of postoperative VTE. In cancer patients with acute VTE, the traditional approach is to initiate acute treatment with unfractionated heparin or LMWH followed by long-term treatment with VKA to prevent recurrence. However, clinical trial data have confirmed that the LMWH dalteparin, when administered for 6 months, is significantly more effective than VKA in preventing recurrence, cutting the rate of VTE by 52% without increasing the risk of bleeding. A new and intriguing area of interest is whether LMWH can enhance survival in patients with cancer. Preliminary data suggest that a biological effect of LMWH may act to prolong survival in patients with cancer."
CD008201,0,21819537,0,Management of patients with recently implanted coronary stents on dual antiplatelet therapy who need to undergo major surgery.,"About 5% of patients undergoing coronary stenting need to undergo surgery within the next year. The risk of perioperative cardiac ischemic events, particularly stent thrombosis (ST), is high in these patients, because surgery has a prothrombotic effect and antiplatelet therapy is often withdrawn in order to avoid bleeding. The clinical and angiographic predictors of ST are well known, and the proximity to an acute coronary syndrome adds to the risk. The current guidelines recommend delaying non-urgent surgery for at least 6 weeks after the placement of a bare metal stent and for 6-12 months after the placement of a drug-eluting stent, when the risk of ST is reduced. However, in the absence of formal evidence, these recommendations provide little support with regard to managing urgent operations. When surgery cannot be postponed, stratifying the risk of surgical bleeding and cardiac ischemic events is crucial in order to manage perioperative antiplatelet therapy in individual cases. Dual antiplatelet therapy should not be withdrawn for minor surgery or most gastrointestinal endoscopic procedures. Aspirin can be safely continued perioperatively in the case of most major surgery, and provides coronary protection. In the case of interventions at high risk for both bleeding and ischemic events, when clopidogrel withdrawal is required in order to reduce perioperative bleeding, perioperative treatment with the short-acting intravenous glycoprotein IIb-IIIa inhibitor tirofiban is safe in terms of bleeding, and provides strong antithrombotic protection. Such surgical interventions should be performed at hospitals capable of performing an immediate percutaneous coronary intervention at any time in the case of acute myocardial ischemia."

CD008201,0,16635441,0,The action of dipyridamole to prevent thrombosis: practical implications for the treatment and prevention of stroke.,"Aggrenox (Boehringer Ingelheim, Ingelheim, Germany), a novel combination of low-dose aspirin with dipyridamole, represents a safe and promising combination alternative for mild but sustained platelet inhibition, and reduction of both arterial and venous thrombi occurrences. In a large, well-controlled randomized trial (ESPS-2 ) evaluating antiplatelet agents for stroke prevention, Aggrenox was twice as effective as monotherapy with either aspirin or dipyridamole. There is an increasing body of evidence that a delicate strategy with Aggrenox provides modest inhibition of platelet activity, especially in a chronic, long-term setting. Mild platelet inhibition beyond conventional aggregation may represent a substantial advantage over aggressive antiplatelet regimens for the treatment, and especially for secondary prevention, of cerebrovascular ischemic events. Although there is no doubt that the concept of inhibiting platelets is vital for the treatment of vascular ischemic disease in general and ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA) in particular, the optimal degree of such inhibition still remains an unsolved mystery. It seems that the concepts of ""the more, the better"" and ""one size fits all"" may no longer be valid for ideal antiplatelet protection in such high-risk populations. Without routine individual laboratory assessment of platelet function, mild regimens have the advantage of being more suitable for the majority of patients and will contribute substantially to the success of dipyridamole. Conversely, if we can determine baseline platelet status and intelligently apply therapy based on platelet activity in each particular patient, clinical outcomes may be better. Avoiding excessive bleeding risks after aggressive strategies in patients with normal or already decreased platelet function, but targeting those who exhibit activated platelets, may improve risk stratification and save lives. Therefore, Aggrenox should be considered a drug of choice to prevent the second stroke. Eliminating, or at least minimizing, the most frequent side effect, namely transitory headaches at the beginning of therapy with Aggrenox, will benefit patients and increase the use of this agent. Should the PRoFESS (Prevention Regimen For Effectively avoiding Second Strokes) trial show an advantage in event reduction with Aggrenox over clopidogrel, the increase will be especially dramatic. In short, based on current evidence most guidelines include Aggrenox as a first-line option for secondary prevention of ischemic stroke or TIA, and some recent versions suggest it may be preferable in other clinical scenarios."

Sixty subjects (28 male, 32 female aged 64 +/- 6 years) were included in the study of which 30 suffered from coronary heart disease and 30 from cerebral vascular disease; the first group was subdivided into those subjects with quiescent preinfarction angina (21 cases) and those with acute myocardial infarction (9 cases), whereas the second group was subdivided into subjects with cerebral stroke (20 cases) and those with TIA (10 cases). Each subject underwent an assay to assess fasting blood levels of fibrinogen, factor VII, antithrombin III (using a chromogenic method), plasminogen tissue activator, beta-thromboglobulin and dimer-D (ELISA method) 24 hours after being admitted to hospital. From an analysis of results it was observed that of the four prothrombotic markers used, fibrinogen and factor VII showed a generic increase in comparison to coronary heart disease and cerebrovascular disease patients; this was paralleled by significant reduction of antithrombin III; differences were even more marked and significant in acute thrombo-occlusive (infarction, stroke) compared to functional forms (angina, TIA). In line with other studies, the Authors favour an irritative type endothelial response leading to a marked and surprising increase of tPA. The two prothrombotic markers (BTG, D-D) also showed a thrombotic development in the two groups of patients examined with more significant findings in the occlusive forms (infarction, stroke) in comparison to transitory forms. On the basis of these and other published results the Authors confirm the usefulness of monitoring prothrombotic markers (fibrinogen, factor VII, AT III) in apparently normal subjects with or without risk factors or with slight initial signs of arteriosclerotic disease; these call for longitudinal or cross-sectional studies of an epidemiology type, in addition to isolated assay for a generic assessment of the patient's biological status, even if it is not yet possible to elaborate a protocol for the certain and specific diagnosis of a thrombophilic condition. The value of prethrombotic markers is apparent in the acute occlusive stage of the disease as a form of prognostic and therapeutic monitoring, and in preinfarction and above all silent transitory forms where, together with the use of other techniques (Holter), it provides interesting openings for confirming the diagnosis of an in vivo microthrombotic genesis and the consequent introduction of antithrombotic drug therapy."

CD008201,0,24665264,0,Predictors of venous thromboembolic events associated with central venous port insertion in cancer patients.,"Insertion of central venous port (CVP) catheter in the cancer population is associated with increased incidence of venous thromboembolic events (VTE). However, trials have shown limited benefit of antithrombotic treatment to prevent catheter-related venous thrombosis. This prospective observational cohort study was designed to assess the incidence of VTE closely related to CVP implantation in patients with cancer and undergoing chemotherapy, and to identify a high risk subgroup of patients. Between February 2006 and December 2011, 1097 consecutive cancer patients with first CVP implantation were included. Catheter-related VTE were defined as deep venous thrombosis in the arm, with or without pulmonary embolism (PE), or isolated PE. The incidence of CVP-associated VTE was 5.9% (IC95 4.4-7.3%) at 3 months, and 11.3% (IC95 9.4-13.2%) at 12 months. The incidence of any VTE was 7.6% (IC95 6.0-9.3%) at 3 months, and 15.3% (IC95 13.1-17.6%) at 12 months. High Khorana risk score and lung cancer were significant predictors of 3 month VTE. In conclusion, this large cohort study of patients with first CVP catheter implantation confirms the high incidence of VTE associated with the CVP implantation and allow identifying high risk patients who may benefit from thromboprophylaxis."

CD008201,0,24893765,0,Dental implants in patients at high risk for infective endocarditis: a preliminary study.,"The safety of dental implant placement in patients at high risk for infective endocarditis (IE) has never been shown. The outcome of osseointegrated implants in patients with artificial heart valves or with a history of an infected valve is not known. In this article we describe our experience of dental implant placement in patients at high risk for IE. A retrospective study was conducted on patients at high risk for IE who underwent dental implant placement. All the patients received prophylactic antibiotic treatment before the surgical procedure, in accordance with the relevant American Heart Association guidelines. A total 13 patients underwent 16 surgical procedures for the placement of 57 dental implants over a period of 17 years. Within the follow-up period, no case of IE was reported. Two implants failed before exposure in one patient, one patient suffered from mitral valve thrombosis 14 days after the dental procedure, and another patient suffered a stroke 6 months following treatment. Despite the limitation of the small group of patients and the known low incidence of IE, dental implants may be regarded as a legitimate procedure for patients at high risk for IE."
CD008201,0,12661774,0,Use of the low-molecular-weight heparin nadroparin during pregnancy. A review.,"Antithrombotic therapy is often used during pregnancy for the treatment and prevention of venous thromboembolism, the prevention of systemic embolism in patients with heart valve prostheses and the prevention of foetal loss in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome. Low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs), including nadroparin, have largely replaced unfractionated heparin as the anticoagulant of choice. The use of the LMWH nadroparin in pregnant women at an increased risk of thromboembolism or foetal loss is discussed in this review. Deep vein thrombosis can be effectively treated or prevented with nadroparin without any serious adverse events. Nadroparin 0.1 ml/10 kg s.c. once daily prevents thromboembolic complications in pregnant women with heart valve prostheses. Nadroparin is also effective in preventing foetal loss, through contributing to normal placental development and in decreasing the risk of premature delivery in pregnant women with antiphospholipid syndrome or women with herpes and antiphospholipid syndrome. These results demonstrate nadroparin is effective, easy to administer and associated with a low incidence of foetal and maternal complications. The use of nadroparin at a prophylactic dose of 0.3 ml (2850 IU AXa, 95 IU/kg) (for high-risk patients, 0.3-0.6 ml) s.c. once daily, and a therapeutic dose of 0.1 ml/10 kg (95 IU/kg) s.c. twice daily, is in line with the latest international guidelines of the American College of Chest Physicans."

CD008201,0,26219456,0,The Saudi Clinical Practice Guideline for the treatment of venous thromboembolism. Outpatient versus inpatient management.,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) is commonly encountered in daily clinical practice. After diagnosis, its management frequently carries significant challenges to the clinical practitioner. Treatment of VTE with the inappropriate modality and/or in the inappropriate setting may lead to serious complications and have life-threatening consequences. As a result of an initiative of the Ministry of Health of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, an expert panel led by the Saudi Association for Venous Thrombo-Embolism (a subsidiary of the Saudi Thoracic Society) and the Saudi Scientific Hematology Society with the methodological support of the McMaster University Guideline working group, this clinical practice guideline was produced to assist health care providers in VTE management. Two questions were identified and were related to the inpatient versus outpatient treatment of acute DVT, and the early versus standard discharge from hospital for patients with acute PE. The corresponding recommendations were made following the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach."
CD008201,0,21720971,0,A nation-wide initiative against venous thromboembolism.,"There is a gap between knowledge and recommendations regarding venous thromboembolism (VTE) on the one hand and daily practice on the other. This fact has prompted a Swiss multidisciplinary group consisting of angiologists, haematologists, internists, and emergency medicine and pharmaceutical medicine specialists interested in VTE, the SAMEX group, to set up a series of surveys and studies that give useful insight into the situation in our country. Their projects encompassed prophylactic and therapeutic aspects of VTE, and enrolled over 7000 patients from five academic and 45 non-academic acute care hospitals and fifty-three private practices in Switzerland. This comprehensive Swiss Clinical Study Programme forms the largest database surveying current clinical patterns of VTE management in a representative sample of the Swiss patient population. Overall the programme shows a lack of thromboprophylaxis use in hospitalised at-risk medical patients, particularly in those with cancer, acute heart or respiratory failure and the elderly, as well as under-prescription of extended prophylaxis beyond hospital discharge in patients undergoing major cancer surgery. In regard to VTE treatment, planning of anticoagulation duration, administration of LMWH for cancer-associated thrombosis, and the use of compression therapy for prevention of post-thrombotic syndrome in patients with symptomatic proximal DVT require improvement. In conclusion, this programme highlights insufficient awareness of venous thromboembolic disease in Switzerland, underestimation of its burden and inconsistent application of international consensus statement guidelines regarding prophylaxis and treatment adopted by the Swiss Expert Group."

We characterized coagulation profiles and evaluate the incidence of TEE associated with the combination therapy of bortezomib-thalidomide-dexamethasone (VTD) in Chinese patients with newly diagnosed MM. The results indicated that the platelet count and platelet aggregation induced by the agonists were decreased after a short exposure to bortezomib in vivo. The incidence of TEE was low in VTD therapy for an overall rate of 3%. We do not recommend routine thromboprophylaxis for VTD therapy in Chinese patients with MM."

CD008201,0,14762856,0,Effect of sirolimus on infection incidence in liver transplant recipients.,"Sirolimus is a new immunosuppressive agent that lacks the nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity associated with calcineurin inhibitors. The addition of sirolimus to immunosuppressive protocols may thus allow sparing of calcineurin inhibitors and reduction or elimination of associated toxicities. Between January 2000 and July 2001, sirolimus was administered to 55 of 116 consecutive liver recipients. The remaining 61 patients served as the comparison group in the retrospective analysis. In the sirolimus group, perioperative steroids were reduced, and calcineurin inhibitor initiation was delayed. All infectious episodes that occurred within 60 days of liver transplantation were evaluated but were limited to 1 per patient for statistical analysis of sepsis. Demographic variables were comparable between groups. Patients receiving sirolimus experienced more infection (47.2% vs. 18.03%, P<0.001), and this effect persisted across high and low dosage ranges and sirolimus levels. A trend toward increased length of stay was noted (P=0.07). No difference between groups was found in acute rejection rates (17.5% vs. 22.5%), 1-year graft (81% vs. 89%), patient survival (86% vs. 89%), or hepatic artery thrombosis. In conclusion, despite reduction of other immunosuppressants, patients receiving even low doses of sirolimus experienced increased sepsis rates. This agent may have greater usefulness for patients with threatened renal function or patients with chronic rejection after wound healing has occurred."
CD008201,0,21359016,0,Optional inferior vena cava filters in the trauma patient.,"Trauma patients are at exceedingly high risk of development of venous thromboembolism (VTE) including deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism (PE). The epidemiology of VTE in trauma patients is reviewed. PE is thought to be the third major cause of death after trauma in those patients who survive longer than 24 hours after onset of injury. In fact, patients recovering from trauma have the highest rate of VTE among all subgroups of hospitalized patients. Various prophylactic and surveillance methods have been evaluated and found helpful in certain situations, but VTE complications can occur despite such measures. Therapeutic and prophylactic uses of inferior vena cava (IVC) filters in trauma patients are reviewed. Prophylactic IVC filter use is revealed to be a controversial subject with valid arguments on both sides of the issue. With the lack of prospective randomized trials of IVC filter use in trauma, it is impossible to make evidence-based recommendations. Unfortunately, two sets of guidelines are available for insertion of filters in trauma patients, with conflicting recommendations. The introduction of retrievable IVC filters seems to offer a unique solution for VTE protection in the trauma patient population, which often consists of younger members of our population. Lastly, current generations of FDA-approved retrieval filters are discussed."
CD008201,0,20936495,0,Prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism: guidelines translated for the clinician.,"Venous thromboembolism is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide and most often affects hospitalized postoperative surgical and medical patients. Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis undoubtedly improves the care of these patients, as demonstrated by the current literature and guidelines. Failure to prescribe prophylaxis when indicated, however, remains a vital health care concern. The American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) published their most recent guidelines regarding venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in 2008. In this review, we aim to summarize the most recent ACCP prophylaxis guidelines with practical application and interpretation for the practicing physician. Here we present the most practical information from these guidelines and summarize essential recommendations in key tables. We will briefly review the grading system used in the guidelines for the level of evidence and the strength of the recommendation. We will then discuss the recommendations for prophylaxis in the various patient populations described in these guidelines including general and orthopedic surgery, gynecologic surgery, urologic surgery, thoracic surgery, neurosurgery, trauma, medical conditions, cancer patients, and critical care. In addition, we will discuss recent clinical trials regarding novel anticoagulants for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis and share some conclusions."
CD008201,0,18926774,0,Vascular access for daunorubicin during childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia induction treatment: a UKCCSG supportive care group and MRC childhood leukaemia working party survey.,"Daunorubicin was reintroduced into induction chemotherapy in UK protocols for intermediate- and high-risk childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in 1999. Concern about the risk of central venous catheter-associated venous thromboembolism led to a recommendation that induction treatment should be given by peripheral venous access wherever possible, whilst recognising anxieties concerning the risk of daunorubicin extravasation. A survey performed to determine how these conflicting concerns influenced practice in the administration of daunorubicin revealed considerable variation. The results highlight that recommendations were not being followed and that local practice and guidance were being utilised in this area of practice. However, there is a need to identify patients at higher risk of venous thromboembolism during induction treatment and better strategies to prevent this complication."

CD008201,0,1868405,0,Prevention and management of medical complications of the hospitalized elderly stroke patient.,"Medical complications may account for 30% or more of the deaths resulting from acute ischemic stroke in the elderly. In descending order of frequency, the most deadly complications are bacterial pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, and sepsis without pneumonia (often in the setting of a urinary tract infection or a necrotic decubitus). Normal aging is associated with declining pulmonary and cardiovascular functions as well as declining immunocompetence and physical barriers to infection. The neurological effects of acute ischemic brain injury compound these susceptibilities. Accordingly, a high degree of vigilance is emphasized in the diagnostic and therapeutic guidelines provided for care of the lungs, the heart, the urinary tract, and the skin. Guidelines are also provided for management of blood pressure during the first hours and days following stroke onset. Treatment should be withheld unless specific medical indications are identified. When antihypertensive agents are administered, the appropriate dose may be lower than usually recommended (e.g. labetalol) in order to minimize abrupt drops in blood pressure that may result in further injury to potentially viable ischemic brain tissue."
CD008201,0,19536986,0,Laparoscopic biliopancreatic diversion: our preliminary experience with 201 consecutive cases.,"Surgery as a treatment modality for morbid obesity has shown impressive progress over the past decades because of a better understanding of the metabolic characteristics of obesity and the rationale for its surgical treatment. Biliopancreatic diversion was first performed in humans in 1976. Since then it has been an excellent operation for morbid obesity to achieve long-term weight reduction. We present our laparoscopic biliopancreatic diversion protocol, with or without distal gastrectomy (Resa's operation). From 1995 to October 2008 we operated on 201 patients; open biliopancreatic diversion was performed in 48 patients, while the remaining patients underwent laparoscopic biliopancreatic diversion (84 laparoscopic Scopinaro's operations, 69 laparoscopic Resa's operations). The mean operating time was 140 minutes for the open procedures, 180 minutes for Scopinaro's laparoscopic operation and 135 minutes for Resa's laparoscopic operation. The mean postoperative stay was 5.5 days. Our mortality rate consisted of two patients (0.99%) who had pulmonary embolisms. Other major complications were three cases of leakage from the jejuno-ileal anastomosis, 18 cases of incisional hernia, 6 cases of metabolic diseases; 1 case of acute hepatitis and 1 case of bronchopneumonia. Biliopancreatic diversion can be performed satisfactorily by laparoscopy. A factor that may reduce the technical difficulties and make the technique totally reversible is the gastric sparing. Thus an upper digestive endoscopy can determine preoperatively whether the patient will need a gastrectomy, depending on its results."

CD008201,0,16122549,0,Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in medical patients: future perspectives.,"Venous thromboembolism is a common potentially life-threatening complication in acutely ill medical patients. Actually, over 70% fatal episodes of pulmonary embolism during hospitalization occur in non-surgical patients. In the absence of thromboprophylaxis, the incidence of venographically detected deep vein thrombosis is about 15% in medical patients and several trials and meta-analyses have clearly demonstrated the prophylactic role of unfractioned heparin and low-molecular-weight heparins. Although over the last years the knowledge of epidemiology, clinical features and prophylaxis in medical patients has significantly improved, there are still several relevant issues to investigate thoroughly. Scarce data are available on a simple way to stratify patients in order to identify those who should undergo prophylaxis and several studies clearly show that thromboprophylaxis in medical conditions is underused. Moreover, in comparison to surgical settings, very few randomized clinical trials on the efficacy of pharmacologic prophylaxis have been performed and no data at all have been published concerning mechanical prophylaxis in medical conditions. According to previous studies and results of very recently published trials, new data are available to tailor low molecular weight heparin optimal dose, whereas the optimal duration of prophylaxis in medical patients is still a matter of debate. Moreover, the possible role of the new antithrombotic drugs in the venous thromboembolism prevention in medical conditions and the optimal management of thromboprophylaxis in patients with ischaemic stroke have not been fully investigated. Although new evidence represents a significant improvement both in stratification of VTE risk and in decisions about the appropriate type and duration of prophylactic strategies in medical patients, additional data are still needed."
CD008201,0,16474787,0,Therapy Insight: management of urology patients taking long-term warfarin anticoagulation therapy.,"Chronic warfarin anticoagulation is commonly used to prevent thromboembolism in patients with atrial fibrillation or venous thromboembolism, and in the management of patients with mechanical heart valves. Interruption of long-term anticoagulation therapy for elective, planned urologic procedures in these patients creates a complex situation in which competing risks of thrombosis and hemorrhage must be managed; when anticoagulation is withheld patients are at risk of thrombosis, and when it is restarted they are at risk of hemorrhage. Patients at a high risk of thrombosis are typically given bridging therapy with heparin to reduce the amount of time without anticoagulation. Outcomes from bridging therapy are influenced by patient characteristics, including the risk of thromboembolism from underlying medical conditions and the risk of perioperative bleeding, and by characteristics of the procedures themselves. The safety and efficacy of different approaches are not well documented. Data regarding periprocedural anticoagulation management of urology patients is limited and principally describes outcomes related to transurethral prostate surgery. Results from these studies indicate that various strategies of anticoagulation interruption and bridging therapy result in low frequencies of thromboembolism, but variable rates of hemorrhage. Patients on anticoagulation therapy who are due to undergo invasive urologic procedures that have a low risk of developing thromboembolism can discontinue warfarin 4-5 days before the procedure, and resume it postprocedure. Bridging therapy to prevent thrombosis is necessary for patients at a higher risk of developing thromboembolism. Future research should develop strategies to maintain low rates of thrombosis but reduce the frequency of postoperative hemorrhage."
CD008201,0,18980473,0,"Cardiovascular complications after acute spinal cord injury: pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management.","Cardiovascular complications in the acute stage following traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) require prompt medical attention to avoid neurological compromise, morbidity, and death. In this review, the authors summarize the neural regulation of the cardiovascular system as well as the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of major cardiovascular complications that can occur following acute (up to 30 days) traumatic SCI. Hypotension (both supine and orthostatic), autonomic dysreflexia, and cardiac arrhythmias (including persistent bradycardia) are attributed to the loss of supraspinal control of the sympathetic nervous system that commonly occurs in patients with severe spinal cord lesions at T-6 or higher. Current evidence-based guidelines recommend: 1) monitoring of cardiac and hemodynamic parameters in the acute phase of SCI; 2) maintenance of a minimum mean arterial blood pressure of 85 mm Hg during the hyperacute phase (1 week after SCI); 3) timely detection and appropriate treatment of neurogenic shock and cardiac arrhythmias; and 4) immediate and adequate treatment of episodes of acute autonomic dysreflexia. In addition to these forms of cardiovascular dysfunction, individuals with acute SCIs are at high risk for deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism due to loss of mobility and, potentially, altered fibrinolytic activity, abnormal platelet function, and impaired circadian variations of hemostatic and fibrinolytic parameters. Current evidence supports a recommendation for thromboprophylaxis using mechanical methods and anticoagulants during the acute stage up to 3 months following SCI, depending on the severity and level of injury. Low-molecular-weight heparin is the first choice for anticoagulant prophylaxis in patients with acute SCI. Although there is insufficient evidence to recommend (or refute) the use of screening tests for DVT in asymptomatic adults with acute SCI, this strategy may detect asymptomatic DVT in at least 9.4% of individuals who undergo thromboprophylaxis using lowmolecular- weight heparin. Indications and treatment of DVT and acute pulmonary embolism are well established and are summarized in this review. Recognition of cardiovascular complications after acute SCI is essential to minimize adverse outcomes and to optimize recovery."
CD008201,0,19795190,0,Are surgical patients at risk of venous thromboembolism currently meeting the Surgical Care Improvement Project performance measure for appropriate and timely prophylaxis?,"The US Surgical Care Improvement Project (SCIP) has approved two performance measures to improve venous thromboembolism (VTE) prevention. SCIP-VTE-2 measures the proportion of surgery patients who received appropriate VTE prophylaxis within 24 h prior to surgery to 24 h after surgery. This study assesses the current rate of achievement of SCIP-VTE-2 criteria using a retrospective data set of real-world surgical patients. The Premier Perspective database, which contains real-world data from >400 US hospitals, was queried (January 2004-December 2006) for in-patient hospital transactional billing records of surgical patients aged >or=18 years. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients achieving SCIP-VTE-2 requirements for appropriate and timely prophylaxis as per the SCIP-VTE-2 algorithm. Of the 149,785 patients included, 56.2% received appropriate prophylaxis and 52.7% achieved the SCIP-VTE-2 performance measure for both appropriate and timely prophylaxis. To conclude, this study highlights that VTE prophylaxis currently only meets SCIP-VTE-2 requirements in approximately half of real-world surgical patients. The use of retrospective analyses such as this hospital billing data analysis may assist hospitals in measuring their current and future performance in VTE prevention."

During a two year period 616 patients were operated, 47 patients had to be excluded, 107 patients did not receive HDHE desired by the surgeon; 462 patients received HDHE as described in the protocol. Because the distribution of age, sex, duration of hospitalisation of the 107 patients without HDHE is the same as in the HDHE group, this group can be used as control group. Increased intraoperative bleeding--written down in the operation report--66 patients (14.3%) in HDHE group and 6 patients (5.6%) in the control group. There is no statistic significance between the both groups in superficial and deep wound hematomas, deep vein thromboses or pulmonary embolism. In the HDHE group two death appears. Both patients [a 37 year old, asymptomatic woman and a 65 year old man with mild ischemic symptoms 11 months prior to operation] died because of an acute myocardial infarction. The clinical course and the missing of stenosis or occlusion at autopsy let us think at the possibility of coronary arterial spasm, presumably caused by DHE, as the cause of myocardial infarction.

We have investigated the recent incidence data of perioperative pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) in Japan and have established guidelines for the prevention of VTE. Recommended thromboprophylaxis is early ambulation for low risk group, elastic stocking (ES) or intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) for moderate risk group, IPC or low dose unfractionated heparin (LDUH) for high risk group, and LDUH + IPC or LDUH + ES for highest risk group. The management fee for PTE prophylaxis was established and covered by health insurance in April 2004. Surprisingly, the incidence of perioperative PTE decreased just after this guideline was issued. After accumulation of further evidence and application of pharmacological agents, such as low molecular weight heparin, we will establish the advanced guidelines in the future."

CD008201,0,23774158,0,Safety of prophylactic anticoagulation at a pediatric hospital.,"The importance of preventing venous thromboembolism (VTE) in hospitalized adults is well recognized. We recently developed and published our institutional guidelines for the prevention of VTE in high-risk hospitalized patients in a pediatric hospital. The objective of this prospective observational study was to evaluate the safety of anticoagulation after these guidelines were instituted. The primary outcome was major bleeding and secondary outcomes included minor bleeding and VTE. Eighty-nine patients were enrolled, with a mean age of 16.6 years. The most common risk factors for VTE were impaired mobility, lower extremity orthopedic surgery, and obesity. The majority of patients (63%) had 3 or more risk factors. There were 2 major bleeding events, and minor bleeding occurred in 5 patients, all in patients who had undergone major orthopedic surgery. Therefore the risk of major bleeding in orthopedic surgery patients was 4% (2/51), and 0% (0/38) in the remaining patients. No patient developed a non-catheter-related VTE, which was the primary intent of our guidelines. Although there remains much work to be done to optimize VTE strategies in pediatric patients, this study provides information regarding the risks of VTE prophylaxis using a pragmatic approach in hospitalized patients with multiple risk factors for VTE. More studies are needed to better define the risk:benefit ratio in this population."

Arterial and venous thromboembolic complications are reported during ART with an incidence of 0.1%. The development of these events has been mainly ascribed to the presence of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). Precise mechanisms by which OHSS and exogenous hormonal stimulation used in ART induce thromboembolic events remain unclear. However, vascular endothelial growth factor secreted during OHSS, high estradiol concentrations, and blood hyperviscosity play a major role in inducing a prothrombotic state. Therefore, before planning an ART, individual thromboembolic risk should be assessed and thromboprophylaxis offered to high risk patients. Prophylaxis should be initiated in women who develop moderate-to-severe OHSS."

CD008201,0,22335314,0,Acute respiratory distress syndrome: diagnosis and management.,"Acute respiratory distress syndrome manifests as rapidly progressive dyspnea, tachypnea, and hypoxemia. Diagnostic criteria include acute onset, profound hypoxemia, bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, and the absence of left atrial hypertension. Acute respiratory distress syndrome is believed to occur when a pulmonary or extrapulmonary insult causes the release of inflammatory mediators, promoting neutrophil accumulation in the microcirculation of the lung. Neutrophils damage the vascular endothelium and alveolar epithelium, leading to pulmonary edema, hyaline membrane formation, decreased lung compliance, and difficult air exchange. Most cases of acute respiratory distress syndrome are associated with pneumonia or sepsis. It is estimated that 7.1 percent of all patients admitted to an intensive care unit and 16.1 percent of all patients on mechanical ventilation develop acute lung injury or acute respiratory distress syndrome. In-hospital mortality related to these conditions is between 34 and 55 percent, and most deaths are due to multiorgan failure. Acute respiratory distress syndrome often has to be differentiated from congestive heart failure, which usually has signs of fluid overload, and from pneumonia. Treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome is supportive and includes mechanical ventilation, prophylaxis for stress ulcers and venous thromboembolism, nutritional support, and treatment of the underlying injury. Low tidal volume, high positive end-expiratory pressure, and conservative fluid therapy may improve outcomes. A spontaneous breathing trial is indicated as the patient improves and the underlying illness resolves. Patients who survive acute respiratory distress syndrome are at risk of diminished functional capacity, mental illness, and decreased quality of life; ongoing care by a primary care physician is beneficial for these patients."

CD008201,0,23522921,0,Biomolecular markers of cancer-associated thromboembolism.,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE; deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism) is associated with a poor prognosis in most malignancies and is a major cause of death among cancer patients. Universal anticoagulation for primary thromboprophylaxis in the outpatient setting is precluded by potential bleeding complications, especially without sufficient evidence that all patients would benefit from such prophylaxis. Therefore, appropriately targeting cancer patients for thromboprophylaxis is key to reducing morbidity and perhaps mortality. Predictive biomarkers could aid in identifying patients at high risk for VTE. Possible biomarkers for VTE include C-reactive protein, platelet and leukocyte counts, D-dimer and prothrombin fragment 1+2, procoagulant factor VIII, tissue factor, and soluble P-selectin. Evidence is emerging to support the use of risk assessment models in selecting appropriate candidates for primary thromboprophylaxis in the cancer setting. Further studies are needed to optimize these models and determine utility in reducing morbidity and mortality from cancer-associated thromboembolism."
CD008201,0,21956636,0,"Athrombogenic coating of long-term venous catheter for cancer patients: a prospective, randomised, double-blind trial.","Cancer patients with long-term venous catheter are at risk for thromboembolic complications at the catheter tip and in the adjacent venous vessels. We assessed whether local thrombogenicity could be prevented with an experimental coated (with athrombogenic layer) catheter device (CD) compared to an uncoated CD. Patients requiring a long-term venous catheter were randomly allocated to receive either a standard uncoated or experimental coated (with athrombogenic Camouflage® layer) CD. The athrombogenic layer creates a barrier against non-specific adsorption of plasma proteins. The primary endpoint was urokinase injection in cases of an unsuccessful blood aspiration from the CD. Secondary endpoints included early (haematoma, pneumothorax) and late (venous thrombosis, infection) catheter-associated complications and catheter defects. One hundred and seventy-nine patients were randomly assigned to a CD (experimental n = 89/standard n = 90). One hundred and ten (62%) patients with a total of 1,286 catheter taps were analysed for the primary endpoint. Necessity for urokinase injection was 8/680 (1.2% experimental) vs. 33/606 (5.4% standard) per catheter tap and 4/55 (7.3% experimental) vs. 18/55 (32.7% standard) per patient. A repeated measures logistic regression to assess the effect of coating yielded an odds ratio of 3.5 (95% confidence interval, 1.2-10.4; p = 0.03) for the primary endpoint. All patients allocated per protocol were analysed for the secondary endpoints. Nine (5.4%) local thrombotic complications, seven (4.1%) catheter infections, and no catheter defect were observed. Athrombogenic coating of CD in cancer patients resulted in a significant reduced necessity for urokinase injections and subsequently less inconvenience for patients and fewer costly interventions."
CD008201,0,10725989,0,Acquired APC resistance in neurosurgical patients may not be a risk factor for postoperative deep vein thrombosis.,"Acquired resistance to activated protein C has been reported during oral contraception and pregnancy. Its thrombogenic potential was studied in 41 neurosurgical patients who were enrolled in the placebo group of a thromboprophylaxis trial. Normalized activated protein C sensitivity ratio (nAPC-SR), clotting activity of factors V and VIII, and levels of protein C antigen were measured prior to and at days 3 and 7 after surgery. Bilateral venography was done in all patients at days 8-10 to demonstrate deep vein thrombosis. A lowered nAPC-SR was found in 76% (baseline), 80% (day 3), and 88% (day 7) of patients. It was inversely related to factor VIII clotting activity (p = .0003) and protein C antigen, (p = .02). Deep vein thrombosis was demonstrated in 30% of patients with a normal nAPC-SR and in 23% of patients with a lowered nAPC-SR. Pulmonary embolism was not observed. Multivariate analysis did not identify a lowered nAPC-SR as a thrombotic risk factor, in contrast with gender (women, p = .02) and Quetelet index (> or = 25 kg/m2, p = .006). Our data provide no evidence that acquired activated protein C resistance, frequently found in neurosurgical patients, contributes to their high risk of postoperative deep vein thrombosis."

We conducted this prospective observational study to identify the prevalence of VTE among patients undergoing TKA by using computed tomographic pulmonary angiography in combination with bilateral lower limb venography. We enrolled consecutive patients admitted to our institution for primary unilateral TKA from September 2013 to July 2014. All participants underwent a standard surgical procedure of TKA. Computed tomographic pulmonary angiography and bilateral lower limb venography were performed within a week after the operation. We compared age, sex, BMI, comorbidities, data of laboratory tests, operation time and thromboprophylaxis between VTE group and non-VTE group to identify the risk factors. A total of 109 patients were enrolled in this study. The incidence of symptomatic DVT, asymptomatic DVT, symptomatic pulmonary embolism and asymptomatic pulmonary embolism following TKA was 4.6, 18.3, 1.8 and 1.8%, respectively. Elevated level of D-dimer was significantly associated with postoperative VTE. The incidence of VTE following TKA was high despite thromboprophylaxis, and asymptomatic DVTs accounted for a large proportion of thrombotic events."

From 2010-2011, INR levels on discharge, complications and readmissions within 30 days were recorded on 441 patients undergoing joint arthroplasty. Eighty percent (352 of 441) patients had a subtherapeutic INR level at discharge. The overall complication rate was 15% with an 8.6% readmission rate. A supratherapeutic INR level at discharge was associated with both higher readmission rate as well as increased number of complications (P<0.048). Most patients taking warfarin are nontherapeutic at the time of discharge; notably, a supratherapeutic INR places patients at risk for increased complications and readmissions rates following surgery."

CD008201,0,16805758,0,Statins and the acute coronary syndrome: 'the early bird catches the worm'.,"The early period following an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is characterised by atherosclerotic plaque destabilisation and a pro-coagulant state, and is when patients are at highest risk for recurrent cardiovascular events and mortality. Statins decrease thrombus formation and increase fibrinolysis, inhibit platelet reactivity and aggregation, improve endothelial function in patients with coronary artery disease and have a major role in plaque stabilisation. Several studies showed that initiation of early statin therapy in these settings may have beneficial effects. This review summarises the current data on statins in the setting of ACSs. Known and other possible mechanisms of action are described. The pathophysiological mechanisms, histological features and biochemical characteristics of ACS are different than those with stable coronary disease, thereby suggesting that the mechanisms whereby statins exert their benefits in ACS may be distinct from those for stable CHD. Initiation of the therapy during hospitalisation rather than at the time of hospital discharge may provide protection against early recurrent cardiovascular events and also improve patients' compliance."
CD008201,0,26734384,0,Improving VTE risk assessment at point of admission to a tertiary centre cardiology ward.,"Cardiology wards are generally high turnover units, which may receive primary PCI, high-risk NSTEMI patients, and other general cardiac admissions from a large geographical area. Many centres also provide national specialist services for rarer cardiac conditions for which admissions may be lengthy. Cardiac patients have significant risk factors for venous thromboembolism (VTE) as immobility may be due to systolic dysfunction, attachment to continuous monitoring and predisposition to chest pain, or cardiac syncope. It is recommended by NICE that an initial VTE risk assessment is undertaken at the time of patient admission, with reassessment within 24 hours. For this purpose a risk assessment tool is featured on the front of many Trust drug charts. It is noted that this risk assessment is electronic in other trusts. We undertook an audit into the drug chart documentation of VTE risk assessment on the cardiology ward and the Coronary Care Unit (CCU) at The Royal Free Hospital. It was evident that documentation of VTE risk assessment was poor. The audit interventions were; a teaching presentation to the cardiology department, an educational poster, several update emails to the department and the identification of a 'VTE risk assessment champion' to audit ongoing compliance. Following these measures the second audit round demonstrated that documentation of initial risk assessment was slightly improved, but significant improvement was seen in documentation of risk assessment at 24 hours post admission. Results from a third audit cycle indicated that the improvement in initial VTE risk assessment was sustained, and that there was a significant sustained improvement in risk assessment at 24 hours (p <0.05). Recommendations for sustained improvement included: redesigning the drug chart so that the VTE risk assessment tool was linked to the VTE prophylaxis prescription box, and designating the responsibility of the initial VTE risk assessment to the on call junior doctor who receives admissions on to the ward."

CD008201,0,14613021,0,A review of selective estrogen receptor modulators and national surgical adjuvant breast and bowel project clinical trials.,"Over the last 20 years tamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor modulator, has been shown to be of clinical benefit to patients with advanced and resected hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. Tamoxifen has also been evaluated as a risk-reducing agent among patients at a high risk for the development of breast cancer and found to be effective, although it is associated with untoward adverse events (ie, stroke, venous thrombosis, and endometrial cancer). Recent analysis of National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project tamoxifen trials confirms that an increased risk for developing various endometrial malignancies exists across these protocols. Raloxifene, a selective estrogen receptor modulator available to treat osteoporosis, may also reduce the risk for developing breast cancer. The National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project is now comparing the risk-reducing activities of tamoxifen and raloxifene in women considered to be at a high risk for developing breast cancer. As newer potential risk-reducing agents are identified and placed into clinical prevention trials, patient selection, trial implementation methods, and accrual strategies must be developed to insure both that appropriate accrual targets are achieved and that women at clinically significant risk levels are accrued."

CD008201,0,19588301,0,Thromboprophylaxis--key points for the angiologist.,"The expertise and the advice of vascular specialists are important in diagnosis and treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and equally important for thromboprophylaxis. Thus, vascular specialists are expected to have significant knowledge of the exposing and disposing risk factors for VTE. They are also expected to be familiar with the risk groups for VTE and the appropriate measures for thromboprophylaxis. Because different pharmacological prophylactic strategies are available, angiologists must be familiar with the properties, the specific labeling and the product information regarding their drugs of choice. Being familiar with the pharmacological profile and the potential risk of impaired renal function due to drug accumulation is essential for angiologists, both for the treatment and prophylaxis of VTE. Appropriate time intervals between application of thromboprophylaxis and spinal or epidural anaesthesia should be observed. This is also important for the recently available oral thrombin- and factor Xa-inhibitors. Presently available data do not support routine pharmacological prophylaxis for patients in the low VTE-risk group. Rather, individual risk benefit assessment is required in these patients. Patients with moderate or high VTE risk should receive pharmacological thromboprophylaxis. There is clear evidence and recommendation for prolonged administration of thromboprophylaxis over a 4-week period in patients following major orthopaedic surgery, such as hip replacement, hip fracture and in cancer surgery patients. Pulmonary embolism (PE) remains the most common preventable cause of death among hospitalized patients. Therefore, angiologists have a central role in ensuring adequate and consistent implementation of thromboprophylaxis, which is the number one strategy to improve patient safety in hospitals."

CD008201,0,23878750,0,Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome as an etiology of obstructive uropathy.,"Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) is an iatrogenic complication of controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) protocols performed in women undergoing assisted reproductive technologies. Overstimulation of the ovaries results in the overproduction of vasoactive cytokines and mediators by the ovaries, thereby causing a generalized capillary leak and acute shift of protein-rich fluid from the intravascular compartment into the third space. This may lead to the development of ascites, pleural effusions, pericardial effusion, anasarca, intravascular volume depletion, hemoconcentration, oliguria, hypoalbuminemia and hypoproteinemia, electrolyte imbalances, acute renal failure, abdominal compartment syndrome, thromboembolic events, and adult respiratory distress syndrome. The only effective treatment available is prevention of the syndrome from developing by individualizing the stimulation protocol, especially in high-risk patients. Once the syndrome develops, the management is mainly supportive. Oliguria and some degree of acute renal failure commonly develop in patients with moderate to severe OHSS and are usually due to prerenal causes. Acute renal failure (ARF) secondary to obstructive uropathy is rare. Here we report a case of severe, life-threatening OHSS resulting in ARF secondary to obstructive uropathy."
CD008201,0,15966997,0,Citrate anticoagulation for single-needle hemodialysis: safety and efficacy.,"Single-needle hemodialysis can be the only option in some patients and requires full heparinization. The aim of our retrospective clinical study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of regional citrate anticoagulation for single-needle hemodialysis. Citrate anticoagulation was performed during 41 single-needle hemodialysis procedures in 24 patients at risk of bleeding, using 4% trisodium citrate, 1 M CaCl2 and calcium-free dialysate. Safety was assessed by the percentage of procedures that were terminated prematurely or changed to another modality due to citrate-related complications and by incidence of important hypocalcemia. Efficacy was evaluated by visually assessing clot formation in the circuit. Five per cent of the procedures were terminated prematurely. Important hypocalcemia was recorded in 34% of the procedures. Anticoagulation was suboptimal in 17% of the procedures, but none of the systems clotted. The median dialyzer assessment grade was excellent. The average protocol parameters were: blood flow 244 +/- 27 mL/min, starting rate of citrate 191 +/- 19 mL/h, starting rate of calcium 6.7 +/- 1.1 mL/h. In the first hour, ionized calcium decreased in 67% of the procedures by 0.08 +/- 0.05 mmol/L. During the entire procedure, ionized calcium decreased in 80% of the cases by 0.17 +/- 0.09 mmol/L. There was a significant, but small increase in sodium (135 +/- 4 vs 137 +/- 4 mmol/L) and no increase in bicarbonate. Citrate anticoagulation during single-needle hemodialysis, according to our protocol, is safe and effective. Close monitoring of ionized calcium is mandatory. The calcium infusion rate should frequently be increased to correct hypocalcemia. The increased starting rate of calcium should be evaluated."

CD008201,0,21359646,0,Extended-duration rivaroxaban thromboprophylaxis in acutely ill medical patients: MAGELLAN study protocol.,"Patients with acute medical illnesses are at increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Thromboprophylaxis is recommended in these patients but questions remain regarding the optimal duration of therapy. The aim of this study is to determine whether oral rivaroxaban is non-inferior to standard-duration (approximately 10 days) subcutaneous (s.c.) enoxaparin for the prevention of VTE in acutely ill medical patients, and whether extended-duration (approximately 5 weeks) rivaroxaban is superior to standard-duration enoxaparin. Patients aged 40 years or older and hospitalized for various acute medical illnesses with risk factors for VTE randomly receive either s.c. enoxaparin 40 mg once daily (od) for 10 ± 4 days or oral rivaroxaban 10 mg od for 35 ± 4 days. The primary efficacy outcomes are the composite of asymptomatic proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT), symptomatic DVT, symptomatic non-fatal pulmonary embolism (PE), and VTE-related death up to day 10 + 4 and up to day 35 + 4. The primary safety outcome is the composite of treatment-emergent major bleeding and clinically relevant non-major bleeding. As of July 2010, 8,101 patients from 52 countries have been randomized. These patients have a broad range of medical conditions: approximately one-third were diagnosed with acute heart failure, just under one-third were diagnosed with acute infectious disease, and just under one-quarter were diagnosed with acute respiratory insufficiency. MAGELLAN will determine the efficacy, safety, and pharmacological profile of oral rivaroxaban for the prevention of VTE in a diverse population of medically ill patients and the potential of extended-duration therapy to reduce incidence of VTE."
CD008201,0,18338482,0,Risk stratification and utilisation of thrombo-embolism prophylaxis in a medical-surgical ICU: a hospital-based study.,"To assess the risk for venous thrombo-embolism (VTE) and the utilisation of VTE prophylaxis in an open medical-surgical intensive care unit (ICU), patients were admitted and enrolled to the ICU at a multispecialty, tertiary care teaching hospital in Mumbai, for an observational study during a 3-month period. Risk factors for VTE and methods of VTE prophylaxis used were noted. Risk stratification was done, and the consultants attending the ICUs filled a questionnaire about VTE awareness, preferences and usage of VTE prophylaxis methods and reasons for not using thromboprophylaxis. Of 580 admissions, 488 were included in the study. As per the risk stratification, thromboprophylaxis was indicated in 466 (95%). The study group had an average VTE risk of 5.74, with a mean risk of 6.48 in medical patients and 5.0 in surgical patients. The most common risk factors in medical patients were bed rest >72 hours (56%), age >60 years (49.6%) and age 40-60 years (38.4%). Among surgical patients, the most common risk factors were major surgery (80.25%), central venous access (59.24%) and age 40-60 years (46.6%). Overall, VTE prophylaxis was used in 229 patients (47%), with 127 (55%) medical and 102 (45%) surgical patients. The most common methods of VTE prophylaxis used were elastic stockings (24.2%), low molecular weight heparin (15%) and low molecular weight heparin and stockings both (9.6%). Fear of bleeding was the commonest reason cited for the underutilisation of VTE prophylaxis. Almost half of all high-risk patients admitted to the ICU didn't receive any thromboprophylaxis. Consistent practice patterns of ICUs, and continuing medical education programmes addressing VTE prophylaxis will help improve the usage of VTE prophylaxis."
CD008201,0,1754886,0,Clinical assessment of venous thromboembolic risk in surgical patients.,"Prophylaxis against postoperative venous thromboembolism should be tailored according to the patient's level of risk. However, risk assessment is not yet in widespread use in surgical practice. In this study, 538 general surgical patients were prospectively assessed based on a scoring system containing 20 risk factors. Depending on the total risk factor score, the patients were grouped into low (0 to 1, 34.5%), moderate (2 to 4, 48.5%), or high risk (more than 4, 17.2%) categories. Statistically significant (p less than 0.0001) correlation was found between our results and those of three existing risk assessment systems. Overall, of the 538 patients, 37.2% received prophylaxis; 10%, 42.1%, and 76% received prophylaxis in the low-, moderate-, and high-risk categories, respectively. Mechanical prophylactic modalities (graduated elastic compression and sequential intermittent compression) were preferred over pharmacologic modalities. These results suggest that implementation of prophylaxis remains underutilized despite published reports, including NIH guidelines. Our results indicate that the majority of surgical patients seen in this suburban hospital have two or more risk factors for developing venous thromboembolism."

CD008201,0,25833178,0,Clinical significance of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants in the management of atrial fibrillation.,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most commonly observed rhythm disorder in clinical practice. It is associated with a high risk of thromboembolic stroke and increased cardiovascular mortality. Vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), the only oral anticoagulants used for thromboembolic prophylaxis in AF patients over the past 60 years, have been effective in reducing thromboembolic stroke, compared with placebo and aspirin, in this group of patients. However, VKAs have a very narrow therapeutic window, so regular monitoring of the therapeutic effect is obligatory for their use. The need for regular assessment of blood anticoagulation often causes dissatisfaction and reduces patients' quality of life. Non-VKA oral anticoagulants (NOACs), such as dabigatran, a direct thrombin inhibitor, and 3 factor Xa inhibitors, namely rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban, have been developed in recent years and have increased the armamentarium available to the physician for thromboprophylaxis in non-valvular AF (NVAF) patients. This review describes the characteristics of NOACs, analyzing aspects related to their use in the thromboprophylaxis of NVAF patients. It also discusses how to optimize NOAC therapy in specific clinical conditions, such as renal or liver impairment, and concomitant assumption of drugs potentially interfering with NOACs action. Finally, it focuses on NOAC-related bleeding management in the setting of non-cardiac surgery or radiofrequency catheter ablation of NVAF."

Risk factors for pre-eclampsia include socio-demographical factors (extremes of reproductive age, socio-economic status, ethnic group), genetic factors, pregnancy factors (multiple pregnancies, primigravidae, previous pre-eclampsia) or personal medical history (obesity, chronic renal disease, chronic hypertension, diabetes mellitus, thrombophilia). These risk factors and Doppler screening can help target interventions such as aspirin and calcium that have been proven to reduce the incidence of pre-eclampsia in high risk women. Expectant management is the mainstay of treatment for pre-eclampsia. Hypertension should be controlled by oral or intravenous antihypertensive agents as necessary. Magnesium sulphate is the agent of choice for both the treatment and prevention of eclampsia. Fluid balance and thromboprophylaxis are also both important elements in the management of severe pre-eclampsia."
CD008201,0,24659084,0,The role of rivaroxaban in atrial fibrillation and acute coronary syndromes.,"Rivaroxaban, a direct factor Xa inhibitor, is a novel oral anticoagulant approved for stroke prevention in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and also approved in Europe (but not in the United States) to prevent recurrent ischemic events in patients with recent acute coronary syndromes. Advantages of rivaroxaban over oral anticoagulants such as warfarin are the lack of need for ongoing monitoring, a fixed-dose regimen, and fewer drug and food interactions. Drawbacks include a lack of an antidote and the absence of a widely available method to reliably monitor the anticoagulant effect. In patients at risk of stroke due to atrial fibrillation, rivaroxaban was noninferior compared to warfarin in preventing stroke/systemic embolism in the Rivaroxaban Once Daily Oral Direct Factor Xa Inhibition Compared with Vitamin K Antagonism for Prevention of Stroke and Embolism Trial in Atrial Fibrillation (ROCKET-AF) trial and was associated with a similar risk of major bleeding; the incidence of intracranial hemorrhage was 33% lower with rivaroxaban. Concerns raised about the trial were the adequacy of warfarin management and the increase in event rate at the end of the trial. The drug acquisition cost of rivaroxaban is higher than that of warfarin although decision-analytic models suggest that it is cost effective in atrial fibrillation. In patients with recent acute coronary syndrome, low-dose rivaroxaban reduced mortality and the composite end point of death from cardiovascular causes, myocardial infarction and stroke, but this was accompanied by an increased risk of intracranial hemorrhage and major bleeding in the Rivaroxaban in Combination With Aspirin Alone or With Aspirin and a Thienopyridine in Patients With Acute Coronary Syndromes-Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (ATLAS ACS 2-TIMI) 51 trial. Thus, rivaroxaban appears to be a valuable addition to the therapeutic armamentarium in atrial fibrillation although caution should be exercised, given the limited experience in combination with novel oral antiplatelet agents. The role of rivaroxaban as part of a modern regimen in acute coronary syndrome continues to be evaluated."

Guidelines recommend use of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) or unfractionated heparin (5,000 U three times daily) for VTE prophylaxis in hospitalized medical patients with risk factors for VTE; in patients with contraindications to anticoagulants, mechanical prophylaxis is recommended. All hospitalized medical patients should be assessed for their risk of VTE at admission and daily thereafter, and those with reduced mobility and one or more other VTE risk factors are candidates for aggressive VTE prophylaxis. Based on results from the recently reported EXCLAIM trial, extended postdischarge prophylaxis with LMWH for 28 days should be considered for hospitalized medical patients with reduced mobility who are older than age 75 or have a cancer diagnosis or a history of VTE."

Guidelines recommend routine anticoagulation with oral vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) for patients at moderate-to-high risk of stroke, and acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) for those at low risk of stroke. ASA is less effective at reducing the risk of stroke than VKAs; however, ASA does not require monitoring or dose adjustment. Trials of anticoagulants show consistent benefits of oral VKAs for primary and secondary stroke prevention in patients with AF. Nevertheless, VKAs do require frequent coagulation monitoring and dose adjustment because of their variable dose-response profile, narrow therapeutic window, increased risk for bleeding complications and numerous food and drug interactions. This review aims to provide an overview of the clinical challenges of anticoagulant therapy for the prevention of stroke in patients with AF."

The insertion of drug-eluting stents (DES) requires dual anti-platelet therapy for at least 1 year which makes planned and emergency surgery difficult. There is a dilemma between high risk of stent thrombosis and perioperative bleeding. There is no evidence-based, bridging therapy option available perioperatively. This complex of problems should be considered whenever PCI is performed. An interdisciplinary approach is obligatory in these imminent conditions to proceed with either interventional or surgical revascularization. Co-existing malignancies and disorders which must be treated surgically should be excluded before PCI. Furthermore, DES and dual anti-platelet therapy produce unanswered forensic questions. On legal grounds it is not possible to proceed with surgery in cases of medication with anti-platelet therapy. Therefore, it is mandatory to discuss the possible answers to this problem with health care lawyers. The patient must be informed about this complex of problems."

Current practice guidelines for antiplatelet therapy advocate a 1 to 12-month dual antiplatelet therapy after bare metal stent PCI and an up to 12-month dual antiplatelet therapy after PCI in patients with ACS and drug-eluting stent PCI. Premature withdrawal of dual antiplatelet therapy carries a substantial risk of stent thrombosis but perioperative continuation of dual antiplatelet therapy is associated with an increased risk of bleeding, particularly in patients treated with the new potent drugs prasugrel and ticagrelor. Based on the various available assays, the lack of validated cut-offs and the disappointing results of targeted antiplatelet therapy as demonstrated by the GRAVITAS trial, current guidelines of international societies recommend platelet function testing only for selected high risk patients despite the known association between clopidogrel low responsiveness and ischemic events. However, for individual patients taking clopidogrel, platelet function monitoring may be considered to safely shorten the preoperative waiting period, to assess the risk of bleeding and transfusion and to initiate specific therapy in bleeding patients."

Cardiac surgical intervention may prevent embolism, but the guidelines for timing of intervention are unclear. An accepted approach is to intervene only if two episodes of peripheral embolism occur. Our recent experience suggests a more refined approach is in order. Eight children with active bacterial endocarditis have been treated with embolic complications. One patient with abdominal pain and GI bleeding was treated with heparin for multiple peripheral mesenteric emboli. Four patients had femoral embolectomies, one twice. Three patients developed embolomycotic aneurysms of the aorta in two cases and the common iliac in one; all were ruptured and two survived with staged reconstruction in one and extra-anatomic bypass in the other. Staph aureus and Strep viridans were the organisms involved most often. A review of the details of care in these patients leads to the following conclusions: angiographic survey reveals that most patients have multiple emboli; early embolectomy may prevent formation of infected aneurysms; Staph aureus infected patients are at risk for development of infected aneurysms; patients with large floppy vegetations in the left heart on echocardiography are at high risk for embolism; and 2 to 3 weeks from onset of endocarditis is the peak time for embolic risk."

CD008201,0,12236019,0,The risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism.,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a chronic rather than acute disease. After withdrawal of secondary thromboprophylaxis, many patients will experience a subsequent episode of thrombosis. Of these patients, approximately 5% will die from pulmonary embolism. The risk of recurrent VTE depends on the number of risk factors and their severity. High-risk patients, i.e. those with a natural coagulation inhibitor deficiency, recurrent thrombosis, active cancer, the lupus anticoagulant or compound clotting defects most probably benefit from indefinite oral anticoagulation. In these patients the risk of bleeding due to anticoagulant treatment seems to be outweighed by the risk of VTE. Patients with hyperhomocysteinemia or high factor (F) VIII plasma levels are also at an increased risk of recurrence. The optimal duration of secondary thromboprophylaxis in these patients is currently under investigation. Patients with the heterozygous F V Leiden mutation or the G20210A mutation in the F II gene do not require extended anticoagulation since their risk of recurrence is similar as in patients without the aforementioned mutations. Patients with VTE secondary to surgery or trauma have a relatively low risk of recurrence. In these patients short-term secondary thromboprophylaxis (6 to 12 weeks) is justified whereas patients with a first episode of spontaneous VTE should be treated with oral anticoagulants for a longer period of time (3 to 6 months)."

The main purpose of the CDSS was to attempt to reduce the morbidity and mortality caused by embolism and thrombosis in patients admitted to hospitals. After implementation of this system in one of the large educational hospitals of Iran, a standard questionnaire was used, and interviews were conducted with physicians and nurses to evaluate the performance of the designed system for reducing the incidence of pulmonary embolism and thrombosis.

With total joint arthroplasty of the lower extremity, the risk of development of venous thrombosis is significant. As people age, co-morbidities and the risk of thrombosis also increase. A range of prophylactic strategies that can dramatically reduce the prevalence of venous thromboembolism in the aging population are available. Thromboprophylaxis has been shown in many randomized trials to reduce the incidence of venous thromboembolism in patients undergoing total joint arthroplasty. Use of any prophylaxis has to be examined in terms of risks and benefits to the patient. Generalized use of the guidelines published in Chest has substantially reduced the incidence of venous thromboembolism in the hospitalized elderly patient undergoing major orthopaedic surgery of the lower extremity.

Based on 25 studies that were found in MEDLINE and the Cochrane library, this systematic literature review identifies the effectiveness of intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) on thrombosis prophylaxis. In almost all medical settings IPC contributes to a significant reduction of the incidence of DVT. At the same time, IPC has minimal negative side effects and is also cost effective.

CD008201,0,18544309,0,Prevention and treatment of deep venous thrombosis.,"Postoperative venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common cause of preventable patient morbidity and mortality. Hospitalized patients have multiple risk factors for VTE, which can exert a cumulative effect on the individual patient. Although effective thromboprophylactic measures are currently available, they are not commonly used for a number of reasons, in addition to heightened concern about increasing bleeding risk. Limited data are available characterizing the incidence of symptomatic VTE following major vascular surgery in the absence of thromboprophylactic therapy. Reported rates vary according to the type of surgery, type of prophylaxis used, and diagnostic modalities used for deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). Hospital-acquired DVT in the absence of thromboprophylaxis can occur in up to 40% of patients, occurring primarily in the proximal deep veins, which elevates the risk of PE. Risk factors for VTE in vascular surgery include limb ischemia, prolonged surgery duration, localized intraoperative trauma, and atherosclerosis. Advanced patient age is also a risk factor for VTE; however, the relationship between age and risk of VTE after surgery is complex and dependent on both the type of surgery and the underlying disease process. Evidence-based guidelines for venous thrombo-prophylaxis are now available; however, adoption of and compliance with these guidelines have lagged. Effective thrombo-prophylactic strategies exist and include both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic approaches. For those surgical patients who develop a VTE, antithrombotic therapy remains the treatment of choice."

Patients are randomized and receive three times daily 5000 IU UF heparin or once daily 3100 IU LMW heparin and two placebo injections subcutaneously for 10 days. All patients are screened for the presence of proximal DVT at day 1 and 10 by real-time B-mode compression sonography and for PE by repeated clinical examinations. Perfusion scintigraphy is used for confirmation of the clinical diagnosis of PE. The study protocol includes a stratified randomization of patients on admission to the hospital according to one of the following main diagnoses: malignant disease, cardiovascular disease, bronchopulmonary disease, neurologic disease, and other diseases. The present study may serve as a model for further clinical trials in medical inpatients using the biometric approach of statistical analysis for proving equivalence of drug efficacy, and to adopt less sensitive but noninvasive methods for the detection of primary endpoints."
CD008201,0,25957095,0,Risks and benefits of low molecular-weight heparin and target-specific oral anticoagulant use for thromboprophylaxis in medically ill patients.,"Venous thromboembolism is the third most common cardiovascular disease and a major cause of inpatient mortality as over 50 % of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism are undetected in medically treated patients. Several agents are approved for thromboprophylaxis, including warfarin, unfractionated heparin, low molecular-weight heparins, fondaparinux, and target-specific oral anticoagulants. The purpose of this literature review is to discuss the increased risk of venous thromboembolism in medically ill patients and the literature surrounding the efficacy and tolerability of low molecular-weight heparins and target-specific oral anticoagulants for this indication. PubMed, MEDLINE, EBSCOhost, and clinicaltrials.gov were used as search engines in the literature review. Search limits included articles containing human subjects, scholarly (peer-reviewed) journals written in English, and publication dates from 2004 to 2014. Animal studies, non-English articles, and publications dated prior to 2004 were excluded. Recurrent venous thromboembolism remains an ongoing problem affecting thousands of people in the non-surgical population annually. With limited data, it is not likely that target-specific oral anticoagulants will soon replace low molecular-weight heparins or even be considered an alternative until efficacy and tolerability have been established. Until further evidence is disclosed, low molecular-weight heparins and fondaparinux (in the absence of renal dysfunction and low body weight) should continue to be utilized as first-line agents for thromboprophylaxis in medically ill patients. The use of apixaban and rivaroxaban is discouraged for thromboprophylaxis in medically ill patients."
CD008201,0,24940110,0,Evidence-based guidance on venous thromboembolism in patients with solid tumours.,"Venous thromboembolism (vte) is a serious, life-threatening complication of cancer. Anticoagulation therapy such as low molecular weight heparin (lmwh) has been shown to treat and prevent vte. Cancer therapy is often complex and ongoing, making the management of vte less straightforward in patients with cancer. There are no published Canadian guidelines available to suggest appropriate strategies for the management of vte in patients with solid tumours. We therefore aimed to develop a clear, evidence-based guideline on this topic. A systematic review of clinical trials and meta-analyses published between 2002 and 2013 in PubMed was conducted. Reference lists were hand-searched for additional publications. The National Guidelines Clearinghouse was searched for relevant guidelines. Recommendations were developed based on the best available evidence. In patients with solid tumours, lmwh is recommended for those with established vte and for those without established vte but with a high risk for developing vte. Options for lmwh include dalteparin, enoxaparin, and tinzaparin. No one agent can be recommended over another, but in the setting of renal insufficiency, tinzaparin is preferred. Unfractionated heparin can be used under select circumstances only (that is, when rapid clearance of the anticoagulant is desired). The most common adverse event is bleeding, but major events are rare, and with appropriate follow-up care, bleeding can be monitored and appropriately managed."

CD008201,0,19850588,0,Mechanical methods for thrombosis prophylaxis.,"Prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) remains the number one preventable cause of death in hospitalized patients. The pathogenesis of thrombosis involves the triad of venous stasis, dilatation of the leg veins, and changes in coagulability of the blood. These changes can be modified by the use of intermittent pneumatic compression devices (IPC) and, to a much lesser extent, by graduated compression hose (GCS). Studies have shown the effectiveness of GCS in preventing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) compared to placebo, but there is no evidence that they reduce the incidence of pulmonary emboli (PE). No venographic data are available regarding the efficacy of GCS; however, IPC have shown excellent efficacy in several venographic studies over the past 25 years. Mechanical methods are important to use in situations where the risk of bleeding exists, thereby making the use of anticoagulants hazardous. One of the key uses for mechanical methods is in combination with anticoagulants in patients at the highest risk of developing VTE. Chest consensus guidelines assigns a 2A recommendation for the use of combination prophylaxis in the highest risk patients. Unfortunately, studies to show which type of leg compression device is optimal for DVT prevention are not available, so individual preference, ease of use, and company support are the determining factors at the present time. Finally, compliance using these devices is a major problem, and until systems have been developed to easily monitor and ensure compliance, these methods will enjoy only limited use."

There were two co-primary endpoints: the percentage of patients at risk for VTE at hospital admission assessed by the physician, and the percentage of patients with risk factors for VTE that persist at hospital discharge from the total number of patients hospitalized with ischemic stroke. The secondary endpoints were: the percentage of hospitalized patients receiving prophylaxis according to the National Guidelines of VTE Prophylaxis from the total number of patients at risk of VTE, the percentage of hospitalized patients with VTE risk receiving recommendation for thromboprophylaxis at discharge, the duration and the type of VTE prophylaxis in hospitalized patients, the duration and the type of VTE prophylaxis at discharge."
CD008201,0,15099889,0,Sex and gender issues and venous thromboembolism.,"At least 250,000 episodes of VTE leading to hospitalization or death are estimated to occur in the United States each year. A number of clinical and demographic risk factors for VTE are recognized,with the latter including both age and race. Overall,the incidence of VTE does not appear to vary significantly by sex, as evidenced by a lack of consistency in the magnitude and even direction of effect of sex in a variety of epidemiologic studies of varying design. Several studies have shown a higher incidence among women than men during childbearing age. The issue of a gender effect on the natural history of VTE has not been well studied. The main influence of gender on VTE is the relationship between female gender and several well-recognized clinical risk factors for VTE:oral contraceptive use, hormone replacement therapy, estrogen receptor modulator therapy, and pregnancy. Hormonal therapies are associated with a twofold to threefold increase in VTE incidence. Risk is higher with some formulations than others, during initial use, and among women who are obese, smoke, or have one of several forms of heritable thrombophilia. The pregnant state is associated with a threefold to fivefold increase in VTE risk, and thromboembolism is a major cause of peripartum death. Heritable thrombophilias are also important co-determinants of VTE risk in pregnancy. The mechanisms through which pregnancy and hormonal therapies increase VTE risk have not been definitively established, but hormonal effects on levels of coagulation and anticoagulation factors likely play a role. Venous compression and venous injury also contribute to increased risk during pregnancy and the puerperium. Approaches to diagnosis of VTE in the pregnant woman are largely the same as in the nonpregnant patient, but special treatment considerations do apply. Warfarin is embryopathic, particularly between the 6th and 12th weeks of pregnancy, and should be avoided in favor or heparin or low-molecular weight heparin when treatment of the pregnant woman is necessary. Guidelines have been published to assist the clinician in decision making about prophylaxis of pregnant women at increased risk or pregnancy-related or post-partum VTE."
CD008201,0,12095590,0,The timing of fracture treatment in polytrauma patients: relevance of damage control orthopedic surgery.,"Information illustrating the benefits of fracture stabilization after multiple trauma has been gathering for almost a century. At the turn of the last century, the introduction of the Thomas splint clearly demonstrated the importance of skeletal stabilization in the management of these patients. The introduction of standardized surgical treatment for fractures in the early 1950s is considered today as the turning point in the care of the polytraumatized patient. With the knowledge acquired, the application of early operative fixation of fractures in severely injured patients in the 1980s has yielded to the concept of early total care of all fractures. Yet, in distinct patient subgroups with severe thoracic injuries and very high injury severity scores, this concept has been associated with adverse outcomes. Therefore, in a further era that began in the 1990s, a different approach has been favored for these subgroups. It recommends early (initial) temporary stabilization followed by secondary definitive osteosynthesis of major fractures in patients at high risk of developing systemic complications. In the last decade, attempts have been made to determine which patients benefit from early total care and which ones should undergo a secondary definitive approach.

Data from the litterature are lacking to draw evidence-based recommandations for venous thromboprophylaxis after these three types of surgeries, and the following guidelines are but experts'opinions (Grade D recommendations). Thromboprophylaxis is recommended after CABG (Grade D), with either subcutaneous (SC) low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or SC or intravenous (i.v.) unfractioned heparin (UH) (PTT target = 1.1-1.5 time control value) (both grade D).

Not all patients with atrial fibrillation are equal in terms of thromboembolic risk; therefore, not all will benefit from oral anticoagulation treatment. The general principle is that the expected benefit of anticoagulation in reduction of thromboembolic risk must exceed the expected harm caused by possible bleeding. Some guidelines have focused on a categorical approach to stroke prevention, with a focus on identifying patients at high risk for oral anticoagulation. Various current guidelines recommend assessment of stroke risk using the CHADS2 or CHA2DS2-VASc scores to initially detect patients at low risk who require no antithrombotic therapy. However, the scores do not incorporate all possible risk factors causing a high thromboembolic risk. Factors such as impaired renal function, obstructive sleep apnea, and echocardiographic and biochemical or coagulation parameters can also predict adverse thromboembolic events. The present review aims to describe biomarkers whether blood, urine, imaging (cardiac or cerebral), or clinical that go beyond the CHA2DS2-VASc score and potentially aid stroke risk assessment. Although useful in some cases, the presented parameters should be perhaps used to further refine initial identification of patients at low risk, after which effective stroke prevention can be offered to those with ≥1 additional stroke risk factors."

Thrombotic mass disappeared 8 to 12 hours after initiation of therapy, and 10 weeks after discharge TTE showed normalized right ventricle dimensions and function in all 4 patients."
CD008201,0,6859067,0,Mural thrombi in myocardial infarctions. Prospective evaluation by two-dimensional echocardiography.,"Fifty-four consecutive patients with acute anterior myocardial infarctions were studied to determine the incidence and natural history of mural thrombus formation. Two-dimensional echocardiography was performed in the immediate postinfarction period. Multiple views were utilized. Standard criteria for defining mural thrombus formation and minimizing false-positive readings were adhered to. Correlation with clinical data was obtained in all patients to define a subgroup at high risk for the development of a mural thrombus. Follow-up was obtained for all patients to assess the natural history of mural thrombus formation, treated and untreated, with regard to peripheral embolization. Seventeen patients (32 percent) had mural thrombus formation. Statistically significant (p less than 0.001) correlation for mural thrombus formation was found with markedly elevated creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase levels and with apical dyskinesis. Ten patients with mural thrombi received anticoagulation therapy. None has had clinically evident emboli at a mean of 10.8 months follow-up. Resolution of the mural thrombus was demonstrated with serial two-dimensional echocardiography in eight patients (80 percent). Six of seven patients who did not receive anticoagulation therapy (86 percent) had embolic events within three months (p less than 0.001). None of the 36 patients without a mural thrombus has had a spontaneous clinical embolus. Thus, the presence of a mural thrombus can be accurately identified in patients with acute myocardial infarction and predicted in a subgroup of those patients. Such patients should be considered for anticoagulation to prevent systemic embolization and should be followed with serial two-dimensional echocardiography."
CD008201,0,23160864,0,Treatment of dabigatran-associated bleeding: case report and review of the literature.,"Dabigatran etexilate is a competitive, direct thrombin inhibitor that works in the coagulation cascade to ultimately prevent thrombus formation. It is recommended by the 2012 American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines as first-line therapy over vitamin k antagonists for long-term antithrombotic therapy in patients with paroxysmal or persistent nonrheumatic atrial fibrillation who are at intermediate to high risk of stroke and systemic embolism (grade 2B). However, serious postmarketing events involving life-threatening bleeding are emerging with no antidote for reversal of the anticoagulant effect being available for use. Potential reversal agents are being used in clinical practice with questionable efficacy and safety profiles. We report a case involving an 84-year-old male with acute kidney injury who developed life-threatening gastrointestinal and surgical site bleeding secondary to dabigatran accumulation. Use of the Naranjo probability scale indicated a probable cause between the bleeding event and dabigatran use. After discontinuation of drug therapy, fresh frozen plasma, recombinant coagulation factor VIIa, and cryoprecipitate were administered as potential reversal agents with negligible benefit. However, this patient appeared to slowly benefit with administration of continuous venovenous hemodialysis. Based upon our experience with this patient and literature review, the most effective treatment algorithm for dabigatran-associated bleeding may be to utilize hemodialysis initially."
CD008201,0,17763365,0,Is early cardioversion for atrial fibrillation safe in patients with spontaneous echocardiographic contrast?,"The 2006 American Heart Association guidelines for management of patients with atrial fibrillation state ""For patients with no identifiable thrombus in the left atrium (LA) or left atrial appendage (LAA), cardioversion (CV) is reasonable immediately after anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin. Thereafter, continuation of oral anticoagulation is reasonable for an anticoagulation period of at least 4 weeks"". For patients with thrombus identified by transesophageal echocardiography, guidelines recommend therapeutic oral anticoagulation for 3 weeks prior to and 4 weeks after elective cardioversion. Patients with spontaneous echo contrast (SEC) identified by TEE have a high risk of thromboembolic events,1-8 however, the guidelines do not address whether patients with SEC without thrombus can be safely cardioverted. This paper reviews the literature describing the pathogenesis of SEC, how it is detected, and whether elective cardioversion is safe. On the basis of our review, we believe that the risk of cardioembolic stroke after cardioversion of a patient with SEC is low, regardless of anticoagulation. The safe conclusion is that patients with SEC on TEE should receive therapeutic anticoagulation prior to cardioversion if possible and early cardioversion is not contraindicated."

CD008201,0,8172036,0,Preventing deep venous thrombosis in hospitalized patients.,"Deep venous thrombosis with subsequent pulmonary embolism remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients. Although prophylactic treatment may reduce the incidence of deep venous thrombosis by up to 70 percent, it is estimated that only 32 percent of hospitalized patients at high risk receive adequate prophylaxis. Older patients, obese patients and patients undergoing orthopedic procedures of the lower limbs are at particularly high risk of developing deep venous thrombosis. Both mechanical and pharmacologic measures provide effective prophylaxis. Newer treatment protocols have greatly reduced the incidence of drug side effects, particularly bleeding."
CD008201,0,1519528,0,Reappraisal by transesophageal echocardiography of the significance of left atrial thrombi in the prediction of systemic arterial embolization in rheumatic mitral valve disease.,"Systemic arterial embolization imparts a significant risk of serious complications throughout the lives of patients with rheumatic heart disease. Left atrial (LA) thrombi have been thought to be the major source of emboli. A transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) study of 260 consecutive patients with rheumatic mitral valve disease was performed during a period of 24 months, with particular reference to understanding the association between LA thrombi and embolic complications. Of these patients, 155 had predominant mitral stenosis, 24 had significant mitral regurgitation, and the remaining 81 with xenograft mitral valve replacement developed valvular dysfunction (25 resulted in predominant mitral stenosis and 56 in significant mitral regurgitation). LA thrombi were detected in 38 patients (group A) and absent in 222 (group B). Group A patients had a higher frequency of recent (less than or equal to 1 week before TEE study) and remote (greater than 1 week before) embolization than did group B patients (recent: 26.3 vs 5.4% [p less than 0.001]; remote: 18.4 vs 5.0% [p less than 0.01]). The frequency of atrial fibrillation was also greater in group A patients (100 vs 74.3%; p less than 0.001). The exclusion of patients with significant mitral regurgitation and sinus rhythm had no effect on the association between LA thrombi and evidence of previous embolization. It is concluded that TEE is a convenient diagnostic modality that can be used to identify a subset of patients with rheumatic mitral valve disease at high risk for systemic embolization. Consequently, preventive anticoagulation for possible embolic complications should be more vigorously adhered to in patients with rheumatic mitral valve disease and LA thrombi."

CD008201,0,19718471,0,Venous thromboembolic events in hospitalised medical patients.,"The number of acutely ill hospitalised medical patients at risk for acute venous thromboembolism (VTE) has not been well defined. Therefore, we used the 2003 United States Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) Nationwide Inpatient Sample database to estimate VTE events among hospitalised medical patients. We then modeled the potential reduction in VTE with universal utilisation of appropriate pharmacological thromboprophylaxis. We calculated that 8,077,919 acutely ill hospitalised medical patients were at risk for VTE. Heart failure, respiratory failure, pneumonia, and cancer were the most common medical diagnoses. We estimated that 196,134 VTE-related events occurred in 2003, afflicting two out of every 100 acutely ill hospitalised medical patients. These VTE-related events were comprised of 122,235 symptomatic deep venous thromboses, 32,654 symptomatic episodes of pulmonary embolism, and 41,245 deaths due to VTE. In our model, rates of pharmacological thromboprophylaxis prescription were low for various acute medical illnesses, ranging from 15.3% to 49.2%. However, with universal thromboprophylaxis, 114,174 VTE-related events would have been prevented. In conclusion, acutely ill medical patients represent a large population vulnerable to the development of VTE during hospitalisation. The number of VTE-related events would be halved with universal thromboprophylaxis. Further efforts focused on improving VTE prevention strategies in hospitalised medical patients are warranted."
CD008201,0,22615082,0,Preventing venous thromboembolic events after total hip arthroplasty: new developments in clinical practice.,"Total hip arthroplasty is a frequently performed orthopedic surgical procedure, and the number of these surgeries is expected to increase significantly over the coming years. Patients undergoing joint arthroplasty are at a particularly high risk for developing venous thromboembolic events (eg, deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism). Prevention of postoperative complications is an important responsibility not only for orthopedic surgeons, but also for other clinicians involved in patients' care. Effective thromboprophylaxis is crucial to reduce the risk of developing venous thromboembolism following total hip arthroplasty and is an important goal of therapy. In response to some of the practical limitations of traditional anticoagulants, a new generation of oral anticoagulants has been developed. These agents include the selective factor Xa inhibitors, rivaroxaban and apixaban, and the direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran etexilate. The objective of this review article is to update hospitalists on the trial data and clinical considerations surrounding the new anticoagulants. Hospitalists play a key role in caring for surgical patients either in a consultative role or in conjunction with surgical teams. Thus, a practical knowledge of recent developments in thromboprophylaxis is essential for providing high-quality, evidence-based care."
CD008201,0,21063670,0,[Diagnosis and treatment of infective endocarditis. Current ESC guidelines].,"To account for the current evidence in the field of infective endocarditis and to harmonize deviant national guidelines, in 2009 the European Society of Cardiology published novel recommendations on the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of infective endocarditis.The most important changes can be found concerning antimicrobial prophylaxis for endocarditis, the antimicrobial treatment of endocarditis caused by S. aureus and the indications for surgical treatment.Due to the weak evidence about prophylactic administration of antibiotics before procedures at risk for bacteraemia to prevent infective endocarditis, the novel guidelines recommend prophylaxis only in patients with the highest risk for infection and lethal course of endocarditis. These are patients with prosthetic valves or prosthetic material used for cardiac repair, patients with previous endocarditis and patients with congenital heart disease. A narrow definition of procedures at risk was proposed only including dental procedures requiring manipulation of the gingival or periapical region of teeth.For endocarditis caused by S. aureus an additional gentamicin administration was previously recommended but this is now seen only as optional due to its nephrotoxicity. In methicillin-resistant strains daptomycin is a possible alternative to vancomycin. In strains susceptible to methicillin, beta-lactamic antibiotics were definitively preferred than the usage of vancomycin due to better outcome. The current guidelines recommend definitive timing and risk constellations for surgical treatment of infective endocarditis. For example, cardiac shock due to valvular lesions refractory to medical treatment should give rise to an emergency intervention within 24 h. Other indication groups contain uncontrolled infection and prevention of embolism and indications were defined as urgent or elective depending on the clinical situation."
CD008201,0,23129344,0,Therapy in pediatric stroke.,"The aim of this review is to summarize the existing literature on therapy and management of cerebrovascular insults in children and adolescents. As data sources, studies were identified by MEDLINE, PubMed, Cochrane Library, and relevant bibliographies for the topic ""pediatric stroke."" We also reviewed guidelines for ""stroke in adults."" As a result, pediatric stroke is underestimated. The annual incidence for all stroke entities (cerebral venous thrombosis and hemorrhagic and arterial ischemic stroke) is as high as for pediatric brain tumors, 3-15/100.000 children per year. A distinct etiology can be determined only in a minority of them. Underlying risk factors are multiple, mainly vasculopathies, congential heart diseases, coagulopathies, lipometabolic disorders, and sickle cell anemia. Current recommendations for therapy are based on adult studies, are preliminary, and discussed controversially. Antithrombotic therapy is uniformly recommended for the acute stage of pediatric stroke; no consensus exists on antiplatelet therapy with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA, aspirin) (5 mg/d), with ultra-fractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin. Thrombolysis using recombinant tissue plasminogen activator is not advised, despite the fact that current practice takes a different approach. None of the guidelines specify the duration of ASA for secondary prevention. Additional supportive therapy measures are osmotherapy and decompressive craniectomy. Oxygen in the absence of hypoxemia, intensive insulin therapy, antiepileptic drugs in the absence of clinical or electrographic seizures, corticosteroids, and GP-IIb/IIIa-receptor antagonists should not be used outside clinical trials. In conclusions, current therapeutic guidelines for pediatric stoke are still based on consensus and expert and society opinions and differ between countries. Consensus prevails on the need for acute anticoagulation using either antiplatelets or heparin. Long-term treatment with acetylsalicylic acid in all or only high-risk patients and for how long remains the subject of debate. Lifelong secondary prevention has never been investigated in children or adults. All guidelines agree that there is no indication for thrombolysis in children outside clinical trials, although clinical practice in large centers differs."
CD008201,0,17389242,0,Delivery of anti-platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule single-chain variable fragment-urokinase fusion protein to the cerebral vasculature lyses arterial clots and attenuates postischemic brain edema.,"Efficacy and safety of current means to prevent cerebrovascular thrombosis in patients at high risk of stroke are suboptimal. In theory, anchoring fibrinolytic plasminogen activators to the luminal surface of the cerebral endothelium might arrest formation of occlusive clots in this setting. We tested this approach using the recombinant construct antiplatelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM) single-chain variable fragment (scFv)-urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), fusing low-molecular-weight single-chain urokinase-type plasminogen activator with a scFv of an antibody directed to the stably expressed endothelial surface determinant PECAM-1, implicated in inflammation and thrombosis. Studies in mice showed that scFv-uPA, but not unconjugated uPA 1) accumulates in the brain after intravascular injection, 2) lyses clots lodged in the cerebral arterial vasculature without hemorrhagic complications, 3) provides rapid and stable cerebral reperfusion, and 4) alleviates post-thrombotic brain edema. Effective and safe thromboprophylaxis in the cerebral arterial circulation by anti-PECAM scFv-uPA represents a prototype of a new paradigm to prevent recurrent cerebrovascular thrombosis."
CD008201,0,16167661,0,Anticoagulation: American College of Chest Physicians guidelines for the prevention and management of postoperative atrial fibrillation after cardiac surgery.,"Post-cardiac surgery atrial fibrillation (AF) places patients at risk for thromboembolism and stroke, while the surgery and cardiopulmonary bypass alter the multiple factors of coagulation and may increase the tendency to bleed. It is in the context of this complex clinical picture that the physician must make decisions regarding the risks and benefits of anticoagulation therapy to lower the risk for thromboembolism and stroke associated with postoperative AF. Physicians must also weigh the usually transient and self-limited duration of new-onset postoperative AF against the potential for postoperative bleeding if anticoagulation therapy is started. No randomized, controlled clinical trials are available that specifically address the problem of anticoagulation therapy for the postoperative AF. In that context, recommendations are based on the established therapy for nonsurgical situations modified by the potential risk of bleeding in the postoperative patient."

CD008201,0,12787539,0,Inherited thrombophilias and anticoagulation in pregnancy.,"Thromboprophylaxis, primary or secondary, should be considered in selected pregnant women with inherited thrombophilias; such women may be divided into high-, medium- and low-risk categories on the basis of the specific thrombophilic defect and any personal or family history of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Women at high risk of VTE should receive treatment doses of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) throughout pregnancy and should remain on anticoagulation for 6 weeks postpartum, or, where appropriate, long-term. Women at moderate risk should be treated with prophylactic fixed-dose LMWH throughout pregnancy and for 6 weeks postpartum. Women at low risk should receive prophylactic fixed-dose LMWH for 6 weeks postpartum, and low-dose aspirin LDA should be considered during pregnancy. LWMH offers important advantages over unfractionated heparin (UFH); heparin-induced thrombocytopaenia (HIT) and osteopaenia are rarely seen. For treatment doses of LMWH, dosage adjustment based on anti-Xa levels is usually required as pregnancy progresses. Warfarin should be avoided throughout pregnancy. LMWH, UFH and warfarin are safe for breast-feeding mothers."

Eligible patients were classified according to venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk category by trained nurses. Either standard or low-molecular weight heparin was recommended to intermediate or high-risk VTE patients. Adopting the recommended PTP was at the physician's discretion. At discharge, PTP use was recorded. PTP was recommended to 10,016 patients, of whom 2165 (21.6%) received the recommended thromboprophylaxis. In the multivariate logistic regression, PTP use/nonuse remained independently associated with female sex [odds ratio (OR) 0.75; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.68-0.84], age (OR 1.04; 95% CI 1.03-1.04), being admitted to the Gynecology-Obstetrics (OR 0.31; 95% CI 0.25-0.39) or surgery (OR 1.26; 95% CI 1.12-1.42), thrombophilia (OR 5.15; 95% CI 2.04-12.98), previous VTE event (OR 2.98; 95% CI 1.78-4.98), diabetes (OR 1.84; 95% CI 1.61-2.10), acute myocardial infarction (OR 5.87; 95% CI 4.81-7.17), and admission to a major orthopedic surgery (OR 3.03; 95% CI 1.98-4.64). PTP in this hospital population was grossly underused. Eight independent variables predicted use/nonuse of PTP. Targeting variables related to the use and nonuse of PTP is important to direct the application of thromboprophylaxis."

Laboratory findings showed alkaline phosphatase to be greatly elevated, and platelet counts and coagulation factor showed that the patient had disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Compression fractures of the thoracic vertebrae were found on radiological examination. The histological findings from bone marrow showed metastasis of adenocarcinoma with signet-ring cells, although the primary site was unknown. To reduce tumor cells in number and improve DIC, 11 cycles of 5-Fluorouracil and leucovorin therapy were done, and the patient survived for 12 months. Autopsy showed a 0.8 cm diameter, poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with the signet-ring cell type in the lamina propria of the Vater's ampulla. Many metastatic foci and micro tumor emboli were found in the lung and in bone marrow. The sections of the stomach, the gallbladder, urinary bladder, prostate, and thyroid gland showed no malignant cells. These findings suggest that the origin of the cancer may have been located in the Vater's ampulla. This is a rare case of an ampullary tumor of poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with the signet-ring cell type, without jaundice but with multiple metastasis. 5-Fluorouracil and leucovorin were effective for increasing survival time and improving quality of life."

The ""second hit"" hypothesis suggested that an additional trigger may be needed to develop a vascular event in aPL carriers. In this article, pro and con of primary thromboprophylaxis in aPL carriers is deeply discussed, concluding that univocal data are not available, due to conflicting results of available clinical trials. However, in clinical practice the primary thromboprophylaxis is not indicated in all unselected asymptomatic aPL carriers, and the best strategy begin with the assessment of the peculiar risk profile of the subject. Thus, it is mandatory to eliminate modifiable prothrombotic risk factors (i.e. smoking, oral contraceptive), to treat the irreversible risk factors (i.e. hypertension, diabetes) and to introduce an aggressive prophylaxis with subcutaneous LMWH in high-risk situations (i.e. surgical procedures with prolonged immobilization). A different evaluation should be addressed to aPL carriers with a concomitant autoimmune disease that are considered as an additional pro-thrombotic risk factor. Similarly, concomitant positivity for more than one anti-phospholipid test confer a stronger risk of developing the thrombotic manifestations. Specific trials with larger cohorts of patients are needed to better clarify this issue."

In these patients, oral contraceptives were contraindicated because of severe cardiovascular diseases, thromboembolic complications, benign liver tumours, advanced diabetes, terminal kidney insufficiency and severe migraine. Buserelin was administered intranasally in one daily dose of 300-400 micrograms from the 1st day to the 21st day, one dose of 100 mg of Progesterone was given intravaginally daily from the 12th day to the 21st day. Under these conditions, average E2 concentrations were found in the range of 50-60 pg/ml. The discontinuation of progesterone replacement resulted in withdrawal bleeding. Cycle control was acceptable. In 4 cases, this contraceptive regimen had to be discontinued because of side effects or paradox reactions. One patient conceived. In conclusion, GnRH-analogues in a moderate dose can be used to inhibit ovulation without inhibiting follicular maturation and adequate oestrogen production.

Special emphasis is placed on the most recent prophylactic treatment, low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs), particularly enoxaparin. Several LMWHs are now available, but they differ slightly and each must be evaluated on its own merits. In general, however, LMWHs are both effective and safe in those patients at moderate or high risk of DVT. Thromboprophylaxis is cost effective when analysed using health-economic methodology."

Recent guidelines recommend continuation of oral anticoagulation in all patients with CHA2DS2VASc score ≥ 2 even if there is no evidence of recurrent atrial fibrillation. Due to lack of prospective data, the net clinical benefit of oral anticoagulation after successful ablation in these patients is unclear. As oral anticoagulation bears the risk of severe bleeding events, the ODIn-AF study aims to evaluate the effect of oral anticoagulation on the incidence of silent cerebral embolic events in patients with a high risk for embolic events, but free from symptomatic atrial fibrillation after successful pulmonary vein ablation."
CD008201,0,8083936,0,Diagnosis of pulmonary embolism at a large teaching hospital.,"Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common clinical entity, although the signs and symptoms that accompany it are nonspecific. This has led to the development of several diagnostic algorithms for diagnosis of PE. These approaches combine noninvasive tests such as ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) lung scanning, impedance plethysmography, and ultrasound, with invasive techniques such as venography and pulmonary angiography. To investigate the manner in which clinicians select and use these various diagnostic strategies, we retrospectively reviewed 316 consecutive cases of suspected PE to determine the sequence and type of diagnostic strategy employed by clinicians. We found that in the majority of cases, physicians chose not to further pursue a diagnosis of PE if the V/Q scan was nondiagnostic. These results suggest that physician behavior is often at variance with published clinical recommendations and that the implementation of clinical practice guidelines needs to be further examined."

CD008201,0,13677265,0,The risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism: the Austrian Study on Recurrent Venous Thromboembolism.,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a chronic disease. After withdrawal of oral anticoagulation at least a third of patients will experience a subsequent episode of venous thrombosis. Of these patients, approximately 5% will die from pulmonary embolism. The Austrian Study on Recurrent Venous Thromboembolism (AUREC) is a prospective cohort study aiming to investigate the overall rate of recurrent VTE, the predictive value of laboratory assays, the importance of acquired or congenital risk factors for thrombosis and the impact of extended or modified secondary thromboprophylaxis on the risk of recurrence among high-risk patients. So far, the AUREC investigators have identified subgroups of patients with a particular high risk of recurrence: patients with a history of venous thrombosis, elevated levels of coagulation factors VIII, IX and XI, pulmonary embolism or superficial venous thrombosis and a history of venous thrombosis and hyperhomocysteinemia. Patients with a history of venous thrombosis and mutations in genes encoding for coagulation factors (factor V Leiden, factor II, G20210A) do not have an enhanced risk of recurrence and, thus, do not qualify for extended secondary thromboprophylaxis. At present, interventional trials are in progress in patients with high factor VIII or hyperhomocysteinemia in order to investigate if these patient groups might benefit from extended oral anticoagulation or vitamin supplementation, respectively."

Acquired deficiency of antithrombin occurs in a variety of clinical circumstances, including hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), and is associated with multiorgan failure and death in these situations. Normalization of antithrombin levels by infusion of concentrates of this protein has been found to be beneficial in many of these situations, but has not been routinely used in HSCT. Before antithrombin concentrates can be widely recommended in HSCT, its pharmacokinetics at various phases of the transplant process must be defined to allow estimation of the proper dose and dosing interval. To this end, the recovery and half-life of antithrombin concentrate was determined prior to and 7, 14 and 28 days after beginning the preparative regimen in nine patients with lymphoma undergoing HSCT. The recovery of the infused material was constant during the transplant hospitalization, averaging 2.0% per unit/kg. The half-life, however, dropped significantly during the latter half of the transplant procedure. The half-lives pre-chemotherapy and on day 7 were similar and averaged 20.4 h. On days 14 and 21 the the half-lives were significantly lower at 12.2 and 15.5 h, respectively. The drop in half-life during the transplant process will require antithrombin concentrate to be given more frequently during this time to maintain constant antithrombin levels."
CD008201,0,7817078,0,[Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome in medically assisted reproduction].,"Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHS) is the most serious complication of ovulation induction, particularly in in vitro fertilization. It is a potentially life-threatening situation. Its pathophysiology is poorly understood. This syndrome is explained by a sudden increase in capillary permeability which results in a rapid fluid shift from the intravascular space into a third space leading to haemodynamic changes. In its most severe forms. OHS is characterized by multicystic ovarian enlargement, hemoconcentration, hypovolemia, oliguria, third space accumulation of fluid in the form of ascites and pleural effusion, renal failure, thrombotic disorders. Mild and the most of moderate forms of OHS usually do not require any active form of therapy. Severe OHS requires hospitalization, correction of fluid and electrolyte imbalance, prevention of thromboembolism, aspiration of the ascites and pleural effusion causing respiratory discomfort and dyspnea. Surgical interventions are exceptionally indicated and reserved for ovarian or rupture of ovarian cyst. Although severe OHS may not be completely avoided, early recognition of high-risk factors, judicious monitoring of ovulation induction (plasma estradiol levels and ultrasonography), and, perhaps in future, substitution of hCG for triggering ovulation should reduce the incidence of this iatrogenic syndrome."

CD008201,0,23325043,0,The post-thrombotic syndrome: a 2012 therapeutic update.,"Post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) refers to chronic manifestations of venous insufficiency following a deep-vein thrombosis (DVT). It is a frequent, chronic, burdensome and costly disease for which therapeutic options are limited. Above all, the optimal management of PTS consists of preventing its occurrence: first, by preventing DVT, and second, by preventing development of PTS after a DVT. Prevention of DVT is challenging, particularly in the case of nonsurgical hospital inpatients, where physician's adherence to recommended thromboprophylaxis is often low. In our opinion, this adherence should be improved by generalizing the use of multi-component approaches, including that of automatic reminders. For prevention of PTS after an acute DVT, our recommendations are as follows. After a proximal (popliteal and above) DVT we recommend early ambulation with daily use of 30-40 mmHg graduated elastic compression stockings (ECS) for two years, in addition to careful monitoring of anticoagulant therapy. Below-knee ECS are preferred to thigh-length ECS, as they have similar efficacy in preventing PTS and are better tolerated. To improve compliance with ECS, patient education is important, and use of lighter strengths of compression in patients not tolerating traditional strengths should be considered. Catheter-directed thrombolysis of acute DVT was recently shown to be effective in preventing PTS, but we believe that confirmatory studies are needed before recommending its general use. The cornerstone of management of established PTS relies on patient education and use of compression therapy. We encourage ambulation, use of ECS to manage symptoms, and participation in an exercise training program, which has the potential to improve patients' quality of life (QOL) and PTS scores. In the absence of symptom relief, ECS that provide a higher strength (40-50 mmHg) should be tried. In case of moderate to severe PTS, intermittent compressive devices can be used to improve PTS symptoms. Surgery and endovascular procedures, including balloon angioplasty, stent placement, endovenectomy or valve reconstruction should be considered only in specialized centers, and only for patients with severe PTS for whom previous conservative treatment has failed. These techniques are still under evaluation and the level of evidence supporting their use is low."

CD008201,0,25069620,0,Continuous passive motion for preventing venous thromboembolism after total knee arthroplasty.,"Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a common form of orthopaedic surgery. Venous thromboembolism (VTE), which consists of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), is a major and potentially fatal complication after TKA. The incidence of DVT after TKA is 40% to 80% and the incidence of PE is approximately 2%. It is generally agreed that thromboprophylaxis should be used in patients who undergo TKA. Both pharmacological and mechanical methods are used in the prevention of DVT. Pharmacological methods alter the blood coagulation profile and may increase the risk of bleeding complications. When pharmacological methods cannot be used the mechanical methods become crucial for VTE prophylaxis. Continuous passive motion (CPM) is provided through an external motorised device which enables a joint to move passively throughout a preset arc of motion. Despite the theoretical effectiveness and widespread use of CPM, there are still differing views on the effectiveness of CPM as prophylaxis against thrombosis after TKA. This is an update of the review first published in 2012."
CD008201,0,16049250,0,Continuous passive motion in the prevention of deep-vein thrombosis: a randomised comparison in trauma patients.,"There is a high risk of venous thromboembolism when patients are immobilised following trauma. The combination of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) with graduated compression stockings is frequently used in orthopaedic surgery to try and prevent this, but a relatively high incidence of thromboembolic events remains. Mechanical devices which perform continuous passive motion imitate contractions and increase the volume and velocity of venous flow. In this study 227 trauma patients were randomised to receive either treatment with the Arthroflow device and LMWH or only with the latter. The Arthroflow device passively extends and plantarflexes the feet. Patients were assessed initially by venous-occlusion plethysmography, compression ultrasonography and continuous wave Doppler, which were repeated weekly without knowledge of the category of randomisation. Those who showed evidence of deep-vein thrombosis underwent venography for confirmation. The incidence of deep-vein thrombosis was 25% in the LMWH group compared with 3.6% in those who had additional treatment with the Arthroflow device (p < 0.001). There were no substantial complications or problems of non-compliance with the Arthroflow device.

The availability of an effective oral anticoagulant with an acceptable safety profile that does not require routine clinical monitoring may lead clinicians to switch patients from subcutaneous to an oral therapy either during hospitalisation or at discharge. The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of enoxaparin on the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and safety of apixaban, an oral, direct inhibitor of coagulation factor Xa. In this four-period, crossover study, 20 healthy subjects were randomised to receive single doses of apixaban 5 mg orally; enoxaparin 40 mg subcutaneously; apixaban 5 mg and enoxaparin 40 mg concomitantly; and apixaban 5 mg followed 6 hours (h) after by enoxaparin 40 mg. Pharmacokinetics of apixaban were not affected by enoxaparin. Average peak pharmacodynamic effect, measured by anti-Xa activity, was 1.36 U/ml after administration of apixaban and was 0.42 U/ml after enoxaparin. Following co-administration of apixaban and enoxaparin, peak anti-Xa activity was 42% higher than for apixaban alone. Following administration of enoxaparin 6 h after apixaban, peak anti-Xa activity was 15% higher than for apixaban alone. In conclusion, enoxaparin had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of apixaban. The increase in anti-Xa activity after co-administration was modest and appeared to be additive. Peak anti-Xa activity increases are mitigated by separating administration of subcutaneous anticoagulation and apixaban when switching between therapies; the potential for pharmacodynamic interaction may be further mitigated by transitioning at the next scheduled dose (12 h)."

The author present an 18-month experience with the use of this therapy for 291 consecutive patients. All the patients fell into the categories of high risk and highest risk for the development of deep vein thrombosis, embolism, or both. Three patients experienced transient DVT-like symptoms and underwent a thorough workup by an independent highly specialized critical care medical team. The results were found ultimately to be inconclusive for DVT and pulmonary embolism. However, all the patients experienced a complete recovery. The results show a 0% incidence of DVT and pulmonary embolism among patients who received enoxeparin as prophylaxis. The medication did not precipitate major bleeding when administered 1 h after surgery. This study offers the first report that describes the use of enoxeparin in aesthetic surgery for high-risk patients. The authors feel the need to inform their colleagues of the benefits obtained over the past 18 months by incorporating this therapy in large-volume liposuction and extensive body-contouring procedures performed during the same operative session.

Initial adequate resuscitation and risk stratification using validated scales remain critical. Intravenous erythromycin improves visualization when likely to find blood in the stomach. Pre-endoscopic proton pump inhibition (PPI) does not improve outcomes, but downstages high-risk endoscopic lesions and may be considered. In patients on anticoagulants, correction of a coagulopathy is recommended, but should not delay early endoscopy (within 24 h), as it improves clinical outcomes. In patients with high-risk endoscopic stigmata, although better than doing nothing, epinephrine injection alone provides suboptimal efficacy and should be combined with another modality such as clips, thermal or sclerosant injection, which are also efficacious alone. Following an attempt at dislodgment, adherent clots can be treated with high-dose intravenous PPI infusion alone (80 mg bolus and 8 mg/h for 3 days) or following endoscopic hemostasis. The combination is indicated for all other patients with high-risk stigmata as there is currently a lack of high-quality generalizable data supporting other intravenous or oral PPI regimens. A second-look endoscopy is recommended only selectively after endoscopic hemostasis. A negative Helicobacter pylori test requires confirmation in the acute setting. Following appropriate discussions, acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) can soon be restarted acutely after bleeding; long-term PPI co-therapy is imperative in patients having bled on nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs if still needed (preferably with a cyclooxygenase-2, if appropriate) or ASA (not clopidogrel alone).

Based on these studies, we implemented a multimodal prophylaxis consisting of a series of safe preventive measures applied before, during, and immediately after surgery to reduce the risk of venous thromboembolism. If these safe preventive measures are strictly observed, postoperative pharmacologic prophylaxis does not need to be aggressive in the patient without predisposing factors who mobilizes promptly, thus diminishing the risk of bleeding associated with the use of anticoagulants and the overall cost of care.

When revascularization is undertaken in the postoperative setting, additional complications may be encountered including postischemic reperfusion injury necessitating prophylactic fasciotomies. The end result is a prolonged postoperative course leading to worse functional outcome. A preoperative history and physical examination performed by the orthopedic surgeon can determine if the patient is at increased risk for vascular complications and whether the at-risk limb can withstand the stress of the operation. Consideration should be given to obtaining ankle-brachial indexes in this patient population, noting that arterial calcification may elevate the value. This article presents a case of an immediate preoperative vascular examination, performed at the time of surgical site marking, in an at-risk patient prior to TKA. We detail the clinical course of a patient with peripheral vascular disease and indwelling superficial femoral artery stent, who developed stent thrombosis in the 2-week period between his last clinic visit and date of surgery, with no change in symptoms. This restenosis was detected on routine preoperative physical examination and resulted in cancellation of the TKA in the preoperative area, allowing the patient to undergo emergent revascularization.

Recommendations exist for VTE prophylaxis (PPX) in medical patients, but current research shows that the utilization of these guidelines is suboptimal. The rates of VTE PPX are lower than recommended rates, and in those patients receiving PPX, the type, dosage, or duration is not in accordance with recognized recommendations. The recommendations and protocols for medical patients that are currently available should be followed, and as new research is developed and reviewed, current practice should be changed to reflect it. The clinical nurse specialist is in a unique position to assimilate the current recommendations into practice and to enhance patient care by virtue of having multiple spheres of influence, capable of influencing institution policy, patient, family, nurse, and physician education, and direct patient care. The VTE PPX is not overused, but underused, and institutions, physicians, and nurses all need to be cognizant of patient risk for VTE with the need to treat prophylactically and initiate PPX according to the American College of Chest Physicians guidelines."

Risk stratification strategies for non-high-risk PE continue to evolve, with an increasing emphasis on clinical prediction rules and right ventricular (RV) assessment on computed tomographic pulmonary angiography. In the field of anticoagulation treatment, pharmacogenetic testing for vitamin K antagonists on top of clinical parameters was not found to offer a significant benefit during the initiation phase; on the other hand, dosing based on the patient's clinical data seems superior to fixed loading regimens. The phase 3 trial programme of new oral anticoagulants in the treatment of venous thrombo-embolism has been completed, and the results indicate that these agents are at least as effective and probably cause less major bleeding than currently standard treatment. A multicentre prospective phase 4 trial will determine whether early discharge and out-of-hospital treatment of low-risk PE with the oral factor Xa inhibitor rivaroxaban is feasible, effective, and safe. For intermediate-risk PE defined on the basis of imaging tests and laboratory biomarkers, the bleeding risks of full-dose thrombolytic treatment appear too high to justify its use, unless clinical signs of haemodynamic decompensation appear.

The incidence of DVT after TKA is 40% to 80% and the incidence of PE is approximately 2%. It is generally agreed that thromboprophylaxis should be used in patients who undergo TKA. Both pharmacological and mechanical methods are used in the prevention of DVT. Pharmacological methods alter the blood coagulation profile and may increase the risk of bleeding complications. When pharmacological methods cannot be used, the mechanical methods become crucial for VTE prophylaxis. Continuous passive motion (CPM) is through an external motorised device which enables a joint to move passively throughout a preset arc of motion. Despite the theoretical effectiveness and widespread use of CPM, there are still differing views on the effectiveness of CPM as prophylaxis against thrombosis after TKA."

CD008201,0,20464888,0,Management of venous Thromboembolism in cancer: a brief review of risk-benefit approaches and guidelines' recommendations.,"Patients with cancer are at substantial risk for morbidity and mortality from venous thromboembolism (VTE). However, the benefits of anticoagulant prophylaxis in preventing VTE morbidity and mortality have to be weighed against the risks of morbidity and mortality associated with major bleeding events. Risk-benefit analyses should take into account that the risk of VTE and risk of bleeding vary among cancer patients based on a number of factors, including patient characteristics and the causes of VTE. Current guidelines for VTE prophylaxis recommend that anticoagulant prophylaxis be considered for all hospitalized patients with cancer and do not recommend routine prophylaxis in ambulatory patients, except in particular high-risk settings. It is generally recommended that anticoagulant prophylaxis be considered for patients with cancer undergoing surgery, although the optimal postoperative duration of treatment remains unclear. Data on the appropriate duration of prophylaxis for recurrent VTE are limited to studies examining 3- or 6-month treatment courses, but guidelines recommend continuing treatment indefinitely in patients with active cancer. Much work remains to be done in designing and implementing strategies for assessing and reducing VTE risk in the oncology population. One issue is that appropriately managing VTE requires that busy clinicians keep in mind a vast number of potential variables exceeding the cognitive capacity of the average person. Hence, there is an urgent need to develop a clinical decision-support system that can help integrate benefits and risks as well as take into account patients' preferences and values in managing VTE."
CD008201,0,23384509,0,Should transesophageal echocardiography be performed in acute stroke patients with atrial fibrillation?,"The diagnostic need for echocardiography in acute stroke patients with documented atrial fibrillation (AF) is controversial because the index stroke per se is an indication for therapeutic anticoagulation according to guidelines. We retrospectively analyzed medical records of 2390 stroke patients consecutively admitted over a 2-year period to three different stroke units at university hospitals in Berlin, Germany. AF was diagnosed in 21.2% (n=506) of 2185 patients with acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack. Overall, 36.6% (n=185) of all AF patients underwent transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) or transthoracic echocardiography within days of hospital admission. According to multivariate analysis, age and in-hospital conventions determined the diagnostic use of TEE in stroke patients with known AF, while the existing cardiovascular risk profile had no impact. Major cardiac sources of embolism were identified by echocardiography in 9.7% (n=18) of all AF patients with acute stroke, including non-AF-related sources of embolism in 3.8% (n=7). However, echocardiographic findings did not result in any therapeutic intervention other than immediate anticoagulation. Furthermore, echocardiographic findings had no impact on the prescription of anticoagulants at hospital discharge or long-term survival. Taken together, our data indicate that diagnostic echocardiography offers only a little additional information and does not impact clinical management and outcome in acute stroke patients with known AF."

CD008201,0,17912165,0,Emergency percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for the care of patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).,"There is general consensus that emergency percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is the preferred treatment for patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), so long as it can be delivered in a timely fashion, by an experienced' operator and cardiac catheterization laboratory (CCL) team. STEMI is both a functional and structural issue. Although it has been recognized since the work of pioneering cardiologists and surgeons in Spokane, Washington, that approximately 88% of patients presenting within 6 hours of onset of STEMI have an occluded coronary artery, it is the pathophysiology of myocardial necrosis, and the varied consequences of necrosis that characterize STEMI. Accordingly, experience' of both primary operator and cardiac catheterization laboratory (CCL) crew, in performing an emergency PCI for STEMI, are as much a function of experience with the treatment of complex MI patients, as experience with coronary intervention. Rapidly achieving normal coronary artery flow, at both the macro and micro vascular levels, is the recognized key to aborting the otherwise progressive wavefront' of myocardial necrosis. The time urgency of decisions (Time is muscle') make emergency PCI for patients with on-going necrosis, more like emergency room (ER) care, than like most in-hospital or outpatient care. In general, most patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) are currently thought to have plaque rupture and/or erosion with subsequent thrombosis and embolization. Consequences of thrombo-embolism, such as slow flow' or no-reflow' are in addition to, the structural (anatomic) considerations of PCI in stable patients (such as ostial location; bifurcation involvement; heavy calcification; tortuosity of lesion or access to it; length of disease; caliber of infarct-artery; etc.). Good quality studies have provided strong support for the specific added value of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors (especially abciximab), dual antiplatelet therapy (the addition of the thienopyridine, clopidogrel, to aspirin use), and bare-metal stents (BMS), for a broad range of STEMI patients. The added value of drug-eluting stents (DES) to bare-metal stents (BMS), primarily in terms of reducing restenosis and repeat revascularization, is supported by several randomized trials, and a number of registries, despite its being off-label' from a regulatory standpoint. The recognition of late stent thrombosis (LST) has raised additional issues, in choosing between these two options for specific STEMI patients. The added value of a number of other mechanical approaches to coronary thrombus, such as thrombus removal devices, and/or distal protection, are more controversial, and perhaps, patient specific. Whether intravascular ultrasound guidance (IVUS) for stent use should be used for the majority, or even a specific minority, of STEMI patients, is also controversial; late-stent thrombosis provides a counter-point. The advantages of developing a network approach to STEMI care, so as to optimize the number of patients receiving timely reperfusion, have been demonstrated in Prague, Denmark, and Minneapolis, among many places. The benefits of both bivalirudin (anti-thrombin drug with efficacy against clot-bound thrombin, which does not appear to stimulate platelets) and abciximab (glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor which is antibody to platelet receptors), as PCI adjuncts generally, and for STEMI patients, in particular, are supported by multiple trials. The specific choice of administering the bolus dose of either, or both, drugs via intra-coronary (IC) injection follows the precedents' of IC thrombolytics, and IC small-vessel vasodilators for no-reflow', but it has not been tested by prospective, randomized trials. Although rapid reperfusion is the first objective, one cannot ignore the other components of the oxygen delivery chain, and the importance of each of these components to on-going delivery of oxygen to all vital organs. A balance must be struck between doing those control' things which serve to stabilize other vital components of the oxygen-delivery chain, without digressing too long from the job of re-establishing brisk coronary flow. The clinical and angiographic heterogeneity of STEMI patients and the array of available therapeutic approaches make it impossible to obtain specific randomized trial direction for many of the clinical decisions in an individual emergency PCI for STEMI. There are a range of reasonable/ appropriate therapeutic choices for a given emergent PCI performed by multiple experienced and competent operators. The treatment of STEMI, and high-risk non-STEMI, patients, by means of emergent PCI, is among the most challenging and rewarding arenas in contemporary medicine."
CD008201,0,26505666,0,Activated prothrombin complex concentrate (FEIBA®) for the treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients with acquired haemophilia: A sequential study.,"Despite anti-haemorrhagic therapy with proper doses of activated prothrombin complex concentrate (aPCC, Feiba®), patients with acquired haemophilia A (AHA) have a considerable risk of recurrent bleeding complications. Evidence in support of the benefit-to-risk ratio of prevention strategies with the use of lower doses of aPCC following the end of the initial treatment period is scarce and inconclusive. We report our experience in the management of 18 consecutive patients with AHA admitted to two Haemophilia centres in Italy. We managed the first 11 according to current guidelines (e.g., with conventional aPCC doses until bleeding resolution). Then, we decided to prolong the treatment beyond bleeding resolution with lower doses of the same concentrate (short-term prophylaxis) in the 7 additional patients. In these patients, the treatment was continued for as long as the titre of FVIII inhibitor was found to decrease by at least 50% when compared to the baseline one. We observed six relapses of bleeding in patients in whom aPCC was confined to the treatment of the qualifying bleeding episode, and none in patients to whom lower doses were administered until the pre-specified decrease in the titre of FVIII inhibitor was achieved. No patients experienced thrombotic complications during the study period. Prolonging the treatment with lower doses of aPCC beyond the initial phase in patients with AHA in whom the titre of FVIII inhibitor is still high is likely to safely prevent further bleeding complications."
CD008201,0,12597232,0,The risk of venous thromboembolism in non-large-joint surgeries.,"The risk of venous thromboembolism, particularly deep venous thrombosis, after knee arthroscopy, surgically assisted arthroscopy, or treatment of lower extremity fracture may be substantial in patients with factors known to increase the risk of postoperative thromboembolism. Few prospective studies have examined the effect of prophylaxis in these patient populations. However, results suggest that routine administration of a low-molecular-weight heparin reduces the rate of deep venous thrombosis in such patients. Additional clinical studies are necessary to determine whether the benefits of prophylaxis outweigh its risks and whether it is cost-effective. Until such data are available, risk for deep venous thrombosis must be assessed in all patients undergoing an orthopedic procedure. Thromboprophylaxis with pharmacologic agents may be considered in those at high risk."
CD008201,0,26324810,0,Developments in the management and treatment of pulmonary embolism.,"Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a serious and costly disease for patients and healthcare systems. Guidelines emphasise the importance of differentiating between patients who are at high risk of mortality (those with shock and/or hypotension), who may be candidates for thrombolytic therapy or surgery, and those with less severe presentations. Recent clinical studies and guidelines have focused particularly on risk stratification of intermediate-risk patients. Although the use of thrombolysis has been investigated in these patients, anticoagulation remains the standard treatment approach. Individual risk stratification directs initial treatment. Rates of recurrence differ between subgroups of patients with PE; therefore, a review of provoking factors, along with the risks of morbidity and bleeding, guides the duration of ongoing anticoagulation. The direct oral anticoagulants have shown similar efficacy and, in some cases, reduced major bleeding compared with standard approaches for acute treatment. They also offer the potential to reduce the burden on patients and outpatient services in the post-hospital phase. Rivaroxaban, dabigatran and apixaban have been shown to reduce the risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism versus placebo, when given for >12 months. Patients receiving direct oral anticoagulants do not require regular coagulation monitoring, but follow-up, ideally in a specialist PE clinic in consultation with primary care providers, is recommended."

All papers describing VTE after shoulder and elbow surgery published in the English language literature before 31 March 2012 were reviewed. A total of 14 papers were available for analysis, most of which were retrospective studies and case series. The incidence of VTE was 0.038% from 92 440 shoulder arthroscopic procedures, 0.52% from 42 261 shoulder replacements, and 0.64% from 4833 procedures for fractures of the proximal humerus (open reduction and internal fixation or hemiarthroplasty). The incidence following replacement of the elbow was 0.26% from 2701 procedures. Diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis and ischaemic heart disease were identified as the major risk factors.The evidence that exists on thromboprophylaxis is based on level III and IV studies, and we therefore cannot make any recommendations on prophylaxis based on the current evidence. It seems reasonable to adopt a multimodal approach that involves all patients receiving mechanical prophylaxis, with chemical prophylaxis reserved for those who are at high risk for VTE."

CD008201,0,26642102,0,"AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF CLINICAL ENDOCRINOLOGISTS, AMERICAN COLLEGE OF ENDOCRINOLOGY, AND ANDROGEN EXCESS AND PCOS SOCIETY DISEASE STATE CLINICAL REVIEW: GUIDE TO THE BEST PRACTICES IN THE EVALUATION AND TREATMENT OF POLYCYSTIC OVARY SYNDROME - PART 2.","Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is recognized as the most common endocrine disorder of reproductive-aged women around the world. This document, produced by the collaboration of the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the Androgen Excess Society aims to highlight the most important clinical issues confronting physicians and their patients with PCOS. It is a summary of current best practices in 2014. Insulin resistance is believed to play an intrinsic role in the pathogenesis of PCOS. The mechanism by which insulin resistance or insulin give rise to oligomenorrhea and hyperandrogenemia, however, is unclear. Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp studies have shown that both obese and lean women with PCOS have some degree of insulin resistance. Insulin resistance is implicated in the ovulatory dysfunction of PCOS by disrupting the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis. Given the association with insulin resistance, all women with PCOS require evaluation for the risk of metabolic syndrome (MetS) and its components, including type 2 diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and the possible risk of clinical events, including acute myocardial infarction and stroke. Obese women with PCOS are at increased risk for MetS with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT; 31 to 35%) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM; 7.5 to 10%). Rates of progression from normal glucose tolerance to IGT, and in turn to T2DM, may be as high as 5 to 15% within 3 years. Data suggest the need for baseline oral glucose tolerance test every 1 to 2 years based on family history of T2DM as well as body mass index (BMI) and yearly in women with IGT. Compared with BMI- and age-matched controls, young, lean PCOS women have lower high-density lipoprotein (HDL) size, higher very-low-density lipoprotein particle number, higher low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particle number, and borderline lower LDL size. Statins have been shown to lower testosterone levels either alone or in combination with oral contraceptives (OCPs) but have not shown improvement in menses, spontaneous ovulation, hirsutism, or acne. Statins reduce total and LDL cholesterol but have no effect on HDL, C-reactive protein, fasting insulin, or homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance in PCOS women, in contrast to the general population. There have been no long-term studies of statins on clinical cardiac outcomes in women with PCOS. Coronary calcification is more prevalent and more severe in PCOS than in controls. In women under 60 years of age undergoing coronary angiography, the presence of polycystic ovaries on sonography has been associated with more arterial segments with >50% stenosis, but the relationship between PCOS and actual cardiovascular events remains unclear. Therapies for PCOS are varied in their effects and targets and include both nonpharmacologic as well as pharmacologic approaches. Weight loss is the primary therapy in PCOS--reduction in weight of as little as 5% can restore regular menses and improve response to ovulation- inducing and fertility medications. Metformin in premenopausal PCOS women has been associated with a reduction in features of MetS. Clamp studies using ethinyl estradiol/drosperinone combination failed to reveal evidence of an increase in either peripheral or hepatic insulin resistance. Subjects with PCOS have a 1.5-times higher baseline risk of venous thromboembolic disease and a 3.7-fold greater effect with OCP use compared with non-PCOS subjects. There is currently no genetic test to screen for or diagnose PCOS, and there is no test to assist in the choice of treatment strategies. Persistent bleeding should always be investigated for pregnancy and/or uterine pathology--including transvaginal ultrasound exam and endometrial biopsy--in women with PCOS. PCOS women can have difficulty conceiving. Those who become pregnant are at risk for gestational diabetes (which should be evaluated and managed appropriately) and the microvascular complications of diabetes. Assessment of a woman with PCOS for infertility involves evaluating for preconceptional issues that may affect response to therapy or lead to adverse pregnancy outcomes and evaluating the couple for other common infertility issues that may affect the choice of therapy, such as a semen analysis. Women with PCOS have multiple factors that may lead to an elevated risk of pregnancy, including a high prevalence of IGT--a clear risk factor for gestational diabetes--and MetS with hypertension, which increases the risk for pre-eclampsia and placental abruption. Women should be screened and treated for hypertension and diabetes prior to attempting conception. Women should be counseled about weight loss prior to attempting conception, although there are limited clinical trial data demonstrating a benefit to this recommendation. Treatment for women with PCOS and anovulatory infertility should begin with an oral agent such as clomiphene citrate or letrozole, an aromatase inhibitor."

CD008201,0,19404531,0,Role of antithrombin concentrate in treatment of hereditary antithrombin deficiency. An update.,"Antithrombin (AT) functions as a potent natural anticoagulant and serine protease inhibitor that inactivates many enzymes in the coagulation cascade. Antithrombin also possesses antiinflammatory properties, many of which are mediated by its actions as an anticoagulant. Hereditary AT deficiency is a rare, underrecognised medical condition that is associated with inadequate endogenous anticoagulation thought to result from impaired inhibition of serine protease coagulation factors. Inherited as an autosomal dominant trait, congenital AT deficiency typically reduces functional AT levels to 40-60% of normal. As a result, individuals with hereditary AT deficiency have a > or = 50% lifetime risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Specifically, AT deficiency is associated with a three- to seven-fold higher risk of VTE compared with other thrombophilias. Thus, maintaining adequate levels of AT during high-risk periods is an important treatment goal. Long-term anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis is not recommended in asymptomatic patients with AT deficiency because of the increased risk of haemorrhage. However, treatment guidelines recommend short-term thromboprophylaxis in high-risk clinical settings, including surgery, trauma, and management of pregnancy, labour, and delivery. The goal of treatment for patients with hereditary AT deficiency is an initial increase in AT activity to > or = 120% of normal levels followed by maintenance of AT activity at > or = 80% of normal levels. Plasma-derived AT, heparin, fresh frozen plasma, and human recombinant AT are treatment options for individuals with hereditary AT deficiency. The objective of this review is to discuss hereditary AT deficiency and the role of AT replacement therapy in the treatment of patients with this congenital disorder."

CD008201,0,15598642,0,Preventing venous thromboembolism in medical patients.,"Given the increased number of patients hospitalized for acute medical illnesses and the associated risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), the use of prophylaxis has become a public health matter. Thromboprophylaxis is not widely practiced in acutely ill medical patients, due in part to the heterogeneity of this group and the perceived difficulty in assessing those who would most benefit from treatment. Nevertheless, the results of recent well-conducted clinical trials support the evidence-based recommendations for more widespread systematic use of low-dose low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) or unfractionated heparin (UFH) in this population. Three large well-controlled studies (MEDENOX, PREVENT, and ARTEMIS) in acutely ill medical patients confirm previous findings that different at-risk patient populations show a consistent 50% reduction in VTE events with LMWH and fondaparinux. A meta-analysis in nearly 5000 patients in internal medicine comparing UFH and LMWH revealed a trend for reduction of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism with LMWH. Based on duration of use in clinical trials in acutely ill medical patients, prophylactic treatment with UFH and LMWH is recommended for 2 weeks."
CD008201,0,20865688,0,The 'chest pain kit' study: A 'pill in the pocket' concept to improve the pre-hospital therapy of acute coronary syndrome.,"The 'pill in the pocket' concept is an established therapy for atrial fibrillation. The current guidelines for the management of patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction endorse the concept that faster time to reperfusion is associated with important reductions in morbidity and mortality. The mechanical reperfusion and outcome of these patients is significantly supported by dual antiplatelet therapy. There is no data comparing the effect of early self-application by the patient ('pill in the pocket') versus application by the emergency doctor of dual antiplatelet therapy and a factor Xa inhibitor in case of severe chest pain. In patients with a high risk of developing an acute coronary syndrome and previously selected by a cardiologist, early self-application of dual antiplatelet therapy and a factor Xa inhibitor (e.g. fondaparinux) immediately after calling the emergency doctor might be of significance in cases of acute coronary syndrome or pulmonary embolism. In particular, in less developed areas where it might take a long time for the emergency doctor to arrive, this 'pill in the pocket' concept may be significant."

CD008201,0,23426236,0,Should all acutely ill medical patients be treated with antithrombotic drugs? A review of the interventional trials.,"After reports from observational studies suggesting an association between acutely ill medical patients and venous thromboembolism (VTE), interventional trials with anticoagulants drugs have demonstrated a significant reduction of VTE during and immediately after hospitalisation. Although several guidelines suggest the clinical relevance of reducing this outcome, there is a low tendency to use anticoagulants in patients hospitalised for acute medical illness. We speculated that such underuse may be dependent on a low perception that patients included in the trials are actually at risk of thromboembolism. Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyse the clinical settings included in the interventional trials and their relationship with thrombotic risk. Analysis of interventional trials revealed that the majority of patients included in the trials (about 80%) were affected by heart failure, acute respiratory syndrome or infections. Among these three illnesses, literature data shows an association with venous thrombosis only in patients with acute infections; this finding was, however, supported only by retrospective study. On the contrary, there is scarce or no evidence that heart failure and acute respiratory syndrome are associated with venous thrombosis. These data underscore the need of better defining the thrombotic risk profile of acutely ill medical patients included in interventional trials with anticoagulants."

Aspirin used alone or in combination with other antiplatelet drugs has been shown to offer significant benefit to patients at high risk of vascular events. Resistance to the action of aspirin may decrease this benefit. Aspirin resistance has been defined by clinical and/or laboratory criteria; however, detection by laboratory methods prior to experiencing a clinical event will likely provide the greatest opportunity for intervention. Numerous laboratory methods with different cutoff points have been used to evaluate the resistance. Noncompliance with aspirin treatment has also confounded studies. A single assay is currently insufficient to establish resistance. Combinations of results to confirm compliance and platelet inhibition may identify ""at-risk"" individuals who truly have aspirin resistance. The most effective strategy for managing patients with aspirin resistance is unknown; however, studies are currently underway to address this issue."

CD008201,0,21822526,0,Risk of venous thromboembolism and primary prophylaxis in cancer. Should all patients receive thromboprophylaxis?,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common complication in patients with cancer that causes significant morbidity and mortality. Several patient-, tumour- and treatment-related risk factors for VTE in cancer patients have been identified. An effective and safe thromboprophylaxis in cancer patients at high risk of VTE is desirable. Recently, the identification of potential biomarkers and the development of risk scoring models for prediction of cancer-associated VTE have been published. Whether primary VTE prophylaxis based on risk assessment through these biomarkers and risk prediction models might be useful, is currently not yet known. However, thromboprophylaxis is clearly indicated in high-risk situations. While VTE prophylaxis is recommended in cancer patients undergoing surgery and in hospitalised patients with acute disease, studies in ambulatory cancer patients are still rare and evidence for primary VTE prophylaxis is currently limited. In this review, risk factors associated with VTE in cancer patients and current approaches of thromboprophylaxis in different settings, specifically in ambulatory cancer patients are subjected to a critical evaluation."
CD008201,0,18783081,0,[Glycemic control in the coronary care unit: prognostic value and new therapeutic strategies].,"Type 2 diabetes and acute coronary syndromes are widely interconnected. Individuals with type 2 diabetes are more likely than non-diabetic subjects to experience silent or manifest episodes of myocardial ischemia as the first presentation of coronary artery disease. Insulin resistance, inflammation, microvascular disease and a tendency to thrombosis are common in these patients. Intensive blood glucose control with intravenous insulin infusion has been demonstrated to significantly reduce morbidity and mortality in critically ill hyperglycemic patients admitted to an intensive care unit. Direct glucose toxicity likely plays a crucial role in explaining the clinical benefits of intensive insulin therapy in such critical patients. However, the difficult implementation of nurse-driven protocols for insulin infusion, able to achieve more rapid and effective blood glucose control without significant episodes of hypoglycemia, has led physicians to consider alternative drugs for this purpose. New intravenous or oral agents include the incretin glucagon-like peptide-1, its analogs, and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, which potentiate the activity of glucagon-like peptide-1 and thus enhance glucose-dependent insulin secretion. Improved glycemic control with protective effects on myocardial and vascular tissue, with lesser side effects and a better therapeutic compliance may represent an important therapeutic potential for this class of drugs in acutely ill patients in general, and in patients with acute coronary syndromes in particular. Such drugs should be known by practicing cardiologists for their possible use in intensive care units in the years to come."

Laboratory evaluation of thrombophilia can help to better identify patients at higher risk for venous thromboembolic disease, and newer methods that test for genetic factors continue to evolve; however, more research is needed to justify routine testing for thrombophilia. Research studies have yielded differing results in determining the most appropriate prophylactic regimen. Both pharmaceutical and mechanical treatments are commonly used for prophylaxis. New pharmacologic prophylaxes include the Xa inhibitor rivaroxaban and the thrombin inhibitor dabigatran etexilate. The newest mechanical device used to prevent venous thromboembolism is a miniature, mobile, battery-operated pneumatic system called Continuous Enhanced Circulation Therapy. The American College of Chest Physicians guidelines and the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons clinical guideline were reviewed to directly compare specific agents and balance the risks of venous thromboembolism.

CD008201,0,9601867,0,[The role of D-dimer determination in clinical evaluation with pulmonary perfusion scintigraphy].,"The diagnosis of pulmonary embolism is even in contemporary clinical practice problematical. Pulmonary angiography is used in our departments very little due to its invasive character. The method of choice for diagnosis remains therefore perfusion scintigraphy of the lungs, in this country frequently without ventilation scintigraphy as it is not available in the majority of our departments of nuclear medicine. In recent years in the diagnostic algorithms also assessment of D-dimers was started, i.e. assessment of products of fibrinolysis assessed by monoclonal antibodies. The authors tried to find out how many patients admitted to the medical department for diagnosis of pulmonary embolization may have a false positive diagnosis on the basis of pulmonary scintigraphy. During the period III/96 to V/96 a total of 18 patients from the medical clinic with suspected pulmonary embolism were examined where the value of D-dimers(latex test) was assessed and at the same time perfusion scintigraphy was performed. With regard to the highly negative predictive value of D-dimer assessment the authors focused their attention on patients with a suspect or positive lung scan (i.e. treated on account of pulmonary embolism) while D-dimers were negative. Of 13 patients with suspect or possible pulmonary embolism, as assessed by scintigraphy, four had negative dimers(30%). With regard to the 90% reported negative predictive value, based on the literature, thus three of these patients were unnecessarily admitted to hospital and treated. The authors assume that assessment of D-dimers should be part of the examination protocol due to its non-pretentious character and low price as compared with costs of hospitalization."

This study was designed to evaluate a combined pharmacologic approach to the prophylaxis of postoperative deep venous thrombosis (DVT) by mediating at least two and probably three of Virchow's predisposing factors. Patients 40 years of age and older undergoing operations greater than 45 minutes under general anesthesia were placed in one of five treatment groups and studied by a prospective randomized, double-blind protocol. Study drugs were the following: (1) 0.5 mg of dihydroergotamine plus 5000 IU of sodium heparin (DHE 5000), (2) 0.5 mg DHE plus 2500 IU heparin (DHE 2500), (3) 5000 IU of HEP (HEP 5000), (4) 0.5 mg of DHE (DHE 0.5), and (5) a placebo. Study medications were administered 2 hours preoperatively and continuously thereafter every 12 hours postoperatively subcutaneously in the anterior abdominal wall for 5 to 7 days or until a positive radiofibrinogen uptake test (RFUT). The RFUT was performed according to standardized technique and was used to establish the presence or absence of DVT. This report is an analysis of the major subgroup of patients undergoing intra-abdominal operations. Results showed a highly statistically significant prophylactic benefit from DHE 5000 compared with the placebo (p less than 0.003) and all other treatment groups (p less than 0.05). There was no significant benefit from DHE 2500, HEP 5000 (p greater than 0.13), and DHE 0.5 (p greater than 0.3). All patients who entered the study had two or more risk factors for postoperative DVT, and high-risk patients were distributed equally throughout all treatment groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD008201,0,26989461,0,Primary prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolic events in patients with gastrointestinal cancers - Review.,"Venous thromboembolism event (VTE) is a common and morbid complication in cancer patients. Patients with gastrointestinal cancers often suffer from symptomatic or incidental splanchnic vein thrombosis, impaired liver function and/or thrombocytopenia. These characteristics require a thorough risk/benefit evaluation for individual patients. Considering the risk factors for the development of VTE and bleeding events in addition to recent study results may be helpful for correct initiation of primary pharmacological prevention and treatment of cancer-associated thrombosis (CAT), preferably with low molecular weight heparins (LMWH). Whereas thromboprophylaxis is most often recommended in hospitalized surgical and non-surgical patients with malignancy, there is less agreement as to its duration. With regard to ambulatory cancer patients, the lack of robust data results in low grade recommendations against routine use of anticoagulant drugs. Anticoagulation with LMWH for the first months is the evidence-based treatment for acute CAT, but duration of secondary prevention and the drug of choice are unclear. Based on published guidelines and literature, this review will focus on prevention and treatment strategies of VTE in patients with gastrointestinal cancers."

The article adds to the body of published literature relating to patient risk assessment for VTE by exploring practical clinical perspectives of introducing a sustainable risk assessment process. It reports on a series of small scale changes carried out during a project in an acute medicine unit at the Heart of England NHS Foundation Trust in Birmingham, which aimed to improve the level of compliance with carrying out VTE risk assessments and administering prophylaxis. The results of two audits conducted over a seven-month period at the beginning and end of the project illustrate an improvement in compliance from 6.25% to 62.5%. The article concludes that leadership from medical consultants acting as clinical champions is imperative and that nurses and healthcare assistants also have a pivotal role in promoting patient assessments, and in maintaining the momentum and sustainability of VTE risk assessments in clinical areas."

CD008201,0,25839991,0,Usefulness of platelet function tests to predict bleeding with antithrombotic medications.,"The pharmacological inhibition of platelets has always been regarded as a double-edged sword: the challenge of balancing the antithrombotic effect against the bleeding risk. Potent antiplatelet agents and novel oral anticoagulants, sometimes in combination, are increasingly used in the treatment of cardiovascular disease and for thromboprophylaxis in atrial fibrillation. Although such treatment has reduced the risk of thrombotic events, the potential for major bleeding has increased, and a technique to identify those at increased bleeding risk is greatly needed. Platelet function tests (PFTs), most frequently VerifyNow and also the vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein -phosphorylation assay, have been used to identify low on-treatment platelet reactivity, to identify individuals who may be at increased bleeding risk. Such results predict nuisance bleeding, but many individuals have low on-treatment platelet reactivity and yet do not exhibit major or even minor bleeding. Although PFTs may be useful in assessing populations, they do not allow identification of individual patients at risk of bleeding on either antiplatelet or novel oral anticoagulant therapy, nor do they allow the tailoring of such therapy to optimize the risk:benefit ratio. Thrombin plays a cardinal role in both arterial thrombus formation and hemostasis, yet most PFTs fail to assess the contribution of thrombin, because they employ anticoagulated blood. Techniques such as the calibrated automated thrombogram and the point-of-care global thrombosis test, performed on native blood, which measure endogenous thrombin potential, seem to show the most promise for profiling bleeding risk, as tests that most physiologically assess the effects of medications on thrombin."

CD008201,0,23213505,0,Anti-phospholipid antibodies in patients undergoing total joint replacement surgery.,"Background. Patients undergoing joint replacement remain at increased risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE) compared to other types of surgery, regardless of thromboprophylactic regimen. The pathophysiologic processes rendering this group of patients at risk for VTE are multifactorial. Procedure-specific and patient-specific exposures play a role in the postoperative development of VTE, including the development of anti-phospholipid antibodies (aPL). Methods. We measured three aPL (anti-cardiolipin, anti-β(2) glycoprotein, and lupus anticoagulant) in 123 subjects undergoing total knee or hip arthroplasty to describe the presence of these antibodies preoperatively and to describe the rate of postoperative seroconversion among those people who were negative preoperatively. Postoperative antibodies were measured at day 7, 14, and 21. Results. The prevalence of aPL antibodies in the preoperative period was 44%, positive subjects were more likely to be smokers (P = 0.05) and were less likely to have undergone a previous arthroplasty procedure (P = 0.002). Subjects seroconverted in a 21 day postoperative period at a rate of 79%. Conclusions. These pilot data suggest that the prevalence of aPL in this population both preoperatively and postoperatively is higher than previously expected. Further studies are needed to describe aPL in a larger population and to establish their clinical significance in populations undergoing joint replacement surgeries."

When all cancer patients are considered together, a sevenfold increased risk for VTE has been calculated. Over the last 20 years, a number of risk factors have been recognized. These have been used in several risk assessment models aimed at identifying high-risk patients who are therefore candidates for thromboprophylaxis. An easily applicable and reliable risk score is based on the cancer site, hemoglobin levels, pre-chemotherapy platelet and leukocyte counts as well as body mass index. The additional measurement of two biomarkers, namely D-dimer and soluble P-selectin, may improve estimates of the cumulative VTE probability. A variable incidence of VTE has been determined in patients with specific types of malignancy, with the highest odds in those with pancreatic cancer followed by head and neck tumors. In terms of histotype, the risk of VTE is significantly higher in patients with adenocarcinoma than in those with squamous cell carcinoma and in patients with high-grade versus low-grade tumors. Cancer therapy may also be responsible for VTE; specifically, the presence of an indwelling central venous catheter, immunomodulatory drugs such as thalidomide and lenalidomide, monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, erythropoiesis-stimulating agents and hormonal therapy with tamoxifen place patients at higher risk. The pathogenesis of cancer-related VTE is poorly understood but is likely to be multifactorial. ""Virchow's triad,"" comprising stasis consequent to a decreased blood flow rate, an enhanced blood clotting tendency such as accompanies inflammation and growth factor expression, and structural modifications in blood vessel walls, is thought to play a central role in the induction of VTE. The prophylaxis and treatment of VTE are based on well-established drugs such as vitamin K antagonists and unfractionated and low-molecular-weight heparins as well as on an expanding group of new oral anticoagulants, including fondaparinux, rivaroxaban, apixaban and dabigatran. Furthermore, aspirin has been shown to prevent arterial thrombosis and to reduce the rate of major vascular events. Guidelines for the general management of VTE in cancer patients and in those with an indwelling central venous catheter have been recently developed with the aim of selecting the most rational therapeutic approach for each clinical situation. The main features of VTE based on our own observations of 92 cancer patients and 159 patients with non-neoplastic disease are briefly described herein."

The present multicentre study prospectively assessed a prophylaxis strategy, based on a risk score, in pregnancies with increased risk of VTE. Among 286 patients included in the study, 183 had a personal history of VTE (63.98%) and 191 patients (66.8%) had a thrombophilia marker. Eighty nine (46.6%) thrombophilic women had a personal history of VTE. Patients were assigned to one of three prophylaxis strategies according to the risk scoring system. In postpartum, all patients received low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) prophylaxis for at least 6 weeks. In antepartum, LMWH prophylaxis was prescribed to 61.8% of patients with high risk of VTE. Among them, 37.7% were treated in the third trimester only and 24.1% were treated throughout pregnancy. In this cohort, one antepartum-related VTE (0.35%) and two postpartum-related VTE (0.7%) occurred. No case of pulmonary embolism was observed during the study period. The rate of serious bleeding was 0.35%. There was no evidence of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia or osteoporosis.

CD008201,0,17323033,0,[Diagnosis and treatment of acute pulmonary embolism].,"Only in one fourth to one third of patients admitted for suspected acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is PE objectively confirmed, implying that symptoms and clinical findings of acute PE are nonspecific. Clinical pretest probability for PE may be estimated on the basis of validated clinical scores. A low clinical pretest probability and a negative D-dimer value allow exclusion of PE without further imaging procedure. Among imaging techniques, multislice CT scanning has become the preferred method to visualize PE. Alternatively, a combination of clinical pretest probability, D-dimer value and a perfusion/ventilation scan may be performed. The majority of patients presenting with acute segmental or subsegmental PE are hemodynamically stable. Right ventricular function may, however, be disturbed, and an echocardiography should be performed, therefore. Anticoagulation initiated with unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparins or with the pentasaccharide fondaparinux overlapping with oral anticoagulation using vitamin K antagonists is the standard therapy for hemodynamically stable patients without major right ventricular dysfunction. A transthoracic echocardiography should be performed without delay in patients with suspected central PE and a positive shock index of > or = 1.0 to determine right ventricular function. When major right ventricular dysfunction is found due to central massive PE, immediate performance of surgical or catheter-guided embolectomy or thrombolysis should be considered."
CD008201,0,19858963,0,Venous thromboembolism: pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions.,"The formation of blood clots is a significant threat to individuals with limited mobility, whether in the hospital or recovering in an outpatient setting. Prevention of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism has been found to be cost-effective when compared with treating an existing thrombosis. Despite these positive findings, compliance with the clinical practice guidelines is less than ideal. The National Consensus Standards for the Prevention and Care of Deep Vein Thrombosis Project identified 4 domains to address the problem of noncompliance related to venous thromboembolism: risk assessment, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment.The objective of treating an existing deep vein thrombosis is to prevent further extension of the clot. Pharmacological interventions for both prevention and treatment include unfractionated heparin, low-molecular-weight heparin, selective factor Xa inhibitors, and vitamin K antagonists; nonpharmacological interventions include mechanical measures, such as inferior vena cava filters, graduated compression stockings, and intermittent pneumatic compression devices. Pharmacological interventions interfere with various factors of the coagulation cascade. An adverse effect commonly associated with these drugs is excessive bleeding. The mechanism of action surrounding mechanical interventions is to increase venous return and decrease the risk of pooling of blood in the leg veins. These interventions are effective only if implemented. Clinical application of clinical practice guidelines is imperative to protect patients at risk."

Consequently, specific recommendations have been made for the initial anticoagulation management of these patients in both product labels and AWMF treatment recommendations: some drugs should not be used in these patients, for other drugs a careful use, intensified screening (anti-Xa), or, in the case of enoxaparin, a dose-adjustment are recommended.This literature review aimed to answer the following questions: · What is the prevalence of renal insufficiency in VTE patients?. · Which data are available with regard to the real-world initial anticoagulation management and corresponding clinical outcomes (recurrent VTE events, bleedings, mortality) of these patients?"
CD008201,0,12052268,0,Early use of statins in acute coronary syndromes.,"This review examines the use of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin) medications early in the clinical course of acute coronary syndrome.

Numerous previous studies have documented the primary and secondary benefits of statins in the prevention of coronary events. Recent trials show that when statins are used during hospital admissions for acute coronary syndrome (ACS), patients experience decreased recurrent myocardial infarction, lower death rates, and fewer repeat hospitalizations for ischemia or revascularization. Several studies suggest that the positive effects of statins on plaque stabilization, inflammation, thrombosis, and endothelial function may be independent of lipid levels. There is also an emerging view that beneficial lipid-lowering with statins in high-risk patients has no lower limit. This information suggests that all patients admitted for ACS should be treated with statins, regardless of cholesterol levels."

During follow-up, the venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk increased with age in both treatment groups. In patients with age >75 years, those who received extended-duration enoxaparin had lower incidence of VTE (2.5% vs 6.7%; absolute difference [AD] [95% confidence interval]: -4.2% [-6.5, -2.0]), proximal deep-vein thrombosis (2.5% vs 6.6%; AD -4.1% [-6.2, -2.0]), and symptomatic VTE (0.3% vs 1.5%; AD -1.2% [-2.2, -0.3]), in comparison to those who received placebo.

CD008201,0,15726600,0,Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in medically ill patients and the development of strategies to improve prophylaxis rates.,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is common but often unrecognized in medically ill patients. Over the past 5 years, three large-scale placebo-controlled trials enrolling a total of 5500 medically ill patients have highlighted the risk of VTE in this group. These trials have helped to define a specific at-risk patient profile, including those admitted to the hospital with severe congestive heart failure, respiratory illness, acute infection, and inflammatory bowel disease. We performed a retrospective review of patients admitted to the medical service at our tertiary care center to define how common the at-risk medical patient is and to evaluate and improve prophylaxis rates in this patient group. The study was conducted in two phases. Based on admission characteristics, patients were stratified into high-risk or low-risk groups for the development of VTE. During the pre-intervention phase, 75% of patients admitted to the medical service were characterized as increased risk for VTE, yet only 43% of these high-risk patients received prophylaxis of any sort. After interventions designed to increase awareness of VTE, we conducted a second review period. In this post-intervention phase, where 79% of patients were at risk for VTE, prophylaxis rates improved to 72%. Based on these results, we conclude that the majority of patients admitted to the medical service at our tertiary care center constitute a high-risk population that warrants consideration for VTE prophylaxis. Implementation of strategies to improve prophylaxis rates, including educational sessions and risk stratification guidelines, can be successful and improve identification and prophylaxis of this population."

Data were collected for a 2007 University HealthSystem Consortium Deep Vein Thrombosis/Pulmonary Embolism (DVT/PE) Benchmarking Project that explored VTE in AMCs. Prophylaxis was considered appropriate based on 2004 American College of Chest Physicians guidelines. A total of 33 AMCs from 30 states participated. In all, 48% of patients received guideline-directed prophylaxis-59% were medical and 41% were surgical patients. VTE history was more common among medical patients with guideline-directed prophylaxis. Surgical patients admitted from the emergency department and with higher illness severity were more likely to receive appropriate prophylaxis. Despite guidelines, VTE prophylaxis remains underutilized in these US AMCs, particularly among surgical patients. Because AMCs provide the majority of physician training and should reflect and set care standards, this appears to be an opportunity for practice and quality improvement and for education."
CD008201,0,20062740,0,Lipoprotein glomerulopathy treated with LDL-apheresis (Heparin-induced Extracorporeal Lipoprotein Precipitation system): a case report.,"Lipoprotein glomerulopathy is a glomerulonephritis which was described for the first time by Saito in 1989 and is currently acknowledged as a separate nosological entity. It is histologically characterized by a marked dilatation of the glomerular capillaries and the presence of lipoprotein thrombi in the glomerular lumens. The dyslipidemic profile is similar to that of type III dyslipoproteinemia with Apolipoprotein E values that are often high; proteinuria and renal dysfunction are present. Proteinuria often does not respond to steroid and cytostatic treatments. The phenotypic expression of lipoprotein glomerulopathy is most probably correlated to a genetic alteration of the lipoprotein metabolism (mutation of the Apolipoprotein E coding gene). In literature, lipoprotein glomerulopathies have mainly been reported in Japanese and Chinese subjects, except for three cases in the Caucasian race, reported in France and the USA."
CD008201,0,15321483,0,Intrapartum care for women on full anticoagulation.,"Women requiring full anticoagulation in pregnancy and labour present their care providers with complex management problems, particularly during the peripartum period. Available guidelines often fail to address the practical issues of balancing the risks of recurrent thrombotic events and haemorrhage during labour. This is especially the case in women at high risk of recurrent thromboembolism, in whom the usually recommended temporary peripartum reduction in the level of anticoagulation may be considered unsafe. In order to achieve a satisfactory outcome without undue intervention, multidisciplinary management involving obstetricians, haematologists and anaesthetists is essential. Intrapartum care plans should be made during pregnancy to address the conduct of labour and delivery, anticoagulation, analgesia in labour and the management of any arising obstetric, anaesthetic or haematological complications. In the following we address the practical issues requiring particular attention, as well as management options, in fully anticoagulated patients using a clinical case for illustration."

CD008201,0,24338124,0,Reconsidering the switch from low-molecular-weight heparin to unfractionated heparin during pregnancy.,"Venous thromboembolic disease accounts for 9% of all maternal deaths in the United States. In patients at risk for thrombosis, common practice is to start prophylactic doses of low-molecular-weight heparin and transition to unfractionated heparin during the third trimester, with the perception that administration of neuraxial anesthesia will be safer while on unfractionated heparin, as spinal/epidural hematomas have been associated with recent use of low-molecular-weight heparin. In patients receiving prophylactic doses of unfractionated heparin, neuraxial anesthesia may be placed, provided the dose used is 5,000 units twice a day. The American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine guidelines recognize that the safety of neuraxial anesthesia in patients receiving more than 10,000 units per day or more than 2 doses per day is unknown, limiting the theoretical benefit of unfractionated heparin at doses higher than 5,000 units twice a day."
CD008201,0,21833448,0,Disease burden and unmet needs for prevention of venous thromboembolism in medically ill patients in Europe show underutilisation of preventive therapies.,"It was the aim of this review to assess the incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and current practice patterns for VTE prophylaxis among medical patients with acute illness in Europe. A literature search was conducted on the epidemiology and prophylaxis practices of VTE prevention among adult patients treated in-hospital for major medical conditions. A total of 21 studies with European information published between 1999 and April 2010 were retrieved. Among patients hospitalised for an acute medical illness, the incidence of VTE varied between 3.65% (symptomatic only over 10.9 days) and 14.9% (asymptomatic and symptomatic over 14 days). While clinical guidelines recommend pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis for patients admitted to hospital with an acute medical illness who are bedridden, clear identification of specific risk groups who would benefit from VTE prophylaxis is lacking. In the majority of studies retrieved, prophylaxis was under-used among medical inpatients; 21% to 62% of all patients admitted to the hospital for acute medical illnesses did not receive VTE prophylaxis. Furthermore, among patients who did receive prophylaxis, a considerable proportion received medication that was not in accord with guidelines due to short duration, suboptimal dose, or inappropriate type of prophylaxis. In most cases, the duration of VTE prophylaxis did not exceed hospital stay, the mean duration of which varied between 5 and 11 days. In conclusion, despite demonstrated efficacy and established guidelines supporting VTE prophylaxis, utilisation rates and treatment duration remain suboptimal, leaving medical patients at continued risk for VTE. Improved guideline adherence and effective care delivery among the medically ill are stressed."

The authors compared methods of risk assessment and their implications for risk communication and treatment.
CD008201,0,20839678,0,DVT prophylaxis: better living through chemistry: affirms.,"Venous thromboembolism remains the most common cause of hospital readmission and death after total joint arthroplasty. The 2008 American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) guidelines, based on prospective randomized clinical trials with a venography endpoint, endorse the use of low-molecular-weight heparin, fondaparinux, or adjusted dose warfarin (target international normalized ratio, 2.5; range, 2-3) for up to 35 days after total hip arthroplasty (THA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA). In the past, the ACCP has recommended against the use of aspirin, graduated compression stockings, or venous compression devices as the sole means of prophylaxis, but in 2008 they first recommended the ""optimal use of mechanical thromboprophylaxis with venous foot pumps or intermittent pneumatic compression devices"" in patients undergoing total joint arthroplasty who ""have a high risk of bleeding."" When the high risk subsides, pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis is substituted for, or added to, mechanical methods. Fractionated heparins and pentasaccharide are the most effective agents in reducing venographic deep venous thrombosis (DVT) after total joint arthroplasty with residual clot rates <5% after THA and 20% after TKA, but major or clinically meaningful bleeding occurs in 3% to 5% of patients. Newer Xa and thrombin inhibitors enjoy greater efficacy with equal or higher bleeding rates. Low-intensity warfarin (target international normalized ratio, 2.0) combines safety (bleeding rates <1%) with efficacy (readmission for clinical DVT or pulmonary embolism 0.2%) after total joint arthroplasty. Warfarin represents a therapeutic compromise by preventing clinical events in exchange for a lower bleeding rate; genetic testing will likely simplify warfarin use and reduce outlier responders."
CD008201,0,20805424,0,Preprinted standardized orders promote venous thromboembolism prophylaxis compared with traditional handwritten orders: an endorsement of standardized evidence-based practice.,"The objective was to determine if a standardized process of care--namely, standardized evidence-based medical orders (SEBMOs)--improves physician compliance with venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis. A total of 61 physicians received information about VTE prophylaxis after introduction of an admission SEBMO. Hospitalists received enhanced presentations about SEBMOs and their value in VTE prevention; specialists did not. Data were analyzed for 2 cohorts of 249 at-risk patients: one cohort was admitted with SEBMOs and the other with handwritten orders. VTE prophylaxis was ordered for 70% (173 of 249) of the SEBMO cohort compared with 22% (55 of 249) of patients whose physicians handwrote orders (relative risk ratio = 2.97; 95% confidence interval = 2.33-3.79; P < .0001). Specialists, who did not receive the enhanced education, were more likely to use handwritten orders and less likely to comply with prophylaxis standards. Standardized orders promote VTE prophylaxis more than handwritten orders. More rigorous education is required to promote compliance with evidence-based standards of medical practice."

By a focused history-taking, physical examination, and application of current evidence-based guidelines in cardiac risk assessments, patients at high risk for complications at surgery can be identified and additional work-up suggested. Effective preoperative recommendation includes an assessment of risk (cardiac and non-cardiac), recommendations on medication adjustment, thrombo-embolic prophylaxis, and use of perioperative beta blockers.

CD008201,0,24366976,0,Economic implications of inadequate treatment of venous thromboembolism and potential solutions.,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common and serious medical complication among medical and surgical patients, both in the hospital and postdischarge. Patients with venous stasis or vascular damage or those with underlying hypercoagulable disorders, including cancer, are at risk of developing VTE. The clinical consequences of inadequate treatment of VTE can result in significant patient morbidity and mortality. The direct health care costs and indirect societal costs related to VTE and its complications are high. Traditional anticoagulants can reduce recurrent VTE but they present costly management challenges. Oral anticoagulants currently in development offer simpler management compared with the established agents, potentially resulting in improved adherence with VTE treatment regimens and better outcomes. Reductions in recurrent VTE and its associated complications could translate into reduced direct and indirect costs."
CD008201,0,25819537,0,Prevention of gastrointestinal events in patients on antithrombotic therapy in the peri-endoscopy period: review of new evidence and recommendations from recent guidelines.,"Management of patients on antithrombotic therapy undergoing endoscopic procedures can be challenging. Although guidelines from major gastrointestinal endoscopy societies provide useful recommendations in this regard, data are limited concerning the bleeding risk of new complex endoscopic procedures and the management of novel anticoagulants in patients needing invasive procedures. The approach to the management of antithrombotic therapy often needs to be formulated on an individual basis, especially in patients with high thrombotic risk undergoing a high-risk endoscopic procedure. In addition to the procedure-related bleeding risk, endoscopists also need to consider the urgency of the endoscopic procedure, the thromboembolic risk of the patient if antithrombotic therapy is temporarily withheld, and the timing of discontinuation/resumption of antithrombotic therapy in the decision-making process. Diagnostic endoscopic procedures with or without biopsy can often be done without interruption of antithrombotic therapy. If possible, elective procedures with high bleeding risk should be delayed in patients on antithrombotic therapy for conditions with high thrombotic risk. If high-risk procedures cannot be delayed in these patients, thienopyridines, traditional and novel anticoagulants are usually withheld, whereas aspirin withdrawal is decided on a case by case basis. In patients with high thrombotic risk, communication with the prescribing clinician before proceeding to procedures with high bleeding risk is particularly important in optimizing the peri-procedural management plan of antithrombotic therapy."

CD008201,0,18313480,0,Reperfusion strategies in acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction: an overview of current status.,"Several randomized trials and meta-analyses have shown that primary angioplasty is superior to thrombolysis in the treatment of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (MI) in terms of death, reinfarction, and stroke. However, primary angioplasty should be regarded as the preferred strategy as long as it can not be applied with a reasonable time delay to treatment, as compared with the administration of thrombolysis. In fact, time-to-treatment has been shown to be a determinant of survival not only for thrombolysis but also for primary angioplasty. Recent guidelines consider a time from first medical contact to PCI of 90 minutes or a PCI-related delay of 60 minutes as reasonable cutoffs to identify the best reperfusion strategy. The beneficial effects of primary angioplasty could be expected particularly after the first 3 hours from symptom onset, when thrombolysis, particularly streptokinase, may be less effective, whereas within the first 3 hours, thrombolysis (started in the prehospital setting, preferably) may represent a valid therapeutic option. Because the survival benefits of primary angioplasty depends on the patient's risk profile and timely application of reperfusion, we would suggest, among patients in the first hours from symptom onset, a strategy of early pharmacologic reperfusion and transfer to primary PCI centers, where the decision of performing angiography acutely may be based on the assessment of myocardial reperfusion and risk profile, whereas after the first 3 hours from symptoms onset, primary angioplasty should be considered the preferred strategy if applicable, particularly in regions when streptokinase still represents the only available lytic therapy. However, even though primary angioplasty is able to achieve thrombolysis and TIMI 3 flow in most patients, a still relevant proportion of patients experience poor myocardial reperfusion, with negative impact on acute and long-term survival. The use of platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa complex inhibitors has significantly improved survival, with additional benefits obtained by early administration aiming at early reperfusion, which are to be recommended, particularly among high-risk patients and those presenting within the first hours from symptom onset. The use of adjunctive mechanical devices has reduced the incidence of distal embolization without any apparent benefit in survival. Until the results of larger randomized trials become available, these devices may be considered in patients at high risk for distal embolization, such as those with large thrombotic burden. The use of coronary stenting has significantly reduced restenosis, as compared with balloon angioplasty. Several randomized trials have recently been conducted on drug-eluting stents in ST-segment elevation MI, showing the safety and significant benefits of these devices in terms of restenosis, as compared with bare metal stents (BMSs). However, because of unpredictable compliance to long-term double oral antiplatelet therapy in acute patients, caution should be taken with extensive use of drug-eluting stents in primary angioplasty."

National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines suggest EVTEP should be offered to patients undergoing colorectal cancer surgery. Local EVTEP prescribing and monitoring guidelines in a busy inner city teaching hospital colorectal surgery unit, were devised to ensure NICE guidelines are followed. Adherence to local EVTEP guidelines was recorded through a retrospective audit of patients undergoing elective colorectal cancer surgery during February 2011 (n=19). Prospective re-audit cycles were undertaken during April-May (n=17) and September-December 2012 (n=17). The first audit cycle revealed that overall standards were not being met with just 11% of 'at risk' patients being correctly identified in pre-operative assessment clinic and continued low adherence to guidelines on the ward with only 44% of patients being prescribed EVTEP at discharge. Following each audit cycle, educational interventions were directed towards the multi-disciplinary team involved in the care of patients undergoing colorectal cancer surgery. This involved education of the team members regarding EVTEP, presentation of the audit results with instruction for improvement. Results of the second and third audit cycles showed improvements in guideline adherence with 100% of patients in these cohorts having been prescribed EVTEP at discharge. Marked improvements were also seen in the correct identification of 'at risk' patients, patient education in pre-operative assessment clinic, and warning of potential side-effects. This project has shown a significant global improvement in EVTEP-related patient care and adherence to local guidelines following education of the multi-disciplinary team involved, which consequently reduced the risk of venous thromboembolism within this patient cohort."

Strategies of prevention may consist of platelet aggregation inhibitors and/or cytoreductive agents depending on the underlying disease and the individual risk. Clinical evidence for management of acute venous thromboembolic events in MPN patients is limited. Modality and duration of therapeutic anticoagulation after venous thrombosis has to be evaluated critically with special regard to the increased risk for spontaneous bleeding events associated with the underlying diseases. Both for therapy of the acute event and for secondary prophylaxis, low-molecular-weight heparins should preferentially be used. A prolongation of the therapeutic anticoagulation beyond the usual 3 to 6 months can only be recommended in high-risk settings and after careful evaluation of potential risks and benefits for the individual patient. New direct oral anticoagulants (NOAC) should not preferentially be used due to lack of clinical experience in patients with MPN and potential drug interactions (e.g. with JAK inhibitors). Consequent treatment of the underlying myeloproliferative disease and periodical evaluation of the response to therapy is crucial for optimal secondary prophylaxis of thromboembolic events in those patients."
CD008201,0,23386467,0,Comprehensive update on the prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism in cancer patients.,"Patients with cancer are at increased risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE).

Recent efforts to improve VTE management in cancer patients are directed toward optimizing prevention during high-risk periods. Prophylaxis with anticoagulants during hospitalizations and the immediate postoperative period is well established, and although extended postoperative prophylaxis for up to 4 weeks is safe, questions remain regarding benefit. Thromboprophylaxis for preventing CVC-related thrombosis is no longer recommended. Research is focusing on using validated risk-assessment models to identify high-risk ambulatory patients who might benefit from thromboprophylaxis during chemotherapy.

CD008201,0,26165526,0,Persistent (patent) foramen ovale (PFO): implications for safe diving.,"Diving medicine is a peculiar specialty. There are physicians and scientists from a wide variety of disciplines with an interest in diving and who all practice 'diving medicine': the study of the complex whole-body physiological changes and interactions upon immersion and emersion. To understand these, the science of physics and molecular gas and fluid movements comes into play. The ultimate goal of practicing diving medicine is to preserve the diver's health, both during and after the dive. Good medicine starts with prevention. For most divers, underwater excursions are not a professional necessity but a hobby; avoidance of risk is generally a much better option than risk mitigation or cure. However, prevention of diving illnesses seems to be even more difficult than treating those illnesses. The papers contained in this issue of DHM are a nice mix of various aspects of PFO that divers are interested in, all of them written by specialist doctors who are avid divers themselves. However, diving medicine should also take advantage of research from the ""non-diving"" medicine community, and PFO is a prime example. Cardiology and neurology have studied PFO for as long, or even longer than divers have been the subjects of PFO research, and with much greater numbers and resources. Unexplained stroke has been associated with PFO, as has severe migraine with aura. As the association seems to be strong, investigating the effect of PFO closure was a logical step. Devices have been developed and perfected, allowing now for a relatively low-risk procedure to 'solve the PFO problem'. However, as with many things in science, the results have not been as spectacular as hoped for: patients still get recurrences of stroke, still have migraine attacks. The risk-benefit ratio of PFO closure for these non-diving diseases is still debated. For diving, we now face a similar problem. Let there be no doubt that PFO is a pathway through which venous gas emboli (VGE) can arterialize, given sufficiently favourable circumstances (such as: a large quantity of VGE, size of the PFO, straining or provocation manoeuvres inducing increased right atrial pressure, delayed tissue desaturation so that seeding arterial gas emboli (AGE) grow instead of shrink, and there may be other, as yet unknown factors). There is no doubt that closing a PFO, either surgically or using a catheter-delivered device, can reduce the number of VGE becoming AGE. There is also no doubt that the procedure itself carries some health risks which are, at 1% or higher risk of serious complications, an order of magnitude greater than the risk for decompression illness (DCI) in recreational diving. Scientists seek the 'truth', but the truth about how much of a risk PFO represents for divers is not likely to be discovered nor universally accepted. First of all, the exact prevalence of PFO in divers is not known. As it has been pointed out in the recent literature, a contrast echocardiography (be it transthoracic or transoesophageal) or Doppler examination is only reliable if performed according to a strict protocol, taking into account the very many pitfalls yielding false negative results. The optimal procedure for injection of contrast medium was described several years ago, but has not received enough attention. Indeed, it is our and others' experience that many divers presenting with PFO-related DCI symptoms initially are declared ""PFO-negative"" by eminent, experienced cardiologists! Failing a prospective study, the risks of diving with a right-to left vascular shunt can only be expressed as an 'odds ratio', which is a less accurate measure than is 'relative risk'. The DAN Europe Carotid Doppler Study, started in 2001, is nearing completion and will provide more insight into the actual risks of DCI for recreational divers. The degree of DCI risk reduction from closing a PFO is thus not only dependent on successful closure but also (mostly?) on how the diver manages his/her dive and decompression in order to reduce the incidence of VGE. It has been convincingly shown that conservative dive profiles reduce DCI incidence even in divers with large PFOs, just as PFO closure does not protect completely from DCI if the dive profiles are aggressive. Prospective studies should not only focus on the reduction of DCI incidence after closure, but should take into account the costs and side effects of the procedure, as has been done in the cardiology and neurology studies. Imagine lung transplants becoming a routine operation, costly but with a high success rate; imagine also a longterm smoker suffering from a mild form of obstructive lung disease and exercise-limiting dyspnoea. Which of two options would you recommend: having a lung transplant and continue smoking as before, or quit smoking and observe a progressive improvement of pulmonary and cardiac pathology? As opposed to patients with thrombotic disease and migraine, divers can choose to reduce DCI risk. In fact, all it takes is acceptance that some types of diving carry too high a health risk - whether it is because of a PFO or another 'natural' factor. It would be unethical to promote PFO closure in divers solely on the basis of its efficacy of shunt reduction. Unfortunately, at least one device manufacturer has already done so in the past, citing various publications to specifically target recreational divers. Some technical diving organizations even have recommended preventive PFO closure in order to undertaking high-risk dive training. As scientists, we must not allow ourselves to be drawn into intuitive diver fears and beliefs. Nor should we let ourselves be blinded by the ease and seemingly low risk of the procedure. With proper and objective information provided by their diving medicine specialist, divers could make an informed decision, rather than focus on the simplistic idea that they need 'to get it fixed' in order to continue diving. A significant relationship between PFO and cerebral damage, in the absence of high-risk diving or DCI, has yet to be confirmed. Studying PFO-related DCI provides us with unique opportunities to learn more about the effect of gas bubbles in various tissues, including the central vascular bed and neurological tissue. It may also serve to educate divers that safe diving is something that needs to be learned, not something that can be implanted."
CD008201,0,24996649,0,Continuation of venous thromboembolism prophylaxis after hospital discharge into the outpatient setting: the ACCEPT study.,"Transition from the hospital into the outpatient setting is a critical event for the appropriate provision of VTE prophylaxis. Data for this transition for the situation in Germany is scant. This was a retrospective, observational study in patients receiving in-hospital thromboprophylaxis and discharged with or without a recommendation to continue. Patient with previous thromboembolism were excluded. A total of 3,211 patients were identified by 518 physicians of which 2,853 had all data available for the present analysis; mean patient's age was 57.4 ± 17.5 (SD) years, 48.2% were male and bodyweight was 79.8 ± 16.1 kg. During hospitalization 95.5% of surgical and 84.0% of medical patients received any thromboprophylaxis, the mean hospital duration being 12.7 ± 20.3 days. Surgical patients had high, medium and low risk in 53.8, 37.1 and 9.1%, respectively. Medical patients had high, medium and low risk in 78.8, 19.8 and 1.4%. A hospital recommendation to continue thromboprophylaxis was given to 84.6% (95% CI 83.1-85.9%) of surgical and 64.9% (95% CI 59.1-70.6%) of medical patients and implemented in 96.6 and 94.3%, respectively. On the other hand, in patients without a respective hospital recommendation (15.4% of surgical and 35.1% of medical patients), thromboprophylaxis was continued in 65.3% of surgical and 73.1% of medical patients because of high risk. Our data illustrate acceptable rates of prophylaxis in surgical and medical patients in Germany. As the results show, it is essential that not only hospital physicians are aware of the actual risk at discharge, but office based physicians assess thromboembolic risk."
CD008201,0,16448321,0,Treatment of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia in cardiovascular patients.,"Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is an antibody-mediated syndrome associated with heparin exposure, a falling platelet count and a high risk of thrombosis. Cardiovascular patients are at increased risk of HIT due to wide use of heparin in this population. Should HIT be suspected, heparin must be avoided in most situations, and anticoagulation with an alternative anticoagulant should be instituted. Preferred agents include the direct thrombin inhibitors argatroban and lepirudin, whilst bivalirudin or desirudin (other direct thrombin inhibitors) can be used in some situations. The indirect thrombin inhibitors, danaparoid and fondaparinux, can also be considered at times. These agents and their use in cardiac patients, including patients with acute coronary syndrome, percutaneous coronary interventions, acute ST elevation myocardial infarction or cardiac surgery, will be reviewed."
CD008201,0,15383473,0,The pharmacology and management of the vitamin K antagonists: the Seventh ACCP Conference on Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy.,"This article concerning the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) is part of the Seventh American College of Chest Physicians Conference on Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy: Evidence-Based Guidelines. The article describes the antithrombotic effect of VKAs, the monitoring of anticoagulation intensity, the clinical applications of VKA therapy, and the optimal therapeutic range of VKAs, and provides specific management recommendations. Grade 1 recommendations are strong, and indicate that the benefits do, or do not, outweigh the risks, burdens, and costs. Grade 2 suggests that individual patient's values may lead to different choices (for a full understanding of the grading see Guyatt et al, CHEST 2004; 126:179S-187S). Among the key recommendations in this article are the following: for dosing of VKAs, we suggest the initiation of oral anticoagulation therapy with doses between 5 and 10 mg for the first 1 or 2 days for most individuals, with subsequent dosing based on the international normalized ratio (INR) response (Grade 2B). In the elderly and in other patient subgroups with an elevated bleeding risk, we suggest a starting dose at < or = 5 mg (Grade 2C). We recommend basing subsequent doses after the initial two or three doses on the results of INR monitoring (Grade 1C). The article also includes several specific recommendations for the management of patients with INRs above the therapeutic range and for patients requiring invasive procedures. For example, in patients with mild to moderately elevated INRs without major bleeding, we suggest that when vitamin K is to be given it be administered orally rather than subcutaneously (Grade 1A). For the management of patients with a low risk of thromboembolism, we suggest stopping warfarin therapy approximately 4 days before they undergo surgery (Grade 2C). For patients with a high risk of thromboembolism, we suggest stopping warfarin therapy approximately 4 days before surgery, to allow the INR to return to normal, and beginning therapy with full-dose unfractionated heparin or full-dose low-molecular-weight heparin as the INR falls (Grade 2C). In patients undergoing dental procedures, we suggest the use of tranexamic acid mouthwash (Grade 2B) or epsilon amino caproic acid mouthwash without interrupting anticoagulant therapy (Grade 2B) if there is a concern for local bleeding. For most patients who have a lupus inhibitor, we suggest a therapeutic target INR of 2.5 (range, 2.0 to 3.0) [Grade 2B]. In patients with recurrent thromboembolic events with a therapeutic INR or other additional risk factors, we suggest a target INR of 3.0 (range, 2.5 to 3.5) [Grade 2C]. As models of anticoagulation monitoring and management, we recommend that clinicians incorporate patient education, systematic INR testing, tracking, and follow-up, and good communication with patients concerning results and dosing decisions (Grade 1C+)."
CD008201,0,18571579,0,A 10-year analysis of venous thromboembolism on the surgical service: the effect of practice guidelines for prophylaxis.,There is a national effort to decrease the incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in surgical patients by encouraging compliance with established guidelines for prophylaxis. Reported compliance with these guidelines has been poor. The outcome of noncompliance in terms of morbidity and mortality in surgical patients is unknown. We sought to determine if there has been a decrease in the incidence of symptomatic VTE since implementation of the guidelines and whether there has been compliance with the guidelines in individual patients; we also analyzed the outcome of a cohort with VTE.
CD008201,0,26370208,0,Direct Oral Anticoagulants for the Prevention of Stroke in Patients with Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation: Understanding Differences and Similarities.,"The presence of atrial fibrillation (AF), the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia, significantly increases the risk for stroke. Current guidelines recommend that the vitamin K antagonist warfarin or direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), such as the approved direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran and the approved direct factor Xa inhibitors apixaban, rivaroxaban, and edoxaban, should be used for thromboprophylaxis in patients with nonvalvular AF at risk for stroke or systemic embolic events (SEE). Warfarin, the mainstay of stroke prevention in AF, increases the risk of major bleeding. Furthermore, warfarin therapy comes with several limitations including frequent monitoring and the need for dose adjustments, unpredictable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, and the potential for significant drug-drug and food-drug interactions. The DOACs were developed to overcome these limitations while maintaining or surpassing warfarin's efficacy and safety profiles. All four DOACs have similar or better efficacy and safety compared with warfarin and are therefore valuable alternatives for the prevention of stroke and SEE in patients with nonvalvular AF. Understanding the subtle differences in the DOACs' pharmacology, phase 3 study designs, and trial outcomes will allow for a more tailored approach in selecting the right oral anticoagulant for each patient."

CD008201,0,21722783,0,Treatment strategies for carotid stenosis in patients at increased risk for surgery.,"The purpose of carotid revascularization is stroke prevention. The merits of carotid revascularization as well as the type of revascularization are dependent on the ""natural risk"" and the ""revascularization risk."" In general, the natural risk of stroke in any patient with carotid stenosis (CS) is dependent on the symptomatic status of the patient and CS severity. Contemporary choices for carotid revascularization include carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and carotid artery stenting (CAS). Anatomical (hostile neck situations, severe bilateral CS, CEA restenosis) and clinical (severe cardiopulmonary diseases, prior cranial nerve injury) factors may increase the risk of CEA. Likewise, anatomical (complex aortic arch and brachiocephalic arterial anatomy, presence of thrombus, and heavy calcification) and clinical (need for heart surgery within 30 days) factors may increase the risk of CAS. Other factors such as the presence of symptomatic CS (transient ischemic attack or stroke within 6 months), decreased cerebral reserve, chronic kidney disease, and age older than 75 years may increase the risk of CEA and CAS. In general, symptomatic patients with severe CS exceed revascularization risk. In contrast, asymptomatic patients who are high risk for CEA should be considered for CAS because the natural risk of stroke should undergo careful assessment of baseline cognitive function, aortic arch and carotid artery anatomy, and likelihood of survival for 3 years. Patients who have normal cognitive function, favorable anatomy, and high likelihood of survival more than 3 years should be considered for CAS, whereas patients with multiple unfavorable features may be treated with optimal medical therapy, without revascularization."

CD008201,0,22360832,0,[Management of antiphospholipid syndrome].,"The prevention of thrombosis in the antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) remains controversial. The purpose of this review is to provide updated recommendations. There is evidence that patients at risk of thrombosis are those with ""a pattern of high risk antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL)"" (presence of a lupus anticoagulant [LA], association of several aPL, or persistent aCL at a medium or high level), or those with associated systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The prescription of aspirin in primary prevention is recommended in SLE patients with positive LA or persistent aCL at a significant level. Secondary prevention is based on a very prolonged anticoagulation. An INR around 2.5 seems to be sufficient in patients with venous APS. In case of arterial events, the attitude is debated. We propose to maintain a target INR between 3 and 3.5. The possible occurrence of relapse despite anticoagulation in the therapeutic target may lead to the addition of aspirin. The development of new anti-thrombotic agents might change the management of APS in the coming years."

CD008201,0,8760628,0,[Medical environment of total hip prosthesis].,"Total hip replacement is an extremely frequent operation for the treatment of degenerative joint disease. Indication for surgery must take into account the patient's general status, associated diseases, multiple joint involvement, and the efficacy and tolerance to medical treatments. The decision to operate is taken together by the physician and the patient. The degree of functional impairment and the patient's age are important factors. The patient must be informed that the period of hospitalization will be approximately 15 days and that good results are obtained in approximately 98% of the cases. Preoperative consultation with the anesthesist will focus on associated diseases with special attention to possible infectious foyers. Early post operative care includes a 48 hour antibiotic reginien, thromboprophylaxy with low molecular weight heparin for 3 days followed by anti-vitamin K for 6 weeks, and non-steroid antiinflammatory drugs for 5 days of up to 6 weeks in case of suspected risk of ossification. At mid-term, complications may include hematomas, infection and luxation. The fixation may also fail in certain cases where transtrochanter access was used. Long-term follow-up monitors for possible late onset infection and late luxations which usually result from prosthesis wear and more rarely from muscular causes."

CD008201,0,11383324,0,Antithrombotic drugs for older subjects. Guidelines formulated jointly by the Italian Societies of Haemostasis and Thrombosis (SISET) and of Gerontology and Geriatrics (SIGG).,"Older individuals contribute heavily to the percentage of deaths due to myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke. The incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) is highest in subjects > 65 years. Prospective intervention trials involving groups of clinically comparable subjects > or = 60 allow the following statements to be made with regard to the use of antithrombotic drugs in the elderly. Antiplatelet agents. To prevent recurrence of ischaemic stroke and MI in stable/unstable angina, MI, TIA/stroke or peripheral arterial disease, aspirin is the drug of choice. Clopidogrel is more effective than aspirin in this respect. Heparin. For the treatment of acute deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), intravenous standard heparin or subcutaneous standard heparin are effective (aPTT 1.5-2.0 times baseline values). As the risk of bleeding increases with age, low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWH) are preferable in the elderly. For the prophylaxis of VTE in general surgery in subjects at low-moderate risk, low-dose heparin or low doses of LMWH are effective. In subjects at high risk, adjusted-dose heparin plus physical devices or high-dose LMWH are recommended. The combination of heparin and aspirin is the standard treatment for unstable angina and non-Q wave MI. LMWH are as active as standard heparin in this indication. Vitamin K antagonists. For the chronic treatment of VTE, warfarin is also the treatment of choice (INR 2.0-3.0) in the elderly, though lower doses are needed due to their hypersensitivity to oral anticoagulants. For the prevention of thromboembolic stroke in patients > 75 with atrial fibrillation, warfarin is the drug of choice. Patients aged 65-75 may receive warfarin or aspirin. Thrombolytic agents. Thrombolytic agents are not recommended for treating DVT in the elderly because of their limited risk/benefit ratio and should be confined to massive PE. In the absence of contraindications, thrombolysis for MI may be considered in the elderly."
CD008201,0,23501173,0,Stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation--an Asian stroke perspective.,"Despite relatively lower prevalence of atrial fibrillation (AF) in Asians (~1%) than in Caucasians (~2%), Asia has a much higher overall disease burden because of its proportionally larger aged population. For example, on the basis of reported age-adjusted prevalence rates and projected population figures in China, there will be an estimated 5.2 million men and 3.1 million women with AF older than 60 years by year 2050. Stroke is a disabling complication of AF that is of increasing cause for concern in Asians patients. Implementing consensus expert recommendations for managing stroke risk in patients with AF can considerably reduce stroke rates. However, caution is necessary when aligning management of Asian patients with AF to that of their Caucasian counterparts. Current international guidelines and risk stratification tools for AF management are based on findings in predominantly Caucasian populations and may therefore have limited relevance, in certain respects, to Asian patients. Oral anticoagulants play an important role in preventing AF-related stroke. The vitamin K antagonist warfarin is recommended for reducing the risk of stroke and thromboembolism in high-risk patients with nonvalvular AF; however, warfarin interacts with many drugs and food ingredients, which may pose significant challenges in administration and monitoring among Asian patients. Further research is needed to inform specific guidance on the implications of different stroke and bleeding profiles in Asians vs Caucasians. Moreover, there is scope to improve physician perceptions and patient knowledge, as well as considering alternative new oral anticoagulants, for example, direct thrombin inhibitors or factor Xa inhibitors."
CD008201,0,26347411,0,Neuraxial and peripheral nerve blocks in patients taking anticoagulant or thromboprophylactic drugs: challenges and solutions.,"Incidence of hemorrhagic complications from neuraxial blockade is unknown, but classically cited as 1 in 150,000 epidurals and 1 in 220,000 spinals. However, recent literature and epidemiologic data suggest that for certain patient populations the frequency is higher (1 in 3,000). Due to safety concerns of bleeding risk, guidelines and recommendations have been designed to reduce patient morbidity/mortality during regional anesthesia. Data from evidence-based reviews, clinical series and case reports, collaborative experience of experts, and pharmacology used in developing consensus statements are unable to address all patient comorbidities and are not able to guarantee specific outcomes. No laboratory model identifies patients at risk, and rarity of neuraxial hematoma defies prospective randomized study so ""patient-specific"" factors and ""surgery-related"" issues should be considered to improve patient-oriented outcomes. Details of advanced age, older females, trauma patients, spinal cord and vertebral column abnormalities, organ function compromise, presence of underlying coagulopathy, traumatic or difficult needle placement, as well as indwelling catheter(s) during anticoagulation pose risks for significant bleeding. Therefore, balancing between thromboembolism, bleeding risk, and introduction of more potent antithrombotic medications in combination with regional anesthesia has resulted in a need for more than ""consensus statements"" to safely manage regional interventions during anticoagulant/thromboprophylactic therapy."
CD008201,0,22183223,0,Prevention of venous thromboembolic events after gynecologic surgery.,"Venous thromboembolic events (deep vein thrombosis [DVT] and pulmonary embolism) are serious preventable complications associated with gynecologic surgery. Preoperative risk assessment of the individual patient will provide insight into the level of risk and the potential benefits of prophylaxis. Common risks include a history of venous thromboembolism, age, major surgery, cancer, use of oral contraceptives or hormone therapy, and obesity. Based on the presence of risk factors, the patient should be categorized into one of four risk groups and appropriate thromboprophylaxis prescribed. Randomized clinical trials in gynecologic surgery and general surgery have established the significant value of thromboprophylaxis. For moderate- and high-risk patients undergoing surgery for benign gynecologic conditions, low-dose unfractionated heparin, low molecular weight (LMW) heparins, intermittent pneumatic leg compression, and graded compression stockings all have demonstrated benefit. If using low-dose unfractionated heparin in high-risk patients, the heparin should be administered 5,000 units every 8 hours. Because DVT often begins in the perioperative period, it is important to initiate low-dose unfractionated heparin or administer the first LMW heparin dose either 2 hours preoperatively or 6 hours after the surgical procedure. Low molecular weight heparin has the advantage of being administered once daily but is more expensive than low-dose unfractionated heparin. In addition, LMW heparin has not been shown to be more effective and has similar risk of bleeding complications when compared with low-dose unfractionated heparin. In the very high-risk patient, a combination of two prophylactic methods may be advisable and continuing LMW heparin for 28 days postoperatively appears to be of added benefit."

In 1990 a protocol designed to accommodate either protocol- or physician-determined dosing of warfarin for orthopedic antithrombotic prophylaxis (OAP) was implemented at a community hospital. A ""protocol"" group consisting of patients treated entirely under the protocol-determined dosing option was prospectively identified over a two-year period. A ""physician"" group consisting of patients treated by physicians in the 10 months immediately preceding implementation of the protocol was also identified. The ability of the protocol to achieve laboratory-test and clinical goals was assessed by comparing the two groups. The proportion of patients who received OAP increased from 89% for the physician group to 98% for the protocol group. Mean prothrombin times (PTs) were significantly higher in the protocol group only on postoperative day 2; 66% of all PTs beyond post-operative day 1 in the protocol group were within the targeted range, which reflected an International Normalized Ratio of 1.6-3.2. The frequencies of clinically apparent postoperative thrombotic events and bleeding episodes were low in each group and comparable to literature values. Analysis of protocol-group patients with PTs of > 20 seconds indicated that lower weight, female sex, and blood loss during surgery were associated with an elevated PT. The protocol was revised to provide for a lower initial warfarin dose in elderly women. A pharmacy-managed protocol for dosing warfarin achieved therapeutic goals and promoted nearly universal use of OAP in patients undergoing high-risk orthopedic surgery."

CD008201,0,16840950,0,[Diagnosis and treatment of thromboembolic events in pediatrics].,"Thromboembolic events are an increasingly commonly recognized secondary complications in children treated for serious, life-threatening primary diseases. Nevertheless the incidence of venous thromboembolic disease remains 100 times less frequent in hospitalized children than hospitalized adults, as recent data suggest an incidence of 5,3/10.000 pediatric patients compared to an incidence of 2,5-5/100 in adult patients. Diseases usually associated with thromboembolic events in children are neoplasia, autoimmune or cardiac malformative disease. Contrarily to what is observed in the adult, the majority of deep vein thrombosis events occur at the upper limbs veins, usually at the place where devices for venous access like port-a-cath or central venous lines are inserted. Because of the relatively low incidence of venous thromboembolic events in children, the diagnostic approach used are largely extrapolated from guidelines obtained from adult studies. However, the diagnostic performances of some diagnostic tools like Doppler-Ultrasound are probably diminished in children. Moreover, the concept of developmental hemostasis, which stresses the point that the hemostatic system in children is quite different from the adult one, is widely accepted and clearly suggests that the diagnostic and therapeutic approach in pediatric patients may not be simply extrapolated from data obtained in adult studies. From a more practical point of view, the fact that the hemostatic system in children is a dynamic and evolving system, renders the therapeutic approach quite complex. In particular, doses of anticoagulants vary markedly across the pediatric age. The absence of adapted formulations of commonly used anticoagulants, for example the absence of liquid formulations of anti-vitamin K drugs, further complicates the administration and the correct monitoring of anticoagulation in children, and may diminish observance in adolescent patients. Even though the concept that ""children are not little adults"" is nowadays widely accepted, there is an urgent need for prospective studies to better assess the modalities of diagnosis and treatment of venous thromboembolic disease in this particular population."

CD008201,0,22839302,0,Clinical review: Traumatic brain injury in patients receiving antiplatelet medication.,"As the population ages, emergency physicians are confronted with a growing number of trauma patients receiving antithrombotic and antiplatelet medication prior to injury. In cases of traumatic brain injury, pre-injury treatment with anticoagulants has been associated with an increased risk of posttraumatic intracranial haemorrhage. Since high age itself is a well-recognised risk factor in traumatic brain injury, this population is at special risk for increased morbidity and mortality. The effects of antiplatelet medication on coagulation pathways in posttraumatic intracranial haemorrhage are not well understood, but available data suggest that the use of these agents increases the risk of an unfavourable outcome, especially in cases of severe traumatic brain injury. Standard laboratory investigations are insufficient to evaluate platelet activity, but new assays for monitoring platelet activity have been developed. Commonly used interventions to restore platelet activity include platelet transfusion and application of haemostatic drugs. Nevertheless, controlled clinical trials have not been carried out and, therefore, clinical practice guidelines are not available. In addition to the risks of the acute trauma, patients are at risk for cardiac events such as life-threatening stent thrombosis if antiplatelet therapy is withdrawn. In this review article, we summarize the pathophysiologic mechanisms of the most commonly used antiplatelet agents and analyse results of studies on the effects of this treatment on patients with traumatic brain injury. Additionally, we focus on opportunities to counteract antiplatelet effects in those patients as well as on considerations regarding the withdrawal of antiplatelet therapy. In those chronically ill patients, an interdisciplinary approach involving intensivists, neurosurgeons as well as cardiologists is often mandatory."

She was known to have atrial fibrillation and was initiated on warfarin for stroke prophylaxis 3 days earlier. She was given warfarin therapy without low molecular weight heparin cover as per ""slow-start regimen"" protocol. The warfarin dose was increased after 3 days to achieve rapid anticoagulation, resulting in DVT in the left leg. We propose that the higher unopposed warfarin dose utilized in this case resulted in DVT.

Enoxaparin is a highly effective antithrombotic drug that is well tolerated and without the need for monitoring. Numerous controlled trials in these patient groups have demonstrated enoxaparin to be at least as effective as heparin in reducing the occurrence of deep vein thrombosis while showing a tendency towards lower risk of bleeding complications; therefore, enoxaparin is recommended as thromboprophylaxis in patients undergoing major hip or knee surgery or suffering from multiple trauma."

CD008201,0,12093132,0,The morbidity related to atrial fibrillation at a tertiary centre in one year: 9.0% of all strokes are potentially preventable.,"Atrial fibrillation is a major risk factor for stroke. Anticoagulant therapy reduces this risk but increases the risk of haemorrhage. We aimed to compare the morbidity related to the treatment of atrial fibrillation with warfarin seen in one year at our hospital, with the morbidity in those patients in whom embolism was potentially preventable. There were 111 patients admitted to our hospital in a 12 month period with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) who had stroke, TIA or peripheral embolism. Atrial fibrillation was identified prior to admission in 87 of these 111 (78%) patients with thromboembolism, yet only 14 of these (16%) were receiving warfarin for stroke prophylaxis. Through chart review, a further 56 (64%) patients with embolism could have been receiving anticoagulant therapy if published clinical guidelines(1) were applied. Therefore, 40 episodes of thromboembolism were potentially preventable. Over the same period, there were 18 patients admitted with haemorrhage related to warfarin therapy for stroke prophylaxis in NVAF, including 10 gastrointestinal, five intracerebral, and three peripheral haemorrhages. Most haemorrhages were associated with a high International Normalized Ratio (INR) and the patients were left less disabled than those with embolism. Only one patient with haemorrhage had an absolute contraindication to warfarin therapy (6%). We conclude that the number of preventable strokes far outweighed the morbidity due to warfarin use in the management of NVAF."

Despite no cancer treatment for almost 1.5 years, the primary lesion and the metastatic lymph nodes had decreased significantly in size and the tumor embolus in the portal vein had disappeared completely on the CT scan. He was therefore treated with TS-1 alone (120 mg/day) under a 4-weeks-on and 2-weeks-off regimen.

CD008201,0,22437411,0,The health-related quality of life was not improved by targeting higher hemoglobin in the Normal Hematocrit Trial.,"The Normal Hematocrit Trial (NHT) was the largest trial of epoetin randomizing 1265 hemodialysis patients with cardiac disease to lower (9-11 g/dl) or higher (13-15 g/dl) hemoglobin (Hgb), hypothesizing that higher Hgb would reduce mortality, and improve survival and quality of life. The trial was terminated early, and a 1998 publication reported that targeting higher hematocrit levels led to an insignificant increase in the primary end points (death or myocardial infarct), or risk ratio 1.3, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.9-1.90, but the P-value was not given, and all-cause death risk was not reported. A higher target reportedly did not increase hospitalization rates, but did significantly improve the 'physical function' domain of quality of life. Comparing the 1996 Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-filed clinical trial report to the 1998 publication, however, found several discrepancies. Among these, the 1998 article reported interim trial results with only the adjusted CI but did not state that the unadjusted CIs were 99.912th percentile, and despite being a secondary end point, reported only the association of achieved Hgb with higher quality of life score. Randomization to the higher target had actually increased the risk for the primary end point (risk ratio 1.28, 95% CI=1.06-1.56; P=0.0112; 99.92% CI=0.92-1.78), the risk of death (risk ratio 1.27, 95% CI=1.04-1.54), non-access thrombotic events (P=0.041), and hospitalization rate (P=0.04), while 'physical function' did not improve (P=0.88). Hence, disclosure of these results in the 1998 publication or access to the FDA-filed report on the NHT in the late 1990s would likely have led to earlier concerns about epoetin safety and greater doubts about its benefits."

CD008201,0,16523816,0,Prevention and management of venous thromboembolism in people with cancer: a review of the evidence.,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) constitutes an important health problem in developed countries. Owing to their underlying malignancies, people with cancer are at particularly high risk of VTE. The level of this risk is influenced by several factors, including type of cancer and the presence or absence of metastases. However, different types of oncology treatment can also further increase the thrombotic risk. Consequently, primary and secondary thromboprophylaxis in people with cancer should be considered as part of any integrated oncology treatment. Moreover, recent exciting studies have suggested that low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) may also influence overall survival in people with cancer. Clearly, these findings raise the likelihood that the use of LMWH in oncology practice may increase significantly in the near future. However, it is important to appreciate that the use of thromboprophylaxis in people with cancer is complicated by a number of specific problems. In this overview, we have systematically addressed the difficult clinical issues that are involved in the selection of appropriate primary and secondary thromboprophylaxis for people with cancer."

CD008201,0,18312754,0,Functional effects of high clopidogrel maintenance dosing in patients with inadequate platelet inhibition on standard dose treatment.,"Updated guidelines on percutaneous coronary intervention recommend increasing the dose of clopidogrel to 150 mg in high-risk patients if <50% platelet inhibition is demonstrated. However, to date, the functional impact of this recommendation has been poorly explored. The aim of this study was to assess the functional implications associated with the use of clopidogrel 150 mg/day in patients with inadequate platelet inhibition while receiving standard 75 mg/day maintenance treatment. Patients with diabetes mellitus have a higher prevalence of inadequate clopidogrel-induced antiplatelet effects and stent thrombosis compared with those without diabetes and were selected for this analysis. Platelet inhibition was assessed using the VerifyNow P2Y12 assay in patients with type 2 diabetes receiving dual-antiplatelet therapy. Patients (n = 17) with <50% platelet inhibition were treated with clopidogrel 150 mg/day for 1 month. Adenosine diphosphate-induced aggregation and the P2Y12 reactivity ratio were also assessed. Platelet function profiles were compared with that of a control group (n = 17) with >or=50% inhibition. Platelet inhibition increased from 27.1 +/- 12% to 40.6 +/- 18% in patients treated with clopidogrel 150 mg/day (p = 0.009; primary end point). All other functional measures also showed enhanced clopidogrel-induced antiplatelet effects. The degree of platelet inhibition achieved after treatment with clopidogrel 150 mg/day varied broadly, and only 35% of patients yielded a degree of platelet inhibition >or=50%. Increasing the dose in patients with inadequate response to clopidogrel did not reach the same degree of antiplatelet effects as those achieved in patients with adequate response while receiving 75 mg/day. In conclusion, the use of a 150 mg maintenance dose of clopidogrel in patients with type 2 diabetes with <50% platelet inhibition is associated with enhanced antiplatelet effects. However, the antiplatelet effects achieved are nonuniform, and a considerable number of patients persist with inadequate platelet inhibition."
CD008201,0,16494639,0,Patterns of use of antithrombotic therapy and quality of anticoagulation among patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation in clinical practice.,"We conducted a retrospective cohort study of thromboprophylaxis rates and the quality of anticoagulation control among patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) using a large, geographically diverse database of electronic medical records. The study population consisted of 13,709 AF patients treated in US outpatient physician practices. Approximately two-thirds were prescribed warfarin alone or in combination with another drug. Older patients, males, and those with congestive heart failure (CHF) or prior stroke were more likely to receive antithrombotic therapy. Among 6454 patients treated with warfarin who had at least two valid prothrombin time/international normalised ratio test results, approximately half of study days were spent in target range. Female sex, CHF and residence in the Northeast were associated with more time out of range. Our study confirms that, in routine medical practice, warfarin is not prescribed for substantial numbers of eligible patients, and anticoagulation control with warfarin is suboptimal for many of those at risk for thromboembolism."

CD008201,0,19807334,0,Economic assessments of low molecular weight heparin in venous thromboembolism.,"Heparin is the treatment of choice for managing patients in the acute phase of venous thromboembolism. While the drug cost of low molecular weight heparins may be greater than unfractionated heparin, its use makes outpatient treatment possible for most patients and allows an earlier discharge from hospital for those requiring inpatient care. Pharmacoeconomic studies and meta-analyses have compared disease management with unfractionated heparin versus the low molecular weight heparins. The results indicate that low molecular weight heparins are the dominant choice. Health outcomes are improved while the overall cost of managing venous thromboembolism is reduced. Additional research is required to examine the relative efficacy and safety of each of the low molecular weight heparin presentations, adherence in the outpatient setting and the impact of acute treatment choices on long-term outcomes such as recurrence, post-thrombotic syndrome and quality of life."
CD008201,0,20434000,0,VTE prophylaxis for the medical patient: where do we stand? - a focus on cancer patients.,"Acutely ill medical patients are at moderate to high risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE): approximately 10-30% of general medical patients may develop deep-vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, and the latter is a leading contributor to deaths in hospital. Medical conditions associated with a high risk of VTE include cardiac disease, cancer, respiratory disease, inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatological and infectious diseases. Pre-disposing risk factors in medical patients include a history of VTE, history of malignancy, complicating infections, increasing age, thrombophilia, prolonged immobility and obesity. Hence active cancer and a history of cancer are both strongly related to VTE in medical (non-surgical) patients. Heparins, both unfractionated (UFH) and low molecular weight (LMWH) and fondaparinux have been shown to be effective agents in prevention of VTE in this setting. However, it has not yet been possible to demonstrate a significant effect on mortality rates in this population. In medical patients, unfractionated heparin has a higher rate of bleeding complications than low molecular weight heparin. Thromboprophylaxis has been shown to be effective in medical patients with cancer and may have an effect on cancer outcomes. Thromboprophylaxis in patients receiving chemotherapy remains controversial and requires further investigation. There is no evidence for the use of aspirin, warfarin or mechanical methods. We recommend either low molecular weight heparin or fondaparinux as safe and effective agents in the thromboprophylaxis of medical patients."
CD008201,0,23812352,0,Venous thromboembolism in pediatric nephrotic syndrome.,"Childhood nephrotic syndrome (NS) is one of the most common pediatric kidney diseases, with an incidence of 2-7 per 100,000. Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, and occurs in ∼3 % of children with NS, though incidence approaches 25 % in high-risk groups. VTE etiology is multifactorial, with disease-associated coagulopathy thought to be a significant contributor. Other risks include age, disease severity, and treatment-related hazards, such as the presence of central venous catheters. Non-pharmacologic preventive measures such as ambulation and compression stockings are recommended for patients with identified VTE risks. Central venous catheters should be avoided whenever possible. Symptoms of VTE include venous catheter dysfunction, unilateral extremity symptoms, respiratory compromise, flank pain, and gross hematuria. When VTE is suspected, confirmatory imaging studies should be obtained, followed by appropriate laboratory evaluation and treatment. Therapeutic goals include limiting thrombus growth, extension, and embolization by early institution of anticoagulant therapy. Anticoagulation is recommended for a minimum of 3 months, but should be continued until NS remission is achieved. Further studies are necessary to identify VTE-risk biomarkers and optimal therapeutic regimens. Observational cohort studies are needed to identify VTE-risk groups who may benefit from thromboprophylaxis and to define disease-specific treatment algorithms."

CD008201,0,15605703,0,Preparing for the post-warfarin generation of antithrombotics.,"Several antithrombotic agents in development have the potential to greatly simplify the management of patients with AF or at risk for DVT/PE. Ximelagatran has already completed several phase 3 clinical studies in both of these high-risk, high-cost clinical settings and is poised to become the first practical alternative to warfarin. Although the exact therapeutic roles of ximelagatran and other novel antithrombotics further back in the pipeline remain to be determined, the impact of these nonwarfarin alternatives on the current labor-intensive system of anticoagulation clinics seems certain. Most important, the introduction of safer and equally effective oral anticoagulants that do not require monitoring may increase the percentage of high-risk patients who actually receive preventive therapy. If the institutional energy and resources previously spent on anticoagulation clinics, thrombotic disease management, and quality benchmarking can now be redirected to the delivery of the new generation of easier-to-administer and safer antithrombotic agents, the potential to increase rates of preventive therapy initiation and adherence in managed care populations may be within reach. Given the proven clinical value of anticoagulation, this potential increase in the rate of prophylaxis suggests the possibility that, even in the face of a rapidly aging US population, we are nonetheless entering into a period of reduced morbidity, mortality, and costs from stroke and DVT/PE."

Based on this principle a 27-year old woman, classified as being in the high-risk group (Goldstein and Berkowitz score: 11), was treated with multiple cytotoxic drugs. The multiple drug schema consisted of: Etoposide 16.213, Methotrexate, Cyclophosphamide, Actomycin-D, and Cisplatin. On the first day of the schedule, moderate high doses of Methotrexate, Etoposide and Cyclophosphamide were administered. Within 8 hours after initiation of therapy the patient died with a clinical picture resembling massive pulmonary obstruction due to choriocarcinomic tissue plugs, probably originating from the uterus. Formation of these plugs was probably due to extensive tumor necrosis at the level of the walls of the major uterine veins, which resulted in an open exchange of tumor plugs to the vascular spaces; decrease in tumor tissue coherence secondary to chemotherapy may have further contributed to the formation of tumor emboli. In view of the close time association between the start of chemotherapy and the acute onset of massive embolism other explanations, such as spontaneous necrosis, must be considered less likely. Patients with large pelvic tumor loads are, according to existing classifications, at high risk to die and to develop drug resistance. Notwithstanding these facts our findings suggest that these patients might benefit from relatively mild initial treatment, especially true for patients not previously exposed to this drug. Close observation of the response status both clinically and with beta-hCG values may indicate whether and when more agressive combination chemotherapy should be started.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Patients undergoing total knee replacement (TKR) and total hip replacement (THR) are at high risk for developing VTE (40%-60% risk without prophylaxis). The economic burden of post-TKR/THR VTE is very large, with the average length of stay more than double that of patients without VTE, and risk-adjusted overall costs 4 and 5 times greater among the TKR and THR populations, respectively, compared with non-VTE patients. Efforts are underway, however, in the public and private sectors to increase the rates of appropriate VTE thromboprophylaxis. Payers are experimenting with quality measurement and improvement programs to incentivize clinical behavior toward optimizing outcomes; the role of patient education in VTE prophylaxis is also evolving. There is an excellent opportunity to reshape the current patient education approach and develop appropriate, accessible materials, but, ultimately, a multipronged effort that targets as many variables related to VTE risk as possible is necessary in order to achieve success in lowering the burden of post-TKR/THR VTE."

As thrombogenesis is thought to begin perioperatively, ""just-in-time"" thromboprophylaxis has been proposed-antithrombotic therapy with low-molecular-weight heparins initiated soon before or soon after surgery. Results from our large clinical trial show the efficacy and safety of a modified dalteparin regimen administered close to the time of total hip arthroplasty."

Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) commonly occurs in the lower extremities but can occur in other sites including the head and neck, trunk, and upper extremities.

CD008201,0,21107514,0,[Evidence-based management of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Latest guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) 2010].,"Acute myocardial infarction and its consequences (death, chronic ischemic coronary artery disease, heart failure) are still the number 1 causes of death and of cardiovascular diseases in Germany. In this context, patients with STEMI are at the highest risk. The first-line management of STEMI patients often determines if the outcome is life or death. This overview presents the current optimal evidence-based management of STEMI patients as a practice-oriented extract according to the latest ESC guidelines, fully published some weeks ago (http://www.escardio.org).All efforts must be made to keep the respective time intervals between the onset of symptoms and the beginning of reperfusion therapy as short as possible, i.e. best within a dedicated STEMI network. Two of the time intervals are particularly essential: the time delay between the onset of symptoms and the first medical contact (FMC) and the time delay between FMC and the beginning of reperfusion. The time delay between the onset of symptoms and FMC depends on the patient as well as on the organization of the emergency medical service (EMS). Unfortunately, too many patients/bystanders still hesitate to immediately call the EMS. More intense measures must therefore be taken to educate the public. The optimal FMC by medical doctors or paramedics reacts quickly and ideally arrives with ECG equipment for immediate diagnosis of STEMI (persistent ST-segment elevation or presumably new left bundle branch block) before hospital admission. Unfortunately in many cases, the FMC is the emergency room of a hospital. Further decisions can be made without laboratory findings. In Germany, the average time delay between onset of symptoms and FMC is 100 min and therefore longer than in some other European countries.The next critical time interval is that between FMC and the beginning of reperfusion: this interval depends solely on the EMS organization and the distance to the next catheter laboratory with 24 h PCI (percutaneous coronary intervention) availability. The key question for further decisions is whether a primary PCI can be performed within 120 min after FMC. If so, the primary PCI should definitively be preferred. In patients <75 years presenting with a large anterior infarction within 2 h after onset of symptoms, this time interval should not exceed 90 min. For primary PCI an often used measure of quality is the ""door-to-balloon"" time, which should of course be as short as possible. Therefore, patients with STEMI should be admitted directly to the catheterization laboratory bypassing the emergency room or intensive care unit. In Germany, the average time interval between FMC and start of primary PCI is approximately 120 min just at the upper limit of the guideline recommendations. Some other European countries report a significantly shorter corresponding time delay.If primary PCI is not possible within 120 min (or 90 min) after FMC, thrombolysis must be initiated within 30 min after FMC, either in the EMS ambulance or in a nearby non-PCI hospital. A thrombolytic therapy, however, even if ""successful"", is not the final therapy: within 24 h (but not before 3 h) cardiac catheterization has to be performed with PCI, if applicable. Analyzing the overall revascularization rates in Germany, 81% receive primary PCI, 7% thrombolysis and 12% no reperfusion therapy. Regarding any reperfusion in STEMI, Germany holds the third place after the Czech Republic and Belgium.Patients presenting at 12-24 h after onset of symptoms or later may possibly benefit from a PCI, even if already asymptomatic, if signs of ischemia/viability in the infarct artery-related area are demonstrable. If this cannot be shown, PCI in these patients is not indicated.The first-line medication aims at dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) and anticoagulation. For DAPT, the combination of ASA with a thienopyridine is mandatory. If primary PCI is feasible, DAPT with prasugrel (loading dose of 60 mg, independent of age and weight) is preferred due to its faster onset of action and superior effectiveness over clopidogrel (loading dose of 600 mg). In patients with STEMI, prasugrel when compared to clopidogrel significantly reduced nonfatal myocardial infarction after 15 months from 9.0% to 6.8% and stent thrombosis significantly from 2.8% to 1.6% (ARC definite/probable). If, however, there are contraindications against prasugrel (s/p stroke or TIA) or if thrombolysis had to be performed, clopidogrel is the choice for DAPT.The i.v. administration of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors (GPI) has been limited to only those patients with a high intracoronary thrombus burden. The upstream application of GPI is not recommended. Recommendations for the mechanical treatment of thrombus burden include manual thrombus aspiration (which was upgraded) and a mesh-based protection stent device (MGuard™). For anticoagulation, unfractionated heparin (UFH) is recommended as always but bivalirudin is an upcoming alternative, either in the catheterization laboratory on top after an EMS-delivered UFH bolus or as a possible first-line monotherapy. Bivalirudin may be preferred in STEMI patients with a high risk of bleeding. To prevent possible thrombotic events after PCI, bivalirudin should be continued for several hours after primary PCI.Regardless of whether PCI or thrombolysis was the first-line therapy and regardless of whether a stent (BMS or DES) was implanted, DAPT should be continued for 12 months with prasugrel 10 mg/day (or 5 mg/day, if ≥75 years old and/or <60 kg body weight) or clopidogrel (75 mg/day). There is no evidence that higher maintenance doses of clopidogrel may circumvent possible clopidogrel resistance. The usefulness of so far non-standardized in-vitro platelet aggregation measurements or the practice-oriented interpretation of genetic tests for CYP2C19 polymorphism is unknown. With the 12 months DAPT the patient is treated not the stent."
CD008201,0,20664897,0,Incidence and predictors of venous thromboembolism in post-acute care patients. A prospective cohort study.,"Few studies have addressed the topic of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients hospitalised in rehabilitation facilities. This patient population is rapidly growing, and data aimed to better define VTE risk in this setting are needed. Primary aim of this prospective observational study was to evaluate the frequency of symptomatic, objectively confirmed VTE in a cohort of unselected consecutive patients admitted to rehabilitation facilities, after medical diseases or surgery. Further objectives were to assess overall mortality, to identify risk factors for VTE and mortality, and to assess the attitude of physicians towards thromboprophylaxis. A total of 3,039 patients were included in the study, and the median duration of hospitalisation was 26 days. Seventy-two patients (2.4%) had symptomatic VTE. The median time to VTE from admission to the long-term care unit was 13 days. According to multivariable analysis, previous VTE (hazard ratio 5.67, 95% confidence interval 3.30-9.77) and cancer (hazard ratio 2.26, 95% confidence interval 1.36-3.75) were significantly associated to the occurrence of VTE. Overall in-hospital mortality was 15.1%. Age over 75 years, male gender, disability, cancer, and the absence of thromboprophylaxis were significantly associated to an increased risk of death (multivariable analysis). In-hospital antithrombotic prophylaxis was administered to 75.1% of patients, and low-molecular-weight heparin was the most widely used agent. According to our study, patients admitted to rehabilitation facilities remain at substantially increased risk for VTE. Because this applies to the majority of these patients, there is a great need for clinical trials assessing optimal prophylactic strategies."

CD008201,0,26116685,0,Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants and atrial fibrillation guidelines in practice: barriers to and strategies for optimal implementation.,"Stroke is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an independent risk factor for stroke, increasing the risk five-fold. Strokes in patients with AF are more likely than other embolic strokes to be fatal or cause severe disability and are associated with higher healthcare costs, but they are also preventable. Current guidelines recommend that all patients with AF who are at risk of stroke should receive anticoagulation. However, despite this guidance, registry data indicate that anticoagulation is still widely underused. With a focus on the 2012 update of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines for the management of AF, the Action for Stroke Prevention alliance writing group have identified key reasons for the suboptimal implementation of the guidelines at a global, regional, and local level, with an emphasis on access restrictions to guideline-recommended therapies. Following identification of these barriers, the group has developed an expert consensus on strategies to augment the implementation of current guidelines, including practical, educational, and access-related measures. The potential impact of healthcare quality measures for stroke prevention on guideline implementation is also explored. By providing practical guidance on how to improve implementation of the ESC guidelines, or region-specific modifications of these guidelines, the aim is to reduce the potentially devastating impact that stroke can have on patients, their families and their carers."

CD008201,0,22964767,0,Clinical significance of the mixing test in laboratory diagnoses of lupus anticoagulant: the fate of the mixing test in integrated lupus anticoagulant test systems.,"The mixing test is used to determine the presence of inhibitors in laboratory diagnoses of lupus anticoagulant. Updated international guidelines state that an integrated lupus anticoagulant test system does not require the mixing test; an appraisal of the mixing tests in integrated lupus anticoagulant test systems is, therefore, required. We investigated the clinical relevance of mixing tests by using the best cutoff value of the mixing test through thrombotic risk analysis. A retrospective analysis was performed on 525 specimens with positive screening tests by using two integrated lupus anticoagulant tests: diluted Russell's Viper venom (dRVVT) and silica clotting time. The diagnostic performance of two interpretation formulas (percentage correction, Rosner index) was assessed, and the thrombotic risk of a subgroup based on the mixing results was investigated. Finally, the thrombotic risk of lupus anticoagulant positivity based on the integrated lupus anticoagulant test system procedures was assessed for the appraisal of mixing test exclusion in integrated lupus anticoagulant test systems. The best cutoff values of mixing test interpretation methods based on dRVVT were as follows: 60.1% for percentage correction and 15.7 for Rosner index. There was no substantial difference in the thrombotic risk between percentage correction and the Rosner index. The mixing-positive group showed a higher lupus anticoagulant titer and higher thrombotic risk than the mixing-negative group. However, even the mixing-negative group carried a significant risk of thrombosis. Finally, lupus anticoagulant positivity determined by the updated two-step procedure (screening and confirmation tests) showed higher thrombotic risk than that determined by the traditional three-step procedure (screening, mixing, and confirmation tests). Although a positive mixing result can predict a high risk of thrombosis, negative mixing results are also associated with a substantial thrombotic risk. The updated two-step procedure without the mixing test is relevant for lupus anticoagulant detection in the context of thrombotic risk estimation."

CD008201,0,25023348,0,Therapy for cancer-related thromboembolism.,"Cancer is an independent and major risk factor for venous thromboembolism (VTE), defined by symptomatic or asymptomatic DVT, including catheter-related thrombosis (CRT), and/or pulmonary embolism (PE). Over the past 20 years, VTE has become the second cause of death in cancer patients, where it accounts for increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. Incidental VTE is increasingly diagnosed on systematic computed tomography in cancer patients, raising new questions in daily oncology practice. Risk factors for VTE in cancer include patient-, cancer-, and treatment-related parameters, which vary for a single patient throughout the course of cancer disease and necessitate repeated individual risk assessments. The use of biomarkers and risk assessment models allow identification of cancer patients at high risk for VTE. Anticoagulant therapy for the prophylaxis and the treatment of established VTE is efficient and relatively safe when contraindications are respected, but the variety of risk factors and the number of comorbidities remain major challenges for adequate VTE treatment in cancer patients. Several national guidelines for primary prevention and treatment of VTE in cancer patients were issued in the past 10 years. To homogeneize existing Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs), an international consensus working group released specific guidelines for the treatment and prophylaxis of VTE in cancer patients in 2013, so as to make each CPG easier to use at the national level. In cancer patients treated for VTE, the use of low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs) is preferred over other anticoagulants in most cases, and LMWHs were shown to be superior to vitamin K antagonists (VKAs). For the prophylaxis of VTE, LMWHs have been validated in surgical patients. For medical cancer patients, ongoing or recent clinical trials will inform our practice. However, several questions remain unanswered due to the number of comorbities in a single patient and expert opinion regarding special situations is required. Better adherence worldwide to CPGs necessitates adequate educational and active implementation strategies, which could substantially decrease the burden of VTE and increase survival in cancer patients."

The use of warfarin sodium has been considered a mainstay therapy for the prevention of thromboembolic complications secondary to AF. Despite its efficacy among oral antithrombotic agents for the prevention of thromboembolic complications secondary to AF, only about 67% of candidates for warfarin receive appropriate antithrombotic therapy. Dosed twice daily, dabigatran offers recipients the ability to forego regular international normalized ratio coagulation monitoring as well as eliminating dietary restrictions (i.e., vitamin K) associated with warfarin therapy. In a 2011 guideline update, dabigatran has been recognized by the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association as a useful alternative to warfarin in patients with AF who are at risk for thromboembolic complications and who are without severe renal or hepatic impairment. The Randomized Evaluation of Long-Term Anticoagulation Therapy (RE-LY) study is the only direct, prospective, comparative clinical trial of dabigatran versus warfarin to date that enrolled subjects for the purpose of examining the ability of dabigatran to prevent stroke and thromboembolic complications associated with nonvalvular AF.

After initial resuscitation, carefully performed endoscopy provides an accurate diagnosis of the source of the UGI hemorrhage and can reliably identify those high-risk subgroups that may benefit most from endoscopic hemostasis. Large-channel therapeutic endoscopes are recommended. Endoscopists should be very experienced in management of patients with UGI hemorrhage, including the use of various hemostatic devices. For patients with major stigmata of ulcer hemorrhage--active arterial bleeding, nonbleeding visible vessel, and adherent clot--combination therapy with epinephrine injection and either thermal coaptive coagulation (with multipolar or heater probe) or endoclips is recommended. High-dose intravenous proton-pump inhibitors are recommended as concomitant therapy with endoscopic hemostasis of major stigmata. Patients with minor stigmata or clean-based ulcers will not benefit from endoscopic therapy and should be triaged to less intensive care and be considered for early discharge.

Elective total hip replacement (THR) or total knee replacement (TKR), hip fracture surgery or trauma patients are at high risk. Isolated lower extremity injury with fracture is at moderate risk whereas this risk is low without fracture as well as with knee arthroscopy. In THR and TKR, low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), fondaparinux or melagatran-ximelagatran are strongly recommended. The routine use of other anticoagulants, in particular vitamin K antagonist are not recommended. In patients at high risk of venous thromboembolism as for example trauma patients, optimal use of intermittent pneumatic compression is an alternative option in case of contra-indication to anticoagulant prophylaxis. Graduated compression stockings enhance the efficacy of pharmacological methods. In schedule surgery, initiation of prophylaxis with LMWH may be started postoperatively. To reduce the haemorrhagic risk of anticoagulants, timing of first postoperative dose is essential and is proper to each drug. Duration of prophylaxis depends on the surgical and the individual patients' risk. Extended prophylaxis in THR for up to 42 days with LMWH and up to 35 days with fondaparinux in hip fracture surgery is recommended. However extended prophylaxis after 14 days in TKR has not demonstrated a higher efficacy and should only be considered for patients with additional risk factors. In patients with isolated lower extremity injury or undergoing knee arthroscopy, LMWH should not be routinely used according to a low or a moderate risk and/or the duration of prophylaxis required. But LMWH has to be considered for patients with additional risk factors. Prophylaxis in other orthopedic procedures has not been assessed and will be extrapolated from the above recommendations."

We believe that a brief course of inpatient enoxaparin and outpatient aspirin is a safe and effective form of thromboprophylaxis."

CD008201,0,22844656,0,Semuloparin for the prevention of venous thromboembolic events in cancer patients.,"Cancer-associated venous thromboembolism increases the morbidity and mortality in patients with cancer, being the second leading cause of death among these patients. As such, it has important clinical and economical consequences and current guidelines recommend thromboprophylaxis for cancer patients who are admitted to the hospital for medical illness or for major cancer surgery but not for routine use in ambulatory patients receiving chemotherapy. Semuloparin (AVE-5026) is a hemisynthetic, ultra-low-molecular-weight heparin, with high anti-factor Xa and residual antithrombin activities that was submitted for approval to the European Medicines Agency and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in September 2011 for the prevention of venous thromboembolism in cancer patients. In a multicenter trial (SAVE-ONCO), once-daily, subcutaneous semuloparin at 20 mg administered to 1,608 patients receiving chemotherapy for locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors significantly prevented venous thromboembolism without increasing major bleeding, suggesting that semuloparin thrombo-prophylaxis can be beneficial in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy."

Despite published guidelines for the prevention of VTE among hospitalized patients, underutilization of prophylaxis continues to be a problem in the United States, Canada, and worldwide. Although much of the emphasis placed on prevention has focused on improving in-hospital prophylaxis, nearly 75% of patients develop VTE in the outpatient setting. Of these patients, a substantial proportion had undergone surgery or hospitalization in the three months preceding the diagnosis of VTE. While extended out-of-hospital prophylaxis has been validated in the orthopedic and surgical oncology literature, data regarding the prevention of VTE in other hospitalized patient populations after discharge have been limited. In this review article, we discuss decision support strategies for improving VTE prevention during hospitalization and at the time of discharge."

CD008201,0,14656016,0,"DACH-LIGA homocystein (german, austrian and swiss homocysteine society): consensus paper on the rational clinical use of homocysteine, folic acid and B-vitamins in cardiovascular and thrombotic diseases: guidelines and recommendations.","About half of all deaths are due to cardiovascular disease and its complications. The economic burden on society and the healthcare system from cardiovascular disability, complications, and treatments is huge and getting larger in the rapidly aging populations of developed countries. As conventional risk factors fail to account for part of the cases, homocysteine, a ""new"" risk factor, is being viewed with mounting interest. Homocysteine is a sulfur-containing intermediate product in the normal metabolism of methionine, an essential amino acid. Folic acid, vitamin B12, and vitamin B6 deficiencies and reduced enzyme activities inhibit the breakdown of homocysteine, thus increasing the intracellular homocysteine concentration. Numerous retrospective and prospective studies have consistently found an independent relationship between mild hyperhomocysteinemia and cardiovascular disease or all-cause mortality. Starting at a plasma homocysteine concentration of approximately 10 micromol/l, the risk increase follows a linear dose-response relationship with no specific threshold level. Hyperhomocysteinemia as an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease is thought to be responsible for about 10% of total risk. Elevated plasma homocysteine levels (>12 micromol/l; moderate hyperhomocysteinemia) are considered cytotoxic and are found in 5 to 10% of the general population and in up to 40% of patients with vascular disease. Additional risk factors (smoking, arterial hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia) may additively or, by interacting with homocysteine, synergistically (and hence over-proportionally) increase overall risk. Hyperhomocysteinemia is associated with alterations in vascular morphology, loss of endothelial anti-thrombotic function, and induction of a procoagulant environment. Most known forms of damage or injury are due to homocysteine-mediated oxidative stress. Especially when acting as direct or indirect antagonists of cofactors and enzyme activities, numerous agents, drugs, diseases, and lifestyle factors have an impact on homocysteine metabolism. Folic acid deficiency is considered the most common cause of hyperhomocysteinemia. An adequate intake of at least 400 microg of folate per day is difficult to maintain even with a balanced diet, and high-risk groups often find it impossible to meet these folate requirements. Based on the available evidence, there is an increasing call for the diagnosis and treatment of elevated homocysteine levels in high-risk individuals in general and patients with manifest vascular disease in particular. Subjects of both populations should first have a baseline homocysteine assay. Except where manifestations are already present, intervention, if any, should be guided by the severity of hyperhomocysteinemia. Consistent with other working parties and consensus groups, we recommend a target plasma homocysteine level of <10 micromol/l. Based on various calculation models, reduction of elevated plasma homocysteine concentrations may theoretically prevent up to 25% of cardiovascular events. Supplementation is inexpensive, potentially effective, and devoid of adverse effects and, therefore, has an exceptionally favorable benefit/risk ratio. The results of ongoing randomized controlled intervention trials must be available before screening for, and treatment of, hyperhomocysteinemia can be recommended for the apparently healthy general population."

CD008201,0,23314387,0,Comparison of three risk assessment methods for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis.,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a major problem for hospitalized patients. Nevertheless, adherence to VTE prophylaxis guidelines is suboptimal, partly because of physicians' neglect due to excessive workload. Simplified risk assessment methods (RAMs) facilitate timely risk stratification and thromboprophylaxis. However, the accuracy of such RAMs has not been extensively studied. Using the prospectively collected data from hospitalized patients of Masih-Daneshvari Hospital, we tested the accuracy of the Goldhaber RAM and the Harinath and St. John RAM for VTE prophylaxis, compared with the eighth edition of the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) recommendations. We evaluated 1091 patients. With reference to the ACCP recommendations, both RAMs had high specificities for detection of patients at risk of VTE (97.33 and 99.11%, respectively); however, we found significant interdepartment differences. The Goldhaber RAM had superior accuracy in medical oncology patients (P = 0.03), whereas the Harinath and St. John method was superior among surgical patients (P < 0.001). Overall accuracies of Goldhaber RAM for appropriate VTE risk assessment and for proper detection of at-risk patients were close to 60%. Corresponding figures were close to 70% for the Harinath and St. John method. Simplified VTE prophylaxis RAMs are valuable, especially for transmitting electronic alerts and for timely risk assessment and thromboprophylaxis. Both of the studied RAMs had high specificities and positive-predictive values, minimizing the risk of overprophylaxis. Improving the sensitivity of such RAMs can help for timely risk assessment for a greater array of real-world patients."
CD008201,0,9708617,0,Reduction in arteriovenous graft impairment: results of a vascular access surveillance protocol.,"Impairment of hemodialysis (HD) vascular access, remains a frustrating problem for both the patient who possesses an arteriovenous graft (AVG) and the nephrologist who cares for the patient. We instituted a vascular access surveillance protocol intended to detect and correct evolving stenosis in patients with AVGs. The principal screen was the observation of dynamic venous pressure (VP) at a blood flow rate of 200 mL/min during the first 5 minutes of each HD session. If VP at a blood flow rate of 200 mL/min was 140 mm Hg or greater in three of six consecutive readings, recirculation greater than 15% on two observations, graft-arm swelling observed, or prolonged bleeding postdialysis observed, then the patient was referred for angiography and then angioplasty or surgery if a vascular stenosis of greater than 50% was documented. Sixty-four patients with a synthetic AVG comprised the study group. Seventy-two episodes of AVG impairment (56 with stenosis > or = 50% on angiography, 16 with thrombosis) occurred in these patients during the study period. In 63 of 72 impairment episodes, the preceding vascular access screening test was positive. The calculated sensitivity and specificity of the vascular access protocol was 88% and 81%, respectively. Calculation of the sensitivity and specificity for the VP alone was 81% and 85%, respectively. Comparison of the study group with a similar historical control group (55 patients) showed a significantly lower thrombosis rate (P = 0.03; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.025 to 0.375) in the study group (0.29 thrombotic episodes/graft-year at risk) versus the historical control group (0.49 thrombotic episodes/graft-year at risk). In summary, a vascular access surveillance protocol is a useful tool to predict patients at risk for AVG venous stenosis and/or thrombosis. A dynamic VP of 140 mm Hg or greater appears to be the optimal threshold pressure. A decrease in synthetic AVG thrombosis rate resulted from the use of this surveillance protocol."

CD008201,0,25755579,0,Portal vein thrombosis in cirrhosis.,"Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is being increasingly recognized in patients with advanced cirrhosis and in those undergoing liver transplantation. Reduced flow in the portal vein is probably responsible for clotting in the spleno-porto-mesenteric venous system. There is also increasing evidence that hypercoagulability occurs in advanced liver disease and contributes to the risk of PVT. Ultrasound based studies have reported a prevalence of PVT in 10-25% of cirrhotic patients without hepatocellular carcinoma. Partial thrombosis of the portal vein is more common and may not have pathophysiological consequences. However, there is high risk of progression of partial PVT to complete PVT that may cause exacerbation of portal hypertension and progression of liver insufficiency. It is thus, essential to accurately diagnose and stage PVT in patients waiting for transplantation and consider anticoagulation therapy. Therapy with low molecular weight heparin and vitamin K antagonists has been shown to achieve complete and partial recanalization in 33-45% and 15-35% of cases respectively. There are however, no guidelines to help determine the dose and therapeutic efficacy of anticoagulation in patients with cirrhosis. Anticoagulation therapy related bleeding is the most feared complication but it appears that the risk of variceal bleeding is more likely to be dependent on portal pressure rather than solely related to coagulation status. TIPS has also been reported to restore patency of the portal vein. Patients with complete PVT currently do not form an absolute contraindication for liver transplantation. Thrombectomy or thromboendovenectomy is possible in more than 75% of patients followed by anatomical end-to-end portal anastomosis. When patency of the portal vein and/or superior mesenteric vein is not achieved, only non-anatomical techniques (reno-portal anastomosis or cavo-portal hemitransposition) can be performed. These techniques, which do not fully reverse portal hypertension, are associated with higher morbidity and mortality risks in the short term."
CD008201,0,1433658,0,Physician practices in the management of venous thromboembolism: a community-wide survey.,"Although there is a broad consensus on the optimum approach to the management of venous thromboembolism, there are few data from which to assess the extent of compliance with these recommendations. A community-wide study was therefore conducted in 16 short-stay hospitals in central Massachusetts to assess the clinical management of venous thromboembolism. Based on validated discharge diagnostic codes, there were 1231 clinically recognized cases of venous thromboembolism, 0.8% of 148,730 discharges in the 18-month period from July 1, 1988, to December 31, 1989. Eighty-one percent of study patients were admitted with signs or symptoms of acute venous thromboembolism. Ninety-seven percent of patients were treated with either heparin, warfarin, or inferior vena caval filter. Intravenous heparin was given to 89% of patients (mean bolus 6674 IU; mean duration 6.6 days). After heparin administration, there was a mean delay of 2.3 days in starting warfarin. Assuming a corresponding decrease in the length of hospital stay, appreciable cost savings could have been realized by earlier start of oral anticoagulation. An inferior vena cava filter was placed in 14% of patients. There was a clinically recognized in-hospital recurrence of venous thromboembolism during treatment in 2% of patients. Despite a slightly lower rate of compliance with recommended treatment regimens in nonteaching hospitals, and despite less frequent use of the inferior vena cava filter, there was no significant difference in the rate of in-hospital recurrence of clinically recognized venous thromboembolism in 10 nonteaching hospitals compared with six teaching hospitals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

CD008201,0,19341590,0,[How to implement a guideline from theory to practice: the example of the venous thromboembolism prophylaxis].,"The objective of this manuscript is to discuss the existing barriers for the dissemination of medical guidelines, and to present strategies that facilitate the adaptation of the recommendations into clinical practice. The literature shows that it usually takes several years until new scientific evidence is adopted in current practice, even when there is obvious impact in patients' morbidity and mortality. There are some examples where more than thirty years have elapsed since the first case reports about the use of a effective therapy were published until its utilization became routine. That is the case of fibrinolysis for the treatment of acute myocardial infarction. Some of the main barriers for the implementation of new recommendations are: the lack of knowledge of a new guideline, personal resistance to changes, uncertainty about the efficacy of the proposed recommendation, fear of potential side-effects, difficulties in remembering the recommendations, inexistence of institutional policies reinforcing the recommendation and even economical restrains. In order to overcome these barriers a strategy that involves a program with multiple tools is always the best. That must include the implementation of easy-to-use algorithms, continuous medical education materials and lectures, electronic or paper alerts, tools to facilitate evaluation and prescription, and periodic audits to show results to the practitioners involved in the process. It is also fundamental that the medical societies involved with the specific medical issue support the program for its scientific and ethical soundness. The creation of multidisciplinary committees in each institution and the inclusion of opinion leaders that have pro-active and lasting attitudes are the key-points for the program's success. In this manuscript we use as an example the implementation of a guideline for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis, but the concepts described here can be easily applied to any other guideline. Therefore, these concepts could be very useful for institutions and services that aim at quality improvement of patient care. Changes in current medical practice recommended by guidelines may take some time. However, if there is a broader participation of opinion leaders and the use of several tools listed here, they surely have a greater probability of reaching the main objectives: improvement in provided medical care and patient safety."

Thromboprophylaxis reduces the incidence of VTE in patients with cancer; however, active cancer places patients at high risk for recurrent VTE, necessitating extended prophylactic regimens. Extended prophylaxis in patients with cancer can be problematic because of increased risk for bleeding. Oral anticoagulants, such as warfarin, have been the standard of care for extended prophylaxis, but maintaining a clinically effective level of anticoagulation can be difficult because of a wide range of drug interactions, a narrow therapeutic window, and an increased risk of bleeding complications, particularly in patients with cancer. Recent evidence indicates that long-term prophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs) is an effective and safe alternative to oral anticoagulation in patients with VTE and cancer, reducing the risk for recurrent VTE by up to 52%. LMWHs can also be seen as cost-effective for long-term prophylaxis, because higher drug acquisition costs are offset by the potential for reduced hospital stays, reduced need for coagulation monitoring, and fewer bleeding complications. Some studies suggest that LMWHs may also have direct antitumor effects and improve survival rates, most notably in patients with non-metastatic disease. Further clinical research is needed to evaluate the potential survival benefits of LMWH therapy in patients with cancer."
CD008201,0,23498067,0,[Prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism in orthopedic surgery. Role of the new anticoagulants].,"Patients undergoing a total hip or total knee arthroplasty are at high risk of thromboembolism in the postoperative period and after hospital discharge; consequently, clinical guidelines recommended thromboprophylaxis for 10-35 days. Although improved surgical techniques and widespread use of anticoagulants have substantially reduced the incidence of thromboembolic events, venous thromboembolic disease is still a dangerous complication and, in these patients, pulmonary embolism remains the main cause of death. Low molecular weight heparins have long been the mainstay of prevention. However, parenteral administration is inconvenient for many patients, which can sometimes cause poor treatment adherence. In recent years, a new class of oral, fixed-dose anticoagulants, with different mechanisms of action, few interactions and a predictable effect, has been developed. At present, a thrombin inhibitor (dabigatran) and two FXa inhibitors (rivaroxaban and apixaban) are available for prophylaxis in patients after total knee or total hip arthroplasty. In several phase III clinical trials, these drugs have been shown to have equal or superior efficacy and a similar degree of safety to conventional therapy with enoxaparin.

CD008201,0,26597608,0,Venous thromboembolism in brain tumor patients.,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a relatively common and well-described condition, affecting approximately 1-2% of the general population. VTE can lead to significant morbidity and death via pulmonary embolism (PE). During the post-operative period, VTE occurs at higher rates due to natural thrombotic responses to injury and limited post-operative mobility. In general, rates of post-operative VTE are higher in patients undergoing operations for cranial and spinal lesions than for lesions of other types, a phenomenon that is not fully explained. Proposed mechanisms include increased local synthesis of tissue factor in brain tumor patients and a higher rate of paresis in patients undergoing operations on the central nervous system. Several studies have demonstrated that other risk factors for VTE include age, sex, ethnicity, hospital stay length, and coagulation state. Tumor type and size have also been explored as potential risk factors. Despite higher rates of VTE development, neurosurgeons are often hesitant to prescribe post-operative anticoagulants for fear of hemorrhage. Here we review the literature on VTE in brain tumor patients, with a focus on their etiology, diagnosis, treatment, and prophylaxis. In most brain tumor patients, aggressive chemical and mechanical VTE prophylaxis is indicated in the post-operative period to prevent the formation of VTE."
CD008201,0,10651387,0,Guidelines for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation.,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a major independent risk factor for stroke. AF is most commonly associated with nonvalvular cardiovascular disease and is especially frequent among the elderly. The annual risk for stroke in patients with AF is approximately 5% with a wide range depending on the presence of additional risk factors. For patients who cannot successfully be converted and maintained in normal sinus rhythm (NSR), antithrombotic therapy is an effective method for preventing stroke. The 2 drugs which are indicated for stroke prophylaxis in patients with AF are warfarin and aspirin. For primary prevention, warfarin reduces the risk of stroke approximately 68%. Aspirin therapy is less effective, resulting in a 20 to 30% risk reduction. Combination therapy with aspirin and low intensity warfarin adjusted to an International Normalised Ratio (INR) of 1.2 to 1.5 has not been shown to be superior to standard intensity warfarin with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0. In patients with AF and a prior history of stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA), the absolute risk reduction with warfarin is even greater because of the high risk of stroke in this population. In contrast, aspirin has not been shown to significantly reduce the risk of stroke in patients with AF when used for secondary prevention. When appropriately managed, warfarin is associated with a low risk of major bleeding. In controlled trials of highly selected patients, the annual rate of intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) with warfarin was approximately 0.3%. Studies have shown that specialty anticoagulation clinics can achieve similar low rates of major bleeding. However, these results cannot be extrapolated to the general population. Factors which have been identified as predictors of bleeding include advanced age, number of medications and most importantly, the intensity of anticoagulation. INR values above 4.0 have been associated with an increased risk of major bleeding while values below 2.0 have been associated with thrombosis. Slow careful dosage titration, regular laboratory monitoring and patient education can substantially reduce the risk of complications. In patients with AF, antithrombotic therapy has been shown to be cost effective. For high risk patients, warfarin is the most cost-effective therapy, provided the risks for bleeding are minimised. In contrast, aspirin is the most cost-effective agent for low risk patients. Current practice guidelines for stroke prophylaxis recommend warfarin (target INR 2.5: range 2.0 to 3.0) for AF patients at high risk for stroke including those over 75 years of age or younger patients with additional risk factors. Aspirin should be reserved for low risk patients or those unable to take warfarin. Although these recommendations are strongly supported by the clinical trial evidence, studies show that many patients are not receiving appropriate antithrombotic therapy. In particular, warfarin is underutilised in high risk elderly patients. Additional studies are needed to identify barriers that prevent implementation of the clinical trial findings into clinical practice."

Current chemical pharmacological contemplates the use of heparins or fondaparinux. Other anticoagulants include coumarins and aspirin, however these oral agents can be challenging to administer and may need monitoring. When contraindications to anticoagulation in high-risk patients are present, prophylactic inferior vena cava filters can be an option to prevent pulmonary emboli. Unfortunately strong evidence about the most effective method, and the timing of their commencement, in patients with pelvic and acetabular fractures remains controversial."

CD008201,0,24238096,0,Educational outreach visits to improve nurses' use of mechanical venous thromboembolism prevention in hospitalized medical patients.,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in hospitalized medical patients. Evidence-based guidelines exist for preventing VTE; unfortunately, these guidelines are not always adhered to by clinicians. The aim of this study was to evaluate the acceptability, utility and clinical impact of an educational outreach visit (EOV) on nurses' provision of mechanical prophylaxis to hospitalized medical patients using a prospective, uncontrolled, before-and-after design. Nurses received a 1-to-1 educational session on mechanical VTE prevention by a trained nurse facilitator. The EOV intervention was designed by a multidisciplinary group of healthcare professionals using social marketing theory. Eighty-five of the 120 eligible nurses (71%) attended the EOV. The median length of each visit was 11.5 minutes (interquartile range [IQR], 10-15) and the median time spent arranging and conducting each visit was 63 minutes (IQR, 49-85). Eighty-four (99%) of the 85 participants gave a verbal commitment to trial the new evidence-based mechanical VTE prevention practices. However, there were no measurable improvements in the proportion of patients risk assessed (-1.7% improvement; 95% confidence interval [CI], -7.0 to 10.3; P = .68) or provided appropriate mechanical prophylaxis (-0.3% improvement; 95% CI, -13.4 to 14; P = .96). Researchers conclude that EOV should not be used to improve nurses' use of mechanical VTE prevention because it has no measurable impact on clinical practice and is resource intensive, requiring 4.5 minutes of preparation for every minute spent face to face with participants. Further research into the specific mechanism of action is required to explain the variability in clinical effect seen with this intervention."

Although increasing age increases perioperative morbidity and mortality, the functional age and physiologic reserve rather than chronological age is more important in preventing complications. Preparation for surgery, with special attention to functional capacity and activity, mental status, and existing comorbid conditions, can improve outcomes. Perioperative management must be tailored to physiologic changes of ageing, which affect respiratory, cardiac and renal function, as well as guidelines for preventing infection and thrombotic events. Of particular note is the enhanced effect of narcotic medications in elderly people, which affects intraoperative and postoperative management of pain. Prevention of postoperative delirium is accomplished through preoperative and postoperative planning. Discharge planning, particularly for frail elderly people, must start before surgery."
CD008201,0,22609485,0,Stopping tamoxifen peri-operatively for VTE risk reduction: a proposed management algorithm.,"Tamoxifen is a selective oestrogen receptor modulator used in pre-menopausal oestrogen receptor positive breast cancer patients as adjuvant endocrine treatment. Increased risk of venous thrombo-embolism with the use of Tamoxifen is well known from published literature. This risk further increases in patients undergoing surgical procedures of high risk involving prolonged period of immobilization, therefore withholding Tamoxifen treatment in the immediate peri-operative period should be considered as a risk reducing measure. In the absence of nationally agreed guidelines on the safe duration for stoppage of treatment in the pre and post operative period without worsening cancer prognosis, operating surgeons and individual trusts have adopted their own guidelines based on individual experience. From the available evidence in the literature on the VTE risk assessments based on age, operative procedure and pharmacokinetics of the Tamoxifen drug we would like to propose a working algorithm for selecting the right patient group and safe treatment stoppage durations. These proposed guidelines are formulated taking all the risk factors of VTE, operative risks, pharmacokinetics of the drug and chemotherapy risks into consideration. With this guidance, we aim to help surgeons across different specialities in the decision making process through a structured evidence based approach."
CD008201,0,22246948,0,Can we predict stroke in atrial fibrillation?,"Stroke prevention with appropriate thromboprophylaxis still remains central to the management of atrial fibrillation (AF). Nonetheless, stroke risk in AF is not homogeneous, but despite stroke risk in AF being a continuum, prior stroke risk stratification schema have been used to 'artificially' categorise patients into low, moderate and high risk stroke strata, so that the patients at highest risk can be identified for warfarin therapy. Data from recent large cohort studies show that by being more inclusive, rather than exclusive, of common stroke risk factors in the assessment of the risk for stroke and thromboembolism in AF patients, we can be so much better in assessing stroke risk, and in optimising thromboprophylaxis with the resultant reduction in stroke and mortality. Thus, there has been a recent paradigm shift towards getting better at identifying the 'truly low risk' patients with AF who do not even need antithrombotic therapy, whilst those with one or more stroke risk factors can be treated with oral anticoagulation, whether as well-controlled warfarin or one or the new oral anticoagulant drugs. The new European guidelines on AF have evolved to deemphasise the artificial low/moderate/high risk strata (as they were not very predictive of thromboembolism, anyway) and stressed a risk factor based approach (within the CHA(2) DS(2)-VASc score) given that stroke risk is a continuum. Those categorised as 'low risk' using the CHA(2) DS(2)-VASc score are 'truly low risk' for thromboembolism, and the CHA(2) DS(2)-VASc score performs as good as-and possibly better--than the CHADS(2) score in predicting those at 'high risk'. Indeed, those patients with a CHA(2) DS(2)-VASc score = 0 are 'truly low risk' so that no antithrombotic therapy is preferred, whilst in those with a CHA(2) DS(2)-VASc score of 1 or more, oral anticoagulation is recommended or preferred. Given that guidelines should be applicable for >80% of the time, for >80% of the patients, this stroke risk assessment approach covers the majority of the patients we commonly seen in everyday clinical practice, and considers the common stroke risk factors seen in these patients. The European guidelines also do stress that antithrombotic therapy is necessary in all patients with AF unless they are age <65 years and truly low risk. Indeed, some patients with 'female gender' only as a single risk factor (but still CHA(2) DS(2)-VASc score of 1, due to gender) do not need anticoagulation, especially if they fulfil the criterion of ""age <65 and lone AF, and very low risk"". In the European and Canadian guidelines, bleeding risk assessment is also emphasised, and the simple validated HAS-BLED score is recommended. A HAS-BLED score of ≥ 3 represents a sufficiently high risk such that caution and/or regular review of a patient is needed. It also makes the clinician think of correctable common bleeding risk factors, and the availability of such a score allows an informed assessment of bleeding risk in AF patients, when antithrombotic therapy is being initiated."

CD008201,0,26626553,0,[Diagnosis and management of acute pulmonary embolism.

In the 2014 guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) on the diagnosis and management of acute PE, several new recommendations have been issued based on new study data. Some established scores for risk stratification were developed further and there is now good evidence for the use of age-adjusted D-dimer cut-off levels. For the risk stratification in patients without clinical features of shock, the utilization of the pulmonary embolism severity index (PESI) and simplified PESI (sPESI) scores is recommended. In patients with intermediate risk, right ventricular morphology and function can be evaluated by computer tomography or echocardiography and biomarkers facilitate further risk stratification. For the treatment of patients with venous thromboembolism with or without PE, the non-vitamin K-dependent oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are a safe alternative to the standard anticoagulation regimen with heparin and vitamin K antagonists. Systemic thrombolytic therapy should be restricted to patients with high risk or intermediate high risk with hemodynamic instability. Finally, new recommendations for the diagnosis and therapy of patients with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH), with cancer or during pregnancy are given."

CD008201,0,11395717,0,Postoperative anticoagulation in vascular surgery: part 1. A retrospective comparison of clinical outcomes for unfractionated heparin versus low-molecular-weight heparin.,"The use of postoperative anticoagulation is not uncommon for patients undergoing vascular procedures, whether for adjunctive therapy to the surgical procedure or for resumption of preoperative anticoagulation. Longer postoperative length of stay is necessary to achieve an adequate therapeutic international normalized ratio with traditional protocols that call for the use of unfractionated heparin. We retrospectively examined 195 cases to determine whether low-molecular-weight heparin, specifically enoxaparin, was an effective postoperative replacement for intravenous unfractionated heparin, with the impact on postoperative length of stay. There was no difference in the frequency of complications except for increased incidence of return to surgery for graft thrombosis (n = 11) in patients who received traditional intravenous unfractionated heparin with adjusted-dose warfarin daily (n = 139, P <.02). For all 195 vascular procedures combined, the average postoperative length of stay with use of enoxoparin was shortened with use of enoxaparin (P <.0008). There was a 2-day reduction in the average postoperative length of stay for the femoral-distal procedure group (n = 18, P <.004). In the first part of the article, we summarize our findings and offer new applications and ideas for vascular nurses to consider when postoperative anticoagulation is indicated after vascular procedures. Factors contributing to safe and efficacious postoperative anticoagulation with use of low-molecular-weight heparin, specifically enoxaparin, are presented to the vascular nurse. In the second part, we discuss the roles of members of the vascular team, as well as our experience with use of enoxaparin as implemented in the clinical setting."

Therefore, in November 1991, a European Consensus Conference on the prevention of thromboembolism was held in Windsor, UK, in order to analyse the risk constellation of various patient populations and to give recommendations for primary prophylaxis in general surgery, urology, neurosurgery, orthopaedic and trauma surgery, obstetrics and gynaecology and medical patients. In addition, the cost-effectiveness of the various methods was highlighted, and the question of secondary prevention addressed. The meeting was organized under the patronage of the European Economic Commission, and experts from 15 different countries were invited to participate. The conference was organized according to acknowledged guidelines of consensus conference organization, i.e. each expert had to formulate his provisional standpoint, the working documents were compiled by the organizer, and this file was sent to the delegates before the conference. During the first part of the meeting, the delegates presented their views in plenary sessions. Controversial points were discussed in working groups, and the results were discussed in plenary sessions.

CD008201,0,26733269,0,The Anti-Factor Xa Range For Low Molecular Weight Heparin Thromboprophylaxis.,"Low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs) are now the mainstay option in the prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism. In some patients receiving therapeutic doses of LMWH, activity can be measured by quantifying the presence of Anti-factor Xa (AFXa) for dose adjustment. However, currently there are no guidelines for LMWH monitoring in patients on thromboprophylactic, doses, despite certain patient populations may be at risk of suboptimal dosing. This review found that while the AFXa ranges for therapeutic levels of LMWHs are relatively well defined in the literature, prophylactic ranges are much less clear, thus making it difficult to interpret current research data. From the studies published to date, we concluded that a reasonable AFXa target range for LMWH deep venous thromboses prophylaxis might be 0.2-0.5 IU/mL."

An optimal strategy of thromboprophylaxis is very important. In our two groups of patients we compared two ways of prophylaxis both during hospitalization and after hospital discharge. 81 patients in the first group were treated with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) - Fraxiparine during the stay in hospital and with a combination of three drugs - Aspirin, Curantyl and Secatoxin during 3 months after operation. 85 patients in the second group were also treated with LMWH during the stay in hospital but LMWH was early changed for Warfarin. Warfarin was taken 3 months after operation. We assessed the occurence of clinical manifest thrombotic events-deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism confirmed by Doppler ultrasonography and perfusion lung scanning. Manifest clinical thrombosis did not occur during hospitalization in the first group of patients but two thrombosis were proven in the second group. Bleeding complications were assessed as well. These complications occurred in two patients during the stay in hospital in the first group, and in three patients in the second group. None of our patients in both groups suffered from a late occurrence of clinically significant thrombosis. Currently we recommend the administration of LMWH during hospitalization, and elastis stockings to all patients after hospital discharge.

CD008201,0,12067281,0,Outpatient management of DVT using low molecular weight heparin and a hospital outreach service.,"In recent years there have been several studies comparing the efficacy and safety of low molecular weight (LMW) and unfractionated heparin for the treatment of deep venous thrombosis (DVT), showing them in the clinical trial setting to be equal in these regards. LMWH has the advantage of once daily subcutaneous injection and daily monitoring of levels is not usually required. This has led many centres to develop outpatient treatment strategies for these patients but evidence for the safety of this approach is scarce. In 1997 we developed a hospital outreach service for the treatment of patients with DVT and, in a retrospective study, have compared the outcome in 172 patients treated at home with 172 age, sex and thrombotic risk factor matched inpatients treated at our institution with unfractionated heparin. Five patients in the home treatment group suffered a haemorrhagic event, compared with six patients in the hospital group. One patient in the home treatment group had a recurrent DVT within the first 3 months of treatment; in the hospital-treated group, six patients had recurrent DVTs and nine developed pulmonary emboli. At 3 months, there were three deaths in the home treatment group, compared with five deaths in the hospital group. There was no difference in re-admission rate at 3 months: 23 in the home treatment group, 24 in the hospital-treated group. Average length of hospital stay for the home-treatment group was 2.1 days and 12 days for the hospital group. Warfarin control was found to be significantly better in those patients treated at home, and only 18% of patients treated in hospital received heparin according to hospital guidelines. In conclusion, outpatient management of patients with DVT using LMWH is as safe as hospitalization and continuous infusion of unfractionated heparin. The complication rate was lower in the home treatment group and, in particular, the incidence of recurrent thrombosis was significantly less in the home treatment group. In addition, warfarin control was better when managed by specialist nurses. Patients expressed a preference for home treatment."

The benefit of this treatment is particularly evident in patients in whom atrial fibrillation is associated with a major risk factor for systemic thromboembolism (patients > 75 years of age, history of hypertension, previous left ventricular failure or previous systemic thromboembolism) or those in whom two minor risk factors are present (patients between 65 and 75 years of age, diabetes, ischemic heart disease). According to these recommendations, all the patients > 75 years of age with chronic or paroxysmal atrial fibrillation should receive oral anticoagulant treatment to maintain an INR between 2.0 and 3.0. However, as the risk of bleeding during oral anticoagulant treatment increases with age, the benefit/risk ratio should always be evaluated in elderly patients. Although high risk patients do not benefit from aspirin treatment, aspirin or other antiplatelet agents might be indicated in medium risk patients or in those in whom the risk of bleeding with oral anticoagulants is considered too high. New antithrombotic regimens will be tested in the near future."

Part 1: prophylaxis.,"Patients with cancer are at increased risk of venous thromboembolism (vte). Anticoagulation therapy has been shown to prevent vte; however, unique clinical circumstances in patients with cancer can often complicate the decisions surrounding the administration of prophylactic anticoagulation. No national Canadian guidelines on the prevention of cancer-associated thrombosis have been published. We therefore aimed to develop a consensus-based, evidence-informed guideline on the topic. PubMed was searched for clinical trials and meta-analyses published between 2002 and 2013. Reference lists of key articles were hand-searched for additional publications. Content experts from across Canada were assembled to review the evidence and make recommendations. Low molecular weight heparin can be used prophylactically in cancer patients at high risk of developing vte. Direct oral anticoagulants are not recommended for vte prophylaxis at this time. Specific clinical scenarios, including renal insufficiency, thrombocytopenia, liver disease, and obesity can warrant modifications in the administration of prophylactic anticoagulant therapy. There is no evidence to support the monitoring of anti-factor Xa levels in clinically stable cancer patients receiving prophylactic anticoagulation; however, factor Xa levels could be checked at baseline and periodically in patients with renal insufficiency. The use of anticoagulation therapy to prolong survival in cancer patients without the presence of risk factors for vte is not recommended."

CD008201,0,12472045,0,Percutaneous treatment for carotid stenosis.,"Stroke is the leading cause of serious long-term disability in the United States. A substantial portion of strokes are caused by atherosclerotic carotid artery disease. The conventional risk factors for coronary atherosclerosis are also responsible for carotid atherosclerosis. Carotid stenosis is encountered in medical practice in either symptomatic or asymptomatic states. In symptomatic patients, medical management with antiplatelet agents does not provide adequate protection against stroke. Carotid endarterectomy can help reduce the risk of a subsequent stroke. Asymptomatic patients with severe carotid stenosis can also benefit from surgical intervention if endarterectomy can be performed at a low operative risk. In recent years, percutaneous carotid stenting using self-expanding stents has become popular for the treatment of carotid stenosis. Although this initial experience has been reported from a high-risk patient population, the results are encouraging, with acceptable periprocedural stroke rates. Moreover, emboli protection devices, modern adjuvant pharmacotherapy, and modern self-expanding stents were not utilized in these studies. With rapidly expanding technology and advances in interventional pharmacology, improvement of clinical outcome is likely. Table 3 summarizes current recommendations for carotid stenting based on a panel of cardiologists, radiologists, and vascular surgeons. At this stage, randomized trials to compare endarterectomy with carotid stenting are underway. Cautious optimism is necessary until the optimal equipment, emboli protection devices, and adjuvant pharmacotherapies are fully investigated. Until then, carotid stenting should be restricted to high-risk candidates for carotid endarterectomy, including patients with severe cardiac comorbidities, previous neck surgeries or radiation, restenosis after endarterectomy, or other technical contraindications for surgery."
CD008201,0,24497538,0,Duration of anticoagulant therapy for deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.,"It takes about 3 months to complete ""active treatment"" of venous thromboembolism (VTE), with further treatment serving to prevent new episodes of thrombosis (""pure secondary prevention""). Consequently, VTE should generally be treated for either 3 months or indefinitely (exceptions will be described in the text). The decision to stop anticoagulants at 3 months or to treat indefinitely is dominated by the long-term risk of recurrence, and secondarily influenced by the risk of bleeding and by patient preference. VTE provoked by a reversible risk factor, or a first unprovoked isolated distal (calf) deep vein thrombosis (DVT), has a low risk of recurrence and is usually treated for 3 months. VTE associated with active cancer, or a second unprovoked VTE, has a high risk of recurrence and is usually treated indefinitely. The decision to stop anticoagulants at 3 months or to treat indefinitely is more finely balanced after a first unprovoked proximal DVT or pulmonary embolism (PE). Indefinite anticoagulation is often chosen if there is a low risk of bleeding, whereas anticoagulation is usually stopped at 3 months if there is a high risk of bleeding. The decision to continue anticoagulation indefinitely after a first unprovoked proximal DVT or PE is strengthened if the patient is male, the index event was PE rather than DVT, and/or d-dimer testing is positive 1 month after stopping anticoagulant therapy."

Moreover, VTE impacts significantly on morbidity and mortality in cancer patients. Anticoagulation for prevention and treatment of VTE requires a patient-centred approach due to the heterogeneous patient population and inherent increased thrombotic and bleeding risks. In recent years, low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) injections have come to be the mainstay for treatment and prevention of cancer-related VTE. For treatment, this is usually administered for at least 6 months and continued in patients with active cancer or those receiving treatment for cancer. The use of LMWH for thromboprophylaxis in hospitalised cancer patients is also well accepted, but out-of-hospital prophylaxis remains contentious. The development of risk assessment models may help identify the patients at highest risk. The role of the new oral factor Xa and thrombin inhibitors in this setting remains to be determined."

Patients were traced by questionnaires, outpatient appointments and by telephone. Post-mortem records were used to verify cause of death. Follow-up was 100%. The death rate from PE was 0.16% (CI 0.04%-0.57%) and the all-cause mortality rate was 0.47% (CI 0.22%-1.02%). All deaths were within the first 10 days during the initial hospitalisation. The patient mortality was compared with the population mortality for England and Wales, using standardised mortality ratios (SMRs). The SMR for both sexes combined was 1.08 (CI 0.4-2.36). We observed a lower mortality in females (SMR=0.58; CI 0.07-2.09) but a higher mortality in males (SMR=1.91; CI 0.52-4.9) during the first 42 postoperative days compared to the general population.

Patients with pulmonary embolism (PE), deep venous thrombosis (DVT), or venous thromboembolism (VTE) at hospital discharge following laparoscopic cholecystectomy were identified from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample. From 1998 through 2009, 4 107 430 laparoscopic cholecystectomies were performed. The in-hospital prevalence of PE was 0.15%, DVT was 0.40%, and VTE was 0.53%. The prevalence of PE increased from 0.04% in patients aged 21 to 30 years to 0.31% in patients aged 71 to 80 years. Deaths due to in-hospital PE were 780 (0.02%) of the 4 107 430 laparoscopic cholecystectomies. The rate of death increased with age. The prevalence of VTE following laparoscopic cholecystectomy is low and fatal PE is rare. The risk of VTE increased with age, as did the risk of death in those who had PE. These data may be useful in assessing the use of thromboprophylaxis in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy."

From October 1991 to September 1994, 40 patients with stage II or III breast cancer involving 10 or more nodes were treated with CTCb after six cycles of adjuvant therapy with an anthracycline-containing regimen. Bone marrow (BM) was used as the source hematopoietic stem cell in the first 23 patients and G-CSF-mobilized peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC) in the other 17. No therapy-related deaths occurred, but three life-threatening Complications were recorded which resolved: bilateral pulmonary hemorrhage, veno-occlusive disease of the liver and pulmonary thromboembolism. PBPC result in faster hemopoietic reconstitution with significantly lower transfusion requirements. With a median follow-up of 35 months (23-59) actuarial event-free survival for the study patients at 3 years is 72% (CI 95%: 66-81%). Even in patients over 50-60 years, CTCb is a relatively well tolerated regimen which appears, after a median follow-up of nearly 3 years, to decrease relapse frequency as compared with historical series, although a definite role of HDT in the treatment of high-risk primary breast cancer needs confirmation in prospective randomized trials."

CD008201,0,19438502,0,Does acetyl salicylic acid (ASA) have a role in the prevention of venous thromboembolism?,"Guidelines differ on whether acetyl salicylic acid (ASA, aspirin) should be used for prophylaxis in patients at high-risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), principally because of differences in perceptions of its efficacy. ASA is an attractive therapeutic option because it is inexpensive, easy to administer and does not require monitoring. We critically reappraised the evidence from randomized controlled trials for the efficacy of ASA in VTE prevention. ASA is clearly efficacious in preventing VTE compared to placebo or no treatment, but appears to be less efficacious than the low molecular weight heparins in small trials. There is little data for ASA in comparison with unfractionated heparin and warfarin. A large randomized controlled trial is required to clarify the role of ASA compared to contemporary anticoagulant strategies for the prevention of VTE."

Low-molecular-weight heparins have better bioavailability and more predictable anticoagulant activity than standard heparin and thus can be administered without routine laboratory monitoring. Randomized trials comparing subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin administered primarily at home with inpatient intravenous standard heparin have established the safety and efficacy of outpatient treatment of selected patients. However, many patients were excluded from these studies. The benefits demonstrated in carefully controlled clinical trials of outpatient treatment of deep vein thrombosis required a complex multidisciplinary organization of medical care that is not readily achievable in routine practice. A structured protocol is necessary to ensure that patient care is optimal. The essential components of an outpatient program include appropriate patient selection, adequate patient education, daily follow-up during therapy with low-molecular-weight heparin, and easy access to health-care professionals."

CD008201,0,14710693,0,"Critical issues in hematology: anemia, thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, and blood product transfusions in critically ill patients.","Systematic evaluations of anemia, thrombocytopenia, and coagulopathy are essential to identifying and managing their causes successfully. In all cases, clinicians should evaluate RBC measurements alongside WBC and platelet counts and WBC differentials. Multiple competing factors may coexist; certain factors affect RBCs independent of those that affect WBCs or platelets. Ideally, clinicians should examine the peripheral blood smear for morphologic features of RBCs, WBCs, and platelets that provide important clues to the cause of the patient's hematologic disorder. Thrombocytopenia arises from decreased platelet production, increased platelet destruction, or dilutional or distributional causes. Drug-induced thrombocytopenias present diagnostic challenges, because many medicines can cause thrombocytopenia and critically ill patients often receive multiple medications. If they suspect type II HIT, clinicians must promptly discontinue all heparin sources, including LMWHs, without awaiting laboratory confirmation, to avoid thrombotic sequelae. Because warfarin anticoagulation induces acquired protein C deficiency, thereby exacerbating the prothrombotic state of type II HIT, warfarin should be withheld until platelet counts increase to more than 100,000/microL and type II HIT is clearly resolving. The presence of a consumptive coagulopathy in the setting of thrombocytopenia supports a diagnosis of DIC, not TTP-HUS, and is demonstrated by decreasing serum fibrinogen levels, and increasing TTs, PTs, aPTTs, and fibrin degradation products. Increasing D-dimer, levels are the most specific DIC parameter and reflect fibrinolysis of cross-linked fibrin. Elevated PTs or a PTTs can result from the absence of factors or the presence of inhibitors. Clinicians should suspect factor inhibitors when the prolonged PT or aPTT does not correct or only partially corrects following an immediate assay of a 1:1 mix of patient and normal plasma. In addition to factor inhibitors, antiphospholipid antibodies (e.g., lupus anticoagulant) can produce a prolonged aPTT that does not correct with normal plasma but is overcome by adding excess phospholipid or platelets. Paradoxically, a tendency to thrombosis, not bleeding, accompanies lupus anticoagulants and the antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. Transfusion of red blood cells, platelets, or plasma products is sometimes warranted, but clinicians must carefully weigh potential benefits against known risks. In critically ill patients, administering RBCs can enhance oxygen delivery to tissues. Among euvolemic patients who do not have ischemic heart disease, guidelines recommend a transfusion threshold of HGB levels in the range of 6.0 to 8.0 g/dL; patients who have HGB that is at least 10.0 g/dL are unlikely to benefit from blood transfusion. The use of rHuEPO to increase erythropoiesis offers an alternative to RBC transfusion, assuming normal, responsive progenitor cells and adequate iron, folate, and cobalamin stores. Future research should examine whether clinical outcomes from rHuEPO use in critically ill patients are important and cost-effective. Because platelets play an instrumental role in primary hemostasis, platelet transfusions are often important in managing patients who are bleeding or at risk of bleeding with thrombocytopenia or impaired platelet function. Platelet transfusions carry risks, and decisions to transfuse platelets must consider clinical circumstances. Most important, platelet transfusions are generally contraindicated if the underlying disorder is TTP or type II HIT, because platelet transfusion in these settings may fuel thrombosis and worsen clinical signs and symptoms. Plasma products can correct hemostasis when bleeding arises from malfunction, consumption, or underproduction of plasma coagulation proteins. Choice of plasma product for transfusion depends on clinical circumstances. FFP is the most commonly used plasma product to correct clotting factor deficiencies, particularly coagulopathies that are attributable to multiple clotting factor deficiency states as in liver disease, DIC, or warfarin anticoagulation. PCC or rFVIIa that is administered in small volumes may provide advantages over FFP when coagulopathies require quick reversal without risk of volume overload. Factor concentrates can replace specific factor deficiencies. Recombinant FVIIa bypasses inhibitors to factors VIII and IX and vWF. Use of rFVIIa in managing hemostatic abnormalities from severe liver dysfunction; extensive surgery, trauma, or bleeding; excessive warfarin anticoagulation; and certain platelet disorders requires further study to determine optimal and cost-effective dosing regimens. Recombinant activated protein C reduces mortality from severe sepsis that is associated with organ dysfunction in adults who are at high risk for death (APACHE scores of at least 25). In severe sepsis, levels of protein C decrease, as do fibrinogen and platelet levels. Because of its anticoagulant effect, however, drotrecogin alfa may induce bleeding. Guidelines for drotrecogin alfa use must take into account bleeding risks."

CD008201,0,14718485,0,The prevention of venous thromboembolism in older adults: guidelines.,"The rationale for thromboprophylaxis is based on the high prevalence of venous thromboembolism (VTE), a disorder involving deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), among hospitalized patients, the clinically silent nature of VTE in most patients, and the morbidity, cost, and potential mortality associated with unprevented thromboembolism. Both DVT and PE cause few specific symptoms, and the clinical diagnosis is unreliable. Since the first clinical manifestation of VTE may be fatal PE, it is inappropriate to wait for symptoms before treatment. Unrecognized and untreated DVT may also cause the postphlebitic syndrome and predispose patients to subsequent episodes of recurrent VTE. Routine screening for VTE has also not been shown to reduce the incidence of symptomatic VTE or fatal PE. Use of effective methods of prophylaxis is more cost effective and is safer than selective, intensive screening for VTE. This article reviews current recommendations for the prevention of VTE as they apply to older adults. The recommendations discussed are based on the Sixth American College of Chest Physicians Consensus Conference on Antithrombotic Therapy reported in Chest. 2001;119:132S-175S."

At the time of this study preventing venous thromboembolism (VTE) among in-patients was one of the top priorities for hospital safety in the English National Health Service (NHS). An analysis of 50 interviews examining hospital professionals' perceptions about VTE risks and prophylaxis illuminates how National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines influenced clinical decision-making in four hospitals in one NHS region. We examine four themes: the identification of new risks, the institutionalisation and management of risk, the relationship between risk and danger and the tensions between risk management systems and expert decision-making. The implementation of NICE guidelines for VTE prevention extended managerial control over risk management but some irreducible clinical dangers remained that were beyond the scope of the new VTE risk management systems. Linking sociologies of risk with the realities of hospital risk management reveals the capacity of these theories to illuminate both the possibilities and the limits of managerialism in health care."
CD008201,0,24061558,0,Incidence of venous thromboembolism in the setting of hematopoietic cell transplantation.,"The underlying risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) is unclear in patients undergoing hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). As such, these patients should still be considered at risk for development of VTE due to factors such as their underlying malignancy and the marked inflammatory state that develops from treatment. The purpose of this study was to characterize the incidence of VTE in patients undergoing HCT. Retrospective chart review of patients from the Indiana University Stem Cell Transplant Unit treated between January 1, 2008, and May 24, 2011. Patients were older than 18 years and had undergone HCT. The primary objective was to analyze the incidence of VTE in patients undergoing autologous HCT versus allogeneic HCT. Secondary objectives included documentation of VTE treatment strategies and time to occurrence of VTE. Of the 567 patients who underwent autologous HCT, 14 developed VTE (2.5%), whereas 5 of the 180 patients who underwent allogeneic HCT developed VTE (2.8%; P = 1.000). The median time to development of VTE from admission for HCT was 12 days in the autologous HCT arm versus 19 days in the allogeneic HCT arm (P = 0.610). The most commonly used VTE treatment strategy was enoxaparin (12 out of 19 VTEs). This study illustrates that VTE does occur rarely in patients who have undergone HCT. The optimal treatment regimen in this population requires further evaluation. Until a reliable protocol for treatment and evidence for risk factors are established, providers should be vigilant for occurrence of VTE in these patients."

CD008201,0,15563247,0,Pharmacological cardioversion of atrial fibrillation: current management and treatment options.,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common form of arrhythmia, carrying high social costs. It is usually first seen by general practitioners or in emergency departments. Despite the availability of consensus guidelines, considerable variations exist in treatment practice, especially outside specialised cardiological settings. Cardioversion to sinus rhythm aims to: (i) restore the atrial contribution to ventricular filling/output; (ii) regularise ventricular rate; and (iii) interrupt atrial remodelling. Cardioversion always requires careful assessment of potential proarrhythmic and thromboembolic risks, and this translates into the need to personalise treatment decisions. Among the many clinical variables that affect strategy selection, time from onset is crucial. In selected patients, pharmacological cardioversion of recent-onset AF can be a safely used, feasible and effective approach, even in internal medicine and emergency departments. In most cases of recent-onset AF, pharmacological cardioversion provides an important--and probably more cost effective--alternative to electrical cardioversion, which can then be employed as a second-line therapy for nonresponders. Class IC agents (flecainide or propafenone), which can be safely used in hospitalised patients with recent-onset AF without left ventricular dysfunction, can provide rapid conversion to sinus rhythm after either intravenous administration or oral loading. Although intravenous amiodarone requires longer conversion times, it is still the standard treatment for patients with heart failure. Ibutilide also provides good conversion rates and could be used for AF patients with left ventricular dysfunction (were it not for high costs). For long-lasting AF most pharmacological treatments have only limited efficacy and electrical cardioversion remains the gold standard in this setting. However, a widely used strategy involves pretreatment with amiodarone in the weeks before planned electrical cardioversion: this provides optimal prophylaxis and can sometimes even restore sinus rhythm. Dofetilide may also be capable of restoring sinus rhythm in up to 25-30% of patients and can be used in patients with heart failure. The potential risk of proarrhythmia increases the need for careful therapeutic decision making and management of pharmacological cardioversion. The results of recent trials (AFFIRM [Atrial Fibrillation Follow-up Investigation of Rhythm Management] and RACE [Rate Control versus Electrical Cardioversion for Persistent Atrial Fibrillation]) on rate versus rhythm control strategies in the long term have led to a generalised shift in interest towards rate control. Although carefully designed studies are required to better define the role of pharmacological rhythm control in specific AF settings, this alternative option remains a recommendable strategy for many patients, especially those in acute care."

Using Continuous Quality Improvement concepts, this study revisits Robin's concerns and assesses the conformance of clinical practice at one institution with established requirements for the diagnosis and treatment of venous thromboembolic disease to identify remaining opportunities to improve care. The study design is a retrospective chart review. Medical records of all patients (N = 63) discharged from a university-affiliated teaching hospital from 7/1/89 to 6/30/90 with a diagnosis of primary venous thromboembolic disease were studied. Requirements for the diagnosis and treatment were established through review of the medical literature. Conformance to these requirements was assessed and described. Descriptive statistics were used. Only 7 of 63 charts (11%) met all requirements for the diagnosis and treatment of venous thromboembolic disease. Fifty-six charts (89%) failed to meet at least one criterion. There was no evidence of overdiagnosis of venous thromboembolic disease in patients with a discharge diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (N = 17). Eight of 62 patients (13%) demonstrated potential overdiagnosis of venous thromboembolic disease involving the lower extremities. Nine of 60 (15%) heparin therapies demonstrated significant nonconformance to recommendations. Fifty-four of 59 (91%) warfarin therapies failed to conform to recommendations. Eighty-three percent of these warfarin errors were considered to be technical. However, 17% were determined to be clinically significant.

We assessed post-operative VTE prophylaxis prescribed and received in a prospective registry, compared with the 2004 American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) guidelines in high-risk orthopaedic surgery patients. Consecutive patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty (THA), hip fracture surgery (HFS), or knee arthroplasty (KA) were enrolled at discharge from 161 centres in 17 European countries if they had received in-hospital VTE prophylaxis that was considered in accordance with the ACCP guidelines by the treating physician. Data on prescribed and actual prophylaxis were obtained from hospital charts and patient post-discharge diaries. Post-operative prophylaxis prescribed and actual prophylaxis received were considered adherent or adequate, respectively, if recommended therapies were used for ≥28 days (HFS and THA) or ≥10 days (KA). Among 4,388 patients, 69.9% were prescribed ACCP-adherent VTE prophylaxis (THA: 1,411/2,217 [63.6%]; HFS: 701/1,112 [63.0%]; KA: 955/1,059 [90.2%]). Actual prophylaxis received was described in 3,939 patients with an available diary after discharge (non-evaluability rate of 10%). Mean actual durations of pharmacological prophylaxis from surgery were: 28.4 ± 13.7 (THA), 29.3 ± 13.9 (HFS), and 28.7 ± 14.1 days (KA). ACCP-adequate VTE prophylaxis was received by 66.5% of patients (60.9% THA, 55.4% HFS, and 88.7% KA). Prophylaxis inadequacies were mainly due to inadequate prescription, non-recommended prophylaxis prescription at discharge, or too short prophylaxis prescribed. In high-risk orthopaedic surgery patients with hospital-initiated prophylaxis, there is a gap between ACCP recommendations, prescribed and actual prophylaxis received, mainly due to inadequate prescription at discharge."

CD008201,0,21466509,0,HPV infection and cervical disease: a review.,"Cervical cancer remains a significant problem worldwide particularly in underdeveloped countries. The disease and its financial impact are significant. Infection with the human papilloma virus (HPV) is necessary for the development of cervical cancer and its precursors. HPV also causes precancer and cancer elsewhere in the lower genital tract in women and men, as well as cancers of the aerodigestive tract. Whilst non-sexual transmission has been reported, the usual method of transmission is by sexual intercourse with the virus deposited on the basement membrane of the cervical epithelium. It is then taken up by the basal cells, and viral amplification occurs with the maturation of the squamous epithelium. During this process, it remains hidden from the host immune system, thus not mounting an immune response in many instances. About half of the women infected with HPV do not develop clinically detected serum antibody levels and are thus at risk of re-infection with the same HPV type. HPV vaccination produces sustained levels of serum-neutralising antibodies and has been shown to be effective in reducing disease caused by the vaccine-associated HPV types. Vaccination is considered well tolerated and safe with syncope and venous thromboembolism reported more frequently that would be expected. Vaccination will not protect against pre-existing HPV infection and hence may not provide complete protection in all women, and as the duration of protection is not known, for the time being routine Pap testing screening according to the Australian guidelines should continue."
CD008201,0,26379411,0,Trousseau's syndrome in a patient with advanced stage gastric cancer.,"Patients with cancer are at high risk for thrombotic events, which are known collectively as Trousseau's syndrome. Herein, we report a 66-year-old male patient who was diagnosed with terminal stage gastric cancer and liver metastasis and who had an initial clinical presentation of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Acute ischemia of the left lower leg that resulted in gangrenous changes occurred during admission. Subsequent angiography of the left lower limb was then performed. This procedure revealed arterial thrombosis of the left common iliac artery with extension to the external iliac artery, the left common iliac artery, the posterior tibial artery, and the peroneal artery, which were occluded by thrombi. Aspiration of the thrombi demonstrated that these were not tumor thrombi. The interesting aspect of our case was that the disease it presented as arterial thrombotic events, which may correlate with gastric adenocarcinoma. In summary, we suggested that the unexplained thrombotic events might be one of the initial presentations of occult malignancy and that thromboprophylaxis should always be considered."

Following an intervention program, which included staff meetings, development of local protocols, and academic detailing by a nurse, the survey was repeated."
CD008201,0,24711136,0,What are the current clinical issues in wear and tribocorrosion?,"Wear and corrosion in joint arthroplasty are important causes of failure. From the standpoint of current clinical importance, there are four main categories of wear and tribocorrosion: polyethylene wear, ceramic-on-ceramic (CoC) bearing wear, metal-on-metal (MoM) bearing wear, and taper tribocorrosion. Recently, problems with wear in the knee have become less prominent as have many issues with hip polyethylene (PE) bearings resulting from the success of crosslinked PE. However, MoM articulations and taper tribocorrosion have been associated with soft tissue inflammatory responses, and as a result, they have become prominent clinical concerns. WHERE ARE WE NOW?: For PE wear in the hip, several advances include improved locking mechanisms and data supporting highly crosslinked polyethylenes (HXLPE). Edge-loading in CoC articulations can contribute to stripe wear and subsequent squeaking. For MoM articulations, the relationship of wear-to-edge loading, sensitivity to component positioning, typical soft tissue response, and use of imaging is increasingly understood. Taper tribocorrosion (from femoral head-neck junctions and other modular elements) and associated soft tissue inflammatory responses appear to be serious clinical issues that are not fully understood. WHERE DO WE NEED TO GO?: In the knee, clinical concerns remain with the efficacy of HXLPE, modular connections, and metal allergies. For PE wear in the hip, concerns remain regarding how to increase crosslinking of PE while minimizing PE fractures. With CoC articulations, questions remain on how to prevent noises, chipping, and impingement and if enhanced designs can contribute to improved results. For MoM articulations, we need to improve imaging tests for soft tissue reactions, determine best practices in terms of monitoring protocols, and better define if, how, and when to act on serum metal levels. For taper tribocorrosion, we need to use modularity wisely and also understand how to improve tapers and materials in the future. For patients at risk for tribocorrosion, we need to define realistic diagnostic and monitoring protocols. We also need to enhance revision methods, and the threshold of acceptable soft tissue damage, to minimize complications associated with soft tissue damage such as hip instability. HOW DO WE GET THERE?: HXLPE and other bearing surfaces will likely continue to be refined. We need to develop tapers with more resistance to tribocorrosion through improved understanding of the manufacturing process and ongoing engineering improvements. Revision procedures for wear and tribocorrosion can be enhanced by determining when partial component retention is appropriate and how best to manage soft tissue damage. For CoC articulations, enhanced designs are required to minimize noises, chipping, and impingement. Importantly, we must continue to promote and analyze joint replacement registries to identify early failures and analyze long-term successes."
CD008201,0,23677515,0,High incidence of venous thromboembolism despite electronic alerts for thromboprophylaxis in hospitalised cancer patients.,"Many cancer patients are at high risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) during hospitalisation; nevertheless, thromboprophylaxis is frequently underused. Electronic alerts (e-alerts) have been associated with improvement in thromboprophylaxis use and a reduction of the incidence of VTE, both during hospitalisation and after discharge, particularly in the medical setting. However, there are no data regarding the benefit of this tool in cancer patients. Our aim was to evaluate the impact of a computer-alert system for VTE prevention in patients with cancer, particularly in those admitted to the Oncology/Haematology ward, comparing the results with the rest of inpatients at a university teaching hospital. The study included 32,167 adult patients hospitalised during the first semesters of years 2006 to 2010, 9,265 (28.8%) with an active malignancy. Appropriate prophylaxis in medical patients, significantly increased over time (from 40% in 2006 to 57% in 2010) and was maintained over 80% in surgical patients. However, while e-alerts were associated with a reduction of the incidence of VTE during hospitalisation in patients without cancer (odds ratio [OR] 0.31; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.15-0.64), the impact was modest in cancer patients (OR 0.89; 95% CI, 0.42-1.86) and no benefit was observed in patients admitted to the Oncology/Haematology Departments (OR 1.11; 95% CI, 0.45-2.73). Interestingly, 60% of VTE episodes in cancer patients during recent years developed despite appropriate prophylaxis. Contrary to the impact on hospitalised patients without cancer, implementation of e-alerts for VTE risk did not prevent VTE effectively among those with malignancies."

CD008201,0,15670021,0,Video laparoscopic surgery: is out-of-hospital thromboprophylaxis necessary?,"Despite widespread use of laparoscopic procedures, no adequate data are available to support specific recommendations for venous thromboprophylaxis in patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery. This prospective, randomized trial is the first to be designed to evaluate a regimen of out-of-hospital thromboprophylaxis after laparoscopic surgery. Consecutive patients admitted for laparoscopic surgery were considered for the study. The thromboprophylaxis regimen used for each patient was based on a risk score. Possible thromboprophylactic measures included elastic stockings and pre- and postoperative Dalteparin or early ambulation. At discharge, patients were randomly allocated either to continue Dalteparin for 1 week, or to receive no further prophylaxis. Patients judged to be at low risk were not randomized. Compression ultrasound of the leg veins was performed in all patients 4 weeks after hospital discharge. Fifty-three patients, all with acute appendicitis, were judged to be at low risk of deep vein thrombosis and were not included in the randomized study. The remaining 209 patients fell into two groups: 104 patients received postdischarge Dalteparin and 105 patients did not. The incidence of deep vein thrombosis was 0% (0 of 104) vs. 0.95% (one of 105), respectively (P = 1.00). The risk of postdischarge venous thromboembolism is low in patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery who receive in-hospital thromboprophylaxis. Given this low risk, a clinical trial powered to determine if extending prophylaxis in such patients reduces the risk of clinically apparent deep vein thrombosis would be unfeasibly large."
CD008201,0,22518391,0,Atrial fibrillation: the rate versus rhythm management controversy.,"The fundamental management strategy for atrial fibrillation (AF) is still debated. There is no doubt that those patients at risk of thromboembolic events should be offered anticoagulant therapy. However, it is uncertain whether rhythm control (restoration and maintenance of sinus rhythm) or rate control (adjustment to a physiological ventricular rate while allowing AF to continue) is the preferred primary treatment option for the reduction of symptoms and major cardiovascular (CV) outcomes associated with AF. Several well conducted trials comparing the two strategies led to the conclusion that there was little to choose between them. However, guidelines leaned towards recommending rate control as the initial strategy, and reserved rhythm control for those who remained symptomatic. Recently this status quo is being increasingly challenged by the clear demonstration that left atrial catheter ablation is effective at suppressing AF resistant to traditional antiarrhythmic drugs, such as those that failed to demonstrate any superiority when compared with rate control. Also, recently introduced antiarrhythmic therapy may have superior efficacy with regard to reducing unexpected CV hospitalization, CV mortality and stroke. In addition, there is a growing perception that atrial remodelling should be best prevented by early rhythm control rather than delaying until rate control has proven unsatisfactory. For these reasons the results of large randomised clinical trials, which recruit patients soon after the presentation of AF and compare 'aggressive' modern rhythm control against the guideline approach of primary rate control, are eagerly awaited. In the meantime the pendulum of clinical opinion has begun to swing towards a rhythm control strategy."

CD008201,0,14627252,0,Sequential compression devices as prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism in high-risk colorectal surgery patients: reconsidering American Society of Colorectal Surgeons parameters.,"The American Society of Colorectal Surgeons (ASCRS) recently endorsed low-molecular-weight heparin and low-dose heparin as primary prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism (VTE) in highest-risk patients. Our study evaluates the feasibility of sequential compression device (SCD) use for VTE prophylaxis in these patients. Computerized databases of discharge diagnoses from three hospitals were reviewed. All patients with colorectal cancer or inflammatory bowel disease during a 7-year period were identified. Those who underwent major abdominal surgery and received VTE prophylaxis exclusively with SCDs were selected for the study. Patients diagnosed with postoperative VTE were identified through review of the three databases and of patient records for 90 days after surgery. One thousand two hundred eighty-one patients classified as highest-risk under the published ASCRS parameters underwent major abdominal surgery and received SCDs perioperatively. The incidence of clinically detectable postoperative VTE was 0.78 per cent. There were trends toward lower incidence among patients with malignancy (0.53%) compared with inflammatory bowel disease (1.48%, P = 0.09), and those with abdominal compared to pelvic procedures (0.62% vs. 1.04%, P = 0.41). Prophylaxis for perioperative VTE solely with SCD is a viable option for patients classified as highest-risk under ASCRS parameters."
CD008201,0,15055490,0,Safety syringes can reduce the risk of needlestick injury in venous thromboembolism prophylaxis.,"Patients undergoing major orthopaedic surgery of the lower extremities are at high risk of developing venous thromboembolism (VTE). Pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis has greatly reduced the likelihood of VTE. The most effective medications are administered once or twice daily by subcutaneous injection, a drug delivery route associated with an increased risk of needlestick injury. Awareness of the potential lethality of needlestick injuries has increased during the past decade, resulting in the development of national safety guidelines from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration on the handling and management of needles and other sharps. This article reviews the potential risks and costs associated with needlestick injury during the administration of VTE prophylaxis in patients undergoing major orthopaedic surgery. The development of novel anticoagulants and accompanying devices to prevent needlestick injury is also discussed."
CD008201,0,12214150,0,Home treatment of deep vein thrombosis. An out-patient treatment model with once-daily injection of low-molecular-weight heparin (tinzaparin) in 555 patients.,"During a 22-month period, 555 consecutive patients at seven hospitals in the western part of Sweden with an acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT) not involving the iliac vein and not having pulmonary embolism were included in a study testing the efficacy of implementing out-patient treatment. For all patients with a confirmed diagnosis of acute DVT, a folder was used that contained two checklists with detailed instructions for further treatment, one for the doctor and one for the nurse, an information pamphlet for the patient and prepared prescriptions for low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) tinzaparin (Innohep) of 175 anti-Xa IU/kg body weight subcutaneously once daily and warfarin. Patients not requiring hospitalisation, according to strict guidelines, were then eligible for treatment as out-patients. Prior to release from the emergency department for home treatment, a nurse provided detailed information to the patient and administered the first tinzaparin injection. In 194 (35.0%) out of 555 patients, the DVT was localised only in the lower leg not reaching the popliteal vein. Factors predisposing to venous thromboembolism were identified in 35.0% of the patients. 332 (59.8%) out of the 555 patients studied did not require hospitalisation and were therefore treated as out-patients. 140 of these patients (42.2%) injected themselves, the injection was given by a relative in 63 (19.0%) patients and by the community nurse in 129 (38.9%). Six (1.8%) patients reported a worsening of the DVT condition during the LMWH treatment period. No major bleedings were observed during the injection treatment period. Except for local minor skin bleedings at the injection site, only 3 (0.9%) patients reported minor bleedings during the injection treatment period. Recurrences of venous thromboembolism during the first 2 months were reported in 9 patients (2.7%) out of 332 patients who were sent home from the emergency department. Five (2.2%) patients out of the 223 who were admitted to the hospital had an increased tendency to bleeding. Twelve patients (5.4%) were hospitalised because of a pronounced local status, 26 (11.7%) were senile, social factors were the reason for hospitalisation in 76 (34.1%) and lack of time of the physician in 39 (17.5%) of the patients. A pharmacoeconomic analysis found a cost reduction of 69% with the present model for home treatment compared with traditional in-hospital treatment of DVT patients. We conclude that tinzaparin can be safely used at home by patients with DVT below the inguinal region and that the model used in the present study is cost-effective."
CD008201,0,9111153,0,Therapeutic implications of the epidemiology and timing of myocardial infarction and other cardiovascular diseases.,"Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) account for almost 50% of the 2 million deaths annually in the United States. Coronary heart disease (CHD) (ie, myocardial infarction, sudden death) account for the largest proportion (32%) of this mortality. Over the last 3 decades both CVD and age-adjusted coronary death rates have fallen dramatically. However, crude CVD (and CHD) incidence is actually increasing, almost exclusively as a function of rising CVD incidence amongst older Americans. Population groups at highest for premature CVD complications include African-Americans, diabetics, men, smokers, and those with high levels of single risk factors (ie, stage III hypertension). Individuals with multiple CVD risk factors as well as those with manifestations of blood pressure (BP)-related target-organ damage (TOD) (ie, left ventricular hypertrophy, hypercreatinemia) are at an inordinately high risk for clinical events. CVD events do not randomly occur throughout the 24-h time period. The peak incidence of myocardial infarction (MI), thrombotic stroke, sudden cardiac death, and transient myocardial ischemia is between 6 am and 12 noon. During the morning hours coinciding with the peak incidence of CVD events, coronary vasomotor tone, plasma catecholamines, and platelet aggregability are at their highest levels while coronary blood flow and plasma fibrinolytic activity are at their lowest levels of the day. Moreover, BP rapidly rises from its nocturnal nadir during the early morning hours. Prevention of pressure-related CVD events in hypertensive patients over the long term can be best accomplished by controlling BP throughout the 24 h time period with drugs that do not adversely impact (or favorably affect) other metabolic, neurohormonal, and hemostatic parameters. BP control (minimally to <140/90 mm Hg) may be particularly important in the early morning hours since elevated BP and/or rapidly rising BP is a plausible biological trigger for the aforementioned CVD events. One effective strategy for achieving this goal is to utilize antihypertensive drugs with long therapeutic half-lives. Such agents will provide smooth whole-day BP control and also will minimize the loss of BP control during time period(s) between missed medication doses in the setting of therapeutic non-compliance. Practitioners should give due consideration to nocturnal administration of antihypertensive drugs prescribed once-daily as a means of achieving more effective morning BP control."
CD008201,0,23661332,0,Analysis of free flap complications and utilization of intensive care unit monitoring.,"We aimed to determine the optimal time for intensive care unit (ICU) monitoring after free flap reconstruction based on the timing of surgical complications. We reviewed retrospectively 179 free flaps in 170 subjects during an 8-year period at University Hospital. Thirty-seven flaps were reoperated due to vascular (n = 16, 8.9%) and nonvascular complications (n = 21, 11.7%). Vascular complications presented earlier relative to nonvascular complications (10.8 versus 99.3 hours). The flap survival rate was 93.2% with a mean ICU length of stay of 6.2 days. The lack of standardized monitoring protocols can lead to overutilization of ICU. Sometimes, flap monitoring is not the limiting factor, as patients with other comorbidities necessitate longer ICU stays. However, our study suggests that close monitoring of flaps seems most critical during the first 24 to 48 hours, when most thrombotic complications occur and prompt identification and re-exploration is critical. Some thrombosis and most hematomas present within 72 hours, and thus close monitoring is still warranted. We suggest close monitoring of free flaps in the ICU or dedicated flap monitoring unit where nursing can check the flap on an every-1-to-2-hour basis for the first 72 hours postoperatively to assure optimal surveillance of any potential problems."

CD008201,0,14650859,0,Venous thromboembolism: pathophysiology and clinical presentation.,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is associated with short- and long-term morbidity and mortality. Strategies to identify and stratify patients at risk for VTE and guidelines for its prevention are discussed. VTE, which includes deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), is a common and potentially fatal health problem. An estimated 2 million patients in the United States will develop a DVT annually. Although VTE is asymptomatic in many patients, the risk of mortality remains high--approximately 100,000 deaths annually in the United States--despite the availability of effective treatments. Many patients who initially survive a PE die within 90 days of discharge. VTE is also associated with long-term consequences, such as recurrent VTE and the disabling and costly postthrombotic syndrome (PTS). VTE produces a significant economic burden due not only to the direct medical costs associated with acute inpatient care but also to the long-term, follow-up costs. The routine use of prophylaxis to prevent VTE is justified due to high prevalence, asymptomatic nature, long-term morbidity, high mortality rate, and cost of the disorder. Health-system pharmacists can help to diminish the risk of VTE by identifying and stratifying at-risk patients and ensuring that appropriate prophylaxis is provided. Implementing a methodical and aggressive approach will reduce the incidence as well as the morbidity, mortality, and cost associated with VTE."

Patients with IDDVT are frequently treated for a shorter period of time compared to patients with proximal DVT and/or pulmonary embolism (PE) due to a perceived lower risk of recurrence. About 10-20% of patients with venous thromboembolic events (VTEs) have concomitant cancer. Guidelines recommend long-term anticoagulant treatment in this group of patients due to their high risk of VTE recurrence. Unfortunately, information on the clinical history of IDDVT patients is limited and, to date, no study has evaluated the long-term risk of VTE recurrence in IDDVT patients with cancer."

CD008201,0,25581948,0,Is there a cardiovascular risk in inflammatory bowel diseases?,"Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are characterized by an increased thrombembolic risk, given the powerful relation between inflammation and thrombosis. Multiple studies showed that patients with IBD have an up to 3-fold higher risk for developing venous thrombembolic (VTE) complications compared to general population, this risk being more increased in the hospitalized IBD flares. Thus, latest consensus recommendations indicate prophylaxis for VTE in hospitalized patients with active IBD but with no clear indications for the management of IBD outpatients. Regarding atherothrombotic risk (myocardial infarction or stroke), up-to-date data are inconclusive. IBD is associated with subclinical atherosclerosis in patients without clinical manifestations of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). However, the results of major studies assessing the hypothesis that IBD is strongly associated with atherosclerotic macrovascular events prove to be divergent even if they show positive correlations with CVD especially on different subgroup analysis. These facts should lead in the future to more prospective studies with control groups that have the same cardiovascular risk profile as in IBD populations in order to admit definitively that patients with IBD are exposed to an increased cardiovascular risk."

RIETE is an ongoing, prospective registry of consecutive patients with acute, objectively confirmed, symptomatic VTE. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of anticoagulant therapy during the first three months in all patients aged >/=90 years. In addition, we tried to identify those at a higher risk for VTE. Of 21,873 patients enrolled from March 2001 to February 2008, 610 (2.8%) were aged >/=90 years. Of these, 307 (50%) presented with pulmonary embolism (PE), 240 (39%) had immobility >/=4 days, and 271 (44%) had abnormal creatinine levels. During the first three months of therapy, 140 patients aged >/=90 years (23%) died. Of these, 45 (32%) died of PE (34 of the initial episode, 11 of recurrent PE), 18 (13%) had fatal bleeding. Recent immobility >/=4 days was the most common risk factor for VTE (240 of 610 patients, 39%), but only 54 of them (22%) had received thromboprophylaxis. The most frequent causes for immobility were senile dementia, acute infection, trauma or decompensated heart failure. The duration of immobility was <4 weeks in 126 patients (52%), and most of them were bedridden at home. In conclusion, one in every four VTE patients aged >/=90 years died during the first three months of therapy. Of these, one in every three died of PE, one in every eight had fatal bleeding. Identifying at-risk patients may help to prevent some of these deaths."

A phase IIb, randomized, multicenter, double-blind study of the efficacy and safety of Trinam (EG004) in stenosis prevention at the graft-vein anastomosis site in dialysis patients.","Hemodialysis access complications remain a major cause of morbidity for patients with end-stage renal disease who are undergoing chronic hemodialysis. Vascular access complications occur in approximately 40% of patients with polytetrafluorethylene (PTFE) grafts within the first 6 months, primarily due to stenosis and thrombosis. Thrombosis at the site of vascular access increases the risk of infection and the need for hospitalization, and may lead to loss of potential new sites for vascular access. To a large extent, the failure of hemodialysis access is due to the rapid development of an intimal hyperplastic lesion in the region of anastomosis between the PTFE graft and the vein. The hospital costs related to hemodialysis access procedures are estimated to be around $1.3 billion per year and the total cost of hemodialysis complications to the US healthcare system is thought to be in excess of $2 billion per year. Ark Therapeutics Ltd. are developing a vascular endothelial growth factor D (VEGF-D) gene in an adenoviral vector which is delivered locally to the adventitial surface of a graft-vein anastomosis by means of a collagen collar device. The proposed indication for this product (Trinam) is the prevention of intimal hyperplasia at the graft-vein anastomosis site in patients who require vascular access to facilitate hemodialysis for end-stage renal disease. The rationale for Trinam to prevent intimal hyperplasia at the graft-vein anastomosis follows the discovery that VEGF has a 'vasculoprotective' action, resulting in inhibition of smooth muscle cell migration and proliferation. The fundamental mechanism for this vasculoprotective effect of VEGF, as distinct from its more widely appreciated 'angiogenic' role, is that VEGF acts on surface receptors on endothelial cells resulting in increased production of nitric oxide and prostacyclin. These entities diffuse into the media of the blood vessel wall and counter the tendency for intimal hyperplasia to develop. In an in vivo rabbit model of intimal thickening in carotid arteries, adventitial delivery of VEGF using a silastic collar as a gene delivery reservoir prevented smooth muscle cell proliferation without evidence of new blood vessel formation, indicating that the mechanism by which VEGF inhibited intimal hyperplasia did not involve angiogenesis. The objective of the proposed study is to assess the efficacy and safety of local delivery of Trinam when applied to the graft-vein anastomosis site in patients with end-stage renal disease who require vascular access for hemodialysis. At the time of surgical placement of a PTFE arm graft, patients will be randomized to either a single administration of Trinam or to 'no treatment' (i.e., control group). It is hypothesised that Trinam administration will result in less stenosis at the graft-vein anastomosis site (as measured by fistulography) compared with controls and therefore will reduce the need for interventions in dialysis patients. Approximately 210 patients will be enrolled from 10-15 centers and patients will be evaluated for efficacy and safety over 6 months. The total dose of Trinam will be 1 x 10(11) viral particles (replication-deficient adenoviral vector). This dose of Trinam was not associated with any significant toxicology findings in a preclinical study of pigs in which a PTFE loop-graft was anastomosed from the carotid artery to the internal jugular vein to mimic hemodialysis vascular access surgery."

CD008201,0,23569364,0,Long-term efficacy and safety of exemestane in the treatment of breast cancer.,"Exemestane, a steroidal aromatase inhibitor, is licensed for postmenopausal patients with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer as second-line therapy in metastatic disease following antiestrogen failure and as part of sequential adjuvant therapy following initial tamoxifen. This study is a systematic literature review, evaluating exemestane in different clinical settings. The Ovid Medline (1948-2012), Embase (1980-2012), and Web of Science (1899-2012) databases were searched. Forty-two relevant articles covering randomized controlled trials were reviewed for efficacy and safety, and three for adherence. With regard to efficacy in metastatic disease, exemestane is superior to megestrol acetate after progression on tamoxifen. There is evidence for noninferiority to fulvestrant (following a prior aromatase inhibitor) and to nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors in the first-line setting. Combined use with everolimus is shown to be more efficacious than exemestane alone following previous aromatase inhibitor use. In the adjuvant setting, a switch to exemestane after 2-3 years of tamoxifen is superior to 5 years of tamoxifen. Exemestane is noninferior to 5 years of tamoxifen as upfront therapy, and may have a role as an extended adjuvant therapy. Used as neoadjuvant therapy, increased breast conservation is achievable. As chemoprevention, exemestane significantly reduces the incidence of breast cancer in ""at-risk"" postmenopausal women. Exemestane is associated with myalgias and arthralgias, as well as reduced bone mineral density and increased risk of fracture, which do not appear to persist at follow-up, with subsequent return to pretreatment values. Compared with tamoxifen, there is a reduced incidence of endometrial changes, thromboembolic events, and hot flashes. Limited evidence shows nonadherence in 23%-32% of patients. Evidence is growing in support of exemestane in all clinical settings. It is generally more efficacious and has a better safety profile than tamoxifen. How it compares with the nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors remains to be established. Further studies are required on adherence to ensure that maximum benefit is obtained."

CD008201,0,23121400,0,A review of enhanced recovery for thoracic anaesthesia and surgery.,"During the past decade, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of thoracic surgical procedures carried out in the UK. The current financial climate dictates that more efficient use of resources is necessary to meet escalating demands on healthcare. One potential means to achieve this is through the introduction of enhanced recovery protocols, designed to produce productivity savings by driving reduction in length of stay. These have been promoted by government bodies in a number of surgical specialties, including colorectal, gynaecological and orthopaedic surgery. This review focuses on aspects of peri-operative care that might be incorporated into such a programme for thoracic anaesthesia, for which an enhanced recovery programme has not yet been introduced in the UK, and a review of the literature specific to this area of practice has not been published before. We performed a comprehensive search for published work relating to the peri-operative management and optimisation of patients undergoing thoracic surgery, and divided these into appropriate areas of practice. We have reviewed the specific interventions that may be included in an enhanced recovery programme, including: pre-optimisation; minimising fasting time; thrombo-embolic prophylaxis; choice of anaesthetic and analgesic technique and surgical approach; postoperative rehabilitation; and chest drain management. Using the currently available evidence, the design and implementation of an enhanced recovery programme based on this review in selected patients as a package of care may reduce morbidity and length of hospital stay, thus maximising utilisation of available resources."

Nevertheless, justification of this treatment is controversial. We evaluated the risk for short-term complications associated with a restrictive treatment protocol for neonatal polycythemia. A retrospective cross-sectional analytical study was conducted. Three treatment groups were defined and managed according to their degree of polycythemia, defined by capillary tube filled with venous blood and manually centrifuged hematocrit: group 1, hematocrit 65 to 69% and no special treatment was recommended; group 2, hematocrit 70 to 75% and intravenous fluids were given and feedings were withheld until hematocrit decreased to < 70%; and group 3, hematocrit ≥ 76% or symptomatic neonates and PET was recommended. During the study period, 190 neonates were diagnosed with polycythemia. The overall rate of short-term complications was 15% (28 neonates). Seizures, proven necrotizing enterocolitis, or thrombosis did not occur in any participating neonates. PET was performed in 31 (16%) neonates. The groups did not differ in their rate of early neonatal morbidities or length of hospitalization. Restrictive treatment for neonatal asymptomatic polycythemia is not associated with an increased risk of short-term complications."

CD008201,0,10070237,0,[Prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism in medical patients: from medical decision tools to the use of low molecular weight heparin].,"In France, low molecular weight heparins are largely used for prophylaxis of venous thromboembolic disease in medical patients. Although clinical trials show their efficacy in some particular clinical situations, there is no consensus about their use in non-surgical patients. A consequence is a wide disparity of prophylaxis of venous thromboembolic disease regimens: such a situation was observed during a practice survey in two medical units of the general hospital of Lunéville. So, prior assessment for pharmacists and physicians was carried out to determine tools which guide decision-making. These comprise clinical practice guidelines, a record card which allows the scoring of risk for venous thromboembolic disease and a clinical algorithm leading to the appropriate prescription according to the risk and the haematological results. A second concomitant practice survey was organized in the same two units in order to measure the appropriateness of the decision-making tools in medical practice. The four-month study included 108 medical patients. The process was successful because: (1) validated practices are improved, particularly in respect of biological monitoring during treatment, and (2) the disparity of therapeutic strategies is highly reduced, the clinical practice guidelines being followed in 81 per cent of all cases. Despite the lack of consensus, heightened awareness of the attendant risk in many medical conditions allows appropriate prophylactic measures to be taken. These measures need decision-making tools that are easy to use and that improve heparin prescribing and thus healthcare quality."
CD008201,0,7613894,0,Low molecular weight heparin started before surgery as prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis: 2500 versus 5000 XaI units in 2070 patients.,"The optimal administration regimens of low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs) have not yet been established. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of 2500 and 5000 XaI units of the LMWH dalteparin in patients undergoing elective general surgery for malignant and benign abdominal disease. Prophylaxis was started in the evening before surgery and given once-daily every evening thereafter. The study was designed as a prospective, randomized, double-blind, multicentre trial. Some 66.4 per cent of patients were operated on for a malignant disorder. The primary endpoint was deep vein thrombosis (DVT) detected with the fibrinogen uptake test. Bleeding complications were recorded and classified. Analysis was made both on an intention to treat basis and in patients given correct prophylaxis (86.3 per cent). A total of 2097 patients were randomized and 27 excluded after randomization. A technically correct fibrinogen uptake test was obtained in 1957 patients. The incidence of DVT was significantly lower in patients given 5000 XaI units, this being true for both correct prophylaxis (6.8 versus 13.1 per cent, P < 0.001), on an intention to treat basis (6.6 versus 12.7 per cent, P < 0.001), and in patients with malignant disease (8.5 versus 14.9 per cent, P < 0.001). Sixty-seven patients (3.2 per cent) died within 30 days with no difference between the groups. There were two cases of fatal pulmonary embolism. The frequency of bleeding complications in the whole series was higher in patients randomized to 5000 XaI units (4.7 versus 2.7 per cent, P = 0.02), although this was not the case in those operated on for malignant disease (4.6 versus 3.6 per cent, P not significant). Dalteparin in the dose of 5000 XaI units started in the evening before surgery has a good thromboprophylactic effect in high-risk general surgery at the cost of a small bleeding risk. In patients with malignant disease there was no increased risk of bleeding. The overall frequency of fatal pulmonary embolism with dalteparin is extremely low, even in this high-risk group of patients."

CD008201,0,11181309,0,[Clinical practice guidelines of the Spanish Society of Cardiology for pulmonary thromboembolism and hypertension].,"Primary pulmonary hypertension is a progressive disease. Most affected patients are young and middle-aged women. Etiology is unknown, although a familial and genetic factor is present in up to 6% of cases. Endothelial dysfunction and abnormalities in calcium channels of smooth muscle fibers are the present pathogenetics theories. Diagnostic tests try to exclude secondary causes of pulmonary hypertension and to evaluate its severity. Acute vasodilatory test is vital in the selection of treatment. Oral anticoagulation is indicated in all patients. Lung transplant is performed when medical treatment is unsuccessful. Atrial septostomy is an alternative and palliative treatment for selected cases. Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension is a special form of secondary pulmonary hypertension, clinically undistinguishable from primary primary hypertension, is of mandatory diagnosis because it can be cured with thromboembolectomy. Pulmonary embolism is common in hospitalised patients. The mortality rate for pulmonary embolism continues to be high: up to 30% in untreated patients. The accurate detection of pulmonary embolism remains difficult, as pulmonary embolism can accompany as well as mimic other cardiopulmonary illnesses. Non-invasive diagnostic tests have poor specificity and sensitivity. The D-dimer level and the spiral CT angiography have also been employed as new alternatives and important tools for precise diagnosis of suspected pulmonary embolism. The standard therapy of pulmonary embolism is intravenous heparin for 5 to 10 days in conjunction with oral anticoagulants posteriorly for 3 to 6 months. The incidence of deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism and death due to pulmonary embolism, can be reduced significantly and shown clear benefits only by adoption of a prophylactic strategy with low-molecular-weight-heparins or dextrans in patients at risk."

Predictive ability of risk stratification schemes for primary and secondary prevention.,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) patients are widely heterogeneous in terms of ischaemic stroke risk, and several risk stratification schemes have been developed. We performed a prospective study on 662 AF patients on long-term oral anticoagulant therapy (OAT), evaluating the agreement among the different schemes and their correlation with adverse events recorded during follow-up. Patients at low risk were similarly distributed among the different models. Instead, patients classed at moderate risk were 49.2% by CHADS(2) score, 27.6% by NICE and 2.3% by ACCP. As a consequence patients classed at high risk were 46.1% by CHADS(2), 69.8% by NICE and 95.3% by ACCP. CHADS(2 )and NICE scores were associated to the best predictive accuracy. A separate analysis was performed for patients on treatment for secondary prevention, and we observed that they were included in high risk groups by all models, except for 14 patients (6.3%) classed at moderate risk by CHADS(2) even though these patients are at very high risk and the use of aspirin could be unsafe for them. During follow-up 32 major bleeding (1.35 per 100 patient/years) and 39 thrombotic events (1.64 per 100 patient/years) were observed. Among patients on OAT for secondary prevention, both bleeding and thrombotic events mostly occurred in high-risk patients. Even if the absolute rate of adverse events is low, this finding seems to confirm the high stroke risk of this group of patients. For patients on secondary prevention there is no need for further stratification and warfarin should be the treatment of choice."
CD008201,0,19006607,0,Management of upper gastrointestinal bleeding.,"Upper gastrointestinal bleeding secondary to ulcer disease is common and results in substantial patient morbidity and medical expense. After initial resuscitation to stabilize the patient, carefully performed endoscopy provides an accurate diagnosis and identifies high-risk ulcer patients who are likely to rebleed with medical therapy alone and will benefit most from endoscopic hemostasis. For patients with major stigmata of ulcer hemorrhage--active arterial bleeding, nonbleeding visible vessel, and adherent clot--combination therapy with epinephrine injection and either thermal coagulation (multipolar or heater probe) or endoclips is recommended. High-dose intravenous proton pump inhibitors are recommended as concomitant therapy after successful endoscopic hemostasis. Patients with minor stigmata or clean-based ulcers will not benefit from endoscopic treatment and should receive high-dose oral proton pump inhibitor therapy. Effective medical and endoscopic management of ulcer hemorrhage can significantly improve outcomes and decrease the cost of medical care by reducing rebleeding, transfusion requirements, and the need for surgery."

We have identified the incidence and risk factors for symptomatic pulmonary embolism after arthroscopic procedures on outpatients. The New York State Department of Health Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System database was used to review arthroscopic procedures of the knee performed on outpatients between 1997 and 2006, and identify those admitted within 90 days of surgery with an associated diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. Potential risk factors included age, gender, complexity of surgery, operating time defined as the total time that the patient was actually in the operating room, history of cancer, comorbidities, and the type of anaesthesia. We identified 374,033 patients who underwent 418,323 outpatient arthroscopies of the knee. There were 117 events of pulmonary embolism (2.8 cases for every 10 000 arthroscopies). Logistic regression analysis showed that age and operating time had significant dose-response increases in risk (p < 0.001) for a subsequent admission with a pulmonary embolism. Female gender was associated with a 1.5-fold increase in risk (p = 0.03), and a history of cancer with a threefold increase (p = 0.05). These risk factors can be used when obtaining informed consent before surgery, to elevate the level of clinical suspicion of pulmonary embolism in patients at risk, and to establish a rationale for prospective studies to test the clinical benefit of thromboprophylaxis in high-risk patients."

Warfarin use will likely continue for anticoagulation indications for which novel agents have not been evaluated and among patients who are already stabilised on it or have severe renal impairment. • Strategies to manage over-warfarinisation and warfarin during invasive procedures can reduce the risk of haemorrhage. • For most warfarin indications, the target international normalised ratio (INR) is 2.0-3.0 (venous thromboembolism and single mechanical heart valve excluding mitral). For mechanical mitral valve or combined mitral and aortic valves, the target INR is 2.5-3.5. • Risk factors for bleeding with warfarin use include increasing age, history of bleeding and specific comorbidities. • For patients with elevated INR (4.5-10.0), no bleeding and no high risk of bleeding, withholding warfarin with careful subsequent monitoring seems safe. • Vitamin K1 can be given to reverse the anticoagulant effect of warfarin. When oral vitamin K1 is used for this purpose, the injectable formulation, which can be given orally or intravenously, is preferred. • For immediate reversal, prothrombin complex concentrates (PCC) are preferred over fresh frozen plasma (FFP). Prothrombinex-VF is the only PCC routinely used for warfarin reversal in Australia and New Zealand. It contains factors II, IX, X and low levels of factor VII. FFP is not routinely needed in combination with Prothrombinex-VF. FFP can be used when Prothrombinex-VF is unavailable. Vitamin K1 is essential for sustaining the reversal achieved by PCC or FFP. • Surgery can be conducted with minimal increased risk of bleeding if INR ≤ 1.5. For minor procedures where bleeding risk is low, warfarin may not need to be interrupted. If necessary, warfarin can be withheld for 5 days before surgery, or intravenous vitamin K₁ can be given the night before surgery. Prothrombinex-VF use for warfarin reversal should be restricted to emergency settings. Perioperative management of anticoagulant therapy requires an evaluation of the risk of thrombosis if warfarin is temporarily stopped, relative to the risk of bleeding if it is continued or modified."

CD008201,0,17164492,0,An evaluation of venous thromboembolic risk in acutely ill medical patients immobilized at home: the AT-HOME Study.,"Many risk factors for venous thromboembolism (VTE) in hospitalized medical patients are also present in medical outpatients. VTE prevention represents an important challenge for physicians treating patients at home. The AT-HOME study was a prospective cross-sectional observational study designed to assess awareness of the risk of VTE in immobilized acutely ill medical outpatients among German physicians, many of whom were participating in a national Continuing Medical Education (CME) program designed to raise awareness of VTE. The study involved 1210 medical patients who were acutely confined to bed at home. Physicians performed a subjective assessment of VTE risk, which was rated on a 10-point scale (1 = very low risk; 10 = very high risk). The risk of VTE was also assessed retrospectively by using a scorecard developed for use in hospitalized medical patients. Of the 1210 patients, 198 (16%) had risk scores of 0-4, 319 (26%) had scores of 5 or 6, and 693 (57%) had scores > or =7. Overall, 966 patients (80%) received thromboprophylaxis. The proportion of patients receiving thromboprophylaxis was 0% to 47% in risk score groups 0-4, 76% to 85% in groups 5 and 6, and 90% to 100% in risk score groups 7-10. In the retrospective assessment of VTE risk, 74% of patients were at high risk, 15% were at intermediate risk, and 11% were at low risk. The proportions of patients receiving thromboprophylaxis in these groups were 87%, 61%, and 55%, respectively. The involvement of physicians in educational activities focusing on VTE awareness appeared to create awareness of the risks of VTE in acutely ill medical outpatients."

CD008201,0,19372098,0,Prevention of perioperative atrial fibrillation with betablockers in coronary surgery: betaxolol versus metoprolol.,"In this study, we tried to compare the efficacy and safety of betaxolol vs. metoprolol immediately postoperatively in coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) patients and to determine whether prophylaxy for atrial fibrillation (AF) with betaxolol could reduce hospitalization and economic costs after cardiac surgery. Our trial was open-label, randomized, multicentric enrolling 1352 coronary surgery patients randomized to receive betaxolol or metoprolol. The primary endpoints were the composites of 30-day mortality, in-hospital AF (safety endpoints), duration of hospitalization and immobilization, quality of life, and the above endpoint plus in-hospital embolic event, bradycardia, gastrointestinal symptoms, sleep disturbances, cold extremities (efficacy plus safety endpoint). At the end of the study the incidence and probability of early postoperative AF with betaxolol was lower than with metoprolol in coronary surgery (P<0.0001). In the two study groups minor side effects were similar and no major complication was reported (P<0.001). Patient compliance was good and the general condition improved due to shortened hospitalization and immobilization with subsequent improvement in the psychological status, less arrhythmias and lack of significant side effects. In conclusion, because of its efficacy and safety, betaxolol was superior to metoprolol for the prevention of the early postoperative AF in coronary surgery."
CD008201,0,10083768,0,Surgical treatment of recurrent groin hernia.,"Recurrent groin hernia is not uncommon in Taiwan. Subsequent surgical repairs are difficult, due to cicartrization and deterioration of the inguinal floor. In this report, the intermediate and long-term outcomes of 212 patients with recurrent groin hernias who underwent surgical repair within a 10-year period were analyzed in order to assess the effectiveness of two modified repair techniques. Patients with unilateral first-time recurrent hernia (UR; n = 87) were treated by a modified Shouldice technique using an inguinal approach. Those with bilateral or multiple recurrences (MRs; n = 125) were treated with giant prosthetic reinforcement of the visceral sac (GPRVS, Stoppa operation) using a midline preperitoneal approach. Complete exploration of the groin floor on the side of recurrence revealed a high rate of direct space defects (UR, 41.5%; MR, 65%) and multiple posterior wall defects (UR, 29.9%; MR, 30%). In the UR group, a 4 x 10-cm preperitoneal prosthetic mesh was incorporated to reinforce the repair. For MR patients, I reduced the transverse dimension of the mesh prosthesis by 2 cm compared with the original Stoppa protocol; to reduce crinkling, the average dimensions were 23 x 14 cm. Complications in the UR group included testicular atrophy (3 patients) and femoral vein thrombosis (1). Complications in the MR group were transient scrotal fluid accumulation (9 patients), fatal perioperative acute myocardial infarction (1), and failure of the peritoneum to grow over the mesh (1). The average hospital stay was 3 days in the UR group and 6 days in the MR group. The long-term follow-up (1-9 years) revealed a 5.7% re-recurrence rate with an 86.2% follow-up rate in the UR group, and a 1.9% re-recurrence rate with an 86.6% follow-up rate in the UR group. I conclude that GPRVS is an excellent treatment for URs, but the transverse dimension of the prosthetic mesh should be reduced for Taiwanese subjects. However, for first-time MRs, a modified Shouldice technique with incorporation of a preperitoneal prosthetic mesh is still recommended. The surgical dissection is less extensive and the hospital stay is shorter, while the re-recurrence rate is acceptably low."

We recently established a novel ramp test protocol facilitating continuous bedside echo monitoring to optimize LVAD function and diagnosing device malfunctions. We describe a case of 29-year-old woman undergoing HeartMate II LVAD implantation, in whom serial ramp studies were used to diagnose intra-device thrombus after device implantation. The 1st ramp study at postoperative day (POD) 26 revealed adequate reduction in ventricular size according to the increase in LVAD speed (left ventricular end-diastolic diameter [LVEDD] at minimum and maximum speeds, 68 and 37 mm, respectively). The patient was discharged home and received routine anticoagulation maintenance therapy. However, a 2nd ramp test was performed on POD 56 due to increased lactase dehydrogenase and brain natriuretic peptide levels and showed marked increase in left ventricle (LV) chamber size without adequate response to the LVAD speed changes (LVEDD at minimum and maximum speeds, 88 and 76 mm, respectively). Given the suspicion for partial pump thrombosis, the patient was immediately hospitalized and received intravenous heparin infusion. After the optimization of the intensive anticoagulation therapy, the patient underwent a 3rd ramp study, which showed a remarkable improvement of the adequate response to LVAD speed changes. The patients eventually underwent cardiac transplant successfully, and the partial clot was found inside of the pump. This case demonstrates the usefulness of serial ramp studies in patients who are suspected to have device thrombosis."

Regulatory approval and reimbursement within the National Healthcare System of these new oral anticoagulants for patients with AF at risk of stroke are expected to progressively modify anticoagulant therapy for most patients on warfarin treatment. This evolution in the therapeutic approach to AF is primarily driven by the improved efficacy and safety profile of these novel agents that results in reduced thromboembolic and bleeding risk, in addition to their ease of administration and freedom from laboratory monitoring. When anticoagulation is indicated, it is currently suggested to replace dose-adjusted warfarin with one of the new oral anticoagulants. Although no data from comparative studies among new anticoagulants are available, the assessment of their efficacy and safety profile will help clinicians to tailor therapy to individual patients by choosing the most effective drug at the appropriate dosage.

The malignant phenotype is associated with derangements in the coagulation cascade that can manifest as thrombosis, hemorrhage, or disseminated intravascular coagulation. The risk of vte is increased by a factor of approximately 6 in patients with cancer compared with non-cancer patients, and cancer patients account for approximately 20% of all newly diagnosed cases of vte. Postmortem studies have demonstrated rates of vte in patients with cancer to be as high as 50%. Despite that prevalence, vte prophylaxis is underused in hospitalized patients with cancer. Studies have demonstrated that hospitalized patients with cancer are less likely than their non-cancer counterparts to receive vte prophylaxis. Consensus guidelines address the aforementioned issues and emerging concepts in the area, including the use of risk-assessment models, biomarkers to identify patients at highest risk of vte, and use of anticoagulants as anticancer therapy. Despite those guidelines, a gulf exists between current recommendations and clinical practice; greater efforts are thus required to ensure effective implementation of strategies to reduce the incidence of vte in patients with cancer."

Platelets interacting with injured vascular endothelium in a region along the coronary artery with reduced luminal cross-sectional area contribute to rethrombosis. The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential of the F(ab')2 fragment of the murine monoclonal antibody 7E3 [7E3 F(ab')2] to prevent rethrombosis after intracoronary clot lysis with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) in an experimental model. The 7E3 F(ab')2 binds to the platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa complex (GPIIb/IIIa), thereby preventing platelet-fibrinogen interaction and intravascular thrombus formation. Experimental coronary artery thrombosis was produced in the anesthetized dog by application of direct anodal current to the intimal surface of the left circumflex coronary artery in the region of an external stenosis. Lysis of the established intracoronary thrombus was achieved with the intravenous administration of rt-PA (25 mg) after which the animals were randomized into two groups. Group 1 (n = 10) served as the control, receiving the saline diluent, and group 2 (n = 9) received 7E3 F(ab')2, given as a single intravenous injection (0.8 mg/kg). The times required for occlusive thrombus formation, rt-PA-induced thrombolysis, and rethrombosis (if it occurred) were similar in the animals treated with saline and those treated with 7E3 F(ab')2. The initial left circumflex coronary artery blood flow was similar in both groups but decreased to a negligible level in group 1. In group 2, left circumflex coronary artery blood flow declined modestly (24 +/- 2 to 10 +/- 2 ml/min). Rethrombosis occurred in all animals in group 1 but in only two of nine animals in group 2 (p less than 0.05). Oscillations in coronary blood flow preceded rethrombosis in group 1, whereas 7E3 F(ab')2 stabilized left circumflex coronary artery blood flow patterns during the course of teh experimental protocol (5.2 +/- 0.9 vs. 0.7 +/- 0.4 oscillations, respectively; p less than 0.05). Thrombus mass recovered from the left circumflex coronary artery at the conclusion of each experiment was greater in group 1 as compared with group 2 (7.0 +/- 2.3 vs. 1.5 +/- 0.7 mg, respectively; p less than 0.05). The area of left ventricle at risk for infarction was similar in both groups but infarct size, infarction/at risk assessed histochemically, was larger in group 1 than group 2 (35 +/- 9% vs. 6 +/- 4%, respectively; p less than 0.05).

CD008201,0,21030934,0,Aspirin for the prevention of cardiovascular morbidity.,"Aspirin (ASA) use for secondary prevention in patients with cardiovascular (CV) disease is well established through its beneficial effects on the reduction of myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke and CV mortality. This beneficial effect of ASA seems to consistently outweigh the risk in most patient subsets. Current guidelines endorse ASA for primary prevention of CV events in adults who are at moderate-high risk of CV morbidity. Recent emerging data on the efficacy and safety of ASA conflicts with former randomized clinical trials and raises concerns regarding the validity of these recommendations. The following manuscript describes the data emerging from contemporary trials regarding the efficacy and safety of ASA in various patient subsets. The authors propose certain strategies to enhance safety and efficacy in order to augment the beneficial effects of ASA along with other modalities of primary prevention for suitable candidates. When contemplating ASA prescription for primary prevention of CV events, physicians should carefully weigh the potential benefits of risk reduction versus likelihood of harm, mostly related to bleeding complications."

Prophylaxis significantly reduces VTE morbidity and mortality, and thus represents a real long-term health-care benefit. The aim of this study was twofold: (i) to assess the current level of compliance to VTE risk assessment and prophylaxis best practice guidelines within an Australian rural hospital; and (ii) to determine the effectiveness of nurse education on that compliance. VTE compliance information was obtained from auditing patient notes for a 3-month period prior to nurse education and was repeated after the education. Nurse knowledge of VTE risk assessment and prophylaxis use was also measured. Both compliance with and knowledge of best practice VTE risk assessment and prophylaxis increased following nurse education. Although the sample size was relatively small, this study has shown nurse education to be effective at increasing VTE compliance and awareness within an Australian rural hospital. This relatively inexpensive and simple intervention bears consideration and could lead to reductions in the morbidity and mortality associated with VTE, as well as reduction in associated health-care costs."
CD008201,0,10493230,0,Clinical limitations of risk assessment models.,"Appropriate thromboprophylaxis in hospital patients is effective in preventing clinically important venous thromboembolic events, including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and fatal pulmonary embolism. Due to the risk of bleeding associated with pharmacological prophylaxis and the cost of administering prophylactic drugs, the clinical benefit and cost-effectiveness of thromboprophylaxis may be optimized by providing prophylaxis only to patients at risk of thrombosis, and tailoring the intensity of prophylaxis to the level of risk. Accurate assessment of patients' thromboembolic risk is therefore highly necessary. Thromboembolic risk is influenced by numerous factors. Several risk factor indices based on clinical risk factors and laboratory variables have been proposed since the 1970s, but these have not been widely adopted due to their complexity and lack of prospective validation. The method of deriving risk data on which these indices are based is questioned, and older prognostic indices excluded recently identified risk factors, particularly molecular factors such as the clotting factor V Leiden mutation, further undermining their clinical value. A number of much simpler risk assessment models (RAMs) have now been developed which stratify patients into low-, moderate- and high-risk categories. However, no RAM currently available provides comprehensive guidance for all patient groups. Use of poorly designed RAMs may fail to identify some patients at risk, leading to omission of prophylaxis and preventable thrombotic events. Certain patient groups develop DVT despite prophylaxis. Current RAMs are not validated to identify these patients. Well-designed and well-validated RAMs, incorporated into standard practice guidelines in hospitals, should contribute to improved clinical outcomes and economic benefits of prophylaxis."

CD008201,0,22776987,0,Secondary revascularization after CABG surgery.,"CABG surgery is an effective way to improve symptoms and prognosis in patients with advanced coronary atherosclerotic disease. Despite multiple improvements in surgical technique and patient treatment, graft failure after CABG surgery occurs in a time-dependent fashion, particularly in the second decade after the intervention, in a substantial number of patients because of atherosclerotic progression and saphenous-vein graft (SVG) disease. Until 2010, repeat revascularization by either percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or surgical techniques was performed in these high-risk patients in the absence of specific recommendations in clinical practice guidelines, and within a culture of inadequate communication between cardiac surgeons and interventional cardiologists. Indeed, some of the specific technologies developed to reduce procedural risk, such as embolic protection devices for SVG interventions, are largely underused. Additionally, the implementation of secondary prevention, which reduces the need for reintervention in these patients, is still suboptimal. In this Review, graft failure after CABG surgery is examined as a clinical problem from the perspective of holistic patient management. Issues such as the substrate and epidemiology of graft failure, the choice of revascularization modality, the specific problems inherent in repeat CABG surgery and PCI, and the importance of secondary prevention are discussed."

CD008201,0,16735846,0,Hip fractures--a joint effort.,"More than 350,000 hip fractures occur in the United States every year, and the number will double by 2050 as baby boomers advance in age. Hip fractures remain one of the most common injuries of the geriatric cohort, where 9 of 10 patients with a hip fracture are 65 years of age or older and have multiple medical problems. A coordinated approach to care that emphasizes early ambulation, prevention of complications, and patient/family involvement is essential. This article describes the efforts of a interdisciplinary team to develop and implement a hip fracture protocol that directs the care of patients from admission in the emergency room to a planned discharge. The ideal process of care is driven by quality measures and evidence-based practice consisting of early medical screening, early surgical intervention and ambulation, physical therapy, deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis, and appropriate discharge planning."

Devices are frequently discontinued when patients are out of bed, and they are rarely used in emergency departments. Trauma patients are at high risk for LEDVT; however, IPCs are underused in this population because of compliance limitations.

CD008201,0,3923161,0,Complications and management of implanted venous access catheters.,"A totally implanted subclavian venous access system composed of a reservoir and silastic catheter was employed in 92 patients receiving infusion chemotherapy and/or hyperalimentation. The major catheter complication was subclavian or jugular vein thrombosis observed in 15 patients (16%). Thrombosis was observed in the ipsilateral subclavian or jugular vein surrounding the catheter without restricting function, except in two patients with thrombosis in the vein at the end of the catheter. Prophylaxis with low-dose Coumadin was effective in preventing thrombosis in high-risk patients as defined by a history of prior thrombosis. Streptokinase and/or heparin relieved the signs and symptoms of thrombosis, but clot dissolution or reversal of collateral flow was not observed. Explantation of the catheter was not necessary in all patients in that embolic complications of the thrombosis were not observed, and the system was retained and functioned in five patients in spite of the presence of thrombosis around the catheter. Other complications of the implanted system include ""pocket"" infection, catheter migration, and occlusion. Most complications may be managed without obligate catheter removal."
CD008201,0,11055890,0,Assessment of treatment strategy in high-risk surgical patients.,"The risk of postoperative venous thromboembolism (VTE) is dependent on the type of surgical procedure and specific characteristics of the patient. Patients with intrinsic factors placing them at higher risk of VTE remain at high risk, even if the procedural risk is low. The identification of factors such as age, obesity, and malignant disease, has made it possible to make a preoperative assessment of risk and ensures that the most appropriate thromboprophylactic regimen is prescribed. Despite the widespread use of prophylaxis, the incidence of VTE is still significant. The investigation and development of new pharmacologic agents, such as hirudins and their recombinant derivatives, may lead to better protection for patients at high or very high risk of VTE."

CD008201,0,18073666,0,The management of venous thromboembolism in cancer patients.,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE), encompassing deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism (PE), is a common complication of cancer and an important cause of preventable mortality in people with cancer. Because VTE can be clinically silent, fatal PE generally occurs without warning, and preventive measures are, therefore, necessary in high-risk patients. Clinical guidelines recommend the use of low-molecular-weight heparins in the treatment and prevention of VTE in patients with cancer, in addition to non-pharmacological interventions aimed at reducing thrombotic risk. Nurses have an important role in helping to identify patients at risk of developing VTE, and in the implementation of preventive or therapeutic regimens, and monitoring the development of complications. Furthermore, nurses are in an ideal position to educate patients on the importance of preventive measures and to help ensure compliance with thromboprophylactic interventions."
CD008201,0,21346972,0,Computer surveillance of patients at high risk for and with venous thromboembolism.,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE), including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), may be the number one preventable cause of death associated with hospitalization. Numerous evidence-based guidelines for effective VTE prophylaxis therapy exist. However, underuse is common due to the difficulty in integrating VTE risk assessment into routine patient care. Previous studies utilizing computer decision support to identify high-risk patients report improved use of prophylaxis therapy and reduced VTE. However, those studies did not report the sensitivity, specificity or positive predictive value of their methods to identify patients at high risk. We report an evaluation of a computerized tool to identify patients at high risk for VTE that found a sensitivity of 98% and positive predictive value of 99%. Another computer program used to detect VTE had a sensitivity of 92%, specificity of 99% and a positive predictive value of 97% to identify DVT and a sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 98% and positive predictive value of 89% to identify PE. These tools were found to provide a dependable method to identify patients at high risk for and with VTE."
CD008201,0,17655735,0,The effect of graduated compression stockings on blood velocity in the deep venous system of the lower limb in the postnatal period.,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is the leading cause of maternal mortality in the UK and is also a major cause of long-term morbidity. Recent UK national guidelines recommend thromboprophylaxis, which includes the use of graduated compression stockings (GCS), for high-risk women to reduce the risk of VTE in both the antenatal and postpartum period. This study of 17 women examined the effects of GCS on the deep venous system in the immediate postpartum period and found a statistically significant reduction in the diameter of the common femoral vein (CFV) (pre- versus post stocking diameter: mean 10.39 mm [SD 2.09] versus mean 9.69 mm [SD 1.99]) and an increase in the rate of blood velocity in the CFV (pre- versus post stocking velocity: mean 10.0 cm/s [SD 2.7] versus 13.9 cm/s [SD 4.2]) 30 minutes after application of thigh length GCS in women 1 or 2 days following a singleton vaginal delivery at term. This confirms reduction in venous stasis in the deep venous system in the immediate postpartum woman by the use of GCS, supporting their use in improving venous function in this context."
CD008201,0,2840379,0,Prophylaxis of thromboembolism with various low-molecular-weight heparins.,"In numerous clinical studies, the antithrombotic effect and tolerance of low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs) were compared to those of unfractionated heparin (UFH). Based on our own experience and on a review of the literature the following conclusions can be drawn. In the field of prophylaxis of thromboembolism, including high-risk patients with major bone surgery, the antithrombotic efficacy of a single daily dose of LMWH is at least equivalent to two or three injections of UFH per day. It should, however, be noted that the margin between thromboembolic and bleeding complications has not become bigger, although this had been derived from experimental results. In order to avoid bleeding complications, it is absolutely necessary to take note of the manufacturers' recommendations. This is particularly important when a change of various preparations is considered, because the standardization of LMWH preparations is different and the units are not comparable. The main advantage of LMWH results from an improved practicability. The single daily dose leads to an improved compliance of patients and the nursing staff is spared a great deal of work."
CD008201,0,23662785,0,Venous and arterial disease in inflammatory bowel disease.,"Awareness is increasing that risk of venous thromboembolism and development of atherosclerosis is elevated in patients with some chronic inflammatory diseases. This review aimed to examine the risk of vascular disease in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and to identify potential pathogenic mechanisms and therapeutic approaches. An extensive literature search was conducted using MEDLINE database, Cochrane Library and international conference abstracts for studies pertaining to venous and arterial thromboembolism in adult IBD patients. There is a 1.1-3.6 fold risk of venothromboembolism in IBD, affecting 0.55-6.15% of patients. Risks are increased during a flare or with chronically active inflammation. Evidence is building that there may be a modestly increased risk of arterial disease overall, despite evidence that traditional risk factors may be reduced. Multiple pathogenic factors have been identified including endothelial dysfunction, inflammation-mediated calcium deposition in the media of arteries, hyperhomocysteinemia, platelet activation, and altered coagulation and fibrinolysis. The key to active and preventive therapy is to effectively treat inflammation. Recommendations for prophylaxis of venothromboembolism have followed guidelines where they exist and have been extrapolated from studies of other at-risk conditions, as have those for arterial disease, where screening for risk factors and actively treating abnormalities is encouraged. In conclusion, patients with IBD are at considerably increased risk of venothromboembolism and probably of arterial disease, in particular mesenteric ischemia and ischemic heart disease. Increased penetration of gaps between this knowledge and clinical therapeutic action to prevent thromboembolic events into IBD clinical practice is needed."
CD008201,0,9844515,0,[Deep venous thrombosis in pregnant women].,"The main risk factors for deep vein thrombosis in pregnancy and after delivery are preeclampsia, operative delivery, adiposity, prolonged bed rest, and haemostatic defects (antithrombin, protein C and protein S deficiencies), activated protein C resistance, lupus anticoagulant/antiphospholipid antibodies. Hyperhomocystinaemia is a general risk factor for deep vein thrombosis. The clinical diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis is difficult and must be confirmed by imaging techniques. Positive D-dimer has high sensitivity, but low specificity to detect acute thrombosis. Standard treatment is unfractionated heparin intravenously for 7-10 days, followed by subcutaneous injections. Anticoagulant treatment is prolonged for 6-12 weeks after delivery, usually with warfarin. During pregnancies associated with high risk of thrombosis, low molecular heparin prophylaxis is given during pregnancy and 6-12 weeks after delivery. Thrombosis in pregnancy must be followed by adequate investigation for an underlying thrombotic predisposition."
CD008201,0,19377498,0,Prevention of venous thromboembolism in medical patients and outpatients.,"The majority of fatal cases of pulmonary embolism in hospitalized patients occur in acutely ill, medically treated patients. Current guidelines, based on a large number of prospective, randomized, controlled trials evaluating the safety and efficacy of pharmacologic venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis in medical patients, now recommend using VTE prophylaxis in this population. Unfortunately, prophylaxis rates in medical patients are unacceptably low, despite efforts to develop strategies for improving implementation of prophylaxis regimens. Studies indicate that a substantial proportion of patients with VTE present after hospital discharge, but no clinical trials evaluating VTE prophylaxis for medical outpatients have yet been published. In this Review, we examine the literature on VTE prophylaxis in hospitalized medical patients, and evaluate the available data for the outpatient setting."
CD008201,0,14504867,0,Post-operative complications after caesarean section in HIV-infected women.,"This retrospective study evaluated complications associated with caesarean section in HIV-infected women. For each HIV-positive patient ( n=45) a control group of ten seronegative women ( n=450) was matched for age, number of foetuses, gestational age, indication for caesarean section, status of the membranes and kind of anaesthesia. All women delivered in the same hospital using a uniform protocol. We evaluated the duration of stay in hospital after operation, the need for antibiotics after caesarean section, the incidence of minor postoperative complications (mild anaemia, mild temperature or fever 24 h after surgery, wound haematoma or infection, urinary tract infection, endometritis) and major postoperative complications (severe anaemia, pneumonia, pleural effusion, peritonitis, sepsis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, thromboembolism). Most HIV-positive women (64.5%) had a complicated recovery after surgery. A higher incidence of major and minor postoperative complications were observed in the HIV-positive group than in the control group. There was a statistically significant greater incidence of mild anaemia, mild temperature or fever, urinary tract infection and pneumonia in the HIV-positive group. HIV-positive women with less than 500x10(6) CD4(+) lymphocytest/l had higher post-caesarean section morbidity than HIV-positive women with more than 500x10(6) CD4(+) lymphocytest/l. The median duration of hospital stay was significantly higher in the HIV-positive group (median 7 days) than in the HIV-negative group (median 4 days). The rate of HIV vertical transmission was 8.8%. Higher post-caesarean section morbidity was found in HIV-positive women than in controls. Unfortunately, the HIV-positive women (with low CD4 lymphocytes counts), whose infants theoretically will benefit most from caesarean delivery, are also the women who are most likely to experience post-operative complications."

CD008201,0,22437976,0,Role of new anticoagulants for the prevention of venous thromboembolism after major orthopaedic surgery and in hospitalised acutely ill medical patients.,"Anticoagulation therapy for the prevention of venous thromboembolic events is indicated in patients after major orthopaedic surgery and in hospitalised acutely ill medical patients, who have a high or moderate risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), respectively. Clinical trials have clearly demonstrated that short-term anticoagulation reduces the risk of VTE in these patient groups and that longer-term anticoagulation is beneficial for some indications. Evidence-based guidelines for thromboprophylaxis have been developed based on these studies. However, despite these guidelines, thromboprophylaxis is still underused, or used suboptimally, in many patients. This is, in part, because of the limitations of traditional anticoagulants such as unfractionated heparin, low- molecular-weight heparin, synthetic pentasaccharides, and vitamin K antagonists. Newer oral anticoagulants, such as rivaroxaban, apixaban, and dabigatran etexilate, have certain advantages over traditional agents. They can be administered orally at a fixed dose without routine coagulation monitoring and have minimal food and drug interactions. These characteristics may result in better adherence to guidelines and improved patient outcomes. This review provides an overview of phase III clinical trial data for these newer anticoagulants in major orthopaedic surgery and in hospitalised acutely ill medical patients, and discusses their potential for extended use in the post-hospital discharge setting. All three newer oral anticoagulants are approved in many countries for the prevention of VTE after hip replacement or knee replacement surgery in adult patients, and it is likely that these drugs will contribute considerably towards reducing the substantial healthcare burden associated with VTE."

CD008201,0,19565250,0,Rivaroxaban and dabigatran etexilate: two new oral anticoagulants for extended postoperative prevention of venous thromboembolism after elective total hip arthroplasty.,"Extended thromboprophylaxis is vital in patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty (THA) because of the prolonged risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Despite evidence that extended prophylaxis can reduce the incidence of symptomatic VTE in this high-risk patient population and the evidence-based guideline recommendations, a large proportion of patients still do not receive an adequate duration of thromboprophylaxis. This is partly due to the limitations of conventional anticoagulants, such as the subcutaneous route of administration or the requirement for routine coagulation monitoring and dose adjustment. New oral anticoagulants (such as the direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran etexilate and the Factor Xa inhibitor rivaroxaban) could address the current unmet need. Phase III clinical studies in VTE prevention in patients undergoing THA and total knee arthroplasty (TKA) showed that dabigatran etexilate was non-inferior to the EU regimen of enoxaparin, but did not achieve non-inferiority to the US regimen of enoxaparin. In contrast, rivaroxaban demonstrated superiority to both enoxaparin regimens for the prevention of VTE after THA and TKA, without a significant increase in major bleeding rates. Their convenient, once-daily, fixed dosing, with no need for routine coagulation monitoring, could facilitate adherence to evidence-based guideline recommendations of extended thromboprophylaxis after THA."

CD008201,0,21068523,0,Choosing the right heparin prophylaxis strategy in medical patients at risk for developing VTE: an evidence-based approach.,"Many acutely ill medical patients are at significant risk for developing venous thromboembolism (VTE) during hospitalization. Venous thromboembolism risk arises from both the presenting clinical condition as well as predisposing risk factors, such as advanced age. Thromboprophylaxis is underprescribed in these patients. Thrombotic risk assessment could encourage the prescribing of thromboprophylaxis and, therefore, improve patient protection against VTE. Current guidelines from the American College of Chest Physicians and the International Union of Angiology (IUA) recommend thromboprophylaxis with low-dose unfractionated heparin (UFH), a low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), or fondaparinux for acutely ill medical patients with VTE risk factors. However, the optimal dose regimen for UFH is unclear. The 2006 evidence-based guidelines from the IUA recommend a 3-times-daily dose regimen for UFH. However, UFH is usually administered twice daily despite a lack of evidence for the superiority of this regimen. Both heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and bleeding are associated with UFH, and to a lesser degree with alternative anticoagulants, such as the LMWHs. If utilized, an appropriate prophylaxis regimen in medical patients can reduce the risk of VTE and its burden."

CD008201,0,16836036,0,Management of hip fracture: the family physician's role.,"The incidence of hip fracture is expected to increase as the population ages. One in five persons dies in the first year after sustaining a hip fracture, and those who survive past one year may have significant functional limitation. Although surgery is the main treatment for hip fracture, family physicians play a key role as patients' medical consultants. Surgical repair is recommended for stable patients within 24 to 48 hours of hospitalization. Antibiotic prophylaxis is indicated to prevent infection after surgery. Thromboprophylaxis has become the standard of care for management of hip fracture. Effective agents include unfractionated heparin, low-molecular-weight heparin, fondaparinux, and warfarin. Optimal pain control, usually with narcotic analgesics, is essential to ensure patient comfort and to facilitate rehabilitation. Rehabilitation after hip fracture surgery ideally should start on the first postoperative day with progression to ambulation as tolerated. Indwelling urinary catheters should be removed within 24 hours of surgery. Prevention, early recognition, and treatment of contributing factors for delirium also are crucial. Interventions to help prevent future falls, exercise and balance training in ambulatory patients, and the treatment of osteoporosis are important strategies for the secondary prevention of hip fracture."
CD008201,0,26758918,0,Pathophysiology and treatment of pulmonary hypertension in sickle cell disease.,"Pulmonary hypertension affects ∼10% of adult patients with sickle cell disease (SCD), particularly those with the homozygous genotype. An increase in pulmonary artery systolic pressure, estimated noninvasively by echocardiography, helps identify SCD patients at risk for pulmonary hypertension, but definitive diagnosis requires right-heart catheterization. About half of SCD-related pulmonary hypertension patients have precapillary pulmonary hypertension with potential etiologies of (1) a nitric oxide deficiency state and vasculopathy consequent to intravascular hemolysis, (2) chronic pulmonary thromboembolism, or (3) upregulated hypoxic responses secondary to anemia, low O2 saturation, and microvascular obstruction. The remainder have postcapillary pulmonary hypertension secondary to left ventricular dysfunction. Although the pulmonary artery pressure in SCD patients with pulmonary hypertension is only moderately elevated, they have a markedly higher risk of death than patients without pulmonary hypertension. Guidelines for diagnosis and management of SCD-related pulmonary hypertension were published recently by the American Thoracic Society. Management of adults with sickle-related pulmonary hypertension is based on anticoagulation for those with thromboembolism; oxygen therapy for those with low oxygen saturation; treatment of left ventricular failure in those with postcapillary pulmonary hypertension; and hydroxyurea or transfusions to raise the hemoglobin concentration, reduce hemolysis, and prevent vaso-occlusive events that cause additional increases in pulmonary pressure. Randomized trials have not identified drugs to lower pulmonary pressure in SCD patients with precapillary pulmonary hypertension. Patients with hemodynamics of pulmonary arterial hypertension should be referred to specialized centers and considered for treatments known to be effective in other forms of pulmonary arterial hypertension. There have been reports that some of these treatments improve SCD-related pulmonary hypertension."

We used pretransplantation and posttransplantation double-volume total plasma exchange (TPE), splenectomy, and quadruple immunosuppression (cyclophosphamide or mycophenolate mofetil, prednisone, cyclosporine or tacrolimus, and OKT3 induction) in 14 patients receiving ABO-incompatible LTX between June 1992 and February 2001: A(1) to O (seven), B to O (two), B to A (two), A to B (one), AB to A (one), and AB to O (one). Actuarial 1- and 5-year patient and graft survival rates are 71.4% and 61.2 % and 71.4% and 61.2%, respectively, with a mean follow-up of 62.9 +/- 39.4 months. Ten acute cellular rejections occurred, and the mean time to the first episode was 62 +/- 33 days. All were steroid sensitive. No antibody-mediated rejection or vascular thromboses occurred. Pretransplantation pre-TPE immunoglobulin (Ig) G mean isohemagglutinin titers were 262 +/- 326, compared with pretransplantation post-TPE titers of 65 +/- 103 (P =.04). Eight of nine patients with measurable titers before and after TPE achieved a reduction in titers. The mean number of posttransplantation TPE was 5.5 +/- 4.1 (range, 0 to 12), and the last TPE was on postoperative day 9.4 +/- 5.3. IgG isohemagglutinin titers 2 weeks posttransplantation had increased to 153 +/- 309 (P =.03 compared with pretransplantation pre-TPE IgG). ABO-incompatible liver transplantations can be performed with acceptable patient and graft survival rates with a low risk of antibody-mediated rejection with a combination of TPE, splenectomy, and quadruple immunosuppression. Recovery of isohemagglutinin antibody levels without humoral rejection suggests that accommodation may be the protective mechanism preventing late antibody-mediated rejection."
CD008201,0,24360911,0,Management of venous thromboembolism in cancer patients and the role of the new oral anticoagulants.,"Patients with cancer are at high risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE). Most clinical guidelines agree that low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs) are the preferred anticoagulants for the prevention and treatment of VTE in cancer patients. However, LMWHs require daily injections, weight-adjustment of dose, and can be associated with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia; all of which are important considerations in managing cancer-associated VTE. Comparatively, the new oral anticoagulants offer a more attractive option because of their oral administration, fixed-dose, and lack of routine laboratory monitoring. The results of phase III trials support the efficacy and safety of the new oral anticoagulants in the management of VTE. However, generalizing these findings to cancer patients with VTE is difficult since very few cancer patients were included. In this comprehensive review, we provide an overview of the current treatment of VTE, explore anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis in ambulatory cancer patients, and summarize existing evidence on the efficacy and safety of the new oral anticoagulants for the management of VTE in both non-cancer and cancer populations."

CD008201,0,24476557,0,The economic burden to medicare of stroke events in atrial fibrillation populations with and without thromboprophylaxis.,"Some 3 million people in the United States have atrial fibrillation (AF). Without thromboprophylaxis, AF increases overall stroke risk 5-fold. Prevention is paramount as AF-related strokes tend to be severe. Thromboprophylaxis reduces the annual incidence of stroke in AF patients by 22%-62%. However, antithrombotics are prescribed for only about half of appropriate AF patients. The study team estimates the economic implications for Medicare of fewer stroke events resulting from increased thromboprophylaxis among moderate- to high-risk AF patients. The decision model used considers both reduced stroke and increased bleeding risk from thromboprophylaxis for a hypothetical cohort on no thromboprophylaxis (45%), antiplatelets (10%), and anticoagulation (45%). AF prevalence, stroke risk, and stroke risk reduction are adjusted for age, comorbidities, and anticoagulation/antiplatelet status. Health care costs are literature based. At baseline, an estimated 24,677 ischemic strokes, 9127 hemorrhagic strokes, and 9550 bleeding events generate approximately $2.63 billion in annual event-related health care costs to Medicare for every million AF patients eligible for thromboprophylaxis. A 10% increase in anticoagulant use in the untreated population would reduce stroke events by 9%, reduce stroke fatalities by 9%, increase bleed events by 5%, and reduce annual stroke/bleed-related costs to Medicare by about $187 million (7.1%) for every million eligible AF patients. A modest 10% increase in the use of thromboprophylaxis would reduce event-related costs to Medicare by 7.1%, suggesting a compelling economic motivation to improve rates of appropriate thromboprophylaxis. New oral anticoagulants offering better balance between the risks of stroke and major bleeding events may improve these clinical and economic outcomes."

CD008201,0,23111863,0,Thromboprophylaxis guidelines in cancer with a primary focus on ambulatory patients receiving chemotherapy: a review from the Southern Network on Adverse Reactions (SONAR).,"Patients with cancer are at increased risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE). Factors related to cancer type, site, stage, duration, and extent of disease contribute to the oncology patient's risk of VTE. Patient-specific factors such as history of prior VTE and comorbidity are also contributory. The role of treatment-related factors, including chemotherapy regimen, has been a focus of recent investigation because most cases of VTE in the oncology setting occur in ambulatory patients. Thus, an emerging area of clinical research is primary VTE prophylaxis in the ambulatory cancer setting. Clinical guidelines currently recommend primary thromboprophylaxis in cancer patients who are undergoing surgery, who are hospitalized, and who are in a specific subset of high-risk ambulatory cancer patients. Validated risk stratification tools are essential for identification of patients who are at high risk of thrombosis. Emerging data from recently published clinical trials, as well as ongoing studies, are likely to advance our understanding of the potential utility of antithrombotic agents for primary prophylaxis in ambulatory patients with cancer and may influence future clinical guideline recommendations."

We investigated this in a cohort of 207 consecutive patients undergoing 258 elective frame applications by case note review. Case notes were obtained for 84 % of the sample population. The type of surgery, demographic data, thromboembolic risk factors and the incidence of DVT/PE were recorded. One patient experienced DVT (0.39 %) and one a PE (0.39 %). Both were of high risk and had received mechanical and chemical thromboprophylaxis during their inpatient stay. These complications were identified at least 3 months post-operatively. These findings help to more accurately counsel patients undergoing elective frame surgery on the risks of DVT/PE and also contribute to the discussion between surgeons about whether or not extended course chemical thromboprophylaxis would be of overall benefit."

CD008201,0,18327396,0,Individualized antithrombotic therapy in high risk patients after coronary stenting. A double-edged sword between thrombosis and bleeding.,"Dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel is currently the standard therapy after coronary stent implantation to prevent a life-threatening stent thrombosis. However, a variety of procedural and individual factors contribute to the individual patient risk and have to be taken into account to allow for an individual recommendation for both the duration and intensity of the antiplatelet therapy. Obviously, the benefit of the prevention of stent thrombosis by antithrombotic therapy has to outweigh the risk of severe bleeding complications. Depending on the individual clinical situation and procedural characteristics (stent type, length, angiographic result etc.), the recommended duration of the combined antiplatelet therapy currently varies from four weeks to at least one year. These recommendations are mainly based on large, prospective, randomized trials and evidence-based guidelines. However, in a subgroup of high-risk patients there is insufficient evidence for the benefit of conventional dual antiplatelet regimen. These include i) patients with an indication for anticoagulation, ii) patients with urgent need for an operation requiring a perioperative withholding of antiplatelet therapy, as well as iii) clopidogrel low responders. This review aims to provide a stratification to define patient collectives who may benefit from more individualized antithrombotic regimens on behalf of currently available literature and guidelines."

CD008201,0,21800010,0,Sustained impact of electronic alerts on rate of prophylaxis against venous thromboembolism.,"Advanced electronic alerts (eAlerts) and computerised physician order entry (CPOE) increase adequate thromboprophylaxis orders among hospitalised medical patients. It remains unclear whether eAlerts maintain their efficacy over time, after withdrawal of continuing medical education (CME) on eAlerts and on thromboprophylaxis indications from the study staff. We analysed 5,317 hospital cases from the University Hospital Zurich during 2006-2009: 1,854 cases from a medical ward with eAlerts (interventiongroup) and 3,463 cases from a surgical ward without eAlerts (controlgroup). In the intervention group, an eAlert with hospital-specific venous thromboembolism (VTE) prevention guidelines was issued in the electronic patient chart 6 hours after admission if no pharmacological or mechanical thromboprophylaxis had been ordered. Data were analysed for three phases: pre-implementation (phase 1), eAlert implementation with CME (phase 2), and post-implementation without CME (phase3). The rates of thromboprophylaxis in the intervention group were 43.4% in phase 1 and 66.7% in phase 2 (p<0.001), and increased further to 73.6% in phase3 (p=0.011). Early thromboprophylaxis orders within 12 hours after admission were more often placed in phase 2 and 3 as compared to phase 1 (67.1% vs. 52.1%, p<0.001). In the surgical control group, the thromboprophylaxis rates in the three phases were 88.6%, 90.7%, 90.6% (p=0.16). Advanced eAlerts may provide sustained efficacy over time, with stable rates of thromboprophylaxis orders among hospitalised medical patients."
CD008201,0,11251357,0,Cost-effectiveness of prolonged out-of-hospital prophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin following total hip replacement.,"Several studies have demonstrated that prolongation of thromboprophylaxis after elective hip replacement significantly reduces the frequency of venographically demonstrated deep vein thrombosis. This paper reports an economic evaluation of prolonged prophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), based on outcome data from one of these trials. Analysis showed a net saving per patient of 3,400 Swedish kronor. Consequently, if the costs of administering the LMWH -- which includes the cost of teaching the patient to self-administer whilst in hospital and the cost of a follow-up visit by a district nurse to ensure compliance -- are below this amount, the intervention will prove to be cost saving."
CD008201,0,8675161,0,Liver abscess formation after local treatment of liver tumors.,"Our goal was to determine a subset of patients at high risk of developing liver abscesses after local treatment of liver tumors (LTLT) and establish guidelines for the conduct of LTLT in the safest conditions in such patients. Five hundred sixty-one LTLT, 489 transhepatic arterial chemoembolizations (TAC, 10 hepatic embolizations, and 62 percutaneous intratumor injections (PIT), were retrospectively reviewed for liver parenchyma necrosis and abscess formation. Four patients developed abscesses, three after TAC and one after PIT. Despite broad-spectrum antibiotherapy, percutaneous drainage, and surgery, two patients died. A left hepatectomy was required in the other two patients for cure. All four patients had a carcinoid or a neuroendocrine pancreatic tumor. Three out of four patients had bilioenteric anastomoses, and the fourth had recently undergone cholecystectomy and papillotomy. A Lipiodol/doxorubicin mixture without any particulate embolization was injected in the three patients who developed abscesses after TAC. LTLT in patients with bilio enteric anastomosis or papillotomy and/or neuroendocrine or carcinoid tumor should be performed with strict precautions during the procedure and for peri-procedural care."

CD008201,0,20386544,0,Primary prevention of venous thromboembolism in medical and surgical oncology patients.,"Recent data suggest that patients with a malignancy have a seven-fold increased risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE) compared with those without cancer, suggesting that these patients may benefit from thromboprophylaxis. Mechanisms for the prevention of thromboembolism can be divided into two broad categories: mechanical and pharmacological. Although generally used in combination with pharmacotherapy, little evidence exists for the efficacy of mechanical modalities either in the broader population of patients at risk for VTE or for patients with cancer specifically. A recent study using graduated compression stockings (GCS) for thromboprophylaxis showed no support for the use of stockings in acute stroke patients. Established pharmacological modalities, including warfarin, unfractionated heparin (UFH), low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), and the factor Xa inhibitor fondaparinux, have been shown to reduce risk for VTE in general medical and surgical populations. In medical cancer patients, only limited data are available for the efficacy of thromboprophylaxis. In contrast, considerable evidence indicates that thromboprophylaxis is warranted in patients undergoing cancer surgery. The most recent evidence suggests that catheter-related thrombosis is not prevented by current pharmacological modalities. On 22 May 2009, a group of clinicians based in the United Kingdom (UK) met in London, UK, to evaluate recent data on cancer thrombosis. This article (the second of four) briefly reviews key data on the prevention of VTE in medical and surgical oncology patients, providing context for a brief transcript of the surrounding discussion and a consensus statement, developed by meeting attendees, on the implications of this information for UK clinical practice."
CD008201,0,21559225,0,Left Atrial Appendage Closure in Atrial Fibrillation: A World without Anticoagulation?,"Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is a common arrhythmia with an incidence that is as high as 10% in the elderly population. Given the large proportion of strokes caused by AF as well as the associated morbidity and mortality, reducing stroke burden is the most important part of AF management. While warfarin significantly reduces the risk of AF-related stroke, perceived bleeding risks and compliance limit its widespread use in the high-risk AF population. The left atrial appendage is believed to be the ""culprit"" for thrombogenesis in nonvalvular AF and is a new therapeutic target for stroke prevention. The purpose of this review is to explore the evolving field of percutaneous LAA occlusion. After briefly highlighting the risk of stroke with AF, problems with warfarin, and the role of the LAA in clot formation, this article discusses the feasibility and efficacy of various devices which have been developed for percutaneous LAA occlusion."
CD008201,0,8519139,0,The treatment of fractures of the femoral neck.,"Fifty-four femoral neck fractures in young adults (20-50 years old; Group I) were compared with 397 fractures in the elderly population (older than 60 years of age; Group III). Patients in Group I were more frequently men and had often sustained vertical shear fractures in high-energy injuries. Treatment consisted mostly of open reduction and internal fixation (88%). There were no infections, pulmonary embolisms, or deaths. The rate of avascular necrosis was 10%; the rate of delayed union or nonunion, 17%; and the revision rate, 20%. Reoperation did not preclude an excellent final outcome. Patients in Group III were mostly women who fell at home and sustained an adduction fracture, which was most frequently (80%) treated with a cemented monopolar arthroplasty. Complications included pulmonary embolisms (3.5%), other cardiovascular complications (8%), and respiratory complications (7%). The death rate during hospitalization was 6.5%; for the first year after surgery it was 21%. These complications were not more frequent with either hemiarthroplasty or internal fixation. Local complications required revision of 17% of the cases treated with internal fixation and 1.4% of the patients treated with hemiarthroplasty. In the entire series, the deep infection rate without prophylactic antibiotics was 1.5%; with prophylactic systemic antibiotics it was 0.7%. The incidence of pulmonary embolism without thromboprophylaxis was 3.2%; with fixed-dose, subcutaneous heparin it was 1.1%. Of those treatments tested, open reduction and internal fixation with cancellous bone screws (for the younger patients) and hemiarthroplasty (for the elderly patients) yield the best short-to-midterm results. In addition, thromboprophylaxis with fixed-dose subcutaneous heparin and systemic antibiotic prophylaxis will continue to be used."

CD008201,0,26607486,0,European Union-28: An annualised cost-of-illness model for venous thromboembolism.,"Annual costs for venous thromboembolism (VTE) have been defined within the United States (US) demonstrating a large opportunity for cost savings. Costs for the European Union-28 (EU-28) have never been defined. A literature search was conducted to evaluate EU-28 cost sources. Median costs were defined for each cost input and costs were inflated to 2014 Euros (€) in the study country and adjusted for Purchasing Power Parity between EU countries. Adjusted costs were used to populate previously published cost-models based on adult incidence-based events. In the base model, annual expenditures for total, hospital-associated, preventable, and indirect costs were €1.5-2.2 billion, €1.0-1.5 billion, €0.5-1.1 billion and €0.2-0.3 billion, respectively (indirect costs: 12 % of expenditures). In the long-term attack rate model, total, hospital-associated, preventable, and indirect costs were €1.8-3.3 billion, €1.2-2.4 billion, €0.6-1.8 billion and €0.2-0.7 billion (indirect costs: 13 % of expenditures). In the multiway sensitivity analysis, annual expenditures for total, hospital-associated, preventable, and indirect costs were €3.0-8.5 billion, €2.2-6.2 billion, €1.1-4.6 billion and €0.5-1.4 billion (indirect costs: 22 % of expenditures). When the value of a premature life-lost increased slightly, aggregate costs rose considerably since these costs are higher than the direct medical costs. When evaluating the models aggregately for costs, the results suggests total, hospital-associated, preventable, and indirect costs ranging from €1.5-13.2 billion, €1.0-9.7 billion, €0.5-7.3 billion and €0.2-6.1 billion, respectively. Our study demonstrates that VTE costs have a large financial impact upon the EU-28's healthcare systems and that significant savings could be realised if better preventive measures are applied."
CD008201,0,21455860,0,Prevention of venous thromboembolism in medical patients with thrombocytopenia or with platelet dysfunction: a review of the literature.,"Current guidelines for venous thromboembolism (VTE) primary prophylaxis are based on randomized clinical trials that exclude subjects at a potentially high bleeding risk. Thus no specific recommendation/algorithm for pharmacological prophylaxis in patients with thrombocytopenia and/or platelet dysfunction is available. Because at least 25% of subjects admitted to medical departments exhibit these conditions, information on this subject is provided here to optimize their VTE prophylaxis. Low platelet number/function and clotting abnormalities are common in patients with liver cirrhosis. However, these patients have a high incidence of portal and idiopathic venous thromboses, implying that cirrhotic coagulopathy does not protect against thrombosis. At variance with severe thrombocytopenia (< 50,000/μL), mild/moderate thrombocytopenia (> 50,000/μL) should not interfere with VTE prevention decisions. In severe thrombocytopenia, prophylaxis should be considered on an individual basis, however. In patients with antiphospholipid antibodies and thrombocytopenia, a thrombotic tendency is usually associated rather than a bleeding risk. VTE prophylaxis in high-risk conditions is thus suggested in these patients. Except in cases with contraindications to anticoagulation, antithrombotic prophylaxis should be always considered in hospitalized cancer patients with thrombocytopenia, especially in those with hematologic malignancies and multiple VTE risk factors. Aspirin treatment is not as effective as heparins in lowering the risk of VTE. Studies in stroke suggest that thromboprophylaxis with heparins is safe in patients with ischemic stroke undergoing aspirin treatment. The need for VTE prophylaxis in patients on chronic treatment with aspirin and/or clopidogrel should be evaluated after assessing the individual risk-benefit ratio."

CD008201,0,11150579,0,"The pre-, peri-, and postsurgical activation of coagulation and the thromboembolic risk for different risk groups.","Patients after surgery stand at high risk of developing thromboembolic complications. Nevertheless, there is at present no universal and valid guideline on the duration of heparin prophylaxis. This study aims to assess the thromboembolic risk after the different surgical treatments for different risk groups, based on the activation of the plasmatic coagulation and fibrinolysis system. This is measured by estimating the levels of the fibrin monomers (FM) and fibrin-D-dimers (FD) in plasma during the pre-, peri-, and postsurgical periods in patients from the different clinical risk categories (i. e., posttraumatic or elective hip replacement and osteosynthesis and abdominal surgery: conventional or minimal invasive in malignant and non malignant diseases). During an observation period of 14 days the FM and FD levels were found to be significantly elevated in patients from all risk groups. Underlying malignant diseases lead to an elevation of the procoagulatory risk, whereas age itself does not. Patients who underwent hip surgery seemed to be especially at risk. Even after 14 days or at the date of discharge the FM and FD levels were elevated to maximum showing sustained precoagulatory conditions and increased thromboembolic risk. For these patients the long-term prophylaxis, lasting possibly longer than the average hospitalization period, seems evident. Clinical trials to prove this hypothesis are nevertheless urgently recommended. A corresponding clinical trial that compares long-term against standard heparinization was therefore initiated and is now in progress."

Clinical trials suggest that the drug dose and timing of initiating prophylaxis significantly influence antithrombotic effectiveness and safety. We studied the time course and gradient of plasma coagulation and fibrinolysis during total hip arthroplasty (THA) in twenty patients that were randomly assigned to have the first dose of 5000 IU dalteparin subcutaneously (sc) injected 12 hours before or 6 hours after surgery. Baseline characteristics were similar in both groups. Specific biomarkers on coagulation (prothrombin fragment 1+2 (F1+2)) and fibrinolytic activity (plasmin/ α 2-antiplasmin complex (PAP) and D-dimer) were collected at six events during hospitalization and analysed. There were no significant group differences in the biomarkers at any time point. The highest concentrations were measured 6 hours after surgery and before the first postoperative injection. A marked decrease followed at the first postoperative day, and then a second increase in plasma concentrations was observed 6 days after surgery. This study showed that activation of coagulation and fibrinolysis by the operative trauma was the same when the first dose of dalteparin was injected 12 hours before or 6 hours after surgery."

The risk of VTE varies according to the type of malignancy (i. e. pancreatic cancer, brain cancer, lymphoma) and its disease stage and individual factors (i. e. sex, race, age, previous VTE history, immobilization, obesity). Preventing cancer-associated VTE is important because it represents a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. In order to identify cancer patient at particularly high risk, who need thromboprophylaxis, risk prediction models have become available and are under validation. These models include clinical risk factors, but also begin to incorporate biological markers.

CD008201,0,18807225,0,Antithrombotic therapy in atrial fibrillation: guidelines translated for the clinician.,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia in clinical practice, accounting for approximately one-third of hospitalizations for cardiac rhythm disturbances. The highest incidence of AF is in patients 70-80 years old and other high-risk populations. Although the diagnosis of AF is usually straightforward, effective treatment strategies are less well implemented. This is particularly true for antithrombotic therapy, which is very effective at preventing thromboembolic complications of AF. Stroke is the most significant morbidity in AF patients. The yearly risk of stroke increases from 1.5% for AF patients aged 50-59 to 23% for those aged 80-89. Ischemic strokes secondary to AF carry twice the risk of death when compared with strokes from other causes. We provide a practical and useful review of the most recent American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/European Society of Cardiology guidelines-based care and future directions of antithrombotic therapy for patients with AF."
CD008201,0,15332637,0,[The importance of forseeing and early diagnosis of thromboembolic disease].,"The aim of this study is to assess the incidence of thromboembolism in laparoscopic cholecystectomies. 100 unselected patients undergoing laparoscopic procedures performed by the same team were studied. All patients received preoperative prophylaxis with low/molecular weight heparin (LMWH), which was continued until full mobility. Four cases of deep venous thrombosis of lower limbs were clinically identified and confirmed by means of Doppler ultrasound examination. There were no cases of pulmonary embolus. Deep venous thrombosis occurred during the prophylactic administration of LMWH in the fourth postoperative day, consequently intravenous treatment with Heparin and then with oral anticoagulants was required. In each observation the operation took more than one hour. Among the patient-dependent risk factors, we have identified: age above 40 years, obesity, history of deep venous thrombosis, localized preoperative infection, congestive cardiac failure. Although the thromboprophylaxis has been performed within the laparoscopic surgery similar to that recommended in the classical procedures, when a high risk has developed the illness started.

The objective of this study was to identify risk factors and clinical outcomes in patients diagnosed with UEDVT at an academic medical center over a 1-year period. Medical records of 373 consecutive patients who underwent upper extremity venous duplex ultrasound (VDU) examination were retrospectively reviewed. A quarter of the patients screened by VDU (94 of 373) had acute UEDVT; 63% presented with arm swelling or arm pain; 48% had cancer; and 93% had indwelling CVCs. Cancer patients with CVCs were more likely to develop UEDVT (48%). Of the 94 UEDVTs, 16% had concurrent lower extremity DVT. The incidence of objectively confirmed pulmonary embolism (PE) was 9% (8 of 94 patients), and the 1-month mortality rate was 6.4%. The majority of patients (80%) with UEDVT received anticoagulation therapy and 20% were not treated. The most common risk factors for UEDVT were indwelling CVCs and a diagnosis of cancer. The incidence rate of PE and mortality rate from UEDVT were not insignificant at 9% and 6%, respectively. There were no institutional screening protocols for patients at risk of UEDVT associated with CVCs.

DVT in postoperative and bedridden patients is usually preventable and a thromboprophylaxis protocol based on risk assessment categories is strongly recommended. The Autar DVT risk assessment scale was developed to separate risk into no risk, low, moderate and high risk categories. Founded on Virchow's triad in the genesis of DVT, the scale is composed of seven categories of risk factors. When the scale was tested on a trauma/orthopaedic unit a cut-off score of 16 yielded 100% sensitivity, 81% specificity and a correlation coefficient of 0.98. The DVT scale is designed to allow application in diverse clinical specialties. It is recommended that nurses using the Autar DVT scale should evaluate for themselves the best cut-off score to achieve maximum predictive accuracy."
CD008201,0,15724231,0,[Guidelines for dialysis. Replacement therapy for acute renal failure in critically ill patients].,"Acute renal failure (ARF) in patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) is mostly caused by ischemic or toxic injury, with a higher incidence in the latest years due to the growing number of interventions in cardiac and vascular surgery and to the general enhancement of reanimation techniques, which allow a better outcome among ICU patients. In critically ill patients, the ARF incidence reported in the literature ranges between 1 and 25%. Among ICU patients with ARF the mortality is between 40 and 65%, much more than in patients without this complication. Higher mortality rates, longer hospitalisation times and higher therapy costs demand from us an early diagnosis and treatment of ARF. Due to the lack of controlled and randomized proofs, recommended criteria for starting renal replacement therapy (RRT) in critical ARF patients might overlap with those for ESRD therapy. Moreover, randomised and controlled trials, confirming the actual efficacy of early onset of RRT on the mortality rate, are not yet available. As for stable ESRD patients, a direct relationship between dialytic doses and mortality and morbidity has been established for ARF patients. For ARF patients, as well as for ESRD patients, a minimum Kt/V of 1.2 three times a week should be ensured, although higher doses for critical ARF patients may achieve better results. The choice between intermittent (IRRT) and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) in these patients is still a controversial issue. In spite of the fact that most studies report a better outcome in patients treated with CRRT, a recent meta-analysis failed to demonstrate any difference on the relative risk (RR) of mortality and on the rate of renal recovery between patients treated with either IRRT or CRRT. Furthermore, the use of peritoneal dialysis for the treatment of ARF patients in ICU has not been dismissed yet; so far this is indeed considered to be the technique of choice in some specific clinical situations. The intrinsic urgency of dialysis in ARF patients entails the use of temporary central venous catheters. The internal right jugular vein is usually preferred for these catheters because of the easier insertion and the lower risk of stenosis and thrombosis. The anticoagulant procedure should be chosen on the basis of patient characteristics, treatment typology and the likelihood of effectively monitoring its action. The choice of buffers in the dialysate, mostly lactate or bicarbonate, should depend on patient characteristics; so far, however, controlled but not randomized studies do not show any significant difference in the correction of metabolic acidosis between lactate and bicarbonate."

CD008201,0,21455855,0,"Multiple myeloma, venous thromboembolism, and treatment-related risk of thrombosis.","Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a disease with a high prevalence in elderly people, affecting > 5% of the population > 65 years of age. Cancer patients have a 4.3-fold higher incidence of thrombotic complications, due to multiple risk factors that are not always related to the disease. Among hematologic malignancies, multiple myeloma (MM) confers a high risk of developing such complications, with a VTE rate of nearly 10%. Multiple factors are involved in MM-related VTE, such as increased blood viscosity, high levels of immunoglobulin, procoagulant activity of monoclonal protein, and inflammatory cytokines. Since the introduction of the immunomodulatory derivatives (IMiDs) thalidomide and lenalidomide in the therapeutic armamentarium of MM, VTE has emerged as one of the leading complications, in particular in patients with newly diagnosed MM. In this setting, IMiDs-based treatments are associated with rates of VTE reaching values up to 14 to 26%, particularly when dexamethasone or chemotherapy are added. The optimal prophylaxis for patients receiving these antiangiogenetic agents is still a matter of debate. Due to the lack of prospective randomized clinical trials, different studies have used various anticoagulant prophylaxes, including fixed low-dose warfarin (1 mg or 1.25 mg), therapeutic doses of warfarin (international normalized ratio between 2.0 and 3.0), low molecular weight heparin, or low-dose aspirin. As yet, no study has clearly demonstrated a significant superiority of one prophylactic regimen in comparison with the others. Further investigation and more randomized clinical trials are needed to define the best thromboprophylaxis."

Several meta-analyses have been undertaken in attempts to determine whether one regimen may be more beneficial for safety and efficacy. Currently, not all international guidelines include a recommended frequency for UFH. Delineation of this frequency may be helpful to the practicing clinician. Primary studies (with a modified Jadad score of >or=6 to demonstrate a stronger study design) that compared low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) and UFH, and UFH and placebo were evaluated. Meta-analyses evaluating safety and efficacy of LMWH versus UFH, or TID UFH versus BID UFH were also evaluated. Although BID UFH shows some efficacy in one primary study, it is no more beneficial than no prophylaxis in another study. LMWH appears to be more efficacious than BID UFH, but comparable in safety and efficacy to TID UFH. Meta-analytic data demonstrates that BID UFH may have some reduction in deep vein thrombosis. Meta-analytic data also suggests that TID UFH is more efficacious than BID UFH at the cost of more major bleeding. The medical patient with risk factors for the development of VTE appears to be at moderate to high risk. International guidelines for VTE prevention should incorporate a frequency for UFH to guide use. TID UFH is superior in efficacy to BID UFH even when taking into consideration the increased rate of major bleeds. Newly published risk-assessment models may be beneficial in determining which patients would best benefit from BID UFH or TID UFH."

In the United States it causes 2 million annual cases. Its annual incidence is 1-2 cases per 1,000 individuals in the general population. It is a disease frequently associated with life threatening complications and its mortality rate is 1-5% of cases. Due to its high complication rate, its slow recovery, and the need for prolonged disability, it is considered as a high-cost disease. VTED may occur in both surgical and medical patients; the known associated risk factors include prolonged rest, active cancer, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and stroke, among the major medical conditions. Orthopedic surgery represents the main surgical risk factor for VTED, including mainly hip and knee replacements, as well as polytraumatized patients with severe spinal lesions, and major fractures. VTED may be prevented with the appropriate use of antithrombotics.

To determine the adherence to the current recommendations, and the incidence of adverse events, we carried out the prospective, multicenter, observational WARfarin and coronary STENTing (WAR-STENT) registry (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00722319). All consecutive patients on warfarin undergoing PCI-S at 37 Italian centers were enrolled and followed for 12 months. Outcome measures were: major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), including cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, need for urgent revascularization, stroke, and venous thromboembolism, and major and minor bleeding. In this paper, we report the in-hospital findings. Out of the 411 patients enrolled, 92% were at non-low (ie, moderate or high) thromboembolic risk. The radial approach and bare-metal stents were used in 61% and 60% of cases, respectively. Drug-eluting stents were essentially reserved to patients with diabetes, which in turn, significantly predicted the implantation of drug-eluting stents (odds ratio [OR], 2.02; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.29-3.17; P=.002). The in-hospital MACE and major bleeding rates were 2.7% and 2.1%, respectively. At discharge, triple therapy (TT) of warfarin, aspirin, and clopidogrel was prescribed to 76% of patients. Prescription of TT was significantly more frequent in the non-low thromboembolic risk group. Non-low thromboembolic risk, in turn, was a significant predictor of TT prescription (OR, 11.2; 95% CI, 4.83-26.3; P<.0001). In conclusion, real-world warfarin patients undergoing PCI-S are largely managed according to the current recommendations. As a consequence, the risk of in-hospital MACE and major bleedings appears limited and acceptable."

CD008201,0,19158017,0,[Antithrombotic therapy in primary and secondary stroke prevention of cardiac patients and in acute stroke].,"Primary vascular prevention: the prevalence of cardiogenic stroke will increase in the future. All patients with atrial fibrillation but without any ischemic stroke, must undergo a rigorous risk evaluation, which is crucial for pharmacotherapy. Atrial fibrillation is an important risk factor for stroke, therefore patients with atrial fibrillation should be anticoagulated (except those without other risk factors). Even patients over 75 years with atrial fibrillation could be anticoagulated if the INR is properly controlled. The authors review also the role of anticoagulation in patients suffering from myocardial infarction or valve diseases. Acute stroke: The new European stroke guideline does not recommend the use of conventional or fractionated heparin in the first three days of acute stroke, but aspirin therapy is recommended. Long-term anticoagulation is needed only if cardiac source of emboli can be verified, the patient has good compliance, and the risk of hemorrhagic complication is low (INR: 2-3). Otherwise, antiplatelet therapy is recommended. Some authors recommend early anticoagulation in special cases (high risk of embolisation, left atrial/ventricular thrombus, arterial dissection or surgical intervention for a severe arterial stenosis). Caution is needed in patients with large infarct, uncontrolled hypertension and microbleeds on MRI. Secondary prevention: Antiplatelet therapy is recommended for every post-stroke patient, but for those with cardiac source of emboli anticoagulation is recommended."
CD008201,0,18841341,0,Barriers to the optimal use of anticoagulants after orthopaedic surgery.,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) and the consequent morbidity and mortality associated with this condition continue to be a problem following orthopaedic surgery. The vast majority of patients undergoing orthopaedic surgery receive some form of thromboprophylaxis. However, the use of inappropriate thromboprophylaxis is an important factor which may explain why the clinical burden of VTE is still considerable. Barriers to the use of appropriate thromboprophylaxis include the belief by some surgeons that pharmacological thromboprophylaxis increases the risk of bleeding and the asymptomatic nature of deep vein thrombosis. In addition, in patients at risk of VTE, thromboprophylaxis should be given beyond the standard duration recommended in international or national guidelines, and many surgeons have concerns about adherence and adverse events in the outpatient setting. Furthermore, currently available anticoagulants have drawbacks, including the need for monitoring, or a subcutaneous route of administration. The introduction and implementation of multi-faceted and integrated approaches to thromboprophylaxis could improve adherence with current guidelines, extend appropriate thromboprophylaxis according to risk factors, and improve patient outcomes in this setting. In addition, the development of new anticoagulants with more convenient administration regimens and no need for monitoring may help to achieve these objectives."

Patients with LAC had a significantly more frequent history of thrombosis (35.5% vs 2.4%). LAC was absent in an overwhelming majority of women with exclusively early recurrent pregnancy loss but was associated with sporadic stillbirth. Among our panel of assays, none was predominant, and an increasing number of positive assays was associated with an increased history of morbidity.

When indicated, intravenous thrombolysis must be initiated as soon as possible. It is possible to use intravenous alteplase in patients with seizures at stroke onset, if the neurological deficit is related to acute cerebral ischemia. Intravenous alteplase can be discussed for use on a case-by-case basis, according to risk of bleeding, in selected patients under 18 years and over 80 years of age, although for the current European recommendations this would be an off-label use. In hospitals with a stroke unit, intravenous thrombolysis is prescribed by a neurologist (current French labelling) or a physician having the French certification for neurovascular diseases (outside the current French labelling). The patient must be monitored in the stroke unit or in case of multiple organ failure in an intensive and critical care unit. In hospitals without a stroke unit, thrombolysis must be decided by the neurologist from the corresponding stroke unit via telemedicine. It is recommended to perform brain imaging 24 hours after thromboysis. Intra-arterial thrombolysis can be contemplated on a case-by-case basis after multidisciplinary discussion within a 6-hour time window for patients with acute middle cerebral artery or carotid occlusions, and within a larger time window for patients with basilar artery occlusion, because of their very poor spontaneous prognosis. Mechanical thrombectomy can also be contemplated in the same situations. With antiplatelet agents, it is recommended that patients receive aspirin (160 mg-325 mg) within 48 hours of ischemic stroke onset. When thrombolysis is performed or contemplated, it is recommended to delay the initiation of aspirin or other antithrombotic drugs for 24 hours. The use of antiplatelet agents that inhibit the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor is not recommended. Urgent anticoagulation using heparin, low-molecular-weight heparins or danaparoid with the goal to treat ischemic stroke patients is not recommended. Secondary prevention by anticoagulation can be used, immediately or within the first days, after minor ischemic stroke or TIA in patients with a high risk for cardioembolism, if uncontrolled hypertension is absent. In patients with large infarcts and a high risk for cardioembolism, the timing for initiating anticoagulation must be decided on a case-by-case basis. In patients with anticoagulation who had an ischemic stroke, the decision to temporarily stop or maintain anticoagulation must be made on a case-by-case basis, depending on thromboembolic risk, level of anticoagulation at stroke onset and estimated risk of hemorrhagic transformation. It is not recommended to use neuroprotective agents in ischemic stroke patients. Patients with cerebral venous thrombosis must be treated with therapeutic doses of heparin, even in case of concomitant intracranial hemorrhage related to cerebral venous thrombosis. If the patient's status worsens despite adequate anticoagulation, thrombolysis may be used in selected cases. The optimal administration route (local or intravenous), thrombolytic agent (urokinase or alteplase) and dose are unknown. There is currently no recommendation with regard to local thrombolytic therapy in patients with dural sinus thrombosis.

The aim of this study is to describe patients taking dabigatran, to evaluate its use in the real world and the eligibility for therapy, according to the criteria established by the Italian Medicines Agency (AIFA). Methods. A retrospective review was conducted using dabigatran prescriptions in patients with NVAF. Data were retrieved from the prescriptions recorded in the hospital pharmacy of Careggi General Hospital from June to October 2013. Results. Data were related to 138 patients with NVAF who have at least one dabigatran prescription. Patients have a mean age of 79.0 ± 8.9 years, mean CHA2DS2-VASc 4.4 ± 3.0 and mean HAS-BLED 3.0 ± 1.0. 49.3% were male and 50% were older than 80 years; 18.8% were treated with high-dose dabigatran (150 mg). According to the AIFA criteria, 85.5% of patients were eligible for treatment: 34% were at high embolic and bleeding risk and 70.2% reported objective problems in routine coagulation monitoring. Conclusions. Our patients can be categorized in two groups: subjects with high risk of embolism and bleeding for whom the new oral anticoagulant dabigatran provides clinically important benefit, and subjects for whom the benefit derives from a simplified management of therapy. It should be interesting to evaluate the rate of therapeutic adherence in these patients in order to verify the expected clinical benefits."
CD008201,0,23466969,0,Bleeding risk assessment in patients with atrial fibrillation who are taking oral anticoagulants.,"Prevention of thromboembolism is the key priority in the management of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). Clinical decisions on antithrombotic management should be based on the balance between an individual's thromboembolic and hemorrhagic risk. The HAS-BLED score is a simple and user-friendly tool for the assessment of bleeding risk. It is recommended for bleeding risk assessment by the 2010 European Society of Cardiology guidelines for the management of AF, and the latest guidelines of the Canadian Cardiovascular Society for the prevention of stroke and systemic thromboembolism in patients with AF and atrial flutter. A HAS-BLED score ≥ 3 indicates high risk for hemorrhage and suggests that modifiable risk factors affecting bleeding (eg, blood pressure, hepatic/renal function, international normalized ratio, antiplatelet agents, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) be reviewed and corrected. Patients at high risk for stroke (CHA2DS2-VASc score ≥ 2) and hemorrhage (HAS-BLED score ≥ 3) seem to gain significant benefit from oral anticoagulants. As a general rule, oral anticoagulants should be considered for all patients with AF, except those at very low risk for stroke (CHA2DS2-VASc score of 0) and those at extremely high risk for bleeding. The newer oral anticoagulants (eg, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban) are promising alternatives to vitamin K antagonists for the prevention of stroke in patients with nonvalvular AF."
CD008201,0,23299032,0,Transitions of care in anticoagulation management for patients with atrial fibrillation.,"Thromboprophylaxis with oral anticoagulants (OACs) is an important but underused element of atrial fibrillation (AF) treatment. Reduction of stroke risk with anticoagulants comes at the price of increased bleeding risk. Patients with AF receiving anticoagulants require heightened attention with transition from one care setting to another. Patients presenting for emergency care of anticoagulant-related bleeding should be triaged for the severity and source of the bleeding using appropriate measures, such as discontinuing the OAC, administering vitamin K, when appropriate, to reverse warfarin-induced bleeding, or administering clotting factors for emergent bleeding. Reversal of OACs in patients admitted to the hospital for surgery can be managed similarly to patients with bleeding, depending on the urgency of the surgical procedure. Patients with AF who are admitted for conditions unrelated to AF should be assessed for adequacy of stroke risk prophylaxis and bleeding risk. Newly diagnosed AF should be treated in nearly all patients with either warfarin or a newer anticoagulant. Patient education is critically important with all anticoagulants. Close adherence to the prescribed regimen, regular international normalized ratio testing for warfarin, and understanding the stroke risk conferred by both AF and aging are goals for all patients receiving OACs. Detailed handoff from the hospitalist to the patient's primary care physician is required for good continuity of care. Monitoring by an anticoagulation clinic is the best arrangement for most patients. The elderly, or particularly frail or debilitated patients who are transferring to long-term care, need a detailed transfer of information between settings, education for the patient and family, and medication reconciliation. Communication and coordination of care among outpatient, emergency, inpatient, and long-term care settings are vital for patients with AF who are receiving anticoagulants to balance stroke prevention and bleeding risk."

CD008201,0,23428112,0,Does warfarin use impact hospital length of stay? A retrospective study looking at patients treated for atrial fibrillation.,"The authors received anecdotal practice information from clinicians indicating that when warfarin was initiated in the hospital setting, it may be associated with an increased length of stay (LOS): specifically to achieve a desired minimum international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.0 before discharge in a subset of patients where clinicians perceived follow-up after discharge was not deemed optimal. Given that oral thromboprophylactic anticoagulation with warfarin is the mainstay treatment for the prevention of stroke in atrial fibrillation (AF), the authors decided to look at hospitalized patients from this population to determine if a subset of these patients experienced an increased LOS. The study design entailed a retrospective chart review of consecutive patients admitted to a large, tertiary care, academic center. Patients were included if they were admitted with a primary, secondary, or most responsible diagnosis of paroxysmal or chronic AF. Medical records were audited over an 18-month period (February 1, 2009, to July 31, 2010) to determine the average LOS and to identify patients with a documented prolonged LOS secondary due to subtherapeutic INR at the time of potential discharge. Our final study cohort of 189 patients had an average LOS of 5.2 days (SD = 5.2). However, for eight (4.2%) of these patients discharge was delayed an additional 2.25 days (SD = 1.3) for reasons solely attributed to achieving a therapeutic INR."
CD008201,0,6715683,0,Therapeutic approach to acute pulmonary embolism.,"Many therapeutic aspects of venous thromboembolism continue to generate controversy so that the general therapeutic guidelines given below are only indicative. The first step is the diagnosis of venous thromboembolism; this is done in the vast majority of patients by visualization of blood clots using either pulmonary angiography or phlebography. The second step is to arrest the thrombotic process; the best means of doing this is to administer IV heparin. In the case of contra-indication or documented inefficacy of heparin therapy, the only therapeutic solution is to interrupt the inferior vena cava either with a clip, an umbrella or a filter. The blood clot lysis, which represents the third step, is effected by the natural fibrinolytic system. Thrombolytics , administered as a bolus of urokinase (15000 CTA U/kg), are indicated in cases of life-threatening pulmonary emboli, i.e. those with a pulmonary vascular obstruction of more than 50% and with hypotension, shock, or acute right ventricular failure. The use of thrombolytics is more questionable when they are administered to improve the quality of vascular patency. The only indication for pulmonary embolectomy is a contra-indication or inefficacy of thrombolytics . Due to the diagnostic and therapeutic difficulties, the first and most important part of the treatment of pulmonary emboli must be the broad application of prophylaxis treatment in patients with a high risk of venous thromboembolism."
CD008201,0,19520676,0,Economic and practical aspects of thromboprophylaxis with unfractionated and low-molecular-weight heparins in hospitalized medical patients.,"Acutely ill medical patients are at significant risk of developing venous thromboembolic (VTE) complications during or after their hospitalization. Venous thromboembolic events, such as proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE), place a high and unacceptable burden on health care resources, up to US$1.5 billion annually in the United States. However, the burden of VTE can be reduced by use of appropriate thromboprophylaxis. Prophylaxis of VTE with either a low-dose unfractionated heparin (UFH) or a low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) in medical inpatients is effective, well tolerated and cost-effective, compared with no prophylaxis. Low-molecular-weight heparins have a number of practical benefits over UFH, including once-daily subcutaneous injection and the potential to be used in the outpatient setting. These clinical advantages could translate to improved patient adherence to therapy and provide economic benefits, where LMWHs are more cost-effective compared with UFH."
CD008201,0,27459142,0,Venous Thromboembolism After Knee Arthroscopy in Undiagnosed Familial Thrombophilia.,"Venous thromboembolism is uncommon after knee arthroscopy, and there are no guidelines for thromboprophylaxis in elective routine knee arthroscopy. Preoperative evaluation of common thrombophilias should provide guidance for postarthroscopy thromboprophylaxis in otherwise healthy patients who are at high risk for venous thromboembolism. This study assessed 10 patients with venous thromboembolism after total hip or knee arthroplasty. Patients were assessed if venous thromboembolism occurred within 6 months after knee arthroscopy (n=10) or total hip or knee arthroplasty (n=21). This study assessed gene mutations (factor V Leiden, prothrombin G20210A, plasminogen activator inhibitor, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase) and serologic thrombophilias (high levels of factors VIII and XI, homocysteine, anticardiolipin immunoglobulin G and immunoglobulin M antibodies, and lupus anticoagulant; low antigenic protein C, S, and free S; and antithrombin III deficiency). The same coagulation data were obtained for normal subjects (n=110). The major thrombophilias in the arthroscopy group were factor V Leiden heterozygosity (40%), high factor VIII level (50%), and high homocysteine (30%). The respective values in control subjects were 2% (P=.0004), 7% (P=.0011), and 5% (P=.02). When the arthroscopy group was compared with the 21 patients who had venous thromboembolism after total hip or knee arthroplasty, the sole difference was factor V Leiden heterozygosity, which was 40% vs 0%, respectively (P=.007). Although venous thromboembolism after knee arthroscopy is uncommon, to identify high-risk patients and guide postoperative thromboprophylaxis, the authors suggest routine preoperative measurement of 3 common familial thrombophilias: factor V Leiden, factor VIII, and homocysteine.

CD008201,0,10327228,0,The role of age in cost-benefit analysis of thromboprophylaxis.,"Socioeconomic studies about deep-vein thrombosis prophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparins have shown that general prophylaxis in patients at risk is economically justified. However, the question arises whether the guidelines for thromboprophylaxis developed hitherto provide a fair balance between the medical as well as the socio-economic standpoint and the need of the individual patient. Thromboprophylaxis has to be performed according to acknowledged professional standards under the restraints of cost-effectiveness, whereas the patient is only interested in receiving the best treatment available. Guidelines for thromboprophylaxis are based on the allocation of risk factors, one of those, a higher age of the patient. Most guidelines mention a threshold of 40 years, only in cases where additional risks prevail, thromboprophylaxis in younger patients is recommended. Because some trials suggest that the thromboembolic risk in young patients has been underestimated so far, a computer model was developed to determine the age-dependent cost-benefit ratio for thromboprophylaxis. The results with different sets of input data show that providing thromboprophylaxis to younger patients is also cost-effective, suggesting to reconsider the existing medical guidelines."
CD008201,0,9768345,0,Use of L-asparaginase in childhood ALL.,"Owing to the high efficacy of L-asparaginase in the treatment of acute lymphatic leukaemia the enzyme was introduced into the chemotherapy schedules for remission induction of this disease shortly after results of large-scale clinical trials had become available. Since asparaginase monotherapy was associated with a high response rate but short remission duration, the enzyme is currently employed within the framework of combination chemotherapy schedules which achieve treatment response in about 90% and long-term remissions in the majority of patients. Recently initiated clinical trials have still confirmed the eminent value of asparaginase in the combination chemotherapy of acute lymphatic leukaemia and of some subtypes of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and its important role as an essential component of multimodal treatment protocols. Despite the unique mechanism of action of this cytotoxic substance which shows relative selectivity with regard to the metabolism of malignant cells, some patients experience toxic effects during asparaginase therapy. Immunological reactions toward the foreign protein include enzyme inactivation without any clinical manifestations as well as anaphylactic shock. Severe functional disorders of organ systems result from the impaired homeostasis of the amino acids asparagine and glutamine. The changes affecting the proteins of the coagulation system have considerable clinical impact as they may induce bleeding as well as thromboembolic events and may be associated with life-threatening complications when the central nervous system is involved. Risk factors predisposing to thromboembolic complications are hereditary resistance against activated protein C and any other hereditary thrombophilia. Other organ systems potentially affected by relevant functional disorders are the central nervous system, the liver, and the pancreas, with patients who have a history of pancreatic disorders carrying an especially high risk of developing pancreatitis. Studies on the mechanisms of action and the occurrence of resistance phenomena have shown that a treatment response may only be expected if the malignant cells are unable to increase their asparagine synthetase activity to an extent providing enough asparagine to the cell; one may thus conclude that the enzyme-induced asparagine depletion of the serum constitutes the decisive cytotoxic mechanism. Independent of the asparagine depletion related cytotoxicity however, there are other mechanisms of clinical relevance like induction of apoptosis. Besides this, further influences on signal transduction cannot be excluded. Only few publications have dealt with the question of minimum trough activities to be ensured before each subsequent asparaginase dose in order to maintain uninterrupted asparagine depletion under treatment, and answers to this problem are not definitive. Clinical studies using enzymes from E. coli strains indicate that a trough activity of 100 U/l will suffice for complete asparagine depletion of the fluid body compartments with the preparations studied. These findings have been transferred to enzymes from other E. coli strains as well as those isolated from Erwinia chrysanthemi and to the PEG-conjugated E. coli asparaginases. It might be desirable to countercheck the results for confirmation or correction. The dosage and administration schedule of the various enzyme preparations required for complete asparagine depletion over a period of time have been insufficiently defined. While pharmacokinetic studies showed clinically relevant differences in biological activity and activity half-lives for enzymes from different biological sources, the findings of recently published clinical trials indicate that the therapeutic efficacy is affected when different asparaginase preparations are given by identical therapy schedules.

Grade 1 recommendations are strong and indicate that the benefits do, or do not, outweigh risks, burden, and costs, and Grade 2 suggests that individual patients' values may lead to different choices (for a full understanding of the grading see Guyatt et al, CHEST 2004;126:179S-187S). Among the key recommendations in this chapter are the following: For patients with chronic limb ischemia, we recommend lifelong aspirin therapy in comparison to no antiplatelet therapy in patients with clinically manifest coronary or cerebrovascular disease (Grade 1A) and in those without clinically manifest coronary or cerebrovascular disease (Grade 1C+). We recommend clopidogrel over no antiplatelet therapy (Grade 1C+) but suggest that aspirin be used instead of clopidogrel (Grade 2A). For patients with disabling intermittent claudication who do not respond to conservative measures and who are not candidates for surgical or catheter-based intervention, we suggest cilostazol (Grade 2A). We suggest that clinicians not use cilostazol in patients with less-disabling claudication (Grade 2A). In these patients, we recommend against the use of pentoxifylline (Grade 1B). We suggest clinicians not use prostaglandins (Grade 2B). In patients with intermittent claudication, we recommend against the use of anticoagulants (Grade 1A). In patients with acute arterial emboli or thrombosis, we recommend treatment with immediate systemic anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin (UFH) [Grade 1C]. We also recommend systemic anticoagulation with UFH followed by long-term vitamin K antagonist (VKA) in patients with embolism [Grade 1C]). For patients undergoing major vascular reconstructive procedures, we recommend UFH at the time of application of vascular cross-clamps (Grade 1A). In patients undergoing prosthetic infrainguinal bypass, we recommend aspirin (Grade 1A). In patients undergoing infrainguinal femoropopliteal or distal vein bypass, we suggest that clinicians do not routinely use a VKA (Grade 2A). For routine patients undergoing infrainguinal bypass without special risk factors for occlusion, we recommend against VKA plus aspirin (Grade 1A). For those at high risk of bypass occlusion and limb loss, we suggest VKA plus aspirin (Grade 2B). In patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy, we recommend aspirin preoperatively and continued indefinitely (Grade 1A). In nonoperative patients with asymptomatic or recurrent carotid stenosis, we recommend lifelong aspirin (Grade 1C+). For all patients undergoing extremity balloon angioplasty, we recommend long-term aspirin (Grade 1C+)."

CD008201,0,15768918,0,[Routine nursing measures for thrombosis prevention in a university hospital].,"A literature search on the subject of thrombosis prevention showed that there have been changes in preventive nursing measures in the last three decades. Data on preventive measures as actually employed at the different Clinics of the Innsbruck Medical University were gathered with the help of written questionnaires (completed by 192 staff nurses and 111 nursing students) with the aim of instituting improvements in such measures in actual practice. Our investigation showed that 56.9% of the participants did not know what the appropriate time was for discarding graduated elastic compression stockings for antithrombotic prophylaxis; 72.7% reported that they measured patients' legs for proper fit only seldom or not at all. 77.5% said that patients refused to wear the elastic stockings during the night. Only 22.3% reported that the compression device was worn by patients 24 hours a day. 82.5% had not participated in any continuing education programmes on thrombosis prophylaxis in the past five years. According to 42.3% of study participants, nursing measures for thrombosis prevention must be carried out jointly by physician and nurse. Based on this investigation, we have compiled a booklet of guidelines to be used for teaching nursing students and for continuing education of staff nurses, and have raised our internal standards to comply with the state of the art in thrombosis prevention. We plan to investigate antithrombotic measures currently in place in the area of intensive care. It is also planned to invite the opinion of patients on the matter of wearing compression stockings for thrombosis prophylaxis in order to gain some understanding of the reasons why patients refuse to wear them at night."

In contrast to surgical patients, the evidence supporting the use of heparin-based treatment for prevention of VTE (HVTEp) may not justify current guidelines. This study aims to determine whether current clinical guidelines for HVTEp are appropriate for medical patients. We searched medical databases for original randomised placebo-controlled studies of HVTEp in medical patients, excluding those with stroke and in intensive care. From 401 potentially relevant studies, we selected eight, which included over 16 000 patients. HVTEp decreased the incidence of all deep venous thromboses (DVT): 4.3% in the placebo group versus 2.3% in the treatment group, P = 0.002, number needed to treat, 50. However, this treatment effect was not seen for symptomatic DVT: 1.2% versus 0.9%, P = 0.18, odds ratio (OR) 0.72 (0.45-1.16). Similarly, HVTEp did not decrease the incidence of pulmonary embolism (PE): 0.54% versus 0.27%, P = 0.3, OR 0.57 (0.21-1.53), or fatal PE: 0.1% versus 0.0%, P = 0.3, OR 0.2 (0.01-4.11). Furthermore, HVTEp did not decrease total mortality: 5.63% versus 5.39%, P = 0.92, OR 0.96 (0.78-1.18).

CD008201,0,17427618,0,Outpatient management of anticoagulation therapy.,"The Seventh American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) Conference on Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy provides guidelines for outpatient management of anticoagulation therapy. The ACCP guidelines recommend short-term warfarin therapy, with the goal of maintaining an International Normalized Ratio (INR) of 2.5 +/- 0.5, after major orthopedic surgery. Therapy for venous thromboembolism includes an INR of 2.5 +/- 0.5, with the length of therapy determined by associated conditions. For patients with atrial fibrillation, the INR is maintained at 2.5 +/- 0.5 indefinitely; for most patients with mechanical valves, the recommended INR is 3.0 +/- 0.5 indefinitely. Use of outpatient low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is as safe and effective as inpatient unfractionated heparin for treatment of venous thromboembolism. The ACCP recommends starting warfarin with unfractionated heparin or LMWH for at least five days and continuing until a therapeutic INR is achieved. Because patients with venous thromboembolism and cancer who have been treated with LMWH have a survival advantage that extends beyond their venous thromboembolism treatment, the ACCP recommends beginning their therapy with three to six months of LMWH. When invasive procedures require the interruption of oral anticoagulation therapy, recommendations for bridge therapy are determined by balancing the risk of bleeding against the risk of thromboembolism. Patients at higher risk of thromboembolization should stop warfarin therapy four to five days before surgery and start LMWH or unfractionated heparin two to three days before surgery."
CD008201,0,22697152,0,Prevention of venous thromboembolism in patients admitted to Australian hospitals: summary of National Health and Medical Research Council clinical practice guideline.,"Each year in Australia, about 1 in 1000 people develop a first episode of venous thromboembolism (VTE), which approximates to about 20,000 cases. More than half of these episodes occur during or soon after a hospital admission, which makes them potentially preventable. This paper summarises recommendations from the National Health and Medical Research Council's 'Clinical Practice Guideline for the Prevention of Venous Thromboembolism in Patients Admitted to Australian Hospitals' and describes the way these recommendations were developed. The guideline has two aims: to provide advice on VTE prevention to Australian clinicians and to support implementation of effective programmes for VTE prevention in Australian hospitals by offering evidence-based recommendations which local hospital guidelines can be based on. Methods for preventing VTE are pharmacological and/or mechanical, and they require appropriate timing, dosing and duration and also need to be accompanied by good clinical care, such as promoting mobility and hydration whilst in hospital. With some procedures or injuries, the risk of VTE is sufficiently high to require that all patients receive an effective form of prophylaxis unless this is contraindicated; in other clinical settings, the need for prophylaxis requires individual assessment. For optimal VTE prevention, all patients admitted to hospital should have early and formal assessments of: (i) their intrinsic VTE risk and the risks related to their medical conditions; (ii) the added VTE risks resulting from surgery or trauma; (iii) bleeding risks that would contraindicate pharmacological prophylaxis; (iv) any contraindications to mechanical prophylaxis, culminating in (v) a decision about prophylaxis (pharmacological and/or mechanical, or none). The most appropriate form of prophylaxis will depend on the type of surgery, medical condition and patient characteristics. Recommendations for various clinical circumstances are provided as summary tables with relevance to orthopaedic surgical procedures, other types of surgery and medical inpatients. In addition, the tables indicate the grades of supporting evidence for the recommendations (these range from Grade A which can be trusted to guide practice, to Grade D where there is more uncertainty; Good Practice Points are consensus-based expert opinions)."

The findings are based on a prospective register of all patients undergoing total hip replacement (THR), total knee replacement (TKR), or nailed hip fracture (NHF) in a Scandinavian hospital between 1989 and 1998. All patients received thromboprophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin, continued until discharge. Patients with suspected PE underwent ventilation/perfusion scintigraphy and/or spiral CT. Patients with concomitant clinical signs of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) were also subjected to imaging diagnostics. 3,954 patients underwent THR, TKR, or NHF; 122 of them were readmitted on clinical suspicion of PE, and 50 cases were confirmed. Of patients with confirmed PE, 6/50 had DVT. The average time to readmission was 35 (5-94) days after THR, 24 (1-173) days after NHF, and 9 (2-17) days after TKR. Following major hip surgery, the incidence of PE remained high for at least 2-3 months (less following TKR) in those given thromboprophylaxis for about 10 days. The differences in PE incidence and the time when it developed in NHF versus THR and TKR patients suggest that these patients should be considered separately when determining the optimal thromboprophylactic regimen."

CD008201,0,17171588,0,Prevention of venous thromboembolism.,"Patients with clinical conditions such as surgery, trauma, and acute medical illness have a transiently increased risk of venous thromboembolism and merit consideration for adequate thromboprophylaxis. The choice of an appropriate pharmacologic or physical means of prophylaxis should be made taking into account both the thrombotic and bleeding risk associated with patient-related factors and the type of surgery or other disease state involved. A large number of randomized clinical trials, meta-analyses, and guidelines developed by scientific societies worldwide have addressed this issue and have provided information and recommendations that should be considered carefully. The aim of this review is to provide the practicing physician with a brief updated summary of the subject, stratifying those patients at low thrombotic risk who do not require specific thromboprophylaxis apart from early ambulation, from those at moderate or higher thrombotic risk. Patients at moderate thrombotic risk face a 10 to 20% risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and require prophylaxis with low-dose unfractionated heparin or low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs) at a dosage < 3400 U once daily, or with graduated elastic stockings if their bleeding risk is high. Patients with an expected 20 to 40% DVT rate without prophylaxis are considered at high thrombotic risk and should be treated preferentially with LMWHs at high prophylactic dosage (> 3400 U). Patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery face a DVT rate > 40%, are considered at very high risk of venous thromboembolism, and should be given either LMWHs at high prophylactic dosage, fondaparinux, or vitamin K antagonists--either alone or in association with intermittent pneumatic compression devices."

CD008201,0,26798745,0,Type B Aortic Dissection: A Review of Prognostic Factors and Meta-analysis of Treatment Options.,"According to international guidelines, stable patients with uncomplicated Type B aortic dissection (TBAD) should receive optimal medical treatment. Despite adequate antihypertensive therapy, the long-term prognosis of these patients is characterized by a significant aortic aneurysm formation in 25-30% within four years, and survival rates from 50 to 80% at five years and 30 to 60% at 10 years. In a prospective randomized trial, preemptive thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) in patients with chronic uncomplicated TBAD was associated with an excess early mortality (due to periprocedural hazards), but the procedure showed its benefit in prevention of aortic-specific mortality at five years of follow-up. However, preemptive TEVAR may not be the treatment of choice in all patients with uncomplicated TBAD because of the inherent periprocedural complications like stroke, paraparesis, and death, as well as stent graft-induced complications (i.e., retrograde dissection or endoleaks). Thus, the TEVAR-related deaths and complications (especially paraplegia and stroke) raise concerns that moderate the better survival with TEVAR at five years. By timely identification of those patients prone for developing complications, early intervention, preferably in the subacute or early chronic phase, may improve the overall long-term outcome for these patients. Therefore, early detectable and reliable prognostic factors for adverse events are essential to stratify patients who can be treated medically and those who will benefit from rigorous follow-up and, in the long-term, from timely, or even prophylactic, TEVAR. Several studies have identified prognostic factors in TBAD such as aortic diameter, partial false lumen thrombosis, false lumen thickness, and location of the primary entry tear. Combining these clinical and radiological predictors may be essential to implement a patient-specific approach designed to intervene only in those patients who are at high risk of developing complications to improve the long-term outcomes of patients with uncomplicated Type B aortic dissection."
CD008201,0,16698733,0,Antiplatelet and anticoagulant medication usage during stroke rehabilitation: the Post-Stroke Rehabilitation Outcomes Project (PSROP).,"Secondary prevention of strokes is an important issue during the admission to the inpatient rehabilitation facility (IRF). There are many clinical practice guidelines with strong levels of evidence that address the secondary prophylaxis of strokes. The Post-Stroke Rehabilitation Outcomes Project (PSROP) database was used to describe the frequency that antiplatelet and/or anticoagulant medications are prescribed for the secondary prophylaxis of a stroke. Of the 1,161 participants in the PSROP, 890 (76.66%) had nonhemorrhagic strokes. Of the participants with nonhemorrhagic strokes, 169 (18.99%) did not receive any antiplatelet or anticoagulant medication. Of 717 participants who did not have an embolic event, 140 (19.5%) did not receive a salicylate, antiplatelet agent, or warfarin. Of 173 participants who had an embolic event, 29 (16.8%) did not receive a salicylate, antiplatelet agent, or warfarin. Unless patients have any medical contraindications to these medications, they should receive these evidence-based treatments for secondary stroke prophylaxis. As more stroke survivors receive antiplatelet and/or anticoagulant medications, it is more likely that the incidence of recurrent strokes will decrease."
CD008201,0,20469630,0,Venous thromboembolism prevention: a systematic review of methods to improve prophylaxis and decrease events in the hospitalized patient.,"Prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) is currently a key initiative internationally and in US hospitals, where there has been a recent focus on national quality initiatives to prevent hospital-acquired VTE. Multiple strategies exist to prevent VTE by increasing prophylaxis rates in the hospitalized setting. Active, multifaceted interventions, including provider education, an active reminder to the provider, and regular audit and feedback to medical and hospital staff, appear to be the most effective current interventions. Active intervention programs have been validated both as electronic alerts, with or without computerized clinical decision support software and, more recently, human alerts, many of which utilize in-hospital pharmacists. A passive strategy, such as guideline dissemination, should not be used as a lone method. Although inappropriate duration remains a key reason as to why at-risk patients do not receive appropriate thromboprophylaxis within the hospital (defined by type, dose, and duration of prophylaxis), few studies address duration compared with hospital length of stay. Preventable VTE is a new quality outcome measure for hospitals but is measured in few studies. Future studies should focus on comparing various multifaceted interventions to assess their effect over time, including endpoints of bleeding for safety, appropriate type, dose, and duration of prophylaxis, overall and preventable VTE, and the impact on unnecessary prophylaxis for patients not at risk."
CD008201,0,22457187,0,What do you do with the antiplatelet agents in patients with drug eluting stents who then receive a mechanical valve?,"Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAT) with aspirin and clopidogrel is a cornerstone of treatment during and after percutaneous coronary interventions with drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation. Oral anticoagulation (OAC) is the recommended treatment for patients with mechanical heart valves. When patients with DES need a mechanical heart valve or vice versa, we face the difficult choice of their antithrombotic therapy. Different institutions empirically follow a combination of OAC and single or DAT, the so-called triple antithrombotic therapy (TT) aiming to find the best balance between the thrombotic and bleeding risk for this subset of patients. A best evidence topic in cardiac surgery was written according to a structured protocol. The question addressed was whether there is an optimal antithrombotic management for patients with DES undergoing mechanical heart valve or vice versa. Altogether, more than 148 papers were found using the reported search, of which 16 represented the best evidence to answer the clinical question. The authors, journal, date and country of publication, patient group studied, study type, relevant outcomes and results of these papers are tabulated. We conclude that DES implantation in patients who could potentially need valve surgery in the future should be discouraged and bare-metal stent or an aortic bioprosthesis preferred. However, in high-risk patients with DES, the recommendation is to postpone elective surgery for 1 year and, if surgery cannot be deferred, continue aspirin during the perioperative period. Moreover, when OAC is given in combination with clopidogrel and/or low-dose aspirin, the target INR should be 2.0-2.5 (Class IIb, level of evidence C). As per the long-term management, antithrombotic management with DAT alone in mechanical aortic valve replacement might be possible, but there is not enough evidence to support it. The available evidence suggests that triple anticoagulation (OAC + DAT) is associated with the best clinical outcome compared with all the other possible strategies. The duration of TT should be 3 months after sirolimus DES implantation, and 6 months after paclitaxel DES implantation, followed by long-term therapy with OAC plus clopidogrel or aspirin with either PPIs, or H2-receptor antagonists (Class IIa Level of Evidence C)."

While the introduction of thromboprophylactic measures is expected to have reduced the occurrence of postoperative VTE, there is an increasing awareness of the importance of medical conditions in determining thromboembolic events. Among the conditions that predispose patients to VTE are increasing age, cancer and its treatment, prolonged immobility, stroke or paralysis, previous VTE, congestive heart failure, acute infection, pregnancy or puerperium, dehydration, hormonal treatment, varicose veins, long air travel, acute inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatologic disease, and nephrotic syndrome. Other factors that have recently been associated with an increased risk of VTE disorders include persistent elevation of D-dimer and atherosclerotic disease.

Platelet aggregation and thrombosis play a key role in the pathogenesis of unstable coronary syndromes. Over the past several years, multiple placebo-controlled trials involving more than 50,000 ACS patients have shown that blockade of the platelet receptor glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa, the final pathway in platelet aggregation, reduces the incidence of ischemic complications among patients with ACS. Three agents (abciximab, eptifibatide, and tirofiban) are currently approved for use with aspirin and heparin in the management of ACS or during percutaneous coronary intervention. They have consistently been shown to reduce the incidence of death or myocardial infarction in the ACS population including the patients not routinely scheduled for early revascularization. They provide an augmented treatment effect among high-risk ACS patients, particularly those who have a baseline troponin-t-positive status. Recently published practice guidelines have recommended their use in high-risk patients with ACS and all those undergoing PCI."

CD008201,0,26139085,0,Treating pulmonary embolism in Pacific Asia with direct oral anticoagulants.,"Pulmonary embolism (PE) is the principal preventable cause of in-hospital deaths. Prevalence of PE in Asians is uncertain but undoubtedly underestimated. Asians and Caucasians have similar non-genetic risk factors for PE, and there is mounting evidence that PE affects Asians much more commonly than previously supposed; incidence, especially among high-risk patients, may approach that in Caucasians. Furthermore, PE incidence in Asia is increasing, due to both increased ascertainment, and also population ageing and growing numbers of patients with predisposing risk factors. Despite being warranted, thromboprophylaxis for high-risk patients is not routine in Pacific Asian countries/regions. There also appears to be scope to implement venous thromboembolism (VTE) management guidelines more assiduously. Anticoagulants, primarily heparins and warfarin, have been the mainstays of VTE management for years; however, these agents have limitations that complicate routine use. The complexity of current guidelines has been another barrier to applying evidence-based recommendations in everyday practice. Updated management approaches have considerable potential to improve outcomes. New oral anticoagulants that are easier to administer, require no, or much less, monitoring or dose-adjustment and have a favourable risk/benefit profile compared with conventional modalities, may offer an alternative with the potential to simplify VTE management. However, more information is required on practical management and the occurrence and treatment of bleeding complications. Increasing recognition of the burden of PE and new therapeutic modalities are altering the VTE management landscape in Pacific Asia. Consequently, there is a need to further raise awareness and bridge gaps between the latest evidence and clinical practice."

The mortality rate of this major complication is similar in non-cardiovascular and cardiovascular surgery. Its incidence appears to be similar in Japan, Europe, and the United States. Perioperative physicians should be aware of the pathophysiology and predictors of ischemic stroke, and the anti-thrombotic strategies to prevent it. The main causes of perioperative ischemic stroke include cerebral atherothrombosis; lacuna stroke; cardiac thrombi due to atrial fibrillation; dehydration; hypotension; and perioperative systemic hypercoagulability. Perioperative management includes detailed informed consent regarding potential stroke risks, counseling, careful surgical treatment decisions, and identification of the high-risk patient for perioperative antithrombotic strategies. The 2009 Japanese guidelines for the management of stroke recommend using the appropriate intravenous infusions to avoid dehydration and consideration of anticoagulation in the patients who are at high risk for thrombosis and embolism while antithrombotic agents are discontinued. Understanding how to prevent perioperative ischemic stroke remains a challenge.

Nevertheless, the maintenance of anticoagulation for the maximal period peri-delivery appears appropriate in women considered to be at high risk of venous or arterial thromboembolism. We developed a regimen based on fixed thromboprophylactic dose of unfractionated heparin (UFH) peri-delivery and undertook an audit to evaluate the use and feasibility of this approach and any adverse events. Fixed intravenous thromboprophylactic dose of UFH (15,000 units/24 h) was commenced on the evening prior to a planned delivery [induction of labour or elective caesarean section (CS)], stopped 4 h predelivery and restarted 2-6 h postdelivery. Compliance was good with 32/38 consecutive deliveries managed according to the regimen. There were no cases of postpartum haemorrhage and no thrombosis associated with these 32 deliveries. Twenty-one patients were delivered by CS (11 elective) and eight patients received epidural/spinal anaesthesia without complication. In conclusion, the fixed thromboprophylactic dose UFH regimen provided maintenance of anticoagulation except for a matter of hours without excessive bleeding risk (conducive to neuroaxial anaesthesia) and was simple, flexible and acceptable to staff and patients."

CD008201,0,15965571,0,Antiadrenergic therapy in the control of atrial fibrillation.,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) in heart failure develops commonly in older individuals and its prevalence increases as heart failure severity progresses. Because of deteriorating hemodynamics, patients with heart failure are at increased risk for developing AF and, conversely, AF in heart failure patients is associated with adverse hemodynamic changes. AF is believed to increase the mortality risk in heart failure, which may be minimized by treatment that includes the control of ventricular rate, prevention of thrombotic events, and conversion to normal sinus rhythm. Clinical guidelines recommend amiodarone or dofetilide in heart failure patients, but these drugs have certain drawbacks, such as an increased risk for bradyarrhythmias with amiodarone and proarrhythmic reaction with dofetilide. Some but not all clinical trials have suggested that rate control should be the primary therapeutic goal in high-risk heart failure patients with AF and, if unsuccessful, followed by rhythm control. The former is effectively achieved with rate-lowering beta-blockers alone or in combination with digoxin. Recent studies evaluating the effects of combination carvedilol/digoxin therapy demonstrate synergistic effects between the two drugs. This combination therapy decreased heart failure symptoms, effectively reduced ventricular rate, and improved ventricular function to a greater extent compared with that produced by either drug alone. Although digoxin alone is an effective heart failure treatment, its use as a single rate-control therapy is often ineffective in heart failure patients with AF associated with rapid ventricular response. Carvedilol is effective, alone or in combination, with digoxin in such heart failure patients with AF, and has been shown to reduce mortality risk in patients with chronic heart failure during prolonged therapy."

This article reviews current strategies of pharmacological thromboprophylaxis. The level of VTE risk following surgery depends on a variety of factors that the surgeon should take into account, including the type of surgery and the presence of additional risk factors, such as elderly age and cancer. In patients undergoing minor general surgery, early mobilization is sufficient as prophylaxis, whereas in those undergoing major general surgery, thromboprophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), low-dose unfractionated heparin, or the pentasaccharide fondaparinux is recommended. Patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery have a particularly high risk of VTE, and routine thromboprophylaxis with LMWH, fondaparinux, or a vitamin K antagonist (international normalized ratio target: 2.0 to 3.0) is the standard of care in this group of patients. Recently, two new oral anticoagulants, rivaroxaban (a factor Xa inhibitor) and dabigatran etexilate (a direct thrombin inhibitor) have been licensed to be used for thromboprophylaxis after orthopedic surgery in Europe. Mechanical methods of thromboprophylaxis (compression stockings, intermittent pneumatic compression, vena cava filters), not discussed in detail in this review, should always be considered in patients at high thrombotic risk, in association with the pharmacological strategies, or in cases of contraindications to anticoagulants, as in patients or procedures at high risk of bleeding."

CD008201,0,25998374,0,Use of Non-Vitamin K Antagonist Oral Anticoagulants in Special Patient Populations with Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation: A Review of the Literature and Application to Clinical Practice.,"Atrial fibrillation is a commonly encountered arrhythmia associated with increased risk for thromboembolic events. Anticoagulation is necessary to decrease the risk of ischemic stroke. Traditionally, warfarin has been the only oral pharmacotherapeutic option for long-term anticoagulation in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF). Recently, non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOAC), including dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban, have become available as alternatives for warfarin in the prevention of stroke in patients with NVAF. Recently published atrial fibrillation guidelines contain new recommendations for risk stratification tools in determining the need for anticoagulant therapy and incorporate NOAC pharmacotherapy options for stroke prevention in patients with NVAF. NOACs offer several advantages over warfarin, including the elimination of routine laboratory monitoring, fewer drug and food interactions, and rapid therapeutic onset and offset. However, the lack of antidote in the case of serious bleeding and lack of data for long-term use in patient populations at risk for bleeding is problematic. Older adults are at high risk for thromboembolic and bleeding events as a result of anticoagulation and require special consideration when selecting anticoagulant therapy. The risk of drug accumulation and bleeding is concerning in the presence of renal impairment. The objective of this review is to provide the clinician with an update on the use of NOACs for NVAF, focusing on older adults and patients with renal impairment in light of recently published atrial fibrillation guidelines. Available data on using NOACs in coronary artery stenting, cardioversion, and ablation are also reviewed."

Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitors (GPI) favorably impact thrombus formation and distal embolization by inhibiting the final common pathway of platelet aggregation. Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors have been used effectively in a wide variety of clinical scenarios including unstable angina, non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction, ST segment elevation myocardial infarction, and low and high risk percutaneous coronary interventions with and without intracoronary stenting, however there is limited data regarding the use of these potent antiplatelet agents in the setting of extracardiac vascular disease.

These recommendations are extrapolated from randomized controlled prophylaxis trials not specifically conducted in cancer cohorts. Because hospitalized patients with cancer constitute a unique population with increased risk of venous thromboembolic events and major hemorrhage, validation of the efficacy and safety of primary thromboprophylaxis in this population is critical.

CD008201,0,25696871,0,Prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism in patients with cancer.,"Robust evidence remains scarce in guiding best practice in the prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism in patients living with cancer. Recommendations from major consensus guidelines are largely based on extrapolated data from trials performed mostly in noncancer patients, observational studies and registries, studies using surrogate outcomes, and underpowered randomized controlled trials. Nonetheless, a personalized approach based on individual risk assessment is uniformly recommended for inpatient and outpatient thromboprophylaxis and there is consensus that anticoagulant prophylaxis is warranted in selected patients with a high risk of thrombosis. Prediction tools for estimating the risk of thrombosis in the hospital setting have not been validated, but the use of prophylaxis in the ambulatory setting in those with a high Khorana score is under active investigation. Symptomatic and incidental thrombosis should be treated with anticoagulant therapy, but little is known about the optimal duration. Pharmacologic options for prophylaxis and treatment are still restricted to unfractionated heparin, low molecular weight heparin, and vitamin K antagonists because there is currently insufficient evidence to support the use of target-specific, non-vitamin K-antagonist oral anticoagulants. Although these agents offer practical advantages over traditional anticoagulants, potential drug interaction with chemotherapeutic agents, gastrointestinal problems, hepatic and renal impairment, and the lack of rapid reversal agents are important limitations that may reduce the efficacy and safety of these drugs in patients with active cancer. Clinicians and patients are encouraged to participate in clinical trials to advance the care of patients with cancer-associated thrombosis."

As it is unclear whether it is also effective and safe in fracture patients, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban in patients with lower limb fractures. We performed a retrospective cohort study of 2,050 consecutive patients treated for lower limb fractures at our trauma center, comparing rates of venous thromboembolism (VTE), bleeding and surgical complications, and the length of hospital stay for 608 patients who received rivaroxaban and 717 who received a low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH). Rates of symptomatic VTE were 4.9 and 8.6% in the rivaroxaban and LMWH groups, respectively (p = 0.008), and distal VTE rates were 1.8 and 5.7%, respectively (p = 0.036). The incidence of major bleeding events in the rivaroxaban group was also lower than in the LMWH group (0.2 vs 0.6%), but the difference between the groups was not statistically significant. The mean length of hospital stay was significantly shorter in the rivaroxaban group (12.2 vs 13.1 days, respectively; p = 0.016). This retrospective cohort study is the first report documenting the efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban in patients with lower extremity fractures. In comparison with LMWH, rivaroxaban reduced the incidence of VTE by 45% without increasing the risk of bleeding. However, prospective, randomized controlled trials comparing rivaroxaban and LMWH are needed to confirm our findings."
CD008201,0,23629821,0,Cancer and venous thrombosis: current comprehensions and future perspectives.,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common complication in all types of cancer and adversely impacts cancer prognosis. Randomized controlled trials with primary thromboprophylaxis in cancer patients generally show effective VTE relative risk reductions of up to 60%. However, absolute risks of VTE were fairly low. Thromboprophylaxis should therefore only be recommended to cancer patients at highest risk of VTE, who may benefit most from prophylaxis. Predictive risk models to identify patients at a high risk of VTE are promising, however additional validation is required. An increasing proportion of cancer-associated VTE is formed by incidental VTE, with similar risk factors and clinical consequences. Randomized trials are not yet available, but it seems reasonable to treat incidental VTE similarly to symptomatic VTE. In a substantial proportion of patients with unprovoked VTE without known cancer at the time of VTE diagnosis, concomitant or occult cancer is identified. Studies have investigated the value of extensive screening over routine examinations alone for occult cancer. Although extensive screening may be able to identify more occult cancers, its clinical benefit over routine screening has not been demonstrated."

CD008201,0,23086091,0,New options for anticoagulation following total hip arthroplasty and total knee arthroplasty: new oral agents on the horizon.,"Patients undergoing surgery for total hip arthroplasty (THA) or total knee arthroplasty (TKA) are at particularly high risk for developing venous thromboembolism (VTE). Despite the existence of effective therapies for VTE prevention, THA/TKA patients remain at risk for developing thrombi. Furthermore, the incidence of VTE is predicted to increase as an aging and increasingly obese population experiences joint damage necessitating THA and TKA. Current guidelines recommend the use of a wide range of antithrombotic agents in patients undergoing THA and TKA. These agents include vitamin K antagonists, low-molecular-weight heparins, fondaparinux, and the new oral anticoagulants. However, adherence to guidelines in clinical practice is disappointingly low. The limitations of traditional anticoagulants present management challenges following orthopedic surgery. Vitamin K antagonists present a number of drawbacks, including a narrow therapeutic window and unpredictable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. The subcutaneous route of administration of fondaparinux and low-molecular-weight heparins may make them unacceptable to patients in the outpatient setting. The introduction of a new generation of anticoagulants promises to address many of the drawbacks associated with the traditional agents. Clinical studies have shown the new oral anticoagulants to be as effective as traditional thromboprophylaxis, with good tolerability profiles. Clinical knowledge of these new agents will be essential to ensure that patients receive appropriate care following orthopedic surgery. This article will discuss the prevention of VTE after THA and TKA based on current evidence-based practice guidelines, the limitations of conventional anticoagulants, and the promise of new therapeutics."

Most HF patients are older adults. With the aging of the population and effective treatment of hypertension and coronary artery disease, the two major underlying causes of HF, the number of older Americans with HF is expected to rise significantly in the coming decades. HF is the number one hospital discharge diagnosis for older adults. It is one of the causes of frequent hospital readmissions, reflecting acute decompensation and compromised quality of life for patients and increased cost and resource use for the healthcare system. It is also associated with approximately 300,000 deaths annually, most in older adults. Advances in the management of HF in the past several decades have significantly decreased the mortality and morbidity associated with this condition. Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated the beneficial effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, beta-blockers, and spironolactone on survival and quality of life of HF patients, but there is evidence of underuse of evidence-based care for HF. Several national guidelines have been published since 1994 that recommended evidence-based evaluation and management of HF. In 1995, the American College of Cardiologists (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA) published their first HF guidelines that recommended left ventricular (LV) function evaluation for all patients presenting with HF and use of ACE inhibitors for all patients with LV systolic dysfunction (LVSD) unless contraindicated. The guidelines recommended the use of hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate in patients who could not use ACE inhibitors. In addition, digoxin was recommended in patients with HF due to LVSD but not adequately responsive to ACE inhibitors and diuretics and in those with atrial fibrillation and rapid ventricular rates. Diuretic use was recommended for symptomatic patients with evidence of fluid overload. Use of anticoagulation was restricted to patients with atrial fibrillation or to those with a history of systemic or pulmonary embolism. Beta-blockers were reserved for HF patients after acute myocardial infarctions. Recent advances in the management of HF called for a revision of the guidelines."

We herein report a case of post operative lymph node recurrence treated with UFT. A 74-year-old man with a huge mass lesion in the right liver with para Aortic lymph node metastasis admitted our hospital in April 2007. Extended right lobe hepatectomy and lymph node dissection were performed in May. A histological examination of the resected specimen showed a combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma with three lymph node metastasis. Computed tomography(CT)revealed intra hepatic metastasis (S3) and right adrenal grand metastasis 5 months after surgery. Transarterial embolization (TAE) and right adrenalectomy were performed for each metastasis. CT revealed a lymph node metastasis at the right side of infra vena cava 1 year after surgery. He was treated by oral administration of UFT (200 mg/day). The AFP and PIVKA-II value gradually decreased after administration of UFT. The size of lymph node metastasis became small confirmed by CT. But the AFP and PIVKA-II value increased 1 year and 7 months after surgery. TAE was performed against lymph node metastasis 1 year and 9 months after surgery. This case suggests UFT is useful for suppressing the growth of the lymph node metastasis.

CD008201,0,24215194,0,Patient selection for thromboprophylaxis in medical inpatients.,"Acutely ill medical patients may be at increased risk of venous thromboembolism, both during hospitalization and after discharge. International guidelines recommend thromboprophylaxis for high-risk medical patients with low bleeding risk for a maximum of 14 days. There are two approaches to identify the high-risk patient: adhering to the inclusion criteria used in randomized clinical trials or using risk assessment models. With both approaches, about 40% of medical inpatients should result at increased risk of venous thrombosis. However, in the real world, medical inpatients are more fragile than patients enrolled in clinical trials, and thus also require a careful assessment of the individual bleeding risk. The complex balance between risks and benefits of thromboprophylaxis has become particularly relevant in studies assessing extended prophylaxis beyond hospitalization in this setting. In the present review, we will summarize the most recent evidence on this topic."

Therefore, risk-appropriate prophylaxis is an essential component for the optimal care of inpatients and outpatients with cancer. Critical to meeting this goal is ensuring that patients get the most effective medication in the correct dose. Body weight has a significant impact on blood volume and drug clearance. Because obesity is a common health problem in industrialized societies, cancer care providers are increasingly likely to treat obese patients in their practice.

It is cleared by the kidney and should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment and avoided in patients with severe renal insufficiency. Recently, several studies have demonstrated that a lower dose of fondaparinux in patients with moderate renal impairment appears to be safe and effective. The purpose of this study was to obtain pharmacokinetic and clinical data on the use of prophylactic fondaparinux in patients with renal insufficiency undergoing major abdominal surgery for cancer (n=8) or orthopedic surgery (n=1). Anti-factor Xa levels were obtained, and a published population pharmacokinetic model for fondaparinux was fit to the data. The data were analyzed using NONMEM software. Fondaparinux did not appear to accumulate in these patients, even when the drug was administered for up to twelve days. Pharmacokinetic analysis revealed that the apparent clearance in this population, who were primarily undergoing cancer surgery, was similar to prior studies in orthopedic surgery patients. In contrast, lower estimates were obtained for volume of distribution and absorption rate constant parameters. None of the patients sustained a hemorrhagic complication attributable to fondaparinux. One patient developed hypoxia in the setting of transient atrial fibrillation and clinical suspicion for pulmonary embolism, but this was not confirmed radiographically.

Three different pilot studies commenced in 1996 at three centres in the UK. After 6 months, the protocols used were integrated into the normal care plan of the hospital. In total, 5191 patients were assessed, of whom 1347 were either venogram or Doppler ultrasound positive. Overall 1138 (82%) were treated as out-patients, 75% presenting during 'working hours'. Only 12 patients were readmitted, one with a clinically significant PE. Success was attributed to three factors: assignment of a key person as the project co-ordinator; referral of patients directly to permanent, dedicated staff, either on the Medical Admissions Unit (MAU) or the Accident and Emergency (A&E) department; and the introduction of dedicated anticoagulation nurses. In the 6-month period following initial therapy, complications were well below those in previously published studies.

Nonspecific and mild onset symptoms are the cause of delay in diagnosis, and the short hospital stay after laparoscopic approach could even contribute to the difficulty of early detection of this condition. The aim of this study was to verify if planned imaging controls are able to discover this complication leading to a prompt treatment. Thirty-eight patients (19 males and 19 females with a mean age of 24 years) who underwent laparoscopic splenectomy at our institution were studied to identify clinical signs of thrombosis of the portal venous system and eventually associated factors. All the patients were enrolled in a protocol of imaging surveillance using a doppler ultrasound method. Postoperative thrombosis of the spleno-portal axis occurred in 7 patients (18.9%) of the series. In 3 cases (8.1%) the thrombus extended from the splenic vein to occlude the portal axis. The complication was symptomatic in 4 cases (10.8%), whereas in 3 cases, the thrombosis was an ultrasonographic surprise in totally asymptomatic patients. Thrombosis occurred even as late as 2 months after splenectomy. Splenomegaly was the only significant factor predictive of thrombosis.

We asked whether the single or combined presence of thrombophilic genetic polymorphisms might further increase the already high risk for venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism (PE) after THA. We therefore compared the prevalence of factor V Leiden, prothrombin G20210A, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T and A1298C, and plasminogen activator inhibitor 4G/5G polymorphisms between 50 patients with symptomatic DVT within 3 weeks after elective THA and an asymptomatic control group of 85 patients. We found no major difference for the presence of a single mutation between the groups. Factor V Leiden and homozygous MTHFR C667T mutations were of borderline significance with odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) of 3.73 (0.89-15.63) and 2.93 (0.92-9.29), respectively. Patients with homozygous or combined heterozygous status of MTHFR C677T and A1298C mutation had a higher frequency of DVT after elective THA (odds ratio, 2.86; 95% confidence interval, 1.32-6.35) than those with wild-type. The presence of a single mutation may not further increase the already high risk for symptomatic DVT after THA, whereas combinations of mutations of distinct polymorphisms might be important. However, prospective studies with a larger number of patients are needed before we would recommend preoperative screening."
CD008201,0,6122342,0,[Results of surgical treatment of rupture of the Achilles tendon (author's transl)].,"32 ruptures of the achilles tendon were treated surgically in the surgical department of the St. Katharinen-Hospital during the period 1. 1. 1975 to 1. 3. 1980. These cases comprised 28 subcutaneous complete ruptures and 4 open tendon injuries. 29 fresh and 3 old ruptures were operated. The article describes the surgical technique. The median, arcuate incision, the end-to-end suture according to Bunnell with Dexon and, if possible, an interlacing suture with the plantaris tendon, appear to be the essential measures. This is followed by immobilization in a plaster case for a period of 6 weeks. The patients remained hospitalized for a period of 2 weeks after the operation; they were unable to work for 10 weeks, and unable to actively participate in sports for 19 weeks. Half a year to 5 years after the operation, 25 patients were subjected to follow-up examinations. No early or late infection had occurred, and there was also no rerupture or thrombosis. There was also no adherence to tendon and skin. Using the assessment scheme according to B.G. Weber, the functional result must be classified as ""good"" with all patients."

Although half of thromboembolic events occur during times of low-risk situations, almost all our knowledge is focused on medical thromboprophylaxis during high-risk situations. Thus, since we only use medical thromboprophylaxis at high-risk periods, lifestyle advice could be an attractive complement both during high- and low-risk situations. The knowledge of how lifestyle factors affect VTE risk has grown in recent years, and women at high risk are often highly motivated to make changes in order to reduce their risk. This review is focused on modifiable risk factors for VTE and advice that may be given to women at increased risk of VTE."

CD008201,0,21124276,0,Impact of stent design on the outcome of intervention for carotid bifurcation stenosis.,"Over the past several years, there has been continued significant interest in refinement of patient selection, devices, procedures and protocols in an effort to optimize the outcome of percutaneous intervention for carotid bifurcation stenosis, including: ongoing National Institutes of Health and manufacturer trials and registries; the further refinement of existing devices and emergence of new platforms to attain distal embolic protection; ongoing study of what really constitutes a high-risk carotid surgery or stenting patient; and attention to device characteristics and patient-device matching. Within the latter area, considerable interest has focused on stent characteristics that have the potential to impact short and long-term outcome when compared with other stent design strategies when studied in large series. The stent in carotid artery intervention occupies a unique role in that after the embolic protection system has been removed, it is the main line of defense (in concert with aggressive dual antiplatelet therapy) from embolic and thromboembolic complications that may arise from the newly remodeled plaque after post-stent angioplasty. In this review, we aim to update the current status of efforts to relate stent design strategy to outcome in intervention for extracranial carotid artery disease with a focus primarily on the function of ""free cell area"" (typically lower with closed-cell stents and higher with open-cell stents) in analyses of outcome in carotid artery stenting. Also, the potential role of closed-cell vs. open-cell stent selection in other reports related to carotid artery stenting outcome or complications is reviewed. Rigorous studies have examined the issue of free cell area and arrived at disparate conclusions. Randomized data on the impact of free cell area and cell design strategy on carotid intervention are presently lacking. However, we believe sufficient data and rationale exist 1) to warrant ongoing study of the impact of stent design on outcome in carotid intervention; and 2) to make consideration of closed-cell (low free cell area) stent use a reasonable approach to device selection--when patient factors, lesion characteristics, or device availability make doing so possible."

Data from the ATAC adjuvant trial indicate that the aromatase inhibitor anastrozole is more effective than tamoxifen in reducing recurrence and preventing new contralateral tumours, and also has a more favourable side-effect profile. This has led us to launch a new prevention trial--IBIS-II--in 6,000 high-risk postmenopausal women comparing anastrozole against placebo. A parallel trial will compare anastrozole against tamoxifen in 4,000 women with locally excised DCIS."

CD008201,0,11085769,0,Implementation of antithrombotic management in atrial fibrillation.,"The aim of the study was to assess the extent to which published recommendations on the antithrombotic management of atrial fibrillation had been adopted into clinical practice in a busy district general hospital, and the impact of clinical audit on subsequent management. In the initial audit, 185 consecutive patients with atrial fibrillation were studied using their case notes to identify any further clinical risk factors for stroke. A management algorithm stratified patients with atrial fibrillation into high, moderate, or low risk of stroke according to the individual stroke risk factors. For patients at high risk, the correct treatment is warfarin unless there are specific contraindications. For patients at moderate risk, the correct management is aspirin unless there are specific contraindications. Patients at low risk should receive no thromboprophylaxis. The clinical risks of stroke and thromboprophylaxis on discharge from hospital were recorded. An extensive education programme on stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation was undertaken. Six months later a further 185 consecutive patients with atrial fibrillation were audited. Overall, a large proportion (306/370; 83%) of patients were at high risk of stroke. In the initial audit, antithrombotic management was correct in 89 patients (48%). In the follow up audit, antithrombotic management was correct in 135 patients (73%) (p < 0. 00001). If this improvement in management were extrapolated to all hospital patients in the United Kingdom, approximately 1400 strokes/year could be avoided. Despite broad consensus in recent publications, antithrombotic management of atrial fibrillation remains imperfect, with many patients exposed to unnecessarily high risk of stroke."

CD008201,0,15139843,0,Achieving better in-hospital and after-hospital care of patients with acute cardiac disease.,"In patients hospitalised with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) and congestive heart failure (CHF), evidence suggests opportunities for improving in-hospital and after-hospital care, patient self-care, and hospital-community integration. A multidisciplinary quality improvement program was designed and instigated in Brisbane in October 2000 involving 250 clinicians at three teaching hospitals, 1080 general practitioners (GPs) from five Divisions of General Practice, 1594 patients with ACS and 904 patients with CHF. Quality improvement interventions were implemented over 17 months after a 6-month baseline period and included: clinical decision support (clinical practice guidelines, reminders, checklists, clinical pathways); educational interventions (seminars, academic detailing); regular performance feedback; patient self-management strategies; and hospital-community integration (discharge referral summaries; community pharmacist liaison; patient prompts to attend GPs). Using a before-after study design to assess program impact, significantly more program patients compared with historical controls received: ACS: Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and lipid-lowering agents at discharge, aspirin and beta-blockers at 3 months after discharge, inpatient cardiac counselling, and referral to outpatient cardiac rehabilitation. CHF: Assessment for reversible precipitants, use of prophylaxis for deep-venous thrombosis, beta-blockers at discharge, ACE inhibitors at 6 months after discharge, imaging of left ventricular function, and optimal management of blood pressure levels. Risk-adjusted mortality rates at 6 and 12 months decreased, respectively, from 9.8% to 7.4% (P = 0.06) and from 13.4% to 10.1% (P = 0.06) for patients with ACS and from 22.8% to 15.2% (P < 0.001) and from 32.8% to 22.4% (P = 0.005) for patients with CHF. Quality improvement programs that feature multifaceted interventions across the continuum of care can change clinical culture, optimise care and improve clinical outcomes."
CD008201,0,19704060,0,Prevention of venous thromboembolism in hospitalized patients with cancer.,"This is a literature review of the frequency of venous thromboembolism in hospitalized patients with cancer and of the available evidence supporting the use of thromboprophylaxis. Patients with cancer are at particularly high risk of venous thromboembolism and account for almost 20% of patients in the population. Hospitalization is an important risk factor in patients with cancer, with rates reported between 0.6% and 7.8%. The incidence has been increasing over the past decade. Three randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses indicate that prophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin, heparin, or fondaparinux significantly reduces the rate of venous thromboembolism in hospitalized medical patients who are at high risk. Patients with cancer were included in these studies, but prospective trials specifically focused on patients with cancer are not available. Evidence indicates that appropriate thromboprophylaxis is provided to a minority of hospitalized patients with cancer and that targeted educational efforts and computerized prompt systems can increase appropriate use. Guidelines developed by both oncology and thrombosis organizations support the use of thromboprophylaxis in hospitalized patients with cancer. In conclusion, most patients hospitalized with cancer are at high risk of venous thromboembolism, and thromboprophylaxis should be provided in the absence of active bleeding or a high bleeding risk."

CD008201,0,17218586,0,Risk of thrombosis with lenalidomide and its prevention with aspirin.,"Lenalidomide, an analog of thalidomide, is an effective new treatment for multiple myeloma. Both compounds are associated with an increased risk of venous thromboembolism, particularly when used in combination with high-dose dexamethasone. As new trials with lenalidomide are being planned and performed, investigators are placing high importance on reducing the risk of thrombosis by incorporating an antithrombotic agent into the therapeutic regimen. Low-molecular-weight heparin, warfarin, and aspirin have all been suggested as candidate drugs for thromboprophylaxis, but none of these agents have been evaluated in randomized clinical trials. A body of opinion has evolved that aspirin is very effective in preventing venous thrombosis in myeloma patients treated with lenalidomide. If correct, this view has important implications, because aspirin is inexpensive and is safer and more convenient than anticoagulants. On the other hand, aspirin is less effective than anticoagulants for preventing venous thrombosis in other high-risk groups, and therefore might not be the most appropriate choice for preventing of venous thrombosis in myeloma patients. This commentary examines the strength of the evidence supporting the effectiveness of aspirin in preventing venous thrombosis in multiple myeloma patients treated with lenalidomide. It is concluded that the evidence that aspirin is efficacious in preventing venous thrombosis in myeloma patients is based on ""before/after"" and retrospective studies, with potential for bias and confounders. There is, therefore, a critical need to incorporate a randomized comparison of aspirin with an anticoagulant in future trials evaluating lenalidomide in multiple myeloma."
CD008201,0,12934740,0,Improvements in the prevention of postoperative venous thromboembolism in hip fracture patients.,"Hip fracture surgery carries a high risk of venous thromboembolism and, until recently, was poorly investigated. The efficacy and safety of fondaparinux, a new synthetic antithrombotic, were investigated in two large, thromboprophylaxis studies. Results of the Penthifra study, which was a randomized, double-blind phase III trial, showed that 1 week of fondaparinux, compared with enoxaparin, significantly reduced venous thromboembolic events from 19.1% to 8.3% (relative risk reduction: 56.4%; P<.001) without increasing bleeding risk. Penthifra Plus results showed that extending fondaparinux prophylaxis from 1 to 4 weeks was well tolerated and, compared to placebo, significantly reduced delayed venous thromboembolism events from 35% to 1.4% (relative risk reduction: 95.9%; P<.001). Based on these findings, 4-week fondaparinux treatment may become the standard thromboprophylaxis after hip fracture surgery."

Numerous studies have found that acetylsalicylic acid is effective in reducing the incidence of (recurrent) acute vascular events, such as myocardial infarction or ischaemic stroke. For coronary atherothrombosis, anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists was shown to be slightly superior to acetylsalicylic acid in high-risk patients. Two major trials, the 'Stroke prevention in reversible ischemia trial' (SPIRIT) and the 'European/Australasian stroke prevention in reversible ischaemia trial' (ESPRIT), showed that vitamin K antagonists were more effective than placebo in the prevention of ischaemic stroke, but the favourable effect was completely offset by a higher incidence of major bleeding (including intracerebral bleeding) in patients using vitamin K antagonists.

CD008201,0,6344268,0,The antithrombic drugs in clinical practice.,"The rational use of antithrombic drugs centres on the fundamental differences in the pathogenesis of arterial or venous thrombosis. The major role of platelets in the development of occlusion in arteries contrasts with prominent fibrin deposition in the slower moving venous blood. Logically, antiplatelet agents are used to treat patients at high risk from arterial disease and anticoagulants for those with venous thrombo-embolism. These sound theoretical principles have been linked to steady improvement in diagnostic techniques, and there now exists an extensive literature on available drugs and their clinical evaluation. It is therefore surprising how little agreement exists on the practical use of the antithrombic drugs. In patients with coronary artery disease, secondary prevention of myocardial infarction is favourably influenced by administration of aspirin, dipyridamole or sulphinpyrazone. However, differences are not statistically significant so that confident recommendations for their use cannot yet be made. In mitral valve disease, anticoagulants are effective in reducing systemic thrombo-embolism; in patients with cardiac prostheses, dipyridamole should be added. In the cerebral circulation, vertebrobasilar and carotid ischaemia need to be distinguished and suitable lesions surgically corrected. Patients not undergoing endarterectomy are divided into two groups. In those with symptoms stable for more than 3 months, aspirin alone is sufficient; patients with recent deterioration or a shorter history are best treated with conventional anticoagulants followed by the addition of aspirin. In venous thrombo-embolic disease, heparin prophylaxis should be combined with reversal of identifiable risk factors. In treating the acute event, anticoagulation, with or without preceding thrombolytic therapy, is preferred. In addition, the clinician must select an antithrombic regimen o take into account the possibility of drug interaction, the need for and feasibility of laboratory monitoring, and the total number of medicines prescribed for the patient. Failure to restrict tablets to manageable numbers will lead to poor compliance and unpredictable therapeutic response."

This narrative review article presents the rate, clinical consequences, and optimal strategies to prevent VTE in critically ill patients, focusing primarily on medical-surgical intensive care unit (ICU) patients, but also addressing other specific subgroups of critically ill patients. Despite the large number of medical-surgical ICU patients, their moderately high risk of VTE, and the morbidity and mortality likely to be associated with the development of VTE, relatively little methodologically rigorous data are available to guide practice.

It is known that, besides dislodgement of pre-existing intra-atrial thrombi, the ""stunned"" atrium after CV is an important cause of thrombus formation and subsequent embolism. We investigated whether CV of AF is associated with occurrence of circulating microemboli (ME) representing a sensitive marker of the actual thromboembolic activity. Twenty-nine patients (22 men) aged 54 +/- 13 years suffering from valvular (n = 5) or nonvalvular (n = 24) AF were studied. All but 1 patient (with recent-onset AF) had been put on oral anticoagulation (INR >2.0) for at least 3 weeks before and 4 weeks after successful CV. In all patients, exclusion of internal carotid artery stenosis and atrial thrombus was performed prior to CV. Five unilateral 1-hour transcranial Doppler ME monitorings over the middle cerebral artery were performed (1) before CV, and (2) immediately, (3) 4-6 h, (4) 24 h, and (5) 2-4 weeks after CV. Total absence of circulating ME was found before CV as well as during a cumulative monitoring time of 115 h after successful CV. Electrical CV of AF after at least 3 weeks of effective anticoagulation is not associated with occurrence of cerebral circulating ME. This finding requires further investigation including high-risk patients with AF undergoing CV based on different treatment protocols."
CD008201,0,20423535,0,Adequate thromboprophylaxis in critically ill patients.,Venous thromboembolism is a relatively frequently occurring complication in critically ill patients admitted to the ICU despite prophylactic treatment with subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin. Several studies show that critically ill patients have significantly lower plasma anti-factor-Xa activity levels compared to control patients after administration of subcutaneous heparin. Robinson and colleagues show in this issue of Critical Care dose-dependent but relatively low levels of anti-factor Xa activity at increasing doses of enoxaparin. Anti-factor Xa levels thought to be required for adequate thromboprophylaxis are observed only at doses of enoxaparin that are one and a half times higher than the conventional dose (40 mg).
CD008201,0,17473570,0,Low-molecular weight heparin for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis in hospitalized medical patients: results from a cost-effectiveness analysis.,"Multiple options exist for the prevention of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in medical inpatients. We sought to determine the cost-effectiveness of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) relative to unfractionated heparin (UFH) for DVT prevention in this setting. We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis from the perspective of a third-party payer employing a decision model and literature-based estimates for inputs. In the base-case analysis, LMWH had little impact on the rate of DVT. Despite higher acquisition costs, however, LMWHs resulted in net savings. Routine use of LMWH saves approximately US$89 per patient. The lower rate of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) with LMWH accounted for this differential. Univariate sensitivity analysis revealed the model was moderately sensitive to the odds ratio of HIT with LMWH and the cost of HIT. Multivariate sensitivity analysis confirmed the LMWH approach dominated financially. 'Worst-case' scenario modeling, where LMWH actually increased the risk for DVT, had little effect on the rate of HIT, and was substantially more costly than UFH, still demonstrated that LMWHs were economically superior. Monte-Carlo simulation indicated the 95% confidence interval around the estimate for savings with LMWH ranged from US$7 to US$373. We conclude that, despite their higher cost, LMWHs for thromboprophylaxis in medical patients result in savings."
CD008201,0,10549722,0,Long term outpatient prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism.,"Recent reductions in the incidence of postoperative venous thromboembolism are related to the widespread use of prophylactic anticoagulants, but many uncertainties about the most effective ways to use thromboprophylaxis remain. Orthopedic patients are at high risk of thromboembolism, and the trend towards shorter hospital stays means that they may receive less than the recommended 7 to 10 days of prophylaxis. Longer periods of thromboprophylaxis may be beneficial for high risk patients. The relative rarity of symptomatic deep-vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism means that very large patient populations are required for studies that rely on clinical endpoints, but studies using venographic endpoints have shown 30 days of prophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) to be more effective than 7 days. Other factors that may influence the efficacy of thromboprophylaxis include the timing of the first injection and the choice of agent."

CD008201,0,25982217,0,Chemical prophylaxis to prevent venous thromboembolism in morbid obesity: literature review and dosing recommendations.,"Pharmacologic prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis and venous thromboembolism (VTE) is an important aspect of medical care, particularly in the inpatient setting. Low-molecular weight heparins, heparin, and fondaparinux are commonly used agents to prevent VTE, each of which has well established dosing regimens in patients with normal body mass index. Dosing of these medications in morbidly obese populations (BMI > 40 kg/m(2)) is not as clearly defined in guidelines. This article reviews published data to support specific dosing regimens and monitoring strategies of these agents in this population. The most validated parenteral agent to prevent VTE in morbidly obese hospitalized patients is enoxaparin, dosed at 40 mg subcutaneously (SC) twice daily. If unfractionated heparin is utilized for prophylaxis in morbidly obese patients, a dose of 7500 units SC three times daily should be considered. Monitoring of anti-factor Xa levels to guide prophylactic dosing is an option, although the utility of this lab test is limited, as target anti-Xa ranges for VTE prophylaxis have not been universally defined and trials have not shown a clear link between anti-factor Xa levels and bleeding or thrombotic events. Additional studies are needed to clearly define the most appropriate dosing strategies in patients with moderate obesity (BMI 35-40 mg/m(2)) and those with extreme obesity (BMI > 60 mg/m(2))."
CD008201,0,16638456,0,Low-molecular-weight heparins in the treatment of cancer-associated thrombosis: a new standard of care?,"Cancer patients are twice as likely to develop postoperative venous thromboembolism (VTE) than non-cancer patients undergoing the same surgical procedure. Causes of cancer-associated thrombosis include: the capacity of tumor cells and their products to interact with platelets, clotting, and fibrinolytic proteins. Aggressive antitumor therapy with agents such as platinum compounds, high-dose fluorouracil, mitomycin-C, tamoxifen, and growth factors increase the risk of cancer-associated thrombosis. Despite the high risk of VTE in patients with cancer, thromboprophylaxis in surgical and medical oncology patients is low. Initial therapy of VTE in patients with cancer is low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) or unfractionated heparin. Long-term secondary prophylaxis of VTE is generally accomplished with oral anticoagulants, primarily warfarin. Evidence supports the use of LMWH for prevention and treatment of cancer-associated thrombosis because it is more easily administered, does not require laboratory monitoring, has a lower risk of adverse events, and is more cost effective than unfractionated heparin. In addition, the antineoplastic effects of LMWH have been demonstrated, including direct antitumor, antiangiogenic, and immune system modulatory action. Each LMWH is a unique biological entity having product-specific molecular and structural attributes; therefore, different LMWHs cannot be given interchangeably. Continued investigation of LMWH therapy in patients with cancer is warranted."
CD008201,0,12728784,0,[Breakthrough in breast cancer chemoprevention].,"Breast cancer is the most frequent female malignant disease in developed countries. Various approaches are being developed for breast cancer prevention. Medical prevention called chemoprevention is reviewed. Prior to any intervention estimation of breast cancer risk is mandatory. For practical reasons distinction of two risk groups is useful. In the high risk group inherited gene mutation showing high penetrance may be suspected, while in the medium risk group hormonal factors play an important role. The antiestrogen tamoxifen has been extensively investigated in breast cancer and also tested for the prevention of breast cancer. The results of four randomized tamoxifen prevention studies have been published. In the largest, American trial the number of invasive or ""in situ"" breast cancers was halved by tamoxifen. Particularly estrogen receptor positive and relatively good prognosis breast cancers were reduced. Similar results were obtained in the ""International Breast Intervention Study"". Tamoxifen has been registered for breast cancer prevention for high risk individuals in the United States. The Italian and English (""Royal Marsden Hospital"") studies did not prove significant preventative effect for tamoxifen that may be explained by the characteristics of the study protocols and study populations. Increased rates of endometrial cancer, thromboembolic events and cataract were observed under tamoxifen treatment, especially over the age of 50. Prevention has an increased importance in gene mutation carriers. Besides prophylactic mastectomy and close surveillance tamoxifen and bilateral oophorectomy or the use of gonadotropin releasing-hormone analogs seem efficient in this group. Various new chemoprevention strategies are under testing. Raloxifene and the aromatase inhibitors show advantage in menopausal women, the retinoid fenretinide and the gonadotropin releasing-hormone analogs seem promising for premenopausal individuals. The use of these agents are investigated in clinical trials. It is likely that not one single method will be applied for breast cancer prevention in the future. Preferably individual prevention strategies based on individual risk assessment will be developed."
CD008201,0,20944949,0,"[Recommendations for the management of pulmonary thromboembolism, 2010].","Pulmonary thromboembolism and deep vein thrombosis together constitute a condition designated venous thromboembolism. Despite the advances, the morbidity and the mortality attributed to this condition are still high, because the patients present with more complex diseases, are submitted to a greater number of invasive procedures and survive longer. Although there are various international guidelines available, we decided to write these recommendations for their application in medical practice in Brazil. These recommendations are based on the best evidence in the literature and the opinion of the advisory committee. This document is only a tool for use in the management of patients. Although the recommendations it contains can be applied to most situations, physicians should adapt its content depending on their local context and on a case-by-case basis. Pulmonary thromboembolism is diagnosed by evaluating pre-test clinical probability (scores) together with the results of imaging studies, the current method of choice being CT angiography. Stratification of the risk for an unfavorable outcome is fundamental. Hemodynamic instability is the most important predictor. Low-risk patients should be treated with heparin, commonly low-molecular-weight heparins. High-risk patients require intensive monitoring and, in some cases, thrombolytic therapy. In the long term, patients should receive anticoagulants for at least three months. The decision to prolong this treatment is made based on the presence of risk factors for the recurrence of the condition and the probability of bleeding. Prophylaxis is highly effective and should be widely used in clinical and surgical patients alike, according to their risk group. Finally, we include recommendations regarding the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary thromboembolism."

Orthopedic surgery is a major surgical risk factor for VTE, but the problem is more important for patients with hip and knee joint replacement, multiple traumatisms, severe damage to the spine, or large fractures. Thromboprophylaxis is defined as the strategy and actions necessary to diminish the risk of VTE in high-risk orthopedic surgery. Antithrombotics may prevent VTE. At the end of this paper, we describe a proposal of thromboprophylaxis actions for patients requiring high-risk orthopedic surgery, based on the opinion of specialists in Orthopedics and Traumatology who work with high-risk orthopedic surgery patients. A search for evidence about this kind of surgery was performed and a 100-item inquiring instrument was done in order to know the opinions of the participants.

A collective term, VTE is used to describe a blood clot that develops inside the vasculature and results in a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and/or a pulmonary embolism (PE). Deep vein thrombosis and PE are the third leading cause of cardiovascular mortality, superseded only by myocardial infarction and stroke. Patients who receive treatment for acute PE are 4 times more likely to die of a recurrent VTE within the next year. In hospitalized patients who have had surgery, the incidence of VTE and PE is estimated to be 100 times more prevalent than in the general population. The Joint Commission has established Surgical Care Improvement Project measures to address prophylactic interventions to minimize the incidence of VTE. This journal course will review the current approaches to pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic prevention and management of VTE during the perioperative period. Identification and treatment of deep vein thrombosis and acute PE are also described."
CD008201,0,26306127,0,The Left Atrial Appendage: Target for Stroke Reduction in Atrial Fibrillation.,"A patient with atrial fibrillation (AF) has a greater than 5% annual risk of major stroke, a 5-fold increase compared to the general population. While anticoagulation remains the standard stroke prevention strategy, the nature of lifelong anticoagulation inevitably carries an increased risk of bleeding, increased stroke during periods of interruption, increased cost, and significant lifestyle modification. Many patients with atrial fibrillation have had their left atrial appendage (LAA) ligated or excised by surgeons during cardiac surgery, a decision based largely on intuition and with no clear evidence of efficacy in stroke risk reduction. The observation that 90% of the thrombi found in nonvalvular AF patients and 57% found in valvular AF are in the LAA, triggered significant interest in the LAA as a potential therapeutic target. Until recently, the results were inconsistent, and high rates of incomplete occlusions precluded the medical community from confirming a definite relationship between LAA and stroke. As a result, anticoagulation is still the recommended first-line stroke risk reduction in AF, and the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines recommend LAA exclusion only with surgical ablation of AF or in the context of concomitant mitral valve surgery. A handful of devices have been developed for LAA exclusion. This includes percutaneous options such as WATCHMAN™ Left Atrial Appendage Closure Device (Boston Scientific Corporation, Marlborough, MA), hybrid epicardial devices such as the LARIAT Suture Delivery Device (SentreHEART, Inc., Redwood City, CA), and epicardial surgical devices such as AtriClip® LAA Occlusion System (AtriCure, Inc., West Chester, OH). Studies of the Watchman device have shown noninferiority to Warfarin in stroke prevention and this device has recently gained approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) following lengthy delays due to safety concerns. The Lariat device, which received 510K clearance by the FDA for tissue approximation but not LAA exclusion, has been the target of significant criticism due to serious procedural safety concerns and high incomplete closure rates. The surgical AtriClip has been FDA approved since 2009 and is currently the most widely used LAA exclusion device placed through an epicardial approach. Small studies have shown excellent reliability and success of complete LAA closure with the AtriClip device, which is implanted through an epicardial approach. Currently, we are conducting a multicenter trial to demonstrate the stroke prevention potential of this epicardial device through a short (45 minute), stand-alone, minimally invasive procedure in lieu of lifelong anticoagulation in patients at high risk of bleeding."

Sixteen published studies with evaluable efficacy and/or safety data were identified. For patients with prosthetic heart valves at high risk of thromboembolism, combined warfarin and ASA therapy may be beneficial compared with warfarin alone. Combination therapy may also be used for primary prevention in patients at high risk for ischemic heart disease, although the expected benefits are small. Evidence does not support the use of combined antithrombotic therapy in patients with established ischemic heart disease, ischemic stroke, coronary artery bypass grafts or atrial fibrillation. Combination therapy is associated with an increased risk of minor and major bleeding. The highest dose of ASA that can be recommended in combination with warfarin is 100 mg daily."
CD008201,0,16964988,0,Management of venous thromboembolism in the elderly.,"In this review the authors discuss the use of oral and parenteral anticoagulants for the prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in the elderly. The use of anticoagulant agents in VTE prophylaxis and treatment in the elderly is complicated by an increase with age in the presence of multiple risk factors and co-morbidities that may increase the risk of both VTE and bleeding. Age itself is identified as an independent risk factor for thromboembolism. VTE is underdiagnosed in the elderly population, and routine prophylaxis frequently falls short of the levels required according to level of risk. Although appropriate anticoagulation of at-risk patients offers a means of reducing the significant VTE burden in this population, concerns have been raised over the use of anticoagulants in a patient group in whom multiple risk factors are common. Bleeding in the elderly can be exacerbated by reduced renal clearance and hypersensitivity to oral anticoagulants that may lead to over-anticoagulation. Although bleeding due to anticoagulant therapy is a serious issue in the elderly, it is often overemphasized, given the therapeutic value otherwise observed in treating this patient group. Warfarin is still used in VTE prophylaxis after orthopaedic surgery and for long-term VTE treatment. Unfractionated and low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs) have been shown to be safe and effective in the prophylaxis of VTE, and are now being shown to be as effective as warfarin in the initial and long-term treatment of VTE. LMWHs confer the advantage over unfractionated heparin of subcutaneous once-daily administration with no requirement for laboratory monitoring of their anticoagulant effect, which allows for the convenience of outpatient therapy. New anticoagulants that may be of potential benefit in this patient population include fondaparinux sodium, but clinical experience of this drug in the elderly remains limited."

The original laboratory criteria of APS included lupus anticoagulants (LA) and/or IgG/IgM anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL). They were recently updated with the addition of IgG/IgM anti-beta2 glycoprotein I antibodies (anti-beta2GPI), a better definition of ""medium to high antibody titer,"" and the extension to 12 weeks of the ""persistence in time."" The revised criteria represent an improvement; however, the potential overdiagnosis of APS remains possible, thus putting patients at risk of overtreatment. To reduce this possibility, proposals have been made to implement strict guidelines for the performance of the LA assay, to exclude aCL measurements in their current application from the criteria, and to limit the measurement of anti-beta2GPI to the G isotype. This should also help in simplifying the laboratory workup of patients being investigated for APS."

Medical treatment was reviewed with respect to administration, indications, and contraindications of specific drugs. Sixty-nine percent of patients received suboptimal treatment with respect to aspirin and beta blockers, which was almost always due to undertreatment rather than overprescription. Only 23% of patients with mural thrombi, as shown by echocardiography and without contraindications to anticoagulants, received coumadin. Patients hospitalized in the Intensive Coronary Care Unit received somewhat better medical care with regard to aspirin, beta blockers and coumadin. Appropriate decisions whether to give or withhold thrombolytic therapy were made in 81% of the cases and it was given to 29% of the patients. We conclude that during the period of this study there was a considerable gap between: a) recommendations in the medical literature, and b) the quality of care provided to AMI patients with regard to medications prescribed by physicians for preventive medical therapy."
CD008201,0,17918633,0,[Acute massive pulmonary embolism].,"To establish the diagnosis of the acute massive pulmonary embolism is critically urgent for the doctors, because the life saving causal therapy should be introduced as soon as possible. The combined use of the estimated clinical probability and the results of one or more noninvasive examinations increase the accuracy in confirming the diagnosis of embolism. The most important methods to confirm or rule out the suspicion of pulmonary embolism are the noninvasive perfusion pulmonary isotopic scanning, spiral CT, echocardiography and the invasive ""gold standard"" pulmonary angiography. The life saving causal therapy means the urgent recanalization of the obstructed pulmonary arteries. The surgical embolectomy is a high risk intervention, but the invasive radiological methods are also capable of destroying the emboli mechanically and very effectively. The different thrombolytic treatment methods mean causal therapy too, and these protocols can be used in every hospital. There is no alternative treatment in patients with sudden clinical death caused by acute pulmonary embolism: the drug administration during reanimation should be completed with thrombolysis."

Following the ENDORSE study achieved five years before with a similar protocol, PROMET included 435hospitalized patients (229 in medical units and 206 in surgical units). Compared to the ENDORSE results, the PROMET data reflect progress in the management of venous thromboembolism: 73.3% of at-risk patients received prophylaxis (57.6% of medical patients and 90.8% of surgical patients). In 93.1% of cases, this prophylaxis was provided by a low molecular weight heparin, mainly at the dose of one injection per day. In medical population, the prescription was triggered by long-term immobilization (P=0.01; OR=5.8 95%CI [1.5-23.0]), associated risk factors (P=0.025; OR=4.13 [1.2-14.2]) and the cause of hospitalization (P=0.056). In surgical departments, the therapeutic decision depended on the nature of the surgical intervention and was influenced by the presence of a contraindication for prophylaxis (P<0.001; OR=0.02 [0.00-0.14]) or a high hemorrhagic risk (P<0.001; OR=0.02). The assessment and management of thromboembolic risk were in accordance with ACCP recommendations for surgical patients. However efforts are needed for medical patients for whom the risk is underestimated and insufficiently supported. Unlike surgery where procedures are well established, there are real difficulties in medicine to define the at-risk patients who will benefit from thromboprophylaxis.

As a VTE prediction model for Asians is still lacking, this study aimed to identify very high risk patients who would be the main target for prevention. In 2009, medical patients admitted to King Chulalongkorn Memorial hospital, a tertiary care centre, were prospectively evaluated for risk factors. The high-risk cohort was monitored for symptomatic VTE until six weeks after discharge. No heparin prophylaxis was given. Of 1,290 high-risk patients, 27 (2.1%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3-2.9) developed proven VTE, 25.9% of which were diagnosed after discharge. Cases with VTE stayed longer in the hospital (median 18 vs. 11 days, p < 0.001). The significant risk factors in a multivariate analysis were autoimmune disease, solid tumours, family history of VTE, varicose vein and oestrogen with the relative risks of 11.8, 4.7, 120.3, 40.1 and 17.1 (p < 0.001, 0.001, 0.001, 0.002 and 0.038), respectively. Either autoimmune disease or solid tumours were found in 63% of VTE with the relative risk of 4.5 (95% CI 2.1-9.7, p < 0.001). In contrast, previously reported VTE scores in western patients could not stratify the VTE risks, but all the scores predicted higher mortality. In conclusion, VTE is common in Asian hospitalised medical patients. Patients with autoimmune disease and those with solid tumours are highly susceptible to VTE. A prophylactic strategy in these groups is required."

Among 4467 patients, 28.99% of the patients (n = 1295) were admitted with cancer, 18.03% (n = 805) with pneumonia, 14.06% (n = 628) with heart failure, 11.06% (n = 494) with stroke, 11.11% (n = 496) with sepsis, 8.08% (n = 361) with infectious diseases, 5.6% (n = 250) with severe respiratory disorders, 1.81% (n = 81) with inflammatory bowel disease, 1.05% (n = 47) with obesity, 0.20% (n = 9) with neurologic disorders, and 0.02% (n = 1) with acute rheumatic fever. Among those with 180-day continuous enrollment after the index date (n = 3511), 51.81% (n = 1819) received anticoagulant therapy only, 2.48% (n = 87) received mechanical compression treatment only (stocking or pneumatic compression), and 4.41% (n = 155) received both during hospitalization. Anticoagulant therapy rates ranged from 88.64% (obesity) to 32.39% (inflammatory bowel disease). Among anticoagulant therapy patients, 740 patients (40.68%) received low-molecular weight heparin only and 806 patients (44.31%) received unfractionated heparin. After risk adjustment, compared with patients without VTE prophylaxis, anticoagulant prophylaxis patients had lower VTE (3.62% vs. 4.27%, P < 0.04) and readmission rates (24.22% vs. 27.95%, P < 0.02) during the 6 months post-index hospital admission. In conclusion anticoagulant prophylaxis is underutilized and is associated with reduced VTE risk and a decrease in rehospitalizations for medically ill patients."

CD008201,0,7818207,0,[Anesthesia for laparoscopic surgery in pediatrics].,"The increasing use of laparoscopic surgery in children is associated with the enlargement of the spectrum of indications to appendicectomy, extramucosal pylorotomy and cure of oesophageal reflux. It is also linked with new problems, mainly due to physiologic modifications elicited by pneumoperitoneum and patient's posture. Although sufficient data are not yet available, the respiratory and cardiovascular modifications are probably similar to those occurring in adults, at least in children more than 4-month-old, as long as the intra-abdominal pressure remains under 15 mmHg. The use of higher intra-abdominal pressures has not been reported in children. In this case, the cardiovascular changes consist mainly in an increase in arterial pressure. In some children, non specific decreases in heart rate and in blood pressure can be observed. The latter can be elicited by a surgical complication, hypovolaemia, head-elevated position or deep anaesthesia. In the newborn and infant under 6 months, intra-abdominal pressures of 15 mmHg or more carry a risk of low cardiac output due to a decrease in contractility and compliance of the left ventricle. In this group of age it is therefore recommended to establish a pressure not higher than 6 mmHg. Moreover, in these very young children, the risk for reopening of the right-left shunts can result in heart insufficiency and systemic gas embolism. Peroperative respiratory changes include an increase in PetCO2 and more rarely a decrease in SaO2. The interpretation of the former depends on the site of gas sampling in the anaesthetic system. It is easily controlled by an increased minute ventilation. Various causes, such as bronchial intubation, inhalation of gastric contents or gas embolism, can decrease SaO2. Contra-indications for laparoscopic surgery include hypovolaemia, heart diseases, increased intracranial pressure and alveolar distension. Therefore newborns are patients at high risk in so far as their foramen ovale or their ductus arteriosus is patent, the pulmonary arterial resistances remain increased and a bronchodysplasia is existing. In some cases a special disease is often associated. As an example recurrent bronchitis or asthma is associated with an oesophageal reflux and a sickle-cell disease in patients with cholelithiasis. These patients require special pre-, per- and postoperative care for prevention of complications. Anaesthesia for laparoscopic surgery does not require a major extension of the usual security regulations. Special attention must be paid to arterial pressure. Therefore end-expiratory concentration of the halogenated anaesthetic agent should not be kept higher than 1.5 times the MAC related to the age during maintenance of anaesthesia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
CD008201,0,24456320,0,Analysis of gastrointestinal prophylaxis in patients receiving dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel.,"Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) has been found to reduce the risk of cardiac death, myocardial infarction, stroke, and stent thrombosis following acute coronary syndrome and percutaneous coronary intervention. However, this therapy has also been shown to increase the risk of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding as high as 2-fold, especially in patients with multiple risk factors. Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy decreases this risk. The current consensus document on reducing GI risks associated with antiplatelet agents no longer recommends PPI therapy for all patients receiving aspirin (ASA) and clopidogrel. The consensus recommendation reserves PPI therapy for patients receiving DAPT with a history of upper GI bleeding or prespecified risk factors for GI bleeding.  "
CD008201,0,17024592,0,Epidemiology and risk factors of venous thromboembolism.,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common disorder that can affect apparently healthy as well as hospitalized patients. The actual incidence and prevalence of this disease are difficult to estimate because of its often silent nature. The clinical relevance of VTE is highlighted by the important rates of recurrence and mortality. The individual risk of VTE varies as a result of a complex interaction between congenital and transient or permanent acquired risk factors. Risk factors can be either intrinsic (e.g., age, obesity, history of VTE, or thrombophilia) or disease related (e.g., surgical procedures and medical disorders such as cancer, heart failure, or acute respiratory failure). The presence or absence of specific risk factors may play an important role in decisions about the type (and duration) of thromboprophylaxis/anticoagulation to be used."

Nor is there agreement of how to protect the immediate postoperative patient with thromboembolic complications. The authors, believing that routine anticoagulation measures are ill-advised in these two circumstances, elected instead to place a Greenfield vena cava filter for prevention of life-threatening thromboembolism. Using prospective selection criteria, 47 patients could be followed over a 24-76-month period. There were no clinical embolic episodes in either group and no late complications of the filter placement. The few complications in this series were related to insertion, only one of which lead to minor long-term disability. The caval patency rate was 96%. The authors have concluded that such prophylactic use of the Greenfield vena cava filter is justified since it contributes to safer and more reliable total hip and total knee surgery with only minor morbidity."

CD008201,0,26906217,0,Anticoagulation Management Practices and Outcomes in Elderly Patients with Acute Venous Thromboembolism: A Clinical Research Study.,"Whether anticoagulation management practices are associated with improved outcomes in elderly patients with acute venous thromboembolism (VTE) is uncertain. Thus, we aimed to examine whether practices recommended by the American College of Chest Physicians guidelines are associated with outcomes in elderly patients with VTE. We studied 991 patients aged ≥65 years with acute VTE in a Swiss prospective multicenter cohort study and assessed the adherence to four management practices: parenteral anticoagulation ≥5 days, INR ≥2.0 for ≥24 hours before stopping parenteral anticoagulation, early start with vitamin K antagonists (VKA) ≤24 hours of VTE diagnosis, and the use of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) or fondaparinux. The outcomes were all-cause mortality, VTE recurrence, and major bleeding at 6 months, and the length of hospital stay (LOS). We used Cox regression and lognormal survival models, adjusting for patient characteristics. Overall, 9% of patients died, 3% had VTE recurrence, and 7% major bleeding. Early start with VKA was associated with a lower risk of major bleeding (adjusted hazard ratio 0.37, 95% CI 0.20-0.71). Early start with VKA (adjusted time ratio [TR] 0.77, 95% CI 0.69-0.86) and use of LMWH/fondaparinux (adjusted TR 0.87, 95% CI 0.78-0.97) were associated with a shorter LOS. An INR ≥2.0 for ≥24 hours before stopping parenteral anticoagulants was associated with a longer LOS (adjusted TR 1.2, 95% CI 1.08-1.33). In elderly patients with VTE, the adherence to recommended anticoagulation management practices showed mixed results. In conclusion, only early start with VKA and use of parenteral LMWH/fondaparinux were associated with better outcomes."
CD008201,0,27486689,0,APS - Diagnostics and challenges for the future.,"Diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is essentially based on the detection of circulating antiphospholipid (aPL) antibodies. Progress have been made on the standardization of tests exploring the presence of aPL as guidelines on coagulation and immunological tests were recently published in the literature. Clinical relevance of aPL profile has come from prospective cohort studies in populations with a homogeneous antibody profile supporting the view that triple positivity is a high risk pattern in patients and carriers. In addition to the classic ones, several other tests have been proposed for the diagnosis of APS. The detection of antibodies directed to domain 1 and 4/5 of β2-Glycoprotein I (β2GP1) were found to be particularly sound. Several issues remain to be addressed. We do not yet know what is the physiological function of β2GP1 and the pathophysiology of thrombosis and pregnancy loss in these patients. Moreover, treatment is poorly defined especially in the case of feared catastrophic APS."
CD008201,0,19151861,0,Identifying cancer patients at risk for venous thromboembolism.,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a known complication of cancer which impacts on patient mortality and quality of life. Despite the known deleterious effects of VTE, the benefits of thromboprophylaxis have not been fully established. Identification of patients at highest risk of VTE could lead to better targeting of thromboprophylaxis. Several risk factors have been identified as contributing to VTE such as site and stage of cancer, age, comorbidities, obesity, and acquired prothrombotic states. Anti-cancer agents as well as the use of growth factor support have also been implicated in VTE. Recent data have identified biomarkers such as blood counts, tissue factor and P-selectin. In this review, we briefly summarize the risk factors for VTE as well as candidate biomarkers for VTE in cancer patients. We also review a validated risk score that can identify cancer patients at high risk for VTE. Risk stratification of cancer patients will allow clinicians to identify those patients at highest risk for VTE, who may derive the most benefit from thromboprophylaxis."
CD008201,0,1796409,0,Effects on coagulation and fibrinolysis of desmopressin in patients undergoing total hip replacement.,"Twelve patients undergoing total hip replacement, with regional anaesthesia and with dextran infusion for plasma expansion and thromboprophylaxis, were given the vasopressin analogue desmopressin (DDAVP) or placebo in a randomized, double-blind prospective study. In controls (n = 6) we found a prolongation of the bleeding time, low factor VIII (FVIII) and von Willebrand factor (vWF) and a decrease in antithrombin III to levels known to be at risk for venous thrombosis. Desmopressin shortened postoperative bleeding time, gave an early FVIII/vWF complex increase, prevented antithrombin III from falling to critically low values and appeared to activate the fibrinolytic system, both by tPA increase and PAI-1 decrease. Thus in the controls we found changes in both coagulation and fibrinolysis indicating a haemorrhagic diathesis as well as a risk for thromboembolism. Desmopressin induced factor changes that possibly reduce both risks."
CD008201,0,11850611,0,The use of antithrombotic drugs in older people.,"Older individuals (subjects aged >65 years) largely contribute to the percentage deaths due to myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke. The incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) is also higher >65 years old patients. However, the risk of bleeding complications in patients on antithrombotic drugs increases with age and with clinical conditions, as cognitive/psychiatric diseases, traumas, hypertension, poor compliance with medications, common in the elderly. Thus the risk-benefit ratio of antithrombotics should be carefully evaluated in older individuals. To prevent the risk and the recurrence of ischemic stroke and MI in the older patients with stable/ unstable angina, MI, TIA/stroke or peripheral arterial disease, antiplatelet drugs are of choice. Aspirin is the most widely used antiplatelet drug. Clopidogrel is safer and more effective than aspirin in this respect. The combination of heparin and aspirin is the treatment of choice for unstable angina and non-Q wave MI, also in the elderly. Low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs) proved to be as effective as standard heparin in this indication. In the absence of contraindications, thrombolysis for treatment of acute MI may be considered in the elderly. For the treatment of acute venous thromboembolism (VTE), intravenous standard heparin, subcutaneous standard heparin or LMWHs are effective. Because of the limited risk/benefit ratio, thrombolytic agents are not recommended for treating deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the elderly. They should be limited to young patients and to patients with massive pulmonary embolism (PE). For chronic treatment of VTE, warfarin is the treatment of choice (INR 2.0-3.0), also in the elderly. Because of hypersensitivity to oral anticoagulants, lower dosages of warfarin are needed in the old patient. As to prophylaxis of VTE in surgery, in subjects at low-moderate risk, or in medical patients, low-dose heparin or low-dose LMWHs are effective. As to prophylaxis of VTE in surgery in subjects at high risk, adjusted-dose heparin or high-dose LMWHs are recommended. Finally, as to prevention of stroke in patients older than 75 with atrial fibrillation (AF), warfarin is of choice."

Further, there is uncertainty in the estimates of both the baseline risk of pregnancy-related recurrent VTE and the effects of antepartum LMWH prophylaxis.

CD008201,0,26153807,0,Venous thromboembolism: use of graduated compression stockings.,"This article aims to review the use of graduated compression stockings in the prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE). This is particularly important owing to the increasing number of people who die from hospital-acquired VTE and deep vein thrombosis. In addition, there is the need to raise awareness among nurses and other health professionals on the overall impact of VTE, and the number of patients with a range of conditions including cancer who may be at risk of developing VTE. Graduated compression stockings, when used alone, have been found to be effective in preventing VTE in a number of patients in hospital and community settings. However, there is evidence that when used together with other preventative measures such as pharmacological prophylaxis are more effective than graduated compression stockings alone. It is also important that the correct size of graduated compression stocking is used and how they are applied as these may have a significant impact on VTE. The role of the nurse in thromboprophylaxis and implications for practice are discussed."
CD008201,0,8022982,0,Diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis.,"In this chapter, various tests have been discussed in the diagnosis of DVT and have been classified according to various patient categories. To summarize, the following guidelines may be of clinical use in the management of patients with suspected DVT. Acute, First Event of Suspected DVT These patients often suffer from occluding, proximal thrombi. Therefore, noninvasive tests such as CUS or IPG are most suitable for these patients. If an abnormal CUS or IPG result is found, the diagnosis is virtually proven, and this may serve as a basis to treat the patient with anticoagulants. If a normal CUS or IPG result is obtained, serial testing is indicated to detect extending calf vein thrombi or nonoccluding DVT, which becomes occlusive at follow up. Anticoagulants may be withheld safely if the test remains normal within 1 week. Acute, Recurrent Suspected DVT These patients may have residual thrombi present, which makes the noninvasive tests (CUS/IPG) less useful. However, if a normal noninvasive test was documented previous to the acute recurrent event, this test may be used. If an abnormal test result is found in the presence of a documented, normal previous-test outcome, this may serve as a basis for anticoagulant therapy. Although no formal studies have been performed to evaluate the safety of withholding anticoagulants if a normal CUS or IPG result is obtained, serial testing is likely to be adequate in these circumstances. Phlebography is the only truly evaluated approach, and this could be considered in all suspected recurrent DVT. Furthermore, contrast venography is the test of choice to discern acute from old thrombi. Asymptomatic DVT in High-Risk Patients The majority of these thrombi are mostly localized in the calf veins only and are often nonocclusive. This makes noninvasive tests unreliable for their detection. Therefore, only contrast venography should be used in this patient category."

CD008201,0,26713064,0,Clinical Performance of the 1st American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons Clinical Guideline on Prevention of Symptomatic Pulmonary Embolism after Total Knee Arthroplasty in Korean Patients.,"We sought to document the clinical performance of the 1st American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) guideline on the prevention of symptomatic pulmonary embolism (PE) after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) in Korean patients, in terms of the proportions of the each risk-stratified group, efficacy and safety. Consecutive 328 patients underwent TKA were preoperatively assessed for the risks of PE and bleeding and categorized into 4 groups: 1) standard risk, 2) high risk for PE, 3) high risk for bleeding, and 4) high risks both for PE and bleeding. One of three options was administered according to the groups (aspirin in group 1 or 4; enoxaparin and following aspirin in group 2; antithrombotic stocking in group 3). Incidences of symptomatic deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and PE, and major or minor bleeding complications were evaluated. Majority of the patients (86%) were assessed to be with standard risks both for PE and bleeding. No patient experienced symptomatic DVT or PE and major bleeding. Eleven percent of the patients discontinued chemoprophylaxis because of bleeding-related wound complication. In conclusion, the 1st AAOS guideline functions successfully in Korean patients undergoing TKA in terms of prevention of symptomatic DVT and PE while avoiding major bleeding complications."
CD008201,0,25964962,0,Rivaroxaban 2.5 mg. No justification for using this anticoagulant after an acute coronary syndrome.,"Aspirin is the antithrombotic drug of choice for preventing recurrences after a first acute coronary syndrome. The addition of clopidogrel, another antiplatelet agent, is helpful in case of angioplasty with stenting. Following the acute phase, warfarin, an anticoagulant, alone or in combination with aspirin, may be used only in specific situations, particularly for patients with a high thrombotic risk (due to atrial fibrillation for example). Rivaroxaban, an oral factor Xa inhibitor anticoagulant, has been authorised for use following an acute coronary syndrome, but at a new dose strength of 2.5 mg, in combination with aspirin alone or aspirin plus clopidogrel. Rivaroxaban has not been compared with warfarin in patients with a high thrombotic risk following an acute coronary syndrome. In a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial in 15 526 patients, who were not at particularly high risk of thrombosis, the addition of the rivaroxaban to aspirin or to aspirin plus clopidogrel appeared to reduce mortality during the first year of treatment (2.6% versus 3.8% with placebo). However, there is a large amount of missing data, exceeding the inter-group difference in the number of deaths, seriously undermining the results. In the subgroup of about 1000 patients in whom antiplatelet therapy consisted of aspirin alone, addition of rivaroxaban did not lead to a statistically significant decrease in the incidence of cardiovascular events or death. The addition of rivaroxaban increased the incidence of ""clinically relevant"" bleeding episodes, as defined in the study protocol (11.2% of patients per year in the rivaroxaban group versus 6.4% in the placebo group), as well as the incidence of major bleeding events (respectively 1.2% and 0.3% of patients per year) and intracranial haemorrhage (14 versus 5 cases). The patients selected for this trial were considered to have a low risk of bleeding, so the risk is likely to be higher in many patients who have had an acute coronary syndrome. In practice, it has not yet been demonstrated that adding rivaroxaban to aspirin or to aspirin plus clopidogrel is beneficial following an acute coronary syndrome. In addition, the bleeding risk is likely to be higher in routine practice than in the conditions under which the comparative trial was conducted. It is therefore best not to use rivaroxaban in this setting but to stick with best-known antithrombotic drugs."
CD008201,0,17078791,0,Atrial fibrillation and stroke prevention.,"There is overwhelming evidence from randomized trials and systematic reviews to indicate the benefit of thromboprophylaxis in patients with atrial fibrillation. In moderate- to high-risk subjects, oral anticoagulation with warfarin reduces stroke by two-thirds, while aspirin reduces stroke by 22%. The latter result is similar to that seen for stroke reduction with antiplatelet therapy in vascular disease. Numerous studies have shown that less than half the patients eligible for warfarin therapy actually receive it and under- or overanticoagulation is common. This leads to many missed opportunities in optimizing stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation. The limitations of existing oral anticoagulants have resulted in the development of many new drugs. The aim of this review is to provide a brief overview of thromboprophylaxis in atrial fibrillation, and the opportunities for improvement in the provision made for thromboprophylaxis."

A 72-year-old man with liver cirrhosis was admitted to our hospital to undergo emergency treatment for massive hemorrhage of gastric varices. Endoscopic injection sclerotherapy (EIS) using CA was performed on the varices. Radiographic fluoroscopy revealed that most of the injected CA had adhered firmly to the gastric varices, but a certain portion of the CA had flowed to the IVC through the gastrorenal shunt and left renal vein. At that point, the patient did not complain of any symptoms. However, 6 months later, he died of hepatic failure and an autopsy was performed. Histopathologic examination of the wall of the IVC and renal vein, to which CA had adhered, revealed that the CA was covered with endothelial cells of the vessel and no nearby thrombus was present. Long-term anticoagulant therapy may not be indicated in cases of leakage of CA from the gastric varices to other veins, since the leaked CA may be readily covered with endothelium without thrombus formation as in our patient. It is possible for CA to flow to the IVC and have a fatal impact. Our patient was fortunate, and for safe EIS it is important that these complications are prevented."

The parameters observed were the frequency of visible thrombosis, the frequency of occlusive thrombosis and thrombus weights. DS and r-hirudin were investigated in one fixed dose and the LMWHs in prophylactic doses, adjusted to body weight, recommended in high-risk situations by the manufacturers. All substances effectively reduced the three observed parameters. DS and r-hirudin were equally or even more effective than the LMWHs. Although significant differences were not found between the individual LMWH treatments a visible trend cannot be overlooked in all three observed parameters. This cannot solely be explained by the different antifactor Xa activity doses given but increased antithrombotic activity was observed with declining antifactor Xa/antifactor IIa ratio. Our findings indicate that the different commercial LMWHs may differ in their antithrombotic activity when given in recommended doses adjusted to body weight in this experimental model. Dose range studies are required to clarify the thromboprophylactic efficacy of DS and r-hirudin in relation to the tested LMWHs."

Present analyses examined whether there was an increased risk of myocardial infarction associated with non-warfarin anticoagulants (Stroke Prevention with the ORal direct Thrombin Inhibitor ximelagatran compared with warfarin in patients with non-valvular atrial Fibrillation III and IV, RE-LY, Amadeus) or ""anticoagulant equivalents"" (Atrial fibrillation Clopidogrel Trial with Irbesartan for the prevention of Vascular Events) in patients with atrial fibrillation who are prescribed anticoagulation for stroke thromboprophylaxis. The overall annual event rate for those receiving warfarin was 0.98% compared with 1.32% for those receiving comparators. Warfarin was associated with a significant reduction in myocardial infarction (relative risk 0.77; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.63-0.95), an effect largely driven by the RE-LY trial. Sensitivity analyses, excluding RE-LY, revealed a nonsignificant reduction in myocardial infarctions (relative risk 0.83; 95% CI, 0.62-1.10); an analogous analysis excluding the Atrial fibrillation Clopidogrel Trial with Irbesartan for the prevention of Vascular Events demonstrated a significant reduction in myocardial infarctions (relative risk 0.80; 95% CI, 0.64-1.00). Warfarin might provide a protective effect against myocardial infarction compared with non-warfarin anticoagulants or ""anticoagulation equivalents"" in patients with atrial fibrillation who are prescribed anticoagulation for stroke thromboprophylaxis."

The aim of the present review is to highlight the significant advances that are likely to have considerable impact on the direction of future investigations and models of clinical practice. 2. In terms of the acute treatment of stroke, there is now Level I evidence for the use of thrombolysis in the treatment of ischaemic stroke. The results of clinical trials suggest potential new treatments for stroke of inherited origin, whereas other potential treatments have been suggested following the identification of a novel mechanism of emboli clearance by extravasation. Clinical guidelines have also been updated, with tight blood pressure control advocated in cases of acute intracerebral haemorrhage. 3. In terms of stroke prevention, new information has been added to the long-standing debate regarding the value of carotid stenosis management: the predictive value of asymptomatic carotid emboli may enable the identification of individuals at high risk of stroke. Furthermore, the identification of novel risk factors for stroke opens up new avenues for stroke prevention. 4.

CD008201,0,19222477,0,Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of disseminated intravascular coagulation. British Committee for Standards in Haematology.,"The diagnosis of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) should encompass both clinical and laboratory information. The International Society for Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) DIC scoring system provides objective measurement of DIC. Where DIC is present the scoring system correlates with key clinical observations and outcomes. It is important to repeat the tests to monitor the dynamically changing scenario based on laboratory results and clinical observations. The cornerstone of the treatment of DIC is treatment of the underlying condition. Transfusion of platelets or plasma (components) in patients with DIC should not primarily be based on laboratory results and should in general be reserved for patients who present with bleeding. In patients with DIC and bleeding or at high risk of bleeding (e.g. postoperative patients or patients due to undergo an invasive procedure) and a platelet count of <50 x 10(9)/l transfusion of platelets should be considered. In non-bleeding patients with DIC, prophylactic platelet transfusion is not given unless it is perceived that there is a high risk of bleeding. In bleeding patients with DIC and prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), administration of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) may be useful. It should not be instituted based on laboratory tests alone but should be considered in those with active bleeding and in those requiring an invasive procedure. There is no evidence that infusion of plasma stimulates the ongoing activation of coagulation. If transfusion of FFP is not possible in patients with bleeding because of fluid overload, consider using factor concentrates such as prothrombin complex concentrate, recognising that these will only partially correct the defect because they contain only selected factors, whereas in DIC there is a global deficiency of coagulation factors. Severe hypofibrinogenaemia (<1 g/l) that persists despite FFP replacement may be treated with fibrinogen concentrate or cryoprecipitate. In cases of DIC where thrombosis predominates, such as arterial or venous thromboembolism, severe purpura fulminans associated with acral ischemia or vascular skin infarction, therapeutic doses of heparin should be considered. In these patients where there is perceived to be a co-existing high risk of bleeding there may be benefits in using continuous infusion unfractionated heparin (UFH) due to its short half-life and reversibility. Weight adjusted doses (e.g. 10 mu/kg/h) may be used without the intention of prolonging the APTT ratio to 1.5-2.5 times the control. Monitoring the APTT in these cases may be complicated and clinical observation for signs of bleeding is important. In critically ill, non-bleeding patients with DIC, prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism with prophylactic doses of heparin or low molecular weight heparin is recommended. Consider treating patients with severe sepsis and DIC with recombinant human activated protein C (continuous infusion, 24 microg/kg/h for 4 d). Patients at high risk of bleeding should not be given recombinant human activated protein C. Current manufacturers guidance advises against using this product in patients with platelet counts of <30 x 10(9)/l. In the event of invasive procedures, administration of recombinant human activated protein C should be discontinued shortly before the intervention (elimination half-life approximately 20 min) and may be resumed a few hours later, dependent on the clinical situation. In the absence of further prospective evidence from randomised controlled trials confirming a beneficial effect of antithrombin concentrate on clinically relevant endpoints in patients with DIC and not receiving heparin, administration of antithrombin cannot be recommended. In general, patients with DIC should not be treated with antifibrinolytic agents. Patients with DIC that is characterised by a primary hyperfibrinolytic state and who present with severe bleeding could be treated with lysine analogues, such as tranexamic acid (e.g. 1 g every 8 h)."

Proposals of the Working Group on Perioperative Haemostasis (GIHP) - March 2013].","New direct oral anticoagulants (NOAC), inhibitors of factor IIa or Xa, are expected to be widely used for the treatment of venous thromboembolic disease, or in case of atrial fibrillation. Such anticoagulant treatments are known to be associated with haemorrhagic complications. Moreover, it is likely that such patients on long-term treatment with NOAC will be exposed to emergency surgery or invasive procedures. Due to the present lack of experience in such conditions, we cannot make recommendations, but only propose management for optimal safety as regards the risk of bleeding in such emergency conditions. In this article, only dabigatran and rivaroxaban were discussed. For emergency surgery at risk of bleeding, we propose to dose the plasmatic concentration of drug. Levels inferior or equal to 30ng/mL for both dabigatran and rivaroxaban, should enable the realization of a high bleeding risk surgery. For higher concentration, it was proposed to postpone surgery by monitoring the evolution of the drug concentration. Action is then defined by the kind of NOAC and its concentration. If the dosage of the drug is not immediately available, proposals only based on the usual tests, PT and aPTT, also are presented. However, these tests do not really assess drug concentration or bleeding risk. In case of severe haemorrhage in a critical organ, it is proposed to reduce the effect of anticoagulant therapy using a nonspecific procoagulant drug (activated prothrombin concentrate, FEIBA, 30-50U/kg, or non-activated 4-factors prothrombin concentrates 50U/kg). For any other type of severe haemorrhage, the administration of such a procoagulant drug, potentially thrombogenic in these patients, will be discussed regarding concentration of NACO and possibilities for mechanical haemostasis."
CD008201,0,19915995,0,Development of national performance measures on the prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism.,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) remains a significant public health problem in the United States, particularly for hospitalized patients. Approximately two-thirds of all VTE events are associated with recent hospitalization. Despite the well-known risks of VTE, multiple studies have demonstrated underuse of VTE prophylaxis and clinicians often do not provide evidence-based care for those patients with confirmed VTE. In January 2005, the National Quality Forum initiated a project to develop national consensus standards on organization policies, preferred practices, and performance measures for the prevention and treatment of VTE. In addition to the organizational policy statement and 17 preferred practices, eight national performance measures addressing various aspects of VTE prevention and care have been endorsed. There is now a broad consensus on standardized measures of quality for the prevention and treatment of VTE, and a national commitment to collect and publicly report data on the quality of care for this important health problem."

Findings from a multicenter, prospective study.","Hospitalised medical patients are at increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), but the incidence of hospitalisation-related VTE in unselected medical inpatients has not been extensively studied, and uncertainties remain about the optimal use of thromboprophylaxis in this setting. Aims of our prospective, observational study were to assess the prevalence of VTE and the incidence of symptomatic, hospitalisation-related events in a cohort of consecutive patients admitted to 27 Internal Medicine Departments, and to evaluate clinical factors associated with the use of thromboprophylaxis. Between March and September 2006, a total of 4,846 patients were included in the study. Symptomatic VTE with onset of symptoms later than 48 hours after admission (""hospital-acquired"" events, primary study end-point) occurred in 26 patients (0.55%), while the overall prevalence of VTE (including diagnosis prior to or at admission) was 3.65%. During hospital stay antithrombotic prophylaxis was administered in 41.6% of patients, and in 58.7% of those for whom prophylaxis was recommended according to the 2004 Guidelines of the American College of Chest Physicians. The choice of administering thromboprophylaxis or not appeared qualitatively adherent to indications from randomised clinical trials and international guidelines, and bed rest was the strongest determinant of the use of prophylaxis. Data from our real-world study confirm that VTE is a relevant complication in patients admitted to Internal Medicine Departments, and recommended tromboprophylaxis is still under-used, in particular in some patients groups. Further efforts are needed to better define risk profile and to optimise prophylaxis in the heterogeneous setting of medical inpatients."
CD008201,0,24138379,0,The Western Australian Audit of Surgical Mortality: outcomes from the first 10 years.,"The Western Australian Audit of Surgical Mortality (WAASM) is an external, peer-reviewed audit of all deaths that occur in hospital of patients under the care of a surgeon. We conducted a retrospective analysis of prospective audit data collected from 1 January 2002 to 31 December 2011. The annual number of deaths peaked in 2006, then fell 22% by 2011. After correcting for population growth, the overall reduction from 2002 to 2011 was 30% (regression analysis, P = 0.002). Some changes in practice, such as with pancreatic surgery, can be directly attributed to WAASM. There is strong evidence to suggest that WAASM improved other aspects of care, such as thromboembolic prophylaxis, consultant supervision and fluid management. A shift of high-risk patients to teaching hospitals, where there is a greater ability to ""rescue"" patients after complications, may have been an important factor in improved outcomes. This external, peer-reviewed mortality audit has changed surgical practice and reduced deaths. The same process should be applied to other sentinel events, and the lessons learned can also be extended to non-surgical specialties."

CD008201,0,20478689,0,[Clotting disorders and preeclampsia].,"Clotting disorders are associated with the severe, early and complicated forms of PE. Compensated hypercoagulability states associated with a thrombocytopenia (PLT<150k/mm(3)) affect 25 to 50% of severe PE patients. Laboratory markers of platelet and endothelial activation are the early increase of fibronectin levels, the worsening of the thrombocytopenia and the raised platelet turnover. The excessive thrombin formation is physiologically compensated by a rise in thrombin-antithrombin (TAT) complex levels, which is the most specific marker of a PE pregnancy, and a decrease in anti-thrombin (AT) activity. The placenta induced depression of the fibrinolysis appears to contribute towards the hypercoagulable state. The etiological importance of the erythrocyte and leucocyte activation with regards to the abnormal clotting activation is highlighted in the setting of maternal systematic inflammatory disease. The state of compensated coagulopathy found in the PE patient can suffer a pro-coagulatory imbalance because of a quantitative, or a qualitative failure (i.e. thrombophilia) of the physiological coagulation inhibitors, or a combination of both. This disseminated intravascular coagulation, qualified as chronic, is associated with clinically evident signs of foeto-placental unit impairment (i.e. IUGR, foetal death) with or without systemic repercussions in the mother (i.e. renal failure, HELLP syndrome, eclampsia). This set of haemostatic disturbances found in the PE patient is a dynamic phenomenon, which can evolve by the hour therefore requires frequent laboratory investigations. Delivery remains the only curative treatment for these haemostatic disturbances. A better understanding of the aetiology of DIC in PE, an early detection method and a specific identification of the at-risk patients could allow prophylactic and curative treatment."

We here describe two cases with intermediate risk pulmonary embolism and severe hypoxaemia where manual thrombectomy with a 10F dedicated catheter was effective and improved clinical and haemodynamic parameters.

CD008201,0,20356783,0,Rheumatic heart disease in indigenous populations.,"Rates of acute rheumatic fever and chronic rheumatic heart disease in Aboriginal people, Torres Strait Islanders and Māori continue to be unacceptably high. The impact of rheumatic heart disease is inequitable on these populations as compared with other Australians and New Zealanders. The associated cardiac morbidity, including the development of rheumatic valve disease, and cardiomyopathy, with possible sequelae of heart failure, development of atrial fibrillation, systemic embolism, transient ischaemic attacks, strokes, endocarditis, the need for interventions including cardiac surgery, and impaired quality of life, and shortened life expectancy, has major implications for the individual. The adverse health and social effects may significantly limit education and employment opportunities and increase dependency on welfare. Additionally there may be major adverse impacts on family and community life. The costs in financial terms and missed opportunities, including wasted young lives, are substantial. Prevention of acute rheumatic fever is dependent on the timely diagnosis and treatment of sore throats and skin infections in high-risk groups. Both Australia and New Zealand have registries for acute rheumatic fever but paradoxically neither includes all cases of chronic rheumatic heart disease many of whom would benefit from close surveillance and follow-up. In New Zealand and some Australian States there are programs to give secondary prophylaxis with penicillin, but these are not universal. Surgical outcomes for patients with rheumatic valvular disease are better for valve repair than for valve replacement. Special attention to the selection of the appropriate valve surgery and valve choice is required in pregnant women. It may be necessary to have designated surgical units managing Indigenous patients to ensure high rates of surgical repair rather than valve replacement. Surgical guidelines may be helpful. Long-term follow-up of the outcomes of surgery in Indigenous patients with rheumatic heart disease is required. Underpinning these strategies is the need to improve poverty, housing, education and employment. Cultural empathy with mutual trust and respect is essential. Involvement of Indigenous people in decision making, design, and implementation of primary and secondary prevention programs, is mandatory to reduce the unacceptably high rates of rheumatic heart disease."

Diagnostic, therapy and peri-operative strategies].","Venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolisms are currently associated with high mortality rates in Europe as well as in the United States (mortality rate >300,000-500,000/year). The highest risk is attributed to orthopedic surgery. Besides the use of antithrombotic agents, surgical and anesthesiological procedures as well as a multitude of trigger mechanisms, many thrombophilic risk conditions have to be considered. The incidence of thrombotic complications could be continuously reduced by the improvement of different antithrombotic strategies and use of drugs. According to national and international guidelines low molecular weight heparins and fondaparinux (besides aPTT adjusted strategies by using unfractionated heparin) are mainly indicated in high risk patients undergoing hip and knee surgery.The use of newly developed anti-IIa and anti-Xa inhibitors (e.g. dabigatran etexilate, rivaroxaban) is not yet established in guidelines. The discovery of pentasaccharide has further improved the antithrombotic efficiency, but it is still unknown how to manage patients with thrombophilia. Otherwise the knowledge of thrombophilia is not mandatory to know how to manage high risk patients. In contrast information on a history of thrombotic complications as well as indications gained from the family history are of great importance. Whether and to what extent, which patients with or without thrombophilic disposition, under which conditions from which medication within an anti-coagulation prophylaxis profit most over which time period, will be of future interest. Fundamentally, the age of the patient as well as liver and kidney function values and possible interactions between medications must be taken into consideration for selection of individual anti-thrombotic drugs. Even prolongation of medical immobilization prophylaxis can lead to accumulative risks, such as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, the risk of which grows with increased exposition to the triggering agent."
CD008201,0,18521507,0,Bleeding complications after systematic switch of routine thromboprophylaxis for major orthopaedic surgery.,"The rate of bleeding complications after major orthopedic surgery approximates 2%. It is unclear whether a systematic switch of routine thromboprophylaxis has an impact on the rate of postoperative bleeding complications. We analyzed prospectively recorded postoperative bleeding complications and symptomatic venous thromboembolic events in 8,176 consecutive orthopedic patients at the Schulthess Clinic Zurich during a systematic switch of thromboprophylaxis from nadroparin to enoxaparin in the year 2004. Overall, 3,893 patients received nadroparin in the first nine-month observation period before the switch and 4,283 patients received enoxaparin in the second nine-month observation period after the switch. Overall, 96 (2.5%) patients in the first period and 70 (1.6%) patients in the second period suffered a postoperative bleeding complication requiring surgical revision, puncture, or transfusion (p < 0.01). Five objectively confirmed symptomatic venous thromboembolic events during hospitalization in the first period and three events in the second period were recorded. In conclusion, the switch of thromboprophylaxis in a large orthopedic clinic did not cause an increase of postoperative bleeding complications and therefore was accompanied by high patient safety."

CD008201,0,21116184,0,Factor V Leiden thrombophilia.,"Factor V Leiden is a genetic disorder characterized by a poor anticoagulant response to activated Protein C and an increased risk for venous thromboembolism. Deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism are the most common manifestations, but thrombosis in unusual locations also occurs. The current evidence suggests that the mutation has at most a modest effect on recurrence risk after initial treatment of a first venous thromboembolism. Factor V Leiden is also associated with a 2- to 3-fold increased relative risk for pregnancy loss and possibly other obstetric complications, although the probability of a successful pregnancy outcome is high. The clinical expression of Factor V Leiden is influenced by the number of Factor V Leiden alleles, coexisting genetic and acquired thrombophilic disorders, and circumstantial risk factors. Diagnosis requires the activated Protein C resistance assay (a coagulation screening test) or DNA analysis of the F5 gene, which encodes the Factor V protein. The first acute thrombosis is treated according to standard guidelines. Decisions regarding the optimal duration of anticoagulation are based on an individualized assessment of the risks for venous thromboembolism recurrence and anticoagulant-related bleeding. In the absence of a history of thrombosis, long-term anticoagulation is not routinely recommended for asymptomatic Factor V Leiden heterozygotes, although prophylactic anticoagulation may be considered in high-risk clinical settings. In the absence of evidence that early diagnosis reduces morbidity or mortality, decisions regarding testing at-risk family members should be made on an individual basis."

Application of the guideline is dedicated or designated to the patients with acute ischemic stroke, and which is applied only limited to the general management. Guidelines for subacute or chronic phase, or the specific treatment for ischemic stroke patients will be published in separated articles. Management of most of the needs for patients with acute ischemic stroke must be completed in a very short period of time. It is recommended that hospitals providing stroke service to set up stroke unit, and to organize an integrated stroke team consisting of specialists from multiple disciplines. Upon arrival to the hospitals, patients should undergo the brain computed tomography, and related examinations and assessment as soon as possible to guide the choice of treatment reference for acute intervention. Intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator treatment within three hours is effective in reducing disability for patients with acute ischemic stroke. Ischemic stroke patients with or without persistent symptoms should start antiplatelet therapy immediately, generally aspirin. Dose-adjusted warfarin (INR range of 2.0-3.0) is recommended for ischemic stroke patients with persistent or paroxysmal atrial fibrillation to prevent secondary embolism. The routine use ofheparin and drugs theoretically preventing further brain injury, including steroids, neuroprotectants, plasma volume expanders, barbiturates, and streptokinase, has not been proven benefits for recommendation."

CD008201,0,22959549,0,Venous thromboembolism in neonates and children.,"Thrombosis in children is gaining increased awareness, as advanced medical care has increased treatment intensity of hospitalized pediatric patients. Guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of children and neonates with venous thromboembolism (VTE) are mostly extrapolated from adult data, despite the uniqueness of their hemostatic system. Whereas inherited thrombophilia (IT) have been established as risk factors for VTE in adults, in children with idiopathic VTE and in pediatric populations in which thromboses were associated with medical diseases, IT have been described as additional risk factors. Follow-up data for VTE recurrence in children suggest a recurrence rate between 3% (neonates) and 21% (idiopathic VTE). Apart from underlying medical conditions, recently reported systematic reviews on pediatric VTE and stroke have shown significant associations between thrombosis and presence of factor V G1691A, factor II G20210A, protein C-, protein S- and antithrombin deficiency, even more pronounced when combined IT were involved. The pooled odds ratios (OR: single IT) for VTE onset ranged from 2.4 for the factor II G20210A mutation (cerebrovascular occlusion) to 9.4 in children with antithrombin deficiency (venous VTE). In addition, the pooled OR for persistent antiphospholipid antibodies/lupus anticoagulants was 6.6 for children with cerebrovascular occlusion and 4.9 for pediatric cases with venous VTE. The factor II G20210A mutation (OR: 2.1), protein C- (OR: 2.4), S- (OR: 3.1), and antithrombin deficiency (OR: 3.0) did also play a significant role at recurrence. Among primarily asymptomatic family members of pediatric VTE index cases annual VTE incidences were 2.82% (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.63-4.80%) in carriers of antithrombin, protein C, or protein S-deficiency, 0.42% (0.12-0.53%) for factor II G202010A, 0.25% (0.12-0.53%) for factor V G1691A, and 0.10% (0.06-0.17%) in relatives with no IT.

In Stepping Hill Hospital this was audited. The outcome was that 0% of emergency caesarean sections, and only 25% of elective caesarean sections who were considered to be high risk had heparin prophylaxis. A structured risk assessment form was introduced for every patient undergoing caesarean section and the outcome was re-audited; 72.7% and 85.7% of emergency and elective caesarean sections, respectively,that were deemed high risk had adequate heparin thromboembolic prophylaxis.

CD008201,0,26933047,0,Reimagining Anticoagulation Clinics in the Era of Direct Oral Anticoagulants.,"Anticoagulation clinics were initially developed to provide safe and effective care for warfarin-treated patients with atrial fibrillation, venous thromboembolism, and mechanical valve replacement. Traditionally, these patients required ongoing laboratory monitoring and warfarin dose adjustment by expert providers. With the introduction of direct oral anticoagulants (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban), many have questioned the need for anticoagulation clinic. However, we think that the growing number of oral anticoagulant choices creates an urgent need for expanding the traditional role of the anticoagulation clinic. We outline 3 key purposes that a reimagined anticoagulation clinic would serve: (1) to assist patients and clinicians with selecting the most appropriate drug and dose from a growing list of anticoagulant options (including warfarin), (2) to help patients minimize the risk of serious bleeding complications with careful long-term monitoring and peri-procedural management, and (3) to encourage ongoing adherence to these life-saving medications. We also describe how repurposing anticoagulation clinics as broader medication safety clinics would promote safe and effective care across a range of cardiovascular conditions for high-risk medications (eg, spironolactone, amiodarone). Finally, we highlight a few existing health systems that are overcoming key challenges to implementing a reimagined anticoagulation or medication safety clinic structure."
CD008201,0,26357675,0,Endoscopic submucosal dissection for early gastric cancer without interruption of warfarin and aspirin.,"Many guidelines for the management of antithrombotic therapy in endoscopic procedures state that warfarin should be replaced by heparin in high risk endoscopic procedures. However, heparin bridging therapy is costly, requires a long hospital stay, and is indicated as a risk factor for bleeding after endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD). It is not yet clear whether it is better to perform gastric ESD on continuous warfarin therapy or heparin bridging therapy. We report the case of a 65-year-old Japanese man who had been diagnosed with early gastric cancer. He had a past medical history of metallic valve replacement for mitral valve regurgitation, coronary artery disease with bare metal stent, and coronary artery bypass graft. Warfarin and low dose aspirin had been used to prevent thromboembolic events in the metallic mitral valve and coronary artery stent. We performed gastric ESD safely on continuous warfarin and low dose aspirin without any complications."

CD008201,0,20839715,0,Unicompartmental knee arthroplasty: incidence of transfusion and symptomatic thromboembolic disease.,"Unicompartmental knee arthroplasty has been associated with faster recovery with less potential perioperative morbidity compared to total knee arthroplasty. This study investigates the rate of transfusion, symptomatic thromboembolic events, and length of hospital stay in 1000 consecutive, unicompartmental knee replacements performed by 2 surgeons. A rapid recovery protocol coupled with multimodal venous thromboembolism prophylaxis was used for all patients. Five patients (0.5%) received a blood transfusion for symptomatic postoperative anemia. One patient (0.1%) developed a symptomatic deep venous thrombosis within 90 days of follow-up. No patient experienced a symptomatic pulmonary embolism. Length of hospital stay averaged 1.4 days. Unicompartmental arthroplasty using less invasive surgical techniques, a rapid recovery protocol, and multimodal venous thromboembolism prevention is a safe and effective procedure associated with a low rate of morbidity."
CD008201,0,17077283,0,Platelets induce differentiation of human CD34+ progenitor cells into foam cells and endothelial cells.,"Recruitment of human CD34+ progenitor cells toward vascular lesions and differentiation into vascular cells has been regarded as a critical initial step in atherosclerosis. Previously we found that adherent platelets represent potential mediators of progenitor cell homing besides their role in thrombus formation. On the other hand, foam cell formation represents a key process in atherosclerotic plaque formation. To investigate whether platelets are involved in progenitor cell recruitment and differentiation into endothelial cells and foam cells, we examined the interactions of platelets and CD34+ progenitor cells. Cocultivation experiments showed that human platelets recruit CD34+ progenitor cells via the specific adhesion receptors P-selectin/PSGL-1 and beta1- and beta2-integrins. Furthermore, platelets were found to induce differentiation of CD34+ progenitor cells into mature foam cells and endothelial cells. Platelet-induced foam cell generation could be prevented partially by HMG coenzyme A reductase inhibitors via reduction of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) secretion. Finally, agonists of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha and -gamma attenuated platelet-induced foam cell generation and production of MMP-9. The present study describes a potentially important mechanism of platelet-induced foam cell formation and generation of endothelium in atherogenesis and atheroprogression. The understanding and modulation of these mechanisms may offer new treatment strategies for patients at high risk for atherosclerotic diseases."
CD008201,0,8908217,0,"Thromboprophylaxis, coagulation disorders, and regional anaesthesia.","The surgery and trauma-induced modulation of the coagulation system includes a considerable risk of perioperative thromboembolic complications unless effective thromboprophylactic treatment is given. In the present survey the patient at risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) is characterized and the documented efficacy of different currently used thromboprophylactic regimens is summarized. Systemic thromboprophylactic treatment may include a risk of an increased bleeding tendency which may lead to haemorrhagic complications. In patients with a coagulation abnormality or in patients receiving anticoagulants for perioperative thromboprophylaxis there is a fear among anaesthesiologists that the use of regional anaesthesia (spinal or epidural) may be associated with spinal haemorrhagic complications, i.e. with spinal haematoma formation leading to compression of the spinal cord and severe neurologic sequelae. Present aspects on the risk of spinal haematoma formation at the combined use of pharmacological thromboprophylactic regimens and spinal or epidural anaesthesia/ analgesia are therefore summarized. Pregnancy is associated with changes in the haemostatic system, which in the preeclamptic or eclamptic patient may be rather pronounced and constitute a clinical problem since regional anaesthetic techniques are often preferred for obstetric anaesthesia/analgesia. The specific problems to be considered prior to the choice of regional anaesthesia/analgesia for a parturient with a suspected coagulation disorder are therefore commented on in more detail. Finally, recommendations are given for safe spinal and epidural analgesic and anaesthetic routines in patients with potential haemostatic disturbances due to thromboprophylactic treatment with anticoagulants or bleeding disorders."
CD008201,0,16119704,0,Drug insight: an overview of current anticoagulation therapy after heart valve replacement.,"Vitamin K antagonists, such as warfarin, are the gold standard approach for the long-term anticoagulant therapy of patients with mechanical heart valves. Management decisions are, however, based predominantly on expert consensus and on data from nonrandomized, follow-up studies, which have inherent limitations in their methods. Low-intensity anticoagulation therapy provides protection against thromboembolic complications in patients with most types of modern prosthetic heart valve. The addition of low-dose aspirin is safe if international normalized ratio values below 3.5 are maintained. A combined regimen should be considered in high-risk patients and those with coexistent coronary artery or cerebrovascular disease, and in patients who have suffered a thromboembolic event despite a therapeutic international normalized ratio. Thromboprophylaxis with unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparins is restricted to specific situations, such as when a patient is intolerant to vitamin K antagonists, when surgical procedures require discontinuation of oral anticoagulation, or when the patient is pregnant. A lack of uniformity across practice guidelines make it difficult to reach treatment decisions. Each patient's preference, expressed after counseling about the risks and benefits of each treatment strategy, and an individual assessment of the patient's risk factors, should guide treatment decisions. At present, new anticoagulant agents such as factor Xa inhibitors do not represent a treatment option for heart valve recipients."
CD008201,0,7873468,0,Nitrates for unstable angina.,"The term unstable angina encompasses heterogeneous clinical syndromes. Fissuring of an atherosclerotic coronary artery plaque with superimposed platelet deposition, with or without additional thrombus formation, is invariably responsible for a prolonged episode of angina at rest, increasing frequency of angina at rest, or with minimal exertion of less than 4 weeks in duration and early postinfarction angina. Plaque progression, rather than plaque fissuring, is the most likely mechanism for progressive reduction in walking distance due to angina in patients who previously have stable angina. Coronary artery spasm is responsible for Prinzmetal's variant angina, but its exact role in other forms of unstable angina is unknown. The mainstay of treatment of unstable angina (prolonged episode of angina at rest and recent onset angina at rest, or with minimal exertion with a crescendo pattern) is aspirin, heparin, or both. Both aspirin and intravenous (i.v.) heparin or their combination reduce early mortality and the incidence of acute myocardial infarction in patients hospitalized with unstable angina. However, these agents do not promptly relieve chest pain. There are no placebo-controlled studies evaluating the usefulness of nitrates in unstable angina. In open-label studies, continuous therapy with i.v. nitroglycerin (NTG) for 24 hours or longer has been shown to relieve chest pain in patients with rest angina refractory to therapy with other antianginal agents, including long-acting nitrates. Recurrence of chest pain in patients receiving i.v. NTG is a common problem and probably represents development of pharmacologic tolerance, but this can be overridden by dose escalation; protracted tolerance during short-term use of i.v. NTG is usually not a problem.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

CD008201,0,9666532,0,Early discharge strategies following venous thrombosis.,"Low-molecular-weight heparin therapy is administered subcutaneously, not intravenously. This has made possible the management of selected patients who have acute deep venous thrombosis as outpatients. Others can be treated with an abbreviated several day hospitalization rather than the conventional 5 or more hospital days needed for administration of continuous intravenous unfractionated heparin. Two large studies, Tasman and a Canadian trial, have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of low-molecular-weight heparin in this setting. Now, the task is to develop guidelines for widespread application of these findings to daily clinical practice. However, successful home treatment will require intensive patient education as well as an extensive infrastructure of supportive nursing and physician services. Careful patient follow-up will be crucially important."
CD008201,0,19902146,0,Using low molecular weight heparin in special patient populations.,"Clinical trials evaluating low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) for the prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism and acute coronary syndromes have led to their regulatory approval for these indications in the general population. However, certain patient populations have been excluded from these landmark clinical trials, including patients with renal insufficiency, obese patients and pregnant women. In these special populations, data on safety and efficacy is limited and typically based on pharmacokinetic studies often performed in healthy subjects, or small cohort studies which are generally not powered to evaluate clinical outcomes such as bleeding or recurrent thrombosis. Because LMWH is mainly cleared renally, patients with severe renal insufficiency are at risk of LMWH accumulation and increased bleeding risks. In obese patients, there is concern regarding possible overdosing of therapeutic dose LMWH, since LMWH does not distribute in fat tissue. There are also concerns about possible underdosing of prophylactic dose LMWH in obese individuals using the standard fixed doses, particularly in the extremely obese individuals undergoing bariatric surgery. Last, pregnancy poses challenges with regards to the safety of LMWH during pregnancy and use of LMWH around delivery. This review summarizes the existing data in these special populations and proposes general recommendations for practice."

Despite this fact, appropriate prophylaxis is vastly underutilized. To improve compliance with best practice prophylaxis for VTE in hospitalized trauma patients, we implemented a mandatory computerized provider order entry-based clinical decision support tool. The system required completion of checklists of VTE risk factors and contraindications to pharmacologic prophylaxis. With this tool, we were able to determine a patient's risk stratification level and recommend appropriate prophylaxis.

CD008201,0,26916302,0,Measurement of microparticle tissue factor activity in clinical samples: A summary of two tissue factor-dependent FXa generation assays.,"Thrombosis is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Detection of a prothrombotic state using biomarkers would be of great benefit to identify patients at risk of thrombosis that would benefit from thromboprophylaxis. Tissue factor (TF) is a highly procoagulant protein that under normal conditions is not present in the blood. However, increased levels of TF in the blood in the form of microparticles (MPs) (also called extracellular vesicles) are observed under various pathological conditions. In this review, we will discuss studies that have measured MP-TF activity in a variety of diseases using two similar FXa generation assay. One of the most robust signals for MP-TF activity (16-26 fold higher than healthy controls) is observed in pancreatic cancer patients with venous thromboembolism. In this case, the TF+ MPs appear to be derived from the cancer cells. Surprisingly, cirrhosis and acute liver injury are associated with 17-fold and 38-fold increases in MP-TF activity, respectively. Based on mouse models, we speculate that the TF+ MPs are derived from hepatocytes. More modest increases are observed in patients with urinary tract infections (6-fold) and in a human endotoxemia model (9-fold) where monocytes are the likely source of the TF+ MPs. Finally, there is no increase in MP-TF activity in the majority of cardiovascular disease patients. These studies indicate that MP-TF activity may be a useful biomarker to identify patients with particular diseases that have an increased risk of thrombosis."

CD008201,0,22750768,0,Combination of factor V Leiden and MTHFR mutations in myocardial infarction.,"Identifying patients who are at high risk of suffering myocardial infarction can be done by determining risk factors or by the adoption of molecular genetic testing for inherited thrombophilia. We report a case of myocardial infarction at a young age. The patient complained of dyspnea (stage III) and a burning pain of severe intensity that radiated to the left retrosternal side, but was not associated with palpitations or diaphoresis. A number of biochemical parameters were normal except for an elevated creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) level. Genetic testing revealed the subject to be heterozygous for both the factor V leiden and MTHFR C677T polymorphisms. The combination of these two mutations may be a high risk factor for myocardial infarction.

ENDORSE (Epidemiologic International Day for the Evaluation of Patients at Risk for Venous Thromboembolism in the Acute Hospital Care Setting) study is a multinational cross-sectional survey designed to assess the prevalence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk in the acute hospital care setting, and to determine the proportion of at-risk patients who receive appropriate prophylaxis. All hospital inpatients aged 40 years or above admitted to a medical ward, or those aged 18 years or above admitted to a surgical ward, in 358 randomly selected hospitals across 32 countries were assessed for risk of VTE on the basis of hospital chart review. The 2004 American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based consensus guidelines were used to assess venous thromboembolism risk and to determine whether patients were receiving recommended prophylaxis. Nine Hungarian centers were included in the international survey, and a total of 1300 patients were assessed for thrombosis risk in Hungary. Of these patients 39.9% (N=519) were judged at risk for VTE, including 58.2% (N=253) surgical and 30.8% (N=266) medical patients. 56.6% (N=294) of the total at-risk patients received ACCP-recommended VTE prophylaxis. Among major surgery patients 86.6% (N=219) received recommended prophylaxis compared with 28.2% (N=75) of medical patients. In Hungary more than two-thirds of at-risk hospitalized medical patients did not receive appropriate prophylaxis. ENDORSE results reinforced that a large proportion of hospitalized surgical and medical patients are at risk for VTE worldwide as well as in Hungary. The rate of at-risk patients receiving appropriate prophylaxis should be urgently increased."

CD008201,0,19479483,0,Cancer and thrombosis: back to the future renewed interest in an old problem.,"Cancer patients are at increased risk for thromboembolic complications due to the release of procoagulants, compression or invasion of blood vessels and the reduced mobility associated with cancer and cancer treatment. This has led to recommendations for thromboprophylaxis in hospitalized medical and surgical cancer patients and extended prophylaxis in cancer patients experiencing a venous thromboembolism. Routine prophylactic anticoagulation is not currently recommended in ambulatory cancer patients except in very high risk settings. Another area of increasing research interest is the potential role of anticoagulants on tumor growth, invasiveness and metastasis. Several randomized controlled trials have suggested a potential benefit of anticoagulation on cancer patient survival. Additional investigation into these and related questions should represent a high priority area for future basic and translational cancer research."

A survey of thromboprophylaxis practice across British specialist palliative care units in the years 2000 and 2005.,"Palliative care patients are highly prothrombotic, yet there are no national guidelines for the prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE). A survey was undertaken to explore thromboprophylaxis practice within British palliative care inpatient units and whether it changed over 5 years in keeping with emerging evidence. A descriptive semistructured telephone survey was conducted in April, 2000 and March, 2005 to explore current thromboprophylaxis practice. Seventy-four percent of units participated in 2000 and 91% participated in 2005. Units surveyed in 2000 revealed that 2% had thromboprophylaxis guidelines and up to 75% would stop ongoing low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) in a highly prothrombotic, good prognosis inpatient. The survey in 2005 indicated that thromboprophylaxis guidelines were being developed in 19% of units and only 18% of units surveyed would stop LMWH in a patient already receiving thromboprophylaxis (P < 0.001). There appears to be a growing awareness of the problem of VTE in British palliative care inpatients, as evidenced by changes in attitudes and practice. Reasons for this are discussed."
CD008201,0,12232818,0,Discoveries in thrombosis care for medical patients.,"Medical patients represent the majority of hospitalized patients, and at least 75% of fatal pulmonary emboli occur in this group. Medical patients are at significant risk of thromboembolic disease, yet few are considered for thromboprophylaxis. Recent studies have identified the risk factor profiles in this group of patients, and a risk assessment model for medical patients has been developed. Risk stratification will help to ensure that patients receive appropriate thromboprophylaxis. It is clear that patients with severe chronic respiratory disease, congestive heart failure, and infectious disease are at high risk of symptomatic venous thromboembolism (VTE), particularly pulmonary embolism. Heparin-based prophylaxis significantly reduces the incidence of VTE.

Although late ST after DES placement is uncommon (approximately 0.4-0.6%/year), it is catastrophic clinical consequences make it a concern. Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAT) with aspirin and clopidogrel is the standard of care for prevention of ST, and DAT discontinuation is associated with a marked increase in ST risk. These guidelines recommend continuing DAT for > or = 12 months after DES implantation in patients not at high risk for bleeding. Premature DAT discontinuation is common in clinical practice. Therefore, it is imperative that physicians be aware of factors contributing to discontinuation, including cost, patient education, and actual bleeding events, so as to educate their patients about the risks and benefits of continued DAT. This review highlights the risks of premature DAT discontinuation, discusses common reasons for discontinuation, and offers potential solutions to improve adherence."
CD008201,0,10493235,0,Applying risk assessment models in non-surgical patients: overview of our clinical experience.,"Many venous thromboembolic events occur in non-surgical patients. Prophylaxis is recommended in consensus statements but is not uniformly applied in clinical practice. Medical conditions such as stroke, cancer, and myocardial infarction are associated with thromboembolism. Patients' overall risk is affected by pharmacotherapies (e.g., cancer chemotherapy), mechanical interventions (e.g., central venous catheterization), and by intrinsic patient factors such as age, obesity and coagulation disorders, both inherited and acquired. Few large clinical trials in well-defined medical patient subgroups have been performed. Due to the perceived lower incidence of thromboembolism in non-surgical patients compared to patients undergoing high-risk surgery (e.g., hip replacement), the value of thromboprophylaxis in medical patients has been questioned. Prophylaxis may have a significant impact on the frequency of non-fatal thromboembolic events, thereby reducing short- and long-term morbidity. Due to the complexity of overall thromboembolic risk assessment in medical patients and the paucity of convincing studies at present, prospectively validated evidence-based risk assessment models for determining thrombosis risk would be useful. Further clinical research is needed to help develop accurate methods of risk stratification and to clarify the benefits of thromboprophylaxis in medical patients."

CD008201,0,18842458,0,A review of the practical advantages of low molecular weight heparin in the treatment of cancer-related venous thromboembolism.,"Patients with cancer, particularly those with metastatic cancer, are at high risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), which places a huge burden on healthcare resources and can adversely affect patients' prognosis. In addition, VTE can have a negative impact on quality of life and increase the management challenges faced by physicians and nurses. Conventional long-term treatment using vitamin K antagonists, such as warfarin, presents many practical problems for cancer patients including frequent monitoring and dose adjustment, drug interactions, and disruption of anticoagulation for invasive procedures. The aim of this article is to review the potential advantages of using low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) in the treatment of cancer-related VTE in comparison to conventional therapy with warfarin or standard heparin. The potential advantages were determined via a literature review. LMWH is at least as effective as standard heparin or warfarin, and has been shown to have several benefits over warfarin in cancer patients. The simplicity of this therapy enables patients to be treated at home, and has been shown to have a positive impact on overall quality of life. The use of LMWH provides a treatment alternative to patients with cancer offering them hope and optimism regarding their care."

Biomarkers can include blood markers (e.g., von Willebrand factor, D-dimer, natriuretic peptides, etc.), urine (e.g., proteinuria, estimated glomerular filtration rate, or creatinine clearance), cardiac imaging (echocardiography; transthoracic or transoesophageal), or cerebral imaging (e.g., computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging), which can provide additional refinement to clinical stroke risk stratification for identification of ""high risk"" subjects. Although inclusion of some blood-based biomarkers (e.g., von Willebrand factor, D-dimer) in existing clinical stroke risk stratification schemes might improve their predictive value for identifying ""high risk"" patients, this concept might be outdated and overtaken by new developments in thromboprophylaxis (which now focus on initial identification of ""low risk"" patients who do not need any antithrombotic therapy, followed by patients with 1 or more stroke risk factors, to whom anticoagulation can be offered), and additional questionable practicality in ""everyday"" practice. Biomarkers could be applied as a ""rule out"" approach or as surrogates of anticoagulation efficacy in trials of new antithrombotic strategies. The present review aims to provide an update of the role of biomarkers in AF, with particular focus on AF outcomes."
CD008201,0,10192039,0,[How to provide practical treatment for ambulatory patients with deep venous thrombosis].,"Much interest has been focused on low molecular weight heparins (LMWH), light weight fragments of standard heparin, for the management of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) without pulmonary embolism (PE). LMWHs offer several advantages: predictable anticoagulant activity, better bioavailability, longer half-life, better patient and caretaker comfort, safety and efficacy at least comparable to continuous intravenous heparin. Ambulatory treatment is quite attractive and a large number of patients with DVT are now being managed as outpatients. There are however certain precautions which must be taken to avoid unsatisfactory anticoagulation and subsequent consequences which have nevertheless been shown to be exceptional in well-designed and well-conducted trials excluding patients with high risk for hemorrhage and based on attentive medical control. The purpose of this review is to propose clear and simple protocols for everyday practice aimed at a global diagnostic and therapeutic management of venous thromboembolism. The review of the literature draws attention to the need for confirmation of the clinical suspicion of DVT, practical application of the anticoagulant treatment, and the importance of the etiology search in order to avoid missing a congenital or acquired state of thrombophilia or an occult cancer revealed by DVT. Half of all cases of thrombosis are caused by these two etiologies. In addition, with the development of noninvasive methods for diagnosing DVT, the efficacy of clear therapeutic regimens and the simplification of coagulation tests warrant outpatient management in many cases of DVT in compliance with certain rules of good clinical practice: confirmation of the diagnosis and regular treatment controls. An essential element is the close collaboration between the patient, the physician, the nursing staff, the laboratory and the pharmacist."

CD008201,0,18561555,0,"Preventing breast cancer in high-risk women, 2008.","Several large, prospective trials have evaluated tamoxifen compared with placebo for breast cancer risk reduction in women at increased risk for breast cancer. Analysis of the large, prospective breast cancer risk-reduction trials that used tamoxifen estimated that tamoxifen decreased breast cancer incidence by 38% on average and estrogen receptor-positive tumors by 48%. Tamoxifen is known to have several serious side effects, including uterine malignancy, thromboembolic events, cataracts, and menopausal symptoms, that have limited its usefulness in the risk-reduction setting. Raloxifene (Evista) is a benzothiophene selective estrogen-receptor modulator that has antiestrogenic effects on breast and endometrial tissue as well as estrogenic effects that are similar to but distinct from tamoxifen. Among postmenopausal women who are at increased risk for breast cancer, raloxifene is as effective as tamoxifen in reducing the risk of invasive breast cancer but appears to be less effective than tamoxifen in reducing the risk of in situ breast cancer. Raloxifene causes less benign and malignant uterine changes and fewer thromboembolic events than tamoxifen. Symptomatic side effects are comparable for the two drugs. Raloxifene is more appropriate than tamoxifen for reduction of breast cancer risk among postmenopausal women at increased risk for breast cancer."
CD008201,0,25581828,0,Overview of venous thrombosis in inflammatory bowel disease.,"Thrombosis in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an increasingly noted extraintestinal manifestation with high morbidity and mortality. While controlling the activity of the disease with the appropriate therapy, thromboembolism prophylaxis should be applied to all patients. All common risk factors for thromboembolism are also valid for patients with IBD; however, it is clear that uncontrolled disease and hospitalization are major disease-specific risk factors for venous thromboembolism in patients with IBD. Pharmacological thromboprophylaxis with currently available anticoagulants does not increase the risk of further bleeding in patients with IBD with mild-to-moderate bleeding. In severe bleeding or with increased risk of further bleeding due to other comorbid conditions, thromboprophylaxy with mechanical methods should be the treatment option. Whether thrombosis is the cause or the result of intestinal inflammation remains to be elucidated, and other issues in the etiology, such as the role of intestinal flora in thrombosis pathogenesis, will be the subject of future studies."
CD008201,0,10997967,0,Second malignancies in patients with essential thrombocythaemia treated with busulphan and hydroxyurea: long-term follow-up of a randomized clinical trial.,"We have previously demonstrated that hydroxyurea (HU) reduces the rate of vascular complications in patients with essential thrombocythaemia (ET) at high risk of thrombosis. However, the relatively short follow-up (median 27 months) did not enable the evaluation of the risk of developing secondary malignancies. In this study, we report the long-term outcome of the 114 patients included in the trial: 56 patients randomized to receive HU and 58 patients to receive no cytoreductive therapy. Before randomization, 15 patients had been treated with busulphan. During the observation period, 29 patients (50%) shifted from the control to the HU group mainly because of thrombosis. Median follow-up was 73 months (range 3-94). Analysis was by intention to treat and, when indicated, by treatment. When analysed by intention to treat, 46 out of 54 patients (85%) originally randomized in the HU group are alive, compared with 49 of 58 patients (84%) in the control group [not significant (n.s.)]. Five patients (9%) in the HU group and 26 patients (45%) in the control group had thrombosis (P < 0.0001). Seven patients (13%) in the HU group developed secondary acute leukaemia, myelodysplastic syndromes or solid tumours, compared with only one of the control group patients (1.7%) (P = 0.032). The occurrence of secondary malignancies was also analysed by treatment: none of the 20 patients who had never been treated with chemotherapy developed neoplasia vs. three of the 77 patients given HU only (3.9% n.s.) and five of the 15 patients given busulphan plus HU (33% P < 0. 0001). This study showed that: (a) HU reduced the risk of thrombosis in ET patients; (b) the sequential use of busulphan and HU significantly increased the risk of second malignancies; and (c) overall survival was not affected by HU therapy."
CD008201,0,24056815,0,"Long-term risks after splenectomy among 8,149 cancer-free American veterans: a cohort study with up to 27 years follow-up.","Although preservation of the spleen following abdominal trauma and spleen-preserving surgical procedures have become gold standards, about 22,000 splenectomies are still conducted annually in the USA. Infections, mostly by encapsulated organisms, are the most well-known complications following splenectomy. Recently, thrombosis and cancer have become recognized as potential adverse outcomes post-splenectomy. Among more than 4 million hospitalized USA veterans, we assessed incidence and mortality due to infections, thromboembolism, and cancer including 8,149 cancer-free veterans who underwent splenectomy with a follow-up of up to 27 years. Relative risk estimates and 95% confidence intervals were calculated using time-dependent Poisson regression methods for cohort data. Splenectomized patients had an increased risk of being hospitalized for pneumonia, meningitis, and septicemia (rate ratios=1.9-3.4); deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism (rate ratios=2.2); certain solid tumors: buccal, esophagus, liver, colon, pancreas, lung, and prostate (rate ratios =1.3-1.9); and hematologic malignancies: non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, multiple myeloma, acute myeloid leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, chronic myeloid leukemia, and any leukemia (rate ratios =1.8-6.0). They also had an increased risk of death due to pneumonia and septicemia (rate ratios =1.6-3.0); pulmonary embolism and coronary artery disease (rate ratios =1.4-4.5); any cancer: liver, pancreas, and lung cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, and any leukemia (rate ratios =1.3-4.7). Many of the observed risks were increased more than 10 years after splenectomy. Our results underscore the importance of vaccination, surveillance, and thromboprophylaxis after splenectomy."
CD008201,0,22519486,0,Multiple transvaginal ascitic fluid aspirations improves the clinical and reproductive outcome in patients undergoing in vitro fertilisation treatment complicated by severe early ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome.,"The objective of this study is to examine the effect of repeated transvaginal ascitic fluid aspiration on the reproductive outcome in patients undergoing in vitro fertilisation treatment complicated with severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. A total of 65 women with severe early OHSS were hospitalised and managed with transvaginal ascitic fluid aspiration either in < 3 occasions (control group; n = 29) or ≥ 3 occasions (multiple aspirations) (study group; n = 36). All patients in both groups received intravenous fluid, human albumin and thromboprophylaxis. Patients in the study group received significantly lower amounts of parenteral fluid (p < 0.05), human albumin (p < 0.01), and LMWH (p < 0.001). In addition, they had significantly lower days of hospitalisation (p < 0.01) as compared with the control group. There was no significant difference in the cancellation rate between the two groups, but patients who underwent multiple aspiration had a significantly higher pregnancy rate (82.8% vs 41.7%, p < 001) and significantly lower abortion rate (10.3% vs 40%, p < 0.05) compared with the control group. Repeated transvaginal asitic fluid aspiration even with large amounts is safe and effective in the treatment of symptomatic patients with severe OHSS. The pregnancy rate increased significantly along with a significant decrease in the abortion rate was observed after multiple aspirations compared with < 3 aspirations."

CD008201,0,23517138,0,Safety and efficacy of early pharmacological thromboprophylaxis in traumatic brain injury: systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) are at an increased risk of developing venous thromboembolic events (VTE). Pharmacological thromboprophylaxis (PTP) is routinely delayed because of concerns of exacerbating intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). The aim of this review is to examine the literature and assimilate suitable data to assess the safety and efficacy of PTP administered within 72 h in TBI patients. We systematically searched the literature for randomized controlled trials or cohort studies reporting on the timing of PTP in TBI. We dichotomized the timing of PTP to early and late at 72 h post-injury. The rates of VTE and ICH progression were our primary endpoints and were pooled using a fixed-effects model. A total of five retrospective cohort studies were included within the review including a total of 1624 patients, of which 713 received early PTP and 911 received late PTP. Within the early and late group there was a total of 43 and 106 VTE respectively, with a risk ratio of 0.52 (0.37, 0.73). Assessing safety, the relative risk of ICH progression in the early compared with the late PTP group was 0.64 (0.35, 1.14). Based on the available literature, we can tentatively conclude that early PTP (<72 h) reduces the risk of VTE without affecting progression of ICH. However, much work is yet to be done to better clarify ICH subtypes at risk of progression and the implementation of evidence-based guidelines backed up with randomized control trial level evidence."

CD008201,0,17341671,0,Optimal duration of prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism following total hip arthroplasty and total knee arthroplasty.,"Elective total hip arthroplasty and total knee arthroplasty are associated with a high risk of postoperative venous thromboembolism. Traditionally, antithrombotic prophylaxis has been administered during the hospital stay. However, with patients spending less time in the hospital after surgery, there is a need to continue thromboprophylaxis beyond hospital discharge. The current recommendation for prophylaxis in total joint arthroplasty patients is a minimum of 10 days, with extended prophylaxis up to 28 to 35 days following total hip arthroplasty. Prophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparins for approximately 4 weeks following hip arthroplasty has resulted in clinically significant reductions in the incidence of venographically confirmed deep vein thrombosis. Currently, no data support extended thromboprophylaxis beyond 10 days following total knee arthroplasty. Using weighted risk factors to assess individual risk for venous thromboembolism can help the physician determine the optimal duration of prophylaxis."
CD008201,0,16268468,0,Rates of proximal deep vein thrombosis as assessed by compression ultrasonography in patients receiving prolonged thromboprophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin after major orthopedic surgery.,"Patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery are at an increased risk of thromboembolism even after the acute postoperative phase. Therefore, prolonged thromboprophylaxis is currently recommended and widely used. The length of hospital stay after major orthopedic surgery is steadily decreasing and most patients are transferred to specialized rehabilitation centers in the early postoperative phase. Consequently, thromboprophylaxis is usually given during the rehabilitation period. Previously there have been no systematic studies of how many patients with asymptomatic thrombosis are transferred to a rehabilitation center or how many patients develop deep vein thrombosis (DVT) during rehabilitation. In the present study, 238 patients who had undergone major orthopedic surgery were examined by compression ultrasonography on day 1 or 2 and on day 20 of their rehabilitation phase in order to detect asymptomatic proximal DVT. Sonograms were read centrally with blinding to the clinical course of the patients. All patients received standard thromboprophylaxis during the acute postoperative phase. Prolonged thromboprophylaxis with enoxaparin was given during the rehabilitation phase. The mean duration of thromboprophylaxis was 36.8 days. At admission to the rehabilitation center, proximal DVT was identified in 16 patients (6.7%). New proximal DVT at discharge from the rehabilitation center was identified in 3.2% of patients following prolonged thromboprophylaxis with enoxaparin. In conclusion, a considerable percentage of patients with asymptomatic proximal DVT are transferred to rehabilitation centers following major orthopedic surgery. Using prolonged thromboprophylaxis, new proximal DVTs will still develop during rehabilitation, but at a low rate."

CD008201,0,12673925,0,[Prevention of thrombo-embolic venous disease].,"Large epidemiological studies have shown that nearly all risk factors for deep vein thromboses have a different impact on the manifestation of the disease, which aids in their differentiation into high, moderate and low risk. North American authors have introduced a fourth class of very high risk. The prophylactic measures available are numerous. They can be used in isolation or association depending on the significance of the risk. In France, prophylaxis by LMWH (low molecular weight heparin) is by far the most frequently used method. Recently, apart from compression stockings and intermittent mechanical compression, the use of footpumps, and a technique of electrical calf stimulation have been proposed. Each thrombosis center or service should put in place a well defined strategy for prescribing thromboprophylaxis, adapted to the level of the thromboembolic risk for each group of patients. A dose of LMWH higher than that used for a moderate risk is indicated for most LMWH, in the case of a high or very high risk. A few problems still exist: the pre or postoperative timing of the first injection, the duration of the prophylaxis particularly during the post-discharge period, and the evaluation of the risk in certain situations such as laparoscopic surgery or limb immobilization, for which the studies are too few to formulate recommendations from the level of evidence available. The socioeconomic realities of using LMWH should not be ignored."
CD008201,0,22439075,0,Antiphospholipid Syndrome during pregnancy: the state of the art.,"Obstetric complications are the hallmark of antiphospholipid syndrome. Recurrent miscarriage, early delivery, oligohydramnios, prematurity, intrauterine growth restriction, fetal distress, fetal or neonatal thrombosis, pre-eclampsia/eclampsia, HELLP syndrome, arterial or venous thrombosis and placental insufficiency are the most severe APS-related complication for pregnant women. Antiphospholipid antibodies promote activation of endothelial cells, monocytes and platelets, causing an overproduction of tissue factor and thromboxane A2. Complement activation might have a central pathogenetic role. These factors, associated with the typical changes in the hemostatic system during normal pregnancy, result in a hypercoagulable state. This is responsible of thrombosis that is presumed to provoke many of the pregnancy complications associated with APS. Obstetric care is based on combined medical-obstetric high-risk management and treatment with the association between aspirin and heparin. This review aims to deter- mine the current state of the art of APS by investigating the knowledge achievements of recent years, to provide the most appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic management for pregnant women suffering from this syndrome."
CD008201,0,23031461,0,Antithrombotic therapy.,"Thrombosis or thromboembolism are significant concerns in companion animals and can be associated with cardiac, metabolic, neoplastic disease processes or can be one manifestation of inflammatory, infectious, and neoplastic disease conditions. Options for thromboprophylaxis available for clinical use in small animal patients are very limited, with heparin (primarily unfractionated, but more recently low-molecular-weight forms) and aspirin predominating. Controlled studies evaluating the use of these drugs are few, but there is some limited evidence for efficacy in prevention of formation of thrombi. Use of the vitamin K antagonist warfarin has been described, but the narrow therapeutic window has resulted in a high rate of serious adverse events. In human patients, the efficacy of aspirin, heparins, and vitamin K antagonists is well documented in a variety of thrombotic conditions, but there are significant limitations to each of these options. These limitations have prompted the search for new alternatives, some of which are now in wide clinical use in humans. Although the use of some of the drugs discussed here has not yet been described in veterinary patients at risk for thrombosis, many of these agents have been evaluated experimentally in dogs, cats, or both. These new thromboprophylactic agents may soon be beneficial in management of small animal patients at risk for thrombosis."

The main causes of maternal mortality and morbidity in developed countries is venous thromboembolism (VTE) and obstetric complications. During pregnancy and puerperium the risk for VTE increases due to hemostatic imbalance towards a prothrombotic state, and it is further increased in women carriers of thrombophilia; recent studies have also demonstrated an association between thrombophilia and obstetric complications. These complications are, therefore, considered potentially preventable with the prophylactic administration of anticoagulant drugs, although their efficacy is not proven by data from randomized controlled trials. After a systematic comprehensive literature review and using a rigorous methodology, the expert panel formulated recommendations regarding the usefulness of screening for thrombophilia in pregnancy to identify high-risk women and for the management of antithrombotic prophyalxis.

CD008201,0,17698337,0,The parturient with coronary heart disease.,"Cardiac disease is one of the leading indirect causes of maternal mortality in the UK, exceeding numbers of direct deaths from thromboembolism and hypertension combined. Over one year in our unit we managed six women with coronary heart disease. In this series five women had stable coronary heart disease. Three delivered electively by caesarean section under combined spinal-epidural anaesthesia, a further two women had spontaneous vaginal deliveries, one planned under epidural analgesia, the second unplanned after a rapid labour. The sixth woman had unstable angina requiring percutaneous coronary intervention in the 28th week of pregnancy and went on to deliver by caesarean section under general anaesthesia. Regional anaesthesia was avoided in this case because of antiplatelet and anticoagulant medication. There is a lack of level-one evidence to direct the management of these women. Clinical decisions were directed by guidelines for the perioperative management of patients with cardiac disease in non-cardiac surgery and the management of all cardiac disease in the obstetric population. A multi-disciplinary approach was taken, with a collaborative plan made for each pregnancy and delivery. A thorough clinical history and examination together with transthoracic echocardiography allows risk stratification of women with coronary heart disease at risk of peripartum cardiac events. Further investigation specific to each woman's management can then be undertaken."

CD008201,0,19861324,0,Carotid artery stenting vs. endarterectomy.,"Randomized clinical trials have demonstrated that carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is superior to medical management for stroke prevention in patients with symptomatic and, to a lesser degree, asymptomatic internal carotid artery stenosis. However, large-scale registries have shown that the adverse event rates following CEA are commonly higher than observed in the trials. In the last decade, carotid artery stenting (CAS) has emerged as a less invasive alternative to surgery. In order to address the efficacy of CAS, we performed a meta-analysis of 10 randomized trials comparing CAS with CEA in 4648 mainly symptomatic patients. The analysis showed that CAS was associated with a statistically significant increased death or stroke rate at 30 days compared with CEA (odds ratio 1.60, 95% confidence interval 1.26-2.02). However, most of the trials had inadequate requirements in terms of endovascular expertise and did not mandate the use of emboli protection devices. Beyond 30 days, long-term follow-up of the trials previously reported suggest that both revascularization techniques are equivalent in terms of stroke prevention. Conversely, large-scale high-quality CAS registries--mostly with independent neurological assessment and clinical event committee adjudication--have reported results in the range of current recommendation for CEA in over 20 000 patients, despite the fact that the majority of patients were at high risk for surgery. Until further data become available, the performance of CAS should be limited to protocols or centres of excellence and targeted especially to patients at high risk for surgery."
CD008201,0,6829920,0,Thromboembolism after total hip replacement: role of epidural and general anesthesia.,"The effects of continuous epidural anesthesia and of general anesthesia on the incidence of thromboembolism following total hip replacement were studied. Sixty patients were randomly allotted to one of two groups receiving either epidural or general anesthesia. Epidural anesthesia (N = 30) consisted of 0.5% bupivacaine with epinephrine intraoperatively; for pain relief in the postoperative period (24 h), 0.25% bupivacaine with epinephrine was given every 3 h. General anesthesia (N = 30) consisted of controlled ventilation with N2O-O2 and intravenous fentanyl and pancuronium bromide; postoperatively, narcotic analgesics were given intramuscularly on demand for pain relief. Significantly lower frequencies were found following epidural anesthesia than after general anesthesia in deep venous thrombosis involving the popliteal and femoral veins (13% and 67%, respectively), deep venous thrombosis involving both calf and thigh veins (40% and 77%), and pulmonary embolism (10% and 33%). Possible explanations for these differences include increased circulation in the lower extremities, less tendency for intravascular clotting to occur, and more efficient fibrinolysis in association with continuous epidural anesthesia. The decrease in blood loss associated with epidural anesthesia with lower transfusion requirements also might play a role. Epidural analgesia prolonged into the postoperative period, in addition to other appropriate thromboprophylactic measures, should be of value in patients undergoing operations associated with a high risk of thromboembolic complications."
CD008201,0,25374012,0,Emerging therapy options in heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.,"Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a life and limb-threatening thrombotic complication of heparin, which is the result of platelet activation by anti-PF4/heparin antibodies. With lepirudin and danaparoid no longer available in the US, treatment options are limited to argatroban, fondaparinux (off-label use) and bivalirudin (for patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention). Both argatroban and bivalirudin are parenteral drugs and require close monitoring and hospitalization. Fondaparinux is contraindicated in patients with significant renal impairment and is associated with a small risk of HIT. Anticoagulants approved for thromboprophylaxis and management of thromboembolic conditions such as rivaroxaban, dabigatran, and apixaban have fixed oral dose, rapid onset of action and does not require monitoring. These novel agents do not interact with anti-PF4/heparin antibody and offer attractive therapy options for HIT. Their utility in HIT has been supported by a few clinical reports, however, larger studies are needed before they can be utilized in clinical practice. Therapeutic plasma exchange has been utilized with some success in patients with HIT, who need heparin reexposure for cardiac surgery but their safety and efficacy needs further exploration. 2-O, 3-O desulfated heparin, which lacks any anticoagulant effect, has been shown to reduce the development of HIT in murine models. Finally, novel targets based on the molecular pathogenesis of HIT are being studied for therapeutic drug development. We hope that the availability of novel therapies in the future will expand the options available for the management of HIT."

Screening is only recommended for patients with high-risk injuries who are unable to receive pharmacologic prophylaxis. However, the prevalence of lower extremity DVT (LEDVT) in trauma patients may be higher than reported in previous studies as many studies on DVT screening have not investigated calf vein DVTs (CVDVT) and have not exclusively targeted critically ill patients. Given that current ACCP guidelines recommend treatment of CVDVTs, we investigated the efficacy of duplex ultrasound (DUS) screening in critically ill trauma patients for all LEDVTs, including CVDVT, regardless of injury pattern, risk factors, or pharmacologic prophylaxis."
CD008201,0,16525969,0,Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in colorectal surgery.,"Patients who undergo colorectal surgery are at a substantially higher risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) than their general surgery counterparts. The incidence of DVT in colorectal surgery patients who do not receive prophylaxis is approximately 30%; a four-fold increase exists in the incidence of pulmonary embolism. The precise reasons for the increased risk are uncertain; likely, contributing factors are the need for pelvic dissection, patient positioning (eg, use of stirrups), and indications for surgery (eg, inflammatory bowel disease, cancer). Despite the clear evidence that supports the safety and efficacy of DVT prophylaxis, appropriate preventive measures are frequently not used. Heparin preparations and mechanical compression in combination likely represents the most appropriate prophylactic regimen in these high-risk patients. Standard heparin appears to be as effective as low-molecular-weight heparin and considerably less costly. In the presence of relatively poor adherence to consensus guidelines for prophylaxis, critical pathways or electronic alerts may be useful to facilitate compliance with appropriate preventive measures."
CD008201,0,11818319,0,Embolus location affects the sensitivity of a rapid quantitative D-dimer assay in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism.,"D-dimer blood tests have been suggested to rule out pulmonary embolism. Despite evidence of the safety of withholding anticoagulant treatment in patients with suspected pulmonary embolism and a normal D-dimer assay result, clinicians remain reluctant to use a D-dimer assay as a sole diagnostic test. This prospective study in 314 consecutive inpatients and outpatients investigates the relation between the diagnostic accuracy of D-dimer plasma concentration and pulmonary embolus location. Plasma D-dimer levels were measured using a quantitative immunoturbidimetric method. A strict protocol of ventilation-perfusion scintigraphy, pulmonary angiography, and spiral computed tomography was used to arrive at a final diagnosis and to assess the largest pulmonary artery in which embolus was visible. The influence of embolus location on the diagnostic accuracy was evaluated using the Kruskal-Wallis test and receiver operator characteristics (ROC) analysis. There was a strong correlation between plasma D-dimer concentration and embolus location (Kruskal-Wallis, p < 0.001). Thus, the assay showed greater accuracy in excluding segmental or larger emboli (sensitivity = 93%) than subsegmental emboli (sensitivity = 50%). D-dimer concentration and the accuracy of D-dimer assays are clearly dependent on embolus location and smaller, subsegmental emboli may be missed when D-dimer assays are used as a sole test to exclude pulmonary embolism."

CD008201,0,21804774,0,"Cardioembolic stroke: clinical features, specific cardiac disorders and prognosis.","This article provides the reader with an overview and up-date of clinical features, specific cardiac disorders and prognosis of cardioembolic stroke. Cardioembolic stroke accounts for 14-30% of ischemic strokes and, in general, is a severe condition; patients with cardioembolic infarction are prone to early and long-term stroke recurrence, although recurrences may be preventable by appropriate treatment during the acute phase and strict control at follow-up. Certain clinical features are suggestive of cardioembolic infarction, including sudden onset to maximal deficit, decreased level of consciousness at onset, Wernicke's aphasia or global aphasia without hemiparesis, a Valsalva manoeuvre at the time of stroke onset, and co-occurrence of cerebral and systemic emboli. Lacunar clinical presentations, a lacunar infarct and especially multiple lacunar infarcts, make cardioembolic origin unlikely. The more common high risk cardioembolic conditions are atrial fibrillation, recent myocardial infarction, mechanical prosthetic valve, dilated myocardiopathy, and mitral rheumatic stenosis. Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiogram can disclose structural heart diseases. Paroxysmal atrial dysrhyhtmia can be detected by Holter monitoring. In-hospital mortality in cardioembolic stroke (27.3%, in our series) is the highest as compared with other subtypes of cerebral infarction. In our experience, in-hospital mortality in patients with early embolic recurrence (within the first 7 days) was 77%. Patients with alcohol abuse, hypertension, valvular heart disease, nausea and vomiting, and previous cerebral infarction are at increased risk of early recurrent systemic embolization. Secondary prevention with anticoagulants should be started immediately if possible in patients at high risk for recurrent cardioembolic stroke in which contraindications, such as falls, poor compliance, uncontrolled epilepsy or gastrointestinal bleeding are absent."

The clinical data regarding a case of jugular vein thrombosis, subclavian vein and the right brachiocephalic vein thrombosis in IVF-ET were reviewed. Clinical characteristics, prevention and treatment of jugular vein thrombosis, subclavian vein and the right brachiocephalic vein thrombosis in IVF-ET were discussed. A woman with secondary infertility underwent an IVF cycle with prolonged protocol controlled ovarian hyperstimulation. The oestradial concentration was 2 495 pg/mL on the day of human chorionic goeadotrophin (hCG). Fifteen occytes were retrieved and 2 embryos were transferred. Nine days after the embryos were transferred, the patient had ascites,hydrothorax and fluid of pelvic cavity accumulating, and was hospitalized. The patient underwent volume expansion and paracentesis, and left the hospital 30 days after the embryo transfer. Her right neck had pain 43 days after the embryo transfer. B ultrasound showed jugular vein thrombosis, subclavian vein and the right brachiocephalic vein thrombosis. The patient underwent low molecular weight heparin anticoagulation and low molecular weight dextran expansion, and left hospital with symptoms improved. She had Caesarean section and had a healthy baby girl. The thrombosis in the IVF-ET was a rare and serious complication. Prevention of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) may reduce the incidence. The patients had local pain, swelling, skin temperature increased, headache, neck pain, and had to be checked to determine whether there were blood clots. The main treatment was low molecular weight heparin anticoagulation and low molecular weight dextran expansion. Timely Cesarean section is recommended to ensure the safety of perinatal mother and child."
CD008201,0,8841738,0,Recognition and treatment of unstable angina.,"Despite the growing number of patients discharged from hospital with a diagnosis of unstable angina, the diagnostic procedures and treatment of unstable angina are still greatly debated, as they have been for patients with myocardial infarction. In recent years the definition and classification of the clinical syndrome of unstable angina has been subjected to numerous proposals by distinguished cardiologists. An attempt to clarify and redefine practical guidelines for different subgroups of patients has been developed and carried out by the US Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR). The current medical approach to treatment of patients with unstable angina is discussed in detail, analysing the role of antiplatelet medications, beta-blockers, nitrates, heparin and calcium antagonists. The small subgroup of patients with refractory unstable angina should undergo urgent coronary angiography and revascularisation. Previous and current research on medical treatment with thrombolytic therapy, GPIIb/IIIa platelet receptor blockers and direct thrombin inhibitors is outlined, keeping in mind one of the main aspects of pathophysiology of the disease, that is ongoing thrombus formation. In the future, a more aggressive strategy aimed at normalising the atherogenic lipid profile in this very high risk group of patients should be carried out, based on the positive results of lipid-lowering drug trials both in primary and secondary prevention."

CD008201,0,21402235,0,[Initial antithrombotic therapy for pulmonary embolism].,"The initial therapy for patients with pulmonary embolism who are haemodynamically stable relies on antithrombotic treatment. The aim of anticoagulant treatment is to prevent any thrombus extension or recurrence, with revascularization dependent on the fibrinolytic system. Current treatment is biphasic, with parenteral heparin or derivatives (low molecular weight heparins and fondaparinux) followed by oral vitamin K antagonists. Although these treatments are efficient, they suffer from some limitations including parenteral administration and the need for surveillance and monitoring. Use of low molecular weight heparins or fondaparinux is recommended in French guidelines, but unfractionated heparin still has an important role in some specific situations such as severe renal insufficiency, around the time of surgery and where there is a high risk of bleeding. The next generation of anticoagulants will soon be licensed for treatment in pulmonary embolism and may well replace heparin and/or vitamin K antagonists for the majority of patients, although ""older"" treatments will always be requested in some specific situations."

International Electrotechnical Commission guidelines for infusion pumps permit infusion of up to 1 mL in 15 minutes and discount bubbles smaller than 50 μL. A review of the literature, however, suggests that these limits may be too generous. Neonates and patients with right-to-left cardiac shunts (eg, patent foramen ovale [PFO]) are at risk from lower volumes. Because PFO is prevalent in 20% to 27% of healthy adults and generally asymptomatic, all patients are at risk from small air bubbles, although clinically significant air embolism from intravenous infusion is rare.

Nephrectomy versus embolisation].,"The early diagnosis of the graft intolerance syndrome or a subclinical state of chronic inflammation due to a failed kidney allograft, is one of the goals that the nephrologists must fulfill to take a series of measures directed to solve this situation. Fever, haematuria, local pain and/or tenderness are the main clinical criteria to make a diagnosis. However, oftenly there are not any clinical symptoms and only the presence of parameters of chronic inflammation (elevated C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, hypoalbuminemia and anemia resistant to erythropoietin therapy) are signs of this entity. Maintenance of immunosuppressive treatment is not advisable due to the risk of infections as well as the increase in cardiovascular risk (level evidence A). Transplantectomy is the best treatment if there are some associated complications such as allograft infection, neoplasia or high risk of graft rupture. However, surgical treatment is not exempt from risks and it is associated to a considerable rate of complications, with the consequent prolongation of the hospitalization stay. Therefore it is desirable to use less invasive procedures, such as embolization. This could be the first step unless the conditions enumerated in point 3 come up (Level evidence B). It is desirable to use prophylactic antibiotic before the embolization to avoid infectious complications (Level evidence B)."

CD008201,0,23378374,0,Venous thrombosis in athletes.,"Because deep vein thrombosis (DVT) can occur following orthopaedic procedures, knowledge of hereditary and acquired risk factors for DVT is essential. Hereditary forms of thrombophilia include factor V Leiden and prothrombin G20210A mutations, and deficiencies of antithrombin III, protein C, and protein S. Acquired risk factors include but are not limited to trauma, immobilization, and surgical procedures. In general, athletes have a low risk of venous thrombosis; however, this population is exposed to many acquired thrombogenic risk factors, including hemoconcentration, trauma, immobilization, long-distance travel, and the use of oral contraceptives. Thus, orthopaedic surgeons should consider screening athletes for thrombogenic risk factors, including history of venous thrombosis, hypercoagulable disorders, or high altitude exercise, during preparticipation physicals and preoperative examinations. If a patient is determined to be at high risk of DVT, preventive measures such as physical antithrombotic measures and/or low-molecular-weight heparin should be instituted. If an athlete develops a DVT, a risk factor assessment should be conducted along with anticoagulation treatment in accordance with the American College of Chest Physicians guidelines."

Several factors have been found to increase the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in cancer patients both during the first days after the operation and after discharge from hospital. Although, in general, thromboprophylaxis is provided to cancer patients after surgery, the length of time these patients require prophylaxis has not yet been established. Autopsy series, clinical series, and clinical trials indicate that up to about 40% of VTE occurs post discharge. General surgical patients undergoing major abdominal surgery require VTE prophylaxis, and prolonged thromboprophylaxis should be considered in the post-discharge period in high-risk patients, particularly those with cancer. Evidence from studies in general and orthopedic surgery show that prolonged prophylaxis reduces the number of thromboembolic events after discharge from hospital. Prophylaxis should be simple, safe, and effective and should be administered easily to allow continuation of therapy after discharge. Low-molecular-weight heparins are potentially the most suitable agents for long-term thromboprophylaxis in cancer patients."

CD008201,0,26417980,0,Diagnosis and management of nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage: European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) Guideline.,"This Guideline is an official statement of the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE). It addresses the diagnosis and management of nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage (NVUGIH). Main Recommendations MR1. ESGE recommends immediate assessment of hemodynamic status in patients who present with acute upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage (UGIH), with prompt intravascular volume replacement initially using crystalloid fluids if hemodynamic instability exists (strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence). MR2. ESGE recommends a restrictive red blood cell transfusion strategy that aims for a target hemoglobin between 7 g/dL and 9 g/dL. A higher target hemoglobin should be considered in patients with significant co-morbidity (e. g., ischemic cardiovascular disease) (strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence). MR3. ESGE recommends the use of the Glasgow-Blatchford Score (GBS) for pre-endoscopy risk stratification. Outpatients determined to be at very low risk, based upon a GBS score of 0 - 1, do not require early endoscopy nor hospital admission. Discharged patients should be informed of the risk of recurrent bleeding and be advised to maintain contact with the discharging hospital (strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence). MR4. ESGE recommends initiating high dose intravenous proton pump inhibitors (PPI), intravenous bolus followed by continuous infusion (80 mg then 8 mg/hour), in patients presenting with acute UGIH awaiting upper endoscopy. However, PPI infusion should not delay the performance of early endoscopy (strong recommendation, high quality evidence). MR5. ESGE does not recommend the routine use of nasogastric or orogastric aspiration/lavage in patients presenting with acute UGIH (strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence). MR6. ESGE recommends intravenous erythromycin (single dose, 250 mg given 30 - 120 minutes prior to upper gastrointestinal [GI] endoscopy) in patients with clinically severe or ongoing active UGIH. In selected patients, pre-endoscopic infusion of erythromycin significantly improves endoscopic visualization, reduces the need for second-look endoscopy, decreases the number of units of blood transfused, and reduces duration of hospital stay (strong recommendation, high quality evidence). MR7. Following hemodynamic resuscitation, ESGE recommends early (≤ 24 hours) upper GI endoscopy. Very early (< 12 hours) upper GI endoscopy may be considered in patients with high risk clinical features, namely: hemodynamic instability (tachycardia, hypotension) that persists despite ongoing attempts at volume resuscitation; in-hospital bloody emesis/nasogastric aspirate; or contraindication to the interruption of anticoagulation (strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence). MR8. ESGE recommends that peptic ulcers with spurting or oozing bleeding (Forrest classification Ia and Ib, respectively) or with a nonbleeding visible vessel (Forrest classification IIa) receive endoscopic hemostasis because these lesions are at high risk for persistent bleeding or rebleeding (strong recommendation, high quality evidence). MR9. ESGE recommends that peptic ulcers with an adherent clot (Forrest classification IIb) be considered for endoscopic clot removal. Once the clot is removed, any identified underlying active bleeding (Forrest classification Ia or Ib) or nonbleeding visible vessel (Forrest classification IIa) should receive endoscopic hemostasis (weak recommendation, moderate quality evidence). MR10. In patients with peptic ulcers having a flat pigmented spot (Forrest classification IIc) or clean base (Forrest classification III), ESGE does not recommend endoscopic hemostasis as these stigmata present a low risk of recurrent bleeding. In selected clinical settings, these patients may be discharged to home on standard PPI therapy, e. g., oral PPI once-daily (strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence). MR11. ESGE recommends that epinephrine injection therapy not be used as endoscopic monotherapy. If used, it should be combined with a second endoscopic hemostasis modality (strong recommendation, high quality evidence). MR12. ESGE recommends PPI therapy for patients who receive endoscopic hemostasis and for patients with adherent clot not receiving endoscopic hemostasis. PPI therapy should be high dose and administered as an intravenous bolus followed by continuous infusion (80 mg then 8 mg/hour) for 72 hours post endoscopy (strong recommendation, high quality evidence). MR13. ESGE does not recommend routine second-look endoscopy as part of the management of nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage (NVUGIH). However, in patients with clinical evidence of rebleeding following successful initial endoscopic hemostasis, ESGE recommends repeat upper endoscopy with hemostasis if indicated. In the case of failure of this second attempt at hemostasis, transcatheter angiographic embolization (TAE) or surgery should be considered (strong recommendation, high quality evidence). MR14. In patients with NVUGIH secondary to peptic ulcer, ESGE recommends investigating for the presence of Helicobacter pylori in the acute setting with initiation of appropriate antibiotic therapy when H. pylori is detected. Re-testing for H. pylori should be performed in those patients with a negative test in the acute setting. Documentation of successful H. pylori eradication is recommended (strong recommendation, high quality evidence). MR15. In patients receiving low dose aspirin for secondary cardiovascular prophylaxis who develop peptic ulcer bleeding, ESGE recommends aspirin be resumed immediately following index endoscopy if the risk of rebleeding is low (e. g., FIIc, FIII). In patients with high risk peptic ulcer (FIa, FIb, FIIa, FIIb), early reintroduction of aspirin by day 3 after index endoscopy is recommended, provided that adequate hemostasis has been established (strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence)."
CD008201,0,11111993,0,"Vascular complications following bladder drained, simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplantation: the University of Miami experience.","Vascular complications remain a significant nonimmunologic source of pancreas allograft loss. From February 1993 through January 1998, we performed 98 simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplantations (SPK) using pancreatic exocrine bladder drainage in patients with type 1 insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and end-stage renal disease. They originally received quadruple immunosuppression, and since May 1997 triple immunosuppression protocol (tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and steroids). The patients' mean age was 37 years (range 24-53 years), including 50 women and 48 men with a mean follow-up of 42 months. The overall rate of vascular complications was 6% (5 patients). The vascular complications were as follows: late thrombosis of the Y with persistent pancreas allograft function (n = 1), rupture of a pseudoaneurysm of the superior mesenteric artery (PSMA) with an arteriovenous fistula (AVF) (n = 1), thrombosis of the splenic vein (SV) (n = 3), complete thrombosis of the superior mesenteric vein (SMV) and splenic vein (n = 1). The patient with PSMA underwent surgical correction of the AVF and PSMA with preservation of the allograft pancreas function. The other patient with late thrombosis of the Y-graft required no treatment. All 3 patients with SV thrombosis were systemically heparinized followed by oral anticoagulation. The patient with complete thrombosis required surgical thrombectomy of the SMV and SV followed by heparinization and oral anticoagulation. All 6 patients including the 4 with thrombosis had preservation of the pancreas function. Serial pancreas ultrasound showed resolution and improvement with recanalization of the splenic vein and superior mesenteric vein in those patients with thrombosis. We describe our vascular experience with salvage of the pancreatic allograft function. Surgery seems to be the best treatment option in the case of AVF or complete thrombosis of the allograft. Intravenous heparin followed by oral anticoagultion could be a conservative approach for SV thrombosis."
CD008201,0,23866358,0,"Bleeding with dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban. No antidote, and little clinical experience.","Dabigatran, rivaroxaban and apixaban are oral anticoagulants used to prevent or treat thrombosis in a variety of situations. Like all anticoagulants, these drugs can provoke bleeding. How should patients be managed if bleeding occurs during dabigatran, rivaroxaban or apixaban therapy? How can the risk of bleeding be reduced in patients who require surgery or other invasive procedures? To answer these questions, we reviewed the available literature, using the standard Prescrire methodology. In clinical trials, warfarin, enoxaparin, dabigatran, rivaroxaban and apixaban were associated with a similar frequency of severe bleeding. Numerous reports of severe bleeding associated with dabigatran have been recorded since this drug was first marketed. Some situations are associated with a particularly high bleeding risk, including: even mild renal failure, advanced age, extremes in body weight and drug-drug interactions, particularly with antiplatelet agents (including aspirin), nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, and many drugs used in cardiovascular indications. In patients treated with dabigatran, rivaroxaban or apixaban, changes in the INR (international normalised ratio) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) do not correlate with the dose. In early 2013, there is still no routine coagulation test suitable for monitoring these patients; specific tests are only available in specialised laboratories. In early 2013 there is no antidote for dabigatran, rivaroxaban or apixaban, nor any specific treatment with proven efficacy for severe bleeding linked to these drugs. Recommendations on the management of bleeding in this setting are based mainly on pharmacological parameters and on scarce experimen-Haemodialysis reduces the plasma concentration of dabigatran, while rivaroxaban and apixaban cannot be eliminated by dialysis. Prothrombin complex concentrates and recombinant activated factor VII seem to have little or no efficacy, and they carry a poorly documented risk of thrombosis. For patients undergoing surgery or other invasive procedures, clinical practice guidelines are primarily based on pharmacokinetic parameters and on extrapolation of data on vitamin K antagonists. The decision on whether or not to discontinue anticoagulation before the procedure mainly depends on the likely risk of bleeding. In patients at high risk of thrombosis, heparin can be proposed when the anticoagulant is withdrawn. In early 2013, difficulties in the management of bleeding and of situations in which there is a risk of bleeding weigh heavily in the balance of potential harm versus potential benefit of dabigatran, rivaroxaban and apixaban. When an oral anticoagulant is required, it is best to choose warfarin, a vitamin K antagonist, and the drug with which we have the most experience, except in those rare situations in which the INR cannot be maintained within the therapeutic range."
CD008201,0,24596651,0,Percutaneous methods of left atrial appendage exclusion: an alternative to the internist.,"Thromboembolic stroke from the left atrial appendage (LAA) is the most feared complication in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). The cornerstone for the management of chronic non-valvular AF is stroke reduction with oral anticoagulation (OAC). However, poor compliance, maintaining a narrow therapeutic window, and major side effects such as bleeding have severely limited their use, which creates a therapeutic dilemma. As much as 20% of AF patients are not receiving OAC due to contraindications and less than half of AF patients are not on OAC due to reluctance of the prescribing physician and/or patient non-compliance. Fortunately, over the past decade, there have been great interests in providing an alternative strategy unbeknownst to the practicing internist. The introduction of percutaneous approaches for LAA occlusion has added a different dimension to the management of chronic AF in patients with OAC intolerance. Occlusion devices such as the Amplatzer Cardiac Plug and WATCHMAN device are currently being investigated for stroke prophylaxis. More recently, the LARIAT device may provide an alternative means for potential stroke prophylaxis without the need for short-term post-procedural OAC. We aim to review the current literature and bring attention to an alternative strategy for high-risk AF patients intolerant to OAC."
CD008201,0,12814331,0,Benefit-risk assessment of treatments for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.,"Patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) are at high risk of thrombosis and should be treated with alternative anticoagulant therapy to reduce complications. The current treatment of choice is one of the approved direct thrombin inhibitors, argatroban or lepirudin. These drugs have been proven to be safe and effective in multicentre clinical trials where dosage regimens have been established for prophylaxis and treatment of thrombosis. Argatroban has also been tested and approved for use in invasive cardiology procedures in the HIT patient. Dosage regimens for other clinical uses, such as cardiac surgery, have not yet been established for either drug. The safety and effectiveness of the thrombin inhibitors is dependent on their use according to established guidelines. Other treatment options that may be effective for the patient with HIT include dextran, plasmapheresis, intravenous gammaglobulin and aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid). Although used historically, these options have not been tested in rigorous clinical trials. For life- and limb-threatening thrombosis, thrombolytic agents and/or surgery may provide benefit. Because the risk of bleeding is high from these procedures, they should be performed only by an experienced practitioner. Several studies have shown that patients with HIT requiring continued anticoagulation are best managed with a warfarin derivative initiated while under full anticoagulation with a thrombin inhibitor. There is a risk of skin necrosis and bleeding if guidelines for dose administration and monitoring of warfarin are not followed. Subsequent use of heparin or a low molecular weight heparin after resolution of the clinical episode of HIT can be hazardous, particularly within the first 3 months. If laboratory testing is negative, heparin may be cautiously reinstituted for short-term use (1-2 hours) with monitoring for platelet count decrease and thromboembolism. The pregnant patient with HIT requiring anticoagulation represents a particular challenge, where there is no drug of choice at present. Although today there are realistic treatment options for the patient with HIT, the morbidity and mortality associated with this disease have not been eliminated. Awareness and early treatment of HIT remain important components of the clinical care for patients exposed to heparins. Future therapeutic developments based on a better understanding of the pathophysiology of HIT may further improve clinical outcomes. Despite some limitations, the current treatment options for patients with HIT provide unparalleled benefit compared with the treatment options available only a few years ago."

This study assessed real-world inpatient and outpatient thromboprophylaxis practices following knee or hip arthroplasty. Patients from the Henry Ford Health System aged ≥18 years undergoing knee and hip arthroplasty (January 1997-June 2007) were identified using Current Procedural Terminology codes from administrative databases. Patients with <18 months of continuous enrollment in the system's health maintenance organization or with a current diagnosis of atrial fibrillation were excluded. Both inpatient and outpatient pharmacological prophylaxis was assessed. The analysis included 1393 (58.5%) patients following knee arthroplasty and 989 (41.5%) following hip arthroplasty. Average length of hospitalization was 4.9 days over the study period, although the median stay decreased from 5 days in 1997 to 3 days in 2007. Of patients included, 72.7% received pharmacological prophylaxis only in the inpatient setting following knee arthroplasty and 73.9% following hip arthroplasty. Both inpatient and outpatient pharmacological prophylaxis was received by 12.5% of knee and 12.3% of hip arthroplasty patients. Total length of pharmacological prophylaxis fluctuated between 2 to 4 days between 1997 and 2005, but increased to 11.5 ± 9.0 days in 2007. Although the duration of prophylaxis has recently increased, considerable numbers of hip and knee arthroplasty patients only receive prophylaxis for part of the time period recommended by guidelines. Further efforts are required to ensure the recommended duration of thromboprophylaxis is prescribed to all patients and continued outpatient VTE prophylaxis is provided."
CD008201,0,18574269,0,The perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy: American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines (8th Edition).,"This article discusses the perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy and is part of the American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines (8th Edition). The primary objectives of this article are the following: (1) to address the perioperative management of patients who are receiving vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) or antiplatelet drugs, such as aspirin and clopidogrel, and require an elective surgical or other invasive procedures; and (2) to address the perioperative use of bridging anticoagulation, typically with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) or unfractionated heparin (UFH). A secondary objective is to address the perioperative management of such patients who require urgent surgery. The recommendations in this article incorporate the grading system that is discussed in this supplement (Guyatt G et al, CHEST 2008; 133:123S-131S). Briefly, Grade 1 recommendations are considered strong and indicate that the benefits do (or do not) outweigh risks, burden, and costs, whereas Grade 2 recommendations are referred to as suggestions and imply that individual patient values may lead to different management choices. The key recommendations in this article include the following: in patients with a mechanical heart valve or atrial fibrillation or venous thromboembolism (VTE) at high risk for thromboembolism, we recommend bridging anticoagulation with therapeutic-dose subcutaneous (SC) LMWH or IV UFH over no bridging during temporary interruption of VKA therapy (Grade 1C); in patients with a mechanical heart valve or atrial fibrillation or VTE at moderate risk for thromboembolism, we suggest bridging anticoagulation with therapeutic-dose SC LMWH, therapeutic-dose IV UFH, or low-dose SC LMWH over no bridging during temporary interruption of VKA therapy (Grade 2C); in patients with a mechanical heart valve or atrial fibrillation or VTE at low risk for thromboembolism, we suggest low-dose SC LMWH or no bridging over bridging with therapeutic-dose SC LMWH or IV UFH (Grade 2C). In patients with a bare metal coronary stent who require surgery within 6 weeks of stent placement, we recommend continuing aspirin and clopidogrel in the perioperative period (Grade 1C); in patients with a drug-eluting coronary stent who require surgery within 12 months of stent placement, we recommend continuing aspirin and clopidogrel in the perioperative period (Grade 1C). In patients who are undergoing minor dental procedures and are receiving VKAs, we recommend continuing VKAs around the time of the procedure and co-administering an oral prohemostatic agent (Grade 1B); in patients who are undergoing minor dermatologic procedures and are receiving VKAs, we recommend continuing VKAs around the time of the procedure (Grade 1C); in patients who are undergoing cataract removal and are receiving VKAs, we recommend continuing VKAs around the time of the procedure (Grade 1C)."

Investigation has traditionally required expensive imaging procedures that are frequently nondiagnostic. Consequently, current practice favors noninvasive diagnosis of PE using algorithms combining risk assessment and d-dimer. Despite the proven safety of this approach, concern persists about such strategies to exclude PE, largely due to variable d-dimer sensitivity.

We conducted a retrospective review of consecutive patients prescribed dabigatran, rivaroxaban or apixaban prior to inpatient hospitalization over an 18-month period to examine the off-label prescribing frequency, contraindications and related complications. Chart review included baseline demographics, hospital admitting service, outpatient prescribing service, renal function, therapeutic indication, echocardiographic findings, contraindications, major bleeding events and vital status. We identified 160 patients who received a target-specific oral anticoagulant prior to hospitalization. Over half (53.1%) of the patients received rivaroxaban, 43.7% received dabigatran and 3.1% received apixaban. Atrial fibrillation (68.1%) and venous thromboembolism treatment (25.6%) were the most common indications. Ninety percent of patients had a U.S. Foods and Drugs Administration (FDA)-approved indication for therapy. Major bleeding events occurred in 4.4% of patients. Cardiology was the most common prescribing and admitting service (43.8 and 31.3%), and more frequently adhered to FDA-approved indications (97 vs. 84%, P = 0.01). There were no significant differences between prescribing services regarding major contraindications (P = 0.14) and major bleeding events (P = 0.77). Off-label prescription rates for target-specific oral anticoagulants were infrequent and not associated with increased adverse events."

The procedure involved vena cava filter placement in patients with neoplasia and high risk of TEPA as compared with controls receiving conservative therapy alone. A positive correlation was established between surgery and/or polychemotherapy, on the one hand, and higher stage and high risk of TEPA, on the other. Patients with deep venous thrombosis and neoplasia were referred to groups of extremely high risk of that pathology. Angiological history, physical examination and ultrasound check-ups of the lower vein must be carried out in cancer patients. Vena cava filter placement proved to be an effective and safe measure of TEPA prophylaxis. It lowered the risk of lethal outcome in 24 during surgery and polychemotherapy. Lethality rate among controls was 43.5 +/- 0.51%."

For both thrombotic events, he was successfully managed with thrombolytic therapy and percutaneous thrombectomy using a transcatheter hydraulic thrombectomy device under temporary placement of a retrievable IVC filter. Stasis of the IVC due to compression by a retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy of 7 cm in diameter, which was demonstrated on computed tomographic scans at presentation, was considered a major cause of DVT during chemotherapy.

CD008201,0,16104621,0,[Drug eluting stents: from evidence based medicine to clinical practice].,"Drug eluting stents have been developed in order to reduce in-stent restenosis observed with a 20 to 40% rate in bare-stents. Neoinitimal smooth muscular cells proliferation have been characterized as the corner stone of in-stent restenosis. Consequently, many anti-mitotic and anti-inflammatory drugs have been evaluated in a new stent generation, so called coated stents or drug eluting stents. Three major components must be considered to evaluate the beneficial effects: the bare-stent, the drug, and the deliverance system, most usually a polymer. For the present, sirolimus eluting stent and paclitaxel eluting stent are available in the market with the european conformity label considering evidence based medicine established in randomized trials. Both stents have been shown to reduce in-stent restenosis incidence to less than 7%. Long-term follow-up still remain expected and would give answers to two safety queries: what is about the incidence of late stent thrombosis, what is about mal-apposition consequences in clinical feature. Utilization of drug eluting stent in clinical practice must considered materials with european conformity and must applied French society of cardiology guidelines restricting implantation to patients who meet high-risk restenosis criteria. Medicoeconomic approach must be considered beneficial at the present only in patients with high restenosis risk.

CD008201,0,21266809,0,Gastrointestinal bleeding after percutaneous coronary intervention.,"Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is now performed in a wide range of patients with coronary artery disease. Complications of PCI include in-stent re-stenosis and in-stent thrombosis. According to the recent 2005 guidelines of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions, dual antiplatelet therapy with low-dose aspirin and thienopyridine derivatives such as ticlopidine and clopidogrel should be used in patients who have undergone PCI. A serious complication of dual antiplatelet therapy is bleeding, most of which arise from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. In this article we review published studies about GI bleeding in patients who have undergone PCI. The prevalence of GI bleeding in patients who are administered dual antiplatelet therapy following PCI is approximately 2%, and GI bleeding after PCI is associated with increased morbidity, mortality, duration of hospitalization and cost. Advanced age, a history of peptic ulcer disease, co-administration of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, co-administration of anticoagulants, and physiological stress are considered to be the major risk factors for GI bleeding in patients undergoing antiplatelet therapy following PCI. Recent clinical and experimental studies indicate that administration of low-dose aspirin may also increase the risk of adverse events in the small intestine. Although some prophylactic strategies such as proton-pump inhibitor, H₂ receptor antagonist and eradication of Helicobacter pylori are proposed, there are few randomized controlled trials assessing the best strategy for the prevention of GI bleeding after PCI. Further extensive studies are required to ascertain the beneficial effect of prophylactic agents for dual antiplatelet therapy following PCI."

CD008201,0,1433398,0,Continuous pulse oximetry and the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism in critically ill trauma patients.,"The diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) may be difficult to establish in trauma patients, particularly those who are unresponsive or mechanically ventilated. Based on a prior retrospective study, we hypothesized that patients monitored by continuous pulse oximetry who experienced a 10% or greater sudden sustained drop in arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) without a change in static lung compliance (Cst) were most likely to have had a PE. We followed SaO2 in 972 patients admitted to our trauma ICU during the 18-month period ending in December 1990. Forty-eight patients (5%) with SaO2 changes, but no Cst changes, were evaluated for suspected PE using pulmonary arteriography (PA). Of these, 21 (44%) had a positive PA study. All patients with a positive PA had either clear chest roentgenograms or no change in underlying pulmonary pathologic processes. Of the remainder, 26 had evidence of a new pathologic entity on chest roentgenograms and only one patient had a SaO2 decrease, no change in Cst, and a negative PA. All mechanically ventilated trauma patients should have SaO2 monitored continuously. Patients with a > 10% drop in Sao2 with no change in Cst and no new roentgenographic chest findings should undergo PA. Based on our experience, this approach would yield a sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value of 100%, 99.9%, and 95%, respectively, for the diagnosis of clinically significant PE."
CD008201,0,18666472,0,[Secondary prevention after myocardial infarction].,"The mortality rate after myocardial infarction fell sharply with the advent of reperfusion methods and the use of efficient antithrombotic and antiischemic drugs. However, new infarcts, heart failure, arrythmias and sudden death remain frequent, especially in the first two years after the initial event. Large clinical studies have defined and validated therapies for secondary prevention, but the recommended measures are not always properly implemented. Patients with and without ST elevation after myocardial infarction share the same pathophysiologic mechanism, namely atherosclerotic plaque rupture or erosion, with different degrees of superimposed thrombosis and distal embolization. Secondary prevention is the same for these two patient categories. Acute coronary syndromes are associated with an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes (new myocardial ischemia, left ventricular dysfunction or sudden death) and require aggressive secondary prevention. However, risks factors such as smoking, hypertension, obesity, hypercholesterolemia and diabetes frequently persist. In addition, medical practice does not always respect consensus guidelines. Early risk stratification is necessary to detect residual myocardial ischemia in viable myocardium. After the acute phase, the prognosis depends on the degree of left ventricular dysfunction and the extent and severity of residual ischemia. Exercise and ambulatory electrocardiography, stress echocardiography, perfusion scintigraphy using vasodilator stress, magnetic resonance imaging and coronary angiography are all useful for identifying high-risk patients. Secondary prevention should include risk factor management with lifestyle modifications such as weight reduction, a reduction in saturated fats and an increase in monounsaturated fatty acids. Smoking cessation is crucial, and regular physical activity (30 min per day at least 5 days a week) is beneficial. Cardiac rehabilitation has been shown to improve exercise tolerance and cardiovascular outcome."
CD008201,0,26150333,0,Haemodynamic assessment in simulated operative positions before knee arthroplasty can be useful in deep vein thrombosis prediction.,"During knee arthroplasty, the leg is placed in several forced positions, which are mainly uncomfortable for all tissue structures in the region, including the vascular structures. Veins have a weaker quality of the wall structure than arteries, so during the forced position morphological and haemodynamic consequences are expected mainly in the venous system. Conditions of safe aseptic environment for the arthroplasty are in collision with routine intra-operative analysis of local haemodynamics in real time. This is the reason why we have no insight into the haemodynamic and morphological changes at the time in which the initiation of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) occurs. For this reason we created the hypothesis that the monitoring of the occurrence and detection of potential DVT risks can be achieved pre-operatively using echosonograms in simulated operative positions, and then compare them with the cases of postoperative DVT."
CD008201,0,21821721,0,An observational study for venous thromboembolism risk assessment among hospitalized patients in general surgery clinics across Turkey.,Venous thromboembolism (VTE) still remains a significant public health problem due to gaps between recommendations and clinical practice in VTE prophylaxis. This is the first clinical study designed to evaluate the applicability of a standard 'VTE prophylaxis and risk factor assessment form (VTE-PRAF)' and prescription of VTE prophylaxis among hospitalized patients in the daily practice of general surgeons in Turkey.
CD008201,0,16123916,0,Prevention of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation.,"Nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF) is an independent risk factor for stroke that becomes increasingly prevalent as populations age. More than half a dozen clinical trials have demonstrated that anticoagulation with the vitamin K antagonist warfarin is the most effective therapy for stroke prophylaxis in AF. The narrow therapeutic index of warfarin requires that the intensity of anticoagulation be maintained within the international normalized ratio (INR) range of 2.0 to 3.0 to optimize efficacy while minimizing bleeding risk. The pharmacokinetics of warfarin are subject to variability due to interactions with multiple drugs and foods, making maintenance of the INR within this range difficult to achieve in clinical practice without close coagulation monitoring and frequent dose adjustments. Current guidelines recommend oral anticoagulation for high-risk individuals with AF but these inherent limitations lead to substantial underprescribing, particularly in elderly patients at greatest risk. This has stimulated the development of new agents with improved benefit-risk profiles, such as ximelagatran, the first of the oral direct thrombin inhibitors, which has a wider therapeutic margin and low potential for drug interactions, allowing fixed dosing without anticoagulation monitoring. Ximelagatran has been evaluated for stroke prevention in AF in the Stroke Prevention using an Oral Direct Thrombin Inhibitor in Atrial Fibrillation (SPORTIF) program, the largest clinical trials of antithrombotic therapy for stroke prevention in AF to date. The phase III trials of ximelagatran in AF, SPORTIF III and V, found a fixed oral dose of ximelagatran (36 mg twice daily) comparable to dose-adjusted warfarin (INR 2.0 to 3.0) in preventing stroke and systemic thromboembolic complications among high-risk patients with AF. Results from the population of over 7000 patients in SPORTIF III and V demonstrate noninferiority of ximelagatran compared with warfarin. Data from SPORTIF III show an absolute reduction in stroke and systemic embolic events with ximelagatran compared with warfarin of 1.6% per year versus 2.3% per year, respectively ( P = 0.10). SPORTIF V further supports noninferiority between the two agents with an absolute risk reduction of 0.45%, well within the predefined noninferiority margin (95% confidence interval -0.13, 1.03; P = 0.13). Although event rates for major bleeding did not differ significantly with ximelagatran versus warfarin in either study, combined rates for major and minor bleeding were significantly reduced with ximelagatran. The overall net clinical benefit, taking into account effects on stroke or systemic embolic events, major bleeding, and death, was also greater with ximelagatran compared with warfarin in both studies. Elevated serum transaminase enzymes were observed in approximately 6% of patients given ximelagatran in these trials. These typically occurred 1 to 6 months after initiating treatment and usually abated without clinical sequelae whether or not treatment was continued. Given the consistency of response, the favorable overall benefit-risk ratio and the convenience of fixed oral dosing, ximelagatran may increase the number of patients with AF eligible for anticoagulation and amplify the potential for prophylaxis against stroke."
CD008201,0,17904004,0,The relationship between plasma D-dimer concentrations and acute ischemic stroke subtypes.,"Elevated concentrations of D-dimers (DDs) in patients with acute ischemic stroke may cause differential diagnostic problems with regard to pulmonary or deep venous thrombosis. The true relationship between plasma DDs and acute ischemic stroke remains uncertain. We studied acute stroke patients admitted to a single acute neurology department with a specialized stroke unit. As part of our clinical protocol, blood samples of each patient had been taken within the first 24 hours after the onset of stroke symptoms and before anticoagulant treatment had been started, to evaluate the coagulation profile. Each patient's medical record was reviewed, and demographic, clinical, laboratory and neuroimaging information was abstracted. Univariate and multivariate statistical analyses were performed. A total of 59 patients admitted to our stroke unit between October 2003 and March 2004 with different stroke subtypes according to the TOAST criteria were evaluated to characterize the impact of stroke category on DD concentration. Family members (n = 23) served as controls in this study. Multivariate regression analysis revealed that patients who sustained cardioembolic stroke had significantly higher DD concentrations than controls and patients who sustained transient ischemic attacks. We identified a correlation between plasma DD levels and different acute ischemic stroke subtypes before any stroke treatment was started. Thus DD concentrations may be considered a direct consequence of marked cerebral infarction and may be useful for physicians when making decisions on treatment for acute ischemic stroke."

CD008201,0,12052271,0,Lipid-lowering therapies in the management of acute coronary syndromes.,"Despite the significant advances made in the treatment of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) with antiplatelet and antithrombotic therapy, the risk of serious complications remains high, especially in the first few months following an acute coronary event. Although lipid-lowering therapy in patients with significant risk factors (primary prevention) or stable coronary disease (secondary prevention) is known to improve long-term survival, patients with a recent ACS were specifically excluded from the early statin trials. However, the use of lipid-lowering agents (principally statins) during hospitalization or in the period immediately following an acute coronary event has recently been studied. Statin therapy in this setting has been shown to reduce angina, rehospitalization, and mortality. Improved outcomes associated with lipid-lowering therapy in ACS may be mediated through beneficial effects on plaque stabilization, endothelial function, inflammation, and thrombus formation. This paper reviews the evidence supporting the potential benefits and mechanisms of statin therapy in the management of ACS. Clinical guidelines to achieve optimal lipid management are also discussed."
CD008201,0,23474664,0,Management of ischemic stroke in the hyperacute phase.,"Over the last 15 years, advances in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) management have led to a significant reduction in the morbidity and mortality related to this serious disease. This has resulted from progress in imaging technology, increased access to imaging procedures, enhanced coordination in stroke care from emergency departments to rehabilitation centers, development of organized inpatient stroke units, and to the widespread use of acute thrombolysis. Once the diagnosis of AIS is confirmed by neuroimaging, the etiological work up is conducted in parallel with therapeutic measures by stroke units. The intravenous administration of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) remains the most beneficial intervention in emergency stroke management, but it must be administered within 4.5 hours following the onset of symptoms and only in eligible patients. Recently, several procedures for increasing the efficacy of arterial recanalization have emerged, including intra-arterial administration of thrombolytic agents, mechanical reopening techniques, development of new thrombolytic agents, protocol modifications that allow treatment beyond 4.5 hours or in individuals >80 years old, and remote patient evaluation via telemedicine. So far, no potentially neuroprotective drug has shown to improve outcome following stroke. In addition, pulmonary status, blood pressure, glucose, temperature, and cardiac function must be closely monitored in patients undergoing treatment for AIS. Complications such as cerebral edema, hemorrhagic transformation, seizure, infection, and venous thromboembolic disease worsen the prognosis, and must be prevented or treated. Like myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke should be considered as a treatable emergency. Widespread public education regarding stroke symptoms, novel treatments, and time constraints for effective therapy should increase the number of patients that present within the first hours after stroke. Since ""time is brain,"" early presentation is key to transforming trial results into effective stroke therapies."

CD008201,0,10964121,0,High prevalence of iliofemoral venous thrombosis with severe groin infection among injecting drug users in North East Scotland: successful use of low molecular weight heparin with antibiotics.,"Injecting drug use, mainly of heroin, currently represents a major public health issue in the North East of Scotland. The recent tendency of the committed injecting drug user to inject into the groin has created novel problems for the Infection Unit. Data are presented on 20 consecutive patients admitted between 1994 and 1999 with iliofemoral venous thromboses, often complicated by severe soft tissue infections and bacteraemia as a result of heroin injection into the femoral vein. Nine had coexistent groin abscesses, four had severe streptococcal soft tissue infection of the right thigh, groin and lower abdomen, and two had coincidental soft tissue infections of the upper limb. Nine were bacteraemic on admission. All of the patients were chronic injecting drug users with a median injection duration of 6.5 years. The 18 patients tested for hepatitis C virus were all seropositive. None of the 14 patients tested was positive for HIV. Seventeen patients were treated with subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin (tinzaparin), three having received intravenous unfractionated heparin initially. The tinzaparin was self administered and given for a median duration of seven weeks. One patient declined to have any treatment. Three months after presentation eight patients were asymptomatic, seven had a persistently swollen leg, and five were lost to follow up. None developed clinically apparent pulmonary embolism after institution of anticoagulant therapy. The management of iliofemoral venous thrombosis in injection drug users is problematic because of poor venous access, non-compliance with prescribed treatment, ongoing injecting behaviour, and coexistent sepsis. It is unlikely that a randomised trial of standard treatment with heparin and warfarin versus low molecular weight heparin alone would be practical in this patient group. These retrospective data indicate that the use of tinzaparin in injecting drug users is feasible and appears to result in satisfactory clinical responses. The possibility of concomitant infection in injecting drug users with venous thrombosis should always be addressed, as it appears to be a common phenomenon. Early drainage of abscesses and antimicrobial chemotherapy, often administered intramuscularly or orally because of lack of peripheral venous access, is central to the appropriate care of these patients."

The incidence of DVT after SCI was 27.6%. In multiple logistic regression analysis, absence of spasticity was a significant independent risk factor (P<0.05) for occurrence of DVT. Symptomatic pulmonary embolism was evident in 7 patients without an episode of sudden death. Therefore, it is concluded that the incidence of DVT after SCI in Korean patients is comparable with that in Western populations. This result suggests that pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis should be considered in Korean patients with SCI."
CD008201,0,19637948,0,Economic burden of venous thromboembolism in hospitalized patients.,"Venous thromboembolism, a condition that includes deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, is a significant medical problem that affects more than 1 million patients each year. In addition to the immense impact of venous thromboembolism on morbidity and mortality, the economic burden of the disease is considerable, costing the health care system in the United States more than $1.5 billion/year. The cost of managing an initial episode of deep vein thrombosis is estimated at $7712-10,804, and for an initial pulmonary embolism event $9566-16,644. Management of acute venous thromboembolism in patients with cancer costs more than $20,000. Although much of the costs of venous thromboembolism are associated with managing the acute event, there are also significant costs associated with its long-term complications such as recurrent venous thromboembolism, postthrombotic syndrome, and pulmonary hypertension. Data from numerous robust clinical trials have demonstrated that with appropriate prophylaxis, many of these venous thromboembolism events can be prevented in both surgical and medical patients. Even though the strong evidence supporting venous thromboembolism prophylaxis spans several decades, a number of large American and global registries have documented very poor use of appropriate venous thromboprophylaxis. Because of increasing regulatory requirements, hospitals nationwide are developing necessary documentation of appropriate venous thromboembolism prophylaxis programs for both surgical and medical patients. Hospitals and clinicians must have a firm understanding of not only the clinical impact but also the economic impact of failing to use appropriate prophylaxis and of the cost-effectiveness of different venous thromboprophylaxis methods."
CD008201,0,19753640,0,Optimizing prevention of hospital-acquired venous thromboembolism (VTE): prospective validation of a VTE risk assessment model.,Hospital-acquired (HA) venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common source of morbidity/mortality. Prophylactic measures are underutilized. Available risk assessment models/protocols are not prospectively validated.
CD008201,0,21162607,0,Clinical experience with bemiparin.,"Subcutaneous bemiparin has been evaluated for the prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in moderate to high-risk patients undergoing surgery, and for the acute and long-term treatment of established VTE. General and orthopaedic surgery is associated with VTE incidence rates of 15-60% in the absence of thromboprophylaxis and this can be reduced by over 70% with appropriate thromboembolic prophylaxis. Bemiparin was as effective as unfractionated heparin (UFH) in the prevention of VTE, when both were initiated preoperatively, but was associated with significantly fewer bleeding episodes than UFH. Bemiparin prophylaxis initiated postoperatively was at least as effective as bemiparin initiated preoperatively and was associated with a lower incidence of bleeding complications than preoperative initiation. In terms of patients with cancer undergoing abdominal or pelvic surgery, preliminary results from a recent study with bemiparin showed that extended prophylaxis for 4 weeks significantly reduced the rate of major VTE, without increasing bleeding risk, compared with prophylaxis for one week. Bemiparin, initiated postoperatively, was as effective as enoxaparin, initiated preoperatively, in the prevention of VTE in patients undergoing total knee replacement. The incidence of bleeding complications was similar between groups, although the incidence of injection site haematoma was significantly higher with enoxaparin than with bemiparin. Postoperative initiation of bemiparin thromboprophylaxis minimized the risk of spinal haematoma in patients using neuraxial anaesthesia (approximately 93% of patients). In addition, postoperative initiation is likely to reduce the total costs, because patients do not need to be admitted to hospital the day before surgery. Bemiparin was more effective than intravenous UFH in the acute treatment of established deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and was as effective as oral warfarin in the subsequent secondary prevention of VTE over 3 months of therapy, while bleeding complications over 3 months of therapy were similarly low. In a European study, acute treatment of DVT with bemiparin for one week followed by 12 weeks' secondary prevention with bemiparin (i.e. bemiparin/bemiparin) was associated with a cost saving of &U20AC;908 per patient compared with UFH/warfarin. Similarly, bemiparin/warfarin produced a cost saving of &U20AC;769 compared with UFH/warfarin. The savings were predominantly the result of reduced hospital stays during acute treatment with bemiparin. Bemiparin was also associated with increased quality-adjusted life expectancy. Observational studies in routine clinical practice demonstrated that outpatient treatment of acute VTE was as effective as inpatient treatment, but with lower costs, and bemiparin was as effective as vitamin K antagonists over 3 months for secondary prevention, with VTE recurrence rates of 0% and 0.3% over 3 months in separate studies. Bemiparin is thus an effective, well tolerated agent for thromboprophylaxis in surgery, and for the acute and long-term treatment of established VTE, having advantages over UFH and particular benefits as a result of initiating therapy postoperatively."
CD008201,0,27120721,0,[Actual questions about the prevention of venous thromboembolism in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy].,"Cancer patients have a 2-7 fold increased risk of venous thromboembolism compared with the general population and, since 1990, this is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. This review summarizes the current knowledge on venous thromboembolism and cancer. Notably, the risk of venous thromboembolism varies depending on the type and stage of cancer. For instance, pancreatic and brain cancer patients have a higher risk of venous thromboembolism than breast and prostate cancer patients. Moreover, patients with metastatic disease have a higher risk than those with localized tumors. Tumor-derived procoagulant factors, cytokines and growth factors may directly and indirectly enhance venous thromboembolism. Chemotherapy produces ~6,5 fold increase in venous thromboembolism incidence in cancer patients compared to the general population. Prevention of this complication is challenging. The authors review the development of guidelines concerning venous thromboembolism prevention in hospitalized and also in ambulatory cancer patients treated with chemotherapy. Current guidelines recommend the use of low-molecular-weight heparin. Understanding the underlying mechanisms may allow the development of new therapies to safely prevent venous thromboembolism in cancer patients."
CD008201,0,22836491,0,Venous thromboembolism in cancer patients - risk scores and recent randomised controlled trials.,"Cancer patients are at increased risk of developing venous thromboembolism (VTE). Guidelines recommend routine thromboprophylaxis in hospitalised acutely ill cancer patients and in myeloma patients receiving combination treatments including thalidomide or lenalidomide. Currently, thromboprophylaxis is not recommended in cancer outpatients. It is the aim of this review to give an overview of studies that applied scores for the risk assessment of cancer-related VTE. We will also discuss randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that investigated primary thromboprophylaxis in cancer patients. Recently, Khorana et al. published a practical and reproducible risk assessment score that includes clinical and laboratory parameters for the stratification of cancer patients according to their propensity to develop VTE. Patients assigned to the high-risk group are likely to benefit most from primary thromboprophylaxis. This score was validated in prospective and retrospective observational studies. In the Vienna Cancer and Thrombosis Study (CATS) the score was expanded by adding two biomarkers, and the prediction of VTE was considerably improved. In recent RCTs including cancer patients with different malignancies it was shown that thromboprophylaxis is safe and effective. However, VTE incidence rates were low. To date, no data is available from interventional studies applying thromboprophylaxis in cancer patients categorised into high-risk groups on the basis of risk assessment with scores. From the available literature we conclude that risk assessment for VTE is feasible in cancer patients; however, interventional studies to investigate the safety and efficacy of thromboprophylaxis in a high risk cancer population have yet to be performed."

The potential of SERM in the care of chronic kidney disease-mineral bone and disorders].,"The umbrella concept chronic kidney disease-mineral bone and disorders (CKD-MBD) has been developed these days, which includes vascular calcification, laboratory abnormalities, and bone abnormalities. Given the high prevalence of CKD stage 3 in the patients with osteoporosis and the high risk of fracture in osteoporosis with CKD, the role of raloxifene, one of SERM, in the care of CKD-MBD should not be overlooked. In the post-hoc analysis of the MORE trial, the effect of raloxifene to reduce vertebral fracture was confirmed as well as a positive effect on bone mineral densities in patients with moderate renal failure and normal parathyroid hormone (PTH). However, there is a possibility of this drug increasing PTH level just like other antiresorbing medications. Therefore, concomitant prescription of active vitamin D might be a good solution. From the viewpoint of pharmacokinetics, it is better to reduce the dose of raloxifene in patients with severe CKD. Moreover, it should be remembered not to prescribe this drug in nephrotic syndrome, which is associated with high risk of thrombosis."

CD008201,0,23218863,0,Management of postabortion hemorrhage: release date November 2012 SFP Guideline #20131.,"Hemorrhage after abortion is rare, occurring in fewer than 1% of abortions, but associated morbidity may be significant. Hemorrhage can be caused by atony, coagulopathy and abnormal placentation, as well as by such procedure complications as perforation, cervical laceration and retained tissue. Evidence on which to make recommendations regarding risk factors and treatment for postabortion hemorrhage is extremely limited. Although medical abortion is associated with more bleeding than surgical abortion, overall bleeding for the two methods is minimal and not clinically different. Identifying patients who may be at increased risk of hemorrhage can help reduce blood loss with abortion. Specifically, women with a uterine scar and complete placenta previa seeking abortion at gestations greater than 16 weeks should be evaluated for placenta accreta. For women at high risk of hemorrhage, referral to a high-acuity center should be considered. We propose an algorithm for treating postabortion hemorrhage as follows: (1) assessment and exam, (2) massage and medical therapy, (3) resuscitative measures with laboratory evaluation and possible re-aspiration or balloon tamponade, and (4) interventions such as embolization and surgery. The Society of Family Planning recommends preoperative identification of women at high risk of hemorrhage as well as development of an organized approach to treatment. Further studies are needed on prophylactic use of uterotonic medication, intraoperative ultrasound and optimal delivery of the placenta after second-trimester medical abortion."

Although intracerebral haemorrhage is the most serious complication of oral anticoagulant treatment, standardized treatment guidelines are still lacking. The currently employed treatments are aimed at normalization of the iatrogenic coagulation impairment, and are not based on randomized controlled trials evidence. Since most patients with oral anticoagulant treatment-intracerebral haemorrhage are at high risk of cardio-embolism and often myocardial infarction, it is uncertain whether the use of procoagulant treatments for oral anticoagulant treatment-intracerebral haemorrhage may increase their risk of thrombotic complications. Patients who receive chronic oral anticoagulant treatment urgently require effective treatments for acute oral anticoagulant treatment-intracerebral haemorrhage, and therefore controlled clinical trials are needed."

Repeated assessment of the prevalence of venous thromboembolism risk and prophylaxis in acute hospital care setting].,"ENDORSE (Epidemiologic International Day for the Evaluation of Patients at Risk for Venous Thromboembolism in the Acute Hospital Care Setting) study in 2006, was a multinational cross-sectional survey designed to assess the prevalence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk in the acute hospital care setting, and to determine the proportion of at-risk patients who receive appropriate prophylaxis. From the 358 randomly selected hospitals across 32 countries in the global registry, 9 Hungarian centers were included. According to the Hungarian results, the use of appropriate prophylaxis was more common in surgical patients but much less common in medical patients comparing to the worldwide average. ENDORSE 2-HUNGARY was a local survey to compare the prophylactic habits after two years and two months time period. In both surveys, the 2004 American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) evidence-based consensus guidelines were used to assess venous thromboembolism risk and to determine whether patients were receiving recommended prophylaxis. The one day survey ENDORSE 2-HUNGARY was repeated beside seven already audited hospitals, and in two newly recruited hospitals. A total of 886 patients were assessed for thrombosis risk on the basis of hospital chart review. Of these patients 59.0% (N=523) were judged at risk for VTE, including 100% (N=327) surgical and 35.1% (N=196) medical patients. 67.9% (N=355) of the total at-risk patients received ACCP-recommended VTE prophylaxis. Among surgical patients, 84.4% (N=276) received recommended prophylaxis compared with 40.3% (N=79) of medical patients. Results of the ENDORSE in 2006 and 2009 were compared, as well. The rate of appropriate prophylaxis use in at-risk patients did not changed significantly in surgical patients, however, a significant, 43.9% increase was found in medical patients (p=0.002), that proves the success of lectures presenting the facts and focusing to increase medical prophylaxis during the time period between the two studies. 59.7% of at-risk medical patients and 15.6% of surgical patients were unprotected against thrombosis in 2009. We should further increase the rate of at-risk patients receiving appropriate prophylaxis. We should reinforce the rationale for the increase of awareness of VTE risk in hospitalized medical patients, and to enhance the prophylaxis practice among healthcare professionals."
CD008201,0,17245572,0,[The use of antithrombotic drugs during various surgical procedures].,"Neuraxial blockade has been shown to provide essential benefits in terms of reduced perioperative morbidity and mortality. Case series from recent years indicate that spinal epidural hematoma is more common than previously estimated, with incidences of 1:200,000 in obstetric patients and as high as 1:3,600 in female orthopedic patients. To lower this risk, societies worldwide have issued guidelines establishing recommended time intervals between administration of antithrombotic drugs and performance of neuraxial blockade. If adherence to these intervals imposes a high risk of theomboembolic complications, neuraxial blockade should be withheld in favor of continued antithrombotic therapy. In such patients an alternative plan for postoperative pain management such as patient-controlled intravenous analgesia or peripheral nerve blocks should be established. In patients on continued acetylsalicylic acid therapy, neuraxial blockade may be performed if thromboembolism prophylaxis is not administered concurrently."
CD008201,0,11016012,0,Pulmonary embolus after coronary artery bypass surgery: a review of the literature.,"Pulmonary embolus (PE) after cardiac bypass surgery is an uncommon complication but carries with it high morbidity and mortality. The incidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and PE after cardiac bypass varies depending on postoperative thromboprophylaxis, the presence of indwelling central venous catheters in the lower extremities, and early ambulation. The clinical diagnosis of DVT remains difficult and challenging. Pulmonary embolus is often the first occurring clinical event. The safety and effectiveness of preventative pharmacologic agents, such as subcutaneous unfractionated or fractionated heparin or oral coumadin, remain largely unknown. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, generally associated with a high incidence of DVT and PE, occurs in approximately 3.8% of patients who have undergone cardiac surgery and are placed postoperatively on high-dose intravenous unfractionated heparin. Sequential compression devices (SCD) have not been effective in reducing the incidence of DVT in an ambulating cardiac bypass patient when added to routine elastic graded compression stockings (GCS). Very large clinical trials are necessary to prove the effectiveness of pharmacologic or mechanical preventative measures in reducing the incidence of PE after cardiac surgery above the commonly used GCS, early ambulation, and aspirin. In a nonambulating, higher-risk cardiac bypass patient with slow recovery, a more aggressive prophylaxis regimen might be necessary for optimal prevention, although further data are needed to support this hypothesis."

Anticoagulation ameliorates stroke risk, but because these arrhythmias may occur intermittently without symptoms, initiation of prophylactic therapy is often delayed until electrocardiographic documentation is obtained. The IMPACT study is a multicenter, randomized trial of remote surveillance technology in patients with implanted dual-chamber cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator (CRT-D) devices designed to test the hypothesis that initiation and withdrawal of oral anticoagulant therapy guided by continuous ambulatory monitoring of the atrial electrogram improve clinical outcomes by reducing the combined rate of stroke, systemic embolism, and major bleeding compared with conventional clinical management. For those in the intervention group, early detection of atrial high-rate episodes (AHRE) generates an automatic alert to initiate anticoagulation based on patient-specific stroke risk stratification. Subsequently, freedom from AHRE for predefined periods prompts withdrawal of anticoagulation to avoid bleeding. Patients in the control arm are managed conventionally, the anticoagulation decision prompted by incidental detection of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter during routine clinical follow-up. The results will help define the clinical utility of wireless remote cardiac rhythm surveillance and help establish the critical threshold of AHRE burden warranting anticoagulant therapy in patients at risk of stroke.

Other medical conditions associated with a high risk of VTE include cardiac disease, respiratory disease, inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatological and infectious diseases. Pre-disposing risk factors in non-surgical cancer patients include a history of VTE, immobilisation, history of metastatic malignancy, complicating infections, increasing age, obesity hormonal or antiangiogenic therapies, thalidomide and lenalidomide therapy. Heparins, both unfractionated (UFH) and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) and fondaparinux have been shown to be effective agents in prevention of VTE in the medical setting with patients having a history of cancer. UFH and LMWH along with semuloparin also have a role in outpatients with cancer receiving chemotherapy. However, it has not yet been possible to demonstrate a significant effect on mortality rates in this population. UFH has a higher rate of bleeding complications than LMWH. Thromboprophylaxis has been shown to be effective in medical patients with cancer and may have an effect on cancer outcomes. Thromboprophylaxis in patients receiving chemotherapy remains controversial and requires further investigation. There is no evidence for the use of aspirin, warfarin or mechanical methods. We recommend either LMWH, or fondaparinux for the prevention of VTE in cancer patients with acute medical illnesses and UFH for those with significant severe renal impairment. For ambulatory cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy we recommend LMWH or semuloparin. These are safe and effective agents in the thromboprophylaxis of non-surgical cancer patients."

The main strategy to decrease VT incidence is timely thromboprophylaxis in at-risk patients. We sought to evaluate the reliability of risk assessment model (RAM) data, the incremental usefulness of additional variables and the modelling of an adjusted score (the NAVAL score). We used the RAM proposed by Caprini for initial assessment. A 5 % systematic sample of data was independently reviewed for reliability. We evaluated the incremental usefulness of six variables for VT during the score modelling by logistic regression. We then assessed the NAVAL score for calibration, reclassification and discrimination performances. We observed 11,091 patients with 37 (0.3 %) VT events. Using the Caprini RAM, high-risk and moderate-risk patients were respectively associated with a 17.4 (95 % confidence interval [CI] 6.1-49.9) and 4.2 (95 % CI 1.6-11.0) increased VT risk compared with low-risk patients. Four independent variables were selected for the NAVAL score: ""Age"", ""Admission clinic"", ""History of previous VT event"" and ""History of thrombophilia"". The area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve for the NAVAL score was 0.72 (95 % CI 0.63-0.81). The Net Reclassification Index (NRI) for the NAVAL score compared with the Caprini RAM was -0.1 (95 % CI -0.3 to 0.1; p = 0.28). We conclude that the NAVAL score is a simplified tool for the stratification of VT risk in hospitalized patients. With only four variables, it demonstrated good performance and discrimination, but requires external validation before clinical application. We also confirm that the Caprini RAM can effectively stratify VT risk in hospitalized patients in our population."

CD008201,0,18855641,0,Monitoring therapeutic anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparins: is it useful or misleading?,"Weight adapted low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) treatment is recommended as initial anticoagulant therapy of deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, in patients with myocardial ischemia or when oral anticoagulation (OAC) must be interrupted peri- operatively. Traditionally unfractioned heparin (UFH) was used as standard short acting anticoagulant, with the therapy monitored by frequent laboratory testing. Currently LMWH have broadly replaced UFH as first- choice anticoagulant due to more preferable pharmacokinetics and a better safety profile. Therapeutic anticoagulation with LMWH can be achieved by subcutaneous weight adapted application and measurement of anti-factor Xa- activity (anti-Xa) has been established as gold standard for LMWH- monitoring. However, since almost all LMWH dosing regimens have been developed empirically without laboratory monitoring, there is still a debate ongoing about the usefulness and impact of anti-Xa-testing. Data are lacking that prove a clear correlation between obtained levels of anti-Xa and the patients' clinical outcome. Newer methods have been developed aiming to determine a broader spectrum of LMWH depending anticoagulant activity. Even though there are some promising preliminary results, these alternative methods are not ready for routine clinical use yet. Nevertheless, current guidelines advise determination of anti-Xa in special patient populations with markedly altered LMWH metabolism or to exclude residual LMWH- activity before surgery at very high risk of bleeding. The aim of this article is to review critically the usefulness of anti- Xa guidance of LMWH- therapy and to give new perspectives on upcoming methods of LMWH- monitoring."

CD008201,0,26769659,0,Long-term renal and cardiovascular risk after preeclampsia: towards screening and prevention.,"Preeclampsia (PE) is a hypertensive pregnancy disorder complicating up to 1-5% of pregnancies, and a major cause of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. In recent years, observational studies have consistently shown that PE carries an increased risk for the mother to develop cardiovascular and renal disease later in life. Women with a history of PE experience a 2-fold increased risk of long-term cardiovascular disease (CVD) and an approximate 5-12-fold increased risk of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Recognition of PE as a risk factor for renal disease and CVD allows identification of a young population of women at high risk of developing of cardiovascular and renal disease. For this reason, current guidelines recommend cardiovascular screening and treatment for formerly preeclamptic women. However, these recommendations are based on low levels of evidence due to a lack of studies on screening and prevention in formerly preeclamptic women. This review lists the incidence of premature CVD and ESRD observed after PE and outlines observed abnormalities that might contribute to the increased CVD risk with a focus on kidney-related disturbances. We discuss gaps in current knowledge to guide optimal screening and prevention strategies. We emphasize the need for research on mechanisms of late disease manifestations, and on effective screening and therapeutic strategies aimed at reducing the late disease burden in formerly preeclamptic women."

This paper reports a debate that took place at the CORA meeting (Controversies in Rheumatology and Autoimmunity), held in Florence in March 2011. Major points of discussion were: 1) the paucity of prospective randomized clinical trials; retrospective studies were the main source supporting the use of high intensity anticoagulation; 2) heterogeneity in antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) definition, due to the lack of standardization of aPL assays and to the failure to distinguish patients with a high risk profile (""triple positive"") from those a low risk profile; 3) bleeding is a major concern about high intensity anticoagulation; however, studies are not concordant in reporting an increased risk compared to the standard regimen; 4) practical issues consist of difficulties in keeping a stable PT-INR over 3 and the possibility for interference by aPL on the thromboplastins used for PT-INR measurement. In conclusion, there is currently a lack of consensus on the use of high intensity anticoagulation for the secondary prophylaxis of arterial thrombosis. However, such a treatment may be particularly recommended in those APS patients who have a high risk aPL profile and other concomitant cardiovascular risk factors, provided that the potential benefit outweighs the risk of bleeding."

Recently, we reported on the effectiveness and safety of a low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), tinzaparin, in preventing deep vein thrombosis in motor-complete SI patients. Recently, another LMWH, enoxaparin, was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for prevention of thromboembolism in hip and knee replacement surgery. Since its approval, we have used 30 mg of enoxaparin subcutaneously every 12 h as routine prophylaxis in all hospitalized SI patients. In this retrospective study, we present an analysis of safety and efficacy of the first six months experience, during which 105 patients received the drug. No patient developed clinical evidence of thromboembolism, and none of the 60 venous ultrasound examinations showed a deep vein thrombus. Eleven patients had evidence of hemorrhage, but the LMWH was considered to have contributed to the bleeding in only three. This additional experience with enoxaparin reinforces our previous conclusion that LMWHs are safe and effective thromboprophylactic agents in SI patients."

CD008201,0,20433999,0,Thromboprophylaxis during chemotherapy in patients with advanced cancer.,"Venous thromboembolism is a common and potentially fatal complication in patients with advanced cancer. In these patients chemotherapy has been identified as an independent risk factor for venous thromboembolism. The annual incidence of venous thromboembolism in cancer patients who receive chemotherapy is estimated to be about 10%. This risk increases up to 15-20% depending on type and combination of anticancer agents. The occurrence of venous thromboembolic events in cancer patients is associated with a poor prognosis. The benefit of antithrombotic prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism in cancer patients who receive chemotherapy has been recently evaluated in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial (the PROTECHT study). The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the low molecular weight heparin nadroparin in the prevention of venous and arterial thromboembolic events during chemotherapy. The results of the PROTECHT study demonstrated that nadroparin reduces by 50% the rate of thromboembolic events in ambulatory patients with metastatic or locally advanced cancer while they receiving chemotherapy. The antithrombotic effect was more evident in patients with lung and gastrointestinal cancer. In future studies the clinical benefit of antithrombotic prophylaxis should be evaluated in cancer patients at particularly high risk for thromboembolism."
CD008201,0,15096324,0,Prevention of venous thromboembolism in pregnancy.,"Venous thromboembolic complications (VTE) are a leading causes of maternal mortality in the developed World. To reduce the incidence VTE in pregnancy, and improve outcomes, a wider understanding of the risk factors involved and a better identification of women at risk of thrombosis coupled with effective thromboprophylaxis are required. The common risk factors for VTE in pregnancy are: age over 35 years; obesity; operative delivery (especially emergency Caesarean Section in labour); thrombophilia; and a family or personal history of thrombosis suggestive of an underlying thrombophilia. As warfarin is unsuitable for use in pregnancy because of problems with embryopathy and risk of fetal bleeding, optimal thromboprophylaxis in pregnancy centres on the use of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH). There is now extensive experience of the safety and efficacy of LMWH in pregnancy. LMWH's, such as enoxaparin and dalteparin, have clinical and practical advantages compared with unfractionated heparin in terms of improved safety (significantly lower incidence of osteoporosis and heparin induced thrombocytopenia), and patient convenience with once daily dosing for the majority of women. Thus LMWH is now the agent of choice in pharmacological thromboprophylaxis in pregnancy"

CD008201,0,22323896,0,"New oral antithrombotics: focus on dabigatran, an oral, reversible direct thrombin inhibitor for the prevention and treatment of venous and arterial thromboembolic disorders.","Venous thromboembolism, presenting as deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, is a major challenge for health care systems. It is the third most common vascular disease after coronary heart disease and stroke, and many hospitalized patients have at least one risk factor. In particular, patients undergoing hip or knee replacement are at risk, with an incidence of asymptomatic deep vein thrombosis of 40%-60% without thromboprophylaxis. Venous thromboembolism is associated with significant mortality and morbidity, with patients being at risk of recurrence, post-thrombotic syndrome, and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. Arterial thromboembolism is even more frequent, and atrial fibrillation, the most common embolic source (cardiac arrhythmia), is associated with a five-fold increase in the risk of stroke. Strokes due to atrial fibrillation tend to be more severe and disabling and are more often fatal than strokes due to other causes. Currently, recommended management of both venous and arterial thromboembolism involves the use of anticoagulants such as coumarin and heparin derivatives. These agents are effective, although have characteristics that prevent them from providing optimal anticoagulation and convenience. Hence, new improved oral anticoagulants are being investigated. Dabigatran is a reversible, direct thrombin inhibitor, which is administered as dabigatran etexilate, the oral prodrug. Because it is the first new oral anticoagulant that has been licensed in many countries worldwide for thromboprophylaxis following orthopedic surgery and for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation, this compound will be the main focus of this review. Dabigatran has been investigated for the treatment of established venous thromboembolism and prevention of recurrence in patients undergoing hip or knee replacement, as well as for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation patients with a moderate and high risk of stroke."
CD008201,0,11251359,0,Thromboprophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin: economic considerations.,"Postoperative thromboembolic events are a major cost factor for every healthcare system. Although thromboprophylaxis carries its own costs, the application of a thromboprophylactic regimen is cost-effective in most instances, at least in high-risk patients. A regimen of general postoperative prevention of deep vein thrombosis is always more cost-effective than surveillance programmes with treatment after diagnosis, and is almost always more cost-effective than no prophylaxis. For patients with a high risk of postoperative thromboembolism, such as after orthopaedic surgery, low-molecular-weight heparins have a rather clear advantage over prophylaxis with unfractionated heparin and warfarin, also in terms of cost- effectiveness. With regard to moderate-risk patients, such as after general surgery, the economic benefits are less clear. However, since the results of economic analyses are heavily dependent on the healthcare system, and since there are methodological difficulties and uncertainties connected with the analyses, the implications are difficult -- if not impossible -- to generalize. There is an urgent need for further prospective studies, which should be performed with defined economic variables a priori and in close cooperation with health economists."

However, the patient developed a transient ischemic embolism 12 h later when the post hoc heparin effect was at its nadir. Based on this and other reports, thrombolytic therapy may be effective and safe in patients with acute, non-organized LA thrombi and post hoc heparinization should be sufficient to prevent thromboembolism from rebound coagulation."

Eighty-six patients received at least two cycles of treatment with Vel-CTD (bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2 i.v. on days 1, 4, 8, and 11; cyclophosphamide 150 mg/m2 orally on days 1–4; thalidomide 50–100 mg/day orally every day; and dexamethasone 20 mg/m2 i.v. on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 every 3 weeks), and 67 patients were given at least two cycles of Vel-CD, which is the same regimen as Vel-CTD except without thalidomide. The overall response rates of the Vel-CD and Vel-CTD groups were 88% and 90% (p>0.05), respectively. There was no difference in the progression free survival (p = 0.69) and overall survival rates(p = 0.49) between the two groups. Grade 3 or more adverse hematologic events occurred in the same proportion of patients in both groups. In terms of non-hematologic toxicities, the Vel-CTD group showed a higher proportion of autonomic neuropathy, motor neuropathy, and sensory neuropathy compared to the Vel-CD group (each, p<0.05). Only three patients in the Vel-CTD group showed thrombotic events despite aspirin prophylaxis. The Vel-CD regimen inpatients with relapsed or refractory MM is an effective and more tolerable salvage therapy compared to Vel-CTD in terms of its comparable response rate and less severe of non-hematologic toxicities."
CD008201,0,19285271,0,Risk stratification for cancer-associated venous thromboembolism.,"The risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) is elevated in cancer, and thrombosis is the second leading cause of death in patients with malignancy. Many risk factors for cancer-associated thrombosis have been identified. These include patient-associated factors such as age, obesity and medical comorbidities; cancer-associated factors such as site and stage of cancer; and treatment-associated factors, particularly chemotherapy and hospitalization. In addition, several candidate biomarkers for cancer-associated thrombosis have been identified recently. Despite the high rate and significant impact of VTE in cancer outpatients, prior attempts at thromboprophylaxis in this population have not consistently demonstrated a benefit. This chapter will focus on risk stratification approaches, including a recently developed predictive model which can be used to identify those patients at highest risk. This model-based approach may have a significant impact on cancer-related morbidity, mortality and cost of care by directing targeted thromboprophylaxis in the future."

CD008201,0,25040468,0,Evidence for the prevention and treatment of stroke in dialysis patients.,"The risks of both ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke are particularly high in dialysis patients of any age and outcomes are poor. It is therefore important to identify strategies that safely minimize stroke risk in this population. Observational studies have been unable to clarify the relative importance of traditional stroke risk factors such as blood pressure and cholesterol in those on dialysis, and are affected by biases that usually make them an inappropriate source of data on which to base therapeutic decisions. Well-conducted randomized trials are not susceptible to such biases and can reliably investigate the causal nature of the association between a potential risk factor and the outcome of interest. However, dialysis patients have been under-represented in the cardiovascular trials which have proven net benefit of commonly used preventative treatments (e.g., antihypertensive treatments, low-dose aspirin, carotid revascularization, and thromboprophylaxis for atrial fibrillation), and there remains uncertainty about safety and efficacy of many of these treatments in this high-risk population. Moreover, the efficacy of renal-specific therapies that might reduce cardiovascular risk, such as modulators of mineral and bone disorder, online hemodiafiltration, and daily (nocturnal) hemodialysis, have not been tested in adequately powered trials. Recent trials have also demonstrated how widespread current practices could be causing stroke. Therefore, it is important that reliable information on the prevention and treatment of stroke (and other cardiovascular disease) in dialysis patients is generated by performing large-scale randomized trials of many current and future treatments."

CD008201,0,15769784,0,Guidelines for percutaneous coronary interventions. The Task Force for Percutaneous Coronary Interventions of the European Society of Cardiology.,"In patients with stable CAD, PCI can be considered a valuable initial mode of revascularization in all patients with objective large ischaemia in the presence of almost every lesion subset, with only one exception: chronic total occlusions that cannot be crossed. In early studies, there was a small survival advantage with CABG surgery compared with PCI without stenting. The addition of stents and newer adjunctive medications improved the outcome for PCI. The decision to recommend PCI or CABG surgery will be guided by technical improvements in cardiology or surgery, local expertise, and patients' preference. However, until proved otherwise, PCI should be used only with reservation in diabetics with multi-vessel disease and in patients with unprotected left main stenosis. The use of drug-eluting stents might change this situation. Patients presenting with NSTE-ACS (UA or NSTEMI) have to be stratified first for their risk of acute thrombotic complications. A clear benefit from early angiography (<48 h) and, when needed, PCI or CABG surgery has been reported only in the high-risk groups. Deferral of intervention does not improve outcome. Routine stenting is recommended on the basis of the predictability of the result and its immediate safety. In patients with STEMI, primary PCI should be the treatment of choice in patients presenting in a hospital with PCI facility and an experienced team. Patients with contra-indications to thrombolysis should be immediately transferred for primary PCI, because this might be their only chance for quickly opening the coronary artery. In cardiogenic shock, emergency PCI for complete revascularization may be life-saving and should be considered at an early stage. Compared with thrombolysis, randomized trials that transferred the patients for primary PCI to a 'heart attack centre' observed a better clinical outcome, despite transport times leading to a significantly longer delay between randomization and start of the treatment. The superiority of primary PCI over thrombolysis seems to be especially clinically relevant for the time interval between 3 and 12 h after onset of chest pain or other symptoms on the basis of its superior preservation of myocardium. Furthermore, with increasing time to presentation, major-adverse-cardiac-event rates increase after thrombolysis, but appear to remain relatively stable after primary PCI. Within the first 3 h after onset of chest pain or other symptoms, both reperfusion strategies seem equally effective in reducing infarct size and mortality. Therefore, thrombolysis is still a viable alternative to primary PCI, if it can be delivered within 3 h after onset of chest pain or other symptoms. Primary PCI compared with thrombolysis significantly reduced stroke. Overall, we prefer primary PCI over thrombolysis in the first 3 h of chest pain to prevent stroke, and in patients presenting 3-12 h after the onset of chest pain, to salvage myocardium and also to prevent stroke. At the moment, there is no evidence to recommend facilitated PCI. Rescue PCI is recommended, if thrombolysis failed within 45-60 min after starting the administration. After successful thrombolysis, the use of routine coronary angiography within 24 h and PCI, if applicable, is recommended even in asymptomatic patients without demonstrable ischaemia to improve patients' outcome. If a PCI centre is not available within 24 h, patients who have received successful thrombolysis with evidence of spontaneous or inducible ischaemia before discharge should be referred to coronary angiography and revascularized accordingly--independent of 'maximal' medical therapy."
CD008201,0,15317402,0,Evidence for extended prophylaxis in the setting of orthopedic surgery.,"Patients undergoing orthopedic surgery represent one of the highest risk groups for the development of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Evidence shows that this risk extends beyond the period in which the patient is hospitalized, especially for patients undergoing hip surgery. Clinical trials have shown that extended prophylaxis with the low-molecular-weight heparins is effective in reducing the rate of total VTE, and a meta-analysis demonstrated a reduction in symptomatic VTE with extended prophylaxis after total hip replacement surgery. Based on these results, the American College of Chest Physicians gives a grade 2A recommendation for the use of extended prophylaxis after orthopedic surgery. Until recently, data evaluating the role of prophylaxis in patients undergoing hip fracture surgery were limited. Subsequently, a novel anticoagulant, fondaparinux, demonstrated significant benefit in these patients and has become the first and only agent approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in patients undergoing hip fracture surgery Despite the limitations of the older trials, their findings supported the need to evaluate extended prophylaxis in patients undergoing hip fracture surgery. In the first well-conducted trial of extended prophylaxis for hip fracture surgery, fondaparinux provided impressive results in reducing total and symptomatic VTE. The results of this trial have once again led to fondaparinux being the first and only agent to be granted FDA approval for the indication of extended prophylaxis in patients undergoing hip fracture surgery."

A retrospective case study of 219 patients (mean age 77.2 years) admitted between January 1999 and 31 December 2001 with a diagnosis of stroke and AF was done. Patient characteristics, presence of comorbid conditions, knowledge of preadmission AF, medication history and appropriateness of antithrombotic treatment were recorded. One hundred and fifty patients were known to have had AF prior to admission. Forty-one presented with an intracranial hemorrhage (19 on warfarin, 10 on aspirin). Of those patients with known AF only 43 were on treatment consistent with the guidelines. Warfarin was recommended in 144 of the whole cohort, but only 39 were taking it. Fifty-three patients were receiving aspirin although warfarin was the recommended treatment. Fifty-four with known AF were not on any antithrombotic treatment. Factors significantly associated with the use of antithrombotic treatment were history of AF (p = 0.0004), valvular heart disease (p = 0.02), venous thromboembolism (p = 0.04), risk of thromboembolism (p = 0.003) and presentation with a nonischemic infarct (p = 0.008).

The methods and timing of DVT prevention and treatment continue to be debated among neurointensivists. The greatest opportunity to intervene is early during the stay in the intensive care unit. There are many factors, however, that can make this the most neglected time for aggressive prevention measures. For large university teaching hospitals, the target of the University Health System Consortium is to achieve an average DVT rate at or below half that of previous reported rates. The current recommendations are effective only if there is compliance with these measures during the majority of the patients' hospitalization. Our hypothesis states that without changing any of the current measures to prevent DVT, a structured program of foot and ankle range-of-motion (ROM) exercises will decrease the incidence of DVT in the neuroscience intensive care patient population. This quasi-experimental study was a quality improvement project examining 315 individuals over the age of 18 years, who were admitted to the neurospine intensive care unit and who received a new program of foot exercises as a method of DVT prevention. Data for the outcome measures were derived from bedside measurement of lower extremity doppler, the percentage of time the exercises were performed, patient history, and standard DVT prevention measures. Overall, there was no difference in DVT rates for those receiving the foot ROM intervention during the study period in 2008-2009 compared with the usual nursing practice for the previous year. However, during the study period, those who developed DVT had a significantly lower compliance rate with the ROM exercises (38.7%) than did those who did not develop DVT (58.4%; p < .001). Therefore, foot and ankle ROM exercises may have a promising role in reducing the incidence of DVT in neuroscience intensive care patients when there is diligent performance of the exercises."
CD008201,0,23677801,0,Rivaroxaban: a review of its use in the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with atrial fibrillation.,"Rivaroxaban (Xarelto(®)), a direct factor Xa inhibitor, is approved for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) in Canada or those with nonvalvular AF (NVAF) in the EU, US and Japan. It is administered at a fixed oral dose and generally does not require routine monitoring of coagulation parameters. In the ROCKET AF trial in patients with NVAF and a moderate to high risk of stroke, oral rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily (15 mg once daily in patients with moderate renal impairment) was noninferior to oral dose-adjusted warfarin once daily in preventing primary endpoint events (i.e. stroke and systemic embolism) in the per-protocol population (primary noninferiority analysis) and superior in the on-treatment safety population (primary superiority analysis). Several ROCKET AF subgroup analyses indicated that the treatment effect of rivaroxaban was consistent across patient subgroups stratified according to baseline factors, including the presence or absence of previous stroke or transient ischaemic attack. Patients with moderate renal impairment receiving the reduced rivaroxaban dosage (15 mg once daily) showed a treatment effect consistent with that seen with rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily in patients with normal renal function. The tolerability profile of rivaroxaban was generally acceptable in ROCKET AF, with no significant difference between rivaroxaban and warfarin in the incidence of major or nonmajor clinically-relevant bleeding events (primary safety endpoint). In the Japanese ROCKET AF trial, rivaroxaban 15 mg once daily (10 mg once daily in patients with moderate renal impairment) was noninferior to oral dose-adjusted warfarin once daily in the incidence of major or nonmajor clinically-relevant bleeding (primary study outcome). Thus, rivaroxaban is a reasonable alternative to warfarin for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with NVAF."

One in five cancer patients are estimated to develop venous and arterial events during the natural history of their illness. However, the risk for VTE varies widely between various subgroups of cancer patients and even in the same cancer patient over time. This narrative review focuses on risk factors, biomarkers and risk assessment tools and attempts to clarify approaches to risk stratification. Clinical risk factors include primary site of cancer, chemotherapy, anti-angiogenic therapy, surgery and hospitalization. Predictive and candidate biomarkers include platelet and leukocyte counts, hemoglobin, D-dimer and tissue factor. However, single risk factors or biomarkers have not, in general, been able to identify sufficiently high-risk populations. A clinical risk score, incorporating 5 simple clinical and laboratory variables, has now been studied in over 10,000 patients and can successfully categorize patients at low- and high-risk for VTE. Recent trials have shown that outpatient prophylactic anticoagulation is both safe and effective, but event rates have been highly variable. Targeted thromboprophylaxis provides an optimal risk-benefit ratio and the best opportunity to reduce the burden of VTE and its consequences for patients with cancer."

CD008201,0,16709475,0,Hyperlipidemia in children.,"Hyperlipidemia in children has emerged as an increasingly prevalent risk factor in children, concomitant with the worldwide epidemic of obesity. Hyperlipidemia can alter vascular endothelial function and impair some of its pro-fibrinolytic and anti-thrombotic regulatory properties, as well as initiate the atherosclerotic process. There are strong links between vascular changes and hyperlipidemia in children, both from pathologic and non-invasive assessment studies. More severe lipid abnormalities in children are related to primary familial dyslipidemias. Current recommendations for screening begin with assessment of family history for cardiovascular disease or events or parental hyperlipidemia. High-risk individuals merit more intensive investigation and intervention. While fat-restricted diets have been shown to be safe in children, lipid-lowering is modest. Those with more severe lipid abnormalities may meet criteria for drug therapy, and the statin agents commonly used in adults are increasingly being used in high-risk children, with similar efficacy and safety, although long-term concerns remain."
CD008201,0,20065931,0,Bridging therapy in the perioperative management of patients with drug-eluting stents.,"Patients with drug-eluting stents appear to be at increased risk of thrombosis beyond 30 days (late) or even 1 year (very late) after stent placement. Patients with recent placement of drug-eluting stents who are receiving dual-antiplatelet therapy pose a challenge in the perioperative period. Current guidelines recommend discontinuation of clopidogrel 5 to 7 days prior to surgery or invasive procedures to prevent bleeding complications. When a patient with a drug-eluting stent is off of clopidogrel, he or she is at risk of stent thrombosis, even during treatment with anticoagulants, such as intravenous heparin. There are currently no universal recommendations for decreasing the risk of stent thrombosis. We herein outline a strategy involving the use of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors as ""bridging therapy"" during the high-risk perioperative period and report on 8 patients who successfully underwent bridging therapy with no adverse cardiac outcomes (death, myocardial infarction, or stent thrombosis) or bleeding complications."

It is concluded that administration of heparin and antibiotic prophylaxis is inadequate despite the provision of a written protocol."
CD008201,0,22012325,0,Venous thromboembolism in patients with symptomatic atherosclerosis.,"Patients with atherosclerosis have an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). We studied patients in the population-based Worcester VTE Study of 1,822 consecutive patients with validated VTE to compare clinical characteristics, prophylaxis, treatment, and outcomes of VTE in patients with and without symptomatic atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, defined as history of ischaemic heart disease, history of positive cardiac catheterisation, percutaneous coronary intervention, or coronary artery bypass graft surgery, or history of peripheral artery disease. Of the 1,818 patients with VTE, 473 (26%) had a history of symptomatic atherosclerosis. Patients with atherosclerosis were significantly older (mean age 71.9 years vs. 61.6 years) and were more likely to have immobility (57.2% vs. 46.7%), prior heart failure (36.9% vs. 10.7%), chronic lung disease (26.4% vs. 15.5%), cerebrovascular disease (18.1% vs. 9.8%), and chronic kidney disease (4.9% vs. 1.9%) (all p<0.001) compared with non-atherosclerosis patients. Thromboprophylaxis was omitted in more than one-third of atherosclerosis patients who had been hospitalised for non-VTE-related illness or had undergone major surgery within the three months prior to VTE. Patients with atherosclerosis were significantly more likely to suffer in-hospital major bleeding (7.6% vs. 3.8%, p=0.0008). In conclusion, patients with atherosclerosis and VTE are more likely to suffer a complicated hospital course. Despite a high frequency of comorbid conditions contributing to the risk of VTE, we observed a low rate of thromboprophylaxis in patients with symptomatic atherosclerosis."

CD008201,0,14594436,0,Costs and cost effectiveness of low molecular weight heparins and platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors: in the management of acute coronary syndromes.,"The most well established antithrombotic treatment for acute coronary syndromes (ACS) is unfractionated heparin (UFH) plus aspirin, but such treatment may not prevent arterial thrombotic events. Low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs) and platelet glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa inhibitors offer alternative or adjunctive treatments. However, before these alternatives with higher acquisition costs are accepted in today's healthcare systems, their cost effectiveness must be proven. This paper reviews international pharmacoeconomic studies on the use of LMWHs and GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors in patients with ACS in an attempt to determine whether these therapies are cost effective. Most of the studies on LMWHs have been cost-minimisation analyses and have focused on enoxaparin sodium, because this is the only LMWH proven to be superior to UFH. Several analyses show that, compared with UFH plus aspirin, enoxaparin sodium provides cost savings both during hospitalisation (30 days) and 1-year follow-up. These cost savings are mainly attributable to fewer cardiac interventions, shorter hospital stays and lower administrative costs. Indeed, the clinical and economic advantages of enoxaparin sodium have led to its recommendation in recent guidelines as the antithrombotic agent of choice for coronary artery disease. Most of the economic analyses of GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors have been cost-effectiveness analyses. Such analyses indicate that the high acquisition costs of these drugs may be at least partially offset by reductions in other costs if a noninvasive approach to risk stratification is used. Furthermore, use of GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors appears to give favourable cost-effectiveness ratios compared with other accepted therapies, such as fibrin-specific thrombolytic therapy, in the cardiovascular field, particularly in high-risk patients and those undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. However, more comprehensive economic data on the GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors are needed."

The recommendation, however, is based largely on expert opinion with almost no evidence from randomised controlled trials or meta-analyses. Here we examine the evidence for and against use of thromboprophylaxis and suggest that careful consideration is needed in implementing change in practice with follow-up of complications due to a real risk of unintended consequences. Therefore, large-scale and well-designed studies are urgently needed. We find that health economic assessments, which should be central to any major health policy change, appear entirely absent in this context."

There are few data available to guide its management in the critically ill cancer patient, perhaps the most complex and challenging patient population encountered. Multiple interacting and often unique factors contribute to both the thrombotic and bleeding risk in such patients. Anticoagulants are effective for prophylaxis and treatment; heparins are the best-studied agents in this setting. Whether unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin is the most appropriate agent depends on the exact clinical situation. Prevention of venous thrombosis is a well-recognized health priority, but thromboprophylaxis remains underused, especially in some high-risk populations such as cancer patients. Enhanced recognition of the thrombotic risk factors and a better understanding of the risks and benefits of anticoagulant therapy are necessary to improve utilization, and much research is needed to address how to implement effective thromboprophylaxis strategies. Careful consideration of the patient's overall prognosis is necessary to develop safe, effective, and individualized approaches to treating thrombosis."

We reviewed the real-life occurrence of VTE-related care for 100 days post-hospitalization in Calgary, Canada. Using medical visit records with a unique patient identifier number applied throughout the city's hospitals, 989 high-risk patients were selected for review. Almost three-quarters of the elderly patients received appropriate prophylaxis while in hospital, and only 2% received prophylaxis on discharge. Over the 100-day follow-up, 21% of the patients presented with clinically suspected VTE, of which 3.8% had confirmed VTE. Patients with multiple risk factors (≥ 3) had the highest frequency of confirmed VTE (≥ 6.1%). This study suggests that the actual rate of VTE-related follow-up care in patients post-hospitalization is high in the first 100 days, particularly among those who have multiple risk factors, warranting consideration of extended thromboprophylaxis in this population."
CD008201,0,17567672,0,Early discharge of patients with pulmonary embolism: a two-phase observational study.,"The aim of the present study was to assess whether patients with pulmonary embolism (PE) could be managed as outpatients after early discharge from hospital using low molecular weight heparin instead of remaining as in-patients until effective oral anticoagulation was achieved. Phase 1 of the study identified criteria for the safe discharge of selected patients; phase 2 treated a cohort of low-risk patients with PE as outpatients with tinzaparin using existing deep venous thrombosis services. In phase 1, 127 (56.4%) of 225 patients were considered unsuitable for outpatient management. Reasons included: admission for another medical reason; additional monitoring or requirement for oxygen; bleeding disorders; previous PE/further PE while on warfarin; co-existing major deep venous thrombosis; likelihood of poor compliance; significant immobility; and pregnancy. In phase 2, 157 patients with PE received outpatient anticoagulation therapy. There were no deaths, bleeding or recurrent thromboembolic events during acute treatment with low molecular weight heparin. The median (range) length of hospital stay was 1.0 (1-4) day, with a median saving of 5.0 (1-42) bed-days per patient. Patients were highly satisfied with outpatient management; 144 (96.6%) indicated that they would prefer treatment as outpatients for a subsequent pulmonary embolism. Early discharge and outpatient management of pulmonary embolism appears safe and acceptable in selected low-risk patients, and can be implemented using existing outpatient deep venous thrombosis services."
CD008201,0,6428346,0,[2-dimensional echocardiographic diagnosis of an intracardiac thrombus in children].,"Eight cases of intracardiac thrombi in infants and children were compiled in a cooperative study involving five paediatric cardiological centres. Two babies were hospitalised for cardiac failure due to a severe supraventricular arrhythmia. Two-dimensional echocardiography (2D echo) showed a left atrial thrombus which disappeared after anticoagulant therapy. The third case was unusual: 2D echo performed 4 months after a Senning operation for complete transposition of the great arteries showed stenosis of the pulmonary venous canal and a thrombus above the stenosis: the mass was echogenic, rounded, of variable density and in contact with the pulmonary veins. These findings were confirmed at autopsy. The fourth case was a 34 month old child with Fallot's triad in whom 2D echo showed a right ventricular thrombus, confirmed at surgery. The four remaining cases were thrombi detected in patients with congestive cardiomyopathy. The thrombus was adherent to the left ventricular lateral wall or apex. Two of these thrombi disappeared after anticoagulant therapy, one of which after hemiplegia. 2D echo is a useful tool for the diagnosis and surveillance of intraatrial or intraventricular thrombi. Intraatrial thrombi may be due to supraventricular arrhythmias in children; intraventricular thrombi are usually seen in association with poor left ventricular contractility. The diagnosis of thrombosis should lead to institution of anticoagulant or even fibrinolytic therapy in order to avoid systemic embolism."

CD008201,0,11078269,0,Frequency of anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation and reasons for its non-use at a Veterans Affairs medical center.,"Randomized clinical trials have led to guidelines for anticoagulation in atrial fibrillation (AF). However, it is unclear how successfully these guidelines are being implemented in clinical practice and there is concern that anticoagulation is underused. Therefore, we examined the rate of anticoagulation in 998 patients with AF who attended a Veterans Affairs Medical Center over a 2-year period. Warfarin was prescribed for 504 patients (51%) and not prescribed for 494 patients (49%). Of these 494 patients, 446 had sufficient data for further assessment. Warfarin was judged not indicated in 200 because AF was transient or lone. Warfarin was indicated in 246 patients, 63% having > or =3 risk factors for thromboembolism. However, 184 of these patients also had at least 1 contraindication to anticoagulation. Thus, warfarin was prescribed to 67% of patients with AF in whom anticoagulation was indicated and to 89% of such patients in whom it was indicated and who had no contraindications. However, 25% of AF patients with strong indications for anticoagulation had concomitant contraindications, which precluded its use. We conclude that the use of warfarin for AF in this setting is higher than previously reported and approaching ideal levels. However, there remains a large, problematic subgroup of patients with AF in whom indications for and contra-indications to anticoagulation coexist."
CD008201,0,24136071,0,Efficacy and safety of high-dose thromboprophylaxis in morbidly obese inpatients.,"Obesity increases the risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE), but whether high-dose thromboprophylaxis is safe and effective in morbidly obese inpatients is unknown. It was the objective of this study to quantify the efficacy and safety of high-dose thromboprophylaxis with heparin or enoxaparin in inpatients with weight > 100 kilograms (kg) within the BJC HealthCare system. Ina retrospective cohort study, we analysed 9,241 inpatients with weight > 100 kg discharged from three hospitals in the BJC HealthCare system from 2010 through 2012. We compared the incidence of VTE in patients who received high-dose thromboprophylaxis (heparin 7,500 units three times daily or enoxaparin 40 mg twice daily) to those who received standard doses (heparin 5,000 units two or three times daily or enoxaparin 40 mg once daily). The primary efficacy outcome was hospital-acquired VTE identified by International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-9 diagnosis codes. The primary safety outcome was bleeding events identified by ICD-9 codes. Among the 3,928 morbidly obese inpatients (weight > 100 kg and body mass index [BMI] ≥ 40 kg/m²), high-dose thromboprophylaxis approximately halved the odds of symptomatic VTE (odds ratio [OR] 0.52, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.27-1.00; p = 0.050). The rate of VTE was 1.48% (35/2,369) in these morbidly obese inpatients who received standard doses of thromboprophylaxis, compared to 0.77% (12/1,559) in those who received high doses. High-dose thromboprophylaxis did not increase bleeding (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.66-1.07, p = 0.15). Independent predictors of VTE were surgery, male sex, cancer, and BMI. In conclusion, high-dose thromboprophylaxis nearly halves the rate of VTE in morbidly obese inpatients."

Although well documented in the general population, the prevalence of PE is less known in the ICU, where it is more difficult to diagnose and to treat. Critically ill patients are at high risk of VTE because they combine both general risk factors together with specific ICU risk factors of VTE, like sedation, immobilization, vasopressors or central venous catheter. Compression ultrasonography and computed tomography (CT) scan are the primary tools to diagnose DVT and PE, respectively, in the ICU. CT scan, as well as transesophageal echography, are good for evaluating the severity of PE. Thromboprophylaxis is needed in all ICU patients, mainly with low molecular weight heparin, such as fragmine, which can be used even in cases of non-severe renal failure. Mechanical thromboprophylaxis has to be used if anticoagulation is not possible. Nevertheless, VTE can occur despite well-conducted thromboprophylaxis."

CD008201,0,9373582,0,Problems of anticoagulation within a palliative care setting: an audit of hospice patients taking warfarin.,"Patients with cancer have an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) compared with a healthy population. The risk increases as cancer progresses and this is reflected in the number of hospice inpatients with VTE. These patients also have an increased risk of bleeding due to tumour site, complications of treatment, progressive liver involvement and concurrent medication such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents. Therefore anticoagulation of cancer patients with VTE is fraught with difficulty. This audit of hospice inpatients taking warfarin showed a high incidence of bleeding which was possibly improved with very stringent international normalized ratio (INR) monitoring: 15 episodes in 17 patients improved to 11 episodes in 18 patients. Patient numbers were small and the two groups heterogeneous, thus formal statistical analysis could not be applied. One patient in each group continued to thrombose despite over anticoagulation with warfarin. Monitoring of INR increased from an average of once every six days to once every 2.4 days. Such frequent monitoring is likely to be highly impractical in many hospice and general practice settings. Control of warfarin as measured by average percentage of INRs in, above or below the therapeutic range if anything appeared to be worse in the second group. Any bleeding in these patients was distressing. As a result of this audit, practice in Huntershill Marie Curie Centre has changed. Low molecular weight heparins are proven to be efficacious in the treatment of VTE, are renally excreted and therefore do not interact with many commonly used concurrent medications. They can be administered once daily and do not need monitoring of anticoagulant effect. Thus they will be used in patients for whom anticoagulation is indicated during a six-month period, after which practice will be again reviewed."

In this study we sought to determine if initiation of a standardized selection criteria and posttransplant chemoprophylaxis regimen could reduce the rate of early allograft loss; we compared the rate of early allograft loss after introduction of these changes. Of the 61 diabetic recipients who underwent these protocols, 50.8 per cent were female. Average age was 42.9 ± 7.4 years of age, average length of stay was 12.7 ± 8.7 days, with all transplants performed heterotopic to the right lower quadrant with venous drainage to the proximal external or common iliac vein. Organ donors were 21.4 ± 4.8 years of age, body mass index was 23.9 ± 2.8 kg/m(2), with a length of stay of 3.7 ± 1.6 days. One-week pancreatic allograft survival for the protocolized versus nonprotocolized patients was 100 per cent versus 96.7 per cent, 1 month was 98.4 per cent versus 93.4 per cent, and 1 year was 96.7 per cent versus 88.5 per cent, respectively. In the protocolized group there were two graft losses due to infectious complications and none due to thrombosis. Before initiation of the protocols patient survival at 1 year was 91.8 per cent and after was 100 per cent. Pancreas transplantation is arguably the most technically demanding organ transplant from a complication and loss standpoint.

However, very little data is available regarding outcomes of CA of AF beyond 5 years. Guidelines' recommendations are not clear regarding long-term oral anticoagulation (OAC) after 2 years. We assessed thromboembolic events (TE) and AF ablation outcomes at very long-term follow-up (> 5 years) after CA. During a mean follow-up of 9 years after CA, 68% patients were in stable sinus rhythm without anti-arrhythmic drugs and the TE event rate was 0.41 per 100 patients/year. Our data suggests that patients post ablation with a high risk for stroke (CHA2DS2-VASc ≥ 2) should however continue OAC treatment."

The presence of central venous catheters is a major trigger for development of venous thrombosis, especially in neonates. As a consequence, thrombosis in the upper extremities are much more frequent in children than in adults. Congenital prothrombotic disorders may play a role in children thrombosis, often in combination with several acquired risk factors like immobilization, serious illness and/or hospitalization. Diagnosis is most frequently made by noninvasive radiologic techniques, like ultrasonography. Prophylaxis and treatment are extrapolated from adult patient protocols or small observational studies performed in small groups of patients."
CD008201,0,17916455,0,Outpatient management of stable acute pulmonary embolism: proposed accelerated pathway for risk stratification.,"Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a major health problem and a cause of worldwide morbidity and mortality. The current standard therapy for acute PE encourages admitting patients to the hospital for administration of parenteral anticoagulation therapy as a bridge to oral vitamin K antagonists. Prognostic models that identify patients with stable (nonmassive) acute PE (SPE) who are at low risk for adverse outcome have recently been reported. Based on these risk stratification models, hospital-based therapy is warranted for patients with PE who meet the criteria associated with a high risk for adverse outcome. However, a growing body of evidence suggests the feasibility of partial outpatient management and accelerated hospital discharge (AHD) in a subset of patients with SPE. Prospective validation of these risk stratification models for predicting patient suitability for AHD is needed."

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the compliance with physician orders for the application of SCD prophylaxis among nonambulatory trauma patients at risk for DVT. We conducted a prospective observational study at two Level I university-affiliated trauma centers. Nonambulatory trauma patients were observed during their early postadmission period in a non-critical care setting. Six observations were made as to proper SCD applications during a 24-hour period (two times in the morning shift, two in the evening shift, and two overnight). ""Full compliance"" was defined as SCD on and functioning properly in all six observations. In a total of 1343 observations in 227 patients only 42 patients (19%) were fully compliant. The devices were on and functioning in 712 (53%) observations. Among the 185 patients who were not fully compliant DVT risk factors were common (83%) and adjunctive heparin prophylaxis was infrequent (27%). The most common times for ""noncompliant"" observations were early afternoon and midmorning. On multivariate analysis only spinal column injury correlated with increased compliance. In nearly half of the observations trauma patients at risk for DVT were not receiving their SCD prophylaxis as per physician orders. Fewer than 20 per cent of patients had the devices on and functioning during each of the six observations during a 24-hour period. These data point to the need for education of hospital staff and for additional prophylactic measures in at-risk patients."
CD008201,0,3612604,0,"[Analysis of the complications of coronarography. Apropos of a series of 2,300 consecutive tests].","The coronarographic risk is 3 deaths per thousand and 2 non-fatal complications per cent. Fatal cases are always related to severe coronary lesions, particularly stenosis of main trunk. Their incidence is equivalent during catheterization by the humeral or femoral routes whereas local complications are more frequent by the humeral approach. In the series of 2,300 successive coronarography examinations reported there were less than 4 deaths per thousand and 1.82 complications per cent. Four factors contribute to the reduction in high risk coronarography mortality when the following protocol is used. First, routine coronary opacification at start of investigations after determination of left ventricular pressures allowing, in patients with very severe coronary lesions and/or markedly altered left ventricular function, the ventriculography to be postponed until the following day or even cancelled. Second, use of a new contrast medium of lower osmolarity possessing advantages over older products. Third, and principally, institution of a very strict pre- and per-coronarography drug protocol, controlled use of an intraaortic diastolic counter-current balloon, and notably placed in position during examination in patients with very pronounced stenosis of main trunk. In these cases the arterial desilet is left in place for 24 hours after examination to delay vagal reflex provoked by compression and to allow urgent insertion if necessary of an intra-aortic diastolic counter-current balloon catheter. Fourth, use of Diltiazem intracoronary in case of major spasm and Streptokinase and possible metallic guide to obtain repermeability of a thrombosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

The results indicate that PE or IA treatments administered along with IVIG and conventional antithrombotic therapy could be a valuable and safe therapeutic option in pregnant APS women with triple antiphospholipid antibody positivity along with a history of thrombosis and/or one or more severe pregnancy complications. In the second part the efficacy and safety of PE combined with IVIG and steroids were evaluated for the treatment of 10 patients with autoimmune congenital heart block (CHB) by comparing maternal features, pregnancy outcome and side effects with those of 24 CHB patients treated with steroids only. The patients treated with the combined therapy showed a statistically significant regression of 2nd degree blocks, an increase in heart rate at birth and a significantly lower prevalence of pacing in the first year of life. Moreover, no side effects were observed except for a few steroid-related events. If these results are confirmed by large-scale studies, the apheretic procedures could lead to improved outcomes in the treatment of these devastating diseases."
CD008201,0,12025972,0,ACE inhibition and atherogenesis.,"Recent clinical studies such as HOPE, SECURE, and APRES show that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors like ramipril improve the prognosis of patients with a high risk of atherothrombotic cardiovascular events. Atherosclerosis, as a chronic inflammatory condition of the vascular system, can turn into an acute clinical event through the rupture of a vulnerable atherosclerotic plaque followed by thrombosis. ACE inhibition has a beneficial effect on the atherogenic setting and on fibrinolysis. Endothelial dysfunction is the end of a common process in which cardiovascular risk factors contribute to inflammation and atherogenesis. By inhibiting the formation of angiotensin II, ACE inhibitors prevent any damaging effects on endothelial function, vascular smooth muscle cells, and inflammatory vascular processes. An increase in the release of NO under ACE inhibition has a protective effect. Local renin-angiotensin systems in the tissue are involved in the inflammatory processes in the atherosclerotic plaque. Circulating ACE-containing monocytes, which adhere to endothelial cell lesions, differentiate within the vascular wall to ACE-containing macrophages or foam cells with increased local synthesis of ACE and angiotensin II. Within the vascular wall, angiotensin II decisively contributes to the instability of the plaque by stimulating growth factors, adhesion molecules, chemotactic proteins, cytokines, oxidized LDL, and matrix metalloproteinases. Suppression of the increased ACE activity within the plaque can lead to the stabilization and deactivation of the plaque by reducing inflammation in the vascular wall, thus lessening the risk of rupture and thrombosis and the resultant acute clinical cardiovascular events. The remarkable improvement in the long-term prognosis of atherosclerotic patients with increased cardiovascular risk might be the clinical result of the contribution made by ACE inhibition in the vascular wall."

CD008201,0,10942229,0,Pilot studies of species-specific chemotherapy of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia using genotype and immunophenotype.,"Genotype and immunophenotype can be used to define biological species of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The purpose of these two pilot studies, conducted between 1986 and 1994, was to explore the feasibility and acceptability of classifying ALL in this manner for selection of treatment rather than using conventional risk for failure factors such as age and initial white blood cell count. The possibility that conventional risk factors would be overcome and survival improved by this approach was also considered. Flow cytometry and chromosome analysis were used to classify the ALL of 150 children into one of five biologic categories as defined by cell surface antigens, DNA index and chromosome number and arrangement. Chemotherapy regimens depended on the assigned category. There was no provision for cranial irradiation and use of alkylating agents, anthracyclines and epipodophyllotoxins was restricted in order to reduce risk of late adverse sequelae. All patients are included in the analysis regardless of presenting condition or adherence to protocol. The majority of patients were Mexican-American or African-American. Eight-year event-free survival (EFS) is 60.7% (+/-4%) and 8-year overall survival (OAS) 72.6% (+/-3.7%). EFS and OAS varied significantly among the biologic categories despite differences in chemotherapy regimens. When the patients with B-precursor ALL were retrospectively classified by current Pediatric Oncology Group (POG) criteria, 8-year EFS was 82% (+/-7.3%) for the good risk group, 68.9% (+/-5.9%) for the standard risk and 48.8% (+/-7.6%) for the poor risk, all significant differences. However, when retrospectively classified according to the Rome/NCI prognostic criteria the 8-year EFS for standard risk patients was 69.1% (+/-5.1%) and for high risk 58.8% (+/-6.9%), not a statistically significant difference. Numbers of T cell and B cell patients are too few for comparison. Gender and ethnicity influenced survival as in treatment based on prognostic factors. Initial central nervous system (CNS) relapse occurred in five patients (3%) and combined CNS and hematological relapse in six (3%). Factors significantly associated with CNS and combined relapse were leukemic pleocytosis in the initial CSF sample, pro-B immunophenotype and DNA index <1.16, but not initial white blood cell count. Only three survivors appear to have serious late adverse sequelae, the only neurologic the result of asparaginase-induced cortical vein thrombosis. The results suggest that use of biologic species as defined by immunophenotype and genotype to select therapy of ALL is feasible and acceptable but under the conditions of these studies offered no apparent therapeutic advantage over conventional risk grouping. However, the introduction of molecular genotyping and novel gene targeted therapeutic agents justify further exploration of this approach."

A total of 160 patients with heterozygous factor V Leiden mutation, prothrombin G20210A mutation, or protein S deficiency were given 5 mg folic acid daily before conception, to be continued during pregnancy, and low-dose aspirin 100 mg daily or low-molecular-weight heparin enoxaparin 40 mg was taken from the 8th week. Twenty-three of the 80 patients treated with low-dose aspirin and 69 of the 80 patients treated with enoxaparin had a healthy live birth (odds ratio [OR], 15.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 7-34, P <.0001). Enoxaparin was superior to low-dose aspirin in each subgroup defined according to the underlying constitutional thrombophilic disorder. An associated protein Z deficiency and/or positive antiprotein Z antibodies were associated with poorer outcomes. The neonate weight was higher in the women successfully treated with enoxaparin, and neonates small for gestational age were more frequent in patients treated with low-dose aspirin. No significant side effects of the treatments could be evidenced in patients or newborns. As there is no argument to prove that low-dose aspirin may have been deleterious, these results support enoxaparin use during such at-risk pregnancies."
CD008201,0,11055888,0,Risk assessment of venous thromboembolism in medical patients.,"Medical patients are at risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). However, the extent of the risk is not well characterized. Risk stratification is an important part of effective thromboprophylactic management. The risks depend on the specific clinical risk factors in individual patients and include age, immobility, and prior history of VTE. Medical patient risk assessment models (RAMs) are not fully developed, but a number of specific risk factors have been characterized. Although at present prophylactic treatment is largely empirical, studies evaluating the effects of higher-dose regimens in at-risk patients are ongoing. Long-term prophylaxis may be of benefit to particular patient populations, including those with congenital and acquired aberrations in hemostasis. Published studies of low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs) show that these agents are at least as effective as low-dose unfractionated heparin (UFH), with a trend towards an improved safety profile. The results of ongoing studies will provide further insight into the risk of VTE in this important patient group."
CD008201,0,26334115,0,Bleeding versus thrombosis: role of short DAPT in complex lesions.,"Therapy with dual antiplatelet agents, defined as the combination of a platelet P2Y12 inhibitor and aspirin, is required to prevent thrombotic complications, after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent implantation. Usually current guidelines recommend administration of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) following percutaneous revascularization with drug-eluting stent (DES) for a period of at least 12 months or for 6 to 12 months in patients not at high risk. Nevertheless, the treatment of stable/unstable coronary artery disease with DES implantation increasing largely, the optimal duration of DAPT is still unclear. The duration of DAPT after coronary stenting has been evaluated in recent randomized studies with conflicting results. The administration of long period of DAPT is a strategy to reduce thrombosis events but largely increase the hemorrhagic ones. Otherwise, shorter DAPT period is protective about bleeds with consequently increased ischemic events. In addition, as new DES carry a lower risk of stent thrombosis (ST) compared with the first-generation DES and possibly even bare-metal stents, a shift toward better protection from ST may have an effect on the duration and the intensity of DAPT. Whether the duration of DAPT should be shorter or longer than the currently recommended 6 to 12 months is analyzed in this review, drawing on results from the most recent studies and meta-analysis."

Based on robust data from randomized controlled studies and meta-analyses showing a reduced incidence of VTE by 40% to about 60% with pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis, prevention of VTE with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), unfractionated heparin (UFH), or fondaparinux is currently recommended in all at-risk hospitalized acutely ill medical patients. In patients who are bleeding or are at high risk for major bleeding, mechanical prophylaxis with graduated compression stockings or intermittent pneumatic compression may be suggested. Thromboprophylaxis is generally continued for 6 to 14 days or for the duration of hospitalization. Selected cases could benefit from extended thromboprophylaxis beyond this period, although the risk of major bleeding remains a concern, and additional studies are needed to identify patients who may benefit from prolonged prophylaxis. For hospitalized acutely ill medical patients with renal insufficiency, a low dose (1.5 mg once daily) of fondaparinux or prophylactic LMWH subcutaneously appears to have a safe profile, although proper evaluation in randomized studies is lacking. The evidence on the use of prophylaxis for VTE in this latter group of patients, as well as in those at higher risk of bleeding complications, such as patients with thrombocytopenia, remains scarce. For critically ill patients hospitalized in intensive care units with no contraindications, LMWH or UFH are recommended, with frequent and careful assessment of the risk of bleeding. In this review, we discuss the evidence for use of thromboprophylaxis for VTE in acutely ill hospitalized medical patients, with a focus on (low-dose) fondaparinux."

Also, atrial fibrillation (AF) is common in this group of patients. Factors contributing to the occurrence of AF in patients undergoing dialysis include: age, presence of coronary heart disease, echocardiographic abnormalities (low ejection fraction, atrial enlargement, valvular calcification, left ventricular hypertrophy), heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, stroke, malnutrition (low levels of albumin, total cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein (HDL), secondary hyperparathyroidism, low predialysis systolic blood pressure, duration of renal replacement therapy as well as the method of renal replacement therapy (more frequent in haemodialysis patients). The optimal management of thromboprophylaxis in patients with CKD and AF is complex due to the fact that in patients with CKD many physiologic mechanisms are altered which lead to substantial changes in haemostasis and thus this group of patients is characterized by an increased risk of thrombotic and haemorrhagic complications. Recommendations concerning the treatment of patients with AF do not include guidelines on how to manage patients with advanced CKD, due to the lack of large randomized trials assessing the efficacy and benefits of drugs in these patients. Patients with CKD and permanent, persistent, and paroxysmal AF ought to be treated as a group with high risk of bleeding and ischaemic stroke. In case of patients with no or only one moderate risk factors, it seems that anticoagulation with antiplatelet drugs can be considered as efficient therapy, while in patients with ≥2 risk factors an oral anticoagulation therapy may be used. During long-term treatment, the international normalized ratio (INR) must be controlled at least every 14 days and adjusted within a target range of 2.0-2.5. Moreover, renal function should be evaluated before initiation of direct thrombin or factor Xa inhibitors and re-evaluated when clinically indicated and at least annually."

Furthermore, there is a reduction in central collateral vessel formation from incursions into the superior vena cava, associated with peripherally inserted central catheters. Midline use was examined in a cystic fibrosis control group. Lines were checked daily until removal. All midline catheter tips were sent for culture on removal and data from 42 midlines placed in 2006 were retrieved from the hospital scientist for analysis. Twenty-seven inpatients with cystic fibrosis were identified and informed of the trial and possible risks of midline use. Outcome variables included infection and thrombus rates. On conclusion of the trial, data demonstrated both zero infection and thrombus rates in the study patient population. Midline catheters were monitored for a further 12 months following conclusion of the trial and infection rates continued to be below 1% and thrombus rates lower than 2%.

Protocol also has been adopted for patients implanted with a circulatory assist device or a TAH. This paper presents our criteria on supervision and treatment of coagulation with such patients, who reflect all the acquired pathology in clinical hemostasis. From 04/86 to 07/94, 82 patients underwent TAH as a bridge to transplantation. Mean age: 38. Overall duration of mechanical support: 1930 days (mean: 23), of which 137 and 603 for 2 patients. Average duration of CPB: 150 min. Systematic approach to complex TAH-blood interaction and pre-operative multiple organ dysfunction used to control bleeding and/or thromboembolism after CPB. In addition to routine tests, specific regular testing was carried out at least once a day for platelet functions, for thrombin formation and its regulatory pathways, and for the fibrinolytic system. Patients were treated with small doses of Heparin, large doses of Dypyridamole, small doses of Aspirin, modulated doses of Aprotinin, Ticlopidine, Pentoxifylline, FFP, as well as Fibrinogen and AT III concentrates. Dosage was adapted to patient's clinical profile as well as to test interpretation criteria to provide personalized treatment. DIC, widely present in its different phases, was thus diagnosed and treated. All DIC bleeding was controlled, making it possible to detect other causes of post-operatory bleeding and use blood derivates rationally. There were no thromboembolic complications and no iatrogenic bleeding. TAH explanation shows no evidence of macroscopic clots in high risk sites, confirmed by microscopic analysis."

This was assessed by means of a postal survey to all consultant general surgeons in Wales in 1996-1997. The areas covered were: awareness of the guidelines of The Royal College of Surgeons of England and the impact of such guidelines on their practice, attendance at hernia courses, operative technique, materials used for repair and skin suture, proportion of day case hernias, length of inpatient stay, thromboembolic (TE) prophylaxis and postoperative advice to patients with regard to light work, heavy work and sport. In all, 79 replies were received (85%). Almost all the surgeons had read the guidelines; this changed the practice of 20% of respondents but did not in 32%. A further 48% did not answer the question. In contrast with our 1993 survey results, in Wales there is now a uniform surgical management of adult inguinal hernias: the most common operation is the Liechtenstein, with monofilament non-absorbable suture to secure the mesh, followed by the Shouldice repair. The Bassini and inguinal darn operations are becoming much less common and none now uses braided or absorbable sutures for the repair. Skin closure is still rather variable, with only 58% of respondents adhering to the recommended absorbable subcuticular suture. Postoperative advice is now uniform and in accordance with the guidelines. A trend towards more TE prophylaxis and more day case hernia surgery is also seen."
CD008201,0,20126839,0,Multi-screen electronic alerts to augment venous thromboembolism prophylaxis.,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis in high-risk patients is frequently underutilised. We previously devised a one-screen computer alert program that identified hospitalised patients at high risk for VTE who were not receiving prophylaxis and advised their physicians to prescribe prophylaxis. While this strategy reduced the 90-day incidence of symptomatic VTE by 41%, the majority of electronic alerts were ignored. We have now developed a serial three-screen alert computer program designed to educate physicians who initially declined to order prophylaxis after a single screen alert. Of a total cohort of 880, the responsible physicians for 425 patients received a single electronic alert, whereas 455 who declined prophylaxis after the first screen received the second and third screens of the novel three-screen alert. Our enhanced serial three-screen alert program generated VTE prophylaxis orders for 58.4% of the 455 patients whose physicians initially declined to order prophylaxis following the one-screen alert. There was no significant difference in symptomatic 90-day VTE rates between the two cohorts (2.8% for the one-screen vs. 2.2% for the three-screen, p=0.55). We conclude that our three-screen computer alert program can markedly increase prophylaxis among physicians who decline an initial single screen alert."
CD008201,0,9279716,0,Low-molecular-weight heparin in the emergency department treatment of venous thromboembolism.,"Accepted initial therapy for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is intravenous heparin infusion, which requires hospitalization, inhibits patient ambulation, consumes nursing time, and generates laboratory cost. The effects of heparin are unpredictable, and maintaining optimal anti-coagulation requires careful laboratory monitoring. Many patients are underdosed and 5-20% of heparin-treated patients suffer hemorrhagic complications. Low-molecular-weight (LMW) heparins have a predictable anticoagulant response, require no laboratory monitoring, and can be administered once or twice daily by subcutaneous injection, thus facilitating outpatient treatment. LMW heparins are at least as safe and effective as standard intravenous heparin for the treatment of uncomplicated DVT. LMW heparin use is associated with decreased admission rates, shorter lengths of stay, decreased nursing time, better patient quality of life, and lower laboratory costs. In our emergency department, we have adopted a LMW heparin protocol for the outpatient treatment of suspected or proven DVT."

For first metatarsal osteotomy (33 626 patients), DVT, pulmonary embolism and mortality rates were 0.01%, 0.02% and 0.04%, and for hindfoot fusions (7033 patients) the rates were 0.03%, 0.11% and 0.11%, respectively. The rate of pulmonary embolism in 1633 total ankle replacement patients was 0.06%, and there were no recorded DVTs and no deaths. Statistical analysis could only identify risk factors for venous thromboembolic events of increasing age and multiple comorbidities following fracture surgery. Venous thromboembolism following foot and ankle surgery is extremely rare, but this subset of fracture patients is at a higher risk. However, there is no evidence that thromboprophylaxis reduces this risk, and these national data suggest that prophylaxis is not required in most of these patients."
CD008201,0,9835793,0,[The use of vena cava filters in Denmark].,"By means of a questionnaire we studied the current indications for and the extent of the use of vena cava filters (VCF) in 325 Danish hospital departments. Two hundred and eighty (86%) responded. Only six clinical and four radiological departments (4%) used VCF. Eighteen percent did not find any indications for the use of VCF, 32% were not familiar with the method, and 46% replied that they did not have the relevant patient population. The reported indications for VCF are consistent with the international guidelines. We discussed the scientific background, indications and limitations for the use of VCF and concluded that the current use of VCF in Denmark probably is less than optimal. VCF should be considered in patients with pulmonary embolism or at high risk of pulmonary embolism when anticoagulant therapy is contraindicated."

CD008201,0,11206019,0,Thrombosis prophylaxis in the acutely ill medical patient: insights from the prophylaxis in MEDical patients with ENOXaparin (MEDENOX) trial.,"The clinical benefit and cost-effectiveness of routine thromboprophylaxis in surgical patients has been well documented, but use of this approach in general medical patients remains controversial. Following is an overview of major insights from the prophylaxis in Medical patients with Enoxaparin (MEDENOX) trial, which was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of 2 dosage regimens of the low-molecular-weight heparin enoxaparin for prevention of venous thromboembolism in acutely ill medical patients. MEDENOX was a prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, which enrolled 1,102 hospitalized patients from 68 centers in 9 countries. Patients were randomly assigned to receive 40 mg of enoxaparin, 20 mg of enoxaparin, or placebo, given subcutaneously once a day for 6-14 days. The primary outcome was venous thromboembolism (deep-vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism) between days 1 and 14. At the 40-mg dose, the risk of venous thromboembolism was significantly reduced in patients with heart failure, as well as in patients with other medical illnesses, including respiratory failure, infectious disease, or rheumatic disorders. The incidence of venous thromboembolism was 5.5% in the group that received 40 mg of enoxaparin as compared with 14.9% in the group that received placebo (p <0.001), a benefit that was maintained at 3-month follow-up. There was no significant difference in the incidence of venous thromboembolism between the group that received 20 mg of enoxaparin (15%) and the placebo group. Adverse effects did not significantly differ between the placebo group and either enoxaparin group. This study clearly establishes an effective strategy for lowering the risk of venous thromboembolism in the acutely ill population and provides a framework for future trials in this area."
CD008201,0,25771089,0,[The genetics of thrombosis in cancer].,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a multifactorial and complex disease in which the interaction of genetic factors (estimated at 60%) and environmental factors (e.g., the use of oral contraceptives, pregnancy, immobility and cancer) determine the risk of thrombosis for each individual. In particular, the association between thrombosis and cancer is well established. Approximately 20% of patients with cancer develop a thromboembolic event over the course of the natural history of the tumor process, with thrombosis being the second leading cause of death for these patients. One of the greatest challenges currently facing the field of oncology is the identification of patients at high risk of VTE who can benefit from thromboprophylaxis. Currently, there is a VTE risk prediction model for patients with cancer (the Khorana risk score); however, its ability to identify patients at high risk is very low. It is important to note that this score, which is based on five clinical parameters, ignores the genetic variability associated with VTE risk. In this article, we present the preliminary results of the Oncothromb study, whose objective is to develop an individual VTE risk prediction model for patients with cancer who are treated with outpatient chemotherapy. Our model includes the clinical and genetic data on each patient (Thrombo inCode(®) genetic profile). Only by integrating multiple layers of biological information (clinical, plasmatic and genetic) we could obtain models that provide accurate information as to which patients are at high risk of developing a thromboembolic event associated with cancer so as to take appropriate prophylactic measures."

This study examined the prevalence and risk factors of VTE in patients undergoing arthroplasty without thromboprophylaxis. A total of 1608 patients who underwent elective knee or hip arthroplasty between 1996 and 2009 were evaluated. The incidence of VTE was 1.99% (n = 32). Of them, 0.24% (n = 4) were diagnosed with a pulmonary embolism. The risk factors associated with VTE were female sex, revision surgery, bilateral simultaneous procedure, CVA (cerebrovascular accident; thromboembolic stroke) history, and preoperative platelet count (all P > .05). There was an annual increase in the prevalence of VTE from 1996 to 2009 (P = .002). According to these results, thromboprophylaxis is strongly recommended in high-risk groups of Korean arthroplasty patients."

CD008201,0,19381022,0,[Deep vein thrombosis in patients with cancer].,"Malignancy can cause deep vein thrombosis(DVT)through: extrinsic compression; venous stasis due to intravenous invasion; secondary factors such as prolonged bed rest; and malignancy-induced abnormal coagulation and fibrinolysis. Various factors secreted from malignant tumors can reportedly cause systemic hypercoagulation, and tumor cells activate monocytes and macrophages to release tumor necrotic factor(TNF)-a and interleukin(IL)-6, which damage endothelial cells. Of the various onset factors for DVT, malignancy accounts for 15.6% in Japan, but discovery of malignancy at the onset of DVT or during follow-up is not rare, and malignancy is often involved with recurrent DVT or idiopathic DVT without a clear onset factor. Thorough testing must therefore be performed in patients with idiopathic or recurrent DVT while keeping malignancy in mind. As cancer patients are at risk for DVT, preventative management including hemorrhagic complication prevention is also required during surgery, chemotherapy, hormone therapy or prolonged bed rest."

CD008201,0,26140884,0,Coagulation Profile Changes Due to Thromboprophylaxis and Platelets in Trauma Patients at High-Risk for Venous Thromboembolism.,"We hypothesize there are coagulation profile changes associated both with initiation of thromboporphylaxis (TPX) and with change in platelet levels in trauma patients at high-risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE). A total of 1203 trauma intensive care unit patients were screened with a VTE risk assessment profile. In all, 302 high-risk patients (risk assessment profile score ≥ 10) were consented for weekly thromboelastography. TPX was initiated between initial and follow-up thromboelastography. Seventy-four patients were analyzed. Upon admission, 87 per cent were hypercoagulable, and 81 per cent remained hypercoagulable by Day 7 (P = 0.504). TPX was initiated 3.4 ± 1.4 days after admission; 68 per cent received unfractionated heparin and 32 per cent received low-molecular-weight heparin. The VTE rate was 18 per cent, length of stay 38 (25-37) days, and mortality of 17.6 per cent. In all, 76 per cent had a rapid clotting time at admission versus 39 per cent at Day 7 (P < 0.001); correcting from 7.75 (6.45-8.90) minutes to 10.45 (7.90-15.25) minutes (P < 0.001). At admission, 41 per cent had an elevated maximum clot formation (MCF) and 85 per cent had at Day 7 (P < 0.001); increasing from 61(55-65) mm to 75(69-80) mm (P < 0.001). Platelets positively correlated with MCF at admission (r = 0.308, R(2) = 0.095, P = 0.008) and at Day 7 (r = 0.516, R(2) = 0.266, P < 0.001). Change in platelet levels correlated with change in MCF (r = 0.332, R(2) = 0.110, P = 0.005). In conclusion, hypercoagulability persists despite the use of TPX. Although clotting time normalizes, MCF increases in correlation with platelet levels. As platelet function is a dominant contributor to sustained trauma-evoked hypercoagulability, antiplatelet therapy may be indicated in the management of severely injured trauma patients."

It is understandable that overwhelming majority of publications are dealing with major surgery (when usually several days hospitalization is required) while much less papers focus on one-day surgery cases. In this paper a brief survey on VTE epidemiology and prevention is carried out based on the new international and the 4th Hungarian Antithrombotic Guideline.

A pilot randomised placebo-controlled trial.,"The risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) is elevated in the postpartum period. Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) reduces the risk of VTE in many settings but is costly, inconvenient and increases bleeding. Randomised controlled trials (RCT) are required to determine if LMWH prophylaxis provides a clinical benefit in high-risk postpartum women. We sought to determine if a placebo-controlled RCT was feasible. We conducted a multi-national, double-blind pilot RCT in ""high risk"" postpartum women comparing 21 days of prophylactic dose LMWH to identical saline placebo injections. The primary pilot outcome was mean number of recruited women per centre per month. The planned primary outcome for the full trial was symptomatic objectively confirmed VTE or asymptomatic proximal deep-vein thrombosis diagnosed by a screening bilateral leg vein ultrasound at day 21. In six centres, a total of 1,346 potentially eligible women were approached to participate; 968 were ineligible, leaving 378 (31.5%) eligible patients. Of these, only 25 (6.6%) were randomised at a rate of 0.7 per centre per month. The primary reasons for declining participation were to avoid study injections and being too overwhelmed to participate in research. None of the participants had a VTE during follow-up. In conclusion, despite an adequate number of eligible participants, our double-blind RCT design was not feasible due to a very low consent rate. Other experimental approaches may be necessary to generate evidence in this important area of research."

CD008201,0,15605700,0,Effective anticoagulation therapy: defining the gap between clinical studies and clinical practice.,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) greatly increases the risk of stroke. Long-term oral therapy with warfarin reduces the risk of AF-related stroke by 62%, and national guidelines now call for warfarin therapy in most patients without specific contraindications to anticoagulation. However, the drug's narrow therapeutic index means that warfarin therapy must be guided by coagulation monitoring. This requirement and other inherent limitations of warfarin have led to widespread underutilization and underanticoagulation in AF patients who require antithrombotic therapy for stroke prevention. Recent studies indicate that in many health systems less than half of warfarin-eligible patients take the drug and even fewer are adequately maintained within a protective therapeutic range. Similarly, despite the documented efficacy of anticoagulation in patients at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and related pulmonary embolism, prophylaxis for DVT, even in high-risk situations such as following orthopedic surgery, is suboptimal. This article explores the scope of warfarin underutilization and underanticoagulation that exists in current clinical practice. The clinical consequences of warfarin underuse are also described. Discussion in the roundtable after this review explores the causes for the wide treatment gap between anticoagulation clinical trial results and clinical practice outcomes. The economic implications of such a gap and strategies for closing the gap are also discussed by the panelists."

An important problem is that the diagnose is easy to overlook because the signs and symptoms are often difficult to recognize. Why do DVT and PE remain such a serious problem, particularly given the availability of effective strategies for preventing and treating them? The answer lays primarily in the failure to consistently use evidence-based interventions in high-risk individuals and in the lack of adherence to the different prophylactic interventions. In order to impact the incidence and burden of DVT/PE and increase public awareness, implementation of electronic alerts and evidence-based approaches, and scientific translational research are required.

Dabigatran has several advantages over warfarin including predictable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics which eliminates the need for routine laboratory monitoring, superiority over warfarin in preventing stroke, or systemic embolism without having an increased risk of bleeding. However, as with any anticoagulant, there remains a real chance of bleeding, including major or life-threatening hemorrhage. Many physicians feel comfortable managing bleeding complications on older anticoagulants like warfarin and heparin, due to extensive experience with the medications along with antidotes to reverse their effects as well as established protocols for treating anticoagulant-associated hemorrhage. However, most physicians have limited clinical experience with dabigatran, there is no specific antidote for dabigatran reversal and there is a paucity of protocols, guidelines, and recommendations for how to manage dabigatran-associated hemorrhage. In this review, we present a case series of patients admitted to our institution for management of bleeding while receiving dabigatran. We retrospectively reviewed these cases to evaluate the efficacy and rationale of the various anticoagulation reversal strategies employed in the context of the existing evidence found in the literature. Specific focus is placed on the therapies utilized and the coagulation studies used to manage these patients."

CD008201,0,18023713,0,Thrombophilia and risk of venous thrombosis in patients with cancer.,"Venous thrombosis is a common and severe complication in patients with cancer. We reviewed studies assessing whether a state of acquired or congenital thrombophilia influenced the risk of thrombosis in patients with cancer. The results are equivocal. However, the majority of studies were of limited size. The influence of thrombophilia in patients with cancer may be more difficult to demonstrate than in the general population, the risk of thrombosis due to cancer per se possibly outweighing the contribution of thrombophilic factors. Moreover, the results may depend on the genetic background of the population, the type of cancer, the type of thrombosis, and the chemotherapeutic treatment. Nevertheless, it appears that factor V Leiden or G20210A prothrombin gene mutation increases the risk of venous thromboembolism about 2- to 4-fold, compared with patients with cancer without either of these mutations. Similar results were observed for the occurrence of central venous catheter-associated thrombosis. Antiphospholipid antibodies and acquired resistance to activated protein C were frequently observed in patients with cancer and appeared to favor the occurrence of thrombosis. The role of hyperhomocysteinemia deserves further investigation. Since the clinical implications of these findings remain to be clarified, routine screening of cancer patients for thrombophilia cannot yet be recommended on the basis of these studies. Studies designed to assess the value of thromboprophylaxis in high-risk patients, including thrombophilic patients, with long-term central venous catheters may be valuable."
CD008201,0,17240604,0,Atrial fibrillation.,"Over 2 million people in the Untied States are known to have AF, and this number is expected to rise to 5 to 6 million in the next 50 years. In spite of advances in detection and treatment of AF, it is still associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Treatment currently consists of rhythm management and prevention of embolic events (anticoagulation). Although two strategies of rhythm management exist (heart rate control and heart rhythm control), a distinct advantage of one over the other has not yet been determined. Because of the increasing numbers of patients who have AF in the general population and newer surgical approaches to dealing with AF, the anesthesiologist encounters patients who have AF on an almost daily basis. Fortunately, national and international guidelines exist for the treatment of pre-existing AF and dealing with anticoagulated patients in the perioperative period, clearly indicating whether a patient is adequately managed or not by current standards of practice. With respect to the new development of AF in the perioperative period, cardiac and thoracic surgeries are particularly associated with this phenomenon. Guidelines have been published for the perioperative management of AF after cardiac surgery, and are in accordance with the findings from studies in thoracic surgery. Beta-blockers and amiodarone are strongly recommended for the pre-emptive treatment of AF in high-risk patients, whereas amiodarone and sotalol are the agents of choice in those patients developing AF after surgery not requiring urgent cardioversion. The recent discoveries of properties of statins other than their lipid-lowering abilities has sparked wide interest in the possibility of this family of drugs having a protective role against AF in many scenarios. It remains to be seen whether statins will prove to be adjunct in patients at high risk for AF in the perioperative period."

CD008201,0,11286310,0,Atrial fibrillation: is there a role for low-molecular-weight heparin?,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common form of tachyarrhythmia and carries a significant risk of serious thromboembolic complications. Anticoagulation is used for long-term thromboprophylaxis and for short-term management in a number of clinical situations, among which is the medical or electrical cardioversion of AF to sinus rhythm. Current guidelines recommend prompt cardioversion with heparin cover for AF of <48 h duration, and several weeks of warfarin therapy prior to cardioversion when the duration of disease is longer. Recent animal and human studies, however, have shown that swifter cardioversion is likely to be more successful in achieving sinus rhythm and in reducing the risk of recurrence of AF. Other observations have demonstrated that thrombi can develop within a few hours of the development of AF. These considerations suggest that cardioversion should be carried out as early as possible in all cases, and that the most sensitive means of detecting atrial thrombi, currently transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), should be used to screen all patients prior to cardioversion. Within this context, there is growing interest in the use of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) as an anticoagulant therapy in AF. Compared with unfractionated heparin, LMWH therapy does not involve prolonged intravenous administration, hospitalization, or laboratory monitoring; LMWH therefore has the potential to greatly simplify anticoagulation therapy for AF, especially pericardioversion. Recent studies have demonstrated that LMWH can be used safely and effectively in place of unfractionated heparin for acute treatment at the onset of AF and during early cardioversion. For example, in patients with AF, a strategy of immediate administration of dalteparin (100 IU/kg s.c. twice daily) continued for 11 days, combined with early TEE and immediate cardioversion in patients with no thrombus, resulted in sinus rhythm in 74% of patients after a median of 7 days. Low-molecular-weight heparin therapy may also find a role perioperatively and in selected patients, notably those with warfarin intolerance, as a replacement for warfarin following cardioversion. Controlled clinical studies are still required, however, to establish a firm, evidence-based foundation for the use of LMWHs in AF."
CD008201,0,22389165,0,Cancer and coagulation.,"Thromboembolism, including both venous and arterial events, occurs commonly amongst patients with cancer. The occurrence of thromboembolism has significant consequences for cancer patients, including direct and indirect associations with mortality, morbidity, requirement for long-term anticoagulant therapy and consumption of healthcare resources. Recent studies have resulted in a better understanding of clinical risk factors and biomarkers of cancer-associated thrombosis, and a risk assessment model incorporating both has now been validated in multiple settings. Thromboprophylaxis with either unfractionated heparin or low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs) has been shown to be safe and effective in high-risk settings such as hospitalization for medical illness and the postsurgical period. Emerging new data from randomized studies have focused on outpatient prophylaxis, suggesting potential benefits in this setting as well. Treatment of cancer-associated thrombosis requires long-term anticoagulation with LMWH. Results from ongoing and planned trials of novel anticoagulants in the cancer setting are awaited."

Nineteen consecutive patients with a first anterior wall AMI who received 1,500,000 IU of streptokinase within 3 hours of symptom onset, followed by full anticoagulation, underwent echocardiographic studies within 24 hours of symptoms, and then on days 2, 3, 5, 7, 12, 30 and 90. Forty-four patients, with comparable clinical features and echocardiographic protocol but without antithrombotic therapy, served as the control group. LV thrombi developed in 4 of 19 (21%) treated patients and in 23 of 44 (52%) control subjects (p = 0.02). LV aneurysm or major wall motion abnormalities were noted in 8 of 19 (42%) treated patients and in 30 of 44 (68%) control subjects (p less than 0.05). No significant difference was found between treated and untreated patients when comparing the incidence of thrombi in the subgroups of patients with aneurysm or major wall motion abnormalities (3 of 8 vs 21 of 30) and in the subgroups with less extensive LV dysfunction. Thrombi disappeared during hospitalization in 3 of 4 treated patients, but in none of the controls. Fewer patients treated with intravenous streptokinase followed by full anticoagulation developed LV thrombi compared to patients treated with conventional therapy. This difference may be related to a reduced occurrence of major LV wall motion abnormalities. Resolution of thrombi frequently occurs in the hospital phase of AMI; therefore, only frequent echocardiographic examinations can assess the true frequency of LV thrombi."

We analysed data from the global ENDORSE survey to evaluate VTE risk and prophylaxis use in this population according to diagnosis, baseline characteristics, and country. Data on patient characteristics, VTE risk, and prophylaxis use were abstracted from hospital charts. VTE risk and prophylaxis use were evaluated according to the 2004 American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) guidelines. Multivariable analysis was performed to identify factors associated with use of ACCP-recommended prophylaxis. Data were evaluated for 37,356 hospitalised medical patients across 32 countries. VTE risk varied according to medical diagnosis, from 31.2% of patients with gastrointestinal/hepatobiliary diseases to 100% of patients with acute heart failure, active non-infectious respiratory disease, or pulmonary infection (global rate, 41.5%). Among those at risk for VTE, ACCP-recommended prophylaxis was used in 24.4% haemorrhagic stroke patients and 40-45% of cardiopulmonary disease patients (global rate, 39.5%). Large differences in prophylaxis use were observed among countries. Markers of disease severity, including central venous catheters, mechanical ventilation, and admission to intensive care units, were strongly associated with use of ACCP-recommended prophylaxis. In conclusion, VTE risk varies according to medical diagnosis. Less than 40% of at-risk hospitalised medical patients receive ACCP-recommended prophylaxis. Prophylaxis use appears to be associated with disease severity rather than medical diagnosis. These data support the necessity to improve implementation of available guidelines for evaluating VTE risk and providing prophylaxis to hospitalised medical patients."
CD008201,0,21855258,0,Mondor disease: a case report in ED.,"Mondor disease is a form of superficial thrombophlebitis affecting the subcutaneous veins, specifically of the anterolateral thoracoabdominal wall. Clinical presentation is commonly a subcutaneous, tender, painful cordlike induration, usually founded in the breast or axilla. It affects typically middle-aged women. A 36-year-old patient was admitted to the emergency department to a chest discomfort and to discovery of a palpable, nonerythematous, and painful cordlike structure running from the inferior pole of her left breast to the left iliac pit. She had no history of trauma, injury, or intensive physical activity. Ultrasonography confirmed thrombosis of the thoracoepigastric vein. A thrombophilic workup performed 2 years ago was normal. The patient was treated by enoxaparin 1 mg/kg per day for 30 days. Evolution was favorable. The etiology of Mondor disease remains unclear. Predisposing factors are mainly trauma, excessive physical activity, surgery, infections. Ultrasonography is used to confirm the diagnosis. Coagulation tests should be performed to exclude hypercoagulability condition. In the past, symptomatic approach with anti-inflammatory drugs was proposed. Recent guidelines suggest prophylactic or intermediate doses of low-molecular-weight heparin for at least 4 weeks. Although uncommon, Mondor disease has to be recognized to avoid useless diagnosis testing and to deliver a specific treatment."

CD008201,0,25740182,0,VTE risk assessment in cancer. Who needs prophylaxis and who does not?,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients with cancer is associated with an increased morbidity and mortality, and its prevention is of major clinical importance. However, the VTE rates in the cancer population vary between 0.5% - 20%, depending on cancer-, treatment- and patient-related factors. The most important contributors to VTE risk are the tumor entity, stage and certain anti-cancer treatments. Cancer surgery represents a strong risk factor for VTE, and medical oncology patients are at increased risk of developing VTE, especially when receiving chemotherapy or immunomodulatory drugs. Also biomarkers have been investigated for their usefulness to predict risk of VTE (e.g. elevated leukocyte and platelet counts, soluble P-selectin, D-dimer, etc.). In order to identify cancer patients at high risk of VTE and to improve risk stratification, risk assessment models have been developed, which contain both clinical parameters and biomarkers. While primary thromboprophylaxis with low-molecular-weight-heparin (LMWH) is recommended postoperatively for a period of up to 4 weeks after major cancer surgery, the evidence is less clear for medical oncology patients. Thromboprophylaxis in hospitalized medical oncology patients is advocated, and is based on results of randomized controlled trials which evaluated the efficacy and safety of LMWH for prevention of VTE in hospitalized medically ill patients. In recent trials the benefit of primary thromboprophylaxis in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy in the ambulatory setting has been investigated. However, at the present stage primary thromboprophylaxis for prevention of VTE in these patients is still a matter of debate and cannot be recommended for all cancer outpatients."

CD008201,0,25074356,0,Venous thromboembolism in hospitalized patients: an updated analysis of missed opportunities for thromboprophylaxis at a university-affiliated tertiary care center.,"Thromboprophylaxis remains often underused in hospitalized patients. In 2001, a cohort study done at our institution, a tertiary care center in Montreal, Canada, showed that 67.7% of VTE cases necessitating thromboprophylaxis were potentially preventable with adequate use of American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) guidelines. Following implementation of an institution-wide policy in 2005, we assessed the changes in the rate of potentially preventable VTE. We conducted a retrospective cohort study including all hospitalized patients with objectively diagnosed VTE in 2010 at our institution. Each case was classified as preventable (thromboprophylaxis indicated but inadequately administered), non-preventable (thromboprophylaxis indicated and correctly administered), spontaneous (thromboprophylaxis not indicated), and ineligible (contraindication to thromboprophylaxis). The results were compared to those obtained in 2001. Of the 230 cases of VTE, 55 cases were classified as potentially preventable (23.9%), 85 were non-preventable (37.0%), 74 were spontaneous (32.2%) and 16 (7.0%) were ineligible. Of the 140 cases requiring thromboprophylaxis, 39.3% were potentially preventable. The potentially preventable cases were mostly due to omission of thromboprophylaxis (50.9%), occurred during general medical admissions (74.5%), and the most common VTE risk factor was cancer (47.2%). In conclusion, we demonstrate a lower frequency of potentially preventable cases in 2010 compared to 2001 (39.3% vs 67.7%, respectively), partially due to physician education and adoption of an institution-wide policy. However, patients with medical indications for thromboprophylaxis, particularly those with cancer, are more prone to having preventable VTE, indicating an area for potential improvement."

CD008201,0,24625564,0,Prevalence of stroke and the need for thromboprophylaxis in young patients with atrial fibrillation: a cohort study.,"Atrial fibrillation is the most common cardiac arrhythmia, and age is a well-established independent risk factor for stroke in these patients. Whereas high-risk patients clearly benefit from anticoagulation to prevent stroke, less is known about how to treat low-risk patients. Despite the recent guidelines and studies demonstrating no benefit and excess bleeding risk with aspirin, many low-risk patients still receive this medication. Our objective was to determine the stroke rate in young patients with atrial fibrillation, a group of previously unstudied and predominantly low-risk patients. We hypothesized that the event rate would be so low as to preclude benefit from antithrombotic medications. A retrospective chart review identified patients with atrial fibrillation between the age of 18 and 35. Exclusion criteria included no ECG documentation of atrial fibrillation, anticoagulation, except around the time of cardioversion, and surgical valve disease. The primary outcome was stroke during the period of observation. The final cohort included 99 patients, mean age 27.6 years, followed for a mean of 4.3 years. Mean CHADS2 and CHA2DS2-VASc scores were 0.26 and 0.4, respectively. A total of 42.4% were taking aspirin for over 50% of the time. There was one event identified, a transient ischemic attack in a man not on aspirin with CHADS2 and CHADS2-VASc scores of 1, resulting in event rates of 0.234 per 100 patient-years overall or 0.392 among those not on aspirin. Patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation under age 35 have an exceedingly low stroke risk. We assert that aspirin may be unnecessary for most patients in this population, especially those with a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 0."

CD008201,0,15096320,0,Prevention of deep vein thrombosis in orthopedic surgery.,"In the absence of thromboprophylaxis, venous thromboembolism (VTE) affects about 50 to 80% of the patients after total hip replacement (THR), total knee replacement (TKR), or hip fracture surgery. Since stratification of patients in those who will become symptomatic and those who will not, is not possible, primary high risk thromboprophylaxis should be provided to all patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery of the lower extremity. Various non-pharmacologic and pharmacologic thromboprophylactic measures have been evaluated. With regard to pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis unfractionated heparin has now almost completely been replaced by low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) for VTE prophylaxis. The use of acetylsalicylic acid for thromboprophylaxis in patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery of the lower extremities is not recommended. The optimal beginning of LMWH thromboprophylaxis is either 2 hours preoperatively or 6 to 8 hours postoperatively. Extended thromboprophylaxis (beyond 7 to 10 days after surgery) is recommended for high-risk patients. New antithrombotics, such as fondaparinux or (xi)melagatran, significantly reduce the risk of asymptomatic but not of symptomatic VTE compared to LMWH. In the light of other potential side effects (e.g., an increased bleeding risk) and high costs the role of these new drugs in the prophylaxis of VTE in patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery of the lower extremities remains to be established."
CD008201,0,9286577,0,Pancreas transplantation at the University of Maryland.,"1. The University of Maryland pancreas transplant program was initiated in July 1991. Through December 1996, 230 pancreas transplants were performed (145 SPK, 64 PAK, 21 PTA). Overall one-year patient and graft survival rates were 95.5% and 78.9%, respectively. 2. The majority of pancreases have been transplanted simultaneously with a kidney. The one-year patient, pancreas and kidney survival rates for SPK transplants were 95.5%, 91.9%, and 82.5%, respectively. 3. Pancreas alone (PA = PAK or PTA) transplants have represented an increasing proportion of the total in recent years. Although the results of PA were previously inferior to SPK transplants, recent developments have made the outcomes equivalent. The advent of FK and MMF have sharply reduced graft losses due to irreversible rejection. Percutaneous pancreas biopsy now provides a safe and effective means to diagnose acute rejection in a timely manner. Anticoagulation protocols have markedly reduced the risk of idiopathic postoperative graft thrombosis. The most recent series of 71 PA cases at our center had a one-year graft survival rate of 75.8% overall, and 88.2% for the 61 technically successful ones. 4. The most widely practiced pancreas transplant technique in the US today includes bladder drainage of exocrine secretions. This results in a high incidence of bladder complications, which can be avoided by enteric exocrine drainage. The most recent series of pancreas transplants at the University of Maryland have been enteric drained, encompassing about half of all cases. Adoption of this technique has eliminated bladder complications, and has not been associated with an increase in anastomotic leaks, infectious complications or graft loss. 5. Most pancreas transplants have had systemic venous drainage via the iliac vein. We recently adopted the portal venous drainage technique, since it eliminates the peripheral hyperinsulinemia associated with systemic drainage, and may therefore improve lipid metabolism and possibly reduce the risk of progression of atherosclerosis. Early results have been favorable. 6. At present the major determinant of pancreas transplant outcome is donor quality. We have emphasized the importance of using pancreases free of fatty or fibrotic transformation, which have been skillfully procured from young, stable, non-obese donors."

CD008201,0,23732637,0,Managing patients with stable respiratory disease planning air travel: a primary care summary of the British Thoracic Society recommendations.,"Air travel poses medical challenges to passengers with respiratory disease, principally because of exposure to a hypobaric environment. In 2002 the British Thoracic Society published recommendations for adults and children with respiratory disease planning air travel, with a web update in 2004. New full recommendations and a summary were published in 2011, containing key recommendations for the assessment of high-risk patients and identification of those likely to require in-flight supplemental oxygen. This paper highlights the aspects of particular relevance to primary care practitioners with the following key points: (1) At cabin altitudes of 8000 feet (the usual upper limit of in-flight cabin pressure, equivalent to 0.75 atmospheres) the partial pressure of oxygen falls to the equivalent of breathing 15.1% oxygen at sea level. Arterial oxygen tension falls in all passengers; in patients with respiratory disease, altitude may worsen preexisting hypoxaemia. (2) Altitude exposure also influences the volume of any air in cavities, where pressure x volume remain constant (Boyle's law), so that a pneumothorax or closed lung bulla will expand and may cause respiratory distress. Similarly, barotrauma may affect the middle ear or sinuses if these cavities fail to equilibrate. (3) Patients with respiratory disease require clinical assessment and advice before air travel to: (a) optimise usual care; (b) consider contraindications to travel and possible need for in-flight oxygen; (c) consider the need for secondary care referral for further assessment; (d) discuss the risk of venous thromboembolism; and (e) discuss forward planning for the journey."
CD008201,0,22016873,0,Use of low-molecular-weight heparin and a deep vein thrombosis protocol to prevent DVT in elderly patients with trauma.,"Thromboembolic events (TEs), including pulmonary embolisms (PEs), are life threatening. Older patients with trauma are at significantly higher risk for these complications. In March 2003, a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis protocol was implemented for use in all trauma patients admitted to our hospital. Here we report on the results of using this protocol for patients aged 65 years or older. A risk-stratified DVT/PE prophylaxis protocol was developed, incorporating specific injuries and history and physiologic parameters, which favored aggressive therapy and included patients at highest risk for dying from PEs. Between March 2003 and June 2005, these data were collected on all trauma patients admitted to our level I hospital. Comparisons were made with historical controls (patients admitted in 2002, before implementation of this protocol). TE rates for the study period trended lower for patients aged 65 or older (6.4% vs 2.2%, P<.1). This protocol did not increase the incidence of bleeding events in this patient population. Protocol-based, risk-adjusted DVT/TE prophylaxis is safe and efficacious in elderly trauma patients who are at increased risk for TEs."

The design was a case series of 58 consecutive patients presenting with venous thromboembolism within 30 days of travel. The setting was a major metropolitan teaching hospital and an affiliated private practice. The main outcome measures were prevalence of clinical and laboratory risk factors for venous thromboembolism, time to presentation, mode and duration of travel. Forty-eight [83%; 95% confidence interval (CI), 71-91%] of 58 patients developed venous thromboembolism following air travel. Thirty-four (59%; 95% CI, 45-71%) patients had travelled for more than 8 h and most patients were diagnosed with venous thromboembolism within 1 week of completing their journey. Pulmonary embolism occurred in 24 patients (41%; 95% CI, 29-55%), proximal deep vein thrombosis in 23 patients (40%; 95% CI, 27-53%), calf vein thrombosis in four patients (7%; 95% CI, 2-17%), and superficial thrombophlebitis in seven patients (12%; 95% CI, 5-23%). At least one clinical or laboratory risk factor (other than travel) was found in 49 patients (84%; 95% CI, 73-93%) and two or more risk factors were found in 30 patients (52%; 95% CI, 38-65%). The most common risk factors were oestrogens (24%; 95% CI, 14-37%), a past history of thrombosis (24%: 95% CI, 14-37%), and factor V Leiden (24%: 95% CI, 14-37%). These retrospective uncontrolled data suggest that at least one clinical or laboratory risk factor is present prior to travel in more than 80% of patients who develop venous thromboembolism within 30 days of travel. In most cases these risk factors can be identified by the clinical history alone, without recourse to laboratory testing. Whether patients with known risk factors for venous thromboembolism prior to travel should be targeted with specific thromboprophylaxis requires randomized evaluation."

CD008201,0,12536351,0,Venous thromboembolic risk and its prevention in hospitalized medical patients.,"In medical patients, the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) is substantially underestimated and prophylaxis is used far less than in surgical patients, reflecting the scarcity of evidence supporting antithrombotic therapy in nonsurgical settings. However, current consensus documents recommend assessment of all medical, as well as surgical, patients for thromboembolic risk and provide prophylaxis recommendations according to the risk level, determined by the presence of different clinical and molecular risk factors. Although long-term, underlying clinical and molecular risk factors also have a major impact on overall risk in medical patients; risk clearly varies with the type of medical condition. Myocardial infarction, stroke, and malignant disease are linked to a high rate of VTE; recent evidence highlights patients with cardiopulmonary disease as a distinct risk group. Despite skepticism in some quarters, high-quality evidence confirms the efficacy of unfractionated heparin (UFH) and low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWH) in reducing asymptomatic deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in a broad spectrum of medical patients; further studies are required to clarify the effect on fatal pulmonary embolism (PE). Emerging data from the recent PRINCE and MEDENOX studies demonstrate that the LMWH enoxaparin provides effective and well-tolerated VTE prevention in patients with severe cardiopulmonary disease. Emerging evidence has led to a grade 1A recommendation for the use of thromboprophylaxis in these patients in the most recent consensus conference on thromboprophylaxis. Further studies, however, are required to clarify the optimal duration of prophylaxis in medical patients and to evaluate the potential role of outpatient prophylaxis. Accurate risk assessment and prompt implementation of appropriate prophylaxis, selected on the basis of evidence from well-designed controlled clinical trials, may reduce the future morbidity and mortality due to VTE in medical patients."
CD008201,0,26185371,0,Perioperative thrombotic complications in liver transplantation.,"Although the perioperative bleeding complications and the major side effects of blood transfusion have always been the primary concern in liver transplantation (OLT), the possible cohesion of an underestimated intrinsic hypercoagulative state during and after the transplant procedure may pose a major threat to both patient and graft survival. Thromboembolism during OLT is characterized not only by a complex aetiology, but also by unpredictable onset and evolution of the disease. The initiation of a procoagulant process may be triggered by various factors, such as inflammation, venous stasis, ischemia-reperfusion injury, vascular clamping, anatomical and technical abnormalities, genetic factors, deficiency of profibrinolytic activity, and platelet activation. The involvement of the arterial system, intracardiac thrombosis, pulmonary emboli, portal vein thrombosis, and deep vein thrombosis, are among the most serious thrombotic events in the perioperative period. The rapid detection of occlusive vascular events is of paramount importance as it heavily influences the prognosis, particularly when these events occur intraoperatively or early after OLT. Regardless of the lack of studies and guidelines on anticoagulant prophylaxis in this setting, many institutions recommend such an approach especially in the subset of patients at high risk. However, the decision of when, how and in what doses to use the various chemical anticoagulants is still a difficult task, since there is no common consensus, even for high-risk cases. The risk of postoperative thromboembolism causing severe hemodynamic events, or even loss of graft function, must be weighed and compared with the risk of an important bleeding. In this article we briefly review the risk factors and the possible predictors of major thrombotic complications occurring in the perioperative period, as well as their incidence and clinical features. Moreover, the indications to pharmacological prophylaxis and the current treatment strategies are also summarized."
CD008201,0,27625521,0,Thromboembolism and anticoagulation after Fontan surgery.,"This review attempts to answer the common questions faced by a clinician regarding thromboembolism and thromboprophylaxis in patients following Fontan surgery. The review is in an easy to understand question and answer format and discusses the currently available literature on the subject in an attempt to arrive at practical clinically relevant solutions. Patients who have undergone the Fontan operation are at a high risk for thromboembolism. Based on available evidence, there is a strong rationale for thromboprophylaxis. However, it is not clear as to which agent should be administered to prevent thromboembolic events. While the available evidence suggests that antiplatelet agents alone may be as good as oral anticoagulants, there is a need for a large multicenter randomized control trial comparing these two common strategies to deliver a clear verdict."

Improved instruments, such as the CHA₂DS₂VASc and HAS-BLED risk stratification scores, have been incorporated into European practice guidelines. Until recently, the most effective therapy for stroke prevention has been anticoagulation with a vitamin K antagonist, but new oral anticoagulants in development, antiarrhythmic drugs that reduce adverse cardiovascular events in patients with AF, and interventional techniques for occlusion of the left atrial appendage represent promising options for stroke prevention. These new strategies will need focused evaluation in the most challenging AF patients-those with a high risk of bleeding, prior thromboembolism, or thrombosis-prone surfaces such as mechanical heart valve prostheses or drug-eluting coronary stents, for whom the limitations of currently available treatment options and a paucity of data are particularly acute."

In this paper we describe the background and validation of the Swedish guidelines for obstetric thromboprophylaxis in women with moderate-high risk of VTE, that is, at similar or higher risk as the antepartum risk among women with history of thrombosis. The risk score is based on major risk factors (i.e., 5-fold increased risk of thromboembolism). We present data on the efficacy of the model, the cost-effectiveness, and the lifestyle advice that is given. We believe that the Swedish guidelines for obstetric thromboprophylaxis aid clinicians in providing women at increased risk of VTE with effective and appropriate thromboprophylaxis, thus avoiding both over- and under-treatment."

Because guidelines are heterogeneous, it was hypothesized that ""treatment strategies are not uniform in clinical practice"". Between February 2003 and May 2003, a questionnaire with 4 different clinical scenarios was distributed to physicians by e-mail, or direct contact was made by a survey monitor. Two scenarios described the cases of patients with a mechanical heart valve (MHV) in the mitral position, with additional risk factors for a systemic embolism; one undergoing major (scenario 1) and the other minor surgery (scenario 3). Two scenarios described patients with an aortic MHV; one undergoing major (scenario 2) and the other minor (scenario 4) surgery. Different preoperative and postoperative management options were offered. The treatment options for all scenarios were the same. Of the 90 questionnaires distributed, 52 (57.8%) were returned. Hospitalization for full-dose intravenous unfractionated heparin (IV UH) was the most commonly selected strategy in the preoperative phase for scenarios 1 (59%), 2 (42%) and 3 (44%). In scenario 4, 34% chose IV UH. Outpatient, full- dose, subcutaneous UH or low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) was the most selected option in the postoperative phase for all scenarios, with the exception of number 4 (52.9% in scenario 1, 34% in scenario 2, 32%, in scenario 3 and 28% in scenario 4). Even among expert clinicians, the management of perioperative anticoagulation is heterogeneous. In particular, the definition of risk categories and the optimal intensity of antithrombotic drugs need to be defined by well-designed prospective studies."

While the introduction of thromboprophylactic measures has most likely affected the present occurrence of postoperative VTE, there is an increasing awareness of the importance of medical conditions in determining thromboembolic events. Among the conditions that predispose patients to VTE are increasing age, cancer and its treatment, prolonged immobility, stroke or paralysis, previous VTE, congestive heart failure,acute infection, pregnancy or puerperium, dehydration, hormonal treatment, varicose veins, long air travel, acute inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatologic disease, and nephrotic syndrome. Other factors that have recently been associated with an increased risk of VTE disorders include persistent elevation of D-dimer and atherosclerotic disease. Recognition of the incidence and clinical importance of thrombosis will most likely encourage more widespread use of antithrombotic prophylaxis in medical patients."
CD008201,0,20036921,0,Clinical biomarkers and management of post thrombotic syndrome.,"The post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) is a long-term complication of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) that is characterized by chronic, persistent pain, swelling and other signs in the affected limb. PTS is common, burdensome and costly. It is likely to increase in prevalence, since despite widespread use of and improvements in the efficacy of thromboprophylaxis, the incidence of DVT has not decreased over time. Preventing ipsilateral recurrence of DVT, by ensuring an adequate duration and intensity of anticoagulation for the initial DVT and by prescribing situational thromboprophylaxis after discontinuation of oral anticoagulants, is likely to reduce the risk of developing PTS. Pending the results of ongoing studies, stockings are recommended in patients with persistent symptoms or swelling after DVT. Future research should focus on standardizing criteria for PTS diagnosis, identification of DVT patients at high risk for PTS, and rigorously evaluating the effectiveness of stockings, thrombolysis, and venoactive drugs in preventing or treating PTS."

CD008201,0,26194057,0,Use of Heparin in Acute Ischemic Stroke: Is There Still a Role?,"Heparin has long been a contested therapy in acute ischemic stroke (AIS). In current practice, heparin is considered on a case-by-case basis, but there is no consensus as to the appropriate timing of anticoagulation or for which ischemic stroke subtypes heparin may be beneficial. To provide better clarity on this issue, we review current research focusing on the use of heparin in AIS in each stroke subtype and subsequently make recommendations to provide readers with a systematic approach to managing complex stroke patients for which acute anticoagulation may be valuable. We conclude that there are certain subpopulations of ischemic stroke patients that may derive benefit from heparin when given acutely, including patients with symptomatic large artery stenosis >70 %, non-occlusive intraluminal thrombus, and in patients with high-risk cardiac conditions including left ventricular thrombus, left ventricular assist devices, and mechanical heart valves."

The aim of this review was to compare the effectiveness of both lengths of stocking and consider the implications for nursing practice. An electronic search was performed using Medline and Cinahl and a hand search was also conducted. Four studies and a literature review were selected. These studies indicated that knee-length AE stockings were equally effective as were associated with better patient compliance and were more cost-effective than thigh-length stockings. However, as with thigh-length stockings, they require accurate measurement and correct fitting if associated complications are to be avoided, highlighting the need for better education for both practitioners and patients."

It recommended that all hospitalised patients should undergo a VTE risk assessment. In 2006, an audit in medical patients at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust (GSTFT) revealed a lack of documentation of VTE risk assessment and poor use of thromboprophylaxis in 'at risk' patients.

CD008201,0,15561695,0,Recent advances in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.,"Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is characterized by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia, accompanied by microvascular thrombosis that causes variable degrees of tissue ischemia and infarction. Intravascular coagulation is not a prominent feature of the disorder. Plasma exchange can induce remissions in approximately 80% of patients with idiopathic TTP, but patients have a much worse prognosis when thrombotic microangiopathy is associated with cancer, certain drugs, infections, or tissue transplantation. Recently, acquired autoimmune deficiency of a plasma metalloprotease named ADAMTS13 was shown to cause many cases of idiopathic TTP. This review describes our current understanding of how to use this knowledge clinically. In Section I, Dr. Joel Moake describes the presentation of thrombotic microangiopathy, emphasizing the pathophysiology of idiopathic TTP. Platelets adhere to ultra-large (or ""unusually large"") von Willebrand factor (ULVWF) multimers that are immobilized in exposed subendothelial connective tissue and secreted into the circulation in long ""strings"" from stimulated endothelial cells. ADAMTS13 cleaves ULVWF multimers within growing platelet aggregates under flowing conditions, and this normally limits platelet thrombus formation. If ADAMTS13 is absent, either congenitally or due to acquired autoantibodies, platelet-rich microvascular thrombosis proceeds unchecked and TTP ensues. Plasma exchange is effective therapy for idiopathic TTP, probably because it replenishes the deficient ADAMTS13 and removes some of the pathogenic autoantibodies and endothelial-stimulating cytokines. Some patients have a type of thrombotic microangiopathy after transplantation/chemotherapy but do not have severe ADAMTS13 deficiency. The pathogenesis of their disease must differ but remains poorly understood. In Section II, Dr. Toshiyuki Miyata describes recent advances in assay methods that should facilitate routine laboratory testing of ADAMTS13 for patients with thrombotic microangiopathy. ADAMTS13 cleaves a single Tyr-Met bond in domain A2 of the VWF subunit. ADAMTS13 assays based on the cleavage of plasma VWF multimers have been used extensively but require considerable time and expertise to perform. A recombinant substrate containing 73 amino acid residues of VWF domain A2 has been devised that allows short incubation times and rapid product detection by gel electrophoresis or immunoassay. These results should encourage the development of even simpler assays that can be performed in most clinical laboratories. In Section III, Dr. James George provides an update on the long-term prospective study of thrombotic microangiopathy in the Oklahoma TTP-HUS Registry. At presentation, the clinical distinction between idiopathic TTP, various forms of secondary thrombotic microangiopathy, and even Shiga toxin-associated hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) can be problematic because the symptoms and laboratory findings often overlap. Consequently, plasma exchange usually is administered to any patient with thrombotic microangiopathy if there is doubt about the cause. The role of ADAMTS13 testing in choosing therapy remains uncertain, but the results do appear to have prognostic significance. Severe ADAMTS13 deficiency is specific for idiopathic TTP and identifies a subgroup with a high likelihood of response to plasma exchange, and high-titer ADAMTS13 inhibitors correlate strongly with a high risk of relapsing disease. Patients with normal ADAMTS13 activity have a much worse prognosis, although many factors probably contribute to this difference. Longitudinal study of these patients will continue to clarify the relationship of ADAMTS13 deficiency to the clinical course of thrombotic microangiopathy."
CD008201,0,23348655,0,Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in patients with traumatic brain injury.,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) with associated intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) occurs frequently in trauma. Trauma patients are also at high risk of developing venous thromboembolic (VTE) complications. Low Molecular Weight Heparin (LMWH) is used in trauma patients as prophylaxis to reduce the risk of VTE events. It remains unclear, however, if LMWH is safe to use in trauma patients with ICH for fear of hematoma progression. The ""Evidence-based telemedicine: trauma & acute care surgery (EBT-TACS)"" Journal Club performed a critical appraisal of 3 recent and most relevant studies on timing to initiate, safety and use of LMWH in trauma patients with ICH. Specifically, we appraised a i) critical literature review on the topic, ii) a multicenter, retrospective cohort study assessing the safety of LMWH in trauma patients with ICH and iii) a randomized, pilot study assessing the feasibility and event rates of ICH progression, laying the groundwork for future randomized controlled trials (RCT) on the topic. Some results are conflicting, with the highest level of evidence being the pilot RCT demonstrating the safety for early use of LMWH in TBI with ICH. Much of this research, however, was generated by a single center and consequently lacks external validity. Furthermore, clinical recommendations cannot be generated based on pilot studies. Evidence-based guidelines and recommendations could not be made at this time, until the completion of further studies on this challenging topic."

Ninety six patients with suspected DVT/PTE were identified, of whom only two were pregnant. Forty four patients had suspected DVT and confirmatory investigations were performed in 84%. The most common risk factor for DVT was intra-venous drug (IVD) use. Unfractionated heparin was prescribed to all patients except one with acute DVT at an average daily dose of 25,000 iu. In patients receiving heparin, 68% had measurements of the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) ratio and on 38% of occasions the result was subtherapeutic. Complications of heparin therapy were infrequent. Fifty two patients had suspected PTE and 50 underwent ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) scanning. No patient underwent pulmonary angiography. The management of patients with normal, low and high probability V/Q scans was in keeping with the guidelines, but only 8% [corrected] of patients with an intermediate V/Q scan result had further investigations and 33% received heparin. This study revealed suboptimal anticoagulation of patients with acute DVT and scope for improvement in the management of patients with an intermediate V/Q scan result."

CD008201,0,26465279,0,[Usefulness of vena cava filters from clinicians view].,"The indication for vena cava filters (VCF) in treatment of venous thromboembolism is still controversial. The presented overview should support the practical decisions. Beside of large volume of observational date there is only one study - PREPIC 1 - fulfilling requirements of prospective randomized design. During 8 years of follow up, pulmonary embolism (PE) was less frequent in the group with VCF than in the group without VCF, but at the cost of more frequent deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Other, but observational studies, showed similar results. Since last 10 years retrievable VCF are available. PREPIC 2 study was settled to prove, if use of retrievable VCF and their early removal will decrease the frequency of late complications observed in PREPIC 1. The results are available as conference abstract only, but it was presented that recurrence of DVT and PE was less frequent in group without IVC than with inserted VCF. Evaluation of impact of VCF insertion on mortality from RIETE registry showed only a trend which was in favour of VCF. On the other hand, a protective effect of VCF was demonstrated in hemodynamically unstable patients with PE (cardiogenic shock, massive embolism) with or without thrombolytic therapy evaluating cases from US NIS registry. Metaanalysis of studies in patients with polytrauma showed VCF protection mainly in patients where anticoagulation was contraindicated. Data gained from literature are discussed with existing guidelines. 2014 Recommendations of European Cardiologic Society is thatVC filters may be used when there are absolute contraindications to anticoagulation and a high risk of VTE recurrence. The routine use of IVC filters in patients with PE is not recommended."

VTE prophylactic anticoagulation (chemoprophylaxis) is the preferred pharmacological assignment for reducing risk of VTE, but it is underused in current practices involving risk stratification (RS) for VTE prevention. The purpose of this study was to determine whether a protocol that eliminates the RS step (non-RS protocol) is more likely to lead residents to evidence-based VTE assignment than the currently used RS protocol. The non-RS protocol follows a methodology that reduces complexity by assuming that the risk of VTE is present and uses contraindications to determine appropriate VTE assignment."

CD008201,0,19920377,0,[Cancer and thrombosis].,"Venous thromboembolism is a frequent complication in cancer patients.

Vascular intimal carcinomatosis refers to a characteristic tumor proliferation on vascular intima that replaces the normal endothelium. Annexin2-mediated fibrinolysis on carcinoma cells may play a role in inducing hemorrhagic disorder in vascular intimal carcinomatosis. It would be an advantage to have knowledge of predictive parameters for the development of thrombosis and to be able to select cancer patients individually according to their risk profile. Thromboprophylaxis in hospitalized and cancer patients for surgery should include low-molecular weight or unfractionated heparin unless contraindicated. By contrast, in outpatients with cancer, routine anticoagulant prophylaxis is recommended only for patients with myeloma receiving thalidomide-based regimens."

We performed retrospective review of imaging and clinical database of IVC filters for the last 12 years. Thirty-five patients (mean age: 15.5 y) underwent filter placement and/or retrieval. Indications for placement were contraindication to anticoagulation with known deep venous thrombosis (DVT) (18) or high risk of venous thromboembolism (5), recurrent DVT despite anticoagulation (1), and prophylaxis before endovascular thrombolysis (8). All filter placements were technically successful without any complications. Filter retrieval was successful in 15 of 19 attempted (79%) at a mean of 42 days. Two complications occurred during retrieval: IVC stenosis successfully treated with angioplasty and contained IVC perforation. Endothelialization of filter prevented retrieval in 4 patients. Mean follow-up was 29.3 months. No patients had IVC thrombosis, breakthrough pulmonary embolism, filter fracture, or embolism. Two patients had recurrent DVT. Our results indicate that IVC filters can be successfully placed and retrieved in children with minimal procedural complications; follow-up demonstrates acceptable complication rate owing to presence of filters. Prophylactic IVC filter placement may be considered before endovascular thrombolysis for lower extremity DVT. Retrievable filters should be used in children for appropriate indications."

CD008201,0,23831161,0,Management strategies and outcome for prosthetic valve endocarditis.,"The aim of this study was to assess the impact of an operative protocol with a multidisciplinary approach on the outcome of patients with prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE). A formal policy for the care of PVE was introduced at our hospital in 2003 in which patients were referred to and managed by a preexisting team involving a cardiologist, a specialist in infectious diseases, and a cardiac surgeon. All patients underwent transesophageal echocardiography as soon as clinical suspicion of PVE arose. If high-risk conditions such as heart failure, ring abscess, conditions associated with impending malfunctioning of the prosthesis, or vegetations at high risk for systemic embolization were found during the initial multidisciplinary evaluation (performed within 12 hours of admission), patients were operated on within 48 hours. Stable patients were evaluated weekly by the multidisciplinary team, and on-treatment surgery was performed whenever high-risk conditions developed or when there was persistent fever/bacteremia after 1 week of adequate antibiotic therapy. Comparing the period 2003 through 2009 with 1996 through 2002 (when a multidisciplinary policy was not followed), patients with PVE were more numerous (61 vs 38), older (mean age 68.3 vs 63.1, p = 0.01), and had more co-morbidities (mean Charlson index 3.15 vs 2.42, p = 0.03). The most frequent causative organisms were Staphylococci in both periods. In the second period, fewer patients had delayed diagnosis (39% vs 71%, p = 0.03), heart failure (20% vs 45%, p = 0.01), abscess (20% vs 39%, p = 0.04), culture-negative infective endocarditis (11% vs 29%, p = 0.03), and worsened renal function (21% vs 42%, p = 0.04). A significant reduction in in-hospital mortality (53% to 23%, p = 0.04) and 3-year mortality (60% to 28%, p = 0.001) was observed, driven by the increased number of patients successfully treated with medical therapy alone (44% vs 16%, p = 0.04). In conclusion, formalized, collaborative management led to significant improvement in PVE-related mortality."

CD008201,0,19952549,0,Pathways and tools of Stroke PROTECT: a hospital-based recurrent stroke prevention program.,"Patients hospitalized with recent symptomatic cerebral ischemia are at high early risk for subsequent cerebrovascular events. This notwithstanding, an unacceptably high proportion of these patients do not receive prompt and appropriate treatment with evidence-based, guideline-recommended, vascular risk-reduction therapies when exposed to conventional care. Studies of ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack patients reveal that treatment guidelines are often not followed or variably applied, thereby impeding improvements in care quality and clinical outcomes. A likely contributor to this evidence-practice chasm has been the unavailability to care providers of user-friendly, broadly applicable tools/algorithms that could facilitate ready and uniform implementation of proven therapies.The Stroke PROTECT (Preventing Recurrence Of Thromboembolic Events through Coordinated Treatment) program, was designed for inpatient, outpatient, and transitional care settings, and systematically implements evidence-based medication and behavioral secondary prevention measures following the occurrence of an ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack.

CD008201,0,26575600,0,Limb-Threatening Acute Venous Thromboembolism in a Patient Undergoing Postarrest Therapeutic Hypothermia.,"Postcardiac arrest patients are at high risk for developing venous thromboembolism (VTE). Current postarrest guidelines do not provide recommendations for prevention or surveillance of VTE and there is little guidance regarding the optimal prophylaxis or treatment of VTE during therapeutic hypothermia (TH). Many patients develop acute liver dysfunction resulting from severe global hypoperfusion during cardiac arrest, compounding concerns for bleeding with the initiation of TH. However, significant VTE may occur following arrest and can contribute to additional morbidity and mortality. The pharmacokinetics of anticoagulation, the routine treatment for VTE, have not been extensively researched or tested under hypothermic conditions. Standard approaches for prevention and treatment have been utilized, such as unfractionated heparin, but their efficacy remains uncertain. This case illustrates the significant imbalance of coagulation in a postcardiac arrest patient undergoing TH."
CD008201,0,21643821,0,Thromboprophylaxis use in medical and surgical inpatients and the impact of an electronic risk assessment tool as part of a multi-factorial intervention. A report on behalf of the elVis study investigators.,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a major source of morbidity and mortality for both surgical and medical hospitalised patients. Despite the availability of guidelines, thromboprophylaxis continues to be underutilised. This study aims to assess the effectiveness of an electronic VTE risk assessment tool (elVis) on VTE prophylaxis in hospitalised patients. A national, multicentre, prospective clinical audit collected information on VTE prophylaxis and risk factors for VTE in 2,400 hospitalised patients (comprising of equal numbers of medical, surgical and orthopaedic patients). After auditing the standard care use of VTE prophylaxis in 1,200 consecutive patients (audit 1, A1), the elVis system was installed and a second audit (A2) of VTE prophylaxis was performed in a further 1,200 patients. The use of the electronic VTE risk assessment tool was low with 20.5% of patients assessed with elVis. The intervention, elVis plus accompanying education, improved the use VTE prophylaxis to guidelines by 5.0% amongst all patients and by 10.7% amongst high risk patients (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 1.27 and 1.65 respectively). The use of elVis in A2 varied between hospitals and specialties and this resulted in marked heterogeneity. Despite this heterogeneity, patients assessed with elVis had 1.44 times higher AOR of being treated to guidelines compared to those who were not (P < 0.05). The use of elVis accompanied by staff education improved VTE prophylaxis, especially amongst high risk patients. To optimise the effectiveness and support enduring practice change electronic systems, such as elVis, need to be completely integrated within the treatment pathway."

Most of the current literature encourages the use of thromboprophylaxis with injectable low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) in trauma patients. Injectable anticoagulants have inherent problems of producing pain and bruising. They are also difficult to administer, leading to low compliance. Oral anticoagulants are therefore gaining popularity for use as thromboprophylactic agents in hip and knee arthroplasty patients. There are not enough studies in the literature, however, to support their use in ambulatory trauma patients whose ankle fractures are being managed nonoperatively on an outpatient basis."
CD008201,0,23719863,0,Anticoagulation after venous thromboembolism. Deciding on the optimal duration.,"Deciding on the optimal duration of anticoagulation is based on the risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE) and of bleeding during anticoagulation. The duration of anticoagulation should be at least three months since shorter courses double the recurrence rates. At three months anticoagulation can be stopped in patients with a VTE provoked by a transient risk factor, as the recurrence risk is expected to be lower than the bleeding risk during anticoagulation. Patients with unprovoked VTE are at higher risk of recurrence and prolonged anticoagulation is currently recommended. However, attempts are made to stratify these patients according to their recurrence risk and to identify those with a low recurrence risk who would not benefit from extended anticoagulation. Novel approaches to optimize the management of patients with unprovoked VTE are the use of prediction models which link clinical patient characteristics with laboratory testing to discriminate between patients with a low risk (who may discontinue anticoagulation) and those with high risk (in whom long term anticoagulation is justified). Moreover, new antithrombotic concepts including new oral anticoagulants or aspirin both of which potentially confer a lower bleeding risk and are more convenient for the patients have been explored for extended thromboprophylaxis."
CD008201,0,19823781,0,[Perioperative management of patients with coronary stents in non-cardiac surgery].,"In patients with coronary stents scheduled for surgery the question arises whether and how antiplatelet therapy should be continued. Risks of perioperative bleeding and of acute stent thrombosis have to be considered simultaneously. The bleeding risk depends primarily on the kind of surgery and on patient comorbidity. The risk of stent thrombosis is increased in these patients due to the thrombogenic surface of the stents. The main determinants are hereby the time duration after stent implantation, the kind of the stent [uncoated (bare-metal stent, BMS) or coated (drug-eluting stent, DES)], as well as angiographic and clinical patient factors. Therefore, perioperative antiplatelet therapy has to be individually adapted for each patient. Bridging with heparin is ineffective. Bridging with intravenous antiplatelet drugs during the perioperative interruption of oral antiplatelet therapy might be a potential procedure in high-risk patients. Whether bedside monitoring of antiplatelet therapy improves the perioperative management of these patients and reduces adverse outcome is object of current studies."

The pathogenesis of this haemostatic dysfunction is complex and involves the interplay of multiple factors. A detailed understanding of the disease pathophysiology, including mechanisms of haemostasis and laboratory assessment, is imperative in the decision making. Thrombo-embolism is an important and preventable complication of cancer surgery - with appropriate application of thromboprophylaxis. The key outstanding issues surround timing of initiation, regimen and duration of therapy. A major limitation in both our understanding and our pre-emptive management of the haemostatic dysfunction is a lack of sensitive and specific tests of haemostatic potential that can provide predictive power for risk stratification. Routine laboratory tests do not accurately recognise hyper- or hypocoagulable states, or test the clinical effects of procoagulant or anticoagulant interventions. We need further development of cellular-based assays that incorporate all the components of the haemostatic system."

CD008201,0,15568608,0,[New perspectives for anticoagulation in non-rheumatic atrial fibrillation: oral antithrombins].,"Non-rheumatic atrial fibrillation (NRAF) is one among the major public health problems, because it is associated with a high incidence of stroke or systemic thromboembolism. Warfarin significantly reduces cerebral/systemic events mainly in high-risk patients; unfortunately such drug is often as well under-used in eligible patients as under-dosed in treated patients. Traditional therapy with oral anticoagulants has several disadvatages: narrow therapeutic window, and often unpredictable dose-response so that frequent monitoring of the INR is required. It is therefore crucial that patients preferences and education be integrated into the decision-making process. Physicians often underprescribe oral anticoagulants since they perceive the risk of major bleeding as unacceptable because of some well known risk factors (e.g. previous bleedings, severe hypertension), and of qualms about drug interactions or alleged poor compliance. Therefore, the development of easy-to-use antithrombotic agents is still a challenge. New agents such as oral direct thrombin inhibitors are going to hold the promise for the next future. Ximelagatran is an orally active small molecule; being the first new oral anticoagulant used in large clinical trials. This molecule has many advantages in comparison to warfarin, such as the rapid onset/offset of action, the fixed oral dose, the no need of dose adjustment or of anticoagulation monitoring, as well the lack of food/alcohol intake interference as of drug interactions. The SPORTIF III and V trials have shown that ximelagatran is not inferior to warfarin in the prevention of strokes in patients with NRAF (both persistent and paroxysmal), but a side effect--consisting in the significant elevation of liver enzymes (> 3 times the upper limit of normal) in 6% of patients--was found. Further randomized trials are clearly needed, while current data suggest that ximelagatran will be able to represent a future viable therapeutic option for prevention of thromboembolism in patients with NRAF, offering huge advantages with respect to classic oral anticoagulants."

The abnormal red cells break down, causing anemia, and obstruct blood vessels, leading to recurrent episodes of severe pain and multiorgan ischemic damage. SCD affects millions of people throughout the world and is particularly common among people whose ancestors come from sub-Saharan Africa. Sickle cell trait (SCT) is an inherited condition in which both normal hemoglobin and sickle hemoglobin are produced in the RBCs. SCT is not a type of sickle cell disease. People with SCT are generally healthy. In SCD, clinical severity varies, ranging from mild and sometimes asymptomatic states to severe symptoms requiring hospitalization. Symptomatic treatments exist, but there is no cure for SCD. Although there has been extensive clinical and basic science research in SCD, many public health issues, such as blood safety surveillance, compliance with immunizations, follow-up of newborns with positive screening tests, stroke prevention, pregnancy complications, pain prevention, quality of life, and thrombosis, in people with SCT remain unaddressed. Currently, efforts are under way to strengthen SCD-related activities within the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). To date, several activities are being or have been conducted by centers within CDC, including quality assurance of newborn screening tests for SCD, morbidity and mortality studies, genetic studies, and studies focusing on the protective effects of SCT for malaria. This paper discusses the public health implications of SCD, summarizes SCD-related activities within CDC, and points to future directions that the agency can take to begin to address some of these issues."

Personal experience and review of the literature].,"Screening and prophylaxis of the population at risk is the most correct approach to thromboembolic disease. Caval filters play a major role in the prevention of pulmonary embolism, but their use remains widely controversial, even if they are an alternative or additional method to medical therapy and not antithetical to it. July, 1990, to September, 1995, seventy-seven permanent vena cava filters (59 LGM, 13 Filcard and 5 titanium-Greenfield), 22 short-duration temporary vena cava filters (11 LGT, 6 Filcard, 3 Filcard-Emanuelli and 2 Lysofilter) and 10 mid-duration temporary vena cava filters (Tempofilter) were inserted in 109 patients (55 men and 54 women) aged 17-88 years. An inferior vena cavogram was always made before filter insertion to ""map"" the inferior vena cava and its tributaries (renal veins) and to assess caval size. This is a mandatory step to exclude or confirm the presence of endocaval thrombi. Sixty-eight filters were inserted percutaneously via a right internal transjugular approach, 40 via a common transfemoral approach (34 right and 6 left) using the same route as inferior cavography and digital pneumoangiography. One temporary filter was inserted via a right transhumeral approach. Sixty-three patients (57.8%) (44 with a permanent filter, 14 with a temporary filter and 5 with a Tempofilter) had medical diseases, 7 patients (6.4%) (4 with a permanent filter, one with a temporary filter and 2 with a Tempofilter) had surgical conditions; 10 patients (9.2%) (7 with a permanent filter and 3 with a Tempofilter) were surgical-orthopedic patients. Twenty-seven patients (24.8%) (22 with a permanent and 5 with a temporary filter) had cancer. Two patients (1.8%) with a temporary filter were breast feeding. All the patients had deep venous thrombosis of the lower limbs, including the inferior vena cava and the right renal vein in two patients. A proximal floating thrombus and a pulmonary thromboembolism was diagnosed in 41 (37.6%) and 34 (31.2%) cases, respectively. The temporary filters remained in situ 1-4 days and the Tempofilters 3-5 weeks. A pelvic hematoma developed (because of heparin?) after the insertion of a temporary filter and a Tempofilter branch detached and migrated into a lower branch of the left pulmonary artery were reported as immediate and short-term consequences. There were no early or late consequences for the patients. An axillary hemorrhage was observed in the site of previous surgery, during fibrinolysis with a Lysofilter, as well as the incomplete opening of a titanium-Greenfield filter and of two permanent LGM filters, partly trapped within endocaval thrombi. No further consequences to the patients due to permanent filters were observed, nor any case of symptomatic pulmonary thromboembolism, in patients with permanent or temporary filters. With reference to the relative literature and to their own experience, the Authors propose a detailed and rational synthesis of the diagnostic-instrumental approach protocol to thromboembolic disease."

CD008201,0,21781268,0,Management of venous thromboembolism in patients with cancer.,"Patients with cancer are at increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). In these patients VTE is associated with substantial morbidity and complicates the clinical management of cancer. Emerging research indicates a probable detrimental effect of VTE on cancer survival. Although VTE may develop at any stage of cancer disease, the risk of VTE is particularly high in association with three clinical settings including surgery for cancer, use of a central vein catheter (CVC) and chemotherapy. Guidelines recommend post-operative prophylaxis (for at least 7-10 days) for patients undergoing elective cancer surgery. A prolonged prophylaxis (for upto four post-operative weeks) is recommended in cancer patients at high risk for VTE. The role of antithrombotic prophylaxis in the prevention of CVC-related thrombosis remains controversial. The PROTECHT study has recently evaluated the benefit of antithrombotic prophylaxis in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy, showing a statistically significant 50% relative risk reduction in symptomatic thromboembolic events. The international guidelines currently agree in non-recommending routine prophylaxis in ambulatory patients who receive anticancer chemotherapy but suggest an individual risk-based evaluation. To better identify cancer patients at high risk for VTE, simple predictive models have been validated. Further intervention studies are currently on-going to explore the benefit of antithrombotic prophylaxis in individual high-risk groups of patients. The long-term treatment of cancer-related VTE is based on therapeutic doses of LMWH in preference to warfarin. The optimal duration of antithrombotic treatment in cancer patients remains to be fully defined."

However, as we demonstrate in this review, having an oral or written venous thromboembolism prophylaxis policy does not necessarily lead to the majority of general surgical inpatients receiving the appropriate prophylaxis. We discovered, through prospective clinical audit, that for a clinical policy to be effective in delivering the appropriate health care, it must be repeatedly scrutinized and implemented in the correct manner. Only after several rounds of the audit cycle were we able to achieve the deliverance of venous thromboembolism prophylaxis to the majority of general surgical patients on our unit. This has wider implications, not just for the implementation of a venous thromboembolism prophylaxis policy, but also for all clinical management policies, and illustrates the importance of clinical audit in clinical practice."

In Asia, with a high prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection, a potential difference in drug metabolism, and a difference in clinical management of UGIB due to variable socioeconomic environments, it is considered necessary to re-examine the International Consensus of Non-variceal Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding with emphasis on data generated from the region. The working group, which comprised experts from 12 countries from Asia, recommended the use of the Blatchford score for selection of patients who require endoscopic intervention and which would allow early discharge of patients at low risk. Patients' comorbid conditions should be included in risk assessment. A pre-endoscopy proton pump inhibitor (PPI) is recommended as a stop-gap treatment when endoscopy within 24 h is not available. An adherent clot on a peptic ulcer should be treated with endoscopy combined with a PPI if the clot cannot be removed. Routine repeated endoscopy is not recommended. High-dose intravenous and oral PPIs are recommended but low-dose intravenous PPIs should be avoided. COX-2 selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs combined with a PPI are recommended for patients with very high risk of UGIB. Aspirin should be resumed soon after stabilisation and clopidogrel alone is no safer than aspirin plus a PPI. When dual antiplatelet agents are used, prophylactic use of a PPI reduces the risk of adverse gastrointestinal events."

These individuals would not have qualified for statin treatment according to current treatment guidelines. In JUPITER, rosuvastatin was associated with significant reductions in cardiovascular outcomes as well as in overall mortality compared with placebo. In this paper the most important secondary analyses of the JUPITER trial are discussed, by focusing on their novel findings regarding the role of statins in primary prevention. Also, the characteristics of otherwise healthy normocholesterolemic subjects who are anticipated to benefit more from statin treatment in the clinical setting are discussed. Subjects at ""intermediate"" or ""high"" 10-year risk according to the Framingham score, those who exhibit low post-treatment levels of both LDL-C (< 70 mg/dL) and hs-CRP (< 1 mg/L), who are 70 years of age or older, as well as those with moderate chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL/min every 1.73 m(2)) are anticipated to benefit more from statin treatment. Unlikely other statin primary prevention trials, JUPITER added to our knowledge that statins may be effective drugs in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in normocholesterolemic individuals at moderate-to-high risk. Also, statin treatment may reduce the risk of venous thromboembolism and preserve renal function.

CD008201,0,19092648,0,Antiplatelet intervention in acute coronary syndrome.,"Clinical trials have demonstrated the usefulness of antiplatelet agents, percutaneous coronary intervention, and glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa inhibitors in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) based on risk stratification. Studies like RITA 3 and FRISC II have shown that an early invasive strategy in high-risk patients was associated with lower mortality over the long term compared with conservative treatment. High-risk patients with unstable angina/non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction derive particular benefit from GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors and an early invasive strategy. The TIMI risk score for patients with unstable angina/non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction provides an easily implemented tool for therapeutic decision-making. Simultaneous assessment of troponin, C-reactive protein, and brain natriuretic peptide at the time of presentation of ACS provides incremental prognostic information. Recent evidence supports the fact that thrombosis and inflammation are interrelated (platelets are involved in inflammation and, similarly, leukocytes are involved in hemostasis). The platelet, which was once viewed as a bystander in hemostasis, is now recognized as a key mediator of thrombosis as well as inflammation. Antithrombotic drugs block platelet aggregation and activation at various points in the thrombotic cascade and include aspirin, the thienopyridine clopidogrel, and its predecessor ticlopidine, intravenous GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors, which block the final common pathway of platelet activation and aggregation, unfractionated heparin and low-molecular-weight heparin, notably enoxaparin, and direct thrombin inhibitors (eg, bivalirudin). Bivalirudin has proven noninferior to heparin in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. Enoxaparin is emerging as a safer and better alternative to unfractionated heparin in invasively managed patients. Declining renal function is a major cause of excess dosing of antithrombotic agents and frequently increases the risk of bleeding in elderly patients. Class I American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association recommendations for acute (<24 hours) management of patients with high-risk non-ST-elevation ACS include the use of aspirin, beta-blockers, unfractionated heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin, or GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors for patients undergoing catheterization and revascularization and clopidogrel for patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. Medical therapy should be coupled with an early invasive strategy of catheterization and revascularization within 48 hours. Predischarge initiation of secondary prevention therapies for risk factor modification may have substantial advantages for improving the long-term prognosis of patients. A large proportion of patients with ACS undergo interventional treatment, which underscores the importance of upstream initiation of antithrombotic agents. Data from CRUSADE suggests that the majority of patients are likely to benefit from aggressive upstream antithrombotic therapy. Patients with ACS who have diabetes have a higher risk for recurrent events than their nondiabetic counterparts but stand to benefit more from early aggressive therapy. Combining GP IIb/IIIa inhibition with drug-eluting stents offers the potential to optimize outcomes after revascularization in patients with diabetes. Whereas the use of drug-eluting stents has greatly reduced the risk of restenosis, patients with diabetes who have ACS and who undergo stenting remain at high risk for restenosis and are more likely to require revascularization. Increasing adherence to American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines is key to improving outcomes. The optimal management of patients with ACS continues to change as new therapies and strategies of care are developed and proven effective. The clinical challenge remains to increase physician adherence to evidence-based cardiac care for all patients."
CD008201,0,23547993,0,Overview and assessment of risk factors for pulmonary embolism.,"Pulmonary embolism is one of the most common undiagnosed conditions affecting hospitalized patients. There are a plethora of risk factors for venous thromboembolism and pulmonary emboli. These factors are grouped under the broad triad of hypercoagulability, stasis and injury to provide a framework for understanding. Important risk factors include inherited thrombophilia, age, malignancy and estrogens. These risk factors are reviewed in detail and several risk assessment models are reviewed. These risk assessment models help identify those at risk for disease and therefore candidates for thromboprophylaxis. Diagnosis can be difficult and is aided by clinical decision rules that incorporate clinical scores that define the likelihood of pulmonary embolism. These are important considerations, not only for diagnostic purposes, but also to minimize excessive use of imaging, which increases exposure to and risks associated with radiation. A healthy index of suspicion is often the key to diagnosis."

CD008201,0,17264947,0,Appropriateness of diagnostic strategies for evaluating suspected venous thromboembolism.,"It was the objective of this study to determine the proportion of patients who undergo an appropriate diagnostic work-up following a D-dimer test performed to evaluate suspected pulmonary embolism (PE) or deep vein thrombosis (DVT). We performed a retrospective cohort study at a tertiary care hospital. We included patients if they underwent D-dimer testing between 2002 and 2005, if the D-dimer was performed for evaluation of VTE, and if the D-dimer test was successful. We classified: the patients' clinical probability of DVT or PE according to the Wells models, the imaging results, and the appropriateness of the testing algorithm. Of 1,000 randomly selected patients, 863 met our study criteria. Seven hundred nineteen patients (83%) had testing during an emergency department visit, while 144 were tested as inpatients (17%). Physicians performed the D-dimer test to evaluate DVT and PE in 238 (28%) and 625 (72%) patients, respectively. Overall, the testing strategy was appropriate in 69% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 66%-72%) of cases. The testing strategy was more likely to be appropriate for emergency department versus inpatients (75% vs. 39%, p < 0.05) and for DVT versus PE patients (84% vs. 63%, p < 0.05). Of all in-appropriately tested patients, under-utilization of diagnostic imaging was more common than over-utilization (90% vs. 10%, p < 0.05). VTE was confirmed in 37 of 138 'DVT patients' and 35 of 625 'PE patients' (16% [95% CI: 11%-21%] and 6% [95% CI: 4%-8%], respectively).

Prevention of in-hospital VTE, thus, has become a major quality improvement initiative within hospitals. However, addressing VTE prophylaxis rates and appropriateness on transition to other facilities has not been fully characterized to date. The authors of this study retrospectively evaluated VTE prophylaxis on transfer from medical inpatient settings to long-term care facilities.

CD008201,0,26162958,0,Oral anticoagulant therapy in atrial fibrillation patients at high stroke and bleeding risk.,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with a 5-fold greater risk of ischemic stroke or systemic embolism compared with normal sinus rhythm. Cardioembolic AF-related strokes are often more severe, fatal or associated with greater permanent disability and higher recurrence rates than strokes of other aetiologies. These strokes may be effectively prevented with oral anticoagulant (OAC) therapy, using either vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) or non-vitamin K antagonist OACs (NOACs) such as the direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran or direct factor Xa inhibitors rivaroxaban, apixaban or edoxaban. Most AF patients have a positive net clinical benefit from OAC, excluding those with AF and no conventional stroke risk factors. Balancing the risks of stroke and bleeding is necessary for optimal use of OAC in clinical practice, and modifiable bleeding risk factors must be addressed. Concerns remain over 'non-changeable' bleeding risk factors such as older age, significant renal or hepatic impairment, prior stroke(s) or prior bleeding event(s) and active malignancies. Such AF patients are often termed 'special' AF populations, due to their 'special' risk profile that includes increased risks of both thromboembolic and bleeding events, and due to fear of bleeding complications these AF patients are often denied OAC. Evidence shows, however, that the absolute benefits of OAC are the greatest in patients at the highest risk, and NOACs may offer even a greater net clinical benefit compared to warfarin particularly in these high risk patients. In this review article, we summarize available data on stroke prevention in AF patients at increased risk of both stroke and bleeding and discuss the use of NOACs for thromboprophylaxis in these 'special' AF populations."

The retrospective study, which looked at CT use in the ED from 1996 to 2007, suggests that use of the technology grew by 330% during the study period. However, the study suggests that the increase in CT use may be linked with a significant decrease in hospitalization following the use of CT.The rate of hospitalization following a CT went from 26% in 1996 to 12.1% in 2007. However, experts remain concerned that more needs to be done to curb excessive use of CT. In fact, the Joint Commission has issued a Sentinel Event Alert, urging hospitals to implement safeguards with respect to CT scans. Potential targets for improvement include use of CT for flank pain, head injury, neck injury, and pulmonary embolism; experts say evidence-based guidelines suggest alternative diagnostic approaches in these cases. Peer review of testing patterns may help to curb excessive CT use, but experts say ED managers and emergency physicians need to come up with new strategies to address the problem."

The objective of the present study is to describe the incidence of VTE and discuss the correct prophylaxis in RA patients undergoing knee or hip replacement. A systematic review of studies on thromboprophylaxis in RA patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery was performed. Detailed information was extracted to calculate the rate of VTE in RA orthopedic patients and analyze the thromboprophylaxis performed and bleeding complications. Eight articles were eligible for full review. No difference in the overall rate of VTE was observed between RA patients and controls. No significant differences were found in RA patients in terms of bleeding complications. The data on the optimal prophylaxis to be used in RA patients were insufficient to recommend any of the several options available. In the absence of dedicated guidelines for the care of RA patients undergoing orthopedic surgery, management must be individualized to obtain favorable patient outcome, weighing up all the factors that might put the patient at risk for higher bleeding and thrombotic events."

Depending on the type of surgical intervention, venous thrombosis develops in 15-60% of surgical patients without prophylaxis. Although venous thromboembolism is most often considered to be associated with recent surgery or trauma, 50 to 70% of symptomatic thromboembolic events and 70 to 80% of fatal pulmonary embolisms occur in nonsurgical patients. International and national registries show that the majority of at-risk surgical patients actually received the appropriate thromboembolic prophylaxis. However, despite of international and national recommendations, prophylaxis was not provided for a large proportion of at-risk medical patients. The rate of medical patients receiving prophylaxis should be increased, and appropriate thrombosis prophylaxis should be offered to at-risk medical patients. The thrombosis risk assessment is an important tool to identify patients at increased risk for venous thromboembolism, to simplify decision making on prophylaxis administration, and to improve the adherence to guidelines. When the risk is recognized, if there is no contraindication, prophylaxis should be ordered.

CD008201,0,20519242,0,Glycaemic control in acute coronary syndromes: prognostic value and therapeutic options.,"Type 2 diabetes and acute coronary syndromes (ACS) are widely interconnected. Individuals with type 2 diabetes are more likely than non-diabetic subjects to experience silent or manifest episodes of myocardial ischaemia as the first presentation of coronary artery disease. Insulin resistance, inflammation, microvascular disease, and a tendency to thrombosis are common in these patients. Intensive blood glucose control with intravenous insulin infusion has been demonstrated to significantly reduce morbidity and mortality in critically ill hyperglycaemic patients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU). Direct glucose toxicity likely plays a crucial role in explaining the clinical benefits of intensive insulin therapy in such critical patients. However, the difficult implementation of nurse-driven protocols for insulin infusion able to lead to rapid and effective blood glucose control without significant episodes of hypoglycaemia has led to poor implementations of insulin infusion protocols in coronary care units, and cardiologists now to consider alternative drugs for this purpose. New intravenous or oral agents include the incretin glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP1), its analogues, and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, which potentiate the activity of GLP1 and thus enhance glucose-dependent insulin secretion. Improved glycaemic control with protective effects on myocardial and vascular tissues, with lesser side effects and a better therapeutic compliance, may represent an important therapeutic potential for this class of drugs in acutely ill patients in general and patients with ACS in particular. Such drugs should be known by practicing cardiologists for their possible use in ICUs in the years to come."

It is well established that many of these deaths could be prevented through the use of appropriate thromboprophylaxis. This issue is of particular relevance in oncology practice, where the risks of VTE and bleeding are both significantly higher than those observed in general medical patients. Cancer patients with in-dwelling central venous catheters (CVCs) are at particularly high risk of developing thrombotic complications. However, the literature has produced conflicting conclusions regarding the efficacy of using routine primary thromboprophylaxis in these patients. Indeed such is the level of confusion around this topic, that the most recent version of the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) guidelines published in 2004 actually reversed their previous recommendation (published in 2001). Nevertheless, minidose warfarin continues to be routinely used in many oncology centres in the UK. In this article, we have performed a systematic review of the published literature regarding the efficacy and the risks, associated with using thromboprophylaxis (either minidose warfarin or low-dose LMWH) in cancer patients with CVC. On the basis of this evidence, we conclude that there is no proven role for using such thromboprophylaxis.

However, determining appropriate dosing by intravenous infusion is highly variable in practice. Multiple standardized protocols have been adopted, including a weight-based nomogram entailing a loading dose of 80 U/kg, followed by an initial infusion rate of 18 U/kg/h. In some instances, 18 U/kg/h has resulted in supratherapeutic activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). This study aimed to determine if an initial heparin infusion rate of 14 U/kg/h per a high-dose protocol achieved therapeutic anticoagulation more rapidly than 18 U/kg/h. A retrospective chart review performed at a Veterans Health Administration facility located in the southwestern U.S. identified 129 patients hospitalized from January 2009 to August 2011 receiving a high-dose protocol for heparin with an initial infusion rate of 14 or 18 U/kg/h. The proportion of patients achieving subtherapeutic, at goal, or supratherapeutic aPTT on two subsequent mornings was determined. Time to reach therapeutic aPTT was assessed with a multivariable generalized linear model. Patients provided 18 U/kg/h for heparin anticoagulation therapy experienced elevated aPTT values initially. Also, these patients generally took 1.41 times longer to reach therapeutic aPTT than patients receiving 14 U/kg/h [estimate = 0.34, 95% CI 0.11, 0.57; p < 0.01]. Larger body mass index led to increased time to reach therapeutic anticoagulation. This study's results suggest that patients may benefit from receiving an initial heparin infusion rate of 14 U/kg/h over 18 U/kg/h. Decreasing the time to therapeutic aPTT may further help reduce workload from monitoring and dose titrations."

CD008201,0,26637702,0,Mechanical circulatory support: balancing bleeding and clotting in high-risk patients.,"Mechanical circulatory support (MCS) provides a bridge to heart transplant in children and adults with life-threatening heart failure and sustains patients ineligible for transplant. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) provides temporary support for patients in cardiac or pulmonary failure through external gas exchange and continuous flow of blood. Because the median time to heart transplant exceeds event-free time on ECMO, pulsatile left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) are used to support infants and children. Continuous flow LVADs are preferred in adolescents and adults due to increased pump durability and improved overall survival. The shear stress created by the mechanical pumps cause changes in the hematologic system; acquired von Willebrand syndrome occurs in almost all patients treated with MCS. Despite the improvements in survival, major bleeding occurs in one-third of patients with a LVAD and ischemic stroke and LVAD thrombosis can affect 12% of adults and 29% of children. An antithrombotic strategy to mitigate LVAD bleeding and thrombotic complications has been tested in a randomized trial in children, but intensity of antithrombotic therapy in adults varies widely. Consensus guidelines for antithrombotic therapy during ECMO were created due to significant differences in management across centers. Because of the high risk for both bleeding and thrombotic complications, experts in hemostasis can significantly impact care of patients requiring mechanical circulatory support and are a necessary part of the management team."
CD008201,0,17336882,0,Anticoagulation in atrial fibrillation: a contemporary viewpoint.,"Anticoagulation therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation is important. This review consists of three parts: chronic anticoagulation, anticoagulation for cardioversion, and a brief comment on anticoagulation around the time of left atrial radiofrequency ablation. The risk stratification scheme of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/European Society of Cardiology (ACC/AHA/ESC) guidelines for chronic anticoagulation is briefly reviewed. Although there are several other similar schemes, they are not identical. The key point is the balance between benefit and risk. Some emerging controversies are outlined. Two specific questions explored are: is well-controlled hypertension a risk factor, and does paroxysmal atrial fibrillation confer the same risk as continuous atrial fibrillation? Differences in the risk of bleeding while taking a vitamin K antagonist noted in recent compared with older data are discussed. Risk of bleeding in the elderly and combined antithrombotic therapy with a vitamin K antagonist and an antiplatelet agent in high-risk patients are briefly discussed. Recent failures of studies attempting to find a suitable alternative to vitamin K antagonists are outlined. The treatment guidelines for anticoagulation for cardioversion are briefly reviewed. The risk of thromboembolism according to international normalized ratio and use of low-molecular-weight heparin as an alternative to warfarin are discussed. Anticoagulation before and after left atrial radiofrequency ablation is empirical, and long-term anticoagulation seems advisable for high risk patients at the present time. The two most pressing needs for further investigation are (1) clarification, simplification, and consolidated of risk stratification schemes and treatment recommendations and (2) discovery of alternatives to warfarin."

CD008201,0,26163075,0,Oral contraception for women of middle age.,"Women at middle age have decreased fertility and their pregnancies are higher risk. Combined oral contraceptives (COC) are effective but confer increased risk of age-related diseases, especially cardiovascular diseases. These risks are lower, however, with progestogen-only pills (POP). Therefore, other than the levonorgestrel intrauterine device (LNG-IUD), POP are usually the first choice, even though they do often lead to bleeding problems, which are already frequent in the perimenopause. However, the main risk of COC, venous thromboembolism, seems not to be relevant in (non-hospitalized) Chinese women and perhaps also other Asian women. COC may therefore be in fact a better choice than POP for these groups. In contrast to POP and IUDs, they have a variety of benefits especially important for middle-aged women, including a large decrease of the risk of ovarian, endometrial and colorectal cancer, an improvement in bleeding irregularities, a reduction of climacteric symptoms and some protection against bone loss. Further research is needed into individualized and safe contraception that takes into account ethnicity, as well as other factors."
CD008201,0,14533036,0,[Outpatient primary stent-angioplasty in symptomatic internal carotid artery stenoses].,"In 81 patients, average age 69.3 (57-79) years with symptomatic ICA stenosis stent implantation was performed under outpatient conditions. An interdisciplinary consensus ascertained that the patients were suitable for outpatient therapy. In accordance with the NASCET criteria all patients belonged to the high-risk group. Within 120 days before the intervention, the following clinical events had occurred: 32 minor strokes, 43 TIA, 20 amaurosis fugax. 61/81 patients revealed a bulbar, 20/81 a postbulbar ICA stenosis, the average degree of stenosis was 88.6 % (75-97). Stent application, using 3 different stent models, and subsequent PTA were always performed under protection. The transfemoral route was always treated with an endovascular closure system. All patients were given follow-up examinations by means of colour duplex sonography (CDS) of the neck vessels on days 1, 30, 180 and 360, and contrast-medium intensified MRT on day 5 post-intervention. The technical success rate with regard to stenting and PTA was 100 %. One case of hypotonic dysregulation occurred during the intervention. Atheromatous particles and plaque fragments were found in the protection system in 3/81 (3.7%) of the patients. A plaque embolism was excluded clinically and in the contrast-medium intensified MRT 5 days after the intervention in 79/81 (97.5%) of the patients, while two patients were found to sustain an asymptomatic cortical barrier impairment. After 180 days, no restenosis or stent dislocation were found in the CDS, all ECAs were perfused. After 360 days, one asymptomatic occlusion and four restenoses > 70% were found (5/81 = 6.2% restenosis rate after 1 year), which were successfully treated by angioplasty. The method presented bears a low complication rate and shows a high success rate. If patient recruitment is adequate, this intervention can safely be performed on an outpatient basis."
CD008201,0,17653546,0,"Foot pumps without graduated compression stockings for prevention of deep-vein thrombosis in total joint replacement: efficacy, safety and patient compliance. A comparative, prospective clinical trial.","Mechanical prophylaxis with foot pumps provides an interesting alternative to chemical agents in the prevention of thromboembolic disease following major orthopaedic surgical procedures. Recent studies have suggested that the simultaneous use of graduated compression stockings (GCS) may hinder the pneumatic compression effect of foot pumps. The hypothesis of this prospective study was that the use of foot pumps without GCS does not affect the efficacy of deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis and improves patient compliance. A total of 846 consecutive patients admitted at a single institution undergoing total hip (THR) or knee replacement (TKR) were included in the study. The A-V Impulse System foot-pump unit (Orthofix Vascular Novamedix, Andover, UK) was used in all patients. Of these 846 patients, 46 discontinued the use of foot pumps, leaving 400 patients who received foot pumps in combination with GCS and 400 patients with foot pumps alone. Eleven patients of the stocking group (2.7%) and nine patients of the no-stocking group (2.3%) developed postoperative symptomatic DVT (p=0.07). DVT was more frequent in TKR (10/364; 2.7%) than in THR (10/436; 2.3%). Non-fatal pulmonary embolism occurred in four of the 20 patients with symptomatic DVT, two patients each of the stocking and no-stocking groups. The foot-pump discontinuation rate of patients treated with stockings was 7% versus 4% of the patients treated without stockings (p<0.05). In conclusion, management of patients with foot pumps without GCS does not reduce the efficacy of DVT prophylaxis after THR and TKR and improves patient compliance."

The aim of the present study was to analyze different surgical techniques of kidney transplantation in rats, with emphasis on minimizing surgical complications and establishing guidelines for their prevention and management. Complications were categorized into general (e.g., core body temperature drop, ischemic time) and surgically related vascular and urinary tract complications. In conclusion, a significant reduction of the complication rate in renal transplantation in rats can be achieved by placing the animal on a heating pad at an appropriate temperature. To reduce the risk of vascular thrombosis, ice-cold saline with heparin and careful flushing of the donor kidneys are recommended. Vascular complications can be avoided by performing ""end-to-end"" anastomosis techniques. The use of stents and cannulas in the urinary tract is associated with a high risk of urinary tract obstruction, and therefore is not recommended."

CD008201,0,22968380,0,Understanding the new emerging oral anticoagulants for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis.,"Patients who have major orthopaedic surgery are at high risk for developing venous thromboembolism (VTE). Assessment of risk and treatment to prevent VTE are considered standard of care due to its significant morbidity, potential mortality, and clinical burden and cost. Guidelines are available aiding orthopaedic surgeons to choose the best methods of VTE prophylaxis. Optimal VTE prevention has not been achieved. Recent advances in the understanding of the coagulation cascade have evolved because of a novel understanding of the molecular influences on the coagulation pathway. Subsequently, new anticoagulants have been developed that target specific factors within the coagulation cascade that are contrasted to the currently used agents that have a broad effect on the coagulation pathway. Multiple clinical trials have tested the new anticoagulants within the orthopaedic total knee and total hip arthroplasty arena. In addition, research to find new ways to prevent VTE was driven by limitations of the currently available agents. The new oral anticoagulants extensively trialed in orthopaedics are dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban. Clinical trials indicate that the new oral agents have the potential to impact VTE prophylaxis in regard to efficacy, predictability and consistency, clinical monitoring, adherence as to use and duration, and convenience. Concerns persist regarding issues of bleeding complications, liver enzyme elevation, patients with renal disease, and drug-to-drug interactions. The new oral agents do not have an antidote to reverse bleeding effect and have no reliable assay to measure effect. Nurses need to be aware of these new VTE prophylactic choices and their implications in order to provide the best outcomes for their patients."
CD008201,0,9005246,0,[Forensic medical implications of anticoagulant treatments].,"Several types of accidents related to anticoagulant treatment can lead to legal procedures, including: thromboembolic post-operative complications associated with lack of anticoagulant prophylaxis and leading to sequelae or death; severe hemorrhagic or thromboembolic accidents attributed to poor management of anticoagulant therapy; complications with sequelae or death resulting from heparin-induced thrombopenia, either with standard or low-molecular weight heparin and associated with poor surveillance of platelet counts. The exceptional nature of accidents leading to legal procedures (24 legal cases in Pr Natali's experience) and the small number of other cases reported should not lead to underestimating the importance of precise rules for anticoagulation treatments. In 7 cases, there was no anticoagulant prophylaxis after surgery. Recent consensus conferences have proposed a definition of small, moderate or high risk of thrombosis as a function of patient status and surgical procedure. Expert working groups have defined the operated patients for which pharmacological anti-coagulation is necessary. In 19 other cases, management of the treatment protocol was insufficient leading to severe hemorrhage with sequelae, severe thromboembolism, or late diagnosis of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia because of insufficient surveillance of platelet counts. Recent advances in laboratory tests for the diagnosis of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia should be emphasized. To these case reports can be added other observations in a small number of complaints resulting from unadvisable treatment combinations, poor surveillance of a thromboembolic event or dangerous invasive exploration."

CD008201,0,19485902,0,New anticoagulants for prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism.,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a major public health issue, with a high incidence in hospitalised patients. Furthermore, many VTE events are preventable with appropriate thromboprophylaxis. Medical thromboprophylaxis usually comprises heparins, while warfarin has been the mainstay of long term anticoagulation for many years. Both drugs are limited by their narrow therapeutic index and the need for regular monitoring. The introduction of low molecular weight heparins and fondaparinux has overcome some of these shortfalls but their use remains restricted by requisite parenteral administration. There is a clear need for new anticoagulants with predictable pharmacokinetics and anticoagulant effect. To this end, 2 new agents; dabigatran and rivaroxaban, have recently been licensed for use in orthopaedic thromboprophylaxis. This review discusses the limitations of traditional anticoagulants, and summarises the development and clinical studies pertaining to the use of 3 new targeted anticoagulants: idraparinux, rivaroxaban and dabigatran in VTE, in addition to the limitations of these novel agents."

CD008201,0,20362363,0,[The pharmacogenetics of vitamin K antagonists: still a matter for discussion].,"The use of vitamin K antagonists (VKA) is challenging because of their narrow therapeutic index and a high bleeding risk. These drugs are widely prescribed for the prophylaxis and treatment of many thrombo-embolic disorders. The management of patients with VKA represents a public health problem according to the high number of deaths and hospitalizations in relation to hemorrhagic complications. Monitoring is required because of the large inter-individual variability. The identification of factors, in particular genetic factors, influencing the response to VKA will improve the safety of VKA treatment. In addition to demographic, clinical, biological factors and drug interactions, genetic factors can explain a large part of the inter-individual variability. The main enzyme responsible for VKA metabolism is the hepatic cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9). Vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit I (VKORC1) is a key enzyme in the vitamin K cycle and is the pharmacological target of VKA. Genetic variations affecting both CYP2C9 and VKORC1 are associated with a significant decrease in the VKA dose requirement and an increased risk of bleeding. CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genotyping may identify a subgroup of patients with an early response at the induction of VKA therapy, potentially leading to a high bleeding risk. On the opposite, rare mutations in VKORC1 can explain high dose requirement and pharmacodynamic resistance. Genotyping CYP2C9 and VKORC1 variants before treatment initiation could allow the development of dosing protocols and the identification of patients at high risk of bleeding complications."

Prospective analysis of screening contrast venography was done from 1984 to 2003 in 1972 patients having elective total hip arthroplasty. Patients with deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism received warfarin therapy; those with negative venograms received no further anticoagulation. From 1984 to 1992, patients not completing venography were discharged without warfarin; since 1993, patients without venography received warfarin for 6 weeks. Readmission for deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, or bleeding was tracked for 6 months. Venograms were completed in 1032 patients; 175 (16.9%) had deep venous thrombosis. Deep venous thrombosis was reduced by a clinical pathway that included continuous epidural anesthesia (14.2% versus 22.5%). The overall readmission rate for venous thromboembolic disease was 1.62%, including 14 pulmonary emboli (three fatal) and 18 femoral deep venous thrombosis. Readmission occurred in 0.27% (1 of 360) patients on continued warfarin, compared with 2.2% (19 of 880) with negative venograms discharged without further anticoagulation. Three patients (0.15%) suffered fatal pulmonary emboli; all had negative venograms and received no outpatient prophylaxis. Extended outpatient warfarin therapy provided effective protection against venous thromboembolic disease readmission. Surveillance venography was a poor predictor of need for continued prophylaxis; all patients should have extended anticoagulation after total hip arthroplasty."

We designed and implemented a treatment protocol based on an analysis of the main causes of death in disseminated CCE with renal involvement. From 1985 to 1996, we applied this protocol in 67 consecutive atherosclerotic patients admitted to our renal intensive care unit for acute renal failure (serum creatinine level, 6 +/- 2.5 mg/dL) accompanied by signs and symptoms of CCE. The other principal clinical features in these patients were cardiac failure with pulmonary edema (61%), gastrointestinal ischemia (33%), cutaneous ischemia (90%), and retinal cholesterol embolism (22%). Disseminated CCE followed one or several precipitating factors, including angiographic procedure(s) (85%), anticoagulant treatment (76%), and cardiovascular surgery (33%). Our treatment schedule systematically addressed the identified causes of death in these patients. (1) To avoid CCE recurrence, any form of anticoagulant treatment was withdrawn, and aortic catheterization and surgery were proscribed. (2) To treat or prevent cardiac failure, a high-dose vasodilator regimen was instituted, including angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. In case of cardiac failure refractory to vasodilators, loop diuretics were added and, if necessary, overhydration was corrected by ultrafiltration/hemodialysis (11 patients). (3) To avoid cachexia, severe metabolic disorders were treated by hemodialysis (41 patients), and special attention was given to providing enteral or parenteral nutritional support. Patients with declining general status and laboratory evidence of inflammation, as well as those with new episodes of CCE, were treated with corticosteroids. Statistical analysis found a significant correlation between the requirement for hemodialysis and previous anticoagulation, degree of renal insufficiency, and severity of cardiac failure. Conversely, there was no correlation between requirement for hemodialysis and ACE inhibitor treatment or presence of atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis/thrombosis. The inhospital mortality rate was 16%. There were no clinical or laboratory elements found on admission that were predictive of inhospital mortality. Among survivors, 32% had to remain on maintenance hemodialysis therapy for irreversible chronic renal failure. Including initial hospitalization, the 1-year survival rate was 87%, which compares favorably with reports in the literature indicating a first-year mortality rate of 64% to 81%. Overall follow-up was 19 +/- 20 months, ranging from 1 to 74 months. The 4-year survival rate was 52%. We conclude that an intensive-care, specific-treatment schedule reduces mortality in multivisceral cholesterol embolism."

These and other factors, including a growing elderly population, mean that VTE presents a continuing burden to patients and physicians. Anticoagulant therapy is a fundamental approach for VTE management. Non-VKA oral anticoagulants, including the factor Xa inhibitors apixaban, edoxaban and rivaroxaban, and the thrombin inhibitor dabigatran, have been studied in phase III trials across a spectrum of thromboembolic disorders. These agents offer simplified care, with similar or improved efficacy and safety outcomes compared with heparins and vitamin K antagonists. There are several factors a physician must consider when prescribing an anticoagulant. An important consideration with all anticoagulant use is bleeding risk, especially in high-risk groups such as the elderly or those with renal impairment or cancer. In orthopaedic patients, other risks include a need for surgical revision or blood transfusion, or wound complications. Therefore, the clinical benefits of an anticoagulant should ideally be balanced with any risks associated with the therapy. Quantitative benefit-risk assessments are lacking, and owing to differences in trial design the non-VKA oral anticoagulants cannot be compared directly. Based on trial and ""real-life"" data, this review will summarise the clinical data for the non-VKA oral anticoagulants in the prevention and treatment of VTE, focusing on the balance between the benefits and risks of anticoagulation with these drugs, and their potential impact on VTE management."

We report the features, management and outcome of paediatric (ages 0-18years) and adult (18-50years) patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) with asparaginase-related venous thromboembolic events (VTE) treated at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute on clinical trials for newly diagnosed ALL between 1991-2008. Of 548 patients, 43 (8%) had VTE, including 27/501 (5%) paediatric and 16/47 (34%) adult patients. Sinus venous thrombosis occurred in 1·6% of patients. Age was the only significant predictor of VTE, with those aged >30years at very high risk (VTE rate 42%). 74% of patients received low molecular weight heparin after VTE. Complications of anticoagulation included epistaxis (9%), bruising (2%) and, in two adult patients, major bleeding. Thirty patients (70%) ultimately received at least 85% of the intended doses of asparaginase. 33% of patients experienced recurrent VTE (paediatric 17% vs. adults 47%, P=0·07). The 48-month event-free survival for patients with VTE was 85±6% compared with 88±2% for those without VTE (P=0·36). This study confirms that, after VTE, asparaginase can be restarted with closely monitored anticoagulation after imaging demonstrates clot stabilization or improvement. With this management strategy, a history of VTE does not appear to adversely impact prognosis."

To enhance clinician execution of appropriate steps to reduce the risk of inpatient VTE, a performance improvement (PI) continuing medical education (CME) initiative consisting of 3 independent tracks for hospitalized patients-patients who are medically ill, patients receiving oncology treatment, and patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery-was designed and implemented. After a baseline chart review of select evidenced-based performance measures for VTE risk stratification and prevention, participants identified ≥ 1 area of personal improvement. Participants then engaged in a period of self-improvement and reassessed their performance with a second chart review. After participating in the PI CME activity, clinician participants in the medically ill track increased their documentation of VTE risk assessments upon patient admission from baseline (56% vs 93%, n = 250; P < 0.001) and their prescription of low-molecular-weight heparin, low-dose unfractionated heparin, or fondaparinux (72% vs 88%, n = 250; P < 0.001).

A 70-year-old female presented 10 days after a stroke, three years after having undergone mitral bioprosthetic valve implantation. Both, transthoracic echocardiography and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) revealed a large mobile, non-obstructive mass attached to the atrial side of the sewing ring of the bioprosthesis. The administration of low-molecular-weight heparin and aspirin resulted only in a reduction of thrombus size, whereas a slow streptokinase infusion resulted in complete disappearance of the thrombus after 16 h. A review of the literature shows that late non-obstructive bioprosthetic valve thrombosis, as diagnosed with TEE, is a rare condition that can be successfully treated either by anticoagulant or thrombolytic therapy. Late bioprosthetic valve thrombosis should be considered as a cause of prosthetic valve dysfunction, and long-term preventive anticoagulant treatment of high-risk patients is warranted. Slow thrombolytic therapy is safe and successful, even for large non-obstructive bioprosthetic thrombi, if there are no contraindications."

In Spain, there are no data on the incidence and distribution of VTD. To determine the incidence and distribution of this disease, we analyzed the hospital discharges codified by the Spanish national health system. The results of the analysis showed that VTD represented 0.82% (0.69%-0.92%) of all hospital discharges in Spain between 1999 and 2005. The rate of diagnoses for all hospital discharges in 2005 was 103/100,000 inhabitants, with an estimated number of total diagnoses in Spain (hospitalized or not) of 154/100,000. Fifty-three percent were pulmonary embolisms (PE), which showed a tendency to increase, and 47% were deep venous thrombosis (DVT), which showed a tendency to decrease. The mean age was 65 years in men (51% of cases) and 68 years in women, with the incidence increasing exponentially with age. The mean age in patients with PE was 70 years vs 64 years in DVT. Mortality associated with PE was 11.6% vs 2.3% with DVT. DVT occurred during admission in 4% (3-4.7) of persons hospitalized for any cause, 74% of patients being admitted for medical problems. These data reveal that DVT is a serious health problem in Spain, with high morbidity and mortality. The incidence of this disease seems to be increasing and is particularly associated with medical problems, despite improved diagnosis and the accumulated evidence on thromboprophylaxis. Therefore, greater efforts should be made both to improve identification of at-risk patients and the application of prevention protocols."

However, there are still open questions related to its indication, to type and extent of prophylaxis and how to improve its efficacy and safety. In order to facilitate decision making to provide or to withhold prophylaxis, clinical risk assessment considering exposing and predisposing risk factors has proved to be of value. The exposing risk is characterised by type and extent of surgery or trauma, respectively, whereas the predisposing risk is determined by patient related risk factors. This has also been acknowledged in national and international guidelines. The choice of prophylactic modalities should be based on the combination of exposing and predisposing risk factors. Physical and pharmacological methods are available for primary prevention of VTE. The cornerstones of pharmacological prophylaxis have been subcutaneous injections of low molecular weight heparins or fondaparinux. Recently, also oral direct thrombin- and factor Xa-inhibitors have become available for patients undergoing hip or knee replacement surgery who always are at high risk for VTE complications."

Recent advances in PE diagnosis are reviewed. The use of risk stratification in PE diagnosis is strongly recommended and evidence on how it can best be performed summarized. The Ginsberg/Wells stratification rule is recommended currently as the best validated rule. Computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA) was found to have quite poor sensitivity and to be poorly validated. It is recommended as adequate as a positive test in moderate/high risk groups and an exclusionary test in low risk groups or where an adequate alternative diagnosis is found. For D-Dimer tests the only test with adequate sensitivity and validation in management studies is the VIDASCopyright D-Dimer. This is in low/intermediate risk groups in the ED population. The Simpli-RedCopyright test is also reviewed but is too insensitive for most populations. Echocardiography: this is good in compromised patients as it is a bedside test which when negative virtually excludes PE. If positive in the right setting it has a high positive predictive value. A negative echocardiogram predicts a benign clinical course for PE. The rest of the paper details the authors approach to integrating these new techniques with established algorithms and where progress is likely to occur in the next few years. These include improvements in CTPA (plus the addition of CT venography), new point of care D-Dimer tests, better risk stratification rules and integration of new strategies with artificial neural networks or computerized guidelines."

However, in these special high-risk situations anticoagulants, particularly low molecular weight heparin, allow for a decrease in the number of venous thromboses, pulmonary embolisms and deaths caused by pulmonary embolism. Only the wide-spread and adequate use of antithrombotics can safeguard against venous thromboembolism in these various risk situations. Guidelines constitute an integrative part of quality management and ensure the application of evidence-based medicine. The present consensus on thrombosis prophylaxis in Austria has been elaborated by 23 experts in the fields of hemostasis research, angiology, surgery, orthopedics, internal medicine, anaesthesiology and pharmacology. The recommendations for the management of thrombosis prophylaxis in the fields of general surgery, orthopaedic and trauma surgery and internal medicine have been elaborated drawing on the Guidelines issued by the American College of Chest Physicians.

Future studies are needed to assess the antithrombotic properties of commonly used NSAIDs, the hypothetical thrombogenicity of COX-2-specific inhibitors in high-risk patients, the need for concomitant aspirin with selective versus nonselective COX inhibitors, and the antiplatelet and gastric toxicity of the aspirin/COX-2-specific inhibitor combination in comparison with the aspirin/conventional NSAID combination."
CD008201,0,26383727,0,Bridging Anticoagulation: Primum Non Nocere.,"Chronic oral anticoagulation frequently requires interruption for various reasons and durations. Whether or not to bridge with heparin or other anticoagulants is a common clinical dilemma. The evidence to inform decision making is limited, making current guidelines equivocal and imprecise. Moreover, indications for anticoagulation interruption may be unclear. New observational studies and a recent large randomized trial have noted significant perioperative or periprocedural bleeding rates without reduction in thromboembolism when bridging is employed. Such bleeding may also increase morbidity and mortality. In light of these findings, physician preferences for routine bridging anticoagulation during chronic anticoagulation interruptions may be too aggressive. More randomized trials, such as PERIOP2 (A Double Blind Randomized Control Trial of Post-Operative Low Molecular Weight Heparin Bridging Therapy Versus Placebo Bridging Therapy for Patients Who Are at High Risk for Arterial Thromboembolism), will help guide periprocedural management of anticoagulation for indications such as venous thromboembolism and mechanical heart valves.

The clinical diagnosis of the condition is difficult and noninvasive procedures are poorly reliable, which makes the diagnosis and treatment of deep venous thrombosis appropriate in the patient with clinically suspected pulmonary embolism. Color-Doppler US is now replacing phlebography in the diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis. Proximal deep venous thrombosis is always at high risk for embolism (50%). Isolated calf thrombi may spread into proximal veins and thus cause severe embolism. Therefore, the early detection of thrombus site and extent and a timely treatment before embolism are of the utmost importance. Color-Doppler US is a noninvasive technique which can show deep venous thrombosis with 95% sensitivity in the proximal and 55% sensitivity in the distal districts in asymptomatic patients. This examination must be used not only to confirm a diagnostic suspicion of deep venous thrombosis, but also to screen high-risk patient and to monitor distal thrombosis. In the secondary prophylaxis of pulmonary embolism, the radiologist must perform a mechanical interruption of inferior vena cava by positioning a caval filter. Caval filters can be temporary or definitive; standard indications for caval filter positioning are a contraindication to anticoagulant therapy and the onset of pulmonary embolism in spite of anticoagulant drugs. A further indication is the presence of floating thrombi in the femoroiliac-caval trunk. Multidisciplinary groups including the hematologist, the radiologist and the clinician should plan the diagnostic and therapeutic approach and participate in the decision-making process. In our department, from January, 1992, to June, 1995, sixty-five caval filters were positioned in 62 patients selected out of 260 candidates. Three complications only were observed; one patient had recurrent pulmonary embolism and three patient had caval thrombosis spreading beyond the filter. In 198 patients in whom no caval filter was implanted, pulmonary embolism did not recur. At present, the role of the radiologist is markedly changing, especially in the management of this condition. On the one hand, radiologists must diagnose thromboembolism as a whole and not only its pulmonary evidence; on the other hand, they play a major operational and interventional role in the treatment of thromboembolism patients."

Recently, target specific oral anticoagulants (TSOA) including the direct thrombin inhibitor, dabigatran, and the factor Xa inhibitors rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban have been approved for THA thrombopropylaxis in various countries. The TSOAs provide a rapid acting, oral alternative to parenteral agents including low-molecular weight heparins (LMWH) and fondaparinux; and compared to warfarin, they do not require routine laboratory monitoring and possess much fewer drug-drug interactions. Based on phase III clinical studies, TSOAs have established themselves as an effective and safe option for thromboprophylaxis after THA compared to LMWH, particularly enoxaparin, but require additional evaluation in specific populations such as the renally impaired or elderly. The ability to monitor and reverse these TSOAs in the case of bleeding complications or suspected sub- or supra-therapeutic anticoagulation is of importance, but remains investigational. This review will focus on the drug-specific characteristics, efficacy, safety, and economic impact of the TSOAs for thromboprophylaxis following THA, as well as the aspects of therapeutic monitoring and anticoagulation reversal in the event of bleeding complications or a need for urgent reversal."

From February 2010 to November 2012, TBI patients were entered into a dedicated database tracking injury types and sizes, risk category at presentation, and progression on subsequent computed tomgraphies (CTs). The cohort (n=414) was classified as low risk (n=200), moderate risk (n=75), or high risk (n=139) after first CT. After repeat CT scan, radiographic progression was noted in 27% of low-risk, 53% of moderate-risk, and 58% of high-risk subjects. Omnibus analysis of variance test for differences in progression rates was highly significant (p<0.0001). Tukey's post-hoc test showed the low-risk progression rate to be significantly different than both the moderate- and high-risk arms; no difference was noted between the moderate- and high-risk arms themselves. These criteria are a valid tool for classifying TBI patients into two categories of risk for spontaneous progression. This supports tailored chemoprophylaxis regimens for each arm."
CD008201,0,17005045,0,Outcomes of thromboprophylaxis with enoxaparin vs. unfractionated heparin in medical inpatients.,Clinical trials have shown low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) to be at least as safe and efficacious as unfractionated heparin (UFH) for preventing venous thromboembolism (VTE) in acutely-ill medical inpatients.
CD008201,0,25845093,0,"[The Health Department of Sicily ""Regional recommendations for hospital discharge and communication with patients after admission due to a cardiologic event"" decree].","Mortality and rehospitalizations still remain high after discharge for an acute cardiologic event. In this context, hospital discharge represents a potential pitfall for heart disease patients. In the setting of care transitions, the discharge letter is the main instrument of communication between hospital and primary care. Communication, besides, is an integral part of high-quality, patient-centered interventions aimed at improving the discharge process. Inadequate information at discharge significantly affects the quality of treatment compliance and the adoption of lifestyle modifications for an effective secondary prevention. The Health Department of Sicily, in 2013, established a task force with the aim to elaborate ""Regional recommendations for hospital discharge and communication with patients after admission due to a cardiologic event"", inviting to participate GICR-IACPR and many other scientific societies of cardiology and primary care, as discharge letter and communication are fundamental junctions of care transitions in cardiology. These recommendations have been published as a specific decree and contain: a structured model of discharge letter, which includes all of the parameters characterizing patients at high clinical risk, high thrombotic risk and low risk according to the Consensus document ANMCO/GICR-IACPR/GISE; is thus possible to identify these patients, choosing consequently the most appropriate follow-up pathways. A particular attention has been given to the ""Medication Reconciliation"" and to the identification of therapeutic targets; an educational Kit, with different forms on cardiac diseases, risk factors, drugs and lifestyle; a check-list about information given to the patient and caregivers. The ""Recommendations"" represent, in conclusion, the practical realization of the fruitful cooperation between scientific societies and political-administrative institutions that has been realized in Sicily in the last years."
CD008201,0,20101546,0,Venous thromboembolic disease in the intensive care unit.,"Critically ill patients are at increased risk of developing venous thromboemboli (VTE). Risk factors that predispose them to acquiring VTE encompass factors that usually afflict the general medical population as well as factors attained in the intensive care unit (ICU) (e.g., sedation, mechanical ventilation). The poor cardiopulmonary reserve of this patient population is intolerant of even small pulmonary emboli (PE), which emphasizes the importance of preventing VTE from ever occurring. Indeed, the complications associated with hospital-acquired VTE increase morbidity, mortality, hospital length of stay, and costs. Without thromboprophylaxis, the incidence of VTE in the ICU ranges from 15 to 60%. Systematic implementation of VTE prophylaxis significantly reduces this rate and as a consequence, morbidity and mortality. In fact, prevention of VTE is so important that the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) developed guidelines on the use of routine VTE prophylaxis in critically ill patients. Therefore, upon admission, all ICU patients should be evaluated for and immediately prescribed the appropriate thromboprophylaxis therapy."
CD008201,0,27609736,0,Utilization of 4T score to determine the pretest probability of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia in a community hospital in upstate New York.,Thrombocytopenia is common in hospitalized patients. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a life-threatening condition which can lead to extensive thrombosis. Diagnosis of HIT relies on clinical suspicion determined by 4T score and immunoassays through testing for anti-PF4/heparin antibodies. Clinical practice guidelines published by the American Society of Hematology in 2013 recommended use of the 4T score before ordering the immunoassays as a measure of pretest probability. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the utilization of 4T score before ordering anti-PF4/heparin antibodies at Unity Hospital.

CD008201,0,18252727,0,Long-term administration of a low-molecular-weight heparin contributed to successful treatment in a patient with primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma and venous thromboembolism.,"The case of a 16-year-old girl with primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma who had thrombosis in the brachiocephalic, subclavian, and internal jugular veins at presentation is reported. MACOP-B chemotherapy plus radiation therapy could be the first-line strategy, but MACOP-B increases the risk of thrombosis. Although an effective method for initial treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in cancer patients has not been established, recent studies revealed that the administration of a low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) was effective for secondary prevention of VTE. Therefore, the patient in this case was treated with MACOP-B plus rituximab followed by radiation therapy, and an LMWH was administered through the course of treatment. She achieved complete remission and never suffered from VTE. This case suggests that long-term administration of an LMWH contributes to the primary improvement and secondary prevention of VTE even in patients who are at high risk for thrombosis."
CD008201,0,23948622,0,A review of venous thromboembolism prophylaxis for hospitalized medical patients.,"In the last decade, greater focus has been directed toward venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis in hospitalized, non-surgical patients. Both deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism are potentially preventable causes of patient morbidity and mortality related to hospitalization. Despite the availability of high-quality, evidence-based guidelines for VTE prevention, there is compelling evidence that many hospitalized patients do not receive appropriate VTE prevention measures. Hospitalists play an important role in the implementation of appropriate VTE prophylaxis measures for this patient population; thus, knowledge of updated recommendations is vital to their practice, as well as patient safety. We provide a comprehensive evidence-based clinical review of VTE prophylaxis for nonsurgical hospitalized patients, including risk factors and risk assessment, indications for prophylaxis, recommended therapeutic options, and updates from recently released practice guidelines by the American College of Physicians and the American College of Chest Physicians, published in 2011 and 2012, respectively."
CD008201,0,17667344,0,Practice guidelines for deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis in burns.,"Measures to prevent deep venous thrombosis (DVT), including low-dose subcutaneous heparin, low molecular weight heparin, or sequential compression devices, may be considered in high-risk patients, specifically those with a previous history of thromboembolic disease, and in patients with significant burns of the lower extremities. The purpose of this guideline is to review the principles of prophylaxis for DVT in burn patients and to present a reasonable approach for the treatment of patients during burn resuscitation. This guideline is designed to aid those physicians who are responsible for the triage and initial management of burn patients. DVT in the burn patient is a more common event than previously reported, with incidence ranging from 1% to 23% in the few available series. The suspected risk of bleeding using low-dose heparin has deterred most burn surgeons from using heparin routinely in all burn patients. Much remains unknown, however, regarding the real risks and benefits of this complication and its treatment. A Medline search of all English language citations from 1966 through 2006 was undertaken using the key words ""deep vein thrombosis"" and ""deep venous thrombosis"" with ""burns."" This produced 18 references. The addition of the key words ""pulmonary embolism"" with ""burns"" produced a total of 82 references, of which 7 were felt to be relevant to this topic based on evidentiary classification of the data. There are no prospective, randomized, controlled studies evaluating the effectiveness of any prophylactic preventive measures against DVT in burn patients. The apparently low incidence of this condition in burn patients would appear to preclude its evaluation in a single-center study, and no multicenter studies have been conducted."
CD008201,0,16637444,0,[Prevention of venous thromboembolism: generally accepted guidelines].,"This article summarizes the published data on the prevention of venous thromboembolism. Routine thromboprophylaxis is the best way to lower the risk. It is recommended to sort patients according the thrombosis risk and to make use of the standard prophylactic modes. In low risk patients, no specific thromboprophylaxis is needed. Patients with moderate risk levels are candidates for administration of subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) at doses under 3 400 anti-Xa units a day and patients with increased risk at doses higher than 3400 anti-Xa units a day during the period of higher risk. In order to decrease the risk of bleeding, a half dose 2 hours prior or 4-6 hours after the operation can be administered. Under the highest risk conditions, there is a recommendation to combine LMWH over 3 400 anti-Xa units with elastic panty-hose or, alternatively, with intermittent pneumatic compression. At moderate risk levels, subcutaneous administration of unfractionated heparin at the doses of 5 000 units twice a day is also possible and at increased risk levels, a TID administration over the increased risk period. In patients with a significant bleeding risk, the physical method of thromboprophylaxis can be used and pharmacological prophylaxis can set in after the risk of bleeding has passed. Fondaparinux is the alternative to LMWH in people after major orthopaedic surgeries and with a history of heparin induced thrombocytopenia over the past three months. An alternative to the administration of LMWH even after the end of the hospitalization can be warfarin in certain situations. The sole use of acetylsalicylic acid or Rheodextran is not recommended. While undertaking epidural anaesthesia or analgesia, it is necessary to follow strictly the guidelines of the use of pharmacological thromboprophylaxis."

Stroke prophylaxis with anticoagulants is therefore highly recommended. The prevalence of factors that have been associated with a lower rate of prescription and adherence to anticoagulant therapy in these patients is little known. The objective of this study was to explore the clinical characteristics of elderly subjects, with and without AF, consecutively admitted to an acute geriatric unit, discussing factors that may decrease the persistence on stroke prophylaxis therapy. We also highlight possible strategies to overcome the barriers conditioning the current underuse of oral anticoagulants in this segment of the population."
CD008201,0,24862133,0,New strategies of VTE prevention in cancer patients.,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common complication in patients with cancer. VTE is a main cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with cancer and has a significant impact on their quality of life. Preventing VTE in cancer patients reduces both morbidity and mortality. The level of evidence for antithrombotic prophylaxis of VTE in patients with cancer varies for hospitalized and ambulatory patients. Hospitalized patients with active cancer (for both medical or surgical indication) and reduced mobility should receive thromboprophylaxis throughout hospital stay. Prophylaxis of VTE is not routinely recommended for outpatients with cancer on chemotherapy. For these patients, current guidelines suggest that clinicians should consider antithrombotic prophylaxis on a case-by-case basis in highly selected outpatients. Different strategies for identification of high-risk outpatients with cancer who could benefit of thromboprophylaxis are under consideration. The new oral anticoagulants could have a role for VTE prevention in ambulatory patients with cancer who are on chemotherapy, as they are administered at a fixed dose without routine laboratory monitoring and may have fewer drug interactions with anticancer agents."

With VTE's rapid onset of symptoms, association with a precipitous clinical course, and high mortality rate, all urologists should be well versed in appropriate prophylaxis, prompt diagnosis, and expeditious treatment. A MEDLINE(R) search was performed for articles that examined the incidence, diagnosis, and treatment of VTE in urologic surgery. Additional articles were reviewed based on cited references. There is a paucity of prospective studies on VTE in the urologic literature with most recommendations for urologic surgery patients being extrapolated from other surgical disciplines. Retrospective studies place VTE incidence rates in major urologic surgeries among the highest reported-highlighting the importance of thromboprophylaxis. Conversely, VTE was rarely reported in association with endoscopic and laparoscopic procedures making mechanical thromboprophylaxis sufficient. Recent literature reveals delayed VTE occurring after hospital discharge to be a persistent threat despite inpatient preoperative prophylaxis. Computed tomographic angiography has emerged as the test of choice for diagnosing pulmonary embolism, whereas lower extremity duplex sonography is recommended for diagnosing deep venous thrombosis. Traditional angiography is rarely used. Treatment of VTE involves therapeutic anticoagulation for various lengths of time based on presence and reversibility of patient risk factors as well as number of events. Perioperative thromboprophylaxis should be considered in all major urologic surgeries. Urologists should be familiar with incidence rates, recommended prophylaxis, appropriate diagnosis, and treatment recommendations for VTE to minimize morbidity and mortality. The limited number of prospective, randomized, controlled trials evaluating the use of thromboprophylaxis in urologic surgery demonstrates the need for further research."

Deep vein thrombosis diagnosed with phlebography occurred in 9.6% in the Embolex-group and in 25% in the Heparin-Dihydergot-group. Intra- and postoperative blood loss and blood replacement were similar in both groups. Therefore, and on account of the single daily administration, Embolex offers at least the advantage of improved compliance of the patients and reduced workload of the nursing staff."
CD008201,0,9582710,0,The International Normalized Ratio as a measure of anticoagulation: significance for the management of the dental outpatient.,"Susceptibility to bleeding in the patient treated with coumarin derivatives poses difficult management issues for the dentist. Classic monitoring for anticoagulation relied on the prothrombin time, but reagent variability issues have caused the emergence of the International Normalized Ratio (INR) as an alternative, and possibly more reliable, laboratory test for the assessment of a patient's anticoagulation status. The literature suggests that an INR range of 1.5 to 2.5 represents the most appropriate level of anticoagulation for the surgical patient. That is, at this INR, some protection is afforded against thrombo-embolic events without significantly sacrificing effective post-operative hemostasis. Since the patient with an INR value within the recommended range is still anticoagulated, he/she is still at risk for post-operative bleeding. Adherence to local hemostatic measures--such as pressure, topical thrombin, alveolar-placed resorbable sponges, and primary wound closure--offers the patient important adjunctive protection against post-operative bleeding."

This was a descriptive study with prospective follow-up that included patients over 18 year old anti-coagulated with vitamin K antagonists, undergoing elective surgery. Those with atrial fibrillation (AF) at moderate and high risk of thromboembolic events, with mechanical heart valve (MCV) at moderate and high risk of thromboembolic events, and patients' venous thromboembolism (VTE) at high risk of thromboembolic events received bridging therapy with enoxaparin. Embolic and bleeding events in the pre-operative period were recorded. Seventy-eight received bridging, mean age 69.4 ± 11.9 years. Twenty-eight had AF (36.4 %), 12 had VTE (15.6 %) and 37 had MCV (48.1 %). Postoperatively, 1 embolic event (1.6 %) and 12 bleeding events (15.4 %) were documented, of which 10 were minor (12.8 %) and 2 major (2.6 %). The safety of bridging therapy is still under debate, and we should await the result of randomized studies comparing different strategies of bridging vs. interruption of anticoagulant therapy in the pre-operative period prior to reaching a definitive conclusion."

Treatment of venous thrombombolism has remained unchanged, apart from the option of replacement of low-molecular-weight heparin by fondaparinux in the initial regimen. Practical guidance is now available for unfractionated heparin. Administration of thrombolysis is restricted to haemostatically unstable patients and local massive thrombosis, where catheter-based strategies are preferred to systemic fibrinolytics.

CD008201,0,24862132,0,Guidelines for treatment and prevention of venous thromboembolism among patients with cancer.,"The association between cancer and thrombosis has been recognized for more than 150 years. Not only are patients with cancer at a substantially increased risk of developing venous thromboembolism (VTE), the link between several coagulation factors and tumor growth, invasion, and the development of metastases has been established. Reported rates of VTE in patients with cancer have increased in recent years likely reflecting, in part, improved diagnosis with sophisticated imaging techniques as well as the impact of more aggressive cancer diagnosis, staging, and treatment. Various therapeutic interventions, such as surgery, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, targeted therapeutic strategies as well as the frequent use of indwelling catheters and other invasive procedures also place cancer patients at increased risk of VTE. The increasing risk of VTE, the multitude of risk factors, and the greater risk of VTE recurrence and death among patients with cancer represent considerable challenges in modern clinical oncology. The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) originally developed guidelines for VTE in patients with cancer in 2007. ASCO recently updated clinical practice guidelines on the treatment and prevention of VTE in patients with cancer following an extensive systematic review of the literature. Revised 2013 guidelines have now been presented and will be discussed in this review. Although several new studies were identified and considered, many important questions remain regarding the relationship between thrombosis and cancer and the optimal care of patients at risk for VTE."

Low dose aspirin of 75 to 150 mg was most effective and its very low dose below 75 mg was not proven effective. Cilostazol significantly reduced the risk of recurrence in Japanese patients with ischemic stroke, mostly lacunar stroke. Large randomized controlled trials (RCTs) such as MATCH, ACTIVE, and CHARISMA are ongoing to see an effect of aspirin plus clopidogrel. Among patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF), warfarin is recommended in patients at age over 75 years, and those with history of stroke or TIA, hypertension, congestive heart failure, diabetes or coronary heart disease, while aspirin can be alternative in patients without any of these risk factors of stroke. Target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 is recommended in these NVAF patients, although lower INR of 1.6 to 2.5 is recommended to avoid hemorrhagic stroke in elderly patients with NVAF. SPORTIF was conducted to compare ximelagatran, an oral thrombin inhibitor, with warfarin in NVAF patients with risk factors, and the result showed a comparable efficacy and safety of ximelagatran. WARSS did not show any efficacy of warfarin over aspirin in any subtypes of ischemic stroke patients without NVAF, acute MI, left ventricular thrombi, or prosthetic heart valve. PICSS, a substudy of WARSS, also did not show any efficacy of warfarin over aspirin in stroke patients with patent foramen ovale (PFO), although warfarin might be recommended in PFO patients with deep vein thrombosis."

If the patients continue warfarin, they might develop bleeding, while interruption of therapy can cause thromboembolic events. Bridging therapy (mostly heparin) is used in some patients, while others stop medications. There is no unifying protocol. Information on management of patients on warfarin undergoing dental procedures in Saudi Arabia is lacking. Therefore, the current study aimed to provide more insight into various approaches utilized by clinicians to deal with such patients at a large teaching hospital in Riyadh, and to evaluate the frequency and severity of bleeding and thromboembolic complications during different types of dental procedures in this population. This was a cohort study. Patient records were used to collect data on peri-procedural management of patients on warfarin, continuation or interruption of warfarin therapy, as well as bleeding and thromboembolic complications. Fifty medical records were reviewed from March to October 2012. Regarding management, 10% had no proper documentation, 74% underwent bridging therapy, 12% discontinued warfarin therapy, and 4% continued warfarin. Of the patients, 31% had minor bleeding (15% in patients on bridging therapy and 16% in patients continuing warfarin). Thromboembolic complications were documented in 4%, (2% in those on bridging therapy and 2% in those discontinuing warfarin). Patients on bridging therapy (heparin) were admitted to the hospital for a mean of five days, and none of the other patients were admitted. Adopting the protocol to continue warfarin caused bleeding tendency that was controlled with the usual measures, with more cost effectiveness, and no thromboembolic risks."

Seven months after operation, recurrent liver metastases with tumor embolism of the portal vein were revealed by enhanced CT examination. FU (5-FU/UFT) +CPT-11 was done as the first-line adjuvant chemotherapy. Metastatic lesion of the liver and portal vein tumor embolism was decreased. Tumor marker CA19-9 level was also decreased and within normal limits. This therapy was evaluated as a partial response (PR) in twelve months and the patient died three years and eight months after operation. Gastric endocrine cell carcinoma is known as a potentially highly malignant tumor. But in our case FU+CPT-11 controlled growth of the recurrent tumor.

CD008201,0,16596542,0,The role of surveillance in mature arteriovenous fistula management.,"The existing guidelines recommend arteriovenous fistulae (AVF) surveillance by access blood flow (Qa) measurement and the correction of hemodynamically significant stenoses to prolong access survival. Unfortunately, many studies supporting these recommendations are inadequate methodologically; therefore, both the optimal criteria for surveillance and the value of preventive stenosis repair in AVF remain controversial. Recent literature confirms that Qa measurement allows an accurate identification of both stenosis (area under the curve (AUC) ranging from 0.80-0.93) and access at risk of failure (AUC ranging from 0.82-0.98) in AVFs and suggests a Qa <700-1000 ml/min and/or a reduction in Qa >25% as optimal predictors for stenosis and a Qa <400 ml/min for incipient thrombosis. Recent prospective studies evaluated whether Qa surveillance could improve AVF patency rates compared to monitoring based on clinical and dialysis-related criteria alone. The majority of studies have historical, rather than concurrent, control groups and provide conflicting results, some showing a reduction and some showing no change in thrombosis rates by Qa monitoring. On the other hand, the few randomized controlled studies available show that Qa surveillance, when coupled with preemptive intervention, reduces the already low thrombosis rate in AVF and suggest that the functional access life can be prolonged. However, there is still the need for additional methodologically adequate studies to understand fully the role of surveillance in AVF management."

CD008201,0,10069765,0,"Thromboprophylaxis in non-surgical patients: who, when and how?","Because of the serious lack of useable, relevant information, most recommendations for prevention of thrombosis in non-surgical patients are extrapolations from much larger clinical trials experienced in surgery. Directly relevant evidence comes predominantly from very small randomized trials, many of them open label and carried out more than 20 years before the introduction of more recent and important changes in clinical care that may have substantially reduced the baseline thrombosis risk. In these early studies, low-dose heparin and low-molecular-weight heparins prevented subclinical deep vein thrombosis in ischaemic stroke, myocardial infarction and among elderly medical inpatients. Although it is likely that these drugs also prevent subclinical deep vein thrombosis after spinal cord injury or other major trauma, and when patients require intensive medical care, the supporting evidence in these circumstances comes mainly from cohort studies and poorly controlled comparisons. In contrast, the heparins have not reduced mortality or demonstrably prevented pulmonary embolism after ischaemic stroke or among elderly medical inpatients in large and well-conducted clinical endpoint trials, from which no clinically important benefit could be demonstrated. From analyses it is suggested that such benefit is probably more difficult to demonstrate for medical than for surgical patients. In the absence of sufficient information that is specific to medical patients, various forms of prophylaxis known to be effective in surgery will continue to be applied in high-risk individuals. After venous thromboembolism, it now appears that the best duration of oral anticoagulant therapy to prevent a recurrence is determined to a greater extent by whether the thrombotic episode was idiopathic or triggered by a clinically recognizable cause, whether it was transient or continuing, and whether the deep vein thrombosis was extensive, limited to the calf veins or was a first or recurrent event."
CD008201,0,11744787,0,Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.,"There has been a tendency to treat paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) in a similar way to sustained AF, but treatment objectives may be very different. We discuss current definitions, epidemiology, pathophysiology and natural history of PAF, and review evidence for its treatment and management. PAF comprises between 25% and 62% of cases of AF, with similar underlying causes to those in sustained AF. The main objective of management is prevention of paroxysms and long-term maintenance of sinus rhythm, and Class 1c drugs are highly effective, although beta-blockers are useful alternatives. If patients have severe coronary artery disease or poor ventricular function, amiodarone is probably the drug of choice. Although randomized controlled trials of thromboprophylaxis in patients with paroxysmal AF per se are lacking, the approach to patients with paroxysmal AF should be similar to that in patients with sustained AF, with warfarin for 'high risk' patients and aspirin for those at 'low risk'. Non-pharmacological therapeutic options, including pacemakers, electrophysiological techniques and the implantable atrial defibrillator, show great promise. Despite paroxysmal AF being a common condition, management strategies are limited by evidence from small randomized trials, with inconsistencies over the definition of the arrhythmia and the inclusion of only symptomatic subjects. Evidence for antithrombotic therapy is also based on epidemiological studies and subgroup analyses of the large randomized trials."

CD008201,0,25212472,0,[Psychopathology of the misuse of Subutex®: The Popeye syndrome].,"High dose buprenorphine (HDB), commonly known as Subutex(®), is nowadays largely prescribed as a replacement therapy for major opiate dependence. Its sublingual administration allows a decrease in the withdrawal syndrome accompanying opiate abuse cessation. Over the past few decades, epidemiological data on people on replacement therapy have emphasized an increase in the misuse of Subutex(®) and more specifically intravenous injections of HDB. These growing practices pave the way to major physical consequences or even death. Several studies have highlighted the infectious, vascular, venous and arterial (pseudo-aneurysm) complications stemming from this habit. Among the possible vascular complications, we can notice the presence of abscess, venous thrombosis, phlegmons, skin necrosis, cellulite, and profound and superficial thrombophlebitis at injection sites. These can evolve into chronic edemas of the tips and subcutaneous nodules. The Popeye syndrome is one of the possible complications of this misuse. This syndrome is characterized by the swelling of both sides of the forearms and hands. These edemas tend to become persistent and to be paired with tissue changes such as skin thickening. Besides, the increase in the hands volume can occur bilaterally or sometimes in an asymmetrical way, accentuated on the hand of the non-dominant limb. This syndrome does not decrease, or just a little, after the stoppage of injections. It can have a psychological, social, psychopathological and esthetic impact."

CD008201,0,15857352,0,Venous thromboembolism in the medically ill patient: a call to action.,"The risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in medical patients is generally underestimated. However, recent studies including two large double-blind placebo-controlled trials, the Prospective Evaluation of Dalteparin Efficacy for Prevention of VTE in Immobilised Patients trial (PREVENT) and prophylaxis in MEDical patients with ENOXaparin, study show that low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs) provide effective thromboprophylaxis for medical patients at risk from VTE without increasing the risk of bleeding. In PREVENT the significant 45%, reduction in VTE among patients receiving dalteparin 5000 IU once daily for 14 days was attributed entirely to a reduction in clinically relevant VTE. The recently published guidelines for the prevention and treatment of VTE, issued by the American College of Chest Physicians, recommend prophylaxis with LMWHs (or low-dose unfractionated heparin) in acutely ill medical patients with risk factors for VTE (grade 1A). Current evidence should encourage the more widespread adoption of thromboprophylaxis in at-risk medical patients, and thus reduce the number of preventable deaths and complications due to VTE."

CD008201,0,10747761,0,Formulary management of low molecular weight heparins.,"Low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs) are increasingly being utilised as anticoagulants in healthcare settings. These agents offer several advantages over standard unfractionated heparin. Indications for LMWHs include deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism prophylaxis, deep vein thrombosis treatment, use in coronary procedures associated with a high risk for bleeding, and in acute coronary syndromes. Prior to being added to formularies, LMWHs should be evaluated for efficacy, safety and economic benefits over other anticoagulants. Institutions should be prepared to conduct their own economic assessments in the absence of readily available studies. There is clear evidence that LMWHs are cost saving or are at least cost effective as thromboprophylactic agents in major orthopaedic surgery. The economic benefits of LMWHs in other surgical situations is less clear. Consistent evidence from several countries indicate that LMWHs are cost saving as anticoagulants for the initial treatment of DVT. Further studies are needed to evaluate the efficacy, safety and economics of LMWHs in other conditions besides hip and knee arthroplasty and general surgery."

We analyze data on elderly patients with multimorbidities admitted in the year 2010 to the Italian internal medicine wards participating in the REPOSI registry to investigate the rate of TP during the hospital stay, and analyze the factors that are related to its prescription. Multivariate logistic regression, area under the ROC curve and CART analysis were performed to look for independent predictors of TP prescription. Association between TP and VTE, bleeding and death in hospital and during the 3-month post-discharge follow-up were explored by logistic regression and propensity score analysis. Among the 1,380 patients enrolled, 171 (15.2 %) were on TP during the hospital stay (162 on low molecular weight heparins, 9 on fondaparinux). The disability Barthel index was the main independent predictor of TP prescription. Rate of fatal and non-fatal VTE and bleeding during and after hospitalization did not differ between TP and non-TP patients. In-hospital and post-discharge mortality was significantly higher in patients on TP, that however was not an independent predictor of mortality. Among elderly medical patients there was a relatively low rate of TP, that was more frequently prescribed to patients with a higher degree of disability and who had an overall higher mortality."

CD008201,0,23908465,0,Epidemiology of cancer-associated venous thrombosis.,"Cancer-associated venous thrombosis is a common condition, although the reported incidence varies widely between studies depending on patient population, start and duration of follow-up, and the method of detecting and reporting thrombotic events. Furthermore, as cancer is a heterogeneous disease, the risk of venous thrombosis depends on cancer types and stages, treatment measures, and patient-related factors. In general, cancer patients with venous thrombosis do not fare well and have an increased mortality compared with cancer patients without. This may be explained by the more aggressive type of malignancies associated with this condition. It is hypothesized that thromboprophylaxis in cancer patients might improve prognosis and quality of life by preventing thrombotic events. However, anticoagulant treatment leads to increased bleeding, particularly in this patient group, so in case of proven benefit of thromboprophylaxis, only patients with a high risk of venous thrombosis should be considered. This review describes the literature on incidence of and risk factors for cancer-associated venous thrombosis, with the aim to provide a basis for identification of high-risk patients and for further development and refinement of prediction models. Furthermore, knowledge on risk factors for cancer-related venous thrombosis may enhance the understanding of the pathophysiology of thrombosis in these patients."

CD008201,0,17710074,0,Use of antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants for cardiovascular disease: current standards and best practices.,"Thrombosis superimposed on arteriosclerosis is the principal cause of mortality and morbidity in patients with arteriosclerosis. The use of antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants in the treatment of arteriosclerosis is well established, based on many large randomized trials. Aspirin is indicated for primary prevention in patients at increased risk of developing symptomatic atherosclerotic vascular disease. For patients with known vascular disease, antiplatelet therapy with aspirin is a well-established treatment. For high-risk patients such as those with acute coronary syndromes (ACS; unstable angina, myocardial infarction), dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel is indicated, based on results of the Clopidogrel in Unstable Angina to Prevent Recurrent Events (CURE) trial. Platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa agents are powerful inhibitors of platelet function and are also effective in ACS, but the benefit is confined to high-risk patients. Anticoagulation with heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin (eg, enoxaparin) is also effective, with an approximately 50% reduction in cardiovascular events. These agents are also indicated for patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. Prolonged dual antiplatelet therapy (at least 6 months) is recommended for patients receiving drug-eluting stents. The efficacy of antiplatelet therapy is thus well established in treating atherothrombosis, but aggressive therapy is associated with an increased bleeding risk. Newer agents may provide improved efficacy with a lower risk of bleeding."

CD008201,0,11057840,0,Using progestins in clinical practice.,"Progestational agents have many important functions, including regulation of the menstrual cycle, treatment of dysfunctional uterine bleeding, prevention of endometrial cancer and hyperplastic precursor lesions, and contraception. Because of the reported side effects of synthetic analogs called ""progestins,"" there has been interest in replicating the natural hormone for clinical use. Natural progesterone is obtained primarily from plant sources and is currently available in injectable, intravaginal and oral formulations. An oral micronized progesterone preparation has improved bioavailability and fewer reported side effects compared with synthetic progestins. Adolescents and perimenopausal women may require progestational agents for the treatment of dysfunctional uterine bleeding resulting from anovulatory cycles. These agents may also be used in women at risk for endometrial hyperplasia because of chronic unopposed estrogen stimulation. Progestin-only contraceptives can be used in women with contraindications to estrogen; however, efficacy requires rigorous compliance. New progestins for use in combination oral contraceptive pills were specifically developed to reduce androgenic symptoms. It is unclear whether these progestins increase the risk of venous thromboembolic disease.

TIA is a medical emergency and warrants urgent attention. The risk of early stroke following TIA may be as high as 12% at 7 days, and 20% at 90 days, with half of these strokes occurring within the first 48 hours. All people with suspected TIA should be assessed at initial point of health care contact for their risk of stroke. Diagnosis of TIA is more likely to be correct if the history confirms: sudden onset of symptoms, with maximal neurological deficit at onset; symptoms typical of focal loss of brain function such as unilateral weakness or speech disturbance; and rapid recovery, usually within 30-60 minutes. The ABCD2 score is a tool that assists with diagnosis and identifies people most at risk of stroke after TIA. People at high risk of stroke require urgent specialist assessment as soon as possible but definitely within 24 hours. This includes those with ABCD2 scores of 4 or more, crescendo TIAs, atrial fibrillation, or who are taking anticoagulants. People at low risk usually require specialist assessment and investigations within 7 days. This includes those with ABCD2 scores of less than 4 or those who present more than one week after TIA symptoms. As soon as the diagnosis is confirmed, all people with TIA should have their risk factors addressed and be established on an appropriate individual combination of secondary prevention measures including anti-platelet agents, blood pressure-lowering therapy, statin, warfarin (if atrial fibrillation or other cardiac source of emboli), and nicotine replacement therapy or other smoking cessation aid. Urgent assessment and intervention in TIA clinics has been shown to reduce the risk of stroke after TIA by up to 80%. Follow-up, either in primary or secondary care, should occur within 1 month so that medication and other risk factor modification can be reassessed."

Clexane was chosen because it was slightly cheaper than Fragmin. Experts in haematology stated that a daily dose of 40 mg Clexane was equivalent to 5,000 units of Fragmin in high risk surgery. After changing from Fragmin to Clexane for thromboprophylaxis in connection with total hip replacement, an unacceptable increase in perioperative bleeding complications was experienced. Thus, after being used in 18 patients, use of Clexane was discontinued. We compared the group given Clexane with the last 18 total hip replacement patients who had received Fragmin. The two groups were comparable with regard to base line characteristics. In both groups the thromboprophylaxis was started the evening before the operation. We found a statistically significant increase in postoperative wound and drain-site discharge and in number of days with elevated body temperature in the Clexane group. Even though the Clexane group received an average of 1.5 blood units more, their haemoglobin value at discharge from the department was significantly lower. We conclude that a daily dose of Clexane led to more bleeding than 5,000 units of Fragmin did."

Nevertheless, thromboprophylaxis remains greatly underused. The National Quality Forum, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, and the Joint Commission have developed quality measures aimed at improving the provision of appropriate thromboprophylaxis. Reporting of these measures will increasingly become mandatory and hospitals will face financial penalties for failure to report. The approval of new oral anticoagulants (direct thrombin and factor Xa inhibitors) may simplify provision of thromboprophylaxis and eventually increase adherence to guidelines and quality measures. The primary objective of this review is to present evidence supporting the core quality measures for VTE prevention and stroke prevention in patients with AF. The secondary objective is to familiarize physicians with the new anticoagulants and their approved indications. This review concludes with a brief description of the Society of Hospital Medicine online resources for VTE prevention as well as recommendations for planning and implementation of quality improvement in the management of VTE."
CD008201,0,26734329,0,Improving venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis in acute urological admissions during out of hours through the introduction of a urological admission proforma.,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) kills more people than breast cancer, road traffic accidents, and AIDS combined, accounting for approximately 25,000 in-hospital deaths in England annually. The cost to the NHS is estimated at £640 million/annum. The most important element of VTE risk assessment strategy in England is to risk assess all patients for VTE on admission. The aim of our quality improvement programme (QIP) was to monitor our practice regarding VTE prophylaxis of the patients' admitted urgently in our department, and then implement a measure to increase compliance if found to be poor. Our standards were based on the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines which state that all urgently admitted patients must have a completed VTE assessment form within 24 hours of admission and receive appropriate VTE prophylaxis including low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) and/or TED stockings. Our initial audit was conducted over a period of five weeks. All adult patients acutely admitted out of hours (5pm to 8am) were included. We then introduced a specially designed urological admissions proforma and organised several teaching sessions for junior doctors who facilitated acute admissions. Re-audit was performed using the same methods and timescale measuring improvement. Second re-audit six months after the introduction of the proforma, following the induction of the new cohort of junior doctors. - Primary audit: n=44. Proportion of: completed VTE form=56%, LMWH appropriately prescribed=65%,TEDS=35%. VTE related complications=3 - 1st re-audit: n=42.

CD008201,0,14632624,0,Effects of ankle exercise combined with deep breathing on blood flow velocity in the femoral vein.,"Ankle exercises are commonly used to facilitate venous return in the lower extremity and to prevent deep vein thrombosis. Moreover, the respiratory cycle affects venous return. This study examined the effects of ankle exercise combined with deep breathing on the blood flow velocity in the femoral vein. Twenty healthy males (mean age 21.3 years), who had no medical history of lower extremity disease, were recruited for this study. The blood flow velocity in the femoral vein was measured while performing four exercise protocols: quiet breathing while resting (QR), deep breathing (DB), ankle exercise with quiet breathing (AQB), and ankle exercising combined with deep breathing (ADB). Using a Doppler ultrasound with an 8 MHz probe, peak blood flow velocities were collected for a 20 second period at the start of the inspiration phase in each protocol, three times. There were statistically significant differences in the peak blood flow velocity in the femoral vein with the four protocols (p lt 0.001). The mean (SD) peak blood flow velocity in the femoral vein was as follows: QR 10.1 (4.2) cm/sec, DB 15.5 (3.9) cm/sec, AQB 20.7 (6.6) cm/sec, and ADB 26.5 (9.4) cm/sec. Post hoc analyses revealed significant differences between each of the four protocols (p(adj) lt 0.01). The mean peak blood flow velocity in the femoral vein was greatest with the ADB protocol, which implies that the ADB protocol may be useful to prevent the blood stasis in patients at risk of deep vein thrombosis."

However, six small, randomised control trials (RCTs), totalling 1536 patients, compared low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) with controls and showed a significant reduction in asymptomatic deep vein thrombosis (DVT) from 17.1% to 9.8%, with very low bleeding rates. This is likely to be an underestimate of the real risk reduction as most trials excluded high-risk patients from randomisation. There have been no other controlled trials in cast-immobilised patients using alternative prophylactic measures. Together with the RCTs, other cohort studies have identified risk factors that increase the risk for VTE in lower limb immobilisation. In summary, patients in lower limb cast (or brace) immobilisation should be risk assessed and those deemed high risk for VTE should receive prophylactic LMWH for at least the duration of cast immobilisation."
CD008201,0,21148658,0,Continuous peripheral nerve blocks in acute pain management.,"The indications for continuous nerve blocks for the perioperative pain management in hospitalized and ambulatory patients have extended well beyond orthopaedics. These techniques are not only used to control pain in patients undergoing major upper and lower extremity surgery, but also to provide perioperative analgesia in patients undergoing abdominal, plastic, urological, gynaecological, thoracic, and trauma surgeries. Infusion regimens of local anaesthetics and supplements must take into consideration the condition of the patient before and after surgery, the nature and intensity of the surgical stress associated with the surgery, and the possible need for immediate functional recovery. Continuous nerve blocks have proved safe and effective in reducing opioid consumption and related side-effects, accelerating recovery, and in many patients reducing the length of hospital stay. Continuous nerve blocks provide a safer alternative to epidural analgesia in patients receiving thromboprophylaxis, especially with low molecular-weight heparin."
CD008201,0,15724633,0,Management of patients with prosthetic heart valves during non-cardiac surgery.,"Non-cardiac surgery in patients with prosthetic heart valves poses the particular hazards of infective endocarditis, increased bleeding risk and the possibility of acute/subacute valve thrombosis or systemic thromboembolism associated with interrupted anticoagulation. Management is complicated by the absence of randomised trials examining peri-operative anticoagulation management. Thromboembolic risk increases substantially when oral anticoagulation is discontinued and valve thrombosis may be inapparent for 1-2 months. This delayed diagnosis makes it difficult to identify the inciting event, either clinically or in experimental trials. Furthermore, the absence of early post-operative events may falsely suggest that peri-operative anticoagulation was safe and adequate. The approach to management therefore remains controversial. Seamless oral anticoagulation is preferred whenever possible and this is safe for a range of minor procedures, including cardiac catheterisation, dental and ophthalmic surgery. Major surgical procedures require withdrawal of oral anticoagulation before surgery to lower the international normalised ratio (INR) to <1.5 and maintained anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin which should be started when the INR is <2.5 in high risk patients and <2.0 in those at lower risk. The evidence to support the safety of low molecular weight heparins in this situation is scanty and despite its widespread promulgation this approach is NOT recommended. Oral anticoagulation is then resumed post-operatively, though therapeutic levels are not achieved for several days. The determination of which patients require prolonged overlap of heparin and oral anticoagulants is difficult. Clinical judgement is required but these regimes are strongly recommended for those at highest risk of thromboembolism. With strict adherence to these guidelines, the incidence of major complications is low."
CD008201,0,22868431,0,[Thoracic surgery for patients with deep vein thrombosis].,"Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a main cause of pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE), and therefore both diseases are categorized as a serial pathophysiology of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Treatment goals for DVT include stopping clot propagation and preventing the recurrence of thrombus, the occurrence of PTE, and the development of pulmonary hypertension, which can be a complication of multiple recurrent pulmonary emboli. Clinical guidelines stratify the risk of VTE to 4 levels and recommend the treatment options. In high or extremely high risk patients for VTE, the use of low-dose heparin is recommended. The prevention against VTE, such as elastic compression stockings and intermittent sequential pneumatic leg compression( ISPC), is the most important prophylactic treatment against perioperative PTE by reducing thrombotic risk in low or moderate high risk patients for VET. Since there is no clear evidence that screening all or even selected patients for thrombophilias improves long-term outcomes, the physician's clinical judgment, and consultation with appropriate subspecialists should guide management perioperatively. Once PTE is suspected, immediate and accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment are mandatory."

CD008201,0,10549724,0,Low molecular weight heparins in the prevention of venous thromboembolism in nonsurgical patients.,"Hospitalized nonsurgical patients are at risk of developing venous thromboembolic disease (VTED) but, in contrast to surgical patients, only a limited number of prevention trials have been performed. Guidelines for optimal prophylaxis, particularly with respect to low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs), are not definitive. The Fifth American College of Chest Physicians' (ACCP) Consensus on Antithrombotic Therapy makes limited recommendations on the use of LMWH in patients. Recommendations are made for ischemic stroke and general medical patients, but there are insufficient clinical trial data to produce firm recommendations on the use of LMWHs in acute myocardial infarction, pregnancy, and cancer patients. Patients with acute ischemic stroke are at high risk for VTED. The ACCP Consensus recommends employing either low-dose UFH or LMWH. A recent comparison between enoxaparin and UFH revealed an incidence of thromboembolic events in 20% of patients randomized to enoxaparin, compared with 35% in the UFH-treated group. Although the ACCP Consensus states that both low-dose unfractionated heparin (UFH) and LMWH provide effective prophylaxis in general medical patients, particularly those with congestive heart failure and/or pulmonary infections, no specific LMWH or dose is specified. The recently completed Thromboembolism Prevention in Cardiopulmonary Diseases with Enoxaparin (PRINCE) trial compared once-daily enoxaparin with three times daily UFH. Enoxaparin was at least as effective as UFH in reducing the risk of thromboembolic events by 19%. In high-risk pre-defined subgroups with heart failure, enoxaparin was significantly more effective. It is not possible to recommend a specific LMWH for prophylaxis in medical patients, but the recent position adopted by the United States Food and Drug Administration and the World Health Organization that LMWHs are noninterchangeable drugs suggests that thromboprophylaxis guidelines should be strengthened to reflect the level of evidence for each individual LMWH."
CD008201,0,11213658,0,Acute gastrointestinal bleeding: clinical essentials for the initial evaluation and risk assessment by the primary care physician.,"Acute gastrointestinal bleeding is a common medical emergency that frequently results in hospitalization. Rapid initial assessment of clinical parameters such as estimated volume of blood lost, appearance of expelled blood, hypotension, mental status changes, and coagulopathy should all be evaluated as part of the outcomes prediction equation. For upper gastrointestinal bleeding, early endoscopy of the upper gastrointestinal tract will also provide important information to aid in efforts to predict risk. Endoscopic evidence of ongoing rapid bleeding or the presence of a ""visible vessel"" or adherent clot on the ulcer base are findings that are associated with a high likelihood of continued bleeding or recurrent bleeding. Endoscopic therapy can reduce the rates of recurrent bleeding, surgery, and length of hospital stay in patient with these ""stigmata of recent bleeding."" Other endoscopic ulcer appearances such as brown or black pigment in the ulcer base or a clean ulcer base do not require endoscopic therapy, as rates of recurrent bleeding are very low for these lesions. Use of these clinical and endoscopic outcome predictors can also be useful in refining triage decisions as to which patients need to be in the intensive care unit, which need to be admitted to the hospital, and which can have early oral feeding and expedited hospital discharge or outpatient care."
CD008201,0,16758650,0,Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis guidelines: use by primary care physicians.,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE), a prevalent, costly medical condition, is one of the most common causes of death in the United States. Although risk factors for VTE are well known, thromboembolic events cannot be predicted because patients are asymptomatic and screening methods have limitations. Anticoagulant therapy (eg, low-molecular-weight heparin, unfractionated heparin, selective factor Xa inhibitors) has proved effective for preventing thromboembolism, including deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. While quality care for VTE entails prophylaxis for all relevant patients, many high-risk patients are undertreated or treated incorrectly. Both primary and secondary prevention of VTE remain inadequate for several reasons, including lack of awareness of the American College of Chest Physicians guidelines, of the seriousness of VTE, of the benefits of prophylaxis, and of the relatively low risk of bleeding complications. To provide appropriate treatment, physicians must assess the numbers and types of risk factors for each patient, the underlying illness or surgical procedure, and the benefits and risks of possible therapies. The problem of VTE will grow as the US population ages, as surgery is performed on increasingly sick patients, and as the length of hospital stays continues to decrease."

Clinically, PTS is characterized by chronic pain, swelling, heaviness and other signs in the affected limb. In severe cases, venous ulcers may develop. PTS is burdensome and costly to patients and society because of its high prevalence, severity and chronicity. Preventing DVT with the use of effective thromboprophylaxis in high-risk patients and settings and minimizing the risk of ipsilateral DVT recurrence are likely to reduce the frequency of PTS. Compression stockings worn daily after DVT appear to reduce the incidence and severity of PTS but questions regarding their use and effectiveness remain. Future research should focus on identifying patients at high risk for PTS, assessing the role of thrombolysis in preventing PTS and evaluating the optimal use of compression stockings in preventing and treating PTS. In addition, new therapies to treat PTS should be sought and evaluated."

Cancer patients with documented VTE have a notably worse outcome than non-cancer VTE patients. Since VTE is a highly preventable condition, it is striking that large surveys have shown significant underuse of VTE prophylaxis in surgical cancer patients and in medical cancer patients in particular. Recently, guidelines have been issued from European and American medical oncology societies and organizations for identification of cancer patients at risk, and the guidelines give recommendations for treatment of individual groups of cancer patients.

Thromboembolism is the second leading cause of death in hospitalized cancer patients. Thromboprophylaxis with unfractionated heparin or low-molecular-weight heparins has been clinically proven to reduce the risk for VTE and improve outcomes. However, VTE prophylaxis continues to be underprescribed in cancer patients. Recognizing the clinical burden of VTE in cancer patients, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) recently released guidelines for VTE prevention and management. These NCCN guidelines recommend evidence-based prophylactic anticoagulant therapy for all patients admitted to hospital with a diagnosis of cancer who do not have contraindications to anticoagulant use. However, there continue to be barriers to the implementation of clinical practice guidelines and appropriate use of VTE prophylaxis.

CD008201,0,10163420,0,Enoxaparin. A pharmacoeconomic appraisal of its use in thromboembolic prophylaxis after total hip arthroplasty.,"Total hip arthroplasty (THA) is a major orthopaedic procedure with a high risk of postoperative thromboembolism. Increasing demand for this type of surgery, together with its high cost, has led to examination of means by which the cost of THA may be minimised. Current clinical opinion favours the use of suitable pharmacological thromboprophylaxis in patients undergoing THA; such prophylaxis may be provided with subcutaneous standard unfractionated heparin (UFH), oral warfarin or subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). Traditionally, LMWHs have been perceived as being more expensive to use than UFH or warfarin because of their relatively high acquisition cost. However, recent pharmacoeconomic data have shown that cost savings are possible when LMWHs are used. This is attributed mainly to reduced frequency of administration, reductions in costs associated with diagnosis and treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), and the lack of need for laboratory monitoring of blood coagulation parameters. LMWHs have proportionally less anti-factor IIa (antithrombin) activity relative to anti-factor Xa activity than UFH. Enoxaparin, a LMWH with a mean molecular weight of 4 to 5kD, is reported to have approximately 5 times less activity against thrombin than UFH, for equivalent anti-factor Xa activity. Randomised clinical trials in patients undergoing THA have shown enoxaparin to be at least as effective as UFH in the prevention of DVT and PE, with consistent trends towards a lower incidence of DVT with enoxaparin than with UFH. Similar rates of haemorrhagic complications were reported for enoxaparin and UFH in most trials, although a significantly higher total transfusion requirement was reported for UFH than for enoxaparin in a double-blind study. A significantly higher incidence of bleeding was observed with UFH than with enoxaparin in another study, with similar transfusion requirements for both treatment groups. Cost comparisons in which costs were assigned retrospectively to clinical data have shown cost advantages for LMWHs in general over UFH when costs of administration, hospital bed occupancy and laboratory/radiology procedures are calculated. Cost savings with LMWHs were attributed mainly to reductions in the cost of managing thromboembolic complications in patients receiving these drugs. One meta-analysis showed a saving of $US50 000 (1993 figures) for LMWH over UFH (both subcutaneously twice daily) for every 1000 patients. Subcutaneous enoxaparin at a dosage of 30mg twice daily was shown to be more cost effective than oral warfarin in the prophylaxis of DVT and PE in 2 North American studies in which costs were related to outcomes. One study comprised the application of a decision analysis to a hypothetical group of 10 000 patients; an incremental cost effectiveness of $US12 288 (1993 figures) per death averted was reported for enoxaparin. Enoxaparin was also associated with an overall incremental cost effectiveness of $Can29 140 (1992 figures) per year of life saved (YLS) in the other study, in which costs were applied to clinical data obtained retrospectively from 10 randomised trials. Although no cost-effectiveness analyses have been carried out to compare enoxaparin with UFH, a UK cost comparison reported an overall cost saving of pounds 20 per patient (figures from 1989 to 1990) with enoxaparin 40mg once daily subcutaneously over subcutaneous UFH 5000IU 3 times daily. It has also been suggested that the use of once- or twice-daily enoxaparin in preference to UFH may reduce the overall length of hospital stay; a significant difference emerged in 1 analysis (9.9 or 9.5 vs 11.3 days). Pharmacoeconomic data therefore support the use of enoxaparin as an effective thromboprophylactic treatment with potential cost advantages over warfarin and UFH. Cost-effecti"

Unfortunately, there are no guidelines about VTE prophylaxis in patients with hemophilia who underwent these high-risk surgeries. To determine whether these patients have high risk of VTE, we conducted a retrospective study on patients with hemophilia who underwent elective THR/TKA at our institute from 2004 to 2012. Postoperatively, we collected information on duration and method of factor VIII/IX infusion, VTE-prophylaxis, and complications. There were 23 patients with hemophilia, 18 (78%) with hemophilia A and 5 (22%) with hemophilia B, who underwent high-risk surgeries (39% THR and 61% TKA). The VTE prophylaxis included sequential compression device, 12 (52%), and prophylactic enoxaparin, 1 (4%). Ten (43%) patients did not receive VTE prophylaxis. At 1-year follow-up, we did not find any evidence of clinical VTE in our patients. Better risk stratification is needed to identify patients who would benefit from pharmacological prophylaxis."

Further evaluation is usually unnecessary if the lung scan is interpreted as normal (diagnosis excluded) or high-probability (diagnosis accepted). However, if the lung scan is indeterminate (referring to all other interpretations), additional diagnostic studies are usually required. Newer trends in the management of pulmonary embolism and deep venous thrombosis include a more aggressive initial regimen of heparin; simultaneous administration of warfarin with heparin, resulting in a shorter duration of heparin therapy; use of the international normalized ratio to monitor warfarin therapy; and use of a less intense warfarin regimen.

The aim was to determine whether participation in the Get With The Guidelines-Stroke (GWTG-S) quality improvement program would be associated with improved adherence to anticoagulation guidelines for patients with all types of AF. Adherence to warfarin treatment at hospital discharge was assessed in eligible patients with AF who presented with stroke or transient ischemic attack, based on type of AF. Of patients with stroke, 10.5% presented with some form of AF. When AF was documented using electrocardiography or telemetry (ECG) during the present admission, eligible patients were more likely to receive warfarin compared with patients for whom AF was reported using medical history only (78.8% vs 49.4%; p<0.0001). Improvement after GWTG-S participation in warfarin use was observed in patients with ECG-documented AF (73.8% at baseline vs 88.5% after the intervention; p<0.0001), but not patients using history only. Women and elderly patients were less likely to receive warfarin, and these gaps in treatment did not narrow during the quality improvement program for patients with ECG-documented AF and those with history only. In conclusion, anticoagulation for stroke prevention was underused in general for patients with AF, even in such high-risk groups as patients with stroke. GWTG-S was associated with improved adherence for patients with ECG-documented AF, but patients with a history of AF alone were largely untreated."

This is because VTE may lead to sudden death or are often misdiagnosed and therefore treatment is not feasible. Primary prevention usually commences in hospital as VTE following hospitalisation adds to the significant disease burden worldwide. Numerous medical, surgical and other risk factors have been recognised and studied as indications for prophylaxis. The risk of VTE continues following admission to hospital with a medical or surgical condition, usually long after discharge and therefore prolonged primary prophylaxis is often recommended. Clinical and observational studies in surgical patients show this risk extends for months and perhaps more than one year, for medical patients the risk extends for at least several weeks.

Nine hundred twenty-three bi- or tricompartment TKAs and 467 unicompartment TKAs were performed as one-stage procedures. Chemical thromboprophylaxis was used only in high-risk cases in which there was a history of previous thromboembolism or obesity. There were no deaths from PE after unicompartment arthroplasty procedures. Autopsy confirmed PE as the cause of death in 2 patients following bi- and tricompartment TKAs (0.22%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.03-0.8%). The incidence was higher for one-stage bilateral TKA as 1 of the autopsy-confirmed deaths occurred in this group 0.7% (95% CI, 0.02-3.78%). Two other deaths were certified without postmortem examination (pneumonia and myocardial infarction in each case). As PE could not be ruled out as the cause of death in the latter 2 cases, these were considered as possible PE deaths to provide the maximum possible death rate that could result. Thus, the maximum possible incidence of fatal PE after TKA without routine use of chemical anticoagulation was 0.4% (95% CI 0.1-1.1%).

Several novel indirect and direct thrombin inhibitors have been investigated. The heparinoid danaparoid has shown superiority over unfractionated heparin in several indications, but only the recombinant hirudin, desirudin, has exhibited greater efficacy than low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) in thromboprophylaxis for patients undergoing elective hip-replacement surgery, without increasing the risk of bleeding. Three large-scale clinical trials have shown desirudin to be the most effective thromboprophylactic agent currently available in elective hip-replacement surgery; this agent has now been licensed for use in orthopedic surgery. Research is ongoing into the feasibility of still more effective and convenient therapies, such as oral antithrombins."
CD008201,0,16822286,0,The post-thrombotic syndrome: progress and pitfalls.,"The post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) develops in up to one half of patients after symptomatic deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and is the most common complication of DVT. Typical features of PTS include chronic pain, swelling, heaviness, oedema and skin changes in the affected limb. In severe cases, venous ulcers may develop. The frequency of PTS is likely to be reduced by preventing DVT with the use of effective thromboprophylaxis in high-risk patients and settings and by minimising the risk of ipsilateral DVT recurrence. Use of compression stockings for 2 years after DVT appears to reduce the incidence and severity of PTS but issues remain regarding their use and effectiveness. Future research should focus on elucidating the pathophysiology and risk factors for PTS, assessing the safety and effectiveness of catheter-directed thrombolysis to prevent PTS and evaluating the optimal use of compression stockings to prevent and treat PTS. In addition, new therapies to treat PTS should be sought and evaluated."

CD008201,0,1333637,0,Lipolytic effect of low-molecular-weight-heparin (Fragmin) and heparin/dihydroergotamine in thromboprophylactic doses during total hip replacement.,"Eighteen patients admitted for implantation of a primary hip prosthesis were randomized to one of the following thromboprophylactic regimens: (1) dextran 500 ml 12 h-1 on the day of surgery and 500 ml on days 1, 3, and 5 postoperatively, (2) heparin 5000 IU and dihydroergotamine 0.5 mg 8 h-1, or (3) Fragmin (Kabi-Pharmacia, Sweden) 2500 IU 12 h-1 on the day of surgery and 5000 IU 24 h-1 throughout the observation period. Fragmin is a low molecular-weight heparin which has proven both efficient and safe as a thromboprophylactic drug. The purpose of the study was to elucidate whether Fragmin had a lower lipolytic (fatty acid-mobilizing) effect than standard heparin. The plasma level of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) was increased on the first post-operative day both in the heparin/dihydroergotamine (preoperative 217 +/- 79 microU ml-1 vs. 1289 +/- 318, n = 6, p < 0.05) and the Fragmin-groups (136 +/- 16 vs. 668 +/- 123, n = 6, p < 0.05). This increase in plasma LPL was significantly higher in the heparin/dihydroergotamine-group compared to the Fragmin-group (p < 0.05). In both groups, the enzyme activity gradually decreased during the next 2 days. The circulating level of non-esterified fatty acids increased post-operatively only in the heparin/dihydroergotamine-group. Thus, the lower lipolytic effect of Fragmin compared to standard heparin is detectable using thromboprophylactic doses during surgery in patients on a standard hospital diet. From a theoretical viewpoint, the use of Fragmin is advantageous in patients with myocardial ischaemia and patients risking respiratory distress problems due to a low circulating level of non-esterified fatty acids."
CD008201,0,8131550,0,Fatal pulmonary embolism in spinal cord injury.,"Fatal pulmonary embolism (PE) is a major cause of mortality in patients with spinal cord injury. In order to ascertain those characteristics that might predict this event, we reviewed the records of all patients with autopsy-proven massive PE admitted to a regional spinal cord care center over a 5-year period. The information analyzed included patient age, sex, race, height, weight, type of accident, prior use of tobacco, alcohol, or narcotic drugs, level of injury, presence of spasticity, surgical procedures, infections, transfusions, and type of anticoagulant prophylaxis. Forty-two concurrently hospitalized patients with spinal cord injury served as control subjects. Significant differences between cases and control subjects were observed for level of injury (fewer thoracic and lumbar injuries in cases, p = 0.04), less spasticity in cases (p = 0.01), and greater body mass index in cases (p = 0.01). There was also a trend toward more advanced age in the cases (p = 0.1) and more frequent serious infections (p = 0.08). Lastly, low molecular weight heparin had been used as thromboprophylaxis in a greater proportion of control subjects than cases (60 percent vs 22 percent, p = 0.07), suggesting that low molecular weight heparin may be more effective in preventing fatal PE than unfractionated heparin."
CD008201,0,20858180,0,Current therapeutic strategies and future perspectives for the prevention of arterial thromboembolism: focus on atrial fibrillation.,"Arterial thromboembolism is a sudden obstruction of arterial blood flow caused by dislodgment of a blood clot from the site of its formation. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia and a major risk factor for arterial thromboembolism in clinical practice. Most of AF-related arterial thromboembolic events affect the cerebral circulation, leading to increased mortality or long-term disability from stroke. In the setting of AF, stroke is more likely to be fatal or associated with longer hospitalization, greater disability and higher rates of recurrence. Anticoagulant therapy reduces the risk of stroke, and the greatest benefit is achieved in patients at highest absolute risk. Aspirin is a less effective option, and should not be considered as an equivalent alternative for AF patients with a moderate stroke risk, who are eligible for oral anticoagulation. Nonetheless, anticoagulant therapy remains underused in AF patients with high stroke risk, particularly in the elderly, whilst it might perhaps be overused in the low risk patients. This could also be related to limitations in current risk stratification schemas for stroke and bleeding complications of anticoagulant therapy in AF patients in contemporary clinical practice. In this review article, we present an overview of current therapeutic strategies, new developments and future perspectives for the prevention of arterial thromboembolism in the context of AF and thromboembolism. We also discuss risk factors for stroke and bleeding complications, current risk stratification issues and emerging strategies for more accurate identification of AF patients who should be anticoagulated."

Risk factors for VTE are well known and scoring systems have been published. Nevertheless, prophylaxis against VTE is in many hospitals used less often than ideal and also inappropriately. Electronic tools to alert the physicians to provide prophylaxis and suggest suitable measures have shown promising results with a reduction of clinically relevant VTE. Large randomized clinical trials have demonstrated efficacy of low molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), pentasaccharide(fondaparinux) and unfractionated heparin. The results were, however, driven by asymptomatic deep vein thrombosis (DVT), including distal DVT in some studies. A reduction of pulmonary embolism is achieved, but without any significant effect on the mortality. The agents are generally safe, with only a small increase of major bleeding, less with LMWH than with unfractionated heparin. The challenge is still to direct the efforts to the most appropriate patients."

CD008201,0,11251344,0,Preventing venous thromboembolism in general medical inpatients and after an ischaemic stroke.,"Clinical trials and meta-analyses have shown that low-molecular-weight heparin and unfractionated heparin are effective in preventing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in acutely ill medical inpatients who are at risk as they are likely to be bedridden for 6 days or more. It is not known, however, if such prophylaxis can also reduce the likelihood of fatal pulmonary embolism or decrease all-causes mortality in this patient population. No recommendations can be made regarding thromboprophylaxis in those at a lower risk of venous thromboembolism or in short-stay inpatients, as these have not yet undergone clinical trial. Current evidence suggests that high doses of heparin should be avoided after an acute ischaemic stroke, as the results of recent large trials suggest any potential treatment benefit in preventing DVT is cancelled by the increased intracranial bleeding risk caused from the underlying disease."

In this observational study, we evaluated the performance of a scoring system, used as a guide for clinicians administering dalteparin to pregnant women at increased risk of venous thromboembolism. The work included 47 women treated with dalteparin prior to adoption of the scoring system and 58 women treated with dalteparin after its adoption. The indication for thromboprophylaxis was recorded in each case together with details of the regimen employed, obstetric, and haematological outcomes. The main outcome measure was to determine whether consistency improved after adoption of the scoring system. We also recorded the occurrence of any new venous thromboembolism, haemorrhage, the use of regional anaesthesia during labour, evidence of allergy, and thrombocytopenia. We found that use of the scoring system improved the consistency of advice and increased the mean duration of thromboprophylaxis. None of the subjects suffered venous thromboembolism after assessment using the scoring system. There was no increase in obstetric or anaesthetic morbidity when dalteparin was given antenatally period and no evidence of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia."

CD008201,0,19378850,0,[Prophylaxis and treatment of thromboembolism in oncology].,"In this article, following guidelines for clinical practice are formulated. 1. For patients undergoing cancer surgery, pharmacological thromboprophylaxis is recommended. Low molecular weight heparins (LMWH), unfractionated heparin (UFH) 5,000 U three times daily, or fondaparinux are recommended; in the Czech Republic, LMWH are most frequently used. For patients undergoing major cancer surgery extended prophylaxis for 4 weeks is recommended. For patients with a high risk of bleeding, intermittent pneumatic compression presents a reasonable alternative. 2. For cancer patients, who are bedridden, or hospitalized with an acute illness, thromboprophylaxis with LMWH is recommended. Patients with multiple myeloma, undergoing induction therapy, including at least 2 thrombogenic drugs (thalidomide, lenalidomide, dexamethasone, prednison, and anthracyclines) should be treated with LMWH. In other cancer patients, pharmacological thromboprophylaxis is not generally recommended, however, its application should be considered namely in patients with a history of venous thromboembolism (VTE), or in the presence of multiple risk factors. The cancer patients with VTE should be treated with LMWH for the first 6 months; the initial dose being 200 IU/kg daily, this can be reduced to 2/3-3/4 after one month. The therapy should be reevaluated after 6 month and subsequent therapy using LMWH or warfarin is recommended indefinitely, unless the cancer is resolved or any major contraindications arise."

Asymptomatic CVC-related thrombi are more common, but their clinical significance is unclear. Thrombotic risk may be increased by primary thrombophilic disorders, especially the factor V G1691A (Leiden) mutation, thrombogenic catheter material, larger catheter diameter and greater number of lumens, catheter tip malposition, left-sided placement, percutaneous or multiple insertion attempts, a previous CVC or preexisting venous obstruction, prothrombotic therapeutic agents, catheter-associated infections, and fibrinous catheter lumen occlusion. Three recent randomized, prospective, placebo-controlled trials observed no benefit of routine low-dose warfarin or low-molecular-weight heparin in preventing catheter-associated thrombosis. Nevertheless, thromboprophylaxis may be appropriate and safe for selected high-risk patients. Duplex ultrasound can accurately detect CVC-related thrombi involving the jugular, axillary, distal subclavian, and arm veins. Contrast venographic imaging is required for indeterminate duplex findings and to evaluate the deep central veins and pulmonary arteries. Therapeutic anticoagulation, with or without catheter removal, is indicated for patients with acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism who have no contraindications. Catheter removal alone, with close follow-up, may be sufficient when bleeding risk precludes safe anticoagulation. Approaches to managing catheter-associated thrombosis, including the use of thrombolytic agents, are guided by limited published experience and extrapolation from practices used for lower-extremity DVT. Prospective, randomized, controlled trials are needed to identify the safest and most effective anticoagulant agents, treatment durations, and alternative venous access strategies for cancer patients who develop catheter-associated thrombosis."

CD008201,0,17020665,0,Risk factors for the assessment of patients with pulmonary embolism.,"Pulmonary embolism (PE) occurs frequently among cancer patients, with a spectrum ranging from small, clinically insignificant thrombi to life-threatening massive PE. It is fatal in as many as 14% of cancer patients, primarily by producing right ventricular heart failure and cardiogenic shock. PE diagnosis is difficult because the signs and symptoms imitate other commonly occurring diseases. Clinicians must be able to integrate a wide array of diagnostic imaging tools and laboratory tests to ensure rapid assessment and diagnosis. Risk stratification with the use of cardiac biomarkers and imaging tests to evaluate right ventricular function will identify treatment options. Hemodynamically stable patients can be treated effectively with anticoagulation alone, whereas those with right ventricular dysfunction require an aggressive strategy with thrombolysis, surgical embolectomy, or a catheter-based intervention. When anticoagulation is contraindicated, a vena caval filter may be deployed. PE treatment must be customized to the individual and consider the existing thrombus burden, presence of underlying cardiopulmonary disease and right side heart dysfunction, and cancer status of the patient. Clinicians should focus on providing adequate thromboprophylaxis in hospitalized cancer patients to avoid PE treatment."

It is especially common during and after hospitalisation for surgery and acute medical illness though many other risk factors have now been identified. VTE is often preventable with judicious use of preventative measures in the form of thromboprophylaxis and mechanical antiembolism stockings. In 2014, a study was undertaken across all surgical wards at a teaching hospital in London to assess compliance to national guidelines for VTE risk assessment and subsequent institution of protective measures. The initial results demonstrated that performance could be improved in terms of meeting the national target of assessing 95% of surgical inpatients for risk of VTE at admission, prescribing anti-embolism stockings, ensuring that they are correctly worn, and reassessing patients 24 hours later. Utilising a multidisciplinary team approach, simple interventions were put in place such as e-mail reminders, posters, and senior input during ward rounds. Three subsequent measurements demonstrated that sustained improvement was achieved with the national guideline of 95% VTE risk assessment met. Improved performance was noted across all parameters considered, highlighting that simple intervention with all team members involved can improve patient safety and care."

NVAF management guidelines recommend adequate antithrombotic and anti-atherosclerotic therapies. Medication adherence has been recognized as a pivotal element in health quality promotion and in the achievement of better clinical outcomes. We conducted a post-hoc analysis of the ""Atrial fibrillation Registry for Ankle-brachial index Prevalence Assessment-Collaborative Italian Study (ARAPACIS)"" with the aim of discerning differences in pharmacological management and medication adherence among NVAF Italian patients. Furthermore, data were analysed according to Italian geographical macro-regions (North, Center, South) to evaluate whether socioeconomic conditions might also influence medication adherence. Thus, we selected 1,366 NVAF patients that fulfilled the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale-4 items. Regional disparities in drug prescriptions were observed. In particular, in high-risk patients (CHA2DS2-VASc ≥2) oral anticoagulants were more prescribed in Northern and Center patients (61 and 60 %, respectively) compared to 53 % of high-risk Southern patients. Also, medication adherence showed a progressive decrease from North to South (78 vs. 60 %, p < 0.001). This disparity was independent of the number of drugs consumed for any reason, since prevalence of poly-therapy among the three macro-regions was similar. Our results show regional differences in NVAF patients' antithrombotic management and medication adherence, potentially reflecting well-known disparities in socioeconomic status among Italian regions. Future interventions promoting campaigns to global health-care education may be desirable to improve clinical outcomes in NVAF patients."

In the current article, six major randomised clinical trials conducted in the latter patient population are reviewed. Based on a recent meta-analysis of these trials, GPIs reduced the incidence of death or myocardial infarction in patients not scheduled for early revascularisation, with the greatest reduction observed in patients at high risk of thrombotic complications. Major bleeding complications were more frequent in those receiving GPIs, however, the incidences of intracranial haemorrhage and stroke were similar in both treatment groups.

CD008201,0,21403876,0,Arterial and venous thrombosis in cancer patients.,"The most frequent ultimate cause of death is myocardial arrest. In many cases this is due to myocardial hypoxia, generally arising from failure of the coronary macro- and microcirculation to deliver enough oxygenated red cells to the cardiomyocytes. The principle reason for this is occlusive thrombosis, either by isolated circulating thrombi, or by rupture of upstream plaque. However, an additionally serious pathology causing potentially fatal stress to the heart is extra-cardiac disease, such as pulmonary hypertension. A primary cause of the latter is pulmonary embolus, considered to be a venous thromboembolism. Whilst the thrombotic scenario has for decades been the dominating paradigm in cardiovascular disease, these issues have, until recently, been infrequently considered in cancer. However, there is now a developing view that cancer is also a thrombotic disease, and notably a disease predominantly of the venous circulation, manifesting as deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Indeed, for many, a venous thromboembolism is one of the first symptoms of a developing cancer. Furthermore, many of the standard chemotherapies in cancer are prothrombotic. Accordingly, thromboprophylaxis in cancer with heparins or oral anticoagulation (such as Warfarin), especially in high risk groups (such as those who are immobile and on high dose chemotherapy), may be an important therapy.

Little is known about what proportion of patients in daily care this would comprise, and, in these patients, outcome data outside of clinical trials are scarce. To assess the proportion of PE patients receiving outpatient early discharge or in-hospital therapy, evaluate differences in patient characteristics between these subgroups and to assess clinical outcomes at 6 months. Monocentric, retrospective cohort study in 439 consecutive patients undergoing outpatient, early-discharge or in-hospital treatment for PE. Outcome data on recurrent VTE, pulmonary hypertension or death were collected from routine follow-up visits 6 months after VTE diagnosis. PE patients were treated as outpatient (OP; n = 49; 11.2 %); early-discharge (ED; n = 62; 14.1 %) or in-hospital (IH; n = 328; 74.7 %). Median duration of hospital stay in the ED and IH groups were 1 (IQR: 1) day and 9 (IQR: 7) days, respectively. Outcome event rates at 6 months were 3.9 % for recurrent VTE (95 % CI 2.3-6.1, similar between groups), 5.2 % for pulmonary hypertension (95 % CI 3.3-7.8, similar between groups) and 10.7 % for mortality (95 % CI 8.0-14.0). Mortality was significantly higher in IH patients (14.0 %; 95 % CI 10.5-18.3) compared to OP (0 %; 95 % CI 0.0-7.3) or ED (1.6 %; 95 % CI 0.0-8.7) patients.

He was subsequently placed on oseltamivir therapy according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention clinical practice guidelines. During the hospitalization, his international normalized ratio steadily increased to supratherapeutic levels and returned to baseline after discontinuation of oseltamivir therapy. This case represents a drug-drug interaction that has not been previously reported in children or adolescents. An extensive review of the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic literature did not uncover a definitive etiology for this interaction. However, several undefined aspects in each drug's disposition pathway need further elucidation. Until this interaction is understood, caution is warranted, and close monitoring of the international normalized ratio should be performed in all patients prescribed oseltamivir concomitantly with warfarin."
CD008201,0,22457302,0,Primary prevention of venous thromboembolism.,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is the most common cause of preventable in-hospital mortality and all hospitalized patients should be VTE risk assessed. The VTE risk should be weighed up against risk of bleeding on an individualized basis to guide choice of prophylaxis. The most common method of mechanical thromboprophylaxis is graduated compression stockings, although others, such as intermittent pneumatic devices, are available. Stockings have the greatest benefit when used in combination with pharmacological prophylaxis. However, stockings are contraindicated in some patients, including those with stroke or peripheral arterial disease. Various options for pharmacological thromboprophylaxis are available. The most commonly used agents are the low-molecular-weight heparins, but newer orally active agents may play an increasing role in the future."
CD008201,0,19455504,0,Implementation of the NICE guidelines for venous thromboprophylaxis; a national survey of hip surgeons.,"The 2007 United Kingdom National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) thromboprophylaxis guidelines concerning hip arthroplasty remain contentious in spite of significant evidence. A survey among British Hip Society members was performed to investigate the impact of these guidelines. Information on thromboprophylactic measures before and after guideline publication was gathered for three categories; Total Hip Replacement (THR), hip fracture and high-risk patients (as defined by NICE). The response rate was 185/250 (74%). All responders used thromboprophylaxis, but only 44%, 22% and 7% indicated they were currently acting in accordance with guidance for THR, high risk and hip fracture groups respectively. Only 19%, 14% and 14% had changed their practice since publication of the guidance in THR, high risk and hip fracture groups respectively. The effects of national guidance in influencing thromboprophylactic protocols have therefore been limited. The reasons were not investigated in this survey."
CD008201,0,23179181,0,Potential net clinical benefit of population-wide implementation of apixaban and dabigatran among European patients with atrial fibrillation. A modelling analysis from the Euro Heart Survey.,"Vitamin K antagonists (e.g. warfarin) are commonly underutilised, due to limitations such as the need for monitoring, in high-risk atrial fibrillation (AF) patients. We therefore aimed to model the potential impact on clinical outcomes in patients with AF with the use of the novel oral anticoagulant (OAC) drugs, apixaban and dabigatran. We identified all high-risk (CHA₂DS₂-VASc score ≥2 ) patients with non-valvular AF and known one-year follow-up from the EuroHeart Survey on AF (EHS-AF). We modelled the expected numbers of clinical events on the novel OACs using published hazard ratios from their respective phase 3 clinical trials and calculated the numbers needed to treat and the mathematical net clinical benefit. Our analysis included 3,400 patients [39% females; mean (SD) age 67 (12) years; CHA₂DS₂-VASc score 3.0 (1.8)] of which 330 were excluded from the modelling analysis due to concomitant use of OAC and antiplatelet drugs. During one-year follow-up, 108 (3.2%) patients experienced thromboembolism, 51 (1.5%) major bleeds and 146 (4.3%) died. Compared to current treatments (i.e. warfarin, aspirin or nothing) the use of apixaban in high-risk patients would have potentially prevented an additional 17 deaths, 27 strokes and eight major bleeds within this cohort. With use of dabigatran 150 mg BID, 34 strokes could have been prevented and for dabigatran 110 mg BID, 16 strokes and six major bleeds would be avoided. Extrapolation of the data from the EHS-AF to the whole of Europe would translate into the prevention of an additional 64,573 major cardiovascular events and deaths each year among patients with a CHA₂DS₂-VASc ≥2 , by the use of apixaban, 43,235 with the use of dabigatran 150 mg bid and 27,272 with the use of dabigatran 110 mg bid. In conclusion, based on this modelling exercise, the utilisation of apixaban and dabigatran for thromboprophylaxis could provide a profound annual mathematical net clinical benefit on stroke and major bleeds, in European AF patients."
CD008201,0,15767978,0,Outpatient treatment of venous thromboembolism using low molecular weight heparins. An overview.,"The development of low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs) was a significant advance in the treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Their better bioavailability and more predictable anticoagulant activity than unfractionated heparin (UFH) allow subcutaneous administration without close laboratory monitoring, and thus make outpatient treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) feasible. The safety and efficacy of outpatient treatment in selected patients were established in randomized clinical trials comparing subcutaneous LMWH administered primarily at home with inpatient intravenous UFH. Furthermore, during the last few years a large number of studies have supported these findings in various clinical settings of every-day practice. It is also important that home treatment has lead to substantial cost reductions along with improvement in patients' satisfaction and quality of life. Thus, outpatient treatment of DVT provides an opportunity, rarely seen in medicine, to improve patient care while reducing the overall VTE health-care cost, and it is likely that will be the preferred regime for the majority of patients in the future. However, the implementation of a home treatment program is not simple, as the risks of insufficient or excessive anticoagulation would be considerable. A structured protocol is necessary to ensure that patient care is optimal, and the keys to a successful outpatient treatment program are patient selection, patient education, patient access to health care team, appropriate follow-up and health care team communication."
CD008201,0,25418208,0,Patient preferences regarding pharmacologic venous thromboembolism prophylaxis.,The 2012 American College of Chest Physicians venous thromboembolism prevention guidelines emphasized the importance of considering patient preferences when ordering venous thromboembolism prophylaxis.
CD008201,0,25392047,0,Thromboelastography in off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting.,"Thromboelastography enables complete evaluation of the process of clot initiation, the structural characteristics of the formed clot and its stability. Many previous studies have assessed the predictive role of thromboelastography in on-pump cardiac surgery, but there are no clear guidelines on its use in off-pump coronary artery bypass. The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of thromboelastography and its relevance during the postoperative period following off-pump coronary artery bypass."
CD008201,0,22648489,0,Thromboprophylaxis in surgical and medical patients.,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) remains the most common preventable cause of death in hospitalized patients. There is much evidence to show the efficacy of prophylactic strategies to prevent VTE in at-risk hospitalized patients. For example, pharmacological prophylaxis reduces the risk of pulmonary embolism by 75% in general surgical patients and by 57% in medical patients. Thus international guidelines strongly recommend effective preventive strategies for all hospitalized patients defined as moderate to high risk for VTE. Effective pharmacological thromboprophylaxis includes low-dose unfractionated heparin (UFH), low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), fondaparinux, and warfarin. Mechanical prophylaxis with graduated compression stockings and intermittent pneumatic compression is also recommended as an alternative or in combination with pharmacological prophylaxis. Although the volume of evidence supporting the use of thromboprophylaxis is growing, the number of patients receiving adequate prophylaxis is not. Several studies have shown that nearly half of the patients undergoing major surgery or hospitalized for medical illnesses do not receive appropriate antithrombotic prophylaxis. Reducing the discrepancy between evidence-based recommendations and clinical practice seems to be a cost-effective goal. Developing and promoting local protocols and educational activities to encourage prophylaxis in daily clinical practice may be effective. New oral anticoagulant drugs with potentially favorable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics have been developed. After the positive results of phase 3 clinical trials, some of these drugs have been approved for clinical use in the prevention of VTE in the high-risk setting of major orthopedic surgery. These agents include the direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran etexilate and the direct factor Xa inhibitors rivaroxaban and apixaban."

CD008201,0,18496913,0,Prevention of venous thromboembolism in the cancer surgery patient.,"Cancer patients, especially those undergoing surgery for cancer, are at extremely high risk for developing venous thromboembolism (VTE), even with appropriate thromboprophylaxis. Anticoagulant prophylaxis in cancer surgery patients has reduced the incidence of VTE events by approximately one-half in placebo-controlled trials, and extended prophylaxis (for up to 1 month) has also significantly reduced out-of-hospital VTE events in clinical trials in this population. Clinical trials show no difference between low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) and unfractionated heparin in VTE prophylaxis efficacy or bleeding risk in this population, although the incidence of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia is lower with LMWH. The risk-benefit profile of low-dose anticoagulant prophylaxis appears to be favorable even in many cancer patients undergoing neurosurgery, for whom pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis has been controversial because of bleeding risks."
CD008201,0,12721335,0,"BM-573, a dual thromboxane synthase inhibitor and thromboxane receptor antagonist, prevents pig myocardial infarction induced by coronary thrombosis.","The aim of this study was to characterize the effects of BM-573 [N-terbutyl-N'-[2-(4'-methylphenylamino)-5-nitro-benzenesulfonyl] urea], a novel dual thromboxane A2 receptor antagonist and thromboxane synthase inhibitor, on myocardial infarction induced by topical ferric chloride (FeCl3) application to the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery in anesthetized pigs. All control animals (n = 6) developed an occlusive thrombus in the LAD coronary artery. The mean infarct size, revealed by triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC), and the area at risk, evidenced by Evans blue, corresponded to 35.3 +/- 2.2 and 36.9 +/- 2.1% of the left ventricular mass, respectively. In the BM-573-treated group (n = 6), a drug infusion (10 mg. kg-1. h-1) started 30 min before FeCl3 application and continued throughout the experimentation. Among the BM-573-treated group, four pigs did not develop coronary artery thrombus and their myocardium appeared healthy. Histopathological examination of FeCl3-injured coronary artery revealed an occlusive and adherent thrombus in control group, while pretreatment with BM-573 prevented thrombus formation. In infarcted zones, lack of desmin staining and muscle structure disorganization were obvious. Depletion of myocardial ATP content was observed in the myocardial necrotic region of the control group, but not in myocardial samples of BM-573-treated pigs that did not develop myocardial infarction. When BM-573 prevented LAD artery occlusion, the area under the curve of plasmatic troponin T was reduced by 77% over 6 h. These data suggest that BM-573 could be useful for the prevention of myocardial infarction."

CD008201,0,25994838,0,Two doses of rivaroxaban versus aspirin for prevention of recurrent venous thromboembolism. Rationale for and design of the EINSTEIN CHOICE study.,"Patients with unprovoked venous thromboembolism (VTE) are at high risk for recurrence. Although rivaroxaban is effective for extended VTE treatment at a dose of 20 mg once daily, use of the 10 mg dose may further improve its benefit-to-risk ratio. Low-dose aspirin also reduces rates of recurrent VTE, but has not been compared with anticoagulant therapy. The EINSTEIN CHOICE study is a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, active-controlled, event-driven study comparing the efficacy and safety of two once daily doses of rivaroxaban (20 and 10 mg) with aspirin (100 mg daily) for the prevention of recurrent VTE in patients who completed 6-12 months of anticoagulant therapy for their index acute VTE event. All treatments will be given for 12 months. The primary efficacy objective is to determine whether both doses of rivaroxaban are superior to aspirin for the prevention of symptomatic recurrent VTE, while the principal safety outcome is the incidence of major bleeding. The trial is anticipated to enrol 2,850 patients from 230 sites in 31 countries over a period of 27 months. In conclusion, the EINSTEIN CHOICE study will provide new insights into the optimal antithrombotic strategy for extended VTE treatment by comparing two doses of rivaroxaban with aspirin (clinicaltrials.gov NCT02064439)."

CD008201,0,22122182,0,Striking a balance between the risks and benefits of anticoagulation bridge therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation: clinical updates and remaining controversies.,"Long-term anticoagulation with a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) or the new agent dabigatran is recommended to decrease stroke risk in patients with atrial fibrillation. When patients with atrial fibrillation undergo initiation or interruption of VKA therapy, or experience an isolated subtherapeutic international normalized ratio (INR), bridge therapy with a parenteral anticoagulant may be considered. To describe the literature for anticoagulation bridge therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation, we conducted a MEDLINE search (1966-February 2011) of the English-language literature to identify related studies. Ongoing clinical trials were identified through a search of the ClinicalTrials.gov registry. Major national and international guidelines were gathered and evaluated. Additional literature was obtained through review of relevant references of the identified articles. Bridging is not supported by guidelines or clinical trials for patients starting VKA therapy for atrial fibrillation. A subtherapeutic INR value during long-term VKA therapy may be associated with increased thromboembolic events, but the benefit of bridging has not been demonstrated. When VKA therapy is interrupted for procedures, retrospective and cohort data suggest that the decision to bridge should be based on a patient's thromboembolic and bleeding risks associated with the procedure. Typically, it is recommended to use bridge therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation at high risk for thromboembolism, but the benefit of bridging is less clear in patients at low risk. Not all procedures necessitate anticoagulation interruption. Recent trials suggest that VKAs can be continued when patients are undergoing cardiac device procedures and some types of radiofrequency ablation. Several clinical trials are ongoing that will provide more definitive guidance for perioperative anticoagulation management of patients with atrial fibrillation. Patients taking dabigatran are unlikely to require bridge therapy because of a predictable anticoagulant effect and rapid onset of action. However, evidence for optimal perioperative management of dabigatran is needed."

CD008201,0,12393666,0,How we manage venous thromboembolism during pregnancy.,"During pregnancy, physiologic and anatomic changes can complicate the diagnosis of venous thromboembolism (VTE) as well as the management of patients with a high risk of or established VTE. As in nonpregnant subjects, clinical diagnosis of VTE by itself is unreliable and accurate objective testing is essential. Few diagnostic studies of VTE have been performed in pregnant women and, therefore, approaches are largely extrapolated from those used in nonpregnant subjects with modifications to limit the radiation exposure and overcome the limitations of diagnostic testing in pregnancy. Therapy of established VTE during pregnancy consists of therapeutic doses of unfractionated heparin (UFH) or low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), generally given throughout pregnancy subcutaneously and for 4 to 6 weeks after childbirth. A key unresolved issue includes the optimum dosing of LMWH therapy. Maternal warfarin can be safely used after childbirth because it is safe to use in the breast-fed infant of a mother receiving warfarin. Finally, pregnant women with prior VTE (with or without a hypercoagulable state) have an increased risk of recurrent venous thrombosis. A recent study has demonstrated that for women with a single episode of prior VTE, many can be managed without anticoagulants. However, for many, anticoagulant therapy with prophylactic UFH or LMWH is a reasonable option."
CD008201,0,7702425,0,[Floating thrombus in the right atrium and severe pulmonary embolism. Value of intravenous thrombolysis].,"Mobile right atrial thrombi carry a high risk of pulmonary embolism which may be massive and are a medical emergency. Although surgery is commonly indicated, treatment with intravenous thrombolytics is an alternative and was successful in 4 out of 6 cases reported by the authors. Six patients, admitted for severe pulmonary embolism confirmed by pulmonary scintigraphy (6 cases) and by angiography (2 cases), underwent echocardiography which demonstrated a mobile right atrial thrombus. One patient was operated as an emergency and died immediately afterwards. Another, treated with heparin because of contraindications to surgery and thrombolysis had a recurrent fatal pulmonary embolism. In the other four cases, intravenous thrombolytic therapy was started immediately after echocardiography with 250,000 IU of streptokinase in 30 minutes, followed by 100,000 IU per hour for 48 to 72 hours associated with heparin 300 to 500 IU/kg/day. The biological efficacy of the treatment was confirmed in all cases (fibrinogen < 1 milligram; TCA > 60 s). A clinical improvement with improved blood gases was rapidly obtained in all 4 cases. The thrombus had totally disappeared at control echocardiography 8 to 12 hours after the initial examination. There were no complications, in particular no haemorrhages. After 6 months' follow-up, the outcome was good with oral anticoagulants (4 cases) associated with implantation of a caval filter in 1 case. Thrombolysis seems to be an effective alternative to surgery as there four cases demonstrate."

CD008201,0,21329866,0,Canadian Cardiovascular Society atrial fibrillation guidelines 2010: prevention and treatment of atrial fibrillation following cardiac surgery.,"Postoperative atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter (POAF) are the most common complications of cardiac surgery that require intervention or prolong intensive care unit and total hospital stay. For some patients, these tachyarrhythmias have important consequences including patient discomfort/anxiety, hemodynamic deterioration, cognitive impairment, thromboembolic events including stroke, exposure to the risks of antiarrhythmic treatments, longer hospital stay, and increased health care costs. We conclude that prevention of POAF is a worthwhile exercise and recommend that the dominant therapy for this purpose be β-blocker therapy, especially the continuation of β-blocker therapy that is already in place. When β-blocker therapy is contraindicated, amiodarone prophylaxis is recommended. If both of these therapies are contraindicated, therapy with either intravenous magnesium or biatrial pacing is suggested. Patients at high risk of POAF may be considered for first-line amiodarone therapy, first-line sotalol therapy, or combination prophylactic therapy. The treatment of POAF may follow either a rate-control approach (with the dominant therapy being β-blocking drugs) or a rhythm-control approach. Anticoagulation should be considered if persistent POAF lasts >72 hours and at the point of hospital discharge. The ongoing need for any POAF treatment (including anticoagulation) should be reconsidered 6-12 weeks after the surgical procedure."
CD008201,0,19693440,0,Secondary prevention strategies for coronary heart disease.,"Patients with established coronary heart disease (CHD) have a high risk of subsequent cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, and death from cardiovascular disease. Adherence to evidence-based secondary prevention therapies for CHD has improved in recent years but still remains suboptimal. Mortality from CHD in the United States (US) has decreased substantially in recent decades. The decline in US deaths from CHD from 1980 through 2000 has been attributed to reductions in major risk factors and utilization of evidence-based medical therapies. It has been estimated that optimization of secondary prevention strategies could save as many as 80,000 more lives per year in the US. The American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) updated its guidelines for secondary prevention for patients with atherosclerotic vascular disease in 2006. The guidelines emphasize evidence-based developments in the field of CHD secondary prevention and also reinforce the need to implement these recommendations in actual clinical practice through programs such as the ACC's Guidelines Applied to Practice and the AHA's Get With The Guidelines. This review will discuss the epidemiology and risk assessment of CHD, current pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic strategies available for the secondary prevention of CHD, and summarize the guidelines and evidence that support these treatment options. There will be an emphasis on antiplatelet therapy given the important role of thrombosis in clinical cardiovascular events."
CD008201,0,18783850,0,Infection control and antibiotic stewardship practices reported by south-eastern Mediterranean hospitals collaborating in the ARMed project.,"The prevalence of multiply resistant organisms (MROs) reported from south-eastern Mediterranean hospitals highlights the need to identify possible contributory factors to help design control interventions. This was investigated through a structured questionnaire, which examined infection control and antibiotic stewardship practices in hospitals participating or collaborating with the Antibiotic Resistance SurveilLance & Control in the Mediterranean Region (ARMed) project. A total of 45 hospitals (78.9% of invited institutions) responded to the questionnaire; 60% indicated that they faced periods of overcrowding when available bed complement was insufficient to cope with hospital admissions and 62% reported difficulties in isolating patients with MROs due to lack of available beds. Most hospitals relied mainly on washing to achieve hand hygiene, whether by non-medicated or disinfectant soaps. Dependence on solid bars of soap (28.9%) and cloth towels (37.8%) were among the problems identified as well as inconvenient distances of sinks from patient beds (66.6%). Alcohol hand rub was the predominant hand hygiene product in only 7% of hospitals. Programmes for better antibiotic use were mostly limited in scope; 33.3% reported having antibiotic prescribing guidelines and 53.3% of hospitals fed back resistance rates to prescribers. Auditing of antibiotic consumption, whether institution- or unit-based, was carried out in 37.8% of responding hospitals. Multi-faceted approaches aimed at improving isolation of patients with MROs, increasing the emphasis on hand hygiene by encouraging greater use of alcohol hand rubs and introducing effective antibiotic stewardship programmes should be encouraged in south-eastern Mediterranean hospitals."

CD008201,0,22876309,0,Coagulation changes during presyncope and recovery.,"Orthostatic stress activates the coagulation system. The extent of coagulation activation with full orthostatic load leading to presyncope is unknown. We examined in 7 healthy males whether presyncope, using a combination of head up tilt (HUT) and lower body negative pressure (LBNP), leads to coagulation changes as well as in the return to baseline during recovery. Coagulation responses (whole blood thrombelastometry, whole blood platelet aggregation, endogenous thrombin potential, markers of endothelial activation and thrombin generation), blood cell counts and plasma mass density (for volume changes) were measured before, during, and 20 min after the orthostatic stress. Maximum orthostatic load led to a 25% plasma volume loss. Blood cell counts, prothrombin levels, thrombin peak, endogenous thrombin potential, and tissue factor pathway inhibitor levels increased during the protocol, commensurable with hemoconcentration. The markers of endothelial activation (tissue factor, tissue plasminogen activator), and thrombin generation (F1+2, prothrombin fragments 1 and 2, and TAT, thrombin-antithrombin complex) increased to an extent far beyond the hemoconcentration effect. During recovery, the markers of endothelial activation returned to initial supine values, but F1+2 and TAT remained elevated, suggestive of increased coagulability. Our findings of increased coagulability at 20 min of recovery from presyncope may have greater clinical significance than short-term procoagulant changes observed during standing. While our experiments were conducted in healthy subjects, the observed hypercoagulability during graded orthostatic challenge, at presyncope and in recovery may be an important risk factor particularly for patients already at high risk for thromboembolic events (e.g. those with coronary heart disease, atherosclerosis or hypertensives)."

All these women had a history of previous thromboembolism associated to triple antiphospholipid antibody positivity. Nine pregnancies of 7 patients (2 women were treated twice) were thus followed using PE therapy, which has undergone modification over the years. In the cases studied the outcome of pregnancy varied according to the different PE therapy conditions. This study suggests that prophylactic PE treatment administered along with full anticoagulation and IVIG therapy could be a valuable therapeutic option in high risk pregnant APS women. Further studies in this type of patients are certainly warranted."

Studies indicate that pharmacological prophylaxis may reduce the incidence of VTE. However, the use of VTE prophylaxis remains unclear. We aimed to retrospectively assess whether medically ill hospitalized patients with established risk factors receive pharmacological VTE prophylaxis in our 912-bed community-based tertiary care teaching hospital between 1997 and 2003. We randomly selected a sample of 350 medically ill (non surgical) hospitalized patients with risk factors for VTE. A total of 164 of 321 patients (51.1%) received pharmacological VTE prophylaxis. Patients with a platelet count of greater than or equal to 278 K/cu mm, a weight of 146 to 184 lbs, or a weight > or = 185 lbs were found more likely to receive prophylaxis. Patients with cancer as well as other diagnoses (compared to MI patients) were less likely to receive prophylaxis. We conclude that there continues to be a significant underutilization of VTE prophylaxis in this patient population. Strategies for identifying patients at risk for VTE and implementing appropriate protocols to ensure that these patients receive prophylaxis are necessary."

As this anatomy is so prevalent in the normal population, it is likely that there are other factors involved in patients who have a PFO and a stroke. This review will evaluate the existing literature on PFO and stroke to determine what constitutes an increased risk of embolic events in patients with PFO. Given the paucity of existing literature, it is clear from this review that there is a vital need for randomized clinical trials to answer important questions, including what constitutes high-risk anatomy and optimal treatment for patients for the prevention of recurrent stroke."

CD008201,0,21909694,0,The surgical management of chronic subdural hematoma.,"Chronic subdural hematoma (cSDH) is an increasingly common neurological disease process. Despite the wide prevalence of cSDH, there remains a lack of consensus regarding numerous aspects of its clinical management. We provide an overview of the epidemiology and pathophysiology of cSDH and discuss several controversial management issues, including the timing of post-operative resumption of anticoagulant medications, the effectiveness of anti-epileptic prophylaxis, protocols for mobilization following evacuation of cSDH, as well as the comparative effectiveness of the various techniques of surgical evacuation. A PubMed search was carried out through October 19, 2010 using the following keywords: ""subdural hematoma"", ""craniotomy"", ""burr-hole"", ""management"", ""anticoagulation"", ""seizure prophylaxis"", ""antiplatelet"", ""mobilization"", and ""surgical evacuation"", alone and in combination. Relevant articles were identified and back-referenced to yield additional papers. A meta-analysis was then performed comparing the efficacy and complications associated with the various methods of cSDH evacuation. There is general agreement that significant coagulopathy should be reversed expeditiously in patients presenting with cSDH. Although protocols for gradual resumption of anti-coagulation for prophylaxis of venous thrombosis may be derived from guidelines for other neurosurgical procedures, further prospective study is necessary to determine the optimal time to restart full-dose anti-coagulation in the setting of recently drained cSDH. There is also conflicting evidence to support seizure prophylaxis in patients with cSDH, although the existing literature supports prophylaxis in patients who are at a higher risk for seizures. The published data regarding surgical technique for cSDH supports primary twist drill craniostomy (TDC) drainage at the bedside for patients who are high-risk surgical candidates with non-septated cSDH and craniotomy as a first-line evacuation technique for cSDH with significant membranes. Larger prospective studies addressing these aspects of cSDH management are necessary to establish definitive recommendations."

CD008201,0,20978716,0,Venous thromboembolism in medical outpatients - a cross-sectional survey of risk assessment and prophylaxis.,"The degree of thromboprophylaxis in medical outpatients is low despite a substantial risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE). This may be attributable to difficulties in assessing risk. Assessment tools like the Haas' scorecard aid in determining the need for thromboprophylaxis. We aimed at evaluating how the use of this tool may aid physicians in appropriately using anticoagulants. This was an epidemiological, cross-sectional survey of acute medically ill patients with limited mobility treated by general practitioners and internists. Risk assessment for VTE by the treating physician was compared to calculated risk. Of 8,123 patients evaluated between August 2006 and April 2008, 7,271 fulfilled the in- and exclusion criteria. Mean age was 69.4 ± 13.6 years, and 45.2% were male. Of these 82.8% were high risk based on their acute medical condition, 37.9% based on their underlying chronic condition. Immobilisation, heart failure, pneumonia, age, obesity, and major varicosis were the most frequently encountered risk factors. The agreement between the Haas' scorecard and physician indicated risk was high. At least 94.1% of patients with high risk received adequate anticoagulation mostly as low molecular weight heparins for a mean duration of 15.1 ± 30.5 days. There is a substantial risk for VTE in medical outpatients. Using a simple structured scorecard resulted in an overall appropriate risk assessment and high degree of anticoagulation. The scorecard may provide a tool to improve the overall awareness for VTE risk in medical outpatients, substantially improving the degree of prophylaxis in a patient population with largely underestimated risk."

The 5-year and 10-year graft survivals for 128 living donor (LD) transplants performed at NUHS were 90.2% and 72% respectively. 5-year and 10-year patient survivals for DD transplants performed at NUHS were 98.6% and 95.1%. The projected graft half lives were 14.6 and 20.6 years for DD and LD transplants respectively. These results compare favorably with the 10-year survival rates of 40% and 58% for DD and LD grafts reported by the United States Renal Data System (USRDS) in 2010. The younger age and the lower prevalence of diabetes and HLAmismatch in the DD and LD transplant study populations, in comparison to the USRDS population and perhaps better access and compliance to maintenance immunosuppression, could have contributed to these excellent outcomes. The 5-year and 10-year graft survivals for 162 transplants receiving what were likely deceased donor kidneys from China were 89.2% and 69.2% respectively. Although these survivals were apparently better than that for DD performed at NUHS, the advantage for China Tx disappeared when DD with primary non function or vascular thrombosis were excluded from analysis. The 5-year and 10-year patient survivals for 30 transplants receiving live non-related transplants from India were 82.3% and 60.1%. Both groups were considered to have received commercial transplants based on various aspects of history from the patients. Among those receiving China_Tx or India Tx, there were a disproportionate number of males and Chinese; and a significant proportion underwent pre-emptive transplant or transplant after only a short period of dialysis. Prevalence of post-transplant hepatitis B was significantly higher among China_Tx than their DD counterparts (7.7% vs. 1.2%, P = 0.005); likewise, post transplant hepatitis C was significantly higher for India_Tx than their LD counterparts (23.1% vs. 3.4%, P = 0.003). These results suggest that commercialization in transplant, results in inequities to access to transplantation and is associated with compromise in screening for infections among potential donors or in observing safety precautions during dialysis."

CD008201,0,19858962,0,Venous thromboembolism: a chronic illness.,"Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a common disorder frequently seen in both the inpatient and outpatient settings. DVT increases the risk of pulmonary embolism, a potentially fatal complication. These 2 conditions--DVT and pulmonary embolism--comprise venous thromboembolism (VTE), which is a major and often unrecognized cause of morbidity and mortality in hospitalized and ambulatory patients. Acquired risk factors include smoking, obesity, stasis (such as long-term travel), hypercoagulability, recent surgery, trauma, or hospitalizations. In addition, inherited or innate disorders that pose risk include increasing age and personal or family history of VTE.After a first episode of VTE, the risk for recurrent episodes of a DVT is elevated: 21.5% after a first event and 27.9% after a second. And, the risk of recurrence varies with time, with highest risk occurring during the first 6 to 12 months after the event. Death occurs in 6% of DVT cases within 1 month of diagnosis. Once a DVT occurs, the risk recurrence never resolves to zero; therefore, VTE should be considered a chronic illness rather than a short-term condition. As a key member of the healthcare team, the role a nurse practitioner is to identify patients at risk for VTE and institute appropriate preventative/treatment measures. By doing so, morbidity and mortality from this common disorder can be minimized."
CD008201,0,23629820,0,Risk of venous thromboembolism in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.,"There is ample evidence of an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Recent large studies have quantified this risk showing that IBD patients run a 1.5 to 3.6 higher risk of developing VTE than healthy controls. The development of VTE in IBD seems to be multifactorial, resulting from multiple interactions between acquired and inherited risk factors. The most important independent acquired risk factors include disease activity, hospitalization, colonic localization, and recent surgery. The main genetic defects that have been established as risk factors for VTE in the general population are rather uncommon in IBD, but when present, they increase the risk of VTE. IBD has been demonstrated to represent an independent risk factor for the recurrence of VTE. An increased risk of VTE-related mortality when compared with non-IBD patients has been reported. The guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of IBD patients with VTE are similar to that of thrombotic non-IBD patients. There is a consensus on the use of thromboprophylaxis mainly in hospitalized IBD patients with acute flares, but the prevention strategies need further evaluation in future studies."

CD008201,0,19074092,0,Duration of anticoagulation therapy for venous thromboembolism.,"Treatment of acute deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism-often denominated together as venous thromboembolism (VTE)- consists of parenteral administration of heparin (usually low-molecular-weight heparin or alternatively unfractionated heparin or fondaparinux) overlapped and followed by oral vitamin K antagonists that are administered for a certain period (usually 3 to 12 months). Recommended or suggested durations differ according to guidelines. Practically, the clinical decision in an individual patient depends upon the estimated risks of VTE recurrence and treatment-induced bleeding. The risk of VTE recurrence is higher in idiopathic events (about 10% per year during the first two years and 3% per year thereafter) (odds ratio of 2.4, compared to secondary events); in male subjects (at least before the age of 60, with an odds ratio of 2-4); in patients with persistently elevated D-dimer level (odds ratio of 2.3, compared with normal level); and during the first two years after discontinuation of treatment. The annual risk of major bleeding on anticoagulant treatment vary largely in observational studies with figures of 2% to 29%, depending on the patient characteristics. The case-fatality rate is 8% (DVT), 12% (PE) for recurrent VTE, and about 10% for major bleed. These figures do not support long-term anticoagulant therapy, except in those patients exhibiting a very high risk of recurrence and/or a very low risk of bleeding. New therapeutic aspects might impact on the duration of anticoagulant therapy after a venous thromboembolic event. They include the possibility of pursuing anticoagulant treatment at a reduced INR after an initial period with an INR 2-3, and the advent of new, more specific and orally active anticoagulants. These features might modify the risk-benefit balance of extending anticoagulant therapy beyond the usual, limited duration."

CD008201,0,9161145,0,Management of the anticoagulated dental patient.,"An understanding of the primary mechanisms of hemostasis, including the coagulation pathways and the intrinsic, extrinsic, and common systems, is the basis for treating the anticoagulated patient. Two major anticoagulants are used for treating those who may be at risk for thromboembolic crisis. These drugs include Coumadin, which is an oral anticoagulant, and heparin, a parenteral anticoagulant, which is often used for acute thromboembolic episodes or for hospitalization protocols that include significant surgical procedures. The practitioner should be familiar with common dental drugs that can interact with anticoagulants and should consult with the patient's physician before administering any such drugs. By placing the patient into one of three dental treatment categories, appropriate anticoagulation therapy can be rendered to each patient according to his or her needs. Low-risk procedures require no change in anticoagulation medication. For moderate-risk procedures, withdrawal of anticoagulation medication 2 days before the procedure and verified with the PT the day of the procedure is indicated. For high-risk dental procedures, using a heparin protocol should be strongly considered. In all instances of dental treatment, the oral tissues should be treated atraumatically using local hemostatic measures for control of hemorrhage. Treating medically compromised patients who are on a variety of medications is becoming more common in dentistry today. Understanding the underlying disease and the appropriate protocol for treatment of anticoagulated patients reduces the risk of thromboembolism and hemorrhagic complications."

According to American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Society of Echocardiography 2011 Appropriateness Criteria, TEE is appropriate in the evaluation of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) to facilitate clinical decision making with regards to anticoagulation and/or DCC. However, it is unclear in which instances physicians utilize TEE. We reviewed 671 TEE studies in 604 AF patients (age 66 ± 13 years, 67% male) in which TEE was performed before DCC for left atrial thrombus (LAT)/sludge. Studies were divided by the main indication for TEE into the following 8 categories: 1) congestive heart failure (CHF)/hemodynamic compromise; 2) symptomatic; 3) new onset AF; 4) hospitalized and symptomatic; 5) high stroke risk; 6) subtherapeutic anticoagulation; 7) miscellaneous; and 8) inappropriate for TEE. The main indications for TEE before DCC were symptomatic (26.4%) and CHF/hemodynamic compromise (26.1%). We deemed 2.7% of the studies as inappropriate. LAT/sludge was found in 8.2% of studies. Incidence of LAT/sludge differed significantly between indications (p = 0.0021) and the highest incidences occurred in the high stroke risk (17.6%) and hospitalized and symptomatic (14.1%) categories. No LAT/sludge was found in the miscellaneous or inappropriate groups. Stroke occurred in 2.5% (n = 15) of all patients and in all groups except for miscellaneous and inappropriate (p = 0.3). TEE is appropriately used prior to DCC for patients with the main indications of symptomatic and CHF/hemodynamic compromise. In a minority of studies, TEE utilization was inappropriate. Incidence of LAT/sludge differed between indications."

Furthermore, the timing and incidence of hypercoagulability, which predisposes to these events is unknown, with institutional screening programs serving primarily to establish a diagnosis after an event has occurred. Emerging evidence suggests that point of care (POC) rapid thrombelastography (r-TEG) provides a real-time analysis of comprehensive thrombostatic function, which represents an analysis of both enzymatic and platelet components of thrombus formation. We hypothesized that r-TEG can be used as a screening tool to identify hypercoagulable states in surgical patients and would predict subsequent thromboembolic events."

Patients with lung cancer are at greatest risk for development of VTE in the ambulatory care treatment setting. Literature does exist on VTE management for medical and surgical oncology inpatients, as well as clinical guidelines for inpatient prophylaxis; however, published evidence is lacking on outpatient risk and thromboprophylaxis in medical oncology outpatients, particularly patients with lung cancer. Because patients with lung cancer treated in the ambulatory setting have established risks for VTE, they may benefit from thromboprophylaxis. Clinical guidelines for outpatient thromboprophylaxis direct the clinical practice for thromboprophylaxis in lung cancer treatment. The purpose of the current article is to explore the VTE risks associated with ambulatory lung cancer treatment and to review the recommended guidelines for thromboprophylaxis to guide clinical decision making for patients with lung cancer."

European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Guidelines 2009 on the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of infective endocarditis].","Infective endocarditis (IE) is a severe form of valve disease still associated with a high mortality (10-26 % in-hospital mortality). IE is a rare disease, with reported incidences ranging from 3 to 10 episodes/100,000 people per year. The epidemiological profile of IE has changed over the last few years, with newer predisposing factors - valve prostheses, degenerative valve sclerosis, intravenous drug abuse (IVDA), associated with the increased use of invasive procedures at risk for bacteremia. Health care-associated IE represents up to 30 % cases of IE, justifying aseptic measures during venous catheters manipulation and during any invasive procedures. There is a lack of scientific evidence for the efficacy of infective endocarditis prophylaxis. Thus, antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended only for patients with the highest risk of IE undergoing the highest risk dental procedures. Good oral hygiene and regular dental review have a very important role in reducing the risk of IE. Echocardiography and blood cultures are the cornerstone of diagnosis of IE. TTE must be performed first, but both TTE and TEE should ultimately be performed in the majority of cases of suspected or definite IE. The treatment of IE relies on the combination of prolonged antimicrobial therapy and - in about half patients - surgical eradication of the infected tissues. The 3 main complications of IE indicating early surgery are heart failure (HF), uncontrolled infection, and prevention of embolic events. HF is the most frequent and severe complication of IE. Unless severe comorbidity exists, the presence of HF indicates early surgery.

Although the incidence of thrombosis varies from 0.2% among in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycles and up to 10% for severe cases of the syndrome, it represents the most dangerous complication of OHSS. Different changes in haemostatic markers have been found to create a state of hypercoagulability, but no single standard test is available to estimate the state of thrombosis. The role of markers for thrombophilia is controversial. Thromboses are mostly venous (67-75%) involving upper limbs and neck, then arterial (25-33%) which are mainly intracerebral. The predominant sites of venous thromboembolism in the upper part of the body may be explained by higher concentrations of estrogens drained through lymphatic ducts from ascites and by compression of rudimentary branchyal cysts. Once early diagnosis is established, it is crucial to use an anticoagulant treatment with heparin proceeded with thromboprophylaxis. However, identification of patients at risk and preventive measures of OHSS are the best means in reducing the risk of thrombosis after ovarian stimulation."

Extensive dystrophic calcification determines aortic stenosis, and may affect either a normally tricuspid or a congenitally bicuspid valve. Surgical valve replacement is now a low risk option, even in elderly persons, whereas the efficacy of balloon valvuloplasty is questionable. Aortic incompetence in adults and aged persons is mostly the consequence of aortic tunica media atrophy with anular ectasia, in the setting of nearly normal aortic leaflets. Mitral valve prolapse is the main cause of mitral incompetence; spontaneous cordal rupture is a late complication in the natural history of this disease, thus warranting prompt surgical valve repair or replacement. The entire spectrum of cardiomyopathies is observed in the elderly: dilated, hypertrophic, restrictive, arrhythmogenic. Cardiac amyloidosis is by far the most frequent secondary form and leads to congestive heart failure by impairing ventricular compliance. Idiopathic fibrosis of the specialized AV junction or dystrophic calcification of central fibrous body are the usual substrates of AV block, which requires pace-maker implantation. Nonrheumatic atrial fibrillation, due to fibro-fatty degeneration of the atrial musculature or dilated left atrium, carries a high risk of thromboembolic complications and cerebral accidents; oral anticoagulants have proven to be effective in preventing stroke. Aortic dissecting aneurysm is a spontaneous laceration, and usually a complication of longstanding systemic hypertension; exceptionally, spontaneous dissection may primarily occur in the coronary arteries. In conclusion, longevity at present is mostly threatened by cardiovascular disease, among which the role of degenerative, non-atherosclerotic disorders may be greater than thought."
CD008201,0,19219778,0,Fatal pulmonary embolism following hip and knee replacement. A study of 2153 cases using routine mechanical prophylaxis and selective chemoprophylaxis.,"In order to prevent fatal pulmonary embolism, TED stockings, foot pumps and early mobilisation on the second post-operative day are used at our centre. Only patients deemed to be high risk (previous DVT/PE or obese) are given clexane as inpatients and warfarin for six weeks post-op. From the hospital database 1137 primary total hip replacements and 1017 primary total knee re-placements were identified and the figures were confirmed with the theatre implant order books. The cause of death for those patients on the database, now deceased, was obtained from the coroner. Where a postmortem had not been performed the patient was assumed to have died of a PE. Within three months of surgery, a fatal PE rate of 0.09% (95% CI 0.00-0.26%) following hip replacement and 0.20% (95% CI 0.00-0.46%) after knee replacement was found. Thirty-four patients had been discharged on warfarin according to the pharmacy records. We would therefore not recommend the routine use of chemical thromboprophylaxis following joint replacement."
CD008201,0,11136946,0,Venous thromboembolism after acute stroke.,"Treatment for venous thromboembolism (VTE) is highly effective in preventing morbidity and mortality, yet pulmonary embolism (PE) accounts for up to 25% of early deaths after stroke. This is because the current diagnostic paradigm is reactive rather than proactive: the clinician responds to VTE when it becomes symptomatic, in the expectation that initiation of treatment will prevent progression to more serious manifestations. This approach is flawed, because sudden death from PE is frequently unheralded and nonfatal symptomatic pulmonary emboli are often unrecognized or misdiagnosed."

After 1 month of anticoagulation with warfarin (bridged with inpatient intravenous heparin), follow-up echocardiography with contrast showed resolution of the thrombus.

CD008201,0,23252920,0,Risk of venous thromboembolism during treatment with antipsychotic agents.,"The evidence to date on the relation between the risk of venous thromboembolic disease (VTE) and antipsychotic agents derives primarily from observational and case history studies. While an increased risk of VTE has been associated with first-generation low-potency antipsychotic agents, particularly clozapine, there appears to be a growing number of reports on the occurrence of this adverse reaction during the use of second-generation antipsychotics, such as risperidone and olanzapine. The highest risk of pathological blood clotting emerges during the first 3 months after initiation of treatment with the product. Potential etiopathogenetic factors leading to VTE during treatment with antipsychotic agents include sedation, obesity, elevation of antiphospholipid antibodies, increased platelet activation and aggregation, hyperhomocysteinemia, and hyperprolactinemia. Diagnoses of schizophrenia and/or bipolar affective disorder, as well as hospitalization or stress with sympathetic activation and elevation of catecholamine levels, have been reported as known prothrombogenic factors. The present article contains the new version of the guideline for the prevention of VTE in psychiatric patients with limited mobility.

Less invasive methods are feasible with ultrasound fetal assessment for alpha-thalassaemia, analysis of circulating fetal nucleic acid in maternal plasma, and pre-implantation genetic diagnosis. Women with thalassaemia major and intermedia are at risk of various maternal complications, such as cardiac failure, alloimmunisation, viral infection, thrombosis, endocrine and bone disturbances. Therefore, it is prudent to adhere to a standard management plan in this group of pregnant women. Close monitoring of the maternal and fetal condition during pregnancy is essential, and various treatments, such as blood transfusion or postpartum prophylaxis for thromboembolism, may be indicated. After birth, resumption of iron chelation and bisphosphonates treatment is needed, and counselling on breast feeding and contraception should be given."

A 55-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with abdominal pain and subileus. Abdominal ultrasonography, computed tomography, and angiography revealed HCC with obstruction of the main portal vein due to tumor thrombus. Serum levels of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist-II (PIVKA-II) were elevated. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy was tried with a course of low-dose cisplatin (CDDP) +5-fluorouracil (5-FU) intrahepatic arterial infusion through the indwelling catheter via the subcutaneous reservoir port. After 7 weeks of administration (total dose CDDP 370 mg/5-FU 18.5 mg), the main tumor size was effectively reduced. Serum levels of AFP and PIVKA-II decreased markedly. Adverse effects were tolerated. Following the chemoinfusion therapy, posterior segmentectomy and thrombectomy were performed. Reconstruction of the portal vein was not necessary because we removed the tumor thrombus without resecting the portal vein. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient has been doing well more than 2 years after surgery, with no evidence of recurrence or metastasis. Preoperative low-dose CDDP +5-FU intrahepatic arterial infusion therapy in combination with hepatic resection may be an effective treatment for advanced HCC with portal vein tumor thrombus."
CD008201,0,25205532,0,The optimal management of anti-thrombotic therapy after valve replacement: certainties and uncertainties.,"Anti-thrombotic therapy after valve replacement encompasses a number of different situations. Long-term anticoagulation of mechanical prostheses uses vitamin K antagonists with a target international normalized ratio adapted to the characteristics of the prosthesis and the patient. The association of low-dose aspirin is systematic in the American guidelines and more restrictive in the European guidelines. Early heparin therapy is frequently used early after mechanical valve replacement, although there are no precise recommendations regarding timing, type, and dose of drug. Direct oral anticoagulants are presently contraindicated in patients with mechanical prosthesis. The main advantage of bioprostheses is the absence of long-term anticoagulant therapy. Early anticoagulation is indicated after valve replacement for mitral bioprostheses, whereas aspirin is now favoured early after bioprosthetic valve replacement in the aortic position. Early dual antiplatelet therapy is indicated after transcatheter aortic valve implantation, followed by single antiplatelet therapy. However, this relies on low levels of evidence and optimization of anti-thrombotic therapy is warranted in these high-risk patients. Although guidelines are consistent in most instances, discrepancies and the low-level of evidence of certain recommendations highlight the need for further controlled trials, in particular with regard to the combination of antiplatelet therapy with oral anticoagulant and the early post-operative anti-thrombotic therapy following the procedure."

CD008201,0,8010570,0,The management of patients on chronic Coumadin therapy undergoing subsequent surgical procedures.,"Coumadin, a long-acting antagonist of Vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, is commonly used for prevention of thromboembolism and potentially lethal clotting of mechanical heart valves. When patients require surgery for subsequent problems, inadequate perioperative management of coagulation may result in hemorrhage or thrombosis. Reversal with Vitamin K makes subsequent anticoagulation therapy difficult, and normalization of coagulation with fresh frozen plasma exposes the patient to the risk of fatal valvular thrombosis. In addition, third party payers and governmental reimbursement policies discourage most, if not all, preoperative hospitalization. Twenty-one patients on chronic Coumadin therapy required surgery for diseases unrelated to their original need for anticoagulation. Seven patients had hemorrhagic complications, and 14 did not. In these two groups, sex, current operation, reason for anticoagulation, other drugs, admitting CBC, and platelet count were similar. Preoperative hospital days averaged 5.2 days in both groups. Statistically significant differences were noted in age, preoperative Coumadin dose, admitting prothrombin times, and postoperative stays (P = 0.05). Although the perioperative prothrombin times, partial thromboplastin times, and perioperative heparin doses were similar, more patients in the bleeding group were operated with a prothrombin time > 13.0 seconds. The current evolved protocol is to discontinue Coumadin 5 days before surgery, and begin intravenous heparin @ 1000 u/hr with adjustment to keep partial thromboplastin times at therapeutic levels. Heparin is stopped early on the morning of surgery and restarted at 200-400 units/hr at 4 to 6 hours after surgery. Coumadin is restarted as soon as the patient can tolerate it. It is considered safe to operate only when the prothrombin time is less than 13 seconds.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

As is known, there are several dozens of neurologic disorders associated with hearing disorders. By way of example, there is a group of nephropathologies responsible for the loss of hearing in the children. Specifically, hearing impairment can be one of the symptoms of diabetes mellitus. The patients presenting with mucopolysaccharidosis make up a group at risk of hearing impairment. Sensorineural loss of hearing is widespread among the children presenting with coeliac disease. The protocols for the treatment of certain pathologies envisage the application of certain medications possessed of the cytotoxic activity, such as preparations for chemo- and radiotherapy or cytostatic agents that suppress cell proliferation when applied for the management of some autoimmune diseases.

Furthermore, it is 23 years since the first evidence-based guidelines recommended routine use of thromboprophylaxis for most hospitalized patients. However, despite the overwhelming evidence that thromboprophylaxis safely and inexpensively reduces thromboembolic complications associated with acute illness and surgery, there continue to be large gaps in the provision of this key patient safety intervention and even larger gaps in the provision of optimal thromboprophylaxis.

Over the past decade, carotid stenting has emerged as a viable alternative to surgery. Combined with filter embolic protection devices, both a randomized control trial (Stenting and Angioplasty with Protection in Patients at High Risk for Endarterectomy registry [SAPPHIRE]) as well as registry data (ACCULINK for Revascularization of Carotids in High Risk Patients registry [ARCHeR] and Registry Study to evaluate the Neuroshield Bare-Wire Cerebral Protection System and X-Act Stent in patients at high risk for Carotid Endarterectomy [SECuRITY]) have compared favorably to endarterectomy in patients at high risk for operative revascularization. Conditions associated with high operative risk included patients with significant cardiac, pulmonary, and renal disease; previous neck operation; previous radiation; and anatomically difficult surgical access. On the basis of these results, a carotid stent system approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is anticipated in 2004. Although this will be a welcome addition to endarterectomy in the armamentarium of therapeutic options for patients with carotid disease, several challenges lie ahead. Coverage and reimbursement for the carotid stenting has been severely restricted to include only those procedures performed as part of an FDA investigational device exemption trial protocol, and a national noncoverage decision will have to be reckoned with before broader coverage can be put into place (assuming FDA approval). In addition, the level of national expertise in carotid endovascular intervention is limited, and training will need to be tailored to the three specialties likely to perform the procedure: cardiology, radiology, and vascular surgery. Each of these specialties will have specific, and different, requirements for their training, further complicating the task of education."

Major bleeding occurred in 3 patients (4%) receiving enoxaparin; one patient had a life-threatening hemorrhage. Two of the three patients with major bleeding had contraindications to enoxaparin use. Only 45% of our DVT patients were appropriate candidates for outpatient enoxaparin therapy. We conclude that in tertiary-care hospitals with acutely ill patients, most DVT patients will not be candidates for outpatient therapy with enoxaparin. Limitations to enoxaparin use are not widely appreciated."

There is no consensus about what agent to use or what haematologists are doing in clinical practice. A survey was sent to haematologists treating patients with myeloma in Ireland. 32/45 (71%) responded. 13/28 (46%) felt that VTE affected < 5% of patients. However, 8/28 (29%) felt it affected 10-19%. Thromboprophylaxis was most commonly used in patients on lenalidomide; 25/28 (89%) and thalidomide; 23/28 (82%). 23/28 (82%) used LMWH and 20/28 (71%) used aspirin either very frequently or frequently. 3/28 (11%) had used dabigatran/rivaroxaban despite there being little evidence to support their use. Efficacy was the most important factor in choosing an agent for 25/28 (89%). Bleeding was not felt to be an issue 15/29 (52%) were not using thromboprophylaxis guidelines. This survey demonstrated wide variation in the beliefs and practices regarding the burden of VTE in patients with myeloma and the need for thromboprophylaxis."

CD008201,0,23849978,0,Evolution of heparin anticoagulants to ultra-low-molecular-weight heparins: a review of pharmacologic and clinical differences and applications in patients with cancer.,"The burden of venous thromboembolism (VTE) is high in patients with cancer, particularly those with metastatic disease and those receiving chemotherapy. The use of heparin and heparin derivatives should be considered for primary prevention of VTE in hospitalized patients with cancer and in patients undergoing cancer surgery. Preliminary evidence also suggests that heparins may have direct anticancer benefits owing to effects on tumor growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis. Despite the potential benefits of heparin-derived anticoagulants, many at-risk patients do not receive adequate thromboprophylaxis. The evolution of unfractionated heparin to low-molecular-weight and ultra-low-molecular-weight heparins has provided practitioners with alternatives for VTE prevention in cancer, although these alternatives present challenges related to clinically relevant pharmacologic differences between agents. In this review, we present results from our review of the medical literature focusing on the use of the heparin-derived anticoagulants in prospective interventional studies of primary thromboprophylaxis in patients with cancer in surgical, hospitalized, and ambulatory settings."
CD008201,0,16198822,0,"The safety-net story about macrocyclic lactone heartworm preventives: a review, an update, and recommendations.","A number of safe, effective, and convenient heartworm preventatives are currently available for virtually all canine and feline pets. Yet, a 2001 survey of over 18,000 veterinary clinics in the United States identified more than 240,000 dogs and 3000 cats infected with Dirofilaria immitis. This high level of owner compliance failure is alarming. Prolonged administration of some of the macrocyclic lactone (ML) preventatives kills young larvae, older larvae, ""immatures,"" young adults, and/or old adults. Efficacy of 95% or more requires dosing for 9-30 months, with older worms being more difficult to kill. Of the various MLs, ivermectin (IVM) has the most potent safety-net and adulticidal activity, milbemycin oxime has the least, and selamectin and moxidectin injectable lie somewhere in between. The unique effects of IVM are related to the age of the heartworms at initiation of treatment. The earlier treatment is started, the more stunted and smaller the worms and the shorter their survival time. Conversely, the later treatment is started, the longer the worms live, and the more likely the dog will be antigen- and microfilariae-positive. Drug effects do not appear to be enhanced by increasing the dosage or administering at shorter intervals, and it appears that continuous monthly treatment is needed to produce the full effects of the drug. The American Heartworm Society (AHS) recognizes the safety-net (or reach-back effect) and adulticidal properties of some MLs, particularly IVM. The AHS 2003 (American Heartworm Society, 2004. 2003 Updated guidelines for the diagnosis, prevention, and management of heartworm (Dirofilaria immitis) infection in dogs. In: McCall, et al., (Eds.), Proceedings of the Symposium Session on Recent Advances in Heartworm Disease, The 19th International Conference of the World Association for the Advancement of Veterinary Parasitology, New Orleans, LA, 10-14 August, 2003. Vet. Parasitol. 125, 105-130) canine guidelines state that it is beneficial to administer prophylactic doses of IVM before treatment with melarsomine. Results of laboratory studies suggest that less active dogs are at low risk of severe thromboembolism and death. However, heartworm-positive working dogs might be more at risk. Worsened radiographic and echocardiographic images in a client-owned dog given IVM monthly for 2 years with greatly restricted exercise suggests that such treatment of dogs with clinical, radiographic, and/or echocardiographic evidence of heartworm disease as well as for asymptomatic working dogs is contraindicated. Furthermore, until further data are available, such treatment of even the less active asymptomatic dog should be administered only with much caution and with examination by a veterinarian at least once every 4-6 months. IVM clearly provides potent ""safety-net"" activity against older larvae, immatures, and young adults in cases of owner compliance failure, even when the owner and veterinarian are not aware that the animal is infected, and offers much promise as a unique ""soft-kill"" treatment for young, and possibly older adult heartworms, with reduced risks."

Patients with a high rate of complications due to bleeding comprised the first evaluated group. After the causes had been analyzed and eliminated (or reduced), the second group of patients was evaluated. The aim of the study was to ascertain whether risks and complications did not overweight the benefits of Warfarin administration in the prophylaxis of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and whether this combined anticoagulation therapy, which is cheaper than LMWH alone, was generally applicable."
CD008201,0,16475044,0,Anticoagulants in pregnancy.,"Venous thromboembolic (VTE) complications are a leading cause of maternal mortality in the developed world. To reduce the incidence of VTE in pregnancy, and improve outcomes, a wider understanding of the risk factors involved and a better identification of women at risk of thrombosis coupled with effective thromboprophylaxis and treatment of VTE are required. As coumarin is unsuitable for use in pregnancy because of problems with embryopathy and risk of fetal bleeding, anticoagulation therapy in pregnancy centres on the use of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) and unfractionated heparin (UFH). There is now extensive experience of the safety and efficacy of LMWH in pregnancy. LMWH's, such as enoxaparin and dalteparin, have clinical and practical advantages compared with UFH in terms of improved safety (significantly lower incidence of osteoporosis and heparin induced thrombocytopenia), and patient convenience with once daily dosing for the majority of women. Such therapy is not restricted only to prevention and treatment of VTE but is now being assessed in additional clinical situations such as the prevention of pregnancy complications."
CD008201,0,21851895,0,Saphenous vein graft intervention.,"Saphenous vein grafts are commonly used conduits for surgical revascularization of coronary arteries but are associated with poor long-term patency rates. Percutaneous revascularization of saphenous vein grafts is associated with worse clinical outcomes including higher rates of in-stent restenosis, target vessel revascularization, myocardial infarction, and death compared with percutaneous coronary intervention of native coronary arteries. Use of embolic protection devices is a Class I indication according to the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines to decrease the risk of distal embolization, no-reflow, and periprocedural myocardial infarction. Nonetheless, these devices are underused in clinical practice. Various pharmacological agents are available that may also reduce the risk of or mitigate the consequences of no-reflow. Covered stents do not decrease the rates of periprocedural myocardial infarction and restenosis. Most available evidence supports treatment with drug-eluting stents in this high-risk lesion subset to reduce angiographic and clinical restenosis, although large, randomized trials comparing drug-eluting stents and bare-metal stents are needed."

CD008201,0,19021303,0,Current issues in thromboprophylaxis in the elderly.,"The elderly are at particularly high risk for arterial and venous thromboembolism, both of which are associated with significant morbidity and mortality in this age group. However, this age group often receives inadequate thromboprophylaxis because of concerns about bleeding risk, which is often over-estimated, denying patients the benefit of proven antithrombotic regimens. Guidelines advocate active and comprehensive thromboprophylactic strategies across all age groups and recent studies have addressed age considerations in both arterial and venous embolic disorders. Pharmacological thromboprophylaxis has repeatedly been shown to have a favourable risk-benefit profile, including in elderly populations. The benefits of thromboprophylaxis have long been recognized in surgical patients and recent studies have confirmed the safety and efficacy of thromboprophylaxis in medical patients, with most trials having included elderly cohorts. Given the difficulties and inconvenience associated with use of current anticoagulants, new drugs are under development and whilst some have been associated with significant adverse effects, others have demonstrated low bleeding risks without the need for coagulation monitoring. Meanwhile, other new agents currently on the market, such as fondaparinux sodium, have gained license for use in orthopaedic and general surgery patients, although clinical experience with these agents in elderly populations is limited. This article discusses the latest developments and current opinions regarding thromboprophylaxis, with particular emphasis on its relevance to the elderly population."

A 4-year pilot study confirmed the feasibility and value of a registry project in this region, showing a dramatic increase in the use of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) over the study period, associated with a sixfold reduction in the incidence of symptomatic VTE. Data on more than 27,000 patients from the Brazilian Registry have revealed that almost 25% of high-risk patients and 45% of those at moderate risk currently receive no thromboprophylaxis. Among the high-risk patients-in whom general measures alone are not considered appropriate prophylaxis-42% of patients did not receive pharmacological prophylaxis with either LMWH or unfractionated heparin. The Brazilian Registry highlights the need to raise awareness of VTE risk factors and recommended prophylactic regimens in Latin America."
CD008201,0,20458349,0,A need for evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for the use of heparins in the elderly.,"Low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs) have been widely studied in pivotal clinical trials or in several meta-analyses. However, the safety and optimal use of LMWHs in high-risk patients such as the very elderly remains uncertain since these patients are usually excluded from clinical trials. In terms of LMWHs in the elderly, the main concerns are renal failure and the risk of accumulation. A clinical approach consisting of a LMWH dose reduction in the elderly should be considered with great caution in terms of efficacy, since it has been tested neither in the treatment of VTE nor in VTE prophylaxis. If monitoring is considered in patients receiving therapeutic dose LMWHs, appropriate target ranges for peak anti-Xa activity levels should be used and so far, no anti-Xa activity-based guidelines have been issued. Moreover, no data support any laboratory monitoring in elderly patients treated with prophylactic dose LMWHs."
CD008201,0,17148703,0,Prevention of venous thromboembolism in medically ill patients: a clinical update.,"The risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in hospitalised medically ill patients is often underestimated, despite the fact that it remains a major cause of preventable morbidity and mortality in this group. It is not well recognised that the risk of VTE in many hospitalised medically ill patients is at least as high as in populations after surgery. This may partly be attributed to the clinically silent nature of VTE in many patients, and the difficulty in predicting which patients might develop symptoms or fatal pulmonary embolism. Two large studies, Prospective Evaluation of Dalteparin Efficacy for Prevention of VTE in Immobilized Patients Trial and prophylaxis in MEDical patients with ENOXaparin, have shown that low-molecular-weight heparins provide effective thromboprophylaxis in medically ill patients, without increasing bleeding risk. Recent guidelines from the American College of Chest Physicians recommend that acutely medically ill patients admitted with congestive heart failure or severe respiratory disease, or those who are confined to bed and have at least one additional risk factor for VTE, should receive thromboprophylaxis."
CD008201,0,19228604,0,New insights into cancer-associated thrombosis.,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is an increasingly frequent complication of anticancer therapy. The underlying mechanisms are not completely understood, but are related in part to oncogene activation and tissue factor (TF) expression. Several risk factors have been identified including site and stage of cancer, patient comorbidities, and specific therapeutic agents. Candidate biomarkers such as blood counts, TF, and P-selectin have recently been identified. A risk model predictive of chemotherapy-associated VTE has been validated. Thromboprophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), unfractionated heparin (UFH), or fondaparinux is recommended for hospitalized medical and surgical cancer patients. Long-term anticoagulation with LMWH is safe and effective in reducing recurrent VTE in cancer. The role of thromboprophylaxis in ambulatory cancer patients receiving chemotherapy is an area of active investigation."

The primary objective of this multinational survey was to identify patients at risk for VTE, and to define the rate of patients receiving appropriate prophylaxis in the Middle Eastern region. Standardized case report forms were filled by trained individuals on one predefined day in selected hospitals. Data were then entered and analyzed by independent biostatisticians. Risk was categorized according to American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) guidelines, 2004. Logistic regressions were carried out to assess factors that determined VTE prophylaxis. 845 (37%) medical and 1421 (63%) surgical patients were eligible for the study. Patients were at low (4.2%), moderate (51.7%), high (9%) and very high risk (35.2%) for VTE. Any VTE prevention was given in 17.9, 41.7, 60.6 and 66.9% of respective risk categories, while ACCP guidelines were applied in 86.3, 41.1, 48.3 and 24.5% of these categories. Surgical patient type, immobility on admission, and contraceptive use were the most important drivers of VTE prophylaxis in those who were eligible to it (OR ≥ 2). Surgical patient type, immobility during hospitalization, existence of a VTE protocol and chronic heart failure were the most important drivers for VTE prophylaxis application in patients who were not eligible for it (OR ≥ 3). A concordance κ value of 0.16 was found between eligibility for VTE prophylaxis on one hand and its application in practice (P < 0.001). Risk factors for VTE and eligibility for VTE prophylaxis are common, but VTE prophylaxis and guidelines application are low."

CD008201,0,12647491,0,"[Oral anticoagulation treatment--control, risks, benefits, and informed consent].","The most common indications for warfarin therapy are atrial fibrillation, the presence of a mechanical heart valve and venous thromboembolism. The risks and benefits of treatment for these conditions have been fairly well characterized and recent consensus groups have provided guidelines which are nearly identical. Although we can define the recommended range of the PT in INR units, it is often difficult under the best of circumstances to keep the INR in the desired range. Physicians often dont recognize the limitations of INR testing. Furthermore, the continued risk of thromboembolic and bleeding complications despite state of the art treatment might not be recognized by the patient. This places the physician at risk of a malpractice suit and emphasizes the need for informed consent. The following review will summarize current recommendations for the major conditions requiring long-term management with oral anticoagulants, identify problems with PT-INR testing, consider when the laboratory should contact the physician urgently, define acceptable control of the PT-INR during audits, and finally suggest information for the patient, which might be used in an informed consent form."
CD008201,0,8054454,0,Laboratory control of minimal heparinization during haemodialysis in patients with a risk of haemorrhage.,"For patients undergoing dialysis with a high risk of haemorrhage there is no standardized procedure for anticoagulation during extracorporeal circulation. Minimal heparinization with a dose equivalent to half that used for chronic haemodialysis was employed in 49 patients (125 haemodialyses) performed after operative interventions (83.3%), after haemorrhagic events (5.2%) and after invasive investigations (11.5%). Using a biocompatible membrane and a low molecular weight heparin (bolus dose 500-1300 U; continuous infusion 100-400 U) it was possible to complete haemodialysis in 74 cases (Group 0) without clots appearing in the venous bubble trap of the tubing system. In 30 cases (Group 1) only small clots were detected at the end of haemodialysis, and in 13 cases (Group 2) larger clots (exceeding a diameter of 1 cm) were found. In eight cases (Group 3) partial or complete clot formation occurred in the tubing. No haemorrhagic complications were observed. Anti-Xa activity, thrombin-antithrombin III complex (TAT) and D-dimer were determined before haemodialysis, 2 h after the start of haemodialysis and on completion of the procedure. The anti-Xa activities ranged between < 0.2 and 0.56 U/ml. In contrast, at 2 h there were significant differences (P < 0.05) in the TAT concentrations between Group 0 and the other groups, as well as between Group 1 and Group 2 and 3. Significant differences (P < 0.05) in D-dimer levels occurred only at the end of haemodialysis. Minimal heparinization in haemodialysis is a practicable alternative in patients with a high risk of haemorrhage and extended coagulation monitoring is helpful in adjusting heparin dosage."
CD008201,0,27264252,0,Thrombolysis of Acute Arterial Occlusion with rt-PA.,"The use of thrombolytic agents to treat peripheral arterial occlusions is a new method. Despite its advantages, information about complications caused by the use of rt-PA and about its place in treatment is still incomplete. The aim of this study was to establish a dose range for rt-PA and to follow the patients with a protocol during and after thrombolysis. Between May 1999 to January 2000, 14 patients with symptoms of peripheral arterial occlusion came to Istanbul Medical Faculty Emergency Surgery Unit. The duration of ischaemia before their hospitalization took an average of 44 hours. (Range 3 hours-7 days). A pulse-spray catheter was directed to the thrombus under angiographic control. Bolus injection of 5 mg of rt-PA was followed by 15 minutes of interval. The extent of thrombolysis was checked by angiography and then bolus injection of 5 mg of rt- PA was repeated. After angiographic control, patients having insufficient thrombolysis, received 0.05 mg/kg/hour of infusion for 12 hours. At the end of 12 hours, thrombolytic treatment ended with a control angiography. A thromboembolectomy operation was made to patients still having an occlusion after thrombolysis. To avoid re-occlusions, all of the patients received 1.5 mg/kg/day low molecular weight heparin (enoxaparin) for 1 week. At the end of thrombolysis, 9 patients had complete lysis. A patient, having an occlusion in superior mesenteric artery had 60% recanalisation. 2 patients (14%) having 90% stenosis, needed a balloon angioplasty besides thrombolysis, and both of them had complete reperfusion. 2 patients (14%) needed a thromboembolectomy operation due to insufficient thrombolysis. 2 patients (14%) had a minor bleeding after thrombolytic treatment. After thrombolysis, 2 patients (14%) had a stroke. There were no amputations. 1 of the patients having a stroke, died 2 days after thrombolytic treatment 1 patient died due to myocardial infarction during thrombolysis. 1 patient (7%) died due to diabetic coma on the 20th day. Acute myocardial infarction was the cause of death in 1 patient on the 25th day. In conclusion pulse spray thrombolysis with rt-PA is safe and efficient. Moreover there is a reduction in complications and need for surgical procedure. The recent problem is to find the optimum dosages for the best thrombolysis and for least complications."
CD008201,0,20005052,0,Prophylactic topical heparin can prevent or postpone intravenous cannula induced superficial thrombophlebitis.,"Intravenous cannulation is a cornerstone of today's medical practice. Maintaining a single indwelling intravenous (IV) cannula for long duration is limited by the development of superficial thrombophlebitis (ST). It is a self limiting inflammation and thrombosis of superficial veins. ST presents with fever, pain, erythema, tenderness and cord like swelling. The incidence of ST is high and usually occurs within 72h of IV cannula insertion. The current standard medical therapy for ST is topical heparin application for 7 days. Heparin acts by preventing coagulation rather than lysing a formed clot. So, if topical heparin is started prophylactically even before ST sets in, i.e. from day 1 of IV cannula insertion it can prevent or postpone ST more effectively. It increases the indwelling time of a single IV cannula and can be very useful in high risk groups requiring IV cannulation like patients receiving cancer chemotherapy, ICU patients and infants. It decreases the need for recurrent cannulations and associated morbidity thereby improving patient compliance. It also prevents extended hospital stay due to ST and related complications. High incidence of ST justifies the use of prophylactic topical heparin with all IV cannulations. Prophylaxis will be better than treatment in managing patients with IV cannulas."
CD008201,0,22734929,0,Duration of anticoagulant therapy for venous thromboembolism: balancing benefits and harms on the long term.,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is effectively treated with anticoagulant therapy. After an initial treatment phase, extended treatment is effective to prevent recurrence after a first event but this is at the expense of a continued risk of bleeding. Ideally, patients at a high risk of recurrence and low risk of bleeding continue anticoagulant therapy, and for those at low risk of recurrence the duration of treatment can be limited. Identifying these patients, however, is difficult. Duration of treatment after a first VTE provoked by a transient risk factor should be limited to 3 months. Although guidelines suggest extended treatment for all patients after unprovoked VTE unless bleeding risk is high, we emphasize that the long-term risks of recurrent VTE off anticoagulation are uncertain whereas the risk of bleeding associated with anticoagulant therapy increases with age. In the absence of evidence of replaced mortality or improved quality of life with extended anticoagulant treatment, we suggest a limited duration for most patients after a first VTE. Extended treatment can be considered, based mainly on patient preference."

The recommended pharmacologic treatment options for thromboprophylaxis after major orthopedic surgery include the vitamin K antagonists (VKAs eg, warfarin), low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs; eg, enoxaparin) and the synthetic pentasaccharide fondaparinux. Most clinics use some kind of thromboprophylaxis routinely. However, due to the frequent need for coagulation monitoring (VKAs) and subcutaneous injections (LMWHs and fondaparinux) barriers exist to prescribing prophylaxis after discharge from hospital. Targeting specific components of the coagulation cascade has yielded several new antithrombotic agents for use as thromboprophylaxis after THA or TKA. Two of these, dabigatran etexilate and rivaroxaban, have already reached the markets in the European Union member states and Canada. Both are administered by the oral route, once-daily fixed dose and without the need to monitor the anticoagulant effect. Whether these new drugs facilitate guideline adherence, particularly in the outpatient settings and thereby improve the overall clinical outcomes remains to be shown."

Risk factors for VTE in amputees include advanced age, sedentary lifestyle, longstanding arterial disease and an identifiable hypercoagulable condition. Evidence suggests that pharmacological prophylaxis (for example heparin, factor Xa inhibitors, vitamin K antagonists, direct thrombin inhibitors, antiplatelets) is effective in preventing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) but it is associated with an increased risk of bleeding. Mechanical prophylaxis (for example antiembolism stockings, intermittent pneumatic compression and foot impulse devices), on the other hand, is non-invasive and has no side effects. However, it is not always appropriate in patients with contraindications such as peripheral arterial disease (PAD), arteriosclerosis or bilateral lower limb amputations.

A practical guide to thromboprophylaxis in the treatment of urinary tract lithiasis has not yet been established. Patients can be stratified according to levels of risk of arterial and venous thromboembolism, which influence the requirements for antiplatelet and anticoagulant medications, respectively. Patients should also be stratified according to their risk of bleeding. Consideration of the combined risks of bleeding and thromboembolism should determine the perioperative thromboprophylactic strategy. The choice of shockwave lithotripsy, percutaneous nephrolithotomy or ureteroscopy with laser lithotripsy for treatment of lithiasis should be determined with regard to these risks. Although ureteroscopy is the preferred method in high-risk patients, shockwave lithotripsy and percutaneous nephrolithotomy can be chosen when indicated, if appropriate guidelines are strictly followed."

CD008201,0,15918665,0,[Pregnancy-associated venous thrombosis in women with hereditary heterozygous factor V Leiden and/or factor II gene mutations].,"The risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in pregnant women with heterozygous factor V Leiden and/or heterozygous factor II 20210A gene mutations is poorly documented, and the need for prophylaxis is therefore controversial. We retrospectively studied 208 women with hereditary thrombophilia (heterozygous FV Leiden and/or factor II gene mutations), who had a total of 406 full-term pregnancies, including 10 with thromboprophylaxis. The ante- and post-partum incidence of VTE was significantly higher in women with both mutations (17.8 %) than in women with FII gene mutation alone (6.2%) p = 0.003. In contrast, there was no significant difference between women with FV+FII mutation and those with FV mutations alone (10%). Thus, the two most common hereditary risk factors for thrombophilia seem to have an additive rather than a synergistic effect on the antepartum/post-partum risk of VTE. In contrast, a previous history of VTE before pregnancy in women with both the FV and the FII gene mutations was associated with a very high risk of VTE (50%). The incidence of VTE was higher during the post-partum period than the ante-partum period. There was no significant difference in the incidence of fetal loss in the three groups, but this was not a primary endpoint. These results, obtained in a single center, have implications for VTE prophylaxis. Routine use of LMWH is not indicated during pregnancy in asymptomatic women with a single mutation. In contrast, it is justified throughout pregnancy in women with both mutations and a history of venous thrombosis. Regarding asymptomatic women with both mutations, the need for prophylaxis during part or all of the pregnancy should be weighed up on an individual basis. In the post-partum period, there is a consensus on the use of LMWH for 6 weeks in women with single or dual mutations associated with thrombophilia."

CD008201,0,23589336,0,Defining the role of high-dose statins in PCI.,"Several studies have reported a significant reduction in morbidity and mortality in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or in patients with stable ischemic heart disease with the use of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins). Based on these findings, current guidelines recommend the use of statin therapy before hospital discharge for all patients with ACS regardless of the baseline low-density lipoprotein level. Statins are also recommended to patients at high risk for cardiovascular disease. Statins have been introduced in the clinical arena to reduce the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level that is associated with coronary atherosclerosis; however, a growing body of evidence suggests that other mechanisms of action beyond the modification of the lipid profile may come into action. In particular, statins exert antiinflammatory effects, modulate endothelial function, and inhibit the thrombotic signaling cascade. All together the non-LDL cholesterol-lowering effects of statins are called pleiotropic effects. In this article we will review the evidence supporting the use of high-dose statins in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention, and we will also attempt to highlight the possible mechanisms of action."
CD008201,0,17378769,0,Evaluation and management of atrial fibrillation.,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common clinically encountered arrhythmia affecting 0.4% of the general population. Its prevalence increases with age, affecting more than 6% of people over 80 years of age. The annual risk of ischemic stroke in patients with lone AF is approximately 1.3%. This annual risk increases up to 10% -12% in patients with a prior stroke or transient ischemic attack. Randomized clinical trials (RCT) comparing adjusted-dose oral anticoagulation and placebo showed a risk reduction of 61% (95% CI 47% to 71%). The absolute risk reduction for stroke with oral anticoagulants is about 3% per year. Aspirin has been shown in meta-analyses to have on average a 20-25% relative risk reduction, and is inferior to oral anticoagulants. In high risk patients with AF warfarin is a class I ACC/AHA indication unless there is a contraindication for anticoagulation. Unfortunately, this therapy requires frequent monitoring with blood samples and the interaction with food and several medications makes its use difficult and sometimes unreliable. It requires strict patient compliance and its use is also linked to potentially serious bleeding complications. In clinical practice, less than 60% of patients who do not have contraindications to oral anticoagulation are actually receiving them. Additionally, of those that receive oral anticoagulation, less than 50% are consistently within therapeutic targets. As such, the ""real world"" efficacy of a strategy towards prescribing oral anticoagulants is likely significantly lower than that demonstrated in clinical trials. As such, the need to discover other methods of anticoagulation with oral bioavailability, predictable pharmacokinetics, and minimal interactions with diet and other pharmacological agents is imperative. Low molecular weight heparin has a more predictable bioavailability and a longer half-life, but its subcutaneous mode of administration and long-term risks, in particular, osteoporosis makes the chronic use of this medication non-feasible. Antiplatelet agents such as clopidogrel have proven efficacy and superiority compared to aspirin to prevent systemic vascular events in at-risk patient populations, but currently they do not play an important role in the prevention of AF related thromboembolic events. The ACTIVE study is a randomized trial comparing the combination of clopidogrel and aspirin therapy to oral anticoagulation with warfarin in patients with AF, and was unfortunately terminated prematurely by the data safety and monitoring board because of increased events in the antiplatelet arm. Direct thrombin inhibitors, such as ximelagatran, may be as effective as warfarin for stroke-risk reduction in patients with AF. No anticoagulation monitoring is needed and it has excellent bioavailability, with a twice-daily oral dose. Elevation of liver enzymes was an initial concern regarding the use of this new drug, which is not available for general use. Ongoing pharmacological research and future clinical trials may one day leave the ""warfarin days"" behind. Unfortunately, the new therapies that are being tested seem to be at least several years away from being available on a widespread basis. In this review, we discuss the underlying pathophysiology of AF and stroke. We also provide a comprehensive discussion regarding various available therapies to treat AF."
CD008201,0,19903186,0,Bridging of chronic oral anticoagulation with enoxaparin in patients with atrial fibrillation: results from the prospective BRAVE registry.,"Current American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) guidelines on the perioperative management of oral anticoagulation (OAC) suggest bridging therapy with therapeutic doses of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) if at high or moderate thromboembolic (TE) risk, and with reduced doses in patients with low TE risk. Our objective was to assess the efficacy and safety of bridging OAC with enoxaparin in AF patients. These are the results of an open, prospective monocenter register. Hospitalized and ambulatory patients with AF requiring bridging therapy at high or moderate TE risk and normal renal function were treated with therapeutic LMWH doses; all other patients received reduced doses. A total of 703 patients were enrolled, of whom 358 (50.9%) were at moderate-to-high and 345 (49.1%) at low TE risk. Renal impairment was detected in 308 patients (43.8%). One hundred ninety patients (27.1%) were treated with therapeutic LMWH doses and 513 (72.9%) with reduced doses. No TE events were observed during the follow-up period (0%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.0-0.52). Three major bleeds (0.4%; 0.1-1.2) and 60 minor bleeds were noted (8.9%; 6.6-10.9). Age and total LMWH doses were risk factors for bleeding in the multivariate analysis. The study, under conditions of everyday clinical care, supports a predefined bridging regimen based on the individual patient's TE risk and renal function. Patients with low TE risk or with impaired renal function can be bridged effectively and safely with reduced LMWH doses."

CD008201,0,21740079,0,Role of emerging antithrombotic therapy in the prevention of cardioembolic complications in patients with atrial fibrillation.,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia and is an independent risk factor of potentially catastrophic cardioembolic strokes. AF patients are categorized into high-, intermediate-, and low-risk for thromboembolic complications using the CHADS(2) or CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc scoring system. Oral anticoagulation using warfarin has been the standard therapy for stroke prevention in intermediate- to high-risk AF patients. However, warfarin use has been limited by several factors such as narrow therapeutic windows, drug-drug and drug-food interactions, and hemorrhagic complications. Rigorous research evaluated dual antiplatelet therapy of clopidogrel and aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) as a potential alternative to warfarin in the ACTIVE W trial. Dual antiplatelet therapy of clopidogrel and aspirin was found to be inferior to warfarin in preventing stroke and systemic embolism with increased bleeding risk. Other extensive research has led to the development of new antithrombotic agents. Recently, dabigatran etexilate 150 mg twice daily, a direct thrombin inhibitor, was approved by the US FDA for stroke prevention in patients with non-valvular AF after it was found to be superior to warfarin in preventing thromboembolic events and associated with less bleeding in the RE-LY trial. It was also cost effective when compared with warfarin. Dabigatran can be considered in high-risk AF patients who are unable or unwilling to comply with the frequent laboratory and clinic visits that are required when receiving treatment with warfarin. Factor Xa inhibitors are another class of new anticoagulants that have been developed. Oral rivaroxaban was non-inferior to warfarin in thromboprophylaxis and with similar bleeding in the ROCKET-AF trial (HR 0.88; p = 0.117). Apixaban, another factor Xa inhibitor, was superior to aspirin in reducing stroke and systemic embolism in patients with AF in the AVERROES trial (HR 0.45; p < 0.001). The results of the ARISTOTLE trial, which is evaluating apixaban against warfarin in ∼18 000 patients with AF, are expected to be available later this year. Edoxaban, another oral factor Xa inhibitor, is currently being evaluated against warfarin in the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 trial in ∼20 000 patients with AF. With these new developments, there is a necessity for the clinical practitioner to become familiar with these new and upcoming therapies and guidelines. This review provides an overview of the available data regarding the clinical usefulness of these agents."

However, there is little information about its usefulness for predicting the long-term risk of ischemic stroke in Japanese patients with paroxysmal AF. We retrospectively evaluated the incidence of ischemic stroke and the efficacy of anticoagulant therapy in paroxysmal AF patients on rhythm control therapy who were stratified by their CHADS2 score. The subjects were 334 NVAF atients (229 men and 105 women, mean age, 68 +/- 12 years, mean follow-up period, 60 +/- 35 months) who were categorized into low risk (score 0), moderate risk (1 or 2), and high risk (3 or more) groups for thromboembolism. The low, moderate, and high risk groups accounted for 34%, 50%, and 16% of the patients, respectively. Among 257 patients without warfarin therapy, the annual rate of symptomatic ischemic stroke was 0.6% in the score 0 group, 0.5% in the score 1 group, 3.1% in the score 2 group, and 9.6% in the score 3 or more group. Among 77 patients treated with warfarin (target PT-INR: 1.6-3.0), the stroke rate was 0% in the score 0 group, 0% in the score 1 group, 1.4% in the score 2 group, and 6.6% in the score 3 or more group. The annual rate of ischemic stroke was 0.88% in patients treated with warfarin versus 2.67% in those without warfarin, or a decrease in risk of 68% with warfarin (P < 0.01). In Japanese patients with paroxysmal AF, the CHADS2 score is useful for predicting the risk of ischemic stroke. Anticoagulant therapy is needed to prevent ischemic stroke in patients with paroxysmal AF, especially those who have a CHADS2 score of 2 or more."

Their findings suggest potential benefit, but with significant variation in underlying risk. A risk-adapted approach that incorporates risk of thrombosis, risk of bleeding, and patient preference can target high-risk patients and also allow low-risk patients to avoid prophylaxis.

CD008201,0,20083908,0,Epidemiology of thrombotic risk factors: the difficulty in using clinical trials to develop a risk assessment model.,"There is a paucity of data assessing the risks and prevention of venous thromboembolism in critical care settings. Consequently, it is difficult to estimate the risk of venous thromboembolism for a typical patient, on an individual basis, and this difficulty leads to underuse of thromboprophylaxis, especially in intensive care unit patients. Thrombosis is a multifactorial disease and patients may present multiple risk factors simultaneously. The problem in quantifying risk factors is to combine these risk factors even when they are not detected in the same multivariate analysis. A model for predicting the risk of venous thromboembolism in hospitalized medical patients has yet to be developed and validated. Meanwhile, other approaches have been proposed to replace the ideal study utilizing a large prospective cohort of hospitalized medical patients. In this context, several scoring systems based on risk assessment models have been proposed, some including the use of computerized electronic prompts, to help physicians prescribe appropriate prophylaxis.

CD008201,0,11194957,0,[Cancer of the breast: results and toxicity of locoregional irradiation after mastectomy].,"The locoregional control is a crucial step in the achievement of a cancer cure. After mastectomy, the locoregional irradiation clearly reduces the chest wall and nodal relapses, especially with initial lesions more than 5 cm or with nodal involvement and/or large lymphatic or vascular emboli. Two recent randomized trials confirmed the benefit of well-adapted locoregional irradiation. In the Danish trial, including premenopausal ""high-risk"" women treated by mastectomy and chemotherapy (CMF protocol), the radiotherapy reduced the locoregional relapses from 32 to 9% (P < 0.001) and increased the 10-year survival rates from 45 to 54% (P < 0.001). These results are now also confirmed in a postmenopausal group, with an increased 10-year survival rate of 36 to 45% (P < 0.001). In the Canadian trial, locoregional relapse rate decreased from 25 to 13% and 10-year survival rate increased from 56 to 65%. The meta-analysis published in 1995 by the Early Breast Cancer Trialist Collaborative Group (EBCTCG) showed only a modest benefit due to locoregional irradiation in breast cancer. However, when small trials and older trials started before 1970 are excluded due to imperfect methodologies and for inadequate irradiation techniques, the benefit of the ""modern"" radiotherapy appears significant in the 7,840 patients selected in this way. Thus, since the locoregional irradiation can avoid some metastatic evolutions developed only after ""local"" or ""nodal"" relapse, it must be integrated in a multidisciplinary strategy. Nevertheless, this treatment must be safe and this is possible by the use of new techniques, including the definition of anatomical volumes and previsional dosimetry. The most important point concerns the treatment of the internal mammary nodes, especially when previous chemotherapy including anthracyclines was performed. The use of a direct field, with at least 40% of the dose delivered by electrons in an alternating scheme, is recommended to ensure very good protection of the heart and lungs."

CD008201,0,9031446,0,Thromboprophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin (Fragmin) in high risk pregnancies.,"Venous thromboembolic disease remains the commonest cause of maternal death. The management of thromboprophylaxis in high risk women during pregnancy is contentious. Low molecular weight heparins (LMW) have theoretical advantages compared with unfractionated heparin and warfarin but have been poorly studied in pregnancy. We report on the use of LMW heparin (Fragmin) as thromboprophylaxis in thirty four high risk pregnancies. All the women had a previous thrombosis or a thrombosis in their current pregnancy +/- a recognised thrombophilic state (eleven had the antiphospholipid syndrome). Fragmin was given subcutaneously to maintain trough anti-Xa activity of 0.15-0.2 U/ml and 2 h post injection levels of 0.4-0.6 U/ml. The levels were checked monthly during pregnancy. Most women required 5,000U Fragmin once daily during the first trimester unless they were greater than 100 kg at the start of pregnancy. The mean time for dosage increase was 20.5 week (S.D. 8.2). 26/34 pregnancies (76%) required 5,000 twice daily at the end of pregnancy. Epidural anaesthesia was managed by omitting Fragmin dose or inserting the needle 6 hours after the previous Fragmin injection. There were no thromboembolic events thrombocytopenias or excessive haemorrhage. One woman had osteoporotic vertebral collapse post partum, she had no other risk factors for osteoporosis. LWM heparin (Fragmin) appears to be efficacious in preventing recurrent thromboembolic disease in pregnant women at high risk, but it is notable that osteoporotic fractures occurred post partum in one woman. Further trials are required to determine optimal dosage and safety."

Initial treatment is directed at controlling the ventricular rate, most often with a calcium channel blocker, a beta blocker, or digoxin. Medical or electrical cardioversion to restore sinus rhythm is the next step in patients who remain in atrial fibrillation. Heparin should be administered to hospitalized patients undergoing medical or electrical cardioversion.

CD008201,0,18481820,0,Clinical considerations with the use of antiplatelet therapy in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention.,"Despite the proven benefits of using antiplatelet therapy in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), a number of key questions remain to be answered. In recent years, clopidogrel dosing strategies among such patients have evolved considerably, with newer approaches involving loading doses prior to PCI and increases in the time interval and loading dosage in an effort to overcome variable responsiveness/hyporesponsiveness to platelet inhibition. Further, the role of glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa antagonists in elective stenting continues to be defined, with recent evidence suggesting that most appropriate use of these agents is in high-risk patients with elevated troponin levels. There appears to be a relationship between the use of GP IIb/IIIa antagonists with clopidogrel loading and attenuation of early inflammatory and cardiac marker release. Strategies to minimize the chance of late stent thrombosis in patients who receive drug-eluting stents (DES) are also under intense investigation. Among some patients receiving sirolimus and paclitaxel DES, current standard long-term antiplatelet strategies may be insufficient. Patient nonadherence to treatment and premature discontinuation and underutilization of antiplatelet therapies by physicians remain important clinical problems with potentially dire consequences."

CD008201,0,19400530,0,Valvular heart disease in pregnancy: a review of the literature.,"The population of pregnant women with valvular heart disease represents a unique patient group with increased risk for adverse outcomes. The significant hemodynamic changes that occur during pregnancy can mimic symptoms of congestive heart failure. Furthermore, many patients with valvular heart disease are first recognized during pregnancy. Pre-pregnancy intervention is of utmost importance in high-risk women who present for evaluation before a planned pregnancy. This is more so if the valvular lesion is amenable for percutaneous intervention or repair, without replacement. Besides management during the antepartal period, timing and mode of delivery should be decided upon jointly by the obstetrician, cardiologist, and obstetric anesthesiologist. Prosthetic mechanical valves which require anticoagulation present a high risk subset of patients. The American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology Task Force recommends continuous therapeutic anticoagulation with frequent monitoring. Warfarin and Heparin have been recommended. Low molecular weight heparin is not recommended to be administered to pregnant patients with mechanical prosthetic valves unless anti-Xa levels are monitored 4 to 6 h after administration. Aspirin at low doses, 81-325 mg has been proposed to reduce the risk of thrombosis. At this moment, optimal antithrombotic therapy in pregnant women with mechanical valves cannot be definitively recommended due to lack of properly designed studies."
CD008201,0,17501878,0,Mechanical compression in the prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism.,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in a substantial number of the Australian community. There exists a considerable range of potential prophylactic measures aimed at reducing the risk of VTE. These antithrombotic regimens include pharmacological interventions and mechanical techniques to counteract venous stasis including graduated compression stockings and intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) devices. This review particularly concentrates on evidence for the use of mechanical prophylaxis and the interrelationship with pharmacological methods of VTE prophylaxis. Mechanical and pharmacological methods of VTE prophylaxis are both effective and when used in combination have synergistic effects. Although there are a number of different IPC systems, little evidence is available at present that differentiates these on the basis of VTE prevention. Compliance and patient acceptance of IPC as a preventative measure has improved with miniaturization and device weight reduction. IPC should be used according to recommended guidelines. In moderate-risk patients when pharmacological prophylaxis is contraindicated, IPC can be used as an alternative. High-risk patients should receive both mechanical and pharmacological prophylaxis to reduce their relative risk. Until further evidence becomes available, the specific type of IPC unit chosen will generally be determined by ease of use, availability and cost."

CD008201,0,23991742,0,Assessing the risk and prognosis of thrombotic complications in cancer patients.,"Cancer is characterized by the development of a prothrombotic state. Approximately 15% to 20% and 1.5% to 3.1% of cancer patients develop venous and arterial thrombosis, respectively, whereas 18% to 20% of idiopathic venous events are caused by an occult neoplasia. The highest risk is observed in hematologic, gastrointestinal, and lung malignancies, as well as in patients with active disease, especially in the first 3 months after cancer diagnosis. Hospitalization, surgical interventions, and implanted venous devices increase the thrombotic risk. Patients with metastatic disease, febrile neutropenia, infections, and severe comorbidities experience more frequently a thrombotic event. A contemporary prechemotherapy predictive model incorporates both clinical and biologic parameters, such as the primary cancer site, platelet count, white blood cell count, hemoglobin, use of erythropoietic agents, and body mass index.

CD008201,0,21425133,0,Venous thromboembolism in the patient with cancer: focus on burden of disease and benefits of thromboprophylaxis.,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with cancer. The risk of VTE varies over the natural history of cancer, with the highest risk occurring during hospitalization and after disease recurrence. Patient and disease characteristics are associated with further increased risk of VTE in this setting. Specific factors include cancer type (eg, pancreatic cancer, brain cancer, lymphoma) and the presence of metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis. VTE is a significant predictor of increased mortality during the first year among all types and stages of cancer, with metastatic disease reported to be the strongest predictor of mortality. VTE is also associated with early death in ambulatory patients with cancer. These data highlight the need for close monitoring, prompt treatment, and appropriate preventive strategies for VTE in patients with cancer. The American Society of Clinical Oncology and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network have issued guidelines regarding the prophylaxis and treatment of patients with cancer. This review summarizes the impact of VTE on patients with cancer, the effects of VTE on clinical outcomes, the importance of thromboprophylaxis in this population, relevant ongoing clinical trials examining the prevention of VTE, and new pharmacologic treatment options."
CD008201,0,21715725,0,Risk assessment and prophylaxis for VTE in cancer patients.,"The frequency of venous thromboembolism (VTE) is rising in patients with cancer. VTE contributes to mortality and morbidity, but the risk for VTE can vary widely between individual patients. Clinical risk factors for VTE in cancer include primary site of cancer, use of systemic therapy, surgery, and hospitalization. Biomarkers predictive of VTE include platelet and leukocyte counts, hemoglobin, D-dimer, and tissue factor. A recently validated risk model incorporates 5 easily available variables and can be used clinically to identify patients at increased risk of VTE. In high-risk settings, including surgery and hospitalization, thromboprophylaxis with either unfractionated heparin or low-molecular-weight heparins has been shown to be safe and effective. Recent studies have also suggested a potential benefit for thromboprophylaxis in the ambulatory setting, although criteria for selecting patients for prophylaxis are not currently well defined. This article focuses on recent and ongoing studies of risk assessment and prophylaxis in patients with cancer."
CD008201,0,26733330,0,Unseen but present danger: improving the safe prescribing of anti-embolism stockings (AES).,"A strong evidence base exists supporting thromboprophylaxis for venous thromboembolism (VTE) in surgical patients. Given the ageing population, obesity epidemic, and rise in type 2 diabetes, VTE and peripheral vascular disease (PAD) are likely to become an escalating problem. PAD is a contraindication to the use of anti-embolism stockings (AES). Half of those patients diagnosed with PAD report no symptoms, potentially underestimating its prevalence. Implementation of guidelines for thromboprophylaxis, including the safe prescribing of AES, is therefore imperative. The aims of this project were to establish whether thromboprophylaxis was being prescribed correctly, and appropriately, to all surgical inpatients. This included documented evidence that peripheral pulses had been examined - and, in the case of diabetic patients, that there was documentation of full peripheral neurovascular examination - before AES were prescribed. Data were collected from case notes of all surgical inpatients. Foundation year 1 doctors (FY1s) completed a questionnaire assessing their knowledge of local guidelines. Teaching sessions and posters summarising local guidelines were delivered to FY1s. Appropriate pharmacological prescribing improved from 57.69% to 100%. AES were appropriately prescribed for 65.38% of patients. Post intervention this increased to 79.17%. 0% had documented peripheral neurovascular examination. This increased to 50% post intervention."

Herein, we describe the prevalence, incidence, risk factors, clinical consequences, prophylaxis against venous thromboembolism in critically ill patients, and compliance with thromboprophylaxis. We focus primarily on medical-surgical intensive care unit patients, who represent the largest subgroup of critically ill patients. Despite the large and growing number of critically ill patients in our aging society, their high risk for venous thromboembolism, and the morbidity and mortality associated with this complication of critical illness, relatively few rigorous studies are available. Large, well-designed, randomized trials of thromboprophylaxis, powered to detect differences in patient-important outcomes, are required to advance our understanding and care of these vulnerable patients. Furthermore, because thromboprophylaxis is a common error of omission in hospitalized patients, redoubled efforts are needed to ensure that it is used in practice."
CD008201,0,23118625,0,Utility of anti-xa monitoring in children receiving enoxaparin for therapeutic anticoagulation.,"Although enoxaparin is used to treat thromboembolism in children, current treatment guidelines are largely extrapolated from adults. The objectives of this study were to determine: i) correlation between enoxaparin dose and anti-factor Xa (anti-Xa) level, ii) intra-patient variability, and iii) whether dose or anti-Xa level is a predictor of outcomes. A retrospective chart review was conducted on all hospitalized patients receiving enoxaparin in a tertiary care pediatric institution. Simple linear regression, coefficient of variation (CV), and Student's t-test were used to analyze the objectives. Eighty treatment courses with interpretable anti-Xa levels were analyzed. Mean patient age was 6.5 years. Mean enoxaparin dose was 1.10 mg/kg q12h. Correlation between initial dosing and anti-Xa level was poor; R(2) = 0.0307 and 0.0237 for patients > 2 months with and without cardiac or renal diseases, respectively. Four out of seven patients ≤ 2 months of age compared to 4/32 patients > 2 months had a CV > 40%. Similarly, 4/12 cardiac patients compared to 4/27 non-cardiac patients had a CV > 40%. Neither dose nor anti-Xa level predicted treatment success or adverse reactions (P > .05). These results suggest a need to reexamine the use of anti-Xa levels for guiding enoxaparin therapy. Further prospective studies are warranted to clarify whether routine or selective anti-Xa monitoring should be recommended in pediatric patients."
CD008201,0,16966122,0,Low-molecular-weight heparin for thromboprophylaxis in pregnant women with mechanical heart valves.,"Pregnancy in a woman with a mechanical heart valve is a life-threatening situation. Due to the inability of unfractionated heparin to prevent valvular thromboses, warfarin or other vitamin K antagonists have been the preferred anticoagulants for the mother. They are, however, potentially harmful to the fetus. With the advent of low-molecular-weight heparins, clinicians were hopeful for an alternative that was safe for the fetus, but more effective than unfractionated heparin, which carries a 29-33% risk of life-threatening thromboses and a 7-15% chance of mortality. Unfortunately, fatal thromboses have occurred with low-molecular-weight heparin as well."
CD008201,0,10493229,0,Matching risk with treatment strategies in deep vein thrombosis management.,"Successful and cost-effective prophylaxis against venous thromboembolism (VTE) depends on the availability of safe and effective antithrombotic methods, and the ability to match these to patients according to their level of thromboembolic risk. The last 20 years have seen significant developments in methods of thromboprophylaxis but, despite use of the best available methods, VTE still occurs in a significant proportion of patients. Efforts are now focused both on developing more effective pharmacological and physical methods, and improving assessment of thromboembolic risk in clinical practice, with the goal of avoiding unnecessary prophylaxis in low-risk patients and providing enhanced protection to high-risk patients. Factors known to exert a direct effect on thromboembolic risk include previous VTE, advancing age, surgery, malignancy, immobility, and the presence of thrombophilic states. Other less well-defined risk factors include obesity, pregnancy, and leg varicosities. Various risk assessment models (RAMs) have been devised based on these factors, but most of the resulting risk assessment formulae, some of them based on laboratory test results, have been too complicated to gain acceptance in routine clinical practice. Reflecting the need to refine the use of thromboprophylaxis in clinical practice, a number of RAMs have been developed recently, based on epidemiological evidence. Some models include specific recommendations for prophylaxis, based on evidence from randomized, controlled trials."

The protocol (designed by Fennerty et al., has two aims: (a) to move the prothrombin time (PT) ratio smoothly and quickly into its therapeutic range, and (b) to predict the steady-state warfarin requirement from the PT ratio measured on the fourth treatment day. It proved simple to use and reasonably successful, since after four days, 67/100 patients had achieved a therapeutic level of PT ratio, nine exceeded the therapeutic range, and 24 remained sub-therapeutic, while none had bled due to excessive anticoagulation. Maintenance dose prediction was tested by comparing the predicted and observed maintenance doses in patients within the 'therapeutic range' of PT ratio after various median times of treatment. After ten days, the observed dose was within 1 mg of that predicted in 65/86 patients (76%). This proportion became 57/77 (74%) after 18 days, and 49/79 (62%) after 34 days."
CD008201,0,20620709,0,Risk factors for venous thromboembolism.,"Risk factors for venous thromboembolism (VTE) are often modifiable and overlap with risk factors for coronary artery disease. Encouraging our patients to adopt a heart-healthy lifestyle by abstaining from cigarettes, maintaining lean weight, limiting red meat intake, and controlling hypertension might lower the risk of pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis (DVT), although a cause-effect relationship has not been firmly established. For hospitalized patients, guidelines have provided evidence-based strategies to identify patients at risk, such as elderly persons and those with cancer, congestive heart failure, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or undergoing major surgery. Most should receive pharmacological prophylaxis, which will minimize the risk of VTE. Because approximately 3 of every 4 pulmonary embolism and DVT events occur outside the hospital setting, patients should also be assessed for persistent high-risk of VTE at the time of hospital discharge."

Additionally, the presence of noncardiac issues may have a significant impact on outcomes and the patient experience during and following an intensive care unit stay. This review focuses on three common noncardiac areas which impact outcomes and patient experience in and beyond the CICU: feeding and growth, pain and analgesia, and anticoagulation. Growth failure and feeding dysfunction are commonly encountered in infants requiring cardiac surgery and have been associated with worse surgical and developmental outcomes. Recent studies most notably in the single ventricle population have demonstrated improved weight gain and outcomes when feeding protocols are implemented. Children undergoing cardiac surgery may experience both acute and chronic pain. Emerging research is investigating the impact of sedatives and analgesics on neurodevelopmental outcomes and quality of life. Improved pain scores and standardized management of pain and withdrawal may improve the patient experience and outcomes. Effective anticoagulation is a critical component of perioperative care but may be complicated by inflammation, multiorgan dysfunction, and patient factors.

CD008201,0,23026653,0,Surgery in patients with hemophilia: is thromboprophylaxis mandatory?,"Patients with hemophilia are considered low risk for thromboembolic complications. However, in the presence of risk factors for thrombosis, such as surgical procedures, and intensive replacement therapy this complication has been reported. Major orthopedic surgeries are often required in patients with hemophilia, due to the presence of hemophiliac arthropathy. In individuals that do not have hemophilia, orthopedic surgeries are particularly well recognized as high risk for venous thromboembolism, and the use of thromboprophylaxis for this condition is recommended. However, for hemophilia patients the use of venous thrombosis prophylaxis during major surgeries, including orthopedic procedures remains controversial. For the majority of the patients the use of gradated compression stockings and early mobilization can be sufficient to prevent venous thromboembolism. The use of anticoagulant prophylaxis should be considered just for patients with relevant additional risk factor for thrombosis. However, for hemophilia patients with inhibitor, pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis is not recommended. For patients with von Willebrand disease receiving factor concentrates replacement therapy undergoing surgical procedures, the FVIII plasma levels should be monitored and thromboprophylaxis should be considered if any other thrombosis risk factor is present. It is important for the future to establish risk assessment tools that can help to determine the most effective and safe practice to prevent venous thrombosis in patients with hemophilia and other bleeding disorders who undergo surgical procedures."
CD008201,0,8419712,0,Tranexamic acid (Cyklokapron) is not necessary to reduce blood loss after coronary artery bypass operations.,"The contribution of fibrinolysis to postoperative bleeding after cardiopulmonary bypass led to routine use of tranexamic acid, a potent antifibrinolytic drug, for a period of time. Two hundred patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass operations were studied, one group of 100 patients given tranexamic acid (40 mg/kg) (group I) after bypass and one subsequent group of 100 patients (group II) serving as a control group. All patients were treated by the same team, and the groups were comparable in all major clinical parameters. The mean mediastinal drainage in group I was 565 +/- 239 ml versus 656 +/- 257 ml in group II. Univariate and multivariate analysis revealed statistical significance (p = 0.02) when corrected for body surface area. However, applying a consistent blood conservation protocol, including removal of autologous blood before bypass for retransfusion after bypass, returning of all oxygenator and tubing contents to the patients, and autotransfusion of the mediastinal shed blood up to 18 hours postoperatively, resulted in nearly identical hemoglobin concentration at discharge (119 +/- 14 gm/L in group I and 121 +/- 14 gm/L in group II). The prevalence of postoperative myocardial infarction included five patients in group I compared with one patient in group II. Although not statistically significant (p = 0.2), the difference is of concern. Tranexamic acid has a beneficial effect on reducing postoperative bleeding after coronary artery bypass operations. The routine use of the drug is not recommended, however, because its effect is a weak one, and it may be of potential hazard by precipitating thrombosis and eventual myocardial infarction."

CD008201,0,24826701,0,Physician practices in the prevention of deep vein thrombosis: the masspro dvt study.,"ABSTRACTNumerous well-designed clinical trials have demonstrated that prophylaxis reduces the incidence of acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in high-risk surgical patients by two-thirds, with a corresponding reduction in mortality from pulmonary embolism. However, studies of clinical practices suggest that DVT prophylaxis is underused - for example, only 39% of high-risk surgical patients in 16 central Massachusetts hospitals were administered DVT prophylaxis in 1986. Subsequently, an intensive educational initiative was launched to improve utilization of DVT prophylaxis. Although some improvement was reported, the level of use was not optimal. The Massachusetts Peer Review Organization (MassPRO) DVT study was designed to gather data on recent practice patterns among Massachusetts surgeons and determine the need for additional educational and quality assurance efforts. The results indicate that there is broad compliance among orthopedic surgeons with consensus recommendations for the use of DVT prophylaxis. Nearly all patients who undergo total hip replacement in Massachusetts are protected from DVT by one or more methods of prophylaxis. These data suggest that the ongoing efforts to improve the use of DVT prophylaxis in Massachusetts since 1986 have come to fruition, at least with respect to total hip replacement."

The treatment of muscle injury is related to the extent of their damage. First actions should be focused on the RICE principle (Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation). In case of torn tissues, local injections of anesthetics, anti-inflammatory agents and regeneration-promoting agents used to be applied. Application of NSAIDs and anti-thrombotic prophylaxis is sound but due to their side effects it is recommended as frequently as it is counterindicated by physicians. A threshold in the therapy, not always noted by therapeutists, involves rapid mobilization of the injured tissue. This involves mobility exercises starting at 3-5 days post-trauma, with no load at the beginning, but starting at days 4 to 6 asssociated with appropriate loading. The recently conducted studies aim at stimulation of rapid muscle regeneration, inhibition of scar formation in the site of injury and elimination of already existing scars. The latter seems most difficult due to the high risk of the repeated muscle injury in the same site. The rehabilitation following trauma with particular attention paid to proprioceptive training is equally important. The risk of another contusion cannot be reduced to minimum until the pre-contusion proprioception level is achieved in the contused extremity."

Therefore, this intervention is advocated in various national and international guidelines. A questionnaire-based study in this issue shows that 99% of surgeons in the Netherlands strictly adhere to these guidelines. Interestingly, the duration of thromboprophylaxis is much less clear and is usually restricted to the duration of hospitalisation. In view of the increasing number of surgical procedures in short-stay or even outpatient settings, it is possible that extended prophylaxis for perioperative thrombosis should be considered, particularly in patients with risk factors for thrombosis, such as the presence of malignant disease."

CD008201,0,11449344,0,Clinical and economic aspects of managing venous thromboembolism in the outpatient setting.,"Low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs) are at least as effective and safe as unfractionated heparin (UFH) in the prevention and initial treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE), and their fixed-dose, once- or twice-daily dosing regimen without laboratory monitoring makes them suitable for outpatient use. Postoperative thromboprophylaxis usually continues until hospital discharge, but evidence demonstrates that the VTE risk persists for several weeks. Economic pressures, changes in clinical practice, and patient preferences make hospital stays shorter. As a result, outpatient thromboprophylaxis with LMWH has been investigated. LMWH self-administered at home once daily for up to 4 weeks after hospital discharge is safe and well tolerated and significantly reduces the incidence of postdischarge VTE after hip replacement. Targeted appropriately, extended thromboprophylaxis may be cost effective, and the development of an autoinjection device may increase the proportion of patients eligible for home management. LMWHs may also be of value as long-term secondary thromboprophylaxis in patients with contraindications to oral anticoagulants. Standard initial treatment for VTE comprises intravenous UFH administered to the patient in the hospital. However, three large-scale studies have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of outpatient treatment of acute VTE using LMWHs. The economic benefits of shortening or eliminating inpatient therapy are substantial, but successful home treatment requires careful patient selection, intensive education and a comprehensive system of professional support to optimize compliance and safety."
CD008201,0,25696887,0,Flamethrowers: blood cells and cancer thrombosis risk.,"Cancer patients are at an increased risk of venous thromboembolism. The clotting system is activated in most cancer patients, which is reflected by specific parameters such as an increased thrombin generation and elevated D-dimer levels. Blood cells, especially WBCs and platelets, play an important role in this activation process. Neutrophils and monocytes are subpopulations of WBCs that increase the thrombotic potential by different mechanisms. Neutrophils are activated by tumor cells and can release DNA, generating highly thrombogenic neutrophil extracellular traps. Monocytes are able to synthesize and express significant quantities of procoagulant tissue factor on their surfaces upon activation. An increased risk of VTE has been found in patients with solid tumors and elevated platelet count and in those with high-grade gliomas and low platelet count. Small circulating membrane vesicles, also called microparticles (MPs), which largely derive from platelets, contribute to the procoagulant potential. Specifically, procoagulant MPs could play a role in tumor-associated thrombosis in pancreatic cancer. Interventional studies are under way that are investigating the benefits of thromboprophylaxis in patients identified to be at high risk of VTE through risk-scoring models that include blood count parameters. The ""flames"" thrown by blood cells, such as neutrophil extracellular traps and MPs, although exciting, still have to be investigated for their usefulness in the clinical setting."

Patients with hypervascular liver lesions <5 cm not meeting criteria for focal nodular hyperplasia or hepatocellular carcinoma underwent surveillance with contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 6, 12, and 24 months after baseline imaging. If lesions remained stable or decreased in size, then surveillance imaging was discontinued. Between 2011 and 2014, 116 patients with hypervascular liver lesions were evaluated. Seventy-nine patients were eligible for the surveillance protocol. Median follow-up was 24 months (range, 1-144 months). One patient (1 %) continued oral contraceptive pill (OCP) use and presented with hemorrhage requiring embolization 5 months after initial diagnosis. Ten patients (13 %) underwent elective embolization or surgical resection for size ≥5 cm. The remaining 68 patients (86 %) continued surveillance without hemorrhage or malignant transformation. Risk factors for requiring intervention during the surveillance period included younger age, larger lesion size, and estrogen use (all p < 0.05). Patients with hepatocellular adenomas <5 cm can safely be observed after discontinuing OCP with serial imaging 6, 12, and 24 months after diagnosis.

CD008201,0,23857035,0,Prevention of venous thromboembolism in acutely ill medical patients after the results of recent trials with the new oral anticoagulants.,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common potentially life-threatening complication in acutely ill medical patients; over 70 % of the fatal episodes of pulmonary embolism during hospitalization occur in non-surgical patients. In the absence of thromboprophylaxis, the incidence of venographically detected deep vein thrombosis is about 15 % in medical patients. Several trials and meta-analyses have clearly demonstrated the prophylactic role of unfractionated heparin, low molecular weight heparin and fondaparinux. Although over the past few years the knowledge of epidemiology, clinical features and prophylaxis in medical patients has significantly improved, there remain a number of controversial areas that require further investigation. Newer VTE risk assessment models have been proposed to select high risk hospitalized medical patients, but they still require external validation; scarce data are available to stratify patients to identify their individual bleeding risk. The optimal duration of thromboprophylaxis in medical patients is still a matter of debate; currently, extended prophylaxis after discharge is not recommended, but it may be required for subgroup of patients with persistently high VTE risk and a negligible risk of bleeding. Based on the results of recent studies, the new oral anticoagulants appear to have a very limited role, if any. However, a better risk stratification of patients who have a persistently increased risk of VTE is warranted to improve the risk to benefit profile of any anticoagulant drug to be used in this setting."

In 2010, CDC published U.S. Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use, 2010 (US MEC), providing evidence-based guidance for choosing a contraceptive method based on the relative safety of contraceptive methods for women with certain characteristics or medical conditions, including women who are postpartum. Recently, CDC assessed evidence regarding the safety of combined hormonal contraceptive use during the postpartum period. This report summarizes that assessment and the resulting updated guidance. These updated recommendations state that postpartum women should not use combined hormonal contraceptives during the first 21 days after delivery because of the high risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE) during this period. During 21-42 days postpartum, women without risk factors for VTE generally can initiate combined hormonal contraceptives, but women with risk factors for VTE (e.g., previous VTE or recent cesarean delivery) generally should not use these methods. After 42 days postpartum, no restrictions on the use of combined hormonal contraceptives based on postpartum status apply."
CD008201,0,18825854,0,Preventing venous thromboembolism through risk assessment approaches.,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients. Recent guidelines from the Department of Health and the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence recommend mandatory, universal VTE risk assessment for hospitalized patients and the provision of appropriate prevention measures (thromboprophylaxis). Careful selection of a suitable VTE risk assessment approach is required to improve the chance of its successful implementation in hospital. At-risk patients need to be identified, counselled and the most appropriate thromboprophylaxis selected, prescribed and delivered. Nurses are ideally placed to play a central role in the implementation of this change in clinical practice through leadership and education. Extended pharmacological thromboprophylaxis has been recommended in certain high-risk groups. New oral anticoagulants are being evaluated, which could change the way thromboprophylaxis is administered in future, benefiting both patients and nurses."

CD008201,0,26019738,0,Anticoagulation and antiplatelets as prophylaxis for hepatic artery thrombosis after liver transplantation.,"Hepatic artery thrombosis (HAT) is the most serious vascular complication after liver transplantation. Multiple risk factors have been identified to impact its development. Changes in haemostasis associated with end stage liver disease and the disturbance of the coagulation and anticoagulation cascades play an important role in development of this lethal complication. Early recognition and therapeutic intervention is mandatory to avoid its consequences. Pharmacological prophylaxis, by the use of antiplatelet or anticoagulant agents, is an important tool to reduce its incidence and prevent graft loss. Only a few studies have shown a clear benefit of antiplatelet agents in reducing HAT occurrence, however, these studies are limited by being retrospective and by inhomogeneous populations. The use of anticoagulants such as heparin is associated with an improvement in the outcomes mainly when used for a high-risk patients like living related liver recipients. The major concern when using these agents is the tendency to increase bleeding complications in a setting of already unstable haemostasis. Hence, monitoring of their administration and careful selection of patients to be treated are of great importance. Well-designed clinical studies are still needed to further explore their effects and to formulate proper protocols that can be implemented safely."

Although a partial response was obtained, she had complications with a deep venous thromboembolism (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) during the treatment. Heparin, followed by warfarin, was useful to treat the embolism. After the venous thromboembolism (VTE) disappeared, combination therapy with S-1 and warfarin were started, and the quality of life (QOL) of this patient was maintained for about one year. Fine monitoring of the international normalized ratio (INR) was required in order to prevent side effects of blood coagulation by S-1 and warfarin coadministration.

The balloon was successfully inserted in 49 patients (91 percent). In five patients the balloon could not be inserted in spite of eight attempts because of tortuosity of the iliac artery. All nine patients in whom balloon insertion was attempted without fluoroscopy had the device inserted successfully. The four insertion attempts during cardiac massage were all successful. Experience with use of the new longer introducer sheath is described. Since its acquisition there has not been a single balloon pump insertion failure in 20 consecutive patients including 6 patients in whom initial attempts through the conventional short death were unsuccessful because of iliac tortuosity. The major complications encountered in the present series were thromboembolic: femoral arterial thrombosis developed in five patients (10.2 percent) and an asymptomatic pulse loss in the contralateral foot developed in another. There were no cases of pseudoaneurysm, groin hematoma, aortic dissection or infection related to the percutaneous balloon. On the basis of this experience, several guidelines are suggested for safe and effective percutaneous insertions and removal of the intraaortic balloon pump."

CD008201,0,25328019,0,Clopidogrel: A multifaceted affair.,"Clopidogrel has been the therapy of choice, combined with aspirin, against platelet aggregation in patients at risk of suffering a vascular thrombotic event. Not all patients respond equally to clopidogrel, an observation that has led to searching for a test that, in the clinical setting, could predict patients' ""resistance"" to therapy. The evidence reveals a complex pharmacokinetic profile for clopidogrel, with multiple players involved, including cytochromes, characteristics of the target tissue, and accompanying clinical conditions. Despite FDA black box warnings recommending CYP2C19 genotyping before clopidogrel use, no robust evidence indicates that CYP2C19 function determines clinical response to the drug, either based on the presence of loss of function alleles or drug interactions with CYP2C19 inhibitors, like omeprazole. A tailored anti-aggregation treatment based on ex vivo platelet reactivity also seems unlikely due to the lack of robustness of most assays. The identification of clinical conditions that are at higher risk of new cardiovascular events, such as diabetes, obesity, coronary artery disease, or specific stenting procedures, seems to be a prudent approach to tailor anti-platelet therapy with more powerful drugs, accompanied by careful counseling to promote patient compliance."

A strategy of risk assessment and heparin prophylaxis was evaluated in pregnant women at increased risk of VTE. In a prospective trial (Efficacy of Thromboprophylaxis as an Intervention during. Gravidity [EThIG]), 810 pregnant women were assigned to one of three management strategies according to pre-defined risk factors related to history of VTE and thrombophilic profile. Low-risk women (group I), received 50-100 IU dalteparin/kg body weight/day for 14 days postpartum, or earlier when additional risk factors occurred. Women at high (group II) or very high risk (group III) received dalteparin from enrollment until six weeks postpartum (50-100 IU and 100-200 IU/kg/day, respectively). Objectively confirmed, symptomatic VTE occurred in 5/810 women (0.6%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.2 to 1.5%) (group I, 0 of 225; II, 3/469; III, 2/116). The rate of serious bleeding was 3.0% (95 % CI, 1.9 to 4.4%); 1.1% (95 % CI, 0.5 to 2.2%) was possibly dalteparin-related. There was no evidence of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, one case of osteoporosis, and rates of miscarriage and stillbirth were similar to previous, retrospective studies. Risk-stratified heparin prophylaxis was associated with a low incidence of symptomaticVTE and few clinically important adverse events.

CD008201,0,7631600,0,Guidance of anticoagulation after intracoronary implantation of Palmaz-Schatz stents by monitoring prothrombin and prothrombin fragment 1 + 2.,"The primary objective of this study was to apply a sophisticated coagulation monitoring system including estimation of the concentration of prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 (PTF 1 + 2) and the activity of prothrombin (coagulation factor II or FII) to cases of stent implantation and to compare the results with those of standard coagulation tests. The secondary objective was to detect the incidence after stenting of subacute thrombosis (SAT) and bleeding complications in these patients and to compare the results with those of a group of patients with stent implantation in whom coagulation was monitored exclusively by standard tests. SAT several days after coronary stenting occurs in up to 20% despite aggressive intravenous and overlapping oral anticoagulation. According to a prospective study protocol 120 consecutive patients with implantation of 155 Palmaz-Schatz stents underwent coagulation monitoring including single daily estimation of the concentration of PTF1 + 2 (target range < 0.5 nmol/L) and of FII activity (15% to 35%) in addition to the standard tests of thrombin time (TT), partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), international normalized ratio (INR), antithrombin III (ATIII), and fibrinogen. Adjustment of heparin and phenprocoumon dosages in this study group was based only on the results of PTF1 + 2 and FII measurements. A control group consisted of 53 patients with implantation of 64 stents who were matched for baseline, angiographic, and procedure-related characteristics. After stenting, anticoagulation was monitored by estimation of TT (target range > 70 seconds), aPTT (> 70 seconds), INR (3.0 to 4.5), AT III (> 80%), and fibrinogen (< 450 mg/dl) in this control group. There was a weak correlation between PTF1 + 2 and aPTT (r = 0.337; PTF1 + 2 = -0.00169aPTT + 0.491) and PTF1 + 2 and TT (r = 0.328; PTF1 + 2 = -0.00142TT + 0.494). A better correlation was found between FII and INR (r = 0.983; FII = -23.8 INR + 134). Stable oral anticoagulation was maintained 2.8 +/- 0.9 days later according to an FII concentration of < 35% compared with an INR > 3. The incidence of SAT was 3.3% with 3.0% for elective versus 3.8% for nonelective stenting. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the PTF1 + 2 test were 100%, 88%, and 88%, respectively. In the control group the incidence of SAT was 17%, with 16.1% for elective versus 18% for nonelective stenting.

CD008201,0,10875428,0,New therapeutic options in DVT prophylaxis.,"In the absence of prophylaxis, elective orthopedic surgery is associated with a high risk of venous thromboembolic events that are responsible for substantial morbidity and mortality. Despite the publication of articles questioning the significance of fatal pulmonary embolism (PE) following elective hip replacement, recent reports support the need for effective thromboprophylaxis in this indication. These reports also provide evidence of a significant reduction in fatal PE and overall mortality provided by treatment with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), compared with unfractionated heparin. Even with the most effective prophylaxis currently available, however, deep vein thrombosis still develops in a minority of high-risk patients, indicating a need for improved therapies. Desirudin, a novel recombinant hirudin and direct thrombin inhibitor, has been shown to provide more effective prophylaxis than the most widely used LMWH, enoxaparin, in orthopedic surgery patients with multiple thromboembolic risk factors. This benefit was not associated with any increase in bleeding. Regional anesthesia and use of graduated compression stockings may provide additional independent reductions in thromboembolic risk in elective orthopedic surgery."

Therefore, efficient prophylaxis is essential. Indication for thromboprophylaxis has to be made individually: In high risk situations, especially in orthopedic surgery, every patient should receive medical prophylaxis, e.g. with heparin, in addition to other preventive measures such as the wearing of elastic stockings or physiotherapy until full mobilization. For high-risk patients having a history of recurrent venous thromboembolism or which are suffering from a thrombogenic disease (e.g. myeloproliferative disorder, especially polycythemia vera, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, systemic lupus erythematosus, homocystinuria) or a hereditary thrombophilia (e.g. deficiency of antithrombin III, protein S, protein C or APC resistance), prophylactic measures should be more generally applied. In these patients, risk factors (e.g. oral contraceptive medication) or risk situations (e.g. long-distance travelling by car or airplane) have to be avoided whenever possible. In inevitable risk situations (e.g. perioperative or peripartal period) prophylaxis is mandatory. It is generally limited to the period of elevated thrombogenic risk and is often effected by application of a low molecular weight heparin. Patients with a history of recurrent thromboembolic events despite elimination of all avoidable risk factors should get a lifelong prophylaxis, usually with oral anticoagulants."

CD008201,0,7861815,0,Current concepts in anticoagulant therapy.,"An understanding of the international normalized ratio (INR)--which was developed to standardize reporting of the prothrombin time (PT) and provide consistent regulation of anticoagulation--is important. The recommended therapeutic range for the INR (which is calculated from the patient's PT, a mean control PT, and the international sensitivity index) for oral anticoagulant treatment of most conditions is 2.0 to 3.0. In patients with mechanical cardiac valves, the INR should be at least 2.5 to 3.5. A common cause for progression of venous thromboembolic disease and treatment failure is inadequate heparinization during the first day of treatment. Therefore, an intravenous bolus of 5,000 to 10,000 U of heparin should be administered before a maintenance infusion is initiated. Also during the first day of treatment, warfarin therapy can be implemented. Overlap treatment with heparin and warfarin for 4 or 5 days is recommended. Low-molecular-weight heparins, a new class of anticoagulants, have been shown to be more effective than standard heparin in preventing venous thrombosis in orthopedic surgical patients, but at a higher cost. Patients with mechanical cardiac valves who are receiving anticoagulant therapy and are scheduled for noncardiac operations must have a risk-to-benefit assessment of the need for continuous anticoagulation performed preoperatively. Many of these patients can safely discontinue warfarin therapy for several days as outpatients before the surgical procedure. Preoperative heparin therapy and warfarin withdrawal in the hospital are recommended only for those patients with cardiac valves at high risk for systemic embolization (with a mitral valve prosthesis, cardiomyopathy, or previous thromboembolism).

These are two of the three components of the acute coronary syndrome (ACS). These forms of ACS most often arise from erosion or rupture of coronary atherosclerotic plaque and subsequent thrombus formation causing incomplete coronary occlusion. The term ACS, as used in this guideline, refers to these two components only. The third component, not discussed here, is ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), which is most frequently associated with complete coronary occlusion. ACS is a clinical emergency requiring urgent assessment. It is characterised by chest pain, ST-segment changes in the electrocardiogram (ECG) and a rise in the serum markers of myocardial injury/infarction. ACS encompasses a variety of clinical presentations. Risk stratification is essential to enable triage of patients to the optimal level of care and specific therapy. Careful clinical assessment is the cornerstone of this risk stratification. The pharmaceutical treatment of ACS is directed primarily at the dissolution of the developing intracoronary thrombus by antiplatelet (aspirin and clopidogrel) and anticoagulant therapy (heparin), and secondarily to the relief of symptoms by anti-anginal and analgesic medications. Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is at least as effective and safe as standard intravenous unfractionated heparin (UH). Coronary angiography is advised for all high-risk patients and those in whom reversible ischaemia or left ventricular dysfunction is discovered. The need for coronary revascularisation is dictated by the findings at angiography. In high-risk patients, appropriate, early revascularisation is recommended in preference to standard medical therapy and 'ischaemia-driven' revascularisation. The glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (GPIIb/IIIa) inhibitors should be used in association with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in high-risk patients. All patients with ACS should receive secondary preventive treatment. It is imperative that they stop smoking. Dietary modification, physical rehabilitation, long-term low-dose aspirin use, b-blockade for those diagnosed with myocardial infarction, tight control of blood pressure, cholesterol lowering with a statin, and treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor should be prescribed."
CD008201,0,15500421,0,Safety of drotrecogin alfa (activated) in the treatment of patients with severe sepsis.,"While severe sepsis continues to plague hospitals worldwide, new treatment modalities, including activated recombinant protein C (drotrecogin alfa, Xigris, Lilly), have become a standard treatment alternative in many institutional algorithms. Drotrecogin alfa was shown to have a beneficial effect on mortality versus placebo in the PROWESS (Recombinant Human Activated Protein C Worldwide Evaluation in Severe Sepsis) trial (p = 0.005), but its use is not completely without risk. An increased risk of bleeding, including severe bleeding episodes, exists ranging 3.5 - 5.2% in the drotrecogin alfa treatment group versus 2.0 - 5.0% in the placebo group. Patients at risk include those on concomitant heparin therapy (> 15,000 units/day), those with platelet counts <or= 30,000/mm(3), and those undergoing an invasive procedure during the scheduled infusion period. After almost three years on the US market, the reported incidence of severe bleeding episodes has risen only slightly from the pre-marketing era, at that time notable for restrictive treatment protocols, devoid of at-risk patients. Drotrecogin alfa, while a promising agent for severe sepsis, requires prudent patient evaluation for bleeding risks."
CD008201,0,24940574,0,The young patient with acute bloody diarrhoea.,"Acute bloody diarrhoea may be commonly encountered in the acute medical unit. Among young patients, the main differential diagnoses are acute infectious colitis, and first presentation of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). A combination of clinical, laboratory, radiological, endoscopic and histological investigations are required to make the diagnosis. If inflammatory bowel disease is suspected, then the patient should be admitted to a specialist gastroenterology ward and receive input from the surgical team, IBD nurses and specialist stoma nurses. Intravenous steroid therapy for acute severe disease should be started before stool cultures are back unless there is a strong clinical suspicion of amoebiasis. All patients require thromboprophylaxis and close attention paid to fluid balance and nutritional requirements. Daily clinical review is required. The Travis criteria may be employed at day 3 to assess the likelihood of requiring surgery and plans for rescue therapy, medical or surgical should be made between day 3-7 if the patient is not responding adequately to initial medical therapy."

CD008201,0,2848143,0,[A case of HCC with a tumor thrombus in the main portal vein surviving (Vp4) for over three years and six months].,"On June 22, 1984, a 69-year-old man was admitted to hospital because of high fever and weight loss. On admission, laboratory data revealed the following: ICG R15 17%, and an AFP of 14 X 10(4) ng/ml. Celiac angiogram revealed a hypervascular tumor, a prominent A-P shunt, and an obstruction of the main portal trunk. After three sessions of one shot chemotherapy using ADM, MMC, and CDDP during the first admission, the AFP serum level decreased to 17,400 ng/ml, and tumor size regressed. Subsequently, the patient has received eighteen sessions of one-shot chemotherapy every two to four months and is still alive as of December 1987."
CD008201,0,19628483,0,Does regional anaesthesia improve outcome after total hip arthroplasty? A systematic review.,"Total hip arthroplasty (THA) is amenable to a variety of regional anaesthesia (RA) techniques that may improve patient outcome. We sought to answer whether RA decreased mortality, cardiovascular morbidity, deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), blood loss, duration of surgery, pain, opioid-related adverse effects, cognitive defects, and length of stay. We also questioned whether RA improved rehabilitation. To do so, we performed a systematic review of the contemporary literature to compare general anaesthesia (GA) and RA and also systemic and regional analgesia for THA. To reflect contemporary surgical and anaesthetic practice, only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) from 1990 onward were included. We identified 18 studies involving 1239 patients. Only two of the 18 trials were of Level I quality. There is insufficient evidence from RCTs alone to conclude if anaesthetic technique influenced mortality, cardiovascular morbidity, or the incidence of DVT and PE when using thromboprophylaxis. Blood loss may be reduced in patients receiving RA rather than GA for THA. Our review suggests that there is no difference in duration of surgery in patients who receive GA or RA. Compared with systemic analgesia, regional analgesia can reduce postoperative pain, morphine consumption, and nausea and vomiting. Length of stay is not reduced and rehabilitation does not appear to be facilitated by RA or analgesia for THA."
CD008201,0,8710039,0,The bleeding risk in chronic haemodialysis: preventive strategies in high-risk patients.,"Haemodialysis (HD) patients are at an increased risk of bleeding because of uraemic bleeding tendency and systemic anticoagulation caused by intermittent heparinization. Additional risk factors may be aspirin or coumarin use for the prevention of fistula thrombosis, diffuse intravascular coagulation, recent trauma, postsurgical state, inadequate control of hypertension, gastrointestinal lesions, diabetic retinopathy, renal cystic disease, and uraemic pericarditis. In HD patients with an active bleeding focus blood transfusion, desmopressin acetate (DDAVP), conjugated oestrogens, and dialysis treatment can limit the bleeding risk. Strategies to reduce the bleeding risk conveyed by systemic anticoagulation during HD are regional heparin anticoagulation and minimal heparinization. In our opinion, dialytic modalities that completely preclude systemic anticoagulation, i.e. peritoneal dialysis (PD), heparin-free HD, and HD with regional anticoagulation with prostacyclin, mesilates, or citrate, are indicated for patients who are actively bleeding, or who are within 3 days from a bleeding episode, or a surgical or accidental wound, or who are less than 2 weeks from cerebral or retinal haemorrhage, and for patients with incompletely treated proliferative diabetic retinopathy or uraemic pericarditis."
CD008201,0,19782914,0,A new era for anticoagulants.,"Selective inhibitors of specific coagulation factors represent a new class of antithrombotic agents, designed to overcome the limitations of traditional anticoagulants. Available clinical studies indicate that the most promising new anticoagulants are those selectively targeting factor Xa and thrombin. Typically, the standard steps for clinical evaluation of new anticoagulants are thromboprophylaxis in high risk orthopedic surgery, followed by treatment of established venous thromboembolism, nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and acute coronary syndromes. These agents - that have the potential to be more effective and easier to use than conventional drugs such as heparins and vitamin K antagonists - will greatly expand our armamentarium for the prevention and treatment of arterial and venous thromboembolism. The current knowledge on these antithrombotic agents is summarized in this review, particularly focusing on the early results of clinical trials."

CD008201,0,18649821,0,"Atrial fibrillation among older adults: pathophysiology, symptoms, and treatment.","Atrial fibrillation is the most common arrhythmia among older adults. Valvular heart disease, dilated cardiomyopathy, aortic stenosis, hypertension, coronary artery disease, pericarditis, thyrotoxicosis, pulmonary disease, cardiac surgery, alcohol excess, and alcohol withdrawal are associated with atrial fibrillation. Nurses caring for older adults need to understand the condition's pathophysiology, signs and symptoms, diagnostic data and treatment protocols, and adherence issues to prevent the formation of emboli in chronic atrial fibrillation and to understand treatment of this common arrhythmia. This article presents an individual example of an elderly man exhibiting a new onset of atrial fibrillation and the interventions required to manage the associated complications. Atrial fibrillation places patients at risk for stroke from a thromboembolism; thus, pharmacological and nonpharmocological care strategies for managing patients with atrial fibrillation are discussed."

The objective of this study was to determine whether practice patterns in AF stroke prophylaxis reflect the findings of clinical trials and whether stroke prophylaxis in AF differs between community hospitals and tertiary teaching hospitals."
CD008201,0,12061291,0,Management of thromboembolic disease in pregnancy.,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is the leading cause of maternal mortality and morbidity in developed countries including Singapore. The physiological changes of pregnancy and other factors, such as maternal age, parity, obesity, operative delivery, general anaesthesia and congenital and acquired thrombophilia, further increase the risk of VTE throughout all three trimesters of pregnancy, including the puerperium. VTE has a wide spectrum of clinical presentations and a high index of clinical suspicion is vital. Clinicians should not withhold the use of chest X-rays and ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) lung scans in pregnancy as the radiation emitted is well within the safety limits to the fetus. Most treatment guidelines are based on studies in non-pregnant populations. Heparin is the preferred anticoagulant as it does not cross the placenta and therefore carries no teratogenic risk to the fetus. There is increasing experience and confidence in the use of fixed dose subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) which removes the need for cumbersome monitoring, thereby allowing outpatient treatment. LMWH may also have a lower risk of osteopaenic complications compared to unfractionated heparin. With the exception of acute phase treatment of pulmonary embolism, LMWH is used in all other aspects of the treatment of VTE in pregnancy, including thromboprophylaxis. Risk stratification of women into high and low risk allows judicious use of anticoagulants for thromboprophylaxis. Antenatal thromboprophylaxis with LMWH is reserved for high-risk women, while low-risk women will only require such cover in the postpartum period."

CD008201,0,22104458,0,Strategies for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis programs.,"Prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) is often overlooked in clinical practice, despite being a frequent and serious complication of various medical conditions and surgical procedures. The need to reduce hospital-acquired VTE is becoming increasingly recognized in the United States, and various quality-improvement initiatives have been developed. Prevention of VTE through evidence-based, practice-informed pathways includes assessing the patient's risk of VTE and provision of VTE at different stages: at admission, during hospitalization, and after hospital discharge. A multidisciplinary approach, involving physicians working with pharmacists, nurses, and other staff, can ensure that VTE prevention is routinely addressed. Patients admitted to hospitals should undergo VTE risk assessment, and the appropriate dose, type, and duration of medication should be administered with regular monitoring for VTE events and bleeding complications. Venous thromboembolism risk assessment should continue throughout hospitalization with appropriate prophylaxis when necessary. Patients may need to continue anticoagulation into the outpatient setting to achieve adequate prophylaxis duration. Useful approaches to ensure successful transition of care include patient education and support, with the accurate and timely transfer of information from the hospital to the primary care physician. Various strategies and tools are available to help physicians establish good VTE practices at each stage, including risk assessment models, reminders, clinical decision support systems, educational programs, and online resources, such as those from the Society of Hospital Medicine. Effective use of these strategies by physicians, with the engagement and support of nurses and pharmacists, should help to improve current practices and to reduce the considerable burden of VTE."

CD008201,0,24052775,0,Care transitions in anticoagulation management for patients with atrial fibrillation: an emphasis on safety.,Thromboprophylaxis with oral anticoagulants is an important but underused element of atrial fibrillation (AF) treatment. Reduction of stroke risk by anticoagulants comes at the price of bleeding risk. Patients with AF receiving anticoagulants require heightened attention with transition from one care setting to another.
CD008201,0,21238889,0,Antiplatelet therapy in the perioperative period.,The current practice of withdrawing aspirin 7-10 days preoperatively may be dangerous in certain groups of patients. The risk of cardiovascular events increases 3-fold after aspirin withdrawal. The average time between aspirin withdrawal and the manifestation of acute coronary syndrome is 8 to 11 days. The withdrawal of clopidogrel earlier than 4-6 weeks after bare metal stent implantation or less than 12 months after drug-eluting stent implantation is very risky and poses a high risk of stent thrombosis and high perioperative mortality. Continuing aspirin perioperatively leads to a 1.5-fold increase in perioperative bleeding complications but it does not lead to a higher severity of bleeding complications or higher mortality. The article analyzes current European and American guidelines for perioperative antiplatelet treatment and suggests an algorithm based on the guidelines to help make clinical decisions.
CD008201,0,26515263,0,Role of Physical Therapists in the Management of Individuals at Risk for or Diagnosed With Venous Thromboembolism: Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guideline.,"The American Physical Therapy Association (APTA), in conjunction with the Cardiovascular & Pulmonary and Acute Care sections of APTA, have developed this clinical practice guideline to assist physical therapists in their decision-making process when treating patients at risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE) or diagnosed with a lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (LE DVT). No matter the practice setting, physical therapists work with patients who are at risk for or have a history of VTE. This document will guide physical therapist practice in the prevention of, screening for, and treatment of patients at risk for or diagnosed with LE DVT. Through a systematic review of published studies and a structured appraisal process, key action statements were written to guide the physical therapist. The evidence supporting each action was rated, and the strength of statement was determined. Clinical practice algorithms, based on the key action statements, were developed that can assist with clinical decision making. Physical therapists, along with other members of the health care team, should work to implement these key action statements to decrease the incidence of VTE, improve the diagnosis and acute management of LE DVT, and reduce the long-term complications of LE DVT."

CD008201,0,17948162,0,Rationale for thromboprophylaxis in lower joint arthroplasty.,"Without prophylaxis, rates of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) after major orthopedic surgery range from 40% to 60%. Randomized clinical trials over the past 30 years have provided evidence that primary thromboprophylaxis reduces DVT, pulmonary embolism (PE), and fatal PE, and prophylaxis to prevent venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients at risk has been ranked as the highest safety practice for hospitalized patients. Since 1986, some type of prophylaxis has been recommended for total knee arthroplasty (TKA), total hip arthroplasty (THA), and hip fracture surgery. Orthopedic guidelines published in Chest provide a current evidence-based guide for prophylaxis for TKA, THA, and hip fracture surgery. In addition to following these recommendations for routine prophylaxis, surgeons should assess patients for additional VTE risk. Patients at higher risk may need more intense prophylaxis. Data from meta-analyses and placebo-controlled, blinded, randomized clinical trials have demonstrated little or no increase in rates of clinically important bleeding with prophylaxis."

CD008201,0,18841295,0,Maintained effectiveness of an electronic alert system to prevent venous thromboembolism among hospitalized patients.,"Despite current guidelines, venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis is underused. Computerized programs to encourage physicians to apply thromboprophylaxis have been shown to be effective in selected populations. Our aim was to analyze the impact of the implementation of a computer-alert system for VTE risk in all hospitalized patients of a teaching hospital. A computer program linked to the clinical record database was developed to assess all hospitalized patients' VTE risk daily. The physician responsible for patients at high risk was alerted, but remained free to order or withhold prophylaxis. Over 19,000 hospitalized, medical and surgical, adult patients between January to June 2005 (pre-intervention phase), January to June 2006 and January to June 2007 (post-intervention phase), were included. During the first semesters of 2006 and 2007, an electronic alert was sent to 32.8% and 32.2% of all hospitalized patients, respectively. Appropriate prophylaxis among alerted patients was ordered in 89.7% (2006) and 88.5% (2007) of surgical patients, and in 49.2% (2006) and 64.4% (2007) of medical patients. A sustained reduction of VTE during hospitalization was achieved, Odds ratio (OR): 0.53, 95% confidence interval (CI) (0.25-1.10) and OR: 0.51, 95%CI (0.24-1.05) during the first semesters of 2006 and 2007 respectively, the impact being significant (p < 0.05) among medical patients in 2007, OR: 0.36, 95%CI (0.12-0.98). The implementation of a computer-alert program helps physicians to assess each patient's thrombotic risk, leading to a better use of thromboprophylaxis, and a reduction in the incidence of VTE among hospitalized patients. For the first time, an intervention aimed to improve VTE prophylaxis shows maintained effectiveness over time."

CD008201,0,16131048,0,Thromboembolic complications of malignancy. Part 2: management.,"Thromboembolism affects many patients with solid tumors and clonal hematologic malignancies. Thromboprophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is indicated for surgery and other high-risk situations, but not routinely for central venous catheters or nonsurgical, ambulatory management. Thrombotic events require full anticoagulation for the duration of active disease and/or the prothrombotic stimulus. LMWHs are safe and more effective than both unfractionated heparin for initial therapy and warfarin for secondary prevention. Anti-inflammatory and antiangiogenic properties might account for this advantage and for a survival benefit of chronic LMWH in subgroups of cancer patients. Ongoing studies are characterizing the cost-effectiveness and antitumor mechanisms of LMWHs, the potential utility of newer anticoagulants, and the ability of predictive models to identify high-risk candidates for thromboprophylaxis."
CD008201,0,27303769,0,An approach to a patient with infective endocarditis.,"Although infective endocarditis (IE) is relatively uncommon, it remains an important clinical entity with a high in-hospital and 1-year mortality. It is most commonly caused by viridans streptococci. Staphylococcus aureus is responsible for a malignant course of IE and often requires early surgery to eradicate. Other rarer causes are various bacilli, including the HACEK (Haemophilus, Actinobacillus,Cardiobacterium, Eikenella and Kingella spp.) group of organisms and fungi. The clinical presentation varies. Patients may present with a nonspecific illness, valve dysfunction, heart failure (HF) and symptoms due to peripheral embolisation. The diagnosis is traditionally based on the modified Duke criteria and rests mainly on clinical features and to a lesser extent on certain laboratory findings,microbiological assessment and cardiovascular imaging. Identification of the offending micro-organism is not only important from a diagnostic point of view, but also makes targeted antibiotic treatment possible and provides useful prognostic information. A significant proportion of microbiological cultures are negative, frequently owing to the administration of antibiotics prior to appropriate culture.Blood-culture-negative IE poses significant diagnostic and treatment challenges. The course of the disease is frequently complicated, and sequelae include HF, local intracardiac extension of infection (abscess, fistula, pseudoaneurysm), stroke and intracranial haemorrhage due to septic emboli or mycotic aneurysm formation as well as renal injury. Management includes prolonged intravenous antibiotics and consideration for early surgery with removal of infective tissue and valve replacement in patients who have poor prognostic features or complications. Antibiotic administration for at-risk patients to prevent bacteraemia during specific procedures (particularly dental) is recommended to prevent IE.

CD008201,0,10692733,0,A prospective audit of hospital-acquired deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.,"The incidence of symptomatic deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism acquired in hospital was studied, and the effectiveness of current thromboprophylaxis was assessed in an open study of 8648 admissions to the Doncaster Royal Infirmary between April and July 1994. On admission, all patients were assessed for their likely risk of thromboembolic problems according to THRIFT criteria. Treatment, prophylaxis, complications and outcome were recorded on discharge. A high risk sub-group was followed up for up to 42 days after discharge. The overall rate of clinically apparent hospital-acquired thromboembolic complications was 0.4% (n = 35). The rate of clinically apparent thromboembolic disease in the high risk group was 2.1% (n = 17). The incidence of thromboembolic problems appeared not to be reduce by prophylaxis apparently even when stratified by risk group. These findings suggest that thromboembolic complications may be less common than would be expected from published literature. Thromboprophylaxis as currently practised within our institution does not seem to affect the incidence of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, and these results would appear to argue against a 'blanket' policy for pharmacological thromboprophylaxis."
CD008201,0,25154429,0,Comparative lower limb hemodynamics using neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) versus intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC).,"Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) is a life threatening condition and a serious concern among hospitalised patients, with death occurring in approximately 6% of cases. Intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) is commonly used for DVT prevention, however suffers from low compliance and issues of usability and portability. Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) has been shown to improve lower limb hemodynamics but direct comparison with IPC in terms of hemodynamics is rare but very important to determine the potential effectiveness of NMES in DVT prevention.Lower limb IPC was compared to calf NMES, in 30 healthy volunteers (18-23 years). Each intervention was carried out on each leg, on the popliteal vein measured using Doppler ultrasound. All interventions produced significantly greater haemodynamic responses compared to baseline. Calf-IPC and NMES produced significant increases in venous blood velocity (cm/s) and volume of blood ejected per cycle (1 cycle of NMES expels 23.22 ml compared to the baseline ejected volume of 2.52 ml, measured over 1 s (p < 0.001 versues baseline).Improving lower limb hemodynamics is vital in preventing DVT. NMES resulted in larger ejected volumes compared to IPC (x3 greater than foot-IPC and x1.7 greater than calf-IPC) more effectively emptying the veins and soleal sinuses. This is an important finding as DVT occurs predominantly in the soleal sinuses. NMES is silent and portable and thus does not suffer many of the issues associated with IPC. This work supports the potential widespread application of NMES in hospital and home settings where the risk of DVT formation is high."

The guidelines focus on currently available and validated methods of diagnosis, prognostic assessment (prediction of outcome and death risk), treatment of pulmonary embolism and management in specific settings including pregnancy, malignancy, non-thrombotic PE, right heart thrombi, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. The novelty of these guidelines is the stratification of PE into high-risk, low-risk and intermediate-risk of PE-related early death, which has important consequences for treatment, rather than the use of misleading terms such as zmassive', zsubmassive' and znon-massive' pulmonary embolism. The anticoagulants remain the mainstay of therapy, with thrombolytic therapy being an therapeutic option in patients with high-risk PE presenting with cardiogenic shock and/or persistent arterial hypotension."

Venous thromboembolism remains a serious public health challenge, with an ever-increasing odds ratio of occurrence given the aging population in the United States. This article reviews the epidemiology of VTE; risk factor identification and stratification as a means of advancing awareness, prevention, and detection of VTE; and prophylaxis options and their outcomes, particularly administration of unfractionated heparin (UFH) 5000 U subcutaneously every 12 versus 8 hours in the at-risk medical patient population. The important studies comparing outcomes of these different UFH dosing regimens compared with placebo and low-molecular-weight heparins also are discussed. Consensus recommendations shaping contemporary clinical practice guidelines in this setting are highlighted. A systemwide approach to treatment of all medical patients who are risk stratified and receiving appropriate pharmacologic prophylaxis is recommended."
CD008201,0,18574273,0,Antithrombotic therapy in atrial fibrillation: American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines (8th Edition).,"This chapter about antithrombotic therapy in atrial fibrillation (AF) is part of the American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Guidelines Clinical Practice Guidelines (8th Edition). Grade 1 recommendations indicate that most patients would make the same choice and Grade 2 suggests that individual patient's values may lead to different choices (for a full understanding of the grading see Guyatt et al, CHEST 2008; 133[suppl]:123S-131S). Among the key recommendations in this chapter are the following (all vitamin K antagonist [VKA] recommendations have a target international normalized ratio [INR] of 2.5; range 2.0-3.0, unless otherwise noted). In patients with AF, including those with paroxysmal AF, who have had a prior ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), or systemic embolism, we recommend long-term anticoagulation with an oral VKA, such as warfarin, because of the high risk of future ischemic stroke faced by this set of patients (Grade 1A). In patients with AF, including those with paroxysmal AF, who have two or more of the risk factors for future ischemic stroke listed immediately below, we recommend long-term anticoagulation with an oral VKA (Grade 1A). Two or more of the following risk factors apply: age >75 years, history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, moderately or severely impaired left ventricular systolic function and/or heart failure. In patients with AF, including those with paroxysmal AF, with only one of the risk factors listed immediately above, we recommend long-term antithrombotic therapy (Grade 1A), either as anticoagulation with an oral VKA, such as warfarin (Grade 1A), or as aspirin, at a dose of 75-325 mg/d (Grade 1B). In these patients at intermediate risk of ischemic stroke we suggest a VKA rather than aspirin (Grade 2A). In patients with AF, including those with paroxysmal AF, age < or =75 years and with none of the other risk factors listed above, we recommend long-term aspirin therapy at a dose of 75-325 mg/d (Grade 1B), because of their low risk of ischemic stroke. For patients with atrial flutter, we recommend that antithrombotic therapy decisions follow the same risk-based recommendations as for AF (Grade 1C). For patients with AF and mitral stenosis, we recommend long-term anticoagulation with an oral VKA (Grade 1B). For patients with AF and prosthetic heart valves we recommend long-term anticoagulation with an oral VKA at an intensity appropriate for the specific type of prosthesis (Grade 1B). See CHEST 2008; 133(suppl):593S-629S. For patients with AF of > or =48 h or of unknown duration for whom pharmacologic or electrical cardioversion is planned, we recommend anticoagulation with an oral VKA, such as warfarin, for 3 weeks before elective cardioversion and for at least 4 weeks after sinus rhythm has been maintained (Grade 1C). For patients with AF of > or = 48 h or of unknown duration undergoing pharmacological or electrical cardioversion, we also recommend either immediate anticoagulation with unfractionated IV heparin, or low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), or at least 5 days of warfarin by the time of cardioversion (achieving an INR of 2.0-3.0) as well as a screening multiplane transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). If no thrombus is seen, cardioversion is successful, and sinus rhythm is maintained, we recommend anticoagulation for at least 4 weeks. If a thrombus is seen on TEE, then cardioversion should be postponed and anticoagulation should be continued indefinitely. We recommend obtaining a repeat TEE before attempting later cardioversion (Grade 1B addressing the equivalence of TEE-guided vs non-TEE-guided cardioversion). For patients with AF of known duration <48 h, we suggest cardioversion without prolonged anticoagulation (Grade 2C). However, in patients without contraindications to anticoagulation, we suggest beginning IV heparin or LMWH at presentation (Grade 2C)."

The risk of TE in IBD patients has been demonstrated to be approximately three-fold higher as compared to the general population. The pathogenesis of thrombosis in IBD patients is multifactorial and not fully explained. The most commonly listed factors include genetic and immune abnormalities, disequilibrium between procoagulant and anticoagulant factors, although recently, the role of endothelial damage as an IBD-triggering factor is underlined. Several studies report that the levels of some coagulation enzymes, including fibrinogen, factors V, VII, VIII, active factor XI, tissue factor, prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 and the thrombin-antithrombin complex, are altered in IBD patients. It has been demonstrated that there is a significant decrease of tissue plasminogen activator level, a marked increase of plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 and thrombin-activable fibrinolysis inhibitor, a significantly lower level of antithrombin III and tissue factor pathway inhibitor. IBD patients have been also observed to produce an increased amount of various anticoagulant antibodies. Hyperhomocysteinemia, which is a potential risk factor for TE was also observed in some IBD patients. Further studies are necessary to assess the role of coagulation abnormalities in IBD etiology and to determine indications for thromboprophylactic treatment in patients at high risk of developing TE."
CD008201,0,9042560,0,Efficacy and safety of postdischarge administration of enoxaparin in the prevention of deep venous thrombosis after total hip replacement. A prospective randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial.,"Although venous thromboembolism has occasionally been reported after hospital discharge in patients who have undergone total hip replacement (THR), this risk has not been fully quantified and the usefulness of a prophylactic treatment has not been evaluated. We conducted a single-centre prospective randomised double-blind clinical trial in 2 parallel groups of patients who had undergone THR and were free of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) at discharge, as assessed by bilateral ascending venography. During hospitalisation, all patients received a low molecular weight heparin, enoxaparin (enoxaparin sodium), as a prophylactic treatment for venous thromboembolism. Just before hospital discharge (15 +/- 1 days from surgery) 179 consecutive patients were randomly assigned to receive subcutaneous enoxaparin 40mg (n = 90) or placebo (n = 89) once daily for 21 +/- 2 days. The primary efficacy outcome was defined as the occurrence of DVT and/or documented pulmonary embolism (PE). DVT was assessed by ascending bilateral venography performed 21 +/- 2 days after randomisation or earlier if necessary. Secondary efficacy outcomes were the occurrence of proximal and distal DVT. Safety outcomes were defined as the occurrence of major and minor haemorrhage, other adverse events and changes in laboratory parameters. All patients underwent a 3-month follow-up. There were no deaths or cases of clinical PE during the study and the follow-up periods. In 173 patients with evaluable venograms, analysis of efficacy on an intention-to-treat basis showed that the incidence of DVT at day 21 was significantly lower in the enoxaparin group (6 of 85; 7.1%) than in the placebo group (17 of 88; 19.3%; p = 0.018), a risk reduction of 63%. Distal DVT was less frequent in the enoxaparin group than in the placebo group (1.2 vs 11.4%; p = 0.006) but there was no significant difference between groups in the incidence of proximal DVT. A 'per-protocol' analysis of efficacy in 155 patients confirmed the results for total and distal DVT, but also showed a trend in efficacy in favour of enoxaparin with regard to the incidence of proximal DVT (p = 0.064). Enoxaparin was safe in comparison with placebo: only 2 minor bleedings occurred in the enoxaparin group and there was no difference in the incidence of other adverse events between the 2 groups. In patients undergoing THR, the risk of late-occurring DVT remained high during the 21 days after hospital discharge in the placebo group. Prophylactic treatment with enoxaparin reduced the risk and was well tolerated in this context."
CD008201,0,20019020,0,The ''critical thrombosis period'' in major orthopedic surgery: when to start and when to stop prophylaxis.,"Patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery are at high venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk, with morbid and potentially fatal consequences. Anticoagulant VTE prophylaxis reduces rates of postoperative deep vein thrombosis by up to 60% to 70% in these patients. Therefore, pharmacological prophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs), vitamin K antagonists, or fondaparinux is recommended by current guidelines. However, there remains an ongoing debate regarding when to initiate and the optimal duration for prophylaxis. Here, we discuss the mechanisms underlying thrombus formation in patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery, and we review the current literature on the benefit-to-risk ratio associated with preoperative and postoperative initiation of thromboprophylaxis and also the benefit-to-risk ratio in cases of neuraxial anesthesia. We also discuss the duration of postoperative VTE risk following major orthopedic surgery and assess the ''critical thrombosis period'' when prophylaxis should be provided. Current literature reflects the need to balance the improved efficacy of initiating prophylaxis close to the surgery with increased risk of perioperative bleeding. Evidence from pathology, epidemiology, and clinical studies suggests the risk period for VTE begins at surgery and extends well beyond hospitalization-a crucial issue when considering how long to give prophylaxis-and, in the case of total hip arthroplasty, for at least 3 months after surgery. Literature supports the greater use of ''just-in-time'' thromboprophylaxis initiation and after-discharge continuation of optimal prophylaxis in orthopedic surgery patients. Providing optimal thromboprophylaxis throughout the critical thrombosis period where a patient is at VTE risk will ensure the best reductions in VTE-related morbidity and mortality."
CD008201,0,22651698,0,Pharmacologic venous thromboembolism prophylaxis after traumatic brain injury: a critical literature review.,"Despite the frequency and morbidity of venous thromboembolism (VTE) development after traumatic brain injury (TBI), no national standard of care exists to guide TBI caregivers for the use of prophylactic anticoagulation. Fears of iatrogenic propagation of intracranial hemorrhage patterns have led to a dearth of research in this field, and it is only relatively recently that studies dedicated to this question have been performed. These have generally been limited to retrospective and/or observational studies in which patients are classified in a binary fashion as having the presence or absence of intracranial blood. This methodology does not account for the fact that smaller injury patterns stabilize more rapidly, and thus may be able to safely tolerate earlier initiation of prophylactic anticoagulation than larger injury patterns. This review seeks to critically assess the literature on this question by examining the existing evidence on the safety and efficacy of pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis in the setting of elective craniotomy (as this is the closest model available from which to extrapolate) and after TBI. In doing so, we critique studies that approach TBI as a homogenous or a heterogenous study population. Finally, we propose our own theoretical protocol which stratifies patients into low, moderate, and high risk for the likelihood of natural progression of their hemorrhage pattern, and which allows one to tailor a unique VTE prophylaxis regimen to each individual arm."
CD008201,0,24773398,0,Improving transitions of care for patients with thromboembolic disease.,"Patients with or at risk for thromboembolic disease have many transitional interactions within the healthcare system. Transitions of care--when patients move between or within sites of care, or transition from inpatient to outpatient status--create repeated and diverse opportunities for medication errors, rehospitalization, and other adverse events that may increase costs. Although effective antithrombotic therapies are available, these therapies are complex, underprescribed, and frequently suboptimally managed, a situation further exacerbated by poor patient adherence to therapy. Physician and patient education may help address knowledge gaps related to antithrombotic therapy to help ensure that patients receive appropriate therapy and adhere to the therapeutic regimen. Due to the complexities of antithrombotic therapy it is not surprising that when these patients experience transitions of care, the potential for errors and suboptimal outcomes becomes compounded. Efforts are under way to improve the process of transitional care, including the development of protocols for medication reconciliation, improved communication between clinicians at hand-off, the use of electronic medical records, and the introduction of a collaborative approach among different types of healthcare providers, including pharmacists, nurses, and care managers, so that transitional care is provided smoothly and safely."

CD008201,0,10428226,0,The incidence of venous thromboembolism after total hip arthroplasty: a specific hypotensive epidural anesthesia protocol.,"We retrospectively reviewed all consecutive unilateral primary total hip arthroplasty (THA) procedures performed by 3 attending surgeons on the Arthroplasty Service at our institution from January 1, 1990, to December 31, 1993. All surgery was performed under a specific hypotensive epidural anesthesia protocol. Hypotensive epidural anesthesia at our institution provides a lower level of hypotension (mean arterial pressure of 50-60 mmHg) as compared to hypotensive anesthesia used more generally around the world (mean arterial pressure >70 mmHg). For each patient, hospital and postdischarge office records for a minimum of 3 months after surgery were reviewed for the type of postoperative screening test, the incidence of deep venous thrombosis (DVT), and the incidence of symptomatic pulmonary embolism (PE). Overall, 2,592 primary unilateral THAs were performed with 78.6% (2,037 of 2,592) of patients receiving a venogram. Our protocol for thromboembolic disease prophylaxis in these patients included aspirin postoperatively as well as antithromboembolic disease stockings and early ambulation (24-48 hours postoperatively). The 555 patients who did not receive venography were managed with a different protocol that included warfarin postoperatively as well as antithromboembolic disease stockings and early ambulation. This high-risk group consisted of patients who received warfarin preoperatively (ie, cardiac valve) or patients with a history of DVT who were to receive warfarin postoperatively, regardless of venography result. Overall, DVT was diagnosed in 10.3% (210 of 2,037) of patients who had a venogram. Of these patients who had venography, 2.3% (46 of 2,037) had an isolated proximal DVT; 6.0% (123 of 2,037), a distal DVT; and 2.0% (41 of 2,037), both a proximal and a distal DVT. Of the 87 cases of proximal DVT identified, 60.9% (53 of 87) were femoral DVT; 18.4% (16 of 87), popliteal DVT; and 20.7% (18 of 87), both femoral and popliteal DVT. Of the 164 distal DVT, 68.3% (112 of 164) were major calf DVT and 31.7% (52 of 164) were minor calf DVT. The overall incidence of major venous thrombosis (sum of proximal and major calf thrombi) was 9.8% (199 of 2,037) in patients who had venography. Ventilation-perfusion scanning was used selectively in patients symptomatic for PE. Overall, symptomatic PE was diagnosed by ventilation-perfusion scan in 1.0% (26 of 2,592) of patients, with 0.58% (15 of 2,592) of patients having an in-hospital PE. Of the 15 patients who had an in-hospital PE, 11 patients had a venogram, and only 3 of 11 were positive. Late symptomatic PE was defined from discharge (mean, 7 +/- 2 days) to 3 months after discharge from the hospital and occurred in 0.42% (11 of 2,592) of patients. One of the 11 late symptomatic PEs was fatal. In the overall study, this represents 0.04% (1 of 2,592) fatal PE. Of the 11 patients with a late symptomatic PE, 10 had venograms in the hospital, and all 10 were negative for DVT. Overall, in the patients with a positive venogram, the incidence of symptomatic PE was 1.4% (3 of 210), whereas in the patients with a negative venogram, the incidence of symptomatic PE was 0.44% (8 of 1,827). At our institution, patients who undergo primary THA performed with hypotensive epidural anesthesia, postoperative aspirin, antithromboembolic disease stockings, and early ambulation have a low risk for thromboembolic disease."

CD008201,0,12634460,0,Air travel-associated venous thromboembolism.,"Long-distance air travel is increasing and cases of venous thromboembolism (VTE) following air travel have attracted both considerable public attention and legal claims against airlines. VTE is a common disorder worldwide with a notably high incidence in older individuals. Many biochemical factors that lead to, or accentuate, thrombus formation are associated with increased risk of VTE. These factors include thrombophilia, activated protein C resistance and factor V Leiden, prothrombin gene mutation, antiphospholipid antibodies, protein S and protein C deficiencies, and methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase polymorphism and homocysteinemia. Individual physical characteristics including age, weight and height are significant for personal risk of VTE as are other factors such as use of oral contraceptives in women. In the case of air travel-related venous thrombosis, superimposed upon these individual factors are the environmental factors directly related to air travel. Travel-related factors include stasis associated with prolonged periods of immobility, physiological stresses resulting from exposure to the cabin environment (low humidity and hypoxia) in long-haul flight and other in-flight factors. It is suggested that passenger behavior (movement, avoidance of dehydration and of alcohol) and appropriate pharmacological prophylaxis for high-risk travelers can reduce the likelihood of VTE. Physical prophylaxis (use of compression stockings or in-flight exercise devices) may also be of general benefit to passengers. It is recommended that airlines become more proactive in educating passengers concerning the dangers of VTE and in promoting passenger actions that can reduce risk. Airlines should also work to avoid cramped seating conditions (seat size and pitch) that contribute to prolonged immobility. Governments and regulatory authorities should mandate the provision of adequate seating conditions and a good cabin environment and should support studies that will define risks and determine the efficacy of protocols to minimize dangers of VTE. Increased long-haul air traffic and an aging population suggest that travel-related VTE may present a growing healthcare threat and has highlighted a need for additional biomedical research into the causes and potential solutions to this problem."
CD008201,0,11251349,0,Extended thromboprophylaxis following lower limb arthroplasty: what do the clinical trials mean?,"Patients undergoing major orthopaedic surgery are at high risk of thromboembolic complications. Of the available options for pharmacologic prophylaxis, the low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs) have been shown to be most effective in reducing the incidence of venous thromboembolic complications and are well tolerated. However, as the risk of venous thromboembolism persists for several weeks post-discharge, there is controversy regarding the ideal duration of prophylaxis. Six recent studies have examined the efficacy and safety of prolonged prophylaxis in this setting. Five of these studies have demonstrated that prolonged LMWH prophylaxis (either enoxaparin or dalteparin) for 4--5 weeks is beneficial and significantly superior to conventional prophylaxis for 7--15 days. The other study, using ardeparin, examined clinical endpoints and showed a minor trend but no significant reduction in these events. Furthermore, two of the studies -- one with enoxaparin and one with dalteparin -- also demonstrated a significant reduction in the incidence of proximal deep vein thrombosis. Analysis of all clinical events from the five studies that have published that information shows a halving or 51% reduction in favour of prolonged prophylaxis. On the basis of current evidence, prolonged thromboprophylaxis with LMWH for up to 35 days after major orthopaedic surgery is recommended."
CD008201,0,23055357,0,[The tumor patient with an indication for intensive anticoagulation].,"Patients with cancer are at high risk to develop venous thromboembolism as well as arterial thrombosis. Well established treatment patterns of these vascular complications are often hampered in cancer patients by disturbances of coagulation or thrombocytopenia. Therefore standardized interventions or medical treatment can be difficult to perform. As data from clinical trials or recommendations from guidelines are sparse, complicated cases have to be dealt with an interdisciplinary single patient approach. Thus in patients with STEMI application of a drug eluting stent which might be the best treatment in a non-cancer patient may not be feasible. In cancer patients with venous thromboembolism and bleeding the implantation of a vena cava filter might be necessary."
CD008201,0,16100192,0,Emerging strategies in the prevention of venous thromboembolism in hospitalized medical patients.,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients with acute medical illness. The high prevalence of VTE in this patient population, its clinically silent nature, and associated morbidity and mortality indicate that prophylactic therapy is appropriate in those determined to be at increased risk. Unfractionated heparin (UFH) and low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) have been shown to reduce the incidence of VTE and are the primary therapies used for prophylaxis in these patients. Although both UFH and LMWH have received grade 1A recommendations for the prevention of VTE in at-risk medical patients in the 2004 American College of Chest Physicians consensus conference statements, LMWH has advantages over UFH in its once-daily dosing scheme, reduced incidence of major and minor bleeding events, and reduced incidence of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. Fondaparinux is a novel antithrombotic agent characterized by specificity for factor Xa and a lack of platelet interaction. A recent clinical trial in hospitalized patients with acute medical illness found that fondaparinux significantly reduced the incidence of both VTE and fatal pulmonary embolism compared with placebo, without increased major bleeding. Despite the availability of effective thromboprophylactic therapies, VTE prophylaxis continues to be underutilized in hospitalized medical patients."

If pre-operative hemodilution is used in order to avoid the risks of transfusions of homologous blood, dextran must be used as the diluent. Patients undergoing total hip replacement represent a very high risk group where infusion of dextran is superior to low doses of heparin, but pre-operative hemodilution using dextran is more effective than infusions of dextran. It may thus be concluded that pre-operative hemodilution with dextran would give similar improved results in general surgery. As with all thromboprophylactic agents, side-effects may occur. However, with dextran 60, anaphylactoid reactions have note been described up to the present time in patients undergoing hemodilution before operation."

Recently published registries confirm under-prescription of VKA treatment in the 'real world', even in patients at high thromboembolic risk, and over-prescription for at least one-third of patients at low risk. Therefore reducing the risk of thromboembolism should be the physicians'primary aim, particularly with the advent of alternative treatments and the development of new antithrombotic drugs such as oral thrombin and factor Xa inhibitors, which are currently being evaluated in clinical trials."
CD008201,0,16315959,0,[The hepatic artery injection chemotherapy and prostaglandin E1 administration for hepatocellular carcinoma invading the biliary tract with jaundice].,"A 69-year-old man had radiofrequency ablation therapy (following RFA) for type C cirrhosis with hepatoma (following HCC) of S7 in November 2001. Afterward the patient was followed as an outpatient, but he had been admitted to our hospital due to jaundice confirmed in March 2004. His abdominal wall appeared to be soft and flat, and we could not detect a tumor mass by palpating either. Even though he exhibited no actual symptom of anemia, jaundice was found in the bulbar conjunctiva at the time of admission. Laboratory findings showed a mild inflammation and anemia on his admission, and biochemical data showed a rise of hepatobiliary enzyme with jaundice. A rise of tumor marker (AFP, PIVKA-II) was recognized, too. We performed percutaneous transhepatic bile duct drainage (following PTBD) to decrease jaundice because abdominal echography and CT showed an extension of tumor thrombosis in bile duct and right hepatic duct by HCC of S8. However, a check of T-Bil. was 7.29 mg/dl and showed some slight decrease. Therefore, we administered prostaglandin E1 (following PGE1) at first with an intra-arterial injection catheter aiming to protect the hepatocyte. One week later, we performed hepatic artery injection chemotherapy (CDDP+5-FU) for four weeks. We confirmed a manifested improvement in T-Bil to be 1.92 mg/dl at the end of hepatic artery injections as well as a manifested decrease in hepatobiliary enzyme. We confirmed a decrease of HCC of S8 by abdominal CT, and the response rate was PR. Afterward the patient was conservatively treated even though pancytopenia was present, and was discharged from the hospital in June 2004. The hepatic artery injection chemotherapy used together with PGE1 was effective for the HCC patient with jaundice."

CD008201,0,15006717,0,The safety of antithrombotic therapy during pregnancy.,"A number of clinical conditions can require the use of antithrombotic drugs during pregnancy. These mainly include prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and fetal complications in high-risk patients, treatment of VTE and prevention of arterial emboli in patients with mechanical heart valve prostheses. However, there are several problems when using antithrombotic drugs during pregnancy. Warfarin, as well as the other coumarin compounds, crosses the placenta and has the potential to cause both bleeding in the fetus and teratogenicity, therefore its use is not recommended during the first trimester and during the perinatal period. Unfractionated heparin (UFH) and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) do not cross the placenta and are safe for the fetus, but long-term treatment with UFH is problematic because of its inconvenient administration, the need to monitor anticoagulant activity and because of its potential side effects, such as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and osteoporosis. LMWH is the drug of choice in the prevention and treatment of VTE during pregnancy because of its practical advantages over UFH and because of a lower risk of side effects. Patients with mechanical heart valve prostheses represent a major clinical challenge. Warfarin, the drug of choice in non-pregnant women, can be administered between the 12th and 36th week. Full-dose UFH is recommended in the first trimester and after week 36. The use of LMWH as an alternative to UFH is still a matter of debate, because inadequate data are available."
CD008201,0,12597062,0,Thrombosis prophylaxis in orthopedic surgery: current clinical considerations.,"Thrombosis prophylaxis in orthopedic surgery is an important consideration in order to avoid the morbidity and mortality of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Patients who do not receive prophylaxis, or receive inadequate prophylaxis, may be at risk for clinical or fatal pulmonary emboli, and a fatality, although rare, may be the first sign of a VTE. Although the surgeon may have corrected the patient's orthopedic problem, a symptomatic or asymptomatic venous thrombosis may become a new threat to the patient's quality of life. This problem places such patients at risk for recurrent VTE, as well as post-thrombotic syndrome, a progressive, lifelong disability. Methods of prophylaxis that prevent the most clots result in the fewest venous thromboembolic events, but no one method of prophylaxis is suitable for all patients. In order to select the appropriate modality, a careful risk assessment of each patient is necessary. Those at low or moderate risk levels do not require the same modalities that may be used in a patient with a previous history of thrombosis or with many risk factors. The purpose of this brief review is to examine the complications associated with venous thromboembolism and to discuss, in detail, the risk of thrombosis in orthopedic patients. In addition, thrombosis prophylaxis modalities are discussed and suggestions made based on current Chest Consensus Guidelines and FDA-approved products."

The JUPITER study aimed to determine whether rosuvastatin 20 mg daily would reduce the rate of first major cardiovascular events, including cardiovascular death, nonfatal stroke, nonfatal myocardial infarction, hospitalization for unstable angina or arterial revascularization. Rosuvastatin reduced LDL-cholesterol levels by 50% and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein by 37%. Compared with placebo, the combined primary end point was reduced in 44% (p < 0.00001), and total mortality in 20% (p = 0.02). The trial confirmed the relationship between the rates of major cardiovascular events with both high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and LDL-cholesterol levels achieved after statin treatment.

CD008201,0,23486416,0,Catheter ablation in combination with left atrial appendage closure for atrial fibrillation.,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia, affecting millions of individuals worldwide. The rapid, irregular, and disordered electrical activity in the atria gives rise to palpitations, fatigue, dyspnea, chest pain and dizziness with or without syncope. Patients with AF have a five-fold higher risk of stroke. Oral anticoagulation (OAC) with warfarin is commonly used for stroke prevention in patients with AF and has been shown to reduce the risk of stroke by 64%. Warfarin therapy has several major disadvantages, however, including bleeding, non-tolerance, interactions with other medications and foods, non-compliance and a narrow therapeutic range. These issues, together with poor appreciation of the risk-benefit ratio, unawareness of guidelines, or absence of an OAC monitoring outpatient clinic may explain why only 30-60% of patients with AF are prescribed this drug. The problems associated with warfarin, combined with the limited efficacy and/or serious side effects associated with other medications used for AF, highlight the need for effective non-pharmacological approaches to treatment. One such approach is catheter ablation (CA), a procedure in which a radiofrequency electrical current is applied to regions of the heart to create small ablation lesions that electrically isolate potential AF triggers. CA is a well-established treatment for AF symptoms, that may also decrease the risk of stroke. Recent data showed a significant decrease in the relative risk of stroke and transient ischemic attack events among patients who underwent ablation compared with those undergoing antiarrhythmic drug therapy. Since the left atrial appendage (LAA) is the source of thrombi in more than 90% of patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation, another approach to stroke prevention is to physically block clots from exiting the LAA. One method for occluding the LAA is via percutaneous placement of the WATCHMAN LAA closure device. The WATCHMAN device resembles a small parachute. It consists of a nitinol frame covered by fabric polyethyl terephthalate that prevents emboli, but not blood, from exiting during the healing process. Fixation anchors around the perimeter secure the device in the LAA (Figure 1). To date, the WATCHMAN is the only implanted percutaneous device for which a randomized clinical trial has been reported. In this study, implantation of the WATCHMAN was found to be at least as effective as warfarin in preventing stroke (all-causes) and death (all-causes). This device received the Conformité Européenne (CE) mark for use in the European Union for warfarin eligible patients and in those who have a contraindication to anticoagulation therapy. Given the proven effectiveness of CA to alleviate AF symptoms and the promising data with regard to reduction of thromboembolic events with both CA and WATCHMAN implantation, combining the two procedures is hoped to further reduce the incidence of stroke in high-risk patients while simultaneously relieving symptoms. The combined procedure may eventually enable patients to undergo implantation of the WATCHMAN device without subsequent warfarin treatment, since the CA procedure itself reduces thromboembolic events. This would present an avenue of treatment previously unavailable to patients ineligible for warfarin treatment because of recurrent bleeding or other warfarin-associated problems. The combined procedure is performed under general anesthesia with biplane fluoroscopy and TEE guidance. Catheter ablation is followed by implantation of the WATCHMAN LAA closure device. Data from a non-randomized trial with 10 patients demonstrates that this procedure can be safely performed in patients with a CHADS2 score of greater than 1. Further studies to examine the effectiveness of the combined procedure in reducing symptoms from AF and associated stroke are therefore warranted."
CD008201,0,21060742,0,Korean guidelines for the prevention of venous thromboembolism.,"This guideline focuses on the primary prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in Korea. The guidelines should be individualized and aim at patients scheduled for major surgery, as well as patients with a history of trauma, high-risk pregnancy, cancer, or other severe medical illnesses. Currently, no nation-wide data on the incidence of VTE exist, and randomized controlled trials aiming at the prevention of VTE in Korea have yielded few results. Therefore, these guidelines were based on the second edition of the Japanese Guidelines for the Prevention of VTE and the eighth edition of the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) Evidenced-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines. These guidelines establish low-, moderate-, and high-risk groups, and recommend appropriate thromboprophylaxis for each group."

CD008201,0,10770732,0,Practice guidelines for diseases caused by Aspergillus. Infectious Diseases Society of America.,"Aspergillosis comprises a variety of manifestations of infection. These guidelines are directed to 3 principal entities: invasive aspergillosis, involving several organ systems (particularly pulmonary disease); pulmonary aspergilloma; and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. The recommendations are distilled in this summary, but the reader is encouraged to review the more extensive discussions in subsequent sections, which show the strength of the recommendations and the quality of the evidence, and the original publications cited in detail. Invasive aspergillosis. Because it is highly lethal in the immunocompromised host, even in the face of therapy, work-up must be prompt and aggressive, and therapy may need to be initiated upon suspicion of the diagnosis, without definitive proof (BIII). Intravenous therapy should be used initially in rapidly progressing disease (BIII). The largest therapeutic experience is with amphotericin B deoxycholate, which should be given at maximum tolerated doses (e.g., 1-1.5 mg/kg/d) and should be continued, despite modest increases in serum creatinine levels (BIII). Lipid formulations of amphotericin are indicated for the patient who has impaired renal function or who develops nephrotoxicity while receiving deoxycholate amphotericin (AII). Oral itraconazole is an alternative for patients who can take oral medication, are likely to be adherent, can be demonstrated (by serum level monitoring) to absorb the drug, and lack the potential for interaction with other drugs (BII). Oral itraconazole is attractive for continuing therapy in the patient who responds to initial iv therapy (CIII). Therapy should be prolonged beyond resolution of disease and reversible underlying predispositions (BIII). Adjunctive therapy (particularly surgery and combination chemotherapy, also immunotherapy), may be useful in certain situations (CIII). Aspergilloma. The optimal treatment strategy for aspergilloma is unknown. Therapy is predominantly directed at preventing life-threatening hemoptysis. Surgical removal of aspergilloma is definitive treatment, but because of significant morbidity and mortality it should be reserved for high-risk patients such as those with episodes of life-threatening hemoptysis, and considered for patients with underlying sarcoidosis, immunocompromised patients, and those with increasing Aspergillus-specific IgG titers (CIII). Surgical candidates would need to have adequate pulmonary function to undergo the operation. Bronchial artery embolization rarely produces a permanent success, but may be useful as a temporizing procedure in patients with life-threatening hemoptysis. Endobronchial and intracavitary instillation of antifungals or oral itraconazole may be useful for this condition. Since the majority of aspergillomas do not cause life-threatening hemoptysis, the morbidity and cost of treatment must be weighed against the clinical benefit. Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (APBA). Although no well-designed studies have been carried out, the available data support the use of corticosteroids for acute exacerbations of ABPA (AII). Neither the optimal corticosteroid dose nor the duration of therapy has been standardized, but limited data suggest the starting dose should be approximately 0.5 mg/kg/d of prednisone. The decision to taper corticosteroids should be made on an individual basis, depending on the clinical course (BIII). The available data suggest that clinical symptoms alone are inadequate to make such decisions, since significant lung damage may occur in asymptomatic patients. Increasing serum IgE levels, new or worsening infiltrate on chest radiograph, and worsening spirometry suggest that corticosteroids should be used (BII). Multiple asthmatic exacerbations in a patient with ABPA suggest that chronic corticosteroid therapy should be used (BIII). Itraconazole appears useful as a corticosteroid sparing agent (BII).

CD008201,0,22766512,0,Managing venous thromboembolism in Asia: winds of change in the era of new oral anticoagulants.,"Despite advances in the management of venous thromboembolism (VTE), treatment of many patients worldwide, especially in Asia, remains inadequate and/or discordant with prevailing guidelines. Although epidemiological studies consistently report lower incidences of VTE in Asians than Caucasians, VTE rates in Asia have probably been gravely underestimated, partly due to comparatively lesser ascertainment. It is becoming evident that Asians are at much higher risk of VTE than was hitherto supposed. Nevertheless, VTE risk-assessment is not routine in Asia and thromboprophylaxis rates are much lower than in Western nations. It is important to base decisions about anticoagulation on individual circumstances and weigh the potential benefits and risks. The conventional VTE management paradigm is not ideal. New oral anticoagulants offer advantages over current modalities that may help to streamline patient care and reduce healthcare costs. Initially, they will be mainly used in uncomplicated cases and, in the absence of clear differences in efficacy or safety, convenience, tolerability/adherence and cost will determine treatment choice. There is clear scope to improve VTE prevention and treatment in Asia. Key priorities are raising awareness of best practice and properly implementing guidelines. Uncertainty about the burden of VTE and concern about bleeding are barriers. High-quality Asian epidemiological data are needed to guide healthcare policy and evidence-based practice. More data on the occurrence and management of bleeding complications in Asian patients are also required. Meanwhile, physicians should remain vigilant and strive to act early, decisively and appropriately to diagnose and treat VTE, particularly in patients at high risk."
CD008201,0,14592562,0,Role of antiplatelet drugs in the prevention of cardiovascular events.,"Antiplatelet drugs have an established place in the prevention of vascular events in a variety of clinical conditions, such as myocardial infarction, stroke and cardiovascular death. Both European and American guidelines recommend the use of antiplatelet drugs in patients with established coronary heart disease and other atherosclerotic disease. In high-risk patients, such as those with post-acute myocardial infarction (AMI), ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack, and in patients with stable or unstable angina, peripheral arterial occlusive disease or atrial fibrillation, antiplatelet treatment may reduce the risk of a serious cardiovascular event by approximately 25%, including reduction of non-fatal myocardial infarction by 1/6, non-fatal stroke by 1/4 and cardiovascular death by 1/6. Some data indicate that antiplatelet drugs may also have a role in primary prevention. In people who are aged over 65 years, or have hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, diabetes, obesity or familial history of myocardial infarction at young age, aspirin may reduce both cardiovascular deaths and total cardiovascular events. Aspirin has been studied and used most extensively. It may exert its beneficial effect not only by acting on platelets, but also by other mechanisms, such as preventing thromboxane A2 (TXA2)-induced vasoconstriction or reducing inflammation. Indeed, experimental data show that low-dose aspirin may suppress vascular inflammation and thereby increase the stability of atherosclerotic plaque. Moreover, in human studies, aspirin seems to be most effective in those with elevated C-reactive protein levels. Vascular events, however, do occur despite aspirin administration. This may be due to platelet activation by pathways not blocked by aspirin, intake of drugs that interfere with aspirin effect or aspirin resistance. In the CAPRIE (Clopidogrel vs. Aspirin in Patients at Risk of Ischaemic Events) study, long-term clopidogrel administered to patients with atherosclerotic vascular disease was more effective than aspirin in reducing the combined risk of ischaemic stroke, myocardial infarction or vascular death. In the setting of coronary stenting, a double regimen including aspirin and ticlopidine or clopidogrel has proved more effective in the prevention of in-stent thrombosis than aspirin alone. Chronic oral administration of the inhibitors of platelet membrane receptor GP IIb/IIIa has been largely disappointing."

This retrospective study assessed the incidence of symptomatic venous thromboembolic (VTE) complications following a consecutive series of 2654 patients undergoing elective foot and ankle surgery. A total of 1078 patients received 75 mg aspirin as routine thromboprophylaxis between 2003 and 2006 and 1576 patients received no form of chemical thromboprophylaxis between 2007 and 2010. The overall incidence of VTE was 0.42% (DVT, 0.27%; PE, 0.15%) with 27 patients lost to follow-up. If these were included to create a worst case scenario, the overall VTE rate was 1.43%. There was no apparent protective effect against VTE by using aspirin. We conclude that the incidence of VTE following foot and ankle surgery is very low and routine use of chemoprophylaxis does not appear necessary for patients who are not in the high risk group for VTE."

CD008201,0,22695629,0,[Thromboembolic events in malignant diseases].,"There is a bidirectional connection between tumors and thrombosis. On one hand, thromboembolic events are more frequent in cases of malignancies, on the other hand, proliferation of tumor cells, progression of the malignant process and metastasis formation are facilitated by the activation of the hemostatic system. Thromboembolic events are associated with a worse prognosis in case of patients with malignant diseases. Thromboembolism is the second most frequent cause of death in patients with malignant tumors. Mortality is twice as high in patients with thromboembolism compared to those without it. The incidence of thromboembolism shows an increasing tendency. There has been a 28% increase among hospitalized cancer patients between 1995 and 2003. One reason is that the new anti-tumor agents have more pronounced prothrombotic activity than those of traditional chemotherapeutic drugs. Assessment of the thrombotic risk of cancer patients becomes more important. Several guidelines have been published concerning the prevention and treatment of thromboembolism in patients with malignancy. The risk of thrombosis is influenced not only by the type of malignancy but there are also large individual differences. Furthermore, the risk of thrombosis changes during the disease process in the same patient. Perioperative thromboprophylaxis is a very important issue considering oncologic surgery. Thromboprophylaxis of oncologic patients has a high significance in respect of morbidity and mortality. However, thromboprophylaxis may also cause serious complications thus the correct risk assessment of cancer patients is very important."

CD008201,0,17895502,0,Outpatient-based primary and secondary thromboprophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin.,"Although oral vitamin K antagonists such as warfarin have been the mainstay of thromboprophylaxis in the outpatient setting, warfarin has potential disadvantages, including food and drug interactions, the need for drug monitoring, intolerance, failure, and hypersensitivity syndromes. The use of low-molecular-weight heparin as a primary or secondary thromboprophylactic drug in the outpatient setting for extended prophylaxis or as outpatient bridging therapy has been addressed less extensively. Available evidence shows that low-molecular-weight heparin can be used as extended outpatient-based primary thromboprophylaxis for major orthopedic and cancer surgery and is a safe and effective alternative to warfarin in long-term secondary thromboprophylaxis, especially in cancer patients and in pregnant women. Low-molecular-weight heparin can also be used as an alternative to unfractionated heparin as outpatient-based bridging therapy. In addition to good clinical outcomes and financial benefits, mainly resulting from a reduction in the length of hospital stay, the use of extended-duration low-molecular-weight heparin in the outpatient setting appears to be feasible, with high patient compliance."
CD008201,0,19903422,0,Gastric acid inhibition in the treatment of peptic ulcer hemorrhage.,"Upper gastrointestinal bleeding from peptic ulcer disease is a common clinical event, resulting in considerable patient morbidity and significant health care costs. Inhibiting gastric acid secretion is a key component in improving clinical outcomes, including reducing rebleeding, transfusion requirements, and surgery. Raising intragastric pH promotes clot stability and reduces the influences of gastric acid and pepsin. Patients with high-risk stigmata for ulcer bleeding (arterial bleeding, nonbleeding visible vessels, and adherent clots) benefit significantly from and should receive high-dose intravenous proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) after successful endoscopic hemostasis. For patients with low-risk stigmata (flat spots or clean ulcer base), oral PPI therapy alone is sufficient. For oozing bleeding (an intermediate risk finding), successful endoscopic hemostasis and oral PPI are recommended. Using intravenous PPIs before endoscopy appears to reduce the frequency of finding high-risk stigmata on later endoscopy, but has not been shown to improve clinical outcomes. High-dose oral PPIs may be as effective as intravenous infusion in achieving positive clinical outcomes, but this has not been documented by randomized studies and its cost-effectiveness is unclear."

Our institution developed an inpatient protocol with reduced enoxaparin doses (0.75 mg/kg/dose based on actual body weight) for patients with a weight >200 kg or BMI > 40 kg/m(2). The primary objective was to determine if modified enoxaparin treatment doses would achieve therapeutic anti-Xa levels (goal range 0.6-1.0 IU/mL) in morbidly obese patients. Thirty-one patients were included in our study and had a median body weight of 138 kg (range 105-197) and a median BMI of 46.2 kg/m(2) (range 40.1-62). The initial peak anti-Xa levels were in therapeutic range in 15 of 31 patients (48 %) with an initial mean anti-Xa level of 0.92 IU/mL. Twenty-four patients (77 %) achieved therapeutic anti-Xa levels in goal range during their hospitalization, with a mean enoxaparin dose of 0.71 mg/kg. Bleeding and thrombotic events were minimal and all patients that achieved an anti-Xa level in goal range did so with a dose less than 1 mg/kg of enoxaparin."
CD008201,0,19188717,0,Modern endoscopic therapy of peptic ulcer bleeding.,"Acute upper gastrointestinal bleed (UGIB) remains a challenging clinical problem owing to significant patient morbidity and costs involved with management. Peptic ulcer bleeding (PUB) contributes to the majority of causes of UGIB with a growing concern of its impact on the elderly and the increasing use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs as precipitating bleeding episodes. Apart from initial critical care, endoscopy is the preferred first-line management of PUB. Early use of empirical high-dose proton pump inhibitor therapy prior, during and after endoscopy is cost-effective and reduces the need for endotherapy. Current endoscopic modalities, both thermal and non-thermal, offer a wide range of choices in high-risk PUB (active arterial bleeding or non-bleeding visible vessel). Combinations of injection (epinephrine) along with thermal therapy or endoclips are recommended for better clinical outcomes. The role of endotherapy for adherent clots is controversial. A second-look endoscopy may be beneficial in high-risk patients. A multidisciplinary team approach should be part of all treatment protocols for the ideal management of UGIB."

CD008201,0,19652883,0,Clinical and economic outcomes in patients at risk of venous thromboembolism receiving appropriate enoxaparin or unfractionated heparin prophylaxis.,"Clinical and economic outcomes were compared following appropriate prophylaxis with enoxaparin or unfractionated heparin (UFH) in a large, real-world population of US hospitalised medical and surgical patients at risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Discharges from the Thomson Reuters MarketScan Hospital Drug Database (January 2004-March 2007) of patients aged > or =40 years, at risk of VTE according to the 7(th) American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) guidelines, who spent > or =6 days in hospital and received appropriate ACCP-recommended enoxaparin or UFH prophylaxis were included. Patients with contraindications to anticoagulation were excluded. Hospital-acquired VTE, adverse events, and hospital costs for enoxaparin versus UFH were compared using univariate and multivariate analyses. Of the 5,136 discharges included, 4,014 (78%) received enoxaparin and 1,122 (22%) received UFH. Compared with UFH, enoxaparin was associated with significantly lower risk of hospital-acquired VTE (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.51, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.30-0.86, p = 0.012), pulmonary embolism (adjusted OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.14-0.79, p = 0.013) or adverse events (adjusted OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.54-0.98, p = 0.034). Total hospital costs per discharge were lower for enoxaparin (US $16,865 +/- 10,979) than UFH (US $19,252 +/- 14,970), with a mean difference of US $2,388 in favour of enoxaparin (p < 0.001) (adjusted difference US $439, 95% CI US $ -39 to 909, p = 0.072). In patients at risk of VTE, appropriate enoxaparin prophylaxis was associated with a reduction in hospital-acquired VTE, adverse events, and costs compared with appropriate UFH prophylaxis. Increased appropriate use of enoxaparin in patients at risk of VTE may help to reduce the clinical and economic burden of this condition."

CD008201,0,21667203,0,Performance measures for improving the prevention of venous thromboembolism: achievement in clinical practice.,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common complication during and after hospitalization for acute medical illness or surgery. Despite the existence of evidence-based guidelines for VTE prevention, real-world prescribing practices are frequently suboptimal. Specific performance measures relating to VTE prevention and treatment have been developed by US health care organizations to increase adherence with best-practice recommendations and ultimately reduce the number of preventable VTE events. Two measures developed by the Surgical Care Improvement Project have been endorsed by the National Quality Forum (NQF) and focus on VTE prevention. In addition, six measures have been developed recently by The Joint Commission in collaboration with the NQF; three measures relate to VTE prevention and three focus on treatment. To attain widespread achievement of these performance goals, it is essential to raise awareness of their existence and specifications. It is also imperative that hospitals develop and implement effective VTE protocols. The use of multiple, active strategies, such as computer decision support systems with regular audit and feedback, may be particularly valuable approaches to improve current practices within an integrated quality improvement program. During practical implementation of VTE protocols at Norton Healthcare (Kentucky's largest healthcare system), strong leadership, physician engagement, and caregiver accountability were identified as key factors influencing the process. As such, more hospitals may be able to increase adherence with guidelines, improve achievement of quality goals, and help to reduce the substantial burden associated with avoidable VTE."

Advances in cardiac surgery has improved quality of life and level of functioning of cardiovascular system of patients with congenital or acquired heart disease. These diseases complicate 0.1-4 % pregnancies. Maternal complications in the form of thromboembolic, hemorrhagic episode and heart failure may occur. The fetus is in danger of effects of oral anticoagulation therapy and other medications given to the patient in order to support cardiovascular system, intrauterine growth restriction and danger of hypoxia. In recent era, we are facing more pregnant patients with previous history of surgical correction of congenital or rheumatic heart disease. In this review, we have attempted to draw a management protocol of such patients based on the available literature and various international guidelines. In pregnant women with mechanical heart valves, recent data support warfarin use throughout pregnancy, followed by a switch to heparin and planned induction of labor. However, the complexity of this situation demands a cafeteria approach where the patient herself can choose from the available options that are supported by evidence-based information. Preconception counseling, evaluation and antenatal high-risk management protocol with the help of cardiologist and cardiac surgeon improves maternal and neonatal outcome."

CD008201,0,17059417,0,Extended duration of thromboprophylaxis in acutely ill medical patients: optimizing therapy?,"Summary. Patients who are hospitalized for an acute medical illness are at risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Current evidence-based guidelines recommend prophylaxis with unfractionated heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin in acutely ill medical patients who are admitted to hospital with congestive heart failure, severe respiratory disease, or who are bedridden with an additional VTE risk factor. The need for thromboprophylaxis is therefore clear in this patient population; however, the optimal duration of prophylaxis in these patients is less clear. In patients undergoing orthopedic or cancer surgery, extended-duration prophylaxis has been shown to be superior to placebo. To date, however, no large-scale clinical trials have assessed the benefits of extended-duration prophylaxis in acutely ill medical patients. This review therefore focuses on the VTE risk profile of acutely ill medical patients, examines the currently available literature for evidence of a potential benefit of extended-duration prophylaxis in these patients, and provides a rationale for the testing of such a hypothesis in a randomized clinical trial."

CD008201,0,22959493,0,[Diabetes and Ramadan].,"Ramadan, one of the five pillars of Islam, is a holy month for Muslims. During this month, they have a duty to fast every day from sunrise to sunset. This religion spares diabetics and persons with chronic illnesses from this duty, because lack of eating and drinking all the day has many bad consequences on their health. But, because of a very strong habit, by solidarity with the family, or by fear of exclusion from the society, many diabetics insist on fasting as demonstrated by numerous studies. The problem is, when they fast, diabetics are at risk from complications such as severe hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, ketoacidosis, dehydration and thrombosis. To avoid this, consensus and recommendations have emerged in order to develop new approaches that would minimize the various complications. It appears from different recommendations that only diabetics whose equilibrium is stable, free of degenerative complications, and able to manage properly their diseases will be allowed to fast. The physician's role is to assist the faithful person to Ramadan by raising awareness of lifestyle and dietary rules, daily self-monitoring, and a new adjustment of treatment."

CD008201,0,22994561,0,Ethical issues related to screening for preeclampsia.,"The implementation of new methods of treating and preventing disease raises many question of both technical and moral character. Currently, many studies focus on developing a screening test for preeclampsia (PE), a disease complicating 2-8% of pregnancies, potentially causing severe consequences for pregnant women and their fetuses. The purpose is to develop a test that can identify pregnancies at high risk for developing PE sufficiently early in pregnancy to allow for prophylaxis. However, the question of implementing a screening test for PE does not only involve an evaluation of technical feasibility and clinical efficacy, it also requires an analysis of how the test influences the conditions and choices for those tested. This study evaluates state-of-the-art techniques for preeclampsia screening in an ethical framework, pointing out the central areas of moral relevance within the context of such screening activity. Furthermore, we propose ethical guidelines that a screening programme for PE should meet in order to become an uncontroversial addition to prenatal health care."

CD008201,0,20362347,0,Should all patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation be anticoagulated?,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia encountered in clinical practice. The prevalence and incidence of AF are rising, as confirmed in several European and American registries. Guidelines published in 2008 from the European Society of Cardiology/American Heart Association and from the American College of Chest Physicians, clarified the strategy of antithrombotic treatment in AF, which is based on the presence of risk factors for thromboembolism. This approach allows physicians to classify patients as at low, moderate or high risk, according to their individual risk characteristics, which are relatively similar in both sets of recommendations. Patients at moderate risk, however, who might justify anticoagulant or antiplatelet treatment, could be better characterized using morphological (echocardiographic) and/or biological factors or risk markers. Recent data have shown that the existence of a thrombogenic milieu in the left atrium (e.g., dilatation of the left atrial appendage and/or thrombus and/or spontaneous echocontrast and/or reduced emptying/filling flow velocity) indicates a higher risk of embolism and mortality. Furthermore, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and haemostasis markers of coagulation are associated with thromboembolic risk and excess mortality in AF. Although current recommendations for the management of AF are not based on such markers, both could help physicians choose the optimal antithrombotic treatment (either vitamin K antagonists or antiplatelet drugs) according to the patient's specific risk profile. Nowadays, registries confirm under-prescription of vitamin K antagonist treatment in the 'real world,' even in patients at high thromboembolic risk, and over-prescription for at least one-third of low-risk patients. It is crucially important to realize that the risk of bleeding in patients with risk factors (e.g., older age, hypertension) is close to the risk of thromboembolism, which can have devastating outcomes in patients in AF. Alternative and efficient strategies (new oral anticoagulants, non-surgical closure of the left atrial appendage using percutaneous devices) are currently under investigation. Therefore reducing the risk of thromboembolism should be physicians' primary aim, particularly with the advent of alternative treatments and the development of new antithrombotic drugs such as oral thrombin and factor Xa inhibitors, which are currently being evaluated in clinical trials."

Invasive therapies such as catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) and/or mechanical thrombectomy with or without angioplasty and stenting and in some cases open operative thrombectomy improves venous patency, venous valve function, and quality of life in patients with acute iliofemoral DVT. What is the current frequency of acute iliofemoral DVT and how aggressively is it being treated?

CD008201,0,10947919,0,Stent thrombosis: historical perspectives and current trends.,"Coronary stents are now implanted in more than 70% of percutaneous coronary revascularization procedures. Early enthusiasm for improved acute angiographic results and limited restenosis was dampened initially by a high rate of stent thrombosis and later by the increased bleeding complications of aggressive and complex anticoagulation protocols designed to lower the stent thrombosis risk. More recently, routine high-pressure deployment strategies and anti-platelet drug regimens have lowered the incidence of stent thrombosis to approximately 1% without an increased bleeding risk. The timing of stent thrombosis has also changed from a median of 4-5 days to a median of 1 day after the stent procedure. Risk factors in earlier studies included stenting for threatened or abrupt closure, smaller vessels, longer lesions, and possibly left anterior descending artery lesion location. Modern studies have shown a slightly increased risk for multiple stent use, residual dissection, and smaller final lumen. Optimal therapy for stent thrombosis includes emergent revascularization and anti-thrombotic treatment, although the clinical consequences remain dire despite successful reperfusion. The use of platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors, especially in high-risk situations may further reduce the incidence of stent thrombosis."
CD008201,0,16567739,0,An overview of oral contraceptives: mechanism of action and clinical use.,"Hormonal contraception is available in oral contraceptive pills and in newer formulations, including the transdermal patch, the vaginal ring, subcutaneous implants, and IM injections. Prevention of pregnancy is achieved by inhibiting ovulation, fertilization, and/or implantation of an egg. Hormonal contraception provides effective, tolerable, and reversible prevention of pregnancy. Efficacy and safety profiles are similar for different formulations and administration routes. Lowest expected failure (i.e., method failure) rates for hormonal contraceptives, regardless of formulation, are <2%. Typical failure rates for oral formulations range from <3% to 5% due to failures in compliance. The most commonly reported adverse effects are weight gain, nausea, variations in menstrual flow, breast changes such as tenderness, discomfort, or swelling, depression or mood disturbances, decreased sexual desire or response, and acne. Rare but serious potential effects include cardiovascular diseases, such as stroke, and an increased risk for breast cancer, liver tumors, and gallbladder disease. Hormonal contraceptive use should be avoided in women at risk for blood clots, by heavy smokers, and in women with breast or other cancers. Use of hormonal contraception in adolescents requires special consideration, in part because of decreased compliance."

CD008201,0,23538102,0,[Management of infection risk in asplenic patients].,"Each year in France 6000 to 9000 patients are splenectomised or spleen embolized. As spleen has immunological functions, it contributes to protect against infections. Thus, hypo or asplenia increase the risk of infection, especially the risk of Overwhelming Post-Splenectomy Infection (OPSI). OPSI is a medical emergency, characterized by aspecific symptoms, which may rapidly progress to fulminant infection and death in 50% of cases within 48 h. Encapsulated bacteria as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria meningitidis are most of the time responsible of these infections in asplenic patients. To prevent OPSI, several measures are essential and must begin before a scheduled surgery or just after an urgent splenectomy. Patients must carry a card. The first proposed prevention measure is to enhance partial surgery when it's possible. Then, the two other measures, antibiotic prophylaxis and vaccination, shall be implemented whatever is the indication of surgery. Postoperative antibiotic prophylaxis by phenoxymethyl-penicillin is prescribed for two years minimum and lifelong prophylaxis should be offered to high risk of pneumococcal infection patients. Pneumococcal, H. influenzae type b and meningococcal vaccination should be administered 2 to 6 weeks before scheduled splenectomy and 2 weeks after urgent surgery. Yearly, patients must receive Influenza vaccination. As an interindividual variation exists in vaccinal response, measurement of serotype-specific antibodies can be used, if available, to individualized risk patients and to organize revaccination. Finally, to prevent OPSI, patient and next-of-kin must be educated about prevention measures and infectious risk to optimize patient's compliance."

The risk is increased in women older than 35 years and those with obesity, previous VTE, operative delivery, and underlying thrombophilia. Anticoagulant therapy is indicated for short-term treatment of VTE and as thromboprophylaxis in high-risk patients. Warfarin is contraindicated during the first trimester because of fetotoxicity; unfractionated heparin (UFH) is associated with practical disadvantages and a risk of heparin-induced thrombocytopoenia (HIT) and osteoporosis with long-term use. Low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs) are convenient to use, do not cross the placenta, carry a lower risk of HIT and osteoporosis, and have been shown to be safe and effective during treatment of approximately 500 pregnant women. LMHWs are increasingly replacing UFH as the anticoagulant of choice during pregnancy; further studies are required to determine optimal therapeutic and thromboprophylactic doses. Women with inherited or acquired thrombophilia are at increased risk of severe pregnancy complications, including recurrent miscarriage, pre-eclampsia, fetal growth restriction, abruptio placentae, and stillbirth; uteroplacental microvascular thrombosis caused by thrombophilia appears to be the pathophysiologic link.

Epidemiology of thrombosis in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common childhood malignancy. With the advent of aggressive multimodality therapy, ALL has become a curable disease for majority of pediatric patients. Thromboembolism (TE) is a well-recognized serious complication in association with ALL leading to significant morbidity. It can be potentially fatal in over 50% of the affected patients. Development of TE does interfere with the scheduled treatment plan for ALL and, thus, ultimate outcome from ALL. Recent evidence indicates that concomitant administration of asparaginase and steroids is likely to be associated with higher incidence of TE, especially in children with at least one prothrombotic risk factor. In addition, older children and patients with high risk ALL may be at higher risk for developing TE. However, the epidemiology and the exact pathogenesis of this entity have not yet been clearly defined. To reduce the incidence of TE and its impact on overall outcome as well as on the quality of life in children undergoing treatment for ALL, further studies to define the epidemiology of TE in relation to the biology of ALL and chemotherapy protocols are urgently needed. The purpose of this review is to evaluate the current knowledge of TE in association with ALL in children, especially in relation with the treatment protocols and genetic background. This review will be published in three parts. The first part will review the available information regarding epidemiology of TE in children with ALL."
CD008201,0,20008212,0,"Prevention of venous thromboembolism: consensus, controversies, and challenges.","The last 50 years have witnessed a multitude of publications evaluating the efficacy, safety and cost effectiveness of many different thromboprophylaxis interventions. There is widespread consensus that thromboprophylaxis safely reduces morbidity and mortality. More than 25 evidence-based guidelines, published since 1986, also recommend routine thromboprophylaxis in the majority of hospitalized patients. As a result, thromboprophylaxis is recognized as a key safety priority for hospitals. Some of the remaining areas of controversy that will be discussed in this paper include the role of individual risk assessments to determine thrombosis risk and prophylaxis, replacement of low-dose heparin by low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), the optimal duration of prophylaxis, the role of combined thromboprophylaxis modalities, the safety of anticoagulant prophylaxis with regional analgesia, the use of LMWHs in chronic renal insufficiency, and the emerging role of new oral anticoagulants as thromboprophylactic agents. Despite the overwhelming evidence supporting thromboprophylaxis, rates of thromboprophylaxis use remain far from optimal. Successful implementation strategies to bridge this knowledge:care gap are the most important current challenges in this area. These strategies must be multifaceted, utilizing local, systems-based approaches as well as legislation and incentives that reinforce best practices."

The evaluation identified a number of areas for improving current practice. Guideline implementation is a complex, time-consuming process."
CD008201,0,23797530,0,[Periprocedual management of vitamin K antagonist's with low molecular weight heparins during invasive procedures--Consensus of experts].,"Interruption of an ongoing therapy with vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) is necessary in almost all patients undergoing major surgery. The purpose of the following expert recommendations is to provide easy to use guidance for the periprocedural management of patients on VKAs based on current evidence from the literature. Management of anticoagulation during the time of interruption of VKAs is based on balancing the thromboembolic (TE) risk of underlying conditions against the bleeding risk of the surgical procedure. VKAs should be stopped 3–7days prior to surgery. Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is used to cover (“bridge”) the progressive pre-operative loss of anticoagulation and the slow post-operative onset of anticoagulant activity of VKAs. Patients with high risk of TE should receive a therapeutic dose of LMWH, patients with a moderate risk of TE should receive half of this dose. Patients with a low risk of TE do not need bridging therapy with LMWH. In case of an uneventful postoperative course, patients with a therapeutic pre-operative dose should be treated post-operatively with the same dose, starting on day 4 in case of major surgery and on day 2 in case of minor procedures. Patients with a half-therapeutic preoperative dose should be treated post-operatively with the same dose, starting on day 3 in case of major surgery and on day 1 in case of minor procedures. Therapy with VKAs should be re-instituted on the second post-operative day based on the preoperative dosage. Procedure-related post-operative thromboprophylaxis should be given irrespective of these recommendations on days without “bridging” anticoagulation."
CD008201,0,21103665,0,ABO blood group as a potential risk factor for venous thromboembolism in acutely injured patients.,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a major health problem that results in a significant burden on hospitals and patients. VTE screening and prophylaxis protocols in trauma patients vary significantly among hospitals and providers. In addition, many patients develop VTE even in the absence of ""high-risk"" categories. Therefore, more research is needed to better understand and prevent VTE in these patients. ABO blood group has long been recognised as a risk factor for VTE, but its contribution to VTE risk in the trauma setting is poorly studied. This paper reviews the literature describing the link between ABO blood group and VTE risk and the implications for VTE screening and prophylaxis in trauma patients. The effect of ABO blood groups are genotype-dependent - in most populations the A1 allele and the B allele increase risk while A2, O1, and O2 decrease risk of VTE. ABO group is a major determinant of plasma von Willebrand factor (vWF) and factor VIII levels, thereby (partially) mediating the effects of ABO blood group on VTE susceptibility. In addition, ABH antigens alter plasma levels of vWF via clearance mechanisms, which are in turn mediated by ADAMTS13. ABO blood group is a risk factor for VTE that warrants further investigation in trauma patients."

We present herein a rare case of a young woman heterozygous for these mutations and taking oral contraceptive pills for less than 2 months, diagnosed to have massive deep venous thrombosis and bilateral pulmonary embolism. The patient was managed for 10 days in the hospital and discharged home on oral anticoagulants. This case suggests that screening for these factors in people with family history of thrombosis and in relatives of patients with these mutations is highly recommended to prevent fatal consequences. In addition, a new guideline for treatment and prophylaxis with anticoagulant for these patients and others who are at risk of developing VTE (American College of Chest Physicians [ACCP] guidelines-Chest 2008) has been published recently. Our recommendation is to promote for the internationally published algorithms through their application, where necessary, to prevent any future thrombotic morbidity or mortality incidents."

This was a retrospective audit of 200 consecutive patients undergoing caesarean section between January and March 2002. The study was carried out at two obstetric units in Hull. We evaluated the proportion of patients requiring prophylaxis, appropriate and inappropriate treatment given and those omitted from receiving prophylaxis. Adherence to a risk assessment protocol was also assessed. The majority of women (84.5%) had at least one risk factor for thromboembolism. Use of a checklist did not increase the appropriate use of thromboprophylaxis and did not reduce inappropriate use. The checklist was used appropriately in only 54% of cases. Thromboprophylaxis has not been associated with problems if given after operation, thus the inappropriate administration is probably not a serious mistake. Universal prophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin would prevent at-risk women being missed and should be considered."
CD008201,0,18023721,0,Bleeding and thrombosis in acute leukemia: what does the future of therapy look like?,"Bleeding and thrombosis are major risk factors for early death in patients with acute leukemia; chemotherapy increases the likelihood of both of these complications. Patients with acute leukemia often present with a hypercoagulable state or with evidence for chronic disseminated intravascular coagulation, even in the absence of active thrombosis and/or bleeding. Leukemic cell procoagulant properties, cytotoxic therapies, and concomitant infections are major determinants of clotting activation in acute leukemia. Clinical manifestations range from localized venous or arterial thrombosis to diffuse life-threatening bleeding. All-trans retinoic acid has greatly improved the management of acute promyelocytic leukemia, but has not significantly changed the rate of early hemorrhagic deaths and may actually promote thrombosis. Randomized, controlled trials of different prophylactic regimens to prevent thrombosis and/or bleeding in acute leukemia are urgently needed, particularly in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia. Anticoagulant therapy is a unique challenge in patients with acute leukemia, who are at high risk for hemorrhage. Although no guidelines are available for prophylaxis or treatment of thrombosis, extrapolation can be made from existing guidelines for management of patients with other malignancies prolonged periods of treatment-induced thrombocytopenia in patients with acute leukemia, however, require a more judicious application of standard anticoagulant approaches. Use of the newer anticoagulants will require careful assessment of hemorrhagic risk in this group of high risk patients but may be justified under special circumstances."
CD008201,0,12232825,0,Thromboprophylaxis in medical patients: focus on France.,"In 2000, the French authorities licensed the low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) enoxaparin for thromboprophylaxis in acutely ill medical patients. However, the lack of official recommendations for this group of patients has contributed to inappropriate use of LMWH. The recent College of Internal Medicine of Paris (CIMOP) and Données Epidémiologiques chez les Patients A Risque Thromboembolique (DEPART) epidemiological studies have confirmed that LMWH is prescribed for 32% of medical inpatients and up to 44% of outpatients. However, they highlight overuse in elderly bedridden patients without acute illness and underuse in patients with severe infections or cardiopulmonary disease. Guidelines are urgently needed to encourage French physicians to target thromboprophylaxis for medical patients who are genuinely at high risk of thromboembolic disease and to prescribe the appropriate dose and duration of therapy."

Effective and safe thromboprophylaxis is highly desirable to prevent DVT. Low-dose heparin (LDH) and sequential compression device (SCDs) are the most frequently used methods.

CD008201,0,14610663,0,Prevention of venous thromboembolism in spinal surgery.,"Deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and its most feared complication, pulmonary embolism (PE), still have a high incidence with high risk for patients' health. Proven prophylactic measures are available but are generally underused, and DVT is still considered the most common cause of preventable death among hospitalized patients. The rationale for prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism is based on the clinically silent nature of the disease, the relatively high prevalence among hospitalized patients and the potentially tragic consequences of a missed diagnosis. During the last 15-20 years, spine surgery has changed radically, developing into a well-defined area of specialist surgery, and some attention is now being given to DVT events in spine surgery. The incidence of DVT during spine surgery is not documented in the literature, because only case reports or retrospective studies are reported. It would therefore be very helpful to initiate a multicenter study in order to understand this problem better and to develop, if possible, some guidelines on prophylactic measures in spine surgery. In doing so, we need to consider each patient's pattern, any risk factors and every kind of surgical technique related to DVT, in order to improve the outcome of the patient and to reduce any medicolegal problems that could arise from a thrombotic complication or an epidural hematoma, with its high potential for irreversible consequences."
CD008201,0,25380051,0,Rationale and study design of the RESERVOIR trial: a randomized trial comparing reservoir-based polymer-free amphilimus-eluting stents versus everolimus-eluting stents with durable polymer in patients with diabetes mellitus.,Patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) remain at high risk for stent restenosis and adverse cardiovascular events in the drug-eluting stent era. The amphilimus-eluting stent (AES) is a third generation reservoir-based polymer-free drug-eluting stent that has shown promising preliminary results in patients with DM. It has been suggested that the formulation of the drug with fatty acids could not only modulate the drug release in a timely manner but also achieve convenient levels of drug concentration in diabetic cardiac cells. The aim of this trial is to assess the efficacy of the AES in patients with DM compared with the cobalt chromium everolimus-eluting stent with non-erodible polymer (EES).

CD008201,0,20528853,0,The use of bivalirudin for cardiopulmonary bypass anticoagulation in pediatric heparin-induced thrombocytopenia patients.,"Infants with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) represent a challenging and high-risk group of patients when they require cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Bivalirudin offers many potential pharmacologic advantages over other nonheparin anticoagulants for such patients. We describe our protocol for the use of bivalirudin in a 5-month-old infant undergoing stage 2 Norwood for hypoplastic left heart syndrome. The patient was a 5- month-old, 6-kg infant who developed HIT after a bowel resection complicating initial Norwood stage 1. After sternotomy and dissection had been redone, the child received an initial dose of bivalirudin of 1.0 mg/kg and 0.5 mg/kg 5 min later. The CPB circuit was primed with 50 mg/kg bivalirudn/400 cc volume. With the initiation of CPB, a continuous infusion of 2.5 mg/kg bivalirudin was begun. Activated clotting time (ACT) was targeted for over 400 s, with an examination prior to bypass and each 15 min thereafter. Bivalirudin was discontinued with separation from bypass and during modified ultrafiltration (MUF). The ACT was 286 s after the initial 1 mg/kg bolus and 597 s after the second 0.5 mg/kg bolus and initiation of CPB. At a rate of 2.5 mg/kg/min, ACT ranged between 461 and 597 s. At the completion of MUF, the ACT was 316 s. The ACT was 214 s 20 min after MUF. No clots were noted in the CPB circuit, and good hemostasis was achieved within 10 min after MUF was completed. Incision to closure time was 160 min; time from completion of MUF to sternal closure was 30 min. Post-MUF, 60 cc of processed cell saver blood was reinfused, and no clotting factors were required. Chest tube output was 10, 10, 3, and 4 ccs, respectively, at hours 1-4 post operation. Bivalirudin provides effective anticoagulation in infants requiring CPB in the presence of HIT. Bivalirudin's efficacy is effectively monitored by ACT, and, after CPB, its short half-life and ability to be ultrafiltered facilitate the ability to achieve hemostasis in a timely fashion."
CD008201,0,10069758,0,Long-term prophylaxis in venous thromboembolism: LMWH or oral anticoagulation?,"Warfarin remains the standard drug for secondary prophylaxis following venous thromboembolism, however this treatment is not ideal. In patients for whom monitoring is problematic or who have a high risk of bleeding complications, other possible solutions have been explored. Unfractionated heparin has been used to a limited extent in these situations and requires dose adjustment in order to achieve an acceptable efficacy. Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is a valuable alternative to warfarin for these patients and for thromboprophylaxis during pregnancy. In several subgroups of patients with venous thromboembolism the use of a LMWH instead of warfarin could offer specific advantages. The combination of warfarin and LMWH is warranted in patients for whom it is predicted that warfarin treatment alone may fail. The optimal dose of LMWH in long-term prophylaxis has not been evaluated in a properly designed study and the optimal duration of prophylaxis with LMWH is thought to be similar to that for warfarin."
CD008201,0,19367228,0,Significant gastrointestinal bleeding in patients at risk of coronary stent thrombosis.,"The evolution of drug-eluting stents (DES), effective periprocedural antithrombotic therapy, and advanced interventional techniques have fueled the surge of percutaneous coronary interventions. Stent thrombosis remains a serious complication of coronary artery stent implantation. Long-term antiplatelet therapy is required to prevent stent thrombosis, especially following DES implantation. Discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy (particularly clopidogrel) is the strongest independent risk factor for the development of stent thrombosis. Bleeding complications, most of which arise from the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract, are the major limiting factors for antiplatelet therapy. The association of aspirin with the increased risk of upper GI bleeding has been well established. Peptic ulcer bleeding and Helicobacter pylori infection are the 2 most important risk factors for aspirin-associated GI bleeding complications. Endoscopy (for both surveillance and potential intervention), performed either emergently or semi-electively, is the primary tool for definitive management of GI bleeding. Considering the increase in GI bleeding risk seen with prolonged antiplatelet therapy, adjunctive proton pump inhibitor therapy and/or eradication of H. pylori infection might be beneficial for DES patients on long-term antiplatelet therapy."

CD008201,0,10391528,0,Anticoagulant therapy in pregnancy.,"Anticoagulation during pregnancy should derive benefit from recent advances in anticoagulant therapy. Unfractionated heparin is at present the drug of choice for most of the indications of thromboprophylaxis as well as for acute venous thrombosis during pregnancy but it is likely that, in the near future, low molecular weight heparins will supercede this anticoagulant in many indications. One particular indication is mechanical heart valves that needs a high degree of anticoagulation. The anticoagulant of choice that carries the best efficacy-risk ratio in this situation seems to be oral anticoagulants. Pregnant women receiving anticoagulation should be considered as high-risk patients that should be managed in specialized centres. They are prone to bleeding complications that will mainly occur during delivery or in the postpartum period."

Thromboprophylaxis is the most readily implementable means of systematically reducing the maternal death rate, and protocols that identify at-risk women have led to a significant reduction in maternal deaths from VTE. Strategies to prevent VTE require minimal resources. A multidisciplinary working group convened as part of American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists' District II Safe Motherhood Initiative reviewed research evidence and major society thromboprophylaxis guidelines and identified clinical strategies to reduce maternal VTE risk.

However, no guidance was provided as to what ""highly selected"" meant. This caveat is, however, important as up to 95% of asymptomatic individuals undergoing prophylactic CEA or CAS will ultimately undergo an unnecessary procedure. Even if the procedural risk following CEA or CAS could be reduced to 0%; 93% of patients would still undergo an unnecessary intervention. This, coupled with growing awareness that the risk of stroke in medically treated patients appears to be diminishing, has led to a renewed drive towards identifying patients with the highest risk of suffering a stroke whilst on medical therapy in whom to target CEA/CAS."
CD008201,0,22308809,0,[Secondary prevention of venous thromboembolism in patients with cancer].,"Venous thromboembolism occurs in about 10% of patients with cancer. In this setting, vitamin K antagonists have been associated with a high risk of recurrent disease and major bleeding. Low-molecular-weight heparin allows reducing by 50% the rate of recurrent venous thromboembolism as compared to vitamin K antagonists. Even with low-molecular-weight heparin, recurrent venous thromboembolism occurs in up to 6% of the patients. In this case it has been suggested to increase the dosage of low-molecular-weight heparin. Vena cava filtration probably plays a minor role in setting. After the sixth month, prolongation of low-molecular-weight-heparin or switch to vitamin K antagonist should be discussed on a case by case basis."
CD008201,0,20224426,0,Preventing serious sequelae after an acute coronary syndrome: the consequences of thrombosis versus bleeding with antiplatelet therapy.,"Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is associated with a persistent prothrombotic state, placing patients at high risk of subsequent ischemic events. Guidelines recommend the use of dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin + a thienopyridine (clopidogrel) for at least a year after ACS in most patients, except those who undergo coronary artery bypass grafting. Clinical studies demonstrate that this strategy significantly reduces the risk of ischemic events at the expense of a small increase in the risk of bleeding. Physicians must balance the risk of bleeding against the benefit of ischemia prevention, bearing in mind that ischemic events are generally more common than major bleeding and often associated with more catastrophic consequences or ongoing morbidity. The relationship between bleeding and mortality is complicated by the fact that many risk factors for bleeding are also those for mortality and that bleeding may lead to discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy, thereby increasing the risk for an ischemic event. Data suggest that physicians tend to overestimate the risk of bleeding and underestimate the risk of ischemia. Careful patient selection and thorough patient education are the keys to managing antiplatelet therapy after ACS, especially as newer more potent antiplatelet agents, such as prasugrel, become available."
CD008201,0,16769068,0,Thromboprophylaxis following cast immobilisation for lower limb injuries--survey of current practice in United Kingdom.,"The risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) is well documented in patients following cast immobilisation for injuries of lower extremities. There are no generally accepted approaches to preventing this complication and hence there remains substantial practice variation amongst surgeons regarding the use of anticoagulation measures. The present survey was conducted to investigate the current chemothromboprophylaxis practice among UK orthopaedic departments for patients immobilised with plasters for lower extremity injuries and establish any variations in practice. A telephone questionnaire survey was conducted on junior doctors (Senior House Officers and Registrars) in orthopaedic departments of 70 randomly selected hospitals in United Kingdom. This survey assessed the thromboprophylaxis practice for lower limb injuries in plaster casts. Our results show substantial variation amongst British orthopaedic surgeons in the use of chemothromboprophylaxis measures. Sixty-two percent of the departments do not use any DVT prophylaxis in this group of trauma. Furthermore, only 11.4% of the departments performed risk stratification on their patients. Ninety-nine percent of the respondents were unaware of any existing guidelines in this regard. Although the incidence of DVT in patients in plaster for lower extremity injuries is low compared to the Hip/Knee arthroplasty group, this is not insignificant. Both over and under treatment with thromboprophylaxis can have implications in terms of side effects and costs. One possible solution is to use risk stratification to identify individuals who are likely to benefit from prophylaxis. There is a substantial variation and inconsistency in practice among orthopaedic departments in United Kingdom due to a lack of clinical guidelines in this group of trauma and it remains underused even in high-risk group."

CD008201,0,9139100,0,Low-dose warfarin prophylaxis to prevent symptomatic pulmonary embolism after total knee arthroplasty.,"Pulmonary embolism poses a risk to patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty. The selection of an appropriate prophylaxis agent and its implementation have been influenced by decreased duration of hospital stay and the pressures of cost containment. The purpose of this study was to determine the inpatient and outpatient pulmonary embolism rates, the number of days required to attain the target level of anticoagulation, and complications associated with the use of a low-dose warfarin prophylaxis protocol after primary and revision total knee arthroplasty. Between 1984 and 1993, there were 815 primary and revision total knee arthroplasties that received low-dose warfarin prophylaxis at our institution. The average time to attainment of the target level of anticoagulation was 3 days. The average duration of warfarin prophylaxis was 12 days. Overall, there were a total of three symptomatic pulmonary embolisms (0.3%; 95% confidence interval, 0.08%-1.1%). There were eight (1%) symptomatic deep vein thromboses (all distal). There were two deaths (0.3%), but neither one was secondary to a pulmonary embolism. Seventeen knees (2.5%) developed a hematoma after surgery, and two of these patients required drainage of the knee. Low-dose warfarin prophylaxis is safe and effective in preventing symptomatic pulmonary embolism after total knee arthroplasty."
CD008201,0,25172513,0,Role of novel anticoagulants for patients with mechanical heart valves.,"The introduction of the target-specific oral anticoagulants (TSOACs) has led to a major shift in the management of patients at risk for thrombosis. The landscape continues to evolve as the evidence regarding their efficacy and safety in various clinical situations emerges. Antithrombotic therapy for thromboprophylaxis in patients with mechanical heart valves is challenging. To date, the RE-ALIGN trial comparing dabigatran etexilate to warfarin is the only randomized controlled study in this patient population. The higher risk of thromboembolic and bleeding events in the group of patients who received dabigatran compared with warfarin reinforced current guidelines recommending against the use of TSOACs in patients with mechanical heart valves. However, additional studies are needed to find suitable alternatives to vitamin K antagonists in this unique patient population."
CD008201,0,17393011,0,The management of thrombosis in pregnancy: role of low-molecular-weight heparin.,"Fatal pulmonary embolism remains the most common cause of mortality among pregnant women in many Western countries. The physiological changes of pregnancy produce a hypercoagulable state that increases the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Women with inherited or acquired thrombophilias are at particularly high risk of VTE during pregnancy, and thromboprophylaxis may be advisable in some cases. Thrombophilia is also associated with complications of pregnancy, including fetal loss, pre-eclampsia, intra-uterine growth restriction, and placental abruption. The antithrombotic agents available for the prevention and treatment of VTE during pregnancy, and pregnancy complications, include unfractionated heparin (UFH), low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) and aspirin. Vitamin K antagonists are contra-indicated in pregnancy. Low-dose aspirin may have a role in the prevention of some pregnancy complications, although its safety in early and late pregnancy is uncertain. The efficacy and safety of LMWHs have been demonstrated for the prevention and treatment of VTE in pregnancy. These agents are increasingly being used in place of UFH, which is associated with a higher incidence of side effects compared with LMWH, in addition to the need for regular laboratory monitoring. Evidence is also emerging to support the use of LMWH in the prevention of recurrent fetal loss, although further trials are needed to explore the role of LMWHs in this indication and in the prevention of other complications of pregnancy."
CD008201,0,16950728,0,The importance of establishing regimen concordance in preventing medication errors in anticoagulant care.,"Miscommunication between patients and providers can have serious consequences, especially where medications are concerned. We examined whether regimen discordance between patient and provider, a possible result of miscommunication, contributes to unsafe medication management. We studied 220 patients taking warfarin in an anticoagulation clinic to characterize two medication assessment methods. We measured (1) adherence by asking patients to report any missed doses and (2) concordance between patients' and providers' reports of warfarin regimens. We categorized patients as having regimen adherence if they missed no doses, and concordance if there was patient-provider agreement in weekly dosage. We characterized anticoagulant outcomes as unsafe if international normalized ratio (INR) values were <2.0 (at risk for thrombosis) or >4.0 (at risk for hemorrhage), and explored relationships among adherence, concordance, and anticoagulant outcomes. One hundred fifty-five patients (71%) reported no missed doses during the prior 30 days. Poor adherence was associated with underanticoagulation (AOR 2.33, 1.56-3.45), but not overanticoagulation (AOR 1.36, 0.69-2.66). One hundred ten patients (50%) reported regimens discordant with clinicians' report. There was no relationship between patients' reports of adherence and concordance. Among adherent patients, discordance was associated with underanticoagulation (AOR 1.67, 1.00-2.78) and overanticoagulation (AOR 3.44, 1.32-9.09). Discordance regarding warfarin regimens is common and places patients at risk for adverse events. To promote safe and effective care, clinicians should separately determine adherence and regimen concordance during routine medication assessments. Systems need to be developed to ensure concordance in medication regimens."

CD008201,0,23138506,0,The use of weighted and scored risk assessment models for venous thromboembolism.,"Formalised risk assessment models (RAMs) for venous thromboembolism (VTE) using weighted and scored variables have only recently been widely incorporated into international antithrombotic guidelines. Scored and weighted VTE RAMs have advantages over a simplified group-specific VTE risk approach, with the potential to allow more tailored strategies for thromboprophylaxis and an improved estimation of the risk/benefit profile for a particular patient. The derivation of VTE RAMs should be based on variables that are a priori defined or identified in a univariate analysis and the predictive capability of each variable should be rigorously assessed for both clinical and statistical significance and internal consistency and completeness. The assessment of the RAM should include the goodness of fit of the model and construction of a prognostic index score. Any VTE RAM which has been derived must undergo validation of that model before it can be used in clinical practice. Validation of the model should be performed in a ""deliberate"" prospective fashion across several diverse clinical sites using pre-defined criteria using basic standards for performing model validation.

CD008201,0,12693074,0,[New operative models for the management of anticoagulant prophylaxis].,"Anticoagulant therapy has proven to be effective for patients at risk for thromboembolic disease. Nevertheless, in daily clinical practice the oral anticoagulant therapy (OAT) is underused because it is still considered dangerous and difficult to manage, particularly in patients with chronic non-rheumatic atrial fibrillation. In the most important published studies about this topic we found that only 7-55% of patients with atrial fibrillation were treated with antiplatelet drugs, while 9.9-48.4% took anticoagulant prophylaxis; so, despite a favourable temporal trend after large trials have shown a positive prophylactic effect with antithrombotic drugs, they are underused. It has been estimated that in our country 500,000-600.00 potential patients could have indication for this treatment. Nevertheless, the traditional management of oral anticoagulation is fraught with difficulties such as patients' compliance, reliability of laboratory, global management of the treatment. Undoubtedly, this prophylaxis is very heavy for the patient and the physician often don't like this treatment for its dangerous potential, frequent difficulties of the management, obstacles in the communication among laboratory, physician and patient. Other common problems usually are the distance from patient's home-laboratory, its working hours, means of transportation. It is important a suitable organization and a control of the factors contributing to obtain favourable results for assuring a good cost/benefit ratio of OAT. The relationship among patient-physician-laboratory play a fundamental role. Alternative models are therefore prospected: anticoagulation clinic, computerised decision support software or portable coagulometer. Actually available instruments give us immediately the patients' INR and represent a new option and a promising strategy to monitor these large cohort of patients. Thus the management of OAT can be done by family physicians or by anticoagulant clinic or by patients themselves, after a suitable training period permitting a partial or total self management. These new strategies have improved therapeutic control of oral anticoagulation and in addition to the health advantages both also have economic benefits."

CD008201,0,11529700,0,The thrombophilias: well-defined risk factors with uncertain therapeutic implications.,"Discovery of the factor V Leiden and prothrombin G20210A mutations has greatly increased the percentage of patients in whom venous thrombosis can be attributed to hereditary thrombophilia. The first step in the diagnostic approach to all patients with venous thrombosis consists of a careful history and physical examination combined with routine laboratory testing to characterize the severity of the thrombotic condition and determine the presence of any of the acquired causes of hypercoagulability. The second step is to consider screening for the causes of hereditary and acquired thrombophilia in selected subsets of patients. The selection of patients for testing, the choice of tests to perform, and the timing of the testing are important and challenging issues to consider. Routine testing would be warranted if the identification of abnormalities led to an alteration in the type or duration of initial anticoagulant therapy or the use of long-term prophylactic anticoagulation. The available data, however, do not yet indicate that most patients with defined thrombophilic states should be managed any differently than patients without identifiable abnormalities. On the basis of relative prevalences of the various thrombophilias, patients can be classified as ""strongly"" or ""weakly"" thrombophilic depending on their thrombotic histories. Management considerations and guidelines are offered for patients who are found to have one or more defined abnormalities, hereditary or otherwise. The future identification of additional laboratory abnormalities predisposing patients to thrombosis, coupled with prospective clinical trials, should enable us to better identify patients at high risk for recurrence who will benefit from prolonged anticoagulant prophylaxis."

Atrial fibrillation is the most frequently diagnosed cardiac arrhythmia and affects more than 2.66 million Americans. Moreover, atrial fibrillation is associated with a 1.5 to 1.9-fold higher risk of death due to its strong correlation with thromboembolic events. Because of the attributed increased morbidity and mortality, challenges that concern identification of patients at risk for thromboembolic events from atrial fibrillation must be addressed. These challenges include compliance to performance measures, adherence to guidelines, adequate prevention and early control of co-morbidities that affect the progression of atrial fibrillation and associated risks, early initiation of treatment, and successful evaluation of associated risks of bleeding, primary or recurrent stroke, and patient awareness and compliance.

Studies show that low-molecular-weight heparins, given once daily, are at least as effective as unfractionated heparin usually given thrice daily with equivalent or improved safety profiles, and that thrice-daily dosing of unfractionated heparin might be more effective than twice-daily dosing. However, the most recent American College of Chest Physicians guidelines do not distinguish between these regimens, and twice-daily unfractionated heparin is still commonly used in the United States. Furthermore, the optimal duration for out-of-hospital and extended prophylaxis for specific patient groups is not established. Finally, there are few data on the use of mechanical methods in this patient group and no established standard of care for prophylaxis of special patient populations, such as obese patients or those with renal insufficiency. Even though prophylaxis entails additional acquisition costs, it can reduce the incidence of venous thromboembolism, which can improve care and decrease overall costs."

CD008201,0,26734215,0,Improving the investigation of suspected deep vein thrombosis in the Emergency Department.,"Deep vein thrombosis is an important medical condition that requires treatment to prevent further complications. However, diagnosing deep vein thrombosis is not straightforward because its symptoms can mimic a number of alternative diagnoses - often leading to unnecessary investigation. The latest NICE guidance published in June 2012 provides a clear evidence-based approach to diagnosis which helps to minimise this potential loss of valuable time and resources. It was recognised that the Emergency Department was unaware of the latest guidance and demonstrated that it was often over and inadequately investigating suspected deep vein thromboses, unnecessarily using resources and putting patients at risk. To address this, a new investigation pathway and proforma were introduced into the department. It was placed onto the Trust website and incorporated into the departmental induction for new staff and trainees. Following the introduction of these changes, a re-audit demonstrated that the department's investigation of deep vein thrombosis improved significantly. In addition to increased adherence to the latest guidelines and improved documentation there was a 21% reduction in the total number of ultrasound scans performed indicating a significant impact upon both the department and patient care."

CD008201,0,20499769,0,Lack of thromboprophylaxis across the care continuum in US medical patients.,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis is suboptimal, with many at-risk medical patients not receiving anticoagulants in hospital. Among those who receive anticoagulants in the hospital, thromboprophylaxis is frequently stopped at discharge despite persistent risk. Few studies have investigated prophylaxis use across the continuum of care. We analyzed anticoagulant use in medical patients in hospital and after discharge. Patient records (January 2005-December 2007) from medical patients with cancer, heart failure, severe lung disease, or infectious disease who were deemed at risk for VTE by the 2008 American College of Chest Physicians guidelines were included. Records were queried for inpatient and outpatient anticoagulant use by cross-matching data from the Premier Perspective discharge database with the i3/Ingenix LabRx outpatient and inpatient database. Of the 9675 medical patients identified, only 36.1% received inpatient anticoagulation (24.9% cancer patients, 30.1% infectious disease patients, 42.5% severe lung disease patients, and 56.3% heart failure patients). Of those who received in-hospital anticoagulants, most received enoxaparin (58.6%) followed by unfractionated heparin and other prophylactic agents. Only 1.8% of medical patients were prescribed anticoagulants within 30 days after discharge, ranging from 1.1% of patients with infectious disease to 4.8% of patients with heart failure. The majority of patients discharged who received outpatient anticoagulation filled prescriptions for warfarin, followed by enoxaparin plus warfarin. This real-world study demonstrates that only one-third of at-risk medical patients receive anticoagulants in hospital, with < 2% continuing to receive prophylaxis after discharge. Therefore, there is a need to improve the provision of thromboprophylaxis in the continuum of care for acutely ill medical patients."
CD008201,0,23124723,0,Performance of new anticoagulants for thromboprophylaxis in patients undergoing hip and knee replacement surgery.,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) represents one of the most preventable complications that occur during hospitalization, and measurement of hospital-associated VTE is becoming a key component in hospital quality measures. Guidelines for the prevention of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism have been published by several organizations to guide quality of care; however, some of the guidelines are divergent in their recommendations. This disagreement among guidelines is most pronounced in patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery. The advent of newer anticoagulants, which are now approved or in late-phase development, have already had an effect on the guidelines and may also affect quality measures in the future. In this article, we review the burden of VTE in patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery, highlight the differences in the guidelines, and examine the new anticoagulants as they are related to VTE prophylaxis in this patient group."
CD008201,0,11587258,0,Anticoagulation in pregnancy and the puerperium.,"For the management of acute thrombotic events in pregnancy therapeutic doses of low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) may be used, unless the shorter half-life of intravenous unfractionated heparin (UH) and predictable reversibility by protamine are important. Treatment should be continued up until delivery and into the puerperium. Pregnant women who have had an acute thrombotic event should be delivered by a specialist team. In the case of recent thrombosis, delivery should be planned and the time during which anticoagulation therapy is ceased around the time of delivery should be minimised. Therapeutic doses of LMWH contraindicate the use of regional anaesthesia, and a switch to intravenous UH before delivery may allow greater flexibility in this regard. Prophylactic doses of LMWH can be used to reduce the risk of recurrent thromboembolic events in pregnancy. The regimen used will depend on the previous history, the family history and the presence of risk factors, including the genetic and acquired causes of thrombophilia. Women with mechanical heart valves are at high risk during pregnancy and require therapeutic anticoagulation throughout pregnancy under the direction of experienced specialists. Low-dose aspirin can reduce the risk of recurrent pre-eclampsia by about 15%, but the role of UH and LMWH in the prevention of recurrent miscarriage or obstetric complications associated with uteroplacental insufficiency is still uncertain."

Hip and knee arthroplasty surgery is associated with an increased rate of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolus (PE). The National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines introduced in January 2010 recommended use of subcutaneous heparin or an oral anticoagulant (Dabigatran or Rivaroxiban) for 10-14 days post knee and 28-35 days post hip arthroplasty. In our unit we were keen on the advantages of an oral anticoagulant post arthroplasty in terms of patient compliance, and avoiding the need for self administered injection in the community."
CD008201,0,22152280,0,HDL-C: role as a risk modifier.,"Evidence that low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) causes cardiovascular disease (CVD) is overwhelming. It has also been proven beyond all doubt that lowering the level of LDL-C using statins reduces CV risk. However, many people remain at high risk even when their level of LDL-C has been reduced by aggressive treatment with statins. One reason for this residual risk can be a low level of high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C). The concentration of HDL-C is an independent, inverse predictor for CVD. This relationship is apparent even when treatment with statins has reduced the level of LDL-C to below 1.8 mmol/L (70 mg/dL). It has therefore been suggested that raising the level of HDL-C should be considered as a therapeutic strategy for reducing the residual CV risk that persists in some people, despite aggressive LDL-C lowering with statins. HDL particles have several functions with the potential to protect against arterial disease, the best known of which relates to their ability to promote cholesterol efflux from macrophages in the artery wall. However, HDLs have several additional protective properties that are independent of their involvement in cholesterol metabolism. For example, they have properties that reduce oxidation, vascular inflammation and thrombosis, improve endothelial function, promote endothelial repair, enhance insulin sensitivity and promote insulin secretion by pancreatic beta islet cells. There is also a large and compelling body of evidence in animal models showing that interventions that increase HDL levels are profoundly anti-atherogenic. Major causes of low HDL are abdominal obesity and type 2 diabetes, the worldwide incidences of which are increasing at alarming rates. Strategies to increase the concentration of HDL should begin with lifestyle changes such as weight reduction, increased physical activity and smoking cessation. However, compliance with such measures is frequently poor and pharmacological intervention may be required. Currently available HDL-raising medications include fibrates, niacin and statins. There is indisputable evidence that lowering LDL-C levels using statins translates into a large reduction in CV risk. There is also mounting evidence that increasing the level of HDL-C using statins contributes to an additional reduction in CV risk. For example, the increase in HDL-C levels that was associated with simvastatin treatment in the 4S study was a significant predictor for the reduction in CV events. Moreover, a meta-analysis of 1,455 patients in 4 coronary intravascular ultrasound imaging trials showed that both the achieved level of LDL-C and the increase in HDL-C concentration during statin treatment were significant independent predictors for coronary atheroma progression as assessed by coronary intravascular ultrasound. In conclusion, evidence suggests that low levels of HDL-C are associated with an increased CV risk even when LDL-C is reduced to below 1.7 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) with a statin. Moreover, there is mounting evidence that increasing the level of HDL-C has the capacity to reduce CV risk. Thus, there is a compelling case for targeting both the LDL and HDL fractions to reduce CV risk in people with dyslipidemia, high CV risk and low levels of HDL-C."

The vast range of choices can cause confusion and few randomized controlled clinical trials in this area provide adequate guidance. Chronic anticoagulation management is more straightforward since clinical evidence is ample, randomized clinical trial data provides cogent informaiton and guidelines have been established. Acute management of anticoagulation in patients with atrial fibrillation to prevent thromboembolic complications is often unrecognized but is emerging as a crucial, but challenging, and increasingly complex aspect of the care of patients with atrial fibrillation. This review addresses issues regarding such patients who may be at risk for stroke and require acute adjustments of anticoagulation (in light of, or in lieu of, chronic anticoagulation). Several promising new strategies are considered in light of established medical care.

Major predictors of vascular events are increasing age and previous thrombosis; leukocytosis and high JAK2 V617F allele burden are currently being investigated for additional prognostic value in this regard. Myelosuppressive drugs can reduce the rate of thrombosis, but there is concern that their use raises the risk of transformation into acute leukemia. To tackle this dilemma, a risk-oriented management strategy is recommended. Low-risk patients should be treated with phlebotomy and low-dose aspirin. Cytotoxic therapy is indicated in high-risk patients, and the drug of choice is hydroxyurea because of its efficacy in preventing thrombosis and low leukemogenicity. Interferon-alpha should be reserved for selected categories of patients due to high cost and toxicity. The demonstration of JAK2 V617F mutation in the vast majority of PV patients opens the avenue for the development of promising new molecularly targeted drugs."

CD008201,0,9129863,0,Low molecular weight heparin(oid)s. Clinical investigations and practical recommendations.,"Unfractionated heparin (UFH) is traditionally used for prevention and treatment of thrombosis. However, its use is associated with a clinically relevant bleeding risk. Low molecular weight heparin(oid) [LMWH] preparations have been designed to improve upon the efficacy and safety ratio of UFH. They have been investigated in clinical studies following the favourable outcome of extensive animal experimentation to determine their efficacy in the prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism and in arterial thrombotic conditions such as ischaemic stroke, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) and unstable angina. Indeed, an improved efficacy/safety ratio of LMWHs in the prevention of postoperative venous thrombosis in high risk orthopaedic surgery patients has been observed as compared to UFH prophylaxis. No significant differences with respect to antithrombotic efficacy and bleeding complications were observed in patients with relatively lower risk such as in those undergoing general surgery. Subsequently, these agents have been investigated for the treatment of venous thromboembolism. The results of a series of clinical trials reveal that LMWHs are at least as safe and effective as UFH for initial treatment, with the additional advantage of the possibility of home treatment without the requirement of laboratory control and with a reduced risk of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. Preliminary data suggest that LMHWs may be suitable for thromboprophylaxis in neurosurgery and stroke patients; in addition, they may have a place in the treatment of patients with acute stroke, unstable angina and individuals in the post-myocardial infarction stage. However, additional confirmatory data for these potential indications are required before definite recommendations can be given. LMWH compounds have at least a similar efficacy and safety as UFH in haemodialysis. In addition, they simplify the anticoagulant regimen because of the efficacy of a single predialysis bolus injection."
CD008201,0,23439004,0,Epidemiology and treatment of congenital fibrinogen deficiency.,"Congenital fibrinogen deficiency is a rare bleeding disorder, affecting either the quantity (afibrinogenemia, hypofibrinogenemia) or quality (dysfibrinogenemia) of circulating fibrinogen. There is a strong association between fibrinogen activity levels and clinical bleeding severity. Patients with afibrinogenemia experience frequent, often severe, spontaneous bleeds into the muscles and joints and are at significant risk of intracranial hemorrhage. Patients with hypofibrinogenemia are usually asymptomatic; however, they are vulnerable to bleeding after trauma. Dysfibrinogenemia is associated with both spontaneous bleeding and a relatively high risk of thrombosis. Fibrinogen replacement therapy is effective in treating bleeding episodes in congenital fibrinogen deficiency. Fibrinogen concentrates are the preferred treatment option and guidelines now exist for their on-demand use and to manage surgery. Prophylaxis may benefit patients with afibrinogenemia and others with a severe bleeding tendency. The dose and frequency of administration should be adjusted to maintain a fibrinogen activity level >0.5-1.0 g/L. Pregnant women with afibrinogenemia require prophylactic factor replacement as early as possible during pregnancy, continuing throughout pregnancy, and after the birth. Fibrinogen replacement should also be considered in pregnant women with other fibrinogen deficiencies. The risk of thrombosis presents an additional management challenge in these patients, often necessitating the concurrent use of anticoagulants and fibrinogen. Although basic guidelines have been developed, further studies are needed to help optimize treatment in different patient groups under different clinical circumstances and to improve our understanding of thrombotic events."

Low-profile stent delivery systems may decrease risk of releasing embolic load when crossing high-grade stenosis or kinking of the vessel. The introduction of a cerebral protection with the use of temporary occlusion balloons or filter systems has resulted in a reduction of procedure-related neurological complications, and is strongly recommended by leading experts in the field."
CD008201,0,1530782,0,Endoscopic therapy for acute nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage: a meta-analysis.,"Endoscopic hemostatic therapy for upper gastrointestinal bleeding is gaining widespread acceptance despite often conflicting results of randomized controlled trials. To examine the effect of endoscopic therapy in acute nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage, a meta-analysis was performed using a computerized search of the English-language literature and a bibliographic review. The methodology, population, intervention, and outcomes of each relevant trial were evaluated by duplicate independent review. Thirty randomized controlled trials evaluating hemostatic endoscopic treatment were identified. Endoscopic therapy significantly reduced rates of further bleeding (odds ratio, 0.38; 95% confidence interval, 0.32-0.45), surgery (odds ratio, 0.36; 95% confidence interval, 0.28-0.45), and mortality (odds ratio, 0.55; 95% confidence interval, 0.40-0.76). When analyzed separately, thermal-contact devices (monopolar and bipolar electrocoagulation and heater probe), laser treatment, and injection therapy all significantly decreased further bleeding and surgery rates. The reductions in mortality were comparable for all three forms of therapy, but the decrease reached statistical significance only for laser therapy. Further examination of subgroups indicated that endoscopic treatment decreased rates of further bleeding, surgery, and mortality in patients with high-risk endoscopic features of active bleeding or nonbleeding visible vessels. Rebleeding was not reduced by endoscopic therapy in patients with ulcers containing flat pigmented spots or adherent clots. Endoscopic hemostatic therapy provides a clinically important reduction in morbidity and mortality in patients with acute nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage."
CD008201,0,24520477,0,Incompletely Evaluated ART Leading to Ectopic Pregnancy and Cerebral Thrombosis.,"We presented a cerebral venous thrombosis case associated with lack of proper medical evaluation required for confirmation of suppression and exclusion of current pregnancy before starting assisted reproductive technology (ART) cycle. This is a case-report study about a 37-year-old woman who presented to emergency room with abdominal pain and tenderness. Initial human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) value was 17616 IU/L. Endometrium was heteregenous and incompatible with a normal intrauterine pregnancy. She had a history of antagonist protocol/controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) started 38 days ago in a different in vitro fertilization (IVF) center. Because of the fertilization failure, she had no embryo transfer. With ectopic pregnancy diagnosis, we made surgical exploration and observed a material which was consistent with ectopic pregnancy on the right tuba uterina. Partial salpingectomy was applied because of actively bleeding ectopic pregnancy. Two days after discharging from hospital; she presented to emergency room again with syncope and generalized tonic-clonic seizure. By cranial tomography generalized edema, cerebral venous thrombosis was established. Enoxaparine sodium 0.6 ml twice daily was administered. Six days after hospitalisation, she was discharged with normal neurological examination under phenytoin 200 mg daily and enoxaparine sodium 0.6 ml daily. Before ART treatment, clinicians must always rule out the likelihood of existing pregnancy by measuring estradiol, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), and luteinizing hormone (LH). On the other hand, low-molecularweight heparine may be effective in cerebral venous thrombosis treatment. Therefore, intracerebral thrombosis is one of the rare mortal complications of ART."

CD008201,0,21247533,0,Usefulness of comprehensive cardiothoracic computed tomography in the evaluation of acute undifferentiated chest discomfort in the emergency department (CAPTURE).,"Newer cardiac computed tomographic (CT) technology has permitted comprehensive cardiothoracic evaluations for coronary artery disease, pulmonary embolism, and aortic dissection within a single breath hold, independent of the heart rate. We conducted a randomized diagnostic trial to compare the efficiency of a comprehensive cardiothoracic CT examination in the evaluation of patients presenting to the emergency department with undifferentiated acute chest discomfort or dyspnea. We randomized the emergency department patients clinically scheduled to undergo a dedicated CT protocol to assess coronary artery disease, pulmonary embolism, or aortic dissection to either the planned dedicated CT protocol or a comprehensive cardiothoracic CT protocol. All CT examinations were performed using a 64-slice dual source CT scanner. The CT results were immediately communicated to the emergency department providers, who directed further management at their discretion. The subjects were then followed for the remainder of their hospitalization and for 30 days after hospitalization. Overall, 59 patients (mean age 51.2 ± 11.4 years, 72.9% men) were randomized to either dedicated (n = 30) or comprehensive (n = 29) CT scanning. No significant difference was found in the median length of stay (7.6 vs 8.2 hours, p = 0.79), rate of hospital discharge without additional imaging (70% vs 69%, p = 0.99), median interval to exclusion of an acute event (5.2 vs 6.5 hours, p = 0.64), costs of care (p = 0.16), or the number of revisits (p = 0.13) between the dedicated and comprehensive arms, respectively. In addition, radiation exposure (11.3 mSv vs 12.8 mSv, p = 0.16) and the frequency of incidental findings requiring follow-up (24.1% vs 33.3%, p = 0.57) were similar between the 2 arms. Comprehensive cardiothoracic CT scanning was feasible, with a similar diagnostic yield to dedicated protocols. However, it did not reduce the length of stay, rate of subsequent testing, or costs. In conclusion, although this ""triple rule out"" protocol might be helpful in the evaluation of select patients, these findings suggest that it should not be used routinely with the expectation that it will improve efficiency or reduce resource use."

CD008201,0,14711763,0,Thromboembolism.,"Venous thomboembolism (VTE) causes only about 2% of maternal deaths in the developing world but is a leading cause of direct maternal deaths in developed countries. Pregnancy increases the risk of VTE through venous stasis, changes in blood coagulability and damage to vessels. Early diagnosis of VTE depends crucially on awareness of the condition but clinical diagnosis is unreliable in pregnancy and objective testing is essential. Compression or duplex ultrasonography is used to diagnose deep venous thrombosis and a ventilation/perfusion scan for pulmonary embolism. Low molecular weight heparins are safe and effective for treatment and for thromboprophylaxis in pregnancy. All women should undergo risk assessment in early pregnancy or preferably before pregnancy. Identifying risk factors such as obesity, or a past or family history of thromboembolism, allows at-risk women to be offered thromboprophylaxis. Guidelines on thromboprophylaxis have reduced deaths after caesarean section and are now being developed for all women."

CD008201,0,14652643,0,Reduction of venous thromboembolism following prolonged prophylaxis with the low molecular weight heparin Certoparin after endoprothetic joint replacement or osteosynthesis of the lower limb in elderly patients.,"The peri- and postsurgical thromboembolic prophylaxis with low molecular weight heparins is a well established therapy regimen, but the optimum duration of prophylaxis after surgery still remains uncertain. A few studies have pointed to the fact that the thromboembolic risk of high-risk patients persists longer than the in-hospital period correlating with respective hypercoagulatory conditions. The aim of the present study was to test if a prolongation of thromboprophylaxis with the low molecular weight heparin Certoparin further reduces the rate of thromboembolism in high-risk patients after orthopedic surgery. The ""Long-term Thromboprophylaxis""-Study was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. 360 patients who underwent endoprothetic joint replacement or osteosynthesis of the lower limb were initially enrolled, all of them received prophylactically 3000 U anti-Xa of Certoparin once daily for 14 days followed by randomization to prolonged Certoparin application or to placebo up to day 42. Patients were screened for deep vein thrombosis by sonography every week. Coagulation markers (fibrin monomers and D-dimers) were determined during the course of the study. Venous thromboembolism during the prolongation period was observed in 18 patients receiving placebo versus 8 patients of the prolonged Certoparin group (12.1% versus 5.0%, intention-to-treat sample). The analysis revealed a statistically significant difference in favor of Certoparin (p=0.020), which was confirmed by per-protocol analysis (14.2% versus 5.5%, p=0.012). The differences remained significant, if analyses considered only clinically symptomatic thromboembolic events (p=0.040). Patients who developed a thrombosis showed a strong increase of coagulation markers as compared to patients without subsequent thrombosis. The respective differentiation started around 18 days before diagnosis of thrombosis. Only one minor bleeding complication was observed during prolonged Certoparin prophylaxis. The present study shows that patients after joint replacement or osteosynthesis of the lower extremities have a persisting risk to develop thromboembolic complications beyond the routine duration of thromboprophylaxis. Extended prophylaxis with Certoparin resulted in a significantly lower rate of thromboembolism and should be strongly recommended."

The prevention of venous thromboembolism has moved to the forefront of patient safety initiatives, resulting in the formation of various guidelines to assist the practitioner. Recommendations for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in the orthopaedic trauma patient exist, but there is insufficient evidence in the literature to make strong recommendations regarding type and duration of prophylaxis. The associated morbidity of chemical anticoagulants used in the orthopaedic trauma patient must also be taken into consideration, specifically the increased risk of bleeding. Mechanical prophylaxis is used in place of, or in addition to, these medications in certain situations. New, potentially superior anticoagulants have been developed but are still understudied. Larger studies are needed to further define the type and duration of deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis in the orthopaedic trauma patient."

CD008201,0,15287326,0,Warfarin therapy in older adults: managing treatment in the primary care setting.,"Oral anticoagulant therapy with war farin is commonly used to prevent thromboembolic events in patients at risk. The degree of anticoagulation is variable among individuals and is influenced by many factors; therefore, patients must be monitored frequently to assess for potential adverse effects related to treatment. Individuals older than age 65 are at particular risk for thromboembolic events as well as anticoag ulant-related complications. Because of these factors, elderly individuals pose a unique challenge in maintain ing anticoagulant control. The purpose of this article is to revisit the role of warfarin therapy for elderly individ uals in the primary care setting and to provide nurse practitioners with the information necessary to prescribe and monitor this medication appropriately. This article provides indications for warfarin therapy and also identifies potential barriers to effective management with specific implications for the older population."
CD008201,0,23160015,0,[Risk stratification for thromboembolism and antithrombotic prophylaxis in atrial fibrillation].,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with a significantly high risk of stroke and systemic embolism (4.5%/year). Oral anticoagulant therapy (OAT) with warfarin (INR range 2.0-3.0) significantly reduces thromboembolic risk, whereas aspirin has poor efficacy. In patients with AF, several scoring systems, such as the CHADS2 and CHA2DS2-VASc scores, are currently used to stratify thromboembolic risk. The CHA2DS2-VASc score stratifies patients at intermediate-low thromboembolic risk more accurately than the CHADS2 score. The most recent European and US guidelines on AF have extended the indications for OAT, which is recommended not only for patients at high risk, but also for those at intermediate risk, with CHADS2 score ≥1. However, in clinical practice underuse of OAT, suboptimal quality of anticoagulation, and frequent discontinuations of treatment are observed. Therefore, there is a great expectation for the new oral anticoagulants, in particular the direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran etexilate and the factor Xa inhibitors rivaroxaban and apixaban, which are at least non-inferior to warfarin and safer, and seem to be a suitable therapeutic alternative to the old warfarin."

Clivarine has been extensively studied in acute coronary syndrome. Various clinical studies in unstable angina and acute coronary syndrome have proved that clivarine in a dosage of 3436anti-Xa units twice daily is an effective antithrombotic agent. Clivarine has been shown to be as effective as unfractionated heparin (UFH) in thromboprophylaxis and it has less incidence of local haematoma at injection site. At a daily dose of 1432 IU anti-Xa it was found to be as effective as UFH in preventing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in moderate risk surgery (general and abdominal) and reducing to a significant extent DVT in patients with brace immobilisation of the legs. At a daily dose of 3436 IU anti-Xa reviparin was as effective as UFH or enoxaparin in preventing DVT in high risk orthopaedic surgery and as effective as UFH in prevention of DVT and/or pulmonary embolism (PE) and/or mortality in high risk orthopaedic surgery. In patients with acute venous thrombo-embolism (VTE), reviparin was more effective than UFH in thrombus reduction and at least as effective as UFH in the prevention of clinical recurrence of DVT and/or PE. The use of reviparin is associated with a similar or lower incidence of bleeding complications than UFH. The benefits of reviparin sodium have been demonstrated in a number of clinical trials."

CD008201,0,8822126,0,Patients at risk of venous thromboembolism--clinical results with reviparin.,"Perioperative thromboembolism can be effectively prevented by low-dose heparin. However, its clinical benefit is limited, due to the risk of bleeding, the need for multiple daily doses, infrequent disorders of platelet function and other potential side effects. Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) was developed with the aim that the antithrombotic efficacy of heparin could be maintained, while the risk of bleeding and other side effects would be reduced. Prior to recent studies, the anticipated clinical benefit of LMWH remained a controversial issue. We have reviewed the clinical pharmacology and the results of several prospective trials using reviparin a LMWH which has been compared with unfractionated heparin (UFH) and another LMWH. The efficacy and safety of reviparin was examined in the prevention of venous thromboembolism in high risk patients undergoing elective major abdominal and hip surgery. The results of these clinical trials show that reviparin is as effective as UFH in preventing venous thromboembolism whilst having a lower incidence of bleeding complications. Of major significance was the finding that a very low dose of reviparin, namely 1750 anti-Xa IU once daily, was found to be as effective as UFH in preventing deep vein thrombosis whilst having a significantly lower incidence of bleeding complications in patients undergoing major abdominal surgery. Reviparin has also been shown to be effective and safe as enoxaprin in patients undergoing elective hip surgery. Further clinical trials are required to test different dosage regimens as a thromboprophylactic agent in high risk patients. It is possible that reviparin and other LMWHs with similar pharmacological properties may have an important clinical benefit over earlier compounds. However, this needs to be assessed in large scale, double-blind, randomised clinical trials."
CD008201,0,15701145,0,Fondaparinux: an update on new study results.,"Fondaparinux (Arixtra) is the first selective factor Xa inhibitor approved for use in thromboprophylaxis after orthopaedic surgery. New recently completed trials have also demonstrated the potential of fondaparinux in the prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in other surgical and medical settings and in the treatment of established VTE. In the randomized double-blind PEGASUS study in high-risk abdominal surgery patients, fondaparinux reduced the incidence of VTE from 6.1% with dalteparin to 4.6% (odds ratio reduction = 25.8%, P = 0.14), without increasing the bleeding risk. In the randomized double-blind ARTEMIS trial in acutely ill medical patients, fondaparinux reduced the incidence of VTE from 10.5% with placebo to 5.6% (odds ratio reduction = 49.5%, P = 0.029), without increasing the bleeding risk; there was no pulmonary embolism in the fondaparinux group compared with five, all fatal, in the placebo group (P = 0.029). In the two MATISSE trials, both the efficacy and safety of once daily fondaparinux were at least as good as enoxaparin in the treatment of deep-vein thrombosis (MATISSE-DVT) and unfractionated heparin in the treatment of pulmonary embolism (MATISSE-PE). In patients with coronary artery disease, promising results were obtained in phase II trials and large phase III trials are ongoing. In conclusion, fondaparinux may further improve and simplify the prevention and treatment of thrombosis in a large range of medical and surgical settings."

CD008201,0,15132325,0,Current recommendations for extended out-of-hospital thromboprophylaxis following total hip arthroplasty.,"Patients who have undergone total hip arthroplasty are at risk for venous thromboembolic disease, including deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and postphlebitic syndrome. Although the number of annual total hip arthroplasties in the United States has steadily risen in the past decade, the rate of venous thromboembolic disease within that patient group has declined as a result of advances in surgical and postoperative procedures, including prompt mobilization and safety and efficacy of thromboprophylactic alternatives. This paper reviews the therapeutic options for deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis following total hip arthroplasty, with an emphasis on recommendations of the Sixth American College of Chest Physicians Consensus Conference on Antithrombotic Therapy. The implications of recent randomized clinical trials on care provided by physiatrists in the rehabilitation facility setting are also discussed. The low-molecular-weight heparins have become widely accepted alternatives to aspirin, heparin, and warfarin as results from randomized clinical trials have proved their superior safety and efficacy in the postoperative period. Prolonged prophylaxis up to 30 to 35 days postoperatively in total hip arthroplasty may offer additional protection against venous thrombosis. Therefore, to prescribe optimal thromboprophylactic regimens following total hip arthroplasty, physicians require an understanding of the current recommendations of the Sixth American College of Chest Physicians Consensus Conference on Antithrombotic Therapy and the implications of recently concluded clinical trials."

Two recent studies have arisen a discussion regarding the benefit of the combined used of ECS and pharmaceutical prophylaxis over pharmaceutical prophylaxis alone. One study on patients receiving total hip replacement and one study on patients suffering from stroke did not show an advantage of the combination. In addition the German, the American and the British Guidelines do not give precise and mandatory indication for the use of ECS in addition to pharmaceutical prophylaxis. They describe the lack of adequate data and the problems in patient care using ECS. Thus, due to the lack of evidence and the possibility of adverse events a routine use of ECS is not justified. The only generally accepted indication for ECS is in patients with moderate and high risk for venous thromboembolism when pharmaceutical prophylaxis is not possible."
CD008201,0,18853277,0,Coronary CT angiography in emergency department patients with acute chest pain: triple rule-out protocol versus dedicated coronary CT angiography.,"Immediate coronary catheterization is mandatory for high risk patients with typical chest pain in the emergency department (ED). In contrast, in ED patients with acute chest pain but low to intermediate risk, traditional management protocol includes serial ECG, cardiac troponins and radionuclide perfusion imaging. However, this protocol is time-consuming and expensive, and definite treatment of unstable angina is often delayed. Due to advances of multi-detector CT (MDCT) technology, dedicated coronary CT angiography provides the potential to rapidly and reliably diagnose or exclude acute coronary syndrome in ED patients with acute chest pain. Moreover, major life-threatening causes of ED chest pain (i.e., acute aortic syndrome and pulmonary embolism as well as acute coronary syndrome) can simultaneously be assessed by the so-called ""triple rule-out"" protocol with a single scan. In ED patients with atypical chest pain and low to intermediate risk, the triple rule-out protocol may be preferred, especially in older patients who have relatively lower risk of lifelong radiation-induced cancer. However, the increased radiation dose resulting from the extended volume coverage with this protocol should be fully considered prior to performing this protocol. Therefore, in ED patients who have a low clinical suspicion of pulmonary embolism and acute aortic syndrome, especially younger patients, dedicated coronary CT angiography accompanied by modifications to reduce radiation dose is recommended."

CD008201,0,23831163,0,Impact of a multidisciplinary management strategy on the outcome of patients with native valve infective endocarditis.,"Strategies to improve management of patients with native valve endocarditis (NVE) are needed because of persistently high morbidity and mortality. We sought to assess the impact of an operative protocol of multidisciplinary approach on the outcome of patients with NVE. A formal policy for the care of infective endocarditis was introduced at our hospital in 2003 in which patients were referred to and managed by a preexisting team involving a cardiologist, a specialist in infectious diseases, and a cardiac surgeon. The initial multidisciplinary evaluation was performed within 12 hours of admission. Whenever conditions associated with impending hemodynamic impairment, high-risk for systemic embolization, or unsuccessful medical therapy were found, patients were operated on within 48 hours. Stable patients were evaluated weekly by the multidisciplinary team, and on-treatment surgery was performed whenever the above high-risk conditions had developed. Comparing the period 2003 through 2009 with 1996 through 2002 (when a multidisciplinary policy was not followed), patients were more numerous (190 vs 102), older (mean age 59.1 vs 54.2, p = 0.01), and had more co-morbidities (mean Charlson index 3.01 vs 2.31, p = 0.02). The pattern of infection did not change in terms of valve infected or paravalvular complications. In the second period, fewer patients had culture-negative NVE (8% vs 21%, p = 0.01) and worsened renal function (37% vs 58%, p = 0.001). A significant reduction in overall in-hospital mortality (28% to 13%, p = 0.02), mortality for surgery during the active phase (47% to 13%, p ≤0.001), and 3-year mortality (34% vs 16%, p = 0.0007) was observed. In conclusion, formalized, collaborative management led to significant improvement in NVE-related mortality, notwithstanding the less favorable patients' baseline characteristics."

CD008201,0,15222648,0,DVT and pulmonary embolism: Part I. Diagnosis.,"The incidence of venous thromboembolic diseases is increasing as the U.S. population ages. At least one established risk factor is present in approximately 75 percent of patients who develop these diseases. Hospitalized patients and nursing home residents account for one half of all cases of deep venous thrombosis. A well-validated clinical prediction rule can be used for risk stratification of patients with suspected deep venous thrombosis. Used in combination with D-dimer or Doppler ultrasound tests, the prediction rule can reduce the need for contrast venography, as well as the likelihood of false-positive or false-negative test results. The inclusion of helical computed tomographic venography (i.e., a below-the-pelvis component) in pulmonary embolism protocols remains under evaluation. Specific combinations of a clinical prediction rule, ventilation-perfusion scanning, and D-dimer testing can rule out pulmonary embolism without an invasive or expensive investigation. A clinical prediction rule for pulmonary embolism is most helpful when it is used with subsequent evaluations such as ventilation-perfusion scanning, D-dimer testing, or computed tomography. Technologic advances are improving the resolution of helical computed tomography to allow detection of smaller emboli; however, further study is needed to provide definitive evidence supporting the role of this imaging technique in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. D-dimer testing is helpful clinically only when the result is negative. A negative D-dimer test can be used in combination with a clinical decision rule, ventilation-perfusion scanning, and/or helical computed tomography to lower the probability of pulmonary embolism to the point that aggressive treatment is not required. Evidence-based algorithms help guide the diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism."

The risk of complications of venous thromboembolisms depends on the location of thrombi; potential long-term complications include recurrent venous thromboembolism, postthrombotic syndrome, and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. Risk of recurrence persists for several years after the initial event. Approximately 20% of recurrent events are pulmonary embolisms, and approximately half of those are fatal. The causal relationship between deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism remains controversial. Some consider them distinct clinical entities, while others have found asymptomatic distal deep vein thrombosis to be associated with elevated risk of developing pulmonary embolism. Unique coagulation factors may be associated with orthopedic surgery patients that differentiate them from patients undergoing other types of surgery. Symptomatic and asymptomatic deep vein thrombosis can lead to the development of recurrent venous thromboembolism, pulmonary embolism, postthrombotic syndrome, and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension, all of which are associated with reduced quality of life and increased health care expenditures. Thromboprophylaxis is therefore important in patients undergoing THA or TKA. However, traditional anticoagulants are not ideal, particularly for long-term use. Orthopedic surgeons should be aware of the causes and potential sequelae of venous thromboembolism and of the new thromboprophylactic agents that can help prevent it."

Advocated alternatives include low-dose unfractionated heparin (UFH) or low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH). Although LMWHs are as effective as UFH, less frequent administration and potentially safer adverse effect profile associated with LMWHs might off-set greater drug acquisition costs. The objective of this study was to determine the most cost-effective thromboprophylaxis strategy for hospitalized medicine patients and specific subgroups in Canada."
CD008201,0,21349487,0,Meta-analysis of multivessel coronary artery revascularization versus culprit-only revascularization in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction and multivessel disease.,"American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines for management of patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) recommend culprit artery-only revascularization (CULPRIT) based on safety concerns during noninfarct-related artery intervention. However, the data to support this safety concern are scant. Searches were performed in PubMed/EMBASE/CENTRAL for studies evaluating multivessel revascularization versus CULPRIT in patients with STEMI and multivessel disease (MVD). A multivessel revascularization strategy had to be performed at the time of CULPRIT or during the same hospitalization. Early (≤30-day) and long-term outcomes were evaluated. Among 19 studies (23 arms) that evaluated 61,764 subjects with STEMI and MVD, multivessel revascularization was performed in a minority of patients (16%). For early outcomes, there was no significant difference for outcomes of mortality, MI, stroke, and target vessel revascularization, with a 44% decrease in risk of repeat percutaneous coronary intervention and major adverse cardiovascular events (odds ratio 0.68, 95% confidence interval 0.57 to 0.81) with multivessel revascularization compared to CULPRIT. Similarly, for long-term outcomes (follow-up 2.0 ± 1.1 years), there was no difference for outcomes of MI, target vessel revascularization, and stent thrombosis, with 33%, 43%, and 53% decreases in risk of mortality, repeat percutaneous coronary intervention, coronary artery bypass grafting, respectively, and major adverse cardiovascular events (odds ratio 0.60, 95% confidence interval 0.50 to 0.72) with multivessel revascularization compared to CULPRIT. In conclusion, in patients with STEMI and MVD, multivessel revascularization appears to be safe compared to culprit artery-only revascularization. These findings support the need for a large-scale randomized trial to evaluate revascularization strategies in patients with STEMI and MVD."

They recommended that physicians substitute heparin for warfarin in their patients who have highly thrombotic conditions (e.g., a mechanical valve in the mitral position), and who will undergo high-risk procedures (e.g., polypectomy). The purpose of this study was to assess whether patient outcomes and anticoagulant management changed after the publication of the 1997 guidelines."
CD008201,0,17998439,0,Big strokes in small persons.,"Sickle cell disease (SCD) is understood on a genetic and a molecular level better than most diseases. Young children with SCD are at a very high risk of stroke. The molecular pathologic abnormalities of SCD lead to microvascular occlusion and intravascular hemolytic anemia. Microvascular occlusion is related to painful episodes and probably causes microcirculatory problems in the brain. The most commonly recognized stroke syndrome in children with SCD is large-artery infarction. These ""big strokes"" are the result of a vascular process involving the large arteries of the circle of Willis leading to territorial infarctions from perfusion failure or possibly artery-to-artery embolism. We can detect children who are developing cerebral vasculopathy using transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (TCD) and can provide effective intervention. Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography measures blood flow velocity in the large arteries of the circle of Willis. Velocity is generally increased by the severe anemia in these patients, and it becomes elevated in a focal manner when stenosis reduces the arterial diameter. Children with SCD who are developing high stroke risk can be detected months to years before the stroke using TCD. Healthy adults have a middle cerebral artery velocity of approximately 60 cm/s, whereas children without anemia have velocities of approximately 90 cm/s. In SCD, the mean is approximately 130 cm/s. Two independent studies have demonstrated that the risk of stroke in children with SCD increases with TCD velocity. The Stroke Prevention Trial in Sickle Cell Anemia (STOP) (1995-2000) was halted prematurely when it became evident that regular blood transfusions produced a marked (90%) reduction in first stroke. Children were selected for STOP if they had 2 TCD studies with velocities of 200 cm/s or greater. Children not undergoing transfusion had a stroke risk of 10% per year, which was reduced to less than 1% per year by regular blood transfusions. Stroke risk in all children with SCD is approximately 0.5% to 1.0% per year. On the basis of STOP, if the patient meets the high-risk TCD criteria, regular blood transfusions are recommended. A second study was performed (2000-2005) to attempt withdrawal of transfusion in selected children in a randomized controlled study. Children with initially abnormal TCD velocities (> or =200 cm/s) treated with regular blood transfusion for 30 months or more, which resulted in reduction of the TCD to less than 170 cm/s, were eligible for randomization into STOP II. Half continued transfusion and half had cessation of transfusion. This trial was halted early for safety reasons. There was an unacceptably high rate of TCD reversion back to high risk (> or =200 cm/s), as well as 2 strokes in children who discontinued transfusion. There are no evidence-based guidelines for the discontinuation of transfusion in children once they have been identified as having high risk based on TCD. The current situation is undesirable because of the long-term effects of transfusion, including iron overload. Iron overload has recently become easier to manage with the introduction of an oral iron chelator. The inflammatory environment known to exist in SCD and the known effect of plasma free hemoglobin, released by hemolysis, of reducing available nitric oxide may contribute to the development of cerebrovascular disease. Further research may lead to more targeted therapies. We can reduce many of the big strokes that occur in these small persons by aggressively screening patients at a young age (and periodically throughout the childhood risk period) and interrupting the process with regular blood transfusions."
CD008201,0,23223906,0,The short- and long-term risk of venous thromboembolism in patients with acute spinal cord injury: a prospective cohort study.,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a frequent complication in the acute setting after spinal cord injury (SCI). Less is known about the long-term risk of VTE in these patients. It was the aim of this study to prospectively evaluate the short- and long-term risk of VTE in a cohort of patients after acute SCI and during rehabilitation and post-rehabilitation follow-up period. From January 2003 to November 2007 all consecutive adult patients admitted to a Spinal Rehabilitation Unit (RU) after surgical treatment in three Neurosurgical Units for SCI, were enrolled. After an accurate evaluation of their neurosurgical medical records the patients were prospectively evaluated for VTE occurrence. Ninety-four patients (80 males; mean age 40.3 years, SD 15.9) were recruited. All the patients received thromboprophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin combined with compressive stockings during hospitalization (median duration 7 months, IQR 4.5-8.8). Over a median follow-up period of 36.3 months (IQR 4.4-48) after SCI, VTE was diagnosed in 22 patients (23.4%) The majority of VTE events were recorded during the first three months of follow-up (34.4 VTE events/100 patient-years in the first 3 months and 0.3 VTE events/100 patient-years thereafter); age over 45 years (HR 8.4, 95% CI 3-23.5), previous VTE (HR 6.0, 95% CI 1.6-23.3) and paraplegia (HR 4.7, 95% CI 1.6-13.7) were independently associated with the occurrence of VTE. In conclusion, the risk of VTE in patients suffering from SCI is high despite the use of thromboprophylaxis, in particular in some patients categories. However, this risk appears to be limited to the first 3 months after the index event."

The National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan was used to find hospitalised patients newly-diagnosed with cancer to determine the incidence of VTE in cancer patients and to identify the risk factors for VTE. Between 1997 and 2005, 497,180 cancer patients were identified. During a median follow-up of 21.3 months (range 0-119.9 months), 5,296 patients developed VTE. The estimated incidence was 185 events per 100,000 person-years. Patients with a prior history of VTE and female patients between the ages of 40 and 80 carried high risk of VTE. The rate of VTE was relatively high in patients with myeloma, prostate cancer, lung cancer, gynaecologic cancers, sarcoma, and metastasis of unknown origin. We developed a risk-stratification scoring system to divide the cancer patients into four discrete risk groups (very low risk, low risk, intermediate, and high risk). The incidence of VTE in each group was 0.5%, 0.9%, 1.5%, and 8.7%, respectively (p < 0.001). This scoring system was validated in a separate patient cohort. In conclusion, VTE is a distinct burden for cancer patients in Taiwan. The risk scoring system could prove helpful in decision-making concerning thromboprophylaxis in cancer patients."

The initial treatment consisted of heparin (7,500 U iv, 40,000 U sc), ethylbiscoumacetate (900 mg), phenprocoumon (9 mg), and a ready made compression stocking for the calf. The patients were advised to undertake frequent strolls, the first when leaving the office. Pain, swelling and incapacity for walking vanished within two days. The partial thromboplastintime was prolonged 2.4-times on the first day and the thromboplastintime was in the therapeutic range on the second day already. Until follow-up 4 patients died of other diseases. There was no clinical pulmonary embolism, no secondary hospitalisation and only one new DVT. Of 844 months of patients at risk of recurrence 50 % passed under anticoagulants and 70 % with compression therapy. At an average of 19 months, 82 % of patients were asymptomatic and 45 % showed mild chronic venous insufficiency.

CD008201,0,10021804,0,[Secondary stroke prevention].,"The guidelines for secondary stroke prevention, graded following available scientific evidence, are presented. Stroke and TIA are defined and the indications for referral established. Basic assessment of stroke patients should include laboratory evaluation, ECG, brain CT, ultrasound examination of the extracranial vessels for events in the carotid distribution, and transthoracic or transesophageal echocardiogram if cardioembolism is suspected. The pharmacological and non-pharmacological reduction of blood pressure and serum cholesterol, stopping smoking and reducing alcohol intake are general measures recommended for secondary stroke prevention, together with healthier life-style changes (eating a Mediterranean type diet and performing regular moderate physical exercise). Concerning antithrombotic therapy, oral anticoagulants are recommended for patients with atrial fibrillation and other high to medium emboligenic cardiac risk conditions. Antiplatelet drugs are recommended for all other survivors of an ischemic cerebral event. Aspirin (75-325 mg/day) is the drug of choice. Alternative antiplatelet agents are clopidrogrel, ticlopidine, dipiridamol or triflusal. They can be used in patients with intolerance or contraindication to aspirin or in high-risk subjects.

CD008201,0,24846228,0,Acute phase treatment of pulmonary embolism.,"Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common and potentially life threatening disease if left untreated. This is due to a natural tendency towards early recurrence of pulmonary emboli which may lead to right ventricular failure. Thus, anticoagulant treatment should be administered to all patients upon high or intermediate clinical probability of acute PE, while awaiting definitive confirmation by imaging procedures. With the exception of severe renal impairment, high bleeding risk, arterial hypotension, and extremes of body weight and age, unfractionated heparin has been replaced by low molecular-weight heparin or fondaparinux given subcutaneously at weight-adjusted doses. In hemodynamically unstable patients with confirmed (high-risk) PE, thrombolysis should be administered without delay; if thrombolysis is absolutely contraindicated or has failed, surgical embolectomy or catheter-based thrombus removal is a valuable alternative. In normotensive (non-high-risk) patients, low-molecular-weight heparin or fondaparinux is adequate treatment in most cases, and thrombolysis is generally not recommended as a first-line therapeutic option. An ongoing randomized trial will determine whether normotensive patients with evidence of right ventricular dysfunction plus myocardial injury may benefit from early thrombolysis. Finally, selected normotensive patients without serious comorbidity or signs of heart failure (low-risk PE) may be candidates for out-of-hospital treatment. This strategy may be facilitated by the use of new oral anticoagulants in the future."
CD008201,0,21614409,0,Ischaemic stroke and bleeding rates in 'real-world' atrial fibrillation patients.,"Stroke prevention guidelines recommend oral anticoagulants (OAC) for atrial fibrillation (AF) patients at moderate/high risk of stroke, and antiplatelet or no therapy for those at low/moderate risk. Outcomes for AF patients receiving antiplatelet/no therapy in 'real-life' clinical practice were explored. This study compared clinical event rates (stroke/bleeding) for AF patients treated with OAC therapy, antiplatelets or no therapy in usual clinical practice to event rates in OAC-treated AF patients from optimally-monitored 'real-life' settings (anticoagulation clinics). We searched biomedical literature (1994-2010) using PubMed to identify 'real-world' studies of clinical event rates for AF patients receiving OAC therapy, antiplatelets, or no therapy; event rates were extracted for each treatment and setting. We identified 136 studies of thromboembolic events and 86 of bleeding events. Ischaemic stroke rates (30 studies) were higher for AF patients receiving no therapy (median: 4.45/100 person-years; range: 0.25-5.9) or antiplatelet-therapy (median: 4.45/100 person-years; range: 2.0-10) compared to OAC-treated patients monitored in anticoagulation clinics (median: 1.72/100 person-years; range: 0.97-2.00), or from a non-specialized setting (median 1.66/100 person-years; range: 0-4.9). Major bleeding rates (32 studies) for patients receiving antiplatelet/no therapy were similar to OAC-treated patients from both clinical settings. As in randomised clinical trials, AF patients in 'real-world' clinical practice receiving antiplatelet/no therapy have higher rates of ischaemic stroke than OAC-treated patients. Antiplatelet/no therapy was associated with similar bleeding rates to OAC therapy. Increasing utilisation of anticoagulants in clinical practice could improve patient outcomes."
CD008201,0,20107758,0,[Prophylaxis for thromboembolism in internal medicine and family practice].,"Although up to 80% of fatal pulmonary emboli occur in nonsurgical patients, conclusive studies on the prevention of thrombosis have only become available in the last 10 years. Bedridden inpatients with acute medical diseases require pharmacologic prophylaxis for thrombosis with unfractionated or low molecular weight heparin or with fondaparinux. This also holds true for patients with underlying malignancies or those suffering from acute ischemic stroke or paretic leg. The challenges to thrombosis prophylaxis are posed by ensuring that uninterrupted prophylaxis is continued after hospital discharge in cases of persisting risk, determining the indications and applying thrombosis prophylaxis on an outpatient basis as well as the multimorbidity and often advanced age of the internal medicine patients. The last factor not only entails an elevated risk of thromboembolism but also an increased risk of hemorrhage, especially in patients with renal insufficiency or platelet inhibitors. Product-specific recommendations and restrictions on pharmacologic prophylaxis need to be considered. Thromboprophylaxis as applied in internal medicine and family practice represents an effective measure to prevent symptomatic and fatal thromboembolisms, but due to multimorbidity and polytherapy of medical patients it requires careful monitoring."
CD008201,0,23452730,0,Venous thrombosis during assisted reproduction: novel risk reduction strategies.,Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) affects 5% of IVF cycles and incurs a 100-fold increase in risk of venous thrombosis over natural conceptions. Identification of women at risk of OHSS can be achieved using antral follicle count (AFC) and anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH). For those women with a high AFC or AMH combining a GnRH antagonist with a conventional hCG trigger will reduce the risk of OHSS and still allow a fresh transfer to occur. Complete abolition of OHSS is however now a reality by avoiding exposure to exogenous hCG. This can be achieved by segmentation of the IVF cycle using a GnRH agonist for final oocyte maturation and then freezing all oocytes or embryos with subsequent replacement of a single embryo in the context of a frozen embryo transfer. This novel approach will ensure a VTE risk equivalent to natural conception and can be combined with conventional thromboprophylaxis strategies.

Patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery (MOS) represent a population with high risk of VTE, which may remain asymptomatic or become symptomatic as deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. Numerous trials have investigated LMWH thromboprophylaxis in this population and demonstrated high efficacy and safety of these substances. However, LMWHs have a number of disadvantages, which limit the acceptance of patients and physicians, especially in prolonged prophylaxis up to 35 days after MOS. Consequently, new oral anticoagulants (NOACs) were developed that are of synthetic origin and act as direct and very specific inhibitors of different factors in the coagulation cascade. The most developed NOACs are dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban, all of which are approved for thromboprophylaxis in MOS in a number of countries around the world.

CD008201,0,25559613,0,Systemic thrombolysis for acute pulmonary embolism.,"Acute pulmonary embolism is a frequent cause of hospitalization and is associated with a wide range of symptom severity. Anticoagulants are the mainstay of treatment for acute pulmonary embolism; however, in patients with massive or submassive pulmonary embolism, advanced therapy with thrombolytics may be considered. The decision to use thrombolytic therapy for acute pulmonary embolism should be based on careful risk-benefit analysis for each patient, including risk of morbidity and mortality associated with the embolism and risk of bleeding associated with the thrombolytic. Alteplase is currently the thrombolytic agent most studied and with the most clinical experience for this indication, although the most appropriate dose remains controversial, especially in patients with low body weight. When considering thrombolysis, unfractionated heparin is the preferred initial anticoagulant due to its short duration of action and its reversibility should bleeding occur."
CD008201,0,26648615,0,How to manage warfarin therapy.,"Long-term treatment with warfarin is recommended for patients with atrial fibrillation at risk of stroke and those with recurrent venous thrombosis or prosthetic heart valves. Patient education before commencing warfarin - regarding signs and symptoms of bleeding, the impact of diet, potential drug interactions and the actions to take if a dose is missed - is pivotal to successful use. Scoring systems such as the CHADS2 score are used to determine if patients with atrial fibrillation are suitable for warfarin treatment. To rapidly achieve stable anticoagulation, use an age-adjusted protocol for starting warfarin. Regular monitoring of the anticoagulant effect is required. Evidence suggests that patients who self-monitor using point-of-care testing have better outcomes than other patients."
CD008201,0,10549719,0,Venous thromboembolic prophylaxis in orthopedic surgery: knee surgery.,"Knee replacement surgery is associated with a high risk of venous thromboembolic complications, and the risk appears to be highest during the 7 days following surgery. Meta-analysis of a number of randomized, controlled trials has conclusively established the efficacy and safety of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) prophylaxis in knee replacement surgery. It is clear that LMWHs exhibit distinct physico-chemical, biological, and pharmacodynamic properties, and recently the United States Food and Drug Administration has concluded that these are noninterchangeable drugs. The clinical experience with each LMWH varies widely, and the paucity of data on thromboprophylaxis with LMWHs other than enoxaparin limits relevant comparisons of efficacy and safety. Further clinical trials with different LMWHs are indicated and will help resolve the issue of LMWH inequivalence currently at the center of debate."
CD008201,0,10582776,0,Preventing thromboembolic complications in older orthopaedic surgery patients: interventions and outcomes.,"The aging of the population in developed countries has been associated with a growing burden of degenerative joint disease and hip fracture, and this has contributed to a progressive increase in the utilisation of major hip and knee arthroplasty. In the absence of effective thromboprophylaxis, patients undergoing major orthopaedic surgery are at high risk of deep vein thrombosis, which may in turn lead to life-threatening complications such as pulmonary embolism, as well as long term sequelae including the post-thrombotic syndrome. However, increasing age is also associated with an increased risk of venous thromboembolism, and older orthopaedic patients are, therefore, at particularly high risk. Randomised trials have demonstrated that the risk of venous thromboembolism in these patients, as demonstrated by venography, can be reduced by more than 50% with the use of effective thromboprophylaxis. However, antithrombotic agents such as low molecular weight heparin and warfarin, which are widely used for the prevention of venous thromboembolism, are also associated with an increased risk of bleeding complications, and selection of the most appropriate strategy should, therefore, involve consideration of the potential risks as well as benefits of the currently available interventions."

Studies have been performed examining the utility of frequent duplex scans. However, these studies included patients outside of the intensive care unit. The incidence of venous thromboembolism and the effect of a less intense surveillance protocol was prospectively examined at a level-1 urban trauma center for a 6 month period. During the study period there were 726 admission to the surgical intensive care unit. Sequential compression devices (SCDs) were used for DVT prophylaxis in 93 per cent of the admissions. A total of 114 duplex scans were ordered: 42 per cent for surveillance and the rest for evaluation of a clinical indication. Twelve DVTs were discovered (11% overall DVT rate). No patient on subcutaneous heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin developed a DVT or pulmonary embolism (PE). Four patients suffered a PE; however, none were found to have a lower extremity DVT on duplex ultrasound and all received SCD prophylaxis. Overall, proper use of DVT prophylaxis for intensive care unit days 1-14 was 77 per cent. The incidence of venous thromboembolism in a group of patients at overall high risk was low. A program of DVT surveillance with duplex ultrasound was not cost-effective."

CD008201,0,25586333,0,A comparison of patients diagnosed with pulmonary embolism who are ≥65 years with patients <65 years.,"Recent studies have highlighted differences in how older patients respond to high-risk pulmonary embolism (PE) and treatment. However, guidelines for PE risk stratification and treatment are not based on age, and data are lacking for older patients. We characterized the impact of age on clinical features, risk stratification, treatment, and outcomes in a sample of patients with PE in the emergency department. We performed an observational cohort study of 547 consecutive patients with PE in the emergency department from 2005 to 2011 in an urban tertiary hospital. We used bivariate proportions and multivariable logistic regression to compare clinical presentation, risk category, treatment, and outcomes in patients ≥65 years with those <65 years. The mean age was 58 ± 17 years, 276 (50%) were women, and 210 (38%) were ≥65 years. PE was more severe in patients ≥65 years (massive 14% vs 5%, submassive 48% vs 25%, and low risk 38% vs 70%, p <0.0001), with submassive PE being the most common presentation in patients ≥65 years. However, subanalysis removing natriuretic peptides from the definition of submassive PE negated this finding. Treatment with parenteral anticoagulation (88% vs 90%, p = 0.32), thrombolytic therapy (5% vs 4%, p = 0.87), and inferior vena cava filter (4% vs 4%, p = 0.73) were similar among age groups. Patients ≥65 years had higher 30-day mortality (11% vs 3%, p <0.001). In conclusion, patients ≥65 years present with more severe PE and have higher mortality, although treatment patterns were similar to younger patients. Age-specific guideline definitions of submassive PE may better identify high-risk patients."

Each such event is associated with the risk of morbidity and mortality, plus substantial healthcare costs. Consequently, the American College of Chest Physicians guidelines recommend low-molecular-weight heparins, fondaparinux or vitamin K antagonists (usually warfarin) after total hip and knee arthroplasty. However, such agents are also associated with healthcare costs for administration and monitoring. New oral anticoagulants in development may reduce post-arthroplasty symptomatic thromboembolic events and produce potential savings for the healthcare system.

CD008201,0,26455025,0,[Pulmonary embolism in pregnancy].,"Pulmonary embolism (PE) is very rarely observed during pregnancy and postpartum period. The frequency of PE in pregnant women is relatively difficult to assess because the existing data estimate all venous-thromboembolic (VTE) complications including deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and PE. The incidence of PE itself has been evaluated on 3 cases per 10000 deliveries. Diagnostics of PE during pregnancy is very difficult and requires unequivocal confirmation or exclusion because of exposure of fetus to potential complications of antithrombic therapy. Very important is to assess the clinical probability of PE with note of potential risk factors (including Well's score using), precision medical history and physical examination. Noninvasive examinations: ECG, echocardiography, venous compression USG and laboratory tests: arterial blood gas analysis and level of dimer D. According to the current ESC guidelines CT angiography should be considered if the chest X-ray is abnormal or if lung scintigraphy is not readily available (class IIa). Perfusion scintigraphy may be considered to rule out suspected PE in pregnant women with normal chest X-ray. (Class IIb). A weight-adjusted dose of LMWH is recommended therapy during pregnancy in patients without shock or hypotension. In high-risk patients thrombolytic therapy is justified.

Pathogenesis of thrombosis in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia: effects of host environment.,"This concluding section of the series will evaluate the role of host environment in the development of thromboembolism (TE) in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The available evidence suggests that TE in association with childhood ALL is a multifactorial entity resulting from the interaction of the disease, chemotherapy and its effects, and possible prothrombotic states inherent to the host. The few studies conducted so far in children with ALL have reported wide variability in the prevalence of prothrombotic defects and its impact on the risk of TE. The prevalence of prothrombotic defects varies in different ethnic population. Since different ALL therapy studies use different chemotherapeutic agents in various dosage and combination, it is important that every major study group assesses the risk of TE, including the prevalence of prothrombotic defects, within their therapy plan. This will help to identify the population at risk for TE and for thromboprophylaxis, if indicated."

CD008201,0,17323292,0,[Gender differences in vascular medicine].,"In vascular medicine only a few studies concerning gender differences in vascular diseases, course of the disease and therapy exist. Risk factors are allocated differently between men and women with different influences on cardiovascular diseases. Diabetic women do have a particular high risk. The proportion of women smokers with a risk for aggravation of the other risk factors is increased. In young female smokers the hypoplastic aortoiliac syndrome is a special course of peripheral arterial disease associated with a bad prognosis. The benefit of hormone replacement therapy in vascular diseases of postmenopausal women has not yet been demonstrated. On the other hand testosterone seems to have a favourable effect on vascular diameter and endothelium of coronaries. Women with peripheral arterial disease represent high risk patients with a particular risk for cardiovascular letality. Periprocedural complications of the analysed operations or interventions are found more frequent in women. Furthermore the disease is in an advanced stage when treated. Especially men with asymptomatic high grade carotid stenosis benefit more from an operation than women because of the higher risk for ischemic stroke. Unfortunately the benefit of the operation in women is neutralized by the higher rate of periprocedural complications. Some studies demonstrate the gender bias in treatment: women seldom receive revascularisation and guideline therapy as frequently as men. The same is true with thromboembolic prophylaxis concerning in hospital patients. In pharmacotherapy women have in result of metabolism more side effects. Additionally women are underrepresented in drug admission studies compared to their percentage of population and gender prevalence of diseases. Further studies concerning gender differences in vascular medicine are definitely needed."

In the last decades we found many data concerning the association between a hypercoagulable state and its causes and adverse pregnancy outcome, in particular recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL). First studies which focused on the association between thrombophilia and RPL underlined the role of reduced clotting inhibitors and RPL, and subsequent studies underlined a pathogenetic role of gene variant associated to hypercoagulable state in the occurrence of RPL. On the other hand, acquired thrombophilic abnormalities as antiphipsholipid syndrome are a well known cause of RPL and should be considered for a screening. These data are relevant because recent studies suggested a role of an extensive thromprophilaxis in women with RPL that should be addressed only in case of known thrombophilia and high risk of venous thromboembolism."

Doppler spectra were obtained at three sites in each graft and the following waveform parameters recorded: maximum systolic velocity, minimum diastolic velocity and resistance index. In patent reconstructions systolic velocity decreased by 30% during the first 6 months after surgery. In the absence of arteriovenous fistulas the initially antegrade diastolic velocity was replaced by a retrograde flow within 3 months, whereas a forward flow in diastole was sustained in grafts with patent fistulas. Abnormal Duplex findings in 31 patients led to angiography and revision in 13 cases. Four revised grafts failed, while nine remained patent at follow-up 1-12 months later. Ten (56%) of 18 non-revised bypasses with abnormal Duplex findings failed within 9 months compared to 1 (1%) of 76 bypasses with a normal velocity profile (p < 0.00001). In conclusion, Ultrasound Duplex scanning with spectral analysis provides valuable information concerning haemodynamics of infrainguinal vein bypasses and identifies grafts at risk of thrombosis. Inclusion of low resistance index (< 0.75) as an additional criteria for detection of stenoses appears to improve the sensitivity of Duplex scanning."

A high level of comorbidity and general anaesthesia were strong risk factors for both VTE and bleeding, with no difference between THR and TKR patients. The risk of both MI and stroke was 0.5%, which remained unchanged during the study period. In this cohort study of patients undergoing THR and TKR patients in routine clinical practice, approximately 3% experienced VTE, MI, stroke or bleeding.

CD008201,0,22682881,0,Cancer and contraception. Release date May 2012. SFP Guideline #20121.,"As a result of advances in cancer diagnosis and treatment, young women within the reproductive-aged group are now more likely to survive cancer. Reproductive-aged women with cancer may be interested in deferring pregnancy either temporarily or permanently at cancer diagnosis, during therapy or after treatment. Currently, there are limited guidelines to aide clinicians in managing the contraceptive needs in this special population. After reviewing the evidence regarding the safety and efficacy of available methods of contraception for women who have been diagnosed with cancer, the Society of Family Planning recommends that women of childbearing age who are being treated for cancer avoid combined hormonal contraceptive methods (containing estrogen and progestin) when possible because they may further increase the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) (Level A). The copper T380A intrauterine device, a highly effective, reversible, long-acting, hormone-free method, should be considered the first-line contraceptive option for women with a history of breast cancer (Level A), although for women being treated with tamoxifen, the levonorgestrel-containing intrauterine system (IUS) which decreases endometrial proliferation may be preferable (Level B). Women who develop anemia may benefit from use of a progestin-containing contraceptive (Level A). Women who develop osteopenia or osteoporosis following chemotherapy should avoid the progestin-only contraceptive injection (Level B). More information is needed in many areas. There are insufficient data to evaluate the risk of VTE when progestin-only contraceptives are used by women at high risk of VTE. Information is also needed on whether the levonorgestrel-containing IUS affects the risk of breast cancer recurrence and whether hormonal contraceptives affect the risk of breast cancer among women who have received chest wall, or ""mantle field,"" radiation. Finally, studies of the safety and effectiveness of IUS use by women who are immunosuppressed and studies of whether progestin-only contraceptives affect the risk of fracture among cancer survivors or, more generally, women with osteopenia would be useful."

It is well established that maintaining oral anticoagulation is associated with an increased risk of bleeding in the periprocedural period while discontinuing anticoagulant therapy postoperatively leads to an elevated risk for thromboembolic events, especially in high risk patients. Nowadays there is growing evidence to maintain antiplatelet therapy with acetylsalicylic acid (ASS, Aspirin®) perioperatively in a setting of secondary prophylaxis. Beyond that the increasing routine clinical use of novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs), such as the direct factor IIa inhibitor dabigatran and the direct factor Xa inhibitors rivaroxaban and apixaban, presents a challenge for urological surgeons. These agents are approved in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (rivaroxaban, dabigatran and apixaban) and in patients after deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism (rivaroxaban). Due to their relatively short elimination half-lives and rapid onset of action, these new drugs have the potential to simplify periprocedural anticoagulant management making heparin bridging therapy redundant. Critical consideration is necessary regarding potential pitfalls, such as impaired renal function, insufficient possibility of laboratory monitoring and lack of antidotes in cases of postoperative hemorrhage. Although periprocedural protocols for the use of NOACs are emerging, robust clinical data are still scarce. This article provides a practical, clinician-focused approach to periprocedural management of NOACs."
CD008201,0,23076776,0,Venous thromboembolism in cirrhosis.,"The cirrhosis population represents a unique subset of patients who are at risk for both bleeding and developing venous thromboembolic events (VTEs). It has been commonly misunderstood that these patients are naturally protected from thrombosis by deficiencies in coagulation factors. As a result, the cirrhosis population is often falsely perceived to be ""autoanticoagulated."" However, the concept of ""autoanticoagulation"" conferring protection from thrombosis is a misnomer. While patients with cirrhosis may have a bleeding predisposition, not uncommonly they also experience thrombotic events. The concern for this increased bleeding risk often makes anticoagulation a difficult choice. Prophylactic and therapeutic management of VTE in patients with cirrhosis is a difficult clinical problem with the lack of clear established guidelines. The elucidation of laboratory and/or clinical predictors of VTE will be useful in this setting. This review serves to examine VTE and the use of anticoagulation in the cirrhosis population."
CD008201,0,23116094,0,Patterns in neurosurgical adverse events: endovascular neurosurgery.,"As part of a project to devise evidence-based safety interventions for specialty surgery, the authors sought to review current evidence in endovascular neurosurgery concerning the frequency of adverse events in practice, their patterns, and current methods of reducing the occurrence of these events. This review represents part of a series of papers written to consolidate information about these events and preventive measures as part of an ongoing effort to ascertain the utility of devising system-wide policies and safety tools to improve neurosurgical practice. Based on a review of the literature, thromboembolic events appeared to be the most common adverse events in endovascular neurosurgery, with a reported incidence ranging from 2% to 61% depending on aneurysm rupture status and mode of detection of the event. Intraprocedural and periprocedural prevention and rescue regimens are advocated to minimize this risk; however, evidence on the optimal use of anticoagulant and antithrombotic agents is limited. Furthermore, it is unknown what proportion of eligible patients receive any prophylactic treatment. Groin-site hematoma is the most common access-related complication. Data from the cardiac literature indicate an overall incidence of 9% to 32%, but data specific to neuroendovascular therapy are scant. Manual compression, compression adjuncts, and closure devices are used with varying rates of success, but no standardized protocols have been tested on a broad scale. Contrast-induced nephropathy is one of the more common causes of hospital-acquired renal insufficiency, with an incidence of 30% in high-risk patients after contrast administration. Evidence from medical fields supports the use of various preventive strategies. Intraprocedural vessel rupture is infrequent, with the reported incidence ranging from 1% to 9%, but it is potentially devastating. Improvements in device technology combined with proper endovascular technique play an important role in reducing this risk. Occasionally, anatomical or technical difficulties preclude treatment of the lesion of interest. Reports of such occurrences are scant, but existing series suggest an incidence of 4% to 6%. Management strategies for radiation-induced effects are also discussed. The incidence rates are unknown, but protective techniques have been demonstrated. Many of these complications have strategies that appear effective in reducing their risk of occurrence, but development and evaluation of systematic guidelines and protocols have been widely lacking. Furthermore, there has been little monitoring of levels of adherence to potentially effective practices. Protocols and monitoring programs to support integrated implementation may be broadly effective."
CD008201,0,8856785,0,Physician practices in the prevention of deep vein thrombosis: the MassPRO DVT Study.,"Numerous well-designed clinical trials have demonstrated that prophylaxis reduces the incidence of acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in high-risk surgical patients by two-thirds, with a corresponding reduction in mortality from pulmonary embolism. However, studies of clinical practices suggest that DVT prophylaxis is underused-for example, only 39% of high-risk surgical patients in 16 central Massachusetts hospitals were administered DVT prophylaxis in 1986. Subsequently, an intensive educational initiative was launched to improve utilization of DVT prophylaxis. Although some improvement was reported, the level of use was not optimal. The Massachusetts Peer Review Organization (MassPRO) DVT study was designed to gather data on recent practice patterns among Massachusetts surgeons and determine the need for additional educational and quality assurance efforts. The results indicate that there is broad compliance among orthopedic surgeons with consensus recommendations for the use of DVT prophylaxis. Nearly all patients who undergo total hip replacement in Massachusetts are protected from DVT by one or more methods of prophylaxis. These data suggest that the ongoing efforts to improve the use of DVT prophylaxis in Massachusetts since 1986 have come to fruition, at least with respect to total hip replacement."
CD008201,0,23033232,0,Drug-drug interactions between warfarin and psychotropics: updated review of the literature.,"As the number of psychotropics on the market expands, the likelihood increases that a patient requiring anticoagulation with warfarin will receive concurrent treatment with a psychotropic drug. Because warfarin undergoes hepatic metabolism and is highly protein bound, it is particularly prone to drug interactions; in addition, its relatively narrow therapeutic window places patients at risk of either hemorrhagic or thrombotic complications. Although warfarin's interactions with other drugs have long been studied, the most recent review of the literature of warfarin's interactions with psychotropics was over a decade ago. Thus, we conducted a systematic review of the literature documenting the interaction between warfarin and psychotropics, with a focus on interactions mediated through the cytochrome P450 system and protein binding. A search of the MEDLINE database was performed, and reports of warfarin interactions with psychotropics were identified. The results suggest that interactions between warfarin and psychotropic drugs are important and likely underrecognized. They also have notable implications for both safety and drug compliance. When certain psychotropics are started or discontinued in patients receiving warfarin therapy, or when warfarin is introduced to a patient receiving a stable dose of a psychotropic, clinicians should monitor a patient's international normalized ratio (INR) closely to ensure it remains within therapeutic range. Psychotropics that pose a particular risk of increasing the INR when used with warfarin include fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, quetiapine, and valproic acid. Psychotropics that may significantly decrease the INR when used with warfarin include trazodone, St. John's wort, carbamazepine, and the polycyclic aromatic carbons in tobacco cigarettes; however, nicotine itself, as in nicotine replacement strategies, is not known to alter warfarin's anticoagulant effect. In certain cases, the need for anticoagulation may also necessitate switching to a different psychotropic."
CD008201,0,11915482,0,[Anesthesia-resuscitation for intracranial expansive processes in children].,"The most frequent space-occupying cerebral lesions in children are brain tumors, mostly posterior fossa tumors and haematoma resulting from arteriovenous malformation rupture. They result in intracranial hypertension, directly or by compression of the cerebrospinal fluid pathway resulting in hydrocephalus. Their localization and compressive effects are responsible for specific neurological deficits and general problems. Posterior fossa lesions carry a high risk of obstructive hydrocephalus, cranial nerves palsy and brain stem compression, pituitary and chiasmatic tumors a risk of blindness, pituitary deficiency and diabetes insipidus, and cortical tumors a risk of motor deficit and epilepsy. All these parameters must be analyzed before choosing anaesthetic protocols, and surgical techniques. In the presence of life-threatening intracranial hypertension, emergency anaesthetic induction, tracheal intubation and ventilation are life-saving. The specific treatment consists in either hydrocephalus derivation, initial medical treatment with osmotherapy, or rarely surgical removal. In other situations, surgical process requires a highly deep, stable anaesthesia with perfect control of cerebral haemodynamics. Surgical positioning is complex for these long lasting procedures and carries specific risks. The most common is venous air embolism in the sitting position that must be prevented by the use of specific measures. In the postoperative period, the risk of neurological and general complications commands close surveillance, fast track extubation must be adapted on an individual basis."

CD008201,0,23197272,0,Efficacy and safety of thromboprophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin or rivaroxaban in hip and knee replacement surgery: findings from the ORTHO-TEP registry.,"Prospective trials have shown that rivaroxaban thromboprophylaxis is superior over low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) in patients undergoing hip and knee replacement surgery. However, patients treated under trial conditions are different from unselected routine patients, which may affect efficacy and safety of thromboprophylaxis. The objective was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban or LMWH thromboprophylaxis in unselected patients undergoing hip and knee replacement surgery in daily care. In a monocentric, retrospective cohort study in 5,061 consecutive patients undergoing hip and knee replacement surgery a comparison of LMWH (hospital standard in 2006-2007) and rivaroxaban (since 2009) was made with regard to rates of symptomatic VTE, bleeding and surgical complications and length of hospital stay. Rates of symptomatic VTE were 4.1 % (LMWH) and 2.1 % (rivaroxaban; p=0.005) with rates for distal DVT 2.5 vs. 1.1 % (p<0.001). Rates of major VTE were numerically higher with LMWH (1.7 vs. 1.1%, not statistically significant). Rates of major bleeding (overt bleeding leading to surgical revision or death, occurring in a critical site, or transfusion of at least two units of packed red blood cells) were statistically lower with rivaroxaban (2.9 vs. 7.0%; p<0.001). Rivaroxaban patients had fewer surgical complications (1.1 vs. 3.7%; p<0.001) and a shorter length of hospitalisation (8.3 days; 95% CI 8.1- 8.5 vs. 11.1 days; 10.7- 11.5; p< 0.001). We conclude that rivaroxaban thromboprophylaxis is more effective than LMWH in unselected patients undergoing hip and knee replacement surgery in daily care and that switching from LMWH to rivaroxaban could be beneficial. Prospective comparisons are warranted to confirm our findings."

CD008201,0,1650746,0,Role of granulocytes in the development of venous thrombosis in patients with hip fractures.,"In a previously reported study we compared the use of a low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) and conventional heparin in the thromboprophylaxis of patients with hip fracture. In an attempt to establish additional factors which could aid in predicting the development of deep-venous thrombosis (DVT), we retrospectively studied several clinical and laboratory variables and found that granulocyte count on admission was higher in patients without subsequent postoperative DVT. Forty additional patients were included in a further prospective study in order to validate our previous findings. 38% of patients who developed DVT had a granulocyte count lower than 9,500/microliters, whereas only 18% of those patients with DVT had a count higher than 9,500/microliters. These figures imply a positive predictive value of 38% and a negative predictive value of 82%. We suggest that granulocytes could play a role in the development of DVT and preoperative granulocyte count may be used to detect a high-risk population for DVT after a hip fracture."

Risk classification is mainly based on clinical data; however, in those disorders associated with an elevated platelet count, discrimination of (true) essential thrombocythemia (ET) may be difficult without the possibility to recognize characteristic histopathological bone marrow patterns according to the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. Patients with ET reveal no relevant reduction of life expectancy and the impact of disease is significantly higher in elderly patients, especially in chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis (IMF) and polycythemia rubra vera (PV). In high-risk ET, the overall incidence of myelofibrotic transformation after 36 months of follow-up is 2.8% when considering the Polycythemia Vera Study Group guidelines. In contrast, classification according to WHO fails to show a relevant transformation into myelofibrosis either by clinical or morphological standards in (true) ET. Early stages of IMF show a more favorable outcome, but in multivariate risk classification, signs of myeloid metaplasia have the most important impact on prognosis. In PV, the risk for thrombosis increases with age, and furthermore, signs of generalization are generally associated with a worsening of prognosis. It has been shown that examination of bone marrow specimens enhances the diagnostic reliability and also enables the recognition of evolving myelofibrotic transformation in MPDs."

ICAD is more prevalent in Asian, Hispanic, and African-American populations. Patients who have had a stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) attributed to stenosis (50-99%) of a major intracranial artery face a 12-14% risk of subsequent stroke during the 2-year period after the initial ischemic event, despite treatment with antithrombotic medications. The annual risk of subsequent stroke may exceed 20% in high-risk groups. The medical treatment of patients with symptomatic ICAD is directed toward: 1. Prevention of intraluminal thrombo-embolism, 2. plaque stabilization and regression, and 3. management of atherogenic risk factors. In patients with ICAD, short-term and long-term anticoagulation (compared with aspirin) have not shown to be beneficial. The current guidelines recommend that aspirin monotherapy, the combination of aspirin and extended release dipyridamole, and clopidogrel monotherapy (rather than oral anticoagulants) are all acceptable options in patients with non-cardioembolic ischemic stroke and TIA. Overall, the subgroup analysis from randomized trials provides evidence about benefit of aggressive atherogenic risk factor management among patients with ICAD. Intracranial angioplasty with or without stent placement has evolved as a therapeutic option for patients with symptomatic ICAD, particularly those with high-grade stenosis with recurrent ischemic symptoms and/or medication failure. A matched comparison between medical-treated patients in the Warfarin Aspirin Symptomatic Intracranial Disease (WASID) study and stent-treated patients in the National Institutes of Health intracranial stent registry concluded that stent placement may offer benefit in patients with 70-99% stenosis. The 5-year, multicenter, prospective, randomized Stenting and Aggressive Medical Management for Preventing Recurrent stroke in Intracranial Stenosis study supported by the National Institutes of Health is currently comparing stent placement with intense medical management with intense medical management alone in patients with high-grade symptomatic intracranial stenosis. The proceedings of the consensus conference provide a template for standardizing management of patients with ICAD and determining research priorities."

The environment of dialysis care is extremely complex. Dialysis patients have unique and changing physiology, and the processes required for their routine care involve numerous open-ended interfaces between providers and an assortment of technologically advanced equipment. Communication errors, both within the dialysis facility and during care transitions, and lapses in compliance with policies and procedures are frequent areas of safety risk. Some events, such as air emboli and needle dislodgments occur infrequently, but are serious risks. Other adverse events include medication errors, patient falls, catheter and access-related infections, access infiltrations and prolonged bleeding. A robust safety system should evaluate how multiple, sequential errors might align to cause harm. Systems of care can be improved by sharing the results of root cause analyses, and ""good catches.""

CD008201,0,19816608,0,Should we give thromboprophylaxis to patients with liver cirrhosis and coagulopathy?,"Patients with liver cirrhosis are characterized by decreased synthesis of both pro- and anticoagulant factors, and recently there has been evidence of normal generation of thrombin resulting in a near normal haemostatic balance. Although it is generally recognized that bleeding is the most common clinical manifestation as a result of decreased platelet function and number, diminished clotting factors and excessive fibrinolysis, hypercoagulability may play an under recognized but important role in many aspects of chronic liver disease. In fact, they can encounter thrombotic complications such as portal vein thrombosis, occlusion of small intrahepatic vein branches and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). In particular, patients with cirrhosis appear to have a higher incidence of unprovoked DVT and pulmonary embolism (PE) compared with the general population. In dedicated studies, the incidence of DVT/PE ranges from 0.5% to 1.9%, similar to patients without comorbidities, but lower than patients with other chronic diseases (i.e, renal or heart disease). Surprisingly, standard coagulation laboratory parameters are not associated with a risk of developing DVT/PE; however, with multivariate analysis, serum albumin level was independently associated with the occurrence of thrombosis. Moreover, patients with chronic liver disease share the same risk factors as the general population for DVT/PE, and specifically, liver resection can unbalance the haemostatic equilibrium towards a hypercoagulable state. Current guidelines on antithrombotic prophylaxis do not specifically comment on the cirrhotic population as a result of the perceived risk of bleeding complications but the cirrhotic patient should not be considered as an auto-anticoagulated patient. Therefore, thromboprophylaxis should be recommended in patients with liver cirrhosis at least when exposed to high-risk conditions for thrombotic complications. Low molecular weight heparins (LWMHs) seem to be relatively safe in this group of patients; however, when important risk factors for bleeding are present, graduated compression stockings or intermittent pneumatic compression should be considered."

In Japan, there was a 15.8% incidence of DVT and a 0.34% incidence of PE, with 0.08% of patients experiencing fatal PE in a population of abdominal surgery patients. The incidences of PE and fatal PE in our department were 0.11% and 0.03%, respectively. We started to use intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) for the prophylaxis of postoperative PE in 1999 and then added elastic stockings in 2002 and low-dose unfractionated heparin (LDUH) in 2003 for prophylaxis. The incidence of PE has dropped and that of fatal PE has become 0% with the use of such prophylactic measures. When the risk of venous thromboembolism of the 15 patients who experienced PE in our department were assessed using the Japanese Guidelines for Prevention of Venous Thromboembolism, 13 patients were assessed as high risk and 2 as low risk. The mean age and mean body mass index of the 15 patients were 54 yeas old and 24.8, respectively, and PE was not limited to obese or elderly patients. Such findings appear to indicate the difficulty of risk assessment for PE. Therefore we started to use IPC, elastic stockings, and LDUH for the prophylaxis of PE and DVT for all general surgery patients from April 2004. These prophylactic measures are recommended for the highest-risk patients in the Japanese Guidelines for Prevention of Venous Thromboembolism.

Bemiparin was effective as thromboprophylaxis in surgical patients in well controlled clinical trials. No cases of venous thromboembolism (VTE) were reported in low- to moderate-risk patients receiving prophylaxis with bemiparin 2500 anti-Xa IU/day for 7 days or unfractionated heparin (UFH) 5000 anti-Xa IU twice daily for 7 days.

As a short-term treatment for acute established deep vein thrombosis (DVT), bemiparin 5000-10 000 anti-Xa IU/day (dependent on bodyweight) for 7 or 10 days was more effective than intravenous UFH (5000 anti-Xa IU bolus followed by 30,000 or 40,000 anti-Xa IU/day for 7 days) in reducing thrombus size from baseline. Bemiparin 3500 anti-Xa IU/day was also as effective as oral warfarin (10 mg/day for the first 3 days, then adjusted to achieve an international normalised ratio between 2 and 3) for the long-term (12 weeks) treatment of DVT, although data are limited. Subcutaneous bemiparin was generally well tolerated. The most commonly reported adverse events in clinical trials were postoperative bleeding complications (similar incidence to that with UFH or enoxaparin in high-risk patients, lower incidence in low- to moderate-risk patients)."

CD008201,0,23953906,0,NOACs for thromboprophylaxis in medical patients.,"The risk of venous thrombosis extends for an indeterminate length of time following admission to hospital with a medical or surgical condition. Observational studies in surgery show this risk extends for months and perhaps more than one year, for medical patients the risk extends for at least several weeks. Large bodies of evidence support the heightened risk status of hospitalised surgical and medical patients, and that prophylactic measures significantly reduce the risk of thrombosis. Extending thromboprophylaxis for 4-6 weeks with anticoagulants both old and new has been shown to be efficacious and safe in surgical patients. However in populations of medical patients although prolonged anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis has been shown to be efficacious it also results in more bleeding and the risk benefit is not clear. Hence no therapies are approved for prolonged thromboprophylaxis in medical patients.

CD008201,0,26157492,0,Venous Thromboembolism-Incidence of Deep Venous Thrombosis and Pulmonary Embolism in Patients with Head and Neck Cancer: A Tertiary Care Experience in Pakistan.,"Introduction Although venous thromboembolism (VTE) is seen with morbidity and mortality in various surgical specialties, scarce data are available in the head and neck surgery domain. Objective We aim to determine the incidence of VTE in patients receiving surgery for head and neck cancer. Methods Four hundred thirteen patients who underwent head and neck surgery procedures between 2005 and 2013 were reviewed retrospectively. All patients with head and neck surgery had received thromboprophylaxis (i.e., compression stockings and subcutaneous heparin). Patient demographics, operating time, and length of hospital stay were analyzed. The incidence of symptomatic deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) during the initial postoperative hospitalization was assessed. Results Twelve patients were identified who developed VTE. Three patients developed DVT, and nine developed PE. The incidence of DVT and PE was 0.72 and 2.17%, respectively. Interestingly, all of these patients had undergone excision of extensive head and neck cancers accompanied by a reconstructive procedure. Patients who developed PE had a longer hospital stay compared with those who only had DVT. There were overall three mortalities in the nine patients who developed PE. Conclusion Although VTE has a low incidence, it is a known complication of extensive head and neck surgeries with life-threatening outcomes. We recommend early mobilization and physiotherapy with the possible aid from appropriate mechanical and pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis."

To determine current thromboprophylaxis practice a questionnaire was sent to 184 consultant surgeons thought to be involved in breast cancer surgery, of whom 137 responded (74%). Eleven surgeons no longer dealt with breast cancer patients. Of the remaining 126, thromboprophylaxis was given routinely by 88 (69.8%), with the commonest regimens being subcutaneous heparin only (n=43) and heparin combined with compression stockings (n=20). Patients with breast cancer were regarded as being at high risk of thromboembolic complications by 65 clinicians in this group (73.7%). Thirty-eight consultants did not use thromboprophylaxis routinely, the most commonly stated reasons were low/no risk of DVT (n=24), because of early postoperative mobilization (n=20) and increased risk of bleeding complications (n=15). Twenty clinicians reported a total of 22 deep venous thromboses and two pulmonary emboli affecting patients under their care who had surgery for breast cancer during the preceding year. Almost 70% of surgeons routinely employ thromboprophylaxis in patients undergoing breast cancer surgery but practice varies widely."

Antiplatelet medications prevent emboli and thrombus formation to avert further vascular occlusion and ischemia. Aspirin, clopidogrel (Plavix), and extended release aspirin/dipyridamole (Aggrenox) represent the mainstay of secondary prevention of ischemic and transient ischemic stroke. Although antiplatelet medications prevent platelet aggregation by different mechanisms, the end result is a significantly decreased risk of secondary stroke, myocardial infarction, and death.

CD008201,0,21881387,0,Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis after hospital discharge: transition to preventive care.,"Deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, the common clinical manifestations of venous thromboembolism (VTE), are among the most preventable complications of hospitalized patients. However, survey data repeatedly show poor rates of compliance with guideline-based preventive strategies. This has led the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to deny reimbursement for hospital readmission for thromboembolic complications in patients undergoing total hip or knee arthroplasty. Multiple strategies and national initiatives have been developed to improve rates of VTE prophylaxis during hospitalization; however, most VTE occurs in the outpatient setting. Epidemiologic data suggest that recent surgery or hospitalization is a strong risk factor for the development of VTE and that this risk may persist for up to 6 months. These observations call into question whether VTE prophylaxis should be administered only during hospitalization or if this preventive strategy should be continued after hospital discharge. Many of the randomized trials showing efficacy of VTE prophylaxis have used longer durations of prophylaxis than are typical for current length of hospital stay, highlighting the issue of how long the duration of prophylaxis should be. Several patient groups have undergone formal testing to evaluate the risks and benefits of extended-duration VTE prophylaxis, but this issue is less clear for other categories of patients. Although there is clear consensus that most hospitalized patients should receive VTE prophylaxis, there is uncertainty about whether to continue VTE prophylaxis in the immediate post-hospital period or for an extended duration. The transition from inpatient to outpatient care is a key event in the coordination of continuity of care, but VTE-specific care transition guidance is limited. In this article, we review the evidence for both standard- and extended-duration VTE prophylaxis and discuss the difficulties in effectively maintaining VTE prophylaxis during the transition from inpatient to outpatient care."

CD008201,0,23915217,0,Concept of a point of care test to detect new oral anticoagulants in urine samples.,"New oral anticoagulants (NOAC) are approved for several indications for prophylaxis and treatment of venous thromboembolism and for prevention of embolism in atrial fibrillation at fixed daily doses without need of laboratory guided dose adjustment. Due to their low molecular weight of about 500 to 600 Dalton and their hydrophilicity free anticoagulant is excreted immediately through glomerular filtration into the urine. Impairment of renal function may increase the plasma concentration of the anticoagulants and lowered creatinine clearance is a declared contraindication. In contrast to the initial aim of development the anticoagulant effect is required to be determined in special clinical situations. Several specific and non-specific assays using plasma samples are currently undergoing standardization. As all NOACs are excreted into the urine, specific assays were developed for this matrix to determine them quantitatively of qualitatively. Urine samples can be easily and repetitively obtained avoiding problems and risks associated with blood sampling. The qualitative assay can be performed as a point of care test (POC) also by the patient by judging the different colours for the absence or presence of the drugs with the naked eye. The test is rapid (results available within 15 min), sensitive, specific and accurate and does not require a purified NOAC as control. The tests may be a tool for clinicians who need to know for treatment decisions if a NOAC is on board or not. As the tests are specific for oral direct thrombin inhibitors and for oral direct factor Xa inhibitors, the indication does not interfere with other qualitative POC test in development using clotting systems. The test may be indicated for patients at acute hospitalization, before surgery or central nervous system puncture anaesthesia, if fibrinolytic therapy is indicated, acute deterioration of renal function, and for control of adherence to therapy."

Low-molecular-weight heparin had been given while the patients were in hospital. There were 5607 patients. The cumulative incidence of symptomatic venous thromboembolism was 2.7% (150 of 5607), of which 1.1% had developed pulmonary embolism, 1.5% had deep venous thrombosis and 0.6% had both. Patients presented with deep venous thrombosis at a median of 24 days and pulmonary embolism at 17 days after surgery for hip fracture. After total hip replacement, deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism occurred at a median of 21 and 34 days respectively. After total knee replacement, the median time to the presentation of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism was 20 and 12 days respectively. The cumulative risk of venous thromboembolism lasted for up to three months after hip surgery and for one month after total knee replacement.

CD008201,0,18581077,0,[Clopidogrel--clinical use and potential therapeutic problems].,"Platelet activation is a major component in the pathogenesis of coronary thrombosis and myocardial infarction. Therefore, antiplatelet therapy has become the cornerstone in the therapy of ischemic heart disease. Thienopyridines, especially clopidogrel, have a highly significant effect on treated patients with regard to reduction of stent thrombosis and functional inhibition of adenosine diphosphate-(ADP-)induced platelet activation. Clopidogrel, a specific inhibitor of the P2Y(12) ADP receptor, is a prodrug which releases the active compound after metabolization. Actual ACC/AHA/SCAI guidelines recommend the use of 75 mg clopidogrel once daily after stent implantation. Nevertheless, there is a high incidence of impaired clopidogrel responsiveness in patients potentially leading to subacute stent thrombosis and other adverse cardiovascular events following coronary interventions (incidence of about 1% within the first 4 weeks). Therefore, individual risk testing and adjusted antiplatelet therapy might be recommendable under certain circumstances, e.g., high-risk interventions such as last patent vessel, dominant vessel, or planned drug-eluting stent implantation. Furthermore, identification of a nonresponder requires increased clinical attention. Newly developed antiplatelet substances might overcome the nonresponse problem and allow sufficient platelet inhibition in all patients. Further prospective studies are needed to determine the risk reduction by an individually adjusted antiplatelet therapy."
CD008201,0,26245659,0,Current Status of Antiplatelet Therapy in Acute Coronary Syndrome.,"Antiplatelet therapy is a first-line medical treatment for patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). As percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) increase in number and complexity, more patients must be treated with antiplatelet therapy for cardiovascular diseases in which arterial thrombosis plays a major role. Current anti-platelet therapy is highly effective in preventing atherothrombotic complications. Nevertheless, a significant number of patients continue to experience recurrent complications despite being properly treated, due to pharmacokinetics and interactions of drugs, genetic background and increased thrombus formation. This has lead to big research efforts to provide new antiplatelet drugs with better preventive properties without increased bleeding risk. Up to 8% of patients receiving 81 mg-dose of aspirin have significantly less platelet inhibition than those receiving higher dose. Patients with poor responsiveness to clopidogrel are at high risk of thromboembolic complications, especially in the setting of ACS and stent implantation. Several options have been proposed. Firstly, to increase loading and maintenance doses up to 600 mg and 75-mg twice daily associated with high-dose aspirin (300-325 mg). A second option would be to change from clopidogrel to new antiplatelet agents like prasugrel and ticagrelor which were investigated in large clinical trials in patients with different entities of ACS. Because of conflicting results & without large scale clinical studies, routine platelet function measurement cannot be recommended at this point of time. Prasugrel is an ADP-P2Y12 receptor inhibitor that has a faster and more consistent inhibitory effect of platelet aggregation and was shown to reduce cardiovascular mortality in the setting of ACS undergoing PCI. Subgroups with increased risk of bleeding were patients with prior stroke, age over 75 and body weight under 60 kg. In this population, prasugrel is discouraged despite its increased in efficacy. Ticagrelor binds reversibly to P2Y12 receptor. The reversibility action makes it attractive for situations when dual antiplatelet therapy needs to be interrupted. Both the drugs demonstrated superiority with respect to the primary composite endpoint. As compared to clopidogrel, both prasugrel and ticagrelor do not depend on loss-of-function genetic variants. The efficacy safety ratio of both compared to clopidogrel is better, even if both these compounds increased the risk of spontaneous major bleedings significantly. Due to lack of head-to-head comparison, potential differences between prasugrel and ticagrelor are hypothetical and both these drugs should be used according to guidelines. The novel intravenous antiplatelet cangrelor cut thrombotic complications of PCI with some increase in bleeding, a pooled analysis of the three CHAMPION(Cangrelor versus Standard Therapy to Achieve Optimal management of Platelet Inhibition) trials showed. Protease-activated-receptor 1(PAR 1) antagonist vorapaxar did not reduce the primary composite ischemic end point in TRACER (Thrombin Receptor Antagonist Clinical Event reduction in acute coronary syndrome) trial, but major bleeding and intracranial hemorrhage rates were substantially increased. Further large randomized trials would be required to decide the superiority of one agent over another and the duration of the therapy."
CD008201,0,19261307,0,[Is there still a role for recombinant erythropoietin in the management of anaemia of critical illness?].,"There is a high prevalence of anaemia among patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), and it may have a negative effect on patient's outcome. The most common treatment for anaemia in the ICU patient is allogeneic blood transfusion (ABT), yet it has been found to be a risk factor associated with an increased risk of morbidity and mortality in critical care patients. As a reduction of erythropoietin secretion and action is observed in most ICU patients, the administration of (rHuEPO) has emerged as a therapeutic option. Unfortunately, the results from different studies show that rHuEPO treatment results in a small reduction of ABT requirements when ""restrictive"" transfusion criteria are applied, which has only been supported by three of the studies. Yet this did not result in a decreased mortality rate, except for patients with a diagnosis on admission of trauma in two studies, even though one study reported a dose-dependent increase of thrombotic vascular events among patients without thromboprophylaxis. Altogether, clinical data suggest a role for rHuEPO in the treatment of anaemia in trauma patients, especially in those sustaining neurotrauma, whereas for non-trauma patients without an approved indication, rHuEPO administration is an expensive approach, does not seem to improve outcome, and might result in serious adverse effects. Consequently, more basic and clinical studies are required to ascertain which patients are more likely to benefit from these treatments, as well as to identify the optimal doses and administration schedules, and iron administration."

However, the guidelines were created based on studies evaluating BMS and DES only. We performed an analysis of patients undergoing non-urgent percutaneous coronary intervention with the novel endothelial cell capturing stent (ECS). The ECS is coated with CD34(+) antibodies that attract circulating endothelial progenitor cells to the stent surface, thereby accelerating the endothelialization of the stented area. We analyzed all patients enrolled in the worldwide e-HEALING registry that met the NICE criteria for either low-risk or high-risk lesions and were treated with ≥1 ECS. The main study outcome was target vessel failure (TVF) at 12-month follow-up, defined as the composite of cardiac death or MI and target vessel revascularization (TVR). A total of 4,241 patients were assessed in the current analysis. At 12-month follow-up, TVF occurred in 7.0% of the patients with low-risk lesions and in 8.8% of the patients with high-risk lesions (p = 0.045). When evaluating the diabetic patients versus the non-diabetic patients per risk group, no significant differences were found in TVF, MI or TVR in either risk group. The ECS shows good clinical outcomes in lesions carrying either a high or a low risk of restenosis according to the NICE guidelines with comparable rates of cardiac death, myocardial infarction, and stent thrombosis. The TVF rate with ECS was slightly higher in patients with high-risk lesions, driven by higher clinically driven TLR. The risk of restenosis with ECS in patients carrying high-risk lesions needs to be carefully considered relative to other risks associated with DES. Furthermore, the presence of diabetes mellitus did not influence the incidence of TVF in either risk group."

To provide an overview of cause, risk factors, current treatment strategies, and complications associated with VTE prophylaxis, we reviewed the most current, best available evidence on VTE prophylaxis for patients with hip fractures. We comprehensively reviewed the literature to assess the efficacy of VTE prophylaxis in patients with hip fractures, including the most recent published guidelines by national medical and surgical health organizations from the UK, USA, and Canada. Mechanical devices are effective in reducing the risk of VTE for hip fracture, but poor patient compliance is common and the devices are not recommended for sole VTE prophylaxis. Aspirin reduces the risk of VTE but does not provide optimal protection compared with other chemical agents; therefore, it is not recommended for sole VTE prophylaxis. Fondaparinux, warfarin, low-molecular-weight heparin, and unfractionated heparin reduce the risk of venographic deep vein thrombosis, but there is insufficient evidence that they reduce fatal pulmonary embolism or all-cause mortality. Fondaparinux is considered to be cost effective and more efficacious than low-molecular-weight heparin. At present, most major health organizations advocate at least 28 days of postoperative chemical prophylaxis. Chemical VTE prophylaxis should be administered to all patients with hip fractures unless contraindicated.

Since then, the 1-year cadaver graft and patient survival rates have been 87% and 97%, respectively, for both primary and repeat transplants, including various categories of high-risk recipients. 2. Delayed graft function, HLA matching, and percent prior sensitization were major determinants of graft survival. Race, age, and diabetes were not significant determinants of graft outcome. 3. Small children had a 94% 1-year graft survival rate following cadaver transplantation. Sequential immune suppression, the use of large kidneys, and careful perioperative fluid management to prevent graft thrombosis may be responsible for the graft survival rate. 4. Long-term (1 year) results continue to show deterioration in graft survival. Many patients are hypertensive and hypercholesterolemic. Many children are noncompliant with medications."

CD008201,0,10875429,0,The rationale for long-term prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism.,"Prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism (VTE) after surgery has traditionally been given from the time of surgery until hospital discharge, typically ranging from 5-14 days. Recently, there has been a trend toward shorter periods of hospitalization. Furthermore, a number of prospective studies have demonstrated that a significant proportion of patients develop deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) up to 5 or 6 weeks following general or orthopedic surgery. Therefore, prolonged prophylaxis during the post-discharge period may provide clinical benefits in high-risk patients. However, the optimal duration of prophylaxis for VTE after surgery remains unclear. In elective hip replacement, four studies of prolonged prophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) for 3- 4 weeks after hospital discharge demonstrated a significant reduction in the incidence of venography-confirmed DVT. These results support the use of prolonged thromboprophylaxis in the outpatient setting. Effective outpatient prophylaxis must be safe and convenient for patients to maximize compliance and clinical benefits. Low-molecular-weight heparins are safe and effective when given at a fixed daily dose, and pharmacoeconomic studies suggest that prolonged prophylaxis with these agents may be cost-effective. Key challenges for the future include identifying the patients who require prolonged prophylaxis and determining the duration of treatment."

Multifaceted quality improvement (QI) activities are needed for sustained improvement at the individual institution level. This work describes a QI initiative for VTE prophylaxis in surgery that combined clinical education with Crew Resource Management (CRM)--a set of principles and techniques for communication, teamwork, and error avoidance used in the aviation industry. Surveys of clinicians participating in the initiative demonstrated immediate and retained confidence and increased knowledge in identifying process-related factors leading to errors, applying CRM to patient care, and identifying VTE prophylaxis candidates and guideline-recommended prophylaxis regimens. Reviews of patient charts preinitiative and postinitiative demonstrated performance improvement in meeting guideline recommendations for the timing, inpatient duration, and use of VTE prophylaxis beyond discharge. This new model joins continuing medical education with CRM to improve the appropriate use of VTE prophylaxis in surgery."

CD008201,0,19752334,0,Venous thromboembolism in the hematologic malignancies.,"Patients with hematologic malignancies are at high risk of thrombotic or hemorrhagic complications. The incidence of these events is greatly variable and is influenced by many factors, including the type of disease, the type of chemotherapy, and the use of a central venous device. As in solid tumors, a number of clinical risk factors have been identified and contribute to the increasing thrombotic rate in hematologic malignancies. Biologic properties of the tumor cells can influence the hypercoagulable state of patients with these malignancies by several mechanisms. Of interest, oncogenes responsible for neoplastic transformation in leukemia also may be involved in clotting activation. Epidemiologic data allow an estimate of the incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in acute leukemia, lymphomas, and multiple myeloma (MM). In this review, we focus on the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and VTE management in these three hematologic malignancies. No recommendation for routine thromboprophylaxis in these conditions, with the exception of MM, is available. Large, prospective, randomized clinical trials are needed to establish the best practice for thromboprophylaxis and treatment of VTE in these types of cancers."
CD008201,0,7598418,0,Aspects of hernia surgery in Wales.,"The management of elective inguinal herniorrhaphy in Wales was assessed by means of a postal survey of consultant general surgeons. This included technique of repair, length of inpatient stay, follow-up, use of heparin thromboprophylaxis and advice regarding driving, strenuous activities and work. In all, 54 replies (77%) were received. The views of patients on their surgery was assessed by a questionnaire sent to 80 patients treated on a single surgical unit; 60 replies (75%) were received. Waiting times were relatively short among this group, 67.5% of patients being treated within 6 months of seeking medical advice; 16.25% suffered a complication. All wound infections occurred after discharge and 15% of patients had some groin discomfort 6 months after operation. Accuracy of clinical examination of 50 inguinal hernias by different grades of surgeon was assessed. Consultants were significantly more accurate when compared with house officers (P < 0.001). There is a wide range of repair techniques and postoperative advice practised by consultant general surgeons in Wales. Patients' main complaint was that of a sparsity of postoperative advice, although there also appears to be an appreciable postoperative morbidity. Clinical experience plays a significant role in assessment of the suitability of hernias for surgery."

CD008201,0,8647576,0,[-Anticoagulant drugs-].,"In todays medicine, anticoagulant drugs like heparin and coumadin derivatives have become indispensable for the treatment of thrombo-embolic diseases. Heparin, consisting of long poly-sulfated polysaccharide chains of variable length and sequences is mostly derived from porcine mucosa. Its bioavailability by other than the parenteral way of administration is almost negligible. Therefore, with only few exceptions, it is almost exclusively applied in hospitalized patients (short-term therapy) or to bridge 2 phases of treatment with oral anticoagulant drugs. Today, besides the conventional high-molecular weight heparins, new fractionated heparins are gaining more and more attention. They offer the advantage of a more reliable resorption from the subcutaneous tissue and thus warrant reliable plasma levels. In many recent randomized trials of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, those fractionated heparins have proven to successfully substitute for intravenously applied, aPTT-controlled unfractionated heparin. It remains however open, whether this also translates into the prevention of arterial thrombo-embolic diseases. Heparin may not pass through the placental barrier nor into the milk and is regarded non-teratogenic. Therefore, it may be regarded the ideal anticoagulant for pregnant women and lactating mothers. Those women, however, still carry the heparin-associated risk of bleeding and osteoporosis. In comparison: Coumadin derivatives interfere with the carboxylation of the clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X as well as proteins C and S. By inhibiting the synthesis of these proteins they shift the haemostatic balance to a lower level. In addition, they are almost completely bioavailable by the enteral pathway. They are, therefore, regarded the drugs of choice for long-term anticoagulant therapy in patients at particular thromboembolic risk. For their therapeutic range, being extremely narrow, meticulous drug monitoring by repeated INR-measurements as well as a reliable compliance of the patient to drug intake and dietary restrictions are mandatory to exclude phases with over- or under-anticoagulation. Above all, coumadin therapy is characterized by numerous drug interactions. Thus, whenever the basal medication is changed, for whatever reason, more intense care must be laid to drug monitoring, and the intervals for INR determinations must transiently be shortened. Coumadin derivatives do pass through the placental barrier and in minor amounts also into the milk of breast feeding mothers. Furthermore, they are highly teratogenic. If taken during pregnancy, malformations of the central nervous system are reported to occur in some 10% to 30% of the infants. Thus during pregnancy and in the lactation period, coumadin therapy should be avoided. Bleeding episodes of different severity are the most frequent adverse effects of anticoagulant therapy, no matter whether heparin or coumadin is given. There is a direct relation between the intensity of anticoagulant therapy and the frequency of bleeds. Luckily, most bleeding episodes do not create major therapeutic problems. In case of severe bleeds, however, the anticoagulant therapy must immediately be suspended. In case of coumadin therapy the immediate administration of 4 packs of PPSB (prothrombin-complex-concentrates) or FFP (fresh-frozen-plasma) with concomitant low doses of heparin is additionally advised. Allopecia diffusa, urticartia and allergic reactions are known side effects of anticoagulant therapy. Patients on long-term heparin may also suffer from severe osteoporosis. On the other hand, heparin treatment raises the hazzards of a HAT-Syndrome (heparin-associated thrombocytopenia) (estimated frequency 0.01% to 0.1% of treated patients), giving rise to severe and life-threatening thrombo-embolic side effects predominantly in the arterial tree. In these cases, heparin must be suspended despite those severe thrombo-embolic episodes."
CD008201,0,23386224,0,"Rationale supporting an ""opt-out"" policy for pharmacological venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in hospitalized medical patients.","Pulmonary embolism is the number one cause of preventable death among hospitalized patients. Prescription of either low dose low molecular weight heparin, such as enoxaparin or dalteparin, or prescription of low dose fondaparinux can halve the rate of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, without increasing major bleeding complications. Nevertheless, there has been a ""failure-to-prophylax"" syndrome, especially among hospitalized medical patients at risk. One approach is to mandate venous thromboembolism prophylaxis for these patients without exception or flexibility. The alternative approach is to institute or maintain an ""opt-out"" policy so that the responsible clinician can make the final decision as to whether the benefits of prophylaxis outweigh the risks. This paper, makes the case for an ""opt-out"" policy, so that we can personalize, individualize, and humanize our medical care. Such an approach permits flexibility, encourages collaborative ""buy-in"" to the concept of prophylaxis, and allows the clinician to withhold anticoagulation in special situations that do not fit prespecified protocols. Ultimately, such an ""opt-out"" policy might make VTE prophylaxis more effective by avoiding anticoagulation of low thrombosis risk patients who are at high risk of bleeding complications."

CD008201,0,25403719,0,The geko™ electro-stimulation device for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis: a NICE medical technology guidance.,"The geko™ device is a single-use, battery-powered, neuromuscular electrostimulation device that aims to reduce the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) selected the geko™ device for evaluation, and invited the manufacturer, Firstkind Ltd, to submit clinical and economic evidence. King's Technology Evaluation Centre, an External Assessment Centre (EAC) commissioned by the NICE, independently assessed the evidence submitted. The sponsor submitted evidence related to the geko™ device and, in addition, included studies of other related devices as further clinical evidence to support a link between increased blood flow and VTE prophylaxis. The EAC assessed this evidence, conducted its own systematic review and concluded that there is currently limited direct evidence that geko™ prevents VTE. The sponsor's cost model is based on the assumption that patients with an underlying VTE risk and subsequently treated with geko™ will experience a reduction in their baseline risk. The EAC assessed this cost model but questioned the validity of some model assumptions. Using the EACs revised cost model, the cost savings for geko™ prophylaxis against a 'no prophylaxis' strategy were estimated as £197 per patient. Following a second public consultation, taking into account a change in the original draft recommendations, the NICE medical technologies guidance MTG19 was issued in June 2014. This recommended the adoption of the geko™ for use in people with a high risk of VTE and when other mechanical/pharmacological methods of prophylaxis are impractical or contraindicated in selected patients within the National Health Service in England."

Among other things, AF patients are at high risk of stroke. Patients are often prescribed oral anticoagulation, such as vitamin K antagonists (VKA), to mitigate these risks. A recently introduced class of oral anticoagulants, non-vitamin K antagonists (NOAC), is quickly gaining currency in global clinical practice. This study provides insight into the changes these new drugs will bring about in Dutch clinical practice.GARFIELD-AF is a large-scale observational AF patient registry initiated in 2009 to track the evolution of global anticoagulation practice, and to study the impact of NOAC therapy in AF in particular. The registry includes a wide array of baseline characteristics and has a particular focus on: (1) bleeding and thromboembolic events; (2) international normalised ratio fluctuations; and (3) therapy compliance and persistence patterns. The results in this paper provide the baseline characteristics of the first cohorts of Dutch participants in this registry and discuss some of the consequences of the changes in anticoagulation practice.Although VKA therapy remains overwhelmingly favoured by Dutch practitioners, NOACs are clearly gaining in popularity. Between 2011 and 2014, NOACs constituted an increasingly large proportion of prescriptions for oral anticoagulants.The insights provided by the GARFIELD-AF registry can be used by healthcare systems to inform better budgetary strategies, by practitioners to better tailor treatment pathways to patients, and finally to promote awareness of the various available treatment options and their associated risks and benefits for patients."
CD008201,0,16369969,0,Prophylaxis of central venous catheter-related thrombosis with minidose warfarin in patients treated with high-dose chemotherapy and peripheral-blood stem-cell transplantation: retrospective analysis of 228 cancer patients.,"Patients with a central venous catheter (CVC) undergoing high-dose chemotherapy (HDC) followed by peripheral-blood stem-cell transplantation (PBSCT) for malignancies are at high risk of thrombosis, but the use of anti-coagulant prophylaxis remains debatable in this setting of patients. We analyzed the efficacy and the safety of minidose warfarin in 228 patients in whom CVCs had been placed and who had received 292 HDC courses of therapy. The catheters remained in place for a mean of 173 (range 40-298) days. All patients received prophylactic oral warfarin in the fixed dose of 1 mg/day starting on the day of CVC insertion. Prophylaxis was interrupted during aplasia when platelet counts fell below 50,000/dL. There were no toxic deaths related to the prophylaxis. Overall there were 4 thrombotic events. Three occurrences were directly related to the catheter, while the remaining event was a deep saphenous-vein thrombosis. A number of potential predictive factors were analyzed for their impact on thrombotic events without finding any significant correlation. Four episodes of bleeding occurred, with each of these individuals having a normal INR but a platelet count below 50,000/dL. Minidose warfarin is effective and safe to use for preventing thrombotic events in this setting of patients."

Successful haemostasis can be achieved by bolus doses or continuous infusion (CI) using either recombinant (r) or plasma-derived (pd) factor IX (FIX). We retrospectively analysed our experience of factor replacement to cover TKR in haemophilia B patients and explored factors related to FIX use during surgery. Between 2000 and 2010, 13 primary TKRs were performed in 11 haemophilia B patients. Operations were performed by the same surgeon using standard techniques. Median age was 58 years (42-79). An adjusted CI protocol was used for 5 days followed by bolus doses. FIX:C was maintained at 100 IU dL(-1) in the immediate postoperative period. There was no excess haemorrhage. There was no evidence of thrombosis or infection. All patients received mechanical thromboprophylaxis and only one chemical. CI was used in seven cases. Ten patients received pdFIX. Median hospital stay was 14 days (8-17). Median factor usage was 999 IU kg(-1) (768-1248). During CI, factor consumption was 695 IU kg(-1), 691 IU kg(-1) and 495 IU kg(-1) for BeneFix®, Replenine® and Haemonine, respectively. Clearance of both pdFIX and rFIX reduced during CI. All operations were uncomplicated. The decreased clearance in the CI setting reduced the amount of FIX required to maintain a therapeutic level. This reduction was greater with pdFIX and may be related to pharmacokinetic differences between pdFIX and rFIX. Given the excellent safety profile of the pdFIX products, CI of FIX and particularly pdFIX is safe, efficacious and convenient."

Although coronary angioplasty has become modern treatment of stable angina as well as of acute coronaries, acute occlusion of the vessel is still a serious problem. The prognosis of patients undergoing coronary angioplasty can be substantially improved by accurate evaluation of the risk of possible complications during or shortly after the procedure and by development of more effective anticoagulants. Research provided evidence that platelets play a decisive role in the formation of occlusive thrombi and that the thrombocyte glycoproteins IIb/IIIa are the basic mediator of platelet aggregation. Newly developed inhibitors of these receptors reduce acute ischaemic complications after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. Conclusions of various trials support the inclusion of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors in the standard therapeutic protocol of patients undergoing coronary angioplasty, in particular those with a high risk because of acute occlusion of the vessel after operation."

The principal aim of treatment of a venous thromboembolism with heparin and warfarin is to prevent extension or recurrence of clot. However, the recurrence rate following a deep vein thrombosis remains approximately 10% per annum following treatment cessation irrespective of the duration of anticoagulation therapy. Patients with raised D-dimer levels after discontinuing oral anticoagulation treatment have also been shown to be at high risk of recurrence.Post thrombotic syndrome is a complication of a deep vein thrombosis which can lead to chronic venous insufficiency and ulceration. It has a cumulative incidence after 2 years of around 25% and it has been suggested that extended oral anticoagulation should be investigated as a possible preventative measure."
CD008201,0,14718318,0,Relationship between deep venous thrombosis and the postthrombotic syndrome.,"The postthrombotic syndrome (PTS) is a frequent complication of deep venous thrombosis (DVT).

Because of its prevalence, severity, and chronicity, PTS is burdensome and costly. Preventing DVT with the use of effective thromboprophylaxis in high-risk patients and settings and minimizing the risk of ipsilateral DVT recurrence are likely to reduce the risk of development of PTS. Daily use of compression stockings after DVT might reduce the incidence and severity of PTS, but consistent and convincing data about their effectiveness are not available.

However, 20-30% of patients with AF have co-existing coronary artery disease (CAD). Importantly, since the prevalence of both AF and CAD increase with age, management of these patients has become an emerging clinical problem with the ever growing elderly population. In particular, many of these patients may develop an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or require percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), leading to the concomitant use of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) including aspirin and a P2Y12 receptor inhibitor in addition to OAC, also known as triple antithrombotic therapy (TAT).

The majority of VTE events are associated with transient periods of heightened risk, such as prolonged hospitalization, undergoing major surgery, experiencing trauma or lower extremity immobility, use of oral contraceptives, or having active cancer. Although pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis agents (eg, unfractionated heparin, low-molecular-weight heparins, warfarin, and novel oral anticoagulants) are effective, they remain underused, with concerns about increased bleeding risk often cited as a reason. The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (ie, statins), although used primarily for lipid lowering and arterial thrombosis risk reduction, have pleiotrophic effects that affect coagulation and inflammation, and do not increase bleeding risk. There is emerging evidence to suggest that through these pleiotrophic effects, statins may be effective in reducing the incidence of VTE. This article summarizes the literature with regard to statins' effect on VTE and suggests that additional investigations are needed to assess a potential adjunctive role for primary VTE thromboprophylaxis."

As a consequence, many attempts to reduce the damage resulting from cerebral ischemia under more highly oxidized conditions have focused on treatments aimed at maintaining the redox equilibrium of the local environment. This study demonstrates the synergistic effects of combining treatments with alpha-lipoic acid (LA) and vitamin E (VE) as an efficient measure to reduce the damage caused by cerebral ischemia. Two oral therapeutic protocols were examined: intensive treatment (100 mg/kg LA and 140 mg/kg VE for 7 days after ischemia) and prophylactic treatment (20 mg/kg LA and 50 mg/kg VE from 30 days before infarction up to the day of sacrifice). The prophylactic treatment reduced serum lipid peroxidation, and diminished brain infarct volume by approximately 50%. Furthermore, prophylactically treated rats showed a reduction in post-ischemia neurological scores. No significant differences were found in the intensively treated group. Our data indicate that pre-ischemia administration of the LA-VE antioxidant mixture reduced the volume of brain damaged and the functional consequences of embolic infarction.

We summarize our ""top ten list"" of papers that are likely to change the care of the anticoagulated population and improve their outcomes: (1) Patient self-management of their vitamin K antagonist and self monitoring can decrease thromboembolic events; (2) restarting warfarin after gastrointestinal bleeding may decrease mortality; (3) rivaroxaban is effective in the treatment of pulmonary embolism; either (4) apixaban or (5) low-dose aspirin prevented recurrent venous thromboembolic disease after a standard course of therapy; (6) warfarin prevents thrombotic complications up to at least 90 days after bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement; (7) the relative risk reduction of apixaban compared to warfarin is similar across CHADS2 scores, but the absolute risk reduction is higher in high-risk patients; (8) adherence to a warfarin dose-adjustment algorithm improved time in the therapeutic range and thromboembolic outcomes in the RE-LY trial; (9) warfarin had little benefit (if any) over aspirin in patients with decreased ejection fraction and sinus rhythm; (10) adding clopidogrel to aspirin in patients with lacunar infarcts did not reduce the risk of recurrent stroke and increased bleeding."
CD008201,0,17063098,0,New technology applications: thrombolysis of acute deep vein thrombosis.,"Treatment of deep vein thrombosis traditionally has focused on preventing the potentially life-threatening complication of pulmonary embolism rather than on removing or reducing the thrombus. Although treatment with anticoagulants may prevent thrombus propagation, the body's intrinsic thrombolytic system is left to attempt clot dissolution. Because this natural process is generally ineffective in its ability to fully recanalize a proximal vein, the risks of recurrent thrombosis as well as the disabling complication of postthrombotic syndrome increase. Moreover, the long-term consequences of postthrombotic syndrome include pain, disability, and, for many, a significant decrease in the quality of life. Recent technology using high-frequency, low-power ultrasound, or mechanical thrombectomy with catheter-directed delivery of a thrombolytic drug directly into the clot is available and showing promise. Nurses are caring for patients who receive endovascular interventions with lytic infusions. The nursing challenge is to provide safe and effective patient care."

This study aimed to determine VTE prophylaxis practices for inpatients in Turkey and to evaluate the impact of physicians' training via a modified ""Standard Medical Patients' VTE Risk Assessment Model (MERAM)."" A total of 607 inpatients included in this national multicenter noninterventional observational registry were evaluated in terms of demographics, VTE risk, and preventive measures at 2 consecutive cross-sectional visits. Physicians were asked to complete a questionnaire on current VTE method risk assessment and other models including MERAM. The VTE prophylaxis rates significantly increased from 49.4% to 62.4% between visits (P < .05). The lack of risk evaluation decreased from 74.6% to 19.5% (P < .001). Percentage of physicians using prophylaxis and use of MERAM increased between visits. Physician training proved effective for providing general ""awareness"" of VTE prophylaxis and led to higher rates of risk assessment model-based appropriate VTE prophylaxis."

CD008201,0,15320473,0,Low-molecular-weight heparins in acute coronary syndromes.,"Platelet aggregation, and activation of coagulation cascade are the key events in the development of acute coronary syndromes (ACS). Patients with this syndrome are at high risk of adverse events, such as death and myocardial infarction (MI). Optimized medical treatment for the non-ST segment elevation ACSs should consist of a combined anti-thrombotic/anti-anginal regimen. Standard anti-thrombotic treatment is currently unfractionated heparin (UH) and aspirin, and in high-risk patients glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors. UH has been shown to reduce the risk of death or myocardial infarction in aspirin-treated patients with ACSs, but it has a number of limitations, such as need for regular monitoring and the risk of hemorrhage and thrombocytopenia. Compared to UH, the low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) possess several important theoretical advantages for the treatment of patients with ACSs, including less non-specific binding, resistance to inactivation by platelet factor-4, more reliable anticoagulation effects, and greater factor anti-Xa activity. Recently published trials strongly support the use of LMWHs in the treatment of ACSs. These agents provide an alternative to UH that is at least as effective. The available evidence favours the use of these agents in acute cardiac care. This article explores the recent clinical data on the use of LMWHs in acute cardiac care, and looks critically at the differences between traditional therapies. Recommendations regarding the use of anti-thrombotic agents in patients with ACSs are also discussed."
CD008201,0,10364778,0,Management of atrial fibrillation: out-of-hospital approach.,"Atrial fibrillation is increasingly common with advancing age and is responsible for 10% of the half-million strokes that occur annually in the United States. When a patient presents with atrial fibrillation, the physician's first task is to use the history, physical examination, and electrocardiogram to determine whether hospitalization is necessary. Factors indicating a need for hospital care include evidence of infarction or ischemia, congestive heart failure, hypotension or hypoperfusion, excessive rate, or pre-excitation. In addition, if the episode began within 48 hours, consider early cardioversion, which also requires hospitalization. Next, the need for control of the ventricular rate should be assessed. A heart rate under 90 beats/min at rest and under 120 beats/min after 1 minute of step exercise is a reasonable goal. Dixogin usually controls the resting rate, but sometimes beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers are needed to control the exercise rate. The need for anticoagulation is determined by the presence of clinical risk factors such as valvular heart disease, previous thromboembolism, hypertension, age over 65 years, congestive heart failure, and left atrial enlargement. An echocardiogram is necessary to complete this assessment. Patients having one or more of these risk factors are most effectively treated with warfarin, as evident from several clinical trials. Although patients over age 65 demonstrate reduced thromboembolism with warfarin therapy, they also are more prone to cerebral hemorrhage, thus, their international normalization ratio (INR) should be kept at the lower end of the therapeutic range [2,3]. Other patients can be treated with aspirin, although stroke reduction in these patients may be more related to reduction of arterial thrombosis than thromboembolism. Patients under age 65 with no risk factors have a very low annual risk of stroke without therapy (approximately 1%). If symptoms persist or if this is a first episode in someone without left atrial enlargement, cardioversion can be considered after 3 weeks of warfarin therapy with INR in the therapeutic range. Otherwise, warfarin should be continued indefinitely. Prevention of recurrence with antiarrhythmic drugs is somewhat problematic because of incomplete efficacy (30% recurrence at 1 year) and the potential for inducing other, life-threatening arrhythmias."

CD008201,0,22398417,0,"Oral anticoagulation use by patients with atrial fibrillation in Germany. Adherence to guidelines, causes of anticoagulation under-use and its clinical outcomes, based on claims-data of 183,448 patients.","Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common significant cardiac rhythm disorder. Oral anticoagulation (OAC) is recommended by guidelines in the presence of a moderate to high risk of stroke. Based on an analysis of claims-based data, the aim of this contribution is to quantify the stroke-risk dependent OAC utilisation profile of German AF patients as well as the possible causes and the associated clinical outcomes of OAC under-use. Our data set was derived from two large mandatory German medical insurance funds. Risk stratification of patients was based on the CHADS2-score and the CHA2DS2-VASc-score. Two different scenarios were constructed to deal with factors potentially disfavouring OAC use. Causes of OAC under-use and its clinical consequences were analysed using multivariate analysis. Observation year was 2008. A total of 183,448 AF patients met the inclusion criteria. This represents an AF prevalence of 2.21%. The average CHADS2-score was 2.8 (CHA2DS2-VASc-score: 4.3). On between 40.5 and 48.7% of the observed patient-days, there was no antithrombotic protection by OAC, other anticoagulants or aspirin. Older female patients with a high number of comorbidities had a higher risk of OAC under-use. Patients who had already experienced a thromboembolic event had a lower risk of OAC under-use. In the observation year, 3,367 patients experienced a stroke (incidence rate 1.8%). In our multi-level Poisson random effects estimate, OAC use decreases the stroke rate by almost 80% (IRR 0.236). In conclusion, OAC under-use is widespread in the German market. It is associated with severe clinical consequences."

CD008201,0,24335403,0,New oral anticoagulants and regional anaesthesia.,"The new oral anticoagulants are approved for a variety of clinical syndromes, including the prevention of stroke in atrial fibrillation, acute coronary syndromes, treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE), and prevention of venous thrombosis after total joint surgery or hip fracture. Published guidelines have differing recommendations on the safe interval between discontinuation of the anticoagulant and performance of neuraxial procedures and between the interventional procedure and redosing of the drug. While two to three half-life intervals might be acceptable in patients who are at high risk for VTE or stroke, an interval of four to six half-lives between discontinuation of the drug and neuraxial injections is probably safer in most patients at low risk of thrombosis. In those with renal disease, the interval should be based on creatinine clearance. After a neuraxial procedure or removal of an epidural catheter, anticoagulants can be resumed within 24-48 h in most patients, but they can be taken sooner in patients who are at higher risk for VTE or stroke, that is, 24 h minus the time to peak effect of the drug. The new antiplatelet drugs prasugrel and ticagrelor should be stopped 7 or 5 days, respectively, before a neuraxial injection and can be restarted 24 h later. In selected situations, laboratory monitoring of the anticoagulant effect is appropriate, and reversal agents are suggested when there is a need to rapidly restore haemostatic function."
CD008201,0,11863301,0,Venous thrombosis from air travel: the LONFLIT3 study--prevention with aspirin vs low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) in high-risk subjects: a randomized trial.,"The LONFLIT1 and 2 studies established that in high-risk subjects after long (>10 hours) flights, the incidence of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) may be between 4% and 6%, The LONFLIT3 study aimed to evaluate methods of prevention in high-risk subjects. Of 467 subjects contacted for the study, 300 were included. These 300 subjects at high risk for DVT were randomized, after informed consent, into three groups: 1) a control group that had no prophylaxis; 2) an aspirin treatment group, in which patients were treated with 400 mg (tablets of oral, soluble aspirin; one dose daily for 3 days, starting 12 hours before the beginning of the flight); and 3) a low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) group, in which one dose of enoxaparine was injected between 2 and 4 hours before the flight. The dose was weight-adjusted (1,000 IU [equivalent to 0.1 mL per 10 kg of body weight). Subjects with potential problems due to prophylaxis with aspirin or LMWH or at risk of drug interactions were excluded. Of the 100 included subjects in each group, a total of 249 subjects completed the study (dropouts due to low compliance or traveling/connections problems were 17%). Age and sex distribution were comparable in the three groups as well as risk distributions. Mean age was 47 (range, 28-75; SD, 11; 65% males). Of the 82 subjects in the control group, there were 4.82% of subjects with DVT with two superficial thromboses. In total 4.8% of limbs suffered a thrombotic event. Of 84 subjects in the aspirin treatment group, there were 3.6% of patients with DVT and three superficial thrombosis. In total 3.6% of limbs had a thrombotic event. In the LMWH group (82 subjects), there were no cases of DVT. One superficial thrombosis was documented. In total only 0.6% of limbs had a thrombotic event (p<0.002 in comparison with the other two groups). DVT was asymptomatic in 60% of subjects; 85% of DVTs were observed in passengers in non-aisle seats. Mild gastrointestinal symptoms were reported in 13% of patients taking aspirin. One dose of LMWH is an important option to consider in high-risk subjects during long-haul flights."
CD008201,0,11401186,0,Implementation and evaluation of guidelines for use of enoxaparin as deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis after major trauma.,"Although enoxaparin is more efficacious than many other deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention strategies after trauma, its routine use in trauma patients at low risk for venous thrombosis is unlikely to be cost-effective and may be deleterious if risk factors for bleeding are present. By way of consensus of opinion of trauma surgeons and pharmacists, enoxaparin DVT prophylaxis guidelines were developed, implemented, and evaluated. Fifty patients with major orthopedic or spinal trauma were followed throughout hospitalization. Enoxaparin use and frequency of DVT, pulmonary embolism (PE), thrombocytopenia, and enoxaparin-related major bleeding (overt bleeding associated with a hemoglobin decrease > or = 2 g/dl, need for > or = 2 units of packed red blood cells, or need for surgery) were recorded. All pharmacist interventions pertaining to enoxaparin prophylaxis were collected. Average patient age was 45.6+/-19.5 years, average Injury Severity Score was 19.0+/-11.2, and average length of hospitalization was 14.3+/-10.0 days. Most injuries were related to motor vehicles (52%) and falls (30%). Sites of injury were femur or tibia (52%), pelvis or acetabulum (32%), hip (20%), and spinal cord (12%). Two-thirds (72%) of patients received enoxaparin during part of their hospital stay (on average, for 53% of the duration of hospitalization). Sequential compression devices and vena caval filters were used in 86% and 10% of patients, respectively. Duplex-proven DVT occurred in two patients, and angiography-proven PE developed in one patient. Enoxaparin-related major bleeding and thrombocytopenia occurred in three and one patient(s), respectively. Pharmacists recommended enoxaparin initiation in nine (18%) patients and discontinuation of the agent in seven (14%) patients (one for bleeding; six for lack of indication). Most recommendations (78%) were accepted. Data from the 50 patients in this study showed fewer thrombotic complications but more bleeding than the frequencies found in controlled studies. It is unclear whether the large number of days that patients did not receive enoxaparin was due to fears of enoxaparin-related bleeding or other factors."
CD008201,0,21162609,0,New frontiers with bemiparin: use in special populations.,"Special populations are rarely included in conventional clinical trials and subsequently there is a lack of guidance on the appropriate treatment regimens to use. This paper reviews data on the use of bemiparin in such populations, including the elderly, those with renal impairment, pregnant women and children. Pharmacokinetic data from elderly patients suggest that bemiparin is also safe in this patient population. There was no evidence of the accumulation of bemiparin after repeated prophylactic doses. At therapeutic doses, there was no significant difference in pharmacokinetic profile between groups. There is no need for dose adjustment of bemiparin in the elderly, either during prophylaxis or during treatment. Data from another pharmacokinetic study showed that bemiparin at prophylactic doses is safe in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. In general, no dose adjustment was required in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment when bemiparin is used as therapy or prophylaxis. To date, bemiparin has not been tested in patients with severe renal impairment; therefore, conclusions on the safety of bemiparin in patients with severe renal failure cannot be drawn at present. Although there are no published data on the use of bemiparin in pregnant women, promising anecdotal data are beginning to emerge. Current guidelines recommend low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) for the treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in pregnant women, with treatment maintained at therapeutic doses throughout pregnancy. Anticoagulation should continue for 6 weeks or more post-partum and should be maintained for 3 months or more after diagnosis of the VTE event. Monitoring of pregnant women receiving LMWH is not necessary, except in those at high risk. A case report describing the treatment of a neonate with renal vein thrombosis showed that 2 months' treatment with bemiparin followed by 10 months' prophylaxis was effective and safe. These data suggest that bemiparin may play a role in the treatment of VTE in paediatric patients."
CD008201,0,26079202,0,Tranexamic acid for preventing postpartum haemorrhage.,"Postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) is a common and potentially life-threatening complication of labour. Several options for preventing PPH are available, but further advances in this field are important, especially the identification of safe, easy to use and cost-effective regimens.

CD008201,0,18973729,0,Doppler ultrasonography screening of poor-grade subarachnoid hemorrhage patients increases the diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis.,"Prophylactic anticoagulation greatly decreases the prevalence of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in neurosurgical patients. Using Doppler ultrasonography (USG), recent studies demonstrate a 1% DVT detection rate following microsurgery or endovascular treatment for aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). We hypothesize that reported statistics underestimate the DVT detection rate in this high risk cohort by accounting for only symptomatic thromboses. This study utilizes Doppler USG to examine the prevalence of DVT in a large population of aSAH patients and attempts to identify a high-risk subgroup within this cohort."
CD008201,0,26801659,0,Effectiveness of tranexamic acid in reducing blood loss during cytoreductive surgery for advanced ovarian cancer.,"Ovarian cancer is the third most common gynaecological cancer worldwide, with an age-standardised incidence rate of 6.1 per 10,000 women. Standard therapy for advanced epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) includes a combination of cytoreductive surgery and platinum-based chemotherapy. Cytoreductive surgery aims to remove as much of the visible tumour as possible. As extensive intraperitoneal metastases are typical of advanced EOC, cytoreductive surgery is usually an extensive procedure with the risk of excessive bleeding. Tranexamic acid given perioperatively is effective in reducing blood loss and allogeneic blood transfusion requirements in a variety of surgical settings. Therefore, tranexamic acid seems to be a promising agent for minimising blood loss and the need for blood transfusion among women with advanced EOC undergoing cytoreductive surgery."
CD008201,0,26546690,0,Trousseau's syndrome: cancer-associated thrombosis.,"Trousseau's syndrome (cancer-associated thrombosis) is the second leading cause of death in cancer patients, after death from cancer itself. The risk of a venous thromboembolism is 4- to 7-fold higher in patients with cancer than in those without cancer. The causes of this impaired coagulation are associated with general patient-related risk factors, and other factors that are specific to the particular cancer or treatment. It is important to assess the risk of thrombotic events in cancer patients and administer effective prophylaxis and treatment. Effective prophylaxis and treatment of venous thromboembolism reduces morbidity and mortality, and improves patients' quality of life. Low molecular weight heparin is the first-line treatment for venous thromboembolism, as an effective and safe means for prophylaxis and treatment, according to guidelines released by international scientific societies. Oral anticoagulation therapy with warfarin is preferable to no therapy. However, warfarin has low efficacy and is associated with high rates of recurrence. If low molecular weight heparin is unavailable, some guidelines recommend the use of vitamin K antagonists that have a target international normalized ratio in the range of 2-3, as acceptable alternatives. Novel oral anticoagulants that directly inhibit factor Xa or thrombin are promising for the prophylaxis of high-risk cancer patients and in the long-term treatment of venous thromboembolism. However, to date, there is insufficient evidence to support the use of these new anticoagulants."

Recent data suggest that AF patients after successful ablation have the same risk for thromboembolic events (TE) as patients without AF. Despite current guideline recommendations it is still under debate if oral anticoagulation (OAC) can be safely discontinued after ablation. We analyzed follow-up (FU) after ablation of paroxysmal AF (PAF) in a high- (previous stroke; group 1) and a low-risk group (no previous stroke; group 2) based on data from the German Ablation Registry to reveal real-life prescription behavior.

CD008201,0,11561283,0,Duplex follow-up of patients with DVT: does it have clinical significance?,"Venous duplex ultrasonography is now the diagnostic test of choice for the diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) at many institutions. In the research setting, the ability to serially evaluate thrombi localized to specific venous segments has shown the importance of recurrent thrombotic events and recanalization in the natural history of acute DVT. In addition, its availability and noninvasive nature have led increasingly to the use of serial venous ultrasound examinations in the clinical management of acute DVT. Unfortunately, there is little evidence to support the use of follow-up ultrasonography for many of these purposes. Based on the limited evidence available, follow-up ultrasound examinations appear to be warranted only in patients with isolated calf vein thrombosis and contraindications to conventional anticoagulation, patients with recurrent symptoms, and to establish a baseline after completion of therapy in patients at risk for recurrence. In contrast, the anticoagulant management of acute DVT should be guided by the results of clinical trials, and currently available evidence provides no basis for using ultrasonography to guide the duration of anticoagulation. Therefore, if therapy is based on guidelines derived from clinical trials, there are few indications for the noninvasive follow-up of DVT during anticoagulant treatment in the absence of new symptoms."
CD008201,0,16758649,0,Venous thromboembolism in medically ill patients: identifying risk and strategies for prevention.,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a condition that has multiple causes but few warning signs. Consequently, the 2 manifestations of VTE-pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis-often go unpredicted. This is especially true for medical patients. Treatment guidelines indicate that most hospitalized patients should receive prophylaxis for VTE. This report discusses these guidelines, the high prevalence of VTE among medical patients, and clinical studies of thromboprophylaxis in medically ill patients. VTE prophylaxis continues to be underutilized in medically ill patients. These patients are at significant risk of VTE and require prophylaxis, an objective that is supported by the recent guidelines of the American College of Chest Physicians. In addition, several lines of clinical evidence support the use of prophylaxis in this subgroup of patients. Improved systems are needed in medically ill patients to help improve outcomes and compliance for the use of VTE prophylaxis."

The mean age was 66.5 yrs with similar numbers of male and female patients and 265 (22.6%) patients were active smokers. The first and second audits identified 549 (84%) and 487 (93%) of patients at-risk for VTE respectively. Of the at-risk patients, 163 (29.7%) and 132 (27.1%) received LMWH in the first and second audit respectively. Mechanical thromboprophylaxis was instigated in 75 (13.6%) patients in the first and 86 (17.7%) patients in the second audit. The placement of stickers in patient charts didn't produce a significant increase in the number of at risk patients treated in the second audit.

CD008201,0,26135797,0,Purple Glove Syndrome after Phenytoin or Fosphenytoin Administration: Review of Reported Cases and Recommendations for Prevention.,"The aim of our study was to identify all previously reported cases of phenytoin- or fosphenytoin-associated purple glove syndrome (PGS) and summarize the most current understanding of the pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of the disease. We searched the English language references from MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, TOXNET, and gray literature that featured one or more case descriptions of phenytoin- or fosphenytoin-associated PGS after administration and provided information on the clinical setting of the event and associated outcome(s). Descriptive statistics were employed to summarize relevant facts about the cases. We identified 82 unique cases of parenteral phenytoin-associated PGS and 5 cases of fosphenytoin-associated PGS that were published from 1984 to 2015. Additionally, we found two cases of PGS associated with oral formulation of phenytoin published from 1999 to 2015. The spectrum of tissue injury ranged from mild local cutaneous reactions around the infusion site to frank limb ischemia. Just over a half of cases reported symptoms after one dose of IV phenytoin. Pathologic findings included evidence for microvascular thrombosis and possible microvascular or subclinical extravasation as a contributing mechanism. Dopper ultrasound and conventional angiography were used in some patients to identify arterial or venous thrombosis. Various treatments were documented including the use of supportive care such as limb elevation and heat or cold application, utilization of systemic antibiotics, anticoagulants, or vasodilators, and local infiltration of hyaluronidase, heparin, or other compounds. In a small number of patients, invasive interventions such as regional anesthesia, thrombectomy, fasciotomy, and debridement were described. Time to resolution varied from days to weeks. Resolution of PGS without deficits was documented in the majority of cases. Skin changes followed by sensory and motor deficits were described in 16, 6, and 5 cases, respectively. Four patients underwent skin grafting and eight patients required limb amputation. Death as a result of PGS was documented in two patients. PGS associated with oral and injectable phenytoin or parenteral fosphenytoin has been documented in the literature and sometimes includes significant vascular thrombosis and potentially limb-threatening ischemia. Avoidance of small hand veins, adherence to recommended IV administration guidelines and monitoring of the infusion site for reactions should be considered to decrease the morbidity of IV phenytoin or fosphenytoin use. Patients with PGS and evidence of decreased distal perfusion should undergo prompt vascular imaging and potential intervention to avoid ischemic sequelae. Alternative anticonvulsant drugs should be considered in patients at risk for PGS when possible."

Likewise, relying upon additional vigilance and efforts of those already caring for patients may guarantee that hospital-acquired complications persist, given the time pressures already constraining bedside clinicians. Consequently, we recommend a new type of clinical role in the hospital setting, the ""Patient Safety Professional"" (PSP), be considered to ensure that each patient receives individualized prevention strategies to minimize the hazards of hospitalization."
CD008201,0,20522721,0,Emergency department awareness of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia: how frequently is risk assessment documented in patients with thrombosis?,"Evidence-based guidelines recommend that heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) should be suspected whenever a patient develops thrombosis or thrombocytopenia 5 to 14 days after heparin initiation. The authors determined how frequently emergency department (ED) physicians document HIT risk assessment in patients presenting with thrombosis. Relevant data were extracted from the ED charts of 134 patients with venous or arterial thrombosis. Documentation (ie, notation of positive or negative findings) existed for recent heparin exposure in 7 (5.2%) of 134 charts, recent hospitalization in 33 (24.6%), history of thrombocytopenia in 0 (0%), and history of thrombosis in 62 (45.5%). Of 35 patients administered heparin in the ED, the preheparin platelet count was available for 19 (54.3%) and old records for 5 (14.3%). Thus, HIT risk assessment frequently remains undocumented for ED patients with thrombosis, including those administered heparin. Approaches to increase HIT awareness and facilitate HIT risk assessment and documentation in the ED may be needed."
CD008201,0,12818632,0,Medical indications and considerations for future clinical decision making.,"There are many well-known drawbacks associated with the currently used antithrombotic agents, warfarin, heparin, and low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs). Because heparins can be administered only parenterally, their application is limited. Though warfarin can be administered orally, its unpredictable anticoagulant effect means that it must be regularly monitored. Ximelagatran (Exanta, AstraZeneca) is a novel, oral direct thrombin inhibitor (oral DTI) that is rapidly converted to its active form, melagatran, upon administration. The antithrombotic effects of melagatran have been demonstrated. Following the oral administration of ximelagatran, melagatran has stable and reproducible pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties that enable ximelagatran to be administered orally, twice daily, according to a fixed-dose regimen, with no need for routine coagulation monitoring. In view of its favourable profile, a clinical trial programme has been designed to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of ximelagatran compared with standard therapies, for the prophylaxis and treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE), the prevention of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), and the prevention of cardiovascular events in patients with previous acute coronary syndromes. These studies show that oral ximelagatran is well tolerated at doses of up to 60 mg, twice daily (bid), and that it is as effective as standard therapy for the prevention of thromboembolic events in patients undergoing hip or knee replacement surgery, for the treatment of clinically verified acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and in patients with nonvalvular AF who have a moderate to high risk of stroke. The protocols and results of some of these studies--and a study that investigates the use of ximelagatran in combination with aspirin for the management of acute coronary artery disease--are described in this paper."
CD008201,0,25058249,0,Does traumatic brain injury increase the risk for venous thromboembolism in polytrauma patients?,"Trauma is a major risk factor for venous thromboembolism (VTE). Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is generally considered to further increase the VTE risk, which should prompt routine thromboprophylaxis. However, the associated risk for intracranial hemorrhage often delays anticoagulants. We test the hypothesis that TBI associated with polytrauma results in a higher rate of VTE than polytrauma without TBI."
CD008201,0,18328841,0,Aspirin desensitization in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary interventions with stent implantation.,"The aim of this study was to test the safety and efficacy of a novel rapid desensitization procedure in patients with acetylsalicylic acid sensitivity and coronary artery disease who underwent cardiac catheterization and coronary stent implantation. Aspirin plays a key role in the secondary prevention of atherothrombotic events and thrombotic complications after stent implantation. Aspirin sensitivity not only limits patients to benefit from the long-term use of this antiplatelet agent but is also often an impediment to the implantation of bare-metal and drug-eluting coronary stents. Of 1,014 patients admitted for cardiac catheterization, 26 (2.6%) had histories of aspirin sensitivity characterized by respiratory or cutaneous manifestations (none had previous anaphylactic reactions); of these, 61.5% presented with acute coronary syndromes. All patients underwent a novel rapid desensitization challenge procedure before cardiac catheterization, except for those presenting with ST-elevation myocardial infarctions (n = 4), who underwent desensitization before hospital discharge. The desensitization procedure involved the oral administration of 6 sequential doses of aspirin (1, 5, 10, 20, 40, and 100 mg) over 5.5 hours without the use of corticosteroids or antihistamines. Patients were followed for 1 year to assess compliance with aspirin therapy and adverse events. The desensitization procedure was successful in 23 patients (88.5%). Percutaneous coronary intervention with stent implantation was performed in 22 patients (1.8 stents/patient). Drug-eluting stents were used in all patients except those who underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention (n = 3), in whom bare-metal stents were used. Multivessel percutaneous coronary intervention was performed in 30.7% of patients. At follow-up, all patients who successfully responded to the desensitization procedure tolerated aspirin well, without developing allergic reactions. Aspirin was withdrawn in only 1 patient, because of a peptic ulcer. In conclusion, rapid desensitization is safe and highly effective in patients with aspirin sensitivity and coronary artery disease who undergo coronary stent implantation, including those who receive drug-eluting stents."
CD008201,0,19584716,1,"A prospective, controlled trial of a pharmacy-driven alert system to increase thromboprophylaxis rates in medical inpatients.","Although venous thromboembolism is an important cause of morbidity and mortality within the hospital, a significant proportion of at-risk inpatients do not receive measures known to reduce the risk of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. The objective of the present study was to determine whether a pharmacy-driven alert system would, compared to usual care, be associated with a higher rate of adequate venous thromboembolism prevention measures among at-risk inpatients on a general internal medicine service. The study was a prospective, controlled trial set at a university-based teaching hospital. The participants were adults who were admitted (Monday through Friday) to the general internal medicine inpatient service from 19 June to 21 September 2006. Their treatment included a pharmacist assessment of venous thromboembolism risk and a pharmacist-driven alert to the treating physician. The Proportion of at-risk patients receiving adequate thromboprophylaxis within 36 h of admission was recorded. Overall, 140 patients were at sufficient risk for venous thromboembolism to be included. In the usual care group, prophylactic measures were ordered for 49 (61%) of the 80 patients at moderate to high risk. In the pharmacist-alert group, 44 (73%) of the 60 moderate to high venous thromboembolism-risk patients received adequate thromboprophylaxis (P = 0.15). Although we did not observe a statistically significant difference between the groups, our results are consistent with previous reports suggesting that alert systems can increase the proportion of hospitalized patients who receive adequate measures to prevent venous thromboembolism."

Parenteral thromboprophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin is likely to reduce the risk of venous thromboembolism in this population and is recommended for the duration of the patient's hospitalization.

CD008201,0,22532158,0,Plasma exchange and immunoadsorption effectively remove antiphospholipid antibodies in pregnant patients with antiphospholipid syndrome.,"Conventional therapy with aspirin and/or heparin is at times incapable of preventing complications in high risk pregnancies of patients with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). In those cases, a so-called second-line treatment protocol is used in addition to conventional therapy strategies. This manuscript is a report on three APS pregnant patients who were successfully treated with plasma exchange (PE) (two cases) or with immunoadsorption (IA) (one case) as a second-line treatment strategy. The efficacy of these procedures in removing anticardiolipin (aCL) and anti-β(2)glycoprotein I (aβ(2)GPI) antibodies from blood was evaluated. Serum samples were collected before and after 87 apheretic treatment sessions. Serum IgG/M aCL and IgG/M aβ(2)GPI antibodies were determined using an ""in-house"" enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and showed that all three patients had medium/high IgG aCL and aβ(2)GPI titers. All three women had a successful pregnancy. A significant decrease in IgG aCL (P = 0.0001) and aβ(2)GPI (P = 0.0001) antibody titers was observed after PE and IA sessions. There was moreover a significant, steady fall in serum IgG aCL pretreatment levels during the course of all three pregnancies (P = 0.0001, P = 0.0001, P = 0.001). The fall in IgG aβ(2)GPI was significant in two of the patients (P = 0.0001, P = 0.0001) both with high antibody titers, but not in one with medium antibody titers, who was treated with PE (P = 0.17)."

At present, there are few epidemiologic reports regarding VTE in Japan. Japanese VTE prophylaxis guidelines recommend a risk-based approach based on previous epidemiologic statistics. VTE includes deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). PE prevention is the main goal, although the relation between PE and DVT is still controversial."
CD008201,0,19087850,0,[Anaesthesia and thromboembolic disease].,"Currently, pharmacological thromboprophylaxis is frequently required in patients undergoing surgery, due to the high risk of deep venous thrombosis in the perioperative period. The administration of these anticoagulant agents (in Spain, usually low molecular weight heparins or fondaparinux, and in future, probably also the new oral anticoagulants dabigatran and rivaroxaban) may conflict with regional anesthetic techniques, in which maintaining hemostatic integrity is essential. Therefore, safety protocols have been designed that allow thromboprophylaxis to be administered with optimal effectiveness and anesthetic techniques to be performed with maximal safety; these protocols are based on the drug used, as well as on the dose and time of administration. The present chapter reviews the details related to these issues."

CD008201,0,26422329,0,Rate and duration of hospitalization for deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in real-world clinical practice.,"Current guidelines recommend initial treatment with anticoagulants at home in patients with acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and in patients with low-risk pulmonary embolism (PE) with adequate home circumstances.

CD008201,0,25640701,0,Incidence of symptomatic venous thromboembolism in oncological oral and maxillofacial operations: retrospective analysis.,"We retrospectively analysed the incidence of symptomatic venous thromboembolism (VTE) and associated risk factors in operations under general anaesthesia for cancer of the oral cavity. To identify symptoms related to deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), together with associated risk factors, we reviewed medical records of patients operated on in the department of oral and maxillofacial surgery at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham, United Kingdom, between June 2007 and October 2012. All patients were categorised according to their level of risk of VTE. The incidence of VTE was calculated with univariate associations and odds ratios with related 95% confidence intervals, where possible. In total, 233 patients were included, comprising 244 operations (mean (SD) age at operation 60.9 (13) years). Almost all patients (97%) were classified as having the highest risk of VTE. Swelling of an extremity, expectoration of blood, and tightness of the chest were the most common symptoms for suspected cases. An incidence of 0.41% was found for symptomatic VTE; one man developed a PE 2 days after operation. Associations between the analysed factors and symptomatic VTE were not significant. The development of the complication in oncological oral and maxillofacial operations seems to be rare, even in patients with a high risk. We cannot recommend the use of routine thromboprophylaxis, but it could be advocated in patients with obvious serious risk factors."
CD008201,0,11030468,0,Proficient and cost-effective approaches for the prevention and treatment of venous thrombosis and thromboembolism.,"Thrombosis is clearly a common cause of death in the US. It is obviously of major importance to define the aetiology of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) as (i) many of these events are preventable if appropriate therapy, dependent upon the risk factors known is utilised; (ii) appropriate antithrombotic therapy will decrease risks of recurrence; (iii) the type of defect(s) and risk(s) will determine length of time the patient should remain on therapy for secondary prevention and (iv) if the defect is hereditary appropriate family members can be assessed. Aside from mortality, significant additional morbidity occurs from DVT including, but not limited to, stasis ulcers and other sequelae of post-phlebitic syndrome. Numerous studies have provided evidence that medical patients and patients undergoing surgery or trauma are at significant risk for developing DVT, including pulmonary embolism (PE). Thus, an important task for the clinician is to prevent DVT and its complications. It is important to define risk groups where prophylaxis must be considered. The attitudes and beliefs towards prophylaxis show great regional variations. This is true for the definition of risk groups, the proportion of patients receiving prophylaxis and prophylactic modalities used. For this reason, various 'consensus conference' groups have attempted to alleviate these problems; the primary mission of consensus guidelines is to provide optimal direction to the clinician in the setting of clinical practice. If the practice guidelines generated are successful they will assist clinicians in decision-making for their patients, and they will also provide protection against unjustified malpractice actions. Therapy may be complex, as clinical studies continue to identify more effective treatments. This review includes currently accepted approaches to the treatment of DVT. The clinical course of DVT is highly dynamic. When the response to therapy is not as expected, more than one cause of DVT may be present in a patient. Treatment must address the primary coagulopathy as well as any precipitating factors. The risk of pharmacological intervention must be balanced against potential benefit. If the incidence of DVT in a given disorder is low and if the mortality rate is similarly low, therapy with an agent known to be associated with a high risk for complications, such as warfarin, would not be indicated. If DVT is seen primarily after surgery or in other high-risk situations, therapy might be limited to a fixed time period. However, if the ongoing risk of DVT remains high or if a history of recurrent DVT dictates, lifelong therapy might be indicated. The recommendations presented are based upon published controlled trials; however, indications for therapy and therapeutic agents of choice will continually evolve. By applying the principles outlined in this review, substantial cost savings, reduction in morbidity and reductions in mortality should occur."
CD008201,0,9731815,0,A protocol for the initial management of unstable pelvic fractures.,"The initial management of life-threatening hemorrhage associated with severe pelvic fractures has long been a source of debate. A review of the literature reveals that many advocate emergent orthopedic external fixation (EX-FIX) for severe pelvic fractures, whereas others claim greater success with angiographic embolization (ANGIO) as the first line of treatment. Although many have attempted to classify management options by fracture pattern, to date there has been no prospective trial comparing outcomes for each method of treatment. We offer a prospective study of all pelvic fracture patients admitted to our Level I trauma center between July 1994 and July 1995. Patients were classified according to fracture pattern and degree of hemodynamic instability. Those with primarily anterior pelvic ring fractures underwent emergent EX-FIX for control of hemorrhage, whereas those with primarily posterior pelvic ring fractures underwent emergent ANGIO to control hemorrhage. We found that blood product requirements and hospital stay were similar in each group. However, the complication rate was higher in patients who underwent initial emergency EX-FIX, primarily because of failure to adequately control hemorrhage. We conclude that patients with anterior-posterior compression type 2 and 3, lateral compression type 2 and 3, or vertical shear injuries, who are hemodynamically unstable as a result of their pelvic fracture, should undergo immediate ANGIO if laparotomy is not indicated. If laparotomy is indicated, EX-FIX should be placed intraoperatively, followed by postoperative ANGIO."
CD008201,0,21044023,0,The timing of drug administration for thromboprophylaxis following orthopaedic surgery: evidence and controversies related to treatment initiation and duration.,"Patients undergoing major orthopaedic surgery of the lower extremities or spine are at increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Although consensus exists as to the need for routine thromboprophylaxis in high risk patients, some aspects of this approach, such as the timing of the first dose and overall duration of the anticoagulation regimen, are subject to debate. Reviewing the available literature, there appears to be little evidence to support initiation of thromboprophylaxis more than 12 hours before surgery. Perioperative thromboprophylaxis (2 hours pre to 6 hours post -op) has been associated with an increased risk of bleeding complications whilst initiating prophylaxis more than 12 hours after surgery appears to increase the incidence of subsequent thromboembolic complications. Overall evidence would appear to support initiation of thromboprophylaxis 6 to 9 hours postoperatively, though further confirmatory studies investigating this variable in isolation would be useful to guide clinical decision making. Although evidence exists supporting extended duration thromboprophylaxis after major orthopaedic procedures, further evidence is required, using clinically important end points, prior to adoption of such an approach in all patients. Stratification of prophylaxis duration, based on risk factors for thromboembolic or bleeding complications, would seem a more rational approach than strict adherence to guidelines."

The impact of these studies on patient usage of alternative antithrombotic agents has hitherto not been evaluated. We examined the usage of these agents in the United States over the last decade, with regard to the publication of the Management of Atherothrombosis with Clopidogrel in High-Risk Patients (MATCH), European/Australasian Stroke Prevention in Reversible Ischaemia Trial (ESPRIT), and Prevention Regimen for Effectively Avoiding Second Strokes (PRoFESS) clinical trials, in order to test the hypothesis that resulting recommendations are reflected in usage trends."
CD008201,0,18976192,0,Rational thromboprophylaxis in medical inpatients: not quite there yet.,"Routine thromboprophylaxis in hospitalised medical patients is based on trials that predominantly use asymptomatic deep vein thrombosis (DVT) as the endpoint. As asymptomatic DVT is 10-30-fold more common than symptomatic DVT, this exaggerates estimates of benefit and cost-effectiveness. Based on symptomatic disease, the number needed to treat per venous thromboembolism (VTE) prevented is high (150-1600), and the true cost-effectiveness of thromboprophylaxis for symptomatic event reduction is uncertain. The incidence of major bleeding among patients receiving prophylaxis is at least equal to the reduction in clinical VTE. Routine thromboprophylaxis in hospitalised medical patients is not warranted, and better patient selection is needed."
CD008201,0,25387822,0,Safety of dabigatran in an elderly population: single center experience in Italy.,"In clinical practice, adherence to drugs and their safety may differ from randomised controlled trial settings. This study was undertaken to investigate the adherence to dabigatran, a direct thrombin inhibitor, and its safety in a real-world setting. We studied a prospective cohort of 114 elderly consecutive patients with non valvular atrial fibrillation (AF) who were treated with dabigatran 150 mg twice-daily (N=39) or 110 mg twice-daily (N=76). These patients were studied at baseline and after an average of 6 months. Mean age was 80 years and 53% were women. At entry, the average CHA2DS2VASc score was 4 and the HAS-BLED score was 2. AF was permanent in 49% of patients, persistent in 30%, paroxysmal in 12% and new-onset in 24%. In the follow-up clinical visit we ascertained vital status, adherence to treatment according to refill prescription orders, and side effects. Adherence was ≥80% in 76.5% of patients. Heartburn, the most frequent adverse effect, was reported by 25 patients (22%). Major and minor bleedings were experienced by 2 (1.8%) and 9 (7.9%) patients, respectively. Permanent discontinuation occurred in 18 patients (16%). The most frequent cause of permanent discontinuation was heartburn (10 patients). This real-life study suggests that safety of dabigatran and adherence to this drug in an elderly cohort of AF patients at high or very high risk of thromboembolism are generally good. Heartburn is the main cause of treatment discontinuation."
CD008201,0,26500456,0,Should lifelong anticoagulation for unprovoked venous thromboembolism be revisited?,"Venous thromboembolism [VTE] is a common medical condition that has significant morbidity and mortality. Although stringent guidelines recommend lifelong anticoagulation for patients with unprovoked VTE, the optimal management strategy for their long term treatment remains controversial. Whereas in cancer-associated VTE and second unprovoked VTE lifelong anticoagulation is universally accepted, a careful analysis of the benefit vs. risk of long-term anticoagulation following a first unprovoked VTE should be considered as case fatality rates [CFR] from VTE appear more pronounced in the first few months. The CFR from major bleeding remains constant throughout therapy. Therefore, the risk of bleeding may be underestimated over longer treatment periods relative to the morbidity of recurrent VTE which appears to peak in the first year. The current review highlights the balance between the recurrence risk and bleeding risks in the era of direct oral anticoagulants. Vitamin K antagonists have been the standard of care for over 50 years bearing significant bleeding risks. The new oral anticoagulants [NOACs] have shown similar efficacy and perhaps a questionable improved safety profile when compared to warfarin. Aspirin has historically not been a useful agent in the management of VTE. However, two recent trials [WARFASA and ASPIRE] showed a likely 20-30 % risk reduction when compared to placebo for recurrent VTE after initial anticoagulation. The risk of major hemorrhage was low in both trials. With the emergence of NOACs and the increased utility of aspirin, there are multiple therapeutic options for long term management for VTE. Given comparable efficacy and improved safety of NOACs and aspirin, the risk benefit of anticoagulation is improving. A risk stratification model may help identifying patients at high risk for recurrence necessitating a lifelong anticoagulation. This cohort should be separated from a low risk group that may benefit from clinical observation, aspirin or NOACs. Prospective clinical trials are needed to support these clinical observations."
CD008201,0,26776579,0,Cardiogenic embolism in the cat.,"Cardiogenic embolism (CE) in the cat, which has also been referred to as arterial thromboembolism, feline arterial thromboembolism, and saddle thrombus has been identified clinically in cats for decades and is an important clinical development and cause of death in cats with underlying heart disease. While a better understanding of this condition has been developed over the decades it is extremely frustrating to clinicians that there have not been dramatic changes in prevention or outcome. Only recently has the first prospective thromboprophylactic study on CE in cats been completed. While new antithrombotic drugs are developed for humans on a regular basis, it has been challenging to get pharmaceutical companies to focus on the feline species. Additionally, there remains an absence of clinical data to identify cats at risk for developing CE aside from the simple fact that they have underlying heart disease. This review will attempt to present a summary of where we stand in 2015 with regards to clinical presentation, survival, thrombotic risk, and prevention."

CD008201,0,23075345,0,Prevention of thrombosis in pregnancy: how practical are consensus derived clinical practice guidelines?,"Thromboembolic disease (TED) has, for many years, consistently been identified as one of the leading causes of direct maternal mortality. In November 2009, the RCOG published a guideline on the prevention of TED that has been rapidly adopted by hospital trusts in the UK. The aim of our study was to determine the number and profile of women in our population that would require treatment with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) and the cost implications of such treatment if these guidelines were implemented. A retrospective review of the first 100 women who delivered at the Coombe Women & Infants University Hospital (CWIUH) in 2010 was conducted and risk stratification applied at the relevant time points. A total of 51% were deemed to be at intermediate or high risk of TED at some point during pregnancy. In 35 of the 51 women (70%), this risk was attributable to factors such as age>35 years, parity≥3, BMI>30 kg/m2 or cigarette smoking. In our obstetric population, the percentage of women with these risk factors was: 25.5%, 8.5%, 19% and 16.7%, respectively. Implementation of this guideline would increase the hospital annual expenditure on LMWH by a factor of 17. The strategy of attributing risk by accumulating factors that individually have a low risk of TED and are prevalent in the population needs to be re-visited. The cost of implementation of these guidelines is not inconsiderable in the absence of data to indicate that clinical outcome is improved with their implementation."

CD008201,0,22476043,0,A survey of current practice of venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in hospitalized inflammatory bowel disease patients in the United States.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients are at an increased risk of thrombosis, particularly when hospitalized. Several clinical practice guidelines now recommend pharmacologic prophylaxis for hospitalized ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease patients. It is unclear to what extent gastroenterologists are aware of these recommendations and whether they are administering pharmacologic venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis appropriately. Our aim was to explore current practice of VTE prophylaxis in hospitalized IBD patients in the United States."
CD008201,0,10364775,0,Outpatient management of venous thromboembolism.,"Low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs) have provided the necessary pharmacologic tool to facilitate the outpatient management of selected patients presenting with acute venous thromboembolism. A growing collection of clinical trial results supports the safety and efficacy of this cost-efficient management strategy. However, this approach requires careful patient selection and meticulous care planning. Several randomized multicenter trials have compared a primarily outpatient approach to treating uncomplicated proximal venous thrombosis with a LMWH administered subcutaneously once or twice daily to the inpatient use of unfractionated heparin (UFH). The results have been very encouraging and suggest that the use of subcutaneous LMWH in highly selected, uncomplicated venous thrombosis patients is as safe and effective as intravenous UFH, and that most patients can be treated as outpatient or be discharged early. Irrespective of parenteral anticoagulant approach, warfarin therapy was commenced on day 1 and continued for 3 months. A recent publication by Dedden and colleagues describes a 1-year experience with a pharmacy-managed program for the home treatment of patients presenting with proximal deep vein thrombosis. A plan for coordinated patient care was implemented which included a process for patient referrals, standardized protocol orders, a plan for holding area processing and home healthcare agency follow-up, and subsequent oral anticoagulation management. Results of the program demonstrate a significant healthcare savings (as compared with standard inpatient management) with no significant compromise in patient outcomes. Recently published trials by the Columbus Investigators and Simonneau and colleagues have looked beyond uncomplicated proximal venous thromboembolism to include patients presenting with recurrent venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Results suggest the subcutaneous use of LMWH is as safe and effective as intravenous UFH. Such data begin to lay the scientific foundation for the expanded clinical base of patients who may be candidates for an outpatient management approach. In today's cost-conscience environment, managing the treatment of select venous thromboembolism patients with LMWH(s) and warfarin therapy in an outpatient environment represents an evolving approach that is economically logical, does not compromise patient outcomes, but requires considerable planning to address a myriad of logistical issues."
CD008201,0,20825270,0,Clinical burden of venous thromboembolism.,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE), which includes deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism (PE), is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. VTE is a common disorder, with an estimated annual incidence of approximately 5-12 persons per 10,000.

CD008201,0,20360976,0,Cancer-associated thrombosis.,"Thrombosis is a common complication in patients with cancer and it is estimated that about 20% of patients with cancer experience venous thromboembolism (VTE). This complication is associated with high rate of morbidity and mortality and is sometimes the first manifestation of an occult cancer. The risk profiles and markers involved in cancerassociated thrombosis share similarities with inflammation-induced atherosclerosis and thrombosis. The type of cancer, chemotherapy, surgery, central venous catheters, pre-chemotherapy platelet and leukocyte count are associated with high risk of VTE in cancer patients. Landmark studies demonstrated that effective prophylaxis and treatment of VTE reduced morbidity and increased survival. Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is preferred as an effective and safe means for prophylaxis and treatment of VTE. It has largely replaced unfractionated heparin and vitamin K antagonists. The advantages of LMWH include increased survival and quality of life, decreased rate of VTE, low incidence of thrombocytopenia. New guidelines for prophylaxis and treatment are now available and prophylaxis is recommended in hospitalized cancer patients and patients undergoing major surgery. Treatment with LMWH should be considered as the first line of therapy for established VTE and to prevent recurrent thrombosis in patients with cancer."

CD008201,0,23846575,0,Testing for inherited thrombophilia and consequences for antithrombotic prophylaxis in patients with venous thromboembolism and their relatives. A review of the Guidelines from Scientific Societies and Working Groups.,"The clinical penetrance of venous thromboembolism (VTE) susceptibility genes is variable, being lower in heterozygous carriers of factor V Leiden and prothrombin 20210A (mild thrombophilia), and higher in the rare carriers of deficiencies of antithrombin, protein C or S, and those with multiple or homozygous abnormalities (high-risk thrombophilia). The absolute risk of VTE is low, and the utility of laboratory investigation for inherited thrombophilia in patients with VTE and their asymptomatic relatives has been largely debated, leading to the production of several Guidelines from Scientific Societies and Working Groups. The risk for VTE largely depends on the family history of VTE. Therefore, indiscriminate search for carriers is of no utility, and targeted screening is potentially more fruitful. In patients with VTE inherited thrombophilia is not scored as a determinant of recurrence, playing a minor role in the decision of prolonging anticoagulation; indeed, a few guidelines consider testing worthwhile to identify carriers of high-risk thrombophilia, particularly those with a family history of VTE. The identification of the asymptomatic carrier relatives of the probands with VTE and thrombophilia could reduce cases of provoked VTE, offering them primary antithrombotic prophylaxis during risk situations. In most guidelines, this is considered justified only for relatives of probands with a deficiency of natural anticoagulants or multiple abnormalities. Counselling the asymptomatic female relatives of individuals with VTE and/or thrombophilia before pregnancy or the prescription of hormonal treatments should be administered with consideration of the risk driven by the type of thrombophilia and the family history of VTE."
CD008201,0,10548070,0,Acquired defects of fibrinolysis associated with thrombosis.,"Physiologic regulation of fibrinolysis plays an important role in the control of hypercoagulable states and thrombogenesis. Both the hereditary and acquired conditions leading to fibrinolytic deficit result in thrombotic complications leading to arterial and venous occlusive disorders. Several changes in physiologic states such as pregnancy, old age, stress, obesity, and temperature alterations lead to the modulation of the fibrinolytic system. Various disease states, surgery, radiation, and diet can also trigger mechanisms leading to impaired fibrinolytic states. Several drugs, including anticancer agents, oral contraceptives, cytokines, and blood components can also produce transitory fibrinolytic deficit which can predispose patients to thrombotic complications. The identification of the patient populations with an impaired fibrinolytic state is an important step toward the prevention of thrombotic complications which may lead to such catastrophic events as myocardial infarction and thrombotic strokes. Both functional and immunologic methods have currently become available for the rapid diagnosis of fibrinolytic deficit. Thus, it is important to evaluate patients who are at risk of thrombotic complications due to fibrinolytic deficit. Currently, specific guidelines are developed to identify high risk groups and propose methods to manage these groups of patients."

CD008201,0,21833449,0,Venous thromboembolism in Asia--an unrecognised and under-treated problem?,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) has been perceived for a long time to be less common in Asian populations, particularly in the Far East, than in Western populations. Generally, thromboprophylaxis is not implemented as frequently as it should be in high-risk patients. However, recent prospective studies undertaken in Asian countries have demonstrated higher rates of VTE after major surgery and in medical wards, approaching those observed in Western populations. Risk factors for VTE are not different in Asian patients from those of Western patients with the exception of thrombophilic mutations. Deficiencies of the natural anticoagulants (protein S, protein C, and antithrombin) are the predominant thrombophilias in Asia whereas factor V Leiden and prothrombin G20210A gene mutation are not found or rarely reported.

CD008201,0,19998249,0,Carotid artery stenting: a systematic review of randomized clinical trials.,"Carotid occlusive disease is responsible for a significant proportion of major adverse cardiovascular events (death, stroke, myocardial infarction). Effective prevention by means of revascularization is a sufficient treatment, if performed at a center with an acceptably low procedural complication rate. Carotid surgery is the currently accepted standard of treatment for revascularization of extra cranial carotid occlusive disease. This has been validated by randomized clinical trials that have demonstrated its efficacy over best medical therapy. However, less invasive protected carotid artery stenting (CAS) has emerged as a potential therapeutic alternative to carotid endarterectomy (CEA) for the treatment of carotid atherosclerotic disease. Over the past decade several clinical trials have compared endovascular with surgical treatment. The Stenting and Angioplasty with Protection in Patients at High Risk for Endarterectomy (SAPPHIRE) trial favored stenting over surgery in high-risk patients. The effectiveness of endovascular treatment in low-risk patients and patients with asymptomatic stenoses at preventing of stroke is still uncertain. Carotid artery stenting with an embolic protection device cannot be considered a scientifically sound and evidence-based alternative to carotid surgery in low-risk and asymptomatic patients until we have the results of further randomized trials.

Thirty-seven patients were screened by ultrasonography for deep vein thrombosis in the lower extremities at an average of 12 days postoperatively. All patients received standard thromboprophylaxis using graded compression stocking with/without intermittent pneumatic compression following the VTE prevention guidelines. Definitive diagnosis of venous thromboembolism was made by contrast-enhanced whole-body computed tomography. Prevalence of deep vein thrombosis of the lower legs was 13.5% (5/37). Incidence of pulmonary embolism was 60% (3/5) in patients having deep vein thrombosis. All patients having venous thromboembolism were asymptomatic.

CD008201,0,2750673,0,Antithrombotic therapy in the primary prevention of acute myocardial infarction.,"The high factor VII coagulant (VIIc) activity in men at high risk of coronary heart disease suggests that restoring normal hemostatic activity with appropriate oral anticoagulants might constitute effective primary prevention. A pilot study was therefore undertaken of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of long-term, low-dose warfarin therapy. Middle-aged men at high risk (mean VIIc 120% of standard) but without clinical coronary heart disease or contraindications to anticoagulants were randomized to warfarin or placebo. The initial warfarin dose (2.5 mg/day) was increased at intervals to lower VIIc to 70% of standard and increase the prothrombin time international normalized ratio to 1.6. The control participants received the same dose sequence of placebo. The pilot study confirmed the feasibility of the design, the absence of any increased risk of serious bleeding, and the high compliance and low withdrawal rate from randomized treatment. Accordingly, a full-scale thrombosis prevention trial has been launched, which, in addition to low-dose warfarin, includes a low-dose aspirin regimen (75 mg/day) in a factorial design. The aim of this trial is to produce a 30% reduction in coronary heart disease in 6,000 high-risk men aged 45 to 69 years. The men will receive either separate or combined therapy and will be followed up for 5 years. Evidence so far indicates that the risk of bleeding in those receiving combined therapy will be no higher than that in those taking aspirin alone."
CD008201,0,15820933,0,Elevated levels of D-dimer and fragment 1+2 upon central venous catheter insertion and factor V Leiden predict subclavian vein thrombosis.,"Symptomatic subclavian vein thrombosis is a potential complication in approximately 5-10% patients with indwelling central venous catheters. Having reliable tests that would identify those patients with a high risk of catheter-related thrombosis would be clinically useful by helping to tailor thromboprophylaxis. In this case control study by Jansen et al. (see page 499), patients with a Hickman catheter who were undergoing allogeneic bone marrow transplantation for hematological malignancies were investigated. Baseline levels of D-dimer and fragment 1+2 were found to be significantly higher in patients who developed catheter-related thrombosis and the presence of factor V Leiden genotype was found only in patients with thrombosis. Although these abnormalities were associated with a 5- to 7-fold increased risk of catheter-related thrombosis, the positive predictive values for elevated D-dimer and fragment 1+2 levels were only 80% while the negative predictive values were about 40%. These results support the concept that laboratory evidence of activation of coagulation correlates with clinical thrombotic events, but they are insufficient for recommending routine testing of these markers in patients with central venous catheters. Further studies are required to confirm these findings and to see if similar results are observed in patients with other malignancies."

There are cost effective measures to decrease the incidence of thromboembolic disease. Pharmacological prophylaxis decreases the incidence of deep venous thrombosis by 65% and the incidence of pulmonary embolism by 35 to 55%. Despite this data and the presence of clinical guidelines, prophylaxis of thromboembolic disease is used only in 40% of medical patients and in 65% of surgical patients with recommended indications.

CD008201,0,26645449,0,[The Development of a Care Protocol for Postoperative Pressure Sore Prevention].,"Pressure sores are a common complication caused by long periods of bed rest following major surgery. These sores may increase patient postoperative pain, increase the risk of infections, lengthen the pe-riod of hospitalization, and increase the duration and costs of nursing care. Therefore, maintaining the skin integrity of surgical patients is an important responsibility for operating room nurses and an indicator of nursing care quality. While pressure-sore risk assessment tools and interoperative strategies are available and used in foreign countries, there has been little related research conducted in Taiwan. After examining the relevant literature and considering the current postoperative pressure sore situation in Taiwan, the author developed a postoperative pressure sore care protocol as a reference for clinical staff. Protocol procedures include major breakthrough developments in areas such as post-survey risk assessment for pressure ulcers, pressure ulcer prevention strategies that take surgery-related risk factors into consideration, extra care and protection measures for surgical supine patients, and post-pressure sores. The developed postoperative pressure sore protocol may be incorporated into surgical care procedures during the post-surgical care period in order to effectively prevent the occurrence of post-surgery pressure ulcers.

CD008201,0,2010710,0,[What to do with a free-floating venous thrombus].,"Among patients with deep vein thrombosis (DVT), the frequency of pulmonary embolism seems conditioned by the location of DVT and thrombus adherence. Consequently, patients with free-floating iliac thrombus are at high risk of life-threatening pulmonary embolism. As regards their definition, non adherent thrombus and free-floating thrombus are not synonymous. Non adherent thrombi are usual in recent DVT and have the same prognosis and treatment as common DVT. The term of free-floating thrombi should be reserved for the iliac location when a small area of the thrombus is attached to the iliac vessel wall but the rest of it does not adhere to the wall. At present, venography is the gold standard for diagnosis but duplex scanning and scanner or magnetic resonance imaging should also be evaluated for this purpose. The treatment comprises the usual anticoagulant therapy with heparin and a specific treatment for the free-floating thrombus. 1) Vena cava filter is a rapid safe solution that avoids severe pulmonary embolism, but in the case of thrombus detachment, vena cava obliteration might occur with the subsequent risk of severe bilateral venous stasis and insufficiency. The indications for such treatment might be elderly patients in a poor general condition. 2) Venous thrombectomy. Venous thrombectomy only removes the free part of the thrombus, thus preserving the contralateral iliac vein from further complications. A clip is positioned on the inferior vena cava. 3) Protected fibrinolysis. The latest catheters allow transient vena cava filter device placement. Thrombolytic therapy with rTPa might achieve thrombolysis and subsequently restore the venous circulation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

We sought to determine if the dose of warfarin could be lowered safely even further, eliminating the need for laboratory monitoring and lowering the complication rate. Two hundred forty-five Patients undergoing primary total joint arthroplasty (n = 245) were randomized prospectively to adjusted low-dose warfarin (international normalized ratio [INR], 1.4-1.8) or fixed minidose warfarin (2 mg daily, regardless of INR) before hospital discharge. Prophylaxis continued for 6 weeks, with twice-weekly laboratory monitoring. Patients were followed for bleeding, thromboembolic events, and minor reported complications of warfarin therapy. With the numbers available, the rates of thromboembolic and bleeding events were not significantly different using equivalence analysis. Of patients in the fixed group, 8% had INRs >3.1, necessitating a decrease in dosage to 1 mg. Although such a fixed-dose protocol may simplify outpatient prophylaxis, intermittent monitoring still would be required because a subset of patients achieve a moderate level of anticoagulation and would be at risk for bleeding complications."

CD008201,0,12163001,0,"The post-thrombotic syndrome: current knowledge, controversies, and directions for future research.","The post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) is a long-term complication of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) that is characterized by chronic, persistent pain, swelling and other signs in the affected limb. PTS is common, burdensome and costly. It is likely to increase in prevalence, since despite widespread use of and improvements in the efficacy of thromboprophylaxis, the incidence of DVT has not decreased over time. About 20-50% of patients develop PTS within 1-2 years of symptomatic DVT, and severe PTS, which can include venous ulcers, occurs in 5-10% of cases. Although there is no gold standard for the diagnosis of PTS, the presence of typical clinical features in a patient with previous DVT provides strong supporting evidence. Objective evidence of venous valvular incompetence helps to confirm the diagnosis in symptomatic patients. Preventing ipsilateral recurrence of DVT, by ensuring an adequate duration and intensity of anticoagulation for the initial DVT and by prescribing situational thromboprophylaxis after discontinuation of oral anticoagulants, is likely to reduce the risk of developing PTS. There is no proven role for thrombolysis of the initial DVT to prevent PTS. Daily use of graduated compression stockings after DVT may reduce the risk of PTS, and may prevent worsening of established PTS. Pending the results of ongoing studies, stockings are recommended in patients with persistent symptoms or swelling after DVT. Future research should focus on standardizing criteria for PTS diagnosis, identification of DVT patients at high risk for PTS, and rigorously evaluating the effectiveness of stockings, thrombolysis, and venoactive drugs in preventing or treating PTS."
CD008201,0,11449339,0,Effective risk stratification of surgical and nonsurgical patients for venous thromboembolic disease.,"Effective and safe methods of preventing venous thromboembolism (VTE) are now widely available, but a significant proportion of patients develop VTE either because thromboprophylaxis has not been used or because the intensity of thromboprophylaxis is not matched to the level of risk. Thromboembolic risk varies widely according to the clinical setting and presence of underlying risk factors, but VTE may not be suspected even in high-risk patients. Clinical risk factors for VTE include recent surgery, cancer, stroke, previous VTE, immobilization, and advanced age. Recent attention has focused on the role of inherited and acquired molecular factors in determining overall thromboembolic risk. These factors include the classic thrombophilias-deficiencies of antithrombin III, protein C, and protein S-and several newly described molecular risk factors: factor V Leiden, the prothrombin 20210A gene mutation, and hyperhomocysteinemia. Based on emerging knowledge of risk factors, several risk assessment models (RAMs) have been devised that stratify patients according to overall VTE risk, allowing thromboprophylaxis to be tailored appropriately. Compared with older risk assessment formulas, current RAMs are simpler and include specific recommendations for thromboprophylaxis based on the available scientific evidence. Consensus documents on VTE prevention classify patients into low-, moderate-, and high-risk categories. More recently, a new risk group, very high risk, has been described. Very-high-risk patients are especially prone to thromboembolic complications and need intensive and in some cases prolonged thromboprophylaxis."

Effective and safe anticoagulation for the prevention and treatment of VTE is the cornerstone of the management of patients with cancer, aiming to decrease morbidity and mortality and to improve quality of life. Unfractionated heparin, low molecular weight heparins, fondaparinux and vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) are used in the prevention and treatment of VTE in cancer patients. Heparins and fondaparinux are administered subcutaneously. VKAs are orally active, but they have a narrow therapeutic window, numerous food and drug interactions, and treatment requires regular laboratory monitoring and dose adjustment. These limitations among others have important negative impact on the quality of life of patients and decrease adherence to the treatment. New orally active anticoagulant (NOAC) agents are specific inhibitors of activated factor Xa (FXa) (rivaroxaban and apixaban) or thrombin (dabigatran). It is expected that NOACs will improve antithrombotic treatment. Cancer patients are a particular group that could benefit from treatment with NOACs. However, NOACs present some significant interactions with drugs frequently used in cancer patients, which might influence their pharmacokinetics, compromising their efficacy and safety. In the present review, we analyzed the available data from the subgroups of patients with active cancer who were included in Phase III clinical trials that assessed the efficacy and safety of NOACs in the prevention and treatment of VTE. The data from the Phase III trials in prophylaxis of VTE by rivaroxaban or apixaban highlight that these two agents, although belonging to the same pharmacological group (direct inhibitors of factor Xa), have substantially different profiles of efficacy and safety, especially in hospitalized acutely ill medical patients with active cancer. A limited number of patients with VTE and active cancer were included in the Phase III trials (EINSTEIN, AMPLIFY, and RE-COVER) which evaluated the efficacy and safety of NOACs in the acute phase and secondary prevention of VTE. Although, from a conceptual point of view, NOACs could be an attractive alternative for the treatment of VTE in cancer patients, the available data do not support this option. In addition, due to the elimination of the NOACs by the liver and renal pathway as well as because of their pharmacological interactions with drugs which are frequently used in cancer patients, an eventual use of these drugs in cancer patients should be extremely cautious and be restricted only to patients presenting with contraindications for low molecular weight heparins, fondaparinux, or VKAs. The analysis of the available data presented in this review reinforces the request for the design of new Phase III clinical trials for the assessment of the efficacy and safety of NOACs in specific populations of patients with cancer."

These studies have shown enoxaparin to be cost effective compared with unfractionated heparin (UFH) and warfarin in short-term thromboprophylaxis for hospital inpatients undergoing orthopaedic surgery and in thromboprophylaxis following trauma. Outpatient treatment of acute proximal deep vein thrombosis with enoxaparin has also been shown to be cost effective compared with inpatient treatment using UFH. In general surgery, however, it remains to be determined whether enoxaparin is a cost-effective alternative to UFH. The cost effectiveness of enoxaparin compared with UFH in the treatment of unstable angina and non-Q-wave myocardial infarction has also been investigated in several countries using clinical outcomes data from the Efficacy and Safety of Subcutaneous Enoxaparin in Non-Q-wave Coronary Events (ESSENCE) randomised trial. ESSENCE demonstrated that enoxaparin was superior to UFH in terms of tolerability and efficacy, and cost saving at both 30-day and 1-year follow-ups. An increasing number of studies indicate enoxaparin to be of economic benefit when used for prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism and treatment of acute coronary symdromes."
CD008201,0,22845816,0,Acute cardioembolic cerebral infarction: answers to clinical questions.,"Cardioembolic cerebral infarction (CI) is the most severe subtype of ischaemic stroke but some clinical aspects of this condition are still unclear. This article provides the reader with an overview and up-date of relevant aspects related to clinical features, specific cardiac disorders and prognosis of CI. CI accounts for 14-30% of ischemic strokes; patients with CI are prone to early and long-term stroke recurrence, although recurrences may be preventable by appropriate treatment during the acute phase and strict control at follow-up. Certain clinical features are suggestive of CI, including sudden onset to maximal deficit, decreased level of consciousness at onset, Wernicke's aphasia or global aphasia without hemiparesis, a Valsalva manoeuvre at the time of stroke onset, and co-occurrence of cerebral and systemic emboli. Lacunar clinical presentations, a lacunar infarct and especially multiple lacunar infarcts, make cardioembolic origin unlikely. The most common disorders associated with a high risk of cardioembolism include atrial fibrillation, recent myocardial infarction, mechanical prosthetic valve, dilated myocardiopathy and mitral rheumatic stenosis. Patent foramen ovale and complex atheromatosis of the aortic arch are potentially emerging sources of cardioembolic infarction. Mitral annular calcification can be a marker of complex aortic atheroma in stroke patients of unkown etiology. Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiogram can disclose structural heart diseases. Paroxysmal atrial dysrhythmia can be detected by Holter monitoring. Magnetic resonance imaging, transcranial Doppler, and electrophysiological studies are useful to document the source of cardioembolism. In-hospital mortality in cardioembolic stroke (27.3%, in our series) is the highest as compared with other subtypes of cerebral infarction. Secondary prevention with anticoagulants should be started immediately if possible in patients at high risk for recurrent cardioembolic stroke in which contraindications, such as falls, poor compliance, uncontrolled epilepsy or gastrointestinal bleeding are absent. Dabigatran has been shown to be non-inferior to warfarin in the prevention of stroke or systemic embolism. All significant structural defects, such as atrial septal defects, vegetations on valve or severe aortic disease should be treated. Aspirin is recommended in stroke patients with a patent foramen ovale and indications of closure should be individualized. CI is an important topic in the frontier between cardiology and vascular neurology, occurs frequently in daily practice, has a high impact for patients, and health care systems and merits an update review of current clinical issues, advances and controversies."

CD008201,0,17124100,0,Prevention of venous thromboembolism in high-risk patients.,"The prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients recovering from major trauma, spinal cord injury (SCI), or other critical illness is often challenging. These patient groups share a high risk for VTE, they often have at least a temporary high bleeding risk, and there are relatively few thromboprophylaxis trials specific to these populations. A systematic literature review has been conducted to summarize the risks and prevention of VTE in these three groups. It is concluded that routine thromboprophylaxis should be provided to major trauma, SCI and critical care patients based on an individual assessment of their thrombosis and bleeding risks. For patients at high risk for VTE, including those recovering from major trauma and SCI, prophylaxis with a low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) should commence as soon as hemostasis has been demonstrated. For critical care patients at lower thrombosis risk, either LMWH or low-dose heparin is recommended. For those with a very high risk of bleeding, mechanical prophylaxis should be instituted as early as possible and continued until pharmacologic prophylaxis can be initiated. The use of prophylactic inferior vena caval filters is strongly discouraged because their potential benefit has not been shown to outweigh the risks or substantial costs. Implementation of thromboprophylaxis in these patients requires a local commitment to this important patient safety priority as well as a highly functional delivery system, based on the use of pre-printed orders, computer prompts, regular audit and feedback, and ongoing quality improvement efforts."

The large-scale clinical examination of an adult population (a high-risk strategy), which has been launched in the country since 2013 to solve the problems of detecting people with noncommunicable diseases and their risk factors and making a prevention counseling, is simultaneously a mechanism for the formation of a full therapeutic area passport to identify follow-up groups (a secondary prevention strategy). Currently, there is an obviously insufficient follow-up of inadequate quality. The reasons for this situation are a lack of regular training of local doctors in follow-up in addition to staff shortages. Medical teachers and professional communities working on the basis of common guidelines must be attracted to solve this problem. The actual introduction of a local therapist's efficient performance measures, the setting up of special structures in charge of primary care prevention in the health authorities, and the active involvement of medical prevention and health centers (for people at high risk in the absence of proven non-communicable diseases) in this process will be able to enhance the efficiency of a follow-up.

CD008201,0,20381665,0,Warfarin and aspirin use in atrial fibrillation among practicing cardiologist (from the AFFECTS Registry).,"Among patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), the risk of thromboembolism is a significant concern. However, the reported use of warfarin among patients with AF at elevated risk of stroke remains low. In the present study, we have provided information on anticoagulation use reported during the recent Atrial Fibrillation: Focus on Effective Clinical Treatment Strategies (AFFECTS) Registry. Among patients identified by their physician at baseline to be at an increased risk of stroke, as determined from an assessment of the medical history, 74% received warfarin and 29% received aspirin. Post hoc analysis of warfarin use stratified by Congestive heart failure, Hypertension, Age, Diabetes, Stroke, (CHADS(2)) doubled score revealed that at the end of the study, warfarin use was 73% (155 of 213) and 66% (185 of 280) in the rate- and rhythm-control patients with a score of > or = 2, respectively, compared to 60% (183 of 306) and 49% (322 of 662) in the rate- and rhythm-control patients with a score of <2, respectively. The practicing cardiologists who participated in this registry initiated anticoagulation therapy in most of their patients with AF. However, warfarin use is not yet in line with the guidelines and evidence-based recommendations. Patients considered at no risk of stroke appear to have been overprescribed anticoagulant agents, and a considerable portion of high-risk patients did not receive warfarin. In conclusion, these results suggest that continued physician education of appropriate anticoagulation use in patients with AF is needed."
CD008201,0,23054465,0,"Identifying, monitoring and reducing preventable major bleeds in the hospital setting.","Recent literature describes methods to reduce ""preventable"" hospital-acquired venous thromboembolism; however, there is a paucity of data on ""preventable"" bleeding. While risk assessment models exist for both thrombosis and bleeding, these concepts should be differentiated from whether the event was preventable or non-preventable. Here we describe a protocol to identify, monitor, and evaluate anticoagulation-related preventable hospital-acquired major bleeds (PHAMB). This single-center, prospective observational study with retrospective chart review was conducted in 2009 and 2010 to identify anticoagulation-related major bleeding. Eligible anticoagulation-related hospital-acquired major bleeds (HAMB) were further classified as ""preventable"" or ""non-preventable"". A total of 229 major bleed episodes were identified of which 188 were excluded due to being community-acquired or non-anticoagulation related major bleeds. Over the 2 year period, five of the 41 HAMB were classified as preventable providing a total incidence of 13 % PHAMB. Three and two of the PHAMB were due to inappropriate dosing and administration of an anticoagulant when contraindications existed, respectively. PHAMB rates decreased from 0.06 in 2009 to 0.04 per 1000 patient days in 2010 (p = 0.62) although this difference was not statistically significant. Raw incidence utilizing Joint Commission methodology demonstrated a 16.7 % rate in 2009 and an 8.7 % rate in 2010. In hospitalized patients, intervention programs may minimize the incidence of anticoagulation-related PHAMB and may maintain similar rates of preventable bleeding over time. Similar programs should be explored prospectively on a larger scale to reduce harm from anticoagulants in the hospital setting."

Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) was administered within 24 hours of injury or on achieving haemodynamic stability. Patients were screened for proximal DVT by duplex ultrasonography performed ten to 14 days after surgery. The incidence of proximal DVT was 10% and of pulmonary embolus 5%. Proximal DVT developed in two of 64 patients (3%) who had received LMWH within 24 hours of injury, but in eight of 36 patients (22%) who received LMWH more than 24 hours after the injury (p < 0.01). We conclude that LMWH, when begun without delay, is a safe and effective method of thromboprophylaxis in high-risk patients with major pelvic or acetabular fractures."

Medical conditions associated with a high risk of venous thromboembolism include cardiac disease, cancer, respiratory disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and infectious diseases. Predisposing risk factors in medical patients include a history of venous thromboembolism, history of malignancy, complicating infections, increasing age, thrombophilia, prolonged immobility, and obesity. Heparins, including unfractionated and low molecular weight, as well as fondaparinux have been shown to be effective agents in prevention of VTE in this setting. However, it has not yet been possible to demonstrate a significant effect on mortality rates in this population. In medical patients, unfractionated heparin has a higher rate of bleeding complications than low molecular weight heparin. There is no evidence for the use of aspirin, warfarin, or mechanical methods. We recommend either low molecular weight heparin or fondaparinux as safe and effective agents in the thromboprophylaxis of medical patients."

Patients with HCM are at an increased risk of atrial fibrillation, which is not only poorly tolerated in this population, but also increases their risk of an embolic event. The incidence of stroke in HCM patients with atrial fibrillation is approximately 21-23%. Given the high risk of stroke, antithrombotic therapy with warfarin is recommended in national guidelines. This therapy should be used without regard to other risk factors for stroke that may be present. Anticoagulation with the new oral anticoagulants may be considered as an alternative; although, specific data for patients with HCM is not available.

CD008201,0,20694545,0,[Prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism and anticoagulation bridging. Strategies in otorhinolaryngology].,Various interdisciplinary guidelines recommend that in-patients at risk of venous thromboembolism should receive pharmacologic prophylaxis. Among the anticoagulants low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWH) and fondaparinux can be considered the medications of choice because of the favorable pharmacokinetic properties when compared with unfractionated heparin. Treatment with vitamin K antagonists has to be interrupted in patients undergoing major surgery or invasive procedures. Oral anticoagulation has to be temporarily replaced by short-acting anticoagulants such as LMWH in order to prevent thromboembolic complications (anticoagulation bridging). Although LMWHs have not been approved for this clinical setting their efficacy and safety has been demonstrated in several recent studies. Detailed recommendations for prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism in otorhinolaryngology are lacking although numerous surgical procedures are considered to be associated with a significant risk of thromboembolism. A strategy for pharmacologic prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism and anticoagulation bridging in otorhinolaryngology is proposed.

The aim of this study was to assess whether the systematic and methodical implementation of evidence-based interventions encapsulated in a care bundle influenced length of ventilation and ICU length of stay (LOS). A ventilator care bundle was introduced within a general ICU and evaluated 1 year later. The care bundle was composed of four protocols that consisted of prophylaxis against peptic ulceration, prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis, daily cessation of sedation and elevation of the patient's head and chest to at least 30 degrees to the horizontal. Compliance with the bundle was assessed, as was ICU LOS, ICU mortality and ICU/high-dependency unit patient throughput. Mean ICU LOS was reduced from 13-75 [standard deviation (SD) 19.11] days to 8.36 (SD 10.21) days (p<0.05). Mean ventilator days were reduced from 10.8 (SD 15.58) days to 6.1 (SD 8.88) days. Unit patient throughput increased by 30.1% and the number of invasively ventilated patients increased by 39.5%.

It is highly efficacious for the treatment and prevention of thromboembolic disorders despite its narrow therapeutic window. Poor compliance with warfarin is common and a major contributor to poor anticoagulation control. A number of psychosocial issues (e.g. depressive symptoms, attitudinal and behavioral factors, cognitive function, lack of social support, limited English proficiency, health illiteracy) have been associated with warfarin non-compliance among patients in anticoagulation clinics. Patient-specific features, such as these, are important to identify in order to develop appropriate and practical interventions. Health literacy and limited English proficiency are the extension of issues related to culture, language, and ethnicity. A better understanding of patients' functioning level and health utilization factors may help to develop and target interventions for high risk patients and reduce complications from suboptimal therapy and poor warfarin management due to non-compliance.

CD008201,0,1474552,0,The use of thromboprophylaxis in total hip replacement surgery: are the attitudes of orthopaedic surgeons changing?,"We conducted a survey of all 926 active members of the British Orthopaedic Association using a postal questionnaire to find out their current attitude to thromboprophylaxis in total hip replacement surgery. Previous surveys have been performed, and with all the recent literature on the subject we wanted to see if the attitude of British orthopaedic surgeons has changed. There were 676 replies, a response rate of 73%. Fifty-five replies were excluded, those from surgeons who had retired from practice or whose practice did not include total hip replacement surgery. Of the remaining 621 surgeons, 466 (75%) use some method of thromboprophylaxis, with 367 (59%) routinely using prophylactic pharmacological agents and 99 (16%) using mechanical methods of thromboprophylaxis. Twenty-five per cent (155) of surgeons used no routine method of thromboprophylaxis. Eight-six per cent (534) of surgeons used a pharmacological method of prophylaxis in those patients thought to have a high risk of developing a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (eg previous DVT, cardiovascular disease, obesity). Thirty-two different methods of thromboprophylaxis were used. Low molecular weight heparin is now being used by 19% of surgeons routinely and by 25% of surgeons in high risk cases, whereas 3 years ago it was not used at all. Our survey shows that although there is still a great reluctance for British orthopaedic surgeons to use pharmacological agents routinely in thromboprophylaxis. Amongst those that do, low molecular weight heparin is being increasingly used. More surgeons may want to use low molecular weight heparin routinely, but in some hospitals it is not currently available."

CD008201,0,19912518,0,Venous thromboembolism in malignant gliomas.,"Malignant gliomas are associated with a very high risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). While many clinical risk factors have previously been described in brain tumor patients, the risk of VTE associated with newer anti-angiogenic therapies such as bevacizumab in these patients remains unclear. When VTE occurs in this patient population, concern regarding the potential for intracranial hemorrhage complicates management decisions regarding anticoagulation, and these patients have a worse prognosis than their VTE-free counterparts. Risk stratification models identifying patients at high risk of developing VTE along with predictive plasma biomarkers may guide the selection of eligible patients for primary prevention with pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis. Recent studies exploring disordered coagulation, such as increased expression of tissue factor (TF), and tumorigenic molecular signaling may help to explain the increased risk of VTE in patients with malignant gliomas."
CD008201,0,10068716,0,Low-molecular-weight heparin in outpatient treatment of DVT.,"Patients with a diagnosis of acute deep venous thrombosis have traditionally been hospitalized and treated with unfractionated heparin followed by oral anticoagulation therapy. Several clinical trials have shown that low-molecular-weight heparin is at least as safe and effective as unfractionated heparin in the treatment of uncomplicated deep venous thrombosis. The use of low-molecular-weight heparin in an outpatient program for the management of deep venous thrombosis provides a treatment alternative to hospitalization in selected patients. Use of low-molecular-weight heparin on an outpatient basis requires coordination of care, laboratory monitoring, and patient education and participation in treatment. Overlapping the initiation of warfarin permits long-term anticoagulation. Advantages include a decreased incidence of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and fewer episodes of bleeding complications. Future clinical trials evaluating the safety and efficacy of low-molecular-weight heparin in the treatment of complicated deep venous thrombosis will further define appropriate indications for use and strategies for outpatient management."

CD008201,0,8254250,0,Surgical management of intraluminal carotid thrombi.,"The most suitable treatment for intraluminal carotid thrombi remains still a much debated question. Some authors have reported a lower morbidity in patients treated with anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy; on the other side, urgent or delayed surgery is burdened with a high risk of perioperative stroke. Over 11 years (october 1981-november 1992) 602 surgical revascularizations on epi-aortic vessels have been performed at Vascular Surgery Unit of Udine Regional Hospital. Only 2 cases of intraluminal carotid thrombi were observed: both fulfilled the angiographic requirements for endovasal filling defect, surrounded by contrast medium, adherent to posterior wall and extending to distal internal carotid artery. First patient suffered a TIA 20 days before surgery, the second one a previous major stroke contralateral to the thrombus. The former was given preoperatively a medical anticoagulant treatment (warfarin). At operation we discovered a nearly complete resolution of the thrombus: only its adherent base was still present. Therefore we performed a routine endarterectomy and a PTFE patch angioplasty. The latter case reported had no preliminary medical treatment; a thrombus extending from carotid bulbus to external and internal carotid was detected and then removed without any distal embolization. Arteriotomy was closed by Dacron Velour patch angioplasty. No perioperative stroke occurred in both cases: our second patient showed a partial resolution of his motility deficit. According to our limited experience, delayed surgical treatment of intraluminal carotid thrombi seems not to be affected with higher risk of perioperative stroke than prophylactic carotid endarterectomy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Two days later he started to complain of acute abdominal pain, and laboratory findings showed a low hemoglobin level. Imaging findings (ultrasonography and CT scan) showed evidence of subcapsular liver haematoma, caused by bleeding at hepatic and splenic level. He received red blood packed cells, fresh frozen plasma, cryoprecipitate, activated factor VII and was transferred by helicopter to Fundeni Clinical Institute--Intensive care unit (ICU). On admission, the patient was conscious, anxious, dyspneic, with mild hypoxia, with no signs of low cardiac output and with a painful abdomen. ECG, echocardiography and elevated myocardial necrosis enzymes confirmed myocardial infarction. Shortly after admission there was a worsening of his clinical condition, with a decrease in hemoglobin level despite red blood packed cells administration (Hb=7.8 g/dl) and thrombocytopenia (82000/mmc), with normal coagulation tests, thus suggesting active intraabdominal bleeding. Echography and CT scan confirmed bleeding. Emergency surgery was performed, showing massive haemoperitoneum (approx 4.5 L of blood), due to spontaneous rupture of a subcapsular hematoma in the liver. The surgical hemostasis was performed on the liver parenchyma laceration. Duration of surgery was 4 hours. There were no significant cardiac events during surgery (no signs of ischemia on ECG, no ST elevation), despite the need for inotropic agent. After surgery, the patient was referred to the ICU, intubated and ventilated, with inotropic support - dobutamine. Sequential ECG's, enzymatic trend and echocardiographies were performed to monitor myocardial ischemia. The outcome was favourable, no further bleeding and no postoperative myocardial infarction occurred. Secondary prevention was started early (thromboprophylaxis, selective beta-blocker, angiotensin inhibitors and statins). The patient had a favorable outcome and was discharged from the ICU the fourth day after surgery. He had a total length of stay in hospital of seven days, with a follow-up in the cardiology department."

CD008201,0,26151096,0,Computerized Clinical Decision Support to Prevent Venous Thromboembolism Among Hospitalized Patients: Proximal Outcomes from a Multiyear Quality Improvement Project.,"Despite venous thromboembolism (VTE) policy initiatives, gaps exist between guidelines and practice. In response, hospitals implement clinical decision support (CDS) systems to improve VTE prophylaxis. To assess the impact of a VTE CDS on reducing incidence of VTE, this study used a pretest/posttest, longitudinal, cohort design incorporating electronic health record (EHR) data from one urban tertiary and level 1 trauma center, and one suburban hospital. VTE CDS was embedded into the EHR system. The study included 45,046 admissions; 171,753 patient days; and 110 VTE events. The VTE rate declined from 0.954 per 1,000 patient days to 0.434 comparing baseline to full VTE CDS. Compared to baseline, patients benefitting from VTE CDS were 35% less likely to have a VTE. VTE CDS utilization achieved 78.4% patients assessed within 24 hr from admission, 64.0% patients identified at risk, and 47.7% patients at risk for VTE with an initiated VTE interdisciplinary plan of care. CDS systems with embedded algorithms, alerts, and notification capabilities enable physicians at the point of care to utilize guidelines and make impactful decisions to prevent VTE. This study demonstrates a phased-in implementation of VTE CDS as an effective approach toward VTE prevention. Implications for future research and quality improvement are discussed as well."

A retrospective medical chart review was conducted at the American University Hospital, in Beirut, Lebanon. All adult and pediatric patients admitted to the hospital between 1 January and 31 December 1998 who underwent either anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) or lupus anticoagulant (LA) testing were included in the study. Work-up of APS syndrome was compared with: (a) the consensus guidelines for clinical diagnosis; (b) physician specialty; and (c) patient demographics (age, gender, ethnicity, health insurance status). Eighty-seven patients fulfilled at least one clinical criterion for APS; 92% were for work-up of thrombosis and 8% for pregnancy morbidities. Fifty-one percent underwent both aCL and LA. Overall 38% (33) of patients had an abnormal test result, however only 18% (6) underwent retesting, of whom only two satisfied a minimum of 6 weeks between test and retest TheAPS diagnostic work-up was requested by 11 different specialties. Rheumatologists were the most consistent in asking for both tests. APS is seen and diagnosed by a variety of medical specialties. Practice patterns as compared with the latest consensus are sub-optimal, and need to be improved. Interventions to help improve this have been discussed and are being implemented."

CD008201,0,24326411,0,Development of an anticoagulation stewardship program at a large tertiary care academic institution.,"Pharmacist-directed anticoagulation management services (AMSs) have been shown to significantly lower anticoagulation-related mortality, length of hospital stay, bleeding complications, blood transfusion requirements, and cost of therapy. AMSs are only 1 component of an anticoagulation stewardship program. Frequently, stewardship programs are limited to inpatient populations. Incorporating components that facilitate transition to outpatient status will ideally encompass complete care. The purpose of this program was to expand anticoagulation services and standardize care by implementing a full-service stewardship program including a transition of care service. The first component of the study involved medication surveillance for inpatients on anticoagulation therapy. The second component involved transitioning patients on anticoagulation, primarily with venous thromboembolism (VTE) to outpatient management. Finally, the pharmacist identified areas for optimization. Optimization involved developing or updating protocols to reflect updates in the literature as well as updating institution-specific information resources. Interventions made through medication surveillance and utilization of the VTE transition of care services translated into a total cost savings of approximately US$270 320. A postgraduate, first-year pharmacy resident contributed to improving patient outcomes while reducing utilization of hospital services and obtaining substantial cost savings through participation in anticoagulation stewardship services."
CD008201,0,15383478,0,Prevention of venous thromboembolism: the Seventh ACCP Conference on Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy.,"This article discusses the prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and is part of the Seventh American College of Chest Physicians Conference on Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy: Evidence-Based Guidelines. Grade 1 recommendations are strong and indicate that the benefits do, or do not, outweigh risks, burden, and costs. Grade 2 suggests that individual patients' values may lead to different choices (for a full understanding of the grading see Guyatt et al, CHEST 2004; 126:179S-187S). Among the key recommendations in this chapter are the following. We recommend against the use of aspirin alone as thromboprophylaxis for any patient group (Grade 1A). For moderate-risk general surgery patients, we recommend prophylaxis with low-dose unfractionated heparin (LDUH) (5,000 U bid) or low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) [< or = 3,400 U once daily] (both Grade 1A). For higher risk general surgery patients, we recommend thromboprophylaxis with LDUH (5,000 U tid) or LMWH (> 3,400 U daily) [both Grade 1A]. For high-risk general surgery patients with multiple risk factors, we recommend combining pharmacologic methods (LDUH three times daily or LMWH, > 3,400 U daily) with the use of graduated compression stockings and/or intermittent pneumatic compression devices (Grade 1C+). We recommend that thromboprophylaxis be used in all patients undergoing major gynecologic surgery (Grade 1A) or major, open urologic procedures, and we recommend prophylaxis with LDUH two times or three times daily (Grade 1A). For patients undergoing elective total hip or knee arthroplasty, we recommend one of the following three anticoagulant agents: LMWH, fondaparinux, or adjusted-dose vitamin K antagonist (VKA) [international normalized ratio (INR) target, 2.5; range, 2.0 to 3.0] (all Grade 1A). For patients undergoing hip fracture surgery (HFS), we recommend the routine use of fondaparinux (Grade 1A), LMWH (Grade 1C+), VKA (target INR, 2.5; range, 2.0 to 3.0) [Grade 2B], or LDUH (Grade 1B). We recommend that patients undergoing hip or knee arthroplasty, or HFS receive thromboprophylaxis for at least 10 days (Grade 1A). We recommend that all trauma patients with at least one risk factor for VTE receive thromboprophylaxis (Grade 1A). In acutely ill medical patients who have been admitted to the hospital with congestive heart failure or severe respiratory disease, or who are confined to bed and have one or more additional risk factors, we recommend prophylaxis with LDUH (Grade 1A) or LMWH (Grade 1A). We recommend, on admission to the intensive care unit, all patients be assessed for their risk of VTE. Accordingly, most patients should receive thromboprophylaxis (Grade 1A)."

CD008201,0,26720163,0,Pharmacological Prophylaxis for Venous Thromboembolism Among Hospitalized Patients With Acute Medical Illness: An Electronic Medical Records Study.,"Patients hospitalized with acute medical illness have an elevated risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). American College of Chest Physicians guidelines list various chronic illnesses, sepsis, advanced age, history of VTE, and immobility as risk factors and recommend prophylactic anticoagulation using fondaparinux, low-molecular weight heparin, or low-dose unfractionated heparin. The objectives of this study were to examine pharmacological prophylaxis against VTE among hospitalized medically ill patients and to assess demographic and clinical correlates related to VTE prophylaxis. A retrospective (1999-2010) electronic medical records study included patients aged 40 years and older hospitalized for at least 3 days, with significant medical illness or with a VTE hospitalization 30-365 days before admission. Each patient's first qualifying hospitalization was analyzed. Exclusions were if VTE treatment was started within 1 day of admission, or if warfarin (and not heparin or enoxaparin) was used. Prophylaxis was defined if the first inpatient dose of subcutaneous heparin or enoxaparin was at prophylaxis levels (lower than treatment levels). Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine factors associated with VTE prophylaxis. Among 12,980 patients, 22.1% received prophylaxis (11.8% with enoxaparin, 10.3% with heparin). VTE prophylaxis was positively associated with year of hospitalization, subcutaneous heparin in the month before admission, aspirin, self-pay status, age, and sepsis. VTE prophylaxis was negatively associated with smoking, alcohol, warfarin in the past 30 days, and primary diagnoses of stroke, infectious disease, or inflammatory bowel disease. Pharmacological VTE prophylaxis has increased significantly over the past 12 years but is still largely underused in patients hospitalized with acute medical illness. Multiple demographic, behavioral, and clinical factors are associated with inpatient VTE prophylaxis."
CD008201,0,21774881,0,Impact of venous thromboembolism on clinical management and therapy after hip and knee arthroplasty.,"Postoperative deep vein thrombosis (DVT) occurs most often in the large veins of the legs in patients undergoing major joint arthroplasty and major surgical procedures. These patients remain at high risk for venous thromboembolic events. In patients undergoing total hip or total knee arthroplasty (THA or TKA, respectively), different patterns of altered venous hemodynamics and hypercoagulability have been found, thus the rate of distal DVT is higher than that of proximal DVT after TKA. In addition, symptomatic venous thromboembolism (VTE) occurs earlier after TKA than THA; however, most of those events occur after hospital discharge. Consequently, extended thromboprophylaxis after discharge should be considered and is particularly important after THA owing to the prolonged risk period for VTE. Evidence-based guideline recommendations for the prevention of VTE in these patients have not been fully implemented. This is partly owing to the limitations of traditional anticoagulants, such as the parenteral route of administration or frequent coagulation monitoring and dose adjustment, as well as concerns about bleeding risks. The introduction of new oral agents (e.g., dabigatran etexilate and rivaroxaban) may facilitate guideline adherence, particularly in the outpatient setting, owing to their oral administration without the need for routine coagulation monitoring. Furthermore, the direct Factor Xa inhibitor rivaroxaban has been shown to be more effective than enoxaparin in preventing VTE."
CD008201,0,22072096,0,The impact of comorbidities on stroke prophylaxis strategies in atrial fibrillation patients.,"Arial fibrillation (AF) is the most commonly occurring sustained arrhythmia in the United States and is associated with increased mortality. AF is a risk factor for ischemic stroke, and risk factors for AF include comorbid conditions such as congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, older age, hypertension, diabetes, pulmonary disease, and history of stroke, transient ischemic attack, or heart failure. Risk stratification for ischemic stroke in AF patients is based on scoring a group of risk factors that allows for the appropriate tailoring of antithrombotic therapy. The vitamin K antagonists are effective at reducing ischemic stroke rates in medium-risk to high-risk patients and are therefore generally recommended for this group. However, a large proportion of these patients are not treated with vitamin K antagonists because of the potential for adverse outcomes, particularly in elderly patients. New direct thrombin inhibitors and direct Factor Xa inhibitors in development offer the possibility of simplifying treatment and management although offering similar or better efficacy and safety profiles to warfarin. In light of these potential new treatments, the importance and improvement of risk stratification methods and the resulting recommendations in thromboprophylaxis become even more paramount as they make it more likely that medium-risk to high-risk patients can be treated safely."
CD008201,0,12826530,0,Epidemiology of inhibitors and current treatment strategies.,"The development of inhibitors is currently one of the most serious complications in the treatment of hemophilic children. Prospective studies of previously untreated patients (PUP) showed that up to 52% of patients with severe hemophilia A developed inhibitors during the first 50 exposure days (ED) (>100 for outliers). Inhibitor development is influenced by the type of hemophilia, the severity and the type of mutation. No significant differences in inhibitor incidence were found in prospective studies conducted with plasma-derived or recombinant products. However, no comparative study has been finished yet. A still ongoing prospective, multi-center PUP-study initiated by the German, Austrian and the Swiss Society of Thrombosis and Hemostasis Research (GTH) foresees the direct comparison of different types of concentrates with regard to inhibitor development. Preliminary results (update February 2002) show a slightly higher inhibitor development (p=0.08) in severely affected hemophilia A patients treated with recombinant factor (F) VIII concentrates. However, the groups are very small and statistically reliable statements cannot be made at the moment. In case of inhibitor development rapid inhibitor elimination and immune tolerance induction (ITI) is the preferred way to reduce the high risk of bleeding episodes. In this respect, various therapeutic regimens, such as the administration of high doses of FVIII twice daily (Bonn protocol), or lower doses three times weekly (van Creveld protocol), have been attempted. Elimination of inhibitors from plasma by immune adsorption followed by immune suppression (Malmö protocol) has also been used. The influence of the type of concentrate used for ITI has never been investigated comparatively. A longitudinal study of ITI at our center showed a significantly decreased success rate since the introduction of high purity plasma derived and recombinant FVIII products using the Bonn protocol. In inhibitor patients who showed an unsatisfactory response to treatment with FVIII concentrates with very little or no VWF the change to concentrates containing high amounts of von Willebrand factor (VWF) increased success rates up to 90%. These observations raise the question of whether VWF plays an important role in the induction of immune tolerance."

Between 2005 and 2008, the use of ABHRs increased significantly by 8 L per 1000 patient-days of hospitalization per year. During the same period, adherence to hand hygiene increased significantly from 55.6% to 70.9% (P < 0.0001). Despite these improvements there was a steady increase in the incidence of ESBL-producing strains in the past three years and no correlation was found between ABHR consumption and either nosocomially acquired ESBL or adherence to hand hygiene."

CD008201,0,20106538,0,"Risk factors for pulmonary complications, including pulmonary embolism, after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) in elderly Koreans.","There has been a steady increase in elective TKA in elderly Koreans. However, there are few reports about the incidence of and risk factors for pulmonary complications, including pulmonary thromboembolism in these patients. We evaluated retrospectively 338 patients aged 60 years and over (290 females, median age 69 years) to assess the incidence and predictive factors for pulmonary complications, including pulmonary thromboembolism after TKA. Of these patients, 264 underwent simultaneous bilateral TKA (78%) by two surgeons and 56 (17%) had general anesthesia. No patient received thromboprophylaxis. There were 49 postoperative pulmonary complications in the 338 patients (14.2%, 49/338). Of the 49 patients, 27 developed atelectasis (27/49), six developed pneumonia (6/49), and four had pleural effusions (4/49) within 7 days of the surgery; 12 patients had a pulmonary thromboembolism (12/49) during their hospitalization. No pulmonary complication was fatal. Multivariate analysis revealed that pulmonary hypertension (right ventricular systolic pressure≥35 mmHg on transthoracic echocardiography; odds ratio (OR)=3.0, p=0.016) was independently associated with pulmonary complications. A resting PaCO(2)≥45 mmHg (OR=22.9, p=0.004) was the only independent predictor of the development of a pulmonary thromboembolism. Pulmonary hypertension may thus predict pulmonary complications and a PaCO(2) greater than 45 mmHg may be a risk factor for pulmonary thromboembolism following TKA. Preoperative blood gas analysis and transthoracic echocardiography can identify those patients at high risk for pulmonary complications, including pulmonary thromboembolism, after TKA in elderly Korean patients."
CD008201,0,20047130,0,Outpatient treatment of pulmonary embolism.,"Pulmonary embolism (PE) is traditionally treated in hospital. Growing evidence from non randomized prospective studies suggests that a substantial proportion of patients with non-massive PE might be safely treated in the outpatient setting using low molecular weight heparins. Based on this evidence, professional societies started to recommend outpatient care for selected patients with non-massive PE. Despite these recommendations, outpatient treatment of non-massive PE appears to be uncommon in clinical practice. The major barriers to PE outpatient care are, firstly, the uncertainty as how to identify low risk patients with PE who are candidates for outpatient care and secondly the lack of high quality evidence from randomized trials demonstrating the safety of PE outpatient care compared to traditional inpatient management. Also, although clinical prognostic models, echocardiography and cardiac biomarkers accurately identify low risk patients with PE in prospective studies, the benefit of risk stratification strategies based on these instruments should be demonstrated in prospective management studies and clinical trials before they can be implemented as decision aids to guide PE outpatient treatment. Before high quality evidence documenting the safety of an outpatient treatment approach is published, outpatient management of non-massive PE cannot be generally recommended."

Correct diagnosis of the syndrome is imperative to prevent unnecessary long secondary thromboprophylaxis. Three antiphospholipid antibody subtypes are included in the classification criteria of the antiphospholipid syndrome: lupus anticoagulants, anticardiolipin antibodies and anti-β2-glycoprotein I antibodies. Only lupus anticoagulants are undisputedly associated with thrombosis, which is why the serological criteria of the antiphospholipid syndrome are under debate. All of the assays used to detect antiphospholipid antibodies are in need of better standardization, although progress has been made in the detection of lupus anticoagulants. The inconsistent association between both anticardiolipin and anti-β2-glycoprotein I antibodies and thrombosis is a cause for alarm. We are in need of better assays to detect those individuals at risk for thrombosis and population-based prospective studies to provide us with accurate risk assessments."

CD008201,0,17541871,0,[Dual platelet aggregation inhibition in coronary artery stent implantation--what is evidence-based?].,"Dual platelet inhibition (ASA and clopidogrel) is the generally accepted standard therapy to avoid stent thrombosis although clopidogrel is not approved for this indication in Germany. The duration of dual platelet inhibition depends on the complexity of the stenosis, plaque activity and the type of stent implanted. Recent analyses suggested that implantation of drug eluting stents is associated with a substantially higher rate of stent thrombosis when compared with bare metal stents. This in turn fueled an ongoing debate about the optimal duration of dual platelet inhibition after implantation drug eluting stents. Guideline rcommendations vary between between 3 months and lifelong therapy with updates and additional statements published on a monthly basis leaving cardiologists and primary care providers in a state of therapeutic uncertainty. Taking the most recent guidelines and professional statements into account the following duration of dual platelet inhibition can be recommended: dual platelet inhibition for 1 month after implantation of bare metal stents, dual platelet inhibition for 9-12 months after an acute coronary syndrome; dual platelet inhibition for at least 12 months after implantation of drug eluting stents and brachytherapy in patients who are not at high risk for bleeding. Patients with previously implanted drug eluting stents who are currently taking dual antiplatelet therapy are at high risk for developing stent thrombosis when a situation arises that requires cessation or interruption of dual platelet inhibition. Therefore, the interventionalist is advised to carefully discuss risks and benefits of the selected stent and clearly document the decision process in an accepted consent form. When elective or urgent surgery is required the surgeon and practitioner must decide whether the procedure can be performed with reasonable safety without discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy posing a higher bleeding risk to the patient. Patients on chronic oral anticoaglation should be additionally treated with clopidogrel for 1 month after implantation of bare metal or 12 months after drug-eluting stents. Additional treatment with ASS is not generally recommended since the bleeding risk of this triple medication may overweigh the benefits of dual antiplatelet inhibition."

These recommendations have been instrumental in initiating further clinical trial to answer key questions regarding thromboprophylaxis and in setting a new standard for patient care. Also, the key to cost containment in management of DVT/PE is to (1) define the etiology (blood coagulation protein or platelet defect), institute appropriate long-term therapy as indicated, and assess appropriate family members as indicated if a hereditary defect is found and (2) use LMWH as inpatient management. saving a minimum of 210,000.00 dollars per 1000 patients simply from cost savings of recurrence, saving 17 lives per 1000 patients, and saving exorbitant costs of care for patients with recurrence and development of chronic venous insufficiency. The use of outpatient LMWH will save 4,900,000.00 dollars per 1000 patients if applied to the 70% of patients with DVT who fit the criteria of no comorbid condition requiring hospitalization and who arrive early enough to allow a diagnosis to be sent home or hospitalized for 24 hours or less. The simple defining of defects leading to unexplained thrombosis will add another 3,000,000.00 dollars in savings per 1000 patients with DVT and approximately 350,000.00 dollars per 100 patients with thrombotic stroke. In those with transient ischemic attacks, defining the defect and instituting appropriate antithrombotic therapy, thereby potentially saving approximately 30% from developing a thrombotic stroke, amounts to approximately 350,500.00 dollars (= 30% of 1,168,500.00 dollars) in savings per 100 patients."
CD008201,0,9730125,0,"Comparison of the use of a foot pump with the use of low-molecular-weight heparin for the prevention of deep-vein thrombosis after total hip replacement. A prospective, randomized trial.","We conducted a prospective, randomized trial to compare the safety and effectiveness of the A-V Impulse System foot pump with that of low-molecular-weight heparin for reducing the prevalence of deep-vein thrombosis after total hip replacement. Of 290 patients who were to have a primary total hip replacement, 143 were randomized to receive enoxaparin (forty milligrams daily) for seven days after the operation and 147, to use the foot pump for seven days. The primary outcome measure was the prevalence of deep-vein thrombosis, as determined by venography on the sixth, seventh, or eighth postoperative day. Secondary outcome measures included transfusion requirements, intraoperative blood loss, postoperative drainage, blood-loss index, appearance of the site of the wound according to a subjective visual-analog scale, and swelling of the thigh. The patients' compliance with the regimen for use of the foot pump was monitored with an internal timing device, and their acceptance of the device was assessed with a questionnaire. Symptoms consistent with pulmonary embolism were investigated with ventilation-perfusion scanning. The patients were contacted later for detection of symptoms of venous thromboembolism that may have occurred during the first three months after discharge from the hospital. Venography was performed on 274 patients: 136 who used the foot pump and 138 who received enoxaparin. Deep-vein thrombosis was detected in twenty-four (18 per cent) of the patients who used the foot pump compared with eighteen patients (13 per cent) who received enoxaparin (95 per cent confidence interval for the difference in proportions, -3.9 to +13.0 per cent). Thrombosis in the calf was found in seven patients (5 per cent) in the former group compared with six patients (4 per cent) in the latter (95 per cent confidence interval for the difference, -4.2 to +5.8 per cent), and proximal thrombosis was observed in seventeen patients (13 per cent) in the former group compared with twelve patients (9 per cent) in the latter (95 per cent confidence interval for the difference, -3.5 to +11.1 per cent). None of these differences was significant. No patient in either group had major proximal deep-vein thrombosis; all proximal thrombi were isolated entities involving the femoral valve cusp and were of unknown importance. One patient who used the foot pump had a non-fatal pulmonary embolism. One patient who received enoxaparin had a symptomatic deep-vein thrombosis during hospitalization. Two patients (one from each group [0.7 per cent]) were readmitted to the hospital because of a symptomatic deep-vein thrombosis despite normal venographic findings at the time of discharge. There was no difference in the transfusion requirements or the intraoperative blood loss between the two groups. There were more soft-tissue side effects in the patients who received enoxaparin than in those who used the foot pump: there was more bruising of the thigh and oozing of the wound (p < 0.001 for each), postoperative drainage (578 compared with 492 milliliters; p = 0.014), and swelling of the thigh (twenty compared with ten millimeters; p = 0.03). Of 124 patients who used the foot pump and were asked about the acceptability of the device, fourteen (11 per cent) said that it was uncomfortable, twenty-one (17 per cent) reported sleep disturbance, and four (3 per cent) stated that they had stopped using the device. Conversely, ten (8 per cent) found it relaxing. We concluded that the foot pump is a suitable alternative to low-molecular-weight heparin for prophylaxis against thromboembolism after total hip replacement and that it produces fewer soft-tissue side effects. Tolerance of the device is a problem for some patients."
CD008201,0,21207321,0,[Thromboprophylaxis during pregnancy and the puerperium: highlights from current guidelines].,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is one of the leading causes of maternal deaths worldwide. Mortality and morbidity of VTE are potentially preventable, since two-thirds of these women have identifiable risk factors and may benefit from appropriate thromboprophylaxis. Individual and careful assessment of the personal and family history as well as the assessment of pre-existing and new-onset/transient risk factors during pregnancy and after delivery are mandatory for an effective prevention of VTE. Current guidelines (American College of Chest Physicians 2008, AWMF-Guideline 003/001 2009 and the Royal College Guideline No. 37 2009) provide practical recommendations for risk stratification regarding low, intermediate and high risk conditions. At high risk are women with previous VTE or thrombophilia. Corresponding to risk stratification grade C recommendations have been made for VTE prophylaxis during pregnancy and the puerperium. Prophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) should begin as early in pregnancy as practical. In women with lower risk mobilisation, avoidance of dehydration and mechanical methods (e. g., graduated compressive stockings) are sufficient. After delivery women with intermediate risk should be given LMWH for 7 days, women at high risk for 6 weeks or as long as additional risk factors are present. All women who have additional risk factors and who have had an elective Caesarean section should receive prophylactic LMWH for 7 days as should also all women who have had a Caesarean section in labour or an emergency Caesarean section. At the onset of labour, in case of any vaginal bleeding, prior to induction of labour or 12 h before an elective Caesarean section, antenatal LMWH prophylaxis should be discontinued, LMWH prophylaxis can be continued for 4-6 h after vaginal and for 6-12 h after Caesarean delivery when the women do not have an increased risk of haemorrhage. Current guidelines recommend than LMWH are the agents of choice for antenatal thromboprophylaxis; in comparison to unfractionated heparin, LMWH are associated with a substantially lower risk of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and osteoporosis. Both oral anticoagulants and heparin are safe when breast-feeding."

CD008201,0,16637452,0,[Prevention of venous thromboembolism in internal medicine and neurology].,"Many hospitalized patients are under an increased risk of venous thromboembolism. They should have adequate pharmacological prophylaxis. Clinical studies including meta-analyses prove that low molecular weight heparin prophylaxis of venous thromboembolisms is equally effective as that employing unfractionated heparin and it features less bleeding complications. The effectiveness of pharmacological prophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin in hospitalized patients at internal medicine departments has been proven by the MEDENOX study when enoxaparin in a dose of 40 mg was administered subcutaneously and the PREVENT study when subcutaneous dalteparin 5 000 units j. was administered daily. In the MEDENOX study, enoxaparin administration was confirmed to decrease the relative risk of venous thromboembolisms by 63% without increasing any adverse effects during the prophylaxis and the PREVENT study showed that dalteparin administration was followed by a highly significant reduction of asymptomatic venous thromboses in hospitalized patients. According the ACCP guideline for thromboprophylaxis in hospitalized internal medicine patients with clinical risk factor of venous thromboembolism (tumors, heart failures, sepsis, VTE history and serious pulmonary condition), low molecular weight heparin or mini-doses of unfractionated heparin are to be administered. The recent recommendations discourage the use of acetyl-salicylic acid in monotherapy treatment for venous thromboembolism prevention."
CD008201,0,21162604,0,Overview of venous thromboembolism.,"Thrombosis occurs at sites of injury to the vessel wall, by inflammatory processes leading to activation of platelets, platelet adherence to the vessel wall and the formation of a fibrin network. A thrombus that goes on to occlude a blood vessel is known as a thromboembolism. Venous thromboembolism begins with deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which forms in the deep veins of the leg (calf) or pelvis. In some cases, the DVT becomes detached from the vein and is transported to the right-hand side of the heart, and from there to the pulmonary arteries, giving rise to a pulmonary embolism (PE). Certain factors predispose patients toward the development of venous thromboembolism (VTE), including surgery, trauma, hospitalization, immobilization, cancer, long-haul travel, increased age, obesity, major medical illness and previous VTE; in addition, there may also be a genetic component to VTE. VTE is responsible for a substantial number of deaths per annum in Europe. Anticoagulants are the mainstay of both VTE treatment and VTE prevention, and many professional organizations have published guidelines on the appropriate use of anticoagulant therapies for VTE. Treatment of VTE aims to prevent morbidity and mortality associated with the disease, and any long-term complications such as VTE recurrence or post-thrombotic syndrome. Generally, guidelines recommend the use of low molecular weight heparins (LMWH), unfractionated heparin (UFH) or fondaparinux for the pharmacological prevention and treatment of VTE, with the duration of therapy varying according to the baseline characteristics and risk profile of the individual. Despite evidence showing that the use of anticoagulation prevents VTE, the availability of several convenient, effective anticoagulant therapies and the existence of clear guideline recommendations, thromboprophylaxis is underused, particularly in patients not undergoing surgery. Greater adherence to guideline-recommended therapies, such as LMWH, which can be administered on an outpatient basis, should reduce the mortality associated with this preventable disease."

To be effective, VTE prophylaxis must be appropriately prescribed with respect to type, dose and duration. Large-scale studies of medical discharge records have highlighted low rates of appropriate thromboprophylaxis in hospitalized medical patients, especially those with cancer or severe lung disease. Lack of prophylaxis and an insufficient duration are the most common forms of inappropriate prophylaxis. Multifaceted, active, quality improvement initiatives have been developed and shown to successfully increase the appropriate prescribing of VTE prophylaxis in patients at risk. By increasing the use of appropriate VTE prophylaxis in at-risk patients, the disease burden of hospital-acquired VTE and its resulting complications can be reduced."
CD008201,0,24975978,0,[Thromboprophylaxis in outpatients with cancer?].,"Outpatients with cancer have an increased risk of venous thrombosis, especially during chemotherapy. Clinical trials have shown that thromboprophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin reduces the incidence of symptomatic venous thrombosis in these patients. An increase in major bleeding events was suggested but not confirmed in most recent trials. However, as the incidence of venous thrombosis is relatively low in the general cancer population, thromboprophylaxis should not be recommended for all cancer outpatients. Instead, to optimize the risk/benefit ratio, targeted thromboprophylaxis for patients deemed at high risk is recommended. Risk prediction models may be used to identify these high risk patients. Until results of clinical trials based on these models are published, thromboprophylaxis can be considered in patients with advanced or metastatic high risk cancers (e.g. pancreatic and lung cancer) who are receiving chemotherapy and have no increased risk of bleeding. Because of the many uncertainties, the decision to start thromboprophylaxis should always be discussed with the patient."

CD008201,0,22943367,0,Anticoagulants in cancer.,"Cancer patients are at high risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE), which results in substantial morbidity and mortality. In this narrative review, we present evidence for the use of anticoagulants in the treatment and prevention of VTE in cancer patients. The benefit of perioperative anticoagulant prophylaxis following cancer surgery is well established. However, the risk-benefit trade-offs in non-surgical hospitalized cancer patients and among outpatients receiving chemotherapy are more complex. Emerging evidence suggests that the use of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) may confer a small survival benefit in cancer patients without VTE. However, specific patient populations that may derive the most benefit have yet to be defined. Guidelines endorse LMWH as the preferred treatment for acute VTE, on the basis of high-quality clinical trial data, but the optimal duration of treatment remains unclear, and practical issues may limit its use outside the clinical trial setting. Novel oral anticoagulants may provide additional treatment and prophylaxis options, but their efficacy and safety in this population have not been established. Despite the significant impact of VTE on the lives of cancer patients and the large body of existing literature regarding treatment and prevention, important unanswered clinical questions remain, emphasizing the need for additional high-quality clinical trial data."

Women with BPD, PTSD, and recent and/or imminent serious intentional self-injury (n = 13) received one year of DBT with the DBT PE Protocol, plus three months of follow-up assessment. The treatment was associated with significant reductions in PTSD, with the majority of patients no longer meeting criteria for PTSD at post-treatment (71.4% of DBT PE Protocol completers, 60.0% of the intent-to-treat sample). A minority of patients (27.3%) engaged in intentional self-injury during the study. Improvements were also found for suicidal ideation, dissociation, trauma-related guilt cognitions, shame, anxiety, depression, and social adjustment. There was no evidence that the DBT PE Protocol led to exacerbations of intentional self-injury urges or behaviors, PTSD, treatment dropout, or crisis service use. Overall, the results indicate that this integrated BPD and PTSD treatment is feasible to implement within one year of treatment, highly acceptable to patients and therapists, safe to administer, and shows promise as an effective intervention for PTSD in this complex and high-risk patient population."
CD008201,0,18024625,0,Management of Thrombohemorrhagic Syndromes (THS) in hematologic malignancies.,"The rate of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients with acute leukemia or lymphomas is comparable with that of other ""high-risk"" cancer types. Chemotherapy and anti-angiogenic drugs increase the thrombotic risk in patients with lymphomas, acute leukemias and multiple myeloma (MM). Patients with hematologic malignancies often present with a hypercoagulable state or chronic disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) in the absence of active thrombosis and/or bleeding. Malignant cell procoagulant properties, cytotoxic therapies, and concomitant infections are major determinants for clotting activation in hematologic malignancies. In acute leukemia, clinical manifestations range from localized venous or arterial thrombosis to a diffuse, life-threatening thrombohemorrhagic syndrome (THS). All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) has greatly improved the management of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), but has not significantly changed the rate of early hemorrhagic deaths and may actually promote thrombosis. Randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) of different prophylactic regimens to prevent VTE or THS in hematologic malignancies are urgently needed, particularly in patients with lymphoma or MM during chemotherapy and in patients with APL. Anticoagulant therapy is a particular challenge in patients with hematologic malignancies, since these patients are at very high risk for hemorrhage. No guidelines are available for the prophylaxis or treatment of VTE; extrapolations can be made from existing guidelines for management of patients with other malignancies; prolonged periods of treatment-induced thrombocytopenia in patients with hematologic malignancies, however, require a more judicious application of standard anticoagulant approaches. Use of the newer anticoagulants will require careful assessment of hemorrhagic risk in this group of high-risk patients but may be justified under special circumstances."

The incidence of VTD in these patients ranges from 5% to 58% and thromboprophylaxis is considered essential for proper management. Traditionally, pelvic and lower extremity fractures, head injury, and prolonged immobilization have been cited as risk factors for VTD; however, how these factors combine with others to predict high risk is still unclear. The best way to approach VTD prophylaxis in multiple trauma patients is currently unclear. Both mechanical and pharmacologic means are available. The main clinical practice guidelines recommend thromboprophylaxis with low-molecular weight heparin, which can be started 48 hours after trauma, unless patients are still bleeding, in which case mechanical compression is recommended in spite of the limited effectiveness of that measure. Compression is maintained until the risk of hemorrhage has diminished. There is insufficient evidence to support routine use of ultrasound imaging or venography. In patients with head injury who are at risk for intracranial bleeding, the use of low-molecular weight heparin should be delayed until risk disappears but mechanical prophylaxis (compression) can be considered according to clinical status."
CD008201,0,24846226,0,Primary prevention of ischaemic stroke in atrial fibrillation: new oral anticoagulant drugs for all?,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) confers a 4.5% risk of stroke per year. The risk of stroke increases with various risk factors and until recently, warfarin has been the gold standard of thromboembolism prophylaxis in AF for many years. The dosage of warfarin requires regular adjustment dependent on the INR, to keep within a narrow therapeutic range of 2.0- 3.0. The INR can be altered by concomitant drugs, foods and alcohol and requires inconvenient blood monitoring. Underanticoagulation places patients at risk of stroke, whilst over-anticoagulation confers significant bleeding risk. Consequently approximately half who would benefit from oral anticoagulation do not have it prescribed. Novel oral anticoagulants with predictable pharmacokinetics and improved efficacy and safety profiles are currently being developed for stroke prevention in AF. Three novel oral anticoagulants have just completed Phase III trials for stroke prevention, all with impressive results; the direct thrombin inhibitor, dabigatran and the oral factor Xa inhibitors, rivaroxaban and apixaban."

The mean length of bed rest was 13.1 (median 10, range 7 to 31) days; and, the mean length of hospital stay was 21.1 (median 17, range 8 to 72) days. During hospitalization, 2 (6.9%) patients developed one or more of the complications measured, with 1 developing a posterior heel pressure ulcer that resolved with local care and another who developed deep venous thrombosis without pulmonary embolism, managed with therapeutic anticoagulation, and hospital-acquired pneumonia treated with antibiotic therapy. The results of this analysis were favorable in comparison with previously reported incidence rates for pressure ulcer, deep venous thrombosis, and hospital-acquired pulmonary complications in patients with similar risk factors, and suggested that a prescribed bed protocol reduces complications associated with bed rest."
CD008201,0,19533288,0,Perioperative handling of patients on antiplatelet therapy with need for surgery.,"The widespread use of metal stents and drug-eluting stents has shown the extent to which patients with unstable coronary perfusion depend on antiplatelet drugs, and how their risk of late thrombosis depends on the long-term use of agents such as clopidogrel. It has also been shown that the risk of surgical bleeding, if antiplatelet drugs are continued, is lower than that of coronary thrombosis if they are withdrawn. Thus, except for low-risk settings, the practice of withdrawing antiplatelet drugs 5-10 days prior to surgical procedures should be changed. The following suggestions are meant to provide a guideline in this respect. Most of the current surgical procedures may be performed while on low-dose aspirin treatment. Except when bleeding may occur in closed spaces (e.g. intracranial surgery, spinal surgery in the medullary canal, surgery of the posterior chamber of the eye) or where excessive blood loss is expected, where only clopidogrel should be discontinued; in all other cases the surgical procedures should be carried out in the presence of dual antiplatelet agents (if prescribed). Aspirin may be discontinued only in subjects at low risk of thrombosis, and at high risk of intraoperative bleeding. Operations associated with an expected excessive blood loss should be postponed unless vital. When prescribed for acute coronary syndrome or during stent re-endothelialization, clopidogrel should not be discontinued before a noncardiac procedure. For elective procedures, surgery should be postponed until the end of the indication for clopidogrel. After the operation, clopidogrel should be resumed within the 12-24 h. Cardiac procedures should be postponed for at least 4 days after clopidogrel withdrawal. The thrombotic risk of preoperative withdrawal of antiplatelet drugs overwhelms the benefit of regional or neuraxial blockade. Antiplatelet treatment replacement by heparin or low-molecular weight heparin does not provide protection against the risk of coronary artery or stent thrombosis. Haemostasis requires that at least 20% of circulating platelets have a normal function. As the effects of antiplatelet agents are not reversible by other drugs, fresh platelets are the only manner to rapidly restore normal haemostasis. Aprotinin decreases postoperative bleeding and transfusion rates in patients undergoing CABG and on clopidogrel during the days preceding surgery."
CD008201,0,8656640,0,Adhesion of activated platelets to venous endothelial cells is mediated via GPIIb/IIIa.,"Normal circulating platelets do not adhere to intact, undisturbed endothelium. Studies have shown, however, that platelets will adhere to virally infected or thrombin-stimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Using a novel platelet/endothelial cell adhesion assay we studied the interaction of thrombin-activated platelets to human saphenous vein endothelial cells (HSVEC), and its mechanism(s). Biotinylated platelets were exposed to Hepes-Tyrode buffer, 10E5 or PAC-1 [monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) blocking GPIIb-IIIa], AK4 (Mab blocking P-selectin, 6D1 (Mab blocking vWf binding to GPIb), RGDS (small peptide blocking the fibrinogen binding site), or EDTA (dissociates GPIIb-IIIa complex) and then activated with thrombin. The platelets were subsequently exposed to thrombin-stimulated monolayer HSVEC. Phycoerythrin-streptavidin was added to the wells to fluorescently label the platelets, followed by formaldehyde fixation and washing to remove nonadherent platelets. Adhesion of platelets to HSVEC was assessed using a fluorescent multiwell plate reader. Antibodies which blocked the GPIIb-IIIa receptor and agents which competitively bound the receptor all significantly inhibited activated platelet adhesion to the activated HSVEC. We have found that thrombin significantly increases platelet/HSVEC adhesion, and this event is mediated via the integrin GPIIb-IIIa (fibrinogen receptor). These GPIIb-IIIa receptor blocking Mabs and RGDS may be useful adjuncts for improving patency following angiographic intervention and/or vein grafting in patients with high risk of thrombosis. The assay we have developed is a valuable and relatively simple method for assessing platelet/endothelial cell adhesion and activation."
CD008201,0,9157582,0,An evaluation and improvement program for inpatient anticoagulant control.,"To improve the management and therapeutic control of inpatients on anticoagulant drugs, combined prescription and monitoring charts have been developed for both heparin and warfarin which incorporate clinical guidelines. These have been introduced throughout a 700-bedded acute teaching hospital via a structured program of change management. We have demonstrated improvements in the quality of anticoagulant control (assessed with a custom-written computer program), adherence to clinical guidelines and quality of monitoring and prescribing of anticoagulants in inpatients. The percentage time spent under-anticoagulated with heparin (activated partial thromboplastin time ratio < 1.5) fell from 32.7% to 18.5% (p < 0.0001), whereas there was no change in percentage time over-anticoagulated (5.1% vs. 5.8%; p = ns). The percentage time spent under-anticoagulated with warfarin was unaltered (26.3% vs. 29.8%; p = ns) but the percentage time spent over-anticoagulated (International Normalised Ratio > 4.5) was halved from 5.4% to 2.7% (p < 0.001). We conclude that the introduction of the charts led to significant improvements in anticoagulant control."
CD008201,0,20640486,0,Physicians' perceptions of the definition of major bleeding in major orthopedic surgery: results of an international survey.,"Decisions regarding choice of thromboprophylaxis in patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery are based on assessment of individual patient risk for thrombosis versus risk for bleeding. An international survey sought physician views on definitions and relative importance of different types of major bleeding. A random sample of physicians from five countries (100 physicians per country, mainly surgeons) completed an internet-based 13-question survey on perceptions, concerns, and relevance of bleeding associated with thromboprophylaxis in major orthopedic surgery. Over 80% of responders were concerned or very concerned about bleeding with >70% considering surgical-site bleeding as the most concerning, and relevant type and site for bleeding. Nearly 80% of responders considered surgical-site bleeding to increase patient length of hospital stay, and >70% noted that it complicates patient rehabilitation. After fatal bleeding, bleeding leading to re-operation was ranked as the most concerning type of major bleed. Less than half of responders reported closely reading the major-bleeding definitions in clinical study publications. Most responders favored anticoagulants that could offer a reduced bleeding risk and similar venous thromboembolism (VTE) prevention compared to current anticoagulants rather than a decrease in VTE and similar bleeding risk. There is a disconnect between the definitions of major bleeding that surgeons would apply to describe bleeding associated with VTE thromboprophylaxis, and those used in clinical studies reporting the safety profiles of newer anticoagulant agents. Misperceptions about the benefit-to-harm profiles of thromboprophylactic therapies may incorrectly inform treatment choices in patients at high risk for post-operative VTE."

Explicit ASsessment of Thromboembolic RIsk and Prophylaxis for Medical PATients in SwitzErland (ESTIMATE).,"Both, underuse and overuse of thromboprophylaxis in hospitalised medical patients is common. We aimed to explore clinical factors associated with the use of pharmacological or mechanical thromboprophylaxis in acutely ill medical patients at high (Geneva Risk Score ≥ 3 points) vs low (Geneva Risk Score < 3 points) risk of venous thromboembolism. Overall, 1,478 hospitalised medical patients from eight large Swiss hospitals were enrolled in the prospective Explicit ASsessment of Thromboembolic RIsk and Prophylaxis for Medical PATients in SwitzErland (ESTIMATE) cohort study. The study is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01277536. Thromboprophylaxis increased stepwise with increasing Geneva Risk Score (p< 0.001). Among the 962 high-risk patients, 366 (38 %) received no thromboprophylaxis; cancer-associated thrombocytopenia (OR 4.78, 95 % CI 2.75-8.31, p< 0.001), active bleeding on admission (OR 2.88, 95 % CI 1.69-4.92, p< 0.001), and thrombocytopenia without cancer (OR 2.54, 95 % CI 1.31-4.95, p=0.006) were independently associated with the absence of prophylaxis. The use of thromboprophylaxis declined with increasing severity of thrombocytopenia (p=0.001). Among the 516 low-risk patients, 245 (48 %) received thromboprophylaxis; none of the investigated clinical factors predicted its use. In conclusion, in acutely ill medical patients, bleeding and thrombocytopenia were the most important factors for the absence of thromboprophylaxis among high-risk patients. The use of thromboprophylaxis among low-risk patients was inconsistent, without clearly identifiable predictors, and should be addressed in further research."

He underwent an extended left lobectomy and a partial resection of the liver in May 2002. After two weeks from the surgery, he received intra arterial 5-FU infusion chemotherapy combined with subcutaneous interferon-alpha injection to treat the lesions in the residual liver. Four months after the surgery, hepatic vein tumor thrombus appeared in the remnant liver and it extended to the inferior caval vein. And another 4 months later, multiple pulmonary metastases were detected with computed tomography and they grew rapidly in the view of their sizes and numbers. Because the combined therapy of 5-FU/interferon-alpha was not effective to distant metastases, we started a new regimen of oral administration of TS-1 and a subcutaneous interferon-alpha injection. After 1 treatment cool, hepatic vein thrombus was markedly reduced the size and vascularity in the CT. Multiple pulmonary metastases also decreased in their sizes and numbers. No adverse effect was seen during this treatment.

CD008201,0,24043245,0,Evaluation of an enoxaparin dosing calculator using burn size and weight.,"Previous research has shown that inadequate antifactor Xa levels (anti-Xa) occur in burn patients and may increase the risk of venous thromboembolic events (VTE). The objective of this retrospective review was to investigate the usefulness of an enoxaparin dosing algorithm using a previously published equation. With institutional review board approval, all acute burn patients at an American Burn Association-verified regional burn center who were treated with enoxaparin for VTE prophylaxis and had at least one anti-Xa from May 1, 2011 to December 15, 2012 were included. Patients with subprophylactic anti-Xa received increased enoxaparin dose per unit protocol with the goal of obtaining a prophylactic anti-Xa (0.2-0.4 U/ml). Sixty-four patients were included in our analysis. The regression equation was used in 33 patients for initial enoxaparin dosing (Eq) whereas 31 patients received traditionally recommended prophylaxis dosing (No-Eq). Groups were comparable in sex, age, weight, inhalation injury, and burn size. Initial enoxaparin dosing in Eq was significantly more likely to reach target than in No-Eq (73 vs 32%; P = .002). No episodes of hemorrhage, thrombocytopenia, or heparin sensitivity were documented in either group. Median final enoxaparin dose required to reach prophylactic level was 40 mg every 12 hours (range, 30-80 mg). Twenty-one No-Eq patients ultimately reached target, and 11 of these final doses were equivalent to or greater than the predicted equation. Ten patients never reached prophylactic anti-Xa before enoxaparin was discontinued (nine from No-Eq). Two patients, one from each group, developed VTE complications despite appropriate anti-Xa for prophylaxis. A strong correlation was shown between weight, burn size, and enoxaparin dose (r = .68; P < .001). Use of the enoxaparin dosing algorithm significantly increased the frequency of obtaining a target initial anti-Xa. There were no bleeding complications. Enoxaparin dosing correlates to burn size and weight, making a standard dose inappropriate because patient habitus and extent of burn injury are highly variable. This simple equation improves enoxaparin dosing for acute adult burn patients."

Although clopidogrel is well tolerated by most patients, rare but serious hypersensitivity reactions have been documented, including cutaneous reactions and angioedema. An alternative thienopyridine that may be substituted for clopidogrel is ticlopidine; however, deleterious side effects from ticlopidine may occur, including diarrhea, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia purpura, and cross-reactivity has been documented between these two thienopyridines. In cases of bare-metal stent deployment, cilostazol may be a safe and effective alternative; however, limited therapeutic data are available. In such cases, providers may need to administer a clopidogrel desensitization protocol; three clopidogrel desensitization protocols have been published. We describe a 58-year-old man who developed a generalized diffuse rash along his abdomen within 2 weeks of exposure to clopidogrel after drug-eluting stent placement. Clopidogrel was discontinued, and ticlopidine was begun. The rash resolved within 3 days of clopidogrel discontinuation. Using the Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale, we determined that the probability of clopidogrel causing the rash was probable (score of 8). Ticlopidine was subsequently discontinued due to severe diarrhea. Because of the patient's implanted stent and high risk for possible thrombosis, an 8-hour clopidogrel desensitization protocol was devised and successfully used in this patient, who continued to receive clopidogrel over the next year without rash recurrence. Based on our experience and the literature reviewed, administration of a clopidogrel desensitization protocol in patients with a history of isolated cutaneous hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema, to clopidogrel can be a safe therapeutic alternative to ticlopidine or cilostazol."

CD008201,0,20848518,0,Thrombosis and inflammatory bowel disease: a call for improved awareness and prevention.,"Thrombotic complications in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are common and require improved awareness and prevention. In this review the interface between IBD and thrombosis is discussed, with emphasis on risk assessment and data to aid clinical decision making. Thromboembolic complications are 3-fold more likely in IBD patients than controls and the relative risk exceeds 15 during disease flares. Improved assessment of thrombosis risk for an individual patient includes thorough personal and family history and awareness of prothrombotic medications and lifestyle choices. Patients with the highest risk of thrombosis are those with active colonic disease, personal or strong family history of thrombosis, and those with significant acquired risk factors. Combined risk factors or hospitalization should prompt mechanical thromboprophylaxis. Indications for prophylactic anticoagulation are not defined currently by clinical studies, especially in pediatric patients, although some groups now advocate prophylactic anticoagulation for all hospitalized IBD patients and even some outpatients with disease flares. Thrombosis management requires a multidisciplinary therapeutic approach to balance anticoagulation and bleeding risk. While bleeding may occur with anticoagulation in IBD, data and experience indicate that therapeutic heparin is safe and bleeding manifestations can be managed supportively in most patients. Until prospective trials of prophylactic anticoagulation are published, management of thrombotic risk and prophylaxis in IBD will remain a clinical challenge."

To characterize the VTE rate in US surgical patients, and identify real-world independent VTE risk-factors, a national managed-care database was analyzed. 172,320 eligible surgical discharges (23.9% orthopedic, 76.1% abdominal surgery) from the PharMetrics database (January 2001-December 2005) were evaluated. The rate of thromboprophylaxis was low in orthopedic (40.5%) and abdominal (1.8%) surgery discharges, with the event rates of symptomatic VTE in these groups being 4.7% and 3.1%, respectively. The median time to VTE was 51 days: the majority of VTE events occurred post-discharge. Independent predictors of VTE included prior VTE (odds ratio [OR] 10.2; 95% CI: 9.2-11.4), and orthopedic versus abdominal surgery (OR 1.4; 95% CI: 1.4-1.6).

CD008201,0,15199515,0,Prevention of venous thromboembolism in high-risk surgical and medical patients.,"Although pharmacologic prophylaxis against venous thromboembolism has become the standard of care following total hip and knee replacement, prophylaxis among patients undergoing surgery for hip fracture and other lower extremity trauma remains underutilized. Available experience consistently supports the view that low-molecular-weight heparins are more effective than unfractionated heparin for prevention of proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) with no additional hemorrhagic risk and more effective than oral anticoagulants for prevention of in-hospital (mostly distal) venous thrombosis at the price of a higher surgical site bleeding and wound hematoma. The choice between low-molecular-weight heparin and warfarin should be tailored to the individual patients based on the clinical assessment of postoperative thrombosis and bleeding risk as well as the prophylaxis-specific cost and convenience. Whether thromboprophylaxis should be continued for a few additional weeks after hospital discharge is controversial. The overall incidence of postoperative DVT in patients with cancer is about twice as high as that of patients free of malignancy. Accordingly, they require prophylactic measures comparable with those usually recommended for major orthopedic surgery. In this setting, dermatan sulfate shows promise. In contrast to surgical patients, prevention of venous thromboembolism is less well studied in hospitalized medical patients. In a recent controlled randomized trial, enoxaparin in high prophylactic doses was an effective and safe measure of thromboprophylaxis in ordinary bedridden patients."
CD008201,0,15630494,0,Mortality rates and risk factors for asymptomatic deep vein thrombosis in medical patients.,"The clinical importance of asymptomatic proximal and distal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) remains uncertain and controversial. The aim of this retrospective, post-hoc analysis was to examine mortality and risk factors for development of proximal DVT in hospitalized patients with acute medical illness who were recruited into a randomized, prospective clinical trial of thromboprophylaxis with dalteparin (PREVENT). We analyzed 1738 patients who had not sustained a symptomatic venous thromboembolic event by Day 21 and who had a complete compression ultrasound of the proximal and distal leg veins on Day 21. We examined the 90-day mortality rates in patients with asymptomatic proximal DVT (Group I, N=80), asymptomatic distal DVT (Group II, N=118) or no DVT (Group III, N=1540). The 90-day mortality rates were 13.75%, 3.39%, and 1.92% for Groups I-III, respectively. The difference in mortality between Group I and Group III was significant (hazard ratio 7.63, 95% CI=3.8-15.3; p <0.0001), whereas the difference between Groups II and III did not reach significance (hazard ratio 1.36, 95% CI=0.41-4.45). The association of asymptomatic proximal DVT with increased mortality remained highly significant after adjusting for differences in baseline demographics and clinical variables. Risk factors significantly associated with the development of proximal DVT included advanced age (p=0.0005), prior DVT (p=0.001), and varicose veins (p=0.04). In conclusion, the high mortality rate in patients with asymptomatic proximal DVT underscores its clinical relevance and supports targeting of asymptomatic proximal DVT as an appropriate endpoint in clinical trials of thromboprophylaxis."
CD008201,0,25083201,0,A review of the safety of anticoagulants in older people using the medicines management pathway: weighing the benefits against the risks.,"Anticoagulant drugs maintain a high potential for adverse events due to their inherent risk of haemorrhage and/or complex pharmacology. In addition, compromising the safety of these agents is the context in which they are principally used; that is, in the long-term prevention of thromboembolic diseases in an older patient population. These challenges are especially pronounced in the prevention of stroke in older persons with atrial fibrillation (AF), where the need for thromboprophylaxis is paramount and in whom the arrhythmia is most prevalent, but where the target population is simultaneously at high risk of adverse drug events. Essentially, this translates to the use of high-risk therapies on an indefinite basis, in persons who have multiple comorbidities, use polypharmacy, and who may have age-related functional and cognitive decline, culminating in a higher potential for medication misadventure. For this reason, anticoagulants mandate extra pharmacovigilance, and therefore the aim of this review is to address some of the key safety considerations in the use of anticoagulant drugs (warfarin, dabigatran, rivaroxaban), spanning the initiation of therapy to its ongoing management. Using the Medication Management Pathway (MMP) as a framework, in this review we canvas and highlight specific developments in practical strategies to facilitate the safe use of anticoagulants (particularly warfarin) in 'at-risk' elderly patients including: comprehensive risk/benefit assessment using novel risk stratification tools; focused medicines review services; therapeutic drug monitoring services delivered in the primary care setting; and practical education strategies and resources targeting the older patient population. Until newer alternative anticoagulants become viable options for widespread use, clinicians will necessarily need to rely on specific resources and interventions to facilitate the safe use of currently available anticoagulants (i.e. warfarin) in 'at-risk' older people."

CD008201,0,23615656,0,Long-term treatment of deep-vein thrombosis with low-molecular-weight heparin: an update of the evidence.,"This article reviews updated evidence-based knowledge on long-term treatment of deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) or vitamin K antagonists (VKAs). Eleven trials were identified comparing the two treatments in a broad spectrum of patients with DVT and with >100 study participants. Four comparative trials were identified in patients with cancer and DVT (in whom anticoagulation treatment is more complex and bleeding complications more frequent). In the 11 trials in broad patient populations, LMWHs were as effective as VKAs in preventing recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE), and there were no consistent differences in the incidence of bleeding complications during long-term treatment. In patients with cancer, VTE recurrence was significantly reduced with LMWH versus VKA in two studies, while major bleeding complications did not differ between groups in any of the four trials. Current evidence-based European and American guidelines recommend LMWH over VKA for the long-term treatment of DVT in patients with cancer. LMWH and VKA are recommended over the new oral anticoagulant drugs, for which there are limited data on use in long-term treatment. Post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS), a common complication of DVT, causes considerable morbidity. Long-term use of tinzaparin reduced the risk of PTS compared with VKA in one trial, and a meta-analysis of nine studies in total demonstrated a consistently favourable effect of LMWHs versus VKA on PTS-related outcomes. Given the limited treatment options available for PTS, this suggests that LMWHs provide a useful therapeutic option in any patient particularly at risk of developing PTS."

CD008201,0,22767274,0,[Heparin as bridging anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy during the perioperative period].,"Anticoagulant and antiplatelet medications are commonly used for the treatment and prevention of cardiovascular diseases. We studied 84 patients who received heparin as a bridging anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy during the perioperative period. Hospitalization was extended for adjusting anticoagulant and antiplatelet drugs and also bleeding complications in the perioperative period. There were 25 instances of bleeding complications (29.7%) in this study. These complications mainly occurred when anticoagulant and antiplatelet medications were restarted in the postoperative period. In transurethral surgery, patients taking warfarin and antiplatelet drugs (aspirin or ticlopidine) had a statistically significant increase in bleeding complications compared to patients taking warfarin alone. We compared 51 cases of transurethral resection of bladder tumor, transurethral resection of the prostate holium laser enucleation of the prostate, nephroureterectomy and percutaneous nephrolithotomy with heparinization were compared to 692 cases with no heparinization. The heparinization group had a statistically significant longer hospitalization period and an increase in bleeding complications. There was one instance of thromboembolism (1.2%) in our series. This involved stent thrombosis of a patient who had drug-eluting stent in the left anterior descending coronary artery. She died three days postoperatively. The number of patients taking anticoagulant and/or antiplatelet drugs is predicted to increase in the future due to aging of the population. Guidelines for the management of anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy in the urological period are considered necessary."

CD008201,0,23866080,0,Rivaroxaban and other non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants in the emergency treatment of thromboembolism.,"Pulmonary embolism (PE) is potentially fatal and often requires emergency management. Because PE associated with shock and/or hypotension carries a high risk of sudden death, emergency clinicians must rapidly make a diagnosis and initiate appropriate therapeutic strategies, usually involving anticoagulant treatment. Traditional anticoagulants, such as heparins and vitamin K antagonists, although effective and recommended by guidelines, are associated with limitations. Several targeted, orally administered anticoagulants that may overcome some of these constraints have been developed recently and undergone analysis in randomised, phase III clinical trials. Rivaroxaban, a direct factor Xa inhibitor, was non-inferior to standard therapy with enoxaparin plus a vitamin K antagonist for the prevention of recurrent, symptomatic venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients with acute PE and led to a 50% reduction in major bleeding. Dabigatran, a direct thrombin inhibitor, was also non-inferior to standard therapy for the prevention of recurrent VTE or VTE-related death when given after a parenteral anticoagulant and had a similar incidence of major bleeding. The results of a phase III study of apixaban, another direct factor Xa inhibitor, for the acute treatment of VTE are expected in the near future. Rivaroxaban is now approved in Europe and the US for the treatment of acute PE and prevention of recurrent VTE. This article reviews the current guidance on the treatment of PE with special focus on the emergency setting, and considers data regarding rivaroxaban and the other non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants and their potential role, including patients who are and are not appropriate for treatment with these agents. Issues such as drug interactions, reversal of anticoagulant effect and coagulation monitoring are also discussed."
CD008201,0,22634472,0,Is there a suitable method of anticoagulation in pregnant patients with mechanical prosthetic heart valves?,"A best evidence topic was written according to a structured protocol in order to identify the mode of anticoagulation that has the best safety profile for both the mother and the foetus in pregnant patients with mechanical prosthetic heart valves. A total of 281 papers were identified using the reported search, of which eight represented the best evidence to answer the clinical question. The authors, date, journal, study type, population, main outcome measures and results are tabulated. The reported measures were foetal mortality, maternal mortality, congenital abnormalities and embryopathy, and maternal thromboembolic and haemorrhagic complications. The medical orthodoxy has warned of the combination of oral anticoagulation and pregnancy due to the well-documented warfarin embryopathy. Yet only one of the reported papers identified a greater incidence of foetal aberrations among warfarin use, with the highest reported rate being 6.4% and two of the assessed papers reporting no embryopathy at all. Foetal mortality with oral anticoagulation use ranged from 1.52 to 76%. All reported publications demonstrated a superior maternal outcome with warfarin use, with a range of thromboembolic events from 0 to 10% in comparison with 4 to 48% where heparin was used. Thus, it is concluded that warfarin is a more durable anticoagulant with a better maternal outcome despite it carrying a greater foetal risk. Although, in contrast to previous teaching, the risks of embryopathy are not the major drawback of oral anticoagulation. Heparin is consistently less effective, but may be preferred for the superior foetal outcome. Heparin usage during the first trimester reduces the foetal risk but is still associated with an adverse maternal outcome. While the focus for clinicians looking after pregnant women with mechanical heart valves may be to prevent maternal thromboembolic complications, the overriding concern for many women is to avoid any harm to their unborn child, even when this places their health at risk. Thus women with mechanical heart valves must be fully informed of the risks involved with different anticoagulation for an informed decision to be made."

CD008201,0,24748012,0,Clinical models and biochemical predictors of VTE in lung cancer.,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a frequent complication of lung cancer and its treatment, especially in the advanced stages of disease. The risk of a pro-thrombotic state might increase through the activation of hemostasis, occurring both via the induction of a pro-coagulant activity and with platelet involvement, ultimately leading to the development of metastases. Despite the acknowledgement of an increased thrombophilic condition in cancer patients, and the experimental evidence that heparin compounds may have direct anticancer benefits, there is no univocal consent regarding VTE prevention in cancer outpatients receiving therapy. Thus, many authors highlighted the need for the development of stratification techniques to identify at-risk patients who might benefit from thromboprophylaxis. Clinical risk models were developed and validated, in order to assign high-risk patients to a proper thromboprophylaxis regimen that, however, might not be justified in all clusters. Besides, efforts have been devoted to identify candidate biomarkers that may be used in VTE risk assessment, although none has been recognized, so far, as a predictor for VTE in lung cancer patients. In this review, we will summarize the latest information concerning this very controversial topic, with focus on some of the proposed strategies to select the appropriate patients for prophylaxis."

Patients followed in this controlled environment had an average medication possession ratio (MPR) greater than 0.95. However, very few studies have evaluated patient adherence to dabigatran in a real-world setting. Other studies of chronic medications indicate patients are not reliably adherent to twice daily regimens. Adherence to therapy is particularly important for direct thrombin inhibitors because there may be a risk of increased thromboembolic events associated with poor adherence to these agents. "
CD008201,0,12774565,0,Pharmaceutical care: pharmacy involvement in prescribing in an acute-care hospital.,"[corrected] Pharmaceutical care implies reaching a consensus with physicians on prescriptions in cases that call for the substitution of one active ingredient for another, a modification in dose, frequency, route of administration, etc., through the unit-dose distribution system. The goal of pharmacist interventions in the hospital should be to achieve a rational use of drugs; to ensure this, a daily review of patient prescriptions by a pharmacist is necessary. Most of the incidence of drug-related morbidity and mortality is predictable and can be avoided, thus reducing the overall cost of health care and the duration of hospitalization while improving the quality of care. The optimum quality of physician or pharmacist care to be achieved would be one that which maximizes benefits and minimizes risks and costs."
CD008201,0,22383321,0,Mortality and morbidity following hip fractures related to hospital thromboprophylaxis policy.,"Chemical thromboprophylaxis has been shown to reduce the incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) for patients with fractures of the hip, but it is not known with certainty whether it use also reduces mortality. Using postal and telephone questionnaires we collected data from English National Health Service (NHS) hospitals about their thromboprophylaxis policy for hip fractures patients from April 2003 to April 2007. Using Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) we ascertained in-hospital mortality rates at 30 days and at one year following admission to hospital. Unplanned hospital readmission rates for all causes (including episodes of thromboembolism and bleeding) within 30 days (all years) and one year (2003 to 2005) were also established. A total of 150 hospitals were contacted and data gathered from 62 hospitals (response rate 41.3%) There were 255841 patients with neck of femur fractures during this five year period who were assessed for morbidity and mortality, and we correlat these with thromboprophylaxis policy. There was no significant difference in hospital readmission within 30 days, or diagnosis of thromboembolism or haemorrhage among hospitals with different thromboprophylaxis policies. The hospitals using low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) in half the dose recommended by the British National Formulary had significantly reduced mortality in-hospital (odds ratio (OR) 0.79, 95% CI 0.69-0.90, P=0.0006), at 30 days (OR 0.8 (0.70 - 0.92), P=0.001) and at one year (OR 0.89 (0.80 - 1.00), P=0.050), compared with those with no such policy. Our data suggest that the thromboprophylaxis regimen for patients with fracture neck of femur should be half dose LMWH for the duration of the hospital stay."

CD008201,0,16006092,0,[Prophylaxis of thromboembolic events during urologic surgery].,"Few scientific evidences are available in the literature, and the methodologic quality of the studies is often under average. Nevertheless, the conclusions are the following. Nephrectomy, renal transplantation, open surgery of the lower urinary tract and lumbar or pelvic lymph nodes dissection are at high risk for thromboembolic events. Other open or endoscopic urological procedures are at low risk. The laparoscopic approach doesn't change the risk associated with the procedure itself. Thromboprophylaxis is recommended in high-risk procedures. There was no evidence to recommend starting the prophylaxis before more than after the procedure. The use of low molecular weight heparin is recommended for prophylaxis. It can be associated with compressive stockings. It is recommended to treat for around seven days after the procedure. In case of cancer surgery, prophylaxis could be needed for four to six weeks."
CD008201,0,22505957,0,The Risk-based Treatment of Acute Pulmonary Embolism.,"Risk evaluation and prognostic stratification based upon clinical and radiological findings and new cardiac biomarkers, such as natriuretic peptides (NP) and troponins, represent key points in modern management of acute pulmonary embolism (PE). Literature evidence shows that normotensive PE with right heart dysfunction (RHD), defined as submassive PE, has poorer prognosis when compared to normotensive PE without RHD, defined as non-massive PE; thus whether submassive PE should be managed more aggressively and with closer monitoring represents the crucial question about acute PE treatment. Although the answer is yet unclear, the most recent guidelines address to thrombolysis as treatment choice in selected high risk patients with submassive PE. Guidelines also clarify the indications for unfractioned and low molecular weight heparins and fondaparinux. Therefore, in the present article, the authors focus on modern risk-based therapeutic guidelines of acute PE."
CD008201,0,21504325,0,The impact of thromboprophylaxis on cancer survival: focus on pancreatic cancer.,"Pancreatic cancer is still a clinical challenge due to its predominantly late diagnosis and the chemoresistance to cytotoxic and target drugs. One of the major complications of pancreatic cancer is venous thromboembolism (VTE). Both ambulatory and hospitalized pancreatic cancer patients are at higher risk of developing VTE. Among patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer, the occurrence of VTE may be associated with a poor prognosis. Furthermore, emerging clinical data strongly suggest that anticoagulant treatment may improve patient survival by decreasing thromboembolic complications as well as by anticancer activity. Given the clinical relevance for both physicians and basic scientists, this article focuses on the experimental and clinical evidence supporting the relation between the coagulation cascade and the invasive and metastatic potential of pancreatic cancer, and suggests that anticoagulant therapy may represent a useful strategy to improve the prognosis of pancreatic cancer patients."

CD008201,0,25991380,0,Venous thromboembolism: patient awareness and education in the pre-operative assessment clinic.,"Each year venous thromboembolism (VTE) causes up to 60,000 deaths in the UK, many resulting from hospital-acquired thromboses following elective surgery. National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines state that all elective surgical patients should receive verbal and written information pre-operatively regarding the risks of developing VTE. This audit assessed elective surgical patient's prior awareness of VTE and examined how effective targeted patient education during the pre-operative assessment is in increasing this awareness. A 13 point questionnaire designed to assess a pre-operative patient's understanding of topics relating to VTE was provided to consecutive patients identified as being at risk of developing VTE at the end of their pre-operative assessment over a two-week period. A total of 68 questionnaires were completed. Provision of verbal and written information was poor (47 %, n = 32 and 47 %, n = 32 respectively). Despite this, 71 % (n = 48) of patients were aware of the consequences of developing VTE. Many patients correctly identified surgery (71 %, n = 48), immobility (71 %, n = 48) and being overweight (68 %, n = 46) as risk factors, but not dehydration (47 %, n = 32). Lack of awareness regarding personal methods to reduce the risk of developing a VTE post-operatively (24 %, n = 16) and potential side-effects of medical prophylaxis (32 %, n = 22) were also identified. Many patients already possess an awareness of VTE, however, specific knowledge regarding its risk factors and methods of prevention is lacking. Provision of targeted written and verbal educational information during the pre-operative assessment is an effective method of increasing a patient's awareness of these topics. Increased patient awareness may empower patients in their post-operative recovery and enable them to make more informed decisions regarding VTE prophylaxis options."

CD008201,0,24871533,0,Who might benefit from early aspirin after coronary artery surgery?,"A best evidence topic in cardiac surgery was written according to a structured protocol. The question addressed was whether early administration of aspirin might optimize vein graft patency. More than 250 papers were found using the reported search, of which 4 new papers in addition to the previous 7 represented the best evidence to answer the clinical question. The authors, journal, date and country of publication, patient group studied, study type, relevant outcomes and results of these papers are tabulated. Early postoperative aspirin administered within 6 h following coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) has been shown to be optimal for prevention of vein graft occlusion. Early aspirin has significant benefit in reducing vein graft occlusion, mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, renal failure and bowel infarction. The efficacy of early postoperative aspirin on vein graft patency diminishes the later it is administered. It has optimal benefit at 6 h, some benefit at 24 h and no benefit after 48 h post CABG. ACC/AHA, EACTS and ACCP have issued guidelines recommending administration of early aspirin or an alternative (clopidogrel, ticlopidine and indobufen) at 6 h or soon after bleeding has settled as the standard of care for optimization of vein graft patency. The ACCP guideline has also suggested that optimal prevention of cardiovascular complication should have higher value than prevention of postoperative bleeding. Several randomized, controlled studies, including a meta-analysis, have shown that early administration of aspirin following CABG is not associated with increased blood loss or transfusion requirement. Postoperative bleeding has been identified as a significant reason for non administration of early aspirin in a prospective study. It is essential to define/quantify the postoperative blood loss that precludes administration of early aspirin. This will enhance prompt administration in some cases and guide judgement, especially in patients with high-risk factors for vein graft thrombosis. Administration at 6 h is the optimal time to give aspirin as long as bleeding has settled."

CD008201,0,11772313,0,Critical appraisal of current antithrombotic trials in patients undergoing total hip replacement.,"Patients undergoing total hip replacement are at high risk of developing venous thromboembolism. The 6th ACCP Consensus Conference on Antithrombotic Therapy identified two effective prophylactic methods; low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) and oral anticoagulants. However, two key issues remain controversial. The relative efficacy and safety of prophylaxis initiated pre operatively and post operatively and the optimum duration of prophylaxis. Clinical practice has diverged in North America and Europe as to the appropriate time to administer prophylaxis. This treatment is given pre-operatively in Europe and post-operatively in North America. A number of recent studies have demonstrated that an effective antithrombotic agent administered either immediately before or after surgery may be more effective than current practice. The use of LMWH for extended thromboprophylaxis is supported by convincing data. Clinical trials have demonstrated a significant benefit of pentasaccharide in the prevention of venous thromboembolism in major orthopaedic surgery. A direct thrombin inhibitor given sc. followed by oral administration was found to be as effective and safe as LMWH for the prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) following major hip or knee surgery."

CD008201,0,14641793,0,Do anticoagulants improve survival in patients presenting with venous thromboembolism?,"Anticoagulants have been available since around 1940 and have become the standard of treatment for venous thromboembolism (VTE) for over four decades. However, as with other treatments which became established before the evidence-based era, there is a paucity of evidence from randomized controlled trials validating their effectiveness in preventing the most feared complication of VTE, recurrent fatal pulmonary embolism (PE). Only two such trials have been performed, the results of which conflict. The bulk of data supporting their use are derived from three sources. First, studies of thromboprophylaxis, and comparisons of shorter and longer courses of anticoagulants in high-risk patients with established VTE have clearly demonstrated their effectiveness in primary and late secondary prevention. Given that heparin has an immediate onset of action, anticoagulants should therefore also be effective in early secondary prevention, the proposed mechanism of action in the acute treatment of VTE. Secondly, studies of inadequately treated patients have consistently shown higher recurrence rates than in those adequately treated. Finally, comparisons of outcomes in untreated and treated historical series, and of untreated historical series to treated series in the modern era have shown substantially lower rates of fatal PE in anticoagulated patients. Because these differences are so marked, harmonize with our current understanding of the mechanism of action of anticoagulants and are supported by other evidence, it is much more likely that they at least partly reflect the effectiveness of anticoagulants as opposed to being explicable purely in terms of accumulated biases and a changing distribution of disease severity."

Despite prophylaxis by heparins, VTE occurs in a substantial number of ATSCI patients without an obvious explanation. In this matched case-control study we examined whether thrombophilia and other risk factors are associated with failure of thromboprophylaxis. Cases and controls receiving heparin thromboprophylaxis were selected from consecutively admitted ATSCI patients. Patients who developed a new, objectively confirmed, symptomatic VTE despite prophylaxis at hospital were matched by gender, age, level and mechanism of ATSCI with 2-3 controls without VTE. Patients were interviewed about VTE risk factors and tested for factor V Leiden (FVL), prothrombin G20210A (PT), methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase C677T homozygosity (MTHFR), lupus anticoagulant, homocysteine (Hcy) and plasma factor VIII (FVIII) levels. Twenty-two patients with new VTE episodes and 64 controls were ascertained. The total number of gene alterations for MTHFR, FVL and PT or elevated levels of Hcy or FVIII was significantly more common in patients compared to controls (82% vs. 48%, p=0.006).

Our objective was to estimate the number of US acute-care hospital inpatients who were at risk for VTE according to criteria established by the Seventh American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) Consensus Conference on Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy guidelines for VTE prevention. Using the 2003 Nationwide Inpatient Sample from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP), patient diagnoses and procedures were examined to identify major surgery patients (age > or = 18 years, length of hospital stay > or = 2 days) and medical patients (age > or = 40 years, length of hospital stay > or = 2 days). ACCP guidelines were used to estimate the number of surgical and medical patients at risk of developing VTE. Of an estimated 38,220,659 discharges in 2003, 7,786,390 (20%) were surgical inpatients; 44% of which were at low risk for VTE, while 15%, 24%, and 17% were at moderate, high, and very high risk for VTE, respectively. Of the remaining 15,161,586 medical patients, 7,742,419 (51%) met ACCP VTE risk criteria. Over 12 million patients, comprising 31% of US hospital discharges in 2003, were at risk of VTE.

The lack of a validated VTE risk assessment model, difficulty integrating VTE risk assessment and prevention protocols into the routine process of care, and the lack of standardized metrics for VTE prophylaxis have all been barriers. Recently, a VTE risk assessment/prevention protocol has been validated, leading to portable strategies achieving breakthrough levels of adequate prophylaxis in a variety of inpatient settings. VTE prevention protocol design and implementation strategies have been collected in implementation guides available from the Society of Hospital Medicine and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. These guides were the centerpieces of national collaborative efforts to improve VTE involving over 150 medical centers, honing the approach to accelerate improvement described in this article. Embedding a VTE prevention protocol into admission, transfer, and perioperative order sets is a key strategy. A VTE prevention protocol is defined as a VTE risk assessment with no more than three levels of risk, tightly linked to recommended prophylaxis for each level. A balance between the need to provide protocol guidance and the need for efficiency and ease-of-use by the clinician must be maintained. The power of this protocol driven approach is bolstered by a quality improvement framework, multidisciplinary teams, ongoing monitoring of the process, and real time identification and mitigation of non-adherents via a technique that measures progress and prompts concurrent intervention, an approach we call ""measure-vention."""

In the first part of the study 400 subjects at low-medium risk for DVT were contacted; 28 were excluded for several nonmedical problems; 372 were randomized into 2 groups to evaluate prophylaxis with stockings in 7-8-hour flights; the control group had no prophylaxis. Below-knee, Scholl, Flight Socks, producing 14-17 mm Hg of pressure at the ankle, were used in the treatment group. The occurrence of DVT was evaluated with high-resolution ultrasound scanning (femoral, popliteal, and tibial veins). Edema was assessed with a composite score based on parametric and nonparametric measurements. Part II: In this part of the study 285 subjects at low-medium risk for DVT were included and randomized into 2 groups to evaluate edema prophylaxis in 11-12-hour flights; the controls had no prophylaxis while the prevention group had below-knee, Scholl, Flight Socks (comparable to part I)."

CD008201,0,16596809,0,ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists.,"The biological actions of angiotensin II (ANG), the most prominent hormone of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), may promote the development of atherosclerosis in many ways. ANG aggravates hypertension, metabolic syndrome, and endothelial dysfunction, and thereby constitutes a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The formation of atherosclerotic lesions involves local uptake, synthesis and oxidation of lipids, inflammation, as well as cellular migration and proliferation--mechanisms that may all be enhanced by ANG via its AT1 receptor. ANG may also increase the risk of acute thrombosis by destabilizing atherosclerotic plaques and enhancing the activity of thrombocytes and coagulation. After myocardial infarction, ANG promotes myocardial remodeling and fibrosis, and its many pathological mechanisms deteriorate the prognosis of these high-risk patients in particular. Therapeutically, inhibitors of the angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACEI) and AT1 receptor blockers (ARB) are available to suppress the generation and cellular signaling of ANG, respectively. Despite major differences in the efficacy of ANG suppression and the modulation of other hormones and receptors, both classes of drugs are generally effective in attenuating numerous pathomechanisms of ANG in vitro, and in diminishing the development of atherosclerotic lesions and restenosis after angioplasty in various animal models. In clinical therapy, ACEI and ACE are well-tolerated antihypertensive drugs that also improve the prognosis of heart failure patients. After myocardial infarction and in stable coronary heart disease, ACEI have been shown to reduce mortality in a manner independent of hemodynamic alterations. However, there is little evidence that inhibitors of the RAAS may be effective against arterial restenosis, and a possible benefit of these substances compared to other antihypertensive drugs in the primary prevention of coronary heart disease in hypertensive patients is still a matter of debate, possibly depending on the specific substance and condition being investigated. As such, the general clinical efficacy of ACEI and ARB may be due to a positive influence on hemodynamic load, vascular function, myocardial remodeling, and neuro-humoral regulation, rather than to a direct attenuation of the atherosclerotic process. Further therapeutic advances may be achieved by identifying optimum drugs, patient populations, and treatment protocols."
CD008201,0,15995432,0,Thromboembolic disease prophylaxis in total hip arthroplasty.,"We sought to determine if using aspirin and exercise as prophylaxis against thromboembolic disease in patients having total hip arthroplasties would provide results as effective as or better than those reported in the literature using other chemical agents. One thousand eight hundred thirty-five total hip arthroplasties were done in 1585 patients using a posterior approach. Surgery was done with the patient under general anesthesia in 459 instances and regional anesthesia in 1376 instances. Graduated elastic stockings were used in 1117 instances and intermittent compression stockings were used in 718 instances. Passive exercises of the major joints of the operated extremity were done intraoperatively, and active exercises were done postoperatively. Patients received a suppository containing 10 grains of aspirin immediately after surgery and 325 mg twice a day for the length of their hospitalization. Fatal pulmonary embolism developed after two (0.10%) surgical procedures. Nonfatal pulmonary embolisms were diagnosed in 17 (0.9%) patients, and deep venous thrombosis was diagnosed in 17 (0.9%) patients. The low incidence of thromboembolic complications recorded in this series suggests that our postoperative protocol, including 325 mg of aspirin twice a day during hospitalization and exercise, is an effective and inexpensive method of prophylaxis after total hip arthroplasty."

Although largely a preventable complication, VTE develops in a significant proportion of patients, highlighting the need for improved methods of VTE prevention. Current thromboprophylactic options are limited by unpredictable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (vitamin K antagonists), parenteral/subcutaneous administration (heparin and low-molecular-weight heparins), complicated dosing, and increased risk of bleeding.Rivaroxaban is an oral, direct Factor Xa inhibitor that has recently received marketing authorization in the United States for prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis in patients undergoing hip or knee replacement surgery. The clinical pharmacology of rivaroxaban supports a convenient, oral, once-daily dosing regimen without the need for routine coagulation monitoring after THA or TKA. A comprehensive phase II and III study program supports its safety and efficacy for VTE prevention after THA or TKA. Phase III results have demonstrated the superior efficacy of rivaroxaban regimens compared with enoxaparin regimens, with similar rates of major bleeding. This article provides an overview of the phase II and III results that support the use of this agent for the prevention of VTE after elective total hip or knee replacement."
CD008201,0,20671309,0,An update on contraindications for lung function testing.,"Guidelines on contraindications for lung function tests have been based on expert opinion from >30 years ago. High-risk contraindications to lung function testing are associated with cardiovascular complications such as myocardial infarct, pulmonary embolism or ascending aortic aneurysm. Slightly less risky but still serious contraindications are predominantly centred on recovery from major thoracic, abdominal or head surgery. Less serious surgical procedures will present a possible risk, but the RR depends upon whether the lung function is essential or can wait until the patient's condition improves. In recent decades there have been moves towards less invasive surgical techniques, keyhole surgery and new technology such as laser surgery which minimise the amount of collateral damage to surrounding tissues. In thoracic surgery there is a shift in emphasis to quicker postsurgical mobility. Furthermore there has been little analysis of the scientific facts behind the current recommendations and contraindications. The principle absolute and relative contraindications are in need of revision, and recommended times of abstaining from lung function tests needs to be reviewed. This review aims to outline the key issues and suggests newer recommendations for contraindications for performing lung function using a risk matrix, as well as offering alternative approaches to testing patients who may be at risk of complication from testing. In general, the previous recommendation of waiting for 6 weeks after surgical procedures or medical complications before performing lung function can often now be reduced to <3 weeks with modern less invasive surgical techniques."
CD008201,0,17174213,0,[Thrombosis of a cardiopulmonary bypass circuit despite recommended hypocoagulation with danaparoid during the acute phase of type II heparin-induced thrombocytopenia].,"A 36-year-old patient was admitted to our hospital with ischaemic stroke. The initial assessment allowed the diagnosis of an antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) and an intracardiac mass suggestive of a heart tumour. The patient was treated with unfractionated heparin. Type II heparin-induced thrombopenia (HIT) was diagnosed on the 18th day of therapy. Given the risk of stroke recurrence it was decided to remove the cardiac tumour surgically. Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) was performed using danaparoid in a state of deep hypothermia, in accordance with the well-established protocol in use in our department. As the CPB and surgical procedure came to an end a massive thrombus began forming in the circuit, requiring immediate displacement of the CPB cannulae. The anti-Xa activity level obtained had been considered effective at an estimated 1.20 IU/ml, although, the level recommended by Magnani is between 1.50 and 2.0 IU/ml. There was no clinical consequence and postoperative recovery was uneventful. The discrepancy between the satisfactory level of anti-Xa activity and the thrombus formation in the CPB circuit raises the issue of the diversity of published anticoagulation protocols, the difficulty to extrapolate within a surgical team, the need for intensive laboratory monitoring within a narrow therapeutic range, as well as the patient profiles variability with concurrent disorders complicating their clinical management."

Trauma patients are at high risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The incidence varies according to the method used to measure the DVT and the location of the thrombosis. Due to prolonged rest and coagulation abnormalities, trauma patients are at increased risk of thrombus formation. Thromboprohylaxis, either mechanical or pharmacological, may decrease mortality and morbidity in trauma patients who survive beyond the first day in hospital, by decreasing the risk of VTE in this population.A previous systematic review did not find evidence of effectiveness for either pharmacological or mechanical interventions.

CD008201,0,12232529,0,[Risk of hemorrhage with oral anticoagulants for deep vein thrombosis].,"Despite standardized tests (PT-INR) and better definition of therapeutic objectives, oral anticoagulation still leads to a significant number of hemorrhagic events. The risk is higher during the initial phase of treatment and for arterial indications, but must also be considered for other situations, including deep vein thrombosis, where the risk is less well defined. This risk can now be quantified on the basis of recent data used to identify at risk populations. The risk scores account for age, gender, associated cancer, weight, history of digestive tract bleeding or stroke, and comorbidity (recent myocardial infarction, hematocrit<30%, serum creatinine > 15 mg/l, diabetes). A high score is associated with higher risk of hemorrhagic events. Besides the patient's clinical status, the risk of hemorrhage is related to compliance, the level of anticoagulation, and drug interactions. Specialized monitoring centers provide a means of reducing the risk of morbidity and mortality. New anticoagulation agents must be developed to reduce the risk of hemorrhage which remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality, particularly in the elderly and patients at risk."
CD008201,0,9926877,0,Echocardiographic evidence of aortopulmonary collaterals in premature infants after closure of ductus arteriosus.,"Aortopulmonary collaterals occur in a variety of congenital heart diseases, in chronic pulmonary infection and abscesses, in association with lung tumors, and after multiple pulmonary emboli. In patients with congenital cyanotic heart disease aortopulmonary collaterals mainly occur in conditions with reduced pulmonary blood flow. We investigated 12 preterm low-birth-weight infants, gestational age 29.3+/-3.3 weeks, with respiratory failure who suffered from moderate to severe chronic lung disease after a period of mechanical ventilation. All patients developed aortopulmonary collaterals after closure of a patent ductus arteriosus. Aortopulmonary collaterals could be displayed clearly by color Doppler echocardiography and originated mainly from the descending aorta or the aortic arch. Hypoxic and hypercapnic episodes favored the development of aortopulmonary collaterals, which disappeared after pulmonary hemodynamics and respiratory function had improved. In only one patient coiling of a large col lateral vessel had to be performed. Systemic-to-pulmonary collateral vessels potentially aggravate chronic lung disease by increasing collateral pulmonary blood flow and reducing lung compliance. We conclude that aortopulmonary collaterals occur in bronchopulmonary dysplasia and can cause major problems in ventilated premature infants. Echocardiographic evaluation is important to prevent aggravation of chronic lung disease of infants at risk."

CD008201,0,26742600,0,Obstetrical venous thromboembolism: Epidemiology and strategies for prophylaxis.,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a leading cause of severe maternal morbidity and mortality. While pregnancy alone is a risk factor for VTE, additional population-based risk factors such as obesity are becoming increasingly common, particularly in the developed world. Maternal death from VTE is amenable to prevention and VTE thromboprophylaxis is the most readily implementable means of systematically reducing the maternal death rate. In the United States, prophylaxis is recommended primarily for patients at extremely high risk for thromboembolism and women undergoing cesarean delivery, whereas in the United Kingdom a larger proportion of the population is targeted. Given the maternal burden of obstetric VTE and varying strategies for prevention, this article will provide a review of the following topics: (1) global epidemiology of obstetric VTE, (2) prophylaxis guidelines in the United States and the United Kingdom, and (3) maternal mortality from VTE in the United States and the United Kingdom in the setting of differing prophylaxis strategies."

CD008201,0,23481876,0,Prevention of venous thromboembolism in hospitalized patients: analysis of reduced cost and improved clinical outcomes.,"The impact of implementing a guideline on venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis was evaluated in a metropolitan private hospital with a before- and after-intervention study. This subsequent study aimed to identify if improved prophylaxis rates translated into cost savings and improved clinical outcomes. A conceptual decision-tree analytical model incorporating local treatment algorithms and clinical trial data was used to compare prophylaxis costs and clinical outcomes before and after the guideline implementation. The study analyzed data from 21,942 medical and surgical patients admitted to a 250-bed acute-care private hospital in Sydney, Australia. The modeled simulation estimated the incidence of symptomatic deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) as well as adverse events such as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS), major bleeding, and mortality. The costs of prophylaxis therapy and treating adverse events were also calculated. The improvement in prophylaxis rates following the implementation of the guideline was estimated to result in 13 fewer deaths, 84 fewer symptomatic DVTs, 19 fewer symptomatic PEs, and 512 fewer hospital-bed days. Improved adherence to evidence-based prophylaxis regimens was associated with overall cost savings of $245,439 over 12 months. We conclude that improved adherence to evidence-based guidelines for VTE prophylaxis is achievable and is likely to result in fewer deaths, fewer VTE events, and a significant overall cost saving."
CD008201,0,14614352,0,Thromboprophylaxis with unmonitored intermediate-dose low molecular weight heparin in pregnancies with a previous arterial or venous thrombotic event.,"The comparatively high rate of complications, both to the mother and foetus, of warfarin and unfractionated heparin have led to an increased use of low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) in pregnant women at risk of thrombosis. However, despite reliable pharmacokinetics of LMWH, current practice is that anti-activated factor X levels are monitored in this group of patients. We report the use of unmonitored dalteparin in 27 pregnancies of 25 women who had previous thrombotic events. All women had normal renal function and weighed less than 85 kg prior to conceiving. The regimen consisted of 5000 IU dalteparin once daily started at the time of a positive pregnancy test, and increased to twice daily at 16-20 weeks gestation. In this cohort of patients there was a low complication rate. None of the women developed recurrent venous thromboses during these pregnancies but two women with known cerebral antiphospholipid syndrome developed recurrent cerebral ischaemia, which responded to an increase in dose. In our small group of patients, we have found that the use of intermediate-dose LMWH in pregnant women does not need to be monitored, and that it is safe and probably effective in preventing recurrent venous but not arterial thromboembolic events in high-risk pregnancies."

For acute episodes of venous thromboembolism, no data suggest that patients with thrombophilia should be treated differently to those without thrombophilia. Based on the results of a retrospective study, it is recommended that all thrombophilic individuals receive short-term thromboprophylaxis with unfractionated heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin when they are to be exposed to circumstantial risk factors (e.g. surgery, prolonged immobilization, pregnancy and puerperium). In the absence of specifically designed clinical trials, secondary prophylaxis should be based on common sense and clinical experience. From this standpoint, it is recommended that low-risk patients be treated with oral anticoagulants for 6 months, whereas high-risk patients should receive lifelong anticoagulant therapy. Which treatment strategy to adopt for intermediate-risk patients is more controversial -- prolongation of oral anticoagulant therapy to at least 12 months is suggested."

CD008201,0,25829216,0,Risks and benefits of triple oral anti-thrombotic therapies after acute coronary syndromes and percutaneous coronary intervention.,"The key pathophysiological process underlying symptomatic coronary artery disease, including acute coronary syndromes (ACS), is usually a rupture or an erosion of an atherosclerotic plaque, followed by platelet activation and subsequent thrombus formation. Early clinical trials showed benefit with long-term aspirin treatment, and later-based on large clinical trials-dual anti-platelet therapy (DAPT), initially with clopidogrel, and more recently with prasugrel or ticagrelor, has become the established treatment in the post-ACS setting and after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Treatment with DAPT is recommended for both ST-elevation myocardial infarction and non-ST-elevation ACS, as well as after PCI with stenting, in American and European clinical guidelines. Notwithstanding the benefits observed with DAPT, including third-generation P2Y12 receptor inhibitors plus aspirin, ACS patients remain at high risk for a recurrent cardiovascular event, suggesting that other treatment strategies, including the addition of a third oral anti-platelet agent or a novel oral anticoagulant (NOAC) to standard DAPT regimens, may provide additional benefit for post-ACS patients and for patients undergoing PCI. Adding a third anti-thrombotic agent to DAPT after an ACS event or a PCI procedure has been shown to have modest benefit in terms of ischemic event reduction, but has consistently been associated with increased bleeding complications. Therefore, the quest to optimize anti-thrombotic therapies post-ACS and post-PCI continues unabated but is tempered by the historical experiences to date that indicate that careful patient and dose selection will be critical features of future randomized trials."

Prehospital phase: nothing, aspirin or what?].","In most cases of ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) a major coronary vessel is occluded by a thrombus. This is why early and effective antiplatelet therapy plays a key role. The current guidelines recommend the administration of dual antiplatelet therapy as early as possible. Despite the lack of convincing clinical evidence, prehospital administration appears reasonable, primarily because of pharmacokinetic considerations. Ticagrelor should be preferentially administered because the largest amount of evidence is available and it appears to be safe. In high-risk patients undergoing transfer to a catheterization laboratory, upstream use of a glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa receptor antagonist (tirofiban) may be considered. Acute coronary syndrome without ST segment elevation (NSTE-ACS) represents a clinically heterogeneous group. Current guidelines recommend that antiplatelet therapy should be initiated as early as possible when the diagnosis of NSTE-ACS is made. If there is high clinical suspicion of NSTE-ACS acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) should be given before hospital admission. In high-risk patients prehospital administration of ticagrelor may be considered."

The purpose of this large retrospective cohort study was to externally validate the IMPROVE RAM using a large database of three acute care hospitals. We studied 41,486 hospitalisations (28,744 unique patients) with 1,240 VTE hospitalisations (1,135 unique patients) in the VTE cohort and 40,246 VTE-free hospitalisations (27,609 unique patients) in the control cohort. After chart review, 139 unique VTE patients were identified and 278 randomly-selected matched patients in the control cohort. Seven independent VTE risk factors as part of the RAM in the derivation cohort were identified. In the validation cohort, the incidence of VTE was 0.20%; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18-0.22, 1.04%; 95%CI 0.88-1.25, and 4.15%; 95%CI 2.79-8.12 in the low, moderate, and high VTE risk groups, respectively, which compared to rates of 0.45%, 1.3%, and 4.74% in the three risk categories of the derivation cohort. For the derivation and validation cohorts, the total percentage of patients in low, moderate and high VTE risk occurred in 68.6% vs 63.3%, 24.8% vs 31.1%, and 6.5% vs 5.5%, respectively. Overall, the area under the receiver-operator characteristics curve for the validation cohort was 0.7731. In conclusion, the IMPROVE RAM can accurately identify medical patients at low, moderate, and high VTE risk. This will tailor future thromboprophylactic strategies in this population as well as identify particularly high VTE risk patients in whom multimodal or more intensive prophylaxis may be beneficial."

The aim of the present study was to describe the solutions adopted to solve technical difficulties related to priming, vascular access and monitoring and then to evaluate clinical results. Between 1982 and 2000, 51 consecutive children (28 male, 23 female) with a mean age of 4.9 +/- 4.8 years (3 months-14.8 years) and a mean weight of 19.7 +/- 12.8 kg (5-52 kg), with renal and/or extra-renal diseases requiring apheretic procedures were selected for the study. The overall number of procedures performed were: 226 plasma-exchange (PE), 6 LDL-apheresis (LDL-A) and 8 protein A immunoadsorption (IAPA) sessions. Our therapeutic protocol involves hematic flux of 20-100 ml/min and ultrafiltration of 5-20 ml/min. In each 70-95 minute session we exchanged plasmatic volume with fresh frozen plasma or with a solution of 6% albumin in lactated Ringer's, using heparin (10-20 UI/kg/h). We used Paired Filtration Dialysis Monitor in PE and LDL-A; Citem 10 in IAPA. As plasma separator, we used a filter made of polypropylene, 0.2 m2 surface, 30 ml priming (Hemaplex BT 900). Hemolytic uremic syndrome was the most commonly treated disease (18/51 cases) with good results in 10/18 cases. We recorded, good results in vasculitis as well, in one girl with focal glomerulosclerosis in transplanted kidney and rapid improvement in all children with Guillaine-Barré Syndrome. PE treatment was effective in metabolic disorders such as tirosynemia and familiar hypercholesterolemia. Only 4/12 patients with acute liver failure due to viral hepatitis recovered. We had poor results in the remaining eight cases. Complications were rare and no viral infection was found in any patient. Our data show that it is possible to use these procedures in pediatric patients even though clinical indications and real effectiveness still need to be cleared up."

CD008201,0,8228594,0,The management of lateral sinus thrombosis.,"The standard recommended treatment for lateral sinus thrombosis is intravenous antibiotics. For those that fail, some authors recommend anticoagulant therapy, others internal jugular vein ligation. Despite these recommendations, there is still a significant mortality in all reported large series and the main reason this is that the cause of the failure has not been found or investigated. Over a six-year-period, from January 1985 to December 1990, 36 patients were admitted with lateral sinus thrombosis. The initial treatment consisted of intravenous antibiotics and surgery. The surgery included cortical mastoidectomy for non-cholesteatomatous ears and modified radical mastoidectomy for cholesteatomatous ears and drainage of the intracranial collection of pus in patients with subdural empyema and brain abscess. There were nine failures (25 per cent) with this treatment regimen. Blood cultures and pus swab of the ears were taken from these patients. The blood cultures were positive in four patients and the organisms isolated included beta-haemolytic Streptococcus sp. in two, Proteus mirabilis and Streptococcus pneumoniae in one each. From the ear swab mixed cultures were found in eight and a single organism in one. Gram-negative organisms were isolated in nine (100 per cent), Proteus mirabilis in eight (89 per cent) and Enterobacter sp. in two. Both these organisms were resistant to ampicillin and penicillin but were sensitive to amikacin. Amikacin was then added to the treatment regimen and a dramatic response with a fall in the temperature, and improvement in the patients' general condition was noted within 24 hours, in all patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

The Trauma Program has found the incorporation of the scoring systems into the trauma registry to be a value-added component of our performance improvement process. Bronson's unique model of trauma care, where patients are admitted and discharged from the same room, combined with today's technology of wireless laptops and personal digital assistants, promotes a progressive approach to DVT/PE prophylaxis and performance improvement.

CD008201,0,10629401,0,Extended prophylaxis against venous thromboembolism following total hip and knee replacement.,"The recently reported reductions in the incidence of post-operative venous thromboembolism (VTE) are related to the widespread use of prophylactic anticoagulants. Many uncertainties remain with regard to the most effective ways to use thromboprophylaxis, however. The trend towards shorter hospital stays means that patients may receive less than the recommended 7-10 days of prophylaxis. Prolonged periods of thromboprophylaxis may be beneficial for patients at high risk of post-operative VTE, such as those undergoing major orthopaedic surgery. The relative rarity of symptomatic deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism means that very large patient populations are required for studies that rely on clinical endpoints, but studies using venographic endpoints have shown 28-35 days of prophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin to be more effective than 10-14 days. Other factors that may influence the efficacy of thromboprophylaxis include the timing of the first injection and the choice of agent."

CD008201,0,21099543,0,Evaluating clinical decision support rules as an intervention in clinician workflows with technology.,"The implementation of electronic health records in rural settings generated new challenges beyond those seen in urban hospitals. The preparation, implementation, and sustaining of clinical decision support rules require extensive attention to standards, content design, support resources, expert knowledge, and more. A formative evaluation was used to present progress and evolution of clinical decision support rule implementation and use within clinician workflows for application in an electronic health record. The rural hospital was able to use clinical decision support rules from five urban hospitals within its system to promote safety, prevent errors, establish evidence-based practices, and support communication. This article describes tools to validate initial 54 clinical decision support rules used in a rural referral hospital and 17 used in clinics. Since 2005, the study hospital has added specific system clinical decision support rules for catheter-acquired urinary tract infection, deep venous thrombosis, heart failure, and more. The findings validate the use of clinical decision support rules across sites and ability to use existing indicators to measure outcomes. Rural hospitals can rapidly overcome the barriers to prepare and implement as well as sustain use of clinical decision support rules with a systemized approach and support structures. A model for design and validation of clinical decision support rules into workflow processes is presented. The replication and reuse of clinical decision support rule templates with data specifications that follow data models can support reapplication of the rule intervention in subsequent rural and critical access hospitals through system support resources."

CD008201,0,12678188,0,The LONFLIT4--Concorde Deep Venous Thrombosis and Edema Study: prevention with travel stockings.,"The LONFLIT1+2 studies have established that in high risk subjects after long flights (> 10 hours) the incidence of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) is between 4% and 6%. The LONFLIT4 study was designed to evaluate the control of edema and DVT in low-medium risk subjects. The aim of this study was to evaluate edema and its control with specific stockings (ankle pressure between 20 and 30 mm Hg) in long-haul flights. The first part of the study included flights lasting 7-8 hours and the second part included flights lasting 11-12 hours. Ultrasound scans were used to assess thrombosis before and after the flights and a composite edema score was used to evaluate edema and swelling. A group of patients with microangiopathy associated to edema (diabetes, venous hypertension, anti-hypertensive treatment) were also included to evaluate the preventive effects of stockings during flight. Part I: DVT evaluation: Of the 74 subjects in the stocking group and 76 in the control group (150), 144 completed the study. Dropouts were due to low compliance or traveling and connection problems. Age and gender distribution were comparable in the 3 groups as was risk factor distribution. In this part of the study there were no DVTs. Edema Evaluation: The level of edema at inclusion was comparable in the two groups of subjects. After the flight there was an average score of 6.9 (1) in the control group. In the stocking group, the score was on average 2.3 (1), three times lower than in the control group (p < 0.05). Part II: DVT evaluation: Of the 66 included subjects in the stocking group and 68 in the control group (134), 132 completed the study. Dropouts were due to low compliance or connection problems. Age and gender distribution were comparable in the two groups. In the stocking group no DVT was observed. In the control group, 2 subjects had a popliteal DVT and 2 subjects had superficial venous thrombosis (SVT); in total 4 subjects (6%) in the control group had a thrombotic event; the incidence of DVT was 3%. The difference (p < 0.02) is significant."

Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) has been studied extensively in the context of spinal surgery but symptomatic pulmonary embolism (PE) has engaged less attention. We prospectively followed a consecutive cohort of 270 patients undergoing spinal surgery at a single institution. From these patients, only 26 were simple discectomies, while the largest proportion (226) was fusions. All patients received both low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) initiated after surgery and compressive stockings. PE was diagnosed with spiral chest CT. Six patients developed symptomatic PE, five during their hospital stay. In three of the six patients the embolic event occurred during the first 3 postoperative days. They were managed by the temporary insertion of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter thus allowing for a delay in full-dose anticoagulation until removal of the filter. None of the PE patients suffered any bleeding complication as a result of the introduction of full anticoagulation. Two patients suffered postoperative haematomas, without development of neurological symptoms or signs, requiring emergency evacuation. The overall incidence of PE was 2.2% rising to 2.5% after exclusion of microdiscectomy cases. The incidence of PE was highest in anterior or combined thoracolumbar/lumbar procedures (4.2%). There is a large variation in the reported incidence of PE in the spinal literature. Results from the only study found in the literature specifically monitoring PE suggest an incidence of PE as high as 2.5%. Our study shows a similar incidence despite the use of LMWH. In the absence of randomized controlled trials (RCT) it is uncertain if this type of prophylaxis lowers the incidence of PE. However, other studies show that the morbidity of LMWH is very low. Since PE can be a life-threatening complication, LMWH may be a worthwhile option to consider for prophylaxis. RCTs are necessary in assessing the efficacy of DVT and PE prophylaxis in spinal patients."

Accordingly, it is unknown if enoxaparin is as safe to prescribe as subcutaneous heparin for thromboprophylaxis in patients with chronic renal failure. Here we conducted a retrospective comparative effectiveness study in a large population of chronic maintenance dialysis patients initiated with subcutaneous injections of enoxaparin or heparin for thromboprophylaxis. The primary study end point was hospitalization or death related to bleeding, with a secondary end point of venous thromboembolism. Among 7721 dialysis patients started on subcutaneous enoxaparin or heparin at doses for thromboprophylaxis, the crude rate for bleeding requiring hospitalization or resulting in death was 15.2 (95% confidence interval (CI) 12.7-18.2) events per 100 patient-years in the enoxaparin group, which did not differ from the heparin group in which the crude rate was 16.2 (95% CI 14.0-18.7) events per 100 patient-years. In risk factor-adjusted Poisson models, enoxaparin was not associated with more bleeding in comparison to heparin (risk ratio, 0.98; 95% CI 0.78-1.23). The risk of venous thromboembolism was not associatively worse with enoxaparin (risk ratio, 0.77; 95% CI 0.49-1.22). Thus, in dialysis patients, daily enoxaparin for thromboprophylaxis was not associated with increased serious bleeding or less effective compared to subcutaneous heparin."

Despite anticoagulation, venous thromboembolism (VTE) remains the most common cause of surgical morbidity and mortality in this high-risk patient group. Although various thromboprophylactic regimes are employed, evidence relating to the most effective method remains unclear. Controversies surrounding screening, the use of prophylactic inferior vena cava filters (IVCF) and chemothromboprophylaxis in polytraumatised patients, particularly those with pelvic and acetabular fractures, form the basis of considerable debate. With the absence of a well-designed clinical trial and the presence of ongoing controversies within the literature, this review will explore current treatment options available to trauma surgeons and highlight differing scientific opinions, providing an update on the role of screening and current available preventative measures. We cover existing as well as recent advances in chemical thromboprophylactic agents and discuss external mechanical compression devices, the usefulness of serial duplex ultrasonography and the role of extended chemothromboprophylaxis on discharge. The evidence behind prophylactic IVCF is also considered, along with reported complication profiles. We conclude with a proposed protocol for use in major trauma centres, which can form the basis of local policy for the prevention of VTE in trauma patients with pelvic and acetabular fractures."

ICU mortality in AKI patients can exceed 50%. Venous catheters are the preferred vascular access method for AKI patients requiring RRT, but carry a risk of catheter thrombosis or infection. Catheter lock solutions are commonly used to prevent such complications. Heparin and citrate locks are both widely used for tunneled, long-term catheters, but few studies have compared citrate versus heparin for patients with short-term, non-tunneled catheters. We aim to compare citrate 4% catheter lock solution versus heparin in terms of event-free survival of the first non-tunneled hemodialysis catheter inserted in ICU patients with AKI requiring RRT. Secondary objectives are the rate of fibrinolysis, incidence of catheter thrombosis and catheter-related infection per 1,000 catheter days, length of stay in ICU and in-hospital and 28-day mortality."

CD008201,0,10493227,0,Future prospects of prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis.,"The last decade has witnessed substantial progress in the prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism. However, the risk of deep vein thrombosis remains high in trauma patients and those undergoing orthopaedic surgery despite use of the best available prophylaxis. Existing antithrombotics also carry a significant risk of bleeding and other adverse effects, including heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). More effective and safer anticoagulants are therefore needed. Current approaches for improving the benefit:risk ratio of antithrombotic therapy include the development of indirect thrombin inhibitors with a high anti-Xa:anti-IIa activity ratio, and the use of direct thrombin inhibitors. Novel indirect thrombin inhibitors under investigation include pentasaccharide and the heparinoid danaparoid. These agents may offer reduced bleeding risk compared with conventional therapies, but there is no evidence of greater antithrombotic efficacy. However, due to low cross-reactivity with anti-heparin-platelet factor 4 antibodies, danaparoid and pentasaccharide may prove valuable in the management of HIT. Theoretically, the antithrombotic effect of direct thrombin inhibitors may be greater than that of indirect inhibitors because direct inhibitors are not dependent on endogenous cofactors and are able to inhibit both free and clot-bound thrombin. Direct inhibitors of the active site of thrombin and recombinant variants of hirudin, originally derived from the medicinal leech, are currently under investigation. Early data on lepirudin and desirudin suggest that recombinant hirudins may have clinical applications in thromboprophylaxis for high-risk patients, acute cardiology indications and HIT."

CD008201,0,22084663,0,Deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis in trauma patients.,"Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) are known collectively as venous thromboembolism (VTE). Venous thromboembolic events are common and potentially life-threatening complications following trauma with an incidence of 5 to 63%. DVT prophylaxis is essential in the management of trauma patients. Currently, the optimal VTE prophylaxis strategy for trauma patients is unknown. Traditionally, pelvic and lower extremity fractures, head injury, and prolonged immobilization have been considered risk factors for VTE; however it is unclear which combination of risk factors defines a high-risk group. Modalities available for trauma patient thromboprophylaxis are classified into pharmacologic anticoagulation, mechanical prophylaxis, and inferior vena cava (IVC) filters. The available pharmacologic agents include low-dose heparin (LDH), low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), and factor Xa inhibitors. Mechanical prophylaxis methods include graduated compression stockings (GCSs), pneumatic compression devices (PCDs), and A-V foot pumps. IVCs are traditionally used in high risk patients in whom pharmacological prophylaxis is contraindicated. Both EAST and ACCP guidelines recommend primary use of LMWHs in trauma patients; however there are still controversies regarding the definitive VTE prophylaxis in trauma patients. Large randomized prospective clinical studies would be required to provide level I evidence to define the optimal VTE prophylaxis in trauma patients."

The ICP is a goal-defined and time-specified documentation by gynaecological oncology doctors and nurses, guided by certain parameters to be achieved in pre and postoperative days. All patients were admitted to the same unit and underwent a major abdominal/pelvic procedure for confirmed or suspected gynaecological malignancy, including hysterectomy and oophorectomy. The control group included 58 randomly selected patients from May 2008 to March 2009 and the intervention group comprised 52 patients, after the introduction of the ICP. The effectiveness was assessed with a variety of measurements: the duration of intraperitoneal drains, urethral catheters and intravenous fluids postoperatively; time taken for the patient to eat and drink; time taken to mobilisation; and the total length of stay in hospital. We also assessed whether the implementation of the care pathway was associated with an increase in adherence to prescribing guidelines for thromboprophylaxis and postoperative antibiotics and sodium docusate. The new ICP encouraged clearer documentation and regular review of fluids, drains and catheters. There was a modest reduction in the length of stay and an increase in prescribed thromboprophylaxis and sodium docusate ( Cheung et al. 2011 )."

Hospital-related VTE is associated with more than half of the VTE burden in a community, either in-hospital or after discharge. Selective thromboprophylaxis is recommended for patients at risk. Patient selection for thromboprophylaxis requires proper VTE risk stratification. VTE stratification may be achieved by either risk assessment models (RAM) or by models based on patient's illness and associated risk factors. Whatever the model, a thromboprophylatic recommendation should be formulated for each VTE risk category. VTE thromboprophylaxis may include general measures, mechanic compression procedures, pharmacological intervention or a combined approach. After many decades of consensus statements, a large proportion of at risk patients (20% to 75%) still does not receive proper thromboprophylaxis. This study aims to alert to the relevance of thromboprophylaxis and to suggest hospital thromboprophylatic strategies in a Brazilian setting."
CD008201,0,23313542,0,Persistence of hypercoagulable state after resection of intra-abdominal malignancies.,"The hypercoagulable state associated with cancer imparts considerable risk for venous thromboembolism. Surgical resection of malignancies should theoretically reverse tumor-induced hypercoagulability. However, coagulation changes in cancer patients postresection have not been described thoroughly. Conventional coagulation tests are unable to detect hypercoagulable states. In contrast, rotational thromboelastography (ROTEM) can detect hypo- or hypercoagulable conditions. We hypothesized that the cancer-induced hypercoagulable state would improve after surgical resection."
CD008201,0,18510989,0,Management of venous thromboembolism in patients with advanced cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Venous thromboembolism is common in patients with cancer. However, no management guidelines exist for venous thromboembolism specific to patients with advanced progressive cancer. To help develop recommendations for practice, we have done a comprehensive review of anticoagulation treatment in patients with cancer, with particular focus on studies that included patients with advanced disease. Data from 19 publications, including randomised, prospective, and retrospective studies suggest that: long-term full-dose low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is more effective than warfarin in the secondary prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism in patients with cancer of any stage, performance status, or prognosis; warfarin should not be used in patients with advancing progressive disease; and in patients at high risk of bleeding, full-dose LMWH for 7 days followed by a long-term decreased fixed dose long term can be considered. The optimum treatment duration is unclear, but because the prothrombotic tendency will persist in patients with advanced cancer, indefinite treatment is generally recommended. For patients with contraindications to anticoagulation, inferior-vena-caval filters can be considered, but their use needs careful patient selection. Ultimately, the decision to initiate, continue, and stop anticoagulation will need to be made on an individual basis, guided by the available evidence, the patient's circumstances, and their informed preferences."
CD008201,0,25320239,0,How I treat splanchnic vein thrombosis.,"Antithrombotic treatment of splanchnic vein thrombosis (SVT) is a clinical challenge. Depending on the site of thrombosis, patients are at risk of developing liver insufficiency, portal hypertension, or bowel infarction and may experience recurrence in both the splanchnic veins and other vein segments. To prevent recurrence, anticoagulant therapy should be started as soon as possible after diagnosis and is often continued for an indefinite period of time. However, active bleeding is not infrequent at the time of SVT diagnosis, and major risk factors for bleeding, such as esophageal varices or a low platelet count, are frequently present in these patients. In real-world clinical practice, a proportion of SVT patients are left untreated because the risks associated with anticoagulant therapy are felt to exceed its benefits. However, the majority of patients receive anticoagulant drugs, with heterogeneous timing of initiation, drug choice, and dosages. Evidence to drive treatment decisions is limited because no randomized controlled trials have been carried out in these patients. This review provides practical guidance for the use of anticoagulant drugs in patients presenting with SVT, including symptomatic as well as incidentally detected events."
CD008201,0,24418303,0,Risk of venous and arterial thrombosis according to type of antiphospholipid antibodies in adults without systemic lupus erythematosus: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,To evaluate the magnitude of venous and arterial thrombosis risk associated with antiphospholipid antibodies (APLs) in adults without systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
CD008201,0,18681105,0,Prevention of venous thromboembolism in hospitalized patients.,"The rationale for thromboprophylaxis is based on the high prevalence of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Use of effective methods of prophylaxis is more cost-effective and is safer than selective, intensive screening for VTE. These therapeutic options will be discussed."
