CD010023,0,1618419,0,[Computerized tomography of the hand with high resolution technique].,"The results of 175 high-resolution computed tomography (CT) scans of the hand and wrist are analysed and compared to the results of conventional radiographs. Advantages of the procedure can be demonstrated when assessing pathological changes within the complex three-dimensional structure of the hand and wrist, and in the analysis of articular surfaces. In some cases, fractures and dislocations of the distal radioulnar joint and the carpal bones were missed in conventional radiographs. In cases of scaphoid fracture and nonunion, CT scans give valuable additional information surpassing the possibilities of conventional radiographs. For instance, bone healing after bone grafting can be better evaluated with a CT scan. Furthermore, preoperative planning is simplified, when tumors and cysts of the carpal bones can be located precisely using computed tomography."

CD010023,0,10068010,0,Patterns of healing of scaphoid fractures. The importance of vascularity.,We studied 45 patients with 46 fractures of the scaphoid who presented sequentially over a period of 21 months. MRI enabled us to relate the pattern of the fracture to the blood supply of the scaphoid. Serial MRI studies of the four main patterns showed that each followed a constant sequence during healing and failure to progress normally predicted nonunion.
CD010023,0,20575885,0,Review of imaging of scaphoid fractures.,"Scaphoid fractures are the most common fractures of the carpus, accounting for 79% of all carpal fractures. Early diagnosis of scaphoid fractures is imperative owing to potential complications following the fracture, including non-union, avascular necrosis, carpal instability and osteoarthritis. Plain radiography remains the initial imaging modality to assess scaphoid fractures. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is excellent in the detection of clinically suspected, but initially radiographically negative, scaphoid fractures. Cost-effectiveness analysis studies have demonstrated MRI is effective in this setting. Gadolinium enhanced MRI has been shown to be superior to unenhanced MRI in the detection of avascular necrosis. Computerized tomography scan is the preferred modality to assess the intricacies of scaphoid fracture, including fracture location and deformity, as well as union status. This review paper explores the recent advances in imaging of the scaphoid, with reference also to avascular necrosis and non-union following a scaphoid fracture."

CD010023,0,11089184,0,Diagnostic imaging for fracture of the hook of the hamate.,"We experienced 16 patients with a fracture of the hook of the hamate. The routine posteroanterior view raised the suspicion of fracture in four of 13 patients (31%), the carpal tunnel view showed the actual fractures in six of 14 patients (43%), and the supine oblique radiographic view of the wrist showed fractures in eight of ten patients (80%). Computed tomography corroborated the fracture in all eight patients (100%). Computerized tomography proved most useful for accurate diagnosis of fracture of the hook of the hamate."
CD010023,0,11089185,0,Cystic lesion in carpal bone.,"Six cases of symptomatic cystic lesions of carpal bones which underwent operative treatment were reviewed. Definite diagnosis, etiology and treatment were also discussed. The lesions occurred in the scaphoid, lunate, capitate and triquetrum, and were multiple lesions in four of the six cases. Juxta-articular bone cyst was diagnosed in three cases: intraosseous cavity surrounded by fibrous membrane containing gelatinous material, and ""bone cyst-like pathologic change"" in three cases which contained fibrous connective tissue resembled the thick inner wall of juxta-articular bone cyst histologically. They were treated by curettage and cancellous bone grafting; the outcomes were favourable without complication. It is suggested that the minor trauma resulting from the carpal loading serves as a basis for intraosseous lesion, which initiates intramedullary metaplasia followed by fibrous connective tissue proliferation with/without mucin secretion, and forms cystic cavity."
CD010023,0,17354814,0,Ultrasound-guided percutaneous scaphoid pinning: operator variability and comparison with traditional fluoroscopic procedure.,"This paper reports on pilot laboratory experiments with a recently proposed surgical procedure for percutaneous screw insertion into fractured scaphoid bones using ultrasound guidance. The experiments were intended to determine the operator variability of the procedure and its performance in comparison with a traditional pinning procedure using fluoroscopy. In the proposed procedure, a three-dimensional surface model is created from pre-operative computed tomography images and intra-operatively registered to the patient using ultrasound images. A graphical interface that communicates with an optical camera tracking the surgical tools, guides the surgeon during the procedure in real time. The results of the experiments revealed non-significant differences between operators for the error in the entry location of the drill hole (p=0.90); however, significant differences for the exit location (p<0.05). Comparison with the traditional pinning procedure shows that the outcome of the recently proposed procedure appears to be more consistent."

CD010023,0,21957277,0,Navicular stress reactions in runners: a review of evaluation and management of a competitive athlete.,Navicular stress injuries in athletes can be devastating. Clinical findings are frequently nonspecific until significant progression of the abnormality has occurred. The use of diagnostic imaging techniques early in the discovery period increases the likelihood of establishing an immediate diagnosis and avoids frank fracture of the navicular bone. Delayed diagnosis of navicular stress injuries in athletes can cause dire consequences. The physician must be aware of the injury in establishing a high index of clinical suspicion. The timing and sequencing of diagnostic imaging studies is essential in establishing a diagnosis to manage the patient and minimize time away from competition. This case study examines the history and management of an elite high school track athlete who sustained a navicular stress injury. The timing and use of diagnostic imaging studies is reviewed.

CD010023,0,20698466,0,Navicular stress fracture in high-performing twin brothers: a case report.,"Navicular stress fractures mainly occur in sprinting and push-off athletes. Numerous predisposing factors have been implicated in their development. Within a six-week interval in the summer of 2009, twin brothers, both elite track and field athletes, presented to us with medial foot pain. Plain radiographs were negative but a radioisotope bone scan and CT scan revealed an incomplete navicular fracture in both of them. The fracture was typically located in the proximal dorsal cortex of the central portion of the navicular bone. The presence of such a stress fracture in high performing, monozygotic twins, has never been described. As extrinsic and intrinsic risk factors, their comparability of mechanical stresses and kinematics as well as a genetic predisposition can be put forward. This case report suggests that a complex interaction between mechanical and genetic risk factors exists in the development of navicular stress fractures."
CD010023,0,8142175,0,"[Post-traumatic pain in the wrist, a diagnostic challenge].","Hyperextension of the wrist may induce underestimated intrinsic and extrinsic ligamentous tears. Undetected scaphoid fractures show the importance of accurate primary diagnostic. Evaluation of the anatomic and functional integrity of the ligaments of the wrist remains challenging. It requires great experience, but in any case, radiology remains the basic diagnostic tool used by both the general practitioner and the specialist. Only the use of reproducible imaging techniques will allow for comparison between healthy and pathological side as well as for follow-up. Every one should master and use standardized techniques as described in this paper. The costs bound to appropriate imaging techniques are certainly lower than the consequences of misdiagnosed ligamentous damage or carpal bone fractures. Furthermore, standardized techniques will avoid repeating radiological sessions."

A higher incidence of US abutment syndrome in the radially deviated US type was observed by dissection. Radiographs taken at varying shoulder abduction angles suggested that the base of the US and ulnar head are not round. To best evaluate the fovea and the US for possible US fractures, radiographs should be taken with the glenohumeral joint abducted 45 degrees, the elbow flexed 90 degrees, the forearm in neutral rotation, and the x-ray beam directed through the wrist perpendicular to the floor."
CD010023,0,17993436,0,Dorsoradial avulsion of the triangular fibrocartilage complex with an avulsion fracture of the sigmoid notch of the radius.,We report two extremely rare cases of dorsal radial avulsion injury of the triangular fibrocartilage complex accompanied by an avulsion fracture of the sigmoid notch of the radius. Anatomical reduction of the bone fragment in conjunction with reattachment of the dorsal portion of the radioulnar ligament to the radial sigmoid notch were necessary to restore stability of the distal radioulnar joint and tension of the triangular fibrocartilage proper.
CD010023,0,1456359,0,Outcome of conservative and surgical management of navicular stress fracture in athletes. Eighty-six cases proven with computerized tomography.,"Eighty-two athletes with 86 clinical navicular stress fractures, all imaged with computerized tomography, were followed for an average of 33 months (range, 6 to 108) after diagnosis. Initial treatment consisted of at least 6 weeks of nonweightbearing cast immobilization for 22 fractures, at least 6 weeks of limitation of activity with continued weightbearing for 34 fractures, and a period of less than 6 weeks of conservative treatment for another 19 fractures. Five patients attempted to continue playing sports. Six patients had immediate surgery. Nineteen of 22 patients (86%) who had initial non-weightbearing cast immobilization treatment returned to sports, compared with only 9 of 34 patients (26%) who initially continued weightbearing with limited activity (P < 0.001). After failure of the latter treatment, successful outcomes were seen for 6 of 7 patients (86%) treated with nonweightbearing cast immobilization, while 11 of 15 patients (73%) who had one surgical procedure were able to return to sports. These results indicate that nonweightbearing cast immobilization is the treatment of choice for navicular stress fractures. Also, this treatment compares favorably with surgical treatment for patients who present after failed weightbearing treatments. Computerized tomographic appearances of healing fractures do not necessarily mirror clinical union, and postimmobilization management should be monitored clinically."
CD010023,0,6224230,0,Tarsal navicular stress fractures: radiographic evaluation.,Tarsal navicular stress fractures are a potential source of disabling foot pain in physically active individuals. The diagnosis of tarsal navicular stress fracture requires a high index of clinical and radiographic suspicion because the fracture is only rarely evident on routine radiographs or standard tomograms. The radiographic diagnosis of a tarsal navicular stress fracture may require anatomic anteroposterior tomograms or a radionuclide bone scan with plantar views. Radiographic examinations of 23 fractures in 21 patients are evaluated.
CD010023,0,15274268,0,MRI and plain radiography in the assessment of displaced fractures of the waist of the carpal scaphoid.,"We treated 50 patients with fractures of the waist of the scaphoid in a below-elbow plaster cast for up to 13 weeks. Displacement of the fragments was assessed independently by two observers using MRI and radiographs performed within two weeks of injury. The MRI assessments showed that only the measurement of sagittal translation of the fragments and an overall assessment of displacement had satisfactory inter- and intra-observer reproducibility and revealed that nine of the 50 fractures were displaced. Only three of the 49 fractures with adequate follow-up failed to unite, and all were displaced with more than 1 mm of translation in the sagittal plane. If the MRI assessment of displacement of the fracture was used as the measurement of choice, assessment of displacement on the initial scaphoid series of radiographs showed a sensitivity of between 33% and 47% and a positive predictive value of between 27% and 86%. Neither observer was able correctly to identify more than 33% to 47% of the displaced fractures from the plain radiographs. Although the overall assessment of displacement and gapping and translation in the coronal plane on the plain radiographs influenced the rate of union, none of these parameters identified all three fractures which failed to unite. We conclude that the assessment of displacement of scaphoid fractures on MRI can probably be used to assess the likelihood of union although the small number of nonunions limits the power of the study. In contrast, the assessment of displacement on routine radiography is inaccurate and of less value in predicting union."

CD010023,0,3693834,0,The genesis of Kienböck's disease: evaluation of a case by magnetic resonance imaging.,"We describe a patient in whom, despite normal initial radiographs, tomograms, bone scan, and magnetic resonance imaging, Kienböck's disease developed without the patient suffering an intercurrent injury. This case suggests that Kienböck's disease may not always develop acutely after a single injury but may have a more gradual onset."
CD010023,0,2964829,1,Skeletal scintigraphy of the wrist in suggested scaphoid fracture.,"Skeletal scintigraphy was performed in 187 patients with clinical suspicion of a scaphoid fracture but with normal radiographic findings. In 85 patients focally moderately (12 patients) or markedly to intensely (73 patients) increased radionuclide uptake was seen, over either the distal radius or carpal bones. A fracture corresponding to markedly increased uptake was eventually verified in 15 out of 26 patients in the distal radius, in 21 out of 28 in the scaphoid but in only 6 out of 18 in other carpal bones. One fracture of the body and one of the hook of the hamate were found, one fracture of the capitate and three of the triquetrum. Not a single fracture was verified in 10 patients with markedly, often intensely, increased activity over the trapezium/trapezoid. It is concluded that scintigraphy is of value in carpal trauma not only to exclude scaphoid fracture but also to direct the attention to the possibility of other carpal fractures, otherwise usually missed."
CD010023,0,18929188,0,Pronated oblique view in assessing proximal scaphoid articular cannulated screw penetration.,Volar and percutaneous techniques of screw fixation for scaphoid fractures usually do not involve direct visualization of the dorsoproximal scaphoid articular surface. Intra-articular screw penetration may be overlooked if the proper fluoroscopic views are not obtained. The hypothesis of this study is that the pronated oblique fluoroscopic view of the scaphoid is the most sensitive in detecting dorsal articular screw penetration of the scaphoid when compared with other views.
CD010023,0,19043131,0,The use of a vascularised periosteal patch onlay graft in the management of nonunion of the proximal scaphoid.,"We describe the use of a vascularised periosteal patch onlay graft based on the 1,2 intercompartmental supraretinacular artery in the management of 11 patients (ten men, one woman) with chronic nonunion involving the proximal third of the scaphoid. The mean age of the patients was 31 years (21 to 45) with the dominant hand affected in eight. Six of the patients were smokers and three had undergone previous surgery to the scaphoid. All of the proximal fragments were avascular. The presence of union was assessed using longitudinal axis CT. Only three patients progressed to union of the scaphoid and four required a salvage operation for a symptomatic nonunion. The remaining four patients with a persistent nonunion are asymptomatic with low pain scores, good grip strength and a functional range of wrist movement. Although this technique has potential technical advantages over vascularised pedicled bone grafting, the rate of union has been disappointing and we do not recommend it as a method of treatment."
CD010023,0,2688677,0,CT of the wrist for the evaluation of traumatic injuries.,"Computed tomography (CT) of the wrist can help evaluate many types of posttraumatic injuries, particularly bony trauma. Most wrist fractures can be diagnosed with routine radiography, but problematic cases and complicated healing fractures can be difficult to evaluate with conventional radiography. CT provides improved contrast resolution and multiplanar imaging. The results of complex healing fractures and fusion procedures can be facilitated with CT. Even in the face of advanced osteoporosis CT can delineate bone edges and detect small areas of bony fusion. The degree of bone graft assimilation can be determined with CT. Unlike conventional radiography, metal fixation pins and cast material do not obviate diagnostic exams with CT. Certain posttraumatic complications such as distal radioulnar joint incongruity and hypertrophy of Lister's tubercle can be detected with axial CT images. Complicated cases of retained foreign bodies can be evaluated with CT. The high-contrast resolution of CT allows precise localization of foreign bodies and can define anatomic relationships to adjacent vital structures such as joints, tendons, and carpal tunnel. Postarthrography CT of the wrist is an investigational tool that permits direct visualization of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC). Complete and partial tears of the TFCC can be evaluated with postarthrography CT. Ulnar capsular tears and disruptions of interosseous ligaments can also be evaluated with this technique. The exact role of postarthrography CT of the wrist, however, is uncertain at this point. Three-dimensional CT is receiving increasing interest and may eventually help the understanding of wrist pathomechanics and kinematics. In summary, CT of the wrist can be instrumental in evaluating complicated posttraumatic injuries of the wrist and has certain advantages over routine radiography."
CD010023,0,15948438,0,Current perspectives in the management of scaphoid nonunions.,"When left untreated, scaphoid fractures follow a downward spiral resulting in carpal collapse and arthritis. The purpose of intervention is to allow a cartilage-wrapped bone to heal and maintain a smooth articular surface. Proposed treatment options for scaphoid nonunions have varied success rates. Using the Mack-Lichtman classification for nonunions, a plan can be formulated for individual patients based on motion loss, degenerative changes, carpal collapse, and fracture instability manifested by bone loss. Stable nonunions may benefit from bone grafting and internal fixation. Unstable nonunions require grafting and fixation. With the development of arthritis, grafting and fixation must be weighed against suitability of a proximal row carpectomy or a four-corner fusion with scaphoid excision. Advanced carpal collapse and arthritis mandates fusion, either limited or complete. CT allows preoperative planning to assess grafting requirements. MRI defines vascular supply fa vascular graft is considered. Vascularized graft options have multiplied as attention has been focused on the impact of improved blood supply on the avascular scaphoid. Patient- and fracture-specific factors are important considerations when determining surgical options; underestimating their importance can compromise surgical results even with a high level of technical skill. Successful treatment of scaphoid nonunions remains a difficult challenge despite improvement in fixation devices and surgical options. By regarding injury status together with patient factors, surgical options can be narrowed and patient expectations managed more realistically."

CD010023,0,11775472,0,Scaphoid nonunions. Pitfalls and pearls.,"Our ability to treat scaphoid nonunions has improved dramatically. The degree of collapse and bone loss can be accurately assessed in waist fractures using sagittal images on CT scans. These nonunions require reduction and bone grafting to re-establish the normal geometry of the scaphoid. Magnetic resonance imaging helps evaluate whether or not avascular necrosis is present in the proximal pole. Because of the poor prognosis of conventional bone grafts, a vascularized bone graft is recommended as the primary treatment when AVN is present. The volar collapse of the humpback deformity is best corrected with a volar approach and the proximal pole nonunion is best approached using a dorsal approach. Nearly all proximal pole nonunions require a vascularized bone graft and all acute proximal pole fractures require open reduction and internal fixation. Using specially designed cannulated screws, the nonunions can be stabilized accurately to decrease the time to resolution of the nonunion and minimize the amount of time in a cast. Stable fixation requires that the screw fixation target the central portion of the scaphoid regardless of the type of screw design used. Using these techniques, the hand surgeon should be able to provide a reasonable prognosis for patients presenting with a scaphoid nonunion, and the treatment should result in functional range of motion, grip strength, and relief of pain."
CD010023,0,3714271,0,[Fractures and dislocation fractures of the wrist joint].,"Most carpal fractures are based on the same injury mechanism. In most cases the injury is caused by a fall on the dorsiflexed hand, which is raised as a protective measure, and less frequently by a fall on the clenched fist. The latter leads to passive palmar flexion, pronation and radial inclination of the hand; in the former, the hand is passively superextended by the impact, supinated, and brought into ulnar inclination. The instability caused by injury to various articular structures has four developmental stages. The bones or syndesmoses that are involved depend on the stage and quantitative relationship between the three above-mentioned moments of force. If the lateral ligament of the wrist is slack, scaphoid fractures occur; in the last stage of superextension, fractures of the capitate bone occur. With increasing ulnar inclination, perilunar dislocations or fracture-dislocations and triquetrum fractures occur in the third stage and dislocations of the semilunar bone in the fourth stage. In addition, compression and avulsion of the 1st, 4th or 5th metacarpal bones cause fractures of the trapezium and the hamate bone. To avoid unpleasant late sequels, scaphoid fractures with diastasis due to soft tissue interposition or non-reducible dislocated scaphoid fractures must be treated surgically. Vertical oblique fractures and scaphoid fractures with small proximal fragments are relatively good indications for operation. Perilunar instability and dislocations, particularly De Quervain's fracture-dislocations, must be treated operatively because reduction of the scaphoid bone requires a different approach than correcting alignment in the carpus and because soft tissue interpositions are always present, even though they may not be evident in the X-ray pictures. Fracture-dislocations in the distal carpal row also require operation, preferably percutaneous internal fixation using K-wire and fluoroscopy. Immobilization is accomplished by a below-elbow cast with a dorsal plaster splint up to the interdigital webs and from the palmar to the proximal crease. The thumb is only embedded in trapezium fractures; fractures requiring fist or above-elbow casts are indications for operation."
CD010023,0,2584501,0,Forty degree angled coronal CT scanning of scaphoid fractures through plaster and fiberglass casts.,"A method for obtaining coronal CT scans angled 40 degrees to the longitudinal axis of the wrist, parallel to the long axis of the scaphoid, is described. Its potential for evaluating scaphoid fractures is assessed in 10 patients with healing or clinically suspected fractures. Overlapping 3 mm thick angled coronal CT scans were obtained for each patient both in and out of cast. The CT images were compared to plain films and tomography. Comparisons were also made of CT images obtained through fiberglass and plaster casts. All fractures apparent by plain films and tomography were apparent by CT; one case suspected of fracture on initial plain films showed no evidence of fracture on CT and subsequent clinical course and plain films. Osseous union of healing fractures was more reliably assessed on CT than on plain films and plain film tomography. There was no degradation of CT images by either fiberglass or plaster casts; fiberglass casts allowed easy planning of tomographic slices from scout films. We conclude that direct 40 degree angled coronal CT examination of the scaphoid is a quick reliable method to detect scaphoid fractures and to assess their healing without the need of cast removal."
CD010023,0,11347841,0,Kinematics of the wrist with a new dynamic external fixation device.,"The kinematic properties of a new dynamic external fixator device for treatment of distal radial fractures are described. Using a combination of data obtained from computed tomography scans and high-speed video images, a three-dimensional reconstruction of carpal motion was made. To describe carpal motion, the radiolunate, capitolunate, and scapholunate angles were measured during flexion and extension and during radioulnar deviation. During these types of motion, the device changed normal carpal kinematics to a limited extent although the differences in kinematic pattern with and without the device were small. The results for flexion and extension correspond with data from previously published studies with other dynamic external fixators. However, because the new device (Flexafix) allows flexion and extension and radioulnar deviation, in contrast to other dynamic external fixation devices, with its use normal carpal kinematics can be approached more closely."

CD010023,0,16324982,0,Upper extremity stress fractures.,"Although less common than lower-extremity stress fractures, upper-extremity stress fractures are becoming recognized much more frequently. A majority of these fractures are caused by overuse and fatigue of the surrounding musculature and, as a result, may be prevented by appropriate training and conditioning. Diagnosis is made by history and physical examination with the aid of plain radiographs, bone scans, and MRI. Most of these fractures heal with a period of relative rest followed by a structured rehabilitation program. A small percentage of these fractures, however, may require surgical fixation. The present article reviews the different types of upper extremity and torso stress fractures seen in athletes, starting with the sternum and extending outward to the fingers. The presentation, diagnosis, mechanism of injury, treatment, prevention, and prognosis for each of these injuries will be discussed."

There is a reported prevalence between 9 and 33% of occult scaphoid fractures. The evidence-based literature suggests that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most suitable secondary imaging modality due to the ability to evaluate the bone marrow directly and to also identify other injuries. However, there is no consensus on the choice of follow-up imaging strategy-computed tomography, MRI, or bone scan-across different institutions.

CD010023,0,2405337,0,Magnetic resonance imaging of injuries to bone and articular cartilage. Emphasis on radiographically occult abnormalities.,"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has emerged as the premier noninvasive imaging method for evaluation of the musculoskeletal system. Among the most widely recognized and accepted applications of MRI is that of trauma-related imaging. While the initial emphasis on MRI was directed toward the assessment of soft-tissue structures previously difficult to image (eg, knee menisci and cruciate ligaments), it has become increasingly apparent that MRI is superbly suited to the depiction of a wide spectrum of injuries to bone and articular cartilage. MRI has proved capable of depicting abnormalities ranging from clinically innocuous bone bruises to posttraumatic osteonecrosis. Many of the abnormalities that have been detected by MRI have been radiographically occult and often clinically unsuspected. MRI has become established in the assessment of chondral and osteochondral injuries, insufficiency and stress fractures, occult proximal femoral fractures, tibial plateau fractures, and scaphoid injuries. This review will attempt to present the current state of the art with respect to the application of MRI to the assessment of injuries to bone and articular cartilage. Particular emphasis will be placed on radiographically occult abnormalities."
CD010023,0,16149035,0,[Scaphoid fractures--operative or conservative treatment? A CT-based classification].,"Traditionally acute scaphoid fractures were treated by immobilization. As a consequence we have to deal with a high number of scaphoid non-unions or SNAC wrists. A study of 30 patients with scaphoid non-union showed that only 30% (9 patients) have not seen a doctor, while the majority of the patients (70%, 21 patients) were treated by a physician after trauma. In 15 (71.4%) of these 21 patients a missed diagnosis and in 6 (28.6%) a failed conservative treatment of the scaphoid fracture were the reasons for scaphoid non-union. Therefore, improvements in the diagnosis and therapy of scaphoid fractures are urgently needed. Herbert's classification of scaphoid fractures provides the underlying rationale for treatment according to the fracture type seen on X-ray. Differentiation between stable and unstable fractures sometimes is difficult from conventional X-rays. In these cases we recommend a CT bone scan in the long axis of the scaphoid. According to the CT scan we modified Herbert's classification: undisplaced waist fractures are classified as stable and can be treated conservatively or can be stabilized percutaneously using minimally invasive procedures. Comminuted or displaced fractures are classified as unstable and need operative treatment because of the increased risk of scaphoid non-union after plaster immobilization. Fractures of the proximal pole of the scaphoid should be treated operatively by internal fixation, even if they are not displaced, because of the reduced perfusion. We recommend a CT scan of the scaphoid, if there is any doubt about the diagnosis or the stability of the scaphoid fracture. In any case, a CT scan has to be ordered to justify a conservative treatment."
CD010023,0,18420064,0,[Bulge of the scapholunate ligament: an arthro-CT sign of traumatic scapholunate instability].,"Tears of the scapholunate ligament are usually diagnosed during an arthro-CT or arthro-MRI examination. Typically, the contrast agent passes from one joint to the other. In certain cases, fibrous scar tissue devoid of any mechanical effect may block the passage and lead to an erroneous interpretation of the images. We reviewed retrospectively patients who underwent arthroscopic treatment for scapholunate tears and who had normal arthro-CT images. We searched for specific aspects suggestive of ligament injury. Analysis of the arthro-CT images demonstrated that a bulge of the scapholunate ligament could be noted in patients whose diagnosis of scapholunate ligament injury was established arthroscopically. We propose that appropriate lecture of wrist images can identify scapholunate ligament injury in patients wrongly considered to be free of wrist injury, but who actually have an occult injury to the scapholunate ligament."

CD010023,0,15712982,0,Physeal bridge resection.,"Growth arrest secondary to physeal bridge formation is an uncommon but well-recognized complication of physeal fractures and other injuries. Regardless of the underlying etiology, physeal bridges may cause angular and/or longitudinal growth disturbances, with progression dependent on the remaining physeal growth potential. Physeal bridge resection and insertion of interposition material releases the tethering effect of the bridge. Physeal bridge resection has become an accepted treatment option for patients with existing or developing deformity and for those with at least 2 years or 2 cm of growth remaining. Current experimental research is focused on the use of gene therapy and other factors that enhance chondrocyte proliferation to improve the management of growth arrest. The use of cartilage and cultured chondrocytes as interposition material after physeal bridge resection is an area of active research."

A variety of vascularized bone grafts can be used.

CD010023,0,21885701,0,Perilunate dislocation and perilunate fracture-dislocation.,"Perilunate dislocations and perilunate fracture-dislocations usually result from high-energy traumatic injuries to the wrist and are associated with a characteristic spectrum of bony and ligamentous damage. Radiographic evaluation of the wrist reveals loss of normal radiocarpal and intercarpal colinearity and bony insult, which may be overlooked at the initial presentation. Prompt recognition is important to optimize outcomes. Closed reduction is performed acutely, followed by open reduction and ligamentous and bony repair with internal fixation. Complications include posttraumatic arthrosis, median nerve dysfunction, complex regional pain syndrome, tendon problems, and carpal instability. Despite appropriate treatment, loss of wrist motion and grip strength, as well as persistent pain, is common. Medium- and long-term studies demonstrate radiographic evidence of midcarpal and radiocarpal arthrosis, although this does not correlate with functional outcomes."

CD010023,0,17533093,0,Case studies in the diagnosis of upper extremity pain using magnetic resonance imaging.,"The diagnosis of upper extremity pain can be a daunting task for the examining physician. The differential diagnosis for pain at each level in the upper extremity is often extensive and diverse. Quite frequently, the clinical signs and symptoms of multiple pathologic conditions are overlapping and nonspecific. The decision to treat conservatively or with surgery often depends on the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings. MRI's ability to produce multiplanar images with excellent soft tissue contrast has made it an indispensable tool for diagnosis and treatment planning in patients with upper extremity pain. In most instances, MR imaging provides information that all other modalities cannot. This is all possible due to an incredible imaging device that creates magnificent images painlessly and with no known detrimental biological side effects. This article demonstrates only a small number of the possible causes of upper extremity pain that can be diagnosed with MR imaging. It is comforting to know that the vast majority of pathology causing pain in the upper extremity can be visualized with MRI scanning."

Radiographic, scintigraphic, and clinical assessments were performed throughout the follow-up period of 24 months. OP-1 improved the performance of both autologous and allogenic bone implants and reduced radiographic healing time to 4 weeks compared with 9 weeks in group 1. Helical CT scans and scintigraphy showed that in OP-1-treated patients sclerotic bone was replaced by well-vascularised bone. The addition of OP-1 to allogenic bone implant equalised the clinical outcome with the autologous graft procedure. Consequently the harvesting of autologous graft can be avoided."
CD010023,0,7211295,0,Fracture of the carpal scaphoid in children. A clinical and roentgenological study of 108 cases.,"A series of 108 carpal scaphoid fractures in children was analysed with respect to the site, type and treatment of the fracture. The patients were followed until radiological fusion occurred. All fractures united and healed completely with conservative treatment. Ninety-four fractures, 41 of which were avulsions, were located in the distal third of the scaphoid. There were 13 waist fractures, and one avulsion fracture was located in the proximal pole of the scaphoid. The great number of avulsion fractures and the location of the fractures in the distal third of the scaphoid is very typical in children. In three neglected cases marked bone resorption was seen on the fracture surface 3 weeks after the injury. Because non-union is possible especially in neglected cases of waist fractures, control radiographs should be taken 1 or 2 weeks after the injury if the fracture is not visible on the primary radiographs but is suspected clinically. Immobilization with an adequate plaster cast is mandatory in all transverse fractures of the carpal scaphoid in children."
CD010023,0,15354754,0,[Nutcracker fractures of the navicular and cuboid].,"Nutcracker fractures of the tarsal navicular and cuboid usually result from dislocations of the midtarsal (Chopart's) joint. The classic pathomechanism consists of forced adduction or abduction (medial or lateral stress) mostly in combination with axial force. The resulting injuries are frequently misjudged or underestimated with respect to their potential consequences for global foot function. Radiographic imaging includes plain radiographs in exact standard projections and computed tomographic scanning. Classification of Chopart fracture-dislocations is based on the proposed pathomechanics and the direction of the dislocating force. The goals of open reduction and stable internal fixation of Chopart fracture-dislocations are realignment of the medial and lateral columns of the foot, restoration of joint congruity and temporal transfixation in case of ligamentous instability to ensure proper ligament healing."
CD010023,0,1940172,0,Computed analyses of the pathomechanics of scaphoid waist nonunions.,"The computed tomography scans of both the injured and the normal wrists of nine patients with a scaphoid nonunion of 5 to 120 months' duration were used to create three-dimensional computer models. When the computer images of the normal and the contralateral fractured scaphoids were superimposed, it was possible to calculate the volume of bone that was lost as a result of the injury and its failure to heal, as well as the angular relationship of the fracture components to one another. The amount of the scaphoid bone that was lost varied from 6% to 15% of bone volume and did not show a linear correlation with the duration of the nonunion. The configuration of the missing bone was consistent and exhibited a prismatic shape whose base is quadrilateral and faces palmarly. The proximal scaphoid fracture component is extended, radially deviated, and supinated in relation to its distal fracture component. The consistent fracture deformity and the configuration of the bony defect in the scaphoid waist nonunions should be helpful in the understanding and treatment of the condition."
CD010023,0,17414993,0,Stress fractures in athletes.,"A stress fracture is a partial or complete bone fracture that results from repeated application of stress lower than the stress required to fracture the bone in a single loading. Otherwise healthy athletes, especially runners, sustain stress injuries or fractures. Prevention or early intervention is the preferable treatment. However, it is difficult to predict injury because runners vary with regard to biomechanical predisposition, training methods, and other factors such as diet, muscle strength, and flexibility. Stress fractures account for 0.7% to 20% of all sports medicine clinic injuries. Track-and-field athletes have the highest incidence of stress fractures compared with other athletes. Stress fractures of the tibia, metatarsals, and fibula are the most frequently reported sites. The sites of stress fractures vary from sport to sport (eg, among track athletes, stress fractures of the navicular, tibia, and metatarsal are common; in distance runners, it is the tibia and fibula; in dancers, the metatarsals). In the military, the calcaneus and metatarsals were the most commonly cited injuries, especially in new recruits, owing to the sudden increase in running and marching without adequate preparation. However, newer studies from the military show the incidence and distribution of stress fractures to be similar to those found in sports clinics. Fractures of the upper extremities are relatively rare, although most studies have focused only on lower-extremity injuries. The ulna is the upper-extremity bone injured most frequently. Imaging plays a key role in the diagnosis and management of stress injuries. Plain radiography is useful when positive, but generally has low sensitivity. Radionuclide bone scanning is highly sensitive, but lacks specificity and the ability to directly visualize fracture lines. In this article, we focus on magnetic resonance imaging, which provides highly sensitive and specific evaluation for bone marrow edema, periosteal reaction as well as detection of subtle fracture lines."

The aim of our study was to compare a dorsal versus volar surgical approach for PSF according to the sagittal orientation of the waist fracture (B1 or B2 in Herbert and Fisher's classification scheme, in which B1 and B2 designate, respectively, oblique and transverse nondisplaced scaphoid waist fractures) on computer modeling of cadaver wrists."
CD010023,0,16798139,0,Imaging of upper extremity stress fractures in the athlete.,"Although it is much less common than injuries in the lower extremities, an upper extremity stress injury can have a significant impact on an athlete. If an accurate and timely diagnosis is to be made, the clinician must have a high index of suspicion of a stress fracture in any athlete who is involved in a throwing, weightlifting, or upper extremity weight-bearing sport and presents with chronic pain in the upper extremity. Imaging should play an integral role in the work-up of these patients; if initial radiographs are unrevealing, further cross-sectional imaging should be strongly considered. Although a three-phase bone scan is highly sensitive in this regard, MRI has become the study of choice at most centers."
CD010023,0,19162696,0,A preliminary study on discrimination of osteoporotic fractured group from nonfractured group using support vector machine.,"Osteoporosis is characterized by an abnormal loss of bone mineral content, which leads to a tendency to non-traumatic bone fractures or to structural deformations of bone. Thus, bone density has been considered as a most reliable parameter to assess osteoporotic fracture risk. In past decades, by the way, bone texture measures have been studied to estimate other aspect of bone quality. Some studies have been performed on CT or MR images to assess bone quality using trabecular structure analysis. Other studies have been performed on plain x-ray images or ultrasound images to assess trabecular structure. However, most of the studies are focused on individual parameters to distinguish between osteoporotic fractured group and nonfractured group. In this preliminary study, we combine various texture parameters with bone density parameters using a support vector machine and point out the most promising combination of parameters to distinguish between osteoporotic fractured group and nonfractured group."

Two cases are reported in which an isolated fracture of the capitate was diagnosed with a 99mTc-MDP nuclear medicine bone scan and confirmed with CT scan or repeated conventional x-rays. These two cases illustrate that an isolated fracture of the capitate should be considered in an individual presenting with persistent wrist pain of traumatic origin, even when conventional x-ray views are negative. The nuclear medicine bone scan can be a useful investigative tool and serve to guide further radiological investigations."
CD010023,0,22582365,0,Current perspectives on the advantages of 3-T MR imaging of the wrist.,"The use of 3-T magnetic resonance (MR) imaging systems with improved coil designs and high-resolution MR imaging sequences allows visualization of the musculoskeletal anatomy in exquisite detail and accurate characterization of abnormalities both in soft tissues and in bone. Current high-field-strength MR systems offer particular advantages for diagnostic imaging of the small joints of the extremities, especially the wrists, where multiple overlapping soft-tissue structures may be visually inseparable at lower field strengths because of limited contrast resolution. Diagnostic accuracy obtained with 3-T MR imaging of the wrist performed with an acquisition protocol that includes three-dimensional and proton density-weighted imaging sequences is nearly commensurate with that obtained with MR arthrography. Abnormalities of the ligaments, tendons, cartilage, nerves, blood vessels, and bone are clearly depicted, allowing accurate characterization of perforations, tears, and fractures, as well as various soft-tissue and intraosseous lesions (eg, ganglion cysts), vascular malformations, aneurysms, and neuropathies."

Eight extensor tendons and one flexor tendon were entrapped. All fractures with extensor tendon entrapment were palmarly displaced (Smith type) or epiphyseal. Flexor tendon entrapment was seen in dorsally angulated (Colles type) epiphyseal fracture. The rate of tendon entrapment in acute distal radius fractures was 1.3%. Extensor tendon entrapment in palmarly displaced fractures is more common.

We show the advantages and comparative costs of this modified protocol versus a traditional protocol."
CD010023,0,19211381,0,Retrospective review of 234 scaphoid fractures and nonunions treated with arthroscopy for union and complications.,"The purpose of this paper is to retrospectively review 234 consecutive cases of scaphoid fractures and nonunions treated using arthroscopy with the dorsal percutaneous implantation of a headless compression screw for healing and complications. Solid union of fracture is determined by CT scan. We identified 126 acute injuries, including 65 proximal pole fractures; 67 grossly displaced fractures; 12 trans-scaphoid perilunate dislocations including four trans-scaphoid trans-capitate fractures; and ten combined scaphoid and distal radius fractures. 108 scaphoid nonunions were identified. 98 were correctly aligned and ten had a humpback deformity which was correctable using arthroscopic assisted reduction techniques at the time of surgery. 82 presented with a fracture gap 2mm or greater requiring percutaneous bone grafting. 12 cases of avascular necrosis (AVN) were identified by MRI. 20 nonunions had surgery performed at other institutions. The mean time to surgery for the nonunions was 20 months. 99% union rate of acute scaphoid fractures was obtained by 12 weeks, as determined by CT scan. Two complications were identified (3%). One case of delayed healing was identified. this delayed union was treated with percutaneous bone grafting and continued on to heal uneventfully. The other complication was a case of volar trans-scaphoid peri-lunate dislocation. While the fracture healed, the patient developed a traumatic dislocation requiring a capitate-lunate arthrodesis. Treatment of scaphoid nonunions resulted in ten cases of delayed healing, which were treated with repeat percutaneous bone grafting. This represented a 9% complication rate. of the ten cases of delayed unions that were re-bone grafted, four failed to heal by nine months. This resulted in a 96% union rate of our nonunion group by nine months. when acute fracture healing was compared to nonunions the average healing of acute fractures as determined by CT scanning measuring trabecular bridging was 12 weeks, while the average healing of non-unions was 22 weeks. We conclude that the dorsal percutaneous treatment of scaphoid fractures and nonunions using arthroscopy is safe and effective. CT scans to evaluate scaphoid healing by measuring trabecular bridging at the fracture site was determined to be an excellent modality to evaluate scaphoid healing. While not witnessed in this series, the potential for complications requires proper training."

Initial experiences with 1.0 Tesla (whole body-middle field equipment) versus 0.2 Tesla (dedicated low-field equipment)].,"The study was performed to determine the diagnostic value of different MR systems and field strengths in patients with occult scaphoid and wrist fractures. Twelve patients with clinical suspicion of a scaphoid fracture but normal plain radiographs were examined by MRI. A dedicated 0.2-T unit (Esaote) and a 1.0-T unit (NT10, Philips) were used. Coronal T1W-SE, STIR, and T2*W-GE sequences were obtained with both systems. Images were evaluated for a bone marrow abnormality, a trabecular or cortical fracture line, and were compared to the 6-week follow-up radiographs. Seven wrist fractures were found at 0.2 T and 1.0 T, proven in the follow-up radiographs. A bone marrow abnormality was present in all seven fractures on both systems. Trabecular and cortical fracture lines were visualized at 0.2 T in four cases and at 1.0 T in seven cases. Low-field MR imaging at 0.2 T and mid-field MR imaging at 1.0 T seem to be equivalent in the diagnosis of a fracture in radiographically occult scaphoid and wrist fractures. In the visualization of fracture details, important for therapeutic and prognostic considerations, 1.0 T seems to be superior."

This ligament consists of two slips that originate from the radiopalmar aspect of the scaphoid tuberosity and extend distally, forming a V shape. The ulnar fibers, which are just radial to the flexor carpi radialis sheath, inserted along the trapezial ridge. The radial fibers were found to be thinner and inserted at the radial aspect of the trapezium. Twelve fresh cadaver wrists were dissected, with close attention paid to the scaphotrapezio-trapezoidal (STT) joint. An osseoligamentous specimen was dissected with removal of all musculotendinous structures around the STT joint and was performed with high-resolution acquisition in a 128-MDCT scanner. Samples of the wrist area were collected from two fetal specimens. A retrospective study of 55 patients with wrist pain that were submitted to arthrography, arthro-CT, and arthro-MRI imaging was performed (10 patients on a 3-T superconducting magnet and 45 patients on a 1.5-T system). Another ten patients had high-resolution images on a 3-T superconducting magnet without arthrographic injection. MR arthrography and arthro-CT improved visualization and provided detailed information about the anatomy of the scaphotrapezial ligament. Knowledge of the appearance of this normal ligament on MRI allows accurate diagnosis of lesions and will aid when surgery is indicated or may have a role in avoiding unnecessary immobilization."

CD010023,0,10811757,0,Scaphoid nonunions: a 3-dimensional analysis of patterns of deformity.,"We tested the hypothesis that the fracture location of scaphoid nonunions relates to the fracture displacement, development of dorsal intercalated segment instability (DISI) deformity, and changes in the contact area of the bones in the radiocarpal joint. Eleven patients with scaphoid nonunions were examined with 3-dimensional computed tomography and a new method of proximity mapping. Two different patterns of displacement of scaphoid nonunions were demonstrated, 1 volar and 1 dorsal. All patients with a volar pattern scaphoid nonunion had a DISI deformity. Only a few of the patients with a dorsal pattern scaphoid nonunion, mostly in longstanding nonunions, had a DISI deformity. The fracture line was generally distal to the dorsal apex of the ridge of the scaphoid in the volar-type fractures and proximal in the dorsal displaced fractures. The proximity map of the distal fragment of the scaphoid on the radius in the volar type shifts radial compared with normal; in the distal type it shifts dorsal. Neither of the patterns showed any significant changes of the proximity map in the radiocarpal joint at the proximal scaphoid fragment and the lunate. Whether the fracture line passes distal or proximal to the dorsal apex of the ridge of the scaphoid appears to determine the likelihood of subsequent fracture displacement, DISI deformity, and contact area of the bones in the radiocarpal joint."

Five of the remaining 50 correctly palpated all surface markings. Six failed to accurately palpate even a single point. The scaphoid waist and trapezial ridge were accurately palpated by 47 surgeons. The median score for all participants was 3 correctly identified points. The majority of orthopaedic and accident and emergency surgeons do not perform an accurate physical examination of the carpal bones.

However, there has been more criticism recently, since this method neither prevents nor stops arthrosis of the wrist in the long term. Ligamental damage with carpal instability often remains untreated. The malposition and shortening of the scaphoid bone also remains uncorrected. Fifty-five patients in who Matti-Russe reconstruction was carried out to treat schaphoid non-union were followed up. The inclusion criteria were that there had been no preoperative arthrosis and no previous operations. The mean period of observation was 10.7 years. The results of the clinical and radiological investigation were compared with the preoperative findings; in addition, there was a control group with untreated scaphoid non-union. It was shown that arthrosis is demonstrable in 69% of the operated patients; in the unoperated patients, this was the case in 95%. Carpal instability was present in 47.1% of the operated patients. However, it does not affect the development of arthrosis. The time interval between accident and operation is crucial for this.

This report reviews the results of 36 consecutive bone scans performed for the suspected scaphoid injury and reviews radiographs taken on presentation. In all, 18 diagnosed fractures: there were three of the scaphoid, six of the distal radius and nine of other carpal bones. It was possible, with hindsight, to see eight fractures on the original radiographs. In patients with continued pain over the radial side of the carpus, attention should be given to the other carpal bones and the distal radius and not just the scaphoid."

CD010023,0,11450129,0,[Wrist trauma: diagnostic imaging].,"Wrist injury is common throughout life and, although history and physical examination provide important information regarding the type of lesion, a radiological study is essential to determine a specific diagnosis. Conventional radiography plays a central role in the wrist injuries but the diffusion of more sensitive methodics offers new possibilities. Our purpose is to evaluate the role of computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance (MR) and arthrography in wrist trauma. We retrospectively examined the images of 45 patients with wrist injuries: in every patients a radiological examination in 4 standard projections was executed while in 25, 9 and 11 patients CT,MR and arthrography were performed. On the basis of our findings we think that conventional radiography is often sufficient for diagnosis of bone lesions even if CT sometimes is required to detect subtle fractures. MR has an high sensitivity not only for abnormalities of soft tissues, including interosseous ligaments and triangular fibrocartilage, but also bony abnormalities such as occult fractures and early osteonecrosis. Arthrography still remains the best procedure for evaluating lesions of triangular fibrocartilage and intercarpal ligaments especially in a preoperative phase."

CD010023,0,17560406,0,Management of scaphoid nonunions.,"Scaphoid nonunions can exist with or without avascular necrosis of the proximal pole, and waist fractures may have an associated humpback deformity.

Operative treatment should be directed at correcting the deformity with open reduction and internal fixation and bone grafting. Vascularized bone grafts should be used in cases of avascular necrosis."
CD010023,0,19129358,0,The clinical outcome of scaphoid fracture malunion at 1 year.,"The aim of this study was to assess the effect of malunion of scaphoid fractures on the clinical outcome at 1 year. Forty-two consecutive patients with united scaphoid waist fractures which had been treated non-operatively underwent longitudinal CT scans to confirm union and assess malunion at 12 to 18 weeks after injury. A blind clinical assessment was made and the Patient Evaluation Measure (PEM) and DASH questionnaires were completed by all the patients 1 year after injury. The group consisted of 38 men and four women with a mean age of 31 years at the time of injury. Correlation analysis revealed no significant relationships between any of the outcome measures (range of motion, grip strength and PEM and DASH scores) and any of the three measures of malunion (height-to-length ratio, the dorsal cortical angle and the lateral intra-scaphoid angle)."
CD010023,0,22733954,0,Predictors of fracture following suspected injury to the scaphoid.,"A prospective study was performed to develop a clinical prediction rule that incorporated demographic and clinical factors predictive of a fracture of the scaphoid. Of 260 consecutive patients with a clinically suspected or radiologically confirmed scaphoid fracture, 223 returned for evaluation two weeks after injury and formed the basis of our analysis. Patients were evaluated within 72 hours of injury and at approximately two and six weeks after injury using clinical assessment and standard radiographs. Demographic data and the results of seven specific tests in the clinical examination were recorded. There were 116 (52%) men and their mean age was 33 years (13 to 95; SD 17.9). In 62 patients (28%) a scaphoid fracture was confirmed. A logistic regression model identified male gender (p = 0.002), sports injury (p = 0.004), anatomical snuff box pain on ulnar deviation of the wrist within 72 hours of injury (p < 0.001), and scaphoid tubercle tenderness at two weeks (p < 0.001) as independent predictors of fracture. All patients with no pain at the anatomical snuff box on ulnar deviation of the wrist within 72 hours of injury did not have a fracture (n = 72, 32%). With four independently significant factors positive, the risk of fracture was 91%. Our study has demonstrated that clinical prediction rules have a considerable influence on the probability of a suspected scaphoid fracture. This will help improve the use of supplementary investigations where the diagnosis remains in doubt."
CD010023,0,17996771,0,A biomechanical comparison of scaphoid fixation with bone grafting using iliac bone or distal radius bone.,"Although many scaphoid fractures may be treated by immobilization, complex scaphoid fractures generally require bone grafting with internal fixation. A preferred source of bone graft for scaphoid grafting is the iliac crest. Donor site morbidity from iliac crest harvest, however, is a known complication, and the comparable strength and osteogenic properties of bone harvested from other sites are unclear. To this end, we have conducted a cadaveric comparative investigation of the strength of scaphoid nonunions with bone graft and internal fixation using either iliac crest bone or distal radius bone."

CD010023,0,17335946,0,Scaphoid bone bruising--probably not the precursor of asymptomatic non-union of the scaphoid.,"The MRI finding of bone marrow oedema, without fracture, following trauma to the scaphoid has been called a 'bone bruise'. A similar injury is found in the knee, considered benign and managed conservatively. In the scaphoid, there is the concern that this lesion may lead to scaphoid non-union. This study addresses that concern. The clinical and radiological findings of 41 patients with a scaphoid bone bruise on MRI are described, an MRI classification system proposed and clinical outcomes investigated. Patients were immobilised for 6 weeks. At 3 months, 8 remained symptomatic and had repeat MRI. Four of these showed complete resolution of the bruise, the others improvement. At 6 months, 2 of the 8 complained of minor, intermittent discomfort but progressed to resolution of symptoms. This study suggests that the scaphoid bone bruise is a benign injury with predictable recovery and is unlikely to result in long-term morbidity in the form of non-union."
CD010023,0,7531477,0,"The palmar wrist ligaments revisited, clinical relevance.","In fifteen cadaver wrists and ten foetus wrists palmar ligaments were studied. As a result, the palmar scapho-triquetral ligament was presented by means of gross anatomical study, MR imaging, and histological study. A kinematic study was conducted on three cadaver wrists to analyze patterns of motion on the proximal carpal row bones based on the helical axis concept. Motion analysis showed that the scaphoid has a set of helical axes bundled at the radial side of the wrist. On the contrary, the triquetrum had axes bundled on the ulnar side, approximately in the same position as the lunate. That shows that the lunate and triquetrum are coordinated in motion and opposed to that of the scaphoid. The structure possibly ruling this pattern of motion could be the palmar scapho-triquetral ligament, whose insertions on the scaphoid and triquetrum are close to the crossing-point of the helical axes of the scaphoid and triquetrum/lunate, respectively. In order to study the clinical relevance of our findings, a prospective clinical study on 53 patients after wrist injury was conducted. All patients were clinically examined, simple and semi-stress X-rays were taken, and arthrography and arthroscopy performed. Ligament tears were often found, but any correlation to clinical findings or arthrography could not be found. However, high correlation could be found between the lesion of the palmar scapho-triquetral ligament and a DISI position of the lunate combined with increased scapho-lunate angle. It can be concluded that the tear of the palmar scapho-triquetral ligament causes instability pattern that is radiologically evident at an early stage.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD010023,0,3734063,0,Three-dimensional reformation of skeletal abnormalities using computed tomography.,A new technique for evaluation of skeletal pathology is described. The use of three-dimensional reformations based on conventional computed tomographic imaging is a technique that has been used by craniofacial surgeons since 1982 and more recently by orthopedic surgeons at the Adelaide (Australia) Children's Hospital for evaluation of pediatric skeletal pathology. Four cases are presented that demonstrate our early experience with the technique. Three-dimensional reformation is an effective method of translating conventional computed tomographic scans into a readily understood three-dimensional image. We believe that the method will be of increasing value in the evaluation of pediatric skeletal pathology.
CD010023,0,12132820,0,Surgical treatment results in scaphoid nonunion.,"Fracture of the scaphoid is the most common fracture in the wrist. We retrospectively reviewed 42 cases of established nonunion of the scaphoid that had been treated by four methods: with two Kirschner wires (K wires) and pronator quadratus pedicled bone graft in 5 patients; AO cannulated screw and graft in 8 patients; Herbert screw and graft in 19 patients; and two K wires and graft in 10 patients. Follow-up ranged from 1 to 5 years (between January 1995 and January 2000). Radiographs and computed tomography (CT) scans were analyzed for confirmation of osseous union. The average period of clinical and radiologic union was 13.2 weeks (range, 10 to 33 weeks). There was a significant improvement in the grasping power, radiologic healing, clinical satisfaction, and pain relief in the patients who had operation."

The mean age of the patients was 32 years (23 to 46) and the dominant wrist was affected in 14. The mean interval from fracture to the vascularised bone grafting was 39 months (9 to 62). Pre-operative MRI showed no contrast enhancement in the proximal fragment in any patient. Fracture union was assessed radiologically or with CT scans if the radiological appearances were inconclusive. At a mean follow-up of 5.6 years (2 to 11) union was obtained in 16 patients. The remaining five patients with a persistent nonunion continued to experience pain, reduced grip strength and limited range of wrist movement. In the successfully treated patients the grip strength and range of movement did not recover to match the uninjured side. Prevention of progressive carpal collapse, the absence of donor site morbidity, good subjective results and pain relief, justifies this procedure in the treatment of recalcitrant nonunion of the scaphoid."

CD010023,0,17097470,0,Carpal fractures excluding the scaphoid.,"Although carpal fractures other than of the scaphoid are uncommon, vigilance in diagnosing these potentially serious fractures is paramount to early and effective treatment. Physical examination and standard plain radiographs may reveal only subtle findings. Use of special radiographic views and computed tomography may help elucidate the diagnosis. Treatment is particular to each fracture. Nondisplaced fractures should be treated nonoperatively. For intra-articular carpal bone fractures, virtually any amount of displacement is unacceptable and requires reduction and fixation. This article organizes current knowledge of these potentially difficult fractures, with a table of diagnosis and treatment guidelines."
CD010023,0,6858656,0,Regional scintimetry in scaphoid fractures.,"A quantitative scintigraphic method was introduced to examine the proximal, middle and distal third of the carpal scaphoid bone. 99mTc-Sn-pyrophosphate scintimetry was obtained by the use of a gamma camera equipped with a pinhole collimator. Of six patients in whom a unilateral fresh fracture of the scaphoid was clinically suspected, radiology showed a fracture of the scaphoid in four and no fractures in two. The method may be suitable in early diagnosis and further localization of clinically suspected fractures with initially non-diagnostic radiographs."
CD010023,0,6576759,0,The role of bone scans in the assessment of prognosis of scaphoid fractures.,"Fifty patients with radiographic evidence of an acute scaphoid fracture were studied prospectively. Technetium bone scans were performed on all patients soon after injury in an attempt to detect fractures at risk of non-union or avascular necrosis. In three patients the scan showed a focal area of decreased radionuclide concentration in the region of the proximal pole of scaphoid implying avascularity, and each developed the radiographic signs of avascular necrosis. Two of these patients, each with a displaced fracture, developed non-union. Acute fractures of the scaphoid with evidence of avascularity on bone scan are at high risk of developing non-union."
CD010023,0,22745091,0,Concomitant avascular necrosis of the scaphoid and lunate.,Simultaneous avascular necrosis of multiple carpal bones is rare. Concomitant avascular necrosis of scaphoid and lunate has been reported only once. We report one more case of this rare condition which can be a cause of wrist pain. Steroid intake is a known risk factor for avascular necrosis but in our case the patient had been taking herbal medicines for joint pain the composition of which was not known. Probably the presence of steroid in these medicines was the cause of avascular necrosis in this case.
CD010023,0,9131939,0,[Fractures of the wrist with cartilage rupture in young adults. Apropos of 18 cases].,"Distal radius impaction fractures are not rare. They present a dual problem for the surgeon: the difficulty of establishing the exact pathological anatomy of the fracture, and of obtaining stable anatomic reduction. The authors report their experience of 18 distal radius impaction fractures in young patients after violent trauma (motor vehicle accident). We subdivided these fractures using Kapandji and Müller's classifications: 12 type 9 or C3, 4 type 5 or B1 and 2 type 4 or C1. The mean depth of impaction of the scaphoid fossa or lunate fossa (""die punch fracture""), or centrally was measured at 5 mm on preop X-rays or on CT scan. After radiographs of the wrist in traction under anaesthesia, open reduction was performed in 14 cases (78%). A volar approach with plate fixation was performed in 3 cases. A dorsal approach with internal fixation with k-wires and an external fixator was performed in the other 11 cases. A bone graft was necessary in 10 cases when the bone defect was significant. The four remaining patients were treated with percutaneous k-wires and external fixation. We reviewed these 18 patients after a mean follow-up of 27 months. The mean age at the time of the accident was 37 years. The results were graded on the Green and O'Brien scale. Results were excellent in 1 case, good in 11 cases, fair in 5 cases, and poor in 1 case. We believe that impaction fractures always require open reduction with or without the addition of bone graft depending on the degree of the impaction. This is because of the risk of arthritic degeneration with this kind of fracture, with articular incongruence (more than 2 mm), and with chondral injuries on the radial or the carpal aspect of the wrist joint. Also, when there is a distal radio-ulnar joint injury (D.R.U.J. dislocation or distal head ulna fracture), the joint must always be stabilized to avoid secondary displacement."

High-resolution MR imaging was performed on a 1.5-T unit (Symphony Quantum, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) using coronal and axial T1- and T2-weighted fat-saturated turbo-spin-echo sequence via a dedicated wrist coil within a mean of 6.6 days after initial radiographs in 54 patients (56 wrists) with clinical suspicion of wrist fractures and normal plain or indistinct radiographs. Initial radiographs were evaluated independently by two senior radiologists and the hand surgeon without knowledge of the MRI findings. The initial treatment protocol was based on evaluation of plain films and clinical findings by the hand surgeon. Treatment protocol was changed after MRI examination if necessary. In 31 of 56 wrists MRI findings resulted in a change of diagnosis. There were false-positive diagnoses on plain radiographs in nearly one half ( n=25) of the patients. False-negative diagnoses on plain radiographs resulted in 6 cases. Magnetic resonance imaging detected additional injuries of soft tissue in more than one third ( n=20). In 22 of 56 wrists the period of immobilization could be shortened or ended, in 12 of 56 it was prolonged, and in 3 of 56 a surgical intervention was necessary. In 19 wrists MRI had no therapeutic consequences. Our data demonstrate the high clinical impact of MRI in the detection of acute wrist fractures. We recommend MRI of the wrist immediately on the day of trauma if there is clinical suspicion and normal plain radiographs. Accurate diagnosis by MRI examination within the first days following trauma may reduce economic costs due to shortened immobilization time in cases with a suspected fracture but plain radiographs."

The Ulster Museum obtained the mummy hand, which originated from Thebes, without any identifying information. The mummified hand was investigated using conventional X-ray and 3D multi-slice Computed Tomography (CT). Imaging revealed a range of fractures of the wrist, metacarpals and phalanges whilst 3D CT demonstrated internal structures using volume rendering. The absence of any features of bone healing at the fracture sites would imply that they occurred just prior to death or in the mummified state possibly during excavation. Conventional X-ray imaging indicated that the hand, although small, was likely to have originated from an adult. Medical imaging and virtual reality display will enable us to produce a rapid prototyped model using fused deposition technology. Therefore, further paleopathological research can be performed on the replica without the need to handle the original specimen."

In the case of bone injury, spiral computer tomography with multiplanar reformatting is currently the method of choice. MRI is indicated for the identification of soft tissue or ligamentous injury and avital fragments or necrosis. Other diagnostic tools for the wrist are currently of minor importance.

Inactivity-induced osteoporosis plays a major role during the immobilization period in the plaster cast. In the region of the joints remodelling intensity may reach such a high level that the non-injured bone shows a higher rate of accumulation than the fracture. This process already begins between the third and fourth week of immobilization. The highest uptake is found after fracture of the scaphoid bone at the end of twelve weeks of immobilization. Control scintigraphies at intervals of several days are indicated to differentiate between various clinical conditions (pseudoarthrosis, activated osteoarthrosis, algodystrophy in case of doubtful x-ray results)."
CD010023,0,12228796,0,Trans-Atlantic hospital agreement in reading first day radiographs of clinically suspected scaphoid fractures.,"The purpose of this study was to describe the agreement between two hospitals on either side of the Atlantic Ocean in reading first day plain radiographs of suspected scaphoid fractures. Two groups of observers, one North American and one European, consisting of observers at various levels of training were compared. Kappa statistics were used to determine inter- and intra-observer agreement. The receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) curves and area under this curve (AUC) for each observer were calculated to determine test performance. Scaphoid radiographs of 80 consecutive patients seen with clinically suspected scaphoid fracture were included in the study. The results of the bone scan were used as the reference standard. There is an acceptable agreement between the USA and Europe for both radiologists and orthopaedic surgeons at various levels of training (kappa 0.45-0.88). Intra-observer agreement is acceptable as well (kappa 0.46-0.86). Considering all normal or equivocal radiographs, there is slight to moderate agreement at all levels of training in and between both centres and specialities (kappa 0-0.64). Overall test performance was acceptable for all consecutive radiographs (AUC 0.65-0.82) and poor for the normal radiographs (AUC 0.46-0.65). We could not detect differences in performance due to location of the readers' hospital or institution of training. The use of more sensitive techniques should be restricted to patients with negative or equivocal radiographs in clinically suspected scaphoid fractures."
CD010023,0,1582612,0,[Computerized tomography diagnosis of scaphoid fracture and pseudarthrosis in comparison with roentgen image].,"Twenty eight patients with fourteen acute scaphoid fractures and fourteen with scaphoid non-union were examined with standard X-rays in two planes, special scaphoid projections and computed tomography. Nine scaphoid fractures were revealed by both standard X-rays and CT, whereas four fractures could only be detected by CT. Computed tomography should be used when there is clinical suspicion of scaphoid fracture but standard radiographs remain negative. All carpal bones should be examined. Fourteen patients with suspected scaphoid non-union were examined. In twelve patients, scaphoid non-union seemed to be complete in standard X-rays, whereas CT showed a bony bridge between the proximal and distal fragment. Another patient showed bony union. Two patients showed no non-union in standard X-rays. One was confirmed after a Matti-Russe procedure, but the bone graft was dislocated, causing restricted wrist motion. One scaphoid non-union was demonstrated by CT. Two patients showed signs of additional carpal fractures. Diagnostic applications of CT for scaphoid non-union include the determination of the exact location of the fragments and the evaluation of post-traumatic cysts, thus simplifying pre-operative planning."

Most are monotraumatic occurring during sport or leisure activities. Diagnosis can be made by conventional X-ray examination in 2 planes. Distal forearm fractures are classified into epiphyseolysis and epiphyseal fractures, metaphyseal greenstick and buckle fractures, complete distal radius and forearm fractures as well as Galeazzi lesions. The vast majority of cases without relevant dislocation can be treated with immobilization employing a cast. The remaining fractures have to be repositioned and restored depending on age and degree of dislocation.The state of the art in surgical therapy is the Kirschner wire osteosynthesis after closed reduction. Especially meta-diaphyseal fractures can alternatively be stabilized with plate osteosynthesis or external fixation. Following these therapeutic principles, prognosis is excellent and most of the injuries heal without any functional impairment."

CD010023,0,10719103,0,Fifteen minutes bone scintigraphy in patients with clinically suspected scaphoid fracture and normal x-rays.,"Occult fractures of the scaphoid bone occur frequently and may lead to non-union. The use of three-phase bone scintigraphy in patients with normal x-rays of the scaphoid after carpal injury is widely advocated.In this study, 40 patients with negative radiographs but clinically suspected scaphoid fracture, all had rapid bone scintigraphy with images taken 15 min after intravenous injection of 99 m-Technetium Hydroxymethylene diphosphonate. The scan was performed approximately 2 weeks after the trauma. We found 8 fractures of the scaphoid bone and 13 fractures of other carpal bones. In 5 cases the images were inconclusive. At follow-up 6 months to 2 years later we found no patients with non-union. We find this rapid version of the bone scan useful as a second line investigation for continuing wrist pain following trauma in the presence of normal radiography. This can result in a reduction in both time and costs required for the diagnostic process. If the results are inconclusive we recommend a delayed image. CT or MRI could also be considered.

CD010023,0,15336746,0,Gadolinium enhanced MR assessment of proximal fragment vascularity in nonunions after scaphoid fracture: does it predict the outcome of reconstructive surgery?,"This study investigated whether the outcome of bone graft and internal fixation surgery for nonunion of scaphoid fractures could be predicted by gadolinium-enhanced MR assessments of proximal fragment vascularity. Sixteen established scaphoid fracture nonunions underwent gadolinium-enhanced MR scanning before surgical treatment with bone grafting and internal fixation. No relationship was found between MR enhancement and the outcome of surgery. Union was achieved in eight of the 12 nonunions with more than 50% enhancement, and three of the four with less than 50% enhancement, of the proximal pole. Furthermore, union was achieved in both of the nonunions which had less than 25% enhancement of the proximal pole. We conclude that enhanced MR assessments of the vascularity of the proximal fragment of a scaphoid fracture nonunion do not accurately predict the outcome of reconstructive surgery."

In none of these radiographs was a fracture line demonstrated by people who did not know the outcome. In 4 patients with proven fracture, normal scaphoid fat pads were demonstrated; a 10% 'false negative' result and in 9 patients without fracture, abnormal scaphoid fat pads were seen; a 23% 'false positive' result. The authors conclude that the scaphoid fat pad sign is a poor predictor of scaphoid fracture, even though a positive scaphoid fat pad sign indicates that an underlying fracture is likely."

CD010023,0,15368727,0,Diagnosis and management of scaphoid fractures.,"Scaphoid fracture is a common injury encountered in family medicine. To avoid missing this diagnosis, a high index of suspicion and a thorough history and physical examination are necessary, because early imaging often is unrevealing. Anatomic snuffbox tenderness is a highly sensitive test for scaphoid fracture, whereas scaphoid compression pain and tenderness of the scaphoid tubercle tend to be more specific. Initial radiographs in patients suspected of having a scaphoid fracture should include anteroposterior, lateral, oblique, and scaphoid wrist views. Magnetic resonance imaging or bone scintigraphy may be useful if the diagnosis remains unclear after an initial period of immobilization. Nondisplaced distal fractures generally heal well with a well-molded short arm cast. Although inclusion of the thumb is the standard of care, it may not be necessary. Nondisplaced proximal, medial, and displaced fractures warrant referral to an orthopedic subspecialist."

Surgeons performing these procedures need to be familiar with the anatomy of the scaphoid. A literature review reveals relatively few articles on this subject. The goal of this anatomical study was to measure the scaphoid using current technology and to discuss the findings with respect to the current, relevant literature.Computed tomography scans of 30 wrists were performed using a 64-slice SOMATOM Sensation CT system (resolution 0.6 mm) (Siemens Medical Solutions Inc, Malvern, Pennsylvania). Three-dimensional reconstructions from the raw data were generated by MIMICS software (Materialise, Leuven, Belgium). The scaphoid had a mean length of 26.0 mm (range, 22.3-30.7 mm), and men had a significantly longer (P<.001) scaphoid than women (27.861.6 mm vs 24.561.6 mm, respectively). The width and height were measured at 3 different levels for volume calculations, resulting in a mean volume of 3389.5 mm(3). Men had a significantly larger (P<.001) scaphoid volume than women (4057.86740.7 mm(3) vs 2846.56617.5 mm(3), respectively).We found considerable variation in the length and volume of the scaphoid in our cohort. We also demonstrated a clear correlation between scaphoid size and sex. Surgeons performing operative fixation of scaphoid fractures and corticocancellous bone grafting for nonunions need to be familiar with these anatomical variations."

Location of the articular defect was dorsal in two cases and volar in the others. The approach (dorsal or volar) depended on the main location of the defect. A costal cartilage graft harvested on the eighth rib was implanted in a trough created at the epiphysis metaphyseal junction. This trough removed the defective area on the distal radius articular surface. A plate or wire fixation was used to stabilize in place the graft. Plaster cast wear was prescribed for 3 months in the first case and for 1 month in the other cases following joint reconstruction. No complications were observed. Union was achieved in all seven cases. Graft integration and viability were evaluated with MRI and biopsy. At the longest follow-up, the functional results were excellent in the first (youngest) case (male, 22 years old) in whom motion and grasp were similar to the contralateral side. In the other cases of malunion, the patients were pain-free in daily activities with a functional wrist score of 72/100 (range, 54-82) and a DASH score of 38.3 (range, 22.5-51.7). Only the case with a septic problem failed, with pain reported at follow-up. Reconstruction of a partially destroyed articular surface using a costal graft is reliable and allows filling and resurfacing an articular cartilage void. Although costal cartilage graft is currently used in maxillofacial surgery, this is the first report in post-traumatic osteoarthritis secondary to intra-articular malunion."

The first 42 patients were re-X-rayed 10 days after injury: bone scanning had identified all fractures confirmed on this X-ray; there were no false negative bone scans. Sixty-seven patients (60%) did not have increased focal uptake over the scaphoid or distal radius, and were mobilised immediately. None of these had a fracture at follow up. Twenty-nine patients with increased uptake over the scaphoid area (26%) remained in plaster of Paris for 6 weeks. All of these had clinical signs of a scaphoid injury. Bone scanning is a practical investigation for all X-ray-negative potential scaphoid injuries, and is acceptable to patient and clinician. In the presence of a normal scan, the practice of re-X-raying patients 10 days after injury may be abandoned."

Eighty-four patients that had CT scans within 14 days from injury were identified. Of the CT scans, 64% (n = 54) excluded a fracture and these patients were promptly mobilized. No patients returned with any complications from this management. Overall, 36% of CT scans were abnormal (n = 30), 7% revealed occult scaphoid fractures, 18% revealed occult carpal fractures of the triquetrum, capitate, and lunate, respectively, and 5% revealed distal radius fractures. All patients diagnosed with fractures were successfully managed with plaster immobilization and there was one case of complex regional pain syndrome. Early CT alters therapeutic decision making in suspected occult fractures preventing unnecessary immobilization in a working population without increase in cost."

Methods Compare costs of patients presenting acutely with suspected scaphoid injuries (managed either with traditional follow-up radiographs and plasters) versus early MRI to exclude a fracture. Results The average medical cost for the control group was NZ470 dollars versus NZ533 dollars in the MRI group. The cost to exclude a fracture was NZ437 dollars with MRI versus NZ459 dollars for the traditional protocol. Weekly compensation costs were comparable. Conclusions The early diagnosis of clinical scaphoid fractures has clear clinical advantages.

CD010023,0,10669828,0,[Primary carpal bone defect].,"We present a review of management options in case of carpal bone defect, a relatively frequent discovery. In the literature, diagnosis is usually a fortuitous radiographic finding showing one or several images of carpal defect. Pain is observed in some cases, more exceptionally pathological fracture. The scaphoid, lunatum and hamatum are most frequently involved. Bilateral defects may be observed. Different mechanisms have been put forward to explain the development of intraosseous defects in the carpal bones including intraosseous penetration of synovial tissue, or in situ metaplasia of bone tissue. The main differential diagnoses are osteonecrosis sequellae (for the lunatum and the scaphoid), subchondral defects due to hyperpression and arthropathies in dialysis patients. All authors propose simple surveillance for asymptomatic images. In case of pain, with soft tissue swelling or pathological fractures, filling-excision is warranted depending on the severity of the clinical signs. Prognosis is generally good and recurrence exceptional."

Two strategies were compared for patients with initial negative radiographs: repeated radiography versus selective bone scintigraphy. Using the known positive predictive value of scintigraphy, the sensitivity and specificity of both diagnostic strategies were evaluated in a series of 78 consecutive patients. The kappa value for initial radiographs was 0.76 but decreased to 0.5 for follow-up radiographs. Similarly, sensitivity decreased from 64% to 30% in follow-up radiographs. Specificity of the bone scan was 98%.

CD010023,0,19756904,0,Diagnosing suspected scaphoid fractures: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Imaging protocols for suspected scaphoid fractures among investigators and hospitals are markedly inconsistent. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess and compare the diagnostic performance of bone scintigraphy, MRI, and CT for diagnosing suspected scaphoid fractures. Twenty-six studies were included. Sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic odds ratio were pooled separately and summary receiver operating characteristic curves were fitted for each modality. Meta-regression analyses were performed to compare these modalities. We obtained likelihood ratios derived from the pooled sensitivity and specificity and, using Bayes' theorem, calculated the posttest probability by application of the tests. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, natural logarithm of the diagnostic odds ratio, and the positive and negative likelihood ratios were, respectively, 97%, 89%, 4.78, 8.82, and 0.03 for bone scintigraphy; 96%, 99%, 6.60, 96, and 0.04 for MRI; and 93%, 99%, 6.11, 93, and 0.07 for CT. Bone scintigraphy and MRI have equally high sensitivity and high diagnostic value for excluding scaphoid fracture; however, MRI is more specific and better for confirming scaphoid fracture. We believe additional studies are needed to assess diagnostic performance of CT, especially paired design studies or randomized controlled trials to compare CT with MRI or bone scintigraphy."

CD010023,0,7624564,0,MR imaging of the major carpal stabilizing ligaments: normal anatomy and clinical examples.,"The integrity of the ligamentous network of the wrist is critical, as disruption of this network may result in carpal instability and pain. The extrinsic (radiocarpal) and intrinsic (intercarpal) ligaments that maintain carpal stability can be evaluated with magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. The major extrinsic ligaments are the radioscaphocapitate, radiolunotriquetral, short radiolunate, and dorsal radiocarpal ligaments. The scapholunate and lunotriquetral ligaments are the most important intrinsic ligaments and the primary wrist stabilizers. The most common causes of carpal instability are unstable fracture of the scaphoid, scapholunate dissociation, and lunotriquetral dissociation. Carpal instability can be diagnosed from the sagittal MR image that includes the capitate, lunate, and radius and from the sagittal MR image that includes the scaphoid and radius. Knowledge of the MR imaging appearances of the major carpal stabilizing ligaments and common patterns of carpal instability allows more precise diagnosis in cases of wrist pain."

Eight patients (2 males, 6 females) with radiographic and bone scan confirmed tibial stress fractures participated in this study. Additionally, a case report of a tarsal navicular stress fracture is described. All patients except one were involved in athletics. Prior to the study, subjects completed a 5 question, 10 cm visual analog scale (VAS) regarding pain level (10 = extreme pain, 1 = no pain) and were assessed for functional performance. Subjects received 20-minute LIUS treatments 5 times a week for 4 weeks. Subjects maintained all functional activities during the treatment period. Seven patients with posterior-medial stress fractures participated without a brace. Subjects were re-tested after 4 weeks of treatment. Mann-Whitney U tests (VAS data) and paired t-tests (functional tests) assessed statistical significance (p<0.05). Although the intensity of practice was diminished in some instances, no time off from competitive sports was prescribed for the patients with the tibial stress fractures. The patient with the anterior tibial stress fracture underwent tibial intramedullary nailing at the conclusion of a season of play. In this uncontrolled experience, treatment of tibial stress fractures with daily pulsed LIUS was effective in pain relief and early return to vigorous activity without bracing for the patients with posterior-medial stress fractures."

Blood flow to the proximal poles of 32 nonsurgically treated scaphoid fractures were assessed 1 to 2 weeks after injury by measuring their uptake of gadopentetate dimeglumine with dynamic magnetic resonance imaging and calculating its steepest slope and percentage of enhancement values. Initial (week 0) and week 8 scaphoid series radiographs were independently assessed by 2 observers for increased proximal pole density; both agreed that the density had increased during treatment in 9 fractures. All 9 fractures united, suggesting that increased proximal pole density is not a major determinant of fracture outcome. Increased density of the proximal pole was associated with low proximal pole blood flow, but this relationship was not absolute, suggesting that other factors contribute to the appearance of increased density."

CD010023,0,12015717,0,The sensitivity of carpal bone indices to rotational malpositioning.,"We investigated the dependence of 20 radiographic carpal measurements (carpal indices) on rotational positioning errors in posteroanterior and lateral radiographs. The measurements were made from ""true perspective"" digitally reconstructed radiographs created from computed tomography data. Most posteroanterior indices were not affected by rotation. Carpal height, carpal height ratio, revised carpal height ratio, capitate-radius distance, and carpal ulnar translocation were particularly robust. Lateral-view indices involving the scaphoid were the most sensitive to simulated malpositioning: radioscaphoid, scapholunate, and scaphocapitate angles were reduced from 58 degrees, 48 degrees, and 56 degrees at true lateral to 30 degrees, 24 degrees, and 34 degrees, respectively, at 20 degrees external rotation. Observers were unable to estimate the degree of malpositioning accurately in either view.

CD010023,0,3495968,0,CT for determining the results of treatment of fractures of the wrist.,"Eighteen CT examinations of the wrist were performed in 13 patients to evaluate the results of treatment for carpal fractures. In four cases with metal objects and in seven with cast materials, there was no difficulty achieving adequate CT studies. In 13 cases CT was found to be helpful in determining bony union in the presence of advanced osteoporosis. In six cases CT was excellent in evaluating bone-graft incorporation. CT affords improved detection of fractures perpendicular to the plane of the scan and also shows small areas of bone disruption, even with osteoporosis. Axial CT images can evaluate Lister's tubercle, a bony prominence on the dorsum of the distal radius, for hypertrophy, which can occur secondary to traumatic and degenerative changes. A hypertrophied tubercle can impinge on the extensor pollicis longus tendon and cause atrophy and disruption. The high cost of CT is offset by the possibility of reducing the patient's period of immobilization and, thereby, the length of time the patient is unable to participate in normal activities. In addition, since CT is often definitive, the number of supplemental or follow-up radiologic procedures or clinical appointments should be reduced. We conclude that CT is useful in evaluating the results of treatment of wrist injuries."
CD010023,0,10857066,0,"[Does low intensity, pulsed ultrasound speed healing of scaphoid fractures?].","Since pulsed low-intensity ultrasound (frequency: 1.5 MHz, pulsed by 1 kHz, signal burst width: 200 microseconds, intensity: 30 mW/cm2) has been proven to stimulate fracture healing both clinically and experimentally, our question was whether this therapy also accelerates healing of fresh stable scaphoid fractures. Addressing this question, we did the following prospective randomized clinical trial. Regarding the results of former clinical fresh fracture studies by Heckman and Kristiansen, we postulated that low intensity ultrasound accelerates healing by about 30%. Based on this thesis, we calculated that 30 patients divided into two groups would be necessary to show significant differences between the standard treatment (treated by casting) and an adjunctive ultrasound treatment (treated by casting and additional daily 20 minutes ultrasound treatment) if present. Diagnosis and healing was assessed by CT scans every two weeks. CT's were analyzed by two independent radiologists and one hand surgeon. Furthermore, areas of cancellous bone bridging in correlation to the diameter of the scaphoid was measured in each CT scan. The results showed ultrasounded fractures healing in 43.2 +/- 10.9 days versus 62 +/- 19.2 days in the control group (p < 0.01). Trabecular bridging six weeks after injury showed 81.2% +/- 10.4% healed in the ultrasound-stimulated fractures versus 54.6% +/- 29% in the control (p < 0.05). Our study results confirm those of Heckman and Kristiansen and show a similar acceleration of bone healing. Low intensity ultrasound is successful in accelerating the healing of fresh scaphoid fractures."

CD010023,0,18528238,0,Minimal invasive screw fixation and early mobilization of acute scaphoid fractures in the middle third: operative technique and early functional outcome.,"Fractures of the scaphoid are relatively common injuries. Differentiation between stable and unstable fractures (Herbert classification) cannot always be made with conventional radiographs and should be additionally evaluated by computed tomographic scan. Under most circumstances, minimal invasive surgery with cannulated screws is currently the treatment of choice. Cast immobilization is not necessary. This article describes the technique of fracture fixation in the middle third of the scaphoid from a palmar approach and early functional outcomes. The outcome assessment included measurement of active range of motion as well as grip strength and the Disability of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand questionnaire as a measurement of activities of daily living. Fifty-four patients with acute scaphoid fractures were treated with minimal invasive screw fixation between April 2001 and January 2005. All patients in this retrospective study received a preoperative computed tomographic scan before surgery. Bony consolidation was found in 52 cases after 6 weeks; 2 patients required reosteosyntheses. The results demonstrate that minimal invasive screw fixation leads to satisfying functional outcomes within a few weeks."

However, currently there is no information about which degree of deformity or malalignment can be tolerated without impairing clinical function. The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of the scaphoid morphology and carpal alignment on clinical outcomes after scaphoid reconstruction. A total of 65 patients with an average age of 29 years were followed-up after a mean period of 45 months. In all patients, osseous union after a first-time scaphoid reconstruction in the middle third had been confirmed. Scapholunate (SL) and radiolunate (RL) angles were obtained on plain radiographs as were intrascaphoid (ISA) and dorsal cortical (DCA) angles and the height/length (H/L) ratio of the reconstructed scaphoid on computed tomography (CT) scans. These parameters were correlated with clinical outcome measures. RL angles correlated significantly with wrist range of motion, grip strength and pain levels, whilst SL angles, ISA, DCA and H/L ratio failed to show significant correlations. Our data suggest that clinical outcome is correlated with correct restoration of bone morphology and carpal alignment. After reconstruction, the RL angle should not exceed 10°."

Linear tomography is the simplest method but produces images that appear streaked. Zonotomography, which uses an elliptical or figure-8 movement of the x-ray tube, creates a uniform blurring of structures and a much clearer resolution of the plane of focus.

CD010023,0,1784503,0,Central pain and thalamic hyperactivity: a single photon emission computerized tomographic study.,"Five patients with central post-stroke pain (CPSP) accepted to be studied according to the following paradigm: a single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) using [123I]N-isopropyl-iodoamphetamine (IMP) was made in each patient 20 min following i.v. injection of IMP; during this time, the patients were stimulated in order to reproduce their spontaneous pain. Of the five patients, two had CPSP with hyperpathia following a stroke (with a lesion on CT scan involving the thalamo-cortical pathway in one and involving the thalamus in the other); two had CPSP following a stroke in the middle cerebral artery area, without hyperpathia; and the last patient suffered pain from algodystrophia following a fracture of the wrist. In the two cases with hyperpathia, SPECT demonstrated a contralateral relative hyperactivity in a central region corresponding to the thalamic area. This was not observed in the three other patients. In the two patients with hyperpathia, a second SPECT scan with stimulation of the contralateral pain-free arm did not demonstrate any hyperactivity in the thalamic area. These results suggest that a thalamic neuronal hyperactivity may characterize some hyperpathic syndromes and, in accordance with our previous results obtained in the rat, that the loss of inhibition on medial thalamic neurons may be a main feature of hyperpathia following certain cerebral stroke syndromes."

CD010023,0,22094152,0,"Current concepts review: carpal injuries - fractures, ligaments, dislocations.","An overview about current concepts in treating carpal injuries is presented. These injuries are more commonly seen in young, active individuals after a fall on an outstretched hand. Conventional radiographs and a thorough examination are important. The scaphoid is the most affected bone. Scaphoid fractures can be classified in accordance to OTA, AO, and other classification systems, but mostly to Herbert. It can be treated non-operatively if undisplaced, however a percutaneous internal fixation can be discussed to achieve earlier return to work and shorter time to union, but hazarding the consequences of an operation. Unstable, proximal pole, or delayed diagnosed scaphoid fractures should be treated surgically. Nonunion is seen in 5 - 40% of scaphoid fractures depending mainly on displacement and localization of the fracture. The gold standard in non-osteoarthritic scaphoid nonunion is debridement of the nonunion site, bone grafting, realignment, stable fixation and rehabilitation. The treatment of scaphoid-nonunion advanced collapse is more complex. Proximal row carpectomy or arthrodesis (four-corner or complete wrist) can be mandatory. Other carpal bone fractures are rare. Perilunate dislocations are also uncommon but can be disabling. They usually originate in high-energy trauma. The Mayfield stages help to understand the injury pattern. Open reduction through both volar and dorsal approaches, repair of the volar capsule as well as volar and dorsal ligaments, and internal fixation is commonly the standard treatment. However osteoarthritis and carpal instability are often encountered."

Twenty pairs of cadaver wrists were examined and anthropometric analysis of the scaphoids using plain radiography, computed tomography, and en bloc resection was performed. Scaphoid vascularity was evaluated using India ink injection. Radiographic and actual measurements of height and width confirmed symmetry in paired scaphoids. Anatomic evaluation defined a safe zone for screw placement. K-wire placement defined the extent of this zone. The entry point of this zone was found by moving dorsally and distally 15% of the lateral radiographic length of the contralateral scaphoid from the volar aspect of the scaphoid tuberosity. Moving 10% of this same length from the membranous central portion of the scapholunate ligament defined the target site.

Four radiologists, of varying experience, independently reviewed the radiographs on a conventional lightbox and later with the digitizer. In the scaphoid series (350 cases), the performance of the two more experienced radiologists was marginally better with the digitizer, whereas the less experienced radiologists performed slightly worse. Overall the digitizer improved the confidence of the radiologists in diagnosing correctly the presence of a scaphoid fracture but, for the less experienced radiologists, this was at the expense of identifying normality. In the wrist series (200 cases), the use of the digitizer resulted in a minor increase in the true positive and decrease in the false negative observations, but this was offset by a concomitant minor increase in the false positive and decrease in the true negative categories. Evaluation of the soft-tissue planes around the wrist joint showed a limited value in the identification of a scaphoid fracture with an overall positive predictive value of 0.26. Correlation of soft-tissue changes and the presence or absence of a scaphoid fracture was slightly worse with the digitizer. Possible causes for the apparently poorer performance of the digitizer are discussed, as well as the relative merits and potential value of the unit."

The fracture was united by six weeks despite resumption of training eight days postoperatively. Subsequently, the patient presented with pain over the flexor carpi radialis (FCR) tendon together with reduction of wrist flexion strength suggested an FCR tendonitis. A CT scan with injection eliminated the diagnosis of non-union and showed protrusion of the distal end of the screw. After the failure of conservative treatment (corticosteroid injection), removal of the screw and synovectomy of the FCR were scheduled. During the procedure, attrition of the FCR tendon with scar tissue and metal inclusions in its fibres were observed. A visual examination of the screw's distal end showed a distortion of its hexagonal outline due to hammering, leading to metal projection likely to have caused the FCR tendon's attrition. We recommend the systematic burying of these canulated screws as well as changing any screw damaged during its insertion."

CD010023,0,16934205,0,Treatment of acute scaphoid fractures in the athlete.,"Scaphoid fractures in athletes can be very disabling and may limit successful and early return to play. Typically, the mechanism of injury is a fall onto an outstretched hand or a direct blow; the patient will present with swelling, limited motion, and snuffbox tenderness. Multiple-view plain images will very often reveal the diagnosis. In addition, diagnostic modalities such as CT scanning and MRI are helpful in better defining the architecture of the fracture and vascularity of the scaphoid, and diagnosing occult fractures. Early and accurate diagnosis is critical to help ensure appropriate treatment and optimal outcome. Traditional treatment of stable nondisplaced fractures remains cast immobilization. However, if early return to play is desired operative fixation may be warranted. For nondisplaced fractures operative techniques include open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF), and percutaneous fixation through a dorsal or volar approach. Arthroscopy can be used as an adjunct to the percutaneous technique. For displaced fractures, the preferred technique remains ORIF through either a volar or dorsal approach. Considerations in treatment type are based on the stability and location of the fracture as well as patient issues such as compliance and the need for return to play. With appropriate diagnosis and individualization of treatment, scaphoid fractures can be successfully managed in most athletes with few or no long-term sequelae."

Most examinations used the same protocol: contiguous 1.5-mm axial sections parallel to the long axis of the body of the scaphoid, small reconstruction circle, and bone reconstruction algorithm. Fifteen patients were evaluated for union of previous surgical carpal fusions; eight patients were evaluated for healing of scaphoid fractures; and the other four patients had miscellaneous disorders, including a midcarpal dislocation with a scaphoid fracture. High-resolution CT clearly showed whether the carpal fusions were united. In addition, metallic fixation devices were easy to locate and did not significantly degrade image quality. Osseous union of healing scaphoid fractures was reliably assessed. We conclude that high-resolution CT of the wrist is a useful method for evaluating surgical carpal fusions and various disorders of the scaphoid."

Computed tomography (CT), bone scan and MRI improve the sensitivity of the diagnosis. Non-displaced fractures of the scaphoid are treated with cast immobilization in most cases. Operative treatment should be considered in displaced fractures or non-displaced fractures in young active patients by using internal fixation with cannulated screw for definitive anatomic and stable fixation. The main goals of operative treatment are attempts to reduce immobilization time and enable earlier return to work and activity. Displaced fractures of scaphoid, should be treated operatively, as they carry a greater risk for nonunion and malunion, which are associated with the development of radiocarpal arthritis, stiffness and wrist instability. Computed tomography is more useful as an assessment tool in pre-operative planning to determine the fracture location and fragment displacement.

CD010023,0,21071031,0,Variations in morphological and biomechanical indices at the distal radius in subjects with identical BMD.,"Determination of osteoporotic status is based primarily on areal bone mineral density (aBMD) obtained through dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). However, many fractures occur in patients with T-scores above the WHO threshold of osteoporosis, in part because DXA measures are insensitive to biomechanically important alterations in bone quality. The goal of this study was to determine--within groups of subjects with identical radius aBMD values--the extant variation in densitometric, geometric, microstructural, and biomechanical parameters. High resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) and DXA radius data from males and females spanning large ranges in age, osteoporotic status, and anthropometrics were compiled. 262 distal radius datasets were processed for this study. HR-pQCT scans were analyzed according to the manufacturer's standard clinical protocol to quantify densitometric, geometric, and microstructural indices. Micro-finite element analysis was performed to calculate biomechanical indices. Factor of risk of wrist fracture was calculated. Simulated aBMD calculated from HR-pQCT data was used to group scans for evaluation of variation in quantified indices. Indices reflecting the greatest variation within aBMD level were BMD in the central portion of the trabecular compartment (max CV 142), trabecular heterogeneity (max CV 90), and intra-cortical porosity (max CV 151). Of the biomechanical indices, cortical load fraction had the greatest variation (max CV 38). Substantial variations in indices reflecting density, structure, and biomechanical competence exist among subjects with identical aBMD levels. Overlap of these indices among osteoporotic status groups reflects the reported incidence of osteoporotic fracture in subjects classified as osteopenic or normal."

Two types of nonunion of the ulnar styloid are described here on an anatomic basis, and their treatment differs. Type 1 is defined as a nonunion associated with a stable distal radioulnar joint. Type 2 is defined as a nonunion associated with subluxation of the distal radioulnar joint. The postoperative follow-up period for the two types ranged from 4 months to 13 years, with a mean of 5 years 2 months. Eleven type 1 wrists were treated with excision of the fragment, and all patients had satisfactory relief of pain. Nine type 2 wrists required restoration of the anatomy of the traingular fibrocartilage complex. Three of these had large fragments that were treated by open reduction and internal fixation. All three patients were completely relieved of their discomfort. Six other patients underwent excision of the fragment and repair of the triangular fibrocartilage complex to the distal ulna. This group had four excellent, one good, and one fair result.

Indications for arthrography are injuries of the ligaments or of the joint capsule. Fractures and dislocations of the metacarpal, and the phalangeal bones are the most common fractures of the skeletal system. Conventional radiography is the primary imaging technique, followed by sonography and MRI to detect injuries of the ligaments and tendons."

CD010023,0,15293923,0,[Coronal fractures of scaphoid].,"Two cases of frontal fracture of the scaphoid proximal pole after a high energy trauma are reported. Diagnosis was delayed in both cases and was only possible with a CT-scan. One fracture was slightly displaced: the patient was treated conservatively and followed during 11 years with an excellent result. The other patient was operated on because of persistent pain and malunion. Only during surgery was the correct diagnosis made and due to scaphoid malunion, a proximal row carpectomy was performed. At a post operative assessment, in both cases, X-rays showed a double contour of the proximal pole of the scaphoid. We believe than an arthroCT-scan or MRI is necessary to assess the fracture displacement and search for an associated ligamentous injury."

Faulty placement rates in internal fixation of the scaphoid show there is a current need for a 3D image-based navigation system and intraoperative monitoring of how successful the procedure will be. For this reason, we have developed a new radiotransparent hand fixation device (Scaph-Splint), which allows reliable and accurate drilling of the scaphoid using 3D navigation. Tests of this device and the simultaneous precise placement of screws securing an internal fixation device are described in this paper."

The current study aimed to clarify the 3-D deformity pattern of malunited distal radius fractures and reveal the influence of osseous deformities, including axial rotation deformity, on wrist and forearm motion. The deformity of 20 dorsally tilted malunions were evaluated using 3-D computer models created from CT data, and correlations between deformity components and range of motion were assessed. The 3-D deformity analysis showed that axial malalignment in pronation, which showed a correlation with the degree of radial tilt deformity, was very common. A radial tilt deformity of > 5° was observed in only 45% of cases. Although the range of wrist flexion and extension showed a correlation with dorsal tilt deformity, the range of forearm pronation and supination did not correlate with distal radius deformities."

These fractures are rare, often go unrecognized, and are reputed to unite with difficulty. A clue to diagnosis was given by the description (young athletic person in sports involving sudden starts and stops). The lesion was not always visible on X-rays of the foot in supination and dorsal flexion (only 10 out of 20 in this series). Use of tomography and tomodensitometry was essential. Treatment was based on compressing the fracture with a screw without grafting or freshening, followed by immobilization of the foot with a cast and no weight bearing for 45 days. Union occurred in 19 out of the 20 cases. Thirteen patients were able to practice their sport without a loss of performance after a period ranging from 3 to 14 months. Treatment varied given the risk of spontaneous non union: incomplete fractures discovered early often responded to orthopedic treatment; fractures associated with large intra-osseous lytic lesions required addition of bone grafting. These fractures can be prevented through the use of inner arch supports especially if a predisposing factor exists such as a short first metatarsal bone."
CD010023,0,16121617,0,[Recent scaphoid fractures (within the first three weeks)].,"Scaphoid fractures are the most common carpal fracture, accounting for 70 a 80% of all fractures of the wrist. The diagnosis of acute fracture of the scaphoid still continues to be missed despite an increasing improvement of imaging techniques. In fact, these fractures are mainly neglected because of minimal early symptoms or quick resolution of initial symptoms. X-ray analysis of acute fractures is rather difficult because of the irregular shape of the scaphoid and its overlapping with other structures. In case of doubtfull or negative initial radiographic views, a technetium 99 bone scan or MR imaging should be consisidered. These fractures occuring in the young and most active members of our society represents a population that doesn't have the patience for traditionnal immobilisation in cast. Thus patients with undisplaced fractures for whom early return to work or sport is a primary concern, percutaneous repair with cannulated screw fixation using fluoroscopy and even aided with arthroscopy represents an increasing option. Nevertheless, in thoses cases, cast immobilisation should always be first considered. If percutaneous internal fixation is the first choice in proximal pole fractures or fractures seen with a delay, in the other cases, it can only be advocated if internal fixation will provide a stable reduction. There is little controversy for the treatment of displaced unstable scaphoid fractures. Open repair and internal fixation with a screw represents the golden standard. Complex displaced or dislocated fractures are often comminuted and associated with bony defect. Accurate reduction may need to perform a bone graft. The ligamentous injuries should also be carefully repaired . Evidence of associated cartilagenous lesions must be asessed with precision, as they always jeopardize the end result."

CD010023,0,8440272,1,Significance of a hot spot on the bone scan after carpal injury--evaluation by computed tomography.,"The use of bone scintigraphy in patients with negative radiographs after carpal injury is widely advocated. However, focally increased activity on the bone scan in the scaphoid or other carpal bones cannot always be radiologically confirmed as a fracture. To confirm scintigraphically suspected carpal fractures, computed tomography (CT) of the wrist was performed in patients with clinically suspected scaphoid fracture and initially negative radiographs. All patients underwent plain radiography, bone scintigraphy and CT. The combination of plain radiographs and CT, as judged by a panel of experienced observers, was used as the reference standard. In 18 patients, 21 out of 22 carpal hot spots on bone scintigraphy could be radiologically confirmed as a fracture. The diagnosis was missed by CT scan in three patients with proven fractures on plain radiographs. We conclude that, in patients with negative initial radiographs following carpal injury, a positive bone scan must be interpreted as a fracture."

CD010023,0,10357531,0,Wire-loop fixation of volar displaced osteochondral fractures of the distal radius.,"We describe the technique of wire-loop fixation to treat 4 young men with a unique variant of Melone's type 4 articular fracture of the volar lunate facet, characterized by a displaced rotated articular fragment supported by a limited amount of subchondral bone. This is an unusual injury that threatens the integrity of both the radiocarpal and distal radioulnar joints. It is the result of a compressive force to the wrist and may require trispiral computed tomography for delineation. Open reduction and internal fixation is recommended to maintain stability and articular congruity. The displaced volar-articular fragment, however, may be relatively small; therefore, direct manipulation could lead to soft tissue stripping and osteonecrosis. We have found the technique of wire-loop fixation to be a simple, reproducible, and effective alternative method of internal fixation for these difficult fractures. Malunion, nonunion, loss of fixation, tendon rupture, infection, arthrosis, or pain caused by hardware has not occurred. Use of this technique is not recommended in patients with osteoporotic bone."

The initial goal is accurate diagnosis of the fracture using clinical evaluation and available imaging modalities. Union is the subsequent objective, with a trend toward restoration of normal scaphoid anatomy, because nonunion or malunion may lead to unacceptable results and patient dissatisfaction.

Triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC), scapholunate ligament (SLL), and lunotriquetral ligament (LTL) are crucial to wrist stability. Damage to these ligaments causes changes in bone alignment and altered motion pattern. This may cause pain and eventually osteoarthritis. Imaging techniques of the wrist include conventional arthrography, computed tomography (CT) arthrography, conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and MR arthrography. Especially, MRI plays an important role in the assessment of TFCC, SLL, and LTL. Therefore, special attention is drawn to normal and abnormal MR imaging appearance of these ligaments in this review. Variety of treatment options dependent on classification of TFCC and ligamentous injury as well as role of imaging in the patient treatment are also discussed."
CD010023,0,14600775,0,Diagnosis of acute fractures of the extremities: comparison of low-field MRI and conventional radiography.,"The aim of this study was to compare low-field MRI (0.2 T) and conventional radiography for the detection of acute fractures of the distal part of the extremities. X-ray and MRI examinations of 78 (41 fractures, 37 without fracture) patients with the clinical suspicion of an acute fracture in the distal part of the extremities were compared. Four experienced radiologists, two for each of the two modalities, independently analyzed the images. Interobserver variability and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis for both methods were established. The MRI and conventional radiography revealed an accuracy of 81.4 and of 79.5%, respectively, in the detection of acute fractures. The diagnostic accuracy of MRI to detect fractures in the hand and forefoot proved to be significantly inferior to conventional X-ray examinations. On the other hand, MRI achieved a better accuracy for the examination of bones near a large joint. The interobserver variability for both methods was rated as moderate. In ROC analysis both methods were rated as good. There was no statistical difference of the accuracy between low-field MRI and conventional radiography in the detection of acute fractures of the distal part of the extremities. Consequently, a routine use of low-field MRI as an alternative to conventional radiography to diagnose acute fractures of the extremities seems not to be justified."

Thirty-one patients, one woman and 30 men, were reviewed retrospectively at a mean of 42 (12-77) months. All patients received pre- and postoperative CT scans to assess bone union. In addition to demographic data, the range of motion, grip strength, DASH score, Krimmer score, Mayo wrist score and radiological parameters (carpal height, scapholunate and radiolunate angles) were recorded. Bone union was achieved in 21 patients. The average DASH score in patients with bone union was 12 and that in patients with persistent non-union it was 30. No progression into carpal collapse or increase of scapholunate angles was detected. Our study demonstrates that acceptable union rates can be achieved with non-vascularised bone grafts, and this technique compares favourably with other reports in the literature."
CD010023,0,9467190,0,Upper extremity radionuclide bone imaging: the wrist and hand.,"Bone scintigraphy of the hands and wrists represents an important adjunct imaging technique that complements plain film radiographic examination. The use of the three-phase bone scan provides clinical information not only regarding osseous uptake but the blood flow and extravascular distribution of the radiotracer as well. Scintigraphic evaluation of the hands and wrists is employed in acute and chronic conditions. In the event of an equivocal or negative plain film, the bone scan can identify occult fractures. Of particular concern is the identification of scaphoid fractures due to the higher incidence of osteonecrosis. Work related injuries represent a significant health issue. The bone scan can be a part of the algorithm for evaluating chronic pain syndromes including reflex sympathetic dystrophy. The complimentary roles of bone scanning and imaging with gallium-67 citrate or radiolabeled leukocytes has proven useful in the evaluation of acute or chronic osteomyelitis. In addition, the diphosphonates are useful in identifying solitary and multiple primary bone tumors. In the case of primary bone tumor, thallium-201 can be used to evaluate response to therapy. Although uncommon in the hand and wrist, the bone scan can identify metastatic tumors or tumor-related conditions such as hypertrophic osteoarthropathy. Finally, bone scintigraphy may be useful in identifying location and extent in a variety of conditions such as fibrous dysplasia, histiocytosis X, and Paget's disease."

Union was obtained in 80 patients (92%) with an average delay of 8.6 weeks (range 6 to 24). Between 1994 to 2000 we treated 22 patients with a Kienbock's disease. A radius shortening was always added to the revascularization of lunate by this vascularized bone graft. Preoperative and postoperative MRI was systematically done. The average follow-up was 55 months (range 24 to 92 months). MRI showed healing with good revascularization in 16 cases (74%). Lesions of lunate were stabilized in five cases and we had one failure with secondary palliative procedure. This simple but meticulous technique needs only one approach and allows a sufficient revascularisation."

CD010023,0,9820289,0,Distal radius fractures: mechanisms of injury and strength prediction by bone mineral assessment.,"The strength of the radius depends on the mechanical properties of cancellous and cortical bone. By assessing both compartments quantitatively with bone densitometry, we tried to identify the specificity of each in predicting the load at which the distal radius will fracture. Twenty human cadaver forearms were scanned for bone mineral and geometric properties with quantitative computed tomography and dual x-ray absorptiometry. In both a neutral loading situation and one in which the wrist was extended 45 degrees, the load distribution was determined with pressure-sensitive films, and a fracture simulating a fall on the hand was produced with a material testing machine. Fractures that occur with the wrist in extension were produced by a central impact of the scaphoid onto the radiocarpal joint, and those that occur under neutral loading conditions were produced by a more commonly distributed loading pattern. The load at fracture was most specifically predicted (r2=0.74) by bone mineral and geometric measures of the cortex at the shaft of the radius. Bone mineral density measures of trabecular (r2=0.64) and total (r2=0.66) bone were less successful in predicting the fracture load. After adjustment for bone size, the geometric and density measures revealed similar specificity. Cortical bone, therefore, contributes significantly to the strength of the distal radius and may play an important role in the prediction of osteoporotic wrist fractures."

CD010023,0,9699835,0,Poor interobserver reliability of AO classification of fractures of the distal radius. Additional computed tomography is of minor value.,"Interobserver reliability of the AO system of classification of fractures of the distal radius was assessed using plain radiographs and CT. Five observers classified 30 Colles'-type fractures using only plain radiographs; two months later they were reclassified using CT in addition. Interobserver reliability was poor in both series when detailed classification was used. By reducing the categories to five, interobserver reliability was slightly improved, but was still poor. When only two AO types were used, the reliability was moderate using plain radiographs and good to excellent with the addition of CT. The use of CT as well as plain radiographs brings interobserver reliability to a good level in assessment of the presence or absence of articular involvement, but is otherwise of minor value in improving the interobserver reliability of the AO system of classification of fractures of the distal radius."

Over a 12 month period a total of 51 patients with suspected fracture underwent both conventional 99Tcm-MDP scintigraphy and 16 detector multislice CT on the same day. The 99Tcm-MDP uptake was then quantified in patients with identified fracture. This was measured by placing a region of interest (ROI) over the fracture site and the mean and maximum number of counts were compared with those in a similar size ROI placed over background bone activity. A total of 23 fractures were identified on scintigraphy of which 16 were also detected on CT (concordant). In seven cases the fracture was not seen on CT, even in retrospect (discordant). In the discordant cases, follow-up radiographs and MRI (where available) also failed to demonstrate a fracture. The mean fracture count to background bone activity ratio averaged 7.7 (range 3.2-18.5) for concordant fractures and 3.8 (range 1.7-5.3) for discordant fractures (t-test p=0.04). The maximum fracture count to background bone activity ratio averaged 12.7 (range 4.3-27.7) for concordant fractures and 6.3 (range 2.6-9.5) for discordant fractures (t-test p=0.03). It is speculated whether these discordant fractures with less 99Tcm-MDP uptake may represent a less severe injury such as bone bruise."

CD010023,0,8479720,0,Imaging techniques for distal radius fractures and related injuries.,"In patients with distal radius fractures, routine roentgenographic examination in at least two or three planes should be performed first and is usually sufficient for correct diagnosis and adequate treatment. A careful examination of the soft tissues of the forearm and wrist on conventional roentgenograms may be key for correct diagnoses. Routine roentgenographic examination of the wrist, preferable in four views, should be performed in every patient with a distal radius fracture acutely as well as at follow-up. The technique is easy to perform, universally available, and inexpensive. Advanced imaging techniques such as radionuclide bone imaging, CT, or MR imaging should not be first choice modalities in patients with distal radius fractures and should be used only when conventional roentgenograms are inconclusive. Scintigraphy can be helpful for diagnosing occult fractures, for documenting fracture healing and ligamentous or cartilaginous post-traumatic disorders, as well as for diagnosis and follow-up of reflex sympathetic dystrophy. A disadvantage of scintigraphy is its poor specificity. Indications for CT include the confirmation of occult fractures suspected on the basis of the findings of physical examination and focally hot bone scintigrams when plain films are normal or inconclusive. In comparison with conventional radiography, CT is superior for the preoperative evaluation of complex comminuted distal radius fractures, depicting the distal radial articular surface and size and position of fracture fragments, as well as for the assessment of fracture healing. Additionally, CT is the imaging technique of choice for the correct diagnosis of subluxations of the distal radioulnar joint. Magnetic resonance imaging is an important diagnostic technique for the evaluation of suspected injuries of soft tissues related to distal radius fractures, such as to the flexor and extensor tendons or the median nerve, and for the early diagnosis of necrosis of the scaphoid or lunate. Other indications include identification of triangular fibrocartilage complex perforations, ruptures of carpal ligaments, and demonstration of contents of the carpal tunnel."

Vascularised bone transfer is one of the most successful techniques for treating these problems. 15 patients with avascular necrosis and non-union of the scaphoid were treated by a microvascular reanastomosed corticocancellous transplant from the distal medial femur. In all patients the success of the microvascular bone transfer was examined by MRI and conventional radiographs immediately, 6 weeks, 3, 6 and 12 months postoperatively. The transplant vitality, signs of reunion and carpal configuration were registered. Furthermore, the Mayo wrist score was employed for clinical evaluation. All transplants remained vital during the follow-up period of one year. Pseudoarthrosis was treated successfully in every case. In 14 cases there was a significant increase of the Mayo wrist score and in one case there was no difference before and after surgery.

To minimize the incidence of arthrosis, the goal of treatment should be consolidation of the fracture with the scaphoid in anatomic alignment. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging scans can aid evaluation of carpal collapse, scaphoid collapse, scaphoid nonunion, bone loss, and detection of osteonecrosis. Nonunion of the scaphoid waist may result in a humpback deformity, increasing the chances of further collapse and arthrosis. This collapse deformity must be approached volarly with an intercalary bone graft and internal fixation. A dorsal approach to proximal scaphoid nonunions allows easier access for removing the necrotic bone from the proximal pole and applying accurate screw or pin fixation. Vascularized bone graft is recommended to manage scaphoid nonunions with osteonecrosis."

There is often a considerable delay in the diagnosis because of its subtle and often vague clinical presentation. Accompanying a thorough history and physical, the authors recommend plain radiographs of the foot and ankle, followed by a CT scan to fully characterize any fracture of the navicular and to rule out other etiologies of foot pain. If a CT scan is negative, and a high clinical suspicion persists, an MRI scan is then obtained to rule out a stress reaction. While often successful, non-operative treatment of navicular stress fractures is prolonged and often frustrating to the competitive athlete; surgical intervention for appropriately selected patients can result in full symptom resolution and a return to the desired level of athletic participation."
CD010023,0,15620498,0,Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA): can it detect acute scaphoid fractures?,"This prospective study investigated whether dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) could detect acute scaphoid fractures. We blindly compared 10 normal and 10 fractured scaphoid images produced with a new technique of DXA scan analysis. This measured and plotted the density of the scaphoid throughout its length, producing a linear graph of the scaphoids' density instead of a single area (g/cm2) measurement of bone density. These new plots only detected six of the 10 fractures and suggested that four of the normal controls were fractured. Thus, this technique of DXA scan analysis is neither sensitive nor specific for the detection of acute scaphoid fractures."
CD010023,0,3623270,0,[Tumors and tumor-like diseases of the carpal bones].,"This presentation concerns the findings in 105 tumors or tumor-like lesions in the bones of the carpus. These tumors generally produce complaints which are uncharacteristic and they are quite difficult to recognize on X-ray. Due to this difficulty, there may be many different therapies before the correct final diagnosis is confirmed. These tumors are usually found in the scaphoid, capitate, lunate, or hamate. Of the 105 tumors, 45.7% were osteoid osteoma, which has an incidence of only 11.33% of all bone tumors in the body as a whole. Of the remaining tumors, 15.24% were diagnoses to be intraosseous ganglia (= tumorlike lesions). Lesser percentages were giant-cell tumors, osteochondromas, chondromas. One intraosseous lipoma was found and this had never before been reported. The majority of the patients were between twenty and thirty years of age. With surgical removal, complaints are generally reduced. Dramatic relief from pain is reported by patients when an osteoid osteoma is removed. The most important deduction from these findings is that tumors in the carpus are not as rare as once assumed. The possibility of bone tumors should be considered in patients with intractable pain in the carpus."
CD010023,0,21234740,0,[Carpal instability].,"Carpal instability can be understood as a disturbed anatomical alignment between bones articulating in the carpus. This disturbed balance occurs either only dynamically (with movement) under the effect of physiological force or even statically at rest. The most common cause of carpal instability is wrist trauma with rupture of the stabilizing ligaments and adaptive misalignment following fractures of the radius or carpus. Carpal collapse plays a special role in this mechanism due to non-healed fracture of the scaphoid bone. In addition degenerative inflammatory alterations, such as chondrocalcinosis or gout, more rarely aseptic bone necrosis of the lunate or scaphoid bones or misalignment due to deposition (Madelung deformity) can lead to wrist instability. Under increased pressure the misaligned joint surfaces lead to bone arrosion with secondary arthritis of the wrist. In order to arrest or slow down this irreversible process, diagnosis must occur as early as possible. Many surgical methods have been thought out to regain stability ranging from direct reconstruction of the damaged ligaments, through ligament replacement to partial stiffening of the wrist joint."

CD010023,0,20048493,0,Clinical examination of scaphoid fractures.,"Undetected scaphoid fractures may lead to complications, including nonunion, malunion, avascular necrosis, and wrist arthritis. A competent physical examination is essential for the diagnosis of scaphoid fractures in the setting of occult fractures presenting with normal radiographs. The differential diagnosis of occult scaphoid fractures includes acute tears of the scaphoid-lunate ligament, Kienbock's disease, occult ganglion, nondisplaced radial styloid fractures, and injury to the radial aspect of the radio-scapho-capitate ligament. All of these may have normal plain radiographs but often can be distinguished based on physical examination findings. The 2 key points of such an examination include the exact location of point tenderness and provocative special tests. Although Watson's scaphoid shift test is classically described for scaphoid instability, we highlight its significance in the setting of scaphoid fractures."

We report three cases of recurrent volar instability of the distal radioulnar joint secondary to fracture of the radial shaft. In all cases, X-rays showed a volar apex deformity of the radial shaft. Opening wedge osteotomy and iliac bone grafting was performed on the distal diaphysis of the radius instead of on the radial shaft, in order to adjust the distal radioulnar joint more easily. Pre-operative dislocations and painful clunks disappeared in all three patients. However, slight instability of the distal radioulnar joint remained in all cases. Osteoarthritis of the distal radioulnar joint was noted in one patient 31 months after the operation. All of the patients were satisfied with the results and did not desire further operations."

This system has been evaluated by prospectively studying 23 patients who were referred for suspected injury of the wrist. The registration system has an inherent precision for registration of about 1 mm. When patient positioning errors are included, this increases to about 4 mm. Two observers evaluated the sets of images prior to registration and after registration and combined display. They judged that in 16 out of 17 cases judged abnormal (observer 1) and 12 out of 18 cases judged abnormal (observer 2), the registration technique improved localization of a lesion. One case was rejected as registration was not possible due to incorrect positioning of the hand."

Scans were performed an average of 3 months after injury and many were inconclusive because of disuse changes. A prospective analysis of early scintigraphy in 35 cases over 18 months was carried out. Scans were performed at an average of 15.5 days after injury in selected cases. Patients had an average of 1.28 sets of negative radiographs prior to scanning. There were no false negative scans and in 13 with focal uptake a wrist fracture was demonstrated. Diffuse uptake was thought to be indicative of ligamentous damage or reflex sympathetic dystrophy. Early scintigraphy was found to be a sensitive, reliable and cost-effective examination in cases of suspected significant wrist injury."

The series included 10 patients who were selected either for disagreement of clinical and radiological findings, the latter being negative (3 patients), or for better assessment of radiological findings, which had diagnosed bone lesions, in order to plan treatment (7 cases). CT provided additional information in 5 patients, demonstrating 2 nonunited fractures in the first group and 2 pseudoarthroses with no significant bone deformity and 1 osteonecrosis in the second group. These results, which proved essential to plan the subsequent treatment, show that CT has, at present, in specific cases, a definite role in evaluating post-traumatic scaphoid conditions, and stress the value of direct coronal images, which are both easy to interpret, being equivalent to radiographs in postero-anterior projection, and quick to perform."
CD010023,0,7717945,0,Injuries to the ulnar carpometacarpal region: are they being underdiagnosed?,"Thirteen cases with radiographic evidence of injury to the ulnar side of the hand are reviewed. These injuries included intraarticular fractures and/or dislocations of the fourth and fifth carpometacarpal joints and associated bones collectively discussed here as the ulnar carpometacarpal region. In nine the extent of the injury was not appreciated on first presentation. Injuries to this region are often difficult to assess clinically and radiographically even in experienced hands. In our experience computerized tomography (CT) scans in the longitudinal and longitudinal oblique axis best display the ulnar carpometacarpal joint surfaces and their relationship to each other. We recommend CT of the ulnar carpometacarpal region where clinical evidence of an injury to this region is not in keeping with the plain radiographic findings, and when planning surgery on a complex injury in this region."

CD010023,0,8423315,0,Diagnosis of occult scaphoid fractures by intrasound vibration.,"We investigated a new means of diagnosing occult scaphoid fractures. Eighty-six patients underwent vibratory testing at presentation, while the clinical examination and standard four-view x-ray examination findings were unknown to the persons who performed the vibratory testing of both the injured and uninjured wrists. Thirty-six patients had radiographically confirmed scaphoid fractures and, after their vibratory tests, were eliminated from the study. Fifty patients, 39 men and 11 women, were believed to have scaphoid fractures on the basis of history and clinical examination findings but were included in the occult scaphoid study group because standard four-view x-ray films of the wrists did not reveal a scaphoid fracture. Distinction between the fracture and no-fracture patients was made with a limited two-phase technetium bone scan and delayed x-ray examination. All patients with known scaphoid fractures (36) had positive findings on vibratory examination. Vibratory testing identified all six of the patients with occult scaphoid fractures (sensitivity 100%). Results of two examinations were false-positive, and none were false-negative (specificity 95%). One of the patients with false-positive results had a fracture of the trapezium, and the other had reflex sympathetic dystrophy. The vibratory testing of injured wrists is inexpensive, noninvasive, and easy to perform, and it involves no ionizing radiation."
CD010023,0,15738806,0,Carpal fractures in children.,"Carpal injuries in children are relatively rare. Diagnosis is likely to be missed, or the severity of the injury might not fully be appreciated at the time of presentation. Fortunately, in the majority of cases the fracture heals uneventfully with a low incidence of complications. As in adults, the scaphoid is most susceptible to injury and the capitate, which often presents in association with other carpal bone injuries, the next most susceptible. Other carpal bone fractures are very unusual and the literature largely is confined to case reports or very small series. This review article lists the common carpal injuries in children and suggests a treatment plan in each case, emphasizing the importance of having a high index of suspicion when faced with a child with a wrist injury and seemingly normal radiographs."
CD010023,0,19708624,0,A rare wrist injury: simultaneous fractures of the hamate body and scaphoid waist.,"Hamate fractures, which are classified as fractures of the body or the hook, are rare, representing only 2% to 4% of carpal fractures. Hamate body fractures can occur as isolated injuries, but in a high-energy trauma, associated carpal bone fractures or carpal disruption can be seen. Hamate fractures can be easily underdiagnosed. Pain in the ulnar side of the palm and swelling of the wrist after a wrist injury should alert the physician. Anteroposterior and lateral radiographs of the wrist may not always be adequate for the diagnosis. Computed tomography should be used to explain the pain in the wrist and to investigate any associating osseous pathologies. This article describes a case of a rare wrist injury: a fracture of the hamate body and a simultaneous fracture of the scaphoid waist treated nonoperatively. To our knowledge, there is only 1 case report in the literature in which the fracture of the hamate body accompanies the fracture of the distal pole of the scaphoid."

CD010023,0,3189662,0,Delayed unions and nonunions of stress fractures in athletes.,"From 1971 to 1985, 369 athletes presented to us with stress fractures. Of these patients, 10% (37) were treated for development of delayed unions or nonunions. Twenty-seven of the patients were male and 10 were female. Their mean age was 23.1 years (range, 17 to 39). About half of the athletes were involved in endurance sports. The diagnostic criteria for a delayed union or nonunion were clinical and radiological evidence. There was a diagnostic delay of about 3.5 months in the series. Plain radiographs, tomography, and isotope scans were used in the diagnosis. Special radiographic views were also used. In 15 cases (10 hallux sesamoid bone fractures, 1 midtibial shaft fracture, 1 metatarsal V base fracture, 1 tarsal navicular fracture, 1 olecranon fracture, and 1 proximal tibial shaft fracture) nonoperative treatment was used. Operative treatment was used 22 times (5 sesamoid fractures, 5 midtibial fractures, 5 metatarsal V base fractures, 3 tarsal navicular fractures, 3 olecranon fractures, and 1 proximal tibial shaft fracture). Results were good or excellent in 32 cases (86.5%), moderate in 4 cases, and poor in 1 case."
CD010023,0,11901382,0,Three-dimensional in vivo kinematics of the distal radioulnar joint in malunited distal radius fractures.,"How malunion of the distal radius affects the kinematics of the distal radioulnar joint in vivo was evaluated. A novel computed tomography image-based technique was used to quantify radioulnar motion in both wrists of 9 patients who had unilateral malunited distal radius fractures. In the injured wrists dorsal angulation averaged 21 degrees +/- 6 degrees, radial inclination averaged 18 degrees +/- 5 degrees, and radial shortening averaged 21 +/- 3 mm. Clinically, the average range of motion of the injured wrists was 75 degrees +/- 25 degrees pronation and 73 degrees +/- 23 degrees supination. Kinematics of the radius during pronation and supination in the malunited forearms was indistinguishable from that in the uninjured forearms. In both the axis of rotation of the radius passed through the center of the ulnar head, although it shifted slightly ulnar and volar in supination and radial and dorsal during pronation. In contrast to previous in vitro biomechanical findings, there was no dorsovolar radial translation at the extremes of pronation or supination and no translation of the radius along the rotation axis. Soft tissues may play a larger role in limiting function than previously appreciated, and treatment may require correction of altered soft tissue structures as well as any abnormal bone anatomy."
CD010023,0,9232498,0,Navicular body fractures: computerized tomography findings and mechanism of injury.,"The case reports of five patients with signs and symptoms of a fracture of the tarsal navicular body are presented. Each patient underwent a computerized tomography examination to determine the extent of this fracture. Based on the computerized tomography findings, surgical or conservative management was carried out. The computerized tomography examination, combined with the patient's history, has shed new light on a previously undescribed mechanism of injury for this fracture."
CD010023,0,12479336,0,Percutaneous internal fixation of scaphoid fractures via an arthroscopically assisted dorsal approach.,"Percutaneous internal fixation of scaphoid fractures allows for more predictable union and less morbidity than cast treatment or open internal fixation. A headless cannulated compression screw (standard Acutrak) is implanted by way of a dorsal percutaneous approach with the aid of fluoroscopy and arthroscopy to confirm screw position and fracture reduction. This technique is indicated in the correction of acute proximal pole fractures, acute waist fractures, and delayed unions that are not associated with avascular necrosis or collapse. The details of this technique are reviewed. In a consecutive series of twenty-seven fractures (seventeen waist fractures and ten proximal pole fractures) treated with arthroscopically assisted dorsal percutaneous fixation, computed tomographic scanning confirmed 100% union at an average of twelve weeks. Eighteen fractures were treated within one month after the injury, and nine were treated more than one month after the injury. In this series, the fractures that were treated early (less than one month after the injury) healed more quickly than those treated later."
CD010023,0,22541157,0,Management of scaphoid nonunion.,"The primary risk factor for nonunion of the scaphoid is displacement/instability, but delayed or missed diagnosis, inadequate treatment, fracture location, and blood supply are also risk factors. Untreated nonunion leads to degenerative wrist arthritis-the so-called scaphoid nonunion advanced collapse wrist. However, the correlation of symptoms and disease is poor; the true ""natural history"" is debatable because we evaluate only symptomatic patients presenting for treatment. It is not clear that surgery can change the natural history, even if union is attained. The diagnosis of nonunion is made on radiographs, but computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging scans can be useful to assess deformity and blood supply. Treatment options vary from percutaneous fixation to open reduction and internal fixation with vascularized or nonvascularized bone grafting to salvage procedures involving excision and/or arthrodesis of carpals."
CD010023,0,11206349,0,Degeneration of the scaphoid-trapezium joint: a useful finding to differentiate calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease from osteoarthritis.,"This study aimed to determine whether osteoarthritis of the scaphoid-trapezium joint (ST osteoarthritis) is associated with calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease (CPDD) in an elderly population with or without concomitant polyarthritis of the finger joints (FIPO). An age- and gender matched case-control study was performed at a university hospital outpatient clinic. Cases and controls were identified from a clinical registry. The case ascertainment process included: (1) chart review for evidence of pyrophosphate crystals from arthrocentesis and/or cartilage calcifications and (2) blinded reading of hand X-rays by three observers for calcification of the triangular fibrocartilage and/or cartilage calcification around the spatium triangulare. Osteoarthritis was graded from 0 to 4 according to the Standard Atlas of Radiographs. The association of ST osteoarthritis with the diagnosis was examined using chi2 tests or the Wilcoxon rank sum test as appropriate. From 65 potential cases, 30 fulfilled the inclusion/exclusion criteria whereas from 185 potential controls, 81 fulfilled the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Thirty controls were matched to cases for gender and age. ST osteoarthritis was much more severe in CPDD (median: 3.0) than in patients with FIPO (median: 0.3) and was strongly associated with the diagnosis (odds ratio 13.8; CI 3.4-59.8). Definite ST osteoarthritis identified CPDD with a sensitivity of 83% and a specificity of 73% with regard to FIPO. It was concluded that the presence of ST osteoarthritis is a helpful diagnostic finding for the diagnosis of CPDD in an elderly, predominantly female population with a high prevalence of FIPO. Especially in cases without radiographic cartilage or fibrocartilage calcification of the wrist, ST osteoarthritis may point to the correct diagnosis."

CD010023,0,7747190,0,Distal radioulnar joint subluxation and dislocation diagnosed by standard roentgenography.,"The use of standard lateral roentgenography for diagnosing distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) subluxation and dislocation was investigated. Using a wrist support, bilateral standard lateral roentgenograms of the wrist were obtained in 42 patients with normal wrists and in 56 patients with a unilateral wrist injury. In normal wrists the difference between the radioulnar distance in the right and the left wrist did not exceed 4 mm when the difference in the pisoscaphoid distance was less than 3 mm. Of the 36 patients with wrist injury whose difference in pisoscaphoid distance was less than 3 mm, 15 had a radioulnar distance of 5 mm or more, and computed tomography (CT) confirmed DRUJ dislocation in 14. Concordance between lateral roentgenograms and CT was present in 33 of 36 patients (92%). These results demonstrate the value of a standardized technique for bilateral lateral roentgenography in diagnosing DRUJ subluxation and dislocation."
CD010023,0,17224223,0,Collapsed scaphoid non-union with dorsal intercalated segment instability and avascular necrosis treated by vascularised wedge-shaped bone graft and fixation.,"Patients with the specific problem of a collapsed Nakamura volar type, scaphoid synovial pseudarthrosis with avascular necrosis on both magnetic resonance imaging and intraoperative inspection were studied to determine the ability of a trapezoidal wedge-shaped structural bone graft vascularised by the 1,2 intercompartmental supraretinacular artery to simultaneously achieve correction of the scaphoid dimension and a high union rate. Fifteen patients with this specific problem were followed for a mean of 32.1 months and achieved union in all cases at a mean of 11.5 weeks. Improvements were seen postoperatively in wrist flexion and extension, grip strength, degree of dorsal intercalated segment instability and degree of scaphoid collapse. Two complications relating to the fixation technique occurred. Although technically difficult, it is possible to achieve a high rate of union for scaphoid pseudarthrosis while correcting substantial collapse deformity by the use of a structural, wedge-shaped, vascularised bone graft."
CD010023,0,17541372,0,[The diagnosis of recent scaphoid fractures: review of the literature].,"Fractures of the scaphoid are the most common carpal fractures. A review of the literature indicates that the prevalence of the fracture in the case of clinical suspicion is less than 50%. A quality X-ray examination remains essential as an initial diagnostic tool in the evaluation of scaphoid fractures. Its sensitivity varies from 59 to 79%. Patients with negative X-rays present with about 18.7% of scaphoid fractures; 5% of bruised scaphoid; 13% of radius fractures and 7% of miscellaneous bone lesions. If not treated promptly, a scaphoid fracture may be compounded by non-union with associated risk factors such as avascular necrosis and osteoarthritis. Considering these risks, patients with suspected scaphoid fracture with normal X-rays, routinely undergo wrist immobilization until imaging confirms or denies the presence of fracture. Consequently, more than half of the patients undergo wrist immobilization needlessly. This may have a negative impact on their professional life and personal activities while representing a high medical cost. MRI is the imaging technique of choice for suspicious or negatice X-rays. MDCT is less costly than MRI or bone scan, readily available and highly effective for trauma patients but is lacks accuracy and should be used with caution in this indication."

CD010023,0,7296203,0,Isotope bone imaging in suspected scaphoid trauma.,"The unreliability of radiological examination in excluding or confirming a suspected scaphoid fracture after carpal trauma is a well-recognised diagnostic problem. This paper explores the role of isotope bone imaging (IBI) in the early identification of carpal bone injury. Abnormal generalized uptake of activity may be seen within the carpus, possibly as a consequence of diffuse soft tissue injury, particularly if imaging is performed within 48 hours of trauma. A focal area of increased uptake related to one carpal bone is suggestive of fracture though the part which ligamentous injury, localized periosteal reaction or incomplete cortical infarction may play in the production of such radionuclide appearances is uncertain. Ninety-nine patients with suspected recent scaphoid fracture but no demonstrable abnormality on radiological examination were subjected to IBI, using 555 MBq (15 mCi) of 99Tcm methylene diphosphonate. Abnormal focal increased uptake (AFIU) was found in 47 patients, this being localized to the scaphoid bone in 26. Of these 47 cases, 19 (42%) showed subsequent radiological evidence of fracture. The results of IBI, in our experience, can only be reliably interpreted if imaging is performed at least 48 hours after injury, though in cases of fracture AFIU may persist for several years. Using this technique, the possibility of fracture can be confidently excluded in that group of patients who show no AFIU. In selected cases of carpal trauma, IBI provides a satisfactory alternative means of identifying the presence and site of localized injury within the carpus and may be used to confidently exclude those patients with non-osseous symptomatology."

In that setting, because time and quality are both important factors, they have concentrated on developing protocols that will allow effective, time-efficient, high-resolution MRI of the wrist. With these wrist imaging protocols, they have evaluated the majority of commonly encountered pathologic conditions of the wrist. They have found that high-resolution images, which can be acquired in a very timely fashion when fast spin echo sequences are used in imaging protocols, will demonstrate the most common pathologic conditions, including triangular fibrocartilage and ligament tears in the wrist. They present the practical issues of patient position and imaging sequences as well as the imaging findings in those pathologic conditions."
CD010023,0,8617043,0,Detection of occult wrist fractures by magnetic resonance imaging.,"The early detection and management of wrist fractures may avert potential complications and patient morbidity. Five cases are described in which radiographically-occult fractures were clearly demonstrated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These fractures were seen on MRI as a low signal linear band on T1- and T2-weighted images, with surrounding increased signal intensity from bone marrow oedema on T2-weighted images. In one case, intense oedema obscured the fracture line on the initial MR scan. MRI is useful in confirming the presence of a fracture, delineating its exact shape and location, and in the follow-up of these injuries during and after treatment."

CD010023,0,11279570,0,Evaluation of the sigmoid notch with computed tomography following intra-articular distal radius fracture.,"A classification system for disruption patterns of the sigmoid notch of the radius associated with distal radius fractures has not been established. Using plain x-rays and corresponding computed tomography (CT) scans we characterized and quantified the types of sigmoid notch involvement in 20 consecutive distal radius fractures with radiocarpal joint extension. Plain radiographs revealed fracture extension into the sigmoid notch in only 7 cases (35%) and the CT scans demonstrated fracture extension into the sigmoid notch in 13 cases (65%). Of the 13 fractures with sigmoid notch involvement, 9 (69%) were displaced and 4 (31%) were nondisplaced. Sigmoid notch articular step-off (n = 7) and gapping (n = 9) were detectable on the CT scans but not on the x-rays. Plain x-rays appear to underestimate sigmoid notch involvement following distal radius fractures. In addition, CT appears to be a superior diagnostic modality for quantifying sigmoid notch fracture step-off and articular gapping."

CD010023,0,2392023,0,Scaphoid fractures and Kienbock's disease of the lunate: MR imaging with histopathologic correlation.,"Thirteen patients with scaphoid fractures and four patients with Kienbock's disease of the lunate underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) prior to surgery. A total of 28 specimens had MR-histologic correlation. Biopsy specimens obtained by curettage provided pathologic correlation. MRI proved accurate in prospective evaluation of bone viability for both scaphoid fractures and Kienbock's disease. Normal marrow signal was shown to correlate with the presence of osteoid and osteocytes on light microscopy and a surface layer of fluorescence reflecting tetracycline uptake in viable bone. Decreased marrow signal corresponded to non-viable trabeculae with scant osteoid, without osteocytes and no tetracycline labeling. By virtue of its accurate identification of avascular necrosis, MRI may prove valuable in predicting prognosis for patients with scaphoid fractures and Kienbock's disease of the lunate."
CD010023,0,15230772,0,Imaging of the symptomatic type II accessory navicular bone.,"Accessory ossicles of the foot are commonly mistaken for fractures. The accessory navicular is one of the most common accessory ossicles of the foot. There is a higher incidence in women and the finding might be bilateral in 50-90%. This entity is usually asymptomatic, although populations with medial foot pain have a higher prevalence. Three types of accessory navicular bone have been described. The type II accessory navicular is the most commonly symptomatic variant with localized chronic or acute on chronic medial foot pain and tenderness with associated inflammation of overlying soft tissues. Plain radiographic identification of the accessory navicular is insufficient to attribute symptomatology. Ultrasound allows for comparison with the asymptomatic side and localization of pain. Bone scintigraphy has a high sensitivity but positive findings lack specificity. Magnetic resonance imaging is of high diagnostic value for demonstrating both bone marrow and soft tissue oedema."
CD010023,0,10550430,0,[MRI in the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of radiocarpal diseases and injuries].,"Advances in MRI technology have greatly improved visualization of the radio-carpal region. With todays high-resolution imaging, even very small anatomic structures like the triangular fibrocartilage may be seen. Established indications include the osteonecroses (scaphoid and lunate); however, MR images always should be evaluated in conjunction with plain radiographs. By delineating bone marrow edema, MRI is well suited for the detection of microfractures. Visualization of small soft tissue tumors, soft tissue extension of bone tumors and for staging of tumors in general may also be regarded as indications generally agreed upon. Promising indications include pathology of ligaments and similar structures."
CD010023,0,7989702,0,The utility of a bone scan in the diagnosis of clinical scaphoid fracture.,"The incidence of true scaphoid fracture and the value of radionuclide scan was evaluated in a 1-year retrospective review of 54 emergency department patients with a preliminary diagnosis of clinical scaphoid fracture (snuff box tenderness and negative initial X-ray study). All emergency department charts of patients with a discharge diagnosis of clinical scaphoid fracture were reviewed to determine the number ultimately found to have a true scaphoid fracture and to ascertain how the diagnosis was actually achieved. All patients were managed by immobilization in a thumb spica cast for a period of 10-14 d, with repeat clinical assessment and radiographs at that time. The diagnosis of true scaphoid fracture was confirmed radiographically at the time of reassessment or, in the case of persistent tenderness and negative repeat radiographs, by the use of a technetium bone scan. In our study group, only 8 of 54 patients (14.8%) were found to have a final diagnosis of true scaphoid fracture. In 75% (6/8) of these patients, the diagnosis was made by technetium bone scans, as the radiographs remained negative at the time of reassessment. In addition, a bone scan revealed the presence of two previously unsuspected fractures (one distal radius fracture and one triquetral fracture) in two patients with continued clinical tenderness. This study confirms the previously reported low incidence of scaphoid fractures in patients with a diagnosis of clinical scaphoid fracture. It also demonstrates the importance of technetium bone scan as a diagnostic tool of increased sensitivity, as compared to traditional radiographs, in detecting the presence of scaphoid fractures and in detecting other clinically unsuspected fractures in this group of patients."

Preoperative planning was dramatically enhanced by the ability to perform the surgical procedure on these models, with a model of the uninjured limb used for comparison.

CD010023,0,10550438,0,[Scaphoid fracture and scaphoid pseudarthrosis].,"Careful diagnostic and early therapy are especially important in cases of scaphoid fractures. This is due to the patients being mostly young and the high number of non-unions of these carpal bones. Conservative and various operative treatments are therapeutical options. Out of the patients who underwent surgery from January 1993 to February 1999 42 patients with a scaphoid fracture and 88 patients with a scaphoid non-union were, in addition to standard X-ray examination, examined clinically and by MRI pre- and post-operatively. Fractures of the scaphoid were treated by Herbert screw fixation. The operative treatment of non-unions of the scaphoid included the transplantation of an iliac crest graft and Herbert screw fixation. Post-operatively a cast-immobilisation was done. Subjective statements of the patients and clinical results were assessed. The classification of Herbert and Fisher (1984)/Filan and Herbert (1996) for X-rays was used. The signal intensities of the MRI in the fragments of the scaphoid were determined qualitatively and quantitatively by computer calculation, comparing the pre- and post-operative results with one another. Post-operative results of the scaphoid fractures were in most cases good and excellent. 67 patients with a scaphoid non-union and 11 with a scaphoid fracture showed a pre-operative diminishing of the signal in the proximal fragment. For these patients, the fusion rate was lower than in patients without pre-operative signal reduction. The examination shows that in most cases bony fusions with good clinical results could be achieved by Herbert screw fixation. The MRI seems to be able to complete the radiological classification of the fractures regarding a prognosis."

CD010023,0,17556000,0,[Numerical variants and congenital fusions of carpal bones].,"The number of carpal bones may be increased or decreased by the fact of anatomical variants or true congenital anomalies. Numerical increment arises from additional or from split bones. Over twenty accessory carpal bones have been described but the commonest are the os centrale carpi, the os radiale externum, the triangular bone and the styloideum bone. Additional carpal bones usually result from a failure of fusion of their ossification centers. A congenital origin is not clearly established for all these ossicles. The scaphoid and lunate may split into two or three bones and several cases of bipartite hamulus of the hamatum have been reported. A carpus with only seven bones results from the congenital absence of a normal bone, which mainly affects the scaphoid, lunate and triquetrum, or from a synostosis between two carpal bones, usually the lunate and triquetrum. Congenital fusions originate from an absence of joint cavitation into the embryo and chondrification of the joint interzone. Numerical carpal variants are uncommon as independent entities but occur with a relative high frequency in association with complex malformations of the hand. These anomalies are detectable on plain radiographs of the wrist, but CT-scan and MR-Imaging are useful to differentiate bipartite and accessory bones from carpal fractures or posttraumatic injuries, carpal fusions having to be distinguished from bony ankylosis."
CD010023,0,9330135,0,Radiographic evaluation of osseous displacement following intra-articular fractures of the distal radius: reliability of plain radiography versus computed tomography.,"This study evaluated the reliability of plain radiography versus computed tomography (CT) for the measurement of small (< 5 mm) intra-articular displacements of distal radius fracture fragments. The plain radiographs and CT scans of 19 acute intra-articular distal radius fractures were used by 5 independent observers, using 2 standardized techniques, to quantify incongruity of the articular surface in a blinded and randomized fashion. Repeat measurements were performed by the same observers 2-4 weeks later, allowing determination of intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) as a measure of intraobserver and interobserver agreement. The average maximum gap displacement on plain radiographs was 2.1 mm (range, 0.0-15.0 mm, lateral view) and on CT images was 4.9 mm (range, 0.7-17.3 mm, axial view). The average maximum step displacement on plain radiographs was 0.9 mm (range, 0.0-6.4 mm, lateral view) and on CT images was 1.2 mm (range, 0.0-6.0 mm, sagittal view). More reproducible values determining step and gap displacement were obtained when the arc method of measurement was used on CT scans (ICC values, .69-.97) as compared to the longitudinal axis method for plain radiographs (ICC values, .30-.50). For measured displacements of 2 mm or more, our data demonstrated poor correlation between measurements made on CT images and those made on plain radiographs (gap or step displacement > 2 mm, K = 0.21; step displacement > 2 mm, K = 0.21). Thirty percent of measurements from plain radiographs significantly underestimated or overestimated displacement compared to CT scan measurements. From these data, we conclude that CT scanning data, using the arc method of measurement, are more reliable for quantifying articular surface incongruities of the distal radius than are plain radiography measurements."
CD010023,0,9330136,0,Kinematics of the scaphoid shift test.,"Twenty-five uninjured subjects (50 wrists) were examined clinically and fluoroscopically during performance of the scaphoid shift test. Wrists were placed into 3 groups on the basis of the degree of palpable carpal motion that occurred during the clinical examination. Kinematic parameters of rotation and displacement were calculated from digitized images of the carpals at rest and at maximum displacement. On clinical exam, 36% of normal individuals had positive findings on scaphoid shift test. Dorsal displacement of the scaphoid was not significantly associated with positive scaphoid shift test results in these subjects, while total displacement of the scaphoid (the sum of axial and dorsal displacement) was significantly associated with positive test results. The principle confounding factor appeared to be a high degree of displacement that occurred at the capitolunate joint in some individuals, termed a ""midcarpal shift."" The data demonstrate that despite a high prevalence of positive scaphoid shifts among uninjured individuals, the ability to accurately detect dorsal displacement of the scaphoid using the scaphoid shift test is limited. On the basis of their findings, the authors recommend that positive test results be confirmed fluoroscopically."
CD010023,0,18092740,0,Point-based rigid-body registration using an unscented Kalman filter.,"We present and validate a novel registration algorithm mapping two data sets, generated from a rigid object, in the presence of Gaussian noise. The proposed method is based on the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) algorithm that is generally employed for analyzing nonlinear systems corrupted by additive Gaussian noise. First, we employ our proposed registration algorithm to fit two randomly generated data sets in the presence of isotropic Gaussian noise, when the corresponding points between the two data sets are assumed to be known. Then, we extend the registration method to the case where the data (with known correspondences) is stimulated by anisotropic Gaussian noise. The new registration method not only reliably converges to the correct registration solution, but it also estimates the variance, as a confidence measure, for each of the estimated registration transformation parameters. Furthermore, we employ the proposed registration algorithm for rigid-body, point-based registration where corresponding points between two registering data sets are unknown. The algorithm is tested on point data sets which are garnered from a pelvic cadaver and a scaphoid bone phantom by means of computed tomography (CT) and tracked free-hand ultrasound imaging. The collected 3-D points in the ultrasound frame are registered to the 3-D meshes in the CT frame by using the proposed and the standard Iterative Closest Points (ICP) registration algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms the ICP registration algorithm in the presence of additive Gaussian noise. It is also shown that the proposed registration algorithm is more robust than the ICP registration algorithm in terms of outliers in data sets and initial misalignment between the two data sets."

Causes, diagnosis and therapy].","From 1987 until July 1991 70 athletes with stress reactions or stress fractures were treated in the orthopaedic department of the Hannover Medical School. The average age of the 42 male and 28 female athletes was 22.6 years. The number of athletes involved in track and field sports was 29 (41.4%), in gymnastics 9 (12.9%) and in soccer 5 (7.1%). The most common bone injured was the tibia in 29 (41.4%), followed by the tarsal navicular in 21 (30.0%), the midfoot in 17 (24.3%) and the fibula in 4 (5.7%) athletes. In three cases double stress fractures were found in adjacent locations; in one case a stress fracture of the opposite navicular occurred after the initial tarsal navicular stress fracture had healed, and in another case the tarsal navicular was found to be fractured again. Thirty-seven percent of the athletes claimed sudden increase in training intensity was the cause; 33% felt that the increased sprinting and jump activities were the reason for their complaints. In some athletes pain started after an ankle sprain. Standard diagnostic procedure consisted in X-rays in two planes and three-phase bone scanning. In tarsal navicular or tibial locations additional tomograms were performed. MRI and CT scans were reserved for unclear findings and to exclude the possibility of a tumorous or inflammatory process. A new grading system was introduced that covers all forms of stress reactions from periostitis to pseudarthrosis. Clinical symptoms, sport disabilities, radiological and bone scan findings were graded from A to D. Using a modified Wilson classification, all radiologically recognizable stress reactions could be classified.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Bilateral and symmetrical lesions of the wrist are rare. Intraosseous ganglia of the carpal bones are uncommon causes of chronic wrist pain. Isolated cases of intraosseous ganglion have been reported most commonly in the lunate and scaphoid. The lunate was most frequently affected, followed by the capitate, scaphoid, and triquetrum bones. Radiolucent lesions in the carpal bones are not uncommon and are often seen incidentally in asymptomatic patients. The differential diagnosis of a lytic lesion in a carpal bone includes unicameral bone cyst, degenerative cyst, fibrous developmental defect, osteomyelitis, and intraosseous ganglion cyst. This article describes a case of bilateral lunate intraosseous ganglia. A review of the literature revealed that bilateral and symmetrical intraosseous ganglia of the wrist are rare, with only 3 other reported cases of bilateral lunate lesions."

A CT bone scan in the long axis of the scaphoid is the best means of differentiating between stable and unstable fractures. This is difficult from conventional X-rays due to the particular three-dimensional anatomy of the scaphoid. To avoid long-term plaster immobilization and to diminish the risk of a nonunion, unstable fractures of type B should be fixed operatively. With headless screws such as the Herbert screw, which are now available in a cannulated shape, the majority of scaphoid fractures of type B1 and B2 can be stabilized using minimally invasive procedures. Severely displaced fractures require the classical open palmar approach. Proximal pole fractures (B3) are best managed from the dorsal approach, using the Mini-Herbert screw. Stable fractures of type A2 can be treated conservatively in a below-elbow cast or, alternatively, stabilized percutaneously, which allows early mobilization."

As a result, more acute bone and soft-tissue injuries are occurring in this patient population. Chronic overuse syndromes are also more common today. It is important for radiologists to understand the mechanism of injury so that they can properly approach the imaging of these patients. Although magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is frequently the technique of choice, other imaging methods are also important and may, in certain cases, be preferred to MRI.

Forty-three patients were included after conservative management had failed to improve their wrist pain so that a stability test could be performed satisfactorily and underwent arthroscopy within 12 weeks. Arthroscopy revealed recent pathology in 41 wrists, of which 17 had significant ligament lesions that might have benefited from acute repair. We conclude that patients with marked persistent post-traumatic symptoms despite conservative management are likely to have sustained ligament injuries despite normal radiographs. We therefore recommend that under these circumstances an arthroscopy is carried out within 4 weeks if the patient and surgeon wish to acutely repair significant ligament injuries."
CD010023,0,3390770,0,New clinical test for fracture of the scaphoid.,The authors noted that in patients with scaphoid fractures pronation of the affected wrist followed by ulnar deviation produces pain in the anatomic snuff box that is not present in those without a scaphoid fracture. They therefore evaluated this test prospectively in 73 patients. The test gave a 52% positive predictive value and a 100% negative predictive value. They recommend that the test may be used with confidence in the emergency department to exclude a scaphoid fracture in patients with clinical features suggesting scaphoid injury but a normal x-ray film. Use of this test would reduce the number of patients whose wrists are needlessly immobilized in a scaphoid cast.
CD010023,0,12203148,0,[Distal radius fractures and concomitant lesions. Experimental studies concerning the pathomechanism].,"Since Colles (1814) first described a distal radius fracture and the publication by Dupuytren (1834), the frequency of and problems surrounding these fractures were increasingly recognised. Not only the treatment but also the formation and type of fracture were repeatedly analysed. The various theories concerning the pathomechanism led to names such as: ""tear fracture"", ""bend fracture"", ""thrust fracture"", ""compression fracture"", ""snap fracture"" and others. In our experimental studies we attempted to simulate the pathomechanism of distal radius fractures and present them pictorially. With the help of a materials testing machine, 63 prepared cadaver arms were hyperextended in the wrist joint until a radius fracture occurred. The concomitant lesions were registered radiologically and by dissection. Moreover, additional cadaver arms were deep-frozen and examined by means of computer tomography and cryosection according to Kathrein. Through experimental hyperextension it was possible to generate dorsal, central, and palmar types of fractures. We produced 42 dorsal, 14 central and 7 palmar fractures. Fundamentally, it seems that the fracture depends on the extent in which the carpal bones of the proximal row are pressed against the dorsal, central or palmar part of the articular surface of the distal radius. The subsequent dissection showed in 40 cases (63 %) mostly multiple concomitant lesions and in 23 cases (37 %) none of these. The reason for concomitant lesions may be the proportion of bone stability to the strength of ligaments. Most frequently (27 cases, i.e. 43 %), we found a destabilisation of the articular disk with or without a bony avulsion fragment (fracture of the ulnar styloid). We also commonly found ruptures of the interosseous ligaments between scaphoid and lunate (20 cases, i.e. 32 %) and lunate and triquetrum (11 cases, i.e. 18 %). It is difficult to apply knowledge gained from experimental studies on preserved cadaver arms clinically. There are of course no physiological reflexes and the slow fracture process must be taken into consideration. This holds true not only for concomitant lesions but also for the type of fracture. On the other hand, in these experimental studies it was possible to generate many realistic types of fractures with their concomitant lesions."

CD010023,0,9283841,0,Trauma of the wrist.,"In wrist injury, plain radiographs form the basis of diagnostic imaging, and can provide definitive answers in most cases. MR imaging is the method of choice for several diagnostic problem cases. These problems can include radiographically occult fractures where MRI enables early diagnosis compared to follow-up radiographs. Early stage diagnosis of a post-traumatic avascular osteonecrosis with high sensitivity and specificity, is only possible with MRI. In these instances, radiographs are only sensitive in later stages and scintigraphy is quite nonspecific. Stress fractures, invisible with other modalities, are also demonstrable with MRI. In addition, MRI is helpful in special circumstances with regard to non-union or pseudarthrosis. In wrist instability, radiographs in combination with stress views and fluoroscopy are still the initial diagnostic step. MRI, with the advantage of direct visualization of the wrist ligaments and triangular fibrocartilage complex, offers very promising results in this area. Generally, for the evaluation of wrist injury, MRI can be considered the most important second-step procedure in patients where radiographs are nondiagnostic."

The MRI examinations were performed an average time of 2.8 days after the trauma. This prospective study proved that MRI is able to diagnose occult scaphoid fractures without delay and without the use of radioactive diagnostic means. Sensitivity and specificity of MRI were 100%. This conventional method could save $7,200 (US) per 100,000 inhabitants in providing an immediate and correct diagnosis and avoiding unnecessary cast immobilization. Additional injuries that may be misdiagnosed by conventional radiographs are also detected with a specificity and sensitivity of 100%."

CD010023,0,16716469,0,Diagnostic strategy for suspected scaphoid fractures in the presence of other fractures in the carpal region.,"Bone scintigraphy will identify up to 25% of occult scaphoid bone fractures after negative scaphoid X-rays. Consequently, it deserves a place in the diagnostic process of suspected scaphoid fractures. However, the role of bone scintigraphy is less clear if scaphoid X-rays show other fractures in the carpal region. We analysed 111 consecutive patients with a suspected scaphoid fracture on physical examination. Scaphoid X-rays revealed 61 fractures. Fifty-five patients had scaphoid fractures only and six patients had other fractures in the carpal region but no scaphoid fracture. In 50 cases, no bone injury was seen on these X-rays. In three out of the six patients with other fractures in the carpal region, bone scintigraphy revealed four occult concomitant fractures: one scaphoid, one scaphoid and trapezial and one capitate fracture. In conclusion, bone scintigraphy is required when scaphoid X-rays do not confirm a suspected scaphoid fracture, even in the presence of other fractures in the carpal region."

CD010023,0,10420289,0,[Long-term outcome of reconstruction of proximal scaphoid pseudarthroses with Matti-Russe-plasty].,"Thirty-two patients who were treated with Matti-Russe grafts between 1985 and 1995 after a fracture of the proximal scaphoid pole were examined in a retrospective study. The purpose of the study was the evaluation of the long-term results of functional outcome, radiological results, and postoperative quality of life. Main object of the study was to clarify whether the development of carpal collapse is inevitable or if it is correlated to the persistence of bony nonunion. Measured parameters were: grip strength and range of motion, pain was evaluated with a visual analog scale from 0 to 100 (VAS). The analysis of the X-rays was carried out with a special wrist-score that was developed for the 1997 meeting of the German Speaking Society for Surgery of the Hand (DAH). The functional outcome was evaluated with the DASH-questionnaire. Twenty-nine patients were male, three were female. In 22 patients the right hand was involved, in ten patients the operation was performed on the left hand. The average follow-up period was 66 months. Bony union was achieved in 26 cases, six patients still demonstrated a persistent nonunion. The mean postoperative pain score was 1.8 (non-stress) and 42.5 (stress) in patients with scaphoid union. Active range of motion and grip strength were 90% compared to the contralateral side, the DASH-score reached 12.73. Only in persistent nonunion an advanced carpal collapse could be detected. The results show the reliability of the Matti-Russe graft in nonunion of fractures of the proximal pole of the scaphoid. Alternative treatment options have no advantages in bony union. The disadvantage of the Matti-Russe graft is the long period of immobilisation."

CD010023,0,11775468,0,Percutaneous fixation of scaphoid fractures.,"The scaphoid proximal pole and waist fractures presented here were treated by a novel dorsal percutaneous technique with arthroscopic assistance. All fractures healed, with good final functional results and no complications. The advantages of the dorsal percutaneous approach to scaphoid fixation are: (1) the proximal-to-distal placement of the guide pin and screw allow for more precise placement along the central axis of the scaphoid, which decreases healing time and reduces risk of screw thread exposure. (2) The dorsal approach avoids injuring the vulnerable volar ligament anatomy. And (3) the insertion of the screw from the proximal to distal direction allows the more rigid fixation of proximal scaphoid fractures. Arthroscopy allows confirmation of fracture reduction and screw implantation as well as evaluation of concurrent ligament injuries not detected with standard imaging. Percutaneous K-wires act as joysticks to reduce and compress fracture fragments prior to fixation. The presented technique allows for early, rigid internal fixation with minimal associated morbidity. Patients successfully treated with this technique include those with stable and unstable acute fractures of the scaphoid at all locations, including the proximal pole. Nondisplaced fractures that present with delayed or fibrous union without evidence of avascular necrosis, cyst formation, or bony sclerosis may also be treated with this technique. This technique allows for faster rehabilitation and an earlier return to work or avocation without restriction once CT scan confirms a solid union. Some articles document extraordinary rapid healing by standard radiographs; however, we caution that scaphoid bone healing cannot accurately be determined without CT scan. Percutaneous, arthroscopically assisted internal fixation by a dorsal approach may be considered in all acute scaphoid fractures selected for surgical fixation. The dorsal guidewire permits dorsal and volar implantation of a cannulated screw along the central axis of the scaphoid. This technique permits the reduction of displaced fractures and the stable repair of fractures of the proximal pole. In addition, selected scaphoid fibrous union or delayed union may also be repaired, with realistic expectations of healing. The proven benefits of the percutaneous technique include decreased soft tissue trauma; arthroscopic visualization of the fracture, ensuring anatomic reduction; and stable fixation, allowing early physical rehabilitation. The theoretical benefits of the technique include decreased risk of interruption of the tenuous scaphoid blood supply. Percutaneous internal fixation of scaphoid fractures provides faster rehabilitation, earlier return to work, and quicker bony union in most patients."

The purposes of this study were to establish normal values for the lunate-lunate facet ratio (LLFR) and to evaluate whether the LLFR and lunate-lunate facet variance (LLFV) are reliable plain film measures of sagittal articular gap in distal radius fractures compared with sagittal reconstructions of computed tomography (CT) scans."
CD010023,0,2211858,0,Fractures and ligamentous injuries of the wrist.,"Rapid diagnosis, appropriate management, and sport-specific rehabilitation are important in the management of any wrist injury in the athlete. The addition of technetium scans, CT, arthroscopy, and MRI in the evaluation of the athlete's wrist has provided valuable and powerful diagnostic tools. The versatility and relatively low invasiveness of arthroscopic intervention and the subsequent early return to activity make this technique especially attractive in the high-performance athlete. Suspicion of potential injuries, complete knowledge of wrist mechanics and anatomy, and a careful physical examination are still the most important tools in the evaluation of wrist injury. It is important to approach each athlete in a patient-oriented manner, taking into account the fact that many of these injuries have the potential to be career ending. Treatment that will provide the best possible long-term wrist function must be the physician's ultimate goal. In addition, the importance of appropriate and activity-specific rehabilitation cannot be overemphasized."
CD010023,0,6544813,0,Three-phase bone studies in hemiplegia with reflex sympathetic dystrophy and the effect of disuse.,"Eighty-five patients with cerebral vascular accidents were assessed with three-phase bone scintigraphy of the hands and with whole-body delayed bone imaging. Nine patients (10%) had normal three-phase bone images. Fifty-five patients (65%) showed decreased blood flow and blood-pool images of the hands and wrists with normal delayed bone scintigrams, indicating the effect of paralysis or disuse. Twenty-one patients (25%) had diffuse increased uptake with periarticular accentuation, felt to be bone-scintigraphic evidence of reflex sympathetic dystrophy of the hands and wrists; in two patients this occurred before its clinical appearance. Thirteen of the 21 reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndromes (RDS)-involved limbs (62%) had increased blood flow, whereas 8 (38%) had decreased flow. Gross limb blood flow appears to be related to the degree of muscle activity, but flow may be altered by the presence of sympathetic changes. A possible dissociation between whole-limb flow and bone blood flow in paralyzed limbs involved with RDS is discussed. The elbow was involved in only one case, and a true ""shoulder-hand"" distribution was seen in only 11 of 21 cases (52%). Five patients (6%) had leg involvement on whole-body imaging. Traumatic synovitis of the wrist, and trauma to subluxed shoulders, could be recognized on the delayed study."
CD010023,0,15346064,0,Dorsal transscaphoid-transtriquetral perilunate dislocation in pseudarthrosis of the scaphoid.,"A patient reported that he sustained a minor fall on the outstretched hand in hyperextension, pronation, and in ulnar deviation. Initial radiographs suggested dorsal transscaphoid-transtriquetral perilunate dislocation. Traditionally, however, this injury is the result of a high-energy impact. A CT scan obtained after closed reduction of the dislocation revealed not only a fresh fracture of the triquetrum but also two corticalized fragments of the scaphoid. A former major fall on this hand and a normal scaphoid of the other hand made pseudarthrosis more likely than scaphoid bipartition. Arthrography revealed intact lunotriquetral and scapholunate ligaments, precluding the possibility of preexisting ligamentous instability. Pseudarthrosis of the scaphoid with a loss of scaphoid function as a mechanical tie-rod of the carpus is most likely responsible for this complex injury. This is the first clinical study that shows that single scaphoid discontinuity without preexisting ligamentous carpal instability may lead to complex perilunar dislocation in minor trauma."

Initial plain radiographs do not always show the fractures. Especially fractures through the neck of the capitate can lead to delayed union. We report on a patient with persistent localised pain over the capitate 5 months after a fall on the hand. The CT examination showed a delayed union of the capitate, which was treated with an iliac cancellous bone graft and screw osteosynthesis. Bone healing was verified 3 months after operation. Operative therapy is recommended in cases of delayed union or non-union of the capitate."
CD010023,0,11775467,0,Closed cast treatment of scaphoid fractures.,"Cast immobilization of the wrist remains the treatment of choice for stable fractures of the waist and distal pole of the scaphoid. Criteria for diagnosis of stability should be stringent; plain radiographs may be misleading. CT may provide more accurate information on displacement. Immobilization of the thumb confers no advantage and restricts function unnecessarily. Evidence to support immobilization of the elbow is weak, but it may be useful for selected fractures. A cast does not protect the carpus from the effects of axial loading, which can produce large angulatory forces at the fracture. A gap or fracture offset of 1 mm or more are indicators of instability with potential for nonunion or malunion; internal fixation should be considered for these fractures. Internal fixation may also be considered routinely for proximal pole fractures, regardless of the degree of displacement, in view of their long healing time and high risk of nonunion after cast treatment."
CD010023,0,11775466,0,Effects of scaphoid fractures on the biomechanics of the wrist.,"Scaphoid fractures are the most commonly fractured carpal bone. They most often occur from a fall on dorsiflexed, radially deviated wrist. The severity of the fall and position of the wrist influence the fracture pattern and the extent of ligamentous damage. Recent studies have correlated fracture pattern stability and any associated ligamentous disruption with the degree of alternation of wrist biomechanics. It is well documented that instability and altered kinematics can lead to nonunion and abnormal joint loads, which then can accelerate the onset of arthritis. Understanding these biomechanical consequences is critical when managing scaphoid fractures."

Fourteen patients clinically showed growth arrest, and 10 patients required a Langenskiold operation. In 3 patients who underwent this operation, subsequent premature total fusion of the physis adversely affected the postoperative results. We propose that the merging shape of the arrest line with calcification of the provisional zone of the metaphysis shown by MRI indicates poor viability of the physis. MRI provided useful information on the appearance of the growth plate and changes in the metaphysis, both of which affected the prognosis and the results of the surgical procedures."

In the course of conservative treatment, a dislocation of the distal radioulnar joint in locked hypersupination developed. Due to the locked rotational deformity, standard X-rays were difficult to assess. Only with the help of a CAT-scan, were the authors able to visualize the distal radioulnar joint dislocation and later control the postoperative result."

All cases were subjected to a corrective opening wedge scaphoid osteotomy with insertion of a trapezoid-shaped tricortical iliac bone graft. At the final assessment, after a mean follow-up period of 42 months, the achieved results were rated excellent in seven cases, good in four and fair in two according to the scoring system used. Objectively, the mean range of wrist motion and hand grip strength improved from 48% and 47% pre-operatively to 82% and 79% at the final assessment. Radiological parameters including height to length ratio, lateral intrascaphoid angle and dorsal cortical angle were also effectively improved. The intra-operative corrected carpal alignment has almost been maintained at the final follow-up. The procedure did not have serious drawbacks such as non-union or avascular necrosis and perhaps might delay the development of degenerative arthritis of the wrist."

Although the mortality and morbidity caused by hip fractures would warrant routine screening, measurement of bone mass has uncertain value in assessing the risk for hip fracture. Wrist fractures generally cause only transient disability, and measurement of bone mass may not reliably predict risk. Measurements of bone density of the spine might be better able to assess a woman's risk for vertebral fractures, but the value of screening depends on whether the findings would affect a woman's decision about using estrogen therapy after menopause. Serial measurements of bone mass to estimate a woman's rate of bone loss are relatively imprecise, increase the cost of screening, and have at best a limited role in screening women to assess risk for osteoporotic fractures."

CD010023,0,8153501,0,Tarsal navicular stress fracture in athletes.,"Stress fracture of the tarsal navicular bone is now frequently recognised. The majority of navicular stress fractures are partial fractures in the sagittal plane. They occur mainly in track and field athletes. A number of theories regarding the aetiology of this fracture have been proposed. Athletes with a history of vague, activity-related midfoot pain, with associated tenderness over the dorsal proximal navicular ('N' spot) should be suspected of having a navicular stress fracture. Plain radiography frequently fails to demonstrate the fracture, thus radionuclide scanning is the investigation of choice to detect navicular stress injury. A computed tomography (CT) scan should be performed to confirm the presence of the fracture. Various methods of treatment have been employed. A minimum of 6 weeks of strict non-weightbearing cast immobilisation is the treatment of choice. After removal of the cast, a further 6 week programme of rehabilitation with a graduated return to activity, joint mobilisation and soft tissue massage is required.

CD010023,0,17262830,0,Effects of distal radius malunion on distal radioulnar joint mechanics--an in vivo study.,"Patients with a malunited distal radius often have painful and limited forearm rotation, and may progress to arthritis of the distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ). The purpose of this study was to determine if DRUJ congruency and mechanics were altered in patients with malunited distal radius fractures. In nine subjects with unilateral malunions, interbone distances and dorsal and palmar radioulnar ligament lengths were computed from tomographic images of both forearms in multiple forearm positions using markerless bone registration (MBR) techniques. The significance of the changes were assessed using a generalized linear model, which controlled for forearm rotation angle (-60 degrees to 60 degrees ). In the malunited forearm, compared to the contralateral uninjured arm, we found that ulnar joint space area significantly decreased by approximately 25%, the centroid of this area moved an average of 1.3 mm proximally, and the dorsal radioulnar ligament elongated. Despite our previous findings of insignificant changes in the pattern of radioulnar kinematics in patients with malunited fractures, we found significant changes in DRUJ joint area and ligament lengthening. These findings suggest that alterations in joint mechanics and soft tissues may play an important role in the dysfunction associated with these injuries."
CD010023,0,11824286,0,[Acute perilunar dislocations: algorithm for treatment].,"In most cases, perilunar dislocations of the wrist are caused by high speed accidents. Usually these injuries occur by a fall on the dorsiflexed superextension of the hand. The instability caused by injuries of various erticular structures (ligament, bone) show various developmental stages. Clinical symptoms are reduced and painful movement, instability of the carpus, snapping and swelling. The diagnosis is established by X-ray, cinematography, arthrography MRT or CT. Perilunar instability with or without associated fractures and particularly de Quervain must be reduced and treated operatively including suture of the ligament and stabilization of the fracture."
CD010023,0,7799763,0,Wrist problems in the tennis player.,"Although wrist injuries in tennis may occur from acute direct trauma, most injuries occur due to chronic overuse. Wrist biomechanics in tennis indicate that a wide range of wrist motion may not be necessary for effective play. The nature of the injury should be established as early as possible with the goals of restoring the wrist to a pain-free stable unit with normal range of motion. A secondary goal is to return the athlete to play as quickly as possible. Key points of the athlete's history are acute or chronic onset, progressive symptoms, and severity of symptoms, i.e., limitation of play. Key points of the physical examination include localization of maximal tenderness, edema, loss of range of motion, and bilateral grip strength. Plain roentgenograms should always be obtained. Specific imaging studies may be indicated and include bone scan, computed tomography, and arthrography. Specific and common wrist tennis injuries are discussed and treatment recommendations are given. Wrist problems in tennis are no uncommon and are responsible for a significant amount of lost playing time. Familiarity with the more common problems will enhance the physician's ability to evaluate and treat these athletes."

CD010023,0,20185138,0,Statistical descriptions of scaphoid and lunate bone shapes.,"Diagnosing of injuries of the wrist bones is problematic due to a highly complex and variable geometry. knowledge of variations of healthy bone shapes is essential to detect wrist pathologies, developing prosthetics and investigating biomechanical properties of the wrist joint. In previous literature various methods have been proposed to classify different scaphoid and lunate types. These classifications were mainly qualitative or were based on a limited number of manually determined surface points. The purposes of this study are to develop a quantitative, standardized description of the variations in the scaphoid and lunate and to investigate whether it is feasible to divide carpal bones in isolated shape categories based on statistical grounds. The shape variations of the scaphoid and lunate were described by constructing a statistical shape model (SSM) of healthy bones. SSM shape parameters were determined that describe the deviation of each shape from the mean shape. The first five modes of variation in the SSMs describe 60% of the total variance of the scaphoid and 57% of the lunate. Higher modes describe less than 5% of the variance per mode. The distributions of the parameters that characterize the bone shape variations along the modes do not significantly differ from a normal distribution. The SSM provides a description of possible shape variations and the distribution of scaphoid and lunate shapes in our population at an accuracy of approximately the voxel size (0.3x0.3x0.3mm(3)). The developed statistical shape model represents the previously qualitatively described variations of scaphoid and lunate. However, strict classifications based on shape differences are not feasible on statistical grounds."
CD010023,0,8501378,0,An algorithm for acute wrist trauma. A systematic approach to diagnosis.,"A systematic approach to the acute traumatized wrist is of importance to achieve early diagnosis, with efficient use of advanced imaging modalities. In a 6-month period 641 patients aged 15 years or over were examined using an algorithm for acute wrist trauma in order to secure early and appropriate treatment. In 293 (46%) cases routine radiographic examination supplied sufficient information to establish a fracture diagnosis. All 33 scaphoid fractures (including five scaphoid non-unions) were demonstrated on the initial X-ray examination. In 56 patients (9%) scintigraphy proved useful for selecting cases in need of further radiographic examination. Among 31 patients with focal activity on bone scintigraphy, CT and/or tomography revealed eight distal radial fractures, one fracture of the ulnar styloid, and eight fractures of carpal bones. Fractures were revealed using tomography and/or ""hot spot views"" in patients with negative CT examinations suggesting that further examinations should be performed in cases with increased focal activity on bone scintigraphy and a negative CT examination."
CD010023,0,9055127,0,The value of additional carpal box radiographs in suspected scaphoid fracture.,"Carpal Box (CB) radiographs, transverse and longitudinal, produce elongated and magnified views of the carpus. These radiographs can be used after carpal injury, in addition to conventional scaphoid x-rays. In this study, the use of CB radiographs was evaluated in patients with possible scaphoid fracture."
CD010023,0,4091605,0,Distal radioulnar involvement in trauma of the wrist.,"The distal radioulnar joint is the weakest point of the rotational column of the wrist. This joint is a functional part of the radiocarpal joint, united to it by an elastic tightening system, and perfectly controlled by the ulnaris (especially the extensor carpi) tendons. Our anatomic study allowed to define the mechanisms of the lesions and the methods for their correction. The key to success seems to be a functionally dynamic extensor carpi ulnaris and its dorsal position in supination. Our clinical study shows that all injuries to the distal radioulnar joint associated with trauma of the wrist or of the forearm are a factor of severity and they may be responsible for the high rate of complications. Therefore, in Galeazzi's fracture-dislocation, a specific method of stabilization may need to be associated with the radius osteosynthesis. In the absence of degenerative changes, chronic instability of the distal radioulnar joint can benefit from ligament stabilization. Results so far have been very encouraging, as far as young patients are concerned. Complex injuries remain a major obstacle, in which ligamentous and bone lesions must be distinguished by confronting clinical observation with paraclinical investigations. Computerized tomography seems to be of limited value, although this method of investigation is still in its prospective stages. Concerning management, shortening of the ulna with dorsal repositioning of the extensor carpi ulnaris allows to decompress the carpo-ulnar compartment, to stretch the tendinous and ligamentous structures, and, if need, to restore radioulnar congruity. Better knowledge of this pathology will allow to categorize radioulnar tears associated with wrist injuries. Under emergency conditions, surgical or non operative management must be adapted, allowing healing to occur with perfect restoration of the distal epiphysis of the radius. By doing so good functional results may be guaranteed."
CD010023,0,3737140,0,Injuries to the distal radioulnar joint.,"Disorders of the distal radioulnar joint can be divided into those secondary to ligamentous injuries, fractures, and arthritis changes. Further classification of the first two categories relates to acute versus chronic problems. Acute radioulnar joint disruption can, for the most part, be diagnosed on the basis of early physical examination, radiographic evaluation, and a high index of suspicion. Early recognition and the institution of satisfactory treatment are the hallmarks of a successful result. Those injuries seen after 8 weeks can be termed chronic problems, and further diagnostic evaluation beyond physical examination and routine radiographs includes wrist arthrography, arthroscopy, tomograms, and CT scans. These disorders are certainly much more difficult to treat; however, a systematic assessment with a full knowledge of the anatomy and biomechanics is helpful in preventing arthritis as the late sequela of distal radioulnar joint abnormality. Surgical treatment may be necessary in many of these situations but must be tempered to the needs and demands of the individual patient."
CD010023,0,2763950,0,Occult fractures of the carpals and metacarpals: demonstration by CT.,"Occult fractures of the carpals and metacarpals occur frequently and are associated with major disability. The cross-sectional display and superior resolution of CT are well suited to the demonstration of these fractures. Sixteen patients with pain and negative conventional radiographs were chosen for further evaluation by CT. Imaging was performed in two planes and showed 21 fractures. The transaxial plane was the most revealing imaging plane. Coronal imaging was equal or superior to the transaxial plane in most fractures of the scaphoid, lunate, capitate, and pisiform bones and of the bases of the metacarpal bones. The direct sagittal plane was the best imaging plane in one patient with fractures of the scaphoid and lunate bones. After discovery of the fracture on CT, surgical removal of the avulsed fracture fragment was recommended in seven patients and fusion was recommended in three. Eight patients had a marked decrease in pain after the surgical procedure. The accuracy of CT for the demonstration of occult fractures may result in earlier recognition of these fractures and a reduction in the associated disability."

A literature search revealed limited documentation of normal biometric measurements and no validation of scaphoid anatomic symmetry. A study was performed to provide normative data and evaluate the right-to-left symmetry of specific geometric measurements of the scaphoid. One hundred normal carpal scaphoid bones in 30 healthy subjects and 40 patients were examined with three-dimensional magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Standardized oblique projections were reconstructed from each three-dimensional data set, and seven biometric measurements of each scaphoid were obtained. Normative data from the study group were obtained by means of analysis of all 100 scaphoids. Right-to-left symmetry was validated with the biometric measurements of both scaphoids in the healthy subjects. These data validate scaphoid symmetry and provide 95% confidence intervals for specific biometric measurements that are used for preoperative planning of surgical reconstruction of scaphoid nonunions."
CD010023,0,21586765,0,Assessment of the suspected fracture of the scaphoid.,"A suspected fracture of the scaphoid remains difficult to manage despite advances in knowledge and imaging methods. Immobilisation and restriction of activities in a young and active patient must be balanced against the risks of nonunion associated with an undiagnosed and undertreated fracture of the scaphoid. The assessment of diagnostic tests for a suspected fracture of the scaphoid must take into account two important factors. First, the prevalence of true fractures among suspected fractures is low, which greatly reduces the probability that a positive test will correspond with a true fracture, as false positives are nearly as common as true positives. This situation is accounted for by Bayesian statistics. Secondly, there is no agreed reference standard for a true fracture, which necessitates the need for an alternative method of calculating diagnostic performance characteristics, based upon a statistical method which identifies clinical factors tending to associate (latent classes) in patients with a high probability of fracture. The most successful diagnostic test to date is MRI, but in low-prevalence situations the positive predictive value of MRI is only 88%, and new data have documented the potential for false positive scans. The best strategy for improving the diagnosis of true fractures among suspected fractures of the scaphoid may well be to develop a clinical prediction rule incorporating a set of demographic and clinical factors which together increase the pre-test probability of a fracture of the scaphoid, in addition to developing increasingly sophisticated radiological tests."
CD010023,0,3768974,0,Fractures and dislocations of the carpal bones.,"The most common wrist fractures in athletes are fractures of the scaphoid and fractures of the hook of the hamate. Accurate diagnosis and conservative treatment are extremely important. A physician should not compromise principles of treatment for a rapid return of the athlete to competition, because all too often this will jeopardize eventual recovery and his or her future career. It is far better to be conservative, to insist upon complete recovery before permitting competition, especially in high-school and college students, and to be more concerned with the athlete's potential achievements than immediate accomplishments. These axioms are especially applicable when treating young individuals with suspected or proven wrist injuries."
CD010023,0,10098077,0,Intra-articular fractures of the distal aspect of the radius.,"Intra-articular distal radius fractures are a heterogeneous group of injuries with different fracture patterns. The existing classification systems are helpful for describing the fractures but not for assessing their stability or for deciding which surgical approach to use. Patients who have a fracture with at least 1.0 mm of displacement of the articular surface may benefit from open surgical treatment. Improved diagnostic imaging with CT is helpful for fracture classification and surgical planning. The options for surgical treatment include limited open reduction and internal fixation, arthroscopically assisted internal fixation, and open reduction and internal fixation. The surgical approach is determined on the basis of the initial displacement of the fracture. Patients who have a displaced fracture of the volar rim may benefit from a volar approach; those who have a dorsally displaced fracture, from a dorsal approach; and those who have an impacted fracture such as a die-punch fracture, from a dorsal approach that provides better visualization of the articular surface. The long-term functional outcome is determined in part by the severity of the fracture as defined by the amount of comminution, the initial severity of displacement, and the number of fracture fragments. The accuracy of the reconstruction of the articular surface, with the goal of establishing congruency to within 1.0 mm, is also important in order to minimize the risk of late osteoarthrosis. Of all of the extra-articular parameters, restoration of the length of the radius is the most important for enhancing recovery of motion and grip strength and for preventing problems involving the distal radioulnar joint--the so-called forgotten joint in distal radial fractures."

We have reviewed the clinical consequences, after one year, of managing suspected scaphoid fractures according to the bone-scan results. We studied 160 patients, 35 of whom had initially positive radiographs and were treated in a cast for 12 weeks. The other 125 had bone scintigraphy and were managed according to the result. After a minimum of one year 119 patients were reviewed. Scintigraphically suspected scaphoid fracture could not be confirmed radiologically in 25%. There were no cases of nonunion. The long period of immobilisation in patients with positive radiographs or positive bone scans did not influence the frequency or severity of late symptoms compared with those with a normal bone scan."

However, the diagnosis of severity should now be established, if not as an emergency, at least soon after the trauma, as deterioration of carpal instability always leads top osteoarthritis after a variable interval of time. When a ligament lesion is suspected, initial pain-free immobilisation, plain and dynamic x-rays followed by at least arthrography of CT arthrography, should be performed.

CD010023,0,6265653,0,Bone scanning in the detection of occult fractures.,"The potential role of bone scanning in the early detection of occult fractures following acute trauma was investigated. Technetium 99m pyrophosphate bone scans were obtained in patients with major clinical findings (e.g., pain, swelling, tenderness) and negative or equivocal roentgenograms following trauma. Bone scanning facilitated the prompt diagnosis of occult fractures in the hip, knee, wrist, ribs and costochondral junctions, sternum, vertebrae, sacrum, and coccyx. Several illustrative cases are presented. Roentgenographic confirmation occurred following a delay of days to weeks and, in some instances, the roentgenographic findings were subtle and could be easily overlooked. This study demonstrates bone scanning to be invaluable and definitive in the prompt detection of occult fractures."

This article operationally defines the scaphoid shift test (SST), the ballottement test (BALLOT), and the ulnomeniscotriquetral dorsal glide test (UMTDG); describes the clinical and arthroscopic examination method; and analyzes the sensitivities, specificities, and predictive values of these provocative tests relative to the arthroscopic findings in 50 painful wrists. Each patient had unspecified wrist pain of at least 4 weeks' duration and was examined by one certified hand therapist who carried out all of the clinical provocative tests. The sensitivities for the SST, the BALLOT, and the UMTDG were 69%, 64%, and 66%, respectively. The specificities for the SST, the BALLOT, and the UMTDG were 66%, 44%, and 64%, respectively. The positive predictive values for the SST, the BALLOT, and the UMTDG were 48%, 24%, and 58%, respectively. The negative predictive values for the SST, the BALLOT, and the UMTDG were 78%, 81%, and 69%, respectively. These wrist provocative tests were efficient for identifying patients who needed a more detailed diagnostic workup and possible arthroscopic inspection. Of those patients who needed arthroscopic inspection, the provocative tests proved to be more efficient at predicting the absence of injury than at predicting its presence."

Fractures of the scaphoid were treated by Herbert screw fixation. The operative treatment of nonunions of the scaphoid included the transplantation of an iliac crest graft and Herbert screw fixation. In all cases, an MRI of the carpus in a low-field MRI was carried out pre-operatively in addition to standard X-ray examination. Post-operatively, all patients were again controlled by MRI within defined intervals. The signal intensities of the MRI in the fragments of the scaphoid were determined qualitatively and quantitatively by computer calculation, comparing the pre- and post-operative results with one another. It was possible to depict the entire scaphoid and to determine the signal intensities of the proximal and distal fragments after Herbert screw fixation due to reduced artefacts on T1-weighted images in all cases. 41 patients with scaphoid nonunion and five patients with a scaphoid fracture showed a pre-operative diminishing of the signal in the proximal fragment compared to the distal fragment.

Patients often complain of diffuse, poorly-defined symptoms and have a paucity of physical findings. Initial diagnostic evaluation often. fails to recognize navicular stress fractures which results in delayed diagnosis and treatment. A bone scan is sensitive in detecting this entity and the clinician should use this examination in any patient who is suspected of having a navicular stress fracture. After a navicular stress fracture is confirmed, a CT scan is required to identify the extent of the fracture.

CD010023,0,12494385,0,[Narrowing of the third extensor tendon compartment in minimal displaced distal radius fractures with impending rupture of the EPL tendon].,"Delayed ruptures of the extensor pollicis longus tendon (EPL) occur in about 0.7 percent following undisplaced distal radius fractures. Two possible mechanisms are mainly discussed in the literature: A mechanical irritation of the tendon caused by a sharp edge of the fractured bone and a direct microvascular compromise of the poorly vascularized tendon. In undisplaced fractures, however, a mechanical irritation seems less likely. In the cases here described we were able to demonstrate a fragment displacement in the area of Lister's tubercle suspected by the native X-ray and further evaluated by a CT scan. The use of CT scans even in minor displaced distal radius fractures involving Lister's tubercle may demonstrate a direct contact of the EPL tendon with a sharp edge of this fractured bone and make adequate surgery possible."
CD010023,0,22648427,0,Pathology of extrinsic ligaments: a pictorial essay.,"The role of the extrinsic ligaments, together with the intrinsic ligaments, appears to be much more important than previously thought in the setting of carpal stability. The anatomy and pathology of the extrinsic wrist ligaments is complex. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with thin slices is essential for visualization. This article describes the pathological appearance of the extrinsic palmar and dorsal radiocarpal and ulnocarpal ligaments on MRI, correlated with arthroscopy (performed by two skilled hand surgeons), clinical findings, and follow-up. High-resolution MRI, especially using isotropic three-dimensional sequences with orthogonal multiplanar reconstructions on 3T MR systems, allows detailed depiction of many of the extrinsic ligaments affected in carpal injuries. Recognition of ligament abnormalities is improved by intra-articular or intravenous injection of contrast before the examination. Both techniques may help to determine the precise localization, size, and extent of dorsal and palmar radiocarpal and ulnocarpal ligament lesions. Further experience with these techniques is needed to define the place of MRI in the management of traumatic wrist injuries."

CD010023,0,8778828,0,In vivo assessment of trabecular bone structure at the distal radius from high-resolution computed tomography images.,"A dedicated computed tomography system was used to acquire transaxial images of the distal radius to assess trabecular bone structure in vivo. We segmented trabecular bone from the marrow and soft tissue background by postprocessing the image with a region grow and skeletonization step. From the processed image we assessed the integrity of the bone by examining the continuity of its trabecular network and by determining the area of the holes comprising its marrow space. The continuity of the bone imaged was assessed by a proposed connectivity index (CI) and the size of the marrow spaces was assessed by calculating a mean hole area (H(A)) in the bone cross-section. Repeat measurements revealed that the intra-subject variability in CI and H(A) was small (CV < 6%). Both CI and H(A) were sensitive enough to reflect differences in structure at the head of the radius and at several sites along its shaft. We tested the diagnostic value of assessing bone structure at the distal end of the radius by measuring trabecular bone density, CI and H(A) in a mixed group of 26 subjects, nine of whom had suffered a wrist fracture. We found that a trabecular bone density threshold of 116 mg cm-3, corresponding to two standard deviations below the mean density in the 17 non-fractured subjects, separated fractured from non-fractured subjects with a sensitivity of 22% and a specificity of 100%. A CI threshold of -4.7 doubled the sensitivity (44%) and maintained the 100% specificity. An H(A) threshold of 4.5 mm2 achieved a sensitivity of 89% and a specificity of 94%. This increased sensitivity achieved by our indices suggests that an in vivo assessment of trabecular bone structure can contribute significantly to the identification of persons at risk of fracture."

CD010023,0,18543166,0,[C-type scaphoid fracture in a elite power lifting].,"Power lifting injuries most often involve shoulder injuries with an injury rate of 0.57 to 0.71/1000 hours of power lifting. Wrist injuries are less common in power lifters with 0.05/1000 hours exposure vs. 0.23/1000 h in elite weight lifting men. Often, two contributing factors causing wrist injuries are encountered: a) loss of balance causing the barbell to drift back behind the head of the power lifter, which hyperextends the wrist and b) the maximal weight. We report on an elite power lifting athlete preparing for the World Masters Bench press championships suffering two months of persisting pain during bench press exercise and rest in the snuff-box area following a loss of balance of the bar-bell during bench press with 280 kg load. Following prolonged presentation 2 months after the initial injury with training in the meantime, CT-scan was performed revealing a C-type scaphoid fracture. Surgery was performed as Herbert screw fixation and bone grafting according to the technique of Matti-Russe, followed by an immobilisation of twelve weeks with a plaster. We recommended ending the athletes' power lifting career, however he further exercised with the plaster with consecutive re-operation 3months later and 2nd Matti-Russe and Herbert screw re-do. One year later he became national champion with 240 kg bench pressing. Given the limited scaphoid blood supply and the high complication rate especially among C-type scaphoid fractures, a surgical procedure with bone grafting, Herbert screw fixation and sufficient plaster immobilisation is advocated in scaphoid fractures in elite athletes."

CD010023,0,1916662,0,Bone loss after liver transplantation.,"We studied 35 adult patients (mean age = 43 yr) referred for orthotopic liver transplantation. Spinal bone mineral density was measured by quantitative computed tomography scanning before transplantation (n = 35) and at 3 mo (n = 21) and 12 mo (n = 11) after orthotopic liver transplantation. The readings were corrected to age 50 yr, using the regression equations derived from normal control subjects. Quantitative bone histological studies were performed in 17 patients before orthotopic liver transplantation and 3 mo after orthotopic liver transplantation. Before orthotopic liver transplantation, the corrected spinal bone mineral density in men was 108 +/- 20 mg/cm3, less than in male control subjects (129 +/- 22 mg/cm3, p less than 0.005). In women patients the value was 117 +/- 27 mg/cm3, and in female control subjects 126 +/- 19 mg/cm3 (NS). However, women patients with primary biliary cirrhosis had lower spinal bone mineral density (106.5 +/- 14.8) than female control subjects (p less than 0.005). Histologically, the resorbing surface was near the normal mean, whereas the osteoblast surface, tetracycline surface and bone formation rate was lower in men (p less than 0.05) but not women. Spinal bone mineral density decreased by 24% in the first 3 mo after orthotopic liver transplantation with no further decrease at 12 mo. Five patients had vertebral fractures within 6 mo of orthotopic liver transplantation. One patient fractured a wrist and three had osteonecrosis of the hip or knee.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

CD010023,0,18023237,0,[Traumatic pathology of antibrachial interosseous membrane of forearm].,"The antibrachial interosseous membrane (IOM) is taught over an average length of 10.6cm between the diaphyses of the radius and ulna bone. It looks like a stitch with fibers running from the ulna to the radius and from proximal to distal and fibers running from distal to proximal. The central band, which is the middle part of the fibers directed from distal to proximal has mechanical properties similar to those of a ligament and act as a ligamentous structure embedded in the larger membranous complex of the IOM. The interosseous membrane has a double function: it stabilizes transversally the forearm's two bones and stabilizes longitudinally the two bones by transferring loads from the radius to the ulna. Load transmission varies according to the prono-supination position, the varus-valgus constraints on the elbow and the inclination of the wrist, making interpretation of the experimental data difficult. One should consider the forearm as a whole and the interosseous membrane with the two diaphyses should be regarded as a middle radio-ulnar joint, intercalated between the proximal and distal radio-ulnar joint. Those three articulations or links between radius and ulna act synergistically to stabilize and optimize repartition of loads. Functional loss of one of these links, and of course of more than one, will severely modify the forearm function. Essex-Lopresti lesion, which represents the functional loss of all three links, is the most destabilizing forearm lesion. Imaging of the interosseous membrane is difficult. MRI allows for static imaging of the interosseous membrane but there are often artifacts due to previous trauma or surgical procedures. Dynamic sonography helps to visualize all the lesions and will probably be part of the evaluation of every severe forearm injury. Surgical treatment depends on the gravity of the lesions of the different links. Interosseous membrane reconstruction is still the most difficult technique and most of the previously reported ligamentoplasties cannot answer all the biomechanical constraints. We describe a ligamentoplasty based on the biomechanics whose technique has been validated by cadaveric experiments. First surgical cases are promising."

Although the combination of scaphoid fracture and scapholunate ligament rupture in the same injury has been reported and these lesions can no longer be considered mutually exclusive, little information is available on management methods and the long-term results of such seemingly paradoxical complex injuries. This study reviews 11 previously described cases and reports an additional two cases of concurrent scaphoid fracture with scapholunate ligament rupture. This concurrent injury has two presentations; namely perilunate fracture-dislocation, which is the most common presentation, and complex scaphoid fracture. No single mechanism of injury exists that accounts for these complex injuries. High-energy trauma was the only characteristic common to all these cases. Most cases had unsatisfactory radiographic results including scaphoid nonunion, avascular necrosis of the lunate or the proximal pole of the scaphoid and arthrotic wrist changes at an average follow-up of 11 months. Managing these difficult problems needs critical recognition and repair of both bony and ligamentous damage. Early proximal row carpectomy or four-corner midcarpal fusion is another option when these injuries preclude stable reduction and fixation."

CD010023,0,21705566,0,Percutaneous screw fixation without bone grafting for established scaphoid nonunion with substantial bone loss.,"Ununited fractures of the scaphoid with extensive bone resorption are usually treated by bone grafting and internal fixation, using either an open or a minimally invasive technique. We studied the feasibility of percutaneous fixation without bone grafting in a consecutive series of 27 patients with established nonunion of an undisplaced fracture of the scaphoid and extensive local resorption of bone. They were treated by a single surgeon with rigid fixation alone, using a headless cannulated screw inserted through a volar percutaneous technique. Clinical examination, standard radiographs and CT confirmed that the fracture had united in all patients at a mean of 11.6 weeks (8 to 16), and that their functional scores had improved. We concluded that extensive resorption at the fracture site is not an absolute indication for bone grafting, and that percutaneous fixation alone will eventually produce healing of ununited undisplaced fractures of the scaphoid regardless of the size of the gap."
CD010023,0,8300730,0,Treatment of complex fractures of the distal radius. Combined use of internal and external fixation and arthroscopic reduction.,"A group of fractures of the distal radius are inherently unstable and cannot be treated by closed reduction and cast or external fixation. These fractures are high-energy motor vehicle accidents often seen in young adults but possible in nearly every age group. They are not typical Colles's fractures because they are intra-articular with displacement of the joint articular surfaces. The goals of treatment are to obtain an anatomic reduction and then to proceed with treatment techniques to maintain the reduction by whatever methods are available or necessary within the experience of the treating surgeon. Previous admonitions that Colles's fractures should not be treated by open reduction are incorrect. Like other intra-articular fractures, the goal is anatomic alignment. Limited open reduction or newer arthroscopic techniques may be sufficient. A more aggressive approach of open reduction, internal and external fixation, and autogenous bone grafting is now indicated in most high-energy distal radius fractures to achieve the treatment goals defined earlier: anatomic joint surface reduction, restoration of radial length, and correction of dorsal malangulation."

Bone mineral and strength related parameters at two different sites at the distal radius were explored in a subset of the multicenter core study. One hundred and three patients were entered into the substudy and given either a daily dose of 10 mg of alendronate or placebo for 1 year. Measurements were done at months 0, 3, 6, and 12. Inclusion criteria were bone mineral density (BMD) measurements at the lumbar spine of -2 SD. The response to therapy was assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry in the lumbar spine and the hip, and by pQCT in the ultradistal and the shaft sites of the radius. In line with the FOSIT core study, alendronate increased BMD at the lumbar spine and the hip, and it decreased the serum biochemical markers of bone turnover. The substudy showed differences between the therapy and placebo group in trabecular bone density (8.4%, p = 0.095), in total density (6.8%, p = 0.009), and in the bone strength index (BSI) (15. 6 mm3, p = 0.037) at the ultradistal site due to treatment and no changes at the radius shaft. A significant correlation was observed between percentage changes from baseline in BMD of the lumbar spine, and in total density and bone strength at the ultradistal radius site in the treatment group, but not in the placebo group. Thus, the ultradistal radius site did respond to alendronate therapy. The increased bone density accompanied a significant gain in the BSI at the ultradistal site, a finding that might help explain the reduced wrist fractures in the alendronate Fracture Intervention Trial."

Comparison between biplanar radiologic diagnostics and CT assessment of fracture morphology].,"Thirty-five displaced fractures of the distal radius, classified by standard radiographs as extra-articular type A2 and A3 fractures according to the AO classification, were investigated before operative treatment by computed tomography. The comparative analysis surprisingly revealed an involvement of the articular surface of the distal radius in 57%. The intra-articular fractures were classified after CT as C1 in 15%, C2 in 65%, and C3 in 20%. The distal radioulnar joint was involved in 80% of the type C injuries and showed a dorsal subluxation in 17% of all cases. Similar to the results of type A2 and A3 fractures, type B and C fractures of the distal radius also may be underestimated in standard radiographs. This concerns important components such as the involvement of the radiocarpal joint surface and concomitant injuries of the distal radioulnar joint. Since joint congruency is an important predictor of outcome, CT scanning should be used more generously for planning and controlling surgical therapy."
CD010023,0,16075778,0,The management of scaphoid fractures.,"Appropriate management of scaphoid fractures is important because of the risk of long-term complications such as delayed or non-union, pain and disability. Up to 25% of scaphoid fractures are not visible on the initial radiographs. Consequently, all clinically suspected scaphoid fractures are treated as fractures with cast immobilisation until cause of the symptoms is clarified. The diagnosis often utilises a number of second line investigations that are generally performed 10-14 days after the injury. Bone scintigraphy is currently the most commonly used of these as it rarely misses a fracture. However, it does not visualise anatomical structure and therefore alternative diagnoses are difficult. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is at least as sensitive and more specific than bone scanning and has the advantages of being able to identify other lesions and not expose the patient to any radiation. Furthermore, the scan may be performed as early as 2.8 days following an injury rather than 10 days later in the case of a bone scan. Although the cost of MRI is higher than other imaging modalities, it may be cost-effective in the overall management of patients with occult scaphoid fractures since it may prevent unnecessary cast immobilisation in active people. The most appropriate method of cast immobilisation is presently unclear but evidence exists for improved clinical outcomes in those that have both the thumb and elbow immobilised for the first six weeks."

There was a close correlation between increased uptake in the metacarpophalangeal joints and the metacarpal bones, suggesting that the increased uptake in RSD is not confined to the periarticular areas as has been previously reported but occurs throughout the affected region. In seven cases examined 3 months after fracture, RSD was associated with a significant increase in uptake at all sites in the hand on the delayed scan which was not seen in matched post-fracture controls, confirming that increased uptake on delayed bone scintography is a sensitive test for the presence of RSD even in the presence of a fracture of the wrist. The early increased uptake gradually returned to normal. Local tenderness assessed by dolorimetry was correlated with increased uptake, suggesting that the bone scan is not only useful as a diagnostic tool but also provides a quantitative indication of the severity of the condition which may be useful in planning and assessing treatments."

Five healthy volunteers and 28 patients with scaphoid fractures underwent M.R.I., which made possible a definitive diagnosis of scaphoid fractures at an early stage. A fresh fracture was identified by decreased or iso signal intensity on the T1-weighted image and increased signal intensity on the T2-weighted image. This increase continued until bony union was apparent on radiographs. On the T2-weighted image, high signal intensity was characteristic of fresh fractures and suggested that bony union was possible. When bony union was complete, the intensity of the signal for the scaphoid on both T1- and T2-weighted images returned to normal.

CD010023,0,3169970,0,99Tcm-MDP bone scanning of injuries of the carpal scaphoid.,"Clinical injuries of the carpal scaphoid are frequently seen at accident and emergency departments. Some exhibit delayed radiographic visualization of a fracture. The radioisotope bone scan is a sensitive test and increased uptake is observed in healing fractures. Twenty-three patients with an initial diagnosis of clinical fractures of the scaphoid were studied clinically, radiologically and independently by 99Tcm-MDP isotope scans. Three-quarters of the patients required only 1 month's management. Their corresponding bone scans were normal or not suggestive of a fracture. The remaining 25 per cent, who clinically required a more prolonged treatment (greater than or equal to 5 weeks' immobilization), were noted independently to have positive scans whether a fracture was observed or not. It is concluded that there is a stronger correlation between clinical examination and a bone scan than with a standard radiographic examination. It is proposed that patients still tender at 3 weeks should have a carpal isotope bone scan to identify if there is an important wrist injury and appropriate treatment commenced."
CD010023,0,20879420,0,Calibration and use of intraoperative cone-beam computed tomography: an in-vitro study for wrist fracture.,"The standard workflow in many image-guided procedures, preoperative imaging followed by intraoperative registration, can be a challenging process and is not readily adaptable to certain anatomical regions such as the wrist. In this study we present an alternative, consisting of a preoperative registration calibration and intraoperative navigation using 3D cone-beam CT. A custom calibration tool was developed to preoperatively register an optical tracking system to the imaging space of a digital angiographic C-arm. This preoperative registration was then applied to perform direct navigation using intraoperatively acquired images for the purposes of an in-vitro wrist fixation procedure. A validation study was performed to assess the stability of the registration and found that the mean registration error was approximately 0.3 mm. When compared to two conventional techniques, our navigated wrist repair achieved equal or better screw placement, with fewer drilling attempts and no additional radiation exposure to the patient. These studies suggest that preoperative registration coupled with direct navigation using procedure-specific graphical rendering, is potentially a highly accurate and effective means of performing image-guided interventions."
CD010023,0,19226035,0,Evaluating bone union of distal radius fractures by measuring impedance values.,"The measurement of impedance is a noninvasive and simple quantitative technique for evaluation of fracture healing. Fractures of the distal radius are the most common long bone fractures, accounting for approximately 20% to 25% of all acute fractures. External fixators have been applied clinically to treat unstable distal radius fractures. The evaluation of radiological findings and clinical signs are current standard methods and are effective in assessing fracture union of the distal radius, but these methods are dependent on subjective elements. For the objective methods, previous studies have shown that measurement of bone mineral density, ultrasound, quantitative computed tomography, and acoustic emission are useful in evaluating bone union. However, due to the complexity and high radiation dose associated with these methods, are seldom used clinically. This study was undertaken to examine the correlation between bone union and impedance at the site of digital radius fractures treated with an external fixator, using an alternating current electrical stimulator and a digital oscilloscope."

CD010023,0,11433158,0,Normal ranges of scapholunate distance in children 6 to 14 years old.,"The purpose of this study was to determine the normal ranges of scapholunate distance (SLD) applicable to children. Bone age radiographs of 85 children (36 boys, 49 girls) 6 to 14 years of age were used to establish the normal ranges. Repeated-measures analysis of variance revealed significant age and gender differences. Therefore, linear regression was used to determine normal SLD ranges separately for girls and boys based on chronologic age and bone age. SLD normal ranges were similar for chronologic age and bone age. Interobserver and intraobserver agreement was excellent. There was no significant age by gender interaction found, indicating that although boys had significantly longer distances than girls, both showed a similar rate of decreasing SLD distance with age. These results provide age-and gender-based normal ranges of SLD in young children. These results may be useful in assessing traumatic soft tissue injuries about the pediatric wrist. Of note, only three girls and two boys (all 12 years or older) met the adult criterion of normal SLD of < or = 2 mm."
CD010023,0,19662447,0,Multiple occult wrist bone injuries and joint effusions: prevalence and distribution on MRI.,"This study aims (1) to assess the prevalence and distribution of multiple occult injuries of the carpal bones and the distal forearm in patients with wrist pain and negative radiographs following trauma and (2) to evaluate the distribution and significance of joint effusions in the wrists with multiple osseous injuries. One hundred and thirty-one subjects, 74 men and 57 women, were consecutively examined in two institutions. All were acute trauma patients with negative X-rays whose clinical examination suggested possible fracture at the wrist or the distal forearm. Magnetic resonance (MR) wrist imaging was performed with and without fat saturation sequences. The MR images were analysed for detection of occult trabecular contusions and cortical discontinuity in the carpus, the distal forearm and the metacarpal bases. The prevalence and distribution of the injuries were assessed along with the distribution of joint effusions. Eight patients were excluded due to inadequate image quality. Two patients had bilateral injury. A total of 125 wrists were analysed. Seventy-eight (62.4%) wrists had occult bone injuries. Among these 78, 53 (68%) wrists had more than one injured bone. Twenty-five wrists (32%) had one injured bone. The highest number of injured bones per wrist was six. Injuries with a visible fracture line were seen in 29 (37.1%) wrists on MRI. The distal radius was the most frequent location for occult fracture line (11 cases). The injuries without a fracture line (contusion) were present in 49 (63%) wrists; they were detected more frequently in the scaphoid (35 cases). The lunate (29 cases) and the triquetrum (26 cases) were almost equally affected. The bone that was less frequently injured was the pisiform (four cases). Joint effusions were present in all 53 wrists with multiple bone lesions but more often situated in the ulnocarpal space [27 (50.3%) wrists]. There was no correlation between effusions in multiple locations (grades III and IV) and multiple bone injuries. This study revealed the presence of multifocal trabecular contusions without correlation with increased joint effusions in patients with negative radiographs and persistent pain. The clinical significance of these findings deserves further investigation."

CD010023,0,2348928,0,Diagnostic problems of scaphoid fractures: the value of radionuclide bone scintigraphy.,"The diagnosis fracture of the scaphoid bone based on mere X-ray examination is unreliable. A correct diagnosis of scaphoid fractures is essential for the prevention of avascular necrosis of the proximal fragment and of pseudo-arthrosis. Thirty-three patients with a clinically suspected scaphoid fracture and a normal radiograph were examined. These patients had supplementary 99mTc-MDP scintigraphy. Eight of the 33 patients had normal scans, 12 patients had a scaphoid fracture and 17 had other fractures. Based on our findings, radionuclide bone scintigraphy is useful and accurate for the diagnosis or exclusion of fractures of the scaphoid and other carpal bones."
CD010023,0,22386473,0,Demographic and medical parameters in the development of complex regional pain syndrome type 1 (CRPS1): prospective study on 596 patients with a fracture.,"Limited data are available on the incidence of complex regional pain syndrome type 1 (CRPS1) and on demographic and medical risk factors for the development of CRPS1. The objective of this study was to investigate the incidence of CRPS1 in patients with a fracture using 3 sets of diagnostic criteria and to evaluate the association between demographic/medical factors and the development of CRPS1 diagnosed with the Harden and Bruehl criteria. A prospective multicenter cohort study of 596 patients (ages 18 years and older) with a single fracture of the wrist, scaphoid, ankle, or metatarsal V, recruited patients from the emergency rooms of 3 Dutch hospitals. Of the 596 participants, 42 (7.0%) were diagnosed with CRPS1 according to the Harden and Bruehl criteria, 289 (48.5%) according to the International Association for the Study of Pain criteria, and 127 (21.3%) according to the criteria of Veldman. An analysis of the medical and demographic differences revealed that patients in whom CRPS1 later developed more often had intra-articular fractures, fracture dislocations, rheumatoid arthritis, or musculoskeletal comorbidities. An ankle fracture, dislocation, and an intra-articular fracture contributed significantly to the prediction of the development of CRPS1. No CRPS1 patients were symptom free at 12 months (T3). At baseline, patients with CRPS1 had significantly more pain than patients without CRPS1 (P<.001). The incidence of the diagnosis of CRPS1 after a single fracture depends to a large extent on the diagnostic criteria used. After a fracture, 7% of the patients developed CRPS1 and none of the patients were free of symptoms at 1-year follow-up."

CD010023,0,17951122,0,Comparison of proximal row carpectomy and midcarpal arthrodesis for the treatment of scaphoid nonunion advanced collapse (SNAC-wrist) and scapholunate advanced collapse (SLAC-wrist) in stage II.,"Traumatic instability of the proximal carpal row is based either on a scaphoid fracture or a scapholunate dissociation. Long-standing scaphoid nonunion or scapholunate ligament insufficiency may lead to a carpal collapse and subsequent arthrosis. Controversy exists regarding the appropriate salvage procedure for patients with scapholunate advanced collapse (SLAC)- or scaphoid nonunion advanced collapse (SNAC)-wrist in stage II. Proximal row carpectomy (PRC) and midcarpal arthrodesis (MCA) are two commonly used options. The purpose of this retrospective study was to evaluate the functional outcome and pain relief in SNAC-SLAC-wrist stage II after MCA, compared to PRC in a long term follow up."
CD010023,0,11903171,0,Magnetic resonance imaging of the wrist ligaments.,"The advent of small arthroscopes has enabled the hand surgeon to visualize the ligaments of the wrist directly with resultant increased accuracy in diagnosing and treating pathology. Orthopaedists are now demanding a preoperative assessment and this, in turn, has necessitated that radiologists have a comprehensive understanding of wrist anatomy. High resolution MR imaging can identify the wrist ligaments reliably and provide information concerning their integrity. Interpretation is not straightforward; there is considerable anatomic variation, and there are perforations, defects and degenerative tears that can be troublesome in diagnosing injury. However, with experience and attention to anatomic detail, the radiologist can provide useful information regarding structural abnormalities. When injured, the ligaments of the wrist behave as other joint ligaments do. Findings following injury include discontinuity of normal striated bands, incomplete disruption, irregularities and alteration in normal signal. Fluid pooling around a ligament and concomitant bone injury are other clues to injury. The identification of such structural abnormalities may help to explain altered biomechanics and improve the management of patients following wrist injury."
CD010023,0,12665700,0,In vivo measurement of apparent trabecular bone structure of the radius in women with low bone density discriminates patients with recent wrist fracture from those without fracture.,"The purpose of this cross-sectional case-control study was to determine whether indices of bone structure at the 4% site of the radius discriminate women who have sustained a recent low-energy fracture of the contralateral distal radius (n = 21) from women with similar bone density and no history of fracture (n = 21). Images of the distal forearm were acquired using peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) and were analyzed using in-house-developed software to determine indices of trabecular bone structure (average hole size [H(A)], maximum hole size, and connectivity index). The same images were analyzed using commercial software to determine bone density, mass, geometry, and torsional strength. The fracture group had significantly larger H(A) (p = 0.03). No other bone variable differed between groups. Individual H(A) values were compared to the mean value for young adult women (n = 42). The odds ratio (95% confidence interval) associated with an H(A) >2 SDs above the young adult mean was 5.4 (1.2-24.3). Thus, estimation of in vivo trabecular bone porosity by measuring the average diameter of the pQCT-imaged marrow spaces in the ultradistal radius identifies individuals with low bone mass most at risk for osteoporotic fracture."

We report a case which was clinically asymptomatic and involved the scaphoid fossa of the anterior surface of the pinna. The pathological process consisted of degenerative changes of the auricular cartilage which produced a cavity containing a serous fluid. No etiologic factor was found, in particular no trauma. The posterior wall of the cyst was excised under local anesthesia. This case allowed us to review the clinical, histopathological features and surgical difficulties of this rare lesion."
CD010023,0,18586545,0,[Scaphoid malunion].,"Scaphoid fracture and healing are often difficult to diagnose. The scaphoid bone may heal in an abnormal position and this malunion is usually in flexion and shortening. Fractures of the mid or distal part of the bone are mainly concerned. This malunion may be the cause of an alteration of the carpal mechanics and finally of osteoarthritis revealed by pain and decrease of motion and strength. The intrascaphoid angle of Amadio helps to calculate the magnitude of the deformity and to plan the correction. This malunion has to be corrected only if symptomatic. Two other types of malunions exist: healing with a rotation of the distal fragment, and healing with irregular contours which may also lead to arthritis. Correction of the malunion will be performed after having assessed precisely measurements of the deformity using comparative X-rays, special views, carpal indices and eventually a dedicated specific software. In the literature may be found a certain number of papers where scaphoid osteotomy combined with a trapezoidal bone graft and a bone fixation using a screw have been performed with success and healing for all cases. This procedure may be performed without hesitation for a symptomatic healed scaphoid, even if it has been operated before for nonunion."

CD010023,0,9026486,0,[Ulnodorsal impingement syndrome: meniscus lesions of the wrist].,"In a consecutive series of 166 wrist arthroscopies, a lesion of the meniscus was found in 16 patients. All of them complained of ulnar wrist pain evoked by axial load in extension. 14 patients had previous wrist trauma. The preoperative physical examination showed marked ulnodorsal tenderness on palpation and the examiner could feel crepitation by passive motion in the radial-ulnar direction. The meniscus represents a part of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC). At this time it is not possible by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to differentiate between articular disc and meniscus lesion. In contrast the two structures are clearly identifiable by arthroscopy especially if there is a radial tear through the meniscus or even a complete avulsion from its insertion on the palmar aspect of the triquetrum. The avulsed part of the meniscus can prolapse into the ulnocarpal joint, causing an impingement phenomenon."
CD010023,0,8230827,0,[The utility of three-phase bone scintigraphy in the assessment of fractured carpal scaphoid].,"Thirty-seven joints in 36 patients with a fractured carpal scaphoid were evaluated by three-phase bone scintigraphy. They were classified into two groups according to their progress. Some were in good clinical condition and some in a non-union condition. Increased blood flow in the radial arteries and ample perfusion on and around the scaphoid bones on blood flow images suggested a good clinical course. The activity and the effectiveness of remodeling correlated well with the degree of scaphoid uptake on blood pool images taken more than seven days after the injury. Scaphoid uptake was more localized or there was almost none on blood pool images in cases with nearly complete recovery while it was amply visualized on static images. Blood pool images were indispensable for analyzing lesions and evaluating the clinical course. Two typical findings of scaphoid fractures were found on both blood pool and static images. One was diffusely increased scaphoid uptake seen in cases with a good clinical course, and the other was decreased uptake at proximal fragments seen in cases with non-union. It is concluded that three-phase bone scintigraphy provides useful information for evaluating the process of scaphoid fractures which cannot be obtained by means of conventional bone scintigraphy."
CD010023,0,10951111,0,Acute fractures of the scaphoid.,"Nondisplaced fractures of the scaphoid heal with cast immobilization in most cases, but operative treatment is being offered with greater frequency to active patients as an approach to reduce the period of cast immobilization. Computed tomography is more useful for evaluating displacement than standard radiography. Displaced fractures are at greater risk for nonunion and malunion-both of which have been associated with the development of radiocarpal arthritis in long-term studies--and should therefore be treated operatively. Surgical treatment is also recommended for complex fractures (open fractures, perilunate fracture-dislocations, and scaphoid fractures associated with fracture of the distal radius), very proximal fractures, and fractures for which the diagnosis and treatment have been delayed. Operative treatment of fractures of the scaphoid has been simplified by the development of cannulated screws. Internal fixation of fractures of the scaphoid may offer some advantages, including earlier return to athletics or manual labor."

CD010023,0,3260727,0,Spontaneous osteonecrosis of the tarsal navicular in adults: imaging findings.,"We encountered five otherwise healthy adults with alterations of the tarsal navicular bone compatible with spontaneous osteonecrosis. Four women had bilateral involvement and one man had unilateral involvement. The patients were 23-71 years old. The disorder was initially described by Mueller and Weiss and should not be confused with Koehler disease (osteochondrosis of the tarsal navicular in children). This group of patients was compared with five other patients (29-74 years old) with similar radiographic and clinical changes in whom an underlying disease (rheumatoid arthritis, renal failure, trauma, and lupus erythematosus) associated with osteonecrosis was known. Routine radiography in both groups defined characteristic abnormalities of the navicular bone (decreased size, a comma-shaped configuration, increased radiodensity, fragmentation, and medial or medial and dorsal osseous protrusion). MR in three patients confirmed alterations consistent with osteonecrosis. Three of the patients without underlying disease had bilateral involvement on plain films, with flat feet and hindfoot valgus deformity, leading to local pain and deformity. In a fourth patient, bilateral distribution was documented by MR as marrow alterations. Although no certain pathogenic explanation for spontaneous osteonecrosis of the tarsal navicular is known, trauma and chronic stress changes caused by physiologic pressure on the medial longitudinal arch in hindfoot valgus and increased tension forces of the plantar aponeurosis during weight-bearing (in pes planus) may be important. Discrimination of primary from secondary osteonecrosis of the tarsal navicular bone is not possible by radiologic means alone, although bilateral distribution, particularly in women, favors the diagnosis of spontaneous disease."

A new cine-MR arthrography technique, with image acquisition at every 5 s during intra-articular injection, was performed in 17 subjects. The purpose of this study was to determine the diagnostic value of MR arthrography in ligamentous lesions of the wrist and to assess the value of cine-MR arthrography in comparison with arthroscopy and/or surgery.

CD010023,0,20824422,0,[Treatment of carpal fractures. Recommendations of the Hand Surgery Group of the German Trauma Society].,"The primary goal in the treatment of carpal fractures is the preservation of a painless wrist function. Scaphoid fractures are the most common carpal fractures and when such a fracture is clinically suspected CT or MRI scans are usually advisable. Only stable and non-displaced scaphoid fractures can be treated conservatively, all other fractures require internal fixation with restoration of normal anatomy. Second most common are fractures of the triquetrum which can occur as chip avulsions of the dorsal rim and are usually treated symptomatically. Fractures of the body of the triquetrum should be treated according to the degree of instability and displacement. This is virtually true for all carpal bones. Perilunate fracture dislocations of the carpus deserve special attention. In these severe injuries a fracture line can run through all carpal bones but the scaphoid is mostly affected. Accurate reduction and internal fixation by screws and K-wires are indicated not only in these cases, but also in carpometacarpal fracture dislocations."

CD010023,0,10789100,0,Results of treatment of 22 navicular stress fractures and a new proposed radiographic classification system.,"Twenty-two navicular stress fractures sustained during athletic activity were retrospectively reviewed for return to activity time and the appearance of fracture pattern on computerized tomography. There were 10 females and nine males, with the average patient age being 27.2 years. Three patients sustained bilateral injuries at separate times. Average follow-up was 36.5 months. Nine patients underwent open reduction, internal fixation (some with bone grafting); this group's average return to activity (RTA) was 3.1 +/- 1.2 months (range, 1.5-5 months). Thirteen patients treated conservatively had an average return to activity of 4.3 +/- 2.8 months (range, 2-13 months). The difference between the two groups' RTA was significant (p = .02). Eleven patients utilized pulsed electromagnetic fields (PEMF) and had an average RTA of 4.2 +/- 3.4 months, 27.3% of those patients with PEMF also had surgery. Two conservatively treated fractures that took 5 and 8 months to RTA, respectively, re-fractured during the treatment process. Retrospective review showed CT fracture patterns in the frontal plane that were classified as: dorsal cortical break (type I), fracture propagation into the navicular body (type II), and fracture propagation into another cortex (type III). This is a proposed classification system. It includes modifiers ""A"" (avascular necrosis of a portion of the navicular); ""C"" (cystic changes of the fracture), and ""S"" (sclerosis of the margins of the fracture), the latter of which was most common in our series, particularly in continually symptomatic patients. Type I fractures were more likely to receive conservative treatment (p = .02) and type III fractures took significantly longer to heal than types I and II (p values .001 and .01, respectively). Type I and II injuries had an average RTA of 3.0 and 3.6 months, respectively. Type III injuries had an average RTA of 6.8 months. Based on our findings, we recommend surgery for patients with these modifiers, particularly with type II and III injuries. Conservative treatment may be prolonged, and requires at least 6 weeks of nonweightbearing in a below-knee cast/boot to be successful."

The subject groups analyzed consisted of 40 asymptomatic volunteers and 30 patients with various wrist disorders (fractures, instabilities). In 11 anatomic specimens, this kinematic analysis was completed by a radiographic morphologic study and an investigation of capsular ligament anatomy. Clinical applications showed that carpal bone motion in the injured wrist was not significantly different from contralateral, asymptomatic wrist motion. In both wrists of patients with unilateral pathology, however, significant differences were observed as compared with asymptomatic volunteers. Scaphoid motion was bilaterally altered, suggesting the existence of anatomic or kinematic factors predisposing to certain carpal pathologies."

Feasibility of transfixion wire placement.,"The advantages of Ilizarov external fixation, allowing early motion of adjacent joints during fixation of periarticular fractures, have not yet been applied to distal radius fractures. A magnetic resonance imaging study of 10 normal volunteers evaluated the safety of passing percutaneous transfixion pins across the distal radius in 3 forearm positions. Even in the optimal forearm position, the safe zones between the transfixion pin, vessel, nerve, or tendon was small, suggesting that open placement would be required. A cadaver study in 8 specimens demonstrated that the pins could be placed with an open technique using an aiming device and that the pins could be placed without limiting forearm rotation. The proximity of vital structures to transfixion pins dictates open placement to safely apply Ilizarov fixation to distal radius fractures."
CD010023,0,12027487,0,Beware of the ulno-palmar distal radial fragment.,"Five patients sustained isolated fractures of the ulnopalmar rim of the distal radius. In three cases the fragment was small and was classed as an avulsion fracture of the short radiolunate ligament. Palmar wrist subluxation occurred in all cases, four during treatment in a cast or splint. The ulnopalmar rim of the distal radius contributes to the stability of the radiocarpal joint and fractures in this region merit particular attention."
CD010023,0,6300958,0,Hand and wrist arthropathies of hemochromatosis and calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease: distinct radiographic features.,"Radiographic features of hand and wrist involvement in 26 patients with hemochromatosis and in 26 patients with idiopathic calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) crystal deposition disease were compared. Two radiologists independently examined the radiographs without knowledge of the specific group to which the patient belonged. The results of this study clearly establish that structural joint diseases in the two disorders are not identical. Characteristic findings allow the radiologist to favor one diagnosis over the other. These radiographic differences indicate that the arthropathy of hemochromatosis is related to factors additional to the presence of CPPD crystals, specifically, the more prevalent narrowing of the metacarpophalangeal joint spaces, including those in the fourth and fifth digits, peculiar hook-like osteophytes on the radial aspect of the metacarpal heads, and less prevalent separation of the scaphoid and the lunate."

CD010023,0,3383159,0,Three-dimensional surface reconstruction of the carpal bones from CT scans: transaxial versus coronal technique.,"Computer methods for reconstruction of three-dimensional (3-D) images from standard CT scans have been developed. The process does not require special computer knowledge and can be performed with a unmodified CT scanner. 3-D images are especially valuable for conveying information to nonradiologist physicians, who are unfamiliar with the numerous slice-format images produced in a standard CT examination. The utility of these methods for clarification of areas of complex skeletal anatomy has been previously demonstrated in the literature. We performed 3-D imaging on a normal isolated cadaver hand and on a patient with scaphoid fracture. In both cases the 3-D images obtained had excellent osseous anatomical detail. A method of acquisition of high quality wrist CT scans, suitable for 3-D processing, is suggested."
CD010023,0,20437238,0,Floating fat in the wrist joint and in the tendon sheaths.,"A traumatic fat effusion in a tendon sheath is an unreported entity. We report on the clinical and imaging features, including radiography and computed tomography (CT), of a fat-density effusion in the wrist joint and tendon sheaths of the extensor pollicis longus, extensor carpi radialis longus, and extensor carpi radialis brevis in a 28-year-old patient after a roller-skating accident. Radiographs showed a fracture of the distal radius and a wrist joint effusion. Preoperative CT examination exhibited two distinct layers resulting in a fat-fluid level pathognomonic of lipohemarthrosis in the radiocarpal joint. In addition, a fat-density effusion was noted in the sheaths of the second and third compartment extensor tendons. The lipohemarthrosis depicted on imaging classically results from the extrusion of fat from bone marrow into the joint space after an intraarticular fracture. Similarly, a traumatic fat effusion in a tendon sheath presents characteristic imaging features that may help to diagnose a potentially overlooked fracture."
CD010023,0,15232430,0,Assessment of articular displacement of distal radius fractures.,"Intraarticular step and gap displacements represent the most common indication for surgical treatment of distal radius fractures. Most often, treatment decision making relies only on good-quality plain radiographs taken before and after reduction with measurement accuracy maximized by using the longitudinal axis method. When plain radiographs alone prove insufficient, CT scans or tomograms will significantly improve interobserver and intraobserver reliability of measurements, especially when evaluated using the arc method. Tomography is an effective method for postoperative evaluation of fractures immobilized in splints or casts. The role of MRI in assessing intraarticular distal radius fractures is limited to confirming injuries to carpal ligaments or the triangular fibrocartilage complex. Intraoperatively, we use fluoroscopy to obtain 30 degrees cephalad posteroanterior views and as 22 degrees lateral views to best observe articular surface reduction. Our current operative indications include fractures with radiocarpal or distal radioulnar joint step or gap deformities greater than 1-2 mm, gross distal radioulnar joint instability, or those with extensive metaphyseal comminution rendering them particularly unstable after closed reduction. In general, we tend to lean toward operative fixation in younger, more active patients."

CD010023,0,8771471,0,Clinical assessment of scaphoid injuries and the detection of fractures.,"Difficulty in interpreting X-rays following carpal injury emphasizes the importance of clinical assessment in diagnosing scaphoid fractures. The classical sign of tenderness in the anatomical snuffbox is not specific and leads to many unnecessary out-patient reviews. A prospective comparison was made between anatomical snuffbox, scaphoid tubercle and scaphoid compression tenderness as indicators of scaphoid fracture in 221 patients with suspected scaphoid injury. Swelling was determined by measuring the difference in circumference at the wrist joint to compare between fracture and soft tissue injury. Scaphoid compression tenderness was found to be the most accurate test with a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 80%. Swelling of the wrist joint was significantly greater when there was a fracture, compared to soft tissue injury alone, even when the initial X-ray was normal. This was independent of any physiological variation in circumference between dominant and non-dominant sides. Scaphoid compression tenderness is therefore suggested as the most accurate indicator of scaphoid fracture and marked swelling should raise suspicion even if the X-ray is normal."
CD010023,0,15855098,0,16-MDCT in the detection of occult wrist fractures: a comparison with skeletal scintigraphy.,"Our objective was to assess the potential use of MDCT in the detection of occult scaphoid fractures. Fifty-one patients with suspected radiographically occult scaphoid fractures at 10-14 days after trauma were investigated prospectively with skeletal scintigraphy and CT on the same day. Planar images of the wrist were taken 3 hr after IV injection of 400 MBq of (99m)Tc-methylene diphosphonate using a single-head gamma camera. CT was performed on a 16-MDCT machine using 0.75-mm detectors and reconstruction in 0.5-mm slices. Multiplanar reformatted images were then viewed in interactive cine mode. The examinations were reported independently, and discordant results were compared at follow-up. CT was positive for wrist fracture in 14 (27.4%) of 51 patients and skeletal scintigraphy in 23 (45.1%) of 51 patients. Even after retrospective review, there were seven discrepant cases (13.7%), all of which were positive for wrist fracture on scintigraphy but negative on CT. Four of these seven patients with discordant findings underwent further radiography at 6 weeks, which did not show fracture."
CD010023,0,21888527,0,"Forearm muscle size, strength, force, and power in relation to pQCT-derived bone strength at the radius in adults.","We aimed to examine the relationship between forearm muscle cross-sectional area (MCSA), muscle force, or rate of torque development (RTD) and 2 estimated radius bone strength indices - compressive bone strength index (BSI) at the wrist and strength strain index in torsion (SSI(p)) at the shaft - in healthy middle-aged males and females. Distal (4%) and shaft (65%) sites of nondominant forearms were scanned using peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) in a sample of 48 adults (mean age ± SD, 49.4 ± 2.4 y) to obtain estimated bone strength indices and MCSA. Muscle force, measured by grip dynamometry and wrist flexion RTD, was obtained using an isokinetic dynamometer. Hierarchical linear regressions, adjusted for weight, explained 27% and 36% of the BSI variance at the 4% site in males and premenopausal females, respectively (p < 0.05). At the radius shaft, weight explained 26% (p < 0.05) and 83% (p < 0.01) of SSI(p) variance. The unique variance of BSI explained by MCSA was 16% in males (p < 0.05) and 31% in females (p < 0.01). Grip force predicted variance in SSI(p) in males (p < 0.01) and BSI in females (p < 0.05). RTD did not explain any variance in BSI or SSI(p). Body weight was the only significant predictor (p < 0.05) of SSI(p) in females. Although forearm muscle size and grip strength are associated with estimates of radius bone strength at midlife, this relationship appears to be sex dependent. The differences observed between muscle size and strength properties and bone strength at distal and shaft sites of the radius suggest a property-, sex-, and site-specific relationship between muscle and bone in the forearm."
CD010023,0,2380517,0,Avascular necrosis after scaphoid fracture: a correlation of magnetic resonance imaging and histology.,"In this study 12 male patients with fractures of the middle third of the scaphoid had an magnetic resonance imaging study before open reduction and internal fixation in conjunction with bone grafting of the scaphoid. The patients' average age was 27 years (range, 17 to 37 years). At the time of surgery biopsy specimens were obtained from both the proximal and distal poles of the scaphoid. The length of time before surgery ranged from a minimum of 1 1/2 months in recently displaced fractures to a maximum of 10 years in established nonunions. Results of the biopsy showed that six patients had avascular necrosis noted in the proximal pole fragment. In three of these six patients avascular necrosis was confirmed by the absence of tetracycline labeling despite positive uptake noted in biopsy specimens from the bone graft site; the other three patients did not receive tetracycline labeling. Magnetic resonance imaging showed that all six of the patients with biopsy specimens of the proximal poles showing avascular necrosis demonstrated decreased signal intensity in the proximal pole fragment, whereas the plain radiographs demonstrated changes in the proximal pole in only three of the six patients. A decreased signal intensity from the proximal pole of the scaphoid may indicate a poor prognosis inasmuch as only three of the six patients had healing of the fracture even with bone grafting and internal fixation."

Initial radiographs of the patient showed only fractures in the bilateral proximal radius and the right triquetral bone. In addition, the bone scan showed focal increased uptake in the right scaphoid bone and lunate bone as well, suggesting fractures.

CD010023,0,8203322,0,Scapholunate dissociation.,"Scapholunate dissociation is the most frequent serious ligamentous injury of the wrist. Untreated, this injury can lead to disabling wrist pain, reduced wrist mobility and chronic degenerative arthritis. Early recognition of the injury by careful clinical and radiographic examination results in the most favorable prognosis. Standard posteroanterior and lateral radiographs of the wrist may be inadequate. Instead, radiographs obtained with the wrist in radial and ulnar deviation or with the hand gripping forcefully may be needed to reveal the instability of this joint. Magnetic resonance imaging may be required in special cases, as it is the only imaging modality that can directly depict abnormalities of the ligaments. Surgical intervention is recommended for optimal results. Chronic injuries require specialized operative and rehabilitative management."

CD010023,0,12763944,0,Early MRI in the management of clinical scaphoid fracture.,"The incidence of MRI detected scaphoid and other wrist fractures was determined in a clinical setting in patients with suspicion of scaphoid injury and negative initial radiographs. The influence on subsequent patient management was examined. Patients attending Accident and Emergency over a 25 month period with suspected scaphoid fracture and normal scaphoid series plain films were referred for wrist MRI. Scans comprising T(1) weighted spin echo and short tau inversion recovery (STIR) coronal sequences were performed in a dedicated extremity low field MRI scanner within 14 days of injury. Subsequent effects on patient management were ascertained by clinician completed questionnaire. 195 patients were scanned. There were 37 scaphoid fractures (19%), 28 distal radius fractures (14%), 9 fractures of other carpal bones (5%) and 119 studies with no fracture. The management of 180 patients (92%) was altered as a result of the MRI scan. Occult fractures are present in almost two fifths of patients with suspected scaphoid fracture and normal initial plain films. Half of these are scaphoid fractures. MRI allows an early definitive diagnosis to be made, changing patient management in over 90% of cases and should be regarded as the gold standard investigation in this population."

This procedure may be indicated either as first-line treatment in a case of advanced pseudarthrosis with osteoarthritis, particularly radio-scaphoid, or secondarily after scaphoid pseudarthrosis has been unsuccessfully treated by other methods. It is essential to make sure that the head of the capitatum and the radial surface of the lunate bone have a satisfactory appearance on plain X-rays, MRI and occasionally arthroscopy.

CD010023,0,2367667,0,Dorsal lunate tilt (DISI configuration): sign of scaphoid fracture displacement.,"Excessive dorsiflexion (dorsal tilting) of the lunate on a lateral wrist radiograph can be an important sign of carpal injury. Lunate dorsiflexion is a well-recognized sign of an intercarpal ligamentous injury pattern known as dorsal intercalated segment instability (DISI). It is less well recognized that excessive dorsal tilting of the lunate (DISI configuration) can also be produced by displacement of a scaphoid waist fracture. Since the management and prognosis of displaced scaphoid fractures may be quite different from those for nondisplaced fractures, radiologists can make an important contribution by recognizing dorsal tilting of the lunate and appreciating that it may be an important, indirect sign of scaphoid fracture displacement, which may not be directly visualized with standard wrist radiography. In this setting, computed tomography or complex motion tomography may be helpful for further evaluation of the scaphoid fracture."
CD010023,0,21780848,0,The non-surgical and surgical treatment of tarsal navicular stress fractures.,"Stress fractures of the tarsal navicular, first described in 1970, were initially thought to be rare injuries. Heightened awareness and increased participation in athletics has resulted in more frequent diagnosis and more aggressive treatment. The vascular supply of the tarsal navicular results in a relatively avascular zone in the central one-third, which experiences severe compressive forces during explosive manoeuvers such as jumping and sprinting. Repetitive activities can result in stress reactions or even fracture. Patients often initially complain of vague midfoot pain localized to the medial border of the foot. The pain is usually exacerbated by activity and relieved with rest. The diagnosis of tarsal navicular stress fracture is challenging because of the high false negative rate of plain radiographs. Additional diagnostic testing with bone scan, CT and MRI are often required for diagnosis. The proper treatment of tarsal navicular stress fractures has become a topic of debate as surgical intervention for these injuries has increased. In a recent meta-analysis, Torg et al. found that 96% of tarsal navicular stress fractures treated with non-weight-bearing (NWB) conservative treatment for 5 weeks went on to successful outcomes. However, only 44% of patients treated with weight-bearing (WB) conservative treatment had successful outcomes. Surgical treatment resulted in successful outcome in 82% of patients. Interestingly, the meta-analysis also found that fracture type did not correlate with outcomes, regardless of treatment. The meta-analysis also found no difference in time to return to activity between patients treated surgically and those who underwent NWB conservative treatment. The recent literature indicates that patients are undergoing surgery or are receiving WB conservative management as a first-line treatment option with the expectation that they will return to their activity more quickly. Although surgical treatment seems increasingly common, the results statistically demonstrate an inferior trend to conservative NWB management. Conservative NWB management is the standard of care for initial treatment of both partial and complete stress fractures of the tarsal navicular. WB conservative treatment and surgical intervention are not recommended."

CD010023,0,15291195,0,Stress fracture of the tarsal navicular.,"Stress fractures of the lower extremity are common among military members and athletes at all levels of participation. They typically occur when an individual begins a new or different type of physical training or during periods of abrupt increase in the level of training. Stress fractures represent an incomplete remodeling of bone that occurs secondary to repetitive mechanical loading. In response to this increased loading, the osteoclastic resorption of lamellar bone outpaces the ability of the osteoblasts to create new lamellar bone, eventually leading to structural failure. The following case report reviews the typical clinical presentation, imaging findings, and treatment of the tarsal navicular stress fracture."
CD010023,0,15513602,0,Experience with the AO Pi-plate for displaced intra-articular fractures of the distal radius.,"We have used open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) with the AO pi-plate in 32 displaced, intra-articular fractures of the distal radius. The indication was a displaced intra-articular fracture with a step-off of more than 1 mm and a gap between fragments of more than 3 mm, judged from the primary computed tomograms (CT). All fractures were classified as AO type C3. Twenty-nine patients were followed-up after a mean of 23 (9-46) months. The dorsal tilt, the radial length, the radial inclination, the articular step-off, and the intra-articular gap between fragments were substantially improved postoperatively. All the patients had excellent or good extra-articular and intra-articular alignment. Two patients had reduced extension power of the first finger. Seventeen patients had Disability of the arm, shoulder, and hand (DASH) scores of less than 10 points, five had scores between 11 and 20, three between 21 and 30, three between 31 and 40, and one patient had a score of 65 points. Complications occurred in two patients: one had a painful amputation neuroma of the superficial radial nerve, and one developed adhesions of the flexor tendons of the second and third fingers because the screws were too long and had penetrated the tendon sheaths. We conclude that the AO pi-plate is an excellent option for the most comminuted fractures of the distal radius."
CD010023,0,10399213,0,Three-dimensional motion patterns of the carpal bones: an in vivo study using three-dimensional computed tomography and clinical applications.,"A three-dimensional (3D) CT technique was developed to analyze in vivo segmental carpal kinematics. Transverse CT data of the distal forearm, carpals and proximal metacarpals was acquired and 3D reconstructed in various wrist positions. Carpal kinematics were analyzed in two groups of 20 asymptomatic volunteers, one group in neutral position, flexion and extension (45 degrees), and the other group in neutral position, radial (15 degrees) and ulnar deviation (30 degrees). Qualitative analysis included the 3D study of carpal anatomy, and comparison of carpal bone position between the different sets of data obtained. Carpal bone motion was quantified using rigid body and finite helical axis concepts. The results, although agreeing in principle with previous findings, showed important individual variations in carpal bone motion. Clinical applications were conducted in a series of 25 patients with various wrist disorders. There was no significant difference between the injured wrist and the heterolateral, asymptomatic wrist, but there was a significant difference between asymptomatic volunteers and both the injured wrist and heterolateral wrist of patients. In particular, scaphoid motion was altered bilaterally in our patient group, suggesting the existence of anatomic and/or kinematic factors predisposing to certain carpal pathologies. This hypothesis needs to be confirmed and refined."

An early MRI scan at 2 weeks allows the clinician to make the appropriate decision in this group of patients whose diagnoses include; occult scaphoid fractures, other occult carpal and radial fractures, ligamentous injuries and those without apparent injuries.

The technique used pre-operative planning from computed tomography images, registration to intra-operatively acquired three-dimensional ultrasound images, and intra-operative guidance using an optical tracking system. Two stand-alone software applications were developed. The first one was used to determine the surgical plan pre-operatively and the second one was used to guide the surgeon during screw insertion. Laboratory validation of the technique included measurements of the inter-operator and intra-operator variability in the outcome of scaphoid fixation using the proposed procedure, and also included comparison of the performance of this procedure with the conventional percutaneous fixation technique using fluoroscopy. The results showed that the tight accuracy requirements of percutaneous scaphoid fixation were met and that the consistency was superior to the conventional technique."

Within 24 hours an arthroscopy of the wrist was performed. With MR arthrography in 21 patients or 17 % of all patients, injury of the scapho-lunate ligament was diagnosed. In all patients this could be verified arthroscopically. In the remaining 104 patients, no SL-ligament lesions were diagnosed with the MR arthrography. However, partial lesions were found via arthroscopy in seven cases and complete lesions of the ligament were found in one case, where MRI findings expected an intact SL ligament. In the remaining 96 cases, the MRI could correctly exclude a lesion of the SL-ligament. The diagnosis of a SL-ligament lesion by means of MRI was correct in 100 % of the cases (specificity), the exclusion of such lesions in 72 % (sensitivity). Positive or negative predictive values of 100 % or 92 % were achieved. Since a sensitivity of 100 % cannot be reached at the moment, MR arthrography cannot replace arthroscopy. However, it could be a potent additional tool for wrist diagnosis if intraarticular contrast is used. It can facilitate the diagnostics and the indication for surgery of the wrist and help to reduce arthroscopic interventions for purely diagnostic purposes and without any therapeutic consequences. With improvement of the technique of magnet resonance tomography we can expect a further increase of accuracy in the clinical use of the MR arthrography in the diagnostic workup of the wrist."

The progressive increase in symptoms and physical findings, usually accompanied by a progressive deterioration in electrodiagnostic studies, facilitates the classification of the condition into early, intermediate, and advanced stages. The increase in interstitial pressure in the carpal tunnel is in the vast majority of cases idiopathic (spontaneous). It can also be caused by a myriad of other conditions that can be classified into three other categories: intrinsic factors that increase the volume of the tunnel (outside and inside the nerve), extrinsic factors that alter the contour of the tunnel, and repetitive/overuse conditions. In addition, there is another category of neuropathic factors that affect the nerve without increasing interstitial pressure. In rare situations CTS can present as an acute problem. Far less common than the chronic form of the condition, it can follow acute wrist trauma, rheumatologic disorders, hemorrhagic problems, vascular disorders affecting a patent median artery, and high pressure injection injuries. Prompt recognition is important, followed in most cases by urgent surgical decompression of the median nerve."

CD010023,0,10420293,0,[Relation of necrosis to outcome and site of fracture in scaphoid pseudarthrosis].,"Usually, untreated scaphoid fractures lead to non-union and partial or complete avascular necrosis. The purpose of our study was to examine the influence of location and fracture line on the pattern of necrosis. Therefore, 85 patients with scaphoid non-union were examined by enhanced highfield MRI. Fractures were classified by location and fracture line. A staging system based on signal intensity in T1-weighted spin-echo sequences in enhanced MRI was used to evaluate extent and location of avascular necrosis, which was found in 81% of our patients. In our patients, viability of the scaphoid was independent of the fracture line without dominance of vertical oblique fractures (2%). Based on our staging system, signal intensity as a sign of fragment viability was reduced in the proximal fragment in 46 patients, whereas in eight patients the distal fragment showed reduced viability. In 26 patients, no difference was found between proximal and distal fragments. Fractures proximal to the transition of middle to distal third showed less viability of the proximal fragment, not dependent of how proximal the fracture was seen. In triple fractures (6%) signal intensity of scaphoid bone was more reduced in enhanced MRI."
CD010023,0,20032000,0,Percutaneous retrograde screw fixation of non-displaced fractures of the scaphoid waist: an antirotation wire may not be necessary.,Some authors recommend using an antirotation wire when performing percutaneous screw fixation of acute non-displaced scaphoid waist fractures. The aim of this study of 21 cadaveric wrists was to assess the usefulness of such a wire in Herbert's B2-type fractures. A B2-type fracture was created experimentally on each scaphoid. An antirotation wire was inserted in eight wrists. Retrograde percutaneous fixation using a double-threaded headless cannulated screw was performed on all wrists. Computed tomography was used to measure interfragmentary rotation. No interfragmentary rotation was noted in either group. Our study suggests that using an antirotation wire may be unnecessary when performing retrograde percutaneous screw fixation of isolated B2-type scaphoid fractures.
CD010023,0,9480593,0,[Clinical examination of the injured wrist].,"A highly differentiated clinical examination of the wrist joint has been established in the past years. The history of the accident is usually unreliable, but patient's statement of a hyperflexion injury should alert for a fracture of the scaphoid tubercle. First of all, X-rays of the wrist indicate therapy in the case of fractures and gross dislocations. Only after some days of reduction of pain and swelling, a thorough clinical examination will be possible, which consists of: localizing points of tenderness, in particular the scapho- lunate, lunato-triquetal and the scapho-trapezio-trapezoid (SL-, LT- and STT-) joints and the triangular fibrocartilage (TFC); testing for abnormal dorso-palmar shifts of the carpus and the ulnar head; provoking catch up clunks by radio-ulnar movements of the clenched fist; provoking subluxations, in particular of the scaphoid in Watson's test; provoking pain in the discuss grinding test. Comparing clinical diagnosis with arthroscopic findings in 37 patients, the results for ligamentous lesions in general, SL ligament lesions in particular and for TFC lesions were as follows: sensitivity 100%, 91% and 69%, resp.; specificity 77%, 77% and 67%, resp.; positive predictive values 75%, 62% and 61%, respectively. In conclusion, exact clinical examination is a reliable tool to determine further diagnostics and therapy of wrist injuries."

CD010023,0,10835123,0,Metal artifact reduction sequence: early clinical applications.,"Artifact arising from metal hardware remains a significant problem in orthopedic magnetic resonance imaging. The metal artifact reduction sequence (MARS) reduces the size and intensity of susceptibility artifacts from magnetic field distortion. The sequence, which is based on view angle tilting in combination with increased gradient strength, can be conveniently used in conjunction with any spin-echo sequence and requires no additional imaging time. In patients with persistent pain after femoral neck fracture, the MARS technique allows visualization of marrow adjacent to hip screws, thus enabling diagnosis or exclusion of avascular necrosis. Other applications in the hip include assessment of periprosthetic soft tissues after hip joint replacement surgery, postoperative assessment after resection of bone tumors and reconstruction, and localization of unopacified methyl methacrylate cement prior to hip arthroplasty revision surgery. In the knee, the MARS technique allows visualization of structures adjacent to implanted metal staples, pins, or screws. The technique can significantly improve visualization of periprosthetic bone and soft-tissue structures even in patients who have undergone total knee arthroplasty. In patients with spinal fixation hardware, the MARS technique frequently allows visualization of the vertebral bodies and spinal canal contents. The technique can be helpful after wrist fusion or screw fixation of scaphoid fractures."

Diagnosis is commonly delayed, and outcome often suffers because physicians lack familiarity with the condition. Navicular stress fractures typically present in a running athlete who has gradually increasing pain in the dorsal mid-foot with occasional radiation of pain down the medial arch. Because initial plain films are often normal, the next diagnostic test of choice is triple-phase bone scan, which is positive early in the process and localizes the lesion well. After a positive bone scan, a computed tomographic scan should be obtained to provide anatomic detail and guide therapy. Nondisplaced, noncomminuted fractures respond well to six weeks of non-weight-bearing cast immobilization.

CD010023,0,9509598,0,Short tau inversion recovery magnetic resonance imaging in occult scaphoid injuries: effect on management.,"Over a 21-month period, 16 patients with possible scaphoid fractures, where conventional radiographs were essentially normal on the day of injury and 10 days later, were examined by coronal short tau inversion recovery (STIR) and T1 weighted sequences on a 0.2 Tesla scanner. The magnetic resonance (MR) examinations were done in between electively booked patients and management was altered in 50% of patients. It was expedient to do MR as radio-isotope facilities were not available at the hospital. In four patients, the examination was entirely normal. In another four patients, intercarpal fluid collections only were demonstrated (two generalized and two localized). In these patients a plaster cast was not re-applied. In two patients, bony injuries of the distal radius were demonstrated instead, with the scaphoid being normal. In the remaining six patients, variable appearances were shown, ranging from an actual fracture line demonstrated on both STIR and T1-weighted images with the remainder of the scaphoid being hyperintense on STIR and hypointense on T1, to non-visualization of the actual fracture line, which appeared to be represented by a much more hyperintense band through the waist of an otherwise hyperintense scaphoid on the STIR sequence. In all these patients a plaster cast was re-applied empirically, including those patients with a definite fracture and those patients with apparent bone contusion only. Although the T1-weighted images were anatomically superior, their addition did not alter management and it is suggested that coronal STIR images should suffice to demonstrate occult fractures of the scaphoid."

Plain radiography and CT allow an accurate anatomical approach of morphological changes associated with avascular necrosis of the lunate and the scaphoid fracture with complications. CT is readily available to detect nondisplaced fractures. However, early forms of necrosis can be misdiagnosed and evaluation of bone vitality is impossible. MRI is the best imaging modality to detect avascular necrosis and the intravenous injection of gadolinium improves the specificity of diagnosis of necrosis. The lack of enhancement of the proximal fragment of the scaphoid leads the surgeon to use a vascular graft in the treatment of nonunion. The technique has its limitations. The bone necrosis is histologically complex and contrast enhancement does not mean necessarily viability. However, MRI is still the most powerful imaging modality in the assessment of the bone marrow."

CD010023,0,21446799,0,Spatial measurement for safe placement of screws within the scaphoid using three-dimensional analysis.,"The placement of a headless screw within the scaphoid is important for successful fixation of fractured scaphoids. We ascertained the safe position of a screw using virtual collision experiments on a three-dimensionally reconstructed scaphoid bone and screw model, and applied measured angles to simple radiographs. We used images from computed tomograms of the wrists taken from 13 men to reconstruct a three-dimensional cortical image of the scaphoid. Inside the bone, we inserted a virtually reconstructed Herbert screw model and calculated the safe angle along the long axis of the scaphoid at which the screw did not collide with the bone in any sample, then applied measured safe angles to simple anteroposterior and lateral radiographs. In all experiments, the safe angle between the screw and the anteroposterior scaphoid line (defined from the most distal portion of the scaphoid where it met the capitate to the proximal position where the lunate and capitate meet) ranged from 8° to 27° in the anteroposterior view, and the safe angle between the screw and the lateral scaphoid line (defined from the most volar portion of the scaphoid tuberosity to the volar position where the scaphoid faced the radius) ranged from 2° to 26° in the lateral view. These ranges can be used as a guide for a safe position of the screw within the scaphoid in volar percutaneous fixation of screws in scaphoid fractures."

Follow-up radiographs were performed at average 11 (8-14) weeks after trauma, and these images were used as the ""gold standard"". A T1-weighted turbo gradient echo 3D and a tau short inversion recovery STIR were performed, both in coronal planes. The imaging time was less than 10 min. The images were evaluated independently by two radiologists. E-MRI detected occult fractures of the scaphoid in 9 patients, and of the distal radius in a further 6 patients. All these fractures were confirmed at follow-up radiographs. Furthermore, E-MRI revealed a fracture of the capitate bone in 1 patient, and of the triquetrum in 2 patients, and in 8 patients, bone bruise in 1 or more of the carpal bones. However, these fractures and bone lesions could not be confirmed by the follow-up radiographs. The agreement between the two examiners was high (kappa = 0.8) for E-MRI detection of fractures.

Thirty-five patients with a dislocated Colles' fracture were examined by computed tomography (CT) for metaphyseal bone defects. The size of the defect was assessed and related to the surface area of the cross-section of the distal radius at the site of the defect. The relative size of the defect correlated with the severity of dorsal angulation of the fracture but not with the shortening of the radius seen after cast immobilization. We concluded that secondary displacement of the distal radius is partly mediated through the metaphyseal cancellous bone defect, and to prevent malunion in dorsal angulation, operative treatment or possibly filling of the defect should be considered even as early as during primary reduction if a large defect is suspected."

However, today's bone fracture risk prediction, primarily based on bone density measurement, is not sufficiently precise. There is increasing evidence that, in addition to bone density, also the bone microarchitecture and its mechanical loading conditions are important factors determining the fracture risk. Recently, it has been shown that new high-resolution imaging techniques in combination with new computer modeling techniques based on the finite-element (FE) method can account for these additional factors. These techniques might provide information that is more relevant for the prediction of bone fracture risk. So far, however, these new imaged-based FE techniques have not been feasible in-vivo. The objectives of this study were to quantify the load transfer through the trabecular network in a distal radius using a computer model based on in-vivo high-resolution images and to determine if common regions of fractures can be explained as a result of high tissue loading in these regions. The left distal radius and the two adjacent carpal bones of a healthy volunteer were imaged using a high-resolution three-dimensional CT system providing an isotropic resolution of 165 microm. The bone representation was converted into a FE-model that was used to calculate stresses and strains in the trabecular network. The two carpal bones were loaded using different load ratios (for each load case 1000 N in total) representing impact forces on the hand either in near-neutral position or ulnar/radial deviation. The load transfer through the trabecular network of the radius was characterized by the tissue strain energy density (SED) distribution for all load cases. It was found that the distribution of the tissue loading depends on the ratio of the forces acting on the carpal bones. For all load cases the higher SED values (on average: 0.02 +/- 0.08 (S.D.) N mm(-2)) are found in a 10 mm region adjacent to the articular surface which corresponds well with the region where Colles- or Chauffeur-fractures occur. We expect that, eventually, this new approach can lead to a better prediction of the fracture risk than methods based on bone density alone since it accounts for the bone microstructure as well as its loading conditions."

Many of the tests described are somewhat costly (Table 31-3), and they should not be ordered indiscriminately. Rather, the need for each test is determined by a reasonable presumptive diagnosis, depending on the history, clinical examination, and routine roentgenograms (see Table 31-1). Finally, I must say that even an exhaustive work-up may not be fruitful, and occasionally the precise cause for the patient's pain is never clearly identified. Our knowledge of the wrist is incomplete, and our diagnostic tools are not infallible, but we must continue to try to sort out these difficult wrist problems.

CD010023,0,2011836,0,[Diagnosis of arthritis with the aid of imaging methods].,"Among imaging techniques plain radiographs still play an outstanding role in the assessment of osteoarthrosis. Main diagnostic features comprise joint space narrowing (often segmental in the initial phase), subchondral sclerosis and cyst formation (both predominantly in the stressed area of the joint), and osteophytes at areas of low stress, often at joint margins. Anatomy and stress characteristics of the joint involved decide upon pattern and extent of the degenerative changes. The most common sites of osteoarthrosis include the interphalangeal joints, often in combination with the first carpometacarpal and trapezio-scaphoid joints, hip, knee, and first metatarsophalangeal joint of the foot. For assessment of these easily accessible joints, conventional radiographic techniques usually provide sufficient information. In special situations where differential diagnostics are important, methods such as computerized tomography or scintigraphy may prove very helpful. In the hands of experienced users ultrasonography is able to depict accompanying soft tissue changes such as rotator cuff ruptures or cysts. Magnetic resonance imaging represents a promising tool for detection of very early osteoarthrosis; small areas of cartilage damage can be assessed adequately. Although this method will certainly give new insight into aspects of early degenerative disease, its use is still confined to research-oriented applications with respect to osteoarthrosis."

CD010023,0,12467720,0,Segmentation of carpal bones from CT images using skeletally coupled deformable models.,"The in vivo investigation of joint kinematics in normal and injured wrist requires the segmentation of carpal bones from 3D (CT) images, and their registration over time. The non-uniformity of bone tissue, ranging from dense cortical bone to textured spongy bone, the irregular shape of closely packed carpal bones, small inter-bone spaces compared to the resolution of CT images, along with the presence of blood vessels, and the inherent blurring of CT imaging render the segmentation of carpal bones a challenging task. We review the performance of statistical classification, deformable models (active contours), region growing, region competition, and morphological operations for this application. We then propose a model which combines several of these approaches in a unified framework. Specifically, our approach is to use a curve evolution implementation of region growing from initialized seeds, where growth is modulated by a skeletally-mediated competition between neighboring regions. The inter-seed skeleton, which we interpret as the predicted boundary of collision between two regions, is used to couple the growth of seeds and to mediate long-range competition between them. The implementation requires subpixel representations of each growing region as well as the inter-region skeleton. This method combines the advantages of active contour models, region growing, and both local and global region competition methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach for our application where many of the difficulties presented above are overcome as illustrated by synthetic and real examples. Since this segmentation method does not rely on domain-specific knowledge, it should be applicable to a range of other medical imaging segmentation tasks."

CD010023,0,12859103,0,Geometry of carpal scaphoid in Thais: anatomical study.,"In order to develop new surgical techniques on, and fixation devices for, carpal scaphoid fractures in Thais, the authors determined the mean and standard deviation of the length, width and thickness of 141 carpal scaphoid bones on 93 left and 48 right wrists from the skeletons of 99 Thai males and 42 Thai females. The deceased averaged 60 years (range, 22 to 89). The scaphoid length averaged 25.59 mm; the dorsal width at the distal, middle and proximal poles averaged 14.89, 10.23 and 7.08 mm, respectively; the palmar width at the distal, middle and proximal poles averaged 14.22, 9.81 and 7.44 mm, respectively; and the thickness at the distal, middle and proximal poles averaged 9.77, 10.96 and 9.19 mm, respectively. The authors found no signficant difference (p = 0.96) in the length and width of the Thai carpal scaphoid bone between the left and right wrist. The widths of the dorsal and palmar sides at the distal end were wider than the proximal end and tapered from the distal to the proximal pole. The thicknesses were constant throughout the length of the bone, ranging between 9 and 11 mm."

CD010023,0,1757132,0,Scaphoid fractures and wrist pain--time for new thinking.,"As with the practice of all medicine, an early accurate diagnosis is essential. The same applies after injury. The diagnosis should be made at the earliest opportunity--this should be done as soon as an appropriate expert is able to examine the patient, assess adequate radiographs and, where necessary, order special investigations such as a bone scan. By this means, distal radial fractures, injuries of the radioulna joint, dislocated lunates, Bennett's fractures, dorsal capsular wrist sprains, avulsion fractures etc. can be managed accordingly. Those patients in whom clinical examination, plain radiographs and/or bone scans show minor injuries can be advised about pain relief whilst staying active either at work or in the home using a light supportive removable bandage or splint. Where doubt remains and whilst keeping the patient comfortable, a bone scan may be requested. Its availability together with updated clinical and, if necessary, radiological assessment, will define a further group of patients who can be advised definitively either about active treatment or a return to normal activity. Only a few wrists will continue to defy definitive diagnosis requiring the continuance of expert advice and investigation. When a scaphoid fracture is diagnosed, its site, degree of displacement and any associated instability should determine the degree of intervention and the length of time required in plaster. This again gives the patient more information about the long-term future than many have had hitherto. The patient's individual requirements may be taken into account; some are happy to tolerate 2-3 months in plaster whilst others want the early function which an uncomplicated operation might offer.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Triquetral body fractures are the less common type of triquetral fractures but they can be missed on plain radiographs and a non-union can be associated with considerable morbidity and reduction in functional activities. We report a unique case of displaced isolated triquetral body fracture that was initially missed on plain radiographs and resulted in non-union. The fracture non-union was diagnosed on magnetic resonance imaging and was treated successfully with open reduction and internal fixation using compression screws, without bone grafting, and early mobilisation of the wrist allowing a return to premorbid activity levels. To our knowledge, this has not been previously described in the literature. We advocate early clinical suspicion of triquetral fractures in patients with persistent ulnar-sided wrist pain following trauma, and early evaluation using computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging."

CD010023,0,3818807,0,"Fractures of the carpus, excluding the scaphoid.","Carpal bone fractures comprise an important group of injuries that present difficulties in both diagnosis and treatment. These fractures may be missed for the following reasons: physician's low index of suspicion, the carpal bones' irregular contours and degree of overlap on radiographs making the fractures difficult to visualize, and the common occurrence of concomitant fractures of neighboring metacarpals, distal radius, or scaphoid, which misdirects the examiner. A high index of suspicion with careful clinical examination and elicitation of point tenderness is key to making the correct diagnosis (Fig. 14). Swelling, loss of motion, deformity, and crepitus are often minimal and are not reliable in distinguishing carpal fractures. Specific radiographic projections, tomograms, computerized tomographic scans, or bone scans are often required and should be considered in any wrist injury where the diagnosis is in question. A greater awareness of the fracture types, methods of diagnosis, and choices of treatment is essential for optimal management of these injuries."
CD010023,0,8142179,0,[Pathophysiology of perilunate dislocation].,"The anatomy of the palmar scapho-triquetral ligament was studied: on 15 hand specimens by means of gross anatomical dissections and MR imaging; and on a further 10 foetal wrist specimens, microanatomically. This ligament allows us to present the proximal carpal row as a socket, consisting of an upper part (the triquetrum, distal part of the scaphoid, and the dorsal and palmar scapho-triquetral ligament), and a base (the concave parts of the lunatum and scaphoid, connected by the scapho-lunate ligament). With a hyperextension wrist injury the upper part follows the distal part of the carpus, while the base remains fixed at the radius. The upper part slips away from the base, consequently, injuring the ligamentous structure, or causing a scaphoid fracture. The luno-triquetral and the palmar scapho-triquetral ligaments are also frequently torn. The overall prognosis depends on the grade of ligament damage. The arthroscopy allows us to estimate the state of the ligament structures, therefore, it is indicated before any reconstructive operation."

The common mechanism of trauma is a force applied to the palmar aspect of the wrist while it is in extreme dorsiflexion. Because early fracture diagnosis by x-ray study is difficult, all patients with a suspicious wrist injury and tenderness in the scaphoid region should be treated as if they have a fracture until radiographs at two and four weeks are normal. Treatment usually consists of immobilization using a long or short plaster arm cast. Various treatment methods, including electrical stimulation, are used when nonunion occurs.

The diagnoses were compared with subsequent follow-up. There were four scaphoid fractures, 10 other fractures and three significant ligamentous injuries. All scaphoid fractures were identified by MRI and BS. MRI showed better interobserver agreement for scaphoid injury than BS and fewer false positive reports. Significant ligamentous injury and carpal instability diagnosed by MRI were not evident on scintigraphy. Using fast scanning protocols, the cost of MRI is comparable with that of BS. MRI should be considered as the appropriate second line investigation in these clinical circumstances."

All fractures had been retained in a below elbow scaphoid plaster for a period of median eight (3-12) weeks. End of treatment was based on the absence of ""tenderness"" over the scaphoid and on radiographical signs of fracture union median ten (5-24) weeks after injury. At review 28 (80%) of the fractures were united based on standard radiographs and tomography. Four fractures ((11%) 95% confidence limits: 3-27%) were nonunions and three fractures (9%) were probably united. Tomography gave additional information about the state of union if the fracture was visible but unclassifiable on standard radiographs. Tenderness over the scaphoid was only found in the nonunions and probably united fractures. Radiographic and clinical evaluation of the fracture six months after injury is recommended."

CD010023,0,10212614,0,Tomography versus computed tomography for assessing step off in intraarticular distal radial fractures.,"Computed tomography scans have supplanted conventional tomography for many applications and often are considered the imaging study of choice for assessing intraarticular distal radial fractures. Concern about cost containment in healthcare delivery prompts the question of whether the two studies provide comparable information and at what cost. Common intraarticular distal radial fractures were created in 12 lightly embalmed cadaveric specimens. The fractures were fixed with radiolucent Kirschner wires. Articular step off was measured with a caliper. Plain radiographs, computed tomography scans, and trispiral tomograms were obtained of each specimen. Maximal step off was measured blindly by two musculoskeletal radiologists and four hand surgeons. The radiographic measurements were compared with the actual step off and expressed as a positive or negative deviation from the actual value. There was no statistically significant difference between computed tomography scans and tomograms in predicting step off. In addition, the difference between actual and radiographic measurements was insignificant in tomogram readings and different in one of the computed tomography measurements. In the authors' institution, a tomogram costs $200, and a computed tomography scan costs $562. Trispiral tomography is more accurate and cost effective than computed tomography, and thus when available should be considered the imaging modality of choice for assessing articular step off in distal radius fractures."

Radiography of the carpus was obtained. Bone scintigraphy was performed in all patients with negative initial radiographs. Follow-up investigation was performed in 100 patients and consisted of history, clinical examination, including measurement of grip strength and wrist movement, synovia stress test, Watson's scaphoid test, and radiographic examination. In 22 patients, clinical or radiological signs of carpal instability were found.

CD010023,0,11179626,0,Estimation of wrist fracture load using phalangeal speed of sound: an in vitro study.,"This study aimed to evaluate the ability of speed of sound (SOS) measured at the phalanges to estimate simulated wrist fracture load and stress. SOS was measured along the proximal phalanges of the second, third and fourth fingers using an ultrasound (US) system operating in axial transmission mode. The bone mineral density (BMD) of the radius and the phalanges was also measured with quantitative computed tomography (QCT) and dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and the combined cortical thickness (CCT) of the phalanges was measured from hand radiographs. After the measurements were completed, the radius was excised from the cadaver, embedded in polymethylmethacrylate and tested to failure on a servohydraulic testing machine. The configuration of the radius was chosen to simulate a fall onto the hand. Linear regression analysis showed a highly significant correlation between SOS (r = 0.76-0.94, p < 0.001), CCT (r = 0.86-0.90, p < 0.001) and BMD (r = 0.92-0.96, p < 0.0001) in the three proximal phalanges measured. SOS, BMD and CCT were significant predictors of fracture load (r = 0.60-0.69, p < 0.03) and stress (r = 0.65-0.77, p < 0.02). Cortical area and bone mineral content (BMC) of the radius were consistently higher predictors of fracture load (r = 0.76-0.82, p < 0.01 for area and r = 0.78-0.88, p < 0.01 for BMC) than BMD. The correlation of BMC and area was poorer with fracture stress. In a step-wise regression analysis using both phalangeal BMD and SOS, only SOS remained a significant predictor of fracture stress. In forward stepwise regression analysis, both cortical area and SOS were entered into the regression model to estimate fracture load. Only SOS remained significant in the model for estimating fracture stress. Phalangeal BMD was only entered in the combined model with the cortical area at the 4% site (r = 0.84, p = 0.002). Phalangeal SOS is a useful parameter in the assessment of bone status of the radius."
CD010023,0,11372305,0,Traumatic and reconstructive problems of the scaphoid.,"The management of acute scaphoid fractures should be oriented on the concept of fracture stability, ease of reduction, associated ligamentous injury, and risk of impaired blood supply, rather than the direction of the fracture line or location of the fracture within the scaphoid. The lack of predictability of successful fracture union and prognostic discrepancies of historic and contemporary classifications may be related to subtle differences of the internal vascular architecture of each scaphoid. Because the possibility of impaired vascularity is greater with fractures located in the proximal third, stable internal fixation is indicated to provide mechanical stability and fracture surface contact to enhance revascularization. Improved healing rates in a shorter time and earlier rehabilitation with percutaneous techniques of internal fixation have produced a clear shift from classic conservative treatment to internal skeletal fixation. Although the rates of union of well-vascularized nonunions have not been dramatically improved with the use of internal fixation as compared with inlay bone grafting, the restoration of scaphoid anatomy and prevention of malunion and associated carpal collapse with interpositional bone grafting techniques will reduce the risk of osteoarthritis."

Initially, postero-antérior and lateral views must be completed with an antero-posterior view, a scaphoid incidence and an oblique view. This initial examination can be completed secondarily by specific views for the carpal bones, dynamic X-Rays, CT scan or arthro CT scan. In non-traumatic cases, radiologic explorations look for osteo-articular or soft tissue abnormalities specific of a inflammatory or degenerative disease. The initial incidence is a postero-anterior view of both hands. It can be completed secondarly by other explorations (other X-Rays, Ultra-sound, CT scan or MRI)."

The usual circumstances leading to fracture of the pisiform bone include fall with reception on the hyperextended wrist, traffic accidents, and blunt trauma. The purpose of this work was to present a case of bilateral fracture of the pisiform bones. A 34-year-old woman presented with pain along the ulnar borders of both wrists after a fall. The mechanism of fracture was direct trauma on both hands after reception in radial inclination. The diagnosis was established late and conservative treatment was applied. After simple immobilization, the clinical and functional outcome was excellent. The anatomic position of the pisiform bone exposes it to direct trauma. Late diagnosis can favor osteoarthritic sequelae involving the pisotriquetral joint."

CD010023,0,22648431,0,Imaging and treatment of scaphoid fractures and their complications.,"The scaphoid is the most commonly fractured carpal bone, with frequent complications that are predisposed by its anatomical location, anatomical configuration (shape and length), and vascular supply. The most common mechanism of injury is a fall onto an outstretched hand. Imaging plays a significant role in the initial evaluation and treatment of scaphoid fractures and their complications. Radiography should be the first imaging modality in the initial evaluation and follow-up of scaphoid fractures. Computed tomography with its superb spatial resolution enables better visualization and characterization of the fracture line, and the amount of displacement and angulation of the fracture fragments. Using the metal reduction artifact with computed tomography allows good follow-up of scaphoid fractures despite surgical hardware. Magnetic resonance imaging without contrast is the imaging modality of choice for depiction of radiographically occult scaphoid fracture, bone contusion, and associated soft tissue injury; contrast-enhanced imaging aids assessment of scaphoid fracture nonunion, osteonecrosis, fracture healing after bone grafting, and revitalization of the necrotic bone after bone grafting. Proper identification and classification of scaphoid fracture and its complications is necessary for appropriate treatment. This article describes the normal anatomy, mechanism of injury, and classification of stable and unstable fractures, together with the imaging and treatment algorithm of scaphoid fractures and their complications with an emphasis on magnetic resonance imaging."

In the first case, a dorsal oblique fracture of the hamate was associated with a dorsal dislocation of the base of the fourth metacarpal. In the second case, a dorsal oblique fracture of the hamate was not associated with a dorsal dislocation of the base of the fifth metacarpal. This diagnosis should be suspected on initial review of plain radiographs, which must include an oblique view because of diagnostic difficulty for this injury.

A variety of treatment options are available for the vast array of fracture patterns. Research that explores bone fragility and fracture healing has led to new treatment modalities. As new products and methods are derived to aid in fracture healing it is essential to develop noninvasive and/or nondestructive techniques to assess structural information about bone. Quantitative assessment of macro-structural characteristics such as geometry, and microstructural features such as relative trabecular volume, trabecular spacing, and connectivity may improve our ability to estimate bone strength. Methods for quantitatively assessing macrostructure include (besides conventional radiographs) dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and computed tomography (CT), particularly volumetric quantitative computed tomography (vQCT). Methods for assessing microstructure of trabecular bone include high resolution computed tomography (hrCT), micro computed tomography (microCT), high resolution magnetic resonance (hrMR), and micro magnetic resonance microMR. Volumetric QCT, hrCT and hrMR are generally applicable in vivo; microCT and microMR are principally applicable in vitro. Clinically, the challenges for bone imaging include balancing the advantages of simple bone densitometry versus the more complex architectural features of bone, or the deeper research requirements versus the broader clinical needs."

CD010023,0,18753891,0,Whole bone geometry and bone quality in distal forearm fracture.,"Fracture of the distal radius is a sentinel for future increased risk of other ""osteoporotic"" fractures, in which the peak age for incidence of distal radius fracture is 5 to 10 years before that for spine and hip fractures. Mean bone mineral density (BMD) of the distal radius was lower in patients with osteoporosis compared with age- and sex-matched normal subjects. However, it has been shown that to predict the strength of the distal radius at the site where fractures occur requires more than measurement of bone mineral content (BMC) or BMD. Only moderate correlations have been found between forearm sites, which may be a result of differences in bone composition between sites. Different forearm sites may be used interchangeably for diagnostic purposes, but the prognostic value is not known. Using the distal radius as a screening tool for identifying individuals at risk of ""osteoporotic"" fracture shows that forearm site selection and accuracy of measurement can be important confounders in group studies.Improving resolution of computed tomography (CT) scanners has enabled quantitation of cortical bone density and cortical thickness. These measurements have enabled the mechanism of bone loss in the distal radius to be elucidated and show that, after menopause, bone loss is primarily through thinning of the cortex. CT imaging allows the precise localization of bone changes in individuals and should be of value in the assessment of the severity of osteoporosis. It also shows that this technology has the potential to determine the efficacy of therapeutic interventions. A concerted effort has been made to elucidate the interrelationships between the amount of bone and the geometry and that clinical imaging of BMC and/or cross-sectional area in the radius would provide improved prediction of an individual's risk of fracture.The technological tools are available, in the clinic, to accurately measure the 3-dimensional (3D) geometry of the distal radius and the amount of bone. In addition, the cortical and cancellous bone compartments can be analyzed separately. This capability, along with the easy accessibility of the distal radius to clinical imaging modalities, provides an excellent framework for longitudinal prospective studies to determine morphologic risk factors for osteoporotic fractures of the distal radius."
CD010023,0,1718357,0,Preiser's disease.,"Nine patients with the diagnosis of unilateral Preiser's disease were seen between 1970 and 1987. The mean age of four male and five female patients was 37 years (range, 20 to 70 years). The diagnosis was based on radiographic evidence of sclerosis, fragmentation, erosion, and collapse of the proximal pole of the scaphoid. Onset was usually insidious but two had a preexisting radial hypoplasia, a third had a modest scaphoid malunion, and a fourth had a recent fall. Treatment consisted of scaphoid excision and silicone rubber prosthetic replacement in three, debridement of necrotic bone fragments in one, and different periods of cast support and observation in the remaining five. No relationship to ulnar variance was seen. Mean follow-up was 6.9 years. Of the scaphoid implants, two had subluxated, but only one was painful. In the more conservatively treated group, pain and function were only modestly limiting in four, who returned to their original occupations as did the one treated by curettage of necrotic bone in the proximal pole. One patient (case 4) was severely incapacitated because of associated severe congenital anomalies of the lower extremities. Polyaxial tomography permitted a better assessment of the degree of involvement and carpal alignment. Preiser's disease is a rare affliction of the carpal scaphoid which may involve the entire bone in avascular changes but primarily leads to fragmentation and collapse of the proximal pole. A conservative approach to treatment is favored based on this experience."
CD010023,0,11147693,0,Distal radius epiphysiolysis associated with scaphoid fractures in immature patients: report of two cases and review of the literature.,Two cases of carpal scaphoid fractures associated with distal radius epiphysiolysis are presented. Only three cases of this unlikely combination were found in the English literature. One of the scaphoid fractures had to be confirmed by bone scan. Conservative treatment after gentle reduction of the radius fracture gave excellent results.
CD010023,0,18753892,0,Quantification of bone structural parameters and mechanical competence at the distal radius.,"For the clinician, predicting the fracture risk for individual patients is mainly restricted to the quantitative analysis of bone density. Several studies have shown that bone strength, an indicator for bone fracture risk, is only predicted moderately by bone density, indicating that there are other factors influencing bone competence. However, the relative importance of ""bone quantity"" and ""bone quality"" remains poorly understood. The objectives of this article are to describe some of the techniques used to measure the microarchitectural aspects of bone quality, how they can be quantified, and how these quantitative endpoints can be used in the assessment of bone competence. Special focus will be on the distal radius, a site with a high fracture incidence. With the introduction of high-resolution in vivo bone imaging systems, a new generation of imaging instruments has entered the arena allowing the reconstruction of the 3-dimensional microarchitecture of the bones at the wrist, thereby giving researchers and clinicians a powerful tool for the quantitative assessment of bone microstructure. In combination with large-scale finite element modeling, these methodologies have reached a level that it is now becoming possible to assess bone stiffness and strength in humans in a clinical setting. The procedure can help improve predictions of fracture risk, clarify the pathophysiology of skeletal diseases, and monitor the response to therapy."
CD010023,0,7061014,0,The diagnostic value of displacement of the fat stripe in fracture of the scaphoid bone.,"Soft tissue abnormalities on radiological examination can be useful in evaluating injury to various regions. In a retrospective study of X-ray pictures of 125 patients with injury to the wrist, it was possible to demonstrate an abnormal scaphoid fat stripe (SFS) in seventy-three out of seventy-eight cases with fracture of the scaphoid bone, compared to ten out of forty-seven cases without fracture."
CD010023,0,16019741,0,Combined fractures of the body and hook of hamate: a form of ulnar axial injury of the wrist.,"Fractures of the hamate are rare, and usually associated with athletes. We describe an unusual form of the injury involving fractures of the hook as well as an intra-articular medial facet. It is likely to be a result of high velocity ulnar component of the axial injury. Surgical treatment is advocated to achieve accurate reduction and apposition of the fifth carpometacarpal joint."
CD010023,0,17049527,0,The management of wrist injuries: an international perspective.,"Wrist injury is common and may significantly impair the overall function of the upper extremity unless properly managed. Fractures of the distal radius are particularly common among the aging population, accounting for nearly 1/6 of all fractures, often as a result of increased longevity with the subsequent underlying osteoporosis. New diagnostic tools, including wrist arthroscopy, magnetic resonance imaging, or computed tomography, are increasingly available in developed countries allowing accurate recognition and more effective resolution of lesions which would be otherwise missed using conventional methods. First world treatment standards, however, can scarcely be introduced in developing countries owing to, among other factors, different prevalence of problems, and the lack of resource to implement most modern technologies. If any program needs to be introduced that meets the demands of wrist injury management in the third world, aside from a better regionalisation of trauma care, it should emphasise adequate training of professionals in the use of more cost effective techniques of fracture reduction and stabilisation, applicable everywhere, with the minimum possible morbidity."
CD010023,0,15062213,0,Fractures of the navicular.,"Generally, large or significantly displaced intra-articular navicular fractures are treated best by surgical intervention. Open reduction and internal fixation of these injuries allow anatomic restoration of adjacent joint surfaces and preservation of length and stability along the medial column of the foot; intervention must not disrupt the already tenuous blood Supply of the tarsal navicular because of the associated risks of avascular necrosis and nonunion. The unique morphology and vital role of the navicular as a cornerstone of the talonavicular joint require every effort to maintain the congruity and motion of this joint to avoid later fusion. The likelihood for successful reduction decreases with increasing grades of injury. The naviculo-cuneiform joint, alternatively, requires stability for proper foot function and can be fused, if necessary, to improve fixation or enhance vascularity to the navicular. External fixation, bone grafting (often and early), and limited peritarsal fusion also have evolved into useful aids, under certain circumstances, to facilitate the goals of navicular fracture management. Early postoperative range of motion, prolonged protected weight bearing, and aggressive patient counseling as to the severity and long-term implications of these injuries also are paramount to success. Caution also must be exercised in managing navicular dislocations because of the potential long-term complications of redislocation or painful flatfoot deformity if alignment is not maintained. Navicular fracture care remains a challenge to the orthopedic surgeon; successful surgical intervention continues to hinge upon a careful balance between an operative exposure that is limited enough to avoid further devascularization but extensive enough to permit anatomic reduction and rigid internal fixation."
CD010023,0,2105027,0,Is MR better than arthrography for evaluating the ligaments of the wrist? In vitro study.,"The purpose of this study was to determine the relative merits of MR imaging and three-compartment digital arthrography in the assessment of carpal ligaments in vitro. We performed MR imaging and arthrography in 10 normal wrists of fresh cadavers ranging in age from 48 to 71 years, and compared the appearance of the interosseous ligaments and triangular fibrocartilage complex with findings on anatomic sections of the joints. In six of the specimens, relatively T1-weighted MR images, 800/20 (TR/TE), preceded three-compartment digital arthrography performed with standard contrast material. In the other four specimens, arthrography, using an MR solution of iodinated contrast material mixed with cupric sulfate and gelatin, was performed before MR imaging. This was done to mimic the intraarticular fluid that might be seen in an injured wrist. MR allowed accurate assessment of the triangular fibrocartilage complex and scapholunate ligament in eight of 10 cases. Consistent MR visualization of the lunotriquetral ligament was difficult. Three-compartment digital arthrography allowed accurate assessment of the triangular fibrocartilage complex and scapholunate and lunotriquetral ligaments in all 10 cases. We concluded that MR is useful but inferior to arthrography in the evaluation of interosseous ligaments and the triangular fibrocartilage complex."
CD010023,0,2354388,0,Computed tomography of wrist trauma.,"We devised a rapid and sensitive computed tomography (CT) method to assess the acutely injured wrist, healing carpal fractures and post-traumatic osteonecrosis, when the plain films offer insufficient information. The wrist is positioned in a simple reverse-L-shaped Perspex immobilizer. With the scaphoid as the center of the arc and the long axis of the distal radius as the reference 0 degrees line, sequential coronal scans of the wrist were done in 10 degrees increments in an arc of 40 degrees to give 0 degrees, 10 degrees, 20 degrees, 30 degrees and 40 degrees scans. The 0 degrees and 10 degrees arc scans were best for evaluating the distal radius and ulna and soft tissues, the 10 degrees and 20 degrees scans for the carpal bones other than the scaphoid, and their relation to each other, the 30 degrees and 40 degrees scans, parallel to the long axis of the scaphoid, for fractures of the scaphoid and the hook of the hamate. In addition the 40 degrees scan offered an excellent carpal tunnel view. In 22 patients examined for wrist trauma CT was found to be more accurate than plain films and plain-film tomography in determining the presence of a fracture (4 scaphoid and 1 distal radius), in assessing the degree of osseous union (12) and in evaluating intercarpal fusion (2). In addition CT detected avascular necrosis of the lunate in two patients and erosions of the scaphoid and distal radius attributed to rheumatoid arthritis in one."
CD010023,0,19235672,0,Ultrasonographic study of wrist ligaments: review and new perspectives.,"Imaging strategy for wrist injury usually begins with standard radiographs. When a ligamentous disorder is suspected clinically, the next step is arthrographic computed tomography or arthrographic magnetic resonance imaging. When the diagnosis remains unclear, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the preferred examination. Ultrasonography is usually used to assess structures like tendons and bone surface, but thanks to the performances of high-frequency transducers, it can also enable visualization of the main ligaments of the wrist. Ultrasonography could thus replace MRI because of its lower cost, as recently reported in the literature. However, a good knowledge of normal and pathological wrist anatomy is required to avoid false negatives. Wrist ligaments comprise interosseous and capsular ligaments as well as the triangular fibrocartilaginous complex. All these ligaments may be involved in carpal instability. Clinical examination has a major role to play in helping radiologists orient their procedures. A few studies have reported that ultrasonography of the triangular fibrocartilaginous complex is reliable compared with arthrography or MRI, but most of these studies were limited to the radioulnar ligaments. In this article we propose a more extensive protocol."
CD010023,0,19887294,0,MR imaging of traumatic and overuse injuries of the wrist and hand in athletes.,"Traumatic and overuse injuries of the hand and wrist are common in athletes. Increasingly, MR imaging is being used to complement clinical and radiographic assessment in the diagnosis and management of these injuries. MR imaging is able to image accurately the bones, tendons, ligaments, nerves, and other small structures of the hand and wrist. This article provides an overview of traumatic and overuse injuries of the hand and wrist in athletes and a review of the MR imaging appearances."
CD010023,0,8173057,0,[The monitor findings of digitalized conventional wrist x-rays].,"The study aimed at proving the reliability of monitor systems with the matrix of 1024 x 768 for the detection of scaphoid fractures compared to conventional X-ray. Moreover, we were interested in the significance of procedures of digital imaging post processing, depending in particular on the experience of investigators. 5 investigators with different levels of experience analysed 57 X-rays of the wrist. They compared conventional X-rays with images on a high screen monitor system after the digitalisation of these X-rays by a CCD-scanner and analysed untreated and treated images. A 5-point scale ROC analysis was used for evaluation. The analysis covered a total of 1740 evaluations. The untreated images seen on the monitor system proved slightly better than conventional X-rays. Post-processing has no evident advantage over untreated images. Differing levels of experience had no effect whatsoever on the identification of findings."

A case report.,"In summary, the diagnosis of a tarsal navicular stress fracture should be entertained in the athlete with ill-defined midfoot pain. Technetium bone scans will often point the clinician in the right direction; biplanar CT scans will pin-point the diagnosis and can be invaluable in perioperative planning. Subsequent treatment, however, must be determined on a clinical rather than a radiographic basis."
CD010023,0,3998606,0,Attritional flexor tendon rupture due to a scaphoid non union imitating an anterior interosseous nerve syndrome: a case report.,"A case is presented of acute loss of function of flexor pollicis longus and profundus tendon to the index finger. Although the aetiology was obscure, the acute onset suggested a mechanical cause rather than a nerve compression disorder such as anterior interosseous nerve palsy. X-rays showed an ununited scaphoid fracture related to an injury many years previously. Surgical exploration revealed attritional rupture of flexor pollicis longus and partial division of profundus tendon to index finger by a spicule of ununited scaphoid which had eroded through the volar capsule. Removal of the spicule and tenodesis of flexor pollicis longus gave a good long term result."

CD010023,0,10664998,0,A one-hour walk-in service for wrist trauma imaging.,"We investigated the feasibility of rapid imaging of wrist trauma following casualty presentation and any subsequent effect on image quality and interpretability. All patients referred for wrist imaging were injected with 370 MBq 99Tcm-hydroxymethyl diphosphonate (HDP) and imaged 1, 2 and 3 h later. Palmar images were acquired on a 256 x 256 x 16 matrix using a high-resolution collimator, 140 keV photopeak and a 20% window. The images were scored qualitatively by four qualified observers in three categories: image quality, lesion detection and lesion localization. Statistical analysis indicated a significant improvement in scan quality with time, the mean difference (+/- standard error of the mean) between the 1 and 3 h scans being 0.81 +/- 0.07 (P = 0.001). No significant differences were seen in lesion detection (0.05 +/- 0.08; P = 0.51) or localization (0.14 +/- 0.08; P = 0.10). We conclude that imaging of wrist trauma is possible as early as 1 h post-injection of 99Tcm-HDP, although negative studies at 1 h require a 3 h image to maintain diagnostic accuracy."
CD010023,0,11162008,0,MRI versus arthroscopy in the diagnosis of scapholunate ligament injury.,"In a prospective study 103 patients with clinically or radiologically suspected tears of the scapholunate interosseous ligament were investigated with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and wrist arthroscopy. MRI was performed with the conventional technique in 72 cases and after intravenous injection of contrast medium in the remaining 31 patients. The correct diagnosis was made by MRI in 75% of cases and its overall sensitivity and specificity were 63% and 86% respectively. There was no statistical difference in the accuracy of MRI for acute or chronic tears and the use of intravenous contrast medium did not improve its accuracy. In conclusion, MRI is not recommended for the diagnosis of scapholunate ligament injury."

Radiologically, erosions were noted in the proximal pole of the scaphoid. The patient underwent wrist arthrotomy, exploration and washout with intraoperative bacterial cultures and histology specimens were obtained. Histological analysis revealed the diagnosis of gout. We discuss the clinical presentation and literature review of this topic. This case illustrates that gout may mimic infection."
CD010023,0,9509596,0,Gadolinium-enhanced dynamic MRI of the fractured carpal scaphoid: preliminary results.,"The aim of the present report was to evaluate the vascularity of fracture fragments of the fractured carpal scaphoid in the acute (< 4 weeks) and chronic (> 3 months) phases using a gadolinium-enhanced dynamic MRI sequence. Eight patients with acute scaphoid fractures, six patients with chronic scaphoid fractures, and three control patients without fractures were evaluated using a T1-weighted fast spoiled gradient recalled acquisition (fSPGR) sequence with gadolinium-DTPA enhancement (0.1 mmol/kg bodyweight). Signal intensity over time plots were obtained using region of interest measurements from both fracture fragments. Enhancement factors (EF) were then calculated from the plots. No enhancement of the scaphoid was seen in control subjects (EF: distal scaphoid pole 1.04 +/- 0.01, proximal pole 1.07 +/- 0.08). In acute fracture patients, enhancement of the distal pole was greater than that of the proximal in all cases but one in which the two poles enhanced in a similar fashion (EF: distal 1.99 +/- 0.77, proximal 1.43 +/- 0.99). In chronic fracture patients the enhancement pattern was reversed, as the proximal pole enhanced to a greater degree than the distal with the exception of one case where both poles enhanced equally (EF: distal 1.74 +/- 0.52, proximal 2.64 +/- 0.50). Using a two-tailed non-parametric Mann-Whitney U-test, the difference in enhancement of the proximal poles between the acute and chronic groups was found to be highly significant (P < 0.003). Dynamic contrast-enhanced (fSPGR) MRI demonstrates significant differences in the enhancement patterns of the scaphoid when chronic and acute fractures are compared."

Acute-phase multidetector computed tomography has better temporal, spatial, and contrast resolution than a conventional scanner has.

CD010023,0,15864044,0,Does three-dimensional computer simulation improve results of scaphoid nonunion surgery?,"The purpose of this study was to clarify the effectiveness of the three-dimensional computer simulations in scaphoid nonunion surgery. Seven consecutive clinical patients with scaphoid nonunion at the middle third comprised the study group. Surface models of the scaphoid were constructed on the computer using computed tomography data of the bilateral wrists in neutral position. The distal and proximal fragments of the nonunion model were matched to the mirror image of the contralateral scaphoid model. The rotation of the distal fragment relative to the proximal fragment was calculated, and reduction of the displaced fragment of the scaphoid nonunion was simulated. Similarly, the estimated bone defect and the appropriate site and direction of the screw insertion were simulated. Full-sized hard models of the bone, including a model with simulated reduction and screw insertion, then were made using stereolithography based on the computer data. In the actual surgery, reduction, bone grafting, and screw insertion were achieved using the hard models as guides. All the patients obtained solid bone fusion and substantial clinical improvement with normalized scapholunate and radiolunate angles after surgery. Three-dimensional computer simulations were found as useful for accurate correction of scaphoid nonunions and proper screw placement, which consequently leads to good clinical results."
CD010023,0,21289857,0,Pseudarthrosis after disruption of an incomplete luno-triquetral coalition: a case report.,"Whilst bony luno-triquetral coalitions are known to be asymptomatic, fibro-cartilage unions can cause ulnar-sided wrist pain. The purpose is to present the rare case of painful pseudarthrosis after traumatic disruption of an incomplete luno-triquetral coalition. Recommendations for proper diagnosis and treatment options will be discussed. The case of a 35-year-old male patient is reported, where disruption of a fibro-cartilaginous luno-triquetral coalition resulted in a painful pseudarthrosis. Luno-triquetral fusion with a corticocancellous wedge from the iliac crest and a Herbert screw was undertaken. Using this method pain was relieved but resulted in minor loss of range of motion. We recommend luno-triquetral fusion in the rare case of fracture or pseudarthrosis of a luno-triquetral coalition. The use of a corticocancellous wedge should be considered depending on gap formation after resection of the pseudarthrosis."
CD010023,0,9661853,0,Carpal fractures in children.,"Carpal fractures in children are uncommon injuries, with the scaphoid being fractured most frequently. Thirty-three children with scaphoid fractures and one child each with fractures of triquetrum, trapezoid, hamate, and capitate were retrospectively reviewed. The mean age was 13 years, 4 months. The mechanism of injury was of low energy in most cases, with > 80% of injuries involving a fall. Localizing tenderness was present in 100% of cases. Of fractures, 97.3% were evident on the initial radiographs. One patient required a bone scan to confirm the diagnosis. All but one scaphoid fracture went on to union with conservative treatment in a long-arm thumb spica cast or short-arm thumb spica cast at a mean of 7.1 weeks. All other carpal fractures healed at a mean of 4.5 weeks. The one scaphoid nonunion was attributed to noncompliance by the patient."
CD010023,0,11974963,1,[Occult fractures of the carpal navicular. Detection by quantitative radioscintigraphy. Social and medico-legal repercussions].,"Fractures of the scaphoid of the wrist are not easily diagnosed and when they are eventually recognized due to late complications, the prognosis is much poorer than it would have been at injury. Medical negligence and poorly-performed or interpreted x-rays are frequently cited as reasons for non-diagnosis. Often these fractures are trabecular, so-called occult, and they cannot be seen on a conventional exam, even if well-performed. Tomography and tomodensitometry have yielded poor results. Quantitative radioscintigraphy (QRS), the exam we are proposing, is a modification of scintigraphy, which is a very sensitive exam (100%) but has little specificity. The first step in QRS is to quantify the fixation of the tracer on the injured side and compare it to that of the uninjured side. If the injured side fixation is double that of the uninjured side, a fracture (often scaphoid) is present. MRI is our reference. In the second step in QRS, a computer-assisted fusion is made of the scintigraphic image and the x-ray (quantitative scintigraphy has the same diagnostic value as MRI). The center of the fracture is localized, thus yielding a specificity of nearly 100% for this exam. Out of a prospective series of 154 patients who had a conventional examination: 41% were diagnosed to have a scaphoid fracture using QSR, therefore a number higher than supposed. Rare carpal fractures were also detected. The cost of this exam is low. The exam climinates non-diagnosed fractures which can lead to non-union and arthrosis. Due to the frequency of carpal trauma, this exam should have a significant effect on the individual, on social security costs and litigations."
CD010023,0,1572718,0,Diagnosing scaphoid fractures: radiographs cannot be used as a gold standard!,"To evaluate the reproducibility of the interpretation of radiographs for the diagnosis of scaphoid fractures, 134 radiographs (60 consecutive patients) were blindly observed by a resident radiologist, consultant radiologist, resident trauma surgeon and consultant trauma surgeon. The results of radiographs were analysed using kappa (kappa) statistics and stratified according to the results of the corresponding bone scan. In 23 patients the bone scan was positive for fracture of the scaphoid. Irrespective of training and experience, the kappa of the comparison of the scores of the radiographs between any two observers did not exceed 40 per cent. After stratification of the outcome of the bone scan, the kappa did not increase significantly. A panel of three experienced observers gave their opinion of all radiographs. The results were compared with the bone scan results. We conclude that radiographs in suspected scaphoid fracture cannot be used as a reliable diagnostic approach because of the low inter-observer agreement in the interpretation, irrespective of the experience and training of the observer."

CD010023,0,11036545,0,[Late sequelae of fractures of the distal third of the forearm during the growth period].,"Fractures to the distal third of the forearm are the most common fractures of the upper extremity, with the majority occurring between the age of ten and 14 years. With the exception of the rare epiphyseal fractures, they have a favourable prognosis. The present study investigates the frequency and extent of potential clinical and radiological late sequelae of fractures in the distal third of the forearm during growth. Of the patients treated at the Innsbruck University Department of Traumatology from 1980 to 1992, 220 patients of a growing age with 232 closed fractures in the distal third of the forearm were followed up. The radius alone was affected in 60% of these cases; the radius and the ulna in 40%. Fractures of the ulna alone were not present. The mean age of the patients at the time of injury was nine years (range one to 16 years) and the mean time of follow-up ten years (range five to 16 years). In addition to the patient's subjective assessment, the right and left sides were compared with regard to mobility of the wrist and rotational movement of the forearm. Based on standard X-rays, the frontal (radio-ulnar) and lateral (dorso-palmar) radial joint angle as well as the difference in the radio-ulnar plane were compared with the contralateral side. Clinical and radiological findings were summarised into an overall result. 19% of the patients reported pain in the injured wrist. Mobility of the wrist in the sagittal and/or frontal plane was limited in 5% of patients and rotation of the forearm was limited in 16% of patients. A statistically significant accumulation of limited rotation was seen after physeal fractures of the ulna (""one-way"" ANOVA-test, p = 0.0033). A difference between the left and right side in regard to the frontal radial joint angle was seen in 6% of patients and a difference in the lateral radial joint angle was registered in 2% of patients. A difference in the radio-ulnar plane was observed in 37% of patients. In the presence of relative ulna-plus variance, 75% of patients complained of pain in the ulnocarpal compartment of the wrist. In these patients, dynamic magnetic resonance tomography revealed a compression of the ulnocarpal disk between the proximal carpal bones and the head of the ulna, as well as degeneration in the central portion of the disk. The overall outcome was very good in 72%, good in 19%, moderate in 6% and poor in 3% of patients. The younger the children had been at the time of injury, the more favourable were the results (chi-square test, p = 0.009). Children older than ten years of age with an angulatory deformity of more than 20 degrees and/or fragment dislocation over half of the breadth of the shaft at fracture consolidation showed the poorest results. Further factors having a negative influence on the outcome were repeated reduction manoeuvres and an additional fracture of the ulna."

CD010023,0,2777848,0,Fracture of the hook of the hamate.,"We removed the fracture fragment from fifty-nine patients who had an isolated fracture of the hook of the hamate. Preoperatively, all had complained of pain and tenderness on the ulnar side of the palm or on the dorsal ulnar aspect of the wrist. Most fractures were thought to have occurred while the patient was swinging a racquet, golf club, or baseball bat. Some fractures were caused by striking the palm on a solid object, by falling on the palm, or by a crush injury to the hand. Most of the fractures were diagnosed conclusively on a carpal tunnel roentgenogram or on a special oblique roentgenogram of the wrist supinated. We now believe that computed axial tomography is the best imaging technique for demonstrating this fracture. Except for two patients who had a crush injury, all of the patients returned to their regular occupational and athletic pursuits. There were no surgical complications."

Since measuring bone strength in vivo is not possible, we evaluated which bone assessment method of the forearm would best predict failure load of the distal radius and computed a factor of risk for wrist fracture (Phi wrist). Thirty-eight cadaveric forearm specimens were measured by five different techniques to assess bone density, bone mineral content, geometry and trabecular structure at the distal forearm. The bone assessment techniques included dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) of the radius, peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) of the 4% and 20% distal sites of the radius, DXA of the phalanges, digital X-ray radiogrammetry of the forearm (DXR-BMD), and quantitative ultrasound of the radius. The failure load of each excised radius was determined by simulating a fall on an outstretched hand. The pQCT measurements of polar stress-strain index and cortical content explained the greatest portion of variance in failure load (r2=0.82-0.85). Bone mineral content measures were generally better predictors of failure load (r2=0.53-0.85) than the corresponding volumetric or areal bone mineral density values (r2=0.22-0.69) measured by either pQCT or DXA. Multiple regression analysis showed that the addition of a bone geometry measure improved the ability of a bone density measure alone to predict failure load. There was high variability in the ability of different techniques and different variables within a given technique to predict failure load. Estimates of the factor of risk for wrist fracture (Phi wrist) revealed that the women in this study would have been likely to fracture their distal radius upon falling from a standing height (Phi wrist= 1.04), whereas the men would have likely withstood the impact without fracturing their wrist (Phi wrist= 0.79)."
CD010023,0,2366025,0,Evaluation of ischaemic necrosis of carpal bones by magnetic resonance imaging.,"Nine patients with chronic pain in the wrist were examined by M.R.I. to evaluate its accuracy in the detection of ischaemic necrosis of carpal bones. In seven patients, M.R.I. confirmed scintigraphic and radiographic signs of ischaemic necrosis. In two patients with radionuclide accumulations, M.R.I. did not confirm the diagnosis: in one, M.R.I. was totally normal and in the other it showed signs of a healing scaphoid fracture. From this limited experience, M.R.I. seems to be a sensitive imaging modality which is more specific than scintigraphy."

CD010023,0,9556260,0,Is intrasound vibration useful in the diagnosis of occult scaphoid fractures?,"This study was designed to confirm the results of Finkenberg et al. (J Hand Surg 1993;18A: 4-7), who found a high sensitivity (100%) and specificity (95%) of the intrasound vibration method in diagnosing occult scaphoid fractures. These occult scaphoid fractures are not visible on x-ray films, but clinically the patients are suspected of having a scaphoid fracture. A vibratory apparatus is placed over the anatomical snuff-box and a vibration of 100 mW is emitted; a painful sensation is produced if the scaphoid is fractured. Thirty-seven consecutive patients with a clinically suspected scaphoid fracture were evaluated. In 6 patients, a scaphoid fracture was radiographically identified; in the remaining 31 patients, a 3-phase bone scan was obtained. Eleven wrists showed increased uptake over the scaphoid and were considered to have an occult scaphoid fracture. In this group, bone scintigraphy was used as the reference standard. The vibration test was painful in 1 of 6 patients with a proven scaphoid fracture and in 3 of the 11 patients with a positive bone scan. In contrast to the results of Finkenberg et al, the intrasound vibration method shows a sensitivity of 24%, a specificity of 85%, a positive predictive value of 40%, and a negative predictive value of 65%. We conclude that the accuracy of intrasound vibration is low and that it is not useful in the diagnosis of scaphoid fractures."
CD010023,0,9556261,0,Intrasound vibration in the early diagnosis of scaphoid fracture.,"A prospective trial was designed to assess the sensitivity and specificity of intrasound vibration for the early detection of scaphoid fracture. We replicated the method described by Finkenburg et al. (J Hand Surg 1993;18A:4-7) in an attempt to corroborate their results. We found the test to be 73% sensitive and 51% specific. Because the test was not 100% sensitive, as claimed by Finkenburg et al., we discontinued the use of this device in our hospital."
CD010023,0,11521919,0,Scaphoid blood flow and acute fracture healing. A dynamic MRI study with enhancement with gadolinium.,"We have investigated whether assessment of blood flow to the proximal scaphoid can be used to predict nonunion in acute fractures of the scaphoid. We studied 32 fractures of the scaphoid one to two weeks after injury, by dynamic fat-suppressed T1-weighted gradient-echo MRI after the intravenous administration of gadopentetate dimeglumine (0.1 mmol/kg body-weight). Steepest slope values (SSV) and percentage enhancement values (%E) were calculated for the distal and proximal fragments and poles. All the fractures were treated by immobilisation in a cast, and union was assessed by CT at 12 weeks. Nonunion occurred in four fractures (12%), and there was no statistically significant difference between the proximal fragment SSV and %E values for the fractures which united and those with nonunion. The difference between the proximal pole SSV and %E values for the union and nonunion groups reached statistical significance (p < 0.05), but with higher enhancement parameters for the nonunion group. Our results suggest that poor proximal vascularity is not an important determinant of union in fractures of the scaphoid."
CD010023,0,19790024,0,[Palmar wrist arthroscopy for evaluation of concomitant carpal lesions in operative treatment of distal intraarticular radius fractures].,"Fractures of the distal radius, which currently are treated with palmar locking plates, are often accompanied by carpal lesions. Tears of the scapholunate interosseus ligament (SL) can affect the outcome. Between January 2007 and May 2008, 28 patients with distal intraarticular fractures of the radius were included in a prospective study. Preoperative CT-arthrography was performed. SL tears were found in 11 patients, with 10 partial and one complete rupture observed. A tear of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) was detected in 16 patients. Every patient was operated with a palmar locking plate through a palmar approach between the flexor carpi radialis tendon and the radial artery. Then, a palmar wrist arthroscopy using a palmar portal was performed. Eleven SL tears with 9 partial and two total ruptures were diagnosed by arthroscopy. Ten lesions were associated with a C1-fracture with a fracture line projected onto the scapholunate interval. The TFCC was appraisable by palmar wrist arthroscopy only in 4 patients. Three of the SL tears detected by CT-arthrography could not be confirmed by palmar wrist arthroscopy. One complete rupture and one partial lesion confirmed by palmar wrist arthroscopy were found by CT-arthrography to be intact. Palmar wrist arthroscopy affords certainty when assessing the SL ligament. In this study, an assessment of ulnocarpal structures was not possible. For assessment of the ulnocarpal structures, CT-arthrography was superior to palmar wrist arthroscopy. However, the latter is an alternative during emergency treatment or when CT-arthrography is not available."

CD010023,0,8188775,0,Complications of common carpal injuries.,"Interest in the diagnosis and treatment of common disorders of the carpus has intensified in recent years. Although newer nonoperative and surgical procedures have developed to improve outcome, complications and their treatment remain a challenging problem. To address complications of the more common carpal injuries, we have chosen fractures of the scaphoid, scapholunate ligament injuries, carpal fracture dislocations, and fractures of the hook of the hamate for discussion."
CD010023,0,20299263,0,Arthroscopic treatment of a fresh lunate bone fracture detaching the scapholunate ligament.,"Fractures of the lunate bone are rare and usually treated by prolonged immobilization. We report a fracture of the dorsal pole of the lunate bone detaching the scapholunate ligament. The clinical presentation was equivalent to an acute disruption of this ligament. Percutaneous screw repair of the bone fragment was performed under wrist arthroscopy. The patient kept an analgesic splint for five days and early mobilization was provided. After 6 weeks, the patient had returned to his previous level of activity with normal wrist motion and full strength. Screw fixation under arthroscopy is minimally invasive and provides accurate restoration of the lunar anatomy, yielding good functional results after a short recovery period. This treatment offers a satisfactory alternative to prolonged immobilization and ensures good reduction and compression of the fracture. We present a detailed description of the surgical technique and its results."

Smoking of tobacco, a common habit which is decreasing in prevalence in the developed world, has been proven to exert many adverse effects on tissue healing including bone union. We present a case of non-union of an undisplaced radial styloid fracture in the dominant hand of a young and healthy heavy smoker, emphasising the negative impact of tobacco smoke and its association with bone repair. We suggest that heavy tobacco users should also be followed up more vigilantly with this complication in mind, with smoking cessation modalities being offered on presentation."

CD010023,0,12111052,0,Traumatic injuries: imaging of peripheral musculoskeletal injuries.,"The current dominant role of conventional radiography must be reassessed at increasingly shorter intervals in view of the continuing emergence of new imaging modalities that are available to diagnose peripheral musculoskeletal injuries. In comparison with conventional radiography, digital radiographic techniques offer advantages for optimization of image quality and dose, such as a wider dynamic range and post-processing of images. Currently, digital luminescence radiography (storage phosphor radiography) is the most commonly used digital method for obtaining radiographs, using the established positioning projections and routines of the film-screen technique. A new process, radiography with flat-panel amorphous silicon detectors, is still under development. Computed tomography is a valuable tool for diagnosing injuries of the peripheral musculoskeletal system, especially when three-dimensional data sets are acquired; these allow reformating images in all planes desired (2D technique) or in a volumetric format (3D technique). Established indications for CT in the peripheral skeleton are hip fractures, wrist injuries and calcaneal fractures; however, CT may be used as a supplement to radiography in every region of the body. Sonography is beginning to play an increasingly important role in trauma. Muscle and tendon injuries are the most common indications, but worthwhile information can be gained of the shoulder, elbow, hip, and knee joints, supplementing conventional or digital radiography. Magnetic resonance imaging effectively visualizes traumatic changes of the skeleton and the peripheral soft tissues. It is the method of choice to detect occult fractures. It can be used to diagnose muscle and tendon injuries. Joint injuries, especially in the knee and the shoulder joint, are common indications for MRI in the posttraumatic setting."
CD010023,0,9314391,0,Displaced intra-articular fractures of the distal aspect of the radius. Long-term results in young adults after open reduction and internal fixation.,"The purpose of this retrospective study was to determine the long-term functional and radiographic outcomes in a series of young adults (less than forty-five years old) in whom an acute displaced intra-articular fracture of the distal aspect of the radius had been treated with operative reduction and stabilization. Twenty-six fractures in twenty-six patients met the initial inclusion criteria for the study. Twenty-one patients returned for a physical examination, imaging (plain radiographs and computerized tomography scans), and completion of a validated musculoskeletal function assessment questionnaire at a minimum of 5.5 years. The physical examinations were performed by the same observer, who was not involved in the initial care of the patients. The plain radiographs and computerized tomography scans were assessed in a blinded fashion by two independent observers who measured the radiographic parameters with standardized methods. At an average of 7.1 years, osteoarthrosis of the radiocarpal joint was evident on the plain radiographs and computerized tomography scans of sixteen (76 per cent) of the twenty-one wrists. A strong association was found between the development of osteoarthrosis of the radiocarpal joint and residual displacement of articular fragments at the time of osseous union (p < 0.01). However, the functional status at the time of the most recent follow-up, as determined by physical examination and on the basis of the responses on the questionnaire, did not correlate with the magnitude of the residual step and gap displacement at the time of fracture-healing. All patients had a good or excellent functional outcome irrespective of radiographic evidence of osteoarthrosis of the radiocarpal or the distal radio-ulnar joint or non-union of the ulnar styloid process. It appears prudent therefore to base the indications for salvage operative procedures on the presence of severe symptoms or a loss of function rather than on radiographic evidence of osteoarthrosis of the radiocarpal joint."

Six cases with associated anterior dislocation of the ulnar head].,"A particular course of markedly displaced wrist fracture associated with complete dislocation of the distal radio-ulnar joint and a real anterior dislocation of the ulnar head is related. In 5 other identical cases, treatment with external fixation achieved a more favourable result. These 6 cases concerning a particular type of wrist fracture, and a review of the literature, led us to suggest a potential pattern of TFCC lesions. Finally, from an anatomical classification of the ulnar compartment, we propose some therapeutic guidelines concerning the ulnar side for more common fractures."
CD010023,0,18087747,0,Diagnostic accuracy of plain radiographs and cineradiography in diagnosing traumatic scapholunate dissociation.,"Missed tears of the scapholunate ligament (SLL) and scapholunate dissociation (SLD) after wrist injuries pose a high risk of post-traumatic osteoarthritis of the carpus. Plain X-rays and dynamic radiographic studies are frequently used for initial diagnostic work-up. Given the limited evidence of their accuracy, we retrospectively compared the radiographic findings of patients with suspected traumatic SLD with wrist arthroscopy as the accepted reference standard."
CD010023,0,9607660,0,Proximal scaphoid costo-osteochondral replacement arthroplasty.,"Deficiency of the proximal pole of the scaphoid due to fracture or necrosis was treated by costo-osteochondral replacement arthroplasty using rib bone/cartilage autografts in 22 patients who were followed prospectively and assessed at a median 24 month follow-up (range, 12-72 months). Improvement of wrist function occurred in all patients with increased motion, improved grip strength and less pain. The average modified Green and O'Brien Wrist Function Score improved from 53 out of 100 preoperatively to 80 at the most recent review. All patients were graded fair or poor at initial review and all but three improved to good or excellent at the most recent assessment. Despite the absence of the scapholunate ligament, carpal alignment did not deteriorate in any patient and there were no graft non-unions or significant complications. In the short and medium term a costo-osteochondral autograft can satisfactorily restore mechanical integrity of the scaphoid proximal pole and maintain wrist motion while avoiding the potential complications of alternative replacement arthroplasty techniques."

CD010023,0,12074611,0,Management of acute fractures and nonunions of the proximal pole of the scaphoid.,"It is my belief that all acute proximal pole fractures should be treated by open reduction and internal fixation, via a dorsal approach. There is no longer any place for conservative treatment of these fractures, because a lengthy period of plaster immobilization is required and there is an unacceptably high risk of nonunion with conservative management. Unfortunately, nonunion of the proximal pole remains a common and disabling problem which demands careful evaluation and treatment. Internal fixation combined with limited cancellous bone grafting produces very satisfactory results in terms of pain relief and function, and clinical results are as good as those reported for more complex procedures involving vascularized grafts and prolonged cast immobilization. While the place for vascularized grafting has yet to be clearly defined, at present it is a technique which should be reserved for cases with long-standing ischaemia or failed previous surgery."
CD010023,0,21548951,0,"Pulsed Electromagnetic Fields in the treatment of fresh scaphoid fractures. A multicenter, prospective, double blind, placebo controlled, randomized trial.","The scaphoid bone is the most commonly fractured of the carpal bones. In the Netherlands 90% of all carpal fractures is a fracture of the scaphoid bone. The scaphoid has an essential role in functionality of the wrist, acting as a pivot. Complications in healing can result in poor functional outcome. The scaphoid fracture is a troublesome fracture and failure of treatment can result in avascular necrosis (up to 40%), non-union (5-21%) and early osteo-arthritis (up to 32%) which may seriously impair wrist function. Impaired consolidation of scaphoid fractures results in longer immobilization and more days lost at work with significant psychosocial and financial consequences.Initially Pulsed Electromagnetic Fields was used in the treatment of tibial pseudoarthrosis and non-union. More recently there is evidence that physical forces can also be used in the treatment of fresh fractures, showing accelerated healing by 30% and 71% reduction in nonunion within 12 weeks after initiation of therapy. Until now no double blind randomized, placebo controlled trial has been conducted to investigate the effect of this treatment on the healing of fresh fractures of the scaphoid."

A 14-year-old boy presented with spontaneous onset swelling and pain wrist for 2 months. Initially he was suspected of having tuberculosis, but radiographs revealed a sclerotic lesion of the scaphoid and the sedimentation rate was not high. CT scan of the wrist showed a double-ring sign, indicating osteoid osteoma. Lesion was curetted and the nidus excised. This resulted in rapid resolution of the symptoms."

CD010023,0,1400550,0,Long-term results after Russe bone-grafting: the effect of malunion of the scaphoid.,"Twenty-five patients had Russe anterior corticocancellous bone-grafting between 1973 and 1984 for twenty-six symptomatic established non-unions of the scaphoid. The mean duration of follow-up was eleven years (range, seven to eighteen years). Twenty-one (81 per cent) of the twenty-six scaphoid bones united. We developed two rating scales to evaluate the results of the operation. One scale, based on objective findings, included the radiographic appearance of the wrist, the range of motion, and strength; the other scale, based on subjective findings, comprised function, pain, perception of a decrease in performance because of limitation of motion or strength, and satisfaction. These scales were used to compare the objective and subjective results in patients who had a malunion of the scaphoid in which the lateral intrascaphoid angle was more than 45 degrees convex dorsally between the proximal and distal poles (a so-called flexion or humpback deformity, which results in extension of the proximal fragment of the scaphoid at the radiocarpal joint) with the results in patients who had no such deformity. The lateral intrascaphoid angle was more than 45 degrees in thirteen (50 per cent) of the twenty-six wrists. Although the difference in the objective results between the wrists that had a malunion and those that did not have a malunion was highly significant (p = 0.001), there was no significant difference in the subjective results between the two groups, including satisfaction of the patient (p = 0.39). Twenty-three patients (92 per cent) returned to full-time employment and twenty-two (88 per cent), to sports activities. Twenty-three patients (92 per cent) reported that they had pronounced relief of pain and that the procedure had improved their quality of life. The presence of this deformity of the scaphoid after bone-grafting for a symptomatic non-union was not predictive of a poor long-term subjective outcome."
CD010023,0,12782882,0,The effect of pronation and supination on the minimally displaced scaphoid fracture.,"The amount of rotation that occurs at the scaphoid waist fracture site with pronation and supination of the forearm is studied in 10 upper extremities from cadavers. Two colinear metal markers were placed in the osteotomized scaphoid and a below-the-elbow cast was applied. Spiral volumetric computed tomography scanning of the scaphoid was done with multiplanar reformation to evaluate displacement of the metal markers. Four of the 10 specimens also were studied without any immobilization. The total magnitude of motion from pronation to supination averaged 0.2 mm in the specimens with a below-the-elbow thumb spica cast, and 2.4 mm in specimens without immobilization. The current study showed no significant rotation at the minimally displaced scaphoid waist fracture site during pronation and supination in a below-the-elbow cast. Furthermore, there is unacceptable rotation at the fracture site in the absence of a cast. Based on this study, a below-the-elbow thumb spica cast seems adequate for fracture immobilization; however, clinical correlation is needed."
CD010023,0,9665518,0,Combining the clinical signs improves diagnosis of scaphoid fractures. A prospective study with follow-up.,"This is a prospective study evaluating the efficacy of four clinical signs believed to be useful in the diagnosis of scaphoid fracture. Two hundred and fifteen consecutive patients with suspected scaphoid fracture were examined on two separate occasions to evaluate tenderness in the anatomical snuff box (ASB), tenderness over the scaphoid tubercle (ST), pain on longitudinal compression of the thumb (LC) and the range of thumb movement (TM). At the initial examination ASB, ST and LC were all 100% sensitive for detecting scaphoid fracture with specificities of 9%, 30% and 48% respectively. These clinical signs used in combination, within the first 24 hours following injury, produced 100% sensitivity and an improvement in the specificity to 74%. TM had 69% sensitivity and 66% specificity. Our results suggest that these clinical signs are inadequate indicators of scaphoid fracture when used alone and should be combined to achieve a more accurate clinical diagnosis."

We describe the imaging findings on three sets of radiographs, bone scintigraphy, CT and MRI. CT failed to identify a scaphoid fracture, which was present on 6 week radiographs, MRI and scintigraphy. The case illustrates that despite multidetector technology, CT still relies upon cortical and or trabecular displacement to demonstrate fractures."

CD010023,0,532594,0,Scanning and radiology of the carpal scaphoid bone.,"The value of isotope scanning in patients with suspected fracture of the scaphoid bone of the wrist was examined. For this purpose comparable examinations were made of 50 patients using both radiography and isotope scanning. With a normal scan, the suspicion of fracture or other bone diseases can be excluded. Increased focal activity corresponding to the region of the scaphoid bone indicates the possibility of a fracture, even if a fracture cannot be seen in the initial X-rays."
CD010023,0,1868390,0,The natural history of suspected scaphoid fractures.,"Clinically suspected scaphoid fractures are common injuries. The authors prospectively followed up, by serial radiography and bone scanning, 23 patients who had a history of trauma to the carpus and associated localized tenderness to the anatomic ""snuff box"": in 15 patients the radiographs and bone scans were negative; in 5 the radiograph was equivocal and the bone scan positive. The authors concluded that patients with clinically suspected scaphoid fractures and negative radiographs can be treated symptomatically without immobilization in a cast. Patients with equivocal radiographs should be assumed to have a fractured scaphoid and treated accordingly."

A chest radiograph revealed a metallic foreign body over the cardiac silhouette; a chest CT scan localized the object to within the wall of the right ventricle. The patient subsequently developed pericardial tamponade necessitating pericardiocentesis. A 25-mm-long Kirschner wire protruding through the wall of the right ventricle was removed via thoracotomy. Forty-two months previously, the patient had undergone open reduction and fixation of a left radius fracture with two Kirschner wires. Clinicians caring for patients with orthopedic wires in place should be aware of wire migration with cardiac embolization as a potential complication."
CD010023,0,2712988,0,Scaphoid tubercle tenderness: a better indicator of scaphoid fractures?,"Tenderness in the anatomical snuff box (ASB) has long been accepted as an indicator of a possible scaphoid fracture. The longitudinal axis of the scaphoid lies in an anteroposterior plane, perpendicular to the remainder of the carpal bones, in the radially deviated wrist. The scaphoid tubercle can therefore be easily and accurately palpated on the palmar aspect of the radially deviated wrist. This study was devised to determine if tenderness over the scaphoid tubercle (ST) was superior to ASB tenderness in identifying definite fractures. Over a 10-month period 246 patients were seen who were suspected of having a scaphoid injury. Thirty (12%) were eventually proven to have definite fracture. Tenderness in the ASB had a sensitivity rate of 90% (95% confidence limits 80-100%) and specificity of 40% (33-47%) as an indicator of a definite fracture. ST tenderness had a sensitivity of 87% (75-99%) and specificity of 57% (50-64%). There is therefore no significant difference in the sensitivity between ASB and ST tenderness but ST tenderness is significantly more specific. However, the presence of either ASB or ST tenderness should be used in order to identify all fractures. Patients with neither ASB nor ST tenderness require symptomatic treatment only."
CD010023,0,8451048,0,[The painful ulno-carpal joint. Diagnosis and therapy].,"The ulnocarpal joint plays a critical role in hand and wrist function. It serves as part of forearm rotation as well as part of the carpal kinematics. The joint is comprised of the distal radio-ulnar articulation, triangular fibrocartilage complex, lunate, triquetrum, hamate, and pisiform, and the intra and extracapsular ligamentous and soft tissue constraints. Traumatic disruptions as well as chronic inflammatory conditions are commonplace. In addition to standard radiographs, arthrography, CT scanning, and MRI studies prove useful. Wrist arthroscopy is becoming of increasing importance in this region of the wrist. Ulnar impaction syndrome may occur associated with malunion of distal radius fracture, ulna positive variance, or chronic TFCC tears. Osteotomy of the distal radius or ulnar shortening osteotomy should be considered. Instability of the distal ulna can be treated with tenodesis procedures, hemi-resection arthroplasty, matched ulna resection or the Sauvé-Kapandji procedure."

The fracture was reduced and internally fixed using a standard technique applicable to the fixation of fractures of the radial head. Full movement was restored. An isolated injury to the distal ulna is rare and requires careful clinical and radiological assessment."
CD010023,0,11305572,0,The role of MRI in the assessment of scaphoid fracture healing: a pilot study.,"Twenty-two patients with fracture of the scaphoid treated by cast immobilisation underwent clinical examination, radiography and MR scanning 6 weeks after injury. On clinical and plain radiographic criteria alone, 12 patients were considered sufficiently healed to warrant mobilisation. The remaining 10 patients were considered unhealed and were immobilised for a further period. A musculoskeletal radiologist, blinded to the clinical diagnosis, reviewed the MRI scans. Of the 10 patients considered unhealed, 5 had the MR appearances of a united fracture, based on normal marrow signal across the fracture line on T1-weighted images. Of the 12 patients deemed to have united, union could be confirmed by MRI criteria in only 5, but all 12 were healed at 1 year. The results suggest that MRI can provide additional information in this group of patients. It can confirm bony union in a high proportion of patients deemed clinically non-united. Its use in this context will allow a more rapid mobilisation and return to normal function. The significance of persistent MR signal abnormalities in patients who have clinical and radiographic signs of healing merits further study."
CD010023,0,10955218,0,Acute injuries of the distal radioulnar joint.,"Distal radioulnar joint injuries can occur in isolation or in association with distal radius fractures, Galeazzi fractures, Essex-Lopresti injuries, and both-bone forearm fractures. The authors have classified DRUJ/TFCC injuries into stable, partially unstable (subluxation), and unstable (dislocation) patterns based on the injured structures and clinical findings. Clinical findings and plain radiographs are usually sufficient to diagnose the lesion, but axial CT scans are pathognomonic. Diagnostic arthroscopy is the next test of choice to visualize stable and partially unstable lesions. Stable injuries of the DRUJ/TFCC unresponsive to conservative measures require arthroscopic debridement of the TFCC tear, along with ulnar shortening if there is ulnar-positive variance. Partially unstable injuries, on the other hand, are treated with direct arthroscopic or open repair of the TFCC tear, once again, along with ulnar shortening if ulnar-positive variance is present. Unstable injuries include simple and complex DRUJ dislocations. A simple DRUJ dislocation is easily reducible but may be stable or unstable. In complex dislocation, reduction is not possible because there is soft tissue interposition or a significant tear. After the associated injury is dealt with, treatment for complex injuries requires exploration of the DRUJ, extraction of the interposed tissue, repair of the soft tissues, and open reduction and internal fixation of the ulnar styloid fracture (if present and displaced). The early recognition and appropriate treatment of an acute DRUJ injury are critical to avoid progression to a chronic DRUJ disorder, the treatment of which is much more difficult and much less satisfying."
CD010023,0,10804418,0,[Interscapholunate carpal axial dislocation: a case report].,"We present a case of a patient presenting a right wrist injury due to a motor vehicule accident. X-rays and CT Scan showed transcapholunate axial dislocation with the capitate impacted between the scaphoid and the lunate without perilunate dislocation. This injury was associated to a fracture of radial styloid process, trapezium, triquetrum, hamate, and a pisotriquetral and intermetacarpal dissociation. We did not find any similar case in French or English litterature. Treatment associated closed reduction and percutaneous pinning. At one year follow-up the wrist was painless with a normal range of motion. This lesion contributes to the understanding of carpal injuries mechanism. Capitate ascension within the scapholunar joint due to an important compression force is a pathogenic factor of scapholunate dissociation."

We have developed a new technique of positioning patients while performing longitudinal computed tomography of the scaphoid. With the wrist positioned in radial deviation and neutral flexion, greater patient comfort is provided and immobilization of the wrist is not required. A reproducible image can be obtained with attention to the alignment of the scanning plane to the longitudinal axis of the scaphoid on the scout image, and verified with the ""target sign"". High resolution images, which clearly demonstrate the abnormalities of the scaphoid, can be produced even if the patient has a cast on the wrist or if there is hardware in situ."

The authors feel that all efforts should be made to obtain a reduction of the old dislocation. They support a combined dorsal and palmar approach, open reduction, and internal fixation of scaphoid with a Herbert screw to obtain midcarpal stability. A carpal tunnel decompression should be performed if symptoms suggest median nerve entrapment. When the dislocation is unable to be reduced, the authors favor limited wrist arthrodesis or a proximal row carpectomy in the absence of significant arthritis."

CD010023,0,8077822,0,Traction radiographs in the diagnosis of chronic wrist pain.,"A sensitive non-invasive diagnostic test for intrinsic ligament rupture in patients with chronic wrist pain has still to be found. Differential displacement of the scaphoid, lunate and triquetrum can in some instances be seen during arthroscopy of acute wrist injuries and also on overdistraction of distal radial fractures with an external fixator. We performed a prospective study on 20 patients with chronic wrist pain using 2 kg and 5 kg traction radiographs without and with the addition of an ischaemic block, to assess differential displacement as a diagnostic criterion for intrinsic ligament rupture. Arthroscopy was used as arbiter of diagnosis. The sensitivity ranged from 14% to 57% and the specificity ranged from 53.7% to 100% according to the amount of traction and ischaemic block. In view of these poor results we conclude the stretch test has no additional value in the preoperative assessment of chronic wrist pain."
CD010023,0,9456991,0,Commonly missed orthopedic problems.,"When not diagnosed early and managed appropriately, common musculoskeletal injuries may result in long-term disabling conditions. Anterior cruciate ligament tears are some of the most common knee ligament injuries. Slipped capital femoral epiphysis may present with little or no hip pain, and subtle or absent physical and radiographic findings. Femoral neck stress fractures, if left untreated, may result in avascular necrosis, refractures and pseudoarthrosis. A delay in diagnosis of scaphoid fractures may cause early wrist arthrosis if nonunion results. Ulnar collateral ligament tears are a frequently overlooked injury in skiers. The diagnosis of Achilles tendon rupture is missed as often as 25 percent of the time. Posterior tibial tendon tears may result in fixed bony planus if diagnosis is delayed, necessitating hindfoot fusion rather than simple soft tissue repair. Family physicians should be familiar with the initial assessment of these conditions and, when appropriate, refer patients promptly to an orthopedic surgeon."
CD010023,0,15290486,0,Wrist injuries; diagnosis with multidetector CT.,"The aim of the study was to assess acute-phase multidetector CT (MDCT) findings in wrist injuries. We retrieved all emergency room MDCT requests processed in the period from August 2000 to May 2003. All patients with a wrist injury who underwent MDCT initially were included. Imaging studies were evaluated in relation to injury mechanism, fracture location, and fracture type. A total of 6422 MDCT examinations were performed during this 34-month period, and 38 patients (24 male, 14 female, age range 21-73 years, mean age 40 years) met the inclusion criteria. MDCT revealed 56 fractures and 7 dislocations in 29 patients. In 9 patients (24%) MDCT findings were normal. Eleven patients (29%) underwent surgical procedures. The main injury mechanism was a fall (58%). In 33 cases the primary radiograph was available. Compared to primary radiographs, MDCT revealed 9 occult fractures, mainly in small carpal bones. In 14 cases a suspected fracture (of the scaphoid in 7 cases) was ruled out by MDCT. Due to high-quality two-dimensional reformatting, MDCT examinations were not dependent on the wrist's position in the CT gantry. In the comparison with radiography, MDCT detected occult fractures and ruled out suspected fractures, both mainly in the small carpal bones. High-quality two-dimensional reformats gave significant information about the fracture anatomy. MDCT provides fast and valuable information in assessing complex wrist fractures or when the primary radiograph is equivocal."

CD010023,0,1757005,0,[Diagnosis of torsion malposition of the radius and ulna after healed distal fracture].,Assessing radial and ulnar rotational deformities quantitatively by routine diagnosis after healed distal forearm fractures is very difficult. A method to obtain information about direction and graduation of malrotation is described. This method is based on discovering topographic changes of skeletal points by CT. Rotational angles of intact forearm bones are measured on anatomic specimen and in vivo using epiphyseal and diaphyseal axes of the radius and the ulna. Normal rotation of intact forearm bones varies in a specific manner. The radius presents less variations than the ulna. A morphological index of radial and ulnar rotation is not given because of the great individuality of diaphyseal rotation. Both radii of a single individuum show a very small rotational difference. Therefore a verification of malrotation is indicated by comparison to the intact opposite radius. Higher rotational graduations on the left side have to be noted.
CD010023,0,21733185,0,Fracture surgery of the extremities with the intra-operative use of 3D-RX: a randomized multicenter trial (EF3X-trial).,"Posttraumatic osteoarthritis can develop after an intra-articular extremity fracture, leading to pain and loss of function. According to international guidelines, anatomical reduction and fixation are the basis for an optimal functional result. In order to achieve this during fracture surgery, an optimal view on the position of the bone fragments and fixation material is a necessity. The currently used 2D-fluoroscopy does not provide sufficient insight, in particular in cases with complex anatomy or subtle injury, and even an 18-26% suboptimal fracture reduction is reported for the ankle and foot. More intra-operative information is therefore needed.Recently the 3D-RX-system was developed, which provides conventional 2D-fluoroscopic images as well as a 3D-reconstruction of bony structures. This modality provides more information, which consequently leads to extra corrections in 18-30% of the fracture operations. However, the effect of the extra corrections on the quality of the anatomical fracture reduction and fixation as well as on patient relevant outcomes has never been investigated.The objective of this study protocol is to investigate the effectiveness of the intra-operative use of the 3D-RX-system as compared to the conventional 2D-fluoroscopy in patients with traumatic intra-articular fractures of the wrist, ankle and calcaneus. The effectiveness will be assessed in two different areas: 1) the quality of fracture reduction and fixation, based on the current golden standard, Computed Tomography. 2) The patient-relevant outcomes like functional outcome range of motion and pain. In addition, the diagnostic accuracy of the 3D-RX-scan will be determined in a clinical setting and a cost-effectiveness as well as a cost-utility analysis will be performed."
CD010023,0,22058291,0,Displaced fracture of the waist of the scaphoid.,"A displaced fracture of the scaphoid is one in which the fragments have moved from their anatomical position or there is movement between them when stressed by physiological loads. Displacement is seen in about 20% of fractures of the waist of the scaphoid, as shown by translation, a gap, angulation or rotation. A CT scan in the true longitudinal axis of the scaphoid demonstrates the shape of the bone and displacement of the fracture more accurately than do plain radiographs. Displaced fractures can be treated in a plaster cast, accepting the risk of malunion and nonunion. Surgically the displacement can be reduced, checked radiologically, arthroscopically or visually, and stabilised with headless screws or wires. However, rates of union and deformity are unknown. Mild malunion is well tolerated, but the long-term outcome of a displaced fracture that healed in malalignment has not been established. This paper summarises aspects of the assessment, treatment and outcome of displaced fractures of the waist of the scaphoid."

As in scaphoid fractures, repeated radiographs, tomography, or bone scanning are necessary for the diagnosis. Reviewing the literature, we found that most capitate fractures reported were transverse or combined with other carpal injuries, including the scapho-capitate fracture syndrome. Our patient presented an isolated oblique intraarticular fracture of the capitate. An old fracture of the styloid process of the ulna was seen at the primary examination. This special type of capitate fracture has not been previously described. The fracture was missed on standard radiographs, but discovered by computed tomography (CT). The different types of fractures of the capitate and their treatment are discussed."
CD010023,0,17945644,0,A robust technique for 2D-3D registration.,"A robust 2D-3D registration method with a wide capture range is presented. The method registers pre-operatively collected 3D computed tomography (CT) data sets of a single bone fragment to its intra-operative fluoroscope images. The registration technique relies on hardware rendering of CT data on consumer-grade graphics cards to generate digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) in real time. We also employ unscented Kalman filter to solve for the non-linear dynamics governing this 2D-3D registration problem. The method is validated on phantom models of three different anatomies, namely scaphoid, pelvis and femur. We show that, under the same testing conditions, our proposed technique outperforms the conventional simplex-based method in capture range and robustness while providing comparable accuracy and computation time."

We used peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) to quantify bone and muscle response to immobilization. We measured side-side differences in women aged > or =50 yr who had previously sustained a wrist fracture (4.0+/-3.5 mean yr since fracture). We used pQCT and DXA to measure bone in 31 women (mean age 72.4+/-9.7 yr) at the 4% and 30% sites of bilateral radii; measured grip strength and functional outcome. Initially, we compared the fractured side to intact side and did not control for hand dominance. We observed greater total area (ToA) at the distal (4%) radius on the fractured side without a significant increase in density. At the midshaft (30% site), we observed significantly less ToA and cortical bone on the fracture side. Grip strength was also significantly less on the fractured side (p<0.01). We assessed dominant side fractures and nondominant fractures separately. We observed a greater discrepancy between limbs with a nondominant side fracture, even after accounting for dominance. This cross-sectional study suggests that the bone response to a nondominant fracture may differ from a dominant fracture."

Degenerative changes were observed in 18 wrists with plain radiography and 27 wrists with 3-DCT. 3-DCT imaging more readily revealed osteophyte formation in osteoarthritis than plain radiography. 3-DCT images showed degenerative changes in the distal fragment of the scaphoid earlier than plain radiography. We found three stages of osteophyte formation in the radioscaphoid joint using 3-DCT. In the first stage, a linear osteophyte formed along the most radial portion of the distal fragment of the scaphoid. In the second stage, the radial styloid became pointed. In the third stage, the osteophyte on the distal fragment enlarged and lay over the dorsum of the radioscaphoid joint and other intercarpal joints."

CD010023,0,1288402,0,[Scaphoid bone].,"The scaphoid is the most important carpal bone due to the frequency of its pathological involvement. Two points of radiological anatomy are stressed: the presence of the scaphoid tubercle whose projection gives rise to the scaphoid ring, the solid radio-capitatum ligament which bridges the scaphoid. Scaphoid fracture represents 70% of all carpal bone fractures and its presence must therefore be meticulously investigated on appropriate x-rays or on tomographies or CT scans, rather than by the classical repeat examination a fortnight later. CT provides good analysis of scaphoid fragments when consolidation is delayed (pseudarthrosis), allowing earlier and more justified indications for surgery. The wrist ligaments are poorly visualised by MRI at the present time; but it allows study of the cartilage and, most importantly, is a decisive examination when there is a doubt about bone vitality."

CD010023,0,1288404,0,[Distal radio-ulnar joint. Traumatic and degenerative diseases].,"The distal radio-ulnar joint participates in the biomechanics of the wrist both by transmission of carpal stresses and by its role in the mobility of the wrist. Fractures of the distal radio-ulnar joint are often missed as they are frequently only a radiation of fractures of the radius to the distal radio-ulnar joint. Computed tomography is the most useful examination to assess the severity of these lesions. Distal radio-ulnar dislocations may also be associated with fractures of the radius, but usually occur in isolation. The diagnosis is difficult, as the slightest rotation on plain X-rays interferes with the evaluation criteria. A CT scan in the neutral position and in pronation and supination is the examination of choice for dislocations and subluxations, but must be interpreted according to strict criteria. In contrast, a tea of the triangular ligament can only be assessed on arthrography and the distinction between traumatic and degenerative rupture is difficult. The patient's age, the site of the perforation and the length of the ulna are important elements in the diagnostic decision. MRI appears to be a promising examination for investigation of this joint, but the quality of the images is not yet perfectly reproducible."
CD010023,0,8950387,0,Traumatic type B aortic dissection.,"A 37-year-old man was referred with thoracic pain after a deceleration trauma. He also had a cerebral contusion and a wrist fracture. There were no sings of hypovolemic shock. Computerized tomography (CT) of the chest and transoesophageal echocardiography (TEE) demonstrated a type B aortic dissection originating just distal to the left subclavian artery. There was a patent false lumen without rupture or distal ischaemia. Conservative treatment was given. A paralytic ileus developed and abdominal complaints persisted for several months. Angiography showed normal patency of mesenteric vessels. On follow-up, 3 years after the accident a slight aortic dilation was found on CT thorax without development of a post-dissection aneurysm. Blunt thoracic injury to the aorta usually gives rise to aortic rupture in the region of the isthmus, which can be complete or partial. In the latter case a false aneurysm may develop. An intimal tear after blunt trauma leading to type B aortic dissection rarely occurs. General principles regarding treatment of type B dissection also apply to this particular condition."

A normal bone scan excludes scaphoid fracture, and a positive bone scan sufficiently confirms the presence of clinically relevant scaphoid fracture. Furthermore, this review assesses the possibility on non-invasive additional radiographs, for the diagnosis or exclusion on scaphoid fracture as a means of avoiding bone scintigraphy in patients with negative first-day X-series."
CD010023,0,2423943,0,[Pseudarthrosis of the scaphoid].,"For the treatment of scaphoid non-unions, innumerable curative and palliative operations have been recommended. Of the curative operations, the various methods of bone grafting give the best results, whereas screw fixation is not satisfactory. Bone pegs with a cortical graft are no longer used because of technical difficulties. Corticocancellous grafts (Matti-Russe) yield bony union in almost 90% of cases. The combination of corticocancellous grafts with plate stabilization gives the highest rate of bony union (99%). A cure should therefore always be attempted in all non-union cases, with the exception of cases already involving severe, generalized osteoarthritis or extensive necrosis of the scaphoid. Of the different palliative methods, the early results of prosthetic partial or total replacement of the scaphoid are satisfactory. Late results are less satisfactory, with a high rate of complications and carpal collapse. With severe osteoarthrosis, proximal carpectomy, especially the transscaphoideo-lunate resection, gives good results. Intercarpal arthrodeses have been disappointing. Radiocarpal arthrodesis results in a pain-free, strong wrist; however, there is complete loss of motion, whereas denervation gives satisfactory results in 57% and preserved mobility of the wrist."

The participants answered the Patient-Rated Wrist Evaluation (PRWE), Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand Outcome Questionnaire (DASH), Tampa Scale of Kinesophobia (TSK), Catastrophizing Subscale (CAT) of the Coping Strategies Questionnaire (CSQ), and Self-Efficacy Scale (SES) twice. Test-retest reliability was satisfactory for all instruments. The internal consistency examined with Cronbach's alpha was between 0.68 and 0.97. Because acceptable to good test-retest reliability and internal consistency were demonstrated for the PRWE, DASH, TSK, CAT of the CSQ, and SES, they can be used to detect and monitor fear of movement/(re)injury, catastrophic cognitions, and self-efficacy in patients with radius fracture in the acute and subacute phase. Generally low to moderate correlations were found between behavioural and region-specific measures, indicating that there are two distinct concepts that are not interchangeable."
CD010023,0,18762479,0,Observer variation in MRI for suspected scaphoid fractures.,"The aim of this study was to evaluate prospectively the observer variation in the detection of pathology on MRI for suspected acute scaphoid fracture. 79 consecutive MR scans were included to calculate the inter-observer variation. All patients were suspected of having a scaphoid fracture but had no fracture on radiographs. 38 randomly chosen MR scans were used to calculate the intra-observer variation. Four observers, with varying levels of expertise, blinded scored three items: (i) scaphoid fracture, (ii) localization of a scaphoid fracture, and (iii) another fracture. The observer variation was analysed using the kappa statistic. The inter-observer variation for a scaphoid fracture showed substantial agreement. For the localization of a scaphoid fracture and another fracture, there was a moderate and substantial agreement, respectively. The intra-observer variation for a scaphoid fracture had an almost perfect agreement. For the localization of a scaphoid fracture and another fracture, there was an almost perfect and substantial agreement, respectively. In conclusion, the observer variation in MRI of suspected scaphoid fractures was low. The influence of expertise with MRI in daily practice should be taken into consideration. Observers with little experience of MRI will identify all scaphoid fractures but are likely to over-diagnose injuries. Based on these results, it is recommended that all scans are reviewed by an experienced radiologist."

CD010023,0,12690849,0,Scaphoid fractures: current treatments and techniques.,"Scaphoid fractures are among the most common fractures of the bones of the wrist and usually result from a forceful extension of the wrist. If the diagnosis cannot be established by clinical and radiographic examination, bone scans are recommended and are preferred over tomography or MRI, which are more expensive diagnostic procedures. Scaploid fractures should be classified as either undisplaced, stable or displaced, unstable. Nonsurgical treatment with cast immobilization (short arm-thumb spica cast) is recommended for stable fractures; however, there is increased interest in percutaneous screw (or pin) fixation. The recommended treatment for unstable scaphoid fractures is open reduction and screw fixation. Closed reduction and percutaneous screw or pin fixation can be considered in minimally displaced or reducible fractures, whereas open reduction is recommended for all other displaced fractures. The following treatment protocols are recommended: (1) bone scan or, if necessary, tomography for early diagnosis; (2) percutaneous screw fixation of nondisplaced or minimally displaced scaphoid fractures as an alternative to treatment with a thumb spica cast; (3) open reduction of displaced scaphoid fractures; (4) early mobilization of stable fractures after internal fixation; and (5) the possible use of a playing splint after athletic injuries when secure internal fixation is achieved."

CD010023,0,8164094,0,Cortical and trabecular bone contribute strength to the osteopenic distal radius.,"Fractures of the distal radius are common, especially in postmenopausal women, and their prevalence increases with age. Knowledge of the factors that increase the risk of fracture in this metaphyseal region would have predictive and therapeutic implications. Of particular interest in this study were (a) the relative contributions of cortical and trabecular bone to the strength of the distal radius and (b) the best radiographic features to use as strength indicators. In 21 forearms from fresh cadavera (median age at the time of death, 75 years), single photon absorptiometry and quantitative computed tomography were used to determine bone mineral content (BMC), density (BMC/W), and cross-sectional properties of the radius at distal and midshaft sites. Mechanical testing of the forearms then was used to determine the ultimate force and energy to cause the type of fracture that might be caused by a fall on the outstretched hand. Twelve of the 17 tested specimens sustained a fracture of the distal radius, and five sustained a fracture of the scaphoid. In the group of fractures of the distal radius, we found the cross-sectional area and moment of inertia of the cortical shell at the metaphyseal site to be better correlates of strength than the trabecular area and trabecular moment. In contrast, strength correlated much better with trabecular density than with cortical density. Overall, the best correlates of strength were the BMC and BMC/W at either the distal or proximal site. On balance, these results suggest that the thin cortical shell contributes substantially more to the mechanical strength of the distal radius than has been commonly appreciated."

In addition many patients are unhappy with the unpleasant appearance of the wrist joint. The complaints are related to tears of the triangular fibrocartilaginous complex, instability, and/or incongruity of the distal radioulnar joint and degenerative changes. Malunion of the distal radius must be taken into account when discussing treatment options. The purpose of this paper is to describe a treatment algorithm with respect to the clinical symptoms, the pathology as well as the presence or absence of a deformity of the distal radius."
CD010023,0,8753688,1,Magnetic resonance imaging versus bone scintigraphy in suspected scaphoid fracture.,"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become increasingly useful in the evaluation of musculoskeletal problems, including those of the wrist. In patients with a wrist injury, MRI is used mainly to assess vascularity of scaphoid non-union. However, the use of MRI in patients in the acute phase following carpal injury is not common. Three-phase bone scintigraphy is routinely performed from at least 72 h after injury in patients with suspected scaphoid fracture and negative initial radiographs. We evaluated MRI in this patient group. The bone scan was used as the reference method. Nineteen patients were included. Bone scintigraphy was performed in all 19 patients, but MRI could be obtained in only 16 (in three patients, MRI was stopped owing to claustrophobia). In five patients, MRI confirmed a scintigraphically suspected scaphoid fracture. In one patient, a perilunar luxation, without a fracture, was seen on MRI, while bone scintigraphy showed a hot spot in the region of the lunate bone, suspected for fracture. This was confirmed by surgery. In two patients, a hot spot in the scaphoid region was suspected for scaphoid fracture, and immobilization and employed for a period of 12 weeks. MRI was negative in both cases; in one of them a scaphoid fracture was retrospectively proven on the initial X-ray series. In another two patients, a hot spot in the region of MCP I was found with a negative MRI. In both, the therapy was adjusted. In the remaining six patients, both modalities were negative. We conclude that in the diagnostic management of patients with suspected scaphoid fracture and negative initial radiographs, the use of MRI may be promising, but is not superior to three-phase bone scintigraphy."

We present a case report of a 32-year-old woman who presented with a chief complaint of a left wrist pain, swelling and loss of all ranges of motions for approximately 1 year. She had no history of prior wrist trauma or steroid use. Laboratory testing for systemic disease or infection were negative. Diagnosis of avascular necrosis of the capitate has been made via plain film radiology, isotope bone scanning, and computed tomography scan. No etiologic factor could be identified. Surgical treatment was recommended, given drilling and autogenous bone grafting. Histological analysis showed necrotic bone. The physical therapy was implemented to restore function.

Therefore, in patients with a clinically suspected scaphoid fracture that cannot be proven by scaphoid x-rays, further diagnostic investigation is indicated. Which supplemental diagnostic tool (bone scintigraphy, MRI, CT) is preferred remains unclear. A below-the-elbow cast without immobilisation of the thumb is an adequate treatment for stable fractures.

Ninety-nine patients underwent this examination plus radiography to determine how often fracture pattern was identifiable by radiography including proximal fragment ratio (PFR) measurement. Oblique radiographs obtained at 45 degrees of pronation demonstrated a volar displacement in 28 of 37 volar type fractures in three-dimensional computed tomography (76%), while as oblique view with 45 degrees of supination could identify the dorsal type in ten of 18 (56%). PFR showed a significant difference, with means of 0.59 for volar type and 0.43 for dorsal type. Using oblique views in the two rotational directions together with the PFR, the two fracture patterns could be differentiated in 35 of 43 fractures (81%). No differences were evident between the two fracture patterns with respect to prevalence of dorsal intercalated segment instability deformity."

We conducted histomorphometric study of the scaphoid using micro CT to find regional variations and differences in the scaphoid to provide better understanding of fracture mechanism and suggest optimal screw position. We divided scaphoid into eight regions and collected regional data from eleven different cadaveric scaphoids. A computer program was used to measure parameters, which includes mean subchondral bone thickness, bone mineral density for bone density parameters, and tissue mineral density, trabecular thickness, trabecular spacing, trabecular number and bone volume fraction for bone quality parameters. All bone strength parameters were measured the maximum value in the regions where scaphoid articulates with radius. Articular regions presented higher bone strength parameters and thicker subchondral bone. The minimum value of trabecular number was in midcarpal side of waist portion. There was trend of higher subchondral bone thickness in the scaphoid which articulates with capitate and radius. This histomorphometric study showed regional variation of the scaphoid in terms of bone density and quality parameters. Waist portion presented thick subchondral and trabecular bone for high cross section moment of inertia against bending. Three point bending for scaphoid fracture and vertical screw placement are suggested based on these variations."

The purpose of this study is to describe the clinical and imaging features of osteoid osteomas involving the upper extremity, highlight the difficulties in the diagnosis in the various areas and propose a diagnostic workup. Fourty-eight patients with histologically confirmed osteoid osteoma of the upper extremity treated at the authors' department from 1985 to 2000 were retrospectively reviewed. Data pertinent on the patients' history, lesion location, clinical and imaging characteristics as well as any unique features of individual patients were collected. There were 29 males and 19 females with a mean age of 28 years (range 20-42). The average duration of symptoms before definite diagnosis was 18 months (range 2-62). Pain was the presenting symptom in 46 of 48 patients, whereas swelling was the main complaint in 2 of the patients. Mean pre-operative visual analogue pain scale (VAS), was 8.8 ranging from 5.1 to 9.3. Eight lesions were located in the humerus, 4 in the ulna and 7 in the radius. In the carpal bones, 4 were located in the scaphoid, 4 in the capitate and 5 in the hamate. Seven lesions were located at the metacarpals and 9 lesions at the phalanges (5 proximal, no middle and 4 distal phalangeal lesions). Radiographs alone were sufficient to establish the diagnosis of osteoid osteoma in 32 cases. Bone scans identified a ""hot spot"" in 16 patients without previous radiographic evidence of a lesion and furthermore, computed tomography was performed in 32 patients to assist in the intraosseous localization of the lesion, and in the pre-operative planning. All patients underwent operative excision of the lesion and the diagnosis was confirmed by histology. Mean follow-up was 28 months (range 25-42). Fourty-three patients had an uneventful recovery. Mean post-operative VAS value was 1.8 ranging from 0 to 3. Osteoid osteoma of the upper extremity often mimics other etiologies and the complex anatomy of the upper extremity, as well as the tendency of patients to relate their symptoms to trauma are factors that easily lead to misdiagnosis or delay in the diagnosis. A high index of suspicion is essential and the diagnosis is based on an accurate clinical assessment and careful selection of imaging studies."

To evaluate the independent reliability of the dynamic and static phases of the 3-phase bone scan in this diagnosis, 3 examiners reviewed the 3-phase bone scans of a series of 60 patients with clinical signs of fracture of the carpal scaphoid and with negative or non-diagnostic initial radiographs. The interpretation was performed independently and without the benefit of additional data. The bone scans were reviewed after 1 year by the same observers. The results were analyzed using kappa statistics. The bone scan was suspicious of fracture of the scaphoid in 15 patients. Irrespective of training and experience, the kappa values of the dynamic bone scan between any 2 observers did not exceed 0.57. The kappa values increased significantly when the static phase of the bone scan was examined (> 0.81). The intraobserver variability showed a similar pattern. We conclude that in suspected scaphoid fracture, the dynamic phase of the radionuclide bone scan alone cannot be used as a reliable diagnostic approach because of the low inter- and intraobserver agreement in the interpretation, irrespective of the experience and training of the observer."

Postmenopausal women (C, controls, n = 54; WF, wrist, n = 50; HF, hip, n = 62 recent fractured patients) were analyzed for lumbar and hip DXA areal BMD (aBMD), cancellous and cortical volumetric BMD (vBMD), and microstructural and geometric parameters on tibia and radius by HR-pQCT. Principal component analysis (PCA) allowed extracting factors that best represent bone variables. Comparison between groups was made by analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Two factors (>80% of the entire variability) are extracted by PCA: at the radius, the first is a combination of trabecular parameters and the second of cortical parameters. At the tibia, we found the reverse. Femoral neck aBMD is decreased in WF (8.6%) and in HF (18%) groups (no lumbar difference). WF showed a approximately 20% reduction in radius trabecular vBMD and number. Radius cortical vBMD and thickness decrease by 6% and 14%, respectively. At the tibia, only the cortical compartment is affected, with approximately 20% reduction in bone area, thickness, and section modulus and 6% reduction in vBMD. HF showed same radius trabecular alterations than WF, but radius cortical parameters are more severely affected than WF with reduced bone area (25%), thickness (28.5%), and vBMD (11%). At the tibia, trabecular vBMD and number decrease by 26% and 17.5%, respectively. Tibia cortical bone area, thickness, and section modulus showed a >30% decrease, whereas vBMD reduction reached 13%.

All of these patients additionally underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans within an average of 3 days after trauma to control the results of this study. MRI detected 112 injuries in 82 patients (67%). Twenty-eight (25%) of these injuries were scaphoid fractures. There were 15 fractures of other carpal bones, 14 avulsion fractures of extrinsic ligaments (AFL), 26 other bone injuries (fractures of distal radius, fractures of radial styloid, ulnar head fracture metacarpal fracture, bone bruises), and 29 soft tissue injuries (triangular fibro-cartilaginous complex injuries, complete or partial ruptures of the scapholunate ligament, ruptures of the radial collateral ligament, hemarthrosis). By means of repeated clinical examinations and plain scaphoid views, experienced observers were able to detect all the occult scaphoid fractures within 38 days, as well as most of the other fractures about the wrist except one fracture of the triquetrum. Soft tissue injuries, however, were diagnosed only in two cases of complete scapholunate ligament tears. It was further obvious that 70% of all scaphoid fractures and 60% of the AFLs were detected in a review of the initial X-rays by experienced surgeons. Only 30% of all scaphoid fractures detected were really occult and all of these were diagnosed correctly. This prospective study demonstrates that clinical and radiological standard procedures are reliable in the diagnosis of occult fractures of the carpus and wrist when performed by experienced observers.

We report two clinical cases: a 10-years follow-up with pain medication and intermittent antiresorptive therapy courses, subsequent traumatic vertebral fracture and actually fracture of scaphoid after inadequate trauma. Beside this long-term course a young female patient with pregnancy-associated osteoporosis and painful lumbar and also thoracic vertebral fractures is described. She was treated with an osteoanabolic therapy, at the timepoint of first follow-up at 6 months of treatment a solid increase of bone mineral density and sustained pain reduction was observed."

Fracture patients care!,"Fractures can be prevented if osteoporosis is identified and treated. Starting in 2002, we have been using a screening program in which patients between 50 and 75 years of age with a wrist, shoulder, vertebral, or hip fracture are assessed by DEXA of the hip and spine and if osteoporotic or osteopenic, they are encouraged to see a doctor of their own choice. The patients receive documents containing information, the results of DEXA, and a letter to present to their doctor with suggestions regarding blood tests and treatment. Here we report the 3-year follow-up regarding compliance to the recommended treatment."
CD010023,0,10613233,0,"Diagnosis and treatment of scaphoid fractures, can non-union be prevented?","In order to evaluate the diagnostic management of scaphoid fracture, 100 consecutive patients with clinically suspected scaphoid fractures were investigated. If a scaphoid fracture was seen on scaphoid radiographs, patients were immobilized in a plaster cast. If the radiographs were negative or dubious for scaphoid fracture, patients were referred for three phase bone scintigraphy. Then the patient was treated according to the result of the bone scan. A long-term follow-up (minimum 1 year) was performed in order to evaluate the incidence of non-union. In 49 of the 100 patients, a fracture of the scaphoid was recognized, in 29 of whom their scaphoid X-series was positive for scaphoid fracture. In 3 of the remaining 71 patients with negative scaphoid X-series, additional carpal box radiographs showed a scaphoid fracture, while 68 patients were referred for three-phase bone scintigraphy. Of these 68 patients, 17 patients (25%) showed a hotspot on the bone scan in the region of the scaphoid. We found that scaphoid radiographs, additional carpal box radiographs and the bone scan (in radiographically negative patients) in combination with conservative therapy did not lead to non-union at long-term follow-up in patients who were treated for scaphoid fracture. We conclude that when a scaphoid fracture is diagnosed within the 1st week followed by plaster immobilization, non-union of the scaphoid could be prevented."

MRI evaluation revealed that 27 of the 60 patients (45%) had triangular fibrocartilage lesions. No correlation was found between triangular fibrocartilage injury and the Melone classification system, the presence of an ulnar styloid fracture, comminution of the articular surface of the distal radius, >20 degrees dorsal angulation of the distal radius or subluxation/dislocation of the distal radioulnar joint on the plain X-rays. When Frykman Type VI and VIII fractures were compared with all the other Frykman subtypes, a significant difference in the incidence of triangular fibrocartilage complex tears was observed. We conclude that triangular fibrocartilage injury should be considered with all distal radial fractures, especially the Frykman Types VI and VIII."

CD010023,0,14612641,0,Displacement of the distal radioulnar joint of clinically symptom-free patients.,"There are three methods for evaluation of dislocation of the distal radioulnar joint using computed tomography: the radioulnar line method, the epicenter method, and the congruity method. However, some patients who are clinically symptom-free have abnormal findings from computed tomography of the distal radioulnar joint according to the aforementioned criteria. In addition, these methods are qualitative, not quantitative definitions. Forty patients were included in this study. Computed tomography scans of the wrists were done. The variation of displacement of the distal radioulnar joint was measured. By the epicenter method, the 95% confidence interval (mean +/- 1.96 standard error) was from 0.0026 to 0.1114 in supination and from -0.1171 to 0.0446 in pronation. By the radioulnar line method, the 95% confidence interval was from 0.0026 to 0.0479 in supination and from -0.0065 to 0.0745 in pronation. By the modified radioulnar line method, the 95% confidence interval was from 0.1778 to 0.2752 in supination and from 0.0990 to 0.2310 in pronation. There was a wide range of the displacement of the distal radioulnar joint in patients with clinically normal wrists. The results can be regarded as reference points for normal variation of the distal radioulnar joint. This can help to differentiate the causes of internal derangement of the wrist."
CD010023,0,8885535,0,Fractures and nonunions of the scaphoid.,"Fractures of the scaphoid are the most common of all fractures of the carpal bones. Scaphoid collapse and angular deformity may develop after fractures. Scaphoid nonunion often complicates scaphoid fractures especially if the diagnosis is missed initially, and adequate timely treatment is not provided. Displaced unstable fractures also have a tendency to develop nonunion. The tenuous vascular anatomy of the scaphoid, the inherent biomechanical instability of scaphoid fractures, and the difficulty of radiographic diagnosis are the culprits of nonunion. Established scaphoid nonunion is a challenging and difficult problem to treat and more so is the treatment of failed nonunion after grafting. New methods of diagnosis and treatment of scaphoid injuries are constantly evolving. One common method of treating scaphoid nonunion with angular deformity is length restoration using a wedge bone graft and Herbert screw fixation through a palmar approach. Early diagnosis and attention to details of surgical technique are necessary for successful treatment outcome. The purpose of this report is to review the basic science, diagnosis, and treatment of scaphoid fractures and nonunions."

This report outlines the case of a 35-year-old healthy man who sustained a bony avulsion of the subscapularis tendon during an abduction external rotation trauma to his left shoulder. The injury was diagnosed by physical examination, standard radiographs, and magnetic resonance imaging. An arthroscopic reconstruction including closed reduction and internal fixation using suture anchors was performed. After a follow-up of 6 months, the patient's Constant Score increased from 62.4 points preoperatively to 91.3 points. At the latest follow-up, the patient was completely pain free, had regained a full work activity level, and returned to overhead sports. On postoperative standard radiographs and magnetic resonance images, the bony fragment was shown to be consolidated in an anatomic position. In cases of displaced isolated fractures of the lesser tuberosity without significant subluxation or dislocation of the long head of the biceps arthroscopic reconstruction using suture anchors can lead to a good clinical and radiological result."

Two hundred consecutive patients attending a fracture clinic were assigned to have either a standard cast consisting of synthetic or plaster of paris, or a focused rigidity cast of synthetic material. Patients were assessed using a specially developed scoring system termed the Bradford Plaster Index. In patients with fractures of the base of fifth metatarsal, focused rigidity casting proved superior to traditional techniques for ability score (p=0.0001), satisfaction score (p=0.0023), overall impairment of function (p=0.019), limitation of movement following cast removal (p=0.024) and in limitation of muscle strength following cast removal (p=0.001). In fractures of the distal radius, focused rigidity casting was superior for ability score (p=0.0002) and satisfaction score (p=0.00009). Patients with scaphoid fractures were better for satisfaction score (p=0.0483). Compared with the standard technique, focused rigidity casting has been shown to be superior to traditional methods with regard to satisfaction and functional scores without any detriment to clinical results."

Thirty-one out of the 50 children showed no fracture. Six of them were treated for a median period of 9 days on clinical grounds; the others were discharged with reassurance. Four patients with evidence of soft tissue injury received no further treatment. Six of the 12 patients with a fracture on bone scan were treated with a cast for more than 4 weeks. None of the patients developed any complications. Bone scan is helpful when the diagnosis of a carpal fracture in children is equivocal.
CD010023,0,9700423,0,The role of arthroscopy in the treatment of wrist injuries in the athlete.,"Wrist arthroscopy provides an ideal means of evaluating intraarticular soft-tissue injuries of the wrist. Many lesions such as tears of the triangular fibrocartilage complex can be treated by arthroscopic means as well. Reduction of articular fractures of the distal radius and pin fixation, reduction of scaphoid fractures and intramedullary fixation, and arthroscopic reduction and transcutaneous pin stabilization of acute carpal dissociation patterns can all be accomplished with minimally invasive techniques under arthroscopic control. These measures often provide the athlete with shorter periods of immobilization and earlier return to athletic competition. Wrist arthroscopy provides a very useful adjunct to the treatment armamentarium of all sports medicine physicians."
CD010023,0,18219475,0,[A new vascularized cartilague-bone-graft for scaphoid nonunion with avascular necrosis of the proximal pole. Description of a new type of surgical procedure].,"The formation of a scaphoid pseudarthrosis with avascular necrosis in the area of the carpus is a The formation of a scaphoid pseudarthrosis with avascular necrosis in the area of the carpus is a dreaded complication after conservative or operative treatment of a scaphoid bone fracture, which previously often led to partial or total stiffening operations on the wrist. Vascularized bone grafts can be used to increase the bone fusion rates in the presence of scaphoid pseudarthrosis with avascular necrosis. On a note of caution, it must be mentioned, though, that such a procedure in the presence of avascular necrosis of the proximal pole with destruction of cartilage can lead to premature radiocarpal arthritis, because a friction-free gliding in the area of the proximal scaphoid pole is no longer ensured as a result of the lacking cartilage cover.We confronted these problems in a 20-year-old male patient with avascular necrosis of the proximal scaphoid bone pole and destruction of the corresponding scaphoidal cartilage cover. We transplanted a free vascularized cartilage-bone graft from the medial femoral condyle, which was adapted in form and size to the proximal scaphoid bone pole with corresponding cartilage cover and was connected to the radial vascular bundle. This novel operation technique is described in this report and appears to be a promising way of avoiding premature radiocarpal arthritis when treating scaphoid bone pseudo-arthrosis with avascular necrosis in the presence of cartilage destruction."

CD010023,0,9075627,0,Associations of early premenopausal fractures with subsequent fractures vary by sites and mechanisms of fractures.,"In a retrospective population-based study we assessed whether and how self-reported former fractures sustained at the ages of 20-34 are associated with subsequent fractures sustained at the ages of 35-57. The 12,162 women who responded to fracture questions of the baseline postal enquiry (in 1989) of the Kuopio Osteoporosis Study, Finland formed the study population. They reported 589 former and 2092 subsequent fractures. The hazard ratio (HR), with 95% confidence interval (CI), of a subsequent fracture was 1.9 (1.6-2.3) in women with the history of a former fracture compared with women without such a history. A former low-energy wrist fracture was related to subsequent low-energy wrist [HR = 3.7 (2.0-6.8)] and high-energy nonwrist [HR = 2.4 (1.3-4.4)] fractures, whereas former high-energy nonwrist fractures were related only to subsequent high-energy nonwrist [HR = 2.8 (1.9-4.1)] but not to low-energy wrist [HR = 0.7 (0.3-1.8)] fractures. The analysis of bone mineral density (BMD) data of a subsample of premenopausal women who underwent dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) during 1989-91 revealed that those with a wrist fracture due to a fall on the same level at the age of 20-34 recorded 6.5% lower spinal (P = 0.140) and 10.5% lower femoral (P = 0.026) BMD than nonfractured women, whereas the corresponding differences for women with a former nonwrist fracture due to high-energy trauma were -1.8% (P = 0.721) and -2.4% (P = 0. 616), respectively. Our results suggest that an early premenopausal, low-energy wrist fracture is an indicator of low peak BMD which predisposes to subsequent fractures in general, whereas early high-energy fractures are mainly indicators of other and more specific extraskeletal factors which mainly predispose to same types of subsequent fractures only."

In this pilot study (n = 31) most cases with clinical suspicion of scaphoid fractures reached a positive test result on the combined 7 clinical tests (93.5%). Using this test combination, no scaphoid fractures were missed (no false-negatives; sensitivity 100%), but it also included many patients with no scaphoid fracture. Many of these, however, were found to have another fracture. In total, 48% had a scaphoid fracture, 19% another fracture and 32% no fracture. In the pilot study the proposed protocol seems to be a safe protocol, without missing scaphoid fractures.

The goal is to achieve a pain free functional wrist, and residual articular step offs of 2 mm or more will prevent such a result. Classification systems have evolved to reflect the preeminent consideration that must be given to the articular surface, and preoperative radiographic evaluation should usually include tomographic imaging to avoid a failure to recognize the fragment positions. A number of papers of the past decade have demonstrated that operative reduction of intraarticular fragments to reconstruct the articular surface and diminish step offs will give better clinical results, at least during the first several years of followup so far available. Attention to meticulous surgical technique will facilitate good results."

Magnetic resonance imaging was performed prior to wrist arthroscopy. The latter examination gave the definite diagnosis. MRI was performed in conventional technique (without contrast medium) in 25 cases and after additional intravenous injection of contrast medium in the remaining 20 patients. The images were obtained with a 1.0-T clinical imager using a T(2)-weighted turbo spin echo sequence (slice 3 mm, transversal) and a FLASH 2D sequence (slice 2 mm, oblique/coronal). Three independent observers assessed the MRI scans before arthroscopy was performed. The correct diagnosis was made by MRI in 76 %. Overall sensitivity and specificity came to 71 % and 86 %, respectively. The use of intravenously applied contrast medium did not improve MRI accuracy. In conclusion, MRI is not recommended for the diagnosis of scapholunate ligament tears. Presumably, the results of MRI could be improved by a more sophisticated technique."
CD010023,0,11337918,0,[Role of wrist instability in the onset of pseudoarthrosis of the scaphoid bone].,"The most common fracture involving the wrist is a fracture of the scaphoid bone. Fracture of the scaphoid most frequently occurs in young adult male and usually involves the wrist of the scaphoid. There is a universal agreement that the majority of these fractures will heal if immobilized property and for a long period of time [1, 2]. In the treatment of these fractures much attention has been payed to bone damage and not to associated ligament injury. It is reported that the incidence of nonunion of scaphoid fractures is ten per cent and that the frequency of this complication remains essentially unchanged [3, 4]. Failure to improve the outcome suggests that the mechanisms and causes of this complication are poorly understood. Explanations of nonunion or delayed union of scaphoid bone are: poor initial treatment or even no treatment [3], delayed diagnosis [5], fragments displacement [5-8], improper immobilization [9], site and direction of the fracture [3] and wrist instability [8, 10]."

These scans showed that 14 fractures had not united and that 30 had united throughout the whole cross-section of the scaphoid. The other 22 had partially united with bridging trabeculae in some areas of the cross-section. These 22 partial unions were graded as 0% to 24% union (0 cases), 25% to 49% union (5 cases), 50% to 74% union (7 cases), and 75% to 99% union (10 cases). The 12 patients who had less than 75% fracture union were followed-up further and nine underwent another CT scan at 23 to 40 weeks after the initial injury. These showed union across the whole of the cross-section of the fracture in seven cases and 75% to 99% union in the other two cases, who had full and painless wrist function.

With the wrists prone and immobilized, bone scintigrams were obtained for 500,000 counts with an asymmetric (133 to 161 keV) Tc-99m energy window and either a converging (best choice) or straight-bore, high-resolution collimator. High-resolution scintigraphy precisely localized degenerative joint disease (nine patients), scaphoid fractures (five), pisiform fracture (one), lunate avascular necrosis (one), radioulnar arthritis (one), septic or inflammatory arthritis (six), ulnocarpal impingement (two), and reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome (two). Images obtained palm down with the wrist in ulnar deviation helped identify increased uptake within the scaphoid. Fracture and significant bone or joint disease were excluded in one patient."
CD010023,0,2315496,0,Demonstration of the scapholunate space with radiography.,"The importance of radiographic evaluation of the scapholunate space, which should not be wider than 2 mm, has been well established in cases of wrist injury. Unfortunately, the assessment of this space is not accurately determined with routine posteroanterior (PA) radiographs, because the scaphoid and lunate bones often overlap. Moreover, the exact portion of the scapholunate space that should be measured has never been clearly defined. Nine wrists with a scapholunate space no wider than 2 mm and without chondrocalcinosis were studied by means of plain routine views and special projections, transaxial and coronal computed tomographic scans, and dissection to determine the precise orientation and anatomy of this space. A PA radiograph with 10 degrees of tube angulation from the ulna toward the radius best demonstrated the scapholunate space. This space should be measured at the level of the midportion of the flat lateral facet of the scaphoid."

Detection of tarsal navicular stress fractures in long distance runners, including the diagnostic value of radionuclide bone scanning, is discussed."
CD010023,0,11075601,0,MRI in the management of scaphoid fractures in skeletally immature patients.,"The scaphoid is the commonest fractured carpal bone, but excluding a scaphoid fracture with plain radiographs is difficult.

CD010023,0,9523959,0,Measurement of the scaphoid humpback deformity using longitudinal computed tomography: intra- and interobserver variability using various measurement techniques.,"The intra- and interobserver variability of 3 techniques for measuring the humpback deformity of 37 scaphoids using longitudinal computed tomography was assessed. The 3 measuring techniques were the lateral intrascaphoid angle, the dorsal cortical angle, and the height-to-length ratio. The intraobserver reliability of the intrascaphoid angle was poor; the dorsal cortical angle was moderate to excellent, and the height-to-length ratio was excellent. The interobserver reliability of the intrascaphoid angle was poor to moderate, the dorsal cortical angle was moderate to excellent, and the height-to-length ratio was moderate to excellent. For all 3 observers, the intra- and interobserver reliability was the best for the height-to-length ratio and worst for the intrascaphoid angle. The height-to-length ratio is the most reproducible method of assessing the humpback deformity. Clinical correlation is required to establish whether the height-to-length ratio will be of value in predicting the outcome of fractures of the scaphoid."

CD010023,0,12666296,0,Combined fracture of the distal radius and scaphoid in children. Report of 2 cases.,"The authors report 2 cases of concomitant scaphoid and distal radial fractures, a rare combination of lesions in children. The first case was in a 13-year-old boy who presented a transverse midscaphoid fracture associated with a Salter type II distal radial fracture. The second concerned a 10-year-old boy who presented a bilateral wrist injury. On the left side, a distal forearm fracture with anterior displacement was associated with a transverse midscaphoid fracture. On the right side, there was only a distal forearm fracture. Scaphoid fracture associated with distal radial fracture seems to have been more frequently reported in the literature during the last decade, probably because it is more frequently recognised. In fact, children with distal forearm injury should be well examined both clinically and radiologically in order to search for an associated scaphoid fracture. Reduction of the radius fracture should be done carefully to avoid possible displacement of the scaphoid fracture."
CD010023,0,21445650,0,[Scaphoid fractures in childhood].,"This article reviews current knowledge about scaphoid fractures in children and adolescents, including the development of the scaphoid, its injuries and age-specific treatment for acute and late presenting fractures. The following recommendations are based on the literature, although scientific evidence to support treatment strategies is scarce. The diagnosis of scaphoid fractures is often missed on initial X-rays. Therefore all suspected fractures should be treated with a thumb spica cast for 2 weeks, followed by clinical examination and repeat X-ray if symptoms persist. In cases of negative X-ray findings an MRI or alternatively a CT scan are indicated. None or minimally displaced paediatric scaphoid fractures should be treated in a spica cast for at least 7 weeks until union is documented. Unlike in adults, evidence has not been provided for a benefit of routine surgical therapy. Late presenting non-unions that have not yet been treated adequately warrant a trial of conservative therapy, because healing can be expected under prolonged immobilisation. Surgical treatment should be reserved for dislocated fractures, established pseudarthroses that have not united under adequate conservative treatment or for patients to whom prolonged immobilisation does not appear to be acceptable."
CD010023,0,21087881,0,[Bone scintigraphy in evaluation of bone vascularisation at wrist and hand].,"Diphosphonate bone scintigraphy is used since the 1970s for studying bone pathology; it is increasingly common because of increased physical activity of the population. The disphosphonate uptake in bone requires the preservation of bone vascularity and reflects osteoblastic activity; it allows studying the viability of bone. Using data from the literature and our experience, we tried to take stock of its main uses in routine emphasizing the study of vascular and describe its use in fractures of the scaphoid and in the study of vascularised bone transfers. If the value of scintigraphy is well known, the use made by means of pinhole collimator and the market entry of new and more sensitive detectors with better resolution could allow the side of the imaging anatomy of improving the study of the vascularisation of small bone transfers which are increasingly used, particularly at wrist and hand."

It is most useful in assessing bone and joint anatomy and has only a secondary role in soft tissue abnormalities. The clearest value of CT is in assessing trauma and post-traumatic complications, such as malunion, nonunion, or avascular necrosis, where careful attention to position and technique can yield important information not otherwise obtainable."

CD010023,0,17993420,0,The pathology of the long ulna: anatomy and treatment.,"A long ulna, as a result of congenital differential growth, such as Madelung's disease, or injury, commonly a consequence of a malunited distal radial fracture, may present clinically as pain, decreased motion, mainly of pronosupination, and weakness of grip. Secondary effects may include perforations and tears of the triangular fibrocartilage complex, cartilage wear of the proximal surface of lunate and triquetrum and tears of the lunotriquetral ligament. Positive ulnar variance may be evident on X-rays but a prominent ulnar head cannot always be excluded when there is neutral ulnar variance and further investigations, such as an arthroCTscan or arthroscopy, may be necessary. The two principle treatment options are (a) resection of the distal ulna (Darrach's and Sauvé-Kapandji's techniques are commonly used) and (b) techniques preserving the ulnar head, including different modalities of shortening osteotomy. The aim is to regain a congruent distal radioulnar joint, restore painless and normal pronosupination and prevent onset of osteoarthritis of this joint."
CD010023,0,1747314,0,Bilateral stress fracture of the scaphoid. A case report.,Bilateral stress fractures of the scaphoid bones in a gymnast are reported and discussed with special consideration of the possible differential diagnoses; bipartite scaphoid and pseudarthrosis of the scaphoid bone. The relevance of the mechanical factors involved and the abduction and dorsiflexion of the wrist in gymnastics are suggested as likely pathomechanisms.
CD010023,0,17941586,0,[Post-traumatic cyst of the scaphoid--a case report].,"Carpal bone cysts are very uncommon and they are usually occasionally diagnosed during radiological examination of the wrist after trauma. Some carpal bone cysts are symptomatic and then they are revealed on routine X-ray investigation. We present a case of 14 years old boy, in whom a scaphoid bone cyst developed around the foreign body (a splinter), stacked into the wrist when he fell on the wooden board. Because of pain, swelling and reduction of active range of motion of the wrist occurred at the load of the hand and lasted 3 months, patient was given radiological examination which was negative, and eventually CT scanning revealed a scaphoid bone cyst. Patient underwent operation: curettage of the lesion followed by filling of the bone defect with prepared allogenic bone. Histopathological examination of the contents of the cyst showed presence of wood piece, surrounded with granulomatic tissue and necrotic trabecular bone. This suggested a splinter stacked in the wrist at the primary injury to be a cause of cyst formation. Surgery resulted in complete recovery in 6 months."
CD010023,0,19959447,0,Undisplaced scaphoid waist fractures: is 4 weeks' immobilisation in a below-elbow cast sufficient if a week 4 CT scan suggests fracture union?,"This prospective study investigated a cohort of 59 scaphoid waist fractures which were treated nonoperatively in a below-elbow plaster cast for 4 weeks and then underwent a Week 4 CT scan to assess displacement and progress to union. Forty-three were classed as undisplaced and 37 of these 43 were also classed as 'united'. All the 37 undisplaced and 'united' fractures united with up to 8 weeks' cast immobilisation, including 26 which were taken out of plaster at 4 weeks and mobilised. We conclude that scaphoid waist fractures which appear to be undisplaced and united on a week 4 CT scan will unite, and may not need to be immobilised in a plaster cast for more than 4 weeks. Such a treatment policy may reduce the period of disability and time off work associated with nonoperative treatment."
CD010023,0,11572122,0,[Management of proximal scaphoid bone pseudarthroses and fractures with the mini-Herbert screw via a dorsal approach].,"32 patients, aged 16 to 49 years, were treated by osteosynthesis using the Herbert mini screw. The indications were five fractures (type B3, Herbert classification), two delayed unions (type C) and 25 nonunions (type D1 to D3, Filan and Herbert classification). Six patients received no bone grafts, 19 received cancellous bone graft from the radius. An interpositional iliac crest bone graft was used in four, and a vascularized bone graft from the distal radius in three cases respectively. The average postoperative immobilisation in a forearm splint was nine weeks. 26 patients could be recruited for clinical follow-up at an average of 14.5 months. The radiological results were assessed in 30 cases (94%). Bony consolidation was achieved in 26 cases (100% of the fractures, 84% of the nonunions). In three cases a loosening of the screw, and in three further cases a dislocation into the radiocarpal joint were observed. A humpback deformity was present in four cases. Three patients showed a persisting nonunion, one patient a fibrous union. Early degenerative changes of the radiocarpal joint were observed in six cases. The clinical follow up examination showed an average grip strength of 91% (JAMAR II), 94% for the three finger, and 95% for the pinch grip compared to the contralateral side. The mean postoperative pain score on the visual analog scale was one for resting conditions, eleven for motion and 33 under stress. The range of motion was 79% of the opposite side for extension/flexion and 83% for radial/ulnar deviation. The average DASH-score reached 15 points. The Herbert mini screw has proven to be a reliable implant for reconstruction of proximal pole fractures and nonunions of the scaphoid."
CD010023,0,7936737,0,The distal radioulnar joint following Galeazzi's fracture.,Fourteen patients underwent evaluation of the distal radioulnar joint following Galeazzi's fracture. Five of 12 patients who underwent a preoperative magnetic resonance imaging scan of the wrist had evidence of injury to the triangular fibrocartilage complex. These 5 patients also had abnormal intraoperative radiocarpal arthrograms. The amount of radial shortening in the injured forearm was measured prior to surgical treatment. Injury to the distal radioulnar joint appeared to be independent of the amount of radial shortening.
CD010023,0,16328449,0,Trapezium fracture associated with occult fracture of the proximal pole of the scaphoid.,There has been no case of simultaneous fracture of the trapezium and the proximal pole of the scaphoid. We have treated a case with this combination. The fracture of the proximal pole of the scaphoid was only found on computed tomography imaging. We performed accurate reduction and fixation of both fractures with cannulated headless compression screws in a minimally invasive technique. We obtained rigid initial fixation and good clinical and radiographical results.

To date, there is a small volume of literature examining these stress fractures, particularly as it pertains to outcomes of surgical management."
CD010023,0,18656779,0,Treatment of scaphoid fractures and nonunions.,"Scaphoid fractures are common but present unique challenges because of the particular geometry of the fractures and the tenuous vascular pattern of the scaphoid. Delays in diagnosis and inadequate treatment for acute scaphoid fractures can lead to nonunions and subsequent degenerative wrist arthritis. Improvements in diagnosis, surgical treatment, and implant materials have encouraged a trend toward early internal fixation, even for nondisplaced scaphoid fractures that could potentially be treated nonoperatively. Despite the advent of newly developed fixation techniques, including open and percutaneous fixation, the nonunion rate for scaphoid fractures remains as high as 10% after surgical treatment. Scaphoid nonunions can present with or without avascular necrosis of the proximal pole and may show a humpback deformity on the radiograph. If left untreated, scaphoid nonunions can progress to carpal collapse and degenerative arthritis. Surgical treatment is directed at correcting the deformity with open reduction and internal fixation with bone grafting. Recently, vascularized bone grafts have gained popularity in the treatment of scaphoid nonunions, particularly in cases with avascular necrosis. This article reviews current concepts regarding the treatment of scaphoid fractures and nonunions."
CD010023,0,7706881,0,Os centrale carpi simulating a scaphoid waist fracture.,"The os centrale carpi is a relatively rare accessory carpal bone, and its presence may be confused with a scaphoid fracture. A case is presented which simulated an un-united scaphoid fracture on the plain X-ray film. However, CT in the sagittal plane showed two rounded fragments on the dorsum of the scaphoid with smooth, regular cortical margins differing from an acute scaphoid fracture. Their volume combined with the volume of the scaphoid is more than that of a completely normal scaphoid. There is no evidence of degeneration in the two rounded fragments and scaphoid. Because of these features, the diagnosis of soft tissue injury with an incidental finding of an os centrale carpi was suggested."

CD010023,0,11117050,0,Hand and wrist injuries in young athletes.,"Successful treatments of musculoskeletal injuries in the pediatric population demand a thorough understanding of the basic anatomy and its biomechanics, and the physiology of growth and development of the immature skeleton. In addition, good treatment outcomes rely on the treating physician being an effective teacher to the young athlete and the patient's parents, coaches, and trainers. At the same time, the physician must be a good student in learning the nature of the patient's sports and each patient's athletic ability and aspirations. Most pediatric hand and wrist injuries can be treated nonoperatively with proper immobilization techniques and activity modification, but cases requiring surgical intervention must be recognized promptly to avoid long-term complications."

A thorough understanding of the mechanism of injury and imaging findings are necessary for accurate diagnosis and effective therapy. This knowledge allows the clinician to effectively educate the athlete concerning the risks, complications, and prognosis of the injury and its treatment.

These injuries can lead to pain, dysfunction, and loss of productivity. Conventional radiography remains the primary imaging modality for evaluation of suspected carpal fractures and dislocations. However, multidetector computed tomography (CT) is playing an increasingly important role, especially in the following situations: (a) when results from initial radiographs are negative in patients with suspected carpal fractures, (b) when initial radiographic findings are indeterminate, and (c) when knowledge of the extent of carpal fractures or dislocations is required before surgical treatment. The advantages of multidetector CT include quick and accurate diagnosis with availability in most emergency centers. Multidetector CT can easily display the extent of carpal fractures and dislocations, often depicting fractures that are occult at radiography. In addition, with multiplanar (two-dimensional) and volumetric (three-dimensional) reformation, pathologic conditions and anatomic relationships are better perceived. This information can be easily conveyed to orthopedic and trauma surgeons and can be crucial for surgical treatment and planning."

CD010023,0,16865353,0,[Scaphoid fracture and nonunion: current status of radiological diagnostics].,"Scaphoid fractures, which involve approximately two-thirds of all wrist injuries, are often not detected during initial radiographic examination. By using high-resolution CT and dedicated MRI, it is possible to recognize scaphoid fractures soon at the first diagnostic approach and to assess fragment stability. CT imaging provides all the relevant information of the fracture extent and of the fracture healing in the follow-up. MRI is most sensitive in the detection of scaphoid fractures; however, fracture signs must be differentiated from those of a bone bruise. Both the initially overseen scaphoid fracture and the unsuccessful healing can lead to the natural history of scaphoid nonunion. In the injured scaphoid, CT imaging is essential for depicting the osseous morphology, whereas contrast-enhanced MRI is crucial for assessing the viability of the proximal fragment."

The extent of the ligamentous tears is relative to the magnitude of the forces applied and the anterior lunate dislocation corresponds to the more severe lesions. When a scaphoid fracture is associated, its treatment is predominant. Conservative treatment of a perilunate dislocation results very frequently in carpal instability and subsequently in wrist osteoarthritis after a variable period of time. Surgical treatment is now indicated in a great majority of cases, for reduction and fixation of a displaced scaphoid, or for ligament repairs."
CD010023,0,9283837,0,Imaging and staging of avascular osteonecroses at the wrist and hand.,"Avascular ostenecroses (AVN) are unspecific focal sceletal lesions of vascular origin. At the wrist, AVNs are mainly seen in the lunate (Kienbock's disease) and the proximal scaphoid fragment in the presence of a nonunion disease (pseudarthrosis). Other types of osteonecroses are rare. The natural process of devitalization proceeds in steps: initially, there is a bone marrow oedema, followed by trabecula sclerosis, cystic transformation of the spongiosa, and bone fragmentation. End stages include carpal collapse (SLAC wrist) and osteoarthritis. For imaging of the sceletal morphology in AVN computed tomography is most useful, whereas initial stages and perfusion damages are better detected with contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In this paper a staging classification for Kienböck's disease and the scaphoid nonunion, considering the diagnostic and therapeutic consequences, is presented."

Ten men and one woman with an average age of 49 yrs (17-72) sustained a high-energy trauma with severe mutilation of digit and hand but with intact pulp. Eight cases of open finger fractures with composite loss of substance and three cases of bone and joint infection (thumb, wrist, fifth finger) were included. All cases were treated by the induced membrane technique which consists in stable fixation, flap if necessary, and in filling the bone defect by a cement methyl methacrylate polymere (PMMA) spacer. A secondary procedure at two months is needed where the cement is removed and the void is filled by cancellous bone. The key point of this induced membrane technique is to respect the foreign body membrane which formed around the cement spacer creating a biologic chamber. Bone union was evaluated prospectively by X-ray and CT scan by a surgeon not involved in the treatment. Failure was defined as non-union at one year, or uncontrolled sepsis at one month. Two cases failed to achieve bone union. No septic complications occurred and all septic cases were controlled. In nine cases, bone union was achieved within four months (three to 12). Evidence of osteoid formation was determined by a bone biopsy in one case. Masquelet first reported 35 cases of large tibial non-union defects treated by the induced membrane technique. The cement spacer promotes foreign body membrane induction constituting a biological chamber. Works on animal models reported by Pellissier and Viateau demonstrated membrane properties: secretion of growths factors (VEGF, TGF beta1, BMP2) and osteoinductive cellular activity. The induced membrane seems to mimic a neoperiosteum. This technique is useful in emergency or septic conditions where bone defects cannot be treated by shortening. It avoids microsurgery and is limited by availability of cancellous bone."
CD010023,0,10584943,0,Scaphoid nonunion and flexor pollicis longus tendon rupture.,Four patients presented with a rupture of the flexor pollicis longus tendon that was associated with a longstanding scaphoid nonunion. A radiocarpal arthrosis was present in 3 of the 4 patients and a dorsiflexed intercalated segment instability deformity was also seen in 3 of the 4 patients. Three patients underwent surgery consisting of an osteosynthesis with an iliac bone graft for the scaphoid nonunion and a palmaris longus tendon graft for the ruptured flexor pollicis longus tendon. An osseous union of the scaphoid and a functional active range of motion of the thumb interphalangeal joint (33 degrees on average) was attained in all 3 of the patients treated surgically. Preoperative radiologic examinations and intraoperative findings suggest that the volarly protruding distal scaphoid segment is the cause of the rupture.
CD010023,0,10584942,0,Retrograde compression screw fixation of acute proximal pole scaphoid fractures.,"Seventeen consecutive patients with acute unstable proximal pole scaphoid fractures were managed over the past 5 years with open reduction and internal fixation. Four fractures were displaced, with greater than 1 mm of fragment offset and intercarpal malalignment. The operative technique consisted of a dorsal approach to the scaphoid, radius bone grafting, and freehand retrograde Herbert compression screw fixation. The patients were evaluated at an average of 37 months (range, 12-63 months) after surgery. All fractures healed within 13 weeks (average, 10 weeks). Functional wrist range of motion and grip strength were achieved in all patients. No patients developed osteonecrosis or radioscaphoid arthritis. Open reduction and internal fixation rather than primary casting is a better means of reducing the complications of delayed union, nonunion, and irreparable osteonecrosis that often occur after acute proximal pole scaphoid fracture treated with cast immobilization."

Some cysts were found to develop very slowly from an area of trabecular fading to a well-defined cavity, bordered by a zone of radiopacity. Pain was constantly correlated to cysts with marginal sclerosis and at operation these cysts were found to be made up of fibrous tissue with mucoid changes. Most cysts were located in the scaphoid and lunate which are known to have vulnerable vascular supplies. These bones are also exposed to heavy load during power grip. It is, therefore, plausible that these cysts are caused by intramedullary vascular disturbances, followed by bone resorption and fibroblastic proliferation, and that pain is elicited by increasing pressure inside the cyst."
CD010023,0,10588471,0,Magnetic resonance imaging of the humpback scaphoid: the technique and a mathematical performance evaluation.,Surgical treatment of scaphoid nonunion and malunion with excessive intrascaphoid angulation (humpback deformity) usually involves a bone graft that is intended to correct the deformity. The volar bone graft length determines the degree of angular correction and scaphoid elongation. It is recommended that the length of the graft be determined by careful preoperative measurement of the deformity. Previous imaging techniques are inherently limited. The present paper describes a technique using three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging. Scaphoid fracture angulation is calculated from measurements of comparable sagittal slices of the patient's fractured and normal scaphoid. Optimal bone graft length is determined by using simple trigonometric principles. Magnetic resonance imaging provides additional important information regarding vascularity of the proximal pole and the status of the periscaphoid ligaments and hyaline cartilage. Mathematical performance evaluation indicates that this technique is a promising method for planning reconstructive surgery of the scaphoid.
CD010023,0,17009819,0,Development of a clinical decision tool for suspected scaphoid fractures.,"Scaphoid fractures are the most common carpal fractures; their overall incidence is however low. Missing a scaphoid fracture may lead to a non-union with a possible disastrous outcome for the patient; for this reason, treatment of a suspected scaphoid fracture, even without a proven fracture on the first radiograph, has been conservative with plaster treatment. There are many clinical tests developed to diagnose a scaphoid fracture. However not all tests are equally practical, and their sensitivity and specificity are not always known, or are very low. In this study 18 clinical tests were evaluated and a subset of 7 tests remained, which were found to be practical and/or had a high enough sensitivity. A clinical decision protocol was developed using a combination of these seven tests, in order to improve diagnostic accuracy and at the same time reduce unnecessary plaster cast treatment of patients with a suspected scaphoid, who turn out to only have a sprained wrist."

A comparison of two vascularized bone grafts.,"Surgically, it is difficult to achieve union of a scaphoid nonunion that is associated with osteonecrosis of the proximal pole, and those with carpal collapse are especially difficult to treat. A variety of vascularized bone grafts can be used.

Twenty-nine patients with navicular nonunion or pseudarthrosis, rheumatoid arthritis, recent fractures, soft-tissue alterations, and bone tumors were examined.

Axial load injuries that result in a complete coronal fracture of the scaphoid associated with an acute scapholunate dissociation are exceedingly rare. In our patient the radiographic finding of wide scapholunate dissociation was obvious; however, the coronal scaphoid fracture was not recognized initially nor suspected. During surgery the coronal scaphoid fracture was identified, reduced anatomically, and fixed with a compression screw. The scapholunate ligament also was repaired. A good result was obtained with return to sports with extension of 60 degrees and flexion of 70 degrees , grip strength equal to that of the uninjured wrist, and no radiographic problems (arthrosis, avascular necrosis, nonunion)."

CD010023,0,1629558,0,Computerized tomographic evaluation of acute distal radial fractures.,"To learn whether computerized tomography offered additional useful information over conventional radiographic evaluation of acute distal radial fractures in the younger adult, we scanned 22 consecutive injured wrists. Of the distal radial fractures in 19 wrists, sixteen were defined on plain films as intra-articular. In contrast, computerized tomography demonstrated that all fractures of the distal radius had intra-articular extension. In 3 wrists interpreted as being normal on plain films, despite clinical suspicion of a fracture, fractures were confirmed by computerized tomography. As a result of computerized tomography, injuries were assigned a higher Frykman value in 5 cases, and consideration of alternative patient management became necessary in 5 of the 22 patients."
CD010023,0,1861032,0,Analysis of scaphoid fracture displacement by three-dimensional computed tomography.,"Scaphoid fracture displacement was studied in twenty-five patients using three-dimensional computed tomography. Fracture displacement was more readily detected and distinct in three-dimensional computed tomography images than in plain radiography. Two different types of offset of the distal fragment with respect to the proximal fragment are described on three dimensional computed tomography; volar type and dorsal type. In the volar type, the distal fragment overhung in the volar direction relative to the proximal fragment and was frequently accompanied by humpback deformity and axial rotation. In the dorsal type, the distal fragment slipped dorsal on the proximal fragment and was commonly accompanied by humpback deformity. The volar type had a transverse or vertical fracture line on both the volar and dorsal surfaces of the scaphoid, while the dorsal type had a horizontal fracture line. The volar type was frequently found when the fracture was distal, whereas the dorsal type was noted more frequently for proximally located fracture."

Initial examples of fracture diagnosis of peripheral joints in comparison with spiral CT and conventional radiography].,"To analyze a prototype mobile C-arm image amplifier (Iso-C3D) in the evaluation of different joint fractures of the upper and lower limbs using multiplanar reconstruction (MPR). Different cadaver joint specimens (n = 14) were examined with a prototype (Iso-C3D, Siemens AG, Erlangen, Germany), plain radiographs (CR), and spiral computed tomography (CT). The motorized C-arm provides fluoroscopic images during a 190 degrees orbital rotation computing a 119-mm data cube. These three-dimensional data sets yielded MPR images, which were evaluated by two readers for the detection and extent of fracture lines. Initial data show that fractures were easily depicted and correctly classified on MPR images with the Iso-C3D and that there was no difference between the Iso-C and CT in the detection of fractures. The preliminary results suggest a remarkably good detection of joint fractures with the Iso-C3D. Studies in an adequate number of patients are required to elucidate whether these promising results can also be obtained in a clinical setting."

Patients' age, history of previous wrist fracture, presence of MRI signs and ulnar variance were recorded as variables. Also, patients' postoperative strength (compared to the contralateral wrist) and pain relief were collected as outcome measurements. Twenty-two patients (84.6%) had either good or excellent pain relief (median 4, range 1-4). Significant correlation was found between MRI findings and postop pain relief (r = 0.53, p < or = 0.01). History of previous distal radius fractures was negatively correlated with pain relief (r = -0.50, p < or = 0.01). No correlation was found between postop strength and any of the variables. Presence of MRI signs of UIS is a predictor of good outcome in arthroscopic wafer resection."

Thorough clinical and radiographic examination at the initial presentation of the patient is the key to identify uncommon combination of injuries.
CD010023,0,8452713,0,Wrist arthrography.,The ligaments of the proximal row of carpal bones and the triangular fibrocartilage (TFC) strongly influence the function and stability of the wrist. Injury to the ligaments may result in chronic wrist pain or instability. Wrist arthrography is valuable in the investigation of such damage when surgical intervention is considered and plain radiography is unrewarding. There are also several technical modifications of the standard radiocarpal arthrography available. Owing to the possibility of congenital perforations and degenerative changes in these ligaments the arthrographic findings should be related to the clinical signs and the age of the patient. CT has less diagnostic importance in this respect while MR imaging is an alternative and may become the method of choice. Both these methods have great potential in the evaluation of soft tissues of the wrist other than the TFC.

Advantages of the procedure can be demonstrated when assessing pathological changes within the complex three-dimensional structure of the hand and wrist, and in the analysis of articular surfaces. In some cases, fractures and dislocations of the distal radioulnar joint and the carpal bones were missed in conventional radiographs. In cases of scaphoid fracture and nonunion, CT scans give valuable additional information surpassing the possibilities of conventional radiographs. For instance, bone healing after bone grafting can be better evaluated with a CT scan. Furthermore, preoperative planning is simplified, when tumors and cysts of the carpal bones can be located precisely using computed tomography."

Serial MRI studies of the four main patterns showed that each followed a constant sequence during healing and failure to progress normally predicted nonunion.
CD010023,0,20575885,0,Review of imaging of scaphoid fractures.,"Scaphoid fractures are the most common fractures of the carpus, accounting for 79% of all carpal fractures. Early diagnosis of scaphoid fractures is imperative owing to potential complications following the fracture, including non-union, avascular necrosis, carpal instability and osteoarthritis. Plain radiography remains the initial imaging modality to assess scaphoid fractures. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is excellent in the detection of clinically suspected, but initially radiographically negative, scaphoid fractures. Cost-effectiveness analysis studies have demonstrated MRI is effective in this setting. Gadolinium enhanced MRI has been shown to be superior to unenhanced MRI in the detection of avascular necrosis. Computerized tomography scan is the preferred modality to assess the intricacies of scaphoid fracture, including fracture location and deformity, as well as union status. This review paper explores the recent advances in imaging of the scaphoid, with reference also to avascular necrosis and non-union following a scaphoid fracture."

CD010023,0,11089185,0,Cystic lesion in carpal bone.,"Six cases of symptomatic cystic lesions of carpal bones which underwent operative treatment were reviewed. Definite diagnosis, etiology and treatment were also discussed. The lesions occurred in the scaphoid, lunate, capitate and triquetrum, and were multiple lesions in four of the six cases. Juxta-articular bone cyst was diagnosed in three cases: intraosseous cavity surrounded by fibrous membrane containing gelatinous material, and ""bone cyst-like pathologic change"" in three cases which contained fibrous connective tissue resembled the thick inner wall of juxta-articular bone cyst histologically. They were treated by curettage and cancellous bone grafting; the outcomes were favourable without complication. It is suggested that the minor trauma resulting from the carpal loading serves as a basis for intraosseous lesion, which initiates intramedullary metaplasia followed by fibrous connective tissue proliferation with/without mucin secretion, and forms cystic cavity."
CD010023,0,17354814,0,Ultrasound-guided percutaneous scaphoid pinning: operator variability and comparison with traditional fluoroscopic procedure.,"This paper reports on pilot laboratory experiments with a recently proposed surgical procedure for percutaneous screw insertion into fractured scaphoid bones using ultrasound guidance. The experiments were intended to determine the operator variability of the procedure and its performance in comparison with a traditional pinning procedure using fluoroscopy. In the proposed procedure, a three-dimensional surface model is created from pre-operative computed tomography images and intra-operatively registered to the patient using ultrasound images. A graphical interface that communicates with an optical camera tracking the surgical tools, guides the surgeon during the procedure in real time. The results of the experiments revealed non-significant differences between operators for the error in the entry location of the drill hole (p=0.90); however, significant differences for the exit location (p<0.05). Comparison with the traditional pinning procedure shows that the outcome of the recently proposed procedure appears to be more consistent."

Clinical findings are frequently nonspecific until significant progression of the abnormality has occurred. The use of diagnostic imaging techniques early in the discovery period increases the likelihood of establishing an immediate diagnosis and avoids frank fracture of the navicular bone. Delayed diagnosis of navicular stress injuries in athletes can cause dire consequences. The physician must be aware of the injury in establishing a high index of clinical suspicion. The timing and sequencing of diagnostic imaging studies is essential in establishing a diagnosis to manage the patient and minimize time away from competition. This case study examines the history and management of an elite high school track athlete who sustained a navicular stress injury. The timing and use of diagnostic imaging studies is reviewed.

Numerous predisposing factors have been implicated in their development. Within a six-week interval in the summer of 2009, twin brothers, both elite track and field athletes, presented to us with medial foot pain. Plain radiographs were negative but a radioisotope bone scan and CT scan revealed an incomplete navicular fracture in both of them. The fracture was typically located in the proximal dorsal cortex of the central portion of the navicular bone. The presence of such a stress fracture in high performing, monozygotic twins, has never been described. As extrinsic and intrinsic risk factors, their comparability of mechanical stresses and kinematics as well as a genetic predisposition can be put forward. This case report suggests that a complex interaction between mechanical and genetic risk factors exists in the development of navicular stress fractures."

Undetected scaphoid fractures show the importance of accurate primary diagnostic. Evaluation of the anatomic and functional integrity of the ligaments of the wrist remains challenging. It requires great experience, but in any case, radiology remains the basic diagnostic tool used by both the general practitioner and the specialist. Only the use of reproducible imaging techniques will allow for comparison between healthy and pathological side as well as for follow-up. Every one should master and use standardized techniques as described in this paper. The costs bound to appropriate imaging techniques are certainly lower than the consequences of misdiagnosed ligamentous damage or carpal bone fractures.

A higher incidence of US abutment syndrome in the radially deviated US type was observed by dissection. Radiographs taken at varying shoulder abduction angles suggested that the base of the US and ulnar head are not round. To best evaluate the fovea and the US for possible US fractures, radiographs should be taken with the glenohumeral joint abducted 45 degrees, the elbow flexed 90 degrees, the forearm in neutral rotation, and the x-ray beam directed through the wrist perpendicular to the floor."

CD010023,0,1456359,0,Outcome of conservative and surgical management of navicular stress fracture in athletes. Eighty-six cases proven with computerized tomography.,"Eighty-two athletes with 86 clinical navicular stress fractures, all imaged with computerized tomography, were followed for an average of 33 months (range, 6 to 108) after diagnosis. Initial treatment consisted of at least 6 weeks of nonweightbearing cast immobilization for 22 fractures, at least 6 weeks of limitation of activity with continued weightbearing for 34 fractures, and a period of less than 6 weeks of conservative treatment for another 19 fractures. Five patients attempted to continue playing sports. Six patients had immediate surgery. Nineteen of 22 patients (86%) who had initial non-weightbearing cast immobilization treatment returned to sports, compared with only 9 of 34 patients (26%) who initially continued weightbearing with limited activity (P < 0.001). After failure of the latter treatment, successful outcomes were seen for 6 of 7 patients (86%) treated with nonweightbearing cast immobilization, while 11 of 15 patients (73%) who had one surgical procedure were able to return to sports. These results indicate that nonweightbearing cast immobilization is the treatment of choice for navicular stress fractures. Also, this treatment compares favorably with surgical treatment for patients who present after failed weightbearing treatments. Computerized tomographic appearances of healing fractures do not necessarily mirror clinical union, and postimmobilization management should be monitored clinically."
CD010023,0,6224230,0,Tarsal navicular stress fractures: radiographic evaluation.,Tarsal navicular stress fractures are a potential source of disabling foot pain in physically active individuals. The diagnosis of tarsal navicular stress fracture requires a high index of clinical and radiographic suspicion because the fracture is only rarely evident on routine radiographs or standard tomograms. The radiographic diagnosis of a tarsal navicular stress fracture may require anatomic anteroposterior tomograms or a radionuclide bone scan with plantar views. Radiographic examinations of 23 fractures in 21 patients are evaluated.
CD010023,0,15274268,0,MRI and plain radiography in the assessment of displaced fractures of the waist of the carpal scaphoid.,"We treated 50 patients with fractures of the waist of the scaphoid in a below-elbow plaster cast for up to 13 weeks. Displacement of the fragments was assessed independently by two observers using MRI and radiographs performed within two weeks of injury. The MRI assessments showed that only the measurement of sagittal translation of the fragments and an overall assessment of displacement had satisfactory inter- and intra-observer reproducibility and revealed that nine of the 50 fractures were displaced. Only three of the 49 fractures with adequate follow-up failed to unite, and all were displaced with more than 1 mm of translation in the sagittal plane. If the MRI assessment of displacement of the fracture was used as the measurement of choice, assessment of displacement on the initial scaphoid series of radiographs showed a sensitivity of between 33% and 47% and a positive predictive value of between 27% and 86%. Neither observer was able correctly to identify more than 33% to 47% of the displaced fractures from the plain radiographs. Although the overall assessment of displacement and gapping and translation in the coronal plane on the plain radiographs influenced the rate of union, none of these parameters identified all three fractures which failed to unite. We conclude that the assessment of displacement of scaphoid fractures on MRI can probably be used to assess the likelihood of union although the small number of nonunions limits the power of the study. In contrast, the assessment of displacement on routine radiography is inaccurate and of less value in predicting union."

CD010023,0,2964829,1,Skeletal scintigraphy of the wrist in suggested scaphoid fracture.,"Skeletal scintigraphy was performed in 187 patients with clinical suspicion of a scaphoid fracture but with normal radiographic findings. In 85 patients focally moderately (12 patients) or markedly to intensely (73 patients) increased radionuclide uptake was seen, over either the distal radius or carpal bones. A fracture corresponding to markedly increased uptake was eventually verified in 15 out of 26 patients in the distal radius, in 21 out of 28 in the scaphoid but in only 6 out of 18 in other carpal bones. One fracture of the body and one of the hook of the hamate were found, one fracture of the capitate and three of the triquetrum. Not a single fracture was verified in 10 patients with markedly, often intensely, increased activity over the trapezium/trapezoid. It is concluded that scintigraphy is of value in carpal trauma not only to exclude scaphoid fracture but also to direct the attention to the possibility of other carpal fractures, otherwise usually missed."
CD010023,0,18929188,0,Pronated oblique view in assessing proximal scaphoid articular cannulated screw penetration.,Volar and percutaneous techniques of screw fixation for scaphoid fractures usually do not involve direct visualization of the dorsoproximal scaphoid articular surface. Intra-articular screw penetration may be overlooked if the proper fluoroscopic views are not obtained. The hypothesis of this study is that the pronated oblique fluoroscopic view of the scaphoid is the most sensitive in detecting dorsal articular screw penetration of the scaphoid when compared with other views.
CD010023,0,19043131,0,The use of a vascularised periosteal patch onlay graft in the management of nonunion of the proximal scaphoid.,"We describe the use of a vascularised periosteal patch onlay graft based on the 1,2 intercompartmental supraretinacular artery in the management of 11 patients (ten men, one woman) with chronic nonunion involving the proximal third of the scaphoid. The mean age of the patients was 31 years (21 to 45) with the dominant hand affected in eight. Six of the patients were smokers and three had undergone previous surgery to the scaphoid. All of the proximal fragments were avascular. The presence of union was assessed using longitudinal axis CT. Only three patients progressed to union of the scaphoid and four required a salvage operation for a symptomatic nonunion. The remaining four patients with a persistent nonunion are asymptomatic with low pain scores, good grip strength and a functional range of wrist movement. Although this technique has potential technical advantages over vascularised pedicled bone grafting, the rate of union has been disappointing and we do not recommend it as a method of treatment."
CD010023,0,2688677,0,CT of the wrist for the evaluation of traumatic injuries.,"Computed tomography (CT) of the wrist can help evaluate many types of posttraumatic injuries, particularly bony trauma. Most wrist fractures can be diagnosed with routine radiography, but problematic cases and complicated healing fractures can be difficult to evaluate with conventional radiography. CT provides improved contrast resolution and multiplanar imaging. The results of complex healing fractures and fusion procedures can be facilitated with CT. Even in the face of advanced osteoporosis CT can delineate bone edges and detect small areas of bony fusion. The degree of bone graft assimilation can be determined with CT. Unlike conventional radiography, metal fixation pins and cast material do not obviate diagnostic exams with CT. Certain posttraumatic complications such as distal radioulnar joint incongruity and hypertrophy of Lister's tubercle can be detected with axial CT images. Complicated cases of retained foreign bodies can be evaluated with CT. The high-contrast resolution of CT allows precise localization of foreign bodies and can define anatomic relationships to adjacent vital structures such as joints, tendons, and carpal tunnel. Postarthrography CT of the wrist is an investigational tool that permits direct visualization of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC). Complete and partial tears of the TFCC can be evaluated with postarthrography CT. Ulnar capsular tears and disruptions of interosseous ligaments can also be evaluated with this technique. The exact role of postarthrography CT of the wrist, however, is uncertain at this point. Three-dimensional CT is receiving increasing interest and may eventually help the understanding of wrist pathomechanics and kinematics. In summary, CT of the wrist can be instrumental in evaluating complicated posttraumatic injuries of the wrist and has certain advantages over routine radiography."
CD010023,0,15948438,0,Current perspectives in the management of scaphoid nonunions.,"When left untreated, scaphoid fractures follow a downward spiral resulting in carpal collapse and arthritis. The purpose of intervention is to allow a cartilage-wrapped bone to heal and maintain a smooth articular surface. Proposed treatment options for scaphoid nonunions have varied success rates. Using the Mack-Lichtman classification for nonunions, a plan can be formulated for individual patients based on motion loss, degenerative changes, carpal collapse, and fracture instability manifested by bone loss. Stable nonunions may benefit from bone grafting and internal fixation. Unstable nonunions require grafting and fixation. With the development of arthritis, grafting and fixation must be weighed against suitability of a proximal row carpectomy or a four-corner fusion with scaphoid excision. Advanced carpal collapse and arthritis mandates fusion, either limited or complete. CT allows preoperative planning to assess grafting requirements. MRI defines vascular supply fa vascular graft is considered. Vascularized graft options have multiplied as attention has been focused on the impact of improved blood supply on the avascular scaphoid. Patient- and fracture-specific factors are important considerations when determining surgical options; underestimating their importance can compromise surgical results even with a high level of technical skill. Successful treatment of scaphoid nonunions remains a difficult challenge despite improvement in fixation devices and surgical options. By regarding injury status together with patient factors, surgical options can be narrowed and patient expectations managed more realistically."

Because of the poor prognosis of conventional bone grafts, a vascularized bone graft is recommended as the primary treatment when AVN is present. The volar collapse of the humpback deformity is best corrected with a volar approach and the proximal pole nonunion is best approached using a dorsal approach. Nearly all proximal pole nonunions require a vascularized bone graft and all acute proximal pole fractures require open reduction and internal fixation. Using specially designed cannulated screws, the nonunions can be stabilized accurately to decrease the time to resolution of the nonunion and minimize the amount of time in a cast. Stable fixation requires that the screw fixation target the central portion of the scaphoid regardless of the type of screw design used. Using these techniques, the hand surgeon should be able to provide a reasonable prognosis for patients presenting with a scaphoid nonunion, and the treatment should result in functional range of motion, grip strength, and relief of pain."
CD010023,0,3714271,0,[Fractures and dislocation fractures of the wrist joint].,"Most carpal fractures are based on the same injury mechanism. In most cases the injury is caused by a fall on the dorsiflexed hand, which is raised as a protective measure, and less frequently by a fall on the clenched fist. The latter leads to passive palmar flexion, pronation and radial inclination of the hand; in the former, the hand is passively superextended by the impact, supinated, and brought into ulnar inclination. The instability caused by injury to various articular structures has four developmental stages. The bones or syndesmoses that are involved depend on the stage and quantitative relationship between the three above-mentioned moments of force. If the lateral ligament of the wrist is slack, scaphoid fractures occur; in the last stage of superextension, fractures of the capitate bone occur. With increasing ulnar inclination, perilunar dislocations or fracture-dislocations and triquetrum fractures occur in the third stage and dislocations of the semilunar bone in the fourth stage. In addition, compression and avulsion of the 1st, 4th or 5th metacarpal bones cause fractures of the trapezium and the hamate bone. To avoid unpleasant late sequels, scaphoid fractures with diastasis due to soft tissue interposition or non-reducible dislocated scaphoid fractures must be treated surgically. Vertical oblique fractures and scaphoid fractures with small proximal fragments are relatively good indications for operation. Perilunar instability and dislocations, particularly De Quervain's fracture-dislocations, must be treated operatively because reduction of the scaphoid bone requires a different approach than correcting alignment in the carpus and because soft tissue interpositions are always present, even though they may not be evident in the X-ray pictures. Fracture-dislocations in the distal carpal row also require operation, preferably percutaneous internal fixation using K-wire and fluoroscopy. Immobilization is accomplished by a below-elbow cast with a dorsal plaster splint up to the interdigital webs and from the palmar to the proximal crease. The thumb is only embedded in trapezium fractures; fractures requiring fist or above-elbow casts are indications for operation."
CD010023,0,2584501,0,Forty degree angled coronal CT scanning of scaphoid fractures through plaster and fiberglass casts.,"A method for obtaining coronal CT scans angled 40 degrees to the longitudinal axis of the wrist, parallel to the long axis of the scaphoid, is described. Its potential for evaluating scaphoid fractures is assessed in 10 patients with healing or clinically suspected fractures. Overlapping 3 mm thick angled coronal CT scans were obtained for each patient both in and out of cast. The CT images were compared to plain films and tomography. Comparisons were also made of CT images obtained through fiberglass and plaster casts. All fractures apparent by plain films and tomography were apparent by CT; one case suspected of fracture on initial plain films showed no evidence of fracture on CT and subsequent clinical course and plain films. Osseous union of healing fractures was more reliably assessed on CT than on plain films and plain film tomography. There was no degradation of CT images by either fiberglass or plaster casts; fiberglass casts allowed easy planning of tomographic slices from scout films. We conclude that direct 40 degree angled coronal CT examination of the scaphoid is a quick reliable method to detect scaphoid fractures and to assess their healing without the need of cast removal."
CD010023,0,11347841,0,Kinematics of the wrist with a new dynamic external fixation device.,"The kinematic properties of a new dynamic external fixator device for treatment of distal radial fractures are described. Using a combination of data obtained from computed tomography scans and high-speed video images, a three-dimensional reconstruction of carpal motion was made. To describe carpal motion, the radiolunate, capitolunate, and scapholunate angles were measured during flexion and extension and during radioulnar deviation. During these types of motion, the device changed normal carpal kinematics to a limited extent although the differences in kinematic pattern with and without the device were small. The results for flexion and extension correspond with data from previously published studies with other dynamic external fixators. However, because the new device (Flexafix) allows flexion and extension and radioulnar deviation, in contrast to other dynamic external fixation devices, with its use normal carpal kinematics can be approached more closely."

CD010023,0,16324982,0,Upper extremity stress fractures.,"Although less common than lower-extremity stress fractures, upper-extremity stress fractures are becoming recognized much more frequently. A majority of these fractures are caused by overuse and fatigue of the surrounding musculature and, as a result, may be prevented by appropriate training and conditioning. Diagnosis is made by history and physical examination with the aid of plain radiographs, bone scans, and MRI. Most of these fractures heal with a period of relative rest followed by a structured rehabilitation program. A small percentage of these fractures, however, may require surgical fixation. The present article reviews the different types of upper extremity and torso stress fractures seen in athletes, starting with the sternum and extending outward to the fingers. The presentation, diagnosis, mechanism of injury, treatment, prevention, and prognosis for each of these injuries will be discussed."

CD010023,0,2405337,0,Magnetic resonance imaging of injuries to bone and articular cartilage. Emphasis on radiographically occult abnormalities.,"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has emerged as the premier noninvasive imaging method for evaluation of the musculoskeletal system. Among the most widely recognized and accepted applications of MRI is that of trauma-related imaging. While the initial emphasis on MRI was directed toward the assessment of soft-tissue structures previously difficult to image (eg, knee menisci and cruciate ligaments), it has become increasingly apparent that MRI is superbly suited to the depiction of a wide spectrum of injuries to bone and articular cartilage. MRI has proved capable of depicting abnormalities ranging from clinically innocuous bone bruises to posttraumatic osteonecrosis. Many of the abnormalities that have been detected by MRI have been radiographically occult and often clinically unsuspected. MRI has become established in the assessment of chondral and osteochondral injuries, insufficiency and stress fractures, occult proximal femoral fractures, tibial plateau fractures, and scaphoid injuries. This review will attempt to present the current state of the art with respect to the application of MRI to the assessment of injuries to bone and articular cartilage. Particular emphasis will be placed on radiographically occult abnormalities."
CD010023,0,16149035,0,[Scaphoid fractures--operative or conservative treatment? A CT-based classification].,"Traditionally acute scaphoid fractures were treated by immobilization. As a consequence we have to deal with a high number of scaphoid non-unions or SNAC wrists. A study of 30 patients with scaphoid non-union showed that only 30% (9 patients) have not seen a doctor, while the majority of the patients (70%, 21 patients) were treated by a physician after trauma. In 15 (71.4%) of these 21 patients a missed diagnosis and in 6 (28.6%) a failed conservative treatment of the scaphoid fracture were the reasons for scaphoid non-union. Therefore, improvements in the diagnosis and therapy of scaphoid fractures are urgently needed. Herbert's classification of scaphoid fractures provides the underlying rationale for treatment according to the fracture type seen on X-ray. Differentiation between stable and unstable fractures sometimes is difficult from conventional X-rays. In these cases we recommend a CT bone scan in the long axis of the scaphoid. According to the CT scan we modified Herbert's classification: undisplaced waist fractures are classified as stable and can be treated conservatively or can be stabilized percutaneously using minimally invasive procedures. Comminuted or displaced fractures are classified as unstable and need operative treatment because of the increased risk of scaphoid non-union after plaster immobilization. Fractures of the proximal pole of the scaphoid should be treated operatively by internal fixation, even if they are not displaced, because of the reduced perfusion. We recommend a CT scan of the scaphoid, if there is any doubt about the diagnosis or the stability of the scaphoid fracture. In any case, a CT scan has to be ordered to justify a conservative treatment."
CD010023,0,18420064,0,[Bulge of the scapholunate ligament: an arthro-CT sign of traumatic scapholunate instability].,"Tears of the scapholunate ligament are usually diagnosed during an arthro-CT or arthro-MRI examination. Typically, the contrast agent passes from one joint to the other. In certain cases, fibrous scar tissue devoid of any mechanical effect may block the passage and lead to an erroneous interpretation of the images. We reviewed retrospectively patients who underwent arthroscopic treatment for scapholunate tears and who had normal arthro-CT images. We searched for specific aspects suggestive of ligament injury. Analysis of the arthro-CT images demonstrated that a bulge of the scapholunate ligament could be noted in patients whose diagnosis of scapholunate ligament injury was established arthroscopically. We propose that appropriate lecture of wrist images can identify scapholunate ligament injury in patients wrongly considered to be free of wrist injury, but who actually have an occult injury to the scapholunate ligament."

Regardless of the underlying etiology, physeal bridges may cause angular and/or longitudinal growth disturbances, with progression dependent on the remaining physeal growth potential. Physeal bridge resection and insertion of interposition material releases the tethering effect of the bridge. Physeal bridge resection has become an accepted treatment option for patients with existing or developing deformity and for those with at least 2 years or 2 cm of growth remaining. Current experimental research is focused on the use of gene therapy and other factors that enhance chondrocyte proliferation to improve the management of growth arrest.

CD010023,0,21885701,0,Perilunate dislocation and perilunate fracture-dislocation.,"Perilunate dislocations and perilunate fracture-dislocations usually result from high-energy traumatic injuries to the wrist and are associated with a characteristic spectrum of bony and ligamentous damage. Radiographic evaluation of the wrist reveals loss of normal radiocarpal and intercarpal colinearity and bony insult, which may be overlooked at the initial presentation. Prompt recognition is important to optimize outcomes. Closed reduction is performed acutely, followed by open reduction and ligamentous and bony repair with internal fixation. Complications include posttraumatic arthrosis, median nerve dysfunction, complex regional pain syndrome, tendon problems, and carpal instability. Despite appropriate treatment, loss of wrist motion and grip strength, as well as persistent pain, is common. Medium- and long-term studies demonstrate radiographic evidence of midcarpal and radiocarpal arthrosis, although this does not correlate with functional outcomes."

CD010023,0,17533093,0,Case studies in the diagnosis of upper extremity pain using magnetic resonance imaging.,"The diagnosis of upper extremity pain can be a daunting task for the examining physician. The differential diagnosis for pain at each level in the upper extremity is often extensive and diverse. Quite frequently, the clinical signs and symptoms of multiple pathologic conditions are overlapping and nonspecific. The decision to treat conservatively or with surgery often depends on the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings. MRI's ability to produce multiplanar images with excellent soft tissue contrast has made it an indispensable tool for diagnosis and treatment planning in patients with upper extremity pain. In most instances, MR imaging provides information that all other modalities cannot. This is all possible due to an incredible imaging device that creates magnificent images painlessly and with no known detrimental biological side effects. This article demonstrates only a small number of the possible causes of upper extremity pain that can be diagnosed with MR imaging. It is comforting to know that the vast majority of pathology causing pain in the upper extremity can be visualized with MRI scanning."

Radiographic, scintigraphic, and clinical assessments were performed throughout the follow-up period of 24 months. OP-1 improved the performance of both autologous and allogenic bone implants and reduced radiographic healing time to 4 weeks compared with 9 weeks in group 1. Helical CT scans and scintigraphy showed that in OP-1-treated patients sclerotic bone was replaced by well-vascularised bone. The addition of OP-1 to allogenic bone implant equalised the clinical outcome with the autologous graft procedure. Consequently the harvesting of autologous graft can be avoided."
CD010023,0,7211295,0,Fracture of the carpal scaphoid in children. A clinical and roentgenological study of 108 cases.,"A series of 108 carpal scaphoid fractures in children was analysed with respect to the site, type and treatment of the fracture. The patients were followed until radiological fusion occurred. All fractures united and healed completely with conservative treatment. Ninety-four fractures, 41 of which were avulsions, were located in the distal third of the scaphoid. There were 13 waist fractures, and one avulsion fracture was located in the proximal pole of the scaphoid. The great number of avulsion fractures and the location of the fractures in the distal third of the scaphoid is very typical in children. In three neglected cases marked bone resorption was seen on the fracture surface 3 weeks after the injury. Because non-union is possible especially in neglected cases of waist fractures, control radiographs should be taken 1 or 2 weeks after the injury if the fracture is not visible on the primary radiographs but is suspected clinically. Immobilization with an adequate plaster cast is mandatory in all transverse fractures of the carpal scaphoid in children."
CD010023,0,15354754,0,[Nutcracker fractures of the navicular and cuboid].,"Nutcracker fractures of the tarsal navicular and cuboid usually result from dislocations of the midtarsal (Chopart's) joint. The classic pathomechanism consists of forced adduction or abduction (medial or lateral stress) mostly in combination with axial force. The resulting injuries are frequently misjudged or underestimated with respect to their potential consequences for global foot function. Radiographic imaging includes plain radiographs in exact standard projections and computed tomographic scanning. Classification of Chopart fracture-dislocations is based on the proposed pathomechanics and the direction of the dislocating force. The goals of open reduction and stable internal fixation of Chopart fracture-dislocations are realignment of the medial and lateral columns of the foot, restoration of joint congruity and temporal transfixation in case of ligamentous instability to ensure proper ligament healing."
CD010023,0,1940172,0,Computed analyses of the pathomechanics of scaphoid waist nonunions.,"The computed tomography scans of both the injured and the normal wrists of nine patients with a scaphoid nonunion of 5 to 120 months' duration were used to create three-dimensional computer models. When the computer images of the normal and the contralateral fractured scaphoids were superimposed, it was possible to calculate the volume of bone that was lost as a result of the injury and its failure to heal, as well as the angular relationship of the fracture components to one another. The amount of the scaphoid bone that was lost varied from 6% to 15% of bone volume and did not show a linear correlation with the duration of the nonunion. The configuration of the missing bone was consistent and exhibited a prismatic shape whose base is quadrilateral and faces palmarly. The proximal scaphoid fracture component is extended, radially deviated, and supinated in relation to its distal fracture component. The consistent fracture deformity and the configuration of the bony defect in the scaphoid waist nonunions should be helpful in the understanding and treatment of the condition."
CD010023,0,17414993,0,Stress fractures in athletes.,"A stress fracture is a partial or complete bone fracture that results from repeated application of stress lower than the stress required to fracture the bone in a single loading. Otherwise healthy athletes, especially runners, sustain stress injuries or fractures. Prevention or early intervention is the preferable treatment. However, it is difficult to predict injury because runners vary with regard to biomechanical predisposition, training methods, and other factors such as diet, muscle strength, and flexibility. Stress fractures account for 0.7% to 20% of all sports medicine clinic injuries. Track-and-field athletes have the highest incidence of stress fractures compared with other athletes. Stress fractures of the tibia, metatarsals, and fibula are the most frequently reported sites. The sites of stress fractures vary from sport to sport (eg, among track athletes, stress fractures of the navicular, tibia, and metatarsal are common; in distance runners, it is the tibia and fibula; in dancers, the metatarsals). In the military, the calcaneus and metatarsals were the most commonly cited injuries, especially in new recruits, owing to the sudden increase in running and marching without adequate preparation. However, newer studies from the military show the incidence and distribution of stress fractures to be similar to those found in sports clinics. Fractures of the upper extremities are relatively rare, although most studies have focused only on lower-extremity injuries. The ulna is the upper-extremity bone injured most frequently. Imaging plays a key role in the diagnosis and management of stress injuries. Plain radiography is useful when positive, but generally has low sensitivity. Radionuclide bone scanning is highly sensitive, but lacks specificity and the ability to directly visualize fracture lines. In this article, we focus on magnetic resonance imaging, which provides highly sensitive and specific evaluation for bone marrow edema, periosteal reaction as well as detection of subtle fracture lines."

Thus, bone density has been considered as a most reliable parameter to assess osteoporotic fracture risk. In past decades, by the way, bone texture measures have been studied to estimate other aspect of bone quality. Some studies have been performed on CT or MR images to assess bone quality using trabecular structure analysis. Other studies have been performed on plain x-ray images or ultrasound images to assess trabecular structure. However, most of the studies are focused on individual parameters to distinguish between osteoporotic fractured group and nonfractured group. In this preliminary study, we combine various texture parameters with bone density parameters using a support vector machine and point out the most promising combination of parameters to distinguish between osteoporotic fractured group and nonfractured group."

Current high-field-strength MR systems offer particular advantages for diagnostic imaging of the small joints of the extremities, especially the wrists, where multiple overlapping soft-tissue structures may be visually inseparable at lower field strengths because of limited contrast resolution. Diagnostic accuracy obtained with 3-T MR imaging of the wrist performed with an acquisition protocol that includes three-dimensional and proton density-weighted imaging sequences is nearly commensurate with that obtained with MR arthrography. Abnormalities of the ligaments, tendons, cartilage, nerves, blood vessels, and bone are clearly depicted, allowing accurate characterization of perforations, tears, and fractures, as well as various soft-tissue and intraosseous lesions (eg, ganglion cysts), vascular malformations, aneurysms, and neuropathies."

Solid union of fracture is determined by CT scan. We identified 126 acute injuries, including 65 proximal pole fractures; 67 grossly displaced fractures; 12 trans-scaphoid perilunate dislocations including four trans-scaphoid trans-capitate fractures; and ten combined scaphoid and distal radius fractures. 108 scaphoid nonunions were identified. 98 were correctly aligned and ten had a humpback deformity which was correctable using arthroscopic assisted reduction techniques at the time of surgery. 82 presented with a fracture gap 2mm or greater requiring percutaneous bone grafting. 12 cases of avascular necrosis (AVN) were identified by MRI. 20 nonunions had surgery performed at other institutions. The mean time to surgery for the nonunions was 20 months. 99% union rate of acute scaphoid fractures was obtained by 12 weeks, as determined by CT scan. Two complications were identified (3%). One case of delayed healing was identified. this delayed union was treated with percutaneous bone grafting and continued on to heal uneventfully. The other complication was a case of volar trans-scaphoid peri-lunate dislocation. While the fracture healed, the patient developed a traumatic dislocation requiring a capitate-lunate arthrodesis. Treatment of scaphoid nonunions resulted in ten cases of delayed healing, which were treated with repeat percutaneous bone grafting. This represented a 9% complication rate. of the ten cases of delayed unions that were re-bone grafted, four failed to heal by nine months. This resulted in a 96% union rate of our nonunion group by nine months. when acute fracture healing was compared to nonunions the average healing of acute fractures as determined by CT scanning measuring trabecular bridging was 12 weeks, while the average healing of non-unions was 22 weeks. We conclude that the dorsal percutaneous treatment of scaphoid fractures and nonunions using arthroscopy is safe and effective. CT scans to evaluate scaphoid healing by measuring trabecular bridging at the fracture site was determined to be an excellent modality to evaluate scaphoid healing. While not witnessed in this series, the potential for complications requires proper training."
CD010023,0,9454275,1,[MRI in radiologically occult scaphoid fractures. Initial experiences with 1.0 Tesla (whole body-middle field equipment) versus 0.2 Tesla (dedicated low-field equipment)].,"The study was performed to determine the diagnostic value of different MR systems and field strengths in patients with occult scaphoid and wrist fractures. Twelve patients with clinical suspicion of a scaphoid fracture but normal plain radiographs were examined by MRI. A dedicated 0.2-T unit (Esaote) and a 1.0-T unit (NT10, Philips) were used. Coronal T1W-SE, STIR, and T2*W-GE sequences were obtained with both systems. Images were evaluated for a bone marrow abnormality, a trabecular or cortical fracture line, and were compared to the 6-week follow-up radiographs. Seven wrist fractures were found at 0.2 T and 1.0 T, proven in the follow-up radiographs. A bone marrow abnormality was present in all seven fractures on both systems. Trabecular and cortical fracture lines were visualized at 0.2 T in four cases and at 1.0 T in seven cases. Low-field MR imaging at 0.2 T and mid-field MR imaging at 1.0 T seem to be equivalent in the diagnosis of a fracture in radiographically occult scaphoid and wrist fractures. In the visualization of fracture details, important for therapeutic and prognostic considerations, 1.0 T seems to be superior."

This ligament consists of two slips that originate from the radiopalmar aspect of the scaphoid tuberosity and extend distally, forming a V shape. The ulnar fibers, which are just radial to the flexor carpi radialis sheath, inserted along the trapezial ridge. The radial fibers were found to be thinner and inserted at the radial aspect of the trapezium. Twelve fresh cadaver wrists were dissected, with close attention paid to the scaphotrapezio-trapezoidal (STT) joint. An osseoligamentous specimen was dissected with removal of all musculotendinous structures around the STT joint and was performed with high-resolution acquisition in a 128-MDCT scanner. Samples of the wrist area were collected from two fetal specimens. A retrospective study of 55 patients with wrist pain that were submitted to arthrography, arthro-CT, and arthro-MRI imaging was performed (10 patients on a 3-T superconducting magnet and 45 patients on a 1.5-T system). Another ten patients had high-resolution images on a 3-T superconducting magnet without arthrographic injection. MR arthrography and arthro-CT improved visualization and provided detailed information about the anatomy of the scaphotrapezial ligament. Knowledge of the appearance of this normal ligament on MRI allows accurate diagnosis of lesions and will aid when surgery is indicated or may have a role in avoiding unnecessary immobilization."

CD010023,0,10811757,0,Scaphoid nonunions: a 3-dimensional analysis of patterns of deformity.,"We tested the hypothesis that the fracture location of scaphoid nonunions relates to the fracture displacement, development of dorsal intercalated segment instability (DISI) deformity, and changes in the contact area of the bones in the radiocarpal joint. Eleven patients with scaphoid nonunions were examined with 3-dimensional computed tomography and a new method of proximity mapping. Two different patterns of displacement of scaphoid nonunions were demonstrated, 1 volar and 1 dorsal. All patients with a volar pattern scaphoid nonunion had a DISI deformity. Only a few of the patients with a dorsal pattern scaphoid nonunion, mostly in longstanding nonunions, had a DISI deformity. The fracture line was generally distal to the dorsal apex of the ridge of the scaphoid in the volar-type fractures and proximal in the dorsal displaced fractures. The proximity map of the distal fragment of the scaphoid on the radius in the volar type shifts radial compared with normal; in the distal type it shifts dorsal. Neither of the patterns showed any significant changes of the proximity map in the radiocarpal joint at the proximal scaphoid fragment and the lunate. Whether the fracture line passes distal or proximal to the dorsal apex of the ridge of the scaphoid appears to determine the likelihood of subsequent fracture displacement, DISI deformity, and contact area of the bones in the radiocarpal joint."
CD010023,0,15757776,0,Physical examination of the carpal bones by orthopaedic and accident and emergency surgeons.,"Our aim was to test knowledge of carpal bone surface anatomy among orthopaedic and accident and emergency surgeons.

Five of the remaining 50 correctly palpated all surface markings. Six failed to accurately palpate even a single point. The scaphoid waist and trapezial ridge were accurately palpated by 47 surgeons. The median score for all participants was 3 correctly identified points. The majority of orthopaedic and accident and emergency surgeons do not perform an accurate physical examination of the carpal bones.

However, there has been more criticism recently, since this method neither prevents nor stops arthrosis of the wrist in the long term. Ligamental damage with carpal instability often remains untreated. The malposition and shortening of the scaphoid bone also remains uncorrected. Fifty-five patients in who Matti-Russe reconstruction was carried out to treat schaphoid non-union were followed up. The inclusion criteria were that there had been no preoperative arthrosis and no previous operations. The mean period of observation was 10.7 years. The results of the clinical and radiological investigation were compared with the preoperative findings; in addition, there was a control group with untreated scaphoid non-union. It was shown that arthrosis is demonstrable in 69% of the operated patients; in the unoperated patients, this was the case in 95%. Carpal instability was present in 47.1% of the operated patients. However, it does not affect the development of arthrosis. The time interval between accident and operation is crucial for this. The results of this investigation indicate that scaphoid non-union should be treated as soon as possible even if it is asymptomatic."

Conventional radiography plays a central role in the wrist injuries but the diffusion of more sensitive methodics offers new possibilities. Our purpose is to evaluate the role of computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance (MR) and arthrography in wrist trauma. We retrospectively examined the images of 45 patients with wrist injuries: in every patients a radiological examination in 4 standard projections was executed while in 25, 9 and 11 patients CT,MR and arthrography were performed. On the basis of our findings we think that conventional radiography is often sufficient for diagnosis of bone lesions even if CT sometimes is required to detect subtle fractures. MR has an high sensitivity not only for abnormalities of soft tissues, including interosseous ligaments and triangular fibrocartilage, but also bony abnormalities such as occult fractures and early osteonecrosis. Arthrography still remains the best procedure for evaluating lesions of triangular fibrocartilage and intercarpal ligaments especially in a preoperative phase."

A blind clinical assessment was made and the Patient Evaluation Measure (PEM) and DASH questionnaires were completed by all the patients 1 year after injury. The group consisted of 38 men and four women with a mean age of 31 years at the time of injury.

CD010023,0,22733954,0,Predictors of fracture following suspected injury to the scaphoid.,"A prospective study was performed to develop a clinical prediction rule that incorporated demographic and clinical factors predictive of a fracture of the scaphoid. Of 260 consecutive patients with a clinically suspected or radiologically confirmed scaphoid fracture, 223 returned for evaluation two weeks after injury and formed the basis of our analysis. Patients were evaluated within 72 hours of injury and at approximately two and six weeks after injury using clinical assessment and standard radiographs. Demographic data and the results of seven specific tests in the clinical examination were recorded. There were 116 (52%) men and their mean age was 33 years (13 to 95; SD 17.9). In 62 patients (28%) a scaphoid fracture was confirmed. A logistic regression model identified male gender (p = 0.002), sports injury (p = 0.004), anatomical snuff box pain on ulnar deviation of the wrist within 72 hours of injury (p < 0.001), and scaphoid tubercle tenderness at two weeks (p < 0.001) as independent predictors of fracture. All patients with no pain at the anatomical snuff box on ulnar deviation of the wrist within 72 hours of injury did not have a fracture (n = 72, 32%). With four independently significant factors positive, the risk of fracture was 91%. Our study has demonstrated that clinical prediction rules have a considerable influence on the probability of a suspected scaphoid fracture. This will help improve the use of supplementary investigations where the diagnosis remains in doubt."

A preferred source of bone graft for scaphoid grafting is the iliac crest. Donor site morbidity from iliac crest harvest, however, is a known complication, and the comparable strength and osteogenic properties of bone harvested from other sites are unclear. To this end, we have conducted a cadaveric comparative investigation of the strength of scaphoid nonunions with bone graft and internal fixation using either iliac crest bone or distal radius bone."

A similar injury is found in the knee, considered benign and managed conservatively. In the scaphoid, there is the concern that this lesion may lead to scaphoid non-union. This study addresses that concern. The clinical and radiological findings of 41 patients with a scaphoid bone bruise on MRI are described, an MRI classification system proposed and clinical outcomes investigated. Patients were immobilised for 6 weeks. At 3 months, 8 remained symptomatic and had repeat MRI. Four of these showed complete resolution of the bruise, the others improvement. At 6 months, 2 of the 8 complained of minor, intermittent discomfort but progressed to resolution of symptoms. This study suggests that the scaphoid bone bruise is a benign injury with predictable recovery and is unlikely to result in long-term morbidity in the form of non-union."
CD010023,0,7531477,0,"The palmar wrist ligaments revisited, clinical relevance.","In fifteen cadaver wrists and ten foetus wrists palmar ligaments were studied. As a result, the palmar scapho-triquetral ligament was presented by means of gross anatomical study, MR imaging, and histological study. A kinematic study was conducted on three cadaver wrists to analyze patterns of motion on the proximal carpal row bones based on the helical axis concept. Motion analysis showed that the scaphoid has a set of helical axes bundled at the radial side of the wrist. On the contrary, the triquetrum had axes bundled on the ulnar side, approximately in the same position as the lunate. That shows that the lunate and triquetrum are coordinated in motion and opposed to that of the scaphoid. The structure possibly ruling this pattern of motion could be the palmar scapho-triquetral ligament, whose insertions on the scaphoid and triquetrum are close to the crossing-point of the helical axes of the scaphoid and triquetrum/lunate, respectively. In order to study the clinical relevance of our findings, a prospective clinical study on 53 patients after wrist injury was conducted. All patients were clinically examined, simple and semi-stress X-rays were taken, and arthrography and arthroscopy performed. Ligament tears were often found, but any correlation to clinical findings or arthrography could not be found. However, high correlation could be found between the lesion of the palmar scapho-triquetral ligament and a DISI position of the lunate combined with increased scapho-lunate angle. It can be concluded that the tear of the palmar scapho-triquetral ligament causes instability pattern that is radiologically evident at an early stage.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Three-dimensional reformation is an effective method of translating conventional computed tomographic scans into a readily understood three-dimensional image. We believe that the method will be of increasing value in the evaluation of pediatric skeletal pathology.

Follow-up ranged from 1 to 5 years (between January 1995 and January 2000). Radiographs and computed tomography (CT) scans were analyzed for confirmation of osseous union. The average period of clinical and radiologic union was 13.2 weeks (range, 10 to 33 weeks).

The mean age of the patients was 32 years (23 to 46) and the dominant wrist was affected in 14. The mean interval from fracture to the vascularised bone grafting was 39 months (9 to 62). Pre-operative MRI showed no contrast enhancement in the proximal fragment in any patient. Fracture union was assessed radiologically or with CT scans if the radiological appearances were inconclusive. At a mean follow-up of 5.6 years (2 to 11) union was obtained in 16 patients. The remaining five patients with a persistent nonunion continued to experience pain, reduced grip strength and limited range of wrist movement. In the successfully treated patients the grip strength and range of movement did not recover to match the uninjured side. Prevention of progressive carpal collapse, the absence of donor site morbidity, good subjective results and pain relief, justifies this procedure in the treatment of recalcitrant nonunion of the scaphoid."

Treatment is particular to each fracture. Nondisplaced fractures should be treated nonoperatively. For intra-articular carpal bone fractures, virtually any amount of displacement is unacceptable and requires reduction and fixation.

In three patients the scan showed a focal area of decreased radionuclide concentration in the region of the proximal pole of scaphoid implying avascularity, and each developed the radiographic signs of avascular necrosis. Two of these patients, each with a displaced fracture, developed non-union. Acute fractures of the scaphoid with evidence of avascularity on bone scan are at high risk of developing non-union."

CD010023,0,9131939,0,[Fractures of the wrist with cartilage rupture in young adults. Apropos of 18 cases].,"Distal radius impaction fractures are not rare. They present a dual problem for the surgeon: the difficulty of establishing the exact pathological anatomy of the fracture, and of obtaining stable anatomic reduction. The authors report their experience of 18 distal radius impaction fractures in young patients after violent trauma (motor vehicle accident). We subdivided these fractures using Kapandji and Müller's classifications: 12 type 9 or C3, 4 type 5 or B1 and 2 type 4 or C1. The mean depth of impaction of the scaphoid fossa or lunate fossa (""die punch fracture""), or centrally was measured at 5 mm on preop X-rays or on CT scan. After radiographs of the wrist in traction under anaesthesia, open reduction was performed in 14 cases (78%). A volar approach with plate fixation was performed in 3 cases. A dorsal approach with internal fixation with k-wires and an external fixator was performed in the other 11 cases. A bone graft was necessary in 10 cases when the bone defect was significant. The four remaining patients were treated with percutaneous k-wires and external fixation. We reviewed these 18 patients after a mean follow-up of 27 months. The mean age at the time of the accident was 37 years. The results were graded on the Green and O'Brien scale. Results were excellent in 1 case, good in 11 cases, fair in 5 cases, and poor in 1 case. We believe that impaction fractures always require open reduction with or without the addition of bone graft depending on the degree of the impaction. This is because of the risk of arthritic degeneration with this kind of fracture, with articular incongruence (more than 2 mm), and with chondral injuries on the radial or the carpal aspect of the wrist joint. Also, when there is a distal radio-ulnar joint injury (D.R.U.J. dislocation or distal head ulna fracture), the joint must always be stabilized to avoid secondary displacement."

High-resolution MR imaging was performed on a 1.5-T unit (Symphony Quantum, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) using coronal and axial T1- and T2-weighted fat-saturated turbo-spin-echo sequence via a dedicated wrist coil within a mean of 6.6 days after initial radiographs in 54 patients (56 wrists) with clinical suspicion of wrist fractures and normal plain or indistinct radiographs. Initial radiographs were evaluated independently by two senior radiologists and the hand surgeon without knowledge of the MRI findings. The initial treatment protocol was based on evaluation of plain films and clinical findings by the hand surgeon. Treatment protocol was changed after MRI examination if necessary. In 31 of 56 wrists MRI findings resulted in a change of diagnosis. There were false-positive diagnoses on plain radiographs in nearly one half ( n=25) of the patients. False-negative diagnoses on plain radiographs resulted in 6 cases. Magnetic resonance imaging detected additional injuries of soft tissue in more than one third ( n=20). In 22 of 56 wrists the period of immobilization could be shortened or ended, in 12 of 56 it was prolonged, and in 3 of 56 a surgical intervention was necessary. In 19 wrists MRI had no therapeutic consequences. Our data demonstrate the high clinical impact of MRI in the detection of acute wrist fractures. We recommend MRI of the wrist immediately on the day of trauma if there is clinical suspicion and normal plain radiographs. Accurate diagnosis by MRI examination within the first days following trauma may reduce economic costs due to shortened immobilization time in cases with a suspected fracture but plain radiographs."
CD010023,0,16404125,0,"""Virtual unwrapping"" of a mummified hand.","The purpose of this work is to demonstrate the feasibility of medical virtual reality technologies in the investigation of a mummified hand. The Ulster Museum obtained the mummy hand, which originated from Thebes, without any identifying information. The mummified hand was investigated using conventional X-ray and 3D multi-slice Computed Tomography (CT). Imaging revealed a range of fractures of the wrist, metacarpals and phalanges whilst 3D CT demonstrated internal structures using volume rendering. The absence of any features of bone healing at the fracture sites would imply that they occurred just prior to death or in the mummified state possibly during excavation. Conventional X-ray imaging indicated that the hand, although small, was likely to have originated from an adult. Medical imaging and virtual reality display will enable us to produce a rapid prototyped model using fused deposition technology. Therefore, further paleopathological research can be performed on the replica without the need to handle the original specimen."

Inactivity-induced osteoporosis plays a major role during the immobilization period in the plaster cast. In the region of the joints remodelling intensity may reach such a high level that the non-injured bone shows a higher rate of accumulation than the fracture. This process already begins between the third and fourth week of immobilization. The highest uptake is found after fracture of the scaphoid bone at the end of twelve weeks of immobilization. Control scintigraphies at intervals of several days are indicated to differentiate between various clinical conditions (pseudoarthrosis, activated osteoarthrosis, algodystrophy in case of doubtful x-ray results)."

Two groups of observers, one North American and one European, consisting of observers at various levels of training were compared. Kappa statistics were used to determine inter- and intra-observer agreement. The receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) curves and area under this curve (AUC) for each observer were calculated to determine test performance. Scaphoid radiographs of 80 consecutive patients seen with clinically suspected scaphoid fracture were included in the study. The results of the bone scan were used as the reference standard. There is an acceptable agreement between the USA and Europe for both radiologists and orthopaedic surgeons at various levels of training (kappa 0.45-0.88). Intra-observer agreement is acceptable as well (kappa 0.46-0.86). Considering all normal or equivocal radiographs, there is slight to moderate agreement at all levels of training in and between both centres and specialities (kappa 0-0.64). Overall test performance was acceptable for all consecutive radiographs (AUC 0.65-0.82) and poor for the normal radiographs (AUC 0.46-0.65). We could not detect differences in performance due to location of the readers' hospital or institution of training.

Nine scaphoid fractures were revealed by both standard X-rays and CT, whereas four fractures could only be detected by CT. Computed tomography should be used when there is clinical suspicion of scaphoid fracture but standard radiographs remain negative. All carpal bones should be examined. Fourteen patients with suspected scaphoid non-union were examined. In twelve patients, scaphoid non-union seemed to be complete in standard X-rays, whereas CT showed a bony bridge between the proximal and distal fragment. Another patient showed bony union. Two patients showed no non-union in standard X-rays. One was confirmed after a Matti-Russe procedure, but the bone graft was dislocated, causing restricted wrist motion. One scaphoid non-union was demonstrated by CT. Two patients showed signs of additional carpal fractures. Diagnostic applications of CT for scaphoid non-union include the determination of the exact location of the fragments and the evaluation of post-traumatic cysts, thus simplifying pre-operative planning."
CD010023,0,19585088,0,[Therapy principles of distal fractures of the forearm in childhood].,"Fractures of the forearm in children represent one of the most frequent injuries. Most are monotraumatic occurring during sport or leisure activities. Diagnosis can be made by conventional X-ray examination in 2 planes. Distal forearm fractures are classified into epiphyseolysis and epiphyseal fractures, metaphyseal greenstick and buckle fractures, complete distal radius and forearm fractures as well as Galeazzi lesions. The vast majority of cases without relevant dislocation can be treated with immobilization employing a cast. The remaining fractures have to be repositioned and restored depending on age and degree of dislocation.The state of the art in surgical therapy is the Kirschner wire osteosynthesis after closed reduction. Especially meta-diaphyseal fractures can alternatively be stabilized with plate osteosynthesis or external fixation. Following these therapeutic principles, prognosis is excellent and most of the injuries heal without any functional impairment."

The use of three-phase bone scintigraphy in patients with normal x-rays of the scaphoid after carpal injury is widely advocated.In this study, 40 patients with negative radiographs but clinically suspected scaphoid fracture, all had rapid bone scintigraphy with images taken 15 min after intravenous injection of 99 m-Technetium Hydroxymethylene diphosphonate. The scan was performed approximately 2 weeks after the trauma. We found 8 fractures of the scaphoid bone and 13 fractures of other carpal bones. In 5 cases the images were inconclusive. At follow-up 6 months to 2 years later we found no patients with non-union. We find this rapid version of the bone scan useful as a second line investigation for continuing wrist pain following trauma in the presence of normal radiography. This can result in a reduction in both time and costs required for the diagnostic process. If the results are inconclusive we recommend a delayed image. CT or MRI could also be considered.

Sixteen established scaphoid fracture nonunions underwent gadolinium-enhanced MR scanning before surgical treatment with bone grafting and internal fixation. No relationship was found between MR enhancement and the outcome of surgery. Union was achieved in eight of the 12 nonunions with more than 50% enhancement, and three of the four with less than 50% enhancement, of the proximal pole. Furthermore, union was achieved in both of the nonunions which had less than 25% enhancement of the proximal pole. We conclude that enhanced MR assessments of the vascularity of the proximal fragment of a scaphoid fracture nonunion do not accurately predict the outcome of reconstructive surgery."

To avoid missing this diagnosis, a high index of suspicion and a thorough history and physical examination are necessary, because early imaging often is unrevealing. Anatomic snuffbox tenderness is a highly sensitive test for scaphoid fracture, whereas scaphoid compression pain and tenderness of the scaphoid tubercle tend to be more specific. Initial radiographs in patients suspected of having a scaphoid fracture should include anteroposterior, lateral, oblique, and scaphoid wrist views. Magnetic resonance imaging or bone scintigraphy may be useful if the diagnosis remains unclear after an initial period of immobilization. Nondisplaced distal fractures generally heal well with a well-molded short arm cast. Although inclusion of the thumb is the standard of care, it may not be necessary. Nondisplaced proximal, medial, and displaced fractures warrant referral to an orthopedic subspecialist."

Surgeons performing these procedures need to be familiar with the anatomy of the scaphoid. A literature review reveals relatively few articles on this subject. The goal of this anatomical study was to measure the scaphoid using current technology and to discuss the findings with respect to the current, relevant literature.Computed tomography scans of 30 wrists were performed using a 64-slice SOMATOM Sensation CT system (resolution 0.6 mm) (Siemens Medical Solutions Inc, Malvern, Pennsylvania). Three-dimensional reconstructions from the raw data were generated by MIMICS software (Materialise, Leuven, Belgium). The scaphoid had a mean length of 26.0 mm (range, 22.3-30.7 mm), and men had a significantly longer (P<.001) scaphoid than women (27.861.6 mm vs 24.561.6 mm, respectively). The width and height were measured at 3 different levels for volume calculations, resulting in a mean volume of 3389.5 mm(3). Men had a significantly larger (P<.001) scaphoid volume than women (4057.86740.7 mm(3) vs 2846.56617.5 mm(3), respectively).We found considerable variation in the length and volume of the scaphoid in our cohort.

Location of the articular defect was dorsal in two cases and volar in the others. The approach (dorsal or volar) depended on the main location of the defect. A costal cartilage graft harvested on the eighth rib was implanted in a trough created at the epiphysis metaphyseal junction. This trough removed the defective area on the distal radius articular surface. A plate or wire fixation was used to stabilize in place the graft. Plaster cast wear was prescribed for 3 months in the first case and for 1 month in the other cases following joint reconstruction. No complications were observed. Union was achieved in all seven cases. Graft integration and viability were evaluated with MRI and biopsy. At the longest follow-up, the functional results were excellent in the first (youngest) case (male, 22 years old) in whom motion and grasp were similar to the contralateral side. In the other cases of malunion, the patients were pain-free in daily activities with a functional wrist score of 72/100 (range, 54-82) and a DASH score of 38.3 (range, 22.5-51.7). Only the case with a septic problem failed, with pain reported at follow-up. Reconstruction of a partially destroyed articular surface using a costal graft is reliable and allows filling and resurfacing an articular cartilage void. Although costal cartilage graft is currently used in maxillofacial surgery, this is the first report in post-traumatic osteoarthritis secondary to intra-articular malunion."

Sixty-seven patients (60%) did not have increased focal uptake over the scaphoid or distal radius, and were mobilised immediately. None of these had a fracture at follow up. Twenty-nine patients with increased uptake over the scaphoid area (26%) remained in plaster of Paris for 6 weeks. All of these had clinical signs of a scaphoid injury. Bone scanning is a practical investigation for all X-ray-negative potential scaphoid injuries, and is acceptable to patient and clinician.

The scaphoid, lunatum and hamatum are most frequently involved. Bilateral defects may be observed. Different mechanisms have been put forward to explain the development of intraosseous defects in the carpal bones including intraosseous penetration of synovial tissue, or in situ metaplasia of bone tissue. The main differential diagnoses are osteonecrosis sequellae (for the lunatum and the scaphoid), subchondral defects due to hyperpression and arthropathies in dialysis patients.

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess and compare the diagnostic performance of bone scintigraphy, MRI, and CT for diagnosing suspected scaphoid fractures. Twenty-six studies were included. Sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic odds ratio were pooled separately and summary receiver operating characteristic curves were fitted for each modality. Meta-regression analyses were performed to compare these modalities. We obtained likelihood ratios derived from the pooled sensitivity and specificity and, using Bayes' theorem, calculated the posttest probability by application of the tests. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, natural logarithm of the diagnostic odds ratio, and the positive and negative likelihood ratios were, respectively, 97%, 89%, 4.78, 8.82, and 0.03 for bone scintigraphy; 96%, 99%, 6.60, 96, and 0.04 for MRI; and 93%, 99%, 6.11, 93, and 0.07 for CT. Bone scintigraphy and MRI have equally high sensitivity and high diagnostic value for excluding scaphoid fracture; however, MRI is more specific and better for confirming scaphoid fracture.

CD010023,0,7624564,0,MR imaging of the major carpal stabilizing ligaments: normal anatomy and clinical examples.,"The integrity of the ligamentous network of the wrist is critical, as disruption of this network may result in carpal instability and pain. The extrinsic (radiocarpal) and intrinsic (intercarpal) ligaments that maintain carpal stability can be evaluated with magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. The major extrinsic ligaments are the radioscaphocapitate, radiolunotriquetral, short radiolunate, and dorsal radiocarpal ligaments. The scapholunate and lunotriquetral ligaments are the most important intrinsic ligaments and the primary wrist stabilizers. The most common causes of carpal instability are unstable fracture of the scaphoid, scapholunate dissociation, and lunotriquetral dissociation. Carpal instability can be diagnosed from the sagittal MR image that includes the capitate, lunate, and radius and from the sagittal MR image that includes the scaphoid and radius. Knowledge of the MR imaging appearances of the major carpal stabilizing ligaments and common patterns of carpal instability allows more precise diagnosis in cases of wrist pain."
CD010023,0,7553020,0,MR imaging of normal and injured wrist ligaments.,"MR imaging is a rapidly evolving modality for examining the ligaments of the wrist. Recent improvements in magnet design and receiver coil technology have allowed consistent visualization of the wrist ligaments. Image quality can be optimized by selection of the proper receiver coil, careful attention to patient comfort and positioning, and selection of a dedicated imaging protocol. The carpal ligaments can be classified as capsular or interosseous ligaments, with the most important interosseous ligaments being the SLL and LTL as well as the triangular fibrocartilage. It is important for radiologists to understand the anatomy of the carpal ligaments in addition to the normal range of MR appearances as basis for comparison with torn or degenerated carpal ligaments."
CD010023,0,17387642,0,MR imaging of trauma: elbow and wrist.,"The use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the setting of acute trauma is increasing due to many factors including availability and demand. The ability to evaluate for occult fractures in addition to concomitant soft tissue injuries has a significant impact on patient management and MRI is the ideal adjunct to plain radiography. Occult fractures in the forearm, particularly the radial head and scaphoid, are common and often lead to repeated examinations and delayed diagnosis, which can be avoided by the use of MRI early in patient investigation. Orthopedists are increasingly performing ligament repairs at the time of fracture fixation and therefore benefit from preoperative MRI to assess the extent of soft tissue injury."

A review of one tarsal navicular and eight tibial stress fractures.,"We sought to evaluate the efficacy of daily pulsed low intensity ultrasound (LIUS) with early return to activities for the treatment of lower extremity stress fractures. Eight patients (2 males, 6 females) with radiographic and bone scan confirmed tibial stress fractures participated in this study. Additionally, a case report of a tarsal navicular stress fracture is described. All patients except one were involved in athletics. Prior to the study, subjects completed a 5 question, 10 cm visual analog scale (VAS) regarding pain level (10 = extreme pain, 1 = no pain) and were assessed for functional performance. Subjects received 20-minute LIUS treatments 5 times a week for 4 weeks. Subjects maintained all functional activities during the treatment period. Seven patients with posterior-medial stress fractures participated without a brace. Subjects were re-tested after 4 weeks of treatment. Mann-Whitney U tests (VAS data) and paired t-tests (functional tests) assessed statistical significance (p<0.05). Although the intensity of practice was diminished in some instances, no time off from competitive sports was prescribed for the patients with the tibial stress fractures. The patient with the anterior tibial stress fracture underwent tibial intramedullary nailing at the conclusion of a season of play. In this uncontrolled experience, treatment of tibial stress fractures with daily pulsed LIUS was effective in pain relief and early return to vigorous activity without bracing for the patients with posterior-medial stress fractures."

CD010023,0,12015713,0,The relationship between proximal pole blood flow and the subjective assessment of increased density of the proximal pole in acute scaphoid fractures.,"The cause and importance of increased density of the proximal pole of the scaphoid seen in radiographs after an acute fracture were investigated. Blood flow to the proximal poles of 32 nonsurgically treated scaphoid fractures were assessed 1 to 2 weeks after injury by measuring their uptake of gadopentetate dimeglumine with dynamic magnetic resonance imaging and calculating its steepest slope and percentage of enhancement values. Initial (week 0) and week 8 scaphoid series radiographs were independently assessed by 2 observers for increased proximal pole density; both agreed that the density had increased during treatment in 9 fractures. All 9 fractures united, suggesting that increased proximal pole density is not a major determinant of fracture outcome. Increased density of the proximal pole was associated with low proximal pole blood flow, but this relationship was not absolute, suggesting that other factors contribute to the appearance of increased density."

CD010023,0,12015717,0,The sensitivity of carpal bone indices to rotational malpositioning.,"We investigated the dependence of 20 radiographic carpal measurements (carpal indices) on rotational positioning errors in posteroanterior and lateral radiographs. The measurements were made from ""true perspective"" digitally reconstructed radiographs created from computed tomography data. Most posteroanterior indices were not affected by rotation. Carpal height, carpal height ratio, revised carpal height ratio, capitate-radius distance, and carpal ulnar translocation were particularly robust. Lateral-view indices involving the scaphoid were the most sensitive to simulated malpositioning: radioscaphoid, scapholunate, and scaphocapitate angles were reduced from 58 degrees, 48 degrees, and 56 degrees at true lateral to 30 degrees, 24 degrees, and 34 degrees, respectively, at 20 degrees external rotation. Observers were unable to estimate the degree of malpositioning accurately in either view. Our results support use of the ""scaphopisocapitate"" criterion for assessing correct positioning in lateral plain radiographs."

The second was a rupture of the flexor pollicis longus tendon that occurred two years after, and the flexor profundus tendon to the index finger that occurred four years after the fracture. In the first case, the ruptures were caused by the bony protuberance of the radius after long interval without interference of the ulnar head."
CD010023,0,9129428,1,MR imaging of clinically suspected scaphoid fractures.,The purpose of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of MR imaging in revealing occult fractures in patients with clinically suspected acute scaphoid fractures who have normal or equivocal findings on radiographs.
CD010023,0,3495968,0,CT for determining the results of treatment of fractures of the wrist.,"Eighteen CT examinations of the wrist were performed in 13 patients to evaluate the results of treatment for carpal fractures. In four cases with metal objects and in seven with cast materials, there was no difficulty achieving adequate CT studies. In 13 cases CT was found to be helpful in determining bony union in the presence of advanced osteoporosis. In six cases CT was excellent in evaluating bone-graft incorporation. CT affords improved detection of fractures perpendicular to the plane of the scan and also shows small areas of bone disruption, even with osteoporosis. Axial CT images can evaluate Lister's tubercle, a bony prominence on the dorsum of the distal radius, for hypertrophy, which can occur secondary to traumatic and degenerative changes. A hypertrophied tubercle can impinge on the extensor pollicis longus tendon and cause atrophy and disruption. The high cost of CT is offset by the possibility of reducing the patient's period of immobilization and, thereby, the length of time the patient is unable to participate in normal activities. In addition, since CT is often definitive, the number of supplemental or follow-up radiologic procedures or clinical appointments should be reduced. We conclude that CT is useful in evaluating the results of treatment of wrist injuries."
CD010023,0,10857066,0,"[Does low intensity, pulsed ultrasound speed healing of scaphoid fractures?].","Since pulsed low-intensity ultrasound (frequency: 1.5 MHz, pulsed by 1 kHz, signal burst width: 200 microseconds, intensity: 30 mW/cm2) has been proven to stimulate fracture healing both clinically and experimentally, our question was whether this therapy also accelerates healing of fresh stable scaphoid fractures. Addressing this question, we did the following prospective randomized clinical trial. Regarding the results of former clinical fresh fracture studies by Heckman and Kristiansen, we postulated that low intensity ultrasound accelerates healing by about 30%. Based on this thesis, we calculated that 30 patients divided into two groups would be necessary to show significant differences between the standard treatment (treated by casting) and an adjunctive ultrasound treatment (treated by casting and additional daily 20 minutes ultrasound treatment) if present. Diagnosis and healing was assessed by CT scans every two weeks. CT's were analyzed by two independent radiologists and one hand surgeon. Furthermore, areas of cancellous bone bridging in correlation to the diameter of the scaphoid was measured in each CT scan. The results showed ultrasounded fractures healing in 43.2 +/- 10.9 days versus 62 +/- 19.2 days in the control group (p < 0.01). Trabecular bridging six weeks after injury showed 81.2% +/- 10.4% healed in the ultrasound-stimulated fractures versus 54.6% +/- 29% in the control (p < 0.05). Our study results confirm those of Heckman and Kristiansen and show a similar acceleration of bone healing. Low intensity ultrasound is successful in accelerating the healing of fresh scaphoid fractures."

CD010023,0,18528238,0,Minimal invasive screw fixation and early mobilization of acute scaphoid fractures in the middle third: operative technique and early functional outcome.,"Fractures of the scaphoid are relatively common injuries. Differentiation between stable and unstable fractures (Herbert classification) cannot always be made with conventional radiographs and should be additionally evaluated by computed tomographic scan. Under most circumstances, minimal invasive surgery with cannulated screws is currently the treatment of choice. Cast immobilization is not necessary. This article describes the technique of fracture fixation in the middle third of the scaphoid from a palmar approach and early functional outcomes. The outcome assessment included measurement of active range of motion as well as grip strength and the Disability of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand questionnaire as a measurement of activities of daily living. Fifty-four patients with acute scaphoid fractures were treated with minimal invasive screw fixation between April 2001 and January 2005. All patients in this retrospective study received a preoperative computed tomographic scan before surgery. Bony consolidation was found in 52 cases after 6 weeks; 2 patients required reosteosyntheses. The results demonstrate that minimal invasive screw fixation leads to satisfying functional outcomes within a few weeks."

At 2 weeks, six patients were found to have a complete fracture of the scaphoid through the waist. In view of this high incidence (15.8%) of occult scaphoid fracture, it is once again suggested that all cases of wrist sprains where scaphoid fracture is suspected be immobilized for a 2-week period."

CD010023,0,21903213,0,Scaphoid morphology and clinical outcomes in scaphoid reconstructions.,"Scaphoid malunion and carpal malalignment can result after scaphoid reconstruction, if the two fragments are not properly reduced before fixation. However, currently there is no information about which degree of deformity or malalignment can be tolerated without impairing clinical function. The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of the scaphoid morphology and carpal alignment on clinical outcomes after scaphoid reconstruction. A total of 65 patients with an average age of 29 years were followed-up after a mean period of 45 months. In all patients, osseous union after a first-time scaphoid reconstruction in the middle third had been confirmed. Scapholunate (SL) and radiolunate (RL) angles were obtained on plain radiographs as were intrascaphoid (ISA) and dorsal cortical (DCA) angles and the height/length (H/L) ratio of the reconstructed scaphoid on computed tomography (CT) scans. These parameters were correlated with clinical outcome measures. RL angles correlated significantly with wrist range of motion, grip strength and pain levels, whilst SL angles, ISA, DCA and H/L ratio failed to show significant correlations. Our data suggest that clinical outcome is correlated with correct restoration of bone morphology and carpal alignment. After reconstruction, the RL angle should not exceed 10°."
CD010023,0,8443554,0,Trispiral tomography and magnetic resonance imaging of the wrist.,"Tomography, which permits a far more accurate visualization of lesions than conventional radiographs, is conducted via several different methods, depending on the specific movement of the x-ray tube. Linear tomography is the simplest method but produces images that appear streaked. Zonotomography, which uses an elliptical or figure-8 movement of the x-ray tube, creates a uniform blurring of structures and a much clearer resolution of the plane of focus. Even sharper images are produced by multidirectional trispiral tomography, which is described as well as its application to specific anatomic areas of the wrist. The normal anatomy and a variety of problems of the wrist as visualized with magnetic resonance imaging are also described."

Physical examination and radiographic findings were consistent with stress injury to the distal radial growth plates. The patient's radiographs also displayed rare findings including cleft radial and ulnar epiphyses, as well as epiphyseal spur formation. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated evidence of metaphyseal and epiphyseal ischemia of the growth plate.

CD010023,0,1784503,0,Central pain and thalamic hyperactivity: a single photon emission computerized tomographic study.,"Five patients with central post-stroke pain (CPSP) accepted to be studied according to the following paradigm: a single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) using [123I]N-isopropyl-iodoamphetamine (IMP) was made in each patient 20 min following i.v. injection of IMP; during this time, the patients were stimulated in order to reproduce their spontaneous pain. Of the five patients, two had CPSP with hyperpathia following a stroke (with a lesion on CT scan involving the thalamo-cortical pathway in one and involving the thalamus in the other); two had CPSP following a stroke in the middle cerebral artery area, without hyperpathia; and the last patient suffered pain from algodystrophia following a fracture of the wrist. In the two cases with hyperpathia, SPECT demonstrated a contralateral relative hyperactivity in a central region corresponding to the thalamic area. This was not observed in the three other patients. In the two patients with hyperpathia, a second SPECT scan with stimulation of the contralateral pain-free arm did not demonstrate any hyperactivity in the thalamic area. These results suggest that a thalamic neuronal hyperactivity may characterize some hyperpathic syndromes and, in accordance with our previous results obtained in the rat, that the loss of inhibition on medial thalamic neurons may be a main feature of hyperpathia following certain cerebral stroke syndromes."

CD010023,0,22094152,0,"Current concepts review: carpal injuries - fractures, ligaments, dislocations.","An overview about current concepts in treating carpal injuries is presented. These injuries are more commonly seen in young, active individuals after a fall on an outstretched hand. Conventional radiographs and a thorough examination are important. The scaphoid is the most affected bone. Scaphoid fractures can be classified in accordance to OTA, AO, and other classification systems, but mostly to Herbert. It can be treated non-operatively if undisplaced, however a percutaneous internal fixation can be discussed to achieve earlier return to work and shorter time to union, but hazarding the consequences of an operation. Unstable, proximal pole, or delayed diagnosed scaphoid fractures should be treated surgically. Nonunion is seen in 5 - 40% of scaphoid fractures depending mainly on displacement and localization of the fracture. The gold standard in non-osteoarthritic scaphoid nonunion is debridement of the nonunion site, bone grafting, realignment, stable fixation and rehabilitation. The treatment of scaphoid-nonunion advanced collapse is more complex. Proximal row carpectomy or arthrodesis (four-corner or complete wrist) can be mandatory. Other carpal bone fractures are rare. Perilunate dislocations are also uncommon but can be disabling. They usually originate in high-energy trauma. The Mayfield stages help to understand the injury pattern. Open reduction through both volar and dorsal approaches, repair of the volar capsule as well as volar and dorsal ligaments, and internal fixation is commonly the standard treatment. However osteoarthritis and carpal instability are often encountered."

Twenty pairs of cadaver wrists were examined and anthropometric analysis of the scaphoids using plain radiography, computed tomography, and en bloc resection was performed. Scaphoid vascularity was evaluated using India ink injection. Radiographic and actual measurements of height and width confirmed symmetry in paired scaphoids. Anatomic evaluation defined a safe zone for screw placement. K-wire placement defined the extent of this zone. The entry point of this zone was found by moving dorsally and distally 15% of the lateral radiographic length of the contralateral scaphoid from the volar aspect of the scaphoid tuberosity. Moving 10% of this same length from the membranous central portion of the scapholunate ligament defined the target site.

Four radiologists, of varying experience, independently reviewed the radiographs on a conventional lightbox and later with the digitizer. In the scaphoid series (350 cases), the performance of the two more experienced radiologists was marginally better with the digitizer, whereas the less experienced radiologists performed slightly worse. Overall the digitizer improved the confidence of the radiologists in diagnosing correctly the presence of a scaphoid fracture but, for the less experienced radiologists, this was at the expense of identifying normality. In the wrist series (200 cases), the use of the digitizer resulted in a minor increase in the true positive and decrease in the false negative observations, but this was offset by a concomitant minor increase in the false positive and decrease in the true negative categories. Evaluation of the soft-tissue planes around the wrist joint showed a limited value in the identification of a scaphoid fracture with an overall positive predictive value of 0.26. Correlation of soft-tissue changes and the presence or absence of a scaphoid fracture was slightly worse with the digitizer. Possible causes for the apparently poorer performance of the digitizer are discussed, as well as the relative merits and potential value of the unit."

The fracture was united by six weeks despite resumption of training eight days postoperatively. Subsequently, the patient presented with pain over the flexor carpi radialis (FCR) tendon together with reduction of wrist flexion strength suggested an FCR tendonitis. A CT scan with injection eliminated the diagnosis of non-union and showed protrusion of the distal end of the screw. After the failure of conservative treatment (corticosteroid injection), removal of the screw and synovectomy of the FCR were scheduled. During the procedure, attrition of the FCR tendon with scar tissue and metal inclusions in its fibres were observed. A visual examination of the screw's distal end showed a distortion of its hexagonal outline due to hammering, leading to metal projection likely to have caused the FCR tendon's attrition. We recommend the systematic burying of these canulated screws as well as changing any screw damaged during its insertion."

CD010023,0,16934205,0,Treatment of acute scaphoid fractures in the athlete.,"Scaphoid fractures in athletes can be very disabling and may limit successful and early return to play. Typically, the mechanism of injury is a fall onto an outstretched hand or a direct blow; the patient will present with swelling, limited motion, and snuffbox tenderness. Multiple-view plain images will very often reveal the diagnosis. In addition, diagnostic modalities such as CT scanning and MRI are helpful in better defining the architecture of the fracture and vascularity of the scaphoid, and diagnosing occult fractures. Early and accurate diagnosis is critical to help ensure appropriate treatment and optimal outcome. Traditional treatment of stable nondisplaced fractures remains cast immobilization. However, if early return to play is desired operative fixation may be warranted. For nondisplaced fractures operative techniques include open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF), and percutaneous fixation through a dorsal or volar approach. Arthroscopy can be used as an adjunct to the percutaneous technique. For displaced fractures, the preferred technique remains ORIF through either a volar or dorsal approach. Considerations in treatment type are based on the stability and location of the fracture as well as patient issues such as compliance and the need for return to play. With appropriate diagnosis and individualization of treatment, scaphoid fractures can be successfully managed in most athletes with few or no long-term sequelae."
CD010023,0,3498327,0,High-resolution CT of the wrist: initial experience with scaphoid disorders and surgical fusions.,"We performed high-resolution CT scans on 30 wrists in 27 patients with either previous surgical intercarpal fusion or known or suspected scaphoid abnormalities. Most examinations used the same protocol: contiguous 1.5-mm axial sections parallel to the long axis of the body of the scaphoid, small reconstruction circle, and bone reconstruction algorithm. Fifteen patients were evaluated for union of previous surgical carpal fusions; eight patients were evaluated for healing of scaphoid fractures; and the other four patients had miscellaneous disorders, including a midcarpal dislocation with a scaphoid fracture. High-resolution CT clearly showed whether the carpal fusions were united. In addition, metallic fixation devices were easy to locate and did not significantly degrade image quality. Osseous union of healing scaphoid fractures was reliably assessed. We conclude that high-resolution CT of the wrist is a useful method for evaluating surgical carpal fusions and various disorders of the scaphoid."

Many authors have advocated for the dorsal approach, citing difficulties with adequate screw placement from the volar approach. We have developed a straightforward and reproducible technique for volar percutaneous scaphoid screw fixation that mitigates most of the drawbacks of the approach. The wrist is held in extension and ulnar deviation with traction through the thumb. A 14-gauge angiocatheter needle is then used to localize the starting point and as a cannula for the guide wire. Specific fluoroscopic views help to confirm optimal guide wire placement."

CD010023,0,21449158,0,"[Isolated fractures of the scaphoid: classification, treatment and outcome].","Scaphoid fracture is the most common fracture in carpal bone of the wrist and represents 11% of all upper extremity fractures. In most cases, the mechanism of injury is a fall with an outstretched hand. Scaphoid fracture detection can be made by clinical examination and standard radiography. Computed tomography (CT), bone scan and MRI improve the sensitivity of the diagnosis. Non-displaced fractures of the scaphoid are treated with cast immobilization in most cases. Operative treatment should be considered in displaced fractures or non-displaced fractures in young active patients by using internal fixation with cannulated screw for definitive anatomic and stable fixation. The main goals of operative treatment are attempts to reduce immobilization time and enable earlier return to work and activity. Displaced fractures of scaphoid, should be treated operatively, as they carry a greater risk for nonunion and malunion, which are associated with the development of radiocarpal arthritis, stiffness and wrist instability. Computed tomography is more useful as an assessment tool in pre-operative planning to determine the fracture location and fragment displacement. Early detection and appropriate treatment of scaphoid fractures is the key to favorable outcome in the treatment of scaphoid fractures."
CD010023,0,21071031,0,Variations in morphological and biomechanical indices at the distal radius in subjects with identical BMD.,"Determination of osteoporotic status is based primarily on areal bone mineral density (aBMD) obtained through dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). However, many fractures occur in patients with T-scores above the WHO threshold of osteoporosis, in part because DXA measures are insensitive to biomechanically important alterations in bone quality. The goal of this study was to determine--within groups of subjects with identical radius aBMD values--the extant variation in densitometric, geometric, microstructural, and biomechanical parameters. High resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) and DXA radius data from males and females spanning large ranges in age, osteoporotic status, and anthropometrics were compiled. 262 distal radius datasets were processed for this study. HR-pQCT scans were analyzed according to the manufacturer's standard clinical protocol to quantify densitometric, geometric, and microstructural indices. Micro-finite element analysis was performed to calculate biomechanical indices. Factor of risk of wrist fracture was calculated. Simulated aBMD calculated from HR-pQCT data was used to group scans for evaluation of variation in quantified indices. Indices reflecting the greatest variation within aBMD level were BMD in the central portion of the trabecular compartment (max CV 142), trabecular heterogeneity (max CV 90), and intra-cortical porosity (max CV 151). Of the biomechanical indices, cortical load fraction had the greatest variation (max CV 38). Substantial variations in indices reflecting density, structure, and biomechanical competence exist among subjects with identical aBMD levels. Overlap of these indices among osteoporotic status groups reflects the reported incidence of osteoporotic fracture in subjects classified as osteopenic or normal."

CD010023,0,8724472,0,Classification and treatment of ulnar styloid nonunion.,"Symptomatic nonunion of the ulnar styloid is an uncommon problem that is usually best treated by simple excision of the ulnar styloid fragment. Two types of nonunion of the ulnar styloid are described here on an anatomic basis, and their treatment differs. Type 1 is defined as a nonunion associated with a stable distal radioulnar joint. Type 2 is defined as a nonunion associated with subluxation of the distal radioulnar joint. The postoperative follow-up period for the two types ranged from 4 months to 13 years, with a mean of 5 years 2 months. Eleven type 1 wrists were treated with excision of the fragment, and all patients had satisfactory relief of pain. Nine type 2 wrists required restoration of the anatomy of the traingular fibrocartilage complex. Three of these had large fragments that were treated by open reduction and internal fixation. All three patients were completely relieved of their discomfort. Six other patients underwent excision of the fragment and repair of the triangular fibrocartilage complex to the distal ulna. This group had four excellent, one good, and one fair result. If the distal radioulnar joint is stable on presentation or if its stability is restored, then long-term relief of pain from ulnar styloid nonunion is achieved by treatment of the nonunion."

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a suitable technique for the detection of occult forms of fractures and of associated soft tissue injuries. In the wrist, fractures are 10 times less common than in the distal radius, with the scaphoid bone to be involved most commonly. Indications for computed tomography (CT) are complex fractures, occult fractures, or dislocations. MRI should be performed to evaluate the soft tissues, to detect occult fractures, or to analyse osteochondral lesions. Indications for arthrography are injuries of the ligaments or of the joint capsule. Fractures and dislocations of the metacarpal, and the phalangeal bones are the most common fractures of the skeletal system. Conventional radiography is the primary imaging technique, followed by sonography and MRI to detect injuries of the ligaments and tendons."

One fracture was slightly displaced: the patient was treated conservatively and followed during 11 years with an excellent result. The other patient was operated on because of persistent pain and malunion. Only during surgery was the correct diagnosis made and due to scaphoid malunion, a proximal row carpectomy was performed. At a post operative assessment, in both cases, X-rays showed a double contour of the proximal pole of the scaphoid.

The current study aimed to clarify the 3-D deformity pattern of malunited distal radius fractures and reveal the influence of osseous deformities, including axial rotation deformity, on wrist and forearm motion. The deformity of 20 dorsally tilted malunions were evaluated using 3-D computer models created from CT data, and correlations between deformity components and range of motion were assessed. The 3-D deformity analysis showed that axial malalignment in pronation, which showed a correlation with the degree of radial tilt deformity, was very common. A radial tilt deformity of > 5° was observed in only 45% of cases. Although the range of wrist flexion and extension showed a correlation with dorsal tilt deformity, the range of forearm pronation and supination did not correlate with distal radius deformities."

These fractures are rare, often go unrecognized, and are reputed to unite with difficulty. A clue to diagnosis was given by the description (young athletic person in sports involving sudden starts and stops). The lesion was not always visible on X-rays of the foot in supination and dorsal flexion (only 10 out of 20 in this series). Use of tomography and tomodensitometry was essential. Treatment was based on compressing the fracture with a screw without grafting or freshening, followed by immobilization of the foot with a cast and no weight bearing for 45 days. Union occurred in 19 out of the 20 cases. Thirteen patients were able to practice their sport without a loss of performance after a period ranging from 3 to 14 months. Treatment varied given the risk of spontaneous non union: incomplete fractures discovered early often responded to orthopedic treatment; fractures associated with large intra-osseous lytic lesions required addition of bone grafting.

CD010023,0,16121617,0,[Recent scaphoid fractures (within the first three weeks)].,"Scaphoid fractures are the most common carpal fracture, accounting for 70 a 80% of all fractures of the wrist. The diagnosis of acute fracture of the scaphoid still continues to be missed despite an increasing improvement of imaging techniques. In fact, these fractures are mainly neglected because of minimal early symptoms or quick resolution of initial symptoms. X-ray analysis of acute fractures is rather difficult because of the irregular shape of the scaphoid and its overlapping with other structures. In case of doubtfull or negative initial radiographic views, a technetium 99 bone scan or MR imaging should be consisidered. These fractures occuring in the young and most active members of our society represents a population that doesn't have the patience for traditionnal immobilisation in cast. Thus patients with undisplaced fractures for whom early return to work or sport is a primary concern, percutaneous repair with cannulated screw fixation using fluoroscopy and even aided with arthroscopy represents an increasing option. Nevertheless, in thoses cases, cast immobilisation should always be first considered. If percutaneous internal fixation is the first choice in proximal pole fractures or fractures seen with a delay, in the other cases, it can only be advocated if internal fixation will provide a stable reduction. There is little controversy for the treatment of displaced unstable scaphoid fractures. Open repair and internal fixation with a screw represents the golden standard. Complex displaced or dislocated fractures are often comminuted and associated with bony defect. Accurate reduction may need to perform a bone graft. The ligamentous injuries should also be carefully repaired . Evidence of associated cartilagenous lesions must be asessed with precision, as they always jeopardize the end result."

CD010023,0,8440272,1,Significance of a hot spot on the bone scan after carpal injury--evaluation by computed tomography.,"The use of bone scintigraphy in patients with negative radiographs after carpal injury is widely advocated. However, focally increased activity on the bone scan in the scaphoid or other carpal bones cannot always be radiologically confirmed as a fracture. To confirm scintigraphically suspected carpal fractures, computed tomography (CT) of the wrist was performed in patients with clinically suspected scaphoid fracture and initially negative radiographs. All patients underwent plain radiography, bone scintigraphy and CT. The combination of plain radiographs and CT, as judged by a panel of experienced observers, was used as the reference standard. In 18 patients, 21 out of 22 carpal hot spots on bone scintigraphy could be radiologically confirmed as a fracture. The diagnosis was missed by CT scan in three patients with proven fractures on plain radiographs. We conclude that, in patients with negative initial radiographs following carpal injury, a positive bone scan must be interpreted as a fracture."

This is an unusual injury that threatens the integrity of both the radiocarpal and distal radioulnar joints. It is the result of a compressive force to the wrist and may require trispiral computed tomography for delineation. Open reduction and internal fixation is recommended to maintain stability and articular congruity. The displaced volar-articular fragment, however, may be relatively small; therefore, direct manipulation could lead to soft tissue stripping and osteonecrosis. We have found the technique of wire-loop fixation to be a simple, reproducible, and effective alternative method of internal fixation for these difficult fractures. Malunion, nonunion, loss of fixation, tendon rupture, infection, arthrosis, or pain caused by hardware has not occurred. Use of this technique is not recommended in patients with osteoporotic bone."

Damage to these ligaments causes changes in bone alignment and altered motion pattern. This may cause pain and eventually osteoarthritis. Imaging techniques of the wrist include conventional arthrography, computed tomography (CT) arthrography, conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and MR arthrography. Especially, MRI plays an important role in the assessment of TFCC, SLL, and LTL. Therefore, special attention is drawn to normal and abnormal MR imaging appearance of these ligaments in this review.

X-ray and MRI examinations of 78 (41 fractures, 37 without fracture) patients with the clinical suspicion of an acute fracture in the distal part of the extremities were compared. Four experienced radiologists, two for each of the two modalities, independently analyzed the images. Interobserver variability and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis for both methods were established. The MRI and conventional radiography revealed an accuracy of 81.4 and of 79.5%, respectively, in the detection of acute fractures. The diagnostic accuracy of MRI to detect fractures in the hand and forefoot proved to be significantly inferior to conventional X-ray examinations. On the other hand, MRI achieved a better accuracy for the examination of bones near a large joint. The interobserver variability for both methods was rated as moderate. In ROC analysis both methods were rated as good. There was no statistical difference of the accuracy between low-field MRI and conventional radiography in the detection of acute fractures of the distal part of the extremities. Consequently, a routine use of low-field MRI as an alternative to conventional radiography to diagnose acute fractures of the extremities seems not to be justified."

Thirty-one patients, one woman and 30 men, were reviewed retrospectively at a mean of 42 (12-77) months. All patients received pre- and postoperative CT scans to assess bone union. In addition to demographic data, the range of motion, grip strength, DASH score, Krimmer score, Mayo wrist score and radiological parameters (carpal height, scapholunate and radiolunate angles) were recorded. Bone union was achieved in 21 patients. The average DASH score in patients with bone union was 12 and that in patients with persistent non-union it was 30. No progression into carpal collapse or increase of scapholunate angles was detected.

CD010023,0,9467190,0,Upper extremity radionuclide bone imaging: the wrist and hand.,"Bone scintigraphy of the hands and wrists represents an important adjunct imaging technique that complements plain film radiographic examination. The use of the three-phase bone scan provides clinical information not only regarding osseous uptake but the blood flow and extravascular distribution of the radiotracer as well. Scintigraphic evaluation of the hands and wrists is employed in acute and chronic conditions. In the event of an equivocal or negative plain film, the bone scan can identify occult fractures. Of particular concern is the identification of scaphoid fractures due to the higher incidence of osteonecrosis. Work related injuries represent a significant health issue. The bone scan can be a part of the algorithm for evaluating chronic pain syndromes including reflex sympathetic dystrophy. The complimentary roles of bone scanning and imaging with gallium-67 citrate or radiolabeled leukocytes has proven useful in the evaluation of acute or chronic osteomyelitis. In addition, the diphosphonates are useful in identifying solitary and multiple primary bone tumors. In the case of primary bone tumor, thallium-201 can be used to evaluate response to therapy. Although uncommon in the hand and wrist, the bone scan can identify metastatic tumors or tumor-related conditions such as hypertrophic osteoarthropathy. Finally, bone scintigraphy may be useful in identifying location and extent in a variety of conditions such as fibrous dysplasia, histiocytosis X, and Paget's disease."

A radius shortening was always added to the revascularization of lunate by this vascularized bone graft. Preoperative and postoperative MRI was systematically done. The average follow-up was 55 months (range 24 to 92 months). MRI showed healing with good revascularization in 16 cases (74%). Lesions of lunate were stabilized in five cases and we had one failure with secondary palliative procedure.

CD010023,0,9820289,0,Distal radius fractures: mechanisms of injury and strength prediction by bone mineral assessment.,"The strength of the radius depends on the mechanical properties of cancellous and cortical bone. By assessing both compartments quantitatively with bone densitometry, we tried to identify the specificity of each in predicting the load at which the distal radius will fracture. Twenty human cadaver forearms were scanned for bone mineral and geometric properties with quantitative computed tomography and dual x-ray absorptiometry. In both a neutral loading situation and one in which the wrist was extended 45 degrees, the load distribution was determined with pressure-sensitive films, and a fracture simulating a fall on the hand was produced with a material testing machine. Fractures that occur with the wrist in extension were produced by a central impact of the scaphoid onto the radiocarpal joint, and those that occur under neutral loading conditions were produced by a more commonly distributed loading pattern. The load at fracture was most specifically predicted (r2=0.74) by bone mineral and geometric measures of the cortex at the shaft of the radius. Bone mineral density measures of trabecular (r2=0.64) and total (r2=0.66) bone were less successful in predicting the fracture load. After adjustment for bone size, the geometric and density measures revealed similar specificity. Cortical bone, therefore, contributes significantly to the strength of the distal radius and may play an important role in the prediction of osteoporotic wrist fractures."

CD010023,0,9699835,0,Poor interobserver reliability of AO classification of fractures of the distal radius. Additional computed tomography is of minor value.,"Interobserver reliability of the AO system of classification of fractures of the distal radius was assessed using plain radiographs and CT. Five observers classified 30 Colles'-type fractures using only plain radiographs; two months later they were reclassified using CT in addition. Interobserver reliability was poor in both series when detailed classification was used. By reducing the categories to five, interobserver reliability was slightly improved, but was still poor. When only two AO types were used, the reliability was moderate using plain radiographs and good to excellent with the addition of CT. The use of CT as well as plain radiographs brings interobserver reliability to a good level in assessment of the presence or absence of articular involvement, but is otherwise of minor value in improving the interobserver reliability of the AO system of classification of fractures of the distal radius."

Over a 12 month period a total of 51 patients with suspected fracture underwent both conventional 99Tcm-MDP scintigraphy and 16 detector multislice CT on the same day. The 99Tcm-MDP uptake was then quantified in patients with identified fracture. This was measured by placing a region of interest (ROI) over the fracture site and the mean and maximum number of counts were compared with those in a similar size ROI placed over background bone activity. A total of 23 fractures were identified on scintigraphy of which 16 were also detected on CT (concordant). In seven cases the fracture was not seen on CT, even in retrospect (discordant). In the discordant cases, follow-up radiographs and MRI (where available) also failed to demonstrate a fracture. The mean fracture count to background bone activity ratio averaged 7.7 (range 3.2-18.5) for concordant fractures and 3.8 (range 1.7-5.3) for discordant fractures (t-test p=0.04). The maximum fracture count to background bone activity ratio averaged 12.7 (range 4.3-27.7) for concordant fractures and 6.3 (range 2.6-9.5) for discordant fractures (t-test p=0.03). It is speculated whether these discordant fractures with less 99Tcm-MDP uptake may represent a less severe injury such as bone bruise."

CD010023,0,8479720,0,Imaging techniques for distal radius fractures and related injuries.,"In patients with distal radius fractures, routine roentgenographic examination in at least two or three planes should be performed first and is usually sufficient for correct diagnosis and adequate treatment. A careful examination of the soft tissues of the forearm and wrist on conventional roentgenograms may be key for correct diagnoses. Routine roentgenographic examination of the wrist, preferable in four views, should be performed in every patient with a distal radius fracture acutely as well as at follow-up. The technique is easy to perform, universally available, and inexpensive. Advanced imaging techniques such as radionuclide bone imaging, CT, or MR imaging should not be first choice modalities in patients with distal radius fractures and should be used only when conventional roentgenograms are inconclusive. Scintigraphy can be helpful for diagnosing occult fractures, for documenting fracture healing and ligamentous or cartilaginous post-traumatic disorders, as well as for diagnosis and follow-up of reflex sympathetic dystrophy. A disadvantage of scintigraphy is its poor specificity. Indications for CT include the confirmation of occult fractures suspected on the basis of the findings of physical examination and focally hot bone scintigrams when plain films are normal or inconclusive. In comparison with conventional radiography, CT is superior for the preoperative evaluation of complex comminuted distal radius fractures, depicting the distal radial articular surface and size and position of fracture fragments, as well as for the assessment of fracture healing. Additionally, CT is the imaging technique of choice for the correct diagnosis of subluxations of the distal radioulnar joint. Magnetic resonance imaging is an important diagnostic technique for the evaluation of suspected injuries of soft tissues related to distal radius fractures, such as to the flexor and extensor tendons or the median nerve, and for the early diagnosis of necrosis of the scaphoid or lunate. Other indications include identification of triangular fibrocartilage complex perforations, ruptures of carpal ligaments, and demonstration of contents of the carpal tunnel."
CD010023,0,20699752,0,Repositioning osteotomy for intra-articular malunion of distal radius with radiocarpal and/or distal radioulnar joint subluxation.,"Intra-articular malunion of the distal radius may be complicated with radiocarpal and radioulnar joint subluxation, which may result in joint stiffness and loss of function. Conventional corrective osteotomy emphasizes on the restoration of the articular step-off. However, little information is available concerning the restoration of a concentric functioning joint through osteotomy."
CD010023,0,11469846,0,Temporary ischaemia of the scaphoid in a child.,"We describe a case of a 12-year-old boy who developed acute ischaemia of the entire scaphoid following simple trauma to the wrist. No fracture was evident; however, MRI and bone scintigraphy at the time of the injury revealed complete ischaemia of the scaphoid. A repeat MRI at 6 months showed evidence of incomplete revascularisation of the scaphoid."

The wrist X-ray from childhood and MR may be useful in diagnose.
CD010023,0,19085822,0,[Free microvascular transfer of segmental corticocancellous femur for treatment of avascular scaphoid necrosis].,"Successful treatment of scaphoid non-union with avascular necrosis of the proximal poles and humpback deformity with carpal collapse is one of the main problems in reconstructive hand surgery. Vascularised bone transfer is one of the most successful techniques for treating these problems. 15 patients with avascular necrosis and non-union of the scaphoid were treated by a microvascular reanastomosed corticocancellous transplant from the distal medial femur. In all patients the success of the microvascular bone transfer was examined by MRI and conventional radiographs immediately, 6 weeks, 3, 6 and 12 months postoperatively. The transplant vitality, signs of reunion and carpal configuration were registered. Furthermore, the Mayo wrist score was employed for clinical evaluation. All transplants remained vital during the follow-up period of one year. Pseudoarthrosis was treated successfully in every case. In 14 cases there was a significant increase of the Mayo wrist score and in one case there was no difference before and after surgery. The microvascular transfer of corticocancellous femur resulted in a high rate of complete healing of scaphoid pseudoarthrosis and correction of the carpal relation."
CD010023,0,7964103,0,Real time ultrasonography in the assessment of movement at the site of a scaphoid fracture non-union.,"We investigated the use of real time linear ultrasonography in determining movement at a scaphoid fracture site in 27 patients with non-united scaphoid fractures. 24 of these patients had surgical treatment. Fracture movement was observed at the time of surgery and this was compared with the ultrasonographic findings. The technique proved to be 100% specific for visualization of movement at the fracture site and it was non-invasive. However, it was of no benefit in assessing proximal pole non-union."
CD010023,0,14727035,0,[Diagnostics at the wrist].,"Injuries of the wrist are difficult to diagnose because of the complex and narrow anatomic structures. Based on precise clinical examination, X-rays, CT, and MRI are valuable additional tools that can be used. If a fracture is suspected a CT scan is preferable. In the case of a suspected soft tissue or ligamentous injury and non-vital fragments or necrosis MRI is suitable. Other diagnostic tools are presently of minor importance for the wrist. Technical innovations allow better visualization and classification of lesions. However, exact knowledge of the tools is important."
CD010023,0,14686823,0,Management of scaphoid nonunions.,"Scaphoid nonunions result in a predictable pattern of wrist arthrosis. To minimize the incidence of arthrosis, the goal of treatment should be consolidation of the fracture with the scaphoid in anatomic alignment. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging scans can aid evaluation of carpal collapse, scaphoid collapse, scaphoid nonunion, bone loss, and detection of osteonecrosis. Nonunion of the scaphoid waist may result in a humpback deformity, increasing the chances of further collapse and arthrosis. This collapse deformity must be approached volarly with an intercalary bone graft and internal fixation. A dorsal approach to proximal scaphoid nonunions allows easier access for removing the necrotic bone from the proximal pole and applying accurate screw or pin fixation. Vascularized bone graft is recommended to manage scaphoid nonunions with osteonecrosis."

CD010023,0,19501802,0,"Evaluation and treatment of navicular stress fractures, including nonunions, revision surgery, and persistent pain after treatment.","Despite increased awareness of stress fractures of the tarsal navicular and a heightened index of suspicion by those physicians evaluating sports related foot pain, these injuries remain difficult to diagnose. There is often a considerable delay in the diagnosis because of its subtle and often vague clinical presentation. Accompanying a thorough history and physical, the authors recommend plain radiographs of the foot and ankle, followed by a CT scan to fully characterize any fracture of the navicular and to rule out other etiologies of foot pain. If a CT scan is negative, and a high clinical suspicion persists, an MRI scan is then obtained to rule out a stress reaction. While often successful, non-operative treatment of navicular stress fractures is prolonged and often frustrating to the competitive athlete; surgical intervention for appropriately selected patients can result in full symptom resolution and a return to the desired level of athletic participation."
CD010023,0,15620498,0,Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA): can it detect acute scaphoid fractures?,"This prospective study investigated whether dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) could detect acute scaphoid fractures. We blindly compared 10 normal and 10 fractured scaphoid images produced with a new technique of DXA scan analysis. This measured and plotted the density of the scaphoid throughout its length, producing a linear graph of the scaphoids' density instead of a single area (g/cm2) measurement of bone density. These new plots only detected six of the 10 fractures and suggested that four of the normal controls were fractured. Thus, this technique of DXA scan analysis is neither sensitive nor specific for the detection of acute scaphoid fractures."
CD010023,0,3623270,0,[Tumors and tumor-like diseases of the carpal bones].,"This presentation concerns the findings in 105 tumors or tumor-like lesions in the bones of the carpus. These tumors generally produce complaints which are uncharacteristic and they are quite difficult to recognize on X-ray. Due to this difficulty, there may be many different therapies before the correct final diagnosis is confirmed. These tumors are usually found in the scaphoid, capitate, lunate, or hamate. Of the 105 tumors, 45.7% were osteoid osteoma, which has an incidence of only 11.33% of all bone tumors in the body as a whole. Of the remaining tumors, 15.24% were diagnoses to be intraosseous ganglia (= tumorlike lesions). Lesser percentages were giant-cell tumors, osteochondromas, chondromas. One intraosseous lipoma was found and this had never before been reported. The majority of the patients were between twenty and thirty years of age. With surgical removal, complaints are generally reduced. Dramatic relief from pain is reported by patients when an osteoid osteoma is removed. The most important deduction from these findings is that tumors in the carpus are not as rare as once assumed. The possibility of bone tumors should be considered in patients with intractable pain in the carpus."
CD010023,0,21234740,0,[Carpal instability].,"Carpal instability can be understood as a disturbed anatomical alignment between bones articulating in the carpus. This disturbed balance occurs either only dynamically (with movement) under the effect of physiological force or even statically at rest. The most common cause of carpal instability is wrist trauma with rupture of the stabilizing ligaments and adaptive misalignment following fractures of the radius or carpus. Carpal collapse plays a special role in this mechanism due to non-healed fracture of the scaphoid bone. In addition degenerative inflammatory alterations, such as chondrocalcinosis or gout, more rarely aseptic bone necrosis of the lunate or scaphoid bones or misalignment due to deposition (Madelung deformity) can lead to wrist instability. Under increased pressure the misaligned joint surfaces lead to bone arrosion with secondary arthritis of the wrist. In order to arrest or slow down this irreversible process, diagnosis must occur as early as possible. Many surgical methods have been thought out to regain stability ranging from direct reconstruction of the damaged ligaments, through ligament replacement to partial stiffening of the wrist joint."

CD010023,0,20048493,0,Clinical examination of scaphoid fractures.,"Undetected scaphoid fractures may lead to complications, including nonunion, malunion, avascular necrosis, and wrist arthritis. A competent physical examination is essential for the diagnosis of scaphoid fractures in the setting of occult fractures presenting with normal radiographs. The differential diagnosis of occult scaphoid fractures includes acute tears of the scaphoid-lunate ligament, Kienbock's disease, occult ganglion, nondisplaced radial styloid fractures, and injury to the radial aspect of the radio-scapho-capitate ligament. All of these may have normal plain radiographs but often can be distinguished based on physical examination findings. The 2 key points of such an examination include the exact location of point tenderness and provocative special tests. Although Watson's scaphoid shift test is classically described for scaphoid instability, we highlight its significance in the setting of scaphoid fractures."

CD010023,0,17950226,0,Corrective osteotomy for volar instability of the distal radioulnar Joint associated with radial shaft malunion.,"Volar instability of the distal radioulnar joint is an uncommon wrist disorder. We report three cases of recurrent volar instability of the distal radioulnar joint secondary to fracture of the radial shaft. In all cases, X-rays showed a volar apex deformity of the radial shaft. Opening wedge osteotomy and iliac bone grafting was performed on the distal diaphysis of the radius instead of on the radial shaft, in order to adjust the distal radioulnar joint more easily. Pre-operative dislocations and painful clunks disappeared in all three patients. However, slight instability of the distal radioulnar joint remained in all cases. Osteoarthritis of the distal radioulnar joint was noted in one patient 31 months after the operation. All of the patients were satisfied with the results and did not desire further operations."

This system has been evaluated by prospectively studying 23 patients who were referred for suspected injury of the wrist. The registration system has an inherent precision for registration of about 1 mm. When patient positioning errors are included, this increases to about 4 mm. Two observers evaluated the sets of images prior to registration and after registration and combined display. They judged that in 16 out of 17 cases judged abnormal (observer 1) and 12 out of 18 cases judged abnormal (observer 2), the registration technique improved localization of a lesion. One case was rejected as registration was not possible due to incorrect positioning of the hand."

Scans were performed an average of 3 months after injury and many were inconclusive because of disuse changes. A prospective analysis of early scintigraphy in 35 cases over 18 months was carried out. Scans were performed at an average of 15.5 days after injury in selected cases. Patients had an average of 1.28 sets of negative radiographs prior to scanning. There were no false negative scans and in 13 with focal uptake a wrist fracture was demonstrated. Diffuse uptake was thought to be indicative of ligamentous damage or reflex sympathetic dystrophy. Early scintigraphy was found to be a sensitive, reliable and cost-effective examination in cases of suspected significant wrist injury."

The series included 10 patients who were selected either for disagreement of clinical and radiological findings, the latter being negative (3 patients), or for better assessment of radiological findings, which had diagnosed bone lesions, in order to plan treatment (7 cases). CT provided additional information in 5 patients, demonstrating 2 nonunited fractures in the first group and 2 pseudoarthroses with no significant bone deformity and 1 osteonecrosis in the second group. These results, which proved essential to plan the subsequent treatment, show that CT has, at present, in specific cases, a definite role in evaluating post-traumatic scaphoid conditions, and stress the value of direct coronal images, which are both easy to interpret, being equivalent to radiographs in postero-anterior projection, and quick to perform."
CD010023,0,7717945,0,Injuries to the ulnar carpometacarpal region: are they being underdiagnosed?,"Thirteen cases with radiographic evidence of injury to the ulnar side of the hand are reviewed. These injuries included intraarticular fractures and/or dislocations of the fourth and fifth carpometacarpal joints and associated bones collectively discussed here as the ulnar carpometacarpal region. In nine the extent of the injury was not appreciated on first presentation. Injuries to this region are often difficult to assess clinically and radiographically even in experienced hands. In our experience computerized tomography (CT) scans in the longitudinal and longitudinal oblique axis best display the ulnar carpometacarpal joint surfaces and their relationship to each other. We recommend CT of the ulnar carpometacarpal region where clinical evidence of an injury to this region is not in keeping with the plain radiographic findings, and when planning surgery on a complex injury in this region."

CD010023,0,8423315,0,Diagnosis of occult scaphoid fractures by intrasound vibration.,"We investigated a new means of diagnosing occult scaphoid fractures. Eighty-six patients underwent vibratory testing at presentation, while the clinical examination and standard four-view x-ray examination findings were unknown to the persons who performed the vibratory testing of both the injured and uninjured wrists. Thirty-six patients had radiographically confirmed scaphoid fractures and, after their vibratory tests, were eliminated from the study. Fifty patients, 39 men and 11 women, were believed to have scaphoid fractures on the basis of history and clinical examination findings but were included in the occult scaphoid study group because standard four-view x-ray films of the wrists did not reveal a scaphoid fracture. Distinction between the fracture and no-fracture patients was made with a limited two-phase technetium bone scan and delayed x-ray examination. All patients with known scaphoid fractures (36) had positive findings on vibratory examination. Vibratory testing identified all six of the patients with occult scaphoid fractures (sensitivity 100%). Results of two examinations were false-positive, and none were false-negative (specificity 95%). One of the patients with false-positive results had a fracture of the trapezium, and the other had reflex sympathetic dystrophy. The vibratory testing of injured wrists is inexpensive, noninvasive, and easy to perform, and it involves no ionizing radiation."
CD010023,0,15738806,0,Carpal fractures in children.,"Carpal injuries in children are relatively rare. Diagnosis is likely to be missed, or the severity of the injury might not fully be appreciated at the time of presentation. Fortunately, in the majority of cases the fracture heals uneventfully with a low incidence of complications. As in adults, the scaphoid is most susceptible to injury and the capitate, which often presents in association with other carpal bone injuries, the next most susceptible. Other carpal bone fractures are very unusual and the literature largely is confined to case reports or very small series. This review article lists the common carpal injuries in children and suggests a treatment plan in each case, emphasizing the importance of having a high index of suspicion when faced with a child with a wrist injury and seemingly normal radiographs."
CD010023,0,19708624,0,A rare wrist injury: simultaneous fractures of the hamate body and scaphoid waist.,"Hamate fractures, which are classified as fractures of the body or the hook, are rare, representing only 2% to 4% of carpal fractures. Hamate body fractures can occur as isolated injuries, but in a high-energy trauma, associated carpal bone fractures or carpal disruption can be seen. Hamate fractures can be easily underdiagnosed. Pain in the ulnar side of the palm and swelling of the wrist after a wrist injury should alert the physician. Anteroposterior and lateral radiographs of the wrist may not always be adequate for the diagnosis. Computed tomography should be used to explain the pain in the wrist and to investigate any associating osseous pathologies. This article describes a case of a rare wrist injury: a fracture of the hamate body and a simultaneous fracture of the scaphoid waist treated nonoperatively. To our knowledge, there is only 1 case report in the literature in which the fracture of the hamate body accompanies the fracture of the distal pole of the scaphoid."

CD010023,0,3189662,0,Delayed unions and nonunions of stress fractures in athletes.,"From 1971 to 1985, 369 athletes presented to us with stress fractures. Of these patients, 10% (37) were treated for development of delayed unions or nonunions. Twenty-seven of the patients were male and 10 were female. Their mean age was 23.1 years (range, 17 to 39). About half of the athletes were involved in endurance sports. The diagnostic criteria for a delayed union or nonunion were clinical and radiological evidence. There was a diagnostic delay of about 3.5 months in the series. Plain radiographs, tomography, and isotope scans were used in the diagnosis. Special radiographic views were also used. In 15 cases (10 hallux sesamoid bone fractures, 1 midtibial shaft fracture, 1 metatarsal V base fracture, 1 tarsal navicular fracture, 1 olecranon fracture, and 1 proximal tibial shaft fracture) nonoperative treatment was used. Operative treatment was used 22 times (5 sesamoid fractures, 5 midtibial fractures, 5 metatarsal V base fractures, 3 tarsal navicular fractures, 3 olecranon fractures, and 1 proximal tibial shaft fracture). Results were good or excellent in 32 cases (86.5%), moderate in 4 cases, and poor in 1 case."
CD010023,0,11901382,0,Three-dimensional in vivo kinematics of the distal radioulnar joint in malunited distal radius fractures.,"How malunion of the distal radius affects the kinematics of the distal radioulnar joint in vivo was evaluated. A novel computed tomography image-based technique was used to quantify radioulnar motion in both wrists of 9 patients who had unilateral malunited distal radius fractures. In the injured wrists dorsal angulation averaged 21 degrees +/- 6 degrees, radial inclination averaged 18 degrees +/- 5 degrees, and radial shortening averaged 21 +/- 3 mm. Clinically, the average range of motion of the injured wrists was 75 degrees +/- 25 degrees pronation and 73 degrees +/- 23 degrees supination. Kinematics of the radius during pronation and supination in the malunited forearms was indistinguishable from that in the uninjured forearms. In both the axis of rotation of the radius passed through the center of the ulnar head, although it shifted slightly ulnar and volar in supination and radial and dorsal during pronation. In contrast to previous in vitro biomechanical findings, there was no dorsovolar radial translation at the extremes of pronation or supination and no translation of the radius along the rotation axis. Soft tissues may play a larger role in limiting function than previously appreciated, and treatment may require correction of altered soft tissue structures as well as any abnormal bone anatomy."
CD010023,0,9232498,0,Navicular body fractures: computerized tomography findings and mechanism of injury.,"The case reports of five patients with signs and symptoms of a fracture of the tarsal navicular body are presented. Each patient underwent a computerized tomography examination to determine the extent of this fracture. Based on the computerized tomography findings, surgical or conservative management was carried out. The computerized tomography examination, combined with the patient's history, has shed new light on a previously undescribed mechanism of injury for this fracture."
CD010023,0,12479336,0,Percutaneous internal fixation of scaphoid fractures via an arthroscopically assisted dorsal approach.,"Percutaneous internal fixation of scaphoid fractures allows for more predictable union and less morbidity than cast treatment or open internal fixation. A headless cannulated compression screw (standard Acutrak) is implanted by way of a dorsal percutaneous approach with the aid of fluoroscopy and arthroscopy to confirm screw position and fracture reduction. This technique is indicated in the correction of acute proximal pole fractures, acute waist fractures, and delayed unions that are not associated with avascular necrosis or collapse. The details of this technique are reviewed. In a consecutive series of twenty-seven fractures (seventeen waist fractures and ten proximal pole fractures) treated with arthroscopically assisted dorsal percutaneous fixation, computed tomographic scanning confirmed 100% union at an average of twelve weeks. Eighteen fractures were treated within one month after the injury, and nine were treated more than one month after the injury. In this series, the fractures that were treated early (less than one month after the injury) healed more quickly than those treated later."
CD010023,0,22541157,0,Management of scaphoid nonunion.,"The primary risk factor for nonunion of the scaphoid is displacement/instability, but delayed or missed diagnosis, inadequate treatment, fracture location, and blood supply are also risk factors. Untreated nonunion leads to degenerative wrist arthritis-the so-called scaphoid nonunion advanced collapse wrist. However, the correlation of symptoms and disease is poor; the true ""natural history"" is debatable because we evaluate only symptomatic patients presenting for treatment. It is not clear that surgery can change the natural history, even if union is attained. The diagnosis of nonunion is made on radiographs, but computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging scans can be useful to assess deformity and blood supply. Treatment options vary from percutaneous fixation to open reduction and internal fixation with vascularized or nonvascularized bone grafting to salvage procedures involving excision and/or arthrodesis of carpals."
CD010023,0,11206349,0,Degeneration of the scaphoid-trapezium joint: a useful finding to differentiate calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease from osteoarthritis.,"This study aimed to determine whether osteoarthritis of the scaphoid-trapezium joint (ST osteoarthritis) is associated with calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease (CPDD) in an elderly population with or without concomitant polyarthritis of the finger joints (FIPO). An age- and gender matched case-control study was performed at a university hospital outpatient clinic. Cases and controls were identified from a clinical registry. The case ascertainment process included: (1) chart review for evidence of pyrophosphate crystals from arthrocentesis and/or cartilage calcifications and (2) blinded reading of hand X-rays by three observers for calcification of the triangular fibrocartilage and/or cartilage calcification around the spatium triangulare. Osteoarthritis was graded from 0 to 4 according to the Standard Atlas of Radiographs. The association of ST osteoarthritis with the diagnosis was examined using chi2 tests or the Wilcoxon rank sum test as appropriate. From 65 potential cases, 30 fulfilled the inclusion/exclusion criteria whereas from 185 potential controls, 81 fulfilled the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Thirty controls were matched to cases for gender and age. ST osteoarthritis was much more severe in CPDD (median: 3.0) than in patients with FIPO (median: 0.3) and was strongly associated with the diagnosis (odds ratio 13.8; CI 3.4-59.8). Definite ST osteoarthritis identified CPDD with a sensitivity of 83% and a specificity of 73% with regard to FIPO. It was concluded that the presence of ST osteoarthritis is a helpful diagnostic finding for the diagnosis of CPDD in an elderly, predominantly female population with a high prevalence of FIPO.

CD010023,0,7747190,0,Distal radioulnar joint subluxation and dislocation diagnosed by standard roentgenography.,"The use of standard lateral roentgenography for diagnosing distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) subluxation and dislocation was investigated. Using a wrist support, bilateral standard lateral roentgenograms of the wrist were obtained in 42 patients with normal wrists and in 56 patients with a unilateral wrist injury. In normal wrists the difference between the radioulnar distance in the right and the left wrist did not exceed 4 mm when the difference in the pisoscaphoid distance was less than 3 mm. Of the 36 patients with wrist injury whose difference in pisoscaphoid distance was less than 3 mm, 15 had a radioulnar distance of 5 mm or more, and computed tomography (CT) confirmed DRUJ dislocation in 14. Concordance between lateral roentgenograms and CT was present in 33 of 36 patients (92%). These results demonstrate the value of a standardized technique for bilateral lateral roentgenography in diagnosing DRUJ subluxation and dislocation."
CD010023,0,17224223,0,Collapsed scaphoid non-union with dorsal intercalated segment instability and avascular necrosis treated by vascularised wedge-shaped bone graft and fixation.,"Patients with the specific problem of a collapsed Nakamura volar type, scaphoid synovial pseudarthrosis with avascular necrosis on both magnetic resonance imaging and intraoperative inspection were studied to determine the ability of a trapezoidal wedge-shaped structural bone graft vascularised by the 1,2 intercompartmental supraretinacular artery to simultaneously achieve correction of the scaphoid dimension and a high union rate. Fifteen patients with this specific problem were followed for a mean of 32.1 months and achieved union in all cases at a mean of 11.5 weeks. Improvements were seen postoperatively in wrist flexion and extension, grip strength, degree of dorsal intercalated segment instability and degree of scaphoid collapse. Two complications relating to the fixation technique occurred. Although technically difficult, it is possible to achieve a high rate of union for scaphoid pseudarthrosis while correcting substantial collapse deformity by the use of a structural, wedge-shaped, vascularised bone graft."
CD010023,0,17541372,0,[The diagnosis of recent scaphoid fractures: review of the literature].,"Fractures of the scaphoid are the most common carpal fractures. A review of the literature indicates that the prevalence of the fracture in the case of clinical suspicion is less than 50%. A quality X-ray examination remains essential as an initial diagnostic tool in the evaluation of scaphoid fractures. Its sensitivity varies from 59 to 79%. Patients with negative X-rays present with about 18.7% of scaphoid fractures; 5% of bruised scaphoid; 13% of radius fractures and 7% of miscellaneous bone lesions. If not treated promptly, a scaphoid fracture may be compounded by non-union with associated risk factors such as avascular necrosis and osteoarthritis. Considering these risks, patients with suspected scaphoid fracture with normal X-rays, routinely undergo wrist immobilization until imaging confirms or denies the presence of fracture. Consequently, more than half of the patients undergo wrist immobilization needlessly. This may have a negative impact on their professional life and personal activities while representing a high medical cost. MRI is the imaging technique of choice for suspicious or negatice X-rays. MDCT is less costly than MRI or bone scan, readily available and highly effective for trauma patients but is lacks accuracy and should be used with caution in this indication."

CD010023,0,7296203,0,Isotope bone imaging in suspected scaphoid trauma.,"The unreliability of radiological examination in excluding or confirming a suspected scaphoid fracture after carpal trauma is a well-recognised diagnostic problem. This paper explores the role of isotope bone imaging (IBI) in the early identification of carpal bone injury. Abnormal generalized uptake of activity may be seen within the carpus, possibly as a consequence of diffuse soft tissue injury, particularly if imaging is performed within 48 hours of trauma. A focal area of increased uptake related to one carpal bone is suggestive of fracture though the part which ligamentous injury, localized periosteal reaction or incomplete cortical infarction may play in the production of such radionuclide appearances is uncertain. Ninety-nine patients with suspected recent scaphoid fracture but no demonstrable abnormality on radiological examination were subjected to IBI, using 555 MBq (15 mCi) of 99Tcm methylene diphosphonate. Abnormal focal increased uptake (AFIU) was found in 47 patients, this being localized to the scaphoid bone in 26. Of these 47 cases, 19 (42%) showed subsequent radiological evidence of fracture. The results of IBI, in our experience, can only be reliably interpreted if imaging is performed at least 48 hours after injury, though in cases of fracture AFIU may persist for several years. Using this technique, the possibility of fracture can be confidently excluded in that group of patients who show no AFIU. In selected cases of carpal trauma, IBI provides a satisfactory alternative means of identifying the presence and site of localized injury within the carpus and may be used to confidently exclude those patients with non-osseous symptomatology."

With these wrist imaging protocols, they have evaluated the majority of commonly encountered pathologic conditions of the wrist. They have found that high-resolution images, which can be acquired in a very timely fashion when fast spin echo sequences are used in imaging protocols, will demonstrate the most common pathologic conditions, including triangular fibrocartilage and ligament tears in the wrist. They present the practical issues of patient position and imaging sequences as well as the imaging findings in those pathologic conditions."

Five cases are described in which radiographically-occult fractures were clearly demonstrated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These fractures were seen on MRI as a low signal linear band on T1- and T2-weighted images, with surrounding increased signal intensity from bone marrow oedema on T2-weighted images. In one case, intense oedema obscured the fracture line on the initial MR scan. MRI is useful in confirming the presence of a fracture, delineating its exact shape and location, and in the follow-up of these injuries during and after treatment."

CD010023,0,11279570,0,Evaluation of the sigmoid notch with computed tomography following intra-articular distal radius fracture.,"A classification system for disruption patterns of the sigmoid notch of the radius associated with distal radius fractures has not been established. Using plain x-rays and corresponding computed tomography (CT) scans we characterized and quantified the types of sigmoid notch involvement in 20 consecutive distal radius fractures with radiocarpal joint extension. Plain radiographs revealed fracture extension into the sigmoid notch in only 7 cases (35%) and the CT scans demonstrated fracture extension into the sigmoid notch in 13 cases (65%). Of the 13 fractures with sigmoid notch involvement, 9 (69%) were displaced and 4 (31%) were nondisplaced. Sigmoid notch articular step-off (n = 7) and gapping (n = 9) were detectable on the CT scans but not on the x-rays. Plain x-rays appear to underestimate sigmoid notch involvement following distal radius fractures. In addition, CT appears to be a superior diagnostic modality for quantifying sigmoid notch fracture step-off and articular gapping."

A total of 28 specimens had MR-histologic correlation. Biopsy specimens obtained by curettage provided pathologic correlation. MRI proved accurate in prospective evaluation of bone viability for both scaphoid fractures and Kienbock's disease. Normal marrow signal was shown to correlate with the presence of osteoid and osteocytes on light microscopy and a surface layer of fluorescence reflecting tetracycline uptake in viable bone. Decreased marrow signal corresponded to non-viable trabeculae with scant osteoid, without osteocytes and no tetracycline labeling. By virtue of its accurate identification of avascular necrosis, MRI may prove valuable in predicting prognosis for patients with scaphoid fractures and Kienbock's disease of the lunate."

The accessory navicular is one of the most common accessory ossicles of the foot. There is a higher incidence in women and the finding might be bilateral in 50-90%. This entity is usually asymptomatic, although populations with medial foot pain have a higher prevalence. Three types of accessory navicular bone have been described. The type II accessory navicular is the most commonly symptomatic variant with localized chronic or acute on chronic medial foot pain and tenderness with associated inflammation of overlying soft tissues. Plain radiographic identification of the accessory navicular is insufficient to attribute symptomatology. Ultrasound allows for comparison with the asymptomatic side and localization of pain. Bone scintigraphy has a high sensitivity but positive findings lack specificity. Magnetic resonance imaging is of high diagnostic value for demonstrating both bone marrow and soft tissue oedema."

Established indications include the osteonecroses (scaphoid and lunate); however, MR images always should be evaluated in conjunction with plain radiographs. By delineating bone marrow edema, MRI is well suited for the detection of microfractures.

CD010023,0,7989702,0,The utility of a bone scan in the diagnosis of clinical scaphoid fracture.,"The incidence of true scaphoid fracture and the value of radionuclide scan was evaluated in a 1-year retrospective review of 54 emergency department patients with a preliminary diagnosis of clinical scaphoid fracture (snuff box tenderness and negative initial X-ray study). All emergency department charts of patients with a discharge diagnosis of clinical scaphoid fracture were reviewed to determine the number ultimately found to have a true scaphoid fracture and to ascertain how the diagnosis was actually achieved. All patients were managed by immobilization in a thumb spica cast for a period of 10-14 d, with repeat clinical assessment and radiographs at that time. The diagnosis of true scaphoid fracture was confirmed radiographically at the time of reassessment or, in the case of persistent tenderness and negative repeat radiographs, by the use of a technetium bone scan. In our study group, only 8 of 54 patients (14.8%) were found to have a final diagnosis of true scaphoid fracture. In 75% (6/8) of these patients, the diagnosis was made by technetium bone scans, as the radiographs remained negative at the time of reassessment. In addition, a bone scan revealed the presence of two previously unsuspected fractures (one distal radius fracture and one triquetral fracture) in two patients with continued clinical tenderness. This study confirms the previously reported low incidence of scaphoid fractures in patients with a diagnosis of clinical scaphoid fracture. It also demonstrates the importance of technetium bone scan as a diagnostic tool of increased sensitivity, as compared to traditional radiographs, in detecting the presence of scaphoid fractures and in detecting other clinically unsuspected fractures in this group of patients."

CD010023,0,10550438,0,[Scaphoid fracture and scaphoid pseudarthrosis].,"Careful diagnostic and early therapy are especially important in cases of scaphoid fractures. This is due to the patients being mostly young and the high number of non-unions of these carpal bones. Conservative and various operative treatments are therapeutical options. Out of the patients who underwent surgery from January 1993 to February 1999 42 patients with a scaphoid fracture and 88 patients with a scaphoid non-union were, in addition to standard X-ray examination, examined clinically and by MRI pre- and post-operatively. Fractures of the scaphoid were treated by Herbert screw fixation. The operative treatment of non-unions of the scaphoid included the transplantation of an iliac crest graft and Herbert screw fixation. Post-operatively a cast-immobilisation was done. Subjective statements of the patients and clinical results were assessed. The classification of Herbert and Fisher (1984)/Filan and Herbert (1996) for X-rays was used. The signal intensities of the MRI in the fragments of the scaphoid were determined qualitatively and quantitatively by computer calculation, comparing the pre- and post-operative results with one another. Post-operative results of the scaphoid fractures were in most cases good and excellent. 67 patients with a scaphoid non-union and 11 with a scaphoid fracture showed a pre-operative diminishing of the signal in the proximal fragment. For these patients, the fusion rate was lower than in patients without pre-operative signal reduction. The examination shows that in most cases bony fusions with good clinical results could be achieved by Herbert screw fixation. The MRI seems to be able to complete the radiological classification of the fractures regarding a prognosis."

CD010023,0,17556000,0,[Numerical variants and congenital fusions of carpal bones].,"The number of carpal bones may be increased or decreased by the fact of anatomical variants or true congenital anomalies. Numerical increment arises from additional or from split bones. Over twenty accessory carpal bones have been described but the commonest are the os centrale carpi, the os radiale externum, the triangular bone and the styloideum bone. Additional carpal bones usually result from a failure of fusion of their ossification centers. A congenital origin is not clearly established for all these ossicles. The scaphoid and lunate may split into two or three bones and several cases of bipartite hamulus of the hamatum have been reported. A carpus with only seven bones results from the congenital absence of a normal bone, which mainly affects the scaphoid, lunate and triquetrum, or from a synostosis between two carpal bones, usually the lunate and triquetrum. Congenital fusions originate from an absence of joint cavitation into the embryo and chondrification of the joint interzone. Numerical carpal variants are uncommon as independent entities but occur with a relative high frequency in association with complex malformations of the hand. These anomalies are detectable on plain radiographs of the wrist, but CT-scan and MR-Imaging are useful to differentiate bipartite and accessory bones from carpal fractures or posttraumatic injuries, carpal fusions having to be distinguished from bony ankylosis."
CD010023,0,9330135,0,Radiographic evaluation of osseous displacement following intra-articular fractures of the distal radius: reliability of plain radiography versus computed tomography.,"This study evaluated the reliability of plain radiography versus computed tomography (CT) for the measurement of small (< 5 mm) intra-articular displacements of distal radius fracture fragments. The plain radiographs and CT scans of 19 acute intra-articular distal radius fractures were used by 5 independent observers, using 2 standardized techniques, to quantify incongruity of the articular surface in a blinded and randomized fashion. Repeat measurements were performed by the same observers 2-4 weeks later, allowing determination of intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) as a measure of intraobserver and interobserver agreement. The average maximum gap displacement on plain radiographs was 2.1 mm (range, 0.0-15.0 mm, lateral view) and on CT images was 4.9 mm (range, 0.7-17.3 mm, axial view). The average maximum step displacement on plain radiographs was 0.9 mm (range, 0.0-6.4 mm, lateral view) and on CT images was 1.2 mm (range, 0.0-6.0 mm, sagittal view). More reproducible values determining step and gap displacement were obtained when the arc method of measurement was used on CT scans (ICC values, .69-.97) as compared to the longitudinal axis method for plain radiographs (ICC values, .30-.50). For measured displacements of 2 mm or more, our data demonstrated poor correlation between measurements made on CT images and those made on plain radiographs (gap or step displacement > 2 mm, K = 0.21; step displacement > 2 mm, K = 0.21). Thirty percent of measurements from plain radiographs significantly underestimated or overestimated displacement compared to CT scan measurements. From these data, we conclude that CT scanning data, using the arc method of measurement, are more reliable for quantifying articular surface incongruities of the distal radius than are plain radiography measurements."
CD010023,0,9330136,0,Kinematics of the scaphoid shift test.,"Twenty-five uninjured subjects (50 wrists) were examined clinically and fluoroscopically during performance of the scaphoid shift test. Wrists were placed into 3 groups on the basis of the degree of palpable carpal motion that occurred during the clinical examination. Kinematic parameters of rotation and displacement were calculated from digitized images of the carpals at rest and at maximum displacement. On clinical exam, 36% of normal individuals had positive findings on scaphoid shift test. Dorsal displacement of the scaphoid was not significantly associated with positive scaphoid shift test results in these subjects, while total displacement of the scaphoid (the sum of axial and dorsal displacement) was significantly associated with positive test results. The principle confounding factor appeared to be a high degree of displacement that occurred at the capitolunate joint in some individuals, termed a ""midcarpal shift."" The data demonstrate that despite a high prevalence of positive scaphoid shifts among uninjured individuals, the ability to accurately detect dorsal displacement of the scaphoid using the scaphoid shift test is limited. On the basis of their findings, the authors recommend that positive test results be confirmed fluoroscopically."
CD010023,0,18092740,0,Point-based rigid-body registration using an unscented Kalman filter.,"We present and validate a novel registration algorithm mapping two data sets, generated from a rigid object, in the presence of Gaussian noise. The proposed method is based on the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) algorithm that is generally employed for analyzing nonlinear systems corrupted by additive Gaussian noise. First, we employ our proposed registration algorithm to fit two randomly generated data sets in the presence of isotropic Gaussian noise, when the corresponding points between the two data sets are assumed to be known. Then, we extend the registration method to the case where the data (with known correspondences) is stimulated by anisotropic Gaussian noise. The new registration method not only reliably converges to the correct registration solution, but it also estimates the variance, as a confidence measure, for each of the estimated registration transformation parameters. Furthermore, we employ the proposed registration algorithm for rigid-body, point-based registration where corresponding points between two registering data sets are unknown. The algorithm is tested on point data sets which are garnered from a pelvic cadaver and a scaphoid bone phantom by means of computed tomography (CT) and tracked free-hand ultrasound imaging. The collected 3-D points in the ultrasound frame are registered to the 3-D meshes in the CT frame by using the proposed and the standard Iterative Closest Points (ICP) registration algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms the ICP registration algorithm in the presence of additive Gaussian noise. It is also shown that the proposed registration algorithm is more robust than the ICP registration algorithm in terms of outliers in data sets and initial misalignment between the two data sets."

The average age of the 42 male and 28 female athletes was 22.6 years. The number of athletes involved in track and field sports was 29 (41.4%), in gymnastics 9 (12.9%) and in soccer 5 (7.1%). The most common bone injured was the tibia in 29 (41.4%), followed by the tarsal navicular in 21 (30.0%), the midfoot in 17 (24.3%) and the fibula in 4 (5.7%) athletes. In three cases double stress fractures were found in adjacent locations; in one case a stress fracture of the opposite navicular occurred after the initial tarsal navicular stress fracture had healed, and in another case the tarsal navicular was found to be fractured again. Thirty-seven percent of the athletes claimed sudden increase in training intensity was the cause; 33% felt that the increased sprinting and jump activities were the reason for their complaints. In some athletes pain started after an ankle sprain. Standard diagnostic procedure consisted in X-rays in two planes and three-phase bone scanning. In tarsal navicular or tibial locations additional tomograms were performed. MRI and CT scans were reserved for unclear findings and to exclude the possibility of a tumorous or inflammatory process. A new grading system was introduced that covers all forms of stress reactions from periostitis to pseudarthrosis. Clinical symptoms, sport disabilities, radiological and bone scan findings were graded from A to D. Using a modified Wilson classification, all radiologically recognizable stress reactions could be classified.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

A CT bone scan in the long axis of the scaphoid is the best means of differentiating between stable and unstable fractures. This is difficult from conventional X-rays due to the particular three-dimensional anatomy of the scaphoid. To avoid long-term plaster immobilization and to diminish the risk of a nonunion, unstable fractures of type B should be fixed operatively. With headless screws such as the Herbert screw, which are now available in a cannulated shape, the majority of scaphoid fractures of type B1 and B2 can be stabilized using minimally invasive procedures. Severely displaced fractures require the classical open palmar approach. Proximal pole fractures (B3) are best managed from the dorsal approach, using the Mini-Herbert screw.

CD010023,0,8850152,0,Radiology of sports-related injuries.,"Participation in organized sports and fitness activity continues to increase in the United States. As a result, more acute bone and soft-tissue injuries are occurring in this patient population. Chronic overuse syndromes are also more common today. It is important for radiologists to understand the mechanism of injury so that they can properly approach the imaging of these patients. Although magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is frequently the technique of choice, other imaging methods are also important and may, in certain cases, be preferred to MRI. In this review, we discuss extremity injuries by anatomic region. The spine is not included. A tailored imaging approach to each anatomic region and type of injury is discussed."
CD010023,0,15142688,0,Arthroscopic findings in wrists with severe post-traumatic pain despite normal standard radiographs.,"This study assessed the role of diagnostic arthroscopy following a wrist injury in patients with normal standard radiographs, an unclear clinical diagnosis and persistent severe pain at 4 to 12 weeks. Forty-three patients were included after conservative management had failed to improve their wrist pain so that a stability test could be performed satisfactorily and underwent arthroscopy within 12 weeks. Arthroscopy revealed recent pathology in 41 wrists, of which 17 had significant ligament lesions that might have benefited from acute repair. We conclude that patients with marked persistent post-traumatic symptoms despite conservative management are likely to have sustained ligament injuries despite normal radiographs. We therefore recommend that under these circumstances an arthroscopy is carried out within 4 weeks if the patient and surgeon wish to acutely repair significant ligament injuries."
CD010023,0,3390770,0,New clinical test for fracture of the scaphoid.,The authors noted that in patients with scaphoid fractures pronation of the affected wrist followed by ulnar deviation produces pain in the anatomic snuff box that is not present in those without a scaphoid fracture. They therefore evaluated this test prospectively in 73 patients. The test gave a 52% positive predictive value and a 100% negative predictive value. They recommend that the test may be used with confidence in the emergency department to exclude a scaphoid fracture in patients with clinical features suggesting scaphoid injury but a normal x-ray film. Use of this test would reduce the number of patients whose wrists are needlessly immobilized in a scaphoid cast.
CD010023,0,12203148,0,[Distal radius fractures and concomitant lesions. Experimental studies concerning the pathomechanism].,"Since Colles (1814) first described a distal radius fracture and the publication by Dupuytren (1834), the frequency of and problems surrounding these fractures were increasingly recognised. Not only the treatment but also the formation and type of fracture were repeatedly analysed. The various theories concerning the pathomechanism led to names such as: ""tear fracture"", ""bend fracture"", ""thrust fracture"", ""compression fracture"", ""snap fracture"" and others. In our experimental studies we attempted to simulate the pathomechanism of distal radius fractures and present them pictorially. With the help of a materials testing machine, 63 prepared cadaver arms were hyperextended in the wrist joint until a radius fracture occurred. The concomitant lesions were registered radiologically and by dissection. Moreover, additional cadaver arms were deep-frozen and examined by means of computer tomography and cryosection according to Kathrein. Through experimental hyperextension it was possible to generate dorsal, central, and palmar types of fractures. We produced 42 dorsal, 14 central and 7 palmar fractures. Fundamentally, it seems that the fracture depends on the extent in which the carpal bones of the proximal row are pressed against the dorsal, central or palmar part of the articular surface of the distal radius. The subsequent dissection showed in 40 cases (63 %) mostly multiple concomitant lesions and in 23 cases (37 %) none of these. The reason for concomitant lesions may be the proportion of bone stability to the strength of ligaments. Most frequently (27 cases, i.e. 43 %), we found a destabilisation of the articular disk with or without a bony avulsion fragment (fracture of the ulnar styloid). We also commonly found ruptures of the interosseous ligaments between scaphoid and lunate (20 cases, i.e. 32 %) and lunate and triquetrum (11 cases, i.e. 18 %). It is difficult to apply knowledge gained from experimental studies on preserved cadaver arms clinically. There are of course no physiological reflexes and the slow fracture process must be taken into consideration. This holds true not only for concomitant lesions but also for the type of fracture. On the other hand, in these experimental studies it was possible to generate many realistic types of fractures with their concomitant lesions."

We present two boys with nonunion and avascular necrosis of the scaphoid treated by simple immobilisation. Both cases healed with painless wrists and full movements. Our cases confirm that an ununited scaphoid fracture in children may heal with conservative treatment, even when an MRI scan suggests avascular necrosis. Unlike in adults, operative treatment need only be considered in children when conservative treatment fails."

This rare incidental skeletal variant has an estimated prevalence of 1%. It may rarely become symptomatic and should not be confused with cortical avulsion fractures of navicular or talar head. We present the case of a 25-year-old professional basketball player with pain on the dorsum of his right foot after twisting his ankle during a regular season match. Magnetic resonance imaging findings of the player's foot represented a flake of bone on the superior part of the talar head.

CD010023,0,9283841,0,Trauma of the wrist.,"In wrist injury, plain radiographs form the basis of diagnostic imaging, and can provide definitive answers in most cases. MR imaging is the method of choice for several diagnostic problem cases. These problems can include radiographically occult fractures where MRI enables early diagnosis compared to follow-up radiographs. Early stage diagnosis of a post-traumatic avascular osteonecrosis with high sensitivity and specificity, is only possible with MRI. In these instances, radiographs are only sensitive in later stages and scintigraphy is quite nonspecific. Stress fractures, invisible with other modalities, are also demonstrable with MRI. In addition, MRI is helpful in special circumstances with regard to non-union or pseudarthrosis. In wrist instability, radiographs in combination with stress views and fluoroscopy are still the initial diagnostic step. MRI, with the advantage of direct visualization of the wrist ligaments and triangular fibrocartilage complex, offers very promising results in this area. Generally, for the evaluation of wrist injury, MRI can be considered the most important second-step procedure in patients where radiographs are nondiagnostic."
CD010023,0,8676426,1,Magnetic resonance imaging of occult scaphoid fractures.,"Occult fractures of the scaphoid bone occur frequently and may lead to nonunions. In a prospective blind study, we performed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations on 32 patients who had sustained a wrist injury and in whom a scaphoid fracture was clinically suspected, but could not be confirmed on the original set of two routine and four scaphoid view radiographs. The MRI examinations were performed an average time of 2.8 days after the trauma. This prospective study proved that MRI is able to diagnose occult scaphoid fractures without delay and without the use of radioactive diagnostic means. Sensitivity and specificity of MRI were 100%. This conventional method could save $7,200 (US) per 100,000 inhabitants in providing an immediate and correct diagnosis and avoiding unnecessary cast immobilization. Additional injuries that may be misdiagnosed by conventional radiographs are also detected with a specificity and sensitivity of 100%."

CD010023,0,11884109,0,A comparison of the findings of wrist arthroscopy and magnetic resonance imaging in the investigation of wrist pain.,"Between 1996 and 1999, 54 patients with wrist pain had magnetic resonance imaging performed using a 1.5 Tesla scanner without a wrist coil. Wrist arthroscopy was performed using a standard technique. The findings were then compared. Magnetic resonance imaging had a low sensitivity for the detection of triangular fibrocartilage complex injuries (0.44) and scapholunate ligament injuries (0.11) when wrist arthroscopy was used as the standard of reference. We conclude that when a magnetoresonance technique that does not employ a dedicated wrist coil is used, a negative magnetic resonance imaging scan does not exclude these two significant injuries."

Carefully made standard views will provide recognizable projections of carpal bones in order to judge abnormal positions. Additional views, conventional tomography and CT scans are, in some instances, necessary to diagnose fractures. For ligamentous damage resulting in carpal instability, fluoroscopy of the wrist and/or an arthrogram should be obtained. Examples of difficult pathology are shown and variations or more or less borderline pathology as coincidental findings are discussed. The main pitfalls are: wrong diagnosis made on inappropriately taken radiographs; misinterpretation of carpal bone relationships; and overestimation of some arthrographically found abnormalities."

CD010023,0,16716469,0,Diagnostic strategy for suspected scaphoid fractures in the presence of other fractures in the carpal region.,"Bone scintigraphy will identify up to 25% of occult scaphoid bone fractures after negative scaphoid X-rays. Consequently, it deserves a place in the diagnostic process of suspected scaphoid fractures. However, the role of bone scintigraphy is less clear if scaphoid X-rays show other fractures in the carpal region. We analysed 111 consecutive patients with a suspected scaphoid fracture on physical examination. Scaphoid X-rays revealed 61 fractures. Fifty-five patients had scaphoid fractures only and six patients had other fractures in the carpal region but no scaphoid fracture. In 50 cases, no bone injury was seen on these X-rays. In three out of the six patients with other fractures in the carpal region, bone scintigraphy revealed four occult concomitant fractures: one scaphoid, one scaphoid and trapezial and one capitate fracture. In conclusion, bone scintigraphy is required when scaphoid X-rays do not confirm a suspected scaphoid fracture, even in the presence of other fractures in the carpal region."

CD010023,0,10420289,0,[Long-term outcome of reconstruction of proximal scaphoid pseudarthroses with Matti-Russe-plasty].,"Thirty-two patients who were treated with Matti-Russe grafts between 1985 and 1995 after a fracture of the proximal scaphoid pole were examined in a retrospective study. The purpose of the study was the evaluation of the long-term results of functional outcome, radiological results, and postoperative quality of life. Main object of the study was to clarify whether the development of carpal collapse is inevitable or if it is correlated to the persistence of bony nonunion. Measured parameters were: grip strength and range of motion, pain was evaluated with a visual analog scale from 0 to 100 (VAS). The analysis of the X-rays was carried out with a special wrist-score that was developed for the 1997 meeting of the German Speaking Society for Surgery of the Hand (DAH). The functional outcome was evaluated with the DASH-questionnaire. Twenty-nine patients were male, three were female. In 22 patients the right hand was involved, in ten patients the operation was performed on the left hand. The average follow-up period was 66 months. Bony union was achieved in 26 cases, six patients still demonstrated a persistent nonunion. The mean postoperative pain score was 1.8 (non-stress) and 42.5 (stress) in patients with scaphoid union. Active range of motion and grip strength were 90% compared to the contralateral side, the DASH-score reached 12.73. Only in persistent nonunion an advanced carpal collapse could be detected. The results show the reliability of the Matti-Russe graft in nonunion of fractures of the proximal pole of the scaphoid. Alternative treatment options have no advantages in bony union. The disadvantage of the Matti-Russe graft is the long period of immobilisation."

CD010023,0,11775468,0,Percutaneous fixation of scaphoid fractures.,"The scaphoid proximal pole and waist fractures presented here were treated by a novel dorsal percutaneous technique with arthroscopic assistance. All fractures healed, with good final functional results and no complications. The advantages of the dorsal percutaneous approach to scaphoid fixation are: (1) the proximal-to-distal placement of the guide pin and screw allow for more precise placement along the central axis of the scaphoid, which decreases healing time and reduces risk of screw thread exposure. (2) The dorsal approach avoids injuring the vulnerable volar ligament anatomy. And (3) the insertion of the screw from the proximal to distal direction allows the more rigid fixation of proximal scaphoid fractures. Arthroscopy allows confirmation of fracture reduction and screw implantation as well as evaluation of concurrent ligament injuries not detected with standard imaging. Percutaneous K-wires act as joysticks to reduce and compress fracture fragments prior to fixation. The presented technique allows for early, rigid internal fixation with minimal associated morbidity. Patients successfully treated with this technique include those with stable and unstable acute fractures of the scaphoid at all locations, including the proximal pole. Nondisplaced fractures that present with delayed or fibrous union without evidence of avascular necrosis, cyst formation, or bony sclerosis may also be treated with this technique. This technique allows for faster rehabilitation and an earlier return to work or avocation without restriction once CT scan confirms a solid union. Some articles document extraordinary rapid healing by standard radiographs; however, we caution that scaphoid bone healing cannot accurately be determined without CT scan. Percutaneous, arthroscopically assisted internal fixation by a dorsal approach may be considered in all acute scaphoid fractures selected for surgical fixation. The dorsal guidewire permits dorsal and volar implantation of a cannulated screw along the central axis of the scaphoid. This technique permits the reduction of displaced fractures and the stable repair of fractures of the proximal pole. In addition, selected scaphoid fibrous union or delayed union may also be repaired, with realistic expectations of healing. The proven benefits of the percutaneous technique include decreased soft tissue trauma; arthroscopic visualization of the fracture, ensuring anatomic reduction; and stable fixation, allowing early physical rehabilitation. The theoretical benefits of the technique include decreased risk of interruption of the tenuous scaphoid blood supply. Percutaneous internal fixation of scaphoid fractures provides faster rehabilitation, earlier return to work, and quicker bony union in most patients."

However, it is often difficult to assess on plain radiographs, particularly in the sagittal plane, as visualized on the lateral view. The purposes of this study were to establish normal values for the lunate-lunate facet ratio (LLFR) and to evaluate whether the LLFR and lunate-lunate facet variance (LLFV) are reliable plain film measures of sagittal articular gap in distal radius fractures compared with sagittal reconstructions of computed tomography (CT) scans."
CD010023,0,2211858,0,Fractures and ligamentous injuries of the wrist.,"Rapid diagnosis, appropriate management, and sport-specific rehabilitation are important in the management of any wrist injury in the athlete. The addition of technetium scans, CT, arthroscopy, and MRI in the evaluation of the athlete's wrist has provided valuable and powerful diagnostic tools. The versatility and relatively low invasiveness of arthroscopic intervention and the subsequent early return to activity make this technique especially attractive in the high-performance athlete. Suspicion of potential injuries, complete knowledge of wrist mechanics and anatomy, and a careful physical examination are still the most important tools in the evaluation of wrist injury. It is important to approach each athlete in a patient-oriented manner, taking into account the fact that many of these injuries have the potential to be career ending. Treatment that will provide the best possible long-term wrist function must be the physician's ultimate goal. In addition, the importance of appropriate and activity-specific rehabilitation cannot be overemphasized."
CD010023,0,6544813,0,Three-phase bone studies in hemiplegia with reflex sympathetic dystrophy and the effect of disuse.,"Eighty-five patients with cerebral vascular accidents were assessed with three-phase bone scintigraphy of the hands and with whole-body delayed bone imaging. Nine patients (10%) had normal three-phase bone images. Fifty-five patients (65%) showed decreased blood flow and blood-pool images of the hands and wrists with normal delayed bone scintigrams, indicating the effect of paralysis or disuse. Twenty-one patients (25%) had diffuse increased uptake with periarticular accentuation, felt to be bone-scintigraphic evidence of reflex sympathetic dystrophy of the hands and wrists; in two patients this occurred before its clinical appearance. Thirteen of the 21 reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndromes (RDS)-involved limbs (62%) had increased blood flow, whereas 8 (38%) had decreased flow. Gross limb blood flow appears to be related to the degree of muscle activity, but flow may be altered by the presence of sympathetic changes. A possible dissociation between whole-limb flow and bone blood flow in paralyzed limbs involved with RDS is discussed. The elbow was involved in only one case, and a true ""shoulder-hand"" distribution was seen in only 11 of 21 cases (52%). Five patients (6%) had leg involvement on whole-body imaging. Traumatic synovitis of the wrist, and trauma to subluxed shoulders, could be recognized on the delayed study."

Initial radiographs suggested dorsal transscaphoid-transtriquetral perilunate dislocation. Traditionally, however, this injury is the result of a high-energy impact. A CT scan obtained after closed reduction of the dislocation revealed not only a fresh fracture of the triquetrum but also two corticalized fragments of the scaphoid. A former major fall on this hand and a normal scaphoid of the other hand made pseudarthrosis more likely than scaphoid bipartition. Arthrography revealed intact lunotriquetral and scapholunate ligaments, precluding the possibility of preexisting ligamentous instability. Pseudarthrosis of the scaphoid with a loss of scaphoid function as a mechanical tie-rod of the carpus is most likely responsible for this complex injury. This is the first clinical study that shows that single scaphoid discontinuity without preexisting ligamentous carpal instability may lead to complex perilunar dislocation in minor trauma."

CD010023,0,11775467,0,Closed cast treatment of scaphoid fractures.,"Cast immobilization of the wrist remains the treatment of choice for stable fractures of the waist and distal pole of the scaphoid. Criteria for diagnosis of stability should be stringent; plain radiographs may be misleading. CT may provide more accurate information on displacement. Immobilization of the thumb confers no advantage and restricts function unnecessarily. Evidence to support immobilization of the elbow is weak, but it may be useful for selected fractures. A cast does not protect the carpus from the effects of axial loading, which can produce large angulatory forces at the fracture. A gap or fracture offset of 1 mm or more are indicators of instability with potential for nonunion or malunion; internal fixation should be considered for these fractures. Internal fixation may also be considered routinely for proximal pole fractures, regardless of the degree of displacement, in view of their long healing time and high risk of nonunion after cast treatment."
CD010023,0,11775466,0,Effects of scaphoid fractures on the biomechanics of the wrist.,"Scaphoid fractures are the most commonly fractured carpal bone. They most often occur from a fall on dorsiflexed, radially deviated wrist. The severity of the fall and position of the wrist influence the fracture pattern and the extent of ligamentous damage. Recent studies have correlated fracture pattern stability and any associated ligamentous disruption with the degree of alternation of wrist biomechanics. It is well documented that instability and altered kinematics can lead to nonunion and abnormal joint loads, which then can accelerate the onset of arthritis. Understanding these biomechanical consequences is critical when managing scaphoid fractures."

Fourteen patients clinically showed growth arrest, and 10 patients required a Langenskiold operation. In 3 patients who underwent this operation, subsequent premature total fusion of the physis adversely affected the postoperative results. We propose that the merging shape of the arrest line with calcification of the provisional zone of the metaphysis shown by MRI indicates poor viability of the physis.

Open reduction with screw fixation of the scaphoid, plating of the proximal ulna and Kirschner wiring of the distal radius and radial head dislocation were done."

The work included 13 scaphoid malunions in 13 patients. All patients complained of weak painful hand grip and limitation of wrist function. All cases were subjected to a corrective opening wedge scaphoid osteotomy with insertion of a trapezoid-shaped tricortical iliac bone graft. At the final assessment, after a mean follow-up period of 42 months, the achieved results were rated excellent in seven cases, good in four and fair in two according to the scoring system used. Objectively, the mean range of wrist motion and hand grip strength improved from 48% and 47% pre-operatively to 82% and 79% at the final assessment. Radiological parameters including height to length ratio, lateral intrascaphoid angle and dorsal cortical angle were also effectively improved. The intra-operative corrected carpal alignment has almost been maintained at the final follow-up. The procedure did not have serious drawbacks such as non-union or avascular necrosis and perhaps might delay the development of degenerative arthritis of the wrist."

Although MRI and intraoperative findings matched in 19 patients, there was no correlation in 13 patients. While 7 of these latter patients showed normal MRI but no punctate bleeding during the operation, the remaining 6 had preoperative MRI of avascularity but punctate bleeding during the operation. After internal fixation and bone grafting, all but 1 of these 13 patients achieved union. We conclude that the diagnosis of avascular necrosis should only be made when both MRI and intraoperative findings indicate avascularity."

CD010023,0,3085566,0,Should perimenopausal women be screened for osteoporosis?,"The increasing availability of noninvasive methods for measuring bone mass raises the issue of whether perimenopausal women should routinely have such measurements to identify those at risk for osteoporotic fractures of the hip, wrist, and spine. Although the mortality and morbidity caused by hip fractures would warrant routine screening, measurement of bone mass has uncertain value in assessing the risk for hip fracture. Wrist fractures generally cause only transient disability, and measurement of bone mass may not reliably predict risk. Measurements of bone density of the spine might be better able to assess a woman's risk for vertebral fractures, but the value of screening depends on whether the findings would affect a woman's decision about using estrogen therapy after menopause. Serial measurements of bone mass to estimate a woman's rate of bone loss are relatively imprecise, increase the cost of screening, and have at best a limited role in screening women to assess risk for osteoporotic fractures."

CD010023,0,8153501,0,Tarsal navicular stress fracture in athletes.,"Stress fracture of the tarsal navicular bone is now frequently recognised. The majority of navicular stress fractures are partial fractures in the sagittal plane. They occur mainly in track and field athletes. A number of theories regarding the aetiology of this fracture have been proposed. Athletes with a history of vague, activity-related midfoot pain, with associated tenderness over the dorsal proximal navicular ('N' spot) should be suspected of having a navicular stress fracture. Plain radiography frequently fails to demonstrate the fracture, thus radionuclide scanning is the investigation of choice to detect navicular stress injury. A computed tomography (CT) scan should be performed to confirm the presence of the fracture. Various methods of treatment have been employed. A minimum of 6 weeks of strict non-weightbearing cast immobilisation is the treatment of choice. After removal of the cast, a further 6 week programme of rehabilitation with a graduated return to activity, joint mobilisation and soft tissue massage is required. Surgery for nonunion or delayed union is rarely required if initial treatment is appropriate."

All wrists lacked clinically evident DRUJ instability. An attempt to apply the three geometric criteria to seven of the cases was not possible, since the prescribed landmarks were not visible. The remaining 43 cases were retrospectively divided into a symptomatic group (25 wrists), with clinical abnormalities referable to the ulnar side of the wrist, and an asymptomatic group (18 wrists), with no such abnormalities. Abnormal DRUJ geometry was found in 12 symptomatic and 2 asymptomatic wrists. This difference between the groups is significant (p = 0.02), suggesting that many symptomatic wrists exhibit different DRUJ geometry than is found in most asymptomatic wrists."

The purpose of this study was to determine if DRUJ congruency and mechanics were altered in patients with malunited distal radius fractures. In nine subjects with unilateral malunions, interbone distances and dorsal and palmar radioulnar ligament lengths were computed from tomographic images of both forearms in multiple forearm positions using markerless bone registration (MBR) techniques. The significance of the changes were assessed using a generalized linear model, which controlled for forearm rotation angle (-60 degrees to 60 degrees ). In the malunited forearm, compared to the contralateral uninjured arm, we found that ulnar joint space area significantly decreased by approximately 25%, the centroid of this area moved an average of 1.3 mm proximally, and the dorsal radioulnar ligament elongated. Despite our previous findings of insignificant changes in the pattern of radioulnar kinematics in patients with malunited fractures, we found significant changes in DRUJ joint area and ligament lengthening. These findings suggest that alterations in joint mechanics and soft tissues may play an important role in the dysfunction associated with these injuries."

CD010023,0,7799763,0,Wrist problems in the tennis player.,"Although wrist injuries in tennis may occur from acute direct trauma, most injuries occur due to chronic overuse. Wrist biomechanics in tennis indicate that a wide range of wrist motion may not be necessary for effective play. The nature of the injury should be established as early as possible with the goals of restoring the wrist to a pain-free stable unit with normal range of motion. A secondary goal is to return the athlete to play as quickly as possible. Key points of the athlete's history are acute or chronic onset, progressive symptoms, and severity of symptoms, i.e., limitation of play. Key points of the physical examination include localization of maximal tenderness, edema, loss of range of motion, and bilateral grip strength. Plain roentgenograms should always be obtained. Specific imaging studies may be indicated and include bone scan, computed tomography, and arthrography. Specific and common wrist tennis injuries are discussed and treatment recommendations are given. Wrist problems in tennis are no uncommon and are responsible for a significant amount of lost playing time. Familiarity with the more common problems will enhance the physician's ability to evaluate and treat these athletes."

CD010023,0,20185138,0,Statistical descriptions of scaphoid and lunate bone shapes.,"Diagnosing of injuries of the wrist bones is problematic due to a highly complex and variable geometry. knowledge of variations of healthy bone shapes is essential to detect wrist pathologies, developing prosthetics and investigating biomechanical properties of the wrist joint. In previous literature various methods have been proposed to classify different scaphoid and lunate types. These classifications were mainly qualitative or were based on a limited number of manually determined surface points. The purposes of this study are to develop a quantitative, standardized description of the variations in the scaphoid and lunate and to investigate whether it is feasible to divide carpal bones in isolated shape categories based on statistical grounds. The shape variations of the scaphoid and lunate were described by constructing a statistical shape model (SSM) of healthy bones. SSM shape parameters were determined that describe the deviation of each shape from the mean shape. The first five modes of variation in the SSMs describe 60% of the total variance of the scaphoid and 57% of the lunate. Higher modes describe less than 5% of the variance per mode. The distributions of the parameters that characterize the bone shape variations along the modes do not significantly differ from a normal distribution. The SSM provides a description of possible shape variations and the distribution of scaphoid and lunate shapes in our population at an accuracy of approximately the voxel size (0.3x0.3x0.3mm(3)). The developed statistical shape model represents the previously qualitatively described variations of scaphoid and lunate. However, strict classifications based on shape differences are not feasible on statistical grounds."
CD010023,0,8501378,0,An algorithm for acute wrist trauma.

In a 6-month period 641 patients aged 15 years or over were examined using an algorithm for acute wrist trauma in order to secure early and appropriate treatment. In 293 (46%) cases routine radiographic examination supplied sufficient information to establish a fracture diagnosis. All 33 scaphoid fractures (including five scaphoid non-unions) were demonstrated on the initial X-ray examination. In 56 patients (9%) scintigraphy proved useful for selecting cases in need of further radiographic examination. Among 31 patients with focal activity on bone scintigraphy, CT and/or tomography revealed eight distal radial fractures, one fracture of the ulnar styloid, and eight fractures of carpal bones. Fractures were revealed using tomography and/or ""hot spot views"" in patients with negative CT examinations suggesting that further examinations should be performed in cases with increased focal activity on bone scintigraphy and a negative CT examination."
CD010023,0,9055127,0,The value of additional carpal box radiographs in suspected scaphoid fracture.,"Carpal Box (CB) radiographs, transverse and longitudinal, produce elongated and magnified views of the carpus. These radiographs can be used after carpal injury, in addition to conventional scaphoid x-rays. In this study, the use of CB radiographs was evaluated in patients with possible scaphoid fracture."
CD010023,0,4091605,0,Distal radioulnar involvement in trauma of the wrist.,"The distal radioulnar joint is the weakest point of the rotational column of the wrist. This joint is a functional part of the radiocarpal joint, united to it by an elastic tightening system, and perfectly controlled by the ulnaris (especially the extensor carpi) tendons. Our anatomic study allowed to define the mechanisms of the lesions and the methods for their correction. The key to success seems to be a functionally dynamic extensor carpi ulnaris and its dorsal position in supination. Our clinical study shows that all injuries to the distal radioulnar joint associated with trauma of the wrist or of the forearm are a factor of severity and they may be responsible for the high rate of complications. Therefore, in Galeazzi's fracture-dislocation, a specific method of stabilization may need to be associated with the radius osteosynthesis. In the absence of degenerative changes, chronic instability of the distal radioulnar joint can benefit from ligament stabilization. Results so far have been very encouraging, as far as young patients are concerned. Complex injuries remain a major obstacle, in which ligamentous and bone lesions must be distinguished by confronting clinical observation with paraclinical investigations. Computerized tomography seems to be of limited value, although this method of investigation is still in its prospective stages. Concerning management, shortening of the ulna with dorsal repositioning of the extensor carpi ulnaris allows to decompress the carpo-ulnar compartment, to stretch the tendinous and ligamentous structures, and, if need, to restore radioulnar congruity. Better knowledge of this pathology will allow to categorize radioulnar tears associated with wrist injuries. Under emergency conditions, surgical or non operative management must be adapted, allowing healing to occur with perfect restoration of the distal epiphysis of the radius. By doing so good functional results may be guaranteed."
CD010023,0,3737140,0,Injuries to the distal radioulnar joint.,"Disorders of the distal radioulnar joint can be divided into those secondary to ligamentous injuries, fractures, and arthritis changes. Further classification of the first two categories relates to acute versus chronic problems. Acute radioulnar joint disruption can, for the most part, be diagnosed on the basis of early physical examination, radiographic evaluation, and a high index of suspicion. Early recognition and the institution of satisfactory treatment are the hallmarks of a successful result. Those injuries seen after 8 weeks can be termed chronic problems, and further diagnostic evaluation beyond physical examination and routine radiographs includes wrist arthrography, arthroscopy, tomograms, and CT scans. These disorders are certainly much more difficult to treat; however, a systematic assessment with a full knowledge of the anatomy and biomechanics is helpful in preventing arthritis as the late sequela of distal radioulnar joint abnormality. Surgical treatment may be necessary in many of these situations but must be tempered to the needs and demands of the individual patient."
CD010023,0,2763950,0,Occult fractures of the carpals and metacarpals: demonstration by CT.,"Occult fractures of the carpals and metacarpals occur frequently and are associated with major disability. The cross-sectional display and superior resolution of CT are well suited to the demonstration of these fractures. Sixteen patients with pain and negative conventional radiographs were chosen for further evaluation by CT. Imaging was performed in two planes and showed 21 fractures. The transaxial plane was the most revealing imaging plane. Coronal imaging was equal or superior to the transaxial plane in most fractures of the scaphoid, lunate, capitate, and pisiform bones and of the bases of the metacarpal bones. The direct sagittal plane was the best imaging plane in one patient with fractures of the scaphoid and lunate bones. After discovery of the fracture on CT, surgical removal of the avulsed fracture fragment was recommended in seven patients and fusion was recommended in three. Eight patients had a marked decrease in pain after the surgical procedure. The accuracy of CT for the demonstration of occult fractures may result in earlier recognition of these fractures and a reduction in the associated disability."

A literature search revealed limited documentation of normal biometric measurements and no validation of scaphoid anatomic symmetry. A study was performed to provide normative data and evaluate the right-to-left symmetry of specific geometric measurements of the scaphoid. One hundred normal carpal scaphoid bones in 30 healthy subjects and 40 patients were examined with three-dimensional magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Standardized oblique projections were reconstructed from each three-dimensional data set, and seven biometric measurements of each scaphoid were obtained. Normative data from the study group were obtained by means of analysis of all 100 scaphoids. Right-to-left symmetry was validated with the biometric measurements of both scaphoids in the healthy subjects. These data validate scaphoid symmetry and provide 95% confidence intervals for specific biometric measurements that are used for preoperative planning of surgical reconstruction of scaphoid nonunions."
CD010023,0,21586765,0,Assessment of the suspected fracture of the scaphoid.,"A suspected fracture of the scaphoid remains difficult to manage despite advances in knowledge and imaging methods. Immobilisation and restriction of activities in a young and active patient must be balanced against the risks of nonunion associated with an undiagnosed and undertreated fracture of the scaphoid. The assessment of diagnostic tests for a suspected fracture of the scaphoid must take into account two important factors. First, the prevalence of true fractures among suspected fractures is low, which greatly reduces the probability that a positive test will correspond with a true fracture, as false positives are nearly as common as true positives. This situation is accounted for by Bayesian statistics. Secondly, there is no agreed reference standard for a true fracture, which necessitates the need for an alternative method of calculating diagnostic performance characteristics, based upon a statistical method which identifies clinical factors tending to associate (latent classes) in patients with a high probability of fracture. The most successful diagnostic test to date is MRI, but in low-prevalence situations the positive predictive value of MRI is only 88%, and new data have documented the potential for false positive scans. The best strategy for improving the diagnosis of true fractures among suspected fractures of the scaphoid may well be to develop a clinical prediction rule incorporating a set of demographic and clinical factors which together increase the pre-test probability of a fracture of the scaphoid, in addition to developing increasingly sophisticated radiological tests."
CD010023,0,3768974,0,Fractures and dislocations of the carpal bones.,"The most common wrist fractures in athletes are fractures of the scaphoid and fractures of the hook of the hamate. Accurate diagnosis and conservative treatment are extremely important. A physician should not compromise principles of treatment for a rapid return of the athlete to competition, because all too often this will jeopardize eventual recovery and his or her future career. It is far better to be conservative, to insist upon complete recovery before permitting competition, especially in high-school and college students, and to be more concerned with the athlete's potential achievements than immediate accomplishments. These axioms are especially applicable when treating young individuals with suspected or proven wrist injuries."
CD010023,0,10098077,0,Intra-articular fractures of the distal aspect of the radius.,"Intra-articular distal radius fractures are a heterogeneous group of injuries with different fracture patterns. The existing classification systems are helpful for describing the fractures but not for assessing their stability or for deciding which surgical approach to use. Patients who have a fracture with at least 1.0 mm of displacement of the articular surface may benefit from open surgical treatment. Improved diagnostic imaging with CT is helpful for fracture classification and surgical planning. The options for surgical treatment include limited open reduction and internal fixation, arthroscopically assisted internal fixation, and open reduction and internal fixation. The surgical approach is determined on the basis of the initial displacement of the fracture. Patients who have a displaced fracture of the volar rim may benefit from a volar approach; those who have a dorsally displaced fracture, from a dorsal approach; and those who have an impacted fracture such as a die-punch fracture, from a dorsal approach that provides better visualization of the articular surface. The long-term functional outcome is determined in part by the severity of the fracture as defined by the amount of comminution, the initial severity of displacement, and the number of fracture fragments. The accuracy of the reconstruction of the articular surface, with the goal of establishing congruency to within 1.0 mm, is also important in order to minimize the risk of late osteoarthrosis. Of all of the extra-articular parameters, restoration of the length of the radius is the most important for enhancing recovery of motion and grip strength and for preventing problems involving the distal radioulnar joint--the so-called forgotten joint in distal radial fractures."

We studied 160 patients, 35 of whom had initially positive radiographs and were treated in a cast for 12 weeks. The other 125 had bone scintigraphy and were managed according to the result. After a minimum of one year 119 patients were reviewed. Scintigraphically suspected scaphoid fracture could not be confirmed radiologically in 25%. There were no cases of nonunion.

The sensitivities for the SST, the BALLOT, and the UMTDG were 69%, 64%, and 66%, respectively. The specificities for the SST, the BALLOT, and the UMTDG were 66%, 44%, and 64%, respectively. The positive predictive values for the SST, the BALLOT, and the UMTDG were 48%, 24%, and 58%, respectively. The negative predictive values for the SST, the BALLOT, and the UMTDG were 78%, 81%, and 69%, respectively. These wrist provocative tests were efficient for identifying patients who needed a more detailed diagnostic workup and possible arthroscopic inspection. Of those patients who needed arthroscopic inspection, the provocative tests proved to be more efficient at predicting the absence of injury than at predicting its presence."

Fractures of the scaphoid were treated by Herbert screw fixation. The operative treatment of nonunions of the scaphoid included the transplantation of an iliac crest graft and Herbert screw fixation. In all cases, an MRI of the carpus in a low-field MRI was carried out pre-operatively in addition to standard X-ray examination. Post-operatively, all patients were again controlled by MRI within defined intervals. The signal intensities of the MRI in the fragments of the scaphoid were determined qualitatively and quantitatively by computer calculation, comparing the pre- and post-operative results with one another. It was possible to depict the entire scaphoid and to determine the signal intensities of the proximal and distal fragments after Herbert screw fixation due to reduced artefacts on T1-weighted images in all cases. 41 patients with scaphoid nonunion and five patients with a scaphoid fracture showed a pre-operative diminishing of the signal in the proximal fragment compared to the distal fragment. For these patients, the fusion rate was lower than in patients without pre-operative signal reduction."

CD010023,0,15062216,0,Stress fractures of the tarsal navicular.,"Tarsal navicular stress fractures present a difficult diagnostic and treatment dilemma for the orthopedic physician of an active individual. Patients often complain of diffuse, poorly-defined symptoms and have a paucity of physical findings. Initial diagnostic evaluation often. fails to recognize navicular stress fractures which results in delayed diagnosis and treatment. A bone scan is sensitive in detecting this entity and the clinician should use this examination in any patient who is suspected of having a navicular stress fracture. After a navicular stress fracture is confirmed, a CT scan is required to identify the extent of the fracture. The progression of navicular stress fractures is fairly predictable; treatment can be tailored based on the needs of the individual as well as the stage of presentation. Nonsurgical and surgical options are effective treatments for this disorder."

The diagnosis is determined by careful physical and radiological examinations, including conventional radiographs. Computed tomography can be helpful in detecting such lesions. In our opinion, the high risk of post-traumatic arthrosis because of carpal instability in a osteoligamental injury requires operative reconstruction in nearly all cases.

CD010023,0,12494385,0,[Narrowing of the third extensor tendon compartment in minimal displaced distal radius fractures with impending rupture of the EPL tendon].,"Delayed ruptures of the extensor pollicis longus tendon (EPL) occur in about 0.7 percent following undisplaced distal radius fractures. Two possible mechanisms are mainly discussed in the literature: A mechanical irritation of the tendon caused by a sharp edge of the fractured bone and a direct microvascular compromise of the poorly vascularized tendon. In undisplaced fractures, however, a mechanical irritation seems less likely. In the cases here described we were able to demonstrate a fragment displacement in the area of Lister's tubercle suspected by the native X-ray and further evaluated by a CT scan. The use of CT scans even in minor displaced distal radius fractures involving Lister's tubercle may demonstrate a direct contact of the EPL tendon with a sharp edge of this fractured bone and make adequate surgery possible."
CD010023,0,22648427,0,Pathology of extrinsic ligaments: a pictorial essay.,"The role of the extrinsic ligaments, together with the intrinsic ligaments, appears to be much more important than previously thought in the setting of carpal stability. The anatomy and pathology of the extrinsic wrist ligaments is complex. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with thin slices is essential for visualization. This article describes the pathological appearance of the extrinsic palmar and dorsal radiocarpal and ulnocarpal ligaments on MRI, correlated with arthroscopy (performed by two skilled hand surgeons), clinical findings, and follow-up. High-resolution MRI, especially using isotropic three-dimensional sequences with orthogonal multiplanar reconstructions on 3T MR systems, allows detailed depiction of many of the extrinsic ligaments affected in carpal injuries. Recognition of ligament abnormalities is improved by intra-articular or intravenous injection of contrast before the examination. Both techniques may help to determine the precise localization, size, and extent of dorsal and palmar radiocarpal and ulnocarpal ligament lesions. Further experience with these techniques is needed to define the place of MRI in the management of traumatic wrist injuries."

Two cases of scaphoid type megalourethra are reported. The first patient, a 5-weeks-old infant diagnosed at birth as having the prune belly syndrome was admitted to the hospital with vomiting and failure to thrive. Intravenous pyelogram revealed marked dilatation of the left ureter and a bladder diverticulum. A penile urethrostomy was performed. The second patient, born to healthy parents after an uneventful pregnancy and delivery, was found to have an enlarged and deformed penis. The baby voided with a poor stream and a concomitant swelling of the penis was noted. Retrograde uretrography showed a sac-like dilatation of the penile urethra. Surgical revision was carried out a 2 stage procedure and was completed (Nesbitt's operation) after 4 months. The patient did well postoperatively and voided with a normal stream without any abnormality of the penile shaft."
CD010023,0,8778828,0,In vivo assessment of trabecular bone structure at the distal radius from high-resolution computed tomography images.,"A dedicated computed tomography system was used to acquire transaxial images of the distal radius to assess trabecular bone structure in vivo. We segmented trabecular bone from the marrow and soft tissue background by postprocessing the image with a region grow and skeletonization step. From the processed image we assessed the integrity of the bone by examining the continuity of its trabecular network and by determining the area of the holes comprising its marrow space. The continuity of the bone imaged was assessed by a proposed connectivity index (CI) and the size of the marrow spaces was assessed by calculating a mean hole area (H(A)) in the bone cross-section. Repeat measurements revealed that the intra-subject variability in CI and H(A) was small (CV < 6%). Both CI and H(A) were sensitive enough to reflect differences in structure at the head of the radius and at several sites along its shaft. We tested the diagnostic value of assessing bone structure at the distal end of the radius by measuring trabecular bone density, CI and H(A) in a mixed group of 26 subjects, nine of whom had suffered a wrist fracture. We found that a trabecular bone density threshold of 116 mg cm-3, corresponding to two standard deviations below the mean density in the 17 non-fractured subjects, separated fractured from non-fractured subjects with a sensitivity of 22% and a specificity of 100%. A CI threshold of -4.7 doubled the sensitivity (44%) and maintained the 100% specificity. An H(A) threshold of 4.5 mm2 achieved a sensitivity of 89% and a specificity of 94%. This increased sensitivity achieved by our indices suggests that an in vivo assessment of trabecular bone structure can contribute significantly to the identification of persons at risk of fracture."

That is why chronic wrist pain syndrome can be somewhat difficult to assess and requires the use of several imaging modalities. Three-compartment arthrography is an invasive but well-known technique that can evaluate interosseous ligaments as well as the triangular fibrocartilage complex; however in recent years MRI has become an important diagnostic tool in imaging wrist injuries, particularly triangular fibrocartilage complex. Its overall accuracy in detecting triangular fibrocartilage complex tears varies from 80 to 95% according to several authors, and even if there is still some controversy about the imaging of the small interosseous ligaments, MRI can also depict some other associated lesions."

Early diagnosis and treatment of such injuries are necessary to prevent progressive carpal instability and traumatic arthritis. Perilunate fracture dislocation is a combination of ligamentous and osseous injuries that involve the 'greater arc' of the perilunate. Despite being severe, these injuries often go unrecognised in the emergency department, leading to delayed diagnosis and treatment. We present a case of greater arc injury of the right wrist with fractures of the lunate and ulnar styloid without perilunate dislocation. This pattern of injury cannot be classified in the available literature on greater arc injury."
CD010023,0,18543166,0,[C-type scaphoid fracture in a elite power lifting].,"Power lifting injuries most often involve shoulder injuries with an injury rate of 0.57 to 0.71/1000 hours of power lifting. Wrist injuries are less common in power lifters with 0.05/1000 hours exposure vs. 0.23/1000 h in elite weight lifting men. Often, two contributing factors causing wrist injuries are encountered: a) loss of balance causing the barbell to drift back behind the head of the power lifter, which hyperextends the wrist and b) the maximal weight. We report on an elite power lifting athlete preparing for the World Masters Bench press championships suffering two months of persisting pain during bench press exercise and rest in the snuff-box area following a loss of balance of the bar-bell during bench press with 280 kg load. Following prolonged presentation 2 months after the initial injury with training in the meantime, CT-scan was performed revealing a C-type scaphoid fracture. Surgery was performed as Herbert screw fixation and bone grafting according to the technique of Matti-Russe, followed by an immobilisation of twelve weeks with a plaster. We recommended ending the athletes' power lifting career, however he further exercised with the plaster with consecutive re-operation 3months later and 2nd Matti-Russe and Herbert screw re-do. One year later he became national champion with 240 kg bench pressing. Given the limited scaphoid blood supply and the high complication rate especially among C-type scaphoid fractures, a surgical procedure with bone grafting, Herbert screw fixation and sufficient plaster immobilisation is advocated in scaphoid fractures in elite athletes."

The use of Gortex liners elsewhere has been reported to have higher patient and physician satisfaction in both use and performance, with no reported detrimental effects on outcome."
CD010023,0,1916662,0,Bone loss after liver transplantation.,"We studied 35 adult patients (mean age = 43 yr) referred for orthotopic liver transplantation. Spinal bone mineral density was measured by quantitative computed tomography scanning before transplantation (n = 35) and at 3 mo (n = 21) and 12 mo (n = 11) after orthotopic liver transplantation. The readings were corrected to age 50 yr, using the regression equations derived from normal control subjects. Quantitative bone histological studies were performed in 17 patients before orthotopic liver transplantation and 3 mo after orthotopic liver transplantation. Before orthotopic liver transplantation, the corrected spinal bone mineral density in men was 108 +/- 20 mg/cm3, less than in male control subjects (129 +/- 22 mg/cm3, p less than 0.005). In women patients the value was 117 +/- 27 mg/cm3, and in female control subjects 126 +/- 19 mg/cm3 (NS). However, women patients with primary biliary cirrhosis had lower spinal bone mineral density (106.5 +/- 14.8) than female control subjects (p less than 0.005). Histologically, the resorbing surface was near the normal mean, whereas the osteoblast surface, tetracycline surface and bone formation rate was lower in men (p less than 0.05) but not women. Spinal bone mineral density decreased by 24% in the first 3 mo after orthotopic liver transplantation with no further decrease at 12 mo. Five patients had vertebral fractures within 6 mo of orthotopic liver transplantation. One patient fractured a wrist and three had osteonecrosis of the hip or knee.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

CD010023,0,18023237,0,[Traumatic pathology of antibrachial interosseous membrane of forearm].,"The antibrachial interosseous membrane (IOM) is taught over an average length of 10.6cm between the diaphyses of the radius and ulna bone. It looks like a stitch with fibers running from the ulna to the radius and from proximal to distal and fibers running from distal to proximal. The central band, which is the middle part of the fibers directed from distal to proximal has mechanical properties similar to those of a ligament and act as a ligamentous structure embedded in the larger membranous complex of the IOM. The interosseous membrane has a double function: it stabilizes transversally the forearm's two bones and stabilizes longitudinally the two bones by transferring loads from the radius to the ulna. Load transmission varies according to the prono-supination position, the varus-valgus constraints on the elbow and the inclination of the wrist, making interpretation of the experimental data difficult. One should consider the forearm as a whole and the interosseous membrane with the two diaphyses should be regarded as a middle radio-ulnar joint, intercalated between the proximal and distal radio-ulnar joint. Those three articulations or links between radius and ulna act synergistically to stabilize and optimize repartition of loads. Functional loss of one of these links, and of course of more than one, will severely modify the forearm function. Essex-Lopresti lesion, which represents the functional loss of all three links, is the most destabilizing forearm lesion. Imaging of the interosseous membrane is difficult. MRI allows for static imaging of the interosseous membrane but there are often artifacts due to previous trauma or surgical procedures. Dynamic sonography helps to visualize all the lesions and will probably be part of the evaluation of every severe forearm injury. Surgical treatment depends on the gravity of the lesions of the different links. Interosseous membrane reconstruction is still the most difficult technique and most of the previously reported ligamentoplasties cannot answer all the biomechanical constraints. We describe a ligamentoplasty based on the biomechanics whose technique has been validated by cadaveric experiments. First surgical cases are promising."

Although the combination of scaphoid fracture and scapholunate ligament rupture in the same injury has been reported and these lesions can no longer be considered mutually exclusive, little information is available on management methods and the long-term results of such seemingly paradoxical complex injuries. This study reviews 11 previously described cases and reports an additional two cases of concurrent scaphoid fracture with scapholunate ligament rupture. This concurrent injury has two presentations; namely perilunate fracture-dislocation, which is the most common presentation, and complex scaphoid fracture. No single mechanism of injury exists that accounts for these complex injuries. High-energy trauma was the only characteristic common to all these cases. Most cases had unsatisfactory radiographic results including scaphoid nonunion, avascular necrosis of the lunate or the proximal pole of the scaphoid and arthrotic wrist changes at an average follow-up of 11 months. Managing these difficult problems needs critical recognition and repair of both bony and ligamentous damage. Early proximal row carpectomy or four-corner midcarpal fusion is another option when these injuries preclude stable reduction and fixation."

CD010023,0,21705566,0,Percutaneous screw fixation without bone grafting for established scaphoid nonunion with substantial bone loss.,"Ununited fractures of the scaphoid with extensive bone resorption are usually treated by bone grafting and internal fixation, using either an open or a minimally invasive technique. We studied the feasibility of percutaneous fixation without bone grafting in a consecutive series of 27 patients with established nonunion of an undisplaced fracture of the scaphoid and extensive local resorption of bone. They were treated by a single surgeon with rigid fixation alone, using a headless cannulated screw inserted through a volar percutaneous technique. Clinical examination, standard radiographs and CT confirmed that the fracture had united in all patients at a mean of 11.6 weeks (8 to 16), and that their functional scores had improved. We concluded that extensive resorption at the fracture site is not an absolute indication for bone grafting, and that percutaneous fixation alone will eventually produce healing of ununited undisplaced fractures of the scaphoid regardless of the size of the gap."
CD010023,0,8300730,0,Treatment of complex fractures of the distal radius. Combined use of internal and external fixation and arthroscopic reduction.,"A group of fractures of the distal radius are inherently unstable and cannot be treated by closed reduction and cast or external fixation. These fractures are high-energy motor vehicle accidents often seen in young adults but possible in nearly every age group. They are not typical Colles's fractures because they are intra-articular with displacement of the joint articular surfaces. The goals of treatment are to obtain an anatomic reduction and then to proceed with treatment techniques to maintain the reduction by whatever methods are available or necessary within the experience of the treating surgeon. Previous admonitions that Colles's fractures should not be treated by open reduction are incorrect. Like other intra-articular fractures, the goal is anatomic alignment. Limited open reduction or newer arthroscopic techniques may be sufficient. A more aggressive approach of open reduction, internal and external fixation, and autogenous bone grafting is now indicated in most high-energy distal radius fractures to achieve the treatment goals defined earlier: anatomic joint surface reduction, restoration of radial length, and correction of dorsal malangulation."

Bone mineral and strength related parameters at two different sites at the distal radius were explored in a subset of the multicenter core study. One hundred and three patients were entered into the substudy and given either a daily dose of 10 mg of alendronate or placebo for 1 year. Measurements were done at months 0, 3, 6, and 12. Inclusion criteria were bone mineral density (BMD) measurements at the lumbar spine of -2 SD. The response to therapy was assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry in the lumbar spine and the hip, and by pQCT in the ultradistal and the shaft sites of the radius. In line with the FOSIT core study, alendronate increased BMD at the lumbar spine and the hip, and it decreased the serum biochemical markers of bone turnover. The substudy showed differences between the therapy and placebo group in trabecular bone density (8.4%, p = 0.095), in total density (6.8%, p = 0.009), and in the bone strength index (BSI) (15. 6 mm3, p = 0.037) at the ultradistal site due to treatment and no changes at the radius shaft. A significant correlation was observed between percentage changes from baseline in BMD of the lumbar spine, and in total density and bone strength at the ultradistal radius site in the treatment group, but not in the placebo group. Thus, the ultradistal radius site did respond to alendronate therapy. The increased bone density accompanied a significant gain in the BSI at the ultradistal site, a finding that might help explain the reduced wrist fractures in the alendronate Fracture Intervention Trial."

CD010023,0,9889659,1,[MRI scanning in suspected fractures of the scaphoid bone].,"MR examination was performed in 20 patients clinically suspected of having a fracture of the scaphoid bone. The patients also followed the normal routine with conventional radiographs in the acute fase and after 10-12 days. The MR was in most cases performed within a day after the trauma. All fractures seen on conventional radiographs were depicted on MR. MR further showed four fractures, five bone contusions (bone bruise) and lesions of the soft tissues in 75% of the patients. In patients with suspected fracture of the scaphoid, MR seems to be the best primary imaging method and displays a wide range of lesions."

CD010023,0,15060773,0,[Incorrect classification of extra-articular distal radius fractures by conventional X-rays. Comparison between biplanar radiologic diagnostics and CT assessment of fracture morphology].,"Thirty-five displaced fractures of the distal radius, classified by standard radiographs as extra-articular type A2 and A3 fractures according to the AO classification, were investigated before operative treatment by computed tomography. The comparative analysis surprisingly revealed an involvement of the articular surface of the distal radius in 57%. The intra-articular fractures were classified after CT as C1 in 15%, C2 in 65%, and C3 in 20%. The distal radioulnar joint was involved in 80% of the type C injuries and showed a dorsal subluxation in 17% of all cases. Similar to the results of type A2 and A3 fractures, type B and C fractures of the distal radius also may be underestimated in standard radiographs. This concerns important components such as the involvement of the radiocarpal joint surface and concomitant injuries of the distal radioulnar joint. Since joint congruency is an important predictor of outcome, CT scanning should be used more generously for planning and controlling surgical therapy."
CD010023,0,16075778,0,The management of scaphoid fractures.,"Appropriate management of scaphoid fractures is important because of the risk of long-term complications such as delayed or non-union, pain and disability. Up to 25% of scaphoid fractures are not visible on the initial radiographs. Consequently, all clinically suspected scaphoid fractures are treated as fractures with cast immobilisation until cause of the symptoms is clarified. The diagnosis often utilises a number of second line investigations that are generally performed 10-14 days after the injury. Bone scintigraphy is currently the most commonly used of these as it rarely misses a fracture. However, it does not visualise anatomical structure and therefore alternative diagnoses are difficult. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is at least as sensitive and more specific than bone scanning and has the advantages of being able to identify other lesions and not expose the patient to any radiation. Furthermore, the scan may be performed as early as 2.8 days following an injury rather than 10 days later in the case of a bone scan. Although the cost of MRI is higher than other imaging modalities, it may be cost-effective in the overall management of patients with occult scaphoid fractures since it may prevent unnecessary cast immobilisation in active people. The most appropriate method of cast immobilisation is presently unclear but evidence exists for improved clinical outcomes in those that have both the thumb and elbow immobilised for the first six weeks."

CD010023,0,8422558,0,Quantitative bone scintigraphy in reflex sympathetic dystrophy.,"We have investigated the appearances of the technetium-99m labelled methylene diphosphonate bone scan in 29 scans performed in 16 patients with post-fracture reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD) of the hand. There was a close correlation between increased uptake in the metacarpophalangeal joints and the metacarpal bones, suggesting that the increased uptake in RSD is not confined to the periarticular areas as has been previously reported but occurs throughout the affected region. In seven cases examined 3 months after fracture, RSD was associated with a significant increase in uptake at all sites in the hand on the delayed scan which was not seen in matched post-fracture controls, confirming that increased uptake on delayed bone scintography is a sensitive test for the presence of RSD even in the presence of a fracture of the wrist. The early increased uptake gradually returned to normal. Local tenderness assessed by dolorimetry was correlated with increased uptake, suggesting that the bone scan is not only useful as a diagnostic tool but also provides a quantitative indication of the severity of the condition which may be useful in planning and assessing treatments."

The diagnosis is frequently missed at initial presentation to a physician. Usually, a CT scan is required to reveal the extent of the lesion. Operative treatment consists of open reduction and internal fixation with screws (e.g. headless compression screw) or Kirschner wires. We report on a case of a 19-year-old man who presented to our hospital 2 months after he fell on his left wrist. He complained about persistent pain and a decreased range of motion after conservative treatment in a short arm cast. The diagnosis was finally made by a CT scan and the patient was treated operatively using headless compression screws in both the capitate and the scaphoid. After 12 weeks, fractures were completely healed radiographically and the patient returned to work. At follow-up 16 months after trauma, the patient had no further complaints. Range of motion increased and no avascular necrosis could be observed."

The reference standard for a true radiologically-occult scaphoid fracture was either a diagnosis of fracture on both MRI and bone scintigraphy, or, in the case of discrepancy, clinical and/or radiological evidence of a fracture. MRI revealed 16 scaphoid and 24 other fractures. Bone scintigraphy showed 28 scaphoid and 40 other fractures. According to the reference standard there were 20 scaphoid fractures. MRI was falsely negative for scaphoid fracture in four patients and bone scintigraphy falsely positive in eight. MRI had a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 100%. Bone scintigraphy had a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 90%. This study did not confirm that early, short-sequence MRI was superior to bone scintigraphy for the diagnosis of a suspected scaphoid fracture. Bone scintigraphy remains a highly sensitive and reasonably specific investigation for the diagnosis of an occult scaphoid fracture."

Five healthy volunteers and 28 patients with scaphoid fractures underwent M.R.I., which made possible a definitive diagnosis of scaphoid fractures at an early stage. A fresh fracture was identified by decreased or iso signal intensity on the T1-weighted image and increased signal intensity on the T2-weighted image. This increase continued until bony union was apparent on radiographs. On the T2-weighted image, high signal intensity was characteristic of fresh fractures and suggested that bony union was possible. When bony union was complete, the intensity of the signal for the scaphoid on both T1- and T2-weighted images returned to normal. M.R.I. should thus prove useful in the diagnosis of scaphoid fractures."

Thirty-one patients with unilateral displaced scaphoid waist fractures and adequate follow-up were included. CT scans in the longitudinal axis of the scaphoid with sagittal and coronal slices were done 4 weeks after the index injury. The effects of fracture gap, sclerosis and bone resorption on union were assessed. Fracture union was observed in all 13 displaced fractures with a < 2 mm gap, four of the seven with a gap of 2-3 mm and only four of the 11 with a gap > 3 mm (p = 0.01). Bone resorption involving more than 50% of the fracture cross-section was also associated with nonunion, but sclerosis was not."
CD010023,0,3169970,0,99Tcm-MDP bone scanning of injuries of the carpal scaphoid.,"Clinical injuries of the carpal scaphoid are frequently seen at accident and emergency departments. Some exhibit delayed radiographic visualization of a fracture. The radioisotope bone scan is a sensitive test and increased uptake is observed in healing fractures. Twenty-three patients with an initial diagnosis of clinical fractures of the scaphoid were studied clinically, radiologically and independently by 99Tcm-MDP isotope scans. Three-quarters of the patients required only 1 month's management. Their corresponding bone scans were normal or not suggestive of a fracture. The remaining 25 per cent, who clinically required a more prolonged treatment (greater than or equal to 5 weeks' immobilization), were noted independently to have positive scans whether a fracture was observed or not. It is concluded that there is a stronger correlation between clinical examination and a bone scan than with a standard radiographic examination. It is proposed that patients still tender at 3 weeks should have a carpal isotope bone scan to identify if there is an important wrist injury and appropriate treatment commenced."
CD010023,0,20879420,0,Calibration and use of intraoperative cone-beam computed tomography: an in-vitro study for wrist fracture.,"The standard workflow in many image-guided procedures, preoperative imaging followed by intraoperative registration, can be a challenging process and is not readily adaptable to certain anatomical regions such as the wrist. In this study we present an alternative, consisting of a preoperative registration calibration and intraoperative navigation using 3D cone-beam CT. A custom calibration tool was developed to preoperatively register an optical tracking system to the imaging space of a digital angiographic C-arm. This preoperative registration was then applied to perform direct navigation using intraoperatively acquired images for the purposes of an in-vitro wrist fixation procedure. A validation study was performed to assess the stability of the registration and found that the mean registration error was approximately 0.3 mm. When compared to two conventional techniques, our navigated wrist repair achieved equal or better screw placement, with fewer drilling attempts and no additional radiation exposure to the patient. These studies suggest that preoperative registration coupled with direct navigation using procedure-specific graphical rendering, is potentially a highly accurate and effective means of performing image-guided interventions."
CD010023,0,19226035,0,Evaluating bone union of distal radius fractures by measuring impedance values.,"The measurement of impedance is a noninvasive and simple quantitative technique for evaluation of fracture healing. Fractures of the distal radius are the most common long bone fractures, accounting for approximately 20% to 25% of all acute fractures. External fixators have been applied clinically to treat unstable distal radius fractures. The evaluation of radiological findings and clinical signs are current standard methods and are effective in assessing fracture union of the distal radius, but these methods are dependent on subjective elements. For the objective methods, previous studies have shown that measurement of bone mineral density, ultrasound, quantitative computed tomography, and acoustic emission are useful in evaluating bone union. However, due to the complexity and high radiation dose associated with these methods, are seldom used clinically. This study was undertaken to examine the correlation between bone union and impedance at the site of digital radius fractures treated with an external fixator, using an alternating current electrical stimulator and a digital oscilloscope."

Bone age radiographs of 85 children (36 boys, 49 girls) 6 to 14 years of age were used to establish the normal ranges. Repeated-measures analysis of variance revealed significant age and gender differences. Therefore, linear regression was used to determine normal SLD ranges separately for girls and boys based on chronologic age and bone age. SLD normal ranges were similar for chronologic age and bone age. Interobserver and intraobserver agreement was excellent. There was no significant age by gender interaction found, indicating that although boys had significantly longer distances than girls, both showed a similar rate of decreasing SLD distance with age. These results provide age-and gender-based normal ranges of SLD in young children. These results may be useful in assessing traumatic soft tissue injuries about the pediatric wrist. Of note, only three girls and two boys (all 12 years or older) met the adult criterion of normal SLD of < or = 2 mm."
CD010023,0,19662447,0,Multiple occult wrist bone injuries and joint effusions: prevalence and distribution on MRI.,"This study aims (1) to assess the prevalence and distribution of multiple occult injuries of the carpal bones and the distal forearm in patients with wrist pain and negative radiographs following trauma and (2) to evaluate the distribution and significance of joint effusions in the wrists with multiple osseous injuries. One hundred and thirty-one subjects, 74 men and 57 women, were consecutively examined in two institutions. All were acute trauma patients with negative X-rays whose clinical examination suggested possible fracture at the wrist or the distal forearm. Magnetic resonance (MR) wrist imaging was performed with and without fat saturation sequences. The MR images were analysed for detection of occult trabecular contusions and cortical discontinuity in the carpus, the distal forearm and the metacarpal bases. The prevalence and distribution of the injuries were assessed along with the distribution of joint effusions. Eight patients were excluded due to inadequate image quality. Two patients had bilateral injury. A total of 125 wrists were analysed. Seventy-eight (62.4%) wrists had occult bone injuries. Among these 78, 53 (68%) wrists had more than one injured bone. Twenty-five wrists (32%) had one injured bone. The highest number of injured bones per wrist was six. Injuries with a visible fracture line were seen in 29 (37.1%) wrists on MRI. The distal radius was the most frequent location for occult fracture line (11 cases). The injuries without a fracture line (contusion) were present in 49 (63%) wrists; they were detected more frequently in the scaphoid (35 cases). The lunate (29 cases) and the triquetrum (26 cases) were almost equally affected. The bone that was less frequently injured was the pisiform (four cases). Joint effusions were present in all 53 wrists with multiple bone lesions but more often situated in the ulnocarpal space [27 (50.3%) wrists]. There was no correlation between effusions in multiple locations (grades III and IV) and multiple bone injuries. This study revealed the presence of multifocal trabecular contusions without correlation with increased joint effusions in patients with negative radiographs and persistent pain. The clinical significance of these findings deserves further investigation."

A correct diagnosis of scaphoid fractures is essential for the prevention of avascular necrosis of the proximal fragment and of pseudo-arthrosis. Thirty-three patients with a clinically suspected scaphoid fracture and a normal radiograph were examined. These patients had supplementary 99mTc-MDP scintigraphy. Eight of the 33 patients had normal scans, 12 patients had a scaphoid fracture and 17 had other fractures.

CD010023,0,22386473,0,Demographic and medical parameters in the development of complex regional pain syndrome type 1 (CRPS1): prospective study on 596 patients with a fracture.,"Limited data are available on the incidence of complex regional pain syndrome type 1 (CRPS1) and on demographic and medical risk factors for the development of CRPS1. The objective of this study was to investigate the incidence of CRPS1 in patients with a fracture using 3 sets of diagnostic criteria and to evaluate the association between demographic/medical factors and the development of CRPS1 diagnosed with the Harden and Bruehl criteria. A prospective multicenter cohort study of 596 patients (ages 18 years and older) with a single fracture of the wrist, scaphoid, ankle, or metatarsal V, recruited patients from the emergency rooms of 3 Dutch hospitals. Of the 596 participants, 42 (7.0%) were diagnosed with CRPS1 according to the Harden and Bruehl criteria, 289 (48.5%) according to the International Association for the Study of Pain criteria, and 127 (21.3%) according to the criteria of Veldman. An analysis of the medical and demographic differences revealed that patients in whom CRPS1 later developed more often had intra-articular fractures, fracture dislocations, rheumatoid arthritis, or musculoskeletal comorbidities. An ankle fracture, dislocation, and an intra-articular fracture contributed significantly to the prediction of the development of CRPS1. No CRPS1 patients were symptom free at 12 months (T3). At baseline, patients with CRPS1 had significantly more pain than patients without CRPS1 (P<.001). The incidence of the diagnosis of CRPS1 after a single fracture depends to a large extent on the diagnostic criteria used. After a fracture, 7% of the patients developed CRPS1 and none of the patients were free of symptoms at 1-year follow-up."

Long-standing scaphoid nonunion or scapholunate ligament insufficiency may lead to a carpal collapse and subsequent arthrosis. Controversy exists regarding the appropriate salvage procedure for patients with scapholunate advanced collapse (SLAC)- or scaphoid nonunion advanced collapse (SNAC)-wrist in stage II. Proximal row carpectomy (PRC) and midcarpal arthrodesis (MCA) are two commonly used options.

CD010023,0,11903171,0,Magnetic resonance imaging of the wrist ligaments.,"The advent of small arthroscopes has enabled the hand surgeon to visualize the ligaments of the wrist directly with resultant increased accuracy in diagnosing and treating pathology. Orthopaedists are now demanding a preoperative assessment and this, in turn, has necessitated that radiologists have a comprehensive understanding of wrist anatomy. High resolution MR imaging can identify the wrist ligaments reliably and provide information concerning their integrity. Interpretation is not straightforward; there is considerable anatomic variation, and there are perforations, defects and degenerative tears that can be troublesome in diagnosing injury. However, with experience and attention to anatomic detail, the radiologist can provide useful information regarding structural abnormalities. When injured, the ligaments of the wrist behave as other joint ligaments do. Findings following injury include discontinuity of normal striated bands, incomplete disruption, irregularities and alteration in normal signal. Fluid pooling around a ligament and concomitant bone injury are other clues to injury. The identification of such structural abnormalities may help to explain altered biomechanics and improve the management of patients following wrist injury."
CD010023,0,12665700,0,In vivo measurement of apparent trabecular bone structure of the radius in women with low bone density discriminates patients with recent wrist fracture from those without fracture.,"The purpose of this cross-sectional case-control study was to determine whether indices of bone structure at the 4% site of the radius discriminate women who have sustained a recent low-energy fracture of the contralateral distal radius (n = 21) from women with similar bone density and no history of fracture (n = 21). Images of the distal forearm were acquired using peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) and were analyzed using in-house-developed software to determine indices of trabecular bone structure (average hole size [H(A)], maximum hole size, and connectivity index). The same images were analyzed using commercial software to determine bone density, mass, geometry, and torsional strength. The fracture group had significantly larger H(A) (p = 0.03). No other bone variable differed between groups. Individual H(A) values were compared to the mean value for young adult women (n = 42). The odds ratio (95% confidence interval) associated with an H(A) >2 SDs above the young adult mean was 5.4 (1.2-24.3). Thus, estimation of in vivo trabecular bone porosity by measuring the average diameter of the pQCT-imaged marrow spaces in the ultradistal radius identifies individuals with low bone mass most at risk for osteoporotic fracture."

CD010023,0,18586545,0,[Scaphoid malunion].,"Scaphoid fracture and healing are often difficult to diagnose. The scaphoid bone may heal in an abnormal position and this malunion is usually in flexion and shortening. Fractures of the mid or distal part of the bone are mainly concerned. This malunion may be the cause of an alteration of the carpal mechanics and finally of osteoarthritis revealed by pain and decrease of motion and strength. The intrascaphoid angle of Amadio helps to calculate the magnitude of the deformity and to plan the correction. This malunion has to be corrected only if symptomatic. Two other types of malunions exist: healing with a rotation of the distal fragment, and healing with irregular contours which may also lead to arthritis. Correction of the malunion will be performed after having assessed precisely measurements of the deformity using comparative X-rays, special views, carpal indices and eventually a dedicated specific software. In the literature may be found a certain number of papers where scaphoid osteotomy combined with a trapezoidal bone graft and a bone fixation using a screw have been performed with success and healing for all cases. This procedure may be performed without hesitation for a symptomatic healed scaphoid, even if it has been operated before for nonunion."

CD010023,0,9026486,0,[Ulnodorsal impingement syndrome: meniscus lesions of the wrist].,"In a consecutive series of 166 wrist arthroscopies, a lesion of the meniscus was found in 16 patients. All of them complained of ulnar wrist pain evoked by axial load in extension. 14 patients had previous wrist trauma. The preoperative physical examination showed marked ulnodorsal tenderness on palpation and the examiner could feel crepitation by passive motion in the radial-ulnar direction. The meniscus represents a part of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC). At this time it is not possible by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to differentiate between articular disc and meniscus lesion. In contrast the two structures are clearly identifiable by arthroscopy especially if there is a radial tear through the meniscus or even a complete avulsion from its insertion on the palmar aspect of the triquetrum. The avulsed part of the meniscus can prolapse into the ulnocarpal joint, causing an impingement phenomenon."
CD010023,0,8230827,0,[The utility of three-phase bone scintigraphy in the assessment of fractured carpal scaphoid].,"Thirty-seven joints in 36 patients with a fractured carpal scaphoid were evaluated by three-phase bone scintigraphy. They were classified into two groups according to their progress. Some were in good clinical condition and some in a non-union condition. Increased blood flow in the radial arteries and ample perfusion on and around the scaphoid bones on blood flow images suggested a good clinical course. The activity and the effectiveness of remodeling correlated well with the degree of scaphoid uptake on blood pool images taken more than seven days after the injury. Scaphoid uptake was more localized or there was almost none on blood pool images in cases with nearly complete recovery while it was amply visualized on static images. Blood pool images were indispensable for analyzing lesions and evaluating the clinical course. Two typical findings of scaphoid fractures were found on both blood pool and static images. One was diffusely increased scaphoid uptake seen in cases with a good clinical course, and the other was decreased uptake at proximal fragments seen in cases with non-union. It is concluded that three-phase bone scintigraphy provides useful information for evaluating the process of scaphoid fractures which cannot be obtained by means of conventional bone scintigraphy."
CD010023,0,10951111,0,Acute fractures of the scaphoid.,"Nondisplaced fractures of the scaphoid heal with cast immobilization in most cases, but operative treatment is being offered with greater frequency to active patients as an approach to reduce the period of cast immobilization. Computed tomography is more useful for evaluating displacement than standard radiography. Displaced fractures are at greater risk for nonunion and malunion-both of which have been associated with the development of radiocarpal arthritis in long-term studies--and should therefore be treated operatively. Surgical treatment is also recommended for complex fractures (open fractures, perilunate fracture-dislocations, and scaphoid fractures associated with fracture of the distal radius), very proximal fractures, and fractures for which the diagnosis and treatment have been delayed.

CD010023,0,15751361,0,Your diagnosis? Scaphoid fracture.,"Fractures of the scaphoid are the most common carpal bone fracture. With careful management, prognosis is excellent. Imaging is critical, not only for early diagnosis, but also for monitoring patients after initial treatment to detect unstable fractures, the common complications of nonunion and avascular necrosis, and the need for surgical treatment."
CD010023,0,3260727,0,Spontaneous osteonecrosis of the tarsal navicular in adults: imaging findings.,"We encountered five otherwise healthy adults with alterations of the tarsal navicular bone compatible with spontaneous osteonecrosis. Four women had bilateral involvement and one man had unilateral involvement. The patients were 23-71 years old. The disorder was initially described by Mueller and Weiss and should not be confused with Koehler disease (osteochondrosis of the tarsal navicular in children). This group of patients was compared with five other patients (29-74 years old) with similar radiographic and clinical changes in whom an underlying disease (rheumatoid arthritis, renal failure, trauma, and lupus erythematosus) associated with osteonecrosis was known. Routine radiography in both groups defined characteristic abnormalities of the navicular bone (decreased size, a comma-shaped configuration, increased radiodensity, fragmentation, and medial or medial and dorsal osseous protrusion). MR in three patients confirmed alterations consistent with osteonecrosis. Three of the patients without underlying disease had bilateral involvement on plain films, with flat feet and hindfoot valgus deformity, leading to local pain and deformity. In a fourth patient, bilateral distribution was documented by MR as marrow alterations. Although no certain pathogenic explanation for spontaneous osteonecrosis of the tarsal navicular is known, trauma and chronic stress changes caused by physiologic pressure on the medial longitudinal arch in hindfoot valgus and increased tension forces of the plantar aponeurosis during weight-bearing (in pes planus) may be important. Discrimination of primary from secondary osteonecrosis of the tarsal navicular bone is not possible by radiologic means alone, although bilateral distribution, particularly in women, favors the diagnosis of spontaneous disease."

A new cine-MR arthrography technique, with image acquisition at every 5 s during intra-articular injection, was performed in 17 subjects. The purpose of this study was to determine the diagnostic value of MR arthrography in ligamentous lesions of the wrist and to assess the value of cine-MR arthrography in comparison with arthroscopy and/or surgery. Magnetic resonance arthrography, a semi-invasive technique, increased the diagnostic accuracy of intrinsic carpal ligament injuries.

Thirteen of the patients experienced complete pain relief. One patient required additional surgery and elected wrist arthrodesis. Resection of the distal fragment is not recommended for patients with capitolunate arthritis. Two of the 4 patients with capitolunate arthritis had persistent symptoms; 3 had progressive degenerative changes."

CD010023,0,20824422,0,[Treatment of carpal fractures. Recommendations of the Hand Surgery Group of the German Trauma Society].,"The primary goal in the treatment of carpal fractures is the preservation of a painless wrist function. Scaphoid fractures are the most common carpal fractures and when such a fracture is clinically suspected CT or MRI scans are usually advisable. Only stable and non-displaced scaphoid fractures can be treated conservatively, all other fractures require internal fixation with restoration of normal anatomy. Second most common are fractures of the triquetrum which can occur as chip avulsions of the dorsal rim and are usually treated symptomatically. Fractures of the body of the triquetrum should be treated according to the degree of instability and displacement. This is virtually true for all carpal bones. Perilunate fracture dislocations of the carpus deserve special attention. In these severe injuries a fracture line can run through all carpal bones but the scaphoid is mostly affected. Accurate reduction and internal fixation by screws and K-wires are indicated not only in these cases, but also in carpometacarpal fracture dislocations."

CD010023,0,10789100,0,Results of treatment of 22 navicular stress fractures and a new proposed radiographic classification system.,"Twenty-two navicular stress fractures sustained during athletic activity were retrospectively reviewed for return to activity time and the appearance of fracture pattern on computerized tomography. There were 10 females and nine males, with the average patient age being 27.2 years. Three patients sustained bilateral injuries at separate times. Average follow-up was 36.5 months. Nine patients underwent open reduction, internal fixation (some with bone grafting); this group's average return to activity (RTA) was 3.1 +/- 1.2 months (range, 1.5-5 months). Thirteen patients treated conservatively had an average return to activity of 4.3 +/- 2.8 months (range, 2-13 months). The difference between the two groups' RTA was significant (p = .02). Eleven patients utilized pulsed electromagnetic fields (PEMF) and had an average RTA of 4.2 +/- 3.4 months, 27.3% of those patients with PEMF also had surgery. Two conservatively treated fractures that took 5 and 8 months to RTA, respectively, re-fractured during the treatment process. Retrospective review showed CT fracture patterns in the frontal plane that were classified as: dorsal cortical break (type I), fracture propagation into the navicular body (type II), and fracture propagation into another cortex (type III). This is a proposed classification system. It includes modifiers ""A"" (avascular necrosis of a portion of the navicular); ""C"" (cystic changes of the fracture), and ""S"" (sclerosis of the margins of the fracture), the latter of which was most common in our series, particularly in continually symptomatic patients. Type I fractures were more likely to receive conservative treatment (p = .02) and type III fractures took significantly longer to heal than types I and II (p values .001 and .01, respectively). Type I and II injuries had an average RTA of 3.0 and 3.6 months, respectively. Type III injuries had an average RTA of 6.8 months. Based on our findings, we recommend surgery for patients with these modifiers, particularly with type II and III injuries. Conservative treatment may be prolonged, and requires at least 6 weeks of nonweightbearing in a below-knee cast/boot to be successful."

The subject groups analyzed consisted of 40 asymptomatic volunteers and 30 patients with various wrist disorders (fractures, instabilities). In 11 anatomic specimens, this kinematic analysis was completed by a radiographic morphologic study and an investigation of capsular ligament anatomy. Clinical applications showed that carpal bone motion in the injured wrist was not significantly different from contralateral, asymptomatic wrist motion. In both wrists of patients with unilateral pathology, however, significant differences were observed as compared with asymptomatic volunteers. Scaphoid motion was bilaterally altered, suggesting the existence of anatomic or kinematic factors predisposing to certain carpal pathologies."

Feasibility of transfixion wire placement.,"The advantages of Ilizarov external fixation, allowing early motion of adjacent joints during fixation of periarticular fractures, have not yet been applied to distal radius fractures. A magnetic resonance imaging study of 10 normal volunteers evaluated the safety of passing percutaneous transfixion pins across the distal radius in 3 forearm positions. Even in the optimal forearm position, the safe zones between the transfixion pin, vessel, nerve, or tendon was small, suggesting that open placement would be required. A cadaver study in 8 specimens demonstrated that the pins could be placed with an open technique using an aiming device and that the pins could be placed without limiting forearm rotation. The proximity of vital structures to transfixion pins dictates open placement to safely apply Ilizarov fixation to distal radius fractures."

Two radiologists independently examined the radiographs without knowledge of the specific group to which the patient belonged. The results of this study clearly establish that structural joint diseases in the two disorders are not identical. Characteristic findings allow the radiologist to favor one diagnosis over the other. These radiographic differences indicate that the arthropathy of hemochromatosis is related to factors additional to the presence of CPPD crystals, specifically, the more prevalent narrowing of the metacarpophalangeal joint spaces, including those in the fourth and fifth digits, peculiar hook-like osteophytes on the radial aspect of the metacarpal heads, and less prevalent separation of the scaphoid and the lunate."

The process does not require special computer knowledge and can be performed with a unmodified CT scanner. 3-D images are especially valuable for conveying information to nonradiologist physicians, who are unfamiliar with the numerous slice-format images produced in a standard CT examination. The utility of these methods for clarification of areas of complex skeletal anatomy has been previously demonstrated in the literature. We performed 3-D imaging on a normal isolated cadaver hand and on a patient with scaphoid fracture. In both cases the 3-D images obtained had excellent osseous anatomical detail. A method of acquisition of high quality wrist CT scans, suitable for 3-D processing, is suggested."

Radiographs showed a fracture of the distal radius and a wrist joint effusion. Preoperative CT examination exhibited two distinct layers resulting in a fat-fluid level pathognomonic of lipohemarthrosis in the radiocarpal joint. In addition, a fat-density effusion was noted in the sheaths of the second and third compartment extensor tendons. The lipohemarthrosis depicted on imaging classically results from the extrusion of fat from bone marrow into the joint space after an intraarticular fracture. Similarly, a traumatic fat effusion in a tendon sheath presents characteristic imaging features that may help to diagnose a potentially overlooked fracture."
CD010023,0,15232430,0,Assessment of articular displacement of distal radius fractures.,"Intraarticular step and gap displacements represent the most common indication for surgical treatment of distal radius fractures. Most often, treatment decision making relies only on good-quality plain radiographs taken before and after reduction with measurement accuracy maximized by using the longitudinal axis method. When plain radiographs alone prove insufficient, CT scans or tomograms will significantly improve interobserver and intraobserver reliability of measurements, especially when evaluated using the arc method. Tomography is an effective method for postoperative evaluation of fractures immobilized in splints or casts. The role of MRI in assessing intraarticular distal radius fractures is limited to confirming injuries to carpal ligaments or the triangular fibrocartilage complex. Intraoperatively, we use fluoroscopy to obtain 30 degrees cephalad posteroanterior views and as 22 degrees lateral views to best observe articular surface reduction. Our current operative indications include fractures with radiocarpal or distal radioulnar joint step or gap deformities greater than 1-2 mm, gross distal radioulnar joint instability, or those with extensive metaphyseal comminution rendering them particularly unstable after closed reduction. In general, we tend to lean toward operative fixation in younger, more active patients."

CD010023,0,8771471,0,Clinical assessment of scaphoid injuries and the detection of fractures.,"Difficulty in interpreting X-rays following carpal injury emphasizes the importance of clinical assessment in diagnosing scaphoid fractures. The classical sign of tenderness in the anatomical snuffbox is not specific and leads to many unnecessary out-patient reviews. A prospective comparison was made between anatomical snuffbox, scaphoid tubercle and scaphoid compression tenderness as indicators of scaphoid fracture in 221 patients with suspected scaphoid injury. Swelling was determined by measuring the difference in circumference at the wrist joint to compare between fracture and soft tissue injury. Scaphoid compression tenderness was found to be the most accurate test with a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 80%. Swelling of the wrist joint was significantly greater when there was a fracture, compared to soft tissue injury alone, even when the initial X-ray was normal. This was independent of any physiological variation in circumference between dominant and non-dominant sides. Scaphoid compression tenderness is therefore suggested as the most accurate indicator of scaphoid fracture and marked swelling should raise suspicion even if the X-ray is normal."

Fifty-one patients with suspected radiographically occult scaphoid fractures at 10-14 days after trauma were investigated prospectively with skeletal scintigraphy and CT on the same day. Planar images of the wrist were taken 3 hr after IV injection of 400 MBq of (99m)Tc-methylene diphosphonate using a single-head gamma camera. CT was performed on a 16-MDCT machine using 0.75-mm detectors and reconstruction in 0.5-mm slices. Multiplanar reformatted images were then viewed in interactive cine mode. The examinations were reported independently, and discordant results were compared at follow-up. CT was positive for wrist fracture in 14 (27.4%) of 51 patients and skeletal scintigraphy in 23 (45.1%) of 51 patients. Even after retrospective review, there were seven discrepant cases (13.7%), all of which were positive for wrist fracture on scintigraphy but negative on CT. Four of these seven patients with discordant findings underwent further radiography at 6 weeks, which did not show fracture."
CD010023,0,21888527,0,"Forearm muscle size, strength, force, and power in relation to pQCT-derived bone strength at the radius in adults.","We aimed to examine the relationship between forearm muscle cross-sectional area (MCSA), muscle force, or rate of torque development (RTD) and 2 estimated radius bone strength indices - compressive bone strength index (BSI) at the wrist and strength strain index in torsion (SSI(p)) at the shaft - in healthy middle-aged males and females. Distal (4%) and shaft (65%) sites of nondominant forearms were scanned using peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) in a sample of 48 adults (mean age ± SD, 49.4 ± 2.4 y) to obtain estimated bone strength indices and MCSA. Muscle force, measured by grip dynamometry and wrist flexion RTD, was obtained using an isokinetic dynamometer. Hierarchical linear regressions, adjusted for weight, explained 27% and 36% of the BSI variance at the 4% site in males and premenopausal females, respectively (p < 0.05). At the radius shaft, weight explained 26% (p < 0.05) and 83% (p < 0.01) of SSI(p) variance. The unique variance of BSI explained by MCSA was 16% in males (p < 0.05) and 31% in females (p < 0.01). Grip force predicted variance in SSI(p) in males (p < 0.01) and BSI in females (p < 0.05). RTD did not explain any variance in BSI or SSI(p). Body weight was the only significant predictor (p < 0.05) of SSI(p) in females. Although forearm muscle size and grip strength are associated with estimates of radius bone strength at midlife, this relationship appears to be sex dependent. The differences observed between muscle size and strength properties and bone strength at distal and shaft sites of the radius suggest a property-, sex-, and site-specific relationship between muscle and bone in the forearm."
CD010023,0,2380517,0,Avascular necrosis after scaphoid fracture: a correlation of magnetic resonance imaging and histology.,"In this study 12 male patients with fractures of the middle third of the scaphoid had an magnetic resonance imaging study before open reduction and internal fixation in conjunction with bone grafting of the scaphoid. The patients' average age was 27 years (range, 17 to 37 years). At the time of surgery biopsy specimens were obtained from both the proximal and distal poles of the scaphoid. The length of time before surgery ranged from a minimum of 1 1/2 months in recently displaced fractures to a maximum of 10 years in established nonunions. Results of the biopsy showed that six patients had avascular necrosis noted in the proximal pole fragment. In three of these six patients avascular necrosis was confirmed by the absence of tetracycline labeling despite positive uptake noted in biopsy specimens from the bone graft site; the other three patients did not receive tetracycline labeling. Magnetic resonance imaging showed that all six of the patients with biopsy specimens of the proximal poles showing avascular necrosis demonstrated decreased signal intensity in the proximal pole fragment, whereas the plain radiographs demonstrated changes in the proximal pole in only three of the six patients. A decreased signal intensity from the proximal pole of the scaphoid may indicate a poor prognosis inasmuch as only three of the six patients had healing of the fracture even with bone grafting and internal fixation."

Early recognition of the injury by careful clinical and radiographic examination results in the most favorable prognosis. Standard posteroanterior and lateral radiographs of the wrist may be inadequate. Instead, radiographs obtained with the wrist in radial and ulnar deviation or with the hand gripping forcefully may be needed to reveal the instability of this joint. Magnetic resonance imaging may be required in special cases, as it is the only imaging modality that can directly depict abnormalities of the ligaments.

The influence on subsequent patient management was examined. Patients attending Accident and Emergency over a 25 month period with suspected scaphoid fracture and normal scaphoid series plain films were referred for wrist MRI. Scans comprising T(1) weighted spin echo and short tau inversion recovery (STIR) coronal sequences were performed in a dedicated extremity low field MRI scanner within 14 days of injury. Subsequent effects on patient management were ascertained by clinician completed questionnaire. 195 patients were scanned. There were 37 scaphoid fractures (19%), 28 distal radius fractures (14%), 9 fractures of other carpal bones (5%) and 119 studies with no fracture. The management of 180 patients (92%) was altered as a result of the MRI scan. Occult fractures are present in almost two fifths of patients with suspected scaphoid fracture and normal initial plain films. Half of these are scaphoid fractures. MRI allows an early definitive diagnosis to be made, changing patient management in over 90% of cases and should be regarded as the gold standard investigation in this population."

CD010023,0,2367667,0,Dorsal lunate tilt (DISI configuration): sign of scaphoid fracture displacement.,"Excessive dorsiflexion (dorsal tilting) of the lunate on a lateral wrist radiograph can be an important sign of carpal injury. Lunate dorsiflexion is a well-recognized sign of an intercarpal ligamentous injury pattern known as dorsal intercalated segment instability (DISI). It is less well recognized that excessive dorsal tilting of the lunate (DISI configuration) can also be produced by displacement of a scaphoid waist fracture. Since the management and prognosis of displaced scaphoid fractures may be quite different from those for nondisplaced fractures, radiologists can make an important contribution by recognizing dorsal tilting of the lunate and appreciating that it may be an important, indirect sign of scaphoid fracture displacement, which may not be directly visualized with standard wrist radiography. In this setting, computed tomography or complex motion tomography may be helpful for further evaluation of the scaphoid fracture."
CD010023,0,21780848,0,The non-surgical and surgical treatment of tarsal navicular stress fractures.,"Stress fractures of the tarsal navicular, first described in 1970, were initially thought to be rare injuries. Heightened awareness and increased participation in athletics has resulted in more frequent diagnosis and more aggressive treatment. The vascular supply of the tarsal navicular results in a relatively avascular zone in the central one-third, which experiences severe compressive forces during explosive manoeuvers such as jumping and sprinting. Repetitive activities can result in stress reactions or even fracture. Patients often initially complain of vague midfoot pain localized to the medial border of the foot. The pain is usually exacerbated by activity and relieved with rest. The diagnosis of tarsal navicular stress fracture is challenging because of the high false negative rate of plain radiographs. Additional diagnostic testing with bone scan, CT and MRI are often required for diagnosis. The proper treatment of tarsal navicular stress fractures has become a topic of debate as surgical intervention for these injuries has increased. In a recent meta-analysis, Torg et al. found that 96% of tarsal navicular stress fractures treated with non-weight-bearing (NWB) conservative treatment for 5 weeks went on to successful outcomes. However, only 44% of patients treated with weight-bearing (WB) conservative treatment had successful outcomes. Surgical treatment resulted in successful outcome in 82% of patients. Interestingly, the meta-analysis also found that fracture type did not correlate with outcomes, regardless of treatment. The meta-analysis also found no difference in time to return to activity between patients treated surgically and those who underwent NWB conservative treatment. The recent literature indicates that patients are undergoing surgery or are receiving WB conservative management as a first-line treatment option with the expectation that they will return to their activity more quickly. Although surgical treatment seems increasingly common, the results statistically demonstrate an inferior trend to conservative NWB management.

CD010023,0,20838220,0,Early MRI in the management of the clinical scaphoid fracture.,The 'clinical scaphoid fracture' remains a common problem faced by emergency physicians. Early magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been used to routinely investigate such patients presenting to the emergency department of Aberdeen Royal Infirmary since 2002. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of this strategy in the diagnosis of occult scaphoid fracture.
CD010023,0,15291195,0,Stress fracture of the tarsal navicular.,"Stress fractures of the lower extremity are common among military members and athletes at all levels of participation. They typically occur when an individual begins a new or different type of physical training or during periods of abrupt increase in the level of training. Stress fractures represent an incomplete remodeling of bone that occurs secondary to repetitive mechanical loading. In response to this increased loading, the osteoclastic resorption of lamellar bone outpaces the ability of the osteoblasts to create new lamellar bone, eventually leading to structural failure. The following case report reviews the typical clinical presentation, imaging findings, and treatment of the tarsal navicular stress fracture."
CD010023,0,15513602,0,Experience with the AO Pi-plate for displaced intra-articular fractures of the distal radius.,"We have used open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) with the AO pi-plate in 32 displaced, intra-articular fractures of the distal radius. The indication was a displaced intra-articular fracture with a step-off of more than 1 mm and a gap between fragments of more than 3 mm, judged from the primary computed tomograms (CT). All fractures were classified as AO type C3. Twenty-nine patients were followed-up after a mean of 23 (9-46) months. The dorsal tilt, the radial length, the radial inclination, the articular step-off, and the intra-articular gap between fragments were substantially improved postoperatively. All the patients had excellent or good extra-articular and intra-articular alignment. Two patients had reduced extension power of the first finger. Seventeen patients had Disability of the arm, shoulder, and hand (DASH) scores of less than 10 points, five had scores between 11 and 20, three between 21 and 30, three between 31 and 40, and one patient had a score of 65 points. Complications occurred in two patients: one had a painful amputation neuroma of the superficial radial nerve, and one developed adhesions of the flexor tendons of the second and third fingers because the screws were too long and had penetrated the tendon sheaths. We conclude that the AO pi-plate is an excellent option for the most comminuted fractures of the distal radius."
CD010023,0,10399213,0,Three-dimensional motion patterns of the carpal bones: an in vivo study using three-dimensional computed tomography and clinical applications.,"A three-dimensional (3D) CT technique was developed to analyze in vivo segmental carpal kinematics. Transverse CT data of the distal forearm, carpals and proximal metacarpals was acquired and 3D reconstructed in various wrist positions. Carpal kinematics were analyzed in two groups of 20 asymptomatic volunteers, one group in neutral position, flexion and extension (45 degrees), and the other group in neutral position, radial (15 degrees) and ulnar deviation (30 degrees). Qualitative analysis included the 3D study of carpal anatomy, and comparison of carpal bone position between the different sets of data obtained. Carpal bone motion was quantified using rigid body and finite helical axis concepts. The results, although agreeing in principle with previous findings, showed important individual variations in carpal bone motion. Clinical applications were conducted in a series of 25 patients with various wrist disorders. There was no significant difference between the injured wrist and the heterolateral, asymptomatic wrist, but there was a significant difference between asymptomatic volunteers and both the injured wrist and heterolateral wrist of patients. In particular, scaphoid motion was altered bilaterally in our patient group, suggesting the existence of anatomic and/or kinematic factors predisposing to certain carpal pathologies. This hypothesis needs to be confirmed and refined."

All patients had palmar bone deficiency and a 'difficult' proximal fragment. They were followed up for a minimum of 12 months (12 to 38). Radiological union was achieved in all. In five patients correction of instability of the dorsal intercalary segment which was present before operation, was achieved. On a wrist-scoring chart, all patients had an excellent or good rating.

Because initial roentgenograms are not always definitive, patients suspected of having a scaphoid fracture despite negative initial radiographs should undergo bone scan. Treatment of acute nondisplaced fracture of the scaphoid generally nonoperative, involving immobilization in a cast. Treatment of scaphoid nonunion is generally operative, and many procedures and their associated risks are reviewed. There is no consensus about the clinical implications of scaphoid malunion."

An early MRI scan at 2 weeks allows the clinician to make the appropriate decision in this group of patients whose diagnoses include; occult scaphoid fractures, other occult carpal and radial fractures, ligamentous injuries and those without apparent injuries. MRI has also been useful in defining the group of injuries which may imitate a clinically occult scaphoid fracture."

CD010023,0,17950656,0,Validation of a new surgical procedure for percutaneous scaphoid fixation using intra-operative ultrasound.,"A new technique for percutaneous fixation of non-displaced scaphoid fractures is described. The technique used pre-operative planning from computed tomography images, registration to intra-operatively acquired three-dimensional ultrasound images, and intra-operative guidance using an optical tracking system. Two stand-alone software applications were developed. The first one was used to determine the surgical plan pre-operatively and the second one was used to guide the surgeon during screw insertion. Laboratory validation of the technique included measurements of the inter-operator and intra-operator variability in the outcome of scaphoid fixation using the proposed procedure, and also included comparison of the performance of this procedure with the conventional percutaneous fixation technique using fluoroscopy. The results showed that the tight accuracy requirements of percutaneous scaphoid fixation were met and that the consistency was superior to the conventional technique."
CD010023,0,12601604,0,[Scapholunate ligament tears in MR arthrography compared with wrist arthroscopy].,"In a blinded study from January to July 2000, 125 patients suffering from specific complaints of the wrist were prospectively examined with direct MR arthrography. Within 24 hours an arthroscopy of the wrist was performed. With MR arthrography in 21 patients or 17 % of all patients, injury of the scapho-lunate ligament was diagnosed. In all patients this could be verified arthroscopically. In the remaining 104 patients, no SL-ligament lesions were diagnosed with the MR arthrography. However, partial lesions were found via arthroscopy in seven cases and complete lesions of the ligament were found in one case, where MRI findings expected an intact SL ligament. In the remaining 96 cases, the MRI could correctly exclude a lesion of the SL-ligament. The diagnosis of a SL-ligament lesion by means of MRI was correct in 100 % of the cases (specificity), the exclusion of such lesions in 72 % (sensitivity). Positive or negative predictive values of 100 % or 92 % were achieved. Since a sensitivity of 100 % cannot be reached at the moment, MR arthrography cannot replace arthroscopy. However, it could be a potent additional tool for wrist diagnosis if intraarticular contrast is used. It can facilitate the diagnostics and the indication for surgery of the wrist and help to reduce arthroscopic interventions for purely diagnostic purposes and without any therapeutic consequences. With improvement of the technique of magnet resonance tomography we can expect a further increase of accuracy in the clinical use of the MR arthrography in the diagnostic workup of the wrist."

CD010023,0,12371028,0,Medical history of carpal tunnel syndrome.,"The anatomical configuration of the carpal tunnel is that of an inelastic channel. Consequently, any increase in its volume or alteration in shape will usually result in a significant increase in interstitial pressure. At a pressure threshold of 20 mm Hg to 30 mm Hg, epineurial blood flow is compromised. When that pressure is sustained, the symptoms and physical findings associated with CTS appear. Typically, patients present with intermittent pain and paresthesias in all or part of the median nerve distribution of their hand(s). As weeks and months pass, symptoms progressively increase in frequency and severity. Eventually, thenar muscle weakness develops that initially manifests itself as ""fatigue,"" or ""tiredness."" The progressive increase in symptoms and physical findings, usually accompanied by a progressive deterioration in electrodiagnostic studies, facilitates the classification of the condition into early, intermediate, and advanced stages. The increase in interstitial pressure in the carpal tunnel is in the vast majority of cases idiopathic (spontaneous). It can also be caused by a myriad of other conditions that can be classified into three other categories: intrinsic factors that increase the volume of the tunnel (outside and inside the nerve), extrinsic factors that alter the contour of the tunnel, and repetitive/overuse conditions. In addition, there is another category of neuropathic factors that affect the nerve without increasing interstitial pressure. In rare situations CTS can present as an acute problem. Far less common than the chronic form of the condition, it can follow acute wrist trauma, rheumatologic disorders, hemorrhagic problems, vascular disorders affecting a patent median artery, and high pressure injection injuries. Prompt recognition is important, followed in most cases by urgent surgical decompression of the median nerve."

CD010023,0,10420293,0,[Relation of necrosis to outcome and site of fracture in scaphoid pseudarthrosis].,"Usually, untreated scaphoid fractures lead to non-union and partial or complete avascular necrosis. The purpose of our study was to examine the influence of location and fracture line on the pattern of necrosis. Therefore, 85 patients with scaphoid non-union were examined by enhanced highfield MRI. Fractures were classified by location and fracture line. A staging system based on signal intensity in T1-weighted spin-echo sequences in enhanced MRI was used to evaluate extent and location of avascular necrosis, which was found in 81% of our patients. In our patients, viability of the scaphoid was independent of the fracture line without dominance of vertical oblique fractures (2%). Based on our staging system, signal intensity as a sign of fragment viability was reduced in the proximal fragment in 46 patients, whereas in eight patients the distal fragment showed reduced viability. In 26 patients, no difference was found between proximal and distal fragments. Fractures proximal to the transition of middle to distal third showed less viability of the proximal fragment, not dependent of how proximal the fracture was seen. In triple fractures (6%) signal intensity of scaphoid bone was more reduced in enhanced MRI."
CD010023,0,20032000,0,Percutaneous retrograde screw fixation of non-displaced fractures of the scaphoid waist: an antirotation wire may not be necessary.,Some authors recommend using an antirotation wire when performing percutaneous screw fixation of acute non-displaced scaphoid waist fractures. The aim of this study of 21 cadaveric wrists was to assess the usefulness of such a wire in Herbert's B2-type fractures. A B2-type fracture was created experimentally on each scaphoid. An antirotation wire was inserted in eight wrists. Retrograde percutaneous fixation using a double-threaded headless cannulated screw was performed on all wrists. Computed tomography was used to measure interfragmentary rotation. No interfragmentary rotation was noted in either group. Our study suggests that using an antirotation wire may be unnecessary when performing retrograde percutaneous screw fixation of isolated B2-type scaphoid fractures.
CD010023,0,9480593,0,[Clinical examination of the injured wrist].,"A highly differentiated clinical examination of the wrist joint has been established in the past years. The history of the accident is usually unreliable, but patient's statement of a hyperflexion injury should alert for a fracture of the scaphoid tubercle. First of all, X-rays of the wrist indicate therapy in the case of fractures and gross dislocations. Only after some days of reduction of pain and swelling, a thorough clinical examination will be possible, which consists of: localizing points of tenderness, in particular the scapho- lunate, lunato-triquetal and the scapho-trapezio-trapezoid (SL-, LT- and STT-) joints and the triangular fibrocartilage (TFC); testing for abnormal dorso-palmar shifts of the carpus and the ulnar head; provoking catch up clunks by radio-ulnar movements of the clenched fist; provoking subluxations, in particular of the scaphoid in Watson's test; provoking pain in the discuss grinding test. Comparing clinical diagnosis with arthroscopic findings in 37 patients, the results for ligamentous lesions in general, SL ligament lesions in particular and for TFC lesions were as follows: sensitivity 100%, 91% and 69%, resp.; specificity 77%, 77% and 67%, resp.; positive predictive values 75%, 62% and 61%, respectively. In conclusion, exact clinical examination is a reliable tool to determine further diagnostics and therapy of wrist injuries."

CD010023,0,10835123,0,Metal artifact reduction sequence: early clinical applications.,"Artifact arising from metal hardware remains a significant problem in orthopedic magnetic resonance imaging. The metal artifact reduction sequence (MARS) reduces the size and intensity of susceptibility artifacts from magnetic field distortion. The sequence, which is based on view angle tilting in combination with increased gradient strength, can be conveniently used in conjunction with any spin-echo sequence and requires no additional imaging time. In patients with persistent pain after femoral neck fracture, the MARS technique allows visualization of marrow adjacent to hip screws, thus enabling diagnosis or exclusion of avascular necrosis. Other applications in the hip include assessment of periprosthetic soft tissues after hip joint replacement surgery, postoperative assessment after resection of bone tumors and reconstruction, and localization of unopacified methyl methacrylate cement prior to hip arthroplasty revision surgery. In the knee, the MARS technique allows visualization of structures adjacent to implanted metal staples, pins, or screws. The technique can significantly improve visualization of periprosthetic bone and soft-tissue structures even in patients who have undergone total knee arthroplasty. In patients with spinal fixation hardware, the MARS technique frequently allows visualization of the vertebral bodies and spinal canal contents. The technique can be helpful after wrist fusion or screw fixation of scaphoid fractures."

CD010023,0,12537171,0,Tarsal navicular stress fractures.,"Stress fractures of the tarsal navicular bone are being recognized with increasing frequency in physically active persons. Diagnosis is commonly delayed, and outcome often suffers because physicians lack familiarity with the condition. Navicular stress fractures typically present in a running athlete who has gradually increasing pain in the dorsal mid-foot with occasional radiation of pain down the medial arch. Because initial plain films are often normal, the next diagnostic test of choice is triple-phase bone scan, which is positive early in the process and localizes the lesion well. After a positive bone scan, a computed tomographic scan should be obtained to provide anatomic detail and guide therapy. Nondisplaced, noncomminuted fractures respond well to six weeks of non-weight-bearing cast immobilization. Displacement, comminution, and delayed or nonunion fractures are indications for surgical open reduction internal fixation."

CD010023,0,9509598,0,Short tau inversion recovery magnetic resonance imaging in occult scaphoid injuries: effect on management.,"Over a 21-month period, 16 patients with possible scaphoid fractures, where conventional radiographs were essentially normal on the day of injury and 10 days later, were examined by coronal short tau inversion recovery (STIR) and T1 weighted sequences on a 0.2 Tesla scanner. The magnetic resonance (MR) examinations were done in between electively booked patients and management was altered in 50% of patients. It was expedient to do MR as radio-isotope facilities were not available at the hospital. In four patients, the examination was entirely normal. In another four patients, intercarpal fluid collections only were demonstrated (two generalized and two localized). In these patients a plaster cast was not re-applied. In two patients, bony injuries of the distal radius were demonstrated instead, with the scaphoid being normal. In the remaining six patients, variable appearances were shown, ranging from an actual fracture line demonstrated on both STIR and T1-weighted images with the remainder of the scaphoid being hyperintense on STIR and hypointense on T1, to non-visualization of the actual fracture line, which appeared to be represented by a much more hyperintense band through the waist of an otherwise hyperintense scaphoid on the STIR sequence. In all these patients a plaster cast was re-applied empirically, including those patients with a definite fracture and those patients with apparent bone contusion only. Although the T1-weighted images were anatomically superior, their addition did not alter management and it is suggested that coronal STIR images should suffice to demonstrate occult fractures of the scaphoid."

Plain radiography and CT allow an accurate anatomical approach of morphological changes associated with avascular necrosis of the lunate and the scaphoid fracture with complications. CT is readily available to detect nondisplaced fractures. However, early forms of necrosis can be misdiagnosed and evaluation of bone vitality is impossible. MRI is the best imaging modality to detect avascular necrosis and the intravenous injection of gadolinium improves the specificity of diagnosis of necrosis. The lack of enhancement of the proximal fragment of the scaphoid leads the surgeon to use a vascular graft in the treatment of nonunion. The technique has its limitations. The bone necrosis is histologically complex and contrast enhancement does not mean necessarily viability. However, MRI is still the most powerful imaging modality in the assessment of the bone marrow."

We ascertained the safe position of a screw using virtual collision experiments on a three-dimensionally reconstructed scaphoid bone and screw model, and applied measured angles to simple radiographs. We used images from computed tomograms of the wrists taken from 13 men to reconstruct a three-dimensional cortical image of the scaphoid. Inside the bone, we inserted a virtually reconstructed Herbert screw model and calculated the safe angle along the long axis of the scaphoid at which the screw did not collide with the bone in any sample, then applied measured safe angles to simple anteroposterior and lateral radiographs. In all experiments, the safe angle between the screw and the anteroposterior scaphoid line (defined from the most distal portion of the scaphoid where it met the capitate to the proximal position where the lunate and capitate meet) ranged from 8° to 27° in the anteroposterior view, and the safe angle between the screw and the lateral scaphoid line (defined from the most volar portion of the scaphoid tuberosity to the volar position where the scaphoid faced the radius) ranged from 2° to 26° in the lateral view. These ranges can be used as a guide for a safe position of the screw within the scaphoid in volar percutaneous fixation of screws in scaphoid fractures."

The modalities discussed allow the reader to treat patients in an expeditious and accurate manner."
CD010023,0,10622486,1,Diagnosis of scaphoid fracture and dedicated extremity MRI.,"We evaluated the value of dedicated extremity magnetic resonance imaging (E-MRI) in patients with clinical suspicion of a scaphoid fracture and normal initial radiographs. 52 patients underwent E-MRI within a mean of 4 (2-10) days after trauma. Follow-up radiographs were performed at average 11 (8-14) weeks after trauma, and these images were used as the ""gold standard"". A T1-weighted turbo gradient echo 3D and a tau short inversion recovery STIR were performed, both in coronal planes. The imaging time was less than 10 min. The images were evaluated independently by two radiologists. E-MRI detected occult fractures of the scaphoid in 9 patients, and of the distal radius in a further 6 patients. All these fractures were confirmed at follow-up radiographs. Furthermore, E-MRI revealed a fracture of the capitate bone in 1 patient, and of the triquetrum in 2 patients, and in 8 patients, bone bruise in 1 or more of the carpal bones. However, these fractures and bone lesions could not be confirmed by the follow-up radiographs. The agreement between the two examiners was high (kappa = 0.8) for E-MRI detection of fractures. E-MRI seems to be better than radiographs in the early diagnosis of occult fractures of the scaphoid bone and the wrist."
CD010023,0,10447631,0,Role of metaphyseal cancellous bone defect size in secondary displacement in Colles' fracture.,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of the metaphyseal cancellous bone defect size in secondary dislocation of Colles' fracture. Thirty-five patients with a dislocated Colles' fracture were examined by computed tomography (CT) for metaphyseal bone defects. The size of the defect was assessed and related to the surface area of the cross-section of the distal radius at the site of the defect. The relative size of the defect correlated with the severity of dorsal angulation of the fracture but not with the shortening of the radius seen after cast immobilization. We concluded that secondary displacement of the distal radius is partly mediated through the metaphyseal cancellous bone defect, and to prevent malunion in dorsal angulation, operative treatment or possibly filling of the defect should be considered even as early as during primary reduction if a large defect is suspected."

CD010023,0,10433424,0,Load transfer analysis of the distal radius from in-vivo high-resolution CT-imaging.,"Prevention of osteoporotic bone fractures requires accurate diagnostic methods to detect the increase in bone fragility at an early stage of osteoporosis. However, today's bone fracture risk prediction, primarily based on bone density measurement, is not sufficiently precise. There is increasing evidence that, in addition to bone density, also the bone microarchitecture and its mechanical loading conditions are important factors determining the fracture risk. Recently, it has been shown that new high-resolution imaging techniques in combination with new computer modeling techniques based on the finite-element (FE) method can account for these additional factors. These techniques might provide information that is more relevant for the prediction of bone fracture risk. So far, however, these new imaged-based FE techniques have not been feasible in-vivo. The objectives of this study were to quantify the load transfer through the trabecular network in a distal radius using a computer model based on in-vivo high-resolution images and to determine if common regions of fractures can be explained as a result of high tissue loading in these regions. The left distal radius and the two adjacent carpal bones of a healthy volunteer were imaged using a high-resolution three-dimensional CT system providing an isotropic resolution of 165 microm. The bone representation was converted into a FE-model that was used to calculate stresses and strains in the trabecular network. The two carpal bones were loaded using different load ratios (for each load case 1000 N in total) representing impact forces on the hand either in near-neutral position or ulnar/radial deviation. The load transfer through the trabecular network of the radius was characterized by the tissue strain energy density (SED) distribution for all load cases. It was found that the distribution of the tissue loading depends on the ratio of the forces acting on the carpal bones. For all load cases the higher SED values (on average: 0.02 +/- 0.08 (S.D.) N mm(-2)) are found in a 10 mm region adjacent to the articular surface which corresponds well with the region where Colles- or Chauffeur-fractures occur. We expect that, eventually, this new approach can lead to a better prediction of the fracture risk than methods based on bone density alone since it accounts for the bone microstructure as well as its loading conditions."

CD010023,0,3833952,0,The sore wrist without a fracture.,"The possible causes of wrist pain in a patient with normal roentgenograms are many, and the above discussion of differential diagnosis is by no means intended to be all inclusive. Rather, my intent has been to provide a checklist of some of the more likely causes as well as a systematic approach to the identification of the cause. Many of the tests described are somewhat costly (Table 31-3), and they should not be ordered indiscriminately. Rather, the need for each test is determined by a reasonable presumptive diagnosis, depending on the history, clinical examination, and routine roentgenograms (see Table 31-1). Finally, I must say that even an exhaustive work-up may not be fruitful, and occasionally the precise cause for the patient's pain is never clearly identified. Our knowledge of the wrist is incomplete, and our diagnostic tools are not infallible, but we must continue to try to sort out these difficult wrist problems. The ultimate solutions to many of these enigmas will be dependent on our ability to correlate specific signs and symptoms with appropriate diagnostic modalities and observations at the time of operation."

CD010023,0,2011836,0,[Diagnosis of arthritis with the aid of imaging methods].,"Among imaging techniques plain radiographs still play an outstanding role in the assessment of osteoarthrosis. Main diagnostic features comprise joint space narrowing (often segmental in the initial phase), subchondral sclerosis and cyst formation (both predominantly in the stressed area of the joint), and osteophytes at areas of low stress, often at joint margins. Anatomy and stress characteristics of the joint involved decide upon pattern and extent of the degenerative changes. The most common sites of osteoarthrosis include the interphalangeal joints, often in combination with the first carpometacarpal and trapezio-scaphoid joints, hip, knee, and first metatarsophalangeal joint of the foot. For assessment of these easily accessible joints, conventional radiographic techniques usually provide sufficient information. In special situations where differential diagnostics are important, methods such as computerized tomography or scintigraphy may prove very helpful. In the hands of experienced users ultrasonography is able to depict accompanying soft tissue changes such as rotator cuff ruptures or cysts. Magnetic resonance imaging represents a promising tool for detection of very early osteoarthrosis; small areas of cartilage damage can be assessed adequately. Although this method will certainly give new insight into aspects of early degenerative disease, its use is still confined to research-oriented applications with respect to osteoarthrosis."

CD010023,0,12467720,0,Segmentation of carpal bones from CT images using skeletally coupled deformable models.,"The in vivo investigation of joint kinematics in normal and injured wrist requires the segmentation of carpal bones from 3D (CT) images, and their registration over time. The non-uniformity of bone tissue, ranging from dense cortical bone to textured spongy bone, the irregular shape of closely packed carpal bones, small inter-bone spaces compared to the resolution of CT images, along with the presence of blood vessels, and the inherent blurring of CT imaging render the segmentation of carpal bones a challenging task. We review the performance of statistical classification, deformable models (active contours), region growing, region competition, and morphological operations for this application. We then propose a model which combines several of these approaches in a unified framework. Specifically, our approach is to use a curve evolution implementation of region growing from initialized seeds, where growth is modulated by a skeletally-mediated competition between neighboring regions. The inter-seed skeleton, which we interpret as the predicted boundary of collision between two regions, is used to couple the growth of seeds and to mediate long-range competition between them. The implementation requires subpixel representations of each growing region as well as the inter-region skeleton. This method combines the advantages of active contour models, region growing, and both local and global region competition methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach for our application where many of the difficulties presented above are overcome as illustrated by synthetic and real examples. Since this segmentation method does not rely on domain-specific knowledge, it should be applicable to a range of other medical imaging segmentation tasks."

CD010023,0,1757132,0,Scaphoid fractures and wrist pain--time for new thinking.,"As with the practice of all medicine, an early accurate diagnosis is essential. The same applies after injury. The diagnosis should be made at the earliest opportunity--this should be done as soon as an appropriate expert is able to examine the patient, assess adequate radiographs and, where necessary, order special investigations such as a bone scan. By this means, distal radial fractures, injuries of the radioulna joint, dislocated lunates, Bennett's fractures, dorsal capsular wrist sprains, avulsion fractures etc. can be managed accordingly. Those patients in whom clinical examination, plain radiographs and/or bone scans show minor injuries can be advised about pain relief whilst staying active either at work or in the home using a light supportive removable bandage or splint. Where doubt remains and whilst keeping the patient comfortable, a bone scan may be requested. Its availability together with updated clinical and, if necessary, radiological assessment, will define a further group of patients who can be advised definitively either about active treatment or a return to normal activity. Only a few wrists will continue to defy definitive diagnosis requiring the continuance of expert advice and investigation. When a scaphoid fracture is diagnosed, its site, degree of displacement and any associated instability should determine the degree of intervention and the length of time required in plaster. This again gives the patient more information about the long-term future than many have had hitherto. The patient's individual requirements may be taken into account; some are happy to tolerate 2-3 months in plaster whilst others want the early function which an uncomplicated operation might offer.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

We report a unique case of displaced isolated triquetral body fracture that was initially missed on plain radiographs and resulted in non-union. The fracture non-union was diagnosed on magnetic resonance imaging and was treated successfully with open reduction and internal fixation using compression screws, without bone grafting, and early mobilisation of the wrist allowing a return to premorbid activity levels. To our knowledge, this has not been previously described in the literature.

CD010023,0,3818807,0,"Fractures of the carpus, excluding the scaphoid.","Carpal bone fractures comprise an important group of injuries that present difficulties in both diagnosis and treatment. These fractures may be missed for the following reasons: physician's low index of suspicion, the carpal bones' irregular contours and degree of overlap on radiographs making the fractures difficult to visualize, and the common occurrence of concomitant fractures of neighboring metacarpals, distal radius, or scaphoid, which misdirects the examiner. A high index of suspicion with careful clinical examination and elicitation of point tenderness is key to making the correct diagnosis (Fig. 14). Swelling, loss of motion, deformity, and crepitus are often minimal and are not reliable in distinguishing carpal fractures. Specific radiographic projections, tomograms, computerized tomographic scans, or bone scans are often required and should be considered in any wrist injury where the diagnosis is in question. A greater awareness of the fracture types, methods of diagnosis, and choices of treatment is essential for optimal management of these injuries."

This ligament allows us to present the proximal carpal row as a socket, consisting of an upper part (the triquetrum, distal part of the scaphoid, and the dorsal and palmar scapho-triquetral ligament), and a base (the concave parts of the lunatum and scaphoid, connected by the scapho-lunate ligament). With a hyperextension wrist injury the upper part follows the distal part of the carpus, while the base remains fixed at the radius. The upper part slips away from the base, consequently, injuring the ligamentous structure, or causing a scaphoid fracture. The luno-triquetral and the palmar scapho-triquetral ligaments are also frequently torn. The overall prognosis depends on the grade of ligament damage. The arthroscopy allows us to estimate the state of the ligament structures, therefore, it is indicated before any reconstructive operation."

Concern about cost containment in healthcare delivery prompts the question of whether the two studies provide comparable information and at what cost. Common intraarticular distal radial fractures were created in 12 lightly embalmed cadaveric specimens. The fractures were fixed with radiolucent Kirschner wires. Articular step off was measured with a caliper. Plain radiographs, computed tomography scans, and trispiral tomograms were obtained of each specimen. Maximal step off was measured blindly by two musculoskeletal radiologists and four hand surgeons. The radiographic measurements were compared with the actual step off and expressed as a positive or negative deviation from the actual value. There was no statistically significant difference between computed tomography scans and tomograms in predicting step off. In addition, the difference between actual and radiographic measurements was insignificant in tomogram readings and different in one of the computed tomography measurements. In the authors' institution, a tomogram costs $200, and a computed tomography scan costs $562. Trispiral tomography is more accurate and cost effective than computed tomography, and thus when available should be considered the imaging modality of choice for assessing articular step off in distal radius fractures."

SOS was measured along the proximal phalanges of the second, third and fourth fingers using an ultrasound (US) system operating in axial transmission mode. The bone mineral density (BMD) of the radius and the phalanges was also measured with quantitative computed tomography (QCT) and dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and the combined cortical thickness (CCT) of the phalanges was measured from hand radiographs. After the measurements were completed, the radius was excised from the cadaver, embedded in polymethylmethacrylate and tested to failure on a servohydraulic testing machine. The configuration of the radius was chosen to simulate a fall onto the hand. Linear regression analysis showed a highly significant correlation between SOS (r = 0.76-0.94, p < 0.001), CCT (r = 0.86-0.90, p < 0.001) and BMD (r = 0.92-0.96, p < 0.0001) in the three proximal phalanges measured. SOS, BMD and CCT were significant predictors of fracture load (r = 0.60-0.69, p < 0.03) and stress (r = 0.65-0.77, p < 0.02). Cortical area and bone mineral content (BMC) of the radius were consistently higher predictors of fracture load (r = 0.76-0.82, p < 0.01 for area and r = 0.78-0.88, p < 0.01 for BMC) than BMD. The correlation of BMC and area was poorer with fracture stress. In a step-wise regression analysis using both phalangeal BMD and SOS, only SOS remained a significant predictor of fracture stress. In forward stepwise regression analysis, both cortical area and SOS were entered into the regression model to estimate fracture load. Only SOS remained significant in the model for estimating fracture stress. Phalangeal BMD was only entered in the combined model with the cortical area at the 4% site (r = 0.84, p = 0.002). Phalangeal SOS is a useful parameter in the assessment of bone status of the radius."
CD010023,0,11372305,0,Traumatic and reconstructive problems of the scaphoid.,"The management of acute scaphoid fractures should be oriented on the concept of fracture stability, ease of reduction, associated ligamentous injury, and risk of impaired blood supply, rather than the direction of the fracture line or location of the fracture within the scaphoid. The lack of predictability of successful fracture union and prognostic discrepancies of historic and contemporary classifications may be related to subtle differences of the internal vascular architecture of each scaphoid. Because the possibility of impaired vascularity is greater with fractures located in the proximal third, stable internal fixation is indicated to provide mechanical stability and fracture surface contact to enhance revascularization. Improved healing rates in a shorter time and earlier rehabilitation with percutaneous techniques of internal fixation have produced a clear shift from classic conservative treatment to internal skeletal fixation. Although the rates of union of well-vascularized nonunions have not been dramatically improved with the use of internal fixation as compared with inlay bone grafting, the restoration of scaphoid anatomy and prevention of malunion and associated carpal collapse with interpositional bone grafting techniques will reduce the risk of osteoarthritis."
CD010023,0,21869681,0,Outcome of wrist injuries with clinical suspicion of scaphoid injury after normal computed tomography.,"Wrist injuries are a common presentation to emergency departments. A clinical pathway has recently been introduced in our institution for patients with clinical suspicion of a scaphoid injury, using computed tomography (CT) at 2 weeks postinjury to rule out scaphoid fracture. However, it is not known what happens to patients who have a normal CT after such an injury. The aim of this pilot study was to assess disability after CT-negative wrist injuries."
CD010023,0,11287864,0,[Imaging of the wrist and of the hand: what is the best modality?].,"The authors describe the indications for radiologic explorations in case of traumatic as well as non-traumatic conditions. In case of trauma of the wrist, the radiologic exploration looks for a fracture, a dislocation or a ligament injury. Initially, postero-antérior and lateral views must be completed with an antero-posterior view, a scaphoid incidence and an oblique view. This initial examination can be completed secondarily by specific views for the carpal bones, dynamic X-Rays, CT scan or arthro CT scan. In non-traumatic cases, radiologic explorations look for osteo-articular or soft tissue abnormalities specific of a inflammatory or degenerative disease. The initial incidence is a postero-anterior view of both hands. It can be completed secondarly by other explorations (other X-Rays, Ultra-sound, CT scan or MRI)."
CD010023,0,12772060,0,[Combined palmar and dorsal approach for complex distal radius fractures].,The purpose of this paper was to describe our management of complex fractures of the distal radius using a combined dorsal and palmar approach and to evaluate the radiological and clinical outcome.
CD010023,0,18166960,0,[Bilateral fracture of the pisiform bone].,"Fracture of the pisiform bone is exceptional compared with the other carpal bones. Such lesions may be missed in the emergency room because of the complex anatomy of the carpal region. The usual circumstances leading to fracture of the pisiform bone include fall with reception on the hyperextended wrist, traffic accidents, and blunt trauma. The purpose of this work was to present a case of bilateral fracture of the pisiform bones. A 34-year-old woman presented with pain along the ulnar borders of both wrists after a fall. The mechanism of fracture was direct trauma on both hands after reception in radial inclination. The diagnosis was established late and conservative treatment was applied. After simple immobilization, the clinical and functional outcome was excellent. The anatomic position of the pisiform bone exposes it to direct trauma. Late diagnosis can favor osteoarthritic sequelae involving the pisotriquetral joint."
CD010023,0,17299354,0,[Imaging of wrist injuries in athletes].,"Wrist imaging is currently used for diagnosis of sport injuries as part of a global strategy of rapid recovery. Standard x-rays are the first step in this procedure. Although arthrography is still the reference for the diagnosis of intrinsic ligament and cartilaginous lesions, MRI can sometimes be sufficient. Ultrasonography is a dynamic process and is accurate in detecting tendon injuries. Wrist sport injuries are frequent and often asymptomatic. Here we review the usual aspects of bone, ligament, and tendon lesions encountered in each sport, while providing advice on the most appropriate imaging for each clinical symptom."
CD010023,0,22648431,0,Imaging and treatment of scaphoid fractures and their complications.,"The scaphoid is the most commonly fractured carpal bone, with frequent complications that are predisposed by its anatomical location, anatomical configuration (shape and length), and vascular supply. The most common mechanism of injury is a fall onto an outstretched hand. Imaging plays a significant role in the initial evaluation and treatment of scaphoid fractures and their complications. Radiography should be the first imaging modality in the initial evaluation and follow-up of scaphoid fractures. Computed tomography with its superb spatial resolution enables better visualization and characterization of the fracture line, and the amount of displacement and angulation of the fracture fragments. Using the metal reduction artifact with computed tomography allows good follow-up of scaphoid fractures despite surgical hardware. Magnetic resonance imaging without contrast is the imaging modality of choice for depiction of radiographically occult scaphoid fracture, bone contusion, and associated soft tissue injury; contrast-enhanced imaging aids assessment of scaphoid fracture nonunion, osteonecrosis, fracture healing after bone grafting, and revitalization of the necrotic bone after bone grafting. Proper identification and classification of scaphoid fracture and its complications is necessary for appropriate treatment. This article describes the normal anatomy, mechanism of injury, and classification of stable and unstable fractures, together with the imaging and treatment algorithm of scaphoid fractures and their complications with an emphasis on magnetic resonance imaging."
CD010023,0,11885387,0,Hamatometacarpal fracture-dislocation: distinctive three dimensional computed tomographic appearance.,"We report here two fully documented cases of hamatometacarpal fracture-dislocation following trauma and treated in our hospital. In our cases, the patients suffered hamate fracture in association with metacarpal dislocation. In the first case, a dorsal oblique fracture of the hamate was associated with a dorsal dislocation of the base of the fourth metacarpal. In the second case, a dorsal oblique fracture of the hamate was not associated with a dorsal dislocation of the base of the fifth metacarpal. This diagnosis should be suspected on initial review of plain radiographs, which must include an oblique view because of diagnostic difficulty for this injury. We recommend three dimensional computed tomography (3D-CT) in any patient presenting with pain after blunt trauma to the hand to prevent in diagnosis. Open reduction and internal fixation of the fracture is indicated and relevant for displaced fracture."
CD010023,0,7553023,0,Avascular necrosis of carpal bones.,"MR imaging is extremely well suited to detection of early phases of avascular necrosis, permitting diagnosis before collapse of the carpal bones has occurred. The sensitivity of this imaging modality allows differentiation of subtle changes in the bone marrow signal. This is used as criteria for a new stage classification of Kienböck's disease based on MR imaging appearance. The prognosis of scaphoid fractures and estimation of likelihood of avascular necrosis of the proximal fragment can be inferred by using gadolinium enhancement to evaluate the bone marrow vascularity."

CD010023,0,18753895,0,Qualitative and quantitative assessment of bone fragility and fracture healing using conventional radiography and advanced imaging technologies--focus on wrist fracture.,"Fractures of the distal radius are one of the most common injuries presented to orthopaedic surgeons. A variety of treatment options are available for the vast array of fracture patterns. Research that explores bone fragility and fracture healing has led to new treatment modalities. As new products and methods are derived to aid in fracture healing it is essential to develop noninvasive and/or nondestructive techniques to assess structural information about bone. Quantitative assessment of macro-structural characteristics such as geometry, and microstructural features such as relative trabecular volume, trabecular spacing, and connectivity may improve our ability to estimate bone strength. Methods for quantitatively assessing macrostructure include (besides conventional radiographs) dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and computed tomography (CT), particularly volumetric quantitative computed tomography (vQCT). Methods for assessing microstructure of trabecular bone include high resolution computed tomography (hrCT), micro computed tomography (microCT), high resolution magnetic resonance (hrMR), and micro magnetic resonance microMR. Volumetric QCT, hrCT and hrMR are generally applicable in vivo; microCT and microMR are principally applicable in vitro. Clinically, the challenges for bone imaging include balancing the advantages of simple bone densitometry versus the more complex architectural features of bone, or the deeper research requirements versus the broader clinical needs."
CD010023,0,11147694,0,Bilateral isolated tarsal navicular fracture dislocation: a case report.,"Fracture-dislocation of the tarsal navicular is rare injury because of strong ligamentous support on both its plantar and dorsal sides. The authors report a case of a twenty-five-year-old man who sustained bilateral isolated tarsal navicular fracture-dislocations, treated by open reduction and internal fixation combined with external fixation. The patient reported no difficulty in activities of daily living, but T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging showed a low-intensity area in right tarsal navicular, raising suspicion of osteonecrosis when he was last seen two year three months after operation."
CD010023,0,18753897,0,Assessment of inducible fracture micromotion in distal radial fractures using radiostereometry.,This study examined the potential for measuring dynamic inducible micromotion (DIMM) between fragments in healing distal radial fractures using radiostereometry (RSA).
CD010023,0,18753891,0,Whole bone geometry and bone quality in distal forearm fracture.,"Fracture of the distal radius is a sentinel for future increased risk of other ""osteoporotic"" fractures, in which the peak age for incidence of distal radius fracture is 5 to 10 years before that for spine and hip fractures. Mean bone mineral density (BMD) of the distal radius was lower in patients with osteoporosis compared with age- and sex-matched normal subjects. However, it has been shown that to predict the strength of the distal radius at the site where fractures occur requires more than measurement of bone mineral content (BMC) or BMD. Only moderate correlations have been found between forearm sites, which may be a result of differences in bone composition between sites. Different forearm sites may be used interchangeably for diagnostic purposes, but the prognostic value is not known. Using the distal radius as a screening tool for identifying individuals at risk of ""osteoporotic"" fracture shows that forearm site selection and accuracy of measurement can be important confounders in group studies.Improving resolution of computed tomography (CT) scanners has enabled quantitation of cortical bone density and cortical thickness. These measurements have enabled the mechanism of bone loss in the distal radius to be elucidated and show that, after menopause, bone loss is primarily through thinning of the cortex. CT imaging allows the precise localization of bone changes in individuals and should be of value in the assessment of the severity of osteoporosis. It also shows that this technology has the potential to determine the efficacy of therapeutic interventions. A concerted effort has been made to elucidate the interrelationships between the amount of bone and the geometry and that clinical imaging of BMC and/or cross-sectional area in the radius would provide improved prediction of an individual's risk of fracture.The technological tools are available, in the clinic, to accurately measure the 3-dimensional (3D) geometry of the distal radius and the amount of bone. In addition, the cortical and cancellous bone compartments can be analyzed separately. This capability, along with the easy accessibility of the distal radius to clinical imaging modalities, provides an excellent framework for longitudinal prospective studies to determine morphologic risk factors for osteoporotic fractures of the distal radius."
CD010023,0,1718357,0,Preiser's disease.,"Nine patients with the diagnosis of unilateral Preiser's disease were seen between 1970 and 1987. The mean age of four male and five female patients was 37 years (range, 20 to 70 years). The diagnosis was based on radiographic evidence of sclerosis, fragmentation, erosion, and collapse of the proximal pole of the scaphoid. Onset was usually insidious but two had a preexisting radial hypoplasia, a third had a modest scaphoid malunion, and a fourth had a recent fall. Treatment consisted of scaphoid excision and silicone rubber prosthetic replacement in three, debridement of necrotic bone fragments in one, and different periods of cast support and observation in the remaining five. No relationship to ulnar variance was seen. Mean follow-up was 6.9 years. Of the scaphoid implants, two had subluxated, but only one was painful. In the more conservatively treated group, pain and function were only modestly limiting in four, who returned to their original occupations as did the one treated by curettage of necrotic bone in the proximal pole. One patient (case 4) was severely incapacitated because of associated severe congenital anomalies of the lower extremities. Polyaxial tomography permitted a better assessment of the degree of involvement and carpal alignment. Preiser's disease is a rare affliction of the carpal scaphoid which may involve the entire bone in avascular changes but primarily leads to fragmentation and collapse of the proximal pole. A conservative approach to treatment is favored based on this experience."
CD010023,0,11147693,0,Distal radius epiphysiolysis associated with scaphoid fractures in immature patients: report of two cases and review of the literature.,Two cases of carpal scaphoid fractures associated with distal radius epiphysiolysis are presented. Only three cases of this unlikely combination were found in the English literature. One of the scaphoid fractures had to be confirmed by bone scan. Conservative treatment after gentle reduction of the radius fracture gave excellent results.
CD010023,0,18753892,0,Quantification of bone structural parameters and mechanical competence at the distal radius.,"For the clinician, predicting the fracture risk for individual patients is mainly restricted to the quantitative analysis of bone density. Several studies have shown that bone strength, an indicator for bone fracture risk, is only predicted moderately by bone density, indicating that there are other factors influencing bone competence. However, the relative importance of ""bone quantity"" and ""bone quality"" remains poorly understood. The objectives of this article are to describe some of the techniques used to measure the microarchitectural aspects of bone quality, how they can be quantified, and how these quantitative endpoints can be used in the assessment of bone competence. Special focus will be on the distal radius, a site with a high fracture incidence. With the introduction of high-resolution in vivo bone imaging systems, a new generation of imaging instruments has entered the arena allowing the reconstruction of the 3-dimensional microarchitecture of the bones at the wrist, thereby giving researchers and clinicians a powerful tool for the quantitative assessment of bone microstructure. In combination with large-scale finite element modeling, these methodologies have reached a level that it is now becoming possible to assess bone stiffness and strength in humans in a clinical setting. The procedure can help improve predictions of fracture risk, clarify the pathophysiology of skeletal diseases, and monitor the response to therapy."
CD010023,0,7061014,0,The diagnostic value of displacement of the fat stripe in fracture of the scaphoid bone.,"Soft tissue abnormalities on radiological examination can be useful in evaluating injury to various regions. In a retrospective study of X-ray pictures of 125 patients with injury to the wrist, it was possible to demonstrate an abnormal scaphoid fat stripe (SFS) in seventy-three out of seventy-eight cases with fracture of the scaphoid bone, compared to ten out of forty-seven cases without fracture."
CD010023,0,16019741,0,Combined fractures of the body and hook of hamate: a form of ulnar axial injury of the wrist.,"Fractures of the hamate are rare, and usually associated with athletes. We describe an unusual form of the injury involving fractures of the hook as well as an intra-articular medial facet. It is likely to be a result of high velocity ulnar component of the axial injury. Surgical treatment is advocated to achieve accurate reduction and apposition of the fifth carpometacarpal joint."
CD010023,0,17049527,0,The management of wrist injuries: an international perspective.,"Wrist injury is common and may significantly impair the overall function of the upper extremity unless properly managed. Fractures of the distal radius are particularly common among the aging population, accounting for nearly 1/6 of all fractures, often as a result of increased longevity with the subsequent underlying osteoporosis. New diagnostic tools, including wrist arthroscopy, magnetic resonance imaging, or computed tomography, are increasingly available in developed countries allowing accurate recognition and more effective resolution of lesions which would be otherwise missed using conventional methods. First world treatment standards, however, can scarcely be introduced in developing countries owing to, among other factors, different prevalence of problems, and the lack of resource to implement most modern technologies. If any program needs to be introduced that meets the demands of wrist injury management in the third world, aside from a better regionalisation of trauma care, it should emphasise adequate training of professionals in the use of more cost effective techniques of fracture reduction and stabilisation, applicable everywhere, with the minimum possible morbidity."
CD010023,0,15062213,0,Fractures of the navicular.,"Generally, large or significantly displaced intra-articular navicular fractures are treated best by surgical intervention. Open reduction and internal fixation of these injuries allow anatomic restoration of adjacent joint surfaces and preservation of length and stability along the medial column of the foot; intervention must not disrupt the already tenuous blood Supply of the tarsal navicular because of the associated risks of avascular necrosis and nonunion. The unique morphology and vital role of the navicular as a cornerstone of the talonavicular joint require every effort to maintain the congruity and motion of this joint to avoid later fusion. The likelihood for successful reduction decreases with increasing grades of injury. The naviculo-cuneiform joint, alternatively, requires stability for proper foot function and can be fused, if necessary, to improve fixation or enhance vascularity to the navicular. External fixation, bone grafting (often and early), and limited peritarsal fusion also have evolved into useful aids, under certain circumstances, to facilitate the goals of navicular fracture management. Early postoperative range of motion, prolonged protected weight bearing, and aggressive patient counseling as to the severity and long-term implications of these injuries also are paramount to success. Caution also must be exercised in managing navicular dislocations because of the potential long-term complications of redislocation or painful flatfoot deformity if alignment is not maintained. Navicular fracture care remains a challenge to the orthopedic surgeon; successful surgical intervention continues to hinge upon a careful balance between an operative exposure that is limited enough to avoid further devascularization but extensive enough to permit anatomic reduction and rigid internal fixation."
CD010023,0,2105027,0,Is MR better than arthrography for evaluating the ligaments of the wrist? In vitro study.,"The purpose of this study was to determine the relative merits of MR imaging and three-compartment digital arthrography in the assessment of carpal ligaments in vitro. We performed MR imaging and arthrography in 10 normal wrists of fresh cadavers ranging in age from 48 to 71 years, and compared the appearance of the interosseous ligaments and triangular fibrocartilage complex with findings on anatomic sections of the joints. In six of the specimens, relatively T1-weighted MR images, 800/20 (TR/TE), preceded three-compartment digital arthrography performed with standard contrast material. In the other four specimens, arthrography, using an MR solution of iodinated contrast material mixed with cupric sulfate and gelatin, was performed before MR imaging. This was done to mimic the intraarticular fluid that might be seen in an injured wrist. MR allowed accurate assessment of the triangular fibrocartilage complex and scapholunate ligament in eight of 10 cases. Consistent MR visualization of the lunotriquetral ligament was difficult. Three-compartment digital arthrography allowed accurate assessment of the triangular fibrocartilage complex and scapholunate and lunotriquetral ligaments in all 10 cases. We concluded that MR is useful but inferior to arthrography in the evaluation of interosseous ligaments and the triangular fibrocartilage complex."
CD010023,0,2354388,0,Computed tomography of wrist trauma.,"We devised a rapid and sensitive computed tomography (CT) method to assess the acutely injured wrist, healing carpal fractures and post-traumatic osteonecrosis, when the plain films offer insufficient information. The wrist is positioned in a simple reverse-L-shaped Perspex immobilizer. With the scaphoid as the center of the arc and the long axis of the distal radius as the reference 0 degrees line, sequential coronal scans of the wrist were done in 10 degrees increments in an arc of 40 degrees to give 0 degrees, 10 degrees, 20 degrees, 30 degrees and 40 degrees scans. The 0 degrees and 10 degrees arc scans were best for evaluating the distal radius and ulna and soft tissues, the 10 degrees and 20 degrees scans for the carpal bones other than the scaphoid, and their relation to each other, the 30 degrees and 40 degrees scans, parallel to the long axis of the scaphoid, for fractures of the scaphoid and the hook of the hamate. In addition the 40 degrees scan offered an excellent carpal tunnel view. In 22 patients examined for wrist trauma CT was found to be more accurate than plain films and plain-film tomography in determining the presence of a fracture (4 scaphoid and 1 distal radius), in assessing the degree of osseous union (12) and in evaluating intercarpal fusion (2). In addition CT detected avascular necrosis of the lunate in two patients and erosions of the scaphoid and distal radius attributed to rheumatoid arthritis in one."
CD010023,0,19235672,0,Ultrasonographic study of wrist ligaments: review and new perspectives.,"Imaging strategy for wrist injury usually begins with standard radiographs. When a ligamentous disorder is suspected clinically, the next step is arthrographic computed tomography or arthrographic magnetic resonance imaging. When the diagnosis remains unclear, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the preferred examination. Ultrasonography is usually used to assess structures like tendons and bone surface, but thanks to the performances of high-frequency transducers, it can also enable visualization of the main ligaments of the wrist. Ultrasonography could thus replace MRI because of its lower cost, as recently reported in the literature. However, a good knowledge of normal and pathological wrist anatomy is required to avoid false negatives. Wrist ligaments comprise interosseous and capsular ligaments as well as the triangular fibrocartilaginous complex. All these ligaments may be involved in carpal instability. Clinical examination has a major role to play in helping radiologists orient their procedures. A few studies have reported that ultrasonography of the triangular fibrocartilaginous complex is reliable compared with arthrography or MRI, but most of these studies were limited to the radioulnar ligaments. In this article we propose a more extensive protocol."
CD010023,0,19887294,0,MR imaging of traumatic and overuse injuries of the wrist and hand in athletes.,"Traumatic and overuse injuries of the hand and wrist are common in athletes. Increasingly, MR imaging is being used to complement clinical and radiographic assessment in the diagnosis and management of these injuries. MR imaging is able to image accurately the bones, tendons, ligaments, nerves, and other small structures of the hand and wrist. This article provides an overview of traumatic and overuse injuries of the hand and wrist in athletes and a review of the MR imaging appearances."
CD010023,0,8173057,0,[The monitor findings of digitalized conventional wrist x-rays].,"The study aimed at proving the reliability of monitor systems with the matrix of 1024 x 768 for the detection of scaphoid fractures compared to conventional X-ray. Moreover, we were interested in the significance of procedures of digital imaging post processing, depending in particular on the experience of investigators. 5 investigators with different levels of experience analysed 57 X-rays of the wrist. They compared conventional X-rays with images on a high screen monitor system after the digitalisation of these X-rays by a CCD-scanner and analysed untreated and treated images. A 5-point scale ROC analysis was used for evaluation. The analysis covered a total of 1740 evaluations. The untreated images seen on the monitor system proved slightly better than conventional X-rays. Post-processing has no evident advantage over untreated images. Differing levels of experience had no effect whatsoever on the identification of findings."

Although the aetiology was obscure, the acute onset suggested a mechanical cause rather than a nerve compression disorder such as anterior interosseous nerve palsy. X-rays showed an ununited scaphoid fracture related to an injury many years previously. Surgical exploration revealed attritional rupture of flexor pollicis longus and partial division of profundus tendon to index finger by a spicule of ununited scaphoid which had eroded through the volar capsule. Removal of the spicule and tenodesis of flexor pollicis longus gave a good long term result."

CD010023,0,10664998,0,A one-hour walk-in service for wrist trauma imaging.,"We investigated the feasibility of rapid imaging of wrist trauma following casualty presentation and any subsequent effect on image quality and interpretability. All patients referred for wrist imaging were injected with 370 MBq 99Tcm-hydroxymethyl diphosphonate (HDP) and imaged 1, 2 and 3 h later. Palmar images were acquired on a 256 x 256 x 16 matrix using a high-resolution collimator, 140 keV photopeak and a 20% window. The images were scored qualitatively by four qualified observers in three categories: image quality, lesion detection and lesion localization. Statistical analysis indicated a significant improvement in scan quality with time, the mean difference (+/- standard error of the mean) between the 1 and 3 h scans being 0.81 +/- 0.07 (P = 0.001). No significant differences were seen in lesion detection (0.05 +/- 0.08; P = 0.51) or localization (0.14 +/- 0.08; P = 0.10). We conclude that imaging of wrist trauma is possible as early as 1 h post-injection of 99Tcm-HDP, although negative studies at 1 h require a 3 h image to maintain diagnostic accuracy."
CD010023,0,11162008,0,MRI versus arthroscopy in the diagnosis of scapholunate ligament injury.,"In a prospective study 103 patients with clinically or radiologically suspected tears of the scapholunate interosseous ligament were investigated with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and wrist arthroscopy. MRI was performed with the conventional technique in 72 cases and after intravenous injection of contrast medium in the remaining 31 patients. The correct diagnosis was made by MRI in 75% of cases and its overall sensitivity and specificity were 63% and 86% respectively. There was no statistical difference in the accuracy of MRI for acute or chronic tears and the use of intravenous contrast medium did not improve its accuracy. In conclusion, MRI is not recommended for the diagnosis of scapholunate ligament injury."

Radiologically, erosions were noted in the proximal pole of the scaphoid. The patient underwent wrist arthrotomy, exploration and washout with intraoperative bacterial cultures and histology specimens were obtained. Histological analysis revealed the diagnosis of gout. We discuss the clinical presentation and literature review of this topic. This case illustrates that gout may mimic infection."
CD010023,0,9509596,0,Gadolinium-enhanced dynamic MRI of the fractured carpal scaphoid: preliminary results.,"The aim of the present report was to evaluate the vascularity of fracture fragments of the fractured carpal scaphoid in the acute (< 4 weeks) and chronic (> 3 months) phases using a gadolinium-enhanced dynamic MRI sequence. Eight patients with acute scaphoid fractures, six patients with chronic scaphoid fractures, and three control patients without fractures were evaluated using a T1-weighted fast spoiled gradient recalled acquisition (fSPGR) sequence with gadolinium-DTPA enhancement (0.1 mmol/kg bodyweight). Signal intensity over time plots were obtained using region of interest measurements from both fracture fragments. Enhancement factors (EF) were then calculated from the plots. No enhancement of the scaphoid was seen in control subjects (EF: distal scaphoid pole 1.04 +/- 0.01, proximal pole 1.07 +/- 0.08). In acute fracture patients, enhancement of the distal pole was greater than that of the proximal in all cases but one in which the two poles enhanced in a similar fashion (EF: distal 1.99 +/- 0.77, proximal 1.43 +/- 0.99). In chronic fracture patients the enhancement pattern was reversed, as the proximal pole enhanced to a greater degree than the distal with the exception of one case where both poles enhanced equally (EF: distal 1.74 +/- 0.52, proximal 2.64 +/- 0.50). Using a two-tailed non-parametric Mann-Whitney U-test, the difference in enhancement of the proximal poles between the acute and chronic groups was found to be highly significant (P < 0.003). Dynamic contrast-enhanced (fSPGR) MRI demonstrates significant differences in the enhancement patterns of the scaphoid when chronic and acute fractures are compared."

Acute-phase multidetector computed tomography has better temporal, spatial, and contrast resolution than a conventional scanner has. The aim of this study was to determine prospectively whether the addition of a multidetector computed tomography scan (with various reconstructions) results in changes in the evaluation of intra-articular distal radial fractures and thus changes in the plans for further management."
CD010023,0,15864044,0,Does three-dimensional computer simulation improve results of scaphoid nonunion surgery?,"The purpose of this study was to clarify the effectiveness of the three-dimensional computer simulations in scaphoid nonunion surgery. Seven consecutive clinical patients with scaphoid nonunion at the middle third comprised the study group. Surface models of the scaphoid were constructed on the computer using computed tomography data of the bilateral wrists in neutral position. The distal and proximal fragments of the nonunion model were matched to the mirror image of the contralateral scaphoid model. The rotation of the distal fragment relative to the proximal fragment was calculated, and reduction of the displaced fragment of the scaphoid nonunion was simulated. Similarly, the estimated bone defect and the appropriate site and direction of the screw insertion were simulated. Full-sized hard models of the bone, including a model with simulated reduction and screw insertion, then were made using stereolithography based on the computer data. In the actual surgery, reduction, bone grafting, and screw insertion were achieved using the hard models as guides. All the patients obtained solid bone fusion and substantial clinical improvement with normalized scapholunate and radiolunate angles after surgery. Three-dimensional computer simulations were found as useful for accurate correction of scaphoid nonunions and proper screw placement, which consequently leads to good clinical results."
CD010023,0,21289857,0,Pseudarthrosis after disruption of an incomplete luno-triquetral coalition: a case report.,"Whilst bony luno-triquetral coalitions are known to be asymptomatic, fibro-cartilage unions can cause ulnar-sided wrist pain. The purpose is to present the rare case of painful pseudarthrosis after traumatic disruption of an incomplete luno-triquetral coalition. Recommendations for proper diagnosis and treatment options will be discussed. The case of a 35-year-old male patient is reported, where disruption of a fibro-cartilaginous luno-triquetral coalition resulted in a painful pseudarthrosis. Luno-triquetral fusion with a corticocancellous wedge from the iliac crest and a Herbert screw was undertaken. Using this method pain was relieved but resulted in minor loss of range of motion. We recommend luno-triquetral fusion in the rare case of fracture or pseudarthrosis of a luno-triquetral coalition. The use of a corticocancellous wedge should be considered depending on gap formation after resection of the pseudarthrosis."
CD010023,0,9661853,0,Carpal fractures in children.,"Carpal fractures in children are uncommon injuries, with the scaphoid being fractured most frequently. Thirty-three children with scaphoid fractures and one child each with fractures of triquetrum, trapezoid, hamate, and capitate were retrospectively reviewed. The mean age was 13 years, 4 months. The mechanism of injury was of low energy in most cases, with > 80% of injuries involving a fall. Localizing tenderness was present in 100% of cases. Of fractures, 97.3% were evident on the initial radiographs. One patient required a bone scan to confirm the diagnosis. All but one scaphoid fracture went on to union with conservative treatment in a long-arm thumb spica cast or short-arm thumb spica cast at a mean of 7.1 weeks. All other carpal fractures healed at a mean of 4.5 weeks. The one scaphoid nonunion was attributed to noncompliance by the patient."
CD010023,0,11974963,1,[Occult fractures of the carpal navicular. Detection by quantitative radioscintigraphy. Social and medico-legal repercussions].,"Fractures of the scaphoid of the wrist are not easily diagnosed and when they are eventually recognized due to late complications, the prognosis is much poorer than it would have been at injury. Medical negligence and poorly-performed or interpreted x-rays are frequently cited as reasons for non-diagnosis. Often these fractures are trabecular, so-called occult, and they cannot be seen on a conventional exam, even if well-performed. Tomography and tomodensitometry have yielded poor results. Quantitative radioscintigraphy (QRS), the exam we are proposing, is a modification of scintigraphy, which is a very sensitive exam (100%) but has little specificity. The first step in QRS is to quantify the fixation of the tracer on the injured side and compare it to that of the uninjured side. If the injured side fixation is double that of the uninjured side, a fracture (often scaphoid) is present. MRI is our reference. In the second step in QRS, a computer-assisted fusion is made of the scintigraphic image and the x-ray (quantitative scintigraphy has the same diagnostic value as MRI). The center of the fracture is localized, thus yielding a specificity of nearly 100% for this exam. Out of a prospective series of 154 patients who had a conventional examination: 41% were diagnosed to have a scaphoid fracture using QSR, therefore a number higher than supposed. Rare carpal fractures were also detected. The cost of this exam is low. The exam climinates non-diagnosed fractures which can lead to non-union and arthrosis. Due to the frequency of carpal trauma, this exam should have a significant effect on the individual, on social security costs and litigations."
CD010023,0,1572718,0,Diagnosing scaphoid fractures: radiographs cannot be used as a gold standard!,"To evaluate the reproducibility of the interpretation of radiographs for the diagnosis of scaphoid fractures, 134 radiographs (60 consecutive patients) were blindly observed by a resident radiologist, consultant radiologist, resident trauma surgeon and consultant trauma surgeon. The results of radiographs were analysed using kappa (kappa) statistics and stratified according to the results of the corresponding bone scan. In 23 patients the bone scan was positive for fracture of the scaphoid. Irrespective of training and experience, the kappa of the comparison of the scores of the radiographs between any two observers did not exceed 40 per cent. After stratification of the outcome of the bone scan, the kappa did not increase significantly. A panel of three experienced observers gave their opinion of all radiographs. The results were compared with the bone scan results. We conclude that radiographs in suspected scaphoid fracture cannot be used as a reliable diagnostic approach because of the low inter-observer agreement in the interpretation, irrespective of the experience and training of the observer."

CD010023,0,11036545,0,[Late sequelae of fractures of the distal third of the forearm during the growth period].,"Fractures to the distal third of the forearm are the most common fractures of the upper extremity, with the majority occurring between the age of ten and 14 years. With the exception of the rare epiphyseal fractures, they have a favourable prognosis. The present study investigates the frequency and extent of potential clinical and radiological late sequelae of fractures in the distal third of the forearm during growth. Of the patients treated at the Innsbruck University Department of Traumatology from 1980 to 1992, 220 patients of a growing age with 232 closed fractures in the distal third of the forearm were followed up. The radius alone was affected in 60% of these cases; the radius and the ulna in 40%. Fractures of the ulna alone were not present. The mean age of the patients at the time of injury was nine years (range one to 16 years) and the mean time of follow-up ten years (range five to 16 years). In addition to the patient's subjective assessment, the right and left sides were compared with regard to mobility of the wrist and rotational movement of the forearm. Based on standard X-rays, the frontal (radio-ulnar) and lateral (dorso-palmar) radial joint angle as well as the difference in the radio-ulnar plane were compared with the contralateral side. Clinical and radiological findings were summarised into an overall result. 19% of the patients reported pain in the injured wrist. Mobility of the wrist in the sagittal and/or frontal plane was limited in 5% of patients and rotation of the forearm was limited in 16% of patients. A statistically significant accumulation of limited rotation was seen after physeal fractures of the ulna (""one-way"" ANOVA-test, p = 0.0033). A difference between the left and right side in regard to the frontal radial joint angle was seen in 6% of patients and a difference in the lateral radial joint angle was registered in 2% of patients. A difference in the radio-ulnar plane was observed in 37% of patients. In the presence of relative ulna-plus variance, 75% of patients complained of pain in the ulnocarpal compartment of the wrist. In these patients, dynamic magnetic resonance tomography revealed a compression of the ulnocarpal disk between the proximal carpal bones and the head of the ulna, as well as degeneration in the central portion of the disk. The overall outcome was very good in 72%, good in 19%, moderate in 6% and poor in 3% of patients. The younger the children had been at the time of injury, the more favourable were the results (chi-square test, p = 0.009). Children older than ten years of age with an angulatory deformity of more than 20 degrees and/or fragment dislocation over half of the breadth of the shaft at fracture consolidation showed the poorest results. Further factors having a negative influence on the outcome were repeated reduction manoeuvres and an additional fracture of the ulna."

CD010023,0,2777848,0,Fracture of the hook of the hamate.,"We removed the fracture fragment from fifty-nine patients who had an isolated fracture of the hook of the hamate. Preoperatively, all had complained of pain and tenderness on the ulnar side of the palm or on the dorsal ulnar aspect of the wrist. Most fractures were thought to have occurred while the patient was swinging a racquet, golf club, or baseball bat. Some fractures were caused by striking the palm on a solid object, by falling on the palm, or by a crush injury to the hand. Most of the fractures were diagnosed conclusively on a carpal tunnel roentgenogram or on a special oblique roentgenogram of the wrist supinated. We now believe that computed axial tomography is the best imaging technique for demonstrating this fracture. Except for two patients who had a crush injury, all of the patients returned to their regular occupational and athletic pursuits. There were no surgical complications."
CD010023,0,12730737,0,Predicting the failure load of the distal radius.,"The distal radius is an important site for the early detection of patients at risk for fracture. Since measuring bone strength in vivo is not possible, we evaluated which bone assessment method of the forearm would best predict failure load of the distal radius and computed a factor of risk for wrist fracture (Phi wrist). Thirty-eight cadaveric forearm specimens were measured by five different techniques to assess bone density, bone mineral content, geometry and trabecular structure at the distal forearm. The bone assessment techniques included dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) of the radius, peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) of the 4% and 20% distal sites of the radius, DXA of the phalanges, digital X-ray radiogrammetry of the forearm (DXR-BMD), and quantitative ultrasound of the radius. The failure load of each excised radius was determined by simulating a fall on an outstretched hand. The pQCT measurements of polar stress-strain index and cortical content explained the greatest portion of variance in failure load (r2=0.82-0.85). Bone mineral content measures were generally better predictors of failure load (r2=0.53-0.85) than the corresponding volumetric or areal bone mineral density values (r2=0.22-0.69) measured by either pQCT or DXA. Multiple regression analysis showed that the addition of a bone geometry measure improved the ability of a bone density measure alone to predict failure load. There was high variability in the ability of different techniques and different variables within a given technique to predict failure load. Estimates of the factor of risk for wrist fracture (Phi wrist) revealed that the women in this study would have been likely to fracture their distal radius upon falling from a standing height (Phi wrist= 1.04), whereas the men would have likely withstood the impact without fracturing their wrist (Phi wrist= 0.79)."

In seven patients, M.R.I. confirmed scintigraphic and radiographic signs of ischaemic necrosis. In two patients with radionuclide accumulations, M.R.I. did not confirm the diagnosis: in one, M.R.I. was totally normal and in the other it showed signs of a healing scaphoid fracture. From this limited experience, M.R.I. seems to be a sensitive imaging modality which is more specific than scintigraphy."

CD010023,0,9556260,0,Is intrasound vibration useful in the diagnosis of occult scaphoid fractures?,"This study was designed to confirm the results of Finkenberg et al. (J Hand Surg 1993;18A: 4-7), who found a high sensitivity (100%) and specificity (95%) of the intrasound vibration method in diagnosing occult scaphoid fractures. These occult scaphoid fractures are not visible on x-ray films, but clinically the patients are suspected of having a scaphoid fracture. A vibratory apparatus is placed over the anatomical snuff-box and a vibration of 100 mW is emitted; a painful sensation is produced if the scaphoid is fractured. Thirty-seven consecutive patients with a clinically suspected scaphoid fracture were evaluated. In 6 patients, a scaphoid fracture was radiographically identified; in the remaining 31 patients, a 3-phase bone scan was obtained. Eleven wrists showed increased uptake over the scaphoid and were considered to have an occult scaphoid fracture. In this group, bone scintigraphy was used as the reference standard. The vibration test was painful in 1 of 6 patients with a proven scaphoid fracture and in 3 of the 11 patients with a positive bone scan. In contrast to the results of Finkenberg et al, the intrasound vibration method shows a sensitivity of 24%, a specificity of 85%, a positive predictive value of 40%, and a negative predictive value of 65%. We conclude that the accuracy of intrasound vibration is low and that it is not useful in the diagnosis of scaphoid fractures."

CD010023,0,11521919,0,Scaphoid blood flow and acute fracture healing. A dynamic MRI study with enhancement with gadolinium.,"We have investigated whether assessment of blood flow to the proximal scaphoid can be used to predict nonunion in acute fractures of the scaphoid. We studied 32 fractures of the scaphoid one to two weeks after injury, by dynamic fat-suppressed T1-weighted gradient-echo MRI after the intravenous administration of gadopentetate dimeglumine (0.1 mmol/kg body-weight). Steepest slope values (SSV) and percentage enhancement values (%E) were calculated for the distal and proximal fragments and poles. All the fractures were treated by immobilisation in a cast, and union was assessed by CT at 12 weeks. Nonunion occurred in four fractures (12%), and there was no statistically significant difference between the proximal fragment SSV and %E values for the fractures which united and those with nonunion. The difference between the proximal pole SSV and %E values for the union and nonunion groups reached statistical significance (p < 0.05), but with higher enhancement parameters for the nonunion group. Our results suggest that poor proximal vascularity is not an important determinant of union in fractures of the scaphoid."
CD010023,0,19790024,0,[Palmar wrist arthroscopy for evaluation of concomitant carpal lesions in operative treatment of distal intraarticular radius fractures].,"Fractures of the distal radius, which currently are treated with palmar locking plates, are often accompanied by carpal lesions. Tears of the scapholunate interosseus ligament (SL) can affect the outcome. Between January 2007 and May 2008, 28 patients with distal intraarticular fractures of the radius were included in a prospective study. Preoperative CT-arthrography was performed. SL tears were found in 11 patients, with 10 partial and one complete rupture observed. A tear of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) was detected in 16 patients. Every patient was operated with a palmar locking plate through a palmar approach between the flexor carpi radialis tendon and the radial artery. Then, a palmar wrist arthroscopy using a palmar portal was performed. Eleven SL tears with 9 partial and two total ruptures were diagnosed by arthroscopy. Ten lesions were associated with a C1-fracture with a fracture line projected onto the scapholunate interval. The TFCC was appraisable by palmar wrist arthroscopy only in 4 patients. Three of the SL tears detected by CT-arthrography could not be confirmed by palmar wrist arthroscopy. One complete rupture and one partial lesion confirmed by palmar wrist arthroscopy were found by CT-arthrography to be intact. Palmar wrist arthroscopy affords certainty when assessing the SL ligament. In this study, an assessment of ulnocarpal structures was not possible. For assessment of the ulnocarpal structures, CT-arthrography was superior to palmar wrist arthroscopy. However, the latter is an alternative during emergency treatment or when CT-arthrography is not available."

CD010023,0,20299263,0,Arthroscopic treatment of a fresh lunate bone fracture detaching the scapholunate ligament.,"Fractures of the lunate bone are rare and usually treated by prolonged immobilization. We report a fracture of the dorsal pole of the lunate bone detaching the scapholunate ligament. The clinical presentation was equivalent to an acute disruption of this ligament. Percutaneous screw repair of the bone fragment was performed under wrist arthroscopy. The patient kept an analgesic splint for five days and early mobilization was provided. After 6 weeks, the patient had returned to his previous level of activity with normal wrist motion and full strength. Screw fixation under arthroscopy is minimally invasive and provides accurate restoration of the lunar anatomy, yielding good functional results after a short recovery period. This treatment offers a satisfactory alternative to prolonged immobilization and ensures good reduction and compression of the fracture. We present a detailed description of the surgical technique and its results."

CD010023,0,12111052,0,Traumatic injuries: imaging of peripheral musculoskeletal injuries.,"The current dominant role of conventional radiography must be reassessed at increasingly shorter intervals in view of the continuing emergence of new imaging modalities that are available to diagnose peripheral musculoskeletal injuries. In comparison with conventional radiography, digital radiographic techniques offer advantages for optimization of image quality and dose, such as a wider dynamic range and post-processing of images. Currently, digital luminescence radiography (storage phosphor radiography) is the most commonly used digital method for obtaining radiographs, using the established positioning projections and routines of the film-screen technique. A new process, radiography with flat-panel amorphous silicon detectors, is still under development. Computed tomography is a valuable tool for diagnosing injuries of the peripheral musculoskeletal system, especially when three-dimensional data sets are acquired; these allow reformating images in all planes desired (2D technique) or in a volumetric format (3D technique). Established indications for CT in the peripheral skeleton are hip fractures, wrist injuries and calcaneal fractures; however, CT may be used as a supplement to radiography in every region of the body. Sonography is beginning to play an increasingly important role in trauma. Muscle and tendon injuries are the most common indications, but worthwhile information can be gained of the shoulder, elbow, hip, and knee joints, supplementing conventional or digital radiography. Magnetic resonance imaging effectively visualizes traumatic changes of the skeleton and the peripheral soft tissues. It is the method of choice to detect occult fractures. It can be used to diagnose muscle and tendon injuries. Joint injuries, especially in the knee and the shoulder joint, are common indications for MRI in the posttraumatic setting."
CD010023,0,9314391,0,Displaced intra-articular fractures of the distal aspect of the radius. Long-term results in young adults after open reduction and internal fixation.,"The purpose of this retrospective study was to determine the long-term functional and radiographic outcomes in a series of young adults (less than forty-five years old) in whom an acute displaced intra-articular fracture of the distal aspect of the radius had been treated with operative reduction and stabilization. Twenty-six fractures in twenty-six patients met the initial inclusion criteria for the study. Twenty-one patients returned for a physical examination, imaging (plain radiographs and computerized tomography scans), and completion of a validated musculoskeletal function assessment questionnaire at a minimum of 5.5 years. The physical examinations were performed by the same observer, who was not involved in the initial care of the patients. The plain radiographs and computerized tomography scans were assessed in a blinded fashion by two independent observers who measured the radiographic parameters with standardized methods. At an average of 7.1 years, osteoarthrosis of the radiocarpal joint was evident on the plain radiographs and computerized tomography scans of sixteen (76 per cent) of the twenty-one wrists. A strong association was found between the development of osteoarthrosis of the radiocarpal joint and residual displacement of articular fragments at the time of osseous union (p < 0.01). However, the functional status at the time of the most recent follow-up, as determined by physical examination and on the basis of the responses on the questionnaire, did not correlate with the magnitude of the residual step and gap displacement at the time of fracture-healing. All patients had a good or excellent functional outcome irrespective of radiographic evidence of osteoarthrosis of the radiocarpal or the distal radio-ulnar joint or non-union of the ulnar styloid process. It appears prudent therefore to base the indications for salvage operative procedures on the presence of severe symptoms or a loss of function rather than on radiographic evidence of osteoarthrosis of the radiocarpal joint."

CD010023,0,9607660,0,Proximal scaphoid costo-osteochondral replacement arthroplasty.,"Deficiency of the proximal pole of the scaphoid due to fracture or necrosis was treated by costo-osteochondral replacement arthroplasty using rib bone/cartilage autografts in 22 patients who were followed prospectively and assessed at a median 24 month follow-up (range, 12-72 months). Improvement of wrist function occurred in all patients with increased motion, improved grip strength and less pain. The average modified Green and O'Brien Wrist Function Score improved from 53 out of 100 preoperatively to 80 at the most recent review. All patients were graded fair or poor at initial review and all but three improved to good or excellent at the most recent assessment. Despite the absence of the scapholunate ligament, carpal alignment did not deteriorate in any patient and there were no graft non-unions or significant complications. In the short and medium term a costo-osteochondral autograft can satisfactorily restore mechanical integrity of the scaphoid proximal pole and maintain wrist motion while avoiding the potential complications of alternative replacement arthroplasty techniques."

CD010023,0,12074611,0,Management of acute fractures and nonunions of the proximal pole of the scaphoid.,"It is my belief that all acute proximal pole fractures should be treated by open reduction and internal fixation, via a dorsal approach. There is no longer any place for conservative treatment of these fractures, because a lengthy period of plaster immobilization is required and there is an unacceptably high risk of nonunion with conservative management. Unfortunately, nonunion of the proximal pole remains a common and disabling problem which demands careful evaluation and treatment. Internal fixation combined with limited cancellous bone grafting produces very satisfactory results in terms of pain relief and function, and clinical results are as good as those reported for more complex procedures involving vascularized grafts and prolonged cast immobilization. While the place for vascularized grafting has yet to be clearly defined, at present it is a technique which should be reserved for cases with long-standing ischaemia or failed previous surgery."

A multicenter, prospective, double blind, placebo controlled, randomized trial.","The scaphoid bone is the most commonly fractured of the carpal bones. In the Netherlands 90% of all carpal fractures is a fracture of the scaphoid bone. The scaphoid has an essential role in functionality of the wrist, acting as a pivot. Complications in healing can result in poor functional outcome. The scaphoid fracture is a troublesome fracture and failure of treatment can result in avascular necrosis (up to 40%), non-union (5-21%) and early osteo-arthritis (up to 32%) which may seriously impair wrist function. Impaired consolidation of scaphoid fractures results in longer immobilization and more days lost at work with significant psychosocial and financial consequences.Initially Pulsed Electromagnetic Fields was used in the treatment of tibial pseudoarthrosis and non-union. More recently there is evidence that physical forces can also be used in the treatment of fresh fractures, showing accelerated healing by 30% and 71% reduction in nonunion within 12 weeks after initiation of therapy.

CD010023,0,1400550,0,Long-term results after Russe bone-grafting: the effect of malunion of the scaphoid.,"Twenty-five patients had Russe anterior corticocancellous bone-grafting between 1973 and 1984 for twenty-six symptomatic established non-unions of the scaphoid. The mean duration of follow-up was eleven years (range, seven to eighteen years). Twenty-one (81 per cent) of the twenty-six scaphoid bones united. We developed two rating scales to evaluate the results of the operation. One scale, based on objective findings, included the radiographic appearance of the wrist, the range of motion, and strength; the other scale, based on subjective findings, comprised function, pain, perception of a decrease in performance because of limitation of motion or strength, and satisfaction. These scales were used to compare the objective and subjective results in patients who had a malunion of the scaphoid in which the lateral intrascaphoid angle was more than 45 degrees convex dorsally between the proximal and distal poles (a so-called flexion or humpback deformity, which results in extension of the proximal fragment of the scaphoid at the radiocarpal joint) with the results in patients who had no such deformity. The lateral intrascaphoid angle was more than 45 degrees in thirteen (50 per cent) of the twenty-six wrists. Although the difference in the objective results between the wrists that had a malunion and those that did not have a malunion was highly significant (p = 0.001), there was no significant difference in the subjective results between the two groups, including satisfaction of the patient (p = 0.39). Twenty-three patients (92 per cent) returned to full-time employment and twenty-two (88 per cent), to sports activities. Twenty-three patients (92 per cent) reported that they had pronounced relief of pain and that the procedure had improved their quality of life. The presence of this deformity of the scaphoid after bone-grafting for a symptomatic non-union was not predictive of a poor long-term subjective outcome."
CD010023,0,12782882,0,The effect of pronation and supination on the minimally displaced scaphoid fracture.,"The amount of rotation that occurs at the scaphoid waist fracture site with pronation and supination of the forearm is studied in 10 upper extremities from cadavers. Two colinear metal markers were placed in the osteotomized scaphoid and a below-the-elbow cast was applied. Spiral volumetric computed tomography scanning of the scaphoid was done with multiplanar reformation to evaluate displacement of the metal markers. Four of the 10 specimens also were studied without any immobilization. The total magnitude of motion from pronation to supination averaged 0.2 mm in the specimens with a below-the-elbow thumb spica cast, and 2.4 mm in specimens without immobilization. The current study showed no significant rotation at the minimally displaced scaphoid waist fracture site during pronation and supination in a below-the-elbow cast. Furthermore, there is unacceptable rotation at the fracture site in the absence of a cast. Based on this study, a below-the-elbow thumb spica cast seems adequate for fracture immobilization; however, clinical correlation is needed."
CD010023,0,9665518,0,Combining the clinical signs improves diagnosis of scaphoid fractures. A prospective study with follow-up.,"This is a prospective study evaluating the efficacy of four clinical signs believed to be useful in the diagnosis of scaphoid fracture. Two hundred and fifteen consecutive patients with suspected scaphoid fracture were examined on two separate occasions to evaluate tenderness in the anatomical snuff box (ASB), tenderness over the scaphoid tubercle (ST), pain on longitudinal compression of the thumb (LC) and the range of thumb movement (TM). At the initial examination ASB, ST and LC were all 100% sensitive for detecting scaphoid fracture with specificities of 9%, 30% and 48% respectively. These clinical signs used in combination, within the first 24 hours following injury, produced 100% sensitivity and an improvement in the specificity to 74%. TM had 69% sensitivity and 66% specificity. Our results suggest that these clinical signs are inadequate indicators of scaphoid fracture when used alone and should be combined to achieve a more accurate clinical diagnosis."

CD010023,0,532594,0,Scanning and radiology of the carpal scaphoid bone.,"The value of isotope scanning in patients with suspected fracture of the scaphoid bone of the wrist was examined. For this purpose comparable examinations were made of 50 patients using both radiography and isotope scanning. With a normal scan, the suspicion of fracture or other bone diseases can be excluded. Increased focal activity corresponding to the region of the scaphoid bone indicates the possibility of a fracture, even if a fracture cannot be seen in the initial X-rays."

The authors prospectively followed up, by serial radiography and bone scanning, 23 patients who had a history of trauma to the carpus and associated localized tenderness to the anatomic ""snuff box"": in 15 patients the radiographs and bone scans were negative; in 5 the radiograph was equivocal and the bone scan positive. The authors concluded that patients with clinically suspected scaphoid fractures and negative radiographs can be treated symptomatically without immobilization in a cast. Patients with equivocal radiographs should be assumed to have a fractured scaphoid and treated accordingly."

A chest radiograph revealed a metallic foreign body over the cardiac silhouette; a chest CT scan localized the object to within the wall of the right ventricle. The patient subsequently developed pericardial tamponade necessitating pericardiocentesis. A 25-mm-long Kirschner wire protruding through the wall of the right ventricle was removed via thoracotomy. Forty-two months previously, the patient had undergone open reduction and fixation of a left radius fracture with two Kirschner wires. Clinicians caring for patients with orthopedic wires in place should be aware of wire migration with cardiac embolization as a potential complication."
CD010023,0,2712988,0,Scaphoid tubercle tenderness: a better indicator of scaphoid fractures?,"Tenderness in the anatomical snuff box (ASB) has long been accepted as an indicator of a possible scaphoid fracture. The longitudinal axis of the scaphoid lies in an anteroposterior plane, perpendicular to the remainder of the carpal bones, in the radially deviated wrist. The scaphoid tubercle can therefore be easily and accurately palpated on the palmar aspect of the radially deviated wrist. This study was devised to determine if tenderness over the scaphoid tubercle (ST) was superior to ASB tenderness in identifying definite fractures. Over a 10-month period 246 patients were seen who were suspected of having a scaphoid injury. Thirty (12%) were eventually proven to have definite fracture. Tenderness in the ASB had a sensitivity rate of 90% (95% confidence limits 80-100%) and specificity of 40% (33-47%) as an indicator of a definite fracture. ST tenderness had a sensitivity of 87% (75-99%) and specificity of 57% (50-64%). There is therefore no significant difference in the sensitivity between ASB and ST tenderness but ST tenderness is significantly more specific. However, the presence of either ASB or ST tenderness should be used in order to identify all fractures. Patients with neither ASB nor ST tenderness require symptomatic treatment only."
CD010023,0,8451048,0,[The painful ulno-carpal joint. Diagnosis and therapy].,"The ulnocarpal joint plays a critical role in hand and wrist function. It serves as part of forearm rotation as well as part of the carpal kinematics. The joint is comprised of the distal radio-ulnar articulation, triangular fibrocartilage complex, lunate, triquetrum, hamate, and pisiform, and the intra and extracapsular ligamentous and soft tissue constraints. Traumatic disruptions as well as chronic inflammatory conditions are commonplace. In addition to standard radiographs, arthrography, CT scanning, and MRI studies prove useful. Wrist arthroscopy is becoming of increasing importance in this region of the wrist. Ulnar impaction syndrome may occur associated with malunion of distal radius fracture, ulna positive variance, or chronic TFCC tears. Osteotomy of the distal radius or ulnar shortening osteotomy should be considered. Instability of the distal ulna can be treated with tenodesis procedures, hemi-resection arthroplasty, matched ulna resection or the Sauvé-Kapandji procedure."

The extent of displacement of the fracture which was not evident on plain radiographs was revealed by CT. The fracture was reduced and internally fixed using a standard technique applicable to the fixation of fractures of the radial head. Full movement was restored. An isolated injury to the distal ulna is rare and requires careful clinical and radiological assessment."
CD010023,0,11305572,0,The role of MRI in the assessment of scaphoid fracture healing: a pilot study.,"Twenty-two patients with fracture of the scaphoid treated by cast immobilisation underwent clinical examination, radiography and MR scanning 6 weeks after injury. On clinical and plain radiographic criteria alone, 12 patients were considered sufficiently healed to warrant mobilisation. The remaining 10 patients were considered unhealed and were immobilised for a further period. A musculoskeletal radiologist, blinded to the clinical diagnosis, reviewed the MRI scans. Of the 10 patients considered unhealed, 5 had the MR appearances of a united fracture, based on normal marrow signal across the fracture line on T1-weighted images. Of the 12 patients deemed to have united, union could be confirmed by MRI criteria in only 5, but all 12 were healed at 1 year. The results suggest that MRI can provide additional information in this group of patients. It can confirm bony union in a high proportion of patients deemed clinically non-united. Its use in this context will allow a more rapid mobilisation and return to normal function. The significance of persistent MR signal abnormalities in patients who have clinical and radiographic signs of healing merits further study."
CD010023,0,10955218,0,Acute injuries of the distal radioulnar joint.,"Distal radioulnar joint injuries can occur in isolation or in association with distal radius fractures, Galeazzi fractures, Essex-Lopresti injuries, and both-bone forearm fractures. The authors have classified DRUJ/TFCC injuries into stable, partially unstable (subluxation), and unstable (dislocation) patterns based on the injured structures and clinical findings. Clinical findings and plain radiographs are usually sufficient to diagnose the lesion, but axial CT scans are pathognomonic. Diagnostic arthroscopy is the next test of choice to visualize stable and partially unstable lesions. Stable injuries of the DRUJ/TFCC unresponsive to conservative measures require arthroscopic debridement of the TFCC tear, along with ulnar shortening if there is ulnar-positive variance. Partially unstable injuries, on the other hand, are treated with direct arthroscopic or open repair of the TFCC tear, once again, along with ulnar shortening if ulnar-positive variance is present. Unstable injuries include simple and complex DRUJ dislocations. A simple DRUJ dislocation is easily reducible but may be stable or unstable. In complex dislocation, reduction is not possible because there is soft tissue interposition or a significant tear. After the associated injury is dealt with, treatment for complex injuries requires exploration of the DRUJ, extraction of the interposed tissue, repair of the soft tissues, and open reduction and internal fixation of the ulnar styloid fracture (if present and displaced). The early recognition and appropriate treatment of an acute DRUJ injury are critical to avoid progression to a chronic DRUJ disorder, the treatment of which is much more difficult and much less satisfying."
CD010023,0,10804418,0,[Interscapholunate carpal axial dislocation: a case report].,"We present a case of a patient presenting a right wrist injury due to a motor vehicule accident. X-rays and CT Scan showed transcapholunate axial dislocation with the capitate impacted between the scaphoid and the lunate without perilunate dislocation. This injury was associated to a fracture of radial styloid process, trapezium, triquetrum, hamate, and a pisotriquetral and intermetacarpal dissociation. We did not find any similar case in French or English litterature. Treatment associated closed reduction and percutaneous pinning. At one year follow-up the wrist was painless with a normal range of motion. This lesion contributes to the understanding of carpal injuries mechanism. Capitate ascension within the scapholunar joint due to an important compression force is a pathogenic factor of scapholunate dissociation."

We have developed a new technique of positioning patients while performing longitudinal computed tomography of the scaphoid. With the wrist positioned in radial deviation and neutral flexion, greater patient comfort is provided and immobilization of the wrist is not required. A reproducible image can be obtained with attention to the alignment of the scanning plane to the longitudinal axis of the scaphoid on the scout image, and verified with the ""target sign"". High resolution images, which clearly demonstrate the abnormalities of the scaphoid, can be produced even if the patient has a cast on the wrist or if there is hardware in situ."

They support a combined dorsal and palmar approach, open reduction, and internal fixation of scaphoid with a Herbert screw to obtain midcarpal stability. A carpal tunnel decompression should be performed if symptoms suggest median nerve entrapment. When the dislocation is unable to be reduced, the authors favor limited wrist arthrodesis or a proximal row carpectomy in the absence of significant arthritis."

Differential displacement of the scaphoid, lunate and triquetrum can in some instances be seen during arthroscopy of acute wrist injuries and also on overdistraction of distal radial fractures with an external fixator. We performed a prospective study on 20 patients with chronic wrist pain using 2 kg and 5 kg traction radiographs without and with the addition of an ischaemic block, to assess differential displacement as a diagnostic criterion for intrinsic ligament rupture. Arthroscopy was used as arbiter of diagnosis. The sensitivity ranged from 14% to 57% and the specificity ranged from 53.7% to 100% according to the amount of traction and ischaemic block. In view of these poor results we conclude the stretch test has no additional value in the preoperative assessment of chronic wrist pain."
CD010023,0,9456991,0,Commonly missed orthopedic problems.,"When not diagnosed early and managed appropriately, common musculoskeletal injuries may result in long-term disabling conditions. Anterior cruciate ligament tears are some of the most common knee ligament injuries. Slipped capital femoral epiphysis may present with little or no hip pain, and subtle or absent physical and radiographic findings. Femoral neck stress fractures, if left untreated, may result in avascular necrosis, refractures and pseudoarthrosis. A delay in diagnosis of scaphoid fractures may cause early wrist arthrosis if nonunion results. Ulnar collateral ligament tears are a frequently overlooked injury in skiers. The diagnosis of Achilles tendon rupture is missed as often as 25 percent of the time. Posterior tibial tendon tears may result in fixed bony planus if diagnosis is delayed, necessitating hindfoot fusion rather than simple soft tissue repair. Family physicians should be familiar with the initial assessment of these conditions and, when appropriate, refer patients promptly to an orthopedic surgeon."
CD010023,0,15290486,0,Wrist injuries; diagnosis with multidetector CT.,"The aim of the study was to assess acute-phase multidetector CT (MDCT) findings in wrist injuries. We retrieved all emergency room MDCT requests processed in the period from August 2000 to May 2003. All patients with a wrist injury who underwent MDCT initially were included. Imaging studies were evaluated in relation to injury mechanism, fracture location, and fracture type. A total of 6422 MDCT examinations were performed during this 34-month period, and 38 patients (24 male, 14 female, age range 21-73 years, mean age 40 years) met the inclusion criteria. MDCT revealed 56 fractures and 7 dislocations in 29 patients. In 9 patients (24%) MDCT findings were normal. Eleven patients (29%) underwent surgical procedures. The main injury mechanism was a fall (58%). In 33 cases the primary radiograph was available. Compared to primary radiographs, MDCT revealed 9 occult fractures, mainly in small carpal bones. In 14 cases a suspected fracture (of the scaphoid in 7 cases) was ruled out by MDCT. Due to high-quality two-dimensional reformatting, MDCT examinations were not dependent on the wrist's position in the CT gantry. In the comparison with radiography, MDCT detected occult fractures and ruled out suspected fractures, both mainly in the small carpal bones. High-quality two-dimensional reformats gave significant information about the fracture anatomy. MDCT provides fast and valuable information in assessing complex wrist fractures or when the primary radiograph is equivocal."

CD010023,0,1757005,0,[Diagnosis of torsion malposition of the radius and ulna after healed distal fracture].,Assessing radial and ulnar rotational deformities quantitatively by routine diagnosis after healed distal forearm fractures is very difficult. A method to obtain information about direction and graduation of malrotation is described. This method is based on discovering topographic changes of skeletal points by CT. Rotational angles of intact forearm bones are measured on anatomic specimen and in vivo using epiphyseal and diaphyseal axes of the radius and the ulna. Normal rotation of intact forearm bones varies in a specific manner. The radius presents less variations than the ulna. A morphological index of radial and ulnar rotation is not given because of the great individuality of diaphyseal rotation. Both radii of a single individuum show a very small rotational difference. Therefore a verification of malrotation is indicated by comparison to the intact opposite radius. Higher rotational graduations on the left side have to be noted.
CD010023,0,21733185,0,Fracture surgery of the extremities with the intra-operative use of 3D-RX: a randomized multicenter trial (EF3X-trial).,"Posttraumatic osteoarthritis can develop after an intra-articular extremity fracture, leading to pain and loss of function. According to international guidelines, anatomical reduction and fixation are the basis for an optimal functional result. In order to achieve this during fracture surgery, an optimal view on the position of the bone fragments and fixation material is a necessity. The currently used 2D-fluoroscopy does not provide sufficient insight, in particular in cases with complex anatomy or subtle injury, and even an 18-26% suboptimal fracture reduction is reported for the ankle and foot. More intra-operative information is therefore needed.Recently the 3D-RX-system was developed, which provides conventional 2D-fluoroscopic images as well as a 3D-reconstruction of bony structures. This modality provides more information, which consequently leads to extra corrections in 18-30% of the fracture operations. However, the effect of the extra corrections on the quality of the anatomical fracture reduction and fixation as well as on patient relevant outcomes has never been investigated.The objective of this study protocol is to investigate the effectiveness of the intra-operative use of the 3D-RX-system as compared to the conventional 2D-fluoroscopy in patients with traumatic intra-articular fractures of the wrist, ankle and calcaneus. The effectiveness will be assessed in two different areas: 1) the quality of fracture reduction and fixation, based on the current golden standard, Computed Tomography. 2) The patient-relevant outcomes like functional outcome range of motion and pain. In addition, the diagnostic accuracy of the 3D-RX-scan will be determined in a clinical setting and a cost-effectiveness as well as a cost-utility analysis will be performed."
CD010023,0,22058291,0,Displaced fracture of the waist of the scaphoid.,"A displaced fracture of the scaphoid is one in which the fragments have moved from their anatomical position or there is movement between them when stressed by physiological loads. Displacement is seen in about 20% of fractures of the waist of the scaphoid, as shown by translation, a gap, angulation or rotation. A CT scan in the true longitudinal axis of the scaphoid demonstrates the shape of the bone and displacement of the fracture more accurately than do plain radiographs. Displaced fractures can be treated in a plaster cast, accepting the risk of malunion and nonunion. Surgically the displacement can be reduced, checked radiologically, arthroscopically or visually, and stabilised with headless screws or wires. However, rates of union and deformity are unknown. Mild malunion is well tolerated, but the long-term outcome of a displaced fracture that healed in malalignment has not been established. This paper summarises aspects of the assessment, treatment and outcome of displaced fractures of the waist of the scaphoid."

As in scaphoid fractures, repeated radiographs, tomography, or bone scanning are necessary for the diagnosis. Reviewing the literature, we found that most capitate fractures reported were transverse or combined with other carpal injuries, including the scapho-capitate fracture syndrome. Our patient presented an isolated oblique intraarticular fracture of the capitate. An old fracture of the styloid process of the ulna was seen at the primary examination.

The method registers pre-operatively collected 3D computed tomography (CT) data sets of a single bone fragment to its intra-operative fluoroscope images. The registration technique relies on hardware rendering of CT data on consumer-grade graphics cards to generate digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) in real time. We also employ unscented Kalman filter to solve for the non-linear dynamics governing this 2D-3D registration problem. The method is validated on phantom models of three different anatomies, namely scaphoid, pelvis and femur.

We measured side-side differences in women aged > or =50 yr who had previously sustained a wrist fracture (4.0+/-3.5 mean yr since fracture). We used pQCT and DXA to measure bone in 31 women (mean age 72.4+/-9.7 yr) at the 4% and 30% sites of bilateral radii; measured grip strength and functional outcome. Initially, we compared the fractured side to intact side and did not control for hand dominance. We observed greater total area (ToA) at the distal (4%) radius on the fractured side without a significant increase in density. At the midshaft (30% site), we observed significantly less ToA and cortical bone on the fracture side. Grip strength was also significantly less on the fractured side (p<0.01). We assessed dominant side fractures and nondominant fractures separately. We observed a greater discrepancy between limbs with a nondominant side fracture, even after accounting for dominance. This cross-sectional study suggests that the bone response to a nondominant fracture may differ from a dominant fracture."
CD010023,0,9888678,0,Progressive patterns of degenerative arthritis in scaphoid nonunion demonstrated by three-dimensional computed tomography.,"Degenerative arthritis following scaphoid nonunion was studied in 28 patients (29 wrists) using X-ray computed tomography and three-dimensional computed tomography (3-DCT). Degenerative changes were observed in 18 wrists with plain radiography and 27 wrists with 3-DCT. 3-DCT imaging more readily revealed osteophyte formation in osteoarthritis than plain radiography. 3-DCT images showed degenerative changes in the distal fragment of the scaphoid earlier than plain radiography. We found three stages of osteophyte formation in the radioscaphoid joint using 3-DCT. In the first stage, a linear osteophyte formed along the most radial portion of the distal fragment of the scaphoid. In the second stage, the radial styloid became pointed. In the third stage, the osteophyte on the distal fragment enlarged and lay over the dorsum of the radioscaphoid joint and other intercarpal joints."

CD010023,0,1288402,0,[Scaphoid bone].,"The scaphoid is the most important carpal bone due to the frequency of its pathological involvement. Two points of radiological anatomy are stressed: the presence of the scaphoid tubercle whose projection gives rise to the scaphoid ring, the solid radio-capitatum ligament which bridges the scaphoid. Scaphoid fracture represents 70% of all carpal bone fractures and its presence must therefore be meticulously investigated on appropriate x-rays or on tomographies or CT scans, rather than by the classical repeat examination a fortnight later. CT provides good analysis of scaphoid fragments when consolidation is delayed (pseudarthrosis), allowing earlier and more justified indications for surgery. The wrist ligaments are poorly visualised by MRI at the present time; but it allows study of the cartilage and, most importantly, is a decisive examination when there is a doubt about bone vitality."
CD010023,0,2217754,0,[Computed tomography of the wrist].,"CT is a diagnostic tool that allows imaging of the wrist, wrist joint and distal radioulnar joint in the axial plane without superimposition.

This is helpful in the diagnosis of traumatic, degenerative or malignant lesions of bones together with the soft tissue reactions. Further information can be obtained by means of three-dimensional reconstructions."
CD010023,0,1288404,0,[Distal radio-ulnar joint. Traumatic and degenerative diseases].,"The distal radio-ulnar joint participates in the biomechanics of the wrist both by transmission of carpal stresses and by its role in the mobility of the wrist. Fractures of the distal radio-ulnar joint are often missed as they are frequently only a radiation of fractures of the radius to the distal radio-ulnar joint. Computed tomography is the most useful examination to assess the severity of these lesions. Distal radio-ulnar dislocations may also be associated with fractures of the radius, but usually occur in isolation. The diagnosis is difficult, as the slightest rotation on plain X-rays interferes with the evaluation criteria. A CT scan in the neutral position and in pronation and supination is the examination of choice for dislocations and subluxations, but must be interpreted according to strict criteria. In contrast, a tea of the triangular ligament can only be assessed on arthrography and the distinction between traumatic and degenerative rupture is difficult. The patient's age, the site of the perforation and the length of the ulna are important elements in the diagnostic decision. MRI appears to be a promising examination for investigation of this joint, but the quality of the images is not yet perfectly reproducible."
CD010023,0,8950387,0,Traumatic type B aortic dissection.,"A 37-year-old man was referred with thoracic pain after a deceleration trauma. He also had a cerebral contusion and a wrist fracture. There were no sings of hypovolemic shock. Computerized tomography (CT) of the chest and transoesophageal echocardiography (TEE) demonstrated a type B aortic dissection originating just distal to the left subclavian artery. There was a patent false lumen without rupture or distal ischaemia. Conservative treatment was given. A paralytic ileus developed and abdominal complaints persisted for several months. Angiography showed normal patency of mesenteric vessels. On follow-up, 3 years after the accident a slight aortic dilation was found on CT thorax without development of a post-dissection aneurysm. Blunt thoracic injury to the aorta usually gives rise to aortic rupture in the region of the isthmus, which can be complete or partial. In the latter case a false aneurysm may develop. An intimal tear after blunt trauma leading to type B aortic dissection rarely occurs. General principles regarding treatment of type B dissection also apply to this particular condition."

The scintillation camera with positron detection represents a unique instrumentation system because of its tomographic effect, relative insensitivity to vascular radioactivity in the surrounding skeleton, and excellent spatial resolution despite low counting efficiency. In 75 patients with avascular disorders about the hip, knee, elbow, foot and hand, the impressions obtained from fluoride-18 scintigraphy were correlated with clinical findings and roentgenograms and when possible confirmed by tetracycline labeling and histological examination. Fluoride-18 scintigraphy was useful: in determining the vascularity of the femoral head following femoral neck fractures; in determining results of treatment; and in diagnosing early the various avascular necrotic disorders of the bone."

Evidence is provided that bone scintigraphy is indicated in patients with negative initial scaphoid radiographs. A normal bone scan excludes scaphoid fracture, and a positive bone scan sufficiently confirms the presence of clinically relevant scaphoid fracture. Furthermore, this review assesses the possibility on non-invasive additional radiographs, for the diagnosis or exclusion on scaphoid fracture as a means of avoiding bone scintigraphy in patients with negative first-day X-series."
CD010023,0,2423943,0,[Pseudarthrosis of the scaphoid].,"For the treatment of scaphoid non-unions, innumerable curative and palliative operations have been recommended. Of the curative operations, the various methods of bone grafting give the best results, whereas screw fixation is not satisfactory. Bone pegs with a cortical graft are no longer used because of technical difficulties. Corticocancellous grafts (Matti-Russe) yield bony union in almost 90% of cases. The combination of corticocancellous grafts with plate stabilization gives the highest rate of bony union (99%). A cure should therefore always be attempted in all non-union cases, with the exception of cases already involving severe, generalized osteoarthritis or extensive necrosis of the scaphoid. Of the different palliative methods, the early results of prosthetic partial or total replacement of the scaphoid are satisfactory. Late results are less satisfactory, with a high rate of complications and carpal collapse. With severe osteoarthrosis, proximal carpectomy, especially the transscaphoideo-lunate resection, gives good results. Intercarpal arthrodeses have been disappointing. Radiocarpal arthrodesis results in a pain-free, strong wrist; however, there is complete loss of motion, whereas denervation gives satisfactory results in 57% and preserved mobility of the wrist."

CD010023,0,11040298,0,Osseous integration of bovine hydroxyapatite ceramic in metaphyseal bone defects of the distal radius.,Hydroxyapatite ceramic made of bovine spongiosa was used as structural support material in a prospective study to correct bone defects experienced after reduction in distal radius fractures. The study took place over a 3-year period (1992-1999) and comprised 14 patients. Osseous integration was analyzed via biopsies and magnetic resonance imaging. Long-term follow-up monitoring involving magnetic resonance imaging in 13 of the 14 patients showed fibrovascular growth within incorporated hydroxyapatite material. Osseous integration was demonstrated in magnetic resonance images by gadolinium uptake and by the presence of osteoid layers and endothelialized vessels. Hydroxyapatite ceramic offers a biologically acceptable alternative to autologous bone when augmenting distal radius fracture fixation.
CD010023,0,21823992,0,Reliability and validity of measurement and associations between disability and behavioural factors in patients with Colles' fracture.,"The aims of the study were to 1) investigate the test-retest reliability, the internal consistency in instruments that measure behavioural factors and disability as well as to investigate convergent validity between the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand Outcome Questionnaire (DASH) and the Patient-Rated Wrist Evaluation (PRWE), in patients with Colles' fracture; and 2) assess the relationship between the behavioural measures and the region-specific measures addressing the patient perceptions of impairment, functional loss, and disability. Two samples (sample 1 = 16; sample 2 = 16) of patients with the fracture immobilised in plaster cast were included. The participants answered the Patient-Rated Wrist Evaluation (PRWE), Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand Outcome Questionnaire (DASH), Tampa Scale of Kinesophobia (TSK), Catastrophizing Subscale (CAT) of the Coping Strategies Questionnaire (CSQ), and Self-Efficacy Scale (SES) twice. Test-retest reliability was satisfactory for all instruments. The internal consistency examined with Cronbach's alpha was between 0.68 and 0.97. Because acceptable to good test-retest reliability and internal consistency were demonstrated for the PRWE, DASH, TSK, CAT of the CSQ, and SES, they can be used to detect and monitor fear of movement/(re)injury, catastrophic cognitions, and self-efficacy in patients with radius fracture in the acute and subacute phase. Generally low to moderate correlations were found between behavioural and region-specific measures, indicating that there are two distinct concepts that are not interchangeable."
CD010023,0,18762479,0,Observer variation in MRI for suspected scaphoid fractures.,"The aim of this study was to evaluate prospectively the observer variation in the detection of pathology on MRI for suspected acute scaphoid fracture. 79 consecutive MR scans were included to calculate the inter-observer variation. All patients were suspected of having a scaphoid fracture but had no fracture on radiographs. 38 randomly chosen MR scans were used to calculate the intra-observer variation. Four observers, with varying levels of expertise, blinded scored three items: (i) scaphoid fracture, (ii) localization of a scaphoid fracture, and (iii) another fracture. The observer variation was analysed using the kappa statistic. The inter-observer variation for a scaphoid fracture showed substantial agreement. For the localization of a scaphoid fracture and another fracture, there was a moderate and substantial agreement, respectively. The intra-observer variation for a scaphoid fracture had an almost perfect agreement. For the localization of a scaphoid fracture and another fracture, there was an almost perfect and substantial agreement, respectively. In conclusion, the observer variation in MRI of suspected scaphoid fractures was low. The influence of expertise with MRI in daily practice should be taken into consideration. Observers with little experience of MRI will identify all scaphoid fractures but are likely to over-diagnose injuries. Based on these results, it is recommended that all scans are reviewed by an experienced radiologist."

CD010023,0,12690849,0,Scaphoid fractures: current treatments and techniques.,"Scaphoid fractures are among the most common fractures of the bones of the wrist and usually result from a forceful extension of the wrist. If the diagnosis cannot be established by clinical and radiographic examination, bone scans are recommended and are preferred over tomography or MRI, which are more expensive diagnostic procedures. Scaploid fractures should be classified as either undisplaced, stable or displaced, unstable. Nonsurgical treatment with cast immobilization (short arm-thumb spica cast) is recommended for stable fractures; however, there is increased interest in percutaneous screw (or pin) fixation. The recommended treatment for unstable scaphoid fractures is open reduction and screw fixation. Closed reduction and percutaneous screw or pin fixation can be considered in minimally displaced or reducible fractures, whereas open reduction is recommended for all other displaced fractures. The following treatment protocols are recommended: (1) bone scan or, if necessary, tomography for early diagnosis; (2) percutaneous screw fixation of nondisplaced or minimally displaced scaphoid fractures as an alternative to treatment with a thumb spica cast; (3) open reduction of displaced scaphoid fractures; (4) early mobilization of stable fractures after internal fixation; and (5) the possible use of a playing splint after athletic injuries when secure internal fixation is achieved."

CD010023,0,8164094,0,Cortical and trabecular bone contribute strength to the osteopenic distal radius.,"Fractures of the distal radius are common, especially in postmenopausal women, and their prevalence increases with age. Knowledge of the factors that increase the risk of fracture in this metaphyseal region would have predictive and therapeutic implications. Of particular interest in this study were (a) the relative contributions of cortical and trabecular bone to the strength of the distal radius and (b) the best radiographic features to use as strength indicators. In 21 forearms from fresh cadavera (median age at the time of death, 75 years), single photon absorptiometry and quantitative computed tomography were used to determine bone mineral content (BMC), density (BMC/W), and cross-sectional properties of the radius at distal and midshaft sites. Mechanical testing of the forearms then was used to determine the ultimate force and energy to cause the type of fracture that might be caused by a fall on the outstretched hand. Twelve of the 17 tested specimens sustained a fracture of the distal radius, and five sustained a fracture of the scaphoid. In the group of fractures of the distal radius, we found the cross-sectional area and moment of inertia of the cortical shell at the metaphyseal site to be better correlates of strength than the trabecular area and trabecular moment. In contrast, strength correlated much better with trabecular density than with cortical density. Overall, the best correlates of strength were the BMC and BMC/W at either the distal or proximal site. On balance, these results suggest that the thin cortical shell contributes substantially more to the mechanical strength of the distal radius than has been commonly appreciated."

In addition many patients are unhappy with the unpleasant appearance of the wrist joint. The complaints are related to tears of the triangular fibrocartilaginous complex, instability, and/or incongruity of the distal radioulnar joint and degenerative changes.

CD010023,0,8753688,1,Magnetic resonance imaging versus bone scintigraphy in suspected scaphoid fracture.,"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become increasingly useful in the evaluation of musculoskeletal problems, including those of the wrist. In patients with a wrist injury, MRI is used mainly to assess vascularity of scaphoid non-union. However, the use of MRI in patients in the acute phase following carpal injury is not common. Three-phase bone scintigraphy is routinely performed from at least 72 h after injury in patients with suspected scaphoid fracture and negative initial radiographs. We evaluated MRI in this patient group. The bone scan was used as the reference method. Nineteen patients were included. Bone scintigraphy was performed in all 19 patients, but MRI could be obtained in only 16 (in three patients, MRI was stopped owing to claustrophobia). In five patients, MRI confirmed a scintigraphically suspected scaphoid fracture. In one patient, a perilunar luxation, without a fracture, was seen on MRI, while bone scintigraphy showed a hot spot in the region of the lunate bone, suspected for fracture. This was confirmed by surgery. In two patients, a hot spot in the scaphoid region was suspected for scaphoid fracture, and immobilization and employed for a period of 12 weeks. MRI was negative in both cases; in one of them a scaphoid fracture was retrospectively proven on the initial X-ray series. In another two patients, a hot spot in the region of MCP I was found with a negative MRI. In both, the therapy was adjusted. In the remaining six patients, both modalities were negative. We conclude that in the diagnostic management of patients with suspected scaphoid fracture and negative initial radiographs, the use of MRI may be promising, but is not superior to three-phase bone scintigraphy."

We conducted histomorphometric study of the scaphoid using micro CT to find regional variations and differences in the scaphoid to provide better understanding of fracture mechanism and suggest optimal screw position. We divided scaphoid into eight regions and collected regional data from eleven different cadaveric scaphoids. A computer program was used to measure parameters, which includes mean subchondral bone thickness, bone mineral density for bone density parameters, and tissue mineral density, trabecular thickness, trabecular spacing, trabecular number and bone volume fraction for bone quality parameters. All bone strength parameters were measured the maximum value in the regions where scaphoid articulates with radius. Articular regions presented higher bone strength parameters and thicker subchondral bone. The minimum value of trabecular number was in midcarpal side of waist portion. There was trend of higher subchondral bone thickness in the scaphoid which articulates with capitate and radius. This histomorphometric study showed regional variation of the scaphoid in terms of bone density and quality parameters.

Fourty-eight patients with histologically confirmed osteoid osteoma of the upper extremity treated at the authors' department from 1985 to 2000 were retrospectively reviewed. Data pertinent on the patients' history, lesion location, clinical and imaging characteristics as well as any unique features of individual patients were collected. There were 29 males and 19 females with a mean age of 28 years (range 20-42). The average duration of symptoms before definite diagnosis was 18 months (range 2-62). Pain was the presenting symptom in 46 of 48 patients, whereas swelling was the main complaint in 2 of the patients. Mean pre-operative visual analogue pain scale (VAS), was 8.8 ranging from 5.1 to 9.3. Eight lesions were located in the humerus, 4 in the ulna and 7 in the radius. In the carpal bones, 4 were located in the scaphoid, 4 in the capitate and 5 in the hamate. Seven lesions were located at the metacarpals and 9 lesions at the phalanges (5 proximal, no middle and 4 distal phalangeal lesions). Radiographs alone were sufficient to establish the diagnosis of osteoid osteoma in 32 cases. Bone scans identified a ""hot spot"" in 16 patients without previous radiographic evidence of a lesion and furthermore, computed tomography was performed in 32 patients to assist in the intraosseous localization of the lesion, and in the pre-operative planning. All patients underwent operative excision of the lesion and the diagnosis was confirmed by histology. Mean follow-up was 28 months (range 25-42). Fourty-three patients had an uneventful recovery. Mean post-operative VAS value was 1.8 ranging from 0 to 3. Osteoid osteoma of the upper extremity often mimics other etiologies and the complex anatomy of the upper extremity, as well as the tendency of patients to relate their symptoms to trauma are factors that easily lead to misdiagnosis or delay in the diagnosis. A high index of suspicion is essential and the diagnosis is based on an accurate clinical assessment and careful selection of imaging studies."

The following conclusions are drawn: 99m-Tc-MDP wrist scintigraphy is of high sensitivity, but low specificity in the detection of scaphoid bone fractures. The scintigraphy is expedient to exclude scaphoid bone fracture, if performed after secondary clinical and radiographic assessment, and guided by negative scintigrams a reduction of clinical examinations, radiographies and superfluous casting days is achieved."

In most cases, attention was drawn to the lesion when X-rays were performed after a recent injury to the wrist. Typically, they occurred eccentrically and were surrounded by a radio-dense rim of bone. In a few cases the cortex was breached but never expanded by the lesion. Curettage and bone grafting were performed only if symptoms persisted and no other source for the pain could be found. Most contained the typical jelly-like material also found in soft tissue ganglia and the histology showed an identical structure. A suggested format for the management of these lesions is presented."

CD010023,0,1451699,0,The reliability of the 3-phase bone scan in suspected scaphoid fracture: an inter- and intraobserver variability analysis.,"In the diagnosis of scaphoid fracture, the dynamic phase of the radionuclide bone scan alone has been recommended as an early test. To evaluate the independent reliability of the dynamic and static phases of the 3-phase bone scan in this diagnosis, 3 examiners reviewed the 3-phase bone scans of a series of 60 patients with clinical signs of fracture of the carpal scaphoid and with negative or non-diagnostic initial radiographs. The interpretation was performed independently and without the benefit of additional data. The bone scans were reviewed after 1 year by the same observers. The results were analyzed using kappa statistics. The bone scan was suspicious of fracture of the scaphoid in 15 patients. Irrespective of training and experience, the kappa values of the dynamic bone scan between any 2 observers did not exceed 0.57. The kappa values increased significantly when the static phase of the bone scan was examined (> 0.81). The intraobserver variability showed a similar pattern. We conclude that in suspected scaphoid fracture, the dynamic phase of the radionuclide bone scan alone cannot be used as a reliable diagnostic approach because of the low inter- and intraobserver agreement in the interpretation, irrespective of the experience and training of the observer."
CD010023,0,18665795,0,High-resolution pQCT analysis at the distal radius and tibia discriminates patients with recent wrist and femoral neck fractures.,"We depict a fragility bone state in two primitive osteoporosis populations using 3D high-resolution peripheral in vivo QCT (HR-pQCT). Postmenopausal women (C, controls, n = 54; WF, wrist, n = 50; HF, hip, n = 62 recent fractured patients) were analyzed for lumbar and hip DXA areal BMD (aBMD), cancellous and cortical volumetric BMD (vBMD), and microstructural and geometric parameters on tibia and radius by HR-pQCT. Principal component analysis (PCA) allowed extracting factors that best represent bone variables. Comparison between groups was made by analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Two factors (>80% of the entire variability) are extracted by PCA: at the radius, the first is a combination of trabecular parameters and the second of cortical parameters. At the tibia, we found the reverse. Femoral neck aBMD is decreased in WF (8.6%) and in HF (18%) groups (no lumbar difference). WF showed a approximately 20% reduction in radius trabecular vBMD and number. Radius cortical vBMD and thickness decrease by 6% and 14%, respectively. At the tibia, only the cortical compartment is affected, with approximately 20% reduction in bone area, thickness, and section modulus and 6% reduction in vBMD. HF showed same radius trabecular alterations than WF, but radius cortical parameters are more severely affected than WF with reduced bone area (25%), thickness (28.5%), and vBMD (11%). At the tibia, trabecular vBMD and number decrease by 26% and 17.5%, respectively. Tibia cortical bone area, thickness, and section modulus showed a >30% decrease, whereas vBMD reduction reached 13%. Geometry parameters at the tibia displayed the greatest differences between healthy and fractured patients and between wrist and hip fractures."

All of these patients additionally underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans within an average of 3 days after trauma to control the results of this study. MRI detected 112 injuries in 82 patients (67%). Twenty-eight (25%) of these injuries were scaphoid fractures. There were 15 fractures of other carpal bones, 14 avulsion fractures of extrinsic ligaments (AFL), 26 other bone injuries (fractures of distal radius, fractures of radial styloid, ulnar head fracture metacarpal fracture, bone bruises), and 29 soft tissue injuries (triangular fibro-cartilaginous complex injuries, complete or partial ruptures of the scapholunate ligament, ruptures of the radial collateral ligament, hemarthrosis). By means of repeated clinical examinations and plain scaphoid views, experienced observers were able to detect all the occult scaphoid fractures within 38 days, as well as most of the other fractures about the wrist except one fracture of the triquetrum. Soft tissue injuries, however, were diagnosed only in two cases of complete scapholunate ligament tears. It was further obvious that 70% of all scaphoid fractures and 60% of the AFLs were detected in a review of the initial X-rays by experienced surgeons. Only 30% of all scaphoid fractures detected were really occult and all of these were diagnosed correctly. This prospective study demonstrates that clinical and radiological standard procedures are reliable in the diagnosis of occult fractures of the carpus and wrist when performed by experienced observers. MRI scans are indicated for early diagnosis of occult fractures and soft tissue injuries about the wrist."

CD010023,0,10613233,0,"Diagnosis and treatment of scaphoid fractures, can non-union be prevented?","In order to evaluate the diagnostic management of scaphoid fracture, 100 consecutive patients with clinically suspected scaphoid fractures were investigated. If a scaphoid fracture was seen on scaphoid radiographs, patients were immobilized in a plaster cast. If the radiographs were negative or dubious for scaphoid fracture, patients were referred for three phase bone scintigraphy. Then the patient was treated according to the result of the bone scan. A long-term follow-up (minimum 1 year) was performed in order to evaluate the incidence of non-union. In 49 of the 100 patients, a fracture of the scaphoid was recognized, in 29 of whom their scaphoid X-series was positive for scaphoid fracture. In 3 of the remaining 71 patients with negative scaphoid X-series, additional carpal box radiographs showed a scaphoid fracture, while 68 patients were referred for three-phase bone scintigraphy. Of these 68 patients, 17 patients (25%) showed a hotspot on the bone scan in the region of the scaphoid. We found that scaphoid radiographs, additional carpal box radiographs and the bone scan (in radiographically negative patients) in combination with conservative therapy did not lead to non-union at long-term follow-up in patients who were treated for scaphoid fracture. We conclude that when a scaphoid fracture is diagnosed within the 1st week followed by plaster immobilization, non-union of the scaphoid could be prevented."

MRI evaluation revealed that 27 of the 60 patients (45%) had triangular fibrocartilage lesions. No correlation was found between triangular fibrocartilage injury and the Melone classification system, the presence of an ulnar styloid fracture, comminution of the articular surface of the distal radius, >20 degrees dorsal angulation of the distal radius or subluxation/dislocation of the distal radioulnar joint on the plain X-rays. When Frykman Type VI and VIII fractures were compared with all the other Frykman subtypes, a significant difference in the incidence of triangular fibrocartilage complex tears was observed.

CD010023,0,14612641,0,Displacement of the distal radioulnar joint of clinically symptom-free patients.,"There are three methods for evaluation of dislocation of the distal radioulnar joint using computed tomography: the radioulnar line method, the epicenter method, and the congruity method. However, some patients who are clinically symptom-free have abnormal findings from computed tomography of the distal radioulnar joint according to the aforementioned criteria. In addition, these methods are qualitative, not quantitative definitions. Forty patients were included in this study. Computed tomography scans of the wrists were done. The variation of displacement of the distal radioulnar joint was measured. By the epicenter method, the 95% confidence interval (mean +/- 1.96 standard error) was from 0.0026 to 0.1114 in supination and from -0.1171 to 0.0446 in pronation. By the radioulnar line method, the 95% confidence interval was from 0.0026 to 0.0479 in supination and from -0.0065 to 0.0745 in pronation. By the modified radioulnar line method, the 95% confidence interval was from 0.1778 to 0.2752 in supination and from 0.0990 to 0.2310 in pronation. There was a wide range of the displacement of the distal radioulnar joint in patients with clinically normal wrists. The results can be regarded as reference points for normal variation of the distal radioulnar joint. This can help to differentiate the causes of internal derangement of the wrist."
CD010023,0,8885535,0,Fractures and nonunions of the scaphoid.,"Fractures of the scaphoid are the most common of all fractures of the carpal bones. Scaphoid collapse and angular deformity may develop after fractures. Scaphoid nonunion often complicates scaphoid fractures especially if the diagnosis is missed initially, and adequate timely treatment is not provided. Displaced unstable fractures also have a tendency to develop nonunion. The tenuous vascular anatomy of the scaphoid, the inherent biomechanical instability of scaphoid fractures, and the difficulty of radiographic diagnosis are the culprits of nonunion. Established scaphoid nonunion is a challenging and difficult problem to treat and more so is the treatment of failed nonunion after grafting. New methods of diagnosis and treatment of scaphoid injuries are constantly evolving. One common method of treating scaphoid nonunion with angular deformity is length restoration using a wedge bone graft and Herbert screw fixation through a palmar approach. Early diagnosis and attention to details of surgical technique are necessary for successful treatment outcome. The purpose of this report is to review the basic science, diagnosis, and treatment of scaphoid fractures and nonunions."

This report outlines the case of a 35-year-old healthy man who sustained a bony avulsion of the subscapularis tendon during an abduction external rotation trauma to his left shoulder. The injury was diagnosed by physical examination, standard radiographs, and magnetic resonance imaging. An arthroscopic reconstruction including closed reduction and internal fixation using suture anchors was performed. After a follow-up of 6 months, the patient's Constant Score increased from 62.4 points preoperatively to 91.3 points. At the latest follow-up, the patient was completely pain free, had regained a full work activity level, and returned to overhead sports. On postoperative standard radiographs and magnetic resonance images, the bony fragment was shown to be consolidated in an anatomic position. In cases of displaced isolated fractures of the lesser tuberosity without significant subluxation or dislocation of the long head of the biceps arthroscopic reconstruction using suture anchors can lead to a good clinical and radiological result."

Reduction of articular fractures of the distal radius and pin fixation, reduction of scaphoid fractures and intramedullary fixation, and arthroscopic reduction and transcutaneous pin stabilization of acute carpal dissociation patterns can all be accomplished with minimally invasive techniques under arthroscopic control. These measures often provide the athlete with shorter periods of immobilization and earlier return to athletic competition. Wrist arthroscopy provides a very useful adjunct to the treatment armamentarium of all sports medicine physicians."
CD010023,0,18219475,0,[A new vascularized cartilague-bone-graft for scaphoid nonunion with avascular necrosis of the proximal pole. Description of a new type of surgical procedure].,"The formation of a scaphoid pseudarthrosis with avascular necrosis in the area of the carpus is a The formation of a scaphoid pseudarthrosis with avascular necrosis in the area of the carpus is a dreaded complication after conservative or operative treatment of a scaphoid bone fracture, which previously often led to partial or total stiffening operations on the wrist. Vascularized bone grafts can be used to increase the bone fusion rates in the presence of scaphoid pseudarthrosis with avascular necrosis. On a note of caution, it must be mentioned, though, that such a procedure in the presence of avascular necrosis of the proximal pole with destruction of cartilage can lead to premature radiocarpal arthritis, because a friction-free gliding in the area of the proximal scaphoid pole is no longer ensured as a result of the lacking cartilage cover.We confronted these problems in a 20-year-old male patient with avascular necrosis of the proximal scaphoid bone pole and destruction of the corresponding scaphoidal cartilage cover. We transplanted a free vascularized cartilage-bone graft from the medial femoral condyle, which was adapted in form and size to the proximal scaphoid bone pole with corresponding cartilage cover and was connected to the radial vascular bundle. This novel operation technique is described in this report and appears to be a promising way of avoiding premature radiocarpal arthritis when treating scaphoid bone pseudo-arthrosis with avascular necrosis in the presence of cartilage destruction."

The 12,162 women who responded to fracture questions of the baseline postal enquiry (in 1989) of the Kuopio Osteoporosis Study, Finland formed the study population. They reported 589 former and 2092 subsequent fractures. The hazard ratio (HR), with 95% confidence interval (CI), of a subsequent fracture was 1.9 (1.6-2.3) in women with the history of a former fracture compared with women without such a history. A former low-energy wrist fracture was related to subsequent low-energy wrist [HR = 3.7 (2.0-6.8)] and high-energy nonwrist [HR = 2.4 (1.3-4.4)] fractures, whereas former high-energy nonwrist fractures were related only to subsequent high-energy nonwrist [HR = 2.8 (1.9-4.1)] but not to low-energy wrist [HR = 0.7 (0.3-1.8)] fractures. The analysis of bone mineral density (BMD) data of a subsample of premenopausal women who underwent dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) during 1989-91 revealed that those with a wrist fracture due to a fall on the same level at the age of 20-34 recorded 6.5% lower spinal (P = 0.140) and 10.5% lower femoral (P = 0.026) BMD than nonfractured women, whereas the corresponding differences for women with a former nonwrist fracture due to high-energy trauma were -1.8% (P = 0.721) and -2.4% (P = 0. 616), respectively. Our results suggest that an early premenopausal, low-energy wrist fracture is an indicator of low peak BMD which predisposes to subsequent fractures in general, whereas early high-energy fractures are mainly indicators of other and more specific extraskeletal factors which mainly predispose to same types of subsequent fractures only."

The sensitivity and specificity of PACS for diagnosing scaphoid fractures was 79.5% and 81.6%, versus 78.1% and 83.8% for conventional films. There is no significant difference in accuracy of diagnosis between PACS and laser film copies when scaphoid X-rays are reported by emergency physicians."
CD010023,0,15580844,0,Comparison of computer display monitors for computed radiography diagnostic application in a radiology PACS.,"A study to compare the performance of the following display monitors for application as PACS CR diagnostic workstations is described. 1. Diagnostic quality, 3 megapixel, 21 inch monochrome LCD monitors. 2. Commercial grade, 2 megapixel, 20 inch colour LCD monitors. Two sets of fifty radiological studies each were presented separately to five radiologists on two occasions, using different displays on each occasion. The two sets of radiological studies were CR of the chest, querying the presence of pneumothorax, and CR of the wrist, querying the presence of a scaphoid fracture. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed for diagnostic performance for each presentation. Areas under the ROC curves (AUC) for diagnosis using different monitors were compared for each image set and the following results obtained: Set 1: Monochrome AUC = 0.873 +/- 0.026; Colour AUC = 0.831 +/- 0.032; Set 2: Monochrome AUC = 0.945 +/- 0.014; Colour AUC = 0.931 +/- 0.019; Differences in AUC were attributed to the different monitors. While not significant at a 95% confidence level, the results have supported a cautious approach to consideration of the use of commercial grade LCD colour monitors for diagnostic application."

CD010023,0,7706878,0,Clinical signs in scaphoid fractures.,In a prospective study we investigated 12 clinical features for scaphoid fractures in 52 patients: 23 in whom a fracture of the scaphoid was diagnosed radiologically and 29 patients in whom a fracture was clinically suspected but could not be confirmed by radiography or scintigraphy. The signs were tested within a few days of injury and again 2 weeks later. None was reliable in diagnosing a scaphoid fracture.

A prospective study was carried out in 99 patients presenting with an injury clinically suggestive of a scaphoid fracture. 74 patients had positive scaphoid compression tests with 24 of these patients having a scaphoid fracture visible on initial X-ray and seven having a fracture diagnosed either by repeat X-ray or bone scan 2 weeks after injury. 25 patients had a negative test, with ten having a scaphoid fracture visible on initial X-ray and three on repeat X-ray at 2 weeks. These results show that this test had a sensitivity of 70.5%, a specificity of 21.8% and predictive value of 41.9%. A positive scaphoid compression test is an unreliable diagnostic aid for a scaphoid fracture."
CD010023,0,11518981,0,[Carpal injuries associated with distal radius fractures. Diagnosis and therapy].,"The frequency of carpal injuries associated with distal radius fractures is often underestimated. Diagnosis of such lesions can be difficult. Important diagnostic steps include conventional X-rays, cinematography of the wrist, MRI, and arthroscopy. Different procedures such as wrist arthrography and CT are of secondary value. An early diagnosis of ligament injuries and instabilities can be obtained through cinematographic examination, whereas injuries to the TFCC are mainly diagnosed by MRI. Arthroscopy provides exact diagnosis as well as therapy, including arthroscopically controlled reposition of centrally depressed fragments of the articular surface of the radius and even treatment of TFCC lesions."

Magnetic resonance imaging was performed prior to wrist arthroscopy. The latter examination gave the definite diagnosis. MRI was performed in conventional technique (without contrast medium) in 25 cases and after additional intravenous injection of contrast medium in the remaining 20 patients. The images were obtained with a 1.0-T clinical imager using a T(2)-weighted turbo spin echo sequence (slice 3 mm, transversal) and a FLASH 2D sequence (slice 2 mm, oblique/coronal). Three independent observers assessed the MRI scans before arthroscopy was performed. The correct diagnosis was made by MRI in 76 %. Overall sensitivity and specificity came to 71 % and 86 %, respectively. The use of intravenously applied contrast medium did not improve MRI accuracy. In conclusion, MRI is not recommended for the diagnosis of scapholunate ligament tears. Presumably, the results of MRI could be improved by a more sophisticated technique."
CD010023,0,11337918,0,[Role of wrist instability in the onset of pseudoarthrosis of the scaphoid bone].,"The most common fracture involving the wrist is a fracture of the scaphoid bone. Fracture of the scaphoid most frequently occurs in young adult male and usually involves the wrist of the scaphoid. There is a universal agreement that the majority of these fractures will heal if immobilized property and for a long period of time [1, 2]. In the treatment of these fractures much attention has been payed to bone damage and not to associated ligament injury. It is reported that the incidence of nonunion of scaphoid fractures is ten per cent and that the frequency of this complication remains essentially unchanged [3, 4]. Failure to improve the outcome suggests that the mechanisms and causes of this complication are poorly understood. Explanations of nonunion or delayed union of scaphoid bone are: poor initial treatment or even no treatment [3], delayed diagnosis [5], fragments displacement [5-8], improper immobilization [9], site and direction of the fracture [3] and wrist instability [8, 10]."

Especially in the diagnosis of fractures of the distal radius the exact positioning of the arm and hand is essential. For the description of fractures of the distal forearm the AO classification of fractures should be used, which is comprehensive and universally applicable. Conventional tomography and computed tomography (CT) of the radio-ulnar joint and the wrist are used in patients with persisting complaints or equivocal findings on plain radiographs, and difficult anatomical situations. Suspected ligamentous injuries of the wrist including tears of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) are evaluated by wrist arthrography or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the latter requiring a highly skilled imaging and interpretation technique. MRI is the method of choice for the detection of osteonecrosis. Ultrasound examination are of minor importance in the work up of wrist and hand injuries."

First radiograghs at our clinic revealed an oblique fracture with a displacement of 5 mm on the lateral view, which we successfully treated with immobilization. When complete union was recognized in the radiographs, the capitate had a deformity consisting of a large prominence on the palmar aspect.

Eleven years after injury, there were no radiographic changes such as malalignment or arthrosis in the carpal bones."
CD010023,0,16006021,0,Partial union of acute scaphoid fractures.,"Sixty-six patients with acute scaphoid fractures were treated non-operatively in a below elbow plaster for 8 to 12 weeks and underwent CT scans along the longitudinal axis of the scaphoid at 12 to 18 weeks. These scans showed that 14 fractures had not united and that 30 had united throughout the whole cross-section of the scaphoid. The other 22 had partially united with bridging trabeculae in some areas of the cross-section. These 22 partial unions were graded as 0% to 24% union (0 cases), 25% to 49% union (5 cases), 50% to 74% union (7 cases), and 75% to 99% union (10 cases). The 12 patients who had less than 75% fracture union were followed-up further and nine underwent another CT scan at 23 to 40 weeks after the initial injury. These showed union across the whole of the cross-section of the fracture in seven cases and 75% to 99% union in the other two cases, who had full and painless wrist function. We conclude that partial union of the scaphoid is a common occurrence but, in most cases, it progresses to full union without the need for prolonged plaster immobilization."

With the wrists prone and immobilized, bone scintigrams were obtained for 500,000 counts with an asymmetric (133 to 161 keV) Tc-99m energy window and either a converging (best choice) or straight-bore, high-resolution collimator. High-resolution scintigraphy precisely localized degenerative joint disease (nine patients), scaphoid fractures (five), pisiform fracture (one), lunate avascular necrosis (one), radioulnar arthritis (one), septic or inflammatory arthritis (six), ulnocarpal impingement (two), and reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome (two).

CD010023,0,2315496,0,Demonstration of the scapholunate space with radiography.,"The importance of radiographic evaluation of the scapholunate space, which should not be wider than 2 mm, has been well established in cases of wrist injury. Unfortunately, the assessment of this space is not accurately determined with routine posteroanterior (PA) radiographs, because the scaphoid and lunate bones often overlap. Moreover, the exact portion of the scapholunate space that should be measured has never been clearly defined. Nine wrists with a scapholunate space no wider than 2 mm and without chondrocalcinosis were studied by means of plain routine views and special projections, transaxial and coronal computed tomographic scans, and dissection to determine the precise orientation and anatomy of this space. A PA radiograph with 10 degrees of tube angulation from the ulna toward the radius best demonstrated the scapholunate space. This space should be measured at the level of the midportion of the flat lateral facet of the scaphoid."

CD010023,0,9523959,0,Measurement of the scaphoid humpback deformity using longitudinal computed tomography: intra- and interobserver variability using various measurement techniques.,"The intra- and interobserver variability of 3 techniques for measuring the humpback deformity of 37 scaphoids using longitudinal computed tomography was assessed. The 3 measuring techniques were the lateral intrascaphoid angle, the dorsal cortical angle, and the height-to-length ratio. The intraobserver reliability of the intrascaphoid angle was poor; the dorsal cortical angle was moderate to excellent, and the height-to-length ratio was excellent. The interobserver reliability of the intrascaphoid angle was poor to moderate, the dorsal cortical angle was moderate to excellent, and the height-to-length ratio was moderate to excellent. For all 3 observers, the intra- and interobserver reliability was the best for the height-to-length ratio and worst for the intrascaphoid angle. The height-to-length ratio is the most reproducible method of assessing the humpback deformity. Clinical correlation is required to establish whether the height-to-length ratio will be of value in predicting the outcome of fractures of the scaphoid."

The first case was in a 13-year-old boy who presented a transverse midscaphoid fracture associated with a Salter type II distal radial fracture. The second concerned a 10-year-old boy who presented a bilateral wrist injury. On the left side, a distal forearm fracture with anterior displacement was associated with a transverse midscaphoid fracture. On the right side, there was only a distal forearm fracture. Scaphoid fracture associated with distal radial fracture seems to have been more frequently reported in the literature during the last decade, probably because it is more frequently recognised. In fact, children with distal forearm injury should be well examined both clinically and radiologically in order to search for an associated scaphoid fracture. Reduction of the radius fracture should be done carefully to avoid possible displacement of the scaphoid fracture."

The following recommendations are based on the literature, although scientific evidence to support treatment strategies is scarce. The diagnosis of scaphoid fractures is often missed on initial X-rays. Therefore all suspected fractures should be treated with a thumb spica cast for 2 weeks, followed by clinical examination and repeat X-ray if symptoms persist. In cases of negative X-ray findings an MRI or alternatively a CT scan are indicated. None or minimally displaced paediatric scaphoid fractures should be treated in a spica cast for at least 7 weeks until union is documented. Unlike in adults, evidence has not been provided for a benefit of routine surgical therapy. Late presenting non-unions that have not yet been treated adequately warrant a trial of conservative therapy, because healing can be expected under prolonged immobilisation. Surgical treatment should be reserved for dislocated fractures, established pseudarthroses that have not united under adequate conservative treatment or for patients to whom prolonged immobilisation does not appear to be acceptable."

The disphosphonate uptake in bone requires the preservation of bone vascularity and reflects osteoblastic activity; it allows studying the viability of bone. Using data from the literature and our experience, we tried to take stock of its main uses in routine emphasizing the study of vascular and describe its use in fractures of the scaphoid and in the study of vascularised bone transfers. If the value of scintigraphy is well known, the use made by means of pinhole collimator and the market entry of new and more sensitive detectors with better resolution could allow the side of the imaging anatomy of improving the study of the vascularisation of small bone transfers which are increasingly used, particularly at wrist and hand."

Secondary effects may include perforations and tears of the triangular fibrocartilage complex, cartilage wear of the proximal surface of lunate and triquetrum and tears of the lunotriquetral ligament. Positive ulnar variance may be evident on X-rays but a prominent ulnar head cannot always be excluded when there is neutral ulnar variance and further investigations, such as an arthroCTscan or arthroscopy, may be necessary. The two principle treatment options are (a) resection of the distal ulna (Darrach's and Sauvé-Kapandji's techniques are commonly used) and (b) techniques preserving the ulnar head, including different modalities of shortening osteotomy. The aim is to regain a congruent distal radioulnar joint, restore painless and normal pronosupination and prevent onset of osteoarthritis of this joint."

Some carpal bone cysts are symptomatic and then they are revealed on routine X-ray investigation. We present a case of 14 years old boy, in whom a scaphoid bone cyst developed around the foreign body (a splinter), stacked into the wrist when he fell on the wooden board. Because of pain, swelling and reduction of active range of motion of the wrist occurred at the load of the hand and lasted 3 months, patient was given radiological examination which was negative, and eventually CT scanning revealed a scaphoid bone cyst. Patient underwent operation: curettage of the lesion followed by filling of the bone defect with prepared allogenic bone. Histopathological examination of the contents of the cyst showed presence of wood piece, surrounded with granulomatic tissue and necrotic trabecular bone. This suggested a splinter stacked in the wrist at the primary injury to be a cause of cyst formation. Surgery resulted in complete recovery in 6 months."

Forty-three were classed as undisplaced and 37 of these 43 were also classed as 'united'. All the 37 undisplaced and 'united' fractures united with up to 8 weeks' cast immobilisation, including 26 which were taken out of plaster at 4 weeks and mobilised. We conclude that scaphoid waist fractures which appear to be undisplaced and united on a week 4 CT scan will unite, and may not need to be immobilised in a plaster cast for more than 4 weeks. Such a treatment policy may reduce the period of disability and time off work associated with nonoperative treatment."

The indications were five fractures (type B3, Herbert classification), two delayed unions (type C) and 25 nonunions (type D1 to D3, Filan and Herbert classification). Six patients received no bone grafts, 19 received cancellous bone graft from the radius. An interpositional iliac crest bone graft was used in four, and a vascularized bone graft from the distal radius in three cases respectively. The average postoperative immobilisation in a forearm splint was nine weeks. 26 patients could be recruited for clinical follow-up at an average of 14.5 months. The radiological results were assessed in 30 cases (94%). Bony consolidation was achieved in 26 cases (100% of the fractures, 84% of the nonunions). In three cases a loosening of the screw, and in three further cases a dislocation into the radiocarpal joint were observed. A humpback deformity was present in four cases. Three patients showed a persisting nonunion, one patient a fibrous union. Early degenerative changes of the radiocarpal joint were observed in six cases. The clinical follow up examination showed an average grip strength of 91% (JAMAR II), 94% for the three finger, and 95% for the pinch grip compared to the contralateral side. The mean postoperative pain score on the visual analog scale was one for resting conditions, eleven for motion and 33 under stress. The range of motion was 79% of the opposite side for extension/flexion and 83% for radial/ulnar deviation. The average DASH-score reached 15 points.

CD010023,0,18656779,0,Treatment of scaphoid fractures and nonunions.,"Scaphoid fractures are common but present unique challenges because of the particular geometry of the fractures and the tenuous vascular pattern of the scaphoid. Delays in diagnosis and inadequate treatment for acute scaphoid fractures can lead to nonunions and subsequent degenerative wrist arthritis. Improvements in diagnosis, surgical treatment, and implant materials have encouraged a trend toward early internal fixation, even for nondisplaced scaphoid fractures that could potentially be treated nonoperatively. Despite the advent of newly developed fixation techniques, including open and percutaneous fixation, the nonunion rate for scaphoid fractures remains as high as 10% after surgical treatment. Scaphoid nonunions can present with or without avascular necrosis of the proximal pole and may show a humpback deformity on the radiograph. If left untreated, scaphoid nonunions can progress to carpal collapse and degenerative arthritis. Surgical treatment is directed at correcting the deformity with open reduction and internal fixation with bone grafting. Recently, vascularized bone grafts have gained popularity in the treatment of scaphoid nonunions, particularly in cases with avascular necrosis. This article reviews current concepts regarding the treatment of scaphoid fractures and nonunions."

CD010023,0,19687072,0,Cost-effectiveness of MRI in managing suspected scaphoid fractures.,"In a cost-effectiveness study, we compared a treatment algorithm using repeated radiological examination with an algorithm using subacute MRI in patients with clinical signs of scaphoid fracture but normal initial radiography. Twenty-seven patients were included in both groups, and MRI reduced the immobilisation time from 20 days (range, 6-54) to 4 days (range, 1-19) and sick leave from 27 days (1-92) to 11 days (0-28). Use of MRI increased hospital costs by 151 euro (P<0.05), but reduced non-hospital costs by 2869 euro (P<0.05), making MRI cost-effective in the treatment of suspected scaphoid fractures."
CD010023,0,15085478,0,Imaging of athletic wrist and hand injuries.,"Sports-related injuries of the wrist and hand are commonly encountered in clinical practice. Athletic injuries create special challenges for the orthopedic surgeon and radiologist, as these patients expect to recover quickly and return to the same athletic endeavors that caused their original injuries. A thorough understanding of the mechanism of injury and imaging findings are necessary for accurate diagnosis and effective therapy. This knowledge allows the clinician to effectively educate the athlete concerning the risks, complications, and prognosis of the injury and its treatment. This article will review mechanisms of injury, imaging findings, and some therapeutic options of common sports-related injuries to the wrist and hand."
CD010023,0,18936035,0,"Multidetector CT of carpal injuries: anatomy, fractures, and fracture-dislocations.","Fractures and dislocations of the carpal bones are more common in young active patients. These injuries can lead to pain, dysfunction, and loss of productivity. Conventional radiography remains the primary imaging modality for evaluation of suspected carpal fractures and dislocations. However, multidetector computed tomography (CT) is playing an increasingly important role, especially in the following situations: (a) when results from initial radiographs are negative in patients with suspected carpal fractures, (b) when initial radiographic findings are indeterminate, and (c) when knowledge of the extent of carpal fractures or dislocations is required before surgical treatment. The advantages of multidetector CT include quick and accurate diagnosis with availability in most emergency centers. Multidetector CT can easily display the extent of carpal fractures and dislocations, often depicting fractures that are occult at radiography. In addition, with multiplanar (two-dimensional) and volumetric (three-dimensional) reformation, pathologic conditions and anatomic relationships are better perceived. This information can be easily conveyed to orthopedic and trauma surgeons and can be crucial for surgical treatment and planning."

CD010023,0,16865353,0,[Scaphoid fracture and nonunion: current status of radiological diagnostics].,"Scaphoid fractures, which involve approximately two-thirds of all wrist injuries, are often not detected during initial radiographic examination. By using high-resolution CT and dedicated MRI, it is possible to recognize scaphoid fractures soon at the first diagnostic approach and to assess fragment stability. CT imaging provides all the relevant information of the fracture extent and of the fracture healing in the follow-up. MRI is most sensitive in the detection of scaphoid fractures; however, fracture signs must be differentiated from those of a bone bruise. Both the initially overseen scaphoid fracture and the unsuccessful healing can lead to the natural history of scaphoid nonunion. In the injured scaphoid, CT imaging is essential for depicting the osseous morphology, whereas contrast-enhanced MRI is crucial for assessing the viability of the proximal fragment."
CD010023,0,7855505,0,[Dislocations of the carpal bones].,"Thirty per cent of the carpal dislocations are missed although a significant injury was sustained by the wrist. The extent of the ligamentous tears is relative to the magnitude of the forces applied and the anterior lunate dislocation corresponds to the more severe lesions. When a scaphoid fracture is associated, its treatment is predominant. Conservative treatment of a perilunate dislocation results very frequently in carpal instability and subsequently in wrist osteoarthritis after a variable period of time. Surgical treatment is now indicated in a great majority of cases, for reduction and fixation of a displaced scaphoid, or for ligament repairs."
CD010023,0,9283837,0,Imaging and staging of avascular osteonecroses at the wrist and hand.,"Avascular ostenecroses (AVN) are unspecific focal sceletal lesions of vascular origin. At the wrist, AVNs are mainly seen in the lunate (Kienbock's disease) and the proximal scaphoid fragment in the presence of a nonunion disease (pseudarthrosis). Other types of osteonecroses are rare. The natural process of devitalization proceeds in steps: initially, there is a bone marrow oedema, followed by trabecula sclerosis, cystic transformation of the spongiosa, and bone fragmentation. End stages include carpal collapse (SLAC wrist) and osteoarthritis. For imaging of the sceletal morphology in AVN computed tomography is most useful, whereas initial stages and perfusion damages are better detected with contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In this paper a staging classification for Kienböck's disease and the scaphoid nonunion, considering the diagnostic and therapeutic consequences, is presented."
CD010023,0,20728395,0,"[Use of the induced membrane technique for the treatment of bone defects in the hand or wrist, in emergency].","A prospective study is reported concerning 11 cases of bone defect of the hand and wrist treated by the induced membrane technique. Ten men and one woman with an average age of 49 yrs (17-72) sustained a high-energy trauma with severe mutilation of digit and hand but with intact pulp. Eight cases of open finger fractures with composite loss of substance and three cases of bone and joint infection (thumb, wrist, fifth finger) were included. All cases were treated by the induced membrane technique which consists in stable fixation, flap if necessary, and in filling the bone defect by a cement methyl methacrylate polymere (PMMA) spacer. A secondary procedure at two months is needed where the cement is removed and the void is filled by cancellous bone. The key point of this induced membrane technique is to respect the foreign body membrane which formed around the cement spacer creating a biologic chamber. Bone union was evaluated prospectively by X-ray and CT scan by a surgeon not involved in the treatment. Failure was defined as non-union at one year, or uncontrolled sepsis at one month. Two cases failed to achieve bone union. No septic complications occurred and all septic cases were controlled. In nine cases, bone union was achieved within four months (three to 12). Evidence of osteoid formation was determined by a bone biopsy in one case. Masquelet first reported 35 cases of large tibial non-union defects treated by the induced membrane technique. The cement spacer promotes foreign body membrane induction constituting a biological chamber. Works on animal models reported by Pellissier and Viateau demonstrated membrane properties: secretion of growths factors (VEGF, TGF beta1, BMP2) and osteoinductive cellular activity. The induced membrane seems to mimic a neoperiosteum. This technique is useful in emergency or septic conditions where bone defects cannot be treated by shortening. It avoids microsurgery and is limited by availability of cancellous bone."
CD010023,0,10584943,0,Scaphoid nonunion and flexor pollicis longus tendon rupture.,Four patients presented with a rupture of the flexor pollicis longus tendon that was associated with a longstanding scaphoid nonunion. A radiocarpal arthrosis was present in 3 of the 4 patients and a dorsiflexed intercalated segment instability deformity was also seen in 3 of the 4 patients. Three patients underwent surgery consisting of an osteosynthesis with an iliac bone graft for the scaphoid nonunion and a palmaris longus tendon graft for the ruptured flexor pollicis longus tendon. An osseous union of the scaphoid and a functional active range of motion of the thumb interphalangeal joint (33 degrees on average) was attained in all 3 of the patients treated surgically. Preoperative radiologic examinations and intraoperative findings suggest that the volarly protruding distal scaphoid segment is the cause of the rupture.
CD010023,0,10584942,0,Retrograde compression screw fixation of acute proximal pole scaphoid fractures.,"Seventeen consecutive patients with acute unstable proximal pole scaphoid fractures were managed over the past 5 years with open reduction and internal fixation. Four fractures were displaced, with greater than 1 mm of fragment offset and intercarpal malalignment. The operative technique consisted of a dorsal approach to the scaphoid, radius bone grafting, and freehand retrograde Herbert compression screw fixation. The patients were evaluated at an average of 37 months (range, 12-63 months) after surgery. All fractures healed within 13 weeks (average, 10 weeks). Functional wrist range of motion and grip strength were achieved in all patients. No patients developed osteonecrosis or radioscaphoid arthritis. Open reduction and internal fixation rather than primary casting is a better means of reducing the complications of delayed union, nonunion, and irreparable osteonecrosis that often occur after acute proximal pole scaphoid fracture treated with cast immobilization."

Some cysts were found to develop very slowly from an area of trabecular fading to a well-defined cavity, bordered by a zone of radiopacity. Pain was constantly correlated to cysts with marginal sclerosis and at operation these cysts were found to be made up of fibrous tissue with mucoid changes. Most cysts were located in the scaphoid and lunate which are known to have vulnerable vascular supplies. These bones are also exposed to heavy load during power grip. It is, therefore, plausible that these cysts are caused by intramedullary vascular disturbances, followed by bone resorption and fibroblastic proliferation, and that pain is elicited by increasing pressure inside the cyst."
CD010023,0,10588471,0,Magnetic resonance imaging of the humpback scaphoid: the technique and a mathematical performance evaluation.,Surgical treatment of scaphoid nonunion and malunion with excessive intrascaphoid angulation (humpback deformity) usually involves a bone graft that is intended to correct the deformity. The volar bone graft length determines the degree of angular correction and scaphoid elongation. It is recommended that the length of the graft be determined by careful preoperative measurement of the deformity. Previous imaging techniques are inherently limited. The present paper describes a technique using three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging. Scaphoid fracture angulation is calculated from measurements of comparable sagittal slices of the patient's fractured and normal scaphoid. Optimal bone graft length is determined by using simple trigonometric principles. Magnetic resonance imaging provides additional important information regarding vascularity of the proximal pole and the status of the periscaphoid ligaments and hyaline cartilage. Mathematical performance evaluation indicates that this technique is a promising method for planning reconstructive surgery of the scaphoid.
CD010023,0,17009819,0,Development of a clinical decision tool for suspected scaphoid fractures.,"Scaphoid fractures are the most common carpal fractures; their overall incidence is however low. Missing a scaphoid fracture may lead to a non-union with a possible disastrous outcome for the patient; for this reason, treatment of a suspected scaphoid fracture, even without a proven fracture on the first radiograph, has been conservative with plaster treatment. There are many clinical tests developed to diagnose a scaphoid fracture. However not all tests are equally practical, and their sensitivity and specificity are not always known, or are very low. In this study 18 clinical tests were evaluated and a subset of 7 tests remained, which were found to be practical and/or had a high enough sensitivity. A clinical decision protocol was developed using a combination of these seven tests, in order to improve diagnostic accuracy and at the same time reduce unnecessary plaster cast treatment of patients with a suspected scaphoid, who turn out to only have a sprained wrist."

A comparison of two vascularized bone grafts.,"Surgically, it is difficult to achieve union of a scaphoid nonunion that is associated with osteonecrosis of the proximal pole, and those with carpal collapse are especially difficult to treat. A variety of vascularized bone grafts can be used. The purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness of two types of vascularized bone graft--a distal radial pedicle graft and a free vascularized medial femoral condyle graft--in the treatment of scaphoid waist nonunions associated with proximal pole osteonecrosis and carpal collapse."

CD010023,0,7067295,0,Giant cell tumor associated with trauma.,"Presented is a case report of a 19-year-old man who developed a giant cell tumor in the distal ulna following trauma to the carpus. Roentgenograms and bone scan revealed a fracture of the scaphoid and no other bony abnormalities. On year later, after the scaphoid fracture had healed, the same investigations demonstrated a giant cell tumor of the distal ulna. Circumstantial evidence suggests a possible role for trauma in the pathogenesis of giant cell tumor."
CD010023,0,8982925,0,Scaphoid osteochondroma mimicking carpal coalition.,"We present the case of a 10-year-old girl who presented with a block to wrist abduction.

This was resected and histology showed it to be an osteochondroma."
CD010023,0,3726128,0,The wrist: a preliminary report on high-resolution MR imaging.,"Excellent spatial resolution is required to demonstrate the complex region of the wrist, with its diverse structures comprising bone, cartilage, and ligaments. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging was done with a Magnetom imaging system operating at 1.0 T. Use of a flat surface coil enabled excellent spatial resolution and a section thickness of 4 mm. Twenty-nine patients with navicular nonunion or pseudarthrosis, rheumatoid arthritis, recent fractures, soft-tissue alterations, and bone tumors were examined. All patients had undergone radiography and bone scintigraphy. In this limited sampling, MR was found to detect and characterize marrow and articular alterations more accurately, and earlier, than either of those modalities."
CD010023,0,15781361,0,Acute coronal plane scaphoid fracture and scapholunate dissociation from an axial load: a case report.,"Coronal fractures of the scaphoid are rare and can be difficult to diagnose. Axial load injuries that result in a complete coronal fracture of the scaphoid associated with an acute scapholunate dissociation are exceedingly rare. In our patient the radiographic finding of wide scapholunate dissociation was obvious; however, the coronal scaphoid fracture was not recognized initially nor suspected. During surgery the coronal scaphoid fracture was identified, reduced anatomically, and fixed with a compression screw. The scapholunate ligament also was repaired. A good result was obtained with return to sports with extension of 60 degrees and flexion of 70 degrees , grip strength equal to that of the uninjured wrist, and no radiographic problems (arthrosis, avascular necrosis, nonunion)."

CD010023,0,1629558,0,Computerized tomographic evaluation of acute distal radial fractures.,"To learn whether computerized tomography offered additional useful information over conventional radiographic evaluation of acute distal radial fractures in the younger adult, we scanned 22 consecutive injured wrists. Of the distal radial fractures in 19 wrists, sixteen were defined on plain films as intra-articular. In contrast, computerized tomography demonstrated that all fractures of the distal radius had intra-articular extension. In 3 wrists interpreted as being normal on plain films, despite clinical suspicion of a fracture, fractures were confirmed by computerized tomography. As a result of computerized tomography, injuries were assigned a higher Frykman value in 5 cases, and consideration of alternative patient management became necessary in 5 of the 22 patients."
CD010023,0,1861032,0,Analysis of scaphoid fracture displacement by three-dimensional computed tomography.,"Scaphoid fracture displacement was studied in twenty-five patients using three-dimensional computed tomography. Fracture displacement was more readily detected and distinct in three-dimensional computed tomography images than in plain radiography. Two different types of offset of the distal fragment with respect to the proximal fragment are described on three dimensional computed tomography; volar type and dorsal type. In the volar type, the distal fragment overhung in the volar direction relative to the proximal fragment and was frequently accompanied by humpback deformity and axial rotation. In the dorsal type, the distal fragment slipped dorsal on the proximal fragment and was commonly accompanied by humpback deformity. The volar type had a transverse or vertical fracture line on both the volar and dorsal surfaces of the scaphoid, while the dorsal type had a horizontal fracture line. The volar type was frequently found when the fracture was distal, whereas the dorsal type was noted more frequently for proximally located fracture."

Initial examples of fracture diagnosis of peripheral joints in comparison with spiral CT and conventional radiography].,"To analyze a prototype mobile C-arm image amplifier (Iso-C3D) in the evaluation of different joint fractures of the upper and lower limbs using multiplanar reconstruction (MPR). Different cadaver joint specimens (n = 14) were examined with a prototype (Iso-C3D, Siemens AG, Erlangen, Germany), plain radiographs (CR), and spiral computed tomography (CT). The motorized C-arm provides fluoroscopic images during a 190 degrees orbital rotation computing a 119-mm data cube. These three-dimensional data sets yielded MPR images, which were evaluated by two readers for the detection and extent of fracture lines. Initial data show that fractures were easily depicted and correctly classified on MPR images with the Iso-C3D and that there was no difference between the Iso-C and CT in the detection of fractures. The preliminary results suggest a remarkably good detection of joint fractures with the Iso-C3D. Studies in an adequate number of patients are required to elucidate whether these promising results can also be obtained in a clinical setting."

Patients' age, history of previous wrist fracture, presence of MRI signs and ulnar variance were recorded as variables. Also, patients' postoperative strength (compared to the contralateral wrist) and pain relief were collected as outcome measurements. Twenty-two patients (84.6%) had either good or excellent pain relief (median 4, range 1-4). Significant correlation was found between MRI findings and postop pain relief (r = 0.53, p < or = 0.01). History of previous distal radius fractures was negatively correlated with pain relief (r = -0.50, p < or = 0.01). No correlation was found between postop strength and any of the variables. Presence of MRI signs of UIS is a predictor of good outcome in arthroscopic wafer resection."

CD010023,0,8452713,0,Wrist arthrography.,The ligaments of the proximal row of carpal bones and the triangular fibrocartilage (TFC) strongly influence the function and stability of the wrist. Injury to the ligaments may result in chronic wrist pain or instability. Wrist arthrography is valuable in the investigation of such damage when surgical intervention is considered and plain radiography is unrewarding. There are also several technical modifications of the standard radiocarpal arthrography available. Owing to the possibility of congenital perforations and degenerative changes in these ligaments the arthrographic findings should be related to the clinical signs and the age of the patient. CT has less diagnostic importance in this respect while MR imaging is an alternative and may become the method of choice. Both these methods have great potential in the evaluation of soft tissues of the wrist other than the TFC.
