CD012120,0,17917110,0,Exercise-induced neuroprotection in SMA model mice: a means for determining new therapeutic strategies.,"Due to the prevalence of neuromuscular disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and spinal muscular atrophy in modern societies, defining new and efficient strategies for the treatment of these two neurodegenerative diseases has become a vital and still unfulfilled urge. Several lines of experimental evidence have emphasized the benefits of regular exercise training in mouse models for these affections in terms of life span increase and improvement of both motor capacities and motoneuron survival. Identifying molecules that could mimic the neuroprotective effects of exercise represents a promising way to find novel therapies. Some of the effects of exercise are caused by the overproduction of circulating neurotrophic factors, such as IGF-I, whereas others may be due to modifications of the intrinsic properties of the motoneurons within the spinal cord. The causal relationship that links these potential effects of exercise training and the improvement of motor capacity and life span expectancy is consequently discussed."
CD012120,0,3655841,0,Myoadenylate deaminase deficiency: absence of correlation with exercise intolerance in 452 muscle biopsies.,"A histochemical assay was routinely performed of myoadenylate deaminase (MAD) in muscle biopsy specimens. MAD was absent in 13 cases, i.e. 2.9% of the specimens. In 10 cases the deficiency was confirmed biochemically. The diagnoses in the 13 patients were: polyneuropathy (n = 5), infantile spinal muscular atrophy (n = 3), congenital myopathy with type 2 fibre atrophy, facioscapulohumeral myopathy, polymyositis, myotonic dystrophy and hyperornithinaemia with gyrate atrophy of the retina. In contrast, 35 unrelated patients presenting with exercise-related muscle cramps or pains showed normal histochemical MAD activity. The biopsy specimens in all of these patients were essentially normal and in none of them was the diagnosis of a neuromuscular disease made. The results failed to confirm the association of MAD deficiency with aches, cramps and pains or exertional myalgia."
CD012120,0,27379813,0,Resistance exercise training in patients with genitourinary cancers to mitigate treatment-related skeletal muscle loss.,"The use of targeted therapies in patients with genitourinary malignancies has significantly improved outcomes. For example, androgen receptor (AR) pathway inhibitors have improved outcomes for patients with prostate cancer, and antiangiogenic agents have improved outcomes for those with kidney cancer. However, these advances have been accompanied by musculoskeletal side effects that manifest as physical dysfunction. Although the effects of androgen deprivation therapy on skeletal muscle are well-known, an additional concern is that the muscle loss associated with these newer drugs-especially AR pathway inhibitors-may result in insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome, thus increasing the risk for cardiovascular events and diabetes. Antiangiogenic agents also may cause muscle loss, although this has been poorly described in the literature. As these targeted therapies begin to be used in the earlier stages of treatment, there will be a critical need to prevent treatment-related toxicities with nonpharmacologic interventions. Over the past decade, exercise training has emerged as a novel nonpharmacologic adjunctive method to address toxicities resulting from these targeted therapies. Despite numerous studies in patients with prostate cancer, there remains a large gap in our knowledge of the true efficacy of exercise therapy, as well as the best way to prescribe exercise programs. Here, we suggest that the central role of skeletal muscle in the development of side effects of AR pathway inhibitors and antiangiogenic agents may unlock a number of unique opportunities to study how exercise prescriptions can be used more effectively. Resistance training may be a particularly important modality."
CD012120,0,26582176,0,Chronic Treatment with the AMPK Agonist AICAR Prevents Skeletal Muscle Pathology but Fails to Improve Clinical Outcome in a Mouse Model of Severe Spinal Muscular Atrophy.,"Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a genetic neuromuscular disorder characterized by spinal and brainstem motor neuron (MN) loss and skeletal muscle paralysis. Currently, there is no effective treatment other than supportive care to ameliorate the quality of life of patients with SMA. Some studies have reported that physical exercise, by improving muscle strength and motor function, is potentially beneficial in SMA. The adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase agonist 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-β-D-ribofuranoside (AICAR) has been reported to be an exercise mimetic agent that is able to regulate muscle metabolism and increase endurance both at rest and during exercise. Chronic AICAR administration has been shown to ameliorate the dystrophic muscle phenotype and motor behavior in the mdx mouse, a model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Here, we investigated whether chronic AICAR treatment was able to elicit beneficial effects on motor abilities and neuromuscular histopathology in a mouse model of severe SMA (the SMNΔ7 mouse). We report that AICAR improved skeletal muscle atrophy and structural changes found in neuromuscular junctions of SMNΔ7 animals. However, although AICAR prevented the loss of glutamatergic excitatory synapses on MNs, this compound was not able to mitigate MN loss or the microglial and astroglial reaction occurring in the spinal cord of diseased mice. Moreover, no improvement in survival or motor performance was seen in SMNΔ7 animals treated with AICAR. The beneficial effects of AICAR in SMA found in our study are SMN-independent, as no changes in the expression of this protein were seen in the spinal cord and skeletal muscle of diseased animals treated with this compound."
CD012120,0,23220836,0,Brachial amyotrophic diplegia in the setting of complete HIV viral load suppression.,"Brachial amyotrophic diplegia (BAD) is a rare segmental form of motor neuron disease which presents with asymmetric lower motor neuron weakness largely confined to the upper extremities (UE). In the case being reported, a 62-year-old gentleman on antiretroviral treatment since 1993, presented with left-arm weakness in 2007 that quickly progressed to involve the right arm. Complete HIV-viral load suppression had been achieved since 2003. Examination revealed lower motor neuron weakness in both UEs, worse proximally than distally and normal strength in the lower extremities (LEs). Nerve conduction studies showed reduced amplitudes of bilateral median and ulnar nerves' motor responses. Needle electromyography of bilateral UE showed active and chronic denervation/reinnervation changes with normal findings in both LEs. MRI of the cervical spine showed cord atrophy. This is the first case report describing a patient who presented with BAD in the setting of complete HIV-viral load suppression for many years."

Typical clinical symptoms include muscle weakness, muscle flaccidity, pareses, and partial or total loss of reflexes. Excessive intensity of these symptoms leads i.a. to motor dysfunctions and ultimately to problems with physical development of children and youth. Treatment of such conditions is based on physiotherapy. The aim of this article is to expose the growing problem of dysphagia in patients with neuromuscular diseases and to systematize therapeutic activities during the process of rehabilitation."

CD012120,0,8857729,0,Function changes in spinal muscular atrophy II and III. The DCN/SMA Group.,"The course of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is not well established except for those patients whose age of onset is before 6 months and who achieve only ""sit with support"" as their maximum function (Werdnig-Hoffmann disease or SMA I). This study shows that there is another group of SMA patients whose age of onset and maximum function achieved can be used as prognostic guides. Fifty percent of SMA patients who could walk without assistance and whose onset was prior to age 2 years lost the ability to walk independently by age 12. Fifty percent of SMA patients who walked and whose onset was between 2 and 6 years of age lost walking ability by age 44 years. Fifty percent of SMA patients who could walk with assistance as their best function ever achieved lost this ability by age 7 years, unrelated to age of onset; none could walk with assistance after age 14 years. Seventy-five percent of SMA patients who developed the ability to sit independently as their best function were still sitting after age 7 years independent of age of onset; 50% of this group could sit independently after age 14 years. Eighty-five percent of SMA patients who could walk could not negotiate stairs without holding onto a rail. They could raise their hands above the head; however, as they lost walking ability, they lost this function as well. Only one SMA patient whose maximum function was sitting independently could get to the sitting position on his own. Only two of these patients could hold their hands above their heads. All patients with SMA lose function over time. This function loss occurs slowly and is related primarily to maximum function achieved; knowledge of age of onset provides helpful information, especially for predicting the loss of independent walking."

CD012120,0,22930275,0,Physical exercise reduces cardiac defects in type 2 spinal muscular atrophy-like mice.,"Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), the leading genetic cause of death in infants worldwide, is due to the misexpression of the survival of motor neuron protein, causing death of motor neurons. Several clinical symptoms suggested that, in addition to motor neurons, the autonomic nervous systems could be implicated in the cardiac function alterations observed in patienst with SMA. These alterations were also found in a severe SMA mouse model, including bradycardia and a reduction of sympathetic innervation, both associated with autonomic imbalance. In the present study, we investigate the extent of autonomic dysfunction and the effects of a running-based exercise on the altered cardiorespiratory function in type 2 SMA-like mice. We observed that the SMA induced: (1) a dramatic alteration of intrinsic cardiac conduction associated with bradycardia; (2) a severe cardiomyopathy associated with extensive ventricular fibrosis; and (3) a delay in cardiac muscle maturation associated with contractile protein expression defects. Furthermore, our data indicate that the sympathetic system is not only functioning, but also likely contributes to alleviate the bradycardia and the arrhythmia in SMA-like mice. Moreover, physical exercise provides many benefits, including the reduction of cardiac protein expression defect, the reduction of fibrosis, the increase in cardiac electrical conduction velocity, and the drastic reduction in bradycardia and arrhythmias resulting in the partial restoration of the cardiac function in these mice. Thus, modulating the cardiorespiratory function in SMA could represent a new target for improving supportive care and for developing new pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions that would most certainly include physical exercise."

CD012120,0,21499714,0,Tetanic contractions impair sarcomeric Z-disk of atrophic soleus muscle via calpain pathway.,"The aim of this study was to determine whether or not over-activation of calpains during running exercise or tetanic contractions was a major factor to induce sarcomere lesions in atrophic soleus muscle. Relationship between the degrees of desmin degradation and sarcomere lesions was also elucidated. We observed ultrastructural changes in soleus muscle fibers after 4-week unloading with or without running exercise. Calpain activity and desmin degradation were measured in atrophic soleus muscles before or after repeated tetani in vitro. Calpain-1 activity was progressively increased and desmin degradation was correspondingly elevated in 1-, 2-, and 4-week of unloaded soleus muscles. Calpain-1 activity and desmin degradation had an additional increase in unloaded soleus muscles after repeated tetani in vitro. PD150606, an inhibitor of calpains, reduced calpain activity and desmin degradation during tetanic contractions in unloaded soleus muscles. The 4-week unloading decreased the width of myofibrils and Z-disk in soleus fibers. After running exercise in unloaded group, Z-disks of adjacent myofibrils were not well in register but instead were longitudinally displaced. Calpain inhibition compromised exercise-induced misalignment of the Z-disks in atrophic soleus muscle. These results suggest that tetanic contractions induce an over-activation of calpains which lead to higher degrees of desmin degradation in unloaded soleus muscle. Desmin degradation may loose connections between adjacent myofibrils, whereas running exercise results in sarcomere injury in unloaded soleus muscle."
CD012120,0,26924529,0,Mutations in Subunits of the Activating Signal Cointegrator 1 Complex Are Associated with Prenatal Spinal Muscular Atrophy and Congenital Bone Fractures.,"Transcriptional signal cointegrators associate with transcription factors or nuclear receptors and coregulate tissue-specific gene transcription. We report on recessive loss-of-function mutations in two genes (TRIP4 and ASCC1) that encode subunits of the nuclear activating signal cointegrator 1 (ASC-1) complex. We used autozygosity mapping and whole-exome sequencing to search for pathogenic mutations in four families. Affected individuals presented with prenatal-onset spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), multiple congenital contractures (arthrogryposis multiplex congenita), respiratory distress, and congenital bone fractures. We identified homozygous and compound-heterozygous nonsense and frameshift TRIP4 and ASCC1 mutations that led to a truncation or the entire absence of the respective proteins and cosegregated with the disease phenotype. Trip4 and Ascc1 have identical expression patterns in 17.5-day-old mouse embryos with high expression levels in the spinal cord, brain, paraspinal ganglia, thyroid, and submandibular glands. Antisense morpholino-mediated knockdown of either trip4 or ascc1 in zebrafish disrupted the highly patterned and coordinated process of α-motoneuron outgrowth and formation of myotomes and neuromuscular junctions and led to a swimming defect in the larvae. Immunoprecipitation of the ASC-1 complex consistently copurified cysteine and glycine rich protein 1 (CSRP1), a transcriptional cofactor, which is known to be involved in spinal cord regeneration upon injury in adult zebrafish. ASCC1 mutant fibroblasts downregulated genes associated with neurogenesis, neuronal migration, and pathfinding (SERPINF1, DAB1, SEMA3D, SEMA3A), as well as with bone development (TNFRSF11B, RASSF2, STC1). Our findings indicate that the dysfunction of a transcriptional coactivator complex can result in a clinical syndrome affecting the neuromuscular system."
CD012120,0,22496553,0,Survival motor neuron affects plastin 3 protein levels leading to motor defects.,"The actin-binding protein plastin 3 (PLS3) has been identified as a modifier of the human motoneuron disease spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). SMA is caused by decreased levels of the survival motor neuron protein (SMN) and in its most severe form causes death in infants and young children. To understand the mechanism of PLS3 in SMA, we have analyzed pls3 RNA and protein in zebrafish smn mutants. We show that Pls3 protein levels are severely decreased in smn(-/-) mutants without a reduction in pls3 mRNA levels. Moreover, we show that both pls3 mRNA and protein stability are unaffected when Smn is reduced. This indicates that SMN affects PLS3 protein production. We had previously shown that, in smn mutants, the presynaptic protein SV2 is decreased at neuromuscular junctions. Transgenically driving human PLS3 in motoneurons rescues the decrease in SV2 expression. To determine whether PLS3 could also rescue function, we performed behavioral analysis on smn mutants and found that they had a significant decrease in spontaneous swimming and turning. Driving PLS3 transgenically in motoneurons rescued both of these defects. These data show that PLS3 protein levels are dependent on SMN and that PLS3 is able to rescue the neuromuscular defects and corresponding movement phenotypes caused by low levels of Smn suggesting that decreased PLS3 contributes to SMA motor phenotypes."
CD012120,0,18642379,0,Walking capacity evaluated by the 6-minute walk test in spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy.,"Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is an adult-onset motor neuron disease caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the androgen receptor gene. Because the progression of SBMA is slow, it is plausible to identify biomarkers that monitor disease course for therapeutic development. To verify whether the 6-min walk test (6MWT) is a biomarker of SBMA, we performed the 6MWT in 35 genetically confirmed patients and in 29 age-matched healthy controls. The walk distance covered within 6 min (6MWD) was significantly less in SBMA than it was in controls (323.3 +/- 143.9 m and 637.6 +/- 94.2 m, respectively; P < 0.001). In test-retest analysis, the intraclass correlation coefficient for the 6MWD was high in SBMA patients (r = 0.982). In a 1-year follow-up the 6MWD significantly decreased at a rate of 11.3% per year. Our observations suggest that the 6MWT is a biomarker that can be used to monitor progression of motor impairment in SBMA."

CD012120,0,7853021,0,Benign monomelic amyotrophy of lower limb: a rare entity with a characteristic muscular CT.,"Six patients presented with amyotrophy confined to a single lower limb and characterized by insidious onset, slow progression and later stabilization. Wasting was out of proportion with disability and there were no sensory, pyramidal tract or bulbar signs. All cases were sporadic, and there was no history of poliomyelitis. CK, anti-ganglioside antibodies, motor and sensory conductions were normal. Quantitative EMG and muscle biopsy revealed neurogenic features also in clinically unaffected limbs. Muscular CT showed selective or predominant, asymmetrical involvement of posterior leg muscles and caput longus of biceps femoris. Monomelic amyotrophy of lower limb is a clinically localized variant of spinal muscular atrophy with a particularly benign course. Although in the early stage there are no clinical or laboratory findings which allow differential diagnosis with other motor neuron diseases, the history of an amyotrophy clinically localized for more than 3 years to a lower single limb and the characteristic muscular CT pattern suggest the diagnosis since the first observation and indicate a favorable prognosis."
CD012120,0,3173043,1,The effects of strength training in patients with selected neuromuscular disorders.,"Five subjects with spinal muscular atrophy, limb-girdle or facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, were studied. Measurements pre- and post-training included: maximum isometric, dynamic and isokinetic strength, in single-arm curl and double-leg press exercises; contractile properties of the elbow flexors; computerized tomography of the upper arms and thighs; muscle biopsies from the biceps brachii muscle of each arm in three subjects. Dynamic weight training was performed 3 times per week for 9 wk; exercises comprised unilateral arm curls (the contralateral arm acted as a control), and bilateral leg press. Strength increases in the trained arm were between 19 and 34%, and from -14 to +25% in the control arm; leg strength increased from 11 to 50%. Moreover, the pretraining maximum load could be lifted from 3 to 48 times in the trained limbs, and from 1 to 13 times in an untrained limb before fatigue. Contractile properties of the elbow flexors were unchanged with training, but pre-intervention, three subjects demonstrated incomplete motor unit activation. Most of the gains in strength were apparently due to a neural adaptation, rather than muscle hypertrophy. The tomograms and biopsy samples were inadequate to determine muscle, or muscle fiber areas with confidence; they did indicate however, no additional overt muscle structural damage. Strength training may be a potentially useful therapeutic option in the management of selected neuromuscular disorders."
CD012120,0,22951156,0,Mechanisms responsible for disuse muscle atrophy: potential role of protein provision and exercise as countermeasures.,"Muscle disuse is often observed after injury or during periods of illness, resulting in the loss of muscle mass and strength, with sometimes debilitating consequences. Although substantial advancements have been made in determining the mechanisms responsible for the etiology of muscle disuse atrophy in rodents, only in recent years have studies of any significant number focused on reaffirming these findings in humans. In this review, we discuss the processes responsible for disuse atrophy as based on current evidence and highlight where gaps in our knowledge persist. Furthermore, given the emphasis placed on resistance exercise and nutrition as potential therapeutic countermeasures, we consider recent advancements in the study of resistance exercise and nutrition in the stimulation of muscle protein synthesis and the associated implications when devising effective treatment strategies."

CD012120,0,23994926,0,[Camptocormia in patients with Parkinson's disease].,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most frequent among a broad spectrum of neurologic etiologies of саmptocormia. Camptocormia (CC) is characterized by an abnormal posture with involuntary forward flexion of the trunk, which appears in erect position, increases during prolonged standing or walking, and abates in supine position. CC leads to malposition, increasing postural instability and risk of falling. Treatment of CC in PD includes adjustment of antiparkinsonian medication, injections of botulinum toxin and orthopedical interventions. In this study, CC occurred in sitting position in 62.9% patients and in vertical position in 30% patients, however it disappeared in all patients in a dorsal position. CC was observed throughout the day in 77.1% patients. In 78.6% of PD patients with CC, the pose changed and encouraged with the various factors including weariness and stress; 37.1% patients used a walking stick; 5.7% used a walking aid. CC was accompanied with the painful syndrome in the majority of patients (88.6%). Moreover, 66% of patients had a history of vertebrogenic disorders. The association between CC and the start of dopaminergic treatment was found in 25.7% of patients."

CD012120,0,25607844,0,Disrupting SUMOylation enhances transcriptional function and ameliorates polyglutamine androgen receptor-mediated disease.,"Expansion of the polyglutamine (polyQ) tract within the androgen receptor (AR) causes neuromuscular degeneration in individuals with spinobulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA). PolyQ AR has diminished transcriptional function and exhibits ligand-dependent proteotoxicity, features that have both been implicated in SBMA; however, the extent to which altered AR transcriptional function contributes to pathogenesis remains controversial. Here, we sought to dissociate effects of diminished AR function from polyQ-mediated proteotoxicity by enhancing the transcriptional activity of polyQ AR. To accomplish this, we bypassed the inhibitory effect of AR SUMOylation (where SUMO indicates small ubiquitin-like modifier) by mutating conserved lysines in the polyQ AR that are sites of SUMOylation. We determined that replacement of these residues by arginine enhances polyQ AR activity as a hormone-dependent transcriptional regulator. In a murine model, disruption of polyQ AR SUMOylation rescued exercise endurance and type I muscle fiber atrophy; it also prolonged survival. These changes occurred without overt alterations in polyQ AR expression or aggregation, revealing the favorable trophic support exerted by the ligand-activated receptor. Our findings demonstrate beneficial effects of enhancing the transcriptional function of the ligand-activated polyQ AR and indicate that the SUMOylation pathway may be a potential target for therapeutic intervention in SBMA."
CD012120,0,24929241,0,"Moderate intensity resistive exercise improves metaphyseal cancellous bone recovery following an initial disuse period, but does not mitigate decrements during a subsequent disuse period in adult rats.","Spaceflight provides a unique environment for skeletal tissue causing decrements in structural and densitometric properties of bone. Previously, we used the adult hindlimb unloaded (HU) rat model to show that previous exposure to HU had minimal effects on bone structure after a second HU exposure followed by recovery. Furthermore, we found that the decrements during second HU exposure were milder than the initial HU cycle. In this study, we used a moderate intensity resistance exercise protocol as an anabolic stimulus during recovery to test the hypothesis that resistance exercise following an exposure to HU will significantly enhance recovery of densitometric, structural, and, more importantly, mechanical properties of trabecular and cortical bone. We also hypothesized that resistance exercise during recovery, and prior to the second unloading period, will mitigate the losses during the second exposure. The hypothesis that exercise during recovery following hindlimb unloading will improve bone quality was supported by our data, as total BMC, total vBMD, and cancellous bone formation at the proximal tibia metaphysis increased significantly during exercise period, and total BMC/vBMD exceeded age-matched control and non-exercised values significantly by the end of recovery. However, our results did not support the hypothesis that resistance exercise prior to a subsequent unloading period will mitigate the detrimental effects of the second exposure, as the losses during the second exposure in total BMC, total vBMD, and cortical area at the proximal tibia metaphysis for the exercised animals were similar to those of the non-exercised group. Therefore, exercise did not mitigate effects of the second HU exposure in terms of pre-to-post HU changes in these variables, but it did produce beneficial effects in a broader sense."
CD012120,0,19171827,0,Effect of aerobic training in patients with spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (Kennedy disease).,"We examined the effect of aerobic exercise in patients with spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA).

This defect causes motor neuron death, but considering the important function of androgens in muscle, it is possible that muscle damage in SBMA also occurs independently of motor neuron damage."
CD012120,0,2279422,0,Hip dislocation in spinal muscular atrophy.,"Hip conditions in 49 patients affected with spinal muscular atrophy were studied: 35 of these were affected with the intermediate form of the disease (patients were able to sit but not walk), and 14 with the mild form (patients were able to walk). The Perkins method was used to measure the migration percentage of the femoral head. Thirty-one percent of the patients affected by the intermediate form of the disease had normal hips, 38% had unilateral or bilateral subluxation, 11% had hip dislocation. In the mild form of the disease, 50% of the patients had normal hips, 28% had unilateral or bilateral subluxation, and 22% had a hip dislocation. In the intermediate form of the disease there was a linear correlation between migration percentage and age, and between migration percentage and scoliosis. In the patients affected with the mild form of the disease who were able to walk, and in the patients affected with the intermediate form and fitted with orthoses who were able to stand, or to walk, there was no hip dislocation. Hence, walking with or without orthoses seems to be an important factor in preventing hip dislocation."
CD012120,0,26311784,0,IGF-1R Reduction Triggers Neuroprotective Signaling Pathways in Spinal Muscular Atrophy Mice.,"Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a neuromuscular disease characterized by the selective loss of spinal motor neurons due to the depletion of the survival of motor neuron (SMN) protein. No therapy is currently available for SMA, which represents the leading genetic cause of death in childhood. In the present study, we report that insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (Igf-1r) gene expression is enhanced in the spinal cords of SMA-like mice. The reduction of expression, either at the physiological (through physical exercise) or genetic level, resulted in the following: (1) a significant improvement in lifespan and motor behavior, (2) a significant motor neuron protection, and (3) an increase in SMN expression in spinal cord and skeletal muscles through both transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms. Furthermore, we have found that reducing IGF-1R expression is sufficient to restore intracellular signaling pathway activation profile lying downstream of IGF-1R, resulting in both the powerful activation of the neuroprotective AKT/CREB pathway and the inhibition of the ERK and JAK pathways. Therefore, reducing rather than enhancing the IGF-1 pathway could constitute a useful strategy to limit neurodegeneration in SMA."

CD012120,0,17980600,0,"Compensatory mechanisms during walking in response to muscle weakness in spinal muscular atrophy, type III.","Our knowledge on altered neurological control of walking due to weakness of various muscle groups of the lower extremities is limited. The aim of this study was to assess kinematic, kinetic and electromyographic (EMG) walking patterns in a functionally homogeneous group of seven subjects with spinal muscular atrophy, type III (SMA group) and compare them with normal data obtained from nine healthy subjects (CONTROL group) in order to identify characteristic compensatory changes. Muscle strength at the ankle and knee joints was assessed using isokinetic dynamometry to determine variability in muscle strength: this was found to be similar in the two groups. Kinematic, kinetic and EMG patterns were assessed during walking in the SMA and CONTROL groups. The results showed changes in the activity of ankle plantarflexors and associated control of the center of pressure during loading response and midstance, which facilitated minimization of the external flexion moment acting on the knee and hip in the SMA group. Additionally, we identified distinct and consistent changes in the control of hip rotators that act to rapidly extend the hip early in stance phase and in the control of contralateral hip abductors that act delay weight shift onto the leg entering the stance phase. From these results we can conclude that the most important muscle groups compensating for reduced strength in knee and hip muscles are the ankle plantarflexors, hip rotators and hip abductors. This finding would have direct application in rehabilitation treatment programs."

CD012120,0,22590551,0,"High-frequency, low-magnitude vibration does not prevent bone loss resulting from muscle disuse in mice following botulinum toxin injection.","High-frequency, low-magnitude vibration enhances bone formation ostensibly by mimicking normal postural muscle activity. We tested this hypothesis by examining whether daily exposure to low-magnitude vibration (VIB) would maintain bone in a muscle disuse model with botulinum toxin type A (BTX). Female 16-18 wk old BALB/c mice (N = 36) were assigned to BTX-VIB, BTX-SHAM, VIB, or SHAM. BTX mice were injected with BTX (20 µL; 1 U/100 g body mass) into the left hindlimb posterior musculature. All mice were anaesthetized for 20 min/d, 5 d/wk, for 3 wk, and the left leg mounted to a holder. Through the holder, VIB mice received 45 Hz, ± 0.6 g sinusoidal acceleration without weight bearing. SHAM mice received no vibration. At baseline and 3 wk, muscle cross-sectional area (MCSA) and tibial bone properties (epiphysis, metaphysis and diaphysis) were assessed by in vivo micro-CT. Bone volume fraction in the metaphysis decreased 12 ± 9% and 7 ± 6% in BTX-VIB and BTX-SHAM, but increased in the VIB and SHAM. There were no differences in dynamic histomorphometry outcomes between BTX-VIB and BTX nor between VIB and SHAM. Thus, vibration did not prevent bone loss induced by a rapid decline in muscle activity nor produce an anabolic effect in normal mice. The daily loading duration was shorter than would be expected from postural muscle activity, and may have been insufficient to prevent bone loss. Based on the approach used in this study, vibration does not prevent bone loss in the absence of muscle activity induced by BTX."
CD012120,0,28881009,0,Seeking a better landscape for therapy development in neuromuscular disorders.,"Although the neuromuscular field has seen accelerated approval of a drug for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and full approval of one for spinal muscular atrophy, these experiences have shown that objective data and an adequate level of effect are essential for drug approval and reimbursement. The appropriateness and validity of biomarkers and clinically meaningful endpoints and an understanding of disease progression rates all played essential roles in the levels of evidence for these drugs. Such tools are best developed through integration of clinical data. The siloing of clinical data for rare neuromuscular diseases represents a considerable barrier to achieving better care and novel therapies for patients living with neuromuscular diseases. We discuss a data-sharing model implemented for DMD and urge cultural changes in the ways natural history and clinical trial data are collected and shared across all neuromuscular diseases in order to benefit the primary stakeholder, the patient.

CD012120,0,12527313,0,Disuse and deconditioning in chronic low back pain: concepts and hypotheses on contributing mechanisms.,"For years enhancement of a patient's level of physical fitness has been an important goal in rehabilitation treatment in chronic low back pain (CLBP), based on the hypothesis that physical deconditioning contributes to the chronicity of low back pain. However, whether this hypothesis in CLBP holds is not clear. In this paper, possible mechanisms that contribute to the development of physical deconditioning in CLBP, such as avoidance behaviour and suppressive behaviour, are discussed. The presence of both deconditioning-related physiological changes, such as muscle atrophy, changes in metabolism, osteoporosis and obesity as well as deconditioning related functional changes, such as a decrease in cardiovascular capacity, a decrease in muscle strength and impaired motor control in patients with CLBP are discussed. Results of studies on the level of physical activities in daily life (PAL) and the level of physical fitness in patients with CLBP compared to healthy controls were reviewed. In studies on PAL results that were either lower or comparable to healthy subjects were found. The presence of disuse (i.e., a decrease in the level of physical activities in daily life) in patients with CLBP was not confirmed. The inconclusive findings in the papers reviewed may partly be explained by different measurement methods used in research on PAL in chronic pain. The level of physical fitness of CLBP patients also appeared to be lower or comparable to the fitness level of healthy persons. A discriminating factor between fit and unfit patients with back pain may be the fact that fit persons more frequently are still employed, and as such may be involved more in physical activity. Lastly some suggestions are made for further research in the field of disuse and deconditioning in CLBP."
CD012120,0,26789431,0,[Respiratory Muscle Training: State of the Art].,"Specific respiratory muscle training (IMT) improves the function of the inspiratory muscles. According to literature and clinical experience, there are 3 established methods: 1.) resistive load 2.) threshold load and 3.) normocapnic hyperpnea. Each training method and the associated devices have specific characteristics. Setting up an IMT should start with specific diagnostics of respiratory muscle function and be followed by detailed individual introduction to training. The aim of this review is to take a closer look at the different training methods for the most relevant indications and to discuss these results in the context of current literature. The group of neuromuscular diseases includes muscular dystrophy, spinal muscular atrophy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, paralysis of the phrenic nerve, and injuries to the spinal cord. Furthermore, interstitial lung diseases, sarcoidosis, left ventricular heart failure, pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), kyphoscoliosis and obesity are also discussed in this context. COPD, asthma, cystic fibrosis (CF) and non-CF-bronchiectasis are among the group of obstructive lung diseases. Last but not least, we summarize current knowledge on weaning from respirator in the context of physical activity."

A marked improvement was registered in 64%, and an insignificant improvement in 10.5% of the children. To determine the optimal therapeutic combination for one or another from the disease and its gravity the results obtained in children who received combinations to different balneofactors (radon or sulfur baths) were compared. As control, fresh-water baths were taken, the other factors of the therapeutic complex being equal. The time course of the clinical, biochemical, and electrophysiological findings has shown that is is quite expedient to treat children suffering from Kugelberg-Welander amyotrophy with sulfur and radon baths. As to children with initial forms of Duchenne's myopathy it was found preferable to treat them with sulfur waters. The treatment complex should include, besides the baths, therapeutic exercises, oxygen therapy, mud or ozokerite applications, as well as general roborant therapy."

At age 54, he noticed difficulty in running and weakness in the left thigh, which gradually progressed. On the first admission to our hospital, based on the nerve conduction studies (NCS), the muscle biopsy findings showing neurologenic changes, and no abnormality of spinal MRI, we diagnosed as unilateral quadriceps amyotrophy, which resulted from an atypical form of spinal progressive muscular atrophy. One year later, he showed the bilateral hand weakness, conduction blocks on the right median and ulnar nerves by NCS, and the presence of serum anti-GM 1 antibody. From these findings, Lewis-Sumner syndrome was diagnosed. The therapy of high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin moderately improved his symptoms. The clinical symptoms of quadriceps amyotrophy is produced by various disorders including spinal progressive muscular atrophy, spinal extradural arachnoid cyst, rimmed vacuole myopathy, Becker dystrophy, limb-girdle dystrophy, and focal myositis. However, there have been no reports of a case of Lewis-Sumner syndrome. It is important to consider Lewis-Sumner syndrome in the differential diagnosis of quadriceps amyotrophy."

Patients who had received vibration therapy increased the average walking speed in the 10 m walk test by a median of 0.18 ms(-1) (from a baseline of 0.47 ms(-1)), whereas there was no change in the control group (P=0.03 for the group difference in walking speed change). No significant group differences were detected for changes in areal bone mineral density (aBMD) at the lumbar spine, but at the distal femoral diaphysis aBMD increased in controls and decreased in the WBV group (P=0.03 for the group difference in aBMD change). About 1% of the WBV treatment sessions were interrupted because the child complained of fatigue or pain. In conclusion, the WBV protocol used in this study appears to be safe in children with cerebral palsy and may improve mobility function but we did not detect a positive treatment effect on bone."

The mutation 9185T>C in ATP6 gene, associated with Leigh syndrome, was reported in only few families. Motor neuron disease (MND), both clinically and electrophysiologically, was not previously described in association with this mutation. Case Report. 33-year-old male, with family history of mitochondrial disease, presented with cognitive impairment, exercise intolerance, and progressive muscle weakness. Examination revealed global hypotonia, and proximal tetraparesis, without atrophy or fasciculation, pyramidal signs, or sensory symptoms. The laboratory findings revealed an increase of lactate and lactate/pyruvate ratio; electromyogram showed chronic neurogenic compromise; muscle biopsy was suggestive of spinal muscular atrophy and mitochondriopathy; genetic study of SMN1 was negative but detected a homoplasmic mutation 9185T>C in ATP6 gene. His younger sister, with the same mutation, had cognitive impairment, ataxia, and muscle weakness. EMG showed axonal peripheral neuropathy. Conclusion. This case is unique because of the benignity and the coexistence of clinical, neurophysiological, and pathological findings suggestive of MND that, although described in mitochondrial disease, have not yet been reported in association with 9185T>C mutation. The present case contributes to the expansion of the phenotypic expressions of this particular mutation."

The diagnostic evaluation consists of a comprehensive neurologic and orthopedic examination supplemented by appropriate neurophysiologic and neuroradiologic studies. Currently, magnetic resonance imaging and myelography with computed tomography are the imaging methods of choice. Conservative therapy helps one half of patients with cervical spondylotic myelopathy, and surgery may benefit up to three quarters. Although this condition is entirely benign pathologically, its clinical manifestations appear malicious and deleterious.

CD012120,0,23107878,0,Recommendations for the diagnosis and management of typical childhood spinal muscular atrophy.,"Typical childhood spinal muscular atrophy is a disease that affects the anterior horn of the spinal cord related to SMN1 gene defects. Since no etiological treatment is currently available, its management is necessarily symptomatic and involves multidisciplinary care. The national plan on rare diseases for 2005-2008 developed by the French Ministry of Health resulted in the creation of 12 reference centres for neuromuscular diseases, mainly to improve their diagnosis and management. During the first one-day clinical research meeting on neuromuscular disorders, organized by the French Association to fight myopathies (AFM) in May 2007, clinicians from the 12 national reference centers led workshops for each of the main neuromuscular diseases. Concerning spinal muscular atrophy, discussions involving specialists from medical and allied professions were led by clinicians in charge of the workshop sessions. This paper reports the final version of their recommendation regarding the diagnosis, monitoring and management of typical infantile spinal muscular atrophy, which is necessarily multidisciplinary, including orthopedic, pulmonary, gastroenterology and nutrition care."
CD012120,0,2612097,0,[Muscle fiber type abnormalities in bulbospinal muscular atrophy. Comparison with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis].,"Bulbospinal muscular atrophy (BSA) is a distinct clinical type of chronic spinal muscular atrophy of adult onset, which was first reported by Kennedy et al. Histochemical findings of involved muscles are poorly described. In the present study, the muscle fiber type was studied on biopsied specimens by the histochemical method. The results were compared with those of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Muscle specimens were obtained mainly from biceps brachii muscles of 7 cases of BSA and 10 cases of ALS. Both group of patients were matched in respect to age, sex and stage of muscle weakness. The following results were obtained. Histopathological findings of BSA are classed as stage 4 abnormalities of Jennekins. Both fiber type grouping and type 2B deficiency are more frequent in BSA than in ALS. Type 2C fiber seems to be more in ALS than in BSA. Atrophy factor of Dubowitz is the same in BSA and in ALS. Hypertrophy factor is more prominent in BSA than in ALS. Significant correlation between fiber type grouping and type 2B deficiency was confirmed in muscles from other neurogenic atrophy. Since there is a significant association of the type 2B deficiency with fiber type grouping, type 2B fiber might be transformed to type 2A during the reinnervation process. The adaptation to the increased activities of the survived muscles and motoneurons might be contributory to the transformation, which is already known to occur in normal subjects during the endurance training."

The patient developed slowly progressive muscular weakness and wasting over a 2-year period with an accompanying numbness in the finger tip. He can run normally but not so fast. When he was aged 52-year old, difficulty in running progressed. General physical examination revealed nothing particular except for hypertension and gynecomastia. He showed muscular weakness and atrophy in the tongue, shoulder girdle, and upper and lower limbs. Calf muscle hypertrophies were prominent on both sides. The tendon reflexes were absent. Slight sensory impairment for vibration and pin-prick was present distally in all limbs. Autonomic nerve dysfunction was not observed. Hyperglycemia, elevated HbA1c and elevated serum CK (1,242 IU/l) were seen. The computed tomographic analyses on skeletal muscle showed hypertrophic changes in the calf muscles with a few fatty infiltrations. Electromyography showed a systemic neurogenic pattern. Motor nerve conduction velocities were slightly delayed in the lower limits. Sensory nerve action potentials were not elicited in all nerves tested. Sural nerve biopsy disclosed marked reduction of myelinated fibres for that of large diameter with thin myelin. Teased fibre studies showed a definite increase in the incidence of fibres with segmental demyelination and remyelination. In electron microscopic examination, typical or atypical onion bulb formation was observed on individual fibres. Axonal changes were minimum. We believe that segmental demyelination observed in this patient is not secondary to axonal damage. We, also, investigated AR gene abnormality by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in this patient.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

CD012120,0,28525176,0,[Camptocormia: From diagnosis to treatment].,"Camptocormia or Bent Spine Syndrome (BSS) is a symptom, often unknown, affecting elderly patients. Camptocormia is a dynamic anteflexion of the trunk occurring during physical exercises or in standing position and reducible in decubitus. It is caused by an impairment of the extensor muscles of the spinal column, either idiopathic or secondary to a muscular or a neurological disease. Its diagnosis is primarily anamnestic and clinical. The use of imaging could highlight a paraver tebral muscular fatty infi l tration with preserved volume in the case of idiopathic disorder and allows exclusion of osteoarticular pathologies. The treatment must be proposed as early as possible, before advanced adipose muscle evolution and significant anteflexion of the trunck.

CD012120,0,15052620,0,Motor function-muscle strength relationship in spinal muscular atrophy.,"The relationship between motor function and muscle strength in patients with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is still controversial. In 120 genetically proven SMA patients, aged 5 years or older, we measured muscle strength in the arms and legs by a hand-held dynamometer, forced vital capacity by a spirometer, and the time needed to walk 10 m, arise from the floor, and climb steps. SMA patients had markedly reduced muscle strength, approximating 20% of that predicted from age- and gender-matched normative data. Knee extensors were the weakest muscles in SMA patients. The young ambulant SMA patients performed better than adults in all the timed tests and had greater muscle strength on knee extension. This study shows a good relationship between motor ability and muscle strength in SMA and confirms that age-related loss of function in SMA is due to loss of muscle strength."
CD012120,0,24022865,0,Altered content of AMP-activated protein kinase isoforms in skeletal muscle from spinal cord injured subjects.,"AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a pivotal regulator of energy homeostasis. Although downstream targets of AMPK are widely characterized, the physiological factors governing isoform expression of this protein kinase are largely unknown. Nerve/contractile activity has a major impact on the metabolic phenotype of skeletal muscle, therefore likely to influence AMPK isoform expression. Spinal cord injury represents an extreme form of physical inactivity, with concomitant changes in skeletal muscle metabolism. We assessed the influence of longstanding and recent spinal cord injury on protein abundance of AMPK isoforms in human skeletal muscle. We also determined muscle fiber type as a marker of glycolytic or oxidative metabolism. In subjects with longstanding complete injury, protein abundance of the AMPKγ3 subunit, as well as myosin heavy chain (MHC) IIa and IIx, were increased, whereas abundance of the AMPKγ1 subunit and MHC I were decreased. Similarly, abundance of AMPKγ3 and MHC IIa proteins were increased, whereas AMPKα2, -β1, and -γ1 subunits and MHC I abundance was decreased during the first year following injury, reflecting a more glycolytic phenotype of the skeletal muscle. However, in incomplete cervical lesions, partial recovery of muscle function attenuated the changes in the isoform profile of AMPK and MHC. Furthermore, exercise training (electrically stimulated leg cycling) partly normalized mRNA expression of AMPK isoforms. Thus, physical activity affects the relative expression of AMPK isoforms. In conclusion, skeletal muscle abundance of AMPK isoforms is related to physical activity and/or muscle fiber type. Thus, physical/neuromuscular activity is an important determinant of isoform abundance of AMPK and MCH. This further underscores the need for physical activity as part of a treatment regimen after spinal cord injury to maintain skeletal muscle metabolism."

Trophoblast retrieval was adequate for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of Y chromosome-specific DNA sequences and detection of paternal-specific microsatellite alleles. The fetal sex predicted by PCR in TCCs was confirmed in all cases by karyotype analysis of chorionic villi at 10 weeks of gestation. The absence of the disease-associated paternal alleles in TCC samples from two pregnancies at risk for spinal muscular atrophy and myotonic dystrophy predicted unaffected fetuses in agreement with subsequent results on chorionic villi and newborns' leukocytes. A trisomy 21 fetus was diagnosed in TCCs using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and semi-quantitative PCR analysis of superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD 1). Present experience indicates that TCC sampling is a promising technique for early prenatal monitoring of Mendelian disorders and chromosome aneuploidy.

This case report describes an aquatic therapy program and the outcomes for a 3-year-old girl with type III SMA. Motor skills were examined using the 88-item Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM), the Peabody Developmental Motor Scales (PDMS-2), and the GAITRite system. The child received aquatic therapy twice per week for 45-min sessions, for 14 weeks. The intervention included aquatic activities designed to improve gross motor skills and age-appropriate functional mobility. The GMFM total score improved by 11% following the intervention. The Standing Dimension score improved by 28% and the Walking, Running, and Jumping Dimension score improved by 18%. The gross motor quotient for the PDMS-2 improved from 66 to 74. The child's gait showed improvement in walking velocity, stride length, and single-limb support time as a percentage of the gait cycle. The outcomes of this case report demonstrate the successful improvement of gross motor function and gait in a 3-year-old child with SMA.

CD012120,0,15993324,0,Rapidly progressive spinal muscular atrophy in an ambulatory 2-year-old male.,"A 2-year 9-month-old male was referred for gait disturbances. Main complaints were abnormal gait with frequent falls observed as soon as he began to walk unaided, at 18 months of age. The first neurologic examination revealed symmetric and proximal weakness in the lower limbs with difficulty running and walking upstairs. Deep tendon reflexes were decreased, and generalized hypotonia was observed. Three months later, at 3 years of age, he had lost independent gait, and 1 month later he could not stand unaided. DNA analysis revealed homozygous deletion in exons 7 and 8 of SMN1 gene, confirming the diagnosis of spinal muscular atrophy. According to the current classification, this patient would be classified as spinal muscular atrophy type III. The distinctive feature of this case was the short time elapsed (18 months) between onset of spinal muscular atrophy and the age at which he lost ambulation. This patient reinforces the notion that late onset of symptoms in spinal muscular atrophy and acquisition of independent gait do not exclude a rapidly progressive motor deterioration, which is important when talking with families about outcome. In those rapidly progressive cases, when promptly available, testing for SMN1 gene will prevent unnecessary, invasive, or uncomfortable procedures such as lumbar puncture, electromyography, or spinal cord magnetic resonance imaging."

Progression is slow and symptoms are clinically stable. Symptoms are seen in the second or third decades of life. In this study, we present a seven-year-old girl who was diagnosed and directed to the Physiotherapy Department at the age of 5 years and had unilateral proximal upper limb involvement. Family history of the case was recorded. Neurologic evaluation was performed. Range of joint motion, muscle shortness and strength, posture, extremity lengths, gait, timed performance, arm function, and motor and mental maturation were assessed. The physiotherapy program was designed progressively as strengthening and resistive exercises. Motor and mental developmental milestones were normal. There was no limitation in active or passive motion of all joints. She had more flexible joints, scapula alata, asymmetry between shoulder levels, and weakness on proximal muscles of the right upper extremity. In the follow-up assessment at eight months, there was no asymmetry between shoulder levels and scapular symmetry began to improve. Female gender and involvement restricted to one proximal upper limb are rare in the literature. This patient demonstrates the positive effects of physical therapy with early diagnosis of MMA. The rapid recovery of muscle weakness shows the importance of strengthening and resistive exercises applied to specific muscles in the treatment."
CD012120,0,15084522,0,Disuse atrophy and exercise rehabilitation in humans profoundly affects the expression of genes associated with the regulation of skeletal muscle mass.,"Skeletal muscle atrophy occurs as a consequence of injury, illness, surgery, and muscle disuse, impacting appreciably on health care costs and patient quality of life, particularly in the absence of appropriate rehabilitation. The molecular mechanisms that regulate muscle mass during atrophy and rehabilitation in humans have not been elucidated, despite several robust candidate pathways being identified. Here, we induced skeletal muscle atrophy in healthy volunteers using two weeks of limb immobilization, and then stimulated the restoration of muscle mass with six weeks of supervised exercise rehabilitation. We determined muscle mass and function and performed targeted gene expression analysis at prescribed time points during immobilization and rehabilitation. For the first time, we have identified novel changes in gene expression following immobilization-induced atrophy and during a program of rehabilitative exercise that restored muscle mass and function. Furthermore, we have shown that exercise performed immediately following immobilization induces profound changes in the expression of a number of genes in favor of the restoration of muscle mass, within 24 h. This information will be of considerable importance to our understanding of how immobilization and contraction stimulate muscle atrophy and hypertrophy, respectively, and to the development of novel therapeutic strategies aimed at maintaining or restoring muscle mass."
CD012120,0,21030670,0,Mechanisms regulating muscle mass during disuse atrophy and rehabilitation in humans.,"Muscle mass loss accompanies periods of bedrest and limb immobilization in humans and requires rehabilitation exercise to effectively restore mass and function. Although recent evidence points to an early and transient rise in muscle protein breakdown contributing to this decline in muscle mass, the driving factor seems to be a reduction in muscle protein synthesis, not least in part due to the development of anabolic resistance to amino acid provision. Although the AKT signaling pathway has been identified in small animals as central to the regulation of muscle protein synthesis, several studies in humans have now demonstrated a disassociation between AKT signaling and muscle protein synthesis during feeding, exercise, and immobilization, suggesting that the mechanisms regulating protein synthesis in human skeletal muscle are more complex than initially thought (at least in non-inflammatory states). During rehabilitation, exercise-induced myogenesis may in part be responsible for the recovery of muscle mass. Rapid and sustained exercise-induced suppression of myostatin mRNA expression, that precedes any gain in muscle mass, points to this, along with other myogenic proteins, as being potential regulators of muscle regeneration during exercise rehabilitation in humans."

CD012120,0,11870712,0,Effect of exercise on stability of chronically enlarged motor units.,"Chronic denervation syndromes such as the post-polio syndrome are associated with progressive muscle weakness and fatigue after motoneuron death. Neither the etiology nor the management of these syndromes is clear. To address this issue, we partially denervated rat hindlimb muscles for 1 or 12 months and examined whether chronically enlarged motor units (MUs) become destabilized with time and further destabilized by daily running on exercise wheels. MU enlargement, measured electrophysiologically and morphologically was significantly reduced at 12 months in extensively denervated muscles, and to a lesser extent in moderately denervated muscles, as compared to the findings at 1 month. A 1-month period of running exercise further reduced the size of the chronically enlarged MUs in the extensively denervated muscles. We have therefore (1) successfully established a rat model of time-related MU size reduction, in which destabilization of chronically enlarged MUs results in loss of axonal terminals, and (2) demonstrated that nonphysiological activity has small but significant effects of further destabilizing the chronically enlarged MUs."
CD012120,0,20046130,0,Consequences of bed rest.,"Bed rest is frequently prescribed for critically ill patients because it is assumed to be beneficial for preventing complications, for conserving scarce metabolic resources, and for providing patient comfort. Furthermore, higher levels of physical activity in critically ill patients have been assumed to be impractical or not feasible. Bed rest has been prescribed in the past for several other clinical conditions including acute flares of rheumatoid arthritis, cavitary tuberculosis, acute myocardial infarction, and acute low back pain. However, randomized, controlled, clinical trials failed to demonstrate beneficial effects of bed rest in most of these conditions. Bed rest can cause several complications that may delay or prevent recovery from critical illnesses including disuse muscle atrophy, joint contractures, thromboembolic disease, and insulin resistance. Recent studies demonstrated the feasibility and safety of physical medicine programs in critically ill patients including those with acute respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. Other physical medicine tools, such as neuromuscular electrical stimulation and passive stretching of muscles, may also reduce some complications of bed rest."
CD012120,0,14518784,0,Prevention of muscle disuse atrophy by low-frequency electrical stimulation in rats.,"When muscles lose neural drive, they atrophy rapidly. Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMS) has been used in attempts to prevent or reverse the atrophy, but optimal stimulation programs and parameters are not well defined. In this study, we investigated the effects of four different stimulation patterns on disuse atrophy produced in the tibialis anterior, lateral gastrocnemius, and soleus muscles of rats paralyzed with tetrodotoxin for seven days. Stimulation paradigms differed from one another by their stimulation frequency (2 or 10 pulses/s) and by their stimulation period (2 or 10 h a day). Results showed that stimulation with 2 pulses/s, paradigms were more effective at preventing disuse muscle atrophy than higher-frequency stimulation. The most marked difference was in the slow soleus muscle, which had only 10% mean atrophy when stimulated at 2 pulses/s for 10 h, compared to 26% atrophy when stimulated at 10 pulses/s for either 2 or 10 h and 32% atrophy in unstimulated, paralyzed controls. The level of atrophic change was not correlated with the levels of serum creatine kinase, used as an index of muscle damage. Results suggest that remediation of disuse atrophy may be accomplished using unphysiologically low rates of motor-unit activation despite the relatively low force produced by such unfused contractions. This may have significant implications for the design of therapies for muscle paralysis consequent to upper-motoneuron lesions."

Aside from mild facial and tongue weakness (and fasciculations), his examination was normal, including completely preserved muscle strength in the extremities. Electrodiagnostic evaluation revealed evidence for a chronic motor axonopathy/neuronopathy and abnormal sensory nerve action potentials. In addition, repetitive nerve stimulation studies were normal, but neuromuscular jitter tested in the same muscle was markedly abnormal. The normal clinical strength and repetitive nerve stimulation studies in a muscle showing markedly increased neuromuscular jitter suggested a mechanism for this patient's symptoms of muscle fatigue, related to failure of neuromuscular transmission at a critical number of endplates during extremes of physical activity."
CD012120,0,7786629,0,[A 21-year-old man with distal dominant progressive muscle atrophy].,"We report a 21-year-old man with distal dominant progressive muscle atrophy. The patient was apparently well until 17 years of age when he noted a decrease in exercise tolerance. One year later, he noted difficulty in arising his heels when the walked. He was admitted to our service for the work up in June 10, 1992. On admission, the patient was rather slender in the body build up; otherwise general physical examination was unremarkable. Upon neurologic examination, mental status and higher cerebral functions were normal. In the cranial nerves, the sternocleidomastoid muscles were atrophic bilaterally; other cranial nerves appeared intact. His gait was unstable and he showed steppage gait; walking on toes and heels were impossible. Distal dominant muscle atrophy was noted in both upper and lower extremities. Muscle strength in the deltoid, biceps brachii and triceps brachii was normal. In the lower extremities, both tibialis anterior and triceps surae muscles were weak (3/5). The iliopsoas and quadriceps femoris muscles were normal, however, the adductor muscles of the thigh showed marked weakness (2/5). Myotonia was absent. Deep reflexes were decreased; sensation was intact. Routine blood tests were unremarkable; CK was 96 IU/l, lactate 6.9 mg/dl, and pyruvate 0.61 mg/dl. After an ischemic forearm exercise test, blood lactate level rose to 22.5mg/dl (base line 11.2), and blood ammonia to 88.3 micrograms/dl (base line 71.2). EMG showed myogenic changes and myotonic discharges. A diagnostic biopsy was performed. The patient was discussed in a neurologic CPC, and the chief discussant arrived at the conclusion that the patient had type III glycogen storage disease. The differential diagnosis included rimmed vacuole type myopathy, Miyoshi type distal muscular dystrophy, Welander type muscular dystrophy, adult type acid-maltase deficiency, and lysosomal glycogen storage disease with normal acid maltase. However, characteristic clinical presentation of initial weakness in the triceps surae muscle associated with atrophy of the sternocleidomastoid muscle confirmed best of the clinical characteristics of type III glycogen storage disease; the only finding which did not fit with its diagnosis was elevation of the blood lactate level after the ischemic exercise test. The muscle biopsy specimen showed marked vacuole formation; approximately 20 to 30% of the vacuoles were rimmed vacuoles, however, the majority was not rimmed. PAS staining on an epon-embedded specimen revealed marked accumulation of PAS-positive materials in those vacuoles as well as in the interfascular space. The non-rimmed vacuoles were not positively stained in the acid-phosphatase staining, which exclude the diagnosis of acid maltase deficiency. No mitochondrial abnormalities were found.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

CD012120,0,18216203,0,Exercise-induced activation of NMDA receptor promotes motor unit development and survival in a type 2 spinal muscular atrophy model mouse.,"Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an inborn neuromuscular disorder caused by low levels of survival motor neuron protein, and for which no efficient therapy exists. Here, we show that the slower rate of postnatal motor-unit maturation observed in type 2 SMA-like mice is correlated with the motor neuron death. Physical exercise delays motor neuron death and leads to an increase in the postnatal maturation rate of the motor-units. Furthermore, exercise is capable of specifically enhancing the expression of the gene encoding the major activating subunit of the NMDA receptor in motor neurons, namely the NR2A subunit, which is dramatically downregulated in the spinal cord of type 2 SMA-like mice. Accordingly, inhibiting NMDA-receptor activity abolishes the exercise-induced effects on muscle development, motor neuron protection and life span gain. Thus, restoring NMDA-receptor function could be a promising therapeutic approach to SMA treatment."

CD012120,0,19644701,0,Atypical fast SERCA1a protein expression in slow myofibers and differential S-nitrosylation prevented by exercise during long term bed rest.,"We monitored changes in SERCA isoform specific expression and S-nitrosylation in myofibers of lower limb soleus (SOL) and vastus lateralis (VL) muscle biopsies before and after 60 days of voluntary long term bed rest (BR) without (BR-CTRL group, n = 8) and with exercise countermeasure (BR-EX group, n = 8). Before BR, a typical myofiber type-specific distribution of fast and slow SERCA1/2a isoforms was seen. After BR, a subpopulation (approx. 15%) of slow myofibers in BR-CTRL additionally expressed the fast SERCA1a isoform which was not seen in BR-EX. After BR, SERCA1a S-nitrosylation patterns analyzed by the biotin-switch assay decreased in disused SOL only but increased in both muscles following exercise. Differential SERCA1a S-nitrosylation and SERCA1a/2a co-expression in subsets of slow myofibers should be considered as signs of an altered cytosolic Ca(2+) homeostasis following chronic muscle disuse. Exercise preserved myofiber type-specific SERCA1a expression and S-nitrosylation in VL and SOL in a different way, suggesting muscle-specific responses to the countermeasure protocol applied during bed rest."
CD012120,0,1543427,0,Upper extremity strength and function in children with spinal muscular atrophy type II.,"Upper extremity strength and function in a sample of ten children with spinal atrophy type II was determined using manual muscle testing, a sphygmomanometer, and a pinchometer. Functional abilities were recorded on self-report forms. Overall strength in this sample was determined to be 35% to 40% of normal. Repeated-measures analysis of covariance revealed no change with time in proximal or distal strength. Six children were capable of at least 1/2 pound of force in pinch or gross grasp vs four children with zero force in one of these measures. Ability to produce a measurable force in pinch or gross grasp was found to be associated with independence in mobility, hand function, and ADL by Fisher exact test (p = .02). These data document the weak, but stable, muscle force present in these children and relate the strength of function."

Although the life span with Type I SMA (Werdnig-Hoffmann disease) may be short, children with the disease can be made more comfortable with appropriate medical care and parental support. Despite electrodiagnostic findings which are not always pathognomonic and muscle biopsies which can be difficult to interpret, the clinical presentation of these infants is so typical and the natural course of the disease so predictable that management can be telescopically designed. findings and muscle biopsies are more definitive. In these more benign forms of SMA, anticipatory medical management focuses on possible In SMA-II (Childhood) and SMA-III (Kugelberg-Welander), electrodiagnostic findings and muscle biopsies are more definitive. In these more benign forms of SMA, anticipatory medical management focuses on possible dislocating hips, scoliosis, pulmonary compromise, and sudden increase in weakness associated with intercurrent illness or prolonged immobilization due to fractures or surgery. Further considerations include maintenance of strength and endurance, independence in self-care, psychosocial, educational, and vocational endeavors.

CD012120,0,12865054,0,The Hammersmith functional motor scale for children with spinal muscular atrophy: a scale to test ability and monitor progress in children with limited ambulation.,"A functional motor scale was devised for use in children with spinal muscular atrophy type 2 and type 3, in particular those with limited mobility, to give objective information on motor ability and clinical progression. The scale, which has 20 scored activities, was designed to be self-explanatory, quick, easy to use, reproducible and reliable. In this paper we describe the development of the scale, reporting the criteria used to choose the items to be included, their application in a normal cohort and in a cohort of children with SMA and how we arrived to a final version of the scale in which the items are arranged in order of difficulty. The analysis of 120 assessments over 2 years from 51 children with type 2 and type 3 SMA also led to a more accurate profile of functional achievements in both type 2 and 3 SMA and to a more detailed sub-classification of type 2 SMA."
CD012120,0,23259234,0,Upper limb muscle fatigue during prolonged Boccia games with underarm throwing technique.,"This study investigated the acute fatigue pattern in neuromuscular activity after a simulated Boccia game and the effect of fatigue pattern on sport performance. Nine elite Boccia athletes were tested before, during, and after a simulated game. Maximum ball speed was captured with video, and the target hitting rate and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) score were collected and analyzed. Electromyography signals from the upper trapezius, anterior deltoid, posterior deltoid, biceps brachii, triceps brachii, and wrist extensor muscles were collected by surface electrode and were evaluated with mean power frequency (MPF). Only the upper trapezius muscle showed fatigue as demonstrated by a reduction of MPF of 8% (p = 0.027) when comparing the first and last throws in a simulated game. Subjective RPE score increased during the game (118%, p = 0.004), and sports performance in terms of maximum ball speed (-12%, p = 0.004) and target hitting rate (-25%, p = 0.004) also deteriorated. In conclusion, fatigue on the upper trapezius muscle was demonstrated in elite Boccia athletes following a prolonged Boccia game and may have affected Boccia performance. Preventative measures against upper trapezius muscle fatigue and endurance training for synergists of the upper trapezius muscle may be considered in future studies."

CD012120,0,9109983,1,Spinal muscular atrophy type II (intermediary) and III (Kugelberg-Welander). Evolution of 50 patients with physiotherapy and hydrotherapy in a swimming pool.,"We added hydrotherapy to 50 patients with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) who were being treated with individual conventional physiotherapy. Hydrotherapy performed at an approximate temperature of 30 degrees Celsius, twice a week, for thirty minutes in children and forty-five minutes in adults during a 2-year period. The outcome derived from this combined modality of treatment was rated according to physiotherapeutic evaluations, the MMT (Manual Muscular Test), and the Barthel Ladder. Patients were reevaluated at 2-month intervals. After two years of ongoing treatment, we were able to observe that the deformities in hip, knee and foot were progressive in all SMA Type II patients, and in some Type III. Muscle strength stabilized in most SMA Type III patients, and improved in some. MMT was not done in SMA Type II. In all patients we were able to detect an improvement in the Barthel Ladder scale. This study suggests that a measurable improvement in the quality of daily living may be obtained in patients with SMA Types II and III subjected to conventional physiotherapy when associated with hydrotherapy."
CD012120,0,21952871,0,Difference in chronological changes of outcome measures between untreated and placebo-treated patients of spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy.,"Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is an adult-onset, X-linked motor neuron disease characterized by muscle atrophy, weakness, and bulbar involvement. The aim of this study was to analyze the differential change of various outcome measures by comparing the progression of motor impairment in the two independent groups: placebo-treated group (PTG) and natural history group (NHG). For the PTG, we analyzed 99 patients who participated in a previous double-blind phase III clinical trial and received placebo. For the NHG, a total of 34 patients were followed with no specific treatment. The characteristics of both groups did not differ at baseline except for disease duration. Although the 6 min walk distance (6MWD) showed almost the same progression in both groups (-14.7 ± 7.3 m in NHG, -14.0 ± 4.7 m in PTG; NS), there was a significant difference of progression in the ALSFRS-R between the NHG and PTG (-1.18 ± 0.38, -0.14 ± 0.24; p = 0.03). A similar tendency was also seen in the subgroup analysis of the patients whose disease durations were less than 10 years. Although the relationship between the ALSFRS-R and 6MWD at week 48 was similar to that at baseline in the NHG, the slope of the regression at week 48 was significantly milder than at baseline in the PTG (p = 0.04). In conclusion, these two groups demonstrated a large difference in the chronological analysis of a motor function score, but showed similar changes in objective measures of walking capacity. These findings should be thoroughly considered when designing clinical trials for slowly progressive neurodegenerative diseases such as SBMA."
CD012120,0,12418614,0,Evaluation of therapeutic electrical stimulation to improve muscle strength and function in children with types II/III spinal muscular atrophy.,"The study aimed to evaluate the effect of low-intensity night-time therapeutic electrical stimulation (TES) on arm strength and function in children with intermediate type spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). The design was a randomized controlled trial with a 6-month baseline control period. Children were evaluated at baseline, 6, and 12 months. TES was applied from 6 to 12 months to the deltoid and biceps muscle, of a randomly selected arm with the opposite arm receiving a placebo stimulator. Thirteen individuals with SMA between 5 to 19 years of age were recruited into the study and eight completed the 12-month assessment. No statistically significant differences between the treatment and control arm were found at baseline, 6, and 12 months for elbow flexors, or shoulder abductors on quantitative myometry or manual muscle testing. There was no significant change in excitable muscle mass assessed by M-wave amplitudes, nor function on the Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory (self-care domain). Therefore, in this study there was no evidence that TES improved strength in children with SMA."

CD012120,0,16107648,0,Regular exercise prolongs survival in a type 2 spinal muscular atrophy model mouse.,"Several studies indicate that physical exercise is likely to be neuroprotective, even in the case of neuromuscular disease. In the present work, we evaluated the efficiency of running-based training on type 2 spinal muscular atrophy (SMA)-like mice. The model used in this study is an SMN (survival motor neuron)-null mouse carrying one copy of a transgene of human SMN2. The running-induced benefits sustained the motor function and the life span of the type 2 SMA-like mice by 57.3%. We showed that the extent of neuronal death is reduced in the lumbar anterior horn of the spinal cord of running-trained mice in comparison with untrained animals. Notably, exercise enhanced motoneuron survival. We showed that the running-mediated neuroprotection is related to a change of the alternative splicing pattern of exon 7 in the SMN2 gene, leading to increased amounts of exon 7-containing transcripts in the spinal cord of trained mice. In addition, analysis at the level of two muscles from the calf, the slow-twitch soleus and the fast-twitch plantaris, showed an overall conserved muscle phenotype in running-trained animals. These data provide the first evidence for the beneficial effect of exercise in SMA and might lead to important therapeutic developments for human SMA patients."
CD012120,0,21509821,0,Cancellous bone formation response to simulated resistance training during disuse is blunted by concurrent alendronate treatment.,"The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness of simulated resistance training (SRT) exercise combined with alendronate (ALEN) in mitigating or preventing disuse-associated losses in cancellous bone microarchitecture and formation. Sixty male Sprague-Dawley rats (6 months old) were randomly assigned to either cage control (CC), hind limb unloading (HU), HU plus either ALEN (HU + ALEN), SRT (HU + SRT), or a combination of ALEN and SRT (HU + SRT/ALEN) for 28 days. HU + SRT and HU + SRT/ALEN rats were anesthetized and subjected to muscle contractions once every 3 days during HU (four sets of five repetitions, 1000 ms isometric + 1000 ms eccentric). Additionally, HU + ALEN and HU + SRT/ALEN rats received 10 µg/kg of body weight of ALEN three times per week. HU reduced cancellous bone-formation rate (BFR) by 80%, with no effect of ALEN treatment (-85% versus CC). SRT during HU significantly increased cancellous BFR by 123% versus CC, whereas HU + SRT/ALEN inhibited the anabolic effect of SRT (-70% versus HU + SRT). SRT increased bone volume and trabecular thickness by 19% and 9%, respectively, compared with CC. Additionally, osteoid surface (OS/BS) was significantly greater in HU + SRT rats versus CC (+32%). Adding ALEN to SRT during HU reduced Oc.S/BS (-75%), Ob.S/BS (-72%), OS/BS (-61%), and serum TRACP5b (-36%) versus CC. SRT and ALEN each independently suppressed a nearly twofold increase in adipocyte number evidenced with HU and inhibited increases in osteocyte apoptosis. These results demonstrate the anabolic effect of a low volume of high-intensity muscle contractions during disuse and suggest that both bone resorption and bone formation are suppressed when SRT is combined with bisphosphonate treatment."

In 4 females the SMA clearly followed an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. The disease was autosomal dominantly inherited in 2 patients; the other 6 were sporadic cases. Ages of onset of SMA ranged from 8 months to 29 years; all the females learned to walk, and 10 out of 12 are still ambulatory aged 30-60 years. Pregnancy and delivery were complicated in 10 out of 12 patients by premature labour (4), prolonged labour (3) and delayed postpartum recovery (6). Caesarean section was performed in 3 cases. No deleterious effects on fetal outcome could be detected. Exacerbation of muscle weakness after the second trimester of pregnancy was experienced by 8 females: 5 noticed a persistent deterioration of SMA; in 3 muscle weakness worsened temporarily during pregnancy and was followed by marked improvement in the puerperium.

A review of Duchenne muscular dystrophy and spinal muscular atrophy, the leading neuromuscular disorders affecting children, will be followed by a critical analysis of the various pathophysiological mechanisms underlying respiratory manifestations in these patients. Among such mechanisms, the role of muscular weakness in preservation of lung function, mucociliary clearance, gas exchange at rest and during exercise, and respiratory control during wakefulness and sleep will be examined in detail. In addition, the potential benefits of respiratory muscle training and of early diagnosis and clinical intervention will be delineated. This review underscores the importance of periodic assessment of pulmonary function during wakefulness and sleep in children affected by neuromuscular diseases as an essential component of multidisciplinary care aimed at improving long-term morbidity, survival, and quality of life."
CD012120,0,20190376,0,Dynamic skeletal muscle stimulation and its potential in bone adaptation.,"To identify mechanotransductive signals for combating musculoskeletal deterioration, it is essential to determine the components and mechanisms critical to the anabolic processes of musculoskeletal tissues. It is hypothesized that the interaction between bone and muscle may depend on fluid exchange in these tissues by mechanical loading. It has been shown that intramedullary pressure (ImP) and low-level bone strain induced by muscle stimulation (MS) has the potential to mitigate bone loss induced by disuse osteopenia. Optimized MS signals, i.e., low-intensity and high frequency, may be critical in maintaining bone mass and mitigating muscle atrophy. The objectives for this review are to discuss the potential for MS to induce ImP and strains on bone, to regulate bone adaptation, and to identify optimized stimulation frequency in the loading regimen. The potential for MS to regulate blood and fluid flow will also be discussed. The results suggest that oscillatory MS regulates fluid dynamics with minimal mechanical strain in bone. The response was shown to be dependent on loading frequency, serving as a critical mediator in mitigating bone loss. A specific regimen of dynamic MS may be optimized in vivo to attenuate disuse osteopenia and serve as a biomechanical intervention in the clinical setting."

Sixteen patients with NMD (13 with Duchenne muscular dystrophy and 3 with spinal muscular atrophy) performed inspiratory muscle training (IMT) at home with a special training apparatus for 9 months. Maximal inspiratory mouth pressure (PI(MAX)) and 12s-maximum voluntary ventilation (12s-MVV) test served as parameters for inspiratory muscle strength and endurance, respectively. In patients whose inspiratory vital capacity (VC(in)) declined by less than 10% during the year before training began (n = 10), a significant positive correlation was found between the number of successfully completed strength and endurance exercises and the improvement of PI(MAX) (P < 0.05) and 12s-MVV (P < 0.05). In patients whose VC(in)-decline exceeded 10% (n = 6), indicating more progressive respiratory system involvement of the disease, no significant correlation between the improvement of PI(MAX) and 12s-MVV and the intensity of training was found. In patients with NMD, the effects of IMT-runs are dose-dependent, provided that the respiratory system involvement of the disease is only slowly progressive."

CD012120,0,14571943,0,New technical advances in swivel walkers.,"Swivel walkers were commonly prescribed for children with complete thoracic lesion myelomeningocele in the 1970s and 80s, when the incidence of spina bifida in the UK was of the order of 3 per 100,000 live births. The advent of reciprocal walking orthoses provided a more suitable alternative for those with good upper limb and trunk function, and swivel walkers were then used primarily for very young or more severely disabled patients. Pre-natal screening has dramatically reduced the incidence of spina bifida in the UK and subsequently swivel walkers have been used in a wider range of pathology, including spinal muscular atrophy, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy and other neurological conditions that lead to lower limb dysfunction. The detail design of these devices has been adapted to accommodate the specific problems encountered in these conditions. In particular the designs have been updated to: enable very young patients to be more readily fitted at the age of 1 year; allow the walking mechanisms to be conveniently adjusted for easier ambulation when weakness or lack of confidence inhibits performance; permit simple adjustment to a standing frame mode to enhance stability in situations of increased risk; promote manual handling practice that is compatible with the National Health Service (NHS) policy of compliance with relevant regulations. To underpin appropriate prescription and safe supply the NHS Procurement Agency have encouraged the development of a common course for all types of swivel walker."

CD012120,0,17661376,0,Knee extensor fatigability after bedrest for 8 weeks with and without countermeasure.,"We analyzed the effects of gravitational unloading on muscular fatigability and the effectiveness of resistive vibration exercise to counteract these changes. Changes in knee extensor fatigability as a consequence of 8 weeks of horizontal bedrest with or without daily resistive vibration exercise were evaluated in 17 healthy male volunteers. Bedrest increased fatigability (% decrease in maximal voluntary isometric torque per minute exercise) from -7.2 +/- 0.5 to -10.2 +/- 1.0%/min (P < 0.05), which was accompanied by a decline (of 52.0 +/- 3.7%, P < 0.05) in muscle blood flow. Daily resistive vibration exercise training during bedrest prevented increases in fatigability (from -10.8 +/- 1.8 to -8.4 +/- 1.6%/min, P < 0.05), and mitigated the reduction in blood flow (decline of 26.1 +/- 5.1%, P < 0.05). Daily resistive exercise may thus be suggested as an effective countermeasure during spaceflight and illness-related prolonged bedrest to combat the detrimental changes in muscle endurance that result from gravitational unloading."

A case report].","A 28-year-old male barber with no similar disease in his family admitted to our hospital because of difficulty of raising his arms in March 2003. When he was 18 years old, he broke his left clavicle. He started weight training from January 2003, then he gradually felt difficulty to raise his arms. Physical examination on admission showed weakness and atrophy of both serratus anterior muscles and there was no weakness in the other muscles. Serum CK level was 806 IU/l and CT scan of the upper thoracic levels revealed atrophy of the serratus anterior muscles on the both sides. Needle electromyography showed neurogenic change in the right serratus anterior muscle. Thus the diagnosis of bilateral long thoracic nerve palsy was made. Bilateral scapular winging (scapula alata) is commonly caused by systemic disease, especially muscular dystrophy or spinal muscular atrophy. Bilateral long thoracic nerve palsy by weight training should be known as one of the cause for the ""scapula alata""."
CD012120,0,8867072,0,Testosterone therapy and the pathogenesis of Kennedy's disease (X-linked bulbospinal muscular atrophy).,"The mutation in X-linked bulbospinal muscular atrophy (XBSMA) is an increased CAG triplet repeat coding for a polyglutamine domain in the gene for the androgen receptor. This might impair the effect of testosterone on motor neurons, leading to their progressive degeneration. We report a trial of high-dose oral testosterone therapy in two brothers with XBSMA. Patient 1 received 37.5 mg of testosterone daily for more than 18 months, and Patient 2 received 25 mg per day for six months, both in combination with exercise therapy. Patient 1 showed improvement of up to 300% in muscle work output. Patient 2, who did less exercise, had no symptomatic improvement. These results indicate that exogenous testosterone therapy is not harmful, and may produce functional improvement when combined with exercise. We hypothesize that high-dose testosterone may reduce a toxic gain of function that the mutation produces, perhaps by inhibiting glutamate neurotoxicity."

CD012120,0,4749680,0,Chronic generalized spinal muscular atrophy of infancy and childhood. Arrested Werdnig-Hoffman disease.,"Recent studies have shown that the acute fatal form of infantile spinal muscular atrophy (acute Werdnig-Hoffmann disease or spinal muscular atrophy Type I) is a distinct genetic and clinical entity. This has prompted clinical re-examination of the disease known as `arrested Werdnig-Hoffmann disease' which hitherto was thought to be a spectrum variant of the acute fatal form. A total of 18 such patients with the chronic generalized form of spinal muscular atrophy has been known to The Hospital for Sick Children over the past 10 years. Patients with this characteristic clinical syndrome comprise approximately one-fifth of children with chronic spinal muscular atrophy. Clinically, no patient was even able to crawl normally or progress further with motor milestones. Median age of clinical onset is 6 months of age, and life expectancy ranges from 2 years to the third decade. Inevitable spinal and joint deformities occur by the second decade of life. Management should be based on vigorous antibiotic therapy, orthopaedic and neurological surveillance, and a carefully planned educational programme aimed at realistic employment in late adolescence."
CD012120,0,1578236,0,Clinical variability of autosomal dominant spinal muscular atrophy.,"Autosomal dominant spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is generally classified into a juvenile and an adult onset form. Clinical data of 20 affected members out of 6 families with autosomal dominant proximal SMA are reported. Three families could largely be classified as the adult onset form (onset after 20 years of life). They showed a benign course, most of them remaining ambulatory 10-40 years after clinical onset. Intrafamilial variability of onset was small, the progression of weakness within one family appeared to be very similar. Three patients of the other 3 families suffered from the juvenile onset form (first symptoms before the age of 12 years) with walking difficulties throughout life, whereas other family members would have been classified as adult onset SMA. The latter had an onset between age 17 and 28 years, and were only moderately handicapped when last examined (aged 38-60 years). The great intrafamilial variability in at least some of the families with autosomal dominant SMA is not compatible with the distinction of two clinically defined genetic entities. This observation is important with respect to a reliable prediction in clinical practice and genetic counselling."

Ten PS individuals with Pisa syndrome (PS) and nine subjects with Camptocormia (CC) performed 3-D Gait Analysis and were evaluated with walking and balance scales. Correlations with clinical and functional scales were investigated. Spatio-temporal and kinematic data were compared to ten PD subjects without postural deformities (PP) and ten healthy matched individuals (CG). Data obtained showed decreased walking velocity, stride and step length in PP, PS and CC groups compared to controls. The correlation analysis showed that stride and step length were associated with reduced functional abilities and disease severity in PS and CC groups. Kinematic data revealed marked reduction in range of movements (ROMs) at all lower-extremity joints in PS group. While, in CC group the main differences were pronounced in hip and knee joints. PS and CC groups presented a more pronounced reduction in hip articular excursion compared to PP subjects, revealing an increased hip flexion pattern during gait cycle. Moreover, the increased hip and knee flexion pattern adversely affected functional performance during walking tests. Results obtained provide evidence that step length, along with stride length, can be proposed as simple and clear indicators of disease severity and reduced functional abilities. The reduction of ROMs at hip joint represented an important mechanism contributing to decreased walking velocity, balance impairment and reduced gait performance in PD patients with postural deformities."

Transcutaneous muscle stimulation (TMS) may reverse muscle atrophy and lean mass loss in immobile patients by ""artificial exercise."" Four paraplegic patients with upper motor neuron lesions entered The Ohio State University Clinical Research Center for a 21-day metabolic balance study. After 6 days of baseline monitoring, each underwent isometric tetanic contractions (15 sec on; 45 sec off) of all major lower extremity muscle groups with TMS for 10 hr daily. Cross-sectional areas of muscle plus bone were calculated with CAT scan planimetry at 7 levels in both lower extremities before and after the TMS period. Three patients completed the metabolic balance study. TMS produced significant growth of innervated thigh and calf muscles in all paraplegic patients. Little growth occurred where bone and tendon predominate. No significant changes in nitrogen balance (urine and stool excretion), potassium balance (urine excretion only), or phosphate balance (urine excretion only) could be demonstrated. Two possible explanations are (1) that the patients may have been underfed and (2) that perhaps due to an increase in metabolic rate owing to the stimulation, lean tissue in other locations may have been mobilized to meet leg muscle demands. Future studies will incorporate metabolic monitoring of oxygen consumption and CO2 production during the experiment."

CD012120,0,21885651,0,Expression and regulation of Homer in human skeletal muscle during neuromuscular junction adaptation to disuse and exercise.,"Protein calcium sensors of the Homer family have been proposed to modulate the activity of various ion channels and nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), the transcription factor modulating skeletal muscle differentiation. We monitored Homer expression and subcellular localization in human skeletal muscle biopsies following 60 d of bedrest [Second Berlin Bedrest Study (BBR2-2)]. Soleus (SOL) and vastus lateralis (VL) biopsies were taken at start (pre) and at end (end) of bedrest from healthy male volunteers of a control group without exercise (CTR; n=9), a resistive-only exercise group (RE; n=7), and a combined resistive/vibration exercise group (RVE; n=7). Confocal analysis showed Homer immunoreactivity at the postsynaptic microdomain of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) at bedrest start. After bedrest, Homer immunoreactivity decreased (CTR), remained unchanged (RE), or increased (RVE) at the NMJ. Homer2 mRNA and protein were differently regulated in a muscle-specific way. Activated NFATc1 translocates from cytoplasm to nucleus; increased amounts of NFATc1-immunopositive slow-type myonuclei were found in RVE myofibers of both muscles. Pulldown assays identified NFATc1 and Homer as molecular partners in skeletal muscle. A direct motor nerve control of Homer2 was confirmed in rat NMJs by in vivo denervation. Homer2 is localized at the NMJ and is part of the calcineurin-NFATc1 signaling pathway. RVE has additional benefit over RE as countermeasure preventing disuse-induced neuromuscular maladaptation during bedrest."

We sought to determine whether muscle-specific transgenic overexpression of PGC-1β affects the detraining response following endurance training. First, we established and validated a mouse exercise-training-detraining protocol. Second, using multiple physiological and gene expression end points, we found that PGC-1β overexpression in skeletal muscle of sedentary mice fully recapitulated the training response. Lastly, PGC-1β overexpression during the detraining period resulted in partial prevention of the detraining response. Specifically, an increase in the plateau at which O"

CD012120,0,15823469,0,"Low amplitude, high frequency strains imposed by electrically stimulated skeletal muscle retards the development of osteopenia in the tibiae of hindlimb suspended rats.","The purpose of this study was to determine the extent to which high frequency, low amplitude skeletal muscle contractions, induced using electrical stimulation, could prevent or retard disuse osteopenia. Ten minutes of 30 Hz electrical stimulation was delivered, 5 days a week, during a 4 week rat-hindlimb suspension protocol. Each pulse generated a peak compressive dynamic strain on the tibia of approximately 200 microepsilon. We hypothesized that the electrical stimulation protocol would significantly reduce the loss of tibial bone mineral density compared to the contralateral control tibia that did not receive electrical stimulation. Compared to the contralateral control limb, the tibia of the stimulated limb had significantly higher bone mineral density and enhanced newly formed bone in the tibial diaphysis. The diaphysis, specifically the posterior bone cortex, of the tibia of the limb receiving the stimulation also demonstrated substantially larger mineral-binding fluorochrome biomarker within the osteocyte lacunae and canalicular volumes. Although the protocol did not prevent disuse osteopenia the evidence suggests that it was effective at reducing the extent of the osteopenia. One possibility for this outcome may be the insensitivity of bone to static, compared to dynamic compressive loads. In the present study there was a considerable static component to the compressive loads that accounted for a large component of the peak load generated by the stimulated skeletal muscle. Nevertheless, the results provide impetus for further development of the methods by which muscle contraction-induced loading of bone can be clinically exploited."
CD012120,0,8187575,0,Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation for treatment of spinal spasticity.,"Thirty-two patients with spinally originated muscle spasticity were treated with a transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulator, the Han's acupoint nerve stimulator (HANS) via skin electrodes placed over the acupoints on the hand and leg. High frequency (100 Hz), but not the low frequency (2 Hz), stimulation was effective in ameliorating muscle spasticity. While the therapeutic effect lasted for only 10 minutes in the first treatment, it became consolidated after consecutive daily treatment for 3 months. The anti-spastic effect induced by high frequency electrical stimulation can be partially reversed by a high dose of naloxone. The results suggest that the anti-spastic effect elicited by peripheral electrical stimulation is mediated, at least in part, by the endogenous opioid ligand interacting with the kappa opiate receptors, most probably dynorphin, in the central nervous system."

There is no consensus on the degree of thoracolumbar flexion to define camptocormia. However, most authors usually use an arbitrary number of at least 45° flexion of the thoracolumbar spine when the individual is standing or walking. Aetiologies of camptocormia are heterogeneous, and Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of its many causes. The prevalence of camptocormia in PD ranges from 3% to 18%. Central and peripheral mechanisms might both contribute to its pathogenesis.

The limiting factors in aerobic power may be related to loss of functional muscular mass rather than to changes in the oxygen transport system. There was no correlation between VO2 max values and muscle strength as determined by a manual test of the affected muscles recruited for bicycle exercise. The results, therefore, do not support the possibility of a correlation between these indices previously proposed on the basis of clinical evidence."

CD012120,0,27681426,0,Rescue of Metabolic Alterations in AR113Q Skeletal Muscle by Peripheral Androgen Receptor Gene Silencing.,"Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), a progressive degenerative disorder, is caused by a CAG/glutamine expansion in the androgen receptor (polyQ AR). Recent studies demonstrate that skeletal muscle is an important site of toxicity that contributes to the SBMA phenotype. Here, we sought to identify critical pathways altered in muscle that underlie disease manifestations in AR113Q mice. This led to the unanticipated identification of gene expression changes affecting regulators of carbohydrate metabolism, similar to those triggered by denervation. AR113Q muscle exhibits diminished glycolysis, altered mitochondria, and an impaired response to exercise. Strikingly, the expression of genes regulating muscle energy metabolism is rescued following peripheral polyQ AR gene silencing by antisense oligonucleotides (ASO), a therapeutic strategy that alleviates disease. Our data establish the occurrence of a metabolic imbalance in SBMA muscle triggered by peripheral expression of the polyQ AR and indicate that alterations in energy utilization contribute to non-neuronal disease manifestations."

CD012120,0,22773541,0,Longitudinal changes of outcome measures in spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy.,"Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy is an adult-onset, hereditary motor neuron disease caused by the expansion of a trinucleotide CAG repeat within the gene encoding the androgen receptor. To date, several agents have been shown to prevent or slow disease progression in animal models of this disease. For the translational research of these agents, it is necessary to perform the detailed analysis of natural history with quantitative outcome measures and to establish sensitive and validated disease-specific endpoints in the clinical trials. To this end, we performed a prospective observation of disease progression over 3 years in 34 genetically confirmed Japanese patients with spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy by using quantitative outcome measures, including functional and blood parameters. The baseline evaluation revealed that CAG repeat length in the androgen receptor gene correlated not only with the age of onset but also with the timing of substantial changes in activity of daily living. Multiple regression analyses indicated that the serum level of creatinine is the most useful blood parameter that reflects the severity of motor dysfunction in spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy. In 3-year prospective analyses, a slow but steady progression was affirmed in most of the outcome measures we examined. In the analyses using random coefficient models that summarize the individual data into a representative line, disease progression was not affected by CAG repeat length or onset age. These models showed large interindividual variation, which was also independent of the differences of CAG repeat size. Analyses using these models also demonstrated that the subtle neurological deficits at an early or preclinical stage were more likely to be detected by objective motor functional tests such as the 6-min walk test and grip power or serum creatinine levels than by functional rating scales, such as the revised amyotrophic lateral sclerosis functional rating scale or modified Norris scale. Categorization of the clinical phenotypes using factor analysis showed that upper limb function is closely related to bulbar function, but not to lower limb function at baseline, whereas the site of onset had no substantial effects on disease progression. These results suggest that patients with spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy show a slow but steady progression of motor dysfunction over time that is independent of CAG repeat length or clinical phenotype, and that objective outcome measures may be used to evaluate disease severity at an early stage of this disease."

When executed properly, exercise can maintain and improve health and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, obesity, and diabetes. In persons with muscle wasting due to neuromuscular conditions, however, a common belief has been that physical activity could accelerate degeneration of the diseased muscle and a careful approach to training has therefore been suggested. In this review, we describe the current knowledge about physical training in patients with neuromuscular diseases associated with weakness and wasting. We review studies that have investigated different types of exercise in both myopathies and motor neuron diseases, with particular emphasis on training of persons affected by spinobulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA).

Medical, surgical and rehabilitative approaches can be used to maintain patient function and comfort. Contracture release, hip dysplasia correction and procedures to address or prevent hip subluxation or dislocation, are not always necessary since patients can be asymptomatic and surgical treatment will not always be successful in maintaining a reduced hip. In fact, controversy surrounds the management of hip disorder in children with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, Spinal Muscular Atrophy, Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease and Arthrogryposis Multiplex Congenita. Patients with neuromuscular disorders also frequently develop a progressive scoliosis with pelvic obliquity which may affect sitting balance and become painful.

Preliminary report.,"Isokinetic muscle testing (IMT) allows precise and reliable measurement of the force produced by the skeletal muscle during exercise at constant velocity and accommodating resistance. This study reports on some clinical situations that illustrate the difference between manual muscle testing (MMT) and IMT in neuromuscular patients. IMT was performed by a special method (continuous passive motion plus gravity compensation) which allowed the measurement of very weak forces, such as in the four patients described in this study. It is important to note that for the same MMT grading the corresponding isokinetic force values were very different. Therefore there is an obvious correspondence between the isokinetic measurement of muscle strength and the morphological change in the muscle on the CT scan of the thigh, which did not show up on MMT. IMT could be extremely important for research into neuromuscular disorders, where the detection of even the tiniest variations in strength is relevant."

Pathologically, VM is characterized by vacuolization in the lateral and posterior columns of the thoracic spinal cord and has a striking similarity with the myelopathy of vitamin B12 deficiency. In autopsy series, 20% to 55% of patients with AIDS have evidence of spinal cord disease consistent with VM. The myelopathy usually manifests late in the course of HIV infection, with slowly progressive weakness of the lower extremities, gait disorder, sensory abnormalities in the legs, impotence in men, and urinary frequency and urgency. Its course is invariably progressive and leads to severe paralysis of the lower limbs, with loss of the ability to walk and of sphincter control. The differential diagnosis is extensive and includes metabolic, infective, and neoplastic spinal cord diseases. The diagnosis is based on the clinical observation and the exclusion of other causes of myelopathy via serologic, radiographic, and cerebrospinal fluid studies. The pathogenesis of VM is unknown. Attempts to detect HIV in the spinal cord have not yielded significant results, and there is no evidence of a relationship between the presence of HIV and the development of myelopathy. A metabolic disorder of the vitamin B12-dependent transmethylation pathway, induced by HIV or cytokine activation, is considered the possible cause of VM associated with AIDS. There is no known treatment for AIDS myelopathy and there is no evidence that antiretroviral drugs can improve the symptoms or slow the progression of VM. The symptomatic treatment includes antispasticity agents, management of sphincter dysfunction, and physical therapy. Experimental treatments are being tested in clinical trials."

The subdivision of type III SMA was justified by the probability of being ambulatory depending on age at onset; the prognosis differed for those with onset before or after age 3 years.

CD012120,0,26915343,0,Long-term exercise-specific neuroprotection in spinal muscular atrophy-like mice.,"The real impact of physical exercise parameters, i.e. intensity, type of contraction and solicited energetic metabolism, on neuroprotection in the specific context of neurodegeneration remains poorly explored. In this study behavioural, biochemical and cellular analyses were conducted to compare the effects of two different long-term exercise protocols, high intensity swimming and low intensity running, on motor units of a type 3 spinal muscular atrophy (SMA)-like mouse model. Our data revealed a preferential SMA-induced death of intermediate and fast motor neurons which was limited by the swimming protocol only, suggesting a close relationship between neuron-specific protection and their activation levels by specific exercise. The exercise-induced neuroprotection was independent of SMN protein expression and associated with specific metabolic and behavioural adaptations with notably a swimming-induced reduction of muscle fatigability. Our results provide new insight into the motor units' adaptations to different physical exercise parameters and will contribute to the design of new active physiotherapy protocols for patient care."

CD012120,0,23809874,0,Six minute walk test in type III spinal muscular atrophy: a 12month longitudinal study.,"The aim of our longitudinal multicentric study was to establish the changes on the 6min walk test (6MWT) in ambulant SMA type III children and adults over a 12month period. Thirty-eight ambulant type III patients performed the 6MWT at baseline and 12months after baseline. The distance covered in 6min ranged between 75 and 510m (mean 294.91, SD 127) at baseline and between 50 and 611m (mean 293.41m, SD 141) at 12months. The mean change in distance between baseline and 12months was -1.46 (SD 50.1; range: -183 to 131.8m). The changes were not correlated with age or baseline values (p>.05) even though younger patients reaching puberty, had a relatively higher risk of showing deterioration of more than 30m compared to older patients. Our findings provide the first longitudinal data using the 6MWT in ambulant SMA patients."
CD012120,0,18642380,0,"Role of MyoD in denervated, disused, and exercised muscle.","The myogenic regulatory factor MyoD plays an important role in embryonic and adult skeletal muscle growth. Even though it is best known as a marker for activated satellite cells, it is also expressed in myonuclei, and its expression can be induced by a variety of different conditions. Several model systems have been used to study the mechanisms behind MyoD regulation, such as exercise, stretch, disuse, and denervation. Since MyoD reacts in a highly muscle-specific manner, and its expression varies over time and between species, universally valid predictions and explanations for changes in MyoD expression are not possible. This review explores the complex role of MyoD in muscle plasticity by evaluating the induction of MyoD expression in the context of muscle composition and electrical and mechanical stimulation."
CD012120,0,23144342,0,A 20-year-old female with Hirayama disease complicated with dysplasia of the cervical vertebrae and degeneration of intervertebral discs.,"A 20-year-old female patient was presented with a 1-year history of progressive weakness of the left hand. Examination on admission showed atrophy of the muscles of the left forearm, cold paralysis and minipolymyoclonus. MR images of the cervical cord showed anterior transfer of the cervical cord on anterior flexion and cervical cord compression at the site of cervical kyphosis, confirming the diagnosis of Hirayama disease. Many features of the present case are unusual: the patient is a female (who are rarely afflicted by this disease), with cervical kyphosis and a history of exercise involving cervical vertebral loading, suggesting a potential involvement of the latter two factors in the disease onset. The findings suggest that cervical vertebral dysplasia and intervertebral disc degeneration may influence cervical kyphosis, and be involved in the onset of Hirayama disease."
CD012120,0,20345415,0,Skeletal muscle fibre diversity and the underlying mechanisms.,"The review first briefly summarizes how myosin isoforms have been identified as the major determinant of the functional variability among skeletal muscle fibres. The latter feature is a major characteristic of muscle fibres and a major basis of skeletal muscle heterogeneity and plasticity in vivo. Then, evidence is reported, which indicates that the properties of muscle fibres can vary with no change in the myosin isoform they express. Moreover, the physiological and pathological conditions (ageing, disuse, exercise training, muscular dystrophy) in which such myosin isoform independent change in functional properties occurs and the possible underlying mechanisms are considered. Finally, the known molecular bases of the functional differences among slow and fast isoforms are briefly dealt with."

CD012120,0,24150846,0,Transcriptional activation of TFEB/ZKSCAN3 target genes underlies enhanced autophagy in spinobulbar muscular atrophy.,"Spinobulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is an inherited neuromuscular disorder caused by the expansion of a CAG repeat encoding a polyglutamine tract in exon 1 of the androgen receptor (AR) gene. SBMA demonstrates androgen-dependent toxicity due to unfolding and aggregation of the mutant protein. There are currently no disease-modifying therapies, but of increasing interest for therapeutic targeting is autophagy, a highly conserved cellular process mediating protein quality control. We have previously shown that genetic manipulations inhibiting autophagy diminish skeletal muscle atrophy and extend the lifespan of AR113Q knock-in mice. In contrast, manipulations inducing autophagy worsen muscle atrophy, suggesting that chronic, aberrant upregulation of autophagy contributes to pathogenesis. Since the degree to which autophagy is altered in SBMA and the mechanisms responsible for such alterations are incompletely defined, we sought to delineate autophagic status in SBMA using both cellular and mouse models. Here, we confirm that autophagy is induced in cellular and knock-in mouse models of SBMA and show that the transcription factors transcription factor EB (TFEB) and ZKSCAN3 operate in opposing roles to underlie these changes. We demonstrate upregulation of TFEB target genes in skeletal muscle from AR113Q male mice and SBMA patients. Furthermore, we observe a greater response in AR113Q mice to physiological stimulation of autophagy by both nutrient starvation and exercise. Taken together, our results indicate that transcriptional signaling contributes to autophagic dysregulation and provides a mechanistic framework for the pathologic increase of autophagic responsiveness in SBMA."

CD012120,0,21068456,0,[Gait disturbances related to dysfunction of the cerebral cortex and basal ganglia].,"This review aimed to characterize the gait disturbances in Parkinson disease (PD) and highlight how a rehabilitation program would affect the care of patients with PD. The typical PD gait is a type of hypokinetic gait characterized by reduced stride length and velocity; shortening of the swing phase; and increase in the stance phase, double-limb support duration, and cadence rate. In the advanced phase of PD, start hesitation, shuffling and festinating gait, propulsion, and freezing of gait (FOG) become remarkable. Notably, in PD, attention may influence gait control, and sensory cueing may improve the stride length. Our study on gait impairment in PD by using a three-dimensional motion analysis system revealed that the stride length and walking speed decreased, but there was no change in cadence. The decreased stride length was due to reduction in the range of movement at the leg and pelvic joints. A 4-week physical rehabilitation program for PD improved the stride length and walking speed;this was achieved by increasing the range of movement of at the leg and pelvic joints. We also assessed the effects of a rehabilitation program for patients with PD who experienced FOG. Although the lower limb function was more impaired in patients with PD and FOG than in those with PD without FOG, the rehabilitation program was effective even for patients with PD and FOG. FOG might be associated with functional impairment of the lower limb as well as dysfunction of the fronto-basal ganglia circuit. We also reported 3 cases of camptocormia (bent spine syndrome) with autonomic dysfunction and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorders (RBD) and compared their symptoms with those reported elsewhere. We think that the pedunculopontine nuclear area may control the postural muscle tone and locomotion in PD. On the basis of the results of our rehabilitation programs, we speculate that physical modalities may modify synaptic plasticity by utilizing the cerebellar and/or afferent sensory system. These alternative systems are believed to be functionally intact in patients with PD."
CD012120,0,1941962,0,Genetic counselling in facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy.,"Clinical data are presented from a survey of 41 families with dominantly inherited facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) in which over 500 family members were examined, including 168 affected subjects. New mutation could account for six isolated cases. Results suggest that 33% of heterozygotes over 40 years are mildly affected and a majority develop significant lower limb weakness; 19% over 40 years require wheelchairs. Presymptomatic testing of serum creatine kinase level (CK) is limited as a raised level occurs in only 80% of affected males under 40 years and 48% of affected women. Distribution of weakness, severity, age at onset, and CK varied between subjects, but provided no clinical evidence for genetic heterogeneity in a comparison between the 11 largest families. The conclusion of genetic homogeneity in FSHD, including subjects previously diagnosed as FSH type spinal muscular atrophy, is strongly supported by recent genetic linkage data."
