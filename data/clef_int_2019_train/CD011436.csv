CD011436,0,24704366,0,Primary afferent input critical for maintaining spontaneous pain in peripheral neuropathy.,"Central sensitization after peripheral nerve injury may result in ectopic neuronal activity in the spinal cord dorsal horn, implying a potential autonomous pain-generating mechanism. This study used peripheral nerve blockade and systemic lidocaine administration, with detailed somatosensory assessment, to determine the contribution of primary afferent input in maintaining peripheral neuropathic pain. Fourteen patients with neuropathic pain (7 with unilateral foot pain due to peripheral nerve injury and 7 with bilateral pain in the feet due to distal polyneuropathy) underwent comprehensive characterization of somatosensory function by quantitative sensory testing. Patients were then administered an ultrasound-guided peripheral nerve block with lidocaine and intravenous lidocaine infusion in randomized order. The effect of these interventions on spontaneous pain intensity and on evoked cold, warm, pinprick, and brush responses was assessed at each session. All patients had sensory disturbances at baseline. The peripheral nerve block resulted in a complete abolition of ipsilateral pain within 10 min (median) in all patients, with lidocaine plasma concentrations being too low to account for a systemic effect of the drug. Intravenous lidocaine infusion reduced the spontaneous pain by 45.5% (±31.7%), and it reduced mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity in most patients who displayed such signs. However, the improvement in evoked hypersensitivity was not related to the effect of the drug on spontaneous pain intensity. This study demonstrated that regardless of the individual somatosensory phenotype and signs of central sensitization, primary afferent input is critical for maintaining neuropathic pain in peripheral nerve injury and distal polyneuropathy."

CD011436,0,26864002,0,A randomised controlled trial of intrathecal blockade versus peripheral nerve blockade for day-case knee arthroscopy.,"We allocated 100 patients scheduled for day-case knee arthroscopy to unilateral spinal anaesthesia with 40 mg intrathecal hyperbaric prilocaine or to ultrasound-guided femoral-sciatic nerve blockade with 25 ml mepivacaine 2%, 50 participants each. The median (IQR [range]) time to walk was 285 (240-330 [160-515]) min after intrathecal anaesthesia vs 328 (280-362 [150-435]) min after peripheral nerve blockade, p = 0.007. The median (IQR [range]) time to home discharge was 310 (260-350 [160-520]) min after intrathecal anaesthesia vs 335 (290-395 [190-440]) min after peripheral nerve blockade, p = 0.016. There was no difference in time from anaesthetic preparation to readiness for surgery."
CD011436,0,19798014,0,Pediatric regional anesthesia.,"Pediatric regional anesthesia has attained wide use internationally because of its efficacy and safety; its use is supported by the existence of extensive data from the international literature underlining the safety and efficacy of this technique. Safer drugs and dedicated pediatric tools are the keys to this success. Indeed, if we compare the drugs available to pediatric anesthesiologists for use in performing a block years ago with those in use today, it can be seen that progress in this area has been tremendous. The long journey began many years ago; at that time, pediatric regional anesthesia was seen as an extravagant and useless technique, used by only a few and opposed by many detractors. Despite its well-known benefits, clinical failures can occur during the application of regional anesthetic techniques. Neurovascular anatomy is highly variable, and presently available nerve localization techniques provide little or no information regarding the anatomical spread of local anesthesia; furthermore, traditional nerve localization techniques (nerve stimulation) rely on anatomical assumptions that may be incorrect. Modern imaging techniques, such as computed tomography scanning and ultrasound, are now available for improving these procedures. The ultrasound technique is now widely applied in children and many reports confirm the efficacy and advantages of this method. In children, ultrasound guidance has been shown to improve block characteristics, resulting in shorter block performance time, higher success rates, shorter onset, longer block duration, reduction in volume of local anesthetic agents required, and better visibility of neuraxial structures. Clinical studies in children suggest that ultrasound guidance has some advantages for regional block over more traditional nerve stimulation-based techniques. However, with the exception of ilio-inguinal blocks, the advantage of ultrasound guidance over traditional with respect to safety has not been adequately demonstrated in children, since there are only a limited number of randomized control trials in children comparing ultrasound-guided peripheral nerve block with other techniques. Real-time ultrasound guidance for peripheral regional anesthesia is not a foolproof technique. New data have emerged suggesting that the novice ultrasonographer may often commit repeated errors, the two most common being failure to visualize the needle during advancement and unintentional probe movement. For this reason, the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and the European Society of Regional Anesthesia created a Joint Committee, and a document was produced ''to recommend to members and institutions the scope of practice, the teaching curriculum, and the options for implementing the medical practice of ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia services""."
CD011436,0,23587731,0,Role of transversus abdominis plane block after caesarean delivery.,The transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block is a relatively new regional anaesthesia technique that has shown analgesic benefit in abdominal and pelvic surgery.

CD011436,0,25255663,0,[The trends of ultrasound-guided neuraxial block].,"Ultrasound-guided neuraxial block has provided safe and accurate analgesia. Although the classic anatomical landmark technique is still standard for completing epidural or subarachnoid puncture, it is difficult to identify the anatomical structure in some cases such as pregnant women, obese patients and patients with spinal deformity. Preparatory ultrasound scanning enables to identify the midline and determine the point of insertion, which reduces the number of puncture attempts and failure rate of procedure. Moreover, there are reports about the efficacy of ultrasound guidance in children. Usually, neuraxial block for children is performed under general anesthesia which has some risk for nerve injury and inadequate catheterization. Visualization of epidural and subarachnoid space facilitates an appropriate insertion. Additionally, the utility of ultrasound-guided lumbar puncture has also been reported in emergency department. Cerebrospinal puncture is an important procedure for diagnosis of some critical conditions such as subarachnoid hemorrhage and central nervous system infections. Ultrasound imaging contributes to smooth procedure and fewer complications. This review summarizes the basic ultrasound-guided technique for expected difficult neuraxial block patients, presenting recent findings."

CD011436,0,23972755,0,Regional anesthesia in neonates and infants.,Optimal pain management can significantly impact the surgical outcome and length of stay in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Regional anesthesia is an effective alternative that can be used in both term and preterm neonates. A variety of neuraxial and peripheral nerve blocks have been used for specific surgical and NICU procedures. Ultrasound guidance has increased the feasibility of using these techniques in neonates. Education and training staff in the use of continuous epidural infusions are important prerequisites for successful implementation of regional anesthesia in NICU management protocols.
CD011436,0,15041578,0,"The effects of spread of block and adrenaline on cardiac output after epidural anesthesia in young children: a randomized, double-blind, prospective study.","Epidural anesthesia is considered to be without significant hemodynamic consequence in young children. However, conversely to adults, few studies have investigated cardiac output. Using transesophageal Doppler monitoring of cardiac output, we prospectively investigated hemodynamic alterations in 48 children (median age, 22.5 mo) receiving sevoflurane general anesthesia combined with caudal or thoracolumbar epidural anesthesia. They were randomly assigned to receive 0.8 mL/kg of plain local anesthetic mixture (lidocaine 1% + bupivacaine 0.25% (50/50) + 1 microg/mL of fentanyl) or 1 mL/kg of the same mixture with 5 microg/mL of adrenaline. No significant hemodynamic alteration was elicited in caudal and thoracolumbar groups receiving the plain mixture except a moderate decrease in heart rate. Conversely, a mixture with adrenaline added provoked a significant decrease in mean arterial blood pressure by 14% and 17%, in systemic vascular resistance by 24% and 40%, and an increase in cardiac output by 20% and 34% in caudal and thoracolumbar groups, respectively. The adrenaline effect was greater by the thoracolumbar than the caudal approach. In young children, epidural anesthesia induces an increase in cardiac output only when adrenaline is added to local anesthetics, probably through its systemic absorption from the epidural space."

Its major drawback is placement of the needle, with inaccurate placement, especially in children, being a risk factor for pneumothorax and vascular puncture and failure of the procedure. Ultrasound-guided needle placement may reduce the risk of complications and increase the accuracy of the block, particularly in pediatric patients. Little has been published on the efficacy and safety of ultrasound-guided supraclavicular block in children based on practical experience, and there has been no published report on its usage in younger children (<6 years old)."

CD011436,0,24276107,0,Ultrasonography-guided ilioinguinal-iliohypogastric nerve block for inguinal herniotomies in ex-premature neonates.,"The ilioinguinal-iliohypogastric (IG-IH) nerve block provides effective opioid-sparing analgesia for inguinal surgeries. The technique is especially useful in apnoea-prone premature neonates with sacral anomalies and coagulopathy. A recent retrospective review of 82 ex-premature neonates who underwent inguinal herniotomy at KK Women's and Children's Hospital, Singapore, reported a success rate of 89% for landmark-guided IG-IH blocks. All blocks in that study were performed by senior paediatric anaesthetists using the landmark-based technique, which relies on fascial clicks. The IG-IH block is expected to be technically more difficult in neonates. There is also a stronger need to ensure success in these patients in order to avoid the use of opioids and reduce the risk of postoperative apnoea. Ultrasonographic guidance has been reported to improve the success of IG-IH blocks in older children to up to 94%. Herein, we report a series of six ex-premature neonates in whom ultrasonography-guided IG-IH blocks were successfully performed using reduced volumes of local anaesthetics (mean volume 0.17 mL/kg) for inguinal herniotomy."

CD011436,0,28213879,0,"Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita: classification, diagnosis, perioperative care, and anesthesia.","Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC) is a rare disorder characterized by non-progressive, multiple contractures. In addition to affected extremities, patients may also present microstomia, decreased temporomandibular joint mobility. Although the etiology of AMC is unclear, any factor that decreases fetal movement is responsible for AMC. Thus, accurate diagnosis and classification are crucial to the appropriate treatment of AMC. The development of ultrasound technology has enabled prenatal diagnosis. Very early treatment is favorable, and multidisciplinary treatment is necessary to improve the function of AMC patients. Most patients require surgery to release contracture and reconstruct joints. However, perioperative care is challenging, and difficult airway is the first concern of anesthesiologists. Postoperative pulmonary complications are common and regional anesthesia is recommended for postoperative analgesia. This review on AMC is intended for anesthesiologists. Thus, we discuss the treatment and perioperative management of patients undergoing surgery, as well as the diagnosis and classification of AMC."

For cardiac chamber size, no significant differences were found between the two groups: cardiac structures increased in size as a linear function of age and weight in all babies. Right ventricular systolic time interval ratios, however, were higher at birth in babies born by caesarian section, and dropped more rapidly during the first 24h. The decrease of RV systolic time interval ratios followed a parabolic function for both groups, thus reflecting the physiological decrease of pulmonary vascular resistance after birth. The possible causes of more rapid decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance in babies born by caesarian section is discussed."

We reported the ultrasound-guided single-injection adductor canal block (ACB) with 0.2% ropivacaine and dexmedetomidine (0.5 μg/kg) in addition in a series of 6 children. Patients' age was range from 7 to 15 years old with right or left habitual patellar dislocation needing an open reduction and internal refixation. Pain assessments using Numeric Rating Scale scores on the operative limb were made preoperatively and at 12, 24, 36, and 48 h postoperatively at rest. Medication consumption was calculated as well. The possible complications, such as hemodynamic changes, nausea, vomiting, and dysesthesia, were also recorded at 12, 24, 36, and 48 h postoperatively at rest.

CD011436,0,20377542,0,Ultrasound in regional anaesthesia.,"Ultrasound guidance is rapidly becoming the gold standard for regional anaesthesia. There is an ever growing weight of evidence, matched with improving technology, to show that the use of ultrasound has significant benefits over conventional techniques, such as nerve stimulation and loss of resistance. The improved safety and efficacy that ultrasound brings to regional anaesthesia will help promote its use and realise the benefits that regional anaesthesia has over general anaesthesia, such as decreased morbidity and mortality, superior postoperative analgesia, cost-effectiveness, decreased postoperative complications and an improved postoperative course. In this review we consider the evidence behind the improved safety and efficacy of ultrasound-guided regional anaesthesia, before discussing its use in pain medicine, paediatrics and in the facilitation of neuraxial blockade. The Achilles' heel of ultrasound-guided regional anaesthesia is that anaesthetists are far more familiar with providing general anaesthesia, which in most cases requires skills that are achieved faster and more reliably. To this ends we go on to provide practical advice on ultrasound-guided techniques and the introduction of ultrasound into a department."

CD011436,0,22050550,0,Peripheral catheter techniques.,"With ultrasound, continuous peripheral nerve blocks (CPNBs) are one of the most recent developments in regional anesthesia in children. CPNBs are now used more widely in children because more suitable materials have been marketed, allowing complete, and prolonged postoperative pain control. Their use after orthopedic procedures in children and treatment for complex regional pain syndrome in adolescents has demonstrated the benefits. Perineural catheters have also shown their superiority over other techniques of continuous regional anesthesia in terms of side effects. The efficiency and the safety of these techniques may facilitate early ambulation with improved pain management, treatment at home with disposable pumps, and improved rehabilitation of children. Studies on large cohorts of patients published to date have failed to highlight any severe complications in their use compared with other adult studies. Accidents owing to systemic toxicity are very unlikely if the recommended maximum dose is not exceeded. The safety of continuous regional anesthesia techniques in children relies on the use of low-concentration l-enantiomer solutions (ropivacaine or levobupivacaine) accompanied by low plasma concentrations of local anesthetics, limiting the risk of systemic toxicity of these molecules. CPNB can ensure strong and lasting analgesia in hospital or at home."

CD011436,0,8109769,0,Ultrasound-guided supraclavicular approach for regional anesthesia of the brachial plexus.,"We prospectively studied 40 patients (ASA grades I-III) undergoing surgery of the forearm and hand, to investigate the use of ultrasonic cannula guidance for supraclavicular brachial plexus block and its effect on success rate and frequency of complications. Patients were randomized into Group S (supraclavicular paravascular approach; n = 20) and Group A (axillary approach; n = 20). Ultrasonographic study of the plexus sheath was done. After visualization of the anatomy, the plexus sheath was penetrated using a 24-gauge cannula. Plexus block was performed using 30 mL bupivacaine 0.5%. Onset of sensory and motor block of the radial, ulnar, and median nerves was recorded in 10-min intervals for 1 h. Satisfactory surgical anesthesia was attained in 95% of both groups. In Group A, 25% showed an incomplete sensory block of the musculocutaneous nerve, whereas all patients in Group S had a block of this nerve. Complete sensory block of the radial, median, and ulnar nerves was attained after an average of 40 min without a significant difference between the two groups. Because of the direct ultrasonic view of the cervical pleura, we had no cases of pneumothorax. An accidental puncture of subclavian or axillary vessels, as well as neurologic damage, was avoided in all cases. An ultrasonography-guided approach for supraclavicular block combines the safety of axillary block with the larger extent of block of the supraclavicular approach."
CD011436,0,15966500,0,Continuous peripheral nerve blocks in children.,"In recent years, regional anaesthesia in children has generated increasing interest. Continuous peripheral nerve blocks have an important role in the anaesthetic arsenal, allowing effective, safe and prolonged postoperative pain management. Indications for continuous peripheral nerve blocks depend on benefits/risks analysis of each technique for each patient. The indications include surgery associated with intense postoperative pain, surgery requiring painful physical therapy, and complex regional pain syndrome. Continuous peripheral nerve blocks are usually performed under general anaesthesia or sedation, and require appropriate equipment in order to decrease the risk of nerve injury. New techniques, such as transcutaneous stimulation or ultrasound guidance, appear to facilitate nerve and plexus identification in paediatric patients. Nevertheless, continuous peripheral nerve block may mask compartment syndrome in certain surgical procedure or trauma. Finally, ropivacaine appears to be the best local anaesthetic for continuous peripheral nerve blocks in children, requiring low flow rate with low concentration of the local anaesthetic."
CD011436,0,22050512,0,Is there still a place for the use of nerve stimulation?,"The introduction of nerve stimulation as a method of nerve localization sparked a new beginning in regional anesthesia. It was an epochal development akin to the utilization of ultrasound in more recent times. Many experts now consider ultrasound-guided peripheral nerve blockade to be more efficient, less painful, and more successful than landmark and nerve stimulation techniques. However, inadvertent intraneural injection continues to occur despite the widespread use of ultrasound and nerve stimulation. Both of these technologies allow for only limited elucidation of needle position relative to the target nerve and are unable to reliably identify intraneural position of the needle. This article will review the role of nerve stimulation in modern regional anesthesia techniques in light of the introduction of ultrasound technology."

In this study we report on a retrospective analysis of the effectiveness and safety of CEA, DPNB-LM and ultrasound-guided dorsal penile nerve block (DPNB-US) in our institution over a six-year period. Information was gathered from each patient's medical record. A total of 216 circumcisions were performed on patients aged from five months to 15 years. One hundred and fifteen patients received CEA, 46 DPNB-LM and 55 DPNB-US. Patients in the DPNB-LM group required rescue morphine administration in the recovery unit more frequently (30.4%) than either the DPNB-US (3.5%) or CEA groups (3.6%). Similarly, the DPNB-LM group required a larger total dose of morphine, and had longer recovery ward stays than CEA or DPNB-US groups. Time to first analgesia was greatest for the CEA group while there was no significant difference between time to first analgesia for DPNB-LM and DPNB-US. Sixty-three percent of patients in the DPNB-LM group, 1.7% of CEA and 5.5% of the DPNB-US required intraoperative opiates (P < 0.0001). There was no difference in time to hospital discharge."

Because of its safety and efficacy, continuous peripheral nerve block has broad application in ambulatory and pediatric patients. Techniques for continuous peripheral nerve block have advanced significantly in the past decade, particularly as a result of affordable, high-resolution ultrasound equipment that permits rapid and successful administration and results in reduced procedure-related pain, lower dose requirements, and fewer vascular punctures. Continuous peripheral nerve block is associated with some limitations, including infection, neurologic injury, local anesthetic toxicity, and patient falls. The benefits of continuous peripheral nerve block are becoming increasingly relevant in the ambulatory surgery setting where more complex procedures are being performed on an outpatient basis."

CD011436,0,19819099,0,[Interest of ultrasonographic guidance in paediatric regional anaesthesia].,"The use of ultrasonographic guidance for regional anaesthesia has known recently a big interest in children in recent years. The linear ultrasound probes with a 25 mm active surface area (or probes with 38 mm active surface area in older children), with high sound frequencies in the range 8-14 MHz, allow a good compromise between excellent resolution for superficial structure and good penetration depths. In children, the easiest ultrasound guided blocks are axillar blocks, femoral blocks, fascia iliaca compartment blocks, ilio-inguinal blocks and para-umbilical blocks, caudal blocks. They permit a safe and easy learning curve of these techniques. The main advantage of ultrasound guided regional anaesthesia is the visualization of different anatomical structures and the approximate localization of the tip of needle. The other advantages for ultrasound guided peripheral nerve blocks in children are: faster onset time of sensory and motor block, longer duration of sensory blockade, increase of blockade quality and reduction of local anesthetic injection. The use of ultrasonographic guidance for central block allows to visualize different structures as well as spine and his content. Spinous process, ligament flavum, dura mater, conus medullaris and cerebrospinal fluid are identifiable, and give some information on spine, epidural space and the depth between epidural space and skin. At last, in caudal block, ultrasounds permit to evaluate the anatomy of caudal epidural space, especially the relation of the sacral hiatus to the dural sac and the search of occult spinal dysraphism. Benefit of this technique is the visualization of targeted nerves or spaces and the spread of injected local anaesthetic."

The quality of blocks and analgesia is relevant to the perioperative outcome of patients and the development of perfect blocks has always been a focus in regional anaesthesia research. Several studies in neuroaxial anaesthesia and peripheral blocks have found that puncture processing performed under ultrasound guidance is easier and more effective than that performed without such guidance, thus ultrasound imaging techniques are being developed for clinical practice. One of the major advantages of these techniques is that they provide the opportunity to show the patient the anatomical situation before the puncture--using a near harmless and effective technique. A second advantage is that the puncture process and the application of medication can be demonstrated and clearly observed during the performance. If there is a problem with the spread or the application, the processing of the block can be immediately modified to improve the quality of the technique."

The aim of this investigation was to determine whether unilateral paravertebral block could provide better control of postoperative pain syndrome compared with unilateral subarachnoid block (SAB). A randomized controlled study was conducted using 50 patients with unilateral inguinal hernias. The patients were randomized to receive either paravertebral block (S group) or SAB (C group). Paravertebral block was performed by injecting a total of 20 mL of 0.5% levobupivacaine from T9 to T12 under ultrasound guidance, whereas SAB was performed by injecting 13 mg of 0.5% levobupivacaine at the L3 to L4 level. Data regarding anesthesia, hemodynamic changes, side effects, time spent in the postanesthesia care unit, the Karnofsky Performance Status, acute pain and neuropathic disturbances were recorded. Paravertebral block provided good anesthesia of the inguinal region without patient or surgeon discomfort, with better hemodynamic stability and safety and with a reduced time to discharge from the postanesthesia care unit compared with SAB. During the postsurgical and posthospital discharge follow-ups, rest and incident pain and neuropathic positive phenomena were better controlled in the S group than in the C group. The consumption of painkillers was higher in the C group than in the S group throughout the follow-up period. Paravertebral block can be considered a viable alternative to common anesthetic procedures performed for inguinal hernia repair surgery.

However, the use of this device may not always be practical in operating room. The train-of-four (TOF) test is a non-invasive peripheral nerve stimulator that shows the level of motor block of muscle relaxants. The aim of the study is to investigate the use of TOF testing as a peripheral nerve stimulator for objective clinical evaluation of motor block at axillary brachial plexus block. 44 patients were randomized according to the development of partial or complete motor in the axillary brachial plexus block. The nerves were selectively localized by nerve stimulation and ultrasound guidance. After obtaining an appropriate peripheral motor response, predetermined volumes of bupivacaine were selectively injected to the 4 nerves. Sensory, motor block levels and TOF values were measured at 10th, 20th, 30th minutes immediately after the axillary brachial plexus block. TOF values were gradually decreased and significant difference was observed between the development of a complete and partial motor block at 30th minute. TOF values were also significantly less in patients of complete sensory block than the patients of partial sensory block at 30th minute. The use of TOF monitoring may be beneficial to assess the objective clinical effect of motor block in the patients with axillary brachial plexus nerve block."

Often, the site of the harvested graft for these reconstructions is reported to be the most painful part of the procedure and a common reason for deferring these reconstructive procedures. This study in pediatric burn patients undergoing reconstructive procedures examined the analgesia response to local anesthetic infiltration versus either a single ultrasound-guided regional nerve block of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve (LFCN) or a fascia iliaca compartment block with catheter placement and continuous infusion. Nineteen patients were randomized to one of three groups (infiltration, single-shot nerve block, or compartment block with catheter) and received intraoperative analgesia intervention. Postoperatively, visual analog scale pain scores were recorded-for pain at the donor site-every 4 hours while awake-for 48 hours. This nonparametric data was analyzed using a two-way ANOVA, Friedman's test, and Kruskal-Wallis test, with significance determined at P < 0.05. The analysis demonstrated that the patients in the regional anesthesia groups were significantly more comfortable over the 48 hour hospital course than the patients in the control group. The patients receiving a single-shot block of the LFCN were more comfortable on postoperative day (POD) 0 while the catheter patients were more comfortable on POD 1 and POD 2. There was not a statistically significant difference in opioid requirements in any group. Regional anesthetic block of the LFCN, with or without catheter placement, provides an improved postoperative experience for the pediatric patient undergoing reconstructive surgery with lateral/anterolateral skin graft versus local anesthesia infiltration of donor site. For optimal comfort throughout the postoperative period, an ultrasound-guided block with continuous catheter may be beneficial."

CD011436,0,16960634,0,Innovative approaches to neuraxial blockade in children: the introduction of epidural nerve root stimulation and ultrasound guidance for epidural catheter placement.,"Continuous epidural blockade remains the cornerstone of pediatric regional anesthesia. However, the risk of catastrophic trauma to the spinal cord when inserting direct thoracic and high lumbar epidural needles in anesthetized or heavily sedated pediatric patients is a concern. To reduce this risk, research has focused on low lumbar or caudal blocks (ie, avoiding the spinal cord) and threading catheters from distal puncture sites in a cephalad direction. However, with conventional epidural techniques, including loss-of-resistance for localization of the needle, optimal catheter tip placement is difficult to assess because considerable distances are required during threading. Novel approaches include electrical epidural stimulation for physiological confirmation and segmental localization of epidural catheters, and ultrasound guidance for assessing related neuroanatomy and real-time observation of the needle puncture and, potentially, catheter advancement. The present article provides a brief and focused review of these two advances, and outlines recent clinical experiences relevant to pediatric epidural anesthesia."
CD011436,0,24491660,0,Ultrasound for regional anesthesia in children.,The use of regional anesthesia in children is increasing. Rapid advancement in the use of ultrasound guidance has allowed for a greater ease in performing peripheral regional anesthesia in pediatrics. Successful peripheral nerve blockade provides children with analgesia that will improve their operative experience.
CD011436,0,7909642,0,The effects of regional anaesthesia for caesarean section on maternal and fetal blood flow velocities measured by Doppler ultrasound.,"We studied the effects of spinal anaesthesia (Group S), epidural anaesthesia (Group E), and combined spinal and epidural anaesthesia (Group SE), on maternal and fetal blood flow in 24 healthy parturients (n = 8/group) with uncomplicated singleton pregnancies using Doppler technique. Prior to the induction of anaesthesia, the patients were prehydrated with balanced electrolyte solution 15 ml.kg-1 over a period of 15 min. After the induction of regional anaesthesia, the systolic blood pressure was maintained within 15% limits of the preoperative values using prophylactic etilefrine infusion in Groups S and SE. The flow velocity waveforms of the maternal femoral artery, the main branch of the uterine artery (placental side), the foetal umbilical and middle cerebral arteries were recorded by Doppler technique before and after prehydration as well as after onset of T7 analgesia and the pulsatility indices (PI) were derived. Rapid intravenous prehydration had no effects on uteroplacental or fetal circulation as indicated by unaltered uterine, umbilical, and fetal middle cerebral artery PIs. After the onset of T7 analgesia, the uterine artery PI was increased in Group S indicating increased uterine vascular resistance while no changes occurred in Groups E and SE. No adverse effects were observed on the neonates as indicated by the Apgar score and the umbilical artery and vein acid-base status in any of the groups."

CD011436,0,24348179,0,Ultrasound for the anesthesiologists: present and future.,"Ultrasound is a safe, portable, relatively inexpensive, and easily accessible imaging modality, making it a useful diagnostic and monitoring tool in medicine. Anesthesiologists encounter a variety of emergent situations and may benefit from the application of such a rapid and accurate diagnostic tool in their routine practice. This paper reviews current and potential applications of ultrasound in anesthesiology in order to encourage anesthesiologists to learn and use this useful tool as an adjunct to physical examination. Ultrasound-guided peripheral nerve blockade and vascular access represent the most popular ultrasound applications in anesthesiology. Ultrasound has recently started to substitute for CT scans and fluoroscopy in many pain treatment procedures. Although the application of airway ultrasound is still limited, it has a promising future. Lung ultrasound is a well-established field in point-of-care medicine, and it could have a great impact if utilized in our ORs, as it may help in rapid and accurate diagnosis in many emergent situations. Optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) measurement and transcranial color coded duplex (TCCD) are relatively new neuroimaging modalities, which assess intracranial pressure and cerebral blood flow. Gastric ultrasound can be used for assessment of gastric content and diagnosis of full stomach. Focused transthoracic (TTE) and transesophageal (TEE) echocardiography facilitate the assessment of left and right ventricular function, cardiac valve abnormalities, and volume status as well as guiding cardiac resuscitation. Thus, there are multiple potential areas where ultrasound can play a significant role in guiding otherwise blind and invasive interventions, diagnosing critical conditions, and assessing for possible anatomic variations that may lead to plan modification. We suggest that ultrasound training should be part of any anesthesiology training program curriculum."
CD011436,0,25247912,0,Use of targeted transversus abdominus plane blocks in pediatric patients with anterior cutaneous nerve entrapment syndrome.,"Anterior cutaneous nerve entrapment syndrome (ACNES) is a commonly overlooked source of chronic abdominal wall pain. A diagnosis of ACNES should be considered in cases of severe, localized abdominal pain that is accentuated by physical activity. Providers should consider diagnosing ACNES once a patient has both a positive result from a Carnett's test and precise localization of pain. We describe the use of transversus abdominus plane (TAP) blocks to treat ACNES in the pediatric patient population. TAP blocks are a treatment modality which have been described less frequently in the management of this syndrome, with rectus sheath blocks being used more commonly. TAP blocks can be used effectively for ACNES by targeting the site of maximal tenderness, which was identified using ultrasound guidance. Moreover, TAP blocks are an attractive procedure option for ACNES as they are less invasive than other commonly used techniques. We present 3 case series reports of pediatric patients evaluated at our institution for severe abdominal pain to describe the clinical manifestations, sequelae, and outcome of ACNES. Though the exact incidence of ACNES in the pediatric population is unknown, this condition has significant implications from chronic pain. Chronic pain can lead to significant emotional and social impacts on these pediatric patients, as well as their on their families. Further, the extensive utilization of health care resources is impacted when children with undiagnosed ACNES undergo invasive treatments when ACNES is not in the early differential. The purpose of this case series report is to prompt better recognition of the condition ACNES, and to highlight the efficacy of TAP blocks as a management strategy."

What is the role of the ultrasound in this context?,"Caudal epidural anesthesia is the most popular regional anesthesia technique used in children. With advanced age, only the relative difficulty in localizing the sacral hiatus limits its use. However, in adults this technique has been widely used to control chronic pain by adjuvant use of fluoroscopy. Thus, the ability to locate the hiatus and define anatomical variations is the main determinant of the success and safety of caudal epidural anesthesia. In this context, the use of the ultrasound in caudal epidural anesthesia has been increasing. The objective of this review was to determine the role of the ultrasound in caudal epidural anesthesia and to demonstrate that this technique, widely used in children, is also useful and can be used in adults."

CD011436,0,24233333,0,Life-threatening QT prolongation in a boy with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder on atomoxetine.,"As a noncentral nerve-stimulating agent blocking reuptake of noradrenalin, atomoxetine is used for treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Because it has less potential for addiction and abuse and improves core symptoms of ADHD, it is commonly prescribed in many children and adolescents internationally. Its common side effects include headache, abdominal pain, decreased appetite, and weight loss. In addition, cardiac effects such as tachycardia and hypertension have also been reported. In this case report, an 11-year-old Japanese boy with a past medical history of ADHD on atomoxetine for more than 2 years presented with a loss of consciousness. Initial electrocardiogram (ECG) showed significant QT prolongation, and 9 h later, it worsened, along with bradycardia, inversed T waves, and multiple premature ventricle contractions (PVCs). Transthoracic echocardiography showed akinesis with dilation and systolic ballooning of the left ventricle's (LV) apical segment (Takotsubo cardiomyopathy). At that point, bisoprolol and transcutaneous pacing were started. After 5 days, transcutaneous pacing was discontinued due to improvement in his cardiac rhythm. He continued to remain asymptomatic for the next year, while his QT interval returned to normal. Conclusion: This case report suggests a serious side effect of atomoxetine, and to avoid life-threatening cardiovascular events for children and adolescents with ADHD on atomoxetine, prior screening for cardiovascular conditions by ECG with close monitoring is necessary."

Direct ultrasound visualisation was successful in all cases and was associated with significant improvements when compared with the use of nerve stimulation: lower visual analogue scores during puncture (p = 0.03), shorter mean (median) sensory onset times (9 (5-15) min vs. 15 (5-25) min, p < 0.001), longer sensory block durations (384 (280-480) min vs. 310 (210-420) min, p < 0.001), and better sensory and motor block scores 10 min after block insertion. Ultrasound visualisation offers faster sensory and motor responses and a longer duration of sensory blockade than nerve stimulation in children undergoing infraclavicular brachial plexus blocks. In addition, the pain associated with nerve stimulation due to muscle contractions at the time of insertion is eliminated."

CD011436,0,17040299,0,Ultrasonographic guidance in pediatric regional anesthesia. Part 2: techniques.,"The benefits of regional anesthesia are well documented. The downsides of such techniques have been a significant failure rate and a potential for serious complications. Nearly, all regional blocks were first described as essentially 'blind' techniques. The development of high-resolution portable ultrasound (US) has made the use of US for regional anesthesia possible. Improved understanding of sonographic anatomy should lessen both the failure rate and the possibility of incurring serious complications. Natural caution has dictated that only a selection of blocks used in adults has been commonly used in pediatric practice, but with the aid of US, the repertoire of blocks for infants and children may be widened. The second part of this review will concentrate on the practice of both peripheral and central blocks."

CD011436,0,12088971,0,New landmarks for the anterior approach to the sciatic nerve block: imaging and clinical study.,"In this study, we assessed the reliability of the inguinal crease and femoral artery as anatomic landmarks for the anterior approach to the sciatic nerve and determined the optimal position of the leg during this approach. An imaging study was conducted before the clinical study. The sciatic nerve was located twice in 20 patients undergoing ankle or foot surgery, once with the leg in the neutral position and once with the leg in the externally rotated position. The patient was lying supine. A 22-gauge, 150-mm insulated b-beveled needle connected to a nerve stimulator was inserted 2.5 cm distal to the inguinal crease and 2.5 cm medial to the femoral artery and was directed posteriorly and laterally with a 10 degrees -15 degrees angle relative to the vertical plane. The sciatic nerve was located in all patients at a depth of 10.6 +/- 1.8 cm when the leg was in the neutral position and 10.4 +/- 1.5 cm when the leg was in the externally rotated position (not significant). In the neutral position and in the externally rotated position, the time needed to identify anatomic landmarks was 28 +/- 15 s and 26 +/- 14 s, respectively (not significant), and the time needed to locate the sciatic nerve was 79 +/- 53 s and 46 +/- 25 s (P < 0.006), respectively. We conclude that the inguinal crease and femoral artery are reliable and effective anatomic landmarks for the anterior approach to the sciatic nerve and that the optimal position of the leg is the externally rotated position."

His hemogram and levels of proteins C and S and fibrinogen were normal, but the D-dimer level was higher than normal (2.57 mg/L; normal level 0-0.5 mg/L). Normal blood flow was indicated on color Doppler ultrasonography. The severe ischemia in the glans penis was successfully treated with subcutaneous injection of enoxaparin (low-molecular-weight heparin) for 5 days, and the appearance of the glans was close to normal on the fifth day.

CD011436,0,17952031,0,Ultrasound guidance for locoregional anesthesia: a review.,"Although regional anaesthesia has become safer, there are an increasing number of articles regarding complications of regional blocks. During the last few years, many authors have suggested the use of ultrasound to minimize the appearance of complications. This review was performed, through a Medline research, to evaluate articles concerning ultrasound and locoregional anaesthesia published until April 2005. A total of 39 articles were reviewed. Technical procedures, the use of ultrasound guidance in epidural anesthesia, the application of this technique for peripheral nerve blocks, and its indications in pregnancy and in pediatric patients were considered. In these articles, all of the authors focused on the advantages of ultrasound guidance. With the help of this technique, correct catheter placement as close to the target as possible was obtained; the spread of local anesthetic administered around the nerve and its roots can be visualized, reducing the doses needed; in addition, it is possible to avoid the most common complications, such as intravascular injection, dura mater puncture, hematoma formation, and nerve injury. Ultrasound guidance is useful in facilitating peripheral and neuroaxial blocks and offers direct visualization of the target, adjacent structures, and local anesthetic spread. The advantages also include a decreased rate of complications and faster onset of blocks. Finally, ultrasound measurements can even result in suggestions to modify established block technique."

CD011436,0,17174518,0,[Perioperative analgesia with continuous peripheral nerve blocks in children].,"Recently, regional anaesthesia in children has generated increasing interest. But single injection techniques have a limited duration of postoperative analgesia. Then, continuous peripheral nerve blocks have taken an important position in the anaesthetic arsenal, allowing an effective, safe and prolonged postoperative pain management. As adults, indications for continuous peripheral nerve blocks depend on the analysis of individual benefits/risks ratio. Main indications are intense postoperative pain surgical procedures, with or without postoperative rehabilitation, and complex regional pain syndrome. Contraindications to these procedures are rather similar to those in adults, plus parental and/or children refusal. Continuous peripheral nerve blocks are usually performed under general anaesthesia or sedation in children, and require appropriate equipment in order to decrease the risk of nerve injury. New techniques, such as transcutaneous nerve stimulation or ultrasound guidance, appeared to facilitate nerve and plexus approach identification in paediatric patients. Nevertheless, continuous peripheral nerve block may theoretically mask a compartment syndrome after trauma surgical procedures. Finally, ropivacaine appears to be the most appropriate drug for continuous peripheral nerve blocks in children, requiring low flow rates and concentrations of local anaesthetic. These techniques may facilitate early ambulation by an improved pain management or even postoperative analgesia at home with disposable pumps. One might infer from the current review that excellent pain relief coupled with a reduction of side effects would contribute to improve the quality of life and to decrease the frequency of disabling behavioural modifications in children, sometimes psychologically injured by hospital stay and postoperative pain."

As a regional anesthesia technique, the transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block has been shown to reduce opioid consumption and improve pain scores compared to traditional perioperative pain strategies. Accordingly, TAP blocks may be considered as an alternative to central neuraxial analgesia to optimize perioperative pain control. Advancements in ultrasound technology have further improved the reliability and safety profile of this technique. Despite growing recognition of the diverse clinical scenarios where TAP blocks may be of benefit, its use among pediatric anesthesiologists remains limited.

Various approaches are possible in a pre-, peri- and postoperative care setting: It is almost always possible to prepare the children for surgery on an outpatient basis. This allows for hospital admission the same day or the evening before the procedure. But a schedule needs to be established that includes a certain leeway for admission and preoperative fasting in order to cater for a flexible response to delays or cancelations on the surgical list. An efficient use of theatre time can only be assured if several anesthetists can work in parallel. This applies in particular to complex anesthetic inductions. Sufficient staff and facilities are a prerequisite for this. The use of ultrasound for vascular access and regional anesthesia raises the success rate and saves time. In the postoperative period good analgesia with a fixed therapeutic regime, immediate postoperative feeding and mobilization improve the care."

CD011436,0,15277302,0,Ultrasound guidance in regional anaesthesia.,"The technology and clinical understanding of anatomical sonography has evolved greatly over the past decade. In the Department of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care Medicine at the Medical University of Vienna, ultrasonography has become a routine technique for regional anaesthetic nerve block. Recent studies have shown that direct visualization of the distribution of local anaesthetics with high-frequency probes can improve the quality and avoid the complications of upper/lower extremity nerve blocks and neuroaxial techniques. Ultrasound guidance enables the anaesthetist to secure an accurate needle position and to monitor the distribution of the local anaesthetic in real time. The advantages over conventional guidance techniques, such as nerve stimulation and loss-of-resistance procedures, are significant. This review introduces the reader to the theory and practice of ultrasound-guided anaesthetic techniques in adults and children. Considering their enormous potential, these techniques should have a role in the future training of anaesthetists."
CD011436,0,24191378,0,Pediatric nerve blocks: an evidence-based approach.,"Successful injury management is often dependent upon optimal pain control. Many injuries do not require procedural sedation or systemic analgesia, and emergency clinicians have used peripheral nerve blocks for several decades for these injuries. Nerve blocks deliver anesthetic to the nerve that corresponds to the sensory innervation of the area where the wound or injury is located. In the pediatric setting, some nerve block modalities require modification to the approach and techniques commonly used in adult patients due to the age and weight of the child, the ability of the patient to cooperate, and the ability of the emergency clinician to observe pain response. Peripheral nerve blocks have a high rate of success for effective local anesthesia and a low rate of complications, making them an attractive option for analgesia in the management of some injuries. This evidence-based review summarizes the advantages and disadvantages of peripheral nerve blocks, reviews commonly used local anesthetics, describes the landmark technique for the most common nerve blocks used in pediatric emergency medicine, and presents literature on ultrasound-guided technology."

Patients were observed at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 24 h after surgery for tramadol consumption, cardiovascular variables and visual analogue scale pain scores at rest and on movement. The mean (SD) hourly tramadol consumption was significantly reduced in the lidocaine group compared with the saline group at 4 h (8.0 (10.1) mg vs 28.0 (12.6) mg, respectively; p = 0.001), 6 h (5.3 (10.8) mg vs 17.3 (12.7) mg, respectively; p = 0.013) and 8 h (5.3 (11.8) mg vs 21.3 (9.1) mg, respectively; p = 0.001). The cumulative 24-h tramadol consumption was 97.3 (16.6) mg in the lidocaine group and 150.6 (26.0) mg in the saline group (p = 0.001). There were significant differences in the pain visual analogue scale at rest at two time points; at 4 h the median (IQR [range]) visual analogue scale scores were 4 (4-6 [2-8]) in the lidocaine group and 5 (4-6 [2-7]) in the saline group (p = 0.03), and at 6 h visual analogue scale scores were 3 (3-4 [3-6]) and 4 (4-6 [2-7]), respectively (p = 0.04). Pain visual analogue scale on movement was lower in the lidocaine group at all time intervals compared with the saline group, but this did not reach statistical significance. The present study has demonstrated a postoperative tramadol-sparing and analgesic effect of pre-operative stellate ganglion block in patients undergoing upper limb orthopaedic surgery under general anaesthesia."
CD011436,0,21750097,0,What benefits does ultrasound-guided axillary block for brachial plexus anaesthesia offer over the conventional blind approach in hand surgery?,"Axillary block for brachial plexus anaesthesia is a popular anaesthetic technique for hand surgery with different approaches. We investigated the efficacy of the blind and ultrasound-guided approaches administered by a hand surgeon. A total of 141 patients were prospectively randomized to Group A without and Group B with ultrasound guidance. The principal variables evaluated were number of failures, duration of surgery, time to onset of anaesthesia, volume of anaesthetic injected, and complications. The success rate and the mean time to onset of anaesthesia were significantly better under ultrasound guidance. The duration of surgery and the rate of complications did not differ. Ultrasound-guided plexus anaesthesia is markedly more effective than the blind technique when performed by a hand surgeon."

CD011436,0,23293386,0,Recent developments in paediatric neuraxial blocks.,"Paediatric anaesthesia and paediatric regional anaesthesia are intertwined. Almost all surgeries unless contradicted could be and should be supplemented with a regional block. The main objective of this review is to elaborate on the recent advances of the central neuraxial blocks, such as application of ultrasound guidance and electrical stimulation in the pursuit of safety and an objective end point. This review also takes account of the traditional technique and understand the benefits as well the risk of each as compared with the recent technique. The recent trends in choosing the most appropriate peripheral block for a given surgery thereby sparing the central neuroaxis is considered. A penile block for circumcision or a sciatic block for unilateral foot surgery, rather than caudal epidural would have a better risk benefit equation. Readers will find a special mention on the recent thoughts on continuous epidural analgesia in paediatrics, especially its rise and fall, yet its unique importance. Lastly, the issue of block placements under sedation or general anaesthesia with its implication in this special population is dealt with. We conducted searches in MEDLINE (PubMed) and assessed the relevance of the abstracts of citations identified from literature searches. The search was carried out in English, for last 10 years, with the following key words: Recent advances in paediatric regional anaesthesia; ultrasound guidance for central neuraxial blocks in children; role of electrical stimulation in neuraxial blocks in children; complications in neuraxial block. Full-text articles of potentially relevant abstracts were retrieved for further review."

CD011436,0,19186024,0,[Ultrasound and regional anaesthesia].,"The use of ultrasound is the latest major evolution in regional anaesthesia. Review of available literature shows significant changes in clinical practice. Ultrasound guidance allows the visualization of anatomical variations or unsuspected intraneural injections, reduces the volume of local anaesthetic injections and confirms correct local anaesthetic distribution or catheter placement. No study has found a statistical difference in success rates and safety because all studies were underpowered. However, the ability to visualize an invasive procedure that has been performed blindly in the past is an undeniable progress in terms of safety. The necessity to be familiar with the machine and the learning curve can be repulsive. The aim of this article is to demystify ultrasound guidance by explaining the fundamentals of the clinical use of ultrasound. With the help of different chapters, the authors explain the different adjustments and possible artefacts and give easy solutions for the use of bedside ultrasound. Training is essential and can be performed on manikins or training phantom. For each region the main anatomical landmarks are explained. One must be familiar with several imaging techniques: short axis (transverse) or long axis (longitudinal) nerve imaging, in-plane or out-of-plane imaging and hydrolocalization. Viewing the needle's tip position during its progression remains the main safety endpoint. Therefore, electrical nerve stimulation and ultrasound guidance should be combined, especially for beginners, to confirm proximity to neural structures and to help in case of difficulty. Optimizing safety and clinical results must remain a key priority in regional anaesthesia. Finally, specific regulations concerning the transducers are described. Paediatric specificities are also mentioned."

Using high-resolution ultrasound, we examined the role of endothelial mediators in radial artery dilatation in response to transient (short period of reactive hyperemia) and sustained (prolonged period of reactive hyperemia, hand warming, or an incremental infusion of acetylcholine into the distal radial artery) hyperemia. After short episodes of reactive hyperemia, FMD was abolished by local infusion of the nitric oxide synthesis inhibitor N:(G)monomethyl-L-arginine (5.3+/-1.2% versus 0.7+/-0.7%, P:<0.001). In contrast, basal vessel diameter and dilatation after prolonged episodes of reactive hyperemia, hand warming, and distal infusion of acetylcholine were not attenuated by nitric oxide synthesis inhibition. Inhibition of cyclooxygenase or local autonomic nervous system blockade also had no effect on FMD. Patients with hypercholesterolemia exhibited reduced FMD in response to transient hyperemia, but the response to sustained hyperemia was normal. These data suggest heterogeneity of endothelial responses to blood flow that are dependent on the characteristics of the flow stimulus. Dilatation after brief episodes of hyperemia is mediated by release of nitric oxide, whereas dilatation during sustained hyperemia is unaffected by NO synthesis inhibition. Hypercholesterolemia seems to differentially affect these pathways with impairment of the nitric oxide-dependent pathway and preservation of non nitric oxide-mediated dilatation to sustained flow stimuli."
CD011436,0,25675289,0,Evidence for the Use of Ultrasound Imaging in Pediatric Regional Anesthesia: A Systematic Review.,"An earlier review to evaluate the quality and outcomes of studies assessing ultrasound imaging in regional anesthesia for the pediatric population considered articles published from 1994 to 2009 and showed some evidence in support of block-related outcomes (block onset, success, duration) and process-related outcomes (performance time, local anesthetic dose, and spread). At that time, strong evidence in the form of randomized controlled trials and well-designed prospective observational studies was limited, leading to a call for additional research. The current systematic review (2009-2014) compares and updates the evidence for ultrasound-guided pediatric regional anesthesia published since our last review. Using the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases, we included in this review studies examining ultrasound imaging for nerve localization in the pediatric population between 2009 and March 2014 (meta-analyses, systematic reviews, randomized controlled trials, controlled studies without randomization, observational studies, comparative studies, and case series involving at least 10 patients).

Methods This randomized study enrolled patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomies. They were randomized to two groups: group A received a 20 ml US-TAP block (50 mg bupivacaine +10 ml saline solution) and group B received a 30 ml US-TAP block (50 mg bupivacaine + 20 ml saline solution). The intraoperative consumption of remifentanil, the requirement for postoperative rescue analgesics, patient satisfaction scores, postoperative complications, and postoperative pain as measured by a visual analogue scale at 20 min, 12 h, and 24 h were recorded. Results A total of 60 patients enrolled in the study. There were no differences between the two groups with respect to demographic characteristics, duration of anaesthesia and patient satisfaction scores. The intraoperative consumption of remifentanil, postoperative VAS scores (20 min, 12 h and 24 h) and the requirement for postoperative analgesics were all significantly lower in group B who received a larger volume but a lower concentration of local anaesthetic solution compared with group A.

CD011436,0,18345720,0,Regional anesthesia for postoperative pain control in children: focus on continuous central and perineural infusions.,"Regional anesthesia is widely employed for postoperative pain control in both adults and children. Central or perineural approaches can be performed as a bolus injection or as a continuous infusion of local anesthetics. However, bolus injections, even with the addition of adjuvants, are inadequate for prolonged surgery and long-term pain control. Continuous infusion remains the technique of choice when there is a prolonged operation or intense postoperative pain. This article reviews the safety and efficacy of central and perineural continuous infusions for postoperative pain control in children. The literature confirms the very low rate of complications and adverse effects of regional anesthesia in children. However, clinicians need to be aware of the key points for performing a block and placing a catheter in children: good knowledge of anatomic and physiologic differences between adults and children is necessary; the use of newer local anesthetics, such as ropivacaine and levobupivacaine, increases the therapeutic window; and that it is mandatory to work with dedicated pediatric equipment. Through the use of new techniques such as nerve mapping and/or ultrasound the success of blocks can be improved and the risks reduced."

CD011436,0,26626896,0,Ultrasound-Guided Femoral Nerve Blocks.,"Pediatric acute femur fractures are a relatively common major orthopedic injury seen in emergency departments. Providing adequate and safe analgesia is essential while patients await definitive management of these fractures. Opioid medications are typically used to treat fracture-associated pain but have well-known adverse effects including respiratory and central nervous system depression, pruritus, nausea, and allergic reactions. Dose titration of opioids in pediatric patients may be difficult and requires frequent nursing and physician reassessments. Regional anesthesia using ultrasound guidance has been proposed as a reliable and safe method to provide pain relief for this population and to decrease reliance on opioid medications. There is a growing body of literature on the utility and safety of ultrasound-guided femoral nerve blocks for pediatric patients in the acute care setting. This review article covers recent literature on point-of-care ultrasound-guided femoral nerve blocks for pediatric patients, with a discussion of the indications, sonographic anatomy, selection of anesthetics, nerve block technique, and complications. This review supplements the expert supervision and practice required to gain competency."
