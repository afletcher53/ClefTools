CD008018,0,17002488,0,Gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog therapy for central precocious puberty and other childhood disorders affecting growth and puberty.,"Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analog therapy relies primarily on the ability of these compounds to bind to and modulate GnRH-receptor activity. GnRH analogs have been used in pediatric patients where endogenous gonadotropin release is undesirable or potentially harmful, such as in: (i) patients with central precocious puberty (CPP); (ii) healthy short children where pubertal delay would provide an opportunity to supplement pre-pubertal linear growth; and (iii) children with malignancies and other disorders where treatment requires the use of gonadotoxic compounds. In the first two groups of patients, GnRH agonists may be used alone or in conjunction with somatropin (growth hormone [GH]) to prevent early skeletal maturation and increase the subsequent adult height, while in the latter case, GnRH agonists are used alone or in conjunction with GnRH antagonists in an attempt to preserve gonadal function.In children and adolescents with CPP, timely use of GnRH agonists alone can result in an adult height within the genetic potential of the individual (target height); however, minimal height is gained when GnRH agonist therapy is commenced after a marked advancement of skeletal age. This provides the rationale for combined therapy with GnRH agonists and somatropin in such patients, and studies have shown improved growth with this approach compared with GnRH agonists alone. Combination therapy with GnRH agonists and somatropin has also been shown to increase adult heights to a greater extent than GnRH agonists alone in pediatric patients with concomitant CPP and GH deficiency, those with idiopathic short stature, and those born small for gestational age; however, such combination therapy has shown no increased benefit over somatropin alone in pediatric patients with GH deficiency. Limited results in children and adolescents with congenital adrenal hyperplasia and chronic primary hypothyroidism have also shown increased growth rates, while no growth benefit was seen in pediatric renal transplant recipients.GnRH analogs also have potential as gonadoprotective agents; studies of GnRH agonists used alone and in combination with GnRH antagonists in women undergoing cytotoxic therapy have shown increased preservation of reproductive potential in patients who were receiving GnRH analog therapy versus those who were not.The adverse effects of GnRH analogs mainly consist of menopausal-like complaints. Increases in bodyweight and body mass index in children receiving GnRH agonist therapy have been shown; however, these increases do not persist after discontinuation of therapy. Adult bone mineral density and fertility are also not adversely affected by childhood GnRH agonist therapy.GnRH analog therapy appears to be both well tolerated and effective in pediatric patients, as it allows the preservation or improvement of adult height, and shows no longstanding negative effects on body composition, bone density, reproductive function, or endocrine physiology. These agents may also be useful for preservation of gonadal function in children and adolescents undergoing cytotoxic therapy."

CD008018,0,8477775,0,The role of LHRH-analogues in protecting gonadal functions during chemotherapy and irradiation.,"Therapeutic success has focused attention on late effects in patients with testicular cancer, Hodgkin's disease, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and acute leukaemia. Since most patients with testicular cancer are young, the impact of cytotoxic chemotherapy on fertility and hormone deficiency has become particularly important. It has been shown that pulsatile secretion of luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) is a prerequisite for normal gonadal function. In contrast, non-pulsatile, chronic treatment with supraphysiological doses of LHRH-analogues (LHRHA) results in suppression of the pituitary-gonadal axis. It has been suggested that inhibition of spermatogenesis during exposure to cytotoxic drugs might reduce gonadal toxicity. The protective effects of LHRHA during chemotherapy or irradiation has been examined in 11 preclinical studies. In only 6 out of 11 models could protection be demonstrated. Four clinical trials have been performed using LHRHA as a gonadal protector. In none of these trials could LHRHA significantly influence severity and duration of germ cell impairment. New approaches are needed to minimize or even prevent gonadal toxicity during chemotherapy or irradiation, such as reduction of courses, alternative schedules, or new drugs."
CD008018,0,19301406,0,Fertility preservation medicine: a new field in the care of young cancer survivors.,"Treatment modalities for numerous oncological and non-oncological conditions result in gonadal insufficiency and infertility. Furthermore, pelvic-abdominal radiation may result in uterine damage resulting in poor reproductive outcomes such as preterm birth, low birth weight, and spontaneous abortion in adult survivors of childhood cancers. In response to the recognition of the impact of cancer treatments on fertility, several fertility preservation techniques have been developed. In prepubertal children, fertility preservation options are usually limited to ovarian cryopreservation because of sexual immaturity, but oocyte freezing can be performed in adolescent children. Two prospective randomized studies showed no benefit of gonadal suppression with GnRH analogs to preserve gonadal function and thus this treatment should not be recommended. For adult survivors of childhood cancer who experienced reproductive failure, third party reproduction techniques are highly successful."

CD008018,0,28444736,0,Selective progesterone receptor modulators (SPRMs) for uterine fibroids.,"Uterine fibroids are smooth muscle tumours arising from the uterus. These tumours, although benign, are commonly associated with abnormal uterine bleeding, bulk symptoms and reproductive dysfunction. The importance of progesterone in fibroid pathogenesis supports selective progesterone receptor modulators (SPRMs) as effective treatment. Both biochemical and clinical evidence suggests that SPRMs may reduce fibroid growth and ameliorate symptoms. SPRMs can cause unique histological changes to the endometrium that are not related to cancer, are not precancerous and have been found to be benign and reversible. This review summarises randomised trials conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of SPRMs as a class of medication for treatment of individuals with fibroids."

CD008018,0,17067704,0,Myocardial infarction complicating the initial phase of an ovarian stimulation protocol.,"Two previous reports have reported myocardial infarction during ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, a complication of controlled ovarian stimulation characterized by ascites, pleural effusion, hemoconcentration and an increased thromboembolic risk, but no association with the initial phase (before treatment with human chorionic gonadotropin) of a normal ovarian stimulation protocol for infertility has ever been described. We report the first case, to our knowledge, of acute myocardial infarction occurring during the initial phase of an otherwise uncomplicated ovarian stimulation protocol. A young woman with infertility associated to polycystic ovary syndrome was treated with leuprolide acetate and recombinant follicle stimulating hormone to induce ovarian stimulation for in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer. After 12 days the patient presented a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction, which was treated with aspirin, clopidogrel, enoxaparin, intravenous nitrates and beta blockers. Cardiac catheterization showed angiographically normal coronary arteries. Echocardiography showed a circumscribed akinesis of the inferior apical segment of the left ventricle and right ventricular apex, which was confirmed by cardiac magnetic resonance. A screening for thrombophilic diathesis was negative. The patient was discharged and remained asymptomatic at 1 and 3 months follow up. Further ovarian stimulations were excluded and a trial of oocyte retrieval on spontaneous cycle was planned. Myocardial infarction can complicate ovarian stimulation protocols for infertility even in their early phase without any sign of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome."

The mean age at the start of treatment was 8.7 years; the mean total dose of cyclophosphamide was 439 mg/kg body weight; and the mean follow-up time was 12.3 years. The investigations included detailed developmental, menstrual and fertility histories; general and gynaecological examinations; basal levels and follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone responses to gonadotropin-releasing hormone, and plasma oestradiol determinations. All patients had normal pubertal development and regular menstrual patterns. Two had borne healthy children. Although hormonal studies did not show obvious ovarian or pituitary-gonadal dysfunction, further follow-up is required to ascertain whether the patients with the most prolonged treatment undergo a premature menopause."

CD008018,0,11939160,0,The gonadotrophin-releasing hormone antagonist ganirelix--history and introductory data.,"The gonadotrophin-releasing hormone antagonist ganirelix has recently become available to clinicians. Its indication, prevention of premature luteinizing hormone surges in assisted reproduction programmes, has been investigated extensively in numerous studies. This article summarizes the major results from pharmacokinetics studies, a double-blind dose-finding trial and three large-scale phase III randomized clinical trials, comparing ganirelix and the most commonly used gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonists, buserelin,leuprolide and triptorelin, in a long protocol. It is concluded that controlled ovarian hyperstimulation with ganirelix offers significant advantages in terms of convenience of treatment as reflected in a considerably reduced treatment period.Safety and tolerance as well as overall clinical outcome are good."
CD008018,0,11836309,0,Endocrine profiles after triggering of final oocyte maturation with GnRH agonist after cotreatment with the GnRH antagonist ganirelix during ovarian hyperstimulation for in vitro fertilization.,"In a randomized multicenter study, the efficacies of two different GnRH agonists were compared with that of hCG for triggering final stages of oocyte maturation after ovarian hyperstimulation for in vitro fertilization. Ovarian stimulation was conducted by recombinant FSH (Puregon), and the GnRH antagonist ganirelix (Orgalutran) was coadministered for the prevention of a premature LH rise. Luteal support was provided by daily progestin administration. Frequent blood sampling was performed at midcycle in the first 47 eligible subjects included in the current study, who were randomized for a single dose of 0.2 mg triptorelin (n = 17), 0.5 mg leuprorelin (n = 15), or 10,000 IU hCG (n = 15). Serum concentrations of LH, FSH, E2, and progesterone (P) were assessed at variable intervals. LH peaked at 4 h after both triptorelin and leuprorelin administration, with median LH levels of 130 and 107 IU/liter (P < 0.001), respectively. LH levels returned to baseline after 24 h. Subjects receiving hCG showed peak levels of 240 IU/liter hCG 24 h after administration. A rise in FSH to 19 IU/liter (P < 0.001) was noted in both GnRH agonist groups 8 h after injection. Within 24 h the areas under the curve for LH and FSH were significantly higher (P < 0.001) in both GnRH agonist groups compared with that for hCG. E2 and P levels were similar for all groups up to the day of oocyte retrieval. Luteal phase areas under the curve for P and E2 were significantly elevated (P < 0.001) in the hCG group. The mean (+/-SD) numbers of oocytes retrieved were 9.8 +/- 5.4, 8.7 +/- 4.5, and 8.3 +/- 3.3; the percentages of metaphase II oocytes were 72%, 85%, and 86%; and fertilization rates were 61%, 62%, and 56% in the triptorelin, leuprorelin, and hCG group, respectively (P = NS for all three comparisons). These findings support the effective induction of final oocyte maturation in both GnRH agonist groups. In summary, after treatment with the GnRH antagonist ganirelix for the prevention of premature LH surges, triggering of final stages of oocyte maturation can be induced effectively by a single bolus injection of GnRH agonist, as demonstrated by the induced endogenous LH and FSH surge and the quality and fertilization rate of recovered oocytes. Moreover, corpus luteum formation is induced by GnRH agonists with luteal phase steroid levels closer to the physiological range compared with hCG. This more physiological approach for inducing oocyte maturation may represent a successful and safer alternative for in vitro fertilization patients undergoing ovarian hyperstimulation."

CD008018,0,24535045,0,Protection of ovarian function by GnRH agonists during chemotherapy: a meta-analysis.,"This meta-analysis was designed to assess the overall performance of GnRHa in preserving the ovarian function in young women undergoing chemotherapy. Electronic literature databases including Pubmed, MEDLINE, Cochrane library, Embase, CNKI and Wanfang were searched for articles published till November, 2013. The articles written in both Chinese and English were considered. Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were selected. Main Outcome Measure was evaluated by assessing the post‑chemotherapy ovarian function. A random-effects model was used to calculate the risk ratio (RR) and associated 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Out of the eight RCTs including 621 patients, 321 women were treated with GnRHa during chemotherapy, 9.66% of whom suffered premature ovarian failure (POF). On the other hand, 26.67% of the remaining 300 women suffered POF. More women treated without GnRHa experienced post-chemotherapy POF, yielding an RR of 0.45 [chemotherapy plus GnRHa vs. chemotherapy alone, 95% confidence interval (CI) (0.22, 0.92)].

CD008018,0,12069736,0,Clinical evaluation of three different gonadotrophin-releasing hormone analogues in an IVF programme: a prospective study.,"The efficacy and safety of short acting buserelin and nafarelin intranasal spray were compared to long acting leuprorelin depot intramuscular or subcutaneous injection in this prospective study of 157 women undergoing controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) for in-vitro fertilisation (IVF). Patients were allocated to three groups to receive buserelin 150 microg nasal spray three times daily (Group B), nafarelin nasal spray 400 microg twice daily (Group N), or leuprorelin depot 3.75 mg once by intramuscular or subcutaneous injection (Group L) for pituitary desensitisation prior to commencing COH with human menopausal gonadotrophins (hMG) according to the Centre's protocol. The mean (+/-S.D.) age (years) (32.6+/-3.8: Group B, 32.1+/-3.3: Group N versus 32.1+/-3.3: Group L); mean (+/-S.D.) total dosage of hMG (ampoules) (37.5+/-16.1: Group B, 39.8+/-14.2: Group N versus 41.9+/-12.6: Group L) and mean daily dosage of hMG (ampoules) (3.1: Group B, 2.8: Group N versus 3.0: Group L) seen were not statistically significantly different. The duration between starting the different gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRHa) and the beginning of the next menstrual period was also not seen to be statistically significantly different between the three groups (Group B: 10+/-5.5, Group N: 9.1+/-4.1 versus Group L: 8.2+/-3, days). The number of abandoned cycles was higher in Group L (17% versus 11.8%: Group B and 11.3%: Group N) but this difference did not reach statistical significance. The clinical pregnancy rates per oocyte retrieval and per embryo transfer procedure were respectively, 31.1, 35% in Group B, 12.8, 14% in Group N versus 20.5, 23.7 in Group L and were not seen to be statistically significantly different even when ongoing pregnancy rates were compared. Apart from a statistically significantly greater incidence of allergic nasal reactions in the nafarelin group (P=0.001), all other side-effects were not shown to be statistically significantly different between the three groups. We conclude that a single dose of leuprorelin depot can be considered to be as an equally effective alternative to multiple doses of buserelin or nafarelin for pituitary desensitisation in women undergoing COH for IVF."

Test for monitoring therapy in patients with gonadotropin dependent precocious puberty (GDPP). In seven patients of GDPP, who were treated with 11.25 mg depot leuprolide, the LH peak after subcutaneous (sc) test was compared with LH at hourly interval for 4 h after IM depot leuprolide for 13 tests and 3rd hour value for next ten tests. These two values were compared both before and after therapy. Before therapy, the mean +/- SD LH peak after subcutaneous leuprolide stimulation test was 20.6 +/- 7.85 IU/l (range 9.64-30.4 IU/l), and it was 27.3 +/- 12.21 IU/l 3 h after the first depot leuprolide injection (range 10.5-45.4 IU/l). During therapy, the mean +/- SD of LH peak after sc stimulation test was 1.96 +/- 0.75 IU/l (range 1.1-3.1 IU/l), and it was 2.58 +/- 0.54 IU/l (range 1.4-3.4 IU/l) 3 h after depot leuprolide injection. Three-hour LH value following IM depot leuprolide injection (11.25 mg) can be used for monitoring therapy in patients with GDPP because of its convenience and cost effectiveness."
CD008018,0,22839999,0,S-protected thiolated chitosan: synthesis and in vitro characterization.,"Purpose of the present study was the generation and evaluation of novel thiolated chitosans, so-named S-protected thiolated chitosans as mucosal drug delivery systems. Stability of all conjugates concerning swelling and disintegration behavior as well as drug release was examined. Mucoadhesive properties were evaluated in vitro on intestinal mucosa. Different thiolated chitosans were generated displaying increasing amounts of attached free thiol groups on the polymer, whereby more than 50% of these thiol groups were linked with 6-mercaptonicotinamide. Based on the implementation of this hydrophobic residue, the swelling behavior was 2-fold decreased, whereas stability was essentially improved. Their mucoadhesive properties were 2- and 14-fold increased compared to corresponding thiolated and unmodified chitosans, respectively. Release studies out of matrix tablets comprising the novel conjugates revealed a controlled release of a model peptide. Accordingly, S-protected thiomers represent a promising type of mucoadhesive polymers for the development of various mucosal drug delivery systems."
CD008018,0,8426860,0,Effects of hormone therapy on the endometrium.,"Hormone therapy induces a variety of histologic changes in the endometrium. Histologic patterns encountered in the most commonly used hormonal regimens are described. Oral contraceptives are associated with inactive, atrophic, or pseudosecretory glands and edematous stroma, decidual reaction without spiral arterioles, and stromal granulocytes. A high-potency progesterone may induce marked stromal and vascular hyperplasia and stromal myomatous nodules. Ovulation induction therapy accelerates the maturation of the stroma and is often associated with a discrepancy between the glands showing early secretory changes and an edematous, decidualized stroma. Hormone replacement therapy may stimulate endometrial proliferation if estrogens are used alone and produce endometrial hyperplasia and neoplasia. When estrogen and progesterone regimens are used, a wide range of histologic pattern may be found in various combinations: proliferative and secretory endometrium, glandular and adenomatous hyperplasia, stromal hyperplasia and decidual transformation, glandular metaplasia, atrophic endometrium, and any of the above with endometrial atrophy. Progesterone therapy for endometrial hyperplasia and neoplasia is followed by secretory changes of the endometrium, mostly subnuclear vacuoles, decidual reaction, and sometime squamoid ""morules."" Secretory changes seen after progesterone therapy in the endometrium do not rule out residual carcinoma. For hormone therapy for breast carcinoma, tamoxifen acts as an antiestrogen on the breast but often acts as an estrogen agonist on the endometrium; tamoxifen therapy may be associated with endometrial hyperplasia, polyps, adenomyosis, adenomatous hyperplasia, and adenocarcinoma."

CD008018,0,26178334,0,The Role of Ovarian Suppression in Premenopausal Women With Hormone Receptor-Positive Early-Stage Breast Cancer.,"The optimal adjuvant endocrine therapy in premenopausal women with early-stage breast cancer is yet to be elucidated. Studies have demonstrated that women who experience cessation of ovarian function after chemotherapy (chemotherapy-induced amenorrhea) may experience improved survival. These findings, however, have not been replicated when pharmacologic or surgical interventions have been used to stop ovarian function (eg, gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists, oophorectomy, or ovarian irradiation) in combination with an endocrine agent such as tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor. Recent large phase III clinical trials, including the Austrian Breast and Colorectal Cancer Study Group trial (ABCSG-12), Suppression of Ovarian Function Trial (SOFT), and Tamoxifen and Exemestane Trial (TEXT), did not demonstrate an improvement in disease-free survival with ovarian suppression in the overall population. However, subgroup analyses suggest that women at high risk for recurrence, including very young women or those who have received chemotherapy, may benefit from the addition of ovarian suppression. Still, toxicity and adverse effects on patient-reported outcomes were more frequent in patients who received ovarian suppression; these included more menopausal and sexual dysfunction symptoms, diabetes, hypertension, and osteoporosis. This review will summarize the experience with ovarian suppression in the adjuvant setting for the treatment of premenopausal early-stage breast cancer and offer recommendations for clinical management."
CD008018,0,28118721,0,[Pregnancy after Treatment of Breast Cancer].,"Thanks to improvement in cancer patients treatment results, growing attention has been paid to fertility issues. Physicians should discuss infertility risk and the possibilities of fertility preservation with all patients in reproductive age as soon as possible. Pregnancy in cancer survivors after adequate treatment should not be discouraged, including patients with endocrine-sensitive breast cancer. Embryo and oocyte cryopreservation are standard strategies for fertility cryopreservation. Several randomized clinical trials have addressed the role of LHRHa (luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogs) as a way of fertility preservation with conflicting results. A meta-analysis of clinical trials, including also the largest trials POEMS and PROMISE, showed higher odds of achieving pregnancy. These data suggest that giving LHRHa before and during adjuvant chemotherapy could also be a reliable strategy to preserve ovarian function and fertility. The use of ovarian stimulating drugs in standard treatment protocols for ovarian stimulation in female cancer patients is safe according to current data. The meta-analysis of 14 studies did not show negative influence of pregnancy on overall survival of female cancer patients although the optimal interval between breast cancer diagnosis and pregnancy is not known. However, breast cancer patients are in higher risk of preterm labor and low birth weight of infants.Key words: breast neoplasms - fertility preservation - ovarian stimulation - LHRH - pregnancy - tamoxifen - aromatase inhibitors - adjuvant hormonal therapyThis work was supported by MEYS - NPS I - LO1413.The authors declare they have no potential conflicts of interest concerning drugs, products, or services used in the study.The Editorial Board declares that the manuscript met the ICMJE recommendation for biomedical papers.Submitted: 3. 8. 2016Accepted: 11. 8. 2016."

CD008018,0,1479003,0,Pituitary-ovarian suppression by the standard and half-doses of D-Trp-6-luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone depot.,"A total of 20 women with regular menstrual cycles normal ovulatory function were randomized to receive 3.75 mg or 1.87 mg of D-Trp-6-luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) in microcapsules either in the early follicular phase (day 2) or during the mid-luteal phase (day 21) of the menstrual cycle. Pituitary--ovarian function was studied by sequential plasma measurements of oestradiol, follicle stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone and progesterone. Our results show that the full, standard dose (3.75 mg) of D-Trp-6-LHRH depot and the half-dose (1.87 mg) were equally effective in their desensitizing action, and that desensitization occurs more rapidly with early follicular phase administration of the analogue."
CD008018,0,2533217,0,Endocrine profiles and luteal function during GnRH-analogue/HMG therapy.,"We have found a significant improvement of pregnancy rates after pretreatment with an agonist of gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH-a). The pregnancy rate in patients treated with HMG/HCG was 17% per patient and 5.5% per cycle, in patients treated with buserelin, 25% per patient and 15% per cycle and in the triptorelin group 25% per patient and 22% per cycle. From 740 HMG/HCG cycles without GnRH-a only 66% were sufficient according to the analytical data. In 16% we found a premature LH discharge and in 18% an irregular LH fluctuation during stimulation. It is clear that gonadotrophin stimulation during pituitary suppression provokes a more intense ovarian reaction with respect to the number of follicles, as well as the endocrine activity. There are also some important practical advantages: ovarian stimulation can be started without any respect to a definite time of menstruation or of the cycle. Of further importance is the much greater flexibility in the timing of HCG administration. Finally, it will be favourable for all patients who need ovulation induction, especially for oocyte retrieval for IVF or GIFT, because no cycle has to be cancelled."
CD008018,0,3105906,1,Failure to preserve fertility in patients with Hodgkin's disease.,"The hypothesis that the ""down-regulated"" gonad is less vulnerable to the effects of cytotoxic chemotherapy for advanced Hodgkin's disease has been investigated. Thirty men and eighteen women were randomly allocated to receive an agonist analogue of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone prior to, and for the duration of, cytotoxic chemotherapy. Buserelin (d-Ser-[TBU]6 LHRH ethylamide) was prescribed in two different dosage schedules to twenty men, and in a single dosage schedule to eight women. A standard gonadotrophin-releasing hormone test (GnRH 100 micrograms) was performed 1 week prior to and on day 1 of each cycle of chemotherapy. In all patients peak luteinizing hormone responses to GnRH were suppressed throughout treatment. The higher of the two dosage schedules used in the men caused more effective suppression of luteinizing hormone, and both regimens led to an initial suppression of peak follicle-stimulating hormone responses to GnRH, which was not maintained. At follow-up assessment up to 3 years from the completion of treatment, all men treated with buserelin were profoundly oligospermic and four of the eight women were amenorrhoeic. All ten male controls were profoundly oligospermic, and six of nine female controls were amenorrhoeic. In the dosages and schedules investigated, buserelin was ineffective in conserving fertility."
CD008018,0,28145651,0,Serum Anti-Müllerian Hormone Levels in Precocious Puberty Girls according to Stage of GnRH Agonist Treatment.,"Few studies have investigated the long-term effects of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist treatment on the reproductive function of central precocious puberty (CPP) girls. In this cross-sectional study, we assessed the ovarian function by analyzing the serum anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) levels of CPP girls. Our study included 505 CPP girls subdivided into 5 groups according to the GnRH agonist treatment stage: group A (before treatment, n = 98), group B (3 months after initiation, n = 103), group C (12 months after initiation, n = 101), group D (24 months after initiation, n = 101), and group E (6 months after discontinuation, n = 102). We compared the serum AMH levels of the CPP girls with those of 100 bone age-matched controls (before treatment: n = 55; after discontinuation: n = 45). At baseline, the mean AMH level of the CPP girls was 5.9 ± 3.6 ng/mL. The mean AMH level after 3 months of the GnRH agonist treatment was lower (4.7 ± 3.2 ng/mL, P = 0.047) than that at baseline and recovered after 12 months of treatment. Six months after discontinuation, the AMH levels were similar to those at pre-treatment. Before and after the GnRH agonist treatment, the AMH levels were similar to those of the bone age-matched controls. In the precocious puberty girls, the AMH levels based on the GnRH agonist treatment stage were all within the normal reference range. The results of this study suggest that GnRH agonist treatment has no adverse effects on the reproductive function."
CD008018,0,17457668,0,Controversies in preservation of ovary function and fertility in patients with breast cancer.,"Improved treatment of breast cancer in premenopausal patients increased survival rates, but the therapy may influence fertility and ovarian function. Currently there is a big public and individual interest of breast cancer affected women in preservation of ovarian function and fertility. Chemotherapy induced amenorrhea (CIA) has many objective (osteoporosis, cardiovascular, urogenital atrophy, cognitive etc.) and subjective (hot flushes, sleep disturbances, change of mood etc.) consequences. In patients with breast cancer who wish to avoid a CIA and to preserve their fertility ovarian protection by GnRH agonists, cryopreservation of operative sampled ovarian tissue or obtained fertilized or non-fertilized eggs after stimulation and puncture or embryos after in vitro fertilization are technically possible. However there are no evidence-based recommendations for preservation of fertility or ovarian function in breast cancer patients. Except the cryopreservation of embryos all other procedures are experimental. It is also undefined who is going to carry the costs. Moreover, there are recent data that the reappearance of ovarian hormones may stimulate occult tumor cells in hormone sensitive breast cancer. Therefore it seems necessary to inform breast cancer patients about the possible negative effects of preservation of ovarian function."

CD008018,0,12708756,0,Dynamic tests and FSH biological activity in female rats with acute nephrotic syndrome.,"To investigate the pituitary-ovarian status during the acute state of the nephrotic syndrome, a sequence of experiments were undertaken in adult female rats after a single dose of the puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN). The functional condition of the hypophyseal-ovarian unit was determined in control and nephrotic rats by two dynamic tests. In the first one, 10 days after PAN or placebo administration female rats were stimulated with LHRH (300 ng/100 g body wt) and samples were collected at 0, 20, 40, 60 and 80 min after releasing factor administration. The second dynamic test, which was performed in control and nephrotic rats, consists of one (day 10 after PAN) or four (between days 7-10 after PAN) doses of hCG (8 UI), respectively. In all cases, serum samples were collected on day 10. In addition, the relative in vitro biological activity of FSH from control and nephrotic rats before and after LHRH stimulus was determined. The results reveal that after a stimulatory dose of LHRH the secretion of LH was significantly diminished in nephrotic rats at all registered times. By contrast, normal response was observed in terms of FSH secretion in nephrotic females. On the other hand, no ovarian response, in terms of progesterone or estradiol synthesis, was observed in nephrotic rats after either one or four stimuli with hCG Interestingly, in spite of the normal or high concentrations of FSH, the biological activity of FSH was totally abolished in nephrotic rats. On the whole, the results from this study indicate that the nephrotic syndrome had a harmful effect on the pituitary-ovarian unit, and strongly suggest that the endocrine dysfunction could be initiated at the hypophysial level; even though a specific ovarian damage is also predictable."

CD008018,0,1755767,0,Preventing breast cancer: is it possible?,"Breast cancer is a common cause of suffering and death in Australia. Improvements in detection and therapy will make only small inroads into mortality, and will not reduce suffering. Reducing the incidence of breast cancer by preventive measures is a logical step, and this paper reviews how it might be achieved. Reducing the population's exposure to known risk factors for breast cancer is logical; however, the potential for improvement is limited. Reduction in age at first pregnancy is impractical and measures such as weight reduction and reducing consumption of fat and alcohol are likely to be only partially successful. Increasing activity in youth is a concept that requires further investigation, but is a possible area of promise. Exogenous hormone use probably contributes little to the incidence of breast cancer, but prescribing patterns for post-menopausal oestrogens are changing and require monitoring. The use of hormone manipulation to prevent breast cancer has considerable potential benefit. Two approaches have been proposed. The first involves reversible suppression of ovarian function by luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists after child-bearing has finished, combined with low-dose conjugated equine oestrogen to compensate for oestrogen loss. The other involves the use of the anti-oestrogen, tamoxifen. Both measures have the potential to halve breast cancer incidence. There is some evidence that non-hormonal chemoprevention is possible, but clinical trial data are lacking."

CD008018,0,8388429,0,[The effect of etoposide on ovarian function in patients with gestational trophoblastic disease].,"Thirty-four patients with low risk gestational trophoblastic disease were treated with etoposide alone. Within 60 days after treatment, synthetic luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LH-RH: 100 micrograms) was injected intravenously. The serum concentrations of LH, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) before and 30, 60, 120 minutes after LH-RH administration, estradiol (E2) and progesterone were measured. In addition, the basal body temperature (BBT) was taken continuously to evaluate ovulation. (1) The patients aged 40 or more in whom serum LH and FSH levels were higher before LH-RH administration, showed excessive response to LH-RH. These excessive responses were 45.5% and 7.1% in patients in their thirties and twenties, respectively. (2) Serum E2 and progesterone levels decreased with advanced age, which was not affected by total doses of etoposide. (3) Seven (77.8%) patients over 40 years were found to have anovulatory cycles, based on their BBT, and ovulation was confirmed in all the patients under 40 years.

CD008018,0,7533699,0,"Leuprorelin. A review of its pharmacology and therapeutic use in prostatic cancer, endometriosis and other sex hormone-related disorders.","Leuprorelin (leuprolide acetate) is a gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogue used to treat a wide range of sex hormone-related disorders including advanced prostatic cancer, endometriosis and precocious puberty. It acts primarily on the anterior pituitary, inducing a transient early rise in gonadotrophin release. With continued use, leuprorelin causes pituitary desensitisation and/or down-regulation, leading to suppressed circulating levels of gonadotrophins and sex hormones. Clinical trials in men with advanced prostatic cancer demonstrate that leuprorelin (usually monthly depot injections of 3.75 or 7.5 mg) is less likely to cause serious adverse cardiovascular effects than diethylstilbestrol, and has comparable efficacy to bilateral orchiectomy or other GnRH analogues. Therefore, the choice between leuprorelin and orchiectomy may be made on the basis of the patient's treatment preference, along with specific patient characteristics and cost implications. Monthly intramuscular or subcutaneous administration of depot leuprorelin 3.75 mg was superior to placebo, and comparable to oral danazol 800 mg/day or intranasal buserelin 900 micrograms/day, in achieving objective and subjective responses in women with endometriosis. Thus, leuprorelin is an effective alternative to other treatments for women with endometriosis, but the recommended duration of its use in this clinical setting is limited to 6 months because it reduces bone mineral density. In children with central precocious puberty, leuprorelin (usually monthly intramuscular or subcutaneous injections of depot leuprorelin 3.75 to 15mg) decreases mean growth velocity and signs of sexual maturation and increases predicted adult height compared with baseline measurements. Although effects on final adult height are predicted from available data and require confirmation in long term follow-up studies, the absence of effective alternatives to GnRH analogues makes leuprorelin a first-line therapy for children with this rare disease. In women with uterine leiomyomata, monthly intramuscular administration of depot leuprorelin 3.75 mg for 6 months markedly reduces uterine volume and fibroid-related symptoms, but, as with other GnRH analogues, these effects dissipate following discontinuation of the drug. As adjuvant therapy in women undergoing in vitro fertilisation or gamete intrafallopian transfer, leuprorelin (usually 0.5 to 1 mg/day subcutaneously) reduces the risk of cancelled cycles for oocyte retrieval by preventing premature luteinisation. While some studies demonstrate an improvement in intermediate end-points such as increased number of mature oocytes retrieved and embryos available for transfer, a significant effect has not been demonstrated on the rate of live births per stimulated cycle.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

The stages of endometriosis (I-IV) were classified according to the revised American Fertility Society recommendations (AFS criteria) via pelviscopy before and after 6 months of treatment. Fifty-eight second-look pelviscopies were performed with the following objective changes after (before) treatment: Stage IV 0 (3); Stage III, 2 (13); Stage II, 12 (30); Stage I, 19 (12). Twenty-five patients presented with Stage 0 after therapy and were healed. All 57 symptomatic patients showed a subjective response to Zoladex therapy with a significant decrease of the total pelvic symptom score. Thirty-eight patients with infertility wished to become pregnant and so far 16 (40%) have conceived. During therapy, the serum concentrations of luteinizing hormone, follicle stimulating hormone, estradiol and progesterone were significantly suppressed. All patients were amenorrhoeic after 1-2 injections. Restoration of ovarian function with resumption of menstruation occurred within 57-92 days after the last injection of Zoladex (1-2 months after end of treatment). Side-effects were minimal and were those expected of the hypo-oestrogenic state, such as hot flushes, vaginal dryness and decrease of libido."
CD008018,0,14659128,0,Adjuvant endocrine therapy for the very young patients.,"Breast cancer is rare before age 40. Sixty to seventy percent of breast cancers in this age group express estrogen or progesterone receptors. All following considerations refer to endocrine responsive disease. Ovarian ablation reduces the relative risk of recurrence and death by at least one quarter in the absence of chemotherapy. Chemotherapy induced amenorrhea reduces the risk of recurrence and death when compared to patients with continuing menses. Chemotherapy is insufficient therapy for very young patients with hormone responsive disease, particularly if chemotherapy fails to induce amenorrhea. Tamoxifen is effective in young patients even in combination with chemotherapy. The ablation or suppression of ovarian function was equivalent to chemotherapy in at least eight randomized trials. Preliminary evidence is compatible with an additional adjuvant effect of LHRH agonists after chemotherapy, particularly in women < 40 years of age. Young patients with endocrine responsive tumors should be treated on a clinical trial. If this is impossible, they should receive tamoxifen and either an LHRH agonist or chemotherapy or both."
CD008018,0,8916982,0,Should add-back therapy for endometriosis be deferred for optimal results?,"Add-back hormone replacement therapy has been shown to alleviate some of the hypo-oestrogenic side effects associated with gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonists, including demineralisation of bone. Studies on patients with uterine fibroids have shown that concomitant add-back therapy reduced the efficacy of these agents, but that deferred administration was less detrimental. This trial set out to investigate if deferred add-back therapy could offer any advantages to patients with endometriosis compared with immediate therapy. Zoladex [goserelin acetate (3.6 mg every 4 weeks)] was given for 24 weeks either with placebo, with medrogestone (10 mg/day) for 24 weeks (immediate add-back therapy), or with placebo for 12 weeks followed by medrogestone (10 mg/day) for 12 weeks (deferred add-back therapy) to 123 patients. The number of responders measured using the Revised American Fertility Society score (decrease in this score of > or = 50%) was greatest in the immediate add-back therapy group, although there were no significant differences between groups. All three treatment groups showed significant decreases in bone mineral density compared with baseline but smaller losses were generally observed in the add-back groups. A significantly smaller number of patients in the immediate add-back group reported hot flushes during the first 12 weeks of treatment compared with the deferred add-back group. In conclusion, it appears that there is no extra advantage to patients with endometriosis being treated with goserelin in delaying the start of add-back therapy."

CD008018,0,16111461,0,Use of goserelin in the treatment of breast cancer.,"Gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs are, alongside tamoxifen, one of the most commonly used drugs in the treatment of pre-/perimenopausal endocrine-responsive breast cancer. Goserelin, as a principal agent of this class of drugs, is mainly investigated in clinical trials. The indirect comparison of goserelin with tamoxifen as a single drug in the adjuvant setting showed similar efficacy. Furthermore, goserelin is as effective as cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil chemotherapy, and total endocrine blockade as a combination of gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog and tamoxifen showed a comparable benefit with anthracycline-containing adjuvant chemotherapy. Goserelin administered after cessation of chemotherapy leads to a further improvement and may be equieffective as tamoxifen or a combination of both. Data concerning taxane-based and dose-dense chemotherapy as well as combination of gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs with third-generation aromatase inhibitors are still lacking (ongoing suppression of ovarian function, tamoxifen and exemestane, and premenopausal endocrine-responsive chemotherapy trials). Moreover, duration of therapy with gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs (2-3 years or longer) is still a matter of debate. Palliative endocrine treatment is standard in the first-line therapy of patients without life-threatening disease and endocrine-responsive breast cancer. Treatment decisions depend upon adjuvant endocrine pretreatment. Clinical data regarding ovarian protection by synchronous use of gonadotropin-releasing hormone in young breast cancer patients receiving chemotherapy are incoherent."

CD008018,0,17970643,0,Leuprolide acetate: a drug of diverse clinical applications.,"Leuprolide acetate is a synthetic nonapeptide that is a potent gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor (GnRHR) agonist used for diverse clinical applications, including the treatment of prostate cancer, endometriosis, uterine fibroids, central precocious puberty and in vitro fertilization techniques. As its basic mechanism of action, leuprolide acetate suppresses gonadotrope secretion of luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone that subsequently suppresses gonadal sex steroid production. In addition, leuprolide acetate is presently being tested for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, polycystic ovary syndrome, functional bowel disease, short stature, premenstrual syndrome and even as an alternative for contraception. Mounting evidence suggests that GnRH agonist suppression of serum gonadotropins may also be important in many of the clinical applications described above. Moreover, the presence of GnRHR in a multitude of non-reproductive tissues including the recent discovery of GnRHR expression in the hippocampi and cortex of the human brain indicates that GnRH analogs such as leuprolide acetate may also act directly via tissue GnRHRs to modulate (brain) function. Thus, the molecular mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effect of GnRH analogs in the treatment of these diseases may be more complex than originally thought. These observations also suggest that the potential uses of GnRH analogs in the modulation of GnRH signaling and treatment of disease has yet to be fully realized."

The therapeutic results of 198 patients, gathered from 5 university institutions and two city hospitals, are reported. Endometriosis was classified by the revised American Fertility Society score (r-AFS) before and at the end of treatment. Serum levels of LH, FSH, prolactin, estradiol, progesterone, androstenedione, testosterone and leuprorelin acetate were determined by radioimmunoassay. The mean total r-AFS score changed as follows: before surgical intervention during first-look laparoscopy 21 +/- 24 at the end of first-look laparoscopy 15 +/- 19 at the end of the GnRH-treatment 8 +/- 14 During leuprorelin acetate treatment the r-AFS stages changed as follows: [table; see text] Using the scoring system 85.2% of the patients improved. Relief of dysmenorrhoea could be achieved in 95.4%, relief of dyspareunia in 64% and of pelvic pain in 69.4% of patients. Baseline hormone levels dropped sharply during treatment. [table; see text] Androstenedione, testosterone, blood pressure, body weight, haematological parameters, liver enzymes, creatinine, electrolytes and HDL-/LDL-cholesterin remained more or less unchanged. Side effects being hot flushes, sweating, sleeplessness, headache, nausea, depression and vaginal dryness were due to estradiol deprivation. In 135 patients resumption of menstruation occurred in 95.6% within the first three months post-treatment. 23 patients of whom 21 were judged as infertile, became pregnant immediately after treatment was finished. The study results confirm the efficacy of leuprorelin acetate depot in the treatment of even advanced stages of endometriosis."

To investigate if co-treatment with a combination of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist and GnRH antagonist may be useful in preserving ovarian function and fertility in younger women during chemotherapy, we prospectively observed nine young patients receiving different chemotherapies for various malignant diseases and other severe medical conditions who also received simultaneous GnRH agonist and GnRH antagonist. Mean age of the patients was 26.56 +/- 8.78 years, all were < or =35 years old. Eight (88.9%) patients regained normal basal hormonal profile within 3 - 6 months after the completion of chemotherapy. Median level of follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone and estradiol was 6.3 +/- 8.8 U/l, 8.2 +/- 25.4 U/l and 118.0 +/- 130.8 pg/ml, respectively. Eight (88.9%) patients resumed spontaneous menses within 3 - 11 months following discontinuation of chemotherapy.

CD008018,0,22028996,0,Gonadotropin releasing hormone agonists: Expanding vistas.,"Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists are derived from native GnRH by amino acid substitution which yields the agonist resistant to degradation and increases its half-life. The hypogonadotropic hypogonadal state produced by GnRH agonists has been often dubbed as ""pseudomenopause"" or ""medical oophorectomy,"" which are both misnomers. GnRH analogues (GnRH-a) work by temporarily ""switching off"" the ovaries. Ovaries can be ""switched off"" for the therapy and therapeutic trial of many conditions which include but are not limited to subfertility, endometriosis, adenomyosis, uterine leiomyomas, precocious puberty, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, chronic pelvic pain, or the prevention of menstrual bleeding in special clinical situations. Rapidly expanding vistas of usage of GnRH agonists encompass use in sex reassignment of male to female transsexuals, management of final height in cases of congenital adrenal hyperplasia, and preserving ovarian function in women undergoing cytotoxic chemotherapy. Hypogonadic side effects caused by the use of GnRH agonists can be tackled with use of ""add-back"" therapy. Goserelin, leuprolide, and nafarelin are commonly used in clinical practice. GnRH-a have provided us a powerful therapeutic approach to the treatment of numerous conditions in reproductive medicine. Recent synthesis of GnRH antagonists with a better tolerability profile may open new avenues for both research and clinical applications. All stakeholders who are partners in women's healthcare need to join hands to spread awareness so that these drugs can be used to realize their full potential."

CD008018,0,9524560,0,Hormonal stimulation of the recovery of spermatogenesis following chemo- or radiotherapy. Review article.,"Radiation and chemotherapeutic drugs produce prolonged depression of sperm counts in rodents and humans. Previously, three approaches have been developed in experimental animals that have had some success in preventing or reversing this toxicity. These approaches included pretreatment with hormones that suppress spermatogenesis, stimulation of stem cell number, and supplementation with testosterone. A different rationale for the ability of particular hormonal treatments to reverse prolonged azoospermia is presented in this review. In many cases prolonged azoospermia occurs even though the stem spermatogonia survive the toxic insult, but the differentiation of these spermatogonia to produce sperm fails. In the rat, the block appears to be at the differentiation of the A spermatogonia. Hormone treatments with testosterone or with GnRH agonists, which suppress intratesticular testosterone levels, relieve this block and result in the production of differentiating cells. When the hormone treatment is stopped the production of differentiating cells continues, mature sperm are produced, and fertility is restored. If a similar mechanism can be demonstrated to hold in humans, the fertility of men who have been rendered infertile by treatments for testicular and other cancers could be improved."

It is well known that cytotoxic treatment may accelerate depletion of the primordial follicle pool leading to impaired fertility and premature menopause. Aim of this study is to identify patient candidates for fertility preservation strategies. We report our experience in preservation of fertility for four patients affected by MOGCT, referred to San Raffaele Hospital Oncofertility Unit. All patients received fertility sparing surgery plus platinum-based chemotherapy. Two patients were affected by mixed germ cell tumors and two by disgerminomas. After 24 months from the end of treatment, serum AMH levels have been measured. We report lower serum anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) levels in our patients than in healthy general population as serum AMH levels were under the 25th age-specific percentiles. Fertility preservation, in terms of oocytes cryopreservation, was offered to those two patients with serum AMH levels predictive of significantly poor ovarian reserve (1st and 2nd patients). Using the gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist protocol for ovarian stimulation, we obtained two and six oocytes, respectively. Therefore, serum AMH, as a marker of ovarian function, can improve the identification of patients that need to be referred to fertility preservation strategies."

Traditionally, short-acting analogues have been employed because of concerns over long-acting depot preparations causing profound suppression and luteal phase defects adversely affecting pregnancy and miscarriage rates. We randomized 60 IVF patients to receive a short-acting GnRHa, nafarelin or buserelin, or to receive a depot formulation, leuprorelin, all commenced in the early follicular phase and compared their effects on hormonal suppression and clinical outcome. We found that on day 15 of administration there was a significant difference in the suppression of oestradiol from initial concentrations, when patients on buserelin were compared with patients on nafarelin or leuprorelin (54 versus 72 and 65%; P < 0.05) and also in the number of patients satisfactorily suppressed, (80 versus 90 and 90%; P < 0.05), though there were no differences between the analogues by day 21. Similarly there was no difference in hormonal suppression during the stimulation phase or in implantation, pregnancy or miscarriage rates in comparing the three agonists. We conclude that with nafarelin and leuprorelin, stimulation with gonadotrophins may begin after 2 weeks of suppression and that long-acting GnRHa are as effective as short-acting analogues with no detrimental effects on the luteal phase."

Suppression on estrogen release is the fundamental idea of this hormonal therapy of endometriosis. We treated twelve patients with histologically proved endometriosis with leuprolide acetate depot in a dose of 3.75 mg s.c. every 4 weeks over a period of 6 months. In the first week of therapy the estrogen level decreased to a post-menopausal niveau along with amenorrhoea during the entire period of therapy. Complaints previous to therapy such as dysmenorrhoea, pelvic pain and dyspareunia were relieved or completely disappeared after therapy. The clinical finding on palpation also diminished or disappeared. In addition to this finding pelvis copy showed a shift from severe endometriosis stage III and stage IV to stage I and stage II of the AFS classification 1985. Regular menstruation appeared in 5 to 9 weeks after the last application to all patients. Out of six cases of infertility, four patients became pregnant. Except for one case, typical menopausal symptoms appeared, such as flush, increased perspiration and sleeping disorders. During and after therapy we could not prove any changes in the lipid metabolism under estrogen therapy. Mineralization of the bone decreased under therapy by about 3%. Simultaneously, serum osteocalcin increased. Demineralization occurred with one exception within the normal range for the corresponding age. With identical efficiency but less side effects, we see therapy with GnRH agonists as an alternative to current hormonal therapy of endometriosis."

The girls' ages ranged from 3.2-9.7 yr, and their bone ages ranged from 5.75-14.25 yr. After baseline evaluations, fadrozole was started at a dose of 240 microg/kg.d (equivalent to the dose recommended for therapy of estrogen-dependent breast cancer) for 12-21 months and increased to 480 microg/kg.d for an additional 12 months in 10 girls. During treatment, seven girls had evidence of central precocious puberty; hence, the GnRH agonist deslorelin (4 microg/kg.d sc) was added to their regimen. One girl was on a long-acting GnRH agonist from the start of treatment. Patients were evaluated at 2-6-month intervals throughout treatment. After the first 6-12 months of treatment, fadrozole showed some benefits in 10 girls, including decrease in frequency of menses and/or rates of linear growth and bone maturation; however, fadrozole had no significant benefit in the group as a whole. The seven girls with evidence of central precocious puberty had no slowing in the progression of their puberty during the combined fadrozole and GnRH analog treatment. Adverse effects of fadrozole included inhibition of cortisol and aldosterone biosynthesis at the dose of 480 microg/kg.d, without clinical evidence of adrenal insufficiency. In addition, three patients complained of nonspecific abdominal pain during fadrozole treatment. In one patient, this resolved with a reduction in dose from 480 to 240 microg/kg.d; in two patients, it resolved spontaneously. One girl had muscle weakness and constipation on the 480 microg/kg.d. This resolved after discontinuation of the drug. We conclude that fadrozole is not sufficiently potent to block estrogen synthesis in most girls with gonadotropin-independent precocious puberty due to the McCune-Albright syndrome and may impair the adrenocortical stress response."

Blumenfeld et al. concluded that coadministration of GnRHa during chemotherapy preserved cyclic ovarian function but not fertility. As the endocrine and ovulatory functions of the ovary are connected, this conclusion seems implausible. The study did not control for disease severity or the dose of alkylating agents. In addition, GnRHa treatment was not randomized, so patients in the control group were unlikely to have received GnRHa because the severity of their disease resulted in more-aggressive chemotherapy. By contrast, the only randomized study published to date showed no gonadal protection from GnRHa during chemotherapy in either sex. Furthermore, GnRHa did not prevent primordial-follicle loss in a human ovarian xenograft model.

In this narrated review, we summarized the systemic effects of GnRH antagonists on ovary, endometrium, embryo implantation, placental development, fetal teratogenicity, reproductive tissue cancer cells, and heart while briefly reviewing the GnRH and GnRH receptor system. GnRH antagonists may have direct effects on ovarian granulosa cells. Data are conflicting regarding their effects on endometrial receptivity. The GnRH antagonists may potentially have detrimental effect on early placentation by decreasing the invasive ability of cytotrophoblasts if the exposure to them occurs during early pregnancy. The GnRH antagonists were not found to increase the rates of congenital malformations. Comparative clinical data are required to explore their systemic effects on various extrapituitary tissues such as on cardiac function in the long term as well as their potential use in other human cancers that express GnRH receptors."

CD008018,0,2526818,0,The influence of gonadal function and the effect of gonadal suppression treatment on final height in growth hormone (GH)-treated GH-deficient children.,"One hundred and sixty-one children with idiopathic GH deficiency who received GH treatment were followed until they reached their final height. Final height was found to be influenced by gonadal function. In 108 patients who had spontaneous puberty (91 boys and 17 girls; group A), the mean final height was 151.8 +/- 6.6 (+/- SD) cm in boys and 141.7 +/- 7.4 cm in girls. In 29 patients with combined GH and gonadotropin deficiency (23 boys and 6 girls; group C), whose pubertal development was induced artificially at age 19.5 +/- 2.1 yr in the boys and 18.6 +/- 1.8 yr in the girls, the mean final height was 163.7 +/- 3.9 cm in boys and 151.0 +/- 5.1 cm in girls. The differences in final height between groups A and C were significant in both boys and girls. The shorter final height in group A was caused by the shorter pubertal duration and smaller pubertal height gain than those in normal children. In 24 patients (17 boys and 7 girls; group B) who developed early signs of puberty, gonadal suppression therapy with cyproterone acetate and/or medroxyprogesterone acetate was given. The mean SD score of the final height in these 24 patients was -2.1 +/- 0.6, significantly higher than that in group A. This beneficial effect of gonadal suppression treatment on final height was caused by increases in the duration of puberty and the pubertal height gain."

The incidences of typical menopausal malaises and/or endocrinological findings were investigated in 32 gynecological cancer patients treated by CPT-11 combination chemotherapies. Patients who complained of menopausal malaises or had been treated by hormone replacement therapy before chemotherapy were excluded from the study. Menopausal malaise-like symptoms (MMLS) appeared in 6 of 32 patients (18.8%) during CPT-11 combination chemotherapy, and these symptoms were completely cured within a few days by administration of conjugated estrogen tablets (0.625 mg/day). All the MMLS cases were perimenopausal patients (47-57 years of age), and MMLS were not found in any of the postmenopausal patients who had exceeded 3 years since endocrinological menopause or patients who had recurrent cancer after pelvic radiotherapy. After exclusion of these 3-year-postmenopausal patients and postirradiation patients, 6 of 7 patients aged 45-59 years complained of MMLS during CPT-11 combination chemotherapy. The incidence of CPT-11-induced MMLS showed no relationships with the anticancer drugs combined with CPT-11, mean total CPT-11 dose, mean number of CPT-11 injections, mean individual CPT-11 dose, grade of CPT-11-specific diarrhea or anticancer effects of each CPT-11 combination chemotherapy. The perimenopausal cancer patients with CPT-11-induced MMLS showed decreased serum estradiol and increased serum FSH and LH levels accompanying the CPT-11 injections. A young patient with CPT-11-induced secondary amenorrhea showed decreased serum estradiol and increased serum FSH and LH levels accompanying the CPT-11 injections. None of the postmenopausal patients with high FSH and LH levels showed any significant differences in their serum FSH, LH, PRL and TSH levels during CPT-11 combination chemotherapy. No differences in the results of LHRH and TRH tests during chemotherapy were found for postmenopausal patients. Histopathological examinations of normal ovarian tissues surgically removed from 4 young cervical cancer patients treated with preoperative CPT-11 combination chemotherapies revealed no growing ovarian follicles in the ovarian tissues. CPT-11 injections can induce estrogen-rescued MMLS in cancer patients aged approximately 50 years at a very high rate and may induce secondary amenorrhea in young women. The endocrinological and histopathological studies revealed that CPT-11 causes ovarian follicular loss and ovarian failure within a short time without affecting hypothalamic and pituitary hormone secretion. These clinical results indicate that CPT-11 has strong ovarian toxicity and that repeated CPT-11 administrations may frequently induce ovarian follicular loss and premature ovarian failure, even in young women."

Effect of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogue triptorelin on the occurrence of chemotherapy-induced early menopause in premenopausal women with breast cancer: a randomized trial. JAMA 306(3), 269-276 (2011). This study is a randomized, open-label, Phase III trial, conducted in 16 Italian centers that enrolled 281 patients between 2003 and 2008. The recruited patients were prospectively and randomly allocated to either chemotherapy alone or combined with monthly triptorelin gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog, started before chemotherapy and repeated every month throughout chemotherapy. The clinical and tumor characteristics of the patients in the control or treatment groups were similar. A total of 12 months after ending chemotherapy, the premature ovarian failure rate was 25.9% in the chemotherapy-alone group versus 8.9% in the chemotherapy and gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog group, an absolute difference of -17% (95% CI: -26 to -7.9%; p < 0.001). The odds ratio for treatment-induced premature ovarian failure was 0.28 (95% CI: 0.14-0.59; p < 0.001).

CD008018,0,8701625,0,[Results of long-term follow-up in treatment of endometriosis with the GnRH agonist leuprorelin acetate depot (Enantone-Gyn monthly depot)].,"In a previous study 198 patients with histologically confirmed endometriosis underwent a ""three-step"" therapy, where surgical removal of endometriosis implants was followed by a 6 months treatment with 3.75 mg leuprorelinacetate depot as monthly subcutaneous injections and a second look laparoscopy with removal of residuals. In the following report long-term follow-up data generated in 112 of the above 198 patients on the post-treatment effect in respect to symptoms and pregnancy outcome in infertility are reported. For this purpose a special questionnaire was used. The follow-up period was up to 60 months with a median time of 33.5 months. Out of 112 patients 91 complained of infertility. 43 out of these 91 (47.3 %) became pregnant during the follow-up period, resulting in 55 pregnancies and 36 newborns. More than half of these patients conceived spontaneously, whereas in the rest stimulation programs became necessary. Recurrence of dysmenorrhoea, dyspareunia and pelvic pain was defined as recurrence of disease. During the follow-up period 70/112 (62.5 %) of the patients complained recurrence of symptoms with median first onset at 11 months. In two third symptoms were still less severe than at admission and classified as mild and moderate. The r-AFS score at first and second look laparoscopy did not differ in patients with and without recurrence of disease (p = 0.311 and 0.750). Only 28.6 % (20/70) of patients required an additional medical or surgical treatment. A subgroup of 51 patients could be evaluated in respect to quality of life and improvement of subjective conditions. Regain of quality of life and improvement of subjective conditions were reported in 54.9 % (28/51) and 52.9 % (27/51) respectively. The study results suggest that although the physiological effects of leuprorelin acetate treatment as suppression of ovarian function is rapidly reversible, the therapeutic effects linger, as evidenced by ongoing reduction of symptoms from baseline, leaving many patients asymptomatic or much improved longer than 1 year after treatment has ended. Besides long term relief and/or sustained reduction in symptom severity, the high pregnancy rate in infertility, as well as regain of quality of life and well being favour this therapeutic approach in endometriosis."

We found that the more potent inhibitor, 4-hydroxyandrostenedione (4-OHA), which can suppress oestrogen synthesis in rodents and non-human primates with intact ovarian function, was also unsuccessful as an oestrogen suppressant in premenopausal women at its maximum tolerated dose (500 mg/week i.m.). GnRH agonists are effective suppressants of ovarian oestrogen synthesis but oestrogen production from peripheral sites is unaffected. Our studies of a combination of the GnRH agonist goserelin and 4-OHA demonstrated that the combination caused greater oestrogen suppression than goserelin alone and led to objective clinical response in 4/6 breast cancer patients after their relapse from treatment with goserelin as a single agent. The combination of a GnRH agonist and an aromatase inhibitor should be subjected to clinical trials."

In the 7 girls who received testolactone for at least 3 yr, the mean +/- SD serum estradiol level was 618 +/- 268 pmol/L at the start of therapy and fell to 156 +/- 84 pmol/L at 1 yr, 116 +/- 48 pmol/L at 2 yr, and 241 +/- 260 pmol/L at 3 yr (P < 0.05 compared to the start of therapy), with recurrent ovarian cysts at 3 yr in 2 patients. These 7 girls averaged 8 menses/yr before therapy. The average frequency of menses decreased to 2 episodes/yr during the first year of treatment, 3/yr during the second year, and 4/yr during the third year. The mean +/- SD testosterone levels were slightly above the normal prepubertal range (0.51 +/- 0.2 nmol/L) before treatment and did not change significantly during treatment. The mean +/- SD androstenedione levels rose from 1.1 +/- 0.6 nmol/L before treatment to 2.1 +/- 0.1 nmol/L at 2 yr and 2.8 +/- 0.1 nmol/L after 3 yr of treatment (P < 0.05 compared to before treatment) and were consistent with normal adrenarche. The mean predicted adult stature was 143.0 +/- 7.8 cm before treatment and 147.3 +/- 11.5 cm at 3 yr (P = NS). In 3 of 12 girls, all with bone age greater than 12 yr, the gonadotropin responses to LHRH indicated early central precocious puberty after 1-4 yr of treatment. The adverse effects of testolactone were transient abdominal pain, headache, and diarrhea in 3 girls and elevated hepatic enzymes in 1 girl who had abnormal liver function before treatment. Six families acknowledged difficulty in adhering to the daily dosing schedule. We conclude that testolactone can be effective in the treatment of LHRH-independent precocious puberty in girls with McCune-Albright syndrome, but that some patients exhibit an escape from the effects of treatment after 1-3 yr."
CD008018,0,17723944,0,[Fertility preservation in adolescent cancer patients].,"Recent advances in cancer therapy have improved the survival rate of infant and adolescent facing cancers. The objective of treatment is not only to cure cancer but also to limit its secondary consequences. Impaired fertility is an important sequel of numerous treatments against cancer. Therefore, efforts to maintain fertility must be a major consideration in the treatment plan. This review focuses on various options for preserving fertility in adolescents. In female patients, ovarian transposition out of the radiation field may considerably reduce the radiation received by the ovaries. The benefits of GnRH analogue are not yet clear and apoptosis inhibiting agents are unavailable. Embryo freezing is the most reliable method to preserve fertility. This method is time-intensive, requires a partner, and ovarian stimulation may not always be compatible with the need of starting treatment against cancer immediately. Oocyte cryopreservation is an experimental technique that can be used in post-pubertal patients irrespective of their marital status. The cryopreservation of mature oocytes has similar constrains as embryo freezing ; in addition the technique is not as well-established and the pregnancy rates obtained are much lower than those achieved with embryos. Freezing of immature oocytes followed by in vitro maturation in spite of its theoretical advantages is inefficient in current practice. Ovarian tissue cryopreservation offers great hope because it has the potential to preserve a large number of primordial follicles without any ovarian stimulation and preliminary trials have shown some success. For male adolescents cancer patients semen cryopreservation is a successful alternative that should be offered systematically when cancer therapies that may impair gonadal function are indicated. For prepubertal males there is presently no standardized technique for preserving fertility ; however, the development of testicular germ-cell harvest needs to be considered."

Twelve days after agonist administration, several ovarian follicles, great-sized, and with a rate of elevated serum oestradiol have been noted. After triggering of the ovulation by 5000 IU of HCG, oocyte retrieval permitted the collection of 4 oocytes 3 of which were mature. Only one embryo with 4 cells has been transferred 48 hours after intracytoplasmic sperm injection fertilization (ICSI), but there was no pregnancy. Ovarian hyperstimulation induced by GnRH agonist is a rare event and only a few cases have been reported. The development of multiple follicles after the administration of an agonist is a paradoxal answer of the ovary to the pituitary desensitization without a clarified physiopathology. The hypothesis of a direct action of the agonist on the ovary is likeliest. Triggering of ovulation by human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG) has been achieved by certain authors. Fertilization of oocytes and transfers of embryos have succeeded in certain cases, but only one pregnancy has been reported that led to a living birth."

We studied 17 pubertal, treatment-naive, GH-deficient patients (10 girls and 7 boys) in a prospective, randomized trial. Mean chronological age and mean bone age were 14.1 +/- 0.4 and 11.3 +/- 0.3 yr, respectively, at the beginning of the study. Treatment with GH + LHRH-A (n = 7) or GH alone (n = 10) started simultaneously. Nutropin was administered at a dose of 0.1 U/kg per day sc until patients reached near final height (NFH), defined as a bone age of 14 yr in girls and 16 yr in boys. Mean time of GH therapy in the patients treated with GH+LHRH-A was 4.8 +/- 0.5 yr and in the patients treated with GH alone 2.9 +/- 0.7 yr. Lupron was administered at a dose of 300 microg/kg every 28 d im for 3 yr. Bone mineral density (BMD) was assessed yearly by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry at the lumbar spine (L2-L4) and femoral neck at the beginning of the study, after 3 yr of hormonal therapy, and at NFH. Statistical analysis was performed by t test and ANOVA. We observed a significant increase in lumbar and femoral bone mineral content, BMD, SD score, and bone mineral apparent density, compared with baseline in both groups of patients, regardless of whether they were treated with GH alone or in combination with LHRH-A. The patients treated with GH + LHRH-A had a significantly lower bone mineral content after 3 yr of therapy. This difference, however, did not persist after both groups of patients reached NFH. These results indicate that delaying puberty with LHRH-A in GH-deficient patients treated with GH diminishes transient bone mineralization but does not appear to have a permanent impact on BMD."

All subjects became oligospermic or azoospermic within eight weeks of starting treatment. Following discontinuation of chemotherapy and LH-RHa, both plasma testosterone and LH promptly increased and stabilized within the normal range. FSH progressively increased to a level well above the normal range. Only one patient has recovered evidence of active spermatogenesis at 84 weeks postcessation of chemotherapy. No untoward side effects due to LH-RHa were experienced. Although LH-RHa can be administered safely during combination chemotherapy, no improvement in posttreatment fertility has yet been demonstrated."
CD008018,0,9741781,0,Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogues--the rationale for adjuvant use in premenopausal women with early breast cancer.,"Current standard adjuvant therapies for early breast cancer include tamoxifen and chemotherapy, depending on the disease prognosis and menopausal status. Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) analogues offer a different approach to the management of early breast cancer in pre- and perimenopausal women. The most widely studied LHRH analogue is goserelin. It acts on the hypothalamic-pituitary axis to suppress ovarian function, decreasing luteinizing hormone and oestradiol levels to post-menopausal values. Pooled data from 228 premenopausal and perimenopausal patients with advanced breast cancer enrolled in 29 studies worldwide demonstrated an objective response rate for goserelin, 3.6 mg, of 36.4%, with a median duration of response of 44 weeks. These results fall well within the ranges of reported response rates for ovarian ablation and for tamoxifen in similar patient populations. By virtue of its mode of action, goserelin does not stimulate the ovaries and is unlikely to have detrimental effects on the endometrium. In addition, given that goserelin has no oestrogen agonist-like effects, unlike tamoxifen, there is no potential for tumour stimulation in those patients becoming resistant to treatment. Goserelin is generally well tolerated, and the main side-effects are related to ovarian suppression, which is potentially reversible. Preliminary results in premenopausal women with early breast cancer indicate that endocrine treatment with goserelin plus tamoxifen may be as effective as standard combination chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide-methotrexate-5-fluorouracil), but has significantly less acute toxicity. A number of large, randomized trials are now in progress to assess the potential role of goserelin as adjuvant therapy for early breast cancer."

CD008018,0,11098021,0,Long-term GnRH analogue treatment is equivalent to laparoscopic laser diathermy in polycystic ovarian syndrome patients with severe ovarian dysfunction.,"This prospective, randomized study included 18 polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) patients with severe ovarian dysfunction, who were evaluated by standard clomiphene and FSH stimulation. In this group of patients, a 6 month down-regulation with gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues gave outcomes similar to laparoscopic ovarian laser diathermy with respect to stimulatory outcome and pregnancy rate. Clomiphene stimulation with 50 mg of clomiphene/day and FSH stimulation in a low-dose, step-up protocol with purified FSH did not result in oligofollicular development; thus patients were divided into two subgroups: one subgroup received laparoscopic laser drilling and the other received 6 months of therapy with GnRH analogues plus add-back therapy after diagnostic laparoscopy. Subsequently, three cycles of low-dose, step-up stimulation with recombinant FSH were started. In both groups, approximately 30% of cycles still remained anovulatory. In the down-regulated subgroup, this mainly happened in the first cycle. In each group, ovulation was achieved in 14 cycles, intrauterine insemination was performed, and five pregnancies were obtained. This resulted in a pregnancy rate of 36% per ovulatory cycle in both groups. Overall, 50% of the formerly unreactive patients in both groups overcame childlessness. In achieving this, long-term treatment with GnRH analogues was as successful as laparoscopic laser diathermy."
CD008018,0,1553181,0,Gonadotropin and inhibin concentrations in early pregnancy in women with and without corpora lutea.,"We compared serum concentrations of immunoreactive inhibin, hCG, and FSH in normal women with those of two groups of women lacking endogenous luteal function. Twelve functionally agonadal, hypergonadotropic women with premature ovarian failure were given replacement ovarian steroids. Donor oocytes were fertilized in vitro with the husband's semen, and embryos were transferred into these women. A second group of 12 women were normogonadotropic but anovulatory, had undergone previously unsuccessful in vitro fertilization, and possessed cryopreserved embryos. These women were suppressed with a GnRH agonist before sex hormone replacement. Serum samples collected at weeks 2, 3, 4-6, 8-10, and 12-14 of pregnancy were measured for FSH, hCG, and immunoreactive inhibin. Data were compared with concentrations in normally ovulating women with well-established dates of conception. Sex steroid replacement hormone levels did not differ between the ovarian-failure and agonist-suppressed women and approximated that of normal cycles until pregnancy; thereafter, estradiol and progesterone levels remained higher than normal. Despite excessive steroid replacement, FSH remained higher in women with ovarian failure than in agonist-suppressed or normal women. On immunoassay, inhibin failed to show an early rise at 4-6 weeks of pregnancy in either group of aluteal women (0.52 +/- 0.05 ng/mL), whereas normal women demonstrated 0.9 +/- 0.05 ng/mL inhibin in their sera (P less than .001). By 8-10 weeks of pregnancy, women with ovarian failure demonstrated inhibin concentrations identical to those of normal women (1.2 +/- 0.1 and 1.2 +/- 0.15 ng/mL, respectively), whereas agonist-suppressed women lagged behind (0.7 +/- 0.1 ng/mL) (P less than .02).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD008018,0,11438377,0,Soluble ICAM-1 levels in the serum of endometriotic patients appear to be independent of medical treatment.,"Adhesion molecules regulate the interaction of cells with the extracellular matrix and/or other cells. The intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1; CD54) is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily and expressed by several cell types, including leukocytes and endothelial cells. A circulating form of the usually membrane-bound molecule was identified and characterized in normal human serum and in sera from patients with endometriosis. In the present study, we established the serum-soluble ICAM-1 (sICAM-1) levels in patients with endometriosis. We also studied the effect of danazol and leuprorelin acetate depot on the levels of sICAM-1. Thirty-eight women, 18-45 years of age, with regular menses and documented pelvic endometriosis were recruited from a University Hospital setting. Twenty-two women with endometriosis were randomly divided into two groups. Danazol (600 mg) were given every day for 6 months, and 3.75 mg of leuprorelin acetate depot every 28 days for 6 months. Serum sICAM-1 concentrations were measured before, during and after treatment, and its quantitative determination was performed by an ELISA technique using a specific immunoassay. We found that (1) sICAM-1 levels were higher in women with endometriosis in comparison to healthy subjects; (2) the 6 month treatment with danazol or leuprorelin acetate depot increased sICAM-1 levels (P<0.001); (3) 3 months after termination of both treatments, sICAM-1 levels were unchanged. Although the mechanism leading to the increase of sICAM-1 needs to be further clarified, any benefits of medical treatment of endometriosis such as danazol or leuprorelin appear to be independent of changes in ICAM-1 serum levels."

To this end, we suppressed reproductive function in 12 women (age 21-35 yr) using a gonadotropin releasing-hormone (GnRH) analog (leuprolide acetate) for 5 wk. During the 5th week, the women either received 4 days of E(2) administration (17beta-estradiol, transdermal patch, 0.1 mg/day) or 4 days of E(2) with P(4) administration (vaginal gel, 90 mg P(4) twice per day). At the end of the 4th and 5th week of GnRH analog and hormone administration, we determined PV (Evans blue dye) and changes in PV and forearm capillary filtration coefficient (CFC) during a 120-min infusion of ANP (5 ng x kg body wt(-1) x min(-1)). Preinfusion PV was estimated from Evans blue dye measurement taken over the last 30 min of infusion based on changes in hematocrit. E(2) treatment did not affect preinfusion PV relative to GnRH analog alone (45.3 +/- 3.1 vs. 45.4 +/- 3.1 ml/kg). During ANP infusion CFC was greater during E(2) treatment compared with GnRH analog alone (6.5 +/- 1.4 vs. 4.9 +/- 1.4 microl. 100 g(-1) x min(-1) mmHg(-1), P < 0.05). The %PV loss during ANP infusion was similar for E(2) and GnRH analog-alone treatments (-0.8 +/- 0.2 and -1.0 +/- 0.2 ml/kg, respectively), indicating the change in CFC had little systemic effect on ANP-related changes in PV. Estimated baseline PV was reduced by E(2)-P(4) treatment. During ANP infusion CFC was approximately 30% lower during E(2)-P(4) (6.0 +/- 0.5 vs. 4.3 +/- 4.3 microl. 100 g(-1) x min(-1) mm Hg(-1), P < 0.05), and the PV loss during ANP infusion was attenuated (-0.9 +/- 0.2 and -0.2 +/- 0.2 ml/kg for GnRH analog-alone and E(2)-P(4) treatments, respectively). Thus the E(2)-P(4) treatment lowered CFC and reduced PV loss during ANP infusion."

CD008018,0,17405890,0,Achievements in systemic therapies in the pregenomic era in metastatic breast cancer.,"Over the last decades, the introduction of several new agents into clinical practice has significantly improved disease control and obtained some, albeit rare, survival benefits in metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Despite these results, the choice of treatment for the majority of patients is still empirically based, since the only two predictive factors with level 1 evidence for clinical use are hormonal receptor status for endocrine therapy and HER-2 status for trastuzumab therapy. Important improvements in the endocrine therapy of both pre- and postmenopausal women with hormone-responsive disease have been achieved. For premenopausal women, ovarian function suppression with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogs combined with tamoxifen has become the standard treatment, although aromatase inhibitors plus ovarian function suppression are under evaluation. In postmenopausal patients, aromatase inhibitors have proved to be superior to standard endocrine therapies in either first- or second-line treatment and a novel antiestrogen compound, fulvestrant, has been introduced in clinical practice. Chemotherapy remains the treatment of choice for hormone unresponsive or resistant patients. Anthracyclines and taxanes have been used either alone or in combination as first-line chemotherapy, but with the more frequent use of these agents in the adjuvant setting, new standards are needed for first-line chemotherapy, and new and more efficacious treatments are required. In the subgroup of patients with tumors that overexpress HER-2, the use of trastuzumab alone or in combination with chemotherapy has modified the natural history of these tumors, even if only about one out of two patients obtains a clinical response. In this review we summarize the main achievements and the currently available treatment options for patients with MBC."

Two hundred pre or peri-menopausal women read two scenarios describing goserelin or chemotherapy. Information included: How and where treatments were administered, side-effects, their likely persistence and impact on fertility. Women stated their unprompted initial and final preferences with reasons for the choices made. Respondents showed an overwhelming preference for goserelin. 156 (78%) women favoured goserelin, 22 (11%) chemotherapy and 22 (11%) remained undecided (P<0.0001). Primary reasons for preferring goserelin for were 105 (71%) avoidance of chemotherapy side-effects, especially hair loss, perceived convenience and less disruption to normal life 54 (36%). The minority who preferred chemotherapy, valued the treatment finishing more quickly. These results together with clinical trial data showing equivalence of goserelin with CMF regimens suggest that premenopausal women with ER-positive tumours should at least be offered the choice of either adjuvant hormone therapy or chemotherapy."

CD008018,0,20232475,0,Fertility preservation after chemotherapy for Hodgkin lymphoma.,"Treatment for Hodgkin lymphoma can negatively affect fertility. This review summarizes data on fertility after chemotherapy in adult patients. Alkylating chemotherapy, especially if containing procarbazine and/or cyclophosphamide, is most harmful to gonadal functioning. Alkylating regimens cause prolonged azoospermia in 90-100% of men and ovarian failure in 5-25% of women under the age of 30. Non-alkylating chemotherapy, like ABVD, is much less harmful: one-third of male patients develop transient azoospermia, and almost no female patients experience ovarian failure. Age is an important factor for women: females over 30 years have a much higher risk of acute ovarian failure. However, with long-term follow-up the cumulative risk of menopause before the age of 40 becomes the same irrespective of treatment age. In males, semen cryopreservation before start of treatment should be offered to all (post)pubertal patients. For females with a partner, IVF followed by embryo cryopreservation is a widely available method, but this necessitates postponement of lymphoma therapy for at least a month. Oocyte cryopreservation and ovarian tissue cryopreservation are experimental techniques showing great promise. GnRH-analogues are being investigated as possible means to preserve fertility in women, but effectiveness has not yet been proven conclusively."
CD008018,0,12419034,0,Impact of metformin therapy on ovarian stimulation and outcome in 'coasted' patients with polycystic ovary syndrome undergoing in-vitro fertilization.,"This study was designed to determine if metformin therapy improves ovarian stimulation and IVF outcomes in coasted patients with clomiphene-resistant polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). A retrospective data analysis was performed on women with clomiphene citrate-resistant PCOS treated with or without metformin, who underwent 72 cycles of IVF-embryo transfer with intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). In 59 cycles, patients were coasted to allow oestradiol concentrations to drop before human chorionic gonadotrophin administration. In patients undergoing coasting, the outcome of IVF with ICSI was compared in those who were treated and untreated. In patients treated with metformin, follicular fluid concentrations of testosterone and insulin were significantly lower (60.5 +/- 5 versus 79.1 +/- 6 ng/dl; P < 0.05 and 18 +/- 2.5 versus 22 +/- 2.4 micro IU/ml; P < 0.05 respectively), and the mean number of oocytes retrieved (22.3 +/- 2.4 versus 19.7 +/- 1.6) did not differ. The metformin-treated group showed an increase in the mean number of mature oocytes, oocytes fertilized and cleaving embryos (4-cell or greater by 72 h). However, in the group of patients undergoing coasting, maximum oestradiol concentrations and number of days of coasting were all lower in the metformin-treated group with increased clinical pregnancy rates (71 versus 30%, P < 0.05). Therefore, metformin use appears beneficial in improving IVF outcomes in clomiphene citrate-resistant PCOS patients."
CD008018,0,29466689,0,The protective effects of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist on ovarian functions in breast Cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.,"In recent decades, the incidence rate of breast cancer has increased dramatically worldwide and has become one of the most prevalent cancers in women. According to the global data provided by the WHO, there were more than 1.7 million new cases of breast cancer in 2012, accounting for 25% of all reported cancer cases and 15% of all reported deaths among females. To most young patients, especially those younger than 40 years of age, chemotherapy should be taken into consideration as a treatment modality, even if the tumor size is small or without lymphatic metastasis. A significant portion of the patients will suffer from the side effects that result from long-term chemotherapy regimens, such as myelosuppression, heart failure, and development of a second primary malignancy. Ovarian suppression and premature ovarian failure (POF) are the most common side effects reported as they have notable clinical symptoms; the incidence rates have been reported to be in a range of 10-90%. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRH-a), also termed luteinizing hormone release hormone agonists (LHRH-a), may very well offer a solution to treating these side effects. This article aims to summarize advanced studies concerning protective effects of GnRH-a on ovarian functions in the setting of breast cancer under chemotherapy."
CD008018,0,7528032,0,Ovarian ablation as treatment for young women with breast cancer.,"Ovarian ablation has been used for breast cancer treatment for nearly 100 years. Available methods of causing ovarian failure include surgical or radiotherapeutic ablation and LH-RH agonists that effect a reversible ""medical oophorectomy."" In addition, administration of certain types of chemotherapy to susceptible hosts may also result in permanent amenorrhea. The response rate to ovarian ablation in premenopausal women with metastatic breast cancer is about 35%. It is more effective in women over 35 years of age or with estrogen receptor-positive tumors. Oophorectomy, ovarian radiation, and luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonists are probably equally effective in this setting, although rigorous comparative trials have not been completed. Individual trials of ovarian ablation as adjuvant therapy show a trend toward increased relapse-free survival, but rarely show a survival advantage. However, an overview analysis of randomized trials of adjuvant ovarian ablation, which includes about 1800 women under 50 years of age, suggests that this modality reduces the annual rates of recurrence and death by about 25%, an effect similar to that seen with adjuvant chemotherapy by indirect comparison. Therefore, a number of clinical trials designed to elucidate the role of ovarian ablation alone or in conjunction with other adjuvant approaches are in progress. The routine use of ovarian ablation as an adjuvant therapy should await the establishment of its efficacy in these trials."
CD008018,0,8783388,0,Chronic GnRH agonist administration down-regulates platelet serotonin transporter in women undergoing assisted reproductive treatment.,"The effect of pretreatment with the gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist D-Trp6-LHRH (Decapeptyl) on platelet serotonin transporter in women undergoing assisted reproductive treatment (ART) was investigated and compared with women treated with human menopausal gonadotropin (Pergonal). The study group (n = 10) was exposed for 12 days to 3.2 mg Decapeptyl C.R. while a comparison group (n = 9) was exposed to 11 days of human meno-pausal gonadotropin (Pergonal). All patients were assessed with the Hamilton depression and anxiety scales before and after treatment, and platelet and plasma samples were collected at the same time points. Plasma levels of estradiol, progesterone. FSH and LH were determined by radioimmunoassay (RIA). Platelet serotonin transporter was labeled using high affinity [3H]imipramine binding. The GnRH analogue induced ovarian suppression as reflected by low plasma estradiol levels, while Pergonal administration induced ovarian stimulation. An elevation in the Hamilton depression and anxiety scale scores was observed in the Decapeptyl treated group; this mood alteration was associated with a significant decrease (19%, P < 0.05) in the density (Bmax) of platelet [3H]imipramine binding sites. No significant change was observed in the Bmax of the Pergonal treated group. These results indicate that ovarian suppression (menopausal-like state) in young women is associated with depressed and anxious mood and decreased serotonin transporter density."
CD008018,0,16297086,0,The role of ovarian ablation in the management of breast cancer.,"In recent years the role of ovarian ablation as a therapeutic modality not only in the prevention but also in the treatment of breast cancer has reemerged after its initial use more than a century ago. BRCA-1 and BRCA-2 mutation carriers have an 85% lifetime risk of developing breast cancer. Bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy is effective in reducing the risk of developing breast cancer in both BRCA-1 and BRCA-2 mutation carriers by 50%. Tamoxifen reduces the risk of breast cancer in BRCA-2 mutation carriers, but not in BRCA-1 mutation carriers. Breast cancer arising in BRCA-1 mutation carriers is often estrogen receptor (ER) negative, unlike breast cancer developing in BRCA-2 mutation carriers. Sixty percent of premenopausal patients with breast cancer have ER-positive disease and 25% of breast cancer patients are premenopausal at diagnosis. The Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group review has shown ovarian ablation to be an effective adjuvant therapy for premenopausal breast cancer patients less than 50 years of age. But the Early Breast Cancer Trialists' overview also shows the benefit of ovarian ablation is uncertain if these patients also receive chemotherapy. Does the overview underestimate the efficacy of ovarian ablation? Some patients in these trials were ER negative. Most women less than 50 years of age who receive adjuvant chemotherapy become menopausal. So there is a need to test ovarian function suppression in the group who can benefit, or in other words, those that remain premenopausal after chemotherapy and have endocrine responsive breast cancer."
CD008018,0,15369444,0,A review of adjuvant hormonal therapy in breast cancer.,"Breast cancer is the most common carcinoma diagnosed in women today excluding non-melanoma skin cancers. It has been well documented that estrogen plays a critical role in its development and is a major target for treatment. For many years, tamoxifen has been the gold standard for adjuvant hormonal therapy in breast cancer patients. With newer products targeting different mechanisms to suppress estrogen production, patients now have many decisions regarding their care. Agents such as luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists can suppress ovarian function in premenopausal patients and have been shown to be as effective and even better than chemotherapy (CMF--cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, fluorouracil-containing regimens) in certain patient populations. Tamoxifen continues to be an option as well as toremifene, a similar selective estrogen receptor modulator. With the advent of newer third generation aromatase inhibitors (anastrozole, letrozole and exemestane) toxicities have been documented to be less and in some cases they are more efficacious than the standard, tamoxifen. This article reviews the current data regarding ovarian suppression, ovarian suppression plus tamoxifen, tamoxifen, toremifene, anastrozole, letrozole, and exemestane in the treatment of adjuvant hormonal-sensitive breast cancer."
CD008018,0,8856307,0,Leuprolide acetate as a salvage-therapy in relapsed epithelial ovarian cancer.,"A large number of studies have been conducted in patients affected by epithelial ovarian cancer to assess the potential utility of a variety of different regimens in patients who have relapsed after primary surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy. In this open prospective study, 32 patients with ovarian cancer of epithelial histology who had relapsed after platinum-based line chemotherapy and had exhausted all standard treatments, received Leuprolide acetate depot 3.75 mg, intramuscularly once a month until tumor progression. Four patients (12.5%) had clinical and/or radiological partial response; remission was then maintained for a mean duration of 8.7 months (range 6-11 months) before new progression occurred. Five patients (15.6%) remained stable for a mean time of 5.2 months (range 4-6 months) and 23 patients (71.9%) continued to progress following therapy and have since died by tumor with a median survival of 3.6 months after initiation of the protocol. Treatment is well-tolerated and no toxicity has been noted. These data stress the significant activity of Leuprolide acetate as a salvage therapy in patients with relapsed advanced epithelial ovarian cancer after previous platinum-based chemotherapies."
CD008018,0,27056135,0,Adjuvant Hormonal Therapy in Women with Early-stage Breast Cancer.,"For decades, adjuvant hormonal therapy has become the standard treatment of patients with estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. Currently, the drugs available are GnRH agonists, selective estrogen receptor modulators, and aromatase inhibitors. The use of GnRH agonists represents a potentially reversible treatment that can restore ovarian function after chemotherapy. In premenopausal women, systemic therapy based on selective estrogen receptor modulators administration (e.g., tamoxifen) usually represents the standard adjuvant treatment. There are not sufficient data to recommend the routine addition of GnRH agonists to other endocrine therapies. In postmenopausal women, the disease-free survival was significantly prolonged in patients treated with aromatase inhibitor compared with those treated with tamoxifen, but the survival benefit was modest. Better results were obtained when the two drugs were administered sequentially. According to the ASCO guidelines, after 5 years of tamoxifen treatment, either tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors therapy should be suggested for an additional 5 years. Unfortunately, most adverse events are consistent with estrogen deprivation and are common to all therapies, and the cumulative toxicity causes discontinuation and nonadherence to therapy in up to 50% of patients. Switching tamoxifen to an aromatase inhibitor may reduce adverse event incidence. Molecular-targeted therapy is useful in patients with advanced, relapsed or hormonal therapy-resistant tumors, usually as second- or third-line treatment. These drugs are usually added to aromatase inhibitors; however, currently, they have not yet been used in patients with early breast cancer."

CD008018,0,10325255,0,"The value of basal serum follicle stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone and oestradiol concentrations following pituitary down-regulation in predicting ovarian response to stimulation with highly purified follicle stimulating hormone.","The value of gonadotrophin and oestradiol concentrations following pituitary down-regulation with leuprolide acetate in predicting ovarian response to stimulation was evaluated in three groups of women undergoing ovarian stimulation for in-vitro fertilization with highly purified follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). Leuprolide acetate was started in the midluteal phase, and either stopped at menses (IVF-SL group, n = 3), or continued throughout stimulation (IVF-LL group, n = 38; oocyte donors, n = 58). Ovarian stimulation was started on cycle day 3, after blood was drawn for down-regulated FSH, luteinizing hormone (LH) and oestradiol. Higher down-regulated LH was predictive of higher oestradiol on day 5 of stimulation in both IVF groups, and of need for fewer ampoules in the IVF-LL group, but not of oestradiol on day of human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG) administration or number of oocytes retrieved. Higher FSH after down-regulation predicted yield of fewer oocytes in the donor and IVF-LL groups, and higher oestradiol on day 5 of stimulation, need for fewer ampoules and a shorter duration of therapy in both IVF groups. Higher oestradiol after down-regulation was associated with higher oestradiol on day 5 of stimulation and on day of HCG administration, a shorter duration of therapy and need for fewer ampoules in all groups. Whereas these results do not ascribe any predictive significance to LH, they suggest that oestradiol and FSH concentrations after down-regulation are predictive of the pattern of ovarian response to stimulation and of oocyte yield."
CD008018,0,21143113,0,Endocrine therapy of breast cancer.,"Breast cancer remains one of the first leading causes of death in women, and currently endocrine treatment is of major therapeutic value in patients with estrogen-receptor positive tumors. Selective estrogen-receptor modulators (SERMs), such as tamoxifen and raloxifene, aromatase inhibitors, and GnRH agonists are the drugs of choice. Tamoxifen, a partial nonsteroidal estrogen agonist, is a type II competitive inhibitor of estradiol at its receptor, and the prototype of SERMs. Aromatase inhibitors significantly lower serum estradiol concentration in postmenopausal patients, having no detectable effects on adrenocortical steroids formation, while GnRH agonists suppress ovarian function, inducing a menopause-like condition in premenopausal women. Endocrine therapy has generally a relatively low morbidity, leading to a significant reduction of mortality for breast cancer. The aim of chemoprevention is to interfere early with the process of carcinogenesis, reducing the risk of cancer development. As preventive agents, raloxifene and tamoxifene are equivalent, while raloxifene has more potent antiresorptive effects in postmenopausal osteoporosis. Endocrine treatment is usually considered a standard choice for patients with estrogen-receptor positive cancers and non-life-threatening advanced disease, or for older patients unfit for aggressive chemotherapy regimens. Several therapeutic protocols used in patients with breast cancer are associated with bone loss, which may lead to an increased risk of fracture. Bisphosphonates are the drugs of choice to treat such a drug-induced bone disease. The aim of this review is to outline current understanding on endocrine therapy of breast cancer."

One patient remained free of further treatment. Buserelin treatment was recommended to start at least 7 days prior to the tumor treatment, the interval ranged between 7 and 43 days. It ended on the same day as the tumor treatment or some days later, but this recommendation was followed only in 12 patients. 4 patients cessated buserelin treatment before end of the tumor therapy, and 4 other dropped out of the study. Testosterone plasma levels were measured before, during and after treatment with buserelin. 7 days after starting they were increased in most patients, while they were lower after 14 days and at the end of treatment period. Semen analysis showed sperm counts of 1 to 44 millions/ml with motility rates from 9 to 81%. In only ten patients we analysed a semen sample up to 6 months after cessation of treatment. In all but one we found azoospermia. Thus this treatment at now cannot be recommended in young men undergoing cytotoxic treatment to preserve fertility."
CD008018,0,27940355,0,Temporary ovarian suppression during chemotherapy to preserve ovarian function and fertility in breast cancer patients: A GRADE approach for evidence evaluation and recommendations by the Italian Association of Medical Oncology.,"The development of premature ovarian failure and subsequent infertility are possible consequences of chemotherapy use in pre-menopausal women with early-stage breast cancer. Among the available strategies for fertility preservation, pharmacological protection of the ovaries using luteinising hormone-releasing hormone analogues (LHRHa) during chemotherapy has the potential to restore ovarian function and fertility after anticancer treatments; however, the possible efficacy and clinical application of this strategy has been highly debated in the last years. Following the availability of new data on this controversial topic, the Panel of the Italian Association of Medical Oncology (AIOM) Clinical Practice Guideline on fertility preservation in cancer patients decided to apply the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology around the relevant and current question on the clinical utility of temporary ovarian suppression with LHRHa during chemotherapy as a strategy to preserve ovarian function and fertility in breast cancer patients. To answer this question, preservation of ovarian function and fertility were judged as critical outcomes for the decision-making. Three possible outcomes of harm were identified: LHRHa-associated toxicities, potential antagonism between concurrent LHRHa and chemotherapy, and lack of the prognostic impact of chemotherapy-induced premature ovarian failure. According to the GRADE evaluation conducted, the result was a strong positive recommendation in favour of using this option to preserve ovarian function and fertility in breast cancer patients. The present manuscript aims to update and summarise the evidence for the use of this strategy in light of the new data published up to January 2016, according to the GRADE process."

To minimize risk of harm to ovarian function and fertility for patients in this setting, careful considerations should be made. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRHa) have been suggested as an alternative to prevent the loss of ovarian function due to exposure to cytotoxic agents, but GnRHa use for ovarian protection in EBC patients is not fully resolved."
CD008018,0,1906152,0,Adjunctive leuprolide therapy does not improve cycle fecundity in controlled ovarian hyperstimulation and intrauterine insemination of subfertile women.,"Problems arising from controlled ovarian hyperstimulation for intrauterine insemination, such as premature luteinization and asynchronous ovarian follicular development, are identical to those encountered with controlled ovarian hyperstimulation for in vitro fertilization (IVF) and gamete intrafallopian transfer (GIFT). It has been suggested that the adjunctive use of GnRH agonists for controlled ovarian hyperstimulation improves the efficiency of GIFT and IVF cycles. We hypothesized that adjunctive use of leuprolide acetate, a GnRH agonist, would have a similarly beneficial effect on cycle quality and cycle fecundity in subfertile women treated with controlled ovarian hyperstimulation and intrauterine insemination. We randomly assigned the first cycle of controlled ovarian hyperstimulation and intrauterine insemination for each of 97 subfertile women to include either human menopausal gonadotropins (hMGs) alone or hMGs following midluteal pre-treatment with leuprolide. If a pregnancy did not occur in the first cycle, the woman was given the other treatment in the second cycle. Although the cycles that included leuprolide required a larger amount of hMGs and more days of stimulation per cycle, the mean estradiol concentrations and numbers of follicles were not different. Despite prevention of premature luteinization with leuprolide, the cycle fecundity was not different between groups (0.11 with adjunctive leuprolide treatment and 0.22 with hMGs alone). We conclude that in unselected subfertile patients, the adjunctive use of leuprolide for controlled ovarian hyperstimulation and intrauterine insemination does not improve cycle fecundity compared with treatment cycles that do not include adjunctive leuprolide therapy."

CD008018,0,3082618,0,Treatment of breast cancer with gonadotropin-releasing hormone.,"Analogs of GnRH, given chronically in a continuous fashion, produce a paradoxic inhibition of pituitary gonadotropin secretion and, consequently, gonadal steroidogenesis. Thus, GnRH analogs are an attractive class of compounds for achieving a medical castration in the treatment of hormone-dependent neoplasms. In a group of 25 premenopausal patients with progressive advanced breast cancer, daily sc administration of 1-10 mg Leuprolide [D-Leu6-Pro9GnRH ethylamide (NEt)] induced objective tumor regression in 44% with a median duration of 9 months. All women treated for at least 10 weeks developed amenorrhea. Profound suppression of gonadotropins, estradiol, and progesterone secretion occurred in all patients on chronic therapy and persisted for the whole treatment period. These effects on tumor growth and ovarian hormone levels are similar to those observed after surgical ovariectomy. Other GnRH analogs such as Buserelin and Zoladex have been found to have similar antitumor and hormonal effects which are also comparable to those produced by surgical ovariectomy. The mode of drug administration is important. Consistent suppression of ovarian function has only been observed with sc injections of the analogs. Chronic intranasal therapy has been found to induce an incomplete suppression of ovarian function in most patients, probably as a result of the poor absorption of these compounds through this route (approximately 2%). Treatment of metastatic breast cancer with GnRH analogs has been associated with remarkable absence of significant toxicity. Despite some evidence in favor of a direct antitumor effect independent of suppression of ovarian function, the use of GnRH analogs in the therapy of advanced breast cancer should be restricted to premenopausal women."

CD008018,0,23904400,1,Effect of leuprolide acetate on ovarian function after cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin-based chemotherapy in premenopausal patients with breast cancer: results from a phase II randomized trial.,"Previous studies provided inconclusive evidence for the effectiveness of gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogue on ovarian function protection against chemotherapy-induced genotoxicity in premenopausal patients. This study was designed to examine the efficacy of leuprolide acetate on ovarian function preservation in patients with breast cancer. A total of 220 patients were recruited in this prospective clinical trial and were assigned randomly to receive cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin-based chemotherapy only or chemotherapy plus leuprolide acetate. Resumption of menses or premenopausal levels of both follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol (E2) within 12 months after the end of chemotherapy were considered as effective ovarian preservation. A total of 183 patients were considered evaluable (94 in chemotherapy-only group and 89 in chemotherapy plus leuprolide acetate group). At the end of follow-up, 27 patients in chemotherapy group and 15 in chemotherapy plus leuprolide acetate group resumed menses; seven patients in chemotherapy group and 14 in chemotherapy plus leuprolide acetate group restored premenopausal levels of FSH and E2. The median time to resume menses was 9.2 months for patients in chemotherapy plus leuprolide acetate group and was not reached in chemotherapy-only group. In addition, our results demonstrated that age and chemotherapy doses made no significant difference in the occurrence of premature menopause. The leuprolide acetate treatment simultaneously with cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin-based chemotherapy reduced the risk of developing premature menopause in premenopausal patients with breast cancer."

Report of a case with contribution by peripherally derived estrogens.,"Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRH-a) are effective in reducing the pituitary release of gonadotropins, which, in turn, decrease ovarian steroidogenesis. The resulting menopausal state decreases the volume and vascular supply to uterine leiomyomas. Peripheral adipose tissue also contributes significantly to the circulatory estrogen pool, which is formed independent of pituitary function. As such, obesity may interfere with depot leuprolide acetate effects, allowing normal estrogen levels despite gonadotropin suppression."
CD008018,0,10599545,0,Good results of milder form of ovarian stimulation in an in vitro fertilization/intracytoplasmic sperm injection program.,"In a prospective study, we compared two protocols of ovulation stimulation, the clomiphene citrate and human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) versus D-triptorelin, a long-acting gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist and hMG in 324 couples having their first in vitro fertilization or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (IVF/ICSI) program, in terms of pregnancy rates and cost-effectiveness of drugs used. The GnRH agonist/hMG group was characterized by a greater mean number of ampoules of hMG used (31.7 versus 10.2), a larger number of oocytes collected (10.4 versus 4.2), and a larger number of embryos obtained (5.8 versus 2.9). With the policy of transferring only two of the best quality embryos, the mean number of embryos replaced were comparable (1.8 in clomiphene citrate/hMG and 1.9 in GnRH agonist/hMG group). The percentage of patients reaching embryo transfer was lower in the clomiphene citrate/hMG than in the GnRH agonist/hMG group (84.1% versus 93.1%, respectively). However, the combined results of the IVF and ICSI procedure in terms of pregnancy rate, both per patient and per embryo transfer were better, though not significantly in the clomiphene citrate/hMG than in GnRH agonist/hMG group (25.0% and 29.7% versus 23.7% and 25.5%, respectively). Similarly, the implantation rate was better (19.0% versus 13.5%, respectively). With the use of clomiphene citrate/hMG, a fivefold less costly drug regimen, we obtained pregnancy rates equivalent to those gained using GnRH agonist/hMG in our IVF/ICSI program."

CD008018,0,16302717,0,[Treatment of precocious puberty by GnRH agonists].,"The objective of GnRH agonist treatment in precocious puberty is to block pubertal development, and to reduce the action of sex steroids on bone maturation in order to restore normal long-term growth of the skeleton. Currently available studies show a positive benefit-risk ratio of GnRH analogs in the treatment of precocious puberty. Adult heights obtained are in average greater than those predicted in the absence of treatment and close to the normal target height. The side effects observed during treatment such as headaches, asthenia or hot flushes, are related to sex steroid deprivation and are observed in 20 to 30% of cases. Questions remain concerning the impact of these treatments on intellectual development and body composition. Finally, to assess the impact on fertility, IPSEN laboratories decided to organize a prospective study on patients treated in the 1980-1990s. In pediatrics, a reduction in the number of injections is an important objective to improve compliance. ""Depot"" formulations with prolonged release over three months, already used in adult indications, represent a useful progress in pediatrics and have recently been assessed.

CD008018,0,17386122,0,Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonists in premenopausal hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.,"Ovarian function suppression for the treatment of premenopausal breast cancer was first used in the late 19th century. Traditionally, ovarian function suppression had been accomplished irreversibly via irradiation or surgery, but analogues of the luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH) have emerged as reliable and reversible agents for this purpose, especially the LH-RH agonists. Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone antagonists are in earlier stages of development in breast cancer and are not currently in clinical use. Luteinizing hormonereleasing hormone agonists act by pituitary desensitization and receptor downregulation, thereby suppressing gonadotrophin release. Limited information is available comparing the efficacies of the depot preparations of various agonists, but pharmacodynamic studies have shown comparable suppressive capabilities on estradiol and luteinizing hormone. At present, only monthly goserelin is Food and Drug Administration-approved for the treatment of estrogen receptor-positive, premenopausal metastatic breast cancer in the United States. Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonists have proven to be as effective as surgical oophorectomy in premenopausal advanced breast cancer. They offer similar outcomes compared with tamoxifen, but the endocrine combination appears to be more effective than LH-RH agonists alone. In the adjuvant setting, LH-RH agonists versus no therapy reduce the annual odds of recurrence and death in women aged>50 years with estrogen receptor-positive tumors. Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonists alone or in combination with tamoxifen have shown disease-free survival rates similar to chemotherapy with CMF (cyclophosphamide/methotrexate/5-fluorouracil). Outcomes of chemotherapy with or without LH-RH agonists are comparable, though a few trials favor the combination in young premenopausal women (aged<40 years). Adjuvant LH-RH agonists with or without tamoxifen might be as efficacious as tamoxifen alone, and the additional benefit from chemotherapy is unclear. Adequately powered studies are now studying the relative merits of combining adjuvant tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors with ovarian function suppression, the additional benefits of adding ovarian function suppression to chemotherapy, and the need for adjuvant chemotherapy for women treated with combined ovarian function suppression and anti-estrogen therapy."
CD008018,0,26370157,0,Fertility preservation options in breast cancer patients.,"The purpose of this review is to analyse current options for fertility preservation in young women with breast cancer (BC). Considering an increasing number of BC survivors, owing to improvements in cancer treatment and delaying of childbearing, fertility preservation appears to be an important issue. Current fertility preservation options in BC survivors range from well-established standard techniques to experimental or investigational interventions. Among the standard options, random-start ovarian stimulation protocol represents a new technique, which significantly decreases the total time of the in vitro fertilisation cycle. However, in patients with oestrogen-sensitive tumours, stimulation protocols using aromatase inhibitors are currently preferred over tamoxifen regimens. Cryopreservation of embryos and oocytes are nowadays deemed the most successful techniques for fertility preservation in BC patients. GnRH agonists during chemotherapy represent an experimental method for fertility preservation due to conflicting long-term outcome results regarding its safety and efficacy. Cryopreservation of ovarian tissue, in vitro maturation of immature oocytes and other strategies are considered experimental and should only be offered within the context of a clinical trial. An early pretreatment referral to reproductive endocrinologists and oncologists should be suggested to young BC women at risk of infertility, concerning the risks and benefits of fertility preservation options."
CD008018,0,15853442,0,Chemotherapy-induced ovarian failure: manifestations and management.,"Thanks to improvements in treatment regimens, more and more patients are now surviving cancer. However, cancer survivors are faced with the serious long-term effects of the different modalities of cancer treatments. One of these adverse effects is chemotherapy-induced irreversible damage to the ovarian tissues, which leads to premature ovarian failure and its resulting consequences such as hot flashes, osteoporosis, sexual dysfunction and the risk of infertility. Chemotherapy-induced ovarian failure (or chemotherapy-induced premature menopause) affects the quality of life of female cancer survivors. Although there is no clear definition of chemotherapy-induced ovarian failure, irreversible amenorrhoea lasting for several months (>12 months) following chemotherapy and a follicle stimulating hormone level of > or = 30 MIU/mL in the presence of a negative pregnancy test seems to be an appropriate characterisation. Different chemotherapy agents, alkylating cytotoxics in particular, have the potential to cause progressive and irreversible damage to the ovaries. The result of this damage is a state of premature ovarian failure, with progressive declining of estrogen levels, decreasing bone mass and an increased risk of fractures. Historically, hormonal replacement therapy (HRT) has been used to treat menopausal problems in the general population, but concerns about the potential of estrogen to increase the risk of breast cancer in women at high-risk or increase the risk of recurrence in cancer survivors, have forced physicians to utilise alternative treatments. This review discusses some of the newer therapies that are now available to provide appropriate symptom control, avoid complications such as fractures and possibly prevent infertility by making the ovarian epithelium less susceptible to cytotoxic agents."

CD008018,0,11700258,0,Reversal of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist induced reductions in mammographic densities on stopping treatment.,"Previously, we described the reduction in mammographic densities that occurred in premenopausal women after 12 months on a hormonal regimen designed to be chemopreventive for breast (and ovarian) cancer consisting of a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHA) plus low-dose add-back estrogen-progestin. We sought to determine whether the density reduction persisted with continuation of the regimen for 24 months, and, if so, whether the densities would return to baseline after the regimen was discontinued. Twenty-one women, 27-40 years of age, with a 5-fold greater than normal risk of breast cancer, were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to the treatment group (14 women) and to a control group (7 women). The percentage of mammographic densities, calculated as the proportion of the breast area on the mammogram containing densities, were assessed blindly using a computer-based threshold method at baseline, after 12 and 24 months of treatment, and at between 6 and 12 months after treatment was stopped. The previously described percentage of mammographic density reductions of 9.7% (P = 0.012) after 12 months of treatment were increased slightly to 11.4% (P = 0.010) after 24 months of treatment, but the additional change was not statistically significant. Ten of 11 treated women assessed at 24 months had reduced percentages of mammographic densities compared with baseline. Six to 12 months after completion of treatment, the mean percentage of mammographic density in the treated group was no different from that at baseline (mean decline of 2.0%; P = 0.73). The women in the control group had no statistically significant changes in densities over the period of the study. Reductions in mammographic densities engendered by the GnRHA plus a low-dose add-back estrogen-progestin regimen persist as long as the women receive treatment. The densities return to baseline when the women resume normal menstrual cycles. These results confirm that mammographic densities are influenced by ovarian function. Improved efficacy of mammographic screening is to be expected as long as a woman continues on such a regimen. Whether such a regimen is chemopreventive for breast cancer remains to be established, but the recent report on a randomized trial of use of GnRHA alone in premenopausal breast cancer cases showing a marked reduction in incidence of contralateral disease provides strong support for the hypothesis."

In both men and women treated with cyclophosphamide, the consequences of infertility can have great physical and emotional consequences; thus, this issue often has a critical role in the decision to decline treatment with cyclophosphamide. There exists a critical need for strategies for preservation of fertility in both men and women who require treatment with cyclophosphamide. This review explores emerging therapeutic options in this arena, which include sperm and oocyte cryopreservation, medical treatments such as testosterone therapy for men and gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist therapy for both men and women, and, finally, the relatively new strategy of germ-cell transplantation for both ovarian and testicular tissue, which still remains in the experimental stages."

CD008018,0,21828120,0,Management of fertility in patients treated for Hodgkin's lymphoma.,"The risk of developing premature ovarian failure and azoospermia is a major concern in long-term survivors treated for Hodgkin's lymphoma. Alkylating chemotherapy containing procarbazine and/or cyclophosphamide causes prolonged azoospermia in 90-100% of men and premature ovarian failure in 5-25% of women under the age of 30. The risk of infertility increases with the cumulative dose of alkylating agents and the risk is high after salvage therapy including conditioning and autologous or allogeneic transplantation. The doxorubicin-bleomycin-vinblastine-dacarbazine regimen is associated with a lower risk of gonadal damage; the rate of infertility is less than 10%. The risk of premature ovarian failure is limited after the doxorubicin-bleomycin-vinblastine-dacarbazine regimen. However, age is an important factor; women over 30 years of age are at a much higher risk of ovarian failure. Semen cryopreservation should be routinely offered, especially before initial treatment with bleomycin, etoposide, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, procarbazine, prednisolone or salvage therapy with high-dose chemotherapy and autologous transplantation. For women with a stable partner, in vitro fertilization for embryo cryopreservation is a routine procedure but can only be offered to a small number of patients and requires a delay in treatment initiation for at least four weeks. Cryopreservation of mature or immature oocytes remains experimental. Ovarian tissue cryopreservation is promising but has so far resulted in only a small number of pregnancies and births. This method, usually involving the removal of an entire ovary, is only proposed before treatment leading to a high risk of infertility. Analogs of LHRH were investigated in order to preserve fertility in women but are not recommended in the absence of studies demonstrating their effectiveness. The risk of secondary infertility should be discussed with patients from the time of the diagnosis and requires multidisciplinary collaboration between hematologists and Assisted Reproductive Techniques (ART) teams."

Patients were randomised to either three cycles of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil (CMF) chemotherapy (n=378) or goserelin every 28 d for 2 years (n=393). During a median follow-up of 4.9 years, 123 events were observed. The first-failure event of CMF versus goserelin, respectively, was ipsilateral locoregional recurrence (18 versus 20), contralateral breast cancer (7 versus 6), distant failure (35 versus 24) and death without recurrence (2 versus 2). Forty-two (23 versus 19) deaths of any cause occurred. The estimated adjusted hazard ratio for goserelin versus CMF (intention-to-treat analysis) was 0.79 (95% CI=0.54-1.14; P=0.19).

Patients ( n=1640) were randomized to goserelin (3.6 mg every 28 days for 2 years) or CMF (sixx28-day cycles) treatment. In a protocoled sub-study involving 96 patients from eight centers (goserelin: n=53; CMF: n=43), lumbar spine (L2-L4) and femoral neck BMD were assessed by dual X-ray absorptiometry at baseline and then annually for 3 years. At the end of the 2-year goserelin-treatment period, mean BMD losses for goserelin-treated and CMF-treated patients were -10.5% and -6.5% ( P=0.0005) for lumbar spine and -6.4% and -4.5% ( P=0.04) for femoral neck, respectively. At 3 years, partial recovery of BMD was observed in goserelin recipients. In contrast, mean BMD losses for the CMF group indicated persistent BMD loss. No significant differences in BMD were observed between groups at the 3-year assessment of the spine or femoral neck. In the CMF group, based on amenorrhea status at 48 weeks, BMD losses at the lumbar spine were greater for amenorrheic than non-amenorrheic patients. Ovarian suppression resulting in amenorrhea was closely related to BMD loss in both treatment groups. Overall, patients who received CMF did not show recovery of BMD throughout follow-up, whereas partial recovery was observed 1 year after cessation of goserelin therapy, associated with the return of ovarian function in the majority of patients."
CD008018,0,8921104,0,Prevention of irreversible chemotherapy-induced ovarian damage in young women with lymphoma by a gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonist in parallel to chemotherapy.,"To examine whether the concomitant administration of a gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) during combination chemotherapy to young women with lymphoma may facilitate preservation of gonadal function, a prospective clinical protocol was undertaken in 18 cycling women with lymphoma, aged 15-40 years. Thirteen patients suffered from Hodgkin disease (HD) and 5 from non-Hodgkin lymphoma. After informed consent a monthly injection of depot D-TRP6-GnRHa was administered for a maximum of 6 months starting prior to chemotherapy. Most of these patients (15/18) were treated with the MOPP/ABV(D) combination chemotherapy followed by mantle field irradiation in 10 patients. Hormonal profile [luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), oestradiol, testosterone, progesterone, insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1, prolactin] was taken before the GnRHa/chemotherapy co-treatment, and monthly thereafter until resuming spontaneous ovulation and menses. This group of prospectively treated lymphoma patients was compared to a matched control group of 18 women (aged 17-40 years) who have been treated with chemotherapy, mostly MOPP/ABV (14/18), with (11) or without (7) mantle field radiotherapy. Fourteen had Hodgkin's and four non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Gonadal function was determined clinically, hormonally (LH, FSH, oestradiol, progesterone), and sonographically. Two of the patients in each group died from refractory disease. Of the remaining 16 patients, 15 (93.7%) resumed spontaneous ovulation and menses within 3-8 months of termination of the combined chemotherapy/GnRHa co-treatment. In contrast, only seven (39%) of the 18 similarly treated patients in the control group (chemotherapy without GnRHa) resumed ovarian cyclic activity (regular menses). The other 11 experienced premature ovarian failure (POF) (61%). Out preliminary data suggest a possible significant protective effect of GnRHa co-treatment with chemotherapy from irreversible ovarian damage (POF)."

A 73-year-old man presented with a three-months history of progressive right proptosis associated with increasing diplopia in down-gaze and slightly decreased visual acuity. Gadolinium-MRI scans of the head revealed a left osteoblastic intrasellar mass, displacing the pituitary gland. Laboratory testing revealed a serum PSA level of 22 ng/ml. Transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy revealed prostatic adenocarcinoma (Gleason score 4+3) in both lobes of the prostate. A bone scan was performed showing that the patient had multiple secondary bony lesions. Total androgen blockade was initiated. Moreover, he was referred for radiotherapy of this metastatic lesion to the sella turcica. The visual complaints regressed dramatically within the first month of the treatment. A follow-up MRI scan at 6 months showed almost complete involution of the orbital metastatic process. However the disease subsequently progressed and the patient died 22 months after diagnosis."
CD008018,0,11223377,0,Ovarian rescue/protection from chemotherapeutic agents.,"After improved long-term survival in young women with lymphoma and leukemia undergoing chemotherapy, preservation of future fertility has been the focus of recent interest. The investigational endeavors of ovarian cryopreservation await the clinical experience of in vitro maturation of thawed primordial follicles, their in vitro fertilization, and embryo transfer. Although promising, this experience is not yet available. Moreover, the risk of possible reimplantation of malignant stem cells with the thawed cryoperserved ovary has been raised after experimental animal observations. Therefore, until these innovative endeavors prove successful, and in parallel with them, we attempted to minimize the gonadotoxic effect of chemotherapy by the cotreatment with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonistic analogue to induce a temporary prepubertal milieu. Whereas inhibin-B concentrations in serum may reflect the ovarian granulosa cell compartment, inhibin-A reflects luteal function. Immunoreactive inhibin-A and -B in these patients before, during, and after gonadotoxic chemotherapy were measured."

CD008018,0,9086334,0,Influence of goserelin depot therapy on epidermal growth factor receptor expression in pelvic endometriosis.,"We have studied epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor expression in endometrium and in endometriotic implants, testing a group of 36 women before and after a 4-month gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analog (GnRH-a) goserelin depot treatment. Each woman underwent laparoscopy twice. At the initial laparoscopy, before starting treatment, the disease was staged according to the American Fertility Society (AFS) classification and biopsies of endometriotic implants were undertaken. The follow-up laparoscopy was performed within 5 weeks of the last GnRH-a administration. Biopsies were taken from areas of previously noted disease, both visually persistent and visually free of disease. At the time of each laparoscopy, photographs of all areas of disease were taken. Specimens of eutopic endometrium were collected from each patient at the time of laparoscopy by a Novak curette. Endometrial and endometriotic samples were processed for immunohistochemical detection of EGF receptor, using anti-EGF receptor monoclonal antibody Ab-3. After treatment, the marked improvement of AFS score was associated with a dramatic reduction of EGF receptor immunostaining, but the exact meaning of this finding is still not completely understood. The dramatic reduction of EGF receptor expression in eutopic and ectopic endometrium samples after treatment is not obviously related to the hypoestrogenism induced by the drug. It has been suggested that steroid hormones and EGF play a role in regulation of EGF receptor expression, so that drugs such as goserelin depot could act directly at local peripheral level influencing the EGF receptor expression via the production of its ligand."

CD008018,0,26613834,0,New insights on the role of luteinizing hormone releasing hormone agonists in premenopausal early breast cancer patients.,"Luteinising hormone releasing hormone agonists (LH-RHa) are effective in the treatment of advanced endocrine-sensitive breast cancer in premenopausal patients, but their role in the adjuvant setting has remained controversial for a long time. Tamoxifen for 5 years has been traditionally considered the standard endocrine therapy for premenopausal patients and this is still valid for many patients. However, the recently reported SOFT trial has suggested that adding ovarian function suppression (OFS) to tamoxifen could improve DFS in women at sufficient risk to warrant adjuvant chemotherapy and who remained premenopausal after this therapy. The administration of an aromatase inhibitor plus OFS represents an additional therapeutic option for hormone-receptor positive premenopausal breast cancer patients, according to the combined analysis of the SOFT and TEXT trials. Temporary ovarian suppression induced by LH-RHa has been recognized as an effective strategy to preserve ovarian function from the toxic effects of chemotherapy and is now recommended in young breast cancer patients with endocrine-insensitive tumors. In this review, we discuss recent data on the role of LH-RHa in combination with tamoxifen or with an aromatase inhibitor, and we comment on its role as a strategy to preserve ovarian function in young patients candidates for adjuvant or neo-adjuvant chemotherapy."

Techniques are now available for fertility preservation, such as cryopreservation of mature oocytes, embryos or ovarian cortical tissue. Whereas collection of mature oocytes and embryos requires at least a 2-week period, ovarian tissue may on short notice be frozen prior to treatment and can be transplanted back into women with ovarian failure. Transplanted frozen/thawed tissue supports survival and growth of follicles, giving rise to menstrual cycles and hormone production for several years. Worldwide, the procedure has resulted in the birth of 15 healthy children. Many cancer patients including girls and young women want fertility preservation, and the techniques are now being further developed and implemented in several centers."

In an open, multicentre phase III study, the efficacy, tolerance and safety of the Gn-RH agonist leuprorelin acetate were tested. The preliminary results of 104 women treated in seven German centres are presented. Pelvic endometriosis was diagnosed by laparoscopy and classified according to the American Fertility Society scoring system: 33% of patients had minimal, 22% mild, 28% moderate and 8% severe endometriosis and in 9% no pathological results were obtained. The patients' mean age was 30 +/- 6 years and 66 had infertility problems. Treatment was started within the first 3 days of the menstrual cycle and consisted of a subcutaneous injection of leuprorelin acetate 3.75 mg, repeated once monthly over 24 weeks. A follow-up period of 12 months after the last injection has been completed in 70 patients, including a second laparoscopy. At all visits, symptoms were evaluated, physical examinations performed, and blood samples collected for haematological screening, serum chemistry determinations and measurement of the gonadotrophins oestradiol and progesterone and leuprorelin acetate. The median score at laparoscopy fell from 12 before operation to 8 after operation and 2 after treatment with leuprorelin acetate. Of the total number of patients, 89% had improvements in their endometriosis, 8% a deterioration and 3% no change. Patients reported improvement in the following: dysmenorrhoea 93%, dyspareunia 62% and pelvic pain 70%. However, all women complained of at least one of the following symptoms: hot flushes 86%, sleep disturbance 62%, sweating 61%, headache 41%, nausea 32% and depression 20%. Fifty-five percent of patients reported additional side effects such as vaginal dryness, fatigue and lower abdominal pain. After the third injection, amenorrhoea persisted in 94% of the women. Four weeks after the first leuprorelin acetate injection median concentrations of oestradiol fell from 45 pg/ml to 11 pg/ml, follicle-stimulating hormone from 7 U/L to 3 U/L and luteinising hormone from 5 U/L to 1 U/L and remained almost unchanged over the observation period. During the 6 months' treatment, laboratory parameters showed no significant deviations from normal; only total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and alkaline phosphatase increased. Treatment results were judged as good and satisfactory in 82% and 11% of cases, respectively. On the basis of this study, it can be concluded that leuprorelin acetate treatment is safe, well tolerated and effective in the medical management of endometriosis and endometriosis-related complaints."

CD008018,0,11447732,0,Prospective randomized study comparing the GnRH-agonist leuprorelin acetate and the gestagen lynestrenol in the treatment of severe endometriosis.,"Endometriosis is thought to be an ovarian-dependent benign disease that affects up to 12% of women during their reproductive life. For the past ten years the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)-agonists have been proved effective and safe drugs in the treatment of endometriosis. Nevertheless, gestagens such as lynestrenol still remain the most often used hormonal drugs for the treatment of this disease. The primary objective of this study was to compare the efficacy of the GnRH-agonist leuprorelin acetate depot (LAD) (Enantone-Gyn) 3.75 mg subcutaneously per month with that of the gestagen lynestrenol (LYN) (Orgametril) 5 mg orally twice per day in women with severe endometriosis, in terms of postoperative revised American Fertility Society (r-AFS) scores I-IV at first-look laparoscopy (score after removal of endometriotic lesions or adhesions) to the r-AFS score after six months' treatment. Secondary objectives were the improvement of clinical symptoms and the side-effect profile. Forty-eight women with postoperative r-AFS scores I-IV were evaluated in an open prospective randomized study between 1996 and 1998. All the participants underwent a first-look laparoscopy with resection of endometriotic lesions and six months' therapy with one of the above mentioned drugs, and a further second-look laparoscopy. The six months' treatment with LAD or LYN led to a significant reduction of the r-AFS score points in both groups. The mean r-AFS score in points for the LAD group after the first-look laparoscopy was 21.8 and was 27.2 for the LYN group. After the medical treatment a mean value of 11.5 points was observed in the LAD group compared with a mean value of 25.5 in the LYN group. This difference was statistically significant (p = 0.000014, Wilcoxon test). The improvement in the symptoms of dysmenorrhea, chronic pelvic pain and dyspareunia was also more pronounced in the LAD-treated group. LAD was more effective than LYN in the suppression of circulating serum 17 beta-estradiol levels after 6 months of treatment (mean 27.7 +/- 9.3 pg/ml versus 42.6 +/- 59.3 pg/ml). All the observed side-effects were deemed tolerable by the women who participated in this study. As the reduction of the r-AFS score in points was much more pronounced in the LAD group than in the LYN group, GnRH-agonists should therefore be used as first-choice drugs in the treatment of endometriosis. Due to the limited treatment of 6 months' duration of GnRH-agonists, gestagens might be used as second-line drugs for long-term and continuous treatment in the management of endometriosis to maintain the primary beneficial effect of GnRH-agonist treatment in patients who have completed their families."

CD008018,0,2961786,0,Changes in growth and serum growth hormone and plasma somatomedin-C levels during suppression of gonadal sex steroid secretion in girls with central precocious puberty.,"Suppression of gonadal sex steroid secretion in children with central precocious puberty (CPP) by LHRH analogs affords an opportunity to study sex steroid modulation of GH and somatomedin-C (Sm-C) secretion and to examine the role of GH and Sm-C in pubertal and prepubertal statural growth. Nocturnal serum GH and plasma Sm-C levels were measured in 10 preadrenarchal girls [mean age, 3.0 +/- 0.6] ( +/- SEM) yr with CPP before and during 2 yr of LHRH analog-induced gonadal suppression. Their mean height velocity, initially 4.6 +/- 0.6 ( +/- SEM) SD above the mean for chronological age, decreased to -0.1 +/- 0.4 SD during 12-24 months of ovarian suppression (P less than 0.00005). The mean peak nocturnal plasma GH level was 22.5 +/- 5.4 ( +/- SEM) micrograms/L during puberty, and it decreased to 10.2 +/- 2.1 micrograms/L after 3 months of suppression of gonadarche. This decrease persisted throughout the 2 yr of gonadal suppression (P less than 0.05). The reduction in GH secretion was accompanied by a decrease in mean plasma Sm-C levels from 3.5 +/- 0.7 to 1.5 +/- 0.2 U/mL after 3 months of suppression of gonadal sex steroids, which persisted during 2 yr of gonadal suppression (P less than 0.01). Suppression of ovarian function in girls with CPP results in decreased height velocity. This slowing of growth occurs in association with decreased nocturnal serum GH and plasma Sm-C levels, suggesting that acceleration of growth during puberty is partially mediated by sex steroid-induced augmentation of GH secretion."

In high BMI group (>25 kg/m²), the ULA protocol yielded significant higher clinic pregnancy rate (PR) (70.2% versus 50.8%, p < 0.05), implantation rate (52.7% versus 35.7%, p < 0.05) and live birth rate (63.8% versus 39.0%, p < 0.05) when compared with LA protocol. In low BMI group (≤25 kg/m²), the ULA protocol also demonstrated a higher clinic PR (70.8% versus 59.5%, p < 0.05) whereas implantation rate and live birth rate are comparable. Within ULA protocol, the clinic PR, implantation rate and live birth rate are similar between high and low BMI patients. Similarly, the clinic PR and live birth rate demonstrated no significant difference within LA group but there is a significant lower implantation rate (35.7% versus 63.9%, p < 0.05) observed in high BMI patients.

These findings suggest the presence of an autocrine regulatory system based on LHRH. Recent studies in our laboratory have demonstrated that the function of LHRH produced by ovarian cancer cells is the inhibition of their proliferation. Dose-dependent antiproliferative effects of LHRH-agonists have been observed by several laboratories in cell lines derived from the above cancers. Interestingly, also LHRH-antagonists have marked antiproliferative activity in most of the ovarian, breast and endometrial cancer cell lines tested so far, indicating that the dichotomy of LHRH-agonists/LHRH-antagonists is not valid for the LHRH-system in cancer cells. In addition, our data suggest that the classical LHRH receptor signal transduction mechanisms known from the pituitary (phospholipase-C, protein kinase C, adenylyl cyclase) are not involved in the mediation of LHRH effects in cancer cells. Data obtained by several groups, including ours, rather suggest that LHRH analogs interfere with the signal transduction of growth-factor receptors and related oncogene products associated with tyrosine-kinase activity. The mechanism of action is probably an LHRH-induced activation of a phosphotyrosine phosphatase, counteracting the effects of receptor associated tyrosine kinase. In our hands, LHRH analogs virtually blocked the EGF-induced MAP-kinase activity of ovarian and endometrial cancer cells. The pharmacological exploitation of this mechanism might provide promising new therapies for these cancers."

Adjuvant goserelin monotherapy has similar efficacy to adjuvant chemotherapy in pre- or perimenopausal women with early, hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. Furthermore, the addition of goserelin to adjuvant chemotherapy appeared to offer an advantage over chemotherapy alone in younger patients. Fewer patients remained amenorrheic after goserelin therapy than after chemotherapy. Complete endocrine blockade provided by the addition of tamoxifen to therapy including goserelin appears to improve outcomes. Thus, goserelin offers a valuable addition to the currently available options for treating pre- or perimenopausal women with hormone therapy-responsive early breast cancer, particularly for women wishing to regain ovarian function after treatment."

They were compared to contemporaneously studied groups of adult normal and hyperandrogenic women. We found that hyperandrogenic adolescents had clinical and endocrine features similar to those of hyperandrogenic adults. However, there were some noteworthy unique features of adolescent hyperandrogenism, such as presentation in mid-childhood with premature pubarche and the occasional diagnosis before the age of 10 years. Some differences between adolescents and adults were statistically significant, for example, pelvic ultrasonography was not as helpful in the diagnosis of FOH as it is in adults. Nevertheless, a number of questions about the development of the ovarian dysfunction remain to be answered. For example, we are unable to diagnose ovarian dysfunction before puberty or in early puberty, and the relationship of ""physiologic adolescent anovulation"" to PCOS remains to be defined."

Although some of these tumours are asymptomatic, up to 50% cause symptoms severe enough to warrant therapy and surgery is the standard treatment. Fibroid growth is stimulated by oestrogen and gonadotropin releasing hormone agonists (GnRHa) which induce a state of hypoestrogenism have been investigated as a potential treatment.

Therefore, GnRHa may be useful pre-operatively both to reduce fibroid and uterine volume and control bleeding."
CD008018,0,9436663,0,Dual suppression with oral contraceptives and gonadotrophin releasing-hormone agonists improves in-vitro fertilization outcome in high responder patients.,"Certain patients have a tendency for high response to gonadotrophin therapy which is often not ameliorated with prior gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) suppression. As a result, these patients are frequently cancelled and often experience ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) episodes during in-vitro fertilization (IVF)-embryo transfer cycles. Patients with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) have been noted to be particularly sensitive to exogenous gonadotrophin therapy. We have developed a protocol which is effective in improving IVF outcome in high responder patients, including those with PCOS. Oral contraceptive pills (OCP) are taken for 25 days followed by s.c. leuprolide acetate, 1 mg/day, which is overlapped with the final 5 days of oral contraceptive administration. Low-dose gonadotrophin stimulation is then initiated on the third day of withdrawal bleeding in the form of either human menopausal gonadotrophins or purified urinary follicle-stimulating hormone at a dosage of 150 IU/day. Over a 5 year period, we reviewed our experience utilizing this dual method of suppression in 99 cycles obtained in 73 high responder patients. There were only 13 cancellations prior to embryo transfer (13.1%). The clinical and ongoing pregnancy rates per initiated cycle were 46.5 and 40.4% respectively. Only eight patients experienced mild-moderate OHSS following treatment. For those patients who had undergone previous IVF-embryo transfer cycles at our centre, significant improvements were noted in oocyte fertilization rates, embryo implantation rates and clinical/ongoing pregnancy rates with this protocol. Hormonal analyses revealed that the chief mechanism may be through an improved luteinizing hormone/follicle-stimulating hormone ratio following dual suppression. An additional feature of this dual method of suppression is significantly lower serum androgen concentrations, particularly dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate."

CD008018,0,26249119,0,Picking the optimal endocrine adjuvant treatment for pre-menopausal women.,"Endocrine treatments are key component of the adjuvant strategy for pre-menopausal patients with luminal tumors. Treatment options should be based not only upon the risk of relapse and level of endocrine responsiveness, but also on co-morbidities, preferences of the patient and degree of side effects. Tamoxifen should still be considered as an appropriate endocrine therapy in a large group of premenopausal patients (e.g. lower risk patient, presence of co-morbidities, patient preference). However, the results of the SOFT and TEXT trials, evaluating the value of ovarian function suppression (OFS) as well as the role of adjuvant aromatase inhibitor (AI), raised questions about the use of tamoxifen alone in selected higher risk patient. In the SOFT study, premenopausal patients did not benefit from the addition of OFS, but for those women at sufficient risk of recurrence to deserve adjuvant chemotherapy and who maintained pre-menopausal estradiol, the addition of OFS to tamoxifen reduced the risk of recurrence. Moreover, in the TEXT trial, adjuvant treatment with exemestane plus OFS, as compared with tamoxifen plus OFS, significantly improved disease-free survival, breast cancer-free interval and distant disease-free survival, thus representing a new treatment option. Recent available information on endocrine options for younger patients with luminal tumors support the use of tailored endocrine treatments. Issues specific for younger patients related to pregnancies desire, family planning, safety, quality of life and subjective side effects should be a priority in the therapeutic algorithm."

CD008018,0,1828640,0,Medical castration with zoladex: a conservative approach to premenopausal breast cancer.,"For almost a century surgical castration represented the initial standard therapy for metastatic breast cancer in premenopausal women with hormone dependent tumors. Today the suppression of ovarian function can also be obtained by the administration of supraphysiologic doses of luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists. From April 1987 to February 1989, 23 premenopausal patients with advanced breast cancer (median age 39 years, range 28-52, ER positive 20, unknown 3; prior chemotherapy 17) were treated with the LHRH agonist goserelin depot (Zoladex) at the dose of 3.6 mg. every 4 weeks. Twenty-two patients were evaluable. Serum levels of 17 beta estradiol, progesterone, FSH and LH were suppressed by goserelin and fell to postmenopausal values within 8 weeks of therapy in 77% of cases. Complete response (CR) plus partial response (PR) was documented in 7 of 22 (32%) and occurred in all major sites of disease. Five patients achieved CR (soft tissue 3, viscera 2). Response rate was higher in patients not previously treated with chemotherapy (4/6). In the present series, all responses were seen in women greater than 35 years old, regularly menstruating at the start of treatment. Time to progression for the entire case series was 22 weeks and for responders 64 weeks. Oophorectomy was performed after disease progression in four patients without success. Goserelin was well tolerated. Local cutaneous dyschromia occurred in 45% and hot flushes in 82%. Treatment efficacy of goserelin is comparable to that of oophorectomy, without the psychological trauma and the morbidity related to surgical castration."

Areas covered: This review updates triptorelin depot treatment of CPP, focusing on trials that compared 3.75 mg/28 day treated and untreated children till the adult height (AH). Efficacy of the new 11.25 mg/90 days or 22.5 mg/6 month formulations in suppressing pituitary-gonadal axis in short-term trials is also addressed. Short- and long-term safety was summarized. Expert commentary: Long experience on triptorelin depot use in children with CPP is available. Outcome differences on AH are reported; they may be due to heterogenicity of treated patients; some items remain to be optimized. No long term-adverse events on reproductive function are reported; additional studies would clarify if CPP per sè or triptorelin depot administration may increase hyperandrogenism and/or polycystic ovary syndrome risk in adulthood. The quarterly formulation seems to be able to suppress pituitary-gonadal axis and pubertal development and to determine similar end-results as monthly formulation, but additional trials are needed. Few data are available for the 22.5 mg/6 month formulation. Triptorelin depot treatment of CPP should be restricted to tertiary pediatric endocrinology centers, considering that some uncertainties still exist and that rare but serious adverse events may occur."

They act by binding to pituitary LH-RH receptors, resulting in down regulation of receptors and subsequent suppression of luteinising hormone and estradiol. LH-RHa are effective in the treatment of advanced breast cancer in premenopausal women but their role as adjuvant treatment of early breast cancer is still controversial. Approximately 60% of tumors in premenopausal women are hormone sensitive and these patients are candidates for hormonal treatment. Tamoxifen for 5 years is considered the standard endocrine therapy for all premenopausal women with hormone sensitive breast cancer. There is no definitive evidence of additional benefit associated with the use of LH-RHa administered as an alternative or in addition to tamoxifen. In this review we discuss available data on the role of LH-RHa alone or in combination with tamoxifen; on the role of LH-RHa in combination with aromatase inhibitors; and on the potential role of LH-RHa as a strategy to preserve ovarian function during adjuvant chemotherapy."

However, it has been very difficult to either predict or understand why some women respond, while others do not. We applied several complementary statistical methods to the dynamics of pre-treatment mood rating data to determine possible predictors of response for women with PMDD. We compared responders (n = 33) to nonresponders (n = 12) in clinical trials of leuprolide (three months in duration) as a treatment for PMDD, on the basis of pre-trial daily self-ratings of sadness, anxiety, and irritability. We analyzed both sequential irregularity (approximate entropy, ApEn) and a quantification of spikiness of these series, as well as a composite measure that equally weighted these two statistics. Both ApEn and Spikiness were significantly smaller for responders than nonresponders (P ≤ 0.005); the composite measure was smaller for responders compared with nonresponders (P ≤ 0.002) and discriminated between the subgroups with high sensitivity and specificity. In contrast, mean symptom levels were indistinct between the subgroups. Relatively regular and non-spiky pre-trial dynamics of mood ratings predict a positive response to leuprolide by women with PMDD with high probability, moreover based on typically less than 3 months of daily records. The statistical measures may have broad and direct applicability to behavioral studies for many psychiatric disorders, facilitating both accurate diagnosis and the prediction of response to treatment."

The use of gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues given in combination with chemotherapy has been studied in reproductive age women. The exact mechanism is unknown, but some of the proposed protective mechanisms could theoretically protect the prepubertal ovary as it has been theorized in many of the studies on reproductive age women. None of the studies implies an adverse affect of GnRH analogue administration in terms of worsening health or cancer status.

Whereas the cytotoxic-induced damage is reversible in other tissues of rapidly dividing cells such as bone marrow, gastrointestinal tract and thymus, it appears to be progressive and irreversible in the ovary, where the number of germ cells is limited, fixed since the fetal life, and cannot be regenerated. The gonadal toxicity of cyclophosphamide is well known. In patients with lupus nephritis, premature ovarian failure (POF) was reported in half of all treated women after cyclophosphamide pulse therapy, affecting 100% of those older than 30 y, about 50% of the patients between the ages of 20-30y and only 13% of the patients younger than 20y of age. Following our preliminary encouraging experience in women with lymphoma, whereby the temporary induction of a prepubertal hormonal milieu, during chemotherapy, has significantly decreased the risk of POF, we have administered a monthly injection of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonistic analogue (GnRH-a) to eight young women in parallel to alkylating agent chemotherapy."

It is uniquely characterized by oligomenorrhoea or amenorrhoea associated with normal or high oestrogen levels. This prospective clinical study was designed to examine the possible role of the lack of cyclical exposure to progesterone in the development of gonadotrophin and androgen abnormalities in PCOS. Gonadotrophin, androgen and oestrogen levels were measured in 15 PCOS patients and 10 normal subjects untreated and following treatment with the progestogen medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA). When compared to control subjects, PCOS patients had significantly higher luteinizing hormone (LH) pulse height, pulse amplitude, integrated LH levels, LH response to gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and LH/FSH ratio; LH pulse frequency was similar in the two groups. In addition, the testosterone/sex hormone binding globulin ratio (T/SHBG), androstenedione and oestrone concentrations in the plasma were significantly higher in PCOS than in control subjects. When PCOS patients were treated with MPA for 5 days, there were significant decreases (p < 0.02-0.001) to values no longer different from normal: from 8.7 +/- 1.2 to 5.6 +/- 0.8 IU/l for integrated LH levels (untreated and MPA-treated PCOS); from 31.2 +/- 3.5 to 12.9 +/- 1.5 IU/l for LH response to GnRH; from 2.4 +/- 0.26 to 1.3 +/- 0.2 for LH/FSH ratio; and from 10.4 +/- 0.63 to 8.5 +/- 0.7 nmol/l for androstenedione. Significant decreases (p < 0.05-0.005) to values that still remained significantly higher than in normal subjects occurred for: LH pulse height, 11.05 +/- 1.3 to 6.88 +/- 0.79 IU/l (untreated and MPA-treated PCOS); LH pulse amplitude, 2.8 +/- 0.5 to 1.8 +/- 0.2 IU/l; total testosterone, 2.5 +/- 0.2 to 2.0 +/- 0.2 nmol/l; T/SHBG ratio, 14.1 +/- 1.7 to 11 +/- 1.5; and oestrone, 265 +/- 24 to 208 +/- 29 pmol/l.

A common adjuvant treatment for this patient population is chemotherapy, which has been shown to cause premature menopause and infertility with serious consequences to quality of life. Luteinizing-hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists, which induce temporary ovarian function suppression (OFS), has been shown to be a useful alternative to chemotherapy in the adjuvant setting for estrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer patients. LHRH agonists have the potential to preserve fertility after treatment, thus, reducing the negative effects on a patient's reproductive health. However, little is known about the association between a patient's underlying degree of OFS and disease-free survival (DFS) after receiving LHRH agonists. Specifically, we are interested in whether patients with lower underlying degrees of OFS (i.e. higher estrogen production) after taking LHRH agonists are at a higher risk for late breast cancer events. In this paper, we propose a latent class joint model (LCJM) to analyze a data set from International Breast Cancer Study Group (IBCSG) Trial VIII to investigate the association between OFS and DFS. Analysis of this data set is challenging due to the fact that the main outcome of interest, OFS, is unobservable and the available surrogates for this latent variable involve masked event and cured proportions. We employ a likelihood approach and the EM algorithm to obtain parameter estimates and present results from the IBCSG data analysis."

The role of GnRH analogs (GnRHa) and oral contraceptives (OC) in the prevention of CIOF is questionable. We performed a systematic review and a meta-analysis of studies assessing the efficacy of hormonal interventions in reducing CIOF in cancer or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients treated with chemotherapy. MEDLINE, EMBASE, and conference proceedings were searched until October 2009. From 504 potentially relevant references, 21 comparative studies were included for review and analysis. Data were collected to determine the risk ratio (RR) for amenorrhea, FSH levels, pregnancy rate, and biomarkers for ovarian reserve. Sixteen studies (SLE: 4 studies, 85 patients; malignancy: 12 studies, 596 patients) which assessed GnRHa for fertility preservation prior to chemotherapy were included in the meta-analysis. Five studies which evaluated the use of OC were systematically reviewed. Meta-analysis revealed that GnRHa are effective in reducing amenorrhea rates in all patients (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.14-0.49). Pregnancy rate was higher in the GnRHa arm. The advantage of GnRHa was shown only in observational studies, but not in randomized controlled trials. Biomarkers for ovarian reserve were similar in both arms. Studies evaluating the efficacy of oral contraceptives in preserving ovarian function showed inconclusive results. GnRHa appears to improve menstruation resumption. Nevertheless, randomized prospective trials are less conclusive for their real value in conserving ovarian reserve and pregnancy. Large-scale prospective randomized trials are warranted to evaluate the role of GnRHa in preventing CIOF."

CD008018,0,17980497,0,Gonadotropin hormone releasing hormone agonists alter prefrontal function during verbal encoding in young women.,"Gonadotropin hormone releasing hormone agonists (GnRHa) are commonly used in clinical practice to suppress gonadal hormone production in the management of various gynaecological conditions and as a treatment for advanced breast and prostate cancer. Animal and human behavioural studies suggest that GnRHa may also have significant effects on memory. However, despite the widespread use of GnRHa, the underlying brain networks and/or stages of memory processing that might be modulated by GnRHa remain poorly understood. We used event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine the effect of GnRHa on verbal encoding and retrieval. Neuroimaging outcomes from 15 premenopausal healthy women were assessed at baseline and 8 weeks after Gonadotrophin Releasing Hormone analogue (GnRHa) treatment. Fifteen matched wait-listed volunteers served as the control group and were assessed at similar intervals during the late follicular phase of the menstrual cycle. GnRHa was associated with changes in brain response during memory encoding but not retrieval. Specifically, GnRHa administration led to a change in the typical pattern of prefrontal activation during successful encoding, with decreased activation in left prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate, and medial frontal gyrus. Our study suggests that the memory difficulties reported by some women following GnRHa, and possibly at other times of acute ovarian hormone withdrawal (e.g. following surgical menopause and postpartum), may have a clear neurobiological basis; one that manifest during encoding of words and that is evident in decreased activation in prefrontal regions known to sub-serve deep processing of to-be-learned words."

CD008018,0,23684357,0,Goserelin can inhibit ovarian cancer proliferation and simultaneously protect ovarian function from cisplatin: an in vitro and in vivo study.,"This study investigates whether goserelin can inhibit ovarian cancer proliferation and protect ovarian function from cisplatin (CDDP). We evaluated proliferation and AKT phosphorylation in goserelin-treated ES-2 and SKOV3-ip ovarian cancer cells. Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) in human granulosa cells (hGCs) cotreated with goserelin and CDDP was measured by ELISA. Tumour volumes, Ki-67 expression, estrus, follicles, ovarian volumes, and serum AMH were compared in nude mice bearing transplanted tumours treated with goserelin and/or CDDP. Our results showed that goserelin inhibited cellular proliferation and AKT phosphorylation in vitro, and inhibited tumour growth and Ki-67 expression in vivo. Goserelin and CDDP cotreatment decreased the estrus cycles of the nude mice and prolonged estrus duration. Goserelin abrogated the CDDP-induced down-regulation of primary and preantral follicle percentage and ovarian volume. Goserelin increased AMH secretion in vitro and in vivo. In conclusion, goserelin inhibited ovarian cancer proliferation and simultaneously protected ovarian function from CDDP."

In autoimmune diseases, alkylating agents are also used and it is now established that 20 g as a cumulative dose of cyclophosphamide is associated with premature ovarian failure in 50% of 20-year-old patients. Several strategies are discussed and offered to these patients to prevent the ovarian failure: GnRH agonist treatment, in vitro fertilization and embryos cryopreservation, oocytes cryopreservation and ovarian cortex cryopreservation. These techniques might also be associated one with the other. A survey was conducted in France in order to assess the practices realised in these diseases. Four centres were asked for these diseases, concerning 17 patients (mean age: 26.2 +/- 1.8 SEM [15-43]) and systemic lupus erythematosus was the most frequent disease (7/17). Ovarian cortex cryopreservation was realised for 6 patients. Embryos or oocytes cryopreservation was realised for 2 patients including one where ovarian cortex cryopreservation was associated. In 10 cases, considering the treatment and the patient's wish no fertility preservation was realised.

CD008018,0,6787988,0,Testicular function after combination chemotherapy in childhood for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.,"We have assessed testicular function with luteinising hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH) and human chorionic gonadotrophin stimulation tests in 44 boys previously treated with, or currently receiving, chemotherapy for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). At the same time a testicular biopsy was performed in each boy and the morphology was studied. Histologically the chemotherapy appeared to damage the tubular system in particular, and the degree of damage was assessed by estimating the tubular fertility (TF) index which is defined as the percentage of seminiferous tubules containing identifiable spermatogonia. The mean TF index in all 44 biopsies was 51%. Only 2 of the 44 boys showed an absent or blunted testosterone response to human chorionic gonadotrophin. This suggests that Leydig cell function is rarely impaired by such chemotherapy and that most of the boys, similarly treat for ALL, will undergo normal pubertal maturation. Apart from the basal luteinising hormone (LH) levels in the prepubertal group which could not be compared, the median basal serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), LH, and testosterone concentrations, the median peak FSH and LH responses to LH-RH, and the mean plasma testosterone responses to human chorionic gonadotrophin stimulation did not differ between the prepubertal, early pubertal, and late pubertal groups compared with normal boys of similar pubertal maturation. Three of 32 prepubertal ALL boys, and 5 of 12 pubertal ALL boys showed abnormalities of gonadotrophin secretion. The increased frequency of abnormalities of FSH secretion in the pubertal ALL boys compared with the prepubertal ALL boys could not be explained by more severe tubular damage in the former group. We conclude that moderately severe damage to the tubular system of the testis unassociated with Leydig cell impairment may not be detected in the prepubertal boy with current tests of testicular function."

In spite of anecdotal reports of incomplete suppression by some depot GnRH-A, this issue has never been systematically investigated in adult women. Thus, we elected to study 40 normally cycling women with male-related infertility or benign reproductive disorders; each group of 10 subjects received a different GnRH-A for 3 months: buserelin (group B; 300 micrograms, sc, every 12 h, as a control), goserelin (group G; 3.6 mg, sc, every 28 days), leuprorelin (group L; 3.75 mg, im, every 28 days), and triptorelin (group T; 3.75 mg, im, every 28 days). Depot GnRH-A was administered by one of the investigators. GnRH tests (100 micrograms, iv) were performed before treatment (cycle day 7; test A) and on treatment days 57 (i.e. 1 day after the third depot GnRH-A; test B) and 84 (i.e. 28 days after the third depot GnRH-A; test C). Immunoreactive (i) LH levels were measured with an ultrasensitive immunochemiluminometric assay. Profound suppression of the iLH response to the GnRH test occurred in all subjects during treatment. Conversely, FSH levels in the third month of treatment tended to be higher in the depot GnRH-A groups than in group B, and this difference achieved statistical significance (P < 0.05) in groups G and L during test C. In GnRH test B, while the mean estradiol (E2) level was less than 75 pmol/L (< 20 pg/mL) in all group B subjects, individual E2 levels were greater than 75 pmol/L in five patients receiving depot GnRH-A (two in group G, one in L, and two in T). Finally, individual E2 levels during test C were greater than 75 pmol/L in only two patients of group G, who also reported vaginal spotting. Thus, we conclude that in adult women, 1) iLH was profoundly suppressed in the third month of administration of all GnRH-A tested; 2) FSH suppression with depot GnRH-A was less marked than that with high-dose short-acting sc buserelin; and 3) signs of an incomplete block of ovarian function can be present in the third month of depot GnRH-A administration, particularly when goserelin is employed."

CD008018,0,26844558,0,Immunotherapy and Hormone-therapy in Metastatic Breast Cancer: A Review and an Update.,"Historically, antiestrogen is the first targeted therapy used in breast cancer treatment. In fact, its rationale lies in the molecular pathways elucidated by basic research. In estrogen receptor (ER)-alpha positive metastatic breast cancer patients, hormone-therapy remains the first option of treatment. While tamoxifen concomitant with suppression of ovarian function with luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists is the standard first line treatment in premenopausal, third generation aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are the first line standard hormone therapy in postmenopausal. However, the development of acquired resistance during antiestrogen therapy continues to be a central clinical problem. This review provides an update on the antiestrogen action and report on immunological treatment of the advanced disease by some cytokines. Interleukin-2, interleukin-12 and interferons used alone or in combination demonstrated an anti-tumor action directly and/or through synergism with antiestrogens. A rationale for the addition of interferon-beta and interleukin-2 to antiestrogens is described. Furthermore, we summarize and interpret the clinical and laboratory data of a recent long-term hormone- immunotherapy study in metastatic endocrine dependent breast cancer patients. Prospective randomized trials are necessary to confirm some recent promising results based on an immunological approach in addition to antiestrogens to overcome or delay acquired hormone resistance."

CD008018,0,12755992,0,Suppression of testosterone stimulates recovery of spermatogenesis after cancer treatment.,"It is important to develop methods to prevent or reverse the infertility caused by chemotherapy or radiation therapy for cancer in men. Radiation and some chemotherapeutic agents kill spermatogonial stem cells, but we have shown that these cells survive in rats, although they are unable to differentiate. There is evidence that this phenomenon also occurs in men. The block to spermatogonial differentiation in rats is caused by some unknown change, either in the spermatogonia or the somatic elements of the testis, such that testosterone inhibits spermatogonial differentiation. In the rat, the spermatogenesis and fertility lost following treatment with radiation or some chemotherapeutic agents can be restored by suppressing testosterone with gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists or antagonists, either before or after the cytotoxic insult. The applicability of this procedure to humans is still unknown. Some anticancer regimens may kill all the stem cells, in which case the only option would be spermatogonial transplantation. However, in some cases stem cells survive and there is one report of stimulation of recovery of spermatogenesis with hormonal treatment. Clinical trials should focus on treating patients with hormones during or soon after anticancer treatment. The hormone regimen should involve suppression of testosterone production with minimum androgen supplementation used to improve the diminished libido."

The aim of this study was to compare the clinical pregnancy rates between follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and human menopausal gonadotrophin (HMG) used in in-vitro fertilization (IVF) cycles. A total of 232 infertile patients, with a mean duration of infertility of 67.1 +/- 32.9 months, were selected for IVF (female age < 38 years, FSH < 15 IU/l, and total motile sperm count > 5 x 10(6)). A short (flare-up) protocol with daily leuprolide acetate was followed randomly from day 3 with FSH (n = 115) or human menopausal gonadotrophin (HMG; n = 117), at an initial dose of two ampoules per day. A maximum of three embryos was transferred, and the luteal phase was supported with four doses of HCG (2500 IU). No differences were observed between the two groups in any of the cycle response variables except fertilization rates per oocyte and per patient, both of which were significantly higher with FSH. Clinical pregnancy rates per cycle initiated, per oocyte retrieval and per embryo transfer were 19.1, 21.0 and 22.7% respectively for FSH, and 12.0, 12.8 and 15.4% respectively for HMG. Whilst these differences were not statistically significant, the results of this interim analysis suggest that HMG may be associated with a lower clinical pregnancy rate than FSH."
CD008018,0,9920060,0,Reproductive axis after discontinuation of gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog treatment of girls with precocious puberty: long term follow-up comparing girls with hypothalamic hamartoma to those with idiopathic precocious puberty.,"Although the GnRH agonist analogs have become an established treatment for precocious puberty, there have been few long term studies of reproductive function and general health after discontinuation of therapy. To this end, we compared peak LH and FSH after 100 microg sc GnRH, estradiol, mean ovarian volume (MOV), age of onset and frequency of menses, body mass (BMI), and incidence of neurological and psychiatric problems in 2 groups of girls: those with precocious puberty due to hypothalamic hamartoma (HH; n 18) and those with idiopathic precocious puberty (IPP; n = 32) who had been treated with deslorelin (4-8 microg/kg x day, s.c.) or histrelin (10 microg/kg x day, s.c.) for 3.1-10.3 yr and were observed at 1, 2, 3, and 4-5 yr after discontinuation of treatment. The endocrine findings were also compared to those in 14 normal perimenarcheal girls. There were no differences between the HH and IPP groups in age or bone age at the start of treatment, at the end of treatment, or during GnRH analog therapy. We found that whereas the peak LH level was higher in HH than in IPP girls before (165.5 +/- 129 vs. 97.5 +/- 55.7; P < 0.02) and at the end (6.8 +/- 6.0 vs. 3.9 +/- 1.8 mIU/mL; P < 0.05) of therapy, this difference did not persist at any of the posttherapy time points. LH, FSH, and estradiol rose into the pubertal range by 1 yr posttherapy in both HH and IPP. However, the mean posttherapy peak LH levels in both HH and IPP groups tended to be lower than normal, whereas the peak FSH levels were not different from normal, so that the overall posttherapy LH/FSH ratio was decreased compared to that in the normal girls (HH, 2.7 +/- 0.3; IPP, 2.6 +/- 0.1; normal, 5.2 +/- 4.8; P < 0.05). The MOV was larger in HH than IPP at the end of treatment (3.7 +/- 3.5 vs. 2.0 +/- 1.2 mL; P < 0.05) and tended to increase in both groups over time to become larger than that in normal girls by 4-5 yr posttherapy (HH, 14.9 +/- 12.9; IPP, 7.6 +/- 2.2; normal, 5.4 +/- 2.5 mL; P < 0.05). Whereas the onset of spontaneous menses varied widely in both groups, once menses had started, the HH group had a higher incidence of oligomenorrhea. Pelvic ultrasonography revealed more than 10-mm hypoechoic regions in 4 HH patients, 15 IPP patients, and 3 normal girls, all of whom were reporting regular menses. Live births of normal infants were reported by 2 HH and 2 IPP patients, and elective terminations of pregnancy were reported by 1 HH and 2 IPP patients. BMI was greater than normal in HH and IPP both before treatment and at all posttherapy time points and tended to be higher in the HH patients. Marked obesity (BMI, +2 to +5.2 SD score) was observed in 5 HH and 6 IPP patients, 1 of whom had a BMI of +2.5 SD score and developed acanthosis nigricans, insulin resistance, and hyperglycemia. Seizure disorders developed during GnRH analog therapy in 5 HH and 1 IPP patient, and 2 additional HH girls developed severe depression and emotional lability posttherapy. Although the mean anterior-posterior dimension of the hamartoma was larger in the HH patients with seizure than in those who were seizure free (1.7 +/- 1.2 vs. 0.9 +/- 0.4 cm; P < 0.05), no change in hamartoma size was observed either during or after therapy, and no patient has reported the onset of a seizure disorder posttherapy. Other than a tendency toward a larger MOV, a higher incidence of oligomenorrhea, obesity, and frequency of neurological disorders, recovery of the reproductive axis after GnRH analog therapy was not markedly different in HH compared to IPP. Continued follow-up of these patients may determine whether the decreased LH responses and increased BMI in both groups compared to those in normal girls remain clinically significant problems."
CD008018,0,2887526,0,Long-acting agonists of LH-RH in the treatment of large ovarian endometriomas.,"Reversible temporary medical oophorectomy using long-acting agonist analogs of LH-RH was tried in three infertile patients suffering from large endometriomas of the ovary. These patients had stage IV disease according to the revised 1985 classification of the American Fertility Society. D-Ala6-des-Gly10-LH-RH propylamide (D-Ala6-LH-RH PA), in a dose of 125 micrograms, was administered intramuscularly every 48 hours to one patient, and daily to the other two patients, for 22, 17, and 14 weeks, respectively. Two patients subsequently received 100 micrograms of D-Trp6-LH-RH for 4 weeks in order to compare its efficacy with D-Ala6-LH-RH PA. Clinical controls, pelvic ultrasonography, and routine laboratory tests and hormone assays were done periodically. Ultrasonography images showed a reduction in the size of endometriomas after the second or third week of treatment. This reduction was maintained throughout and continued after the period of treatment. Suppression of the pituitary and estrogen responses was obtained rapidly, but some transient increments were occasionally found. Progesterone levels always decreased and remained in the range of the early follicular phase. Most intervals of uterine bleeding were prolonged. An evident improvement of abdominal pain, dysmenorrhea, and dyspareunia was found. Administration of D-Trp6-LH-RH was more effective than D-Ala6-LH-RH PA in most of the parameters tested. After discontinuation of treatment, all three patients had a prolonged follicular phase with a normal luteal phase during the first cycle. One woman became pregnant in the fourth cycle after discontinuation of D-Ala6-LH-RH PA and delivered a normal baby.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD008018,0,16455026,0,Selection of optimal adjuvant endocrine therapy for early-stage breast cancer.,"Oophorectomy was found to cause regression of advanced breast cancer toward the end of the 19th century. Decades later, the discovery that estrogen plays a central role in this process eventually led to two important consequences: first, different modalities were developed to suppress or antagonize estrogen; and second, the ability to detect estrogen receptor in breast cancer tissue became a predictor of response to treatment--probably the best marker for response among all solid tumors. Tamoxifen, which works by competitively antagonizing hormonal receptors in breast cancer cells, has been for the past three decades the standard of care for adjuvant therapy for any woman with hormone receptor-positive early breast cancer, regardless of nodal status or menopausal setting. But as we strive to improve the utility of antagonizing or suppressing estrogen, new modalities are being developed. In the premenopausal setting, the advent of gonadotropin hormone-releasing hormone (also known as luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone) analogues has allowed for medical and reversible suppression of ovarian function. This method has already been proven as effective as chemotherapy in preventing recurrence, and ongoing trials are aiming to better define its role in the adjuvant setting. In the postmenopausal setting, aromatase inhibitors (AIs) have revolutionized the adjuvant treatment of hormone-responsive cancers of all stages. The current standard of care has come to include AIs, as an alternative, in sequence, of after 5 years of tamoxifen. Ongoing research continues to develop agents to overcome hormonal therapy resistance."

CD008018,0,24651411,0,'An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure': the case for and against GnRH-agonist for fertility preservation.,"The late effects of cancer treatment have recently gained a worldwide interest among reproductive endocrinologists, oncologists, and all health-care providers, and the protection against iatrogenic infertility caused by chemotherapy assumes a high priority. Here, we summarize the case for and against using GnRH-agonist for fertility preservation and minimizing chemotherapy-induced gonadotoxicity. The rationale and philosophy supporting its use is that preventing premature ovarian failure (POF) is preferable to treating it, following the dictum: 'an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure'. Despite many publications on this subject, there are many equivocal issues necessitating summary. Until now, 20 studies (15 retrospective and 5 randomized, controlled trials) have reported on 1837 patients treated with GnRH-a in parallel to chemotherapy, showing a significant decrease in POF rate in survivors versus 9 studies reporting on 593 patients, with results not supporting GnRH-a use. Patients treated with GnRH-a in parallel to chemotherapy preserved their cyclic ovarian function in 91% of cases when compared with 41% of controls, with a pregnancy rate of 19-71% in the treated patients. Furthermore, seven meta-analyses have concluded that GnRH-a are beneficial and may decrease the risk of POF in survivors. However, controversy still remains regarding the efficiency of GnRH-a in preserving fertility. Since not all the methods involving fertility preservation are unequivocally successful and safe, these young patients deserve to be informed of all the various modalities to minimize gonadal damage and preserve ovarian function and future fertility. Combining several methods for a specific patient may increase the odds for minimally invasive fertility preservation."

CD008018,0,25649243,0,Infertility in reproductive-age female cancer survivors.,"Improved survival rates among reproductive-age females diagnosed with cancer have increased the focus on long-term quality of life, including maintenance of the ability to conceive biological children. Cancer-directed therapies such as high-dose alkylating agents and radiation to the pelvis, which deplete ovarian reserve, radiation to the brain, which affects the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, and surgical resection of reproductive structures can decrease the likelihood of having biological children. Standard fertility preservation strategies such as embryo and oocyte cryopreservation before the onset of therapy offer the opportunity to conserve fertility, but they may not be feasible because of the urgency to start cancer therapy, financial limitations, and a lack of access to reproductive endocrinologists. Ovarian tissue freezing is considered experimental, with limited data related to pregnancies, but it minimizes treatment delay. Studies evaluating gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues have had mixed results, although a recent randomized, prospective study in women with breast cancer demonstrated a protective effect. Fertility preservation programs are increasingly being developed within cancer programs. In this article, we describe risks to infertility and options for preservation, raise psychosocial and ethical issues, and propose elements for establishing an effective fertility preservation program."

CD008018,0,20832294,0,Suppression of ovarian function in combination with an aromatase inhibitor as treatment for advanced breast cancer in pre-menopausal women.,"Trials have shown superiority of aromatase inhibitors (AIs) over tamoxifen for post-menopausal oestrogen receptor-positive advanced breast cancer (ER+ABC). We previously reported the use of goserelin plus anastrozole (G+A) as second-line endocrine therapy for pre-menopausal ER+ABC. We report clinical and endocrine data from G+A as first-line systemic therapy. Thirty-six patients (median age=44 years) with metastatic (N=28) and locally advanced disease were administered G+A for ≥6 months (unless progressed prior). Some (N=13) received further therapy with goserelin plus another AI (steroidal), exemestane (G+E). Serial serum hormone assays (oestradiol, dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate, testosterone, follicle stimulating hormone and luteinising hormone) were performed. Twenty-four patients (67%) derived clinical benefit (CB) (5% complete response, 31% partial response, 31% stable disease for ≥6 months) with median time to progression and duration of CB of 12 (2-47) and 24+(7-78+) months respectively. Ten patients were still receiving first-line G+A at analysis. Amongst 13 patients who went onto receive G+E, 38% achieved CB with a mean duration of 13+(7-32) months. Therapy was well tolerated with no withdrawals. The combination of G+A resulted in 98% reduction (from pre-treatment to 6-month) in median levels of oestradiol (from 574.5 pmol/L; inter-quartile range (IQR)=209-1426; (N=6) to 13.45 pmol/L; IOQ=5.5-31.5 (N=4) whilst the levels of other hormones had minimal fluctuations during therapy. The combinations of ovarian function suppression (using G) and AIs produce sustained CB and minimal side effects in pre-menopausal ER+ABC with significant reduction in oestradiol levels. Within the limitations of being a non-randomised study, they should be considered in appropriate patients with hormone-sensitive ABC."

Since GnRH antagonist is associated with a reduction in E(2) levels, we hypothesized that GnRH-antagonist treatment of women down-regulated with GnRH agonist who are at risk of OHSS might reduce E(2) levels and avoid cycle cancellation."
CD008018,0,10874521,0,Complete estrogen blockade for the treatment of metastatic and early stage breast cancer.,"Complete estrogen blockade has long been sought as a more effective means of controlling breast cancer compared with single agent endocrine therapy. This approach may be accomplished through the use of agents which reduce estrogen production combined with agents that prevent the activity of estrogen at the cellular level. For prostate cancer, another hormonally responsive malignancy, this approach has not been successful at improving survival compared with that achieved with single agent therapy. Preclinical information is contradictory for many promising combinations and may not reflect the true nature of in vivo interaction between agents. For premenopausal patients with metastatic breast cancer, the combination of a luteinising hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist and tamoxifen is clearly effective, but whether the combination is more effective than either single agent is still controversial. Similar response rates and overall survival were reported with goserelin or goserelin plus tamoxifen by Jonat et al. in 1 randomised, prospective study, but the addition of tamoxifen improved time to progression. A second trial comparing buserelin plus tamoxifen with either single agent reported superior efficacy in terms of response rates, disease-free survival and overall survival with combination therapy. A meta-analysis of 4 randomised trials making similar comparisons, demonstrated significant improvement in median overall survival, progression-free survival, response rate, and duration of response with the combination of a LHRH agonist (goserelin or buserelin) and tamoxifen in premenopausal breast cancer patients with metastatic disease. For postmenopausal women with metastatic breast cancer, the addition of an aromatase inhibitor to tamoxifen has yet to be prospectively compared to single agent therapy. Use of endocrine combinations in the treatment of early stage breast cancer is under investigation. Preliminary results of some of the ongoing adjuvant therapy trials indicate that the combination of a LHRH agonist and tamoxifen may have similar efficacy to cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil chemotherapy in premenopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive tumour. Addition of LHRH agonist therapy in premenopausal patients with estrogen receptor-positive tumour who had maintained the ovarian function following chemotherapy [cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin (adriamycin), fluorouracil, and tamoxifen], also led to a reduction in the risk of recurrence. These studies have identified a sub-population of patients who may benefit from the addition of combination endocrine therapy. Overall, the issue is quite complex and the data from many ongoing trials are still awaited with anticipation to further delineate the role of complete estrogen deprivation in this disease."

CD008018,0,17454195,1,Ovarian function after cancer treatment in young women affected by Hodgkin disease (HD).,"We have evaluated the best method to assess the ovarian reserve and the ovarian protective effect of GnRH-analog (GnRH-a), in 29 women with Hodgkin's disease (HD) treated with chemotherapy (CHT). The ovarian reserve was studied by measuring the serum levels of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), inhibin B, antimullerian hormone (AMH) and the ultrasound antral follicular count (AFC). The patients were randomly treated with or without GnRH-a. At the time of study menstrual function was normal in 21 cases (72.4%), but absent in 8 (27.5%). Mean basal values of FSH, LH, AMH, inhibin B and AFC were normal in patients less than 30 years old and in the group treated four years or less before observation. AFC appeared to be the best marker of reduced ovarian reserve and a combination of AFC-AMH or inhibin B appeared the best predictor. In the GnRH-a group, no women had amenorrhoea, although ovarian reserve assessment was not significantly different from those who were not treated. The time-interval from CHT was the only significant predictor of ovarian function in GnRH-a treated patients. In conclusion, ovarian reserve evaluation, in young patients treated by CHT, can be performed by AFC. GnRH-a treatment does not have a protective effect, but could delay the development of ovarian failure."
CD008018,0,21048441,0,Use of hormonal protection for chemotherapy-induced gonadotoxicity.,"It is still controversial that GnRH agonist (GnRHa) protects ovarian function from chemotherapy-induced gonadotoxicity. Indeed, the results of many studies related to this issue are neither consistent nor convincing because of the weak study design and the inadequate sample size. We identified 11 prospective controlled studies (8 nonrandomized and 3 randomized) for the systemic review and meta-analysis. The meta-analysis showed that GnRHa cotreatment during chemotherapy can protect ovarian function. However, it is worthy to note that the result of this meta-analysis is influenced by nonrandomized studies. The protective effect of GnRHa will remain elusive until the currently ongoing large, prospective, randomized studies are completed. In addition, tamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor modulator, may have the protective effect against loss of follicles and ovarian function, which was caused by chemotherapy."

CD008018,0,6403570,0,Steroid secretion in polycystic ovarian disease after ovarian suppression by a long-acting gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist.,"The principal glandular source of increased serum androgens in polycystic ovarian disease (PCO) is controversial), since complete separation of ovarian from adrenal function has not been achieved. The purpose of this study was to determine whether a long-acting GnRH agonist could be used to selectively inhibit ovarian steroid secretion in PCO and ovulatory women. Each of five typical PCO patients and six ovulatory subjects on day 2 of their menstrual cycles received D-Trp6-Pro9-NEt-LHRH (GnRH-a; 100 micrograms) for 28 consecutive days. Their results were compared to basal serum hormone values in eight oophorectomized women. In response to GnRH-a, PCO and normal subjects exhibited sharp and sustained rises of LH and gradual decreases in FSH. These levels were clearly less than basal levels seen in oophorectomized women. Episodic LH release was significantly attenuated in both groups at the end of GnRH-a treatment. After the administration of agonist, serum estradiol (E2), estrone (E1), androstenedione (A), and testosterone (T) were suppressed to castrate levels in both groups. The decrements of E2 and E1 in PCO were gradual and continuous compared to initial dramatic rises, which reached peaks at 14 days, and subsequent abrupt falls in the ovulatory controls. Serum A and T declined steadily in both groups. Basal serum dehydroepiandrosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, but not cortisol, levels were elevated in PCO subjects. The 24-h secretion patterns and responses to ACTH of these hormones in PCO and ovulatory subjects were unaltered by GnRH-a administration. These data demonstrate that 1) in PCO subjects, GnRH-a induced complete suppression of ovarian steroid secretion, as circulating levels at the end of treatment were comparable to those seen in our oophorectomy subjects; 2) elevated A and T levels in PCO patients were derived primarily from the ovary; and 3) adrenal steroid secretion was unaltered by GnRH-a in both PCO and normal women."
CD008018,0,17636604,0,WITHDRAWN: Clomiphene or tamoxifen for idiopathic oligo/asthenospermia.,"Oligo-astheno-teratospermia (sperm of low concentration, reduced motility and increased abnormal morphology) of unknown cause is common and the need for treatment is felt by patients and doctors alike. As a result, a variety of empirical, non-specific treatments have been used in an attempt to improve semen characteristics and fertility.The administration of anti-oestrogens is a common treatment because anti oestrogens interfere with the normal negative feedback of sex steroids at hypothalamic and pituitary levels in order to increase endogenous gonadotropin-releasing hormone secretion from the hypothalamus and FSH and LH secretion directly from the pituitary. In turn, FSH and LH stimulate Leydig cells in the testes, and this has been claimed to lead to increased local testosterone production, thereby boosting spermatogenesis with a possible improvement in fertility. There may also be a direct effect of anti-oestrogens on testicular spermatogenesis or steroidogenesis. This review considers the available evidence of the effect of both Clomiphene citrate and tamoxifen, both of which have a predominant anti-oestrogenic effect, for idiopathic oligo and/or asthenospermia."
CD008018,0,21770827,0,A functioning FSH-secreting pituitary macroadenoma causing an ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome with multiple cysts resected and relapsed after leuprolide in a reproductive-aged woman.,"Bioactive gonadotropin-secreting pituitary adenomas are very rare in fertile women and can cause an ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). A 31-year-old woman with oligo-amenorrhea, severe ovarian cystic swelling and high serum estradiol was submitted to the resection of ovarian cysts and then treated with long-acting leuprolide 11.25 mg. Two months later, the ovarian multicystic hyperplasia relapsed, thus a pituitary MRI was performed and a pituitary macroadenoma was detected. In January 2010, she was referred to our Endocrinology Department where her hormonal evaluation showed high serum estradiol, FSH, α-subunit and inhibin with low LH. In April 2010, she underwent a trans-sphenoidal pituitary adenomectomy, which rapidly regularized the hormonal profile, the ovary and pituitary morphology and the menses. The case presented confirms that gonadotrophinomas occurring in reproductive-aged women frequently produce symptoms of ovarian hyperstimulation and proves that the use of GnRH analogs is not indicated in this condition."

Cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and 5-fluorouracil (CAF) plus buserelin was given to 81 women with metastatic disease, and 66 women were randomised to adjuvant cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil (CMF) with buserelin or CMF alone. Baseline mean E2 of patients treated with cytostatics plus buserelin fell from premenopausal levels and remained low while patients were on study. E2 levels remained at premenopausal values in patients treated with CMF alone. Downregulation of FSH and LH occurred with cytostatics plus depot buserelin, but fluctuated with the nasal administration; on CMF alone, FSH and LH levels increased. Buserelin plus cytostatics more effectively caused ovarian ablation than cytostatic treatment alone. Depot buserelin was more effective than nasal buserelin."
CD008018,0,23452939,0,Combination of a GnRH agonist with an antagonist prevents flare-up effects and protects primordial ovarian follicles in the rat ovary from cisplatin-induced toxicity: a controlled experimental animal study.,"With the continuous improvement of surgery and chemotherapeutic treatments, many tumour patients increasingly achieve long-term survival and can even be completely cured. However, platinum-containing drugs, which are widely used to treat a variety of types of cancer, cause menstrual disorders and ovarian failure, which in turn lead to infertility. Thus far, gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist (GnRHa) and antagonist (GnRHant) are reported to act as protective agents of the ovary in chemotherapy through the inhibition of the female gonadal axis. Nevertheless, they both have disadvantages that limit their use. GnRHa causes a flare-up effect during the first week after administration, and no long-acting GnRHant agent is available. GnRHa combined with GnRHant may prevent the flare-up effect of GnRHa and rapidly inhibit the female gonadal axis. Several clinical studies with small sample sizes have reported controversial conclusions. In this strictly controlled animal study, we investigated the advantages of combination treatment with GnRHa and GnRHant."
CD008018,0,26411202,0,Molecular aspects and clinical methods for preserving ovarian reserves in women receiving cancer treatment.,"Cancer prevalence is high, and of importance to cancer sufferers is the long term survival and normal activities resumption. Moreover, pregnancy is drawing interest for preserving ovarian reserves in post-chemotherapy affected women, especially of younger ages. The gonadotoxic effect of cancer treatment, involves mechanisms that are not fully understood, mainly due to the variety of molecular pathways triggered once therapeutic agents applied. Reported rates of premature ovarian failure after the treatment effect and the application of various treatment protocols, differ extensively due to the protocol itself but also due to the age of treated patients. Several options for preserving ovarian reserves are currently employed in the clinique, such as ovarian transposition, embryos cryopreservation and the use of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and its agonists/antagonists, but most of them are still under investigation. This paper reviews these methods and the molecular mechanisms that are possibly involved in the action of agents such as GnRH."

At present, there is great debate about the influence of exogenous hormone activity on the hypothalamus-pituitary axis following pituitary desensitization. The objective of this comparative study was to investigate the pattern of luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and oestradiol in women undergoing ovarian stimulation with different GnRH-a preparations. We retrospectively analysed 201 women, aged between 27 and 43 years, who were referred consecutively to our infertility clinic between January 2002 and January 2003. All women had no endocrinopathies or occult ovarian failure as assessed by day-3 hormone profile. Women were enrolled in one of the following COS protocols: depot triptorelin long protocol (n = 38), buserelin long protocol (n = 101) or buserelin short protocol (n = 62). Recombinant FSH was used to induce ovulation. Treatment was monitored by transvaginal ultrasound scan and serum measurement of FSH, LH and oestradiol. Among the women initially included, 30 had cancelled cycles due to poor ovarian response. Serum LH levels were significantly higher in the short-protocol group compared with the long-protocol groups (p < 0.001). The number of follicles, oocyte yield, number of grade-I embryos and fertilization rate were significantly lower in the short-protocol group than in the long-protocol groups. These findings showed that LH concentrations are significantly higher in women undergoing reversible medical hypophysectomy with a GnRH-a short protocol than in women treated with a long protocol. The hypothesis of an LH ceiling is confirmed."

The two studies reported (Study I and II) are part of the activity of the Italian Study Group for Physiopathology of Puberty. Study L Growth data were analyzed of three groups of patients: treated with i.n. spray buserelin, i.m. triptorelin and untreated. Both GnRHa administration modes were effective in arresting pubertal development and all girls had complete recovery of the reproductive axis after therapy. Treated patients showed an improvement in final height in comparison with untreated patients and compared to predicted height at the start of treatment with both agonist treatments. However, patients treated with the long-acting slow release preparation had a better improvement in adult height and reached or exceeded the genetic height potential. Study II. In a retrospective evaluation of the outcome in 71 girls with idiopathic CPP treated with triptorelin, we found that FH fell within the population norm and the target range in 87.3% and 90% of the patients respectively. The tallest FH was recorded in the patients who started therapy at less than 6 years of age and in those who discontinued treatment at a bone age of 12.0-12.5 yr. Finally, we and other groups have recently found normal values of bone mineral density in girls at the end of GnRHa treatment in the great majority of patients."

CD008018,0,15485101,0,Ovarian failure in systemic lupus erythematosus patients treated with pulsed intravenous cyclophosphamide.,"Pulsed intravenous cyclophosphamide is considered as standard therapy for lupus nephritis and several other severe manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). While the response rate to intravenous cyclophosphamide is substantial, concern has arisen about its toxicity. In addition to increased susceptibility to infection, bone marrow suppression, alopecia, hemorrhagic cystitis and malignancy, ovarian failure is an important side effect associated with the use of cyclophosphamide. Prior research on cyclophosphamide-treated women has consistently demonstrated that the risk of sustained amenorrhea depends on the age of the patient and the cumulative dose received. Sustained amenorrhea is difficult to avoid in women 32 years or older, even with very short intravenous cyclophosphamide courses. Younger women seem to have a substantially lower incidence of ovarian failure, but this side effect may be far more problematic for these patients. In these young women the risk may be modulated by the prior SLE disease duration, the presence of anti-U1RNP antibodies and anti-Ro antibodies. Co-treatment with gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists may preseserve the future fertility and ovarian function in young women. Ovarian banking before administration of cyclophosphamide should be considered in selected patients."

CD008018,0,8045961,0,Estrogen replacement does not potentiate gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist-induced androgen suppression in treatment of hirsutism.,"The therapies presently available for treating ovarian hirsutism are not uniformly effective, and therefore, much has been expected from GnRH agonists. These inhibit the secretion of gonadotropins and thereby suppress ovarian function, but at the same time cause hypoestrogenic side-effects. We, therefore, administered goserelin, a long-acting GnRH agonist, for treatment of 20 hirsute women (18 with polycystic ovaries) for 9 months; half of them were randomized to receive cyclic estradiol and medroxyprogesterone replacement from the fourth month onward. Seventeen patients completed the study. Goserelin suppressed ovarian function, as evidenced by a profound reduction in serum estradiol levels. The circulating levels of total testosterone, free testosterone, and androstenedione were lowered at 3 months by 29%, 31%, and 38%, respectively, but there was no effect on the levels of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) or dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate. Ovarian suppression, maintained for the duration of the trial, alleviated hirsutism, as evidenced by a decrease in Ferriman-Gallwey hirsutism scores. Estrogen plus progestin replacement restored estradiol levels and increased SHBG levels, but did not potentiate the therapeutic effect of goserelin or reduce free testosterone levels. Replacement therapy abolished or alleviated hypoestrogenic vasomotor symptoms, but it also caused bleeding and premenstrual symptoms, which necessitated the withdrawal of 3 of 10 women from the treatment. Thus, goserelin is an effective treatment for ovarian hyperandrogenism. Simultaneous estrogen replacement abolishes the hypoestrogenic side-effects, but does not potentiate the effect of goserelin on hirsutism. Interestingly, the estrogen-induced increase in SHBG did not affect free testosterone. Thus, the suppression of gonadotropins, rather than the increase in SHBG, appears to be of primary significance in the alleviation of ovarian hyperandrogenism by estrogens."
CD008018,0,18959739,0,Gonadotropin-releasing hormone and ovarian cancer: a functional and mechanistic overview.,"The hypothalamic decapeptide gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is well known for its role in the control of pituitary gonadotropin secretion, but the hormone and receptor are also expressed in extrapituitary tissues and tumor cells, including epithelial ovarian cancers. It is hypothesized that they may function as a local autocrine regulatory system in nonpituitary contexts. Numerous studies have demonstrated a direct antiproliferative effect on ovarian cancer cell lines of GnRH and its synthetic analogs. This effect appears to be attributable to multiple steps in the GnRH signaling cascade, such as cell cycle arrest at G(0)/G(1). In contrast to GnRH signaling in pituitary gonadotropes, the involvement of G(alpha q), protein kinase C and mitogen-activated protein kinases is less apparent in neoplastic cells. Instead, in ovarian cancer cells, GnRH receptors appear to couple to the pertussis toxin-sensitive protein G(alpha i), leading to the activation of protein phosphatase, which in turn interferes with growth factor-induced mitogenic signals. Apoptotic involvement is still controversial, although GnRH analogs have been shown to protect cancer cells from doxorubicin-induced apoptosis. Recently, data supporting a regulatory role of GnRH analogs in ovarian cancer cell migration/invasion have started to emerge. In this minireview, we summarize the current understanding of the antiproliferative actions of GnRH analogs, as well as the recent observations of GnRH effects on ovarian cancer cell apoptosis and motogenesis. The molecular mechanisms that mediate GnRH actions and the clinical applications of GnRH analogs in ovarian cancer patients are also discussed."

CD008018,0,11251372,0,Serum inhibin A and inhibin B in central precocious puberty before and during treatment with GnRH agonists.,"Serum levels of the gonadal hormones inhibin A and inhibin B are undetectable or low in prepubertal girls, and rise during puberty. In girls with central precocious puberty (CPP) the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis is prematurely activated, if the girl is thereafter treated with GnRH agonists both gonadotropins and estradiol levels become suppressed. We therefore investigated serum levels of inhibin A and inhibin B in girls with CPP at diagnosis and during treatment in order to test the hypothesis that inhibin secretion would increase and decrease in parallel with the activation and suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. Serum levels of inhibin A and inhibin B were significantly (p < 0.0005) elevated in 42 girls at diagnosis of CPP (inhibin A: 7 pg/ml (<7--139), inhibin B: 80 pg/ml (<20--294) (median, range)) compared to levels in age-matched healthy schoolgirls (inhibin A: all values <7 pg/ml, inhibin B: 21 pg/ml (<20--122) (median, range)), but were appropriate for Tanner stage. During treatment with GnRH agonist (intranasal buserelin and oral cyproterone acetate, treatment group 1, n = 23, or triptorelin depot injections, treatment group 2, n = 19) levels of both hormones fell significantly (p = 0.002). There was a significantly (p = 0.003) greater fall in inhibin B levels during treatment in group 2 compared to group 1, with inhibin B levels now lying below (group 2: <20 pg/ml (<20--68)) rather than within (group 1: 34.5 pg/ml (<20--93)) the age-appropriate range. It is concluded that levels of inhibin A and inhibin B are elevated and suppressed in concert with activation and suppression of the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal axis in girls with CPP, supporting the concept that ovarian inhibin secretion is dynamically regulated by gonadotropin stimulation."

CD008018,0,10402369,0,Adjuvant L-arginine treatment for in-vitro fertilization in poor responder patients.,"The objective of the present study was prospectively and randomly to evaluate the role of L-arginine in improving uterine and follicular Doppler flow and in improving ovarian response to gonadotrophin in poor responder women. A total of 34 patients undergoing assisted reproduction was divided in two groups according to different ovarian stimulation protocols: (i) flare-up gonadotrophin-releasing hormone analogue (GnRHa) plus elevated pure follicle stimulating hormone (pFSH) (n = 17); and (ii) flare-up GnRHa plus elevated pFSH plus oral L-arginine (n = 17). During the ovarian stimulation regimen, the patients were submitted to hormonal (oestradiol and growth hormone), ultrasonographic (follicular number and diameter, endometrial thickness) and Doppler (uterine and perifollicular arteries) evaluations. Furthermore, the plasma and follicular fluid concentrations of arginine, citrulline, nitrite/nitrate (NO2-/NO3-), and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) were assayed. All 34 patients completed the study. In the L-arginine treated group a lower cancellation rate, an increased number of oocytes collected, and embryos transferred were observed. In the same group, increased plasma and follicular fluid concentrations of arginine, citrulline, NO2-/NO3-, and IGF-1 was observed. Significant Doppler flow improvement was obtained in the L-arginine supplemented group. Three pregnancies were registered in these patients. No pregnancies were observed in the other group. It was concluded that oral L-arginine supplementation in poor responder patients may improve ovarian response, endometrial receptivity and pregnancy rate."

A retrospective cohort analysis was performed on 1003 cycles undergoing frozen-thawed, cleavage-stage embryo transfers from January 1, 2012 to June 31, 2015 in the Reproductive Medicine Center of Wuhan General Hospital of Guangzhou Military Region. Based on the infertility etiologies of the patients, the 1003 cycles were divided into five groups: tubal infertility, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), endometriosis, male infertility, and unexplained infertility. The main outcome was the live birth rate. Two groups were set up based on the intervention: group A was given a GnRH agonist with exogenous estrogen and progesterone, and group B (control group) was given exogenous estrogen and progesterone only. The results showed that the baseline serum hormone levels and basic characteristics of the patients were not significantly different between groups A and B. The live birth rates in groups A and B were 41.67% and 29.29%, respectively (P<0.05). The live birth rates in patients with PCOS in groups A and B were 56.25% and 30.61%,respectively (P<0.05). The clinical pregnancy, implantation and on-going pregnancy rates showed the same trends as the live birth rates between groups A and B. The ectopic pregnancy rate was significantly lower in group A than in group B. We concluded that the live birth rate was higher and other clinical outcomes were more satisfactory with GnRH agonist cotreatment than without GnRH agonist co-treatment for frozen-thawed embryo transfer. The GnRH agonist combined with exogenous estrogen and progesterone worked for all types of infertility tested, especially for women with PCOS."

CD008018,0,16006734,0,A case of ovulatory cycle-dependent symptoms in woman with previous interferon beta therapy.,"A woman with a menstrual cycle-dependent fever (more than 38 degrees C) and severe fatigue that disrupted her ability to work was referred to our hospital. Six years ago, the patient received interferon beta injections (6,000,000 IU day-1x48 days) for the treatment of hepatitis C virus. Although the treatment was successful against the virus, the symptomatic fever occurred monthly since the third year after receiving the treatment. The symptoms occurred a few days after ovulation in every menstrual cycle. When the ovarian function was suppressed by GnRH agonist (GnRHa), the symptoms disappeared. While in anovulation, the patient received estrogen followed by estrogen with progestogen, which resembles the sex hormone milieu of a normal menstrual cycle without the LH surge; this treatment did not induce the symptoms. When human CG (hCG) was injected on the beginning day of estrogen with progestogen following treatment with estrogen alone, the previous symptoms reappeared. However, the hCG injection without estrogen priming did not induce the symptoms. These studies indicated that the LH surge after estrogen priming induced the symptoms. Changes in serum inflammatory cytokine levels (interleukin-1, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha) were examined during the ovulatory cycle and the interleukin-1 levels during the treatment. There were no significant changes on these levels in the febrile period. The patient experienced normal menstrual cycles after finishing the five-month GnRHa treatment. Although her symptoms still occur, they are mild and do not require further medical treatment."
CD008018,0,24321862,0,[Role of GnRH agonists in preserving female fertility].,The impact of cancer treatment on ovarian function and fertility has been known since the 70s. Preservation of fertility is now an important focus of care for patients of reproductive age with cancer. The beneficial role of GnRH agonists in fertility preservation is controversial since the early 2000s. Recent randomized studies come to overturn this role. The POEMS multicenter randomized trial with long-term follow-up is ongoing and will provide results that could help clarify the current uncertain indication of these compounds in this context.
CD008018,0,8144850,0,Estrogenic suppression by different administration schedules of goserelin depot for treatment of endometriosis.,"Eighteen patients affected by laparoscopically confirmed endometriosis were randomly assigned to three different schedules of treatment with gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRH-a) (goserelin depot formulation 3.6 mg) every 28 days for 6 months. Six women received the first implant in early follicular phase, 4 in late luteal phase and 8 in 3rd and 17th day from onset of menses. Pretreatment and posttreatment laparoscopic score, performed according to the American Fertility Society scoring system, were compared; a significant reduction in the extent of disease was observed in each group investigated (A and C: p < 0.01; B: p < 0.05). In each treatment group after the second GnRH-a implant the mean levels of estrone-3-glucuronide (E1-3G), daily measured in early morning urine specimens during the control cycle and the first three months of therapy, were suppressed to menopausal women range. In group B during the 2nd and 3rd month of therapy, the urinary mean levels of E1-3G were significantly lower than in group A and C. In conclusion the different goserelin depot administration schedules gave similar laparoscopic improvement, in spite of the first GnRH-a administration in luteal phase allowed a more marked estrogenic suppression."

CD008018,0,2262393,0,Preliminary results suggesting exaggerated ovarian androgen production early in the course of polycystic ovary syndrome.,"Excess ovarian androgen production might be a cause of the polycystic ovary syndrome (PCO). Previous studies have evaluated adult women with long-standing abnormality of the hypothalamic-pituitary gonadal axis. Abnormal ovarian function in such patients could be a primary or even a secondary finding. For that reason, this study was designed to evaluate ovarian androgen production in symptomatic adolescent females. Simultaneous adrenal suppression, by using dexamethasone, and ovarian stimulation, by using gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), were achieved in 12 patients. Following stimulation, blood was serially obtained over 8 hr to measure gonadotropin, estrogen, and androgen responses. Based on the androgen response, patients could be divided into two groups. Group A (five) had a significant increase (p less than 0.01) in free testosterone, whereas group B (seven) had no increase in any androgen, including free testosterone (significantly different from group A, p = 0.01). All patients in group A had enlarged or cystic ovaries, whereas only one-quarter patients in group B had enlarged ovaries (significantly different from group A, p less than 0.03). The pituitary and estrogenic response was similar in both groups. These preliminary data suggest that some patients with PCO (group A) have a primary abnormality in ovarian androgen production early in the course of their disease."

CD008018,0,24942013,0,Premature ovarian insufficiency and neurological function.,"Premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) involves loss of ovarian function before age 40. POI has been associated with neurological dysfunction and an increased risk of dementia, perhaps due to depletion in estrogen levels. The present review discusses the effects of POI caused by genetic disorder, natural premature menopause, surgical menopause, breast cancer treatment and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist treatment. Overall, data suggest an increased risk of neurological disorder where POI is due to premature menopause or induced from surgery. This increased risk appears to be most apparent on domains of global cognitive and verbal memory tests. Where POI is caused by genetic disorder, observed cognitive deficiencies may be more likely to have a genetic basis rather than being due to the effects of sex steroids on the brain. Findings related to loss of cognitive function after chemotherapy or GnRH treatments are mixed. There are also discrepant data related to use of hormone therapy after POI (particularly after surgical menopause). After surgery, hormone treatment appears to be most beneficial if initiated close to the average natural age of menopause."

Therefore, we investigated the effects of bombesin/gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) antagonists RC-3940-II and RC-3095 on the growth of human ovarian carcinoma cell line OV-1063, xenografted into nude mice. Treatment with RC-3940-II at doses of 10 microg and 20 microg per day s.c. decreased tumour volume by 60.9% (P< 0.05) and 73.5% (P< 0.05) respectively, after 25 days, compared to controls. RC-3095 at a dose of 20 microg per day reduced the volume of OV-1063 tumours by 47.7% (P = 0.15). In comparison, luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH) antagonist Cetrorelix at a dose of 100 microg per day caused a 64.2% inhibition (P< 0.05). RT-PCR analysis showed that OV-1063 tumours expressed mRNA for bombesin receptor subtypes BRS-1, BRS-2, and BRS-3. In OV-1063 cells cultured in vitro, GRP(14-27) induced the expression of mRNA for c- jun and c- fos oncogenes in a time-dependent manner. Antagonist RC-3940-II inhibited the stimulatory effect of GRP(14-27) on c- jun and c- fos in vitro. In vivo, the levels of c- jun and c- fos mRNA in OV-1063 tumours were decreased by 43% (P< 0.05) and 45% (P = 0. 05) respectively, after treatment with RC-3940-II at 20 microg per day. Exposure of OV-1063, UCI-107 and ES-2 ovarian carcinoma cells to RC-3940-II at 1 microM concentration for 24 h in vitro, extended the latency period for the development of palpable tumours in nude mice. Our results indicate that antagonists of bombesin/GRP inhibit the growth of OV-1063 ovarian cancers by mechanisms that probably involve the downregulation of c- jun and c- fos proto-oncogenes."

CD008018,0,10796497,0,Clomiphene or tamoxifen for idiopathic oligo/asthenospermia.,"Oligo-astheno-teratospermia (sperm of low concentration, reduced motility and increased abnormal morphology) of unknown cause is common and the need for treatment is felt by patients and doctors alike. As a result, a variety of empirical, non-specific treatments have been used in an attempt to improve semen characteristics and fertility. The administration of anti-oestrogens is a common treatment because anti oestrogens interfere with the normal negative feedback of sex steroids at hypothalamic and pituitary levels in order to increase endogenous gonadotropin-releasing hormone secretion from the hypothalamus and FSH and LH secretion directly from the pituitary. In turn, FSH and LH stimulate Leydig cells in the testes, and this has been claimed to lead to increased local testosterone production, thereby boosting spermatogenesis with a possible improvement in fertility. There may also be a direct effect of anti-oestrogens on testicular spermatogenesis or steroidogenesis. This review considers the available evidence of the effect of both Clomiphene citrate and tamoxifen, both of which have a predominant anti-oestrogenic effect, for idiopathic oligo and/or asthenospermia."

CD008018,0,11397837,0,Gonadal status in male survivors following childhood brain tumors.,"The effect of radiotherapy (RT) and chemotherapy (CT) on gonadal function was assessed in males treated for a childhood brain tumor not directly involving the hypothalamus/pituitary (HP) axis in a population-based study with a long follow-up time. All males <15 yr at the time of diagnosis (median: 9.0 yr, range: 0.8 to 14.9 yr) and diagnosed from January 1970 through February 1997 in the eastern part of Denmark and [gte]18 yr at the time of follow-up (median: 25.8 yr, range:18.5 to 39.3 yr) were included. Thirty males fulfilled the criteria. The median age at time of RT was 9.0 yr (range: 0.8 to 14.9 yr) and the median length of follow-up was 18 yr (range: 2.0 to 28.0 yr). The biological effective dose of RT was determined to the HP region and to the spine and expressed in gray because the biological effective dose gives a means of expressing the biological effect on normal tissue of different dosage schedules in a uniform way. Levels of serum FSH, luteinizing hormone (LH), sexual hormone-binding globulin, testosterone, and inhibin B were measured and compared with healthy age-matched male controls (n = 347), and the patients had a GnRH stimulation test performed with determination of peak FSH and LH. Patients treated with RT + CT (n = 13), compared with patients treated with RT only (n = 17), had significantly higher median peak FSH (8.33 vs. 3.79 IU/L, P = 0.03) and median peak LH (20.0 vs. 12.8 IU/L, P = 0.03), and significantly lower median inhibin B (86.0 vs. 270 pg/ml, P = 0.03), and median inhibin B/FSH ratio (12.8 vs. 107.9, P = 0.04), which indicates gonadal damage. Inhibin B and inhibin B/FSH ratio were also significantly lower in the RT + CT group, compared with controls (median: 86.0 vs. 215 pg/ml, P = 0.02), (median:12.8 vs. 67; P = 0.01), respectively. We found a significantly inverse correlation between basal FSH and inhibin B and FSH and total testicular volume (r(s) = -0.83; P < 0.0001), (r(s) = -0.67; P < 0.0001), respectively, and a significant correlation between inhibin B and total testicular volume (r(s) = 0.63; P < 0.0001). Stepwise backward multiple linear regression analysis showed the best-fit model to predict inhibin B levels included total testicular volume (P = 0.002) and CT (P = 0.09). Median basal LH in the RT-only group was significantly lower, compared with controls (3.44 vs. 2.45 IU/L; P = 0.0001) indicating secondary hypogonadism, and in both the RT + CT group and the RT-only group, levels of testosterone were significantly lower, compared with our reference population (12.8 vs. 21.9 nmol/L; P = 0.001, and 14.7 vs. 21.9 nmol/L; P = 0.0003), respectively. In conclusion these data suggest that cranial irradiation for a childhood brain tumor may affect the HP axis, and adjuvant CT can reduce inhibin B indicating primary gonadal damage. Thus, such patients may have normal or even low levels of FSH despite damage to the seminiferous epithelium, and because the fertility status by a semen analysis for psychological reasons can be difficult to obtain in this group of patients, we suggest inhibin B as the most useful direct serum marker of spermatogenesis in the follow-up of individuals who have received both cranial irradiation and gonadotoxic chemotherapy. However, because the number of patients with RT + CT and RT only are small, these data must be confirmed in further studies."

On Day 5 (Day 1 = ovulation) following a synchronized estrus, 24 cows were assigned randomly (n = 4 per group) to receive 2 mL saline, i.m. (control), 8 micrograms, i.m. Buserelin or a subcutaneous Deslorelin (DES) implant in concentrations of 75 micrograms, 150 micrograms, 700 micrograms or 2100 micrograms. Blood samples were collected (for LH assay) at 30-min intervals for 2 h before and 12 h after GnRH-treatment from cows assigned to Buserelin, DES-700 micrograms and DES-2100 micrograms treatments and thereafter at 4-h intervals for 48 h. Beginning 24 h after treatment, ovaries were examined by ultrasound at 2-h intervals until ovulation was confirmed. Thereafter, ultrasonography and blood sampling (for P4 assay) was performed daily until a spontaneous ovulation before Day 45. A greater release of LH occurred in response to Deslorelin implants than to Buserelin injection (P < 0.01). Basal levels of LH between 12 and 48 h were higher in DES-700 micrograms group than in DES-2100 micrograms and Buserelin (P < 0.05). The first wave dominant follicle ovulated in all cows following GnRH treatment. Days to CL regression did not differ between treatments, but return to estrus was delayed (44.2 vs 27.2 d; P < 0.01) in cows of DES-2100 micrograms group. All GnRH treatments elevated plasma P4 concentrations, and the highest P4 responses were observed in the DES-700 micrograms and DES-2100 micrograms groups. The second follicular wave emerged earlier in GnRH-treated than in control cows (9.9 vs 12.8 d; P < 0.01). However, emergence of the third dominant follicle was delayed in cows of DES-2100 micrograms treatment (37.0 d) compared with DES-700 micrograms (22.2 d), Buserelin (17.8 d) or control (19.0 d). In conclusion, Deslorelin implants of 700 micrograms increased plasma P4 and LH concentrations and slightly delayed the emergence of the third dominant follicle. On the contrary, Deslorelin implants of 2100 micrograms drastically altered the P4 profiles and follicle dynamics."

Results from five comparative studies.","The clinical assessment of recombinant follicle stimulating hormone (rFSH; Puregon) in assisted reproduction technologies such as in-vitro fertilization (IVF) has probably been the most extensive clinical trial programme ever performed for the evaluation of a new fertility drug. It started with a pilot study to evaluate the potential of rFSH to stimulate the ovaries in the absence of luteinizing hormone (LH) using various gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists. After it became clear that FSH-induced steroidogenesis was not jeopardized even after severe pituitary suppression, comparisons between rFSH and urinary FSH or human menopausal gonadotrophins were made using different GnRH agonists or no agonists at all. In addition, the effects of the route of administration (s.c. or i.m.) were assessed. The study with the strongest statistical power to truly assess clinically relevant differences between rFSH and urinary FSH included approximately 1000 patient cycles. It indicated that after rFSH treatment, significantly more oocytes were retrieved, more embryos obtained and, as a result, more pregnancies achieved when the results of the cryoprogramme were included."
CD008018,0,9647536,0,The use of long- and short-acting forms of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone analogues in women undergoing oocyte donation.,"Evidence accumulated in in-vitro fertilization (IVF) cycles suggests that the use of long-acting forms of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone analogues (GnRHa) for pituitary desensitization may impair the outcome of IVF as compared to classical short-acting formulations. Whether the negative effects are directed against the corpus luteum, the endometrium, or both is unknown. However, the presence of high affinity binding sites for gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) in the human endometrium suggests a possible role of these analogues on this target organ, affecting embryo implantation. In the present study, we tested direct effects of two different forms of GnRHa on implantation using the ovum donation model. Patients were prospectively allocated to one of the three study groups: the short-acting form of the analogue leuprolide acetate (group I; n=64), the long-acting form of the same analogue (group II; n=58), and the long-acting preparation of the analogue tryptorelin (group III; n=61). A total of 68 cycles of embryo transfer was carried out in group I, whereas 67 were performed in group II and 65 in group III. Cancellation rates were respectively 18.1, 17.3 and 18.8% because of bleeding while being on the waiting list for anonymous oocyte donation. The number of oocytes donated, fertilization rates and embryos replaced in each group were similar. As a result, pregnancy rate per transfer was 38.2, 49.3 and 44.6% respectively. Implantation rates per embryo replaced were respectively 13.4, 19.1 and 17.0%. These data suggest that the use of a long-acting form of GnRHa provides success rates similar to the short-acting preparations, resulting in more convenient medication for patients with ovarian function included in ovum donation programmes."

After an adriamycin-based regimen, patients received radiation therapy concomitant with cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil. An aromatase inhibitor was given to patients positive for the estrogen receptor (ER+). The median age was 43 years (range, 26-45). Among 200 consecutive patients, 46% had no axillary node, and 54% had a mean of 5.4 positive nodes (range, 1-25); 56% were ER+, 44% were estrogen receptor negative (ER-), 13% were triple negative, and 20 had tumors positive for the oncogene, c-erb-B2 (identified with fluorescent in situ hybridization). After a median follow-up of 105 months (range, 65-180), no patient under 40 years old exhibited POF, while 44% of patients over 40 years old exhibited POF. Eight pregnancies were recorded: 7 at term and 1 voluntary interruption. The 10-year disease-free survival and overall survival rates were 85 and 91%, respectively. These data showed that, in premenopausal patients with early breast cancer, the addition of an LH-RH analogue to adjuvant chemotherapy was well tolerated, prevented POF, and was associated with excellent disease-free survival and overall survival rates."

CD008018,0,9804219,0,Transfer of frozen-thawed embryos in artificially prepared cycles with and without prior gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonist suppression: a prospective randomized study.,"Transfer of frozen-thawed embryos is usually carried out in a natural cycle or in a programmed cycle in which the endometrium is exogenously stimulated following down-regulation of the hypophysis. To analyse the possibility that the programmed cycle for embryo transfer can still be hormonally manipulated without the use of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) we have conducted a prospective randomized study that compared the outcome of frozen-thawed embryo transfer cycles using micronized 17beta-oestradiol and micronized progesterone preparations with and without the concomitant use of GnRHa. One hundred and six patients were randomly divided into two groups. In group A (53 patients) 4 mg/day of micronized 17beta-oestradiol was initiated following down-regulation of hypophysis. In group B (53 patients) oestrogen stimulation started on day 1 of the cycle without prior pituitary down-regulation using a dose of 6 mg/day for 7 days. In both groups, micronized progesterone in a dose of 900 mg/day was administered vaginally after at least 12 days of oestrogen stimulation. Embryo transfer embryo transfer took place 48-72 h thereafter according to the cryopreserved embryonic stage. Overall, none of the patients had any follicular development and only one cycle in group B had to be cancelled because of premature progesterone secretion. The two groups did not differ in age (31+/-5.6 and 31+/-5.0 years), number of embryos transferred per patient (3.4+/-1.2 and 3.3+/-1.0), and day of progesterone initiation (15+/-2.2 and 15+/-1.9 for groups A and B respectively). The endometrial thickness on the day of progesterone initiation was comparable in both groups (11 +/-1.6 and 10+/-1.6 mm for groups A and B respectively). Similarly, the pregnancy rate per embryo transfer and implantation rate in group A (26.4% and 9.5%) were comparable to those of group B (21.1% and 9%). These results indicate that programmed cycles can be successfully applied by administering a high dose of micronized 17beta-oestradiol starting on day 1 of the cycle. Compared to GnRHa programmed cycles, this approach is simpler, more convenient for both the patient and medical staff, and results in a similar success rate at a lower cost."

Tamoxifen has been the standard adjuvant endocrine therapy for both pre- and post-menopausal women with hormone receptor-positive early breast cancer and remains the standard of care for premenopausal women. In addition to tamoxifen, ovarian ablation by surgery or radiotherapy remains an option for selected premenopausal women and trials are evaluating the role of ovarian function suppression using luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonists. For postmenopausal women, aromatase inhibitors are more effective than tamoxifen therapy and aromatase inhibitors and tamoxifen are regarded as standards of care.

CD008018,0,17010060,0,An update on ovarian suppression/ablation.,"Adjuvant ovarian function suppression is acknowledged today as effective therapy for premenopausal patients with early breast cancer. Various modalities have been applied to achieve this treatment option: First, early investigations comparing ovarian ablation with chemotherapy identified similar outcomes in terms of patients' rates of disease-free survival (DFS). Second, prospective randomized trials have more recently focused on luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogues (LHRHa) that induce medical ovarian suppression and avoid the morbidity and irreversibility associated with surgical ovariectomy or irradiation. These trials analyzed the value of treatment with goserelin or other LHRHa, with or without tamoxifen, as against chemotherapy. Goserelin was subsequently established as a valid alternative, and our own results demonstrated that goserelin + tamoxifen is more effective and better tolerated in hormone-responsive patients. Third, other multiple-arm studies have compared LHRHa + chemotherapy with chemotherapy alone. Addition of tamoxifen to goserelin + chemotherapy was shown to improve DFS, and significant benefits in goserelin-treated patients were seen irrespective of use of chemotherapy or tamoxifen. Finally, ongoing trials are addressing the appropriate duration of LHRHa therapy and other unresolved issues. In summary, combined ovarian suppression with adjuvant goserelin and tamoxifen is considered to be at least as effective as chemotherapy in premenopausal breast cancer patients. Published reports have demonstrated that ovarian suppression is a safe means of reducing risk of recurrence in estrogen receptor-positive women and underlined its use as a competitive alternative to chemotherapy in this patient subset."

The present paper will review literature data on the attempts of preventing chemotherapy-induced ovarian damage in these women and on their fertility outcome. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone [Gn-RH] agonists have been widely investigated as agents able to prevent ovarian failure in animal models and in humans. The majority of the studies on women with breast cancer and HL have shown a protective effect of Gn-RH agonists. A recent meta-analysis of five randomized trials, including 528 premenopausal breast cancer patients, revealed that relative risk [RR] of developing premature ovarian failure within one year was 0.40 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.21-0.75) for the women who received Gn-RH agonists with chemotherapy compared to those who received chemotherapy alone. However, the concurrent administration of Gn-RH agonists during chemotherapy appeared to have no effect on spontaneous pregnancy rates. Limited information are available about pregnancies in breast cancer and HL survivors, but the current literature appears to show no apparent increase in pregnancy complications, spontaneous abortions, or congenital abnormalities compared to general obstetric population."
CD008018,0,26917466,0,[Impact of gonadotropins in women suffering from cancer].,"The role of gonadotropins in the genesis of malignant diseases, in particular gynecologic cancers, is still controversial.

Over the past decades, the use of exogenous gonadotropins has markedly increased in cancer patients, candidates for fertility preservation, and in survivors facing infertility as a consequence of gonadotoxic treatments. In gynecologic cancers, high serum estradiol levels may be problematic and can therefore be overcome by specific protocols of ovarian stimulation. However, exogenous gonadotropin administration in cancer patients should systematically be included in a multidisciplinary approach.

CD008018,0,10611186,0,Follicular and luteal phase characteristics following early cessation of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonist during ovarian stimulation for in-vitro fertilization.,"Gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRHa) are widely used in in-vitro fertilization (IVF) for the prevention of a premature rise in luteinizing hormone (LH) concentrations. However, the administration of GnRHa during the follicular phase may also impair subsequent luteal function due to retarded recovery of pituitary gonadotrophin secretion. Therefore, luteal supplementation is generally applied. The present study was designed to determine whether a premature LH surge would still be prevented after early cessation of GnRHa during ovarian stimulation and whether subsequent luteal phase LH production would be sufficient to support progesterone synthesis by the corpus luteum. Sixty patients were randomized for three groups: (i) A long GnRHa/human menopausal gonadotrophin (HMG) protocol with luteal support by repeated human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG) (n = 20), (ii) early follicular phase cessation of GnRHa without luteal support (n = 20), and (iii) a long GnRHa protocol without luteal support (n = 20). Frequent ultrasound and blood sampling was performed during the entire IVF cycle. Forty normo-ovulatory women served as controls. No premature LH surges were found after early cessation of GnRHa. In this group, some pituitary recovery occurred during the late luteal phase, but this did not affect corpus luteum function. Progesterone concentrations were shown to be dependent on disappearance of the pre-ovulatory bolus of HCG. Pregnancies occurred in all three groups. In conclusion, early follicular phase cessation of GnRHa is still effective in the prevention of a premature rise in LH. Although some pituitary recovery was observed thereafter, corpus luteum function is still abnormal due to early luteolysis."

CD008018,0,9240625,0,Prevention of gonadal damage during cytotoxic therapy.,"Infertility represents one of the main remote sequelae of cytotoxic chemotherapy given for various malignant diseases. The impairment of gonadal function after cytotoxic chemotherapy is more frequent in the male than in the female. Because dividing cells are more sensitive to the cytotoxic effects of alkylating agents than are cells at rest, it has been hypothesized that inhibition of the pituitary-gonadal axis by gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists would render the germinal epithelium less susceptible to the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapy. This hypothesis has not been thoroughly clinically tested until recently, although several investigators have demonstrated that GnRH-agonistic analogues (GnRH-a) inhibit chemotherapy-induced ovarian follicular depletion in the rat and Rhesus monkeys. Based on this rationale, we have undertaken a prospective evaluation to determine whether GnRH-a administration during combination chemotherapy for Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma could prevent posttreatment ovarian damage in women by inducing a temporary prepubertal hormonal milieu. While over 93% of the surviving patients in the GnRH-a and chemotherapy group resumed spontaneous ovulation and menses, less than 40% of the women in the control group of chemotherapy without the GnRH-a cotreatment resumed normal ovarian cyclic activity. More than 60% of the women experienced premature ovarian failure (POF) in the chemotherapy alone group. Our preliminary results suggest that GnRH-a cotreatment protects against POF during cytotoxic chemotherapy. The GnRH-a and chemotherapy cotreatment may be also suggested for young women treated by cyclophosphamide pulse therapy or other gonadotoxic treatments for systemic lupus erythematosus, organ transplantation and other autoimmune diseases. The technology of cryopreservation of human ova for future fertility in these patients awaits clinical validation and substantiation. This review discusses possibilities to prevent gonadal damage induced by cytotoxic therapy and presents the clinical data currently available."
CD008018,0,16476832,0,Breast cancer: achievements in adjuvant systemic therapies in the pre-genomic era.,"In recent decades, the use of adjuvant systemic therapies for early breast cancer has increased extensively and has most likely contributed to the decline in breast cancer mortality observed in the U.S. and in some European countries. The last few years have witnessed accelerated progress in the treatment of early breast cancer, with the introduction of taxanes and aromatase inhibitors and, most impressively, trastuzumab to the adjuvant portfolio. When compared with anthracycline-based regimens, the addition of taxanes to treatments for patients with node-positive breast cancer has shown benefits in disease-free survival and, in some trials, in overall survival; however, these drugs are not yet universally accepted as standard treatment. Significant improvements in endocrine therapy in both pre- and postmenopausal patients with endocrine-responsive disease have been made. In the postmenopausal setting, aromatase inhibitors have shown superiority over tamoxifen in a direct comparison upfront or when given in sequence after 2-5 years of tamoxifen, but the optimal modality of administration remains unclear. For premenopausal women, ovarian function suppression with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogues combined with tamoxifen has generated similar results to cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil (CMF)-based regimens. Recently, trastuzumab has had a dramatic impact on the evolution of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2)-positive early breast cancer treated with standard adjuvant modalities; specifically, relapses, including distant relapses, have been halved. In this review, we summarize these main achievements, discuss the currently available adjuvant treatment options for breast cancer patients, and emphasize the need for more efficient translational research to improve individual treatment tailoring."

In this study the GnRH analogue goserelin in its depot formulation (Zoladex, ICI, Plankstadt) was used for treating isolated leiomyomata of the uterus. All patients were treated for 3 months before myomectomy was performed. The complete regression of a large myoma (206 cm3) was observed in 1 of 11 patients. In 5 cases a reduction in volume of more than 50% was achieved. Ovarian function was suppressed by goserelin, after a short-term stimulation, within 7 +/- 3 days.

CD008018,0,24164203,0,Pharmacologic ovarian preservation in young women undergoing chemotherapy.,"The prognosis of malignancies in young women undergoing chemotherapy has dramatically improved recently, and more attention is given to the long term quality of life, including fertility and reproductive function preservation. Some chemotherapeutic drugs are known to be associated with gonadal toxicity (cyclophosphamide, L-phenylanine mustard, busulfan and nitrogen mustard) and others have less or un-quantified effects (doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinca alkaloids, as vincristine and vinblastin, cisplatin, nitrosoureas, cytosine arabinoside). Women are in need to identify best options to minimize ovarian damage during chemotherapy through the administration of protective drugs, better choice of therapy and with advocating oncofertility preservation. We reviewed the possible options focusing on the most studied gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRH-a) and the psychologically promising oral contraceptives (OC). Controversy exist on the benefit of gonadotrophin releasing hormone agonist (GnRH-a) or combined oral contraceptive administered at time of cancer therapy in preventing premature ovarian failure in women and the available data from both human and animal studies have been mixed. The best way to preserve fertility and ovarian function in young women undergoing chemotherapy still remains to be determined. In the absence of a best approach, each case should be evaluated individually, considering patient's wishes and expectations, the type of chemotherapy, age, obstetric history, ovarian reserve (combining multiple indicators such as basal hormone profile, anti müllerian hormone -AMH- and antral follicle count), family history of premature ovarian failure. We present a review of the available evidence on the value of administering GnRH-a and OC use to minimize or prevent the effect of chemotherapy agents on reproductive function."

CD008018,0,9756268,0,Persistent pregnanediol glucuronide secretion after gonadotrophin suppression indicates adrenal source of progesterone in premature ovarian failure.,"A 2-3 fold higher urinary pregnanediol glucuronide excretion has been observed in women with premature ovarian failure, compared with age-appropriate menopausal women. Progesterone, the precursor of urinary pregnanediol glucuronide, is a secretory product of either adrenal or ovarian origin. We postulated that suppression of pituitary gonadotrophin secretion by down-regulation with a long-acting gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonist, leuprolide acetate, would decrease ovarian but not adrenal pregnanediol glucuronide. This would demonstrate a major difference in the ovarian hormonal milieu of these two groups of women. Four volunteers with premature ovarian failure collected daily first morning voided urine samples for 1 month prior to leuprolide acetate administration. Leuprolide acetate was then administered monthly for 3 months while continuing daily urinary collection. Luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), and pregnanediol glucuronide were measured in all samples and normalized for creatinine. Comparisons of pre- and post-median values for luteinizing hormone (LH), FSH, and pregnanediol glucuronide were made using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. This demonstrated significant suppression of both LH and FSH. Pregnanediol glucuronide, however, did not demonstrate a significant decline, strongly implying an adrenal source of the enhanced excretion. The decreased pregnanediol glucuronide noted in age-appropriate menopausal women compared with premature ovarian failure is likely to be a reflection of adrenal ageing."

CD008018,0,12659788,0,[Antigonadotropic effects of a 19-nor-progesterone derivative: the example of nomegestrol acetate].,"The antigonadotropic activity of progestins, progesterone and 19-norprogesterone derivatives, is generally used in clinical practice to treat hyperestrogenic symptoms and to provide a contraceptive effect in women with intolerance to exogenous estrogens. Our purpose was to review data from clinical pharmacological trials and from efficacy and/or safety clinical studies on progestin antigonadotropic properties with the example of nomegestrol acetate administered at the dose of 5 mg daily during 20 or 21 days per cycle. The antigonadotropic effect was shown by the effect on gonadotropins: in normally cycling premenopausal women, gonadotropin ovulatory peak was constantly inhibited, LH secretion was decreased and FSH increase at the end of the control cycle was inhibited by nomegestrol acetate (n = 5). Moreover, LH basal levels, LH response to exogenous GnRH and aeras under the curves (AUC) of LH pulsatile profile were decreased in the treated cycle (n = 11) compared to the control cycle. For both LH and FSH, the basal levels, the response to GnRH and the AUC of pulsatile profile were decreased by nomegestrol acetate compared to placebo in postmenopausal women; moreover, the frequency but not the amplitude of LH pulses was decreased. Depending on the woman's ovarian functional status, the effects of nomegestrol acetate on FSH were divergent (FSH increased before menopause and decreased at postmenopause), perhaps due to experimental conditions or a direct effect on the ovary. In postmenopausal women, the action of nomegestrol acetate on gonadotropin secretion was not modified by flutamide, a pure antiandrogen; this suggests that the antigonagotropic activity of the progestin is not mediated through the androgen receptor and it acts probably through the progesterone receptor. This antigonadotropic effect had an impact on ovarian function: in premenopausal women on nomegestrol acetate (n = 21), progesterone secretion was inhibited attesting to the absence of corpus luteum, the pre-ovulatory peak of estradiol was inhibited and plasma estradiol concentrations were decreased. The antigonadotropic activity of nomegestrol acetate results in reinforcement of its antiestrogenic activity, particurlarly on the endometrium and enables to treat the frequent clinical hyperestrogenic symptoms of the perimenopause without negative metabolic or hemostatic effects. In the efficacy and/or safety studies, no pregnancy was observed with nomegestrol acetate administered in antigonadotropic sequence, during 1355 treated cycles and the hormonal data (n = 205) were in agreement with the antigonadotropic effects of the progestin demonstrated in the clinical pharmacological studies.Furthermore, at the same dose and sequence, nomegestrol acetate, in addition to its inhibitory effect on ovulation, induces changes in the endometrium rendering it unable to implantation and in the cervical mucus to rendering it hostile to spermatozoa migration. However, it must be emphasized that data from experimental conditions required for the calculation of the Pearl Index are not available and therefore there is no legal claim for ""contraception""."
CD008018,0,29544634,0,GnRH in the Human Female Reproductive Axis.,"Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is recognized as the central regulator of the functions of the pituitary-gonadal axis. The increasing knowledge on the mechanisms controlling the development and the function of GnRH-producing neurons is leading to a better diagnostic and therapeutic approach for hypogonadotropic hypogonadisms and for alterations of the puberty onset. During female life span, the function of the GnRH pulse generator may be affected by a number of inputs from other neuronal systems, offering alternative strategies for diagnostic and therapeutic interventions. Moreover, the identification of a GnRH/GnRH receptor system in both human ovary and endometrium has widened the spectrum of action of the peptide outside its hypothalamic functions. The pharmacological use of GnRH itself or its synthetic analogs (agonists and antagonists) provides a valid tool to either stimulate or block gonadotropin secretion and to modulate the female fertility in several reproductive disorders and in assisted reproduction technology. The use of GnRH agonists in young female patients undergoing chemotherapy is also considered a promising therapeutic approach to counteract iatrogenic ovarian failure."

Attempts to treat this disease have shown that a number of hormonal manipulations may be helpful but that surgical oophorectomy alone or associated with administration of progesterone is the most effective treatment. This report describes the response to treatment with an analog of luteinizing-hormone-releasing hormone, goserelin, which is able to induce a marked suppression of the secretion of ovarian sex steroid and demonstrates with pulmonary function studies, arterial blood gas determinations, and bronchoalveolar lavage parameters that this patient's disease was responsive to this agent."

CD008018,0,28002850,0,Medical Management of Endometriosis in Patients with Chronic Pelvic Pain.,"Endometriosis is a common cause of pelvic pain in women of reproductive age. Traditional medical therapies are hormonal in nature, including estrogen-progestin contraceptives, progestins, and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists. Other hormonal options are androgens and aromatase inhibitors, with research also suggesting a possible role for GnRH antagonists and selective progesterone receptor modulators. Other than nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories, further work is required for nonhormonal therapies such as antiangiogenic and immune-modulating drugs. Medical treatment of endometriosis can be complex, and requires consideration of side effects, the anatomic type of endometriosis, role of surgery, current infertility or future fertility desires, and other contributors to pain (e.g., central sensitization). These factors should be discussed for each patient, to ensure personalized treatment and optimal outcomes."

The TAP-144-SR Japanese Study Group on Central Precocious Puberty.,"We evaluated the effect of leuprorelin treatment on adult height (AH) and followed recovery of reproductive function in 63 girls and 13 boys with central precocious puberty (CPP). Mean treatment durations were 3.8 +/- 2.0 and 4.1 +/- 2.5 yr, and posttreatment follow-up durations were 3.5 +/- 1.3 and 2.6 +/- 1.1 yr for girls and boys, respectively. AH was 154.5 +/- 5.7 cm for girls, and 89.5% of girls reached AH within their target height range. For boys, AH was 163.2 +/- 13.0 cm, and 90.9% reached target height range. It appeared that the Bayley-Pinneau method, modified for Japanese children, using a table for advanced bone age (BA), overestimated AH in CPP; and this method, using a table for average BA and projected height for BA, was suitable for prediction of AH in CPP. Menarche or remenarche occurred in 96.8% of girls at the age of 13.1 +/- 1.5 yr. Of 11 girls who contributed urine samples, all seven idiopathic and two organic cases were considered to have ovulation. Serum testosterone levels reached normal adult level in all boys.

CD008018,0,22752060,0,Effects of bone-targeted agents on cancer progression and mortality.,"Bone-targeted treatments with bisphosphonates and denosumab, which reduce bone resorption, are known to reduce the risk of skeletal complications and prevent treatment-induced bone loss in patients with malignant bone disease. Additionally, these drugs may modify the course of bone destruction via inhibitory effects on the ""vicious cycle"" of growth factor and cytokine signaling between tumor and bone cells within the bone marrow microenvironment. Effects of the drugs on the stem cell niche, direct effects on the cancer cells, and immune modulation may also contribute. In early-stage (stages I, II, and III) breast cancer, treatment with the bisphosphonate zoledronic acid has shown improvements in disease-free and overall survival. Improved survival was particularly notable in women with established menopause at diagnosis and in premenopausal women with endocrine-responsive disease who received treatment with goserelin, which suppresses ovarian function by inhibiting the production of ovarian hormones. Additionally, in castrate-resistant prostate cancer, treatment with denosumab delays the development of bone metastases. These results strongly support the adjuvant use of bone-targeted treatments but suggest that reproductive hormones are an important treatment modifier to take into account. In advanced-stage (stage IV, ie, metastatic) cancers, survival benefits have been observed in patients with multiple myeloma and in patients with other solid tumors with rapid rates of bone destruction who received treatment with zoledronic acid. Here, we have critically reviewed the increasing evidence to support a disease-modifying effect of bone-targeted treatment and discussed the impact on clinical management."

We considered eligible for inclusion in the study only women with normal thyroid function (serum thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH] range: 0.2-4.0 mIU/L, serum thyroxin values: 9-22 pmol/L) and negative personal history for previous thyroid disorders. According to which protocols were implemented to gain hypothalamic inhibition, patients were assigned to group A (70 women treated by long gonadotropin-releasing hormone [GnRH] agonist protocol) or to group B (86 women treated by flexible GnRH antagonist protocol). Before initiating controlled ovarian stimulation (COS), both groups were further stratified into 4 subgroups: A1 (46 of the 70 women) and B1 (61 of the 86 women) in women with a baseline TSH value <2.5 mIU/L, whereas those with a baseline value ≥2.5 mIU/L were assigned to groups A2 (24 of the 70 women) and B2 (25 of the 86 women). Prior to initiating stimulation (T-0), 17-β-estradiol (E(2)) and TSH serum values were dosed in all women and repeated on T-5 (day 5 of COS) and subsequently every 2 days until T-ov-ind (ovulation induction day) and T-pick-up (oocytes retrieval day). In case of detection of TSH levels above the cutoff, patients were screened for thyroxin and thyroid autoantibody serum values. In group A, E(2) at T-ov-ind was significantly increased compared to group B (P < .01), whereas TSH values showed an opposite trend (not significantly modified in group A, whereas significantly increased in group B; P < .001). A total of 64 women were found to have TSH values above the cutoff during COS: 7 in group A (11%) and 57 in group B (89%). Among them, 5 (71.4%) of the 7 in group A displayed hypothyroidism (and 4 of the 5 autoantibody positivity), whereas in group B, 6 (10.5%) of the 57 displayed hypothyroidism (and 2 of the 6 autoantibody positivity; P < .001). No pregnancies were observed in women with hypothyroidism, whereas in the 53 women with ""isolated"" increased TSH (normal T4, negative antibodies), we reported a 20.7% clinical pregnancy rate and a 54.5% ongoing pregnancy rate. Our preliminary data, despite requiring further confirmation, seem to suggest that the various drugs used for gaining hypothalamic control during COS could interfere through different mechanisms with physiological function of thyroid axis, potentially affecting its regulation."

Five patients with stage IV endometriosis were administered triptorelin 3.75 mg intramuscularly with monthly intervals in combination with oral danazol 100 mg/day for 6 months. Laparoscopy was performed before and after therapy to assess the change in endometriotic lesions. During controls, patients were evaluated for the change in hormonal and biochemical parameters and the side effects of the treatment. In 4 patients with ovarian endometriomas, cysts were drained during initial laparoscopy. None of the endometriomas persisted after therapy. Total scores, according to the revised American Fertility Society classification of endometriosis were, 54.8 +/- 10.9 before treatment and decreased to 31.6 +/- 10.3 (P < 0.05), whereas, endometriotic implants scores changed from an initial value of 22.8 +/- 12.1 to 1.2 +/- 1.1 (P < 0.05).

What are their side-effects? What are the best diagnostic indications? Possibilities include ovulation inducers but also all types of treatment capable of improving the fertility of these women. The treatment of infertility due to adrenal hyperandrogenism is based upon glucocorticoids. This treatment must be continued for 3 months after conception, to attempt to avoid early spontaneous abortion. The first-line inducer in ovarian hyperandrogenism is clomiphene citrate. The good results obtained using the combination of dexamethasone and clomiphene citrate are explained by an adrenal participation in this type of hyperandrogenism. In case of failure, and in addition to classical menotrophins:--pre-treatment using LHRH agonists avoids the onset of premature luteinisation but does not prevent the possibility of multiple pregnancies;--use of purified FSH reduces, though not sufficiently, the risks of multifollicular maturation but does not greatly increase the overall pregnancy rate;--the ""slow"" protocol with purified FSH reduces the incidence of multifollicular maturation. Should this fail, prior treatment with an LHRH agonist and if not the pulsed administration of LHRH in non-obese women can be suggested. Surgical treatment provides useful results in severe forms of sterility due to polycystic ovaries syndrome, with new per-celioscopic techniques."

CD008018,0,24397218,0,Comprehensive management of diffuse leiomyomatosis in a patient with Alport syndrome.,"Alport syndrome with diffuse leiomyomatosis (ASDL) is a complex combination that doesn't have a specific course of treatment. In this case report, we present a 44-year-old woman with ASDL and detail her treatment. The patient presented at the emergency room (ER) with symptoms of anemia, bronchial asthma, and abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB). The patient had diffuse myomas in different areas of her body, including the esophagus and genital tract. She was treated by a multidisciplinary team that included members from the hematology/oncology, pulmonary, interventional radiology, anesthesia, surgery, and gynecology services. A physician from interventional radiology performed an embolization of the uterine arteries to treat the patient's AUB. Surgery was done in May 2011 to remove the esophageal leiomyomas to improve her pulmonary function. Surgery included a distal esophagectomy, a proximal gastrostomy, and the resection of the leiomyomatous mass. In order to shrink the tumor in her genito pelvic region so that it could be extirpated with the highest likelihood of success, the patient was treated with gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (leuprolide acetate, 3.75 mg/month for 4 months). In May 2012, the patient had a total abdominal hysterectomy (TAH), with a bilateral salpingo-ophorectomy (BSO), the excision of a leiomyoma, and a posterior colporrhaphy."

CD008018,0,15477635,0,What is the role of ovarian ablation in the management of primary and metastatic breast cancer today?,"Ovarian ablation has been used for more than a century in the treatment of breast cancer. Methods of irreversible ovarian ablation include surgical oophorectomy and ovarian irradiation. Potentially reversible castration can be accomplished medically using luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) analogues. In addition, cytotoxic chemotherapy unpredictably produces amenorrhea and primary ovarian failure in 10%-95% of premenopausal women as a function of patient age, cumulative dose, and the specific agents used. In the metastatic setting, ovarian ablation and tamoxifen monotherapies produce comparable outcomes and may be more effective when used together. While many early adjuvant trials of ovarian ablation were methodologically flawed, a more recent meta-analysis by the Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group of 12 properly designed randomized trials found significantly greater disease-free and overall survival rates for women under the age of 50, regardless of nodal status, receiving ovarian ablation as a single adjuvant therapy. Several important issues regarding the role of ovarian ablation in the treatment of breast cancer remain unresolved. Data suggest that ovarian ablation followed by some years of tamoxifen produces similar results to those seen with adjuvant chemotherapy in women with hormone-receptor positive breast cancer; however, the value of combining these modalities is still unclear. Other areas of ongoing investigation include the appropriate duration of therapy with LHRH analogues in the adjuvant setting, the long-term sequelae of ovarian suppression among young breast cancer survivors, and refinement of the population most likely to benefit from ovarian ablation or suppression."

CD008018,0,11939159,0,Use of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonists to trigger ovulation.,"The introduction of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists combined with gonadotrophins is considered to be one of the most significant advances in the development of in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment. However, ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) remains a significant complication of controlled ovarian hyperstimulation. One possible strategy to reduce the risk of this complication would be the use of GnRH agonists instead of human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) to trigger the final stages of oocyte maturation. GnRH agonists are able to induce an endogenous surge of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and the effect may be more physiological than that of exogenous hCG. Several uncontrolled and controlled clinical studies have confirmed the efficacy of GnRH agonists for triggering ovulation, and pregnancy rates are comparable to those achieved with hCG. The incidence of OHSS appears to be decreased, but larger controlled studies are required to confirm this observation. The recent introduction of GnRH antagonists has led to renewed interest in the use of GnRH agonists to induce final oocyte maturation. An international multicentre randomized controlled trial has been completed recently comparing the efficacy of GnRH agonist with hCG for triggering ovulation in women undergoing controlled ovarian hyperstimulation using the GnRH antagonist ganirelix for pituitary suppression. The aim of the study was to determine the efficacy of the novel protocol for ovarian stimulation before IVF, in terms of pregnancy outcomes and the prevention of OHSS."
CD008018,0,3123511,0,Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analog suppression renders polycystic ovarian disease patients more susceptible to ovulation induction with pulsatile GnRH.,"Pulsatile GnRH administration consistently restores normal reproductive hormone levels and ovulation in women with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, but is less effective in those with polycystic ovarian disease (PCOD). We pharmacologically created a hypogonadotropic condition with a GnRH analog (GnRH-A) in six women with PCOD to investigate the role of deranged gonadotropin secretion in PCOD and to improve the response to pulsatile GnRH ovulation induction. Before GnRH and GnRH-A treatment the women with PCOD had increased LH pulse frequency [one pulse every 55 +/- 2 (+/- SE) min; P less than 0.05] and LH pulse amplitude (10.9 +/- 1.4 U/L; P less than 0.05) compared to normal women in the follicular phase of their menstrual cycle. Each PCOD woman completed one cycle of pulsatile GnRH administration for ovulation induction before (pre-A cycles; n = 6) and one or two cycles after (post-A cycles; n = 9) GnRH-A administration [D-Ser(tBu)6-Des,Gly10-GnRH; 300 micrograms, sc, twice daily for 8 weeks]. Pulsatile GnRH (5 micrograms/bolus) was given at 60-min intervals using a Zyklomat pump. Daily blood samples were drawn during the pulsatile GnRH ovulation induction cycles for the determination of serum LH, FSH, estradiol (E2), progesterone, and testosterone, and pelvic ultrasonography was done at 1- to 4-day intervals. Mean (+/- SE) serum LH levels were elevated during the pre-A cycle (49.2 +/- 3.1 IU/L) and decreased to normal levels during the post-A cycles (19.6 +/- 1.4 IU/L; P less than 0.0001). Mean testosterone concentrations were lower during the post-A cycles [88 +/- 2 ng/dL (3.1 +/- 0.1 nmol/L)] than during the pre-A cycles [122 +/- 3 ng/dL (4.2 +/- 0.1 nmol/L); P less than 0.0001]. In the follicular phase of the post-A cycles E2 levels were significantly lower [81 +/- 5 pg/mL (300 +/- 20 pmol/L) vs. 133 +/- 14 pg/mL (490 +/- 50 pmol/L); P less than 0.0001], preovulatory ovarian volume was smaller (24.6 +/- 2.0 vs. 31.4 +/- 2.4 cm3; P less than 0.01), and the FSH to LH ratio was higher (0.56 +/- 0.03 vs. 0.16 +/- 0.01) than in the pre-A cycle, suggesting more appropriate function of the pituitary-gonadal axis. Excessive LH and E2 responses to pulsatile GnRH administration in the early follicular phase of the pre-A cycle were abolished in the post-A cycles.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
CD008018,0,8300811,0,The effect of growth hormone on granulosa cell function during in-vitro fertilization.,"The effect of growth hormone addition to human menopausal gonadotrophin (HMG), after pituitary down-regulation, on granulosa cell function, in in-vitro fertilization (IVF) was evaluated. Growth hormone or placebo were added in a prospective, randomized and double-blind manner to an existing IVF stimulation protocol. Forty-two normal ovulatory women (< or = 38 years old) with mechanical factor infertility and normal male factor were included in the study. Gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) was given from day 21 of the previous cycle until human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG) administration. Follicular stimulation with HMG was started after pituitary down-regulation. Growth hormone 12 IU/day or placebo were administered on alternate days, beginning day 1 until day 7 of HMG treatment. Granulosa cell function was evaluated, in all patients, by follicular fluid levels of ovarian steroids and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I). In 14 patients, chosen arbitrarily granulosa lutein cells were cultured in the presence and absence of additional HCG. Follicular fluid levels of oestradiol, progesterone, testosterone and IGF-I were similar in both growth hormone and placebo groups. Basal and post-HCG levels of oestradiol and progesterone did not differ significantly between the two groups of granulosa lutein cell cultures. We conclude that after pituitary down-regulation, in-vivo administration of growth hormone with HMG in young ovulatory women does not seem to affect granulosa cell function when compared to the administration of HMG alone."

CD008018,0,10511781,0,The effects of depot leuprorelin on IVF.,"The trial studied the effects of depot leuprorelin on the IVF cycle and was done on nine couples. A single intramuscular injection of depot leuprorelin was given to the woman a couple days before ovulation. Seven days after ovulation, the serum progesterone level was measured and showed the same normal level as the natural ovulatory cycle. The progesterone levels varied from 12.59 to 96.0 ng/ml. On day three of the menstruation, the hormonal profiles showed a complete pituitary and ovarian suppression. FSH, LH and estrogen levels were less than 4.1 mIU/ml, 2.8 mIU/ml and 9.4 pg/ml respectively. The hMG stimulation took 11 days on average (9-15 days). A hundred and two oocytes were retrieved and among these there were 86 mature oocytes (84.3%). All oocytes were inseminated despite prematurity and resulted in 82.35 per cent fertilization. Normal fertilization occurred in 77.45 per cent (79/102). Good embryos developed in 58.23 per cent (46/79). No more than three embryos were transferred. Four women conceived, among them there was a set of twins. The implantation rate was 44.44 per cent (4/9). One abortion was found in the early first trimester. The take home baby rate was 33.33 per cent (3/9)."
CD008018,0,9886506,0,Human chorionic gonadotrophin luteal support overcomes luteal phase inadequacy after gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonist-induced ovulation in gonadotrophin-stimulated cycles.,"Gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa)-induced ovulation after gonadotrophin ovarian stimulation is used to prevent ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome and multiple pregnancy in polyfollicular cycles. However, one of the major problems to be resolved is corpus luteum function after follicular maturation and ovulation by mid-cycle GnRHa administration. The present report investigated the luteal phase in non-conceptual polyfollicular cycles in 26 patients (group 1) receiving a single dose of 0.5 mg leuprolide acetate to induce ovulation and in a control group of patients (n = 26) (group 2) who were given human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG) (10,000 IU i.m.) for ovulation induction. All of them were normal ovulatory women undergoing gonadotrophin ovarian stimulation because of unexplained infertility or male factor. In both groups of patients two doses of 2500 IU HCG i.m. were given 6 and 10 days after the ovulatory dose of HCG or GnRHa to support the luteal phase. All cycles were ovulatory as shown by mid-luteal serum progesterone concentrations >10 ng/ml. Mean serum progesterone concentrations were 62% higher in group 2 than in group 1, but this difference was not statistically significant. The mean length of the luteal phase was similar in groups 1 and 2. It is concluded that HCG luteal support is a useful tool to overcome the luteal phase inadequacy that characterizes GnRHa-triggered cycles after gonadotrophin stimulation."
CD008018,0,21195008,0,[Is there any medical treatment to preserve fertility during chemotherapy in women?].,"Intensive use of radio-chemotherapy has greatly improved the prognosis associated with cancer in young girl or women patients. However, improvement of the vital prognosis is frequently associated with impairment of fertility and premature ovarian failure. In vitro fertilization (IVF) followed by embryo cryopreservation is an available method, which needs a partner and a pretreatment stimulation. Ovarian and oocyte cryopreservation are techniques showing great promise. However, the nec plus ultra would be to be able to protect ovaries during chemotherapy. Since more than 10 years Gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues have been investigated as possible means to preserve fertility in young women. However, even recent prospective, randomized studies do not demonstrate clearly their effectiveness. To prevent primordial follicle apoptosis, an inhibitor of tysosine kinase, imatinib, has recently been proposed and positively evaluated in mice.

Eighty-three women with uterine leiomyoma were assigned in open, parallel-group fashion to a no-treatment (control) group and a GnRH-agonist group. Serum levels of nine cytokines and chemokines as well as vascular inflammatory markers were measured. Serum levels of monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) in the GnRH-agonist group were increased significantly at 6 months. There were also significant differences in percentage changes in interleukin (IL)-6, IL8, MCP1, and macrophage inflammatory protein-1β (MIP1β) between the control and GnRH agonist groups. Soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM1) and E-selectin levels showed significant increases in the GnRH agonist group at 6 months. Serum MCP1 concentrations showed weak correlations with levels of sICAM and E-selectin. We conclude that a hypo-estrogenic state due to administration of a GnRH agonist increases circulating levels of cytokines and chemokines, especially MCP1."
CD008018,0,11129083,0,Pharmacological elements in clinical application of synthetic peptides.,"The research carried out on the biological properties of synthetic peptides and the possibility of obtaining them in adequate amounts through the recombinant DNA technology allows their use as therapeutical agents. Procedures following the synthesis of peptides must be performed in order to verify their structure, conformation, immunogenicity and biological activity and to make them suitable for clinical applications. The size of synthetic peptides together with some modifications such as amidation, acetylation and sulfatation must be taken into consideration as they may have a significant impact on half-life, stability and biological activity. Endothelial, epithelial and enzymatic interference which may hinder the absorption of drugs must be evaluated in order to choose the most appropriate route of administration. The considerable bioavailability related to the intravenous route, the effectiveness of the circulation of the intramuscular route and the possibility of reaching specific targets by the intra-arterial route must also be taken into consideration. There is the possibility of applying transdermal therapeutic systems and transdermal iontophoresis only for peptides of low molecular weight. Among synthetic peptides provided with antianaemic activity, erythropoietin, growth factors and interleukin 3 must be mentioned because of their effectiveness both in optimal stimulation of melopoiesis after chemotherapy or bone-marrow transplantation and in the treatment of anaemia occurring during chronic renal failure. Furthermore, interferon alpha was shown to be one of the most used synthetic peptides provided with antiviral and antineoplastic activity. Remarkable results have been obtained in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C, haematological malignancies and some solid tumours. More recently, interleukin 2 has been tested in the treatment of melanoma and renal cancer, inducing a reasonable proportion of overall response rate. Finally, the antagonist of gonadotropin-releasing-hormone may be regarded as effective agent both in the treatment of prostate cancer and in the inhibition of luteinizing-hormone surges during controlled ovarian stimulation. Toxic side effects can be related to the administered dose as well as to metabolites derived from bacteria in which peptides have been synthesized."
CD008018,0,26466612,0,MANAGEMENT OF ENDOCRINE DISEASE: Long-term outcomes of the treatment of central precocious puberty.,"GnRH analogues (GnRHa) are the treatment of choice for central precocious puberty (CPP), with the main objective to recover the height potential compromised by the premature fusion of growth cartilages. The aim of this review was to analyze long-term effects of GnRHa on height, body weight, reproductive function, and bone mineral density (BMD) in patients with CPP, as well as the potential predictors of outcome. Because randomized controlled trials on the effectiveness and long-term outcomes of treatment are not available, only qualified conclusions about the efficacy of interventions can be drawn. GnRHa treatment appears to improve adult height in girls with CPP, especially if diagnosed before the age of 6, whereas a real benefit in terms of adult height is still controversial in patients with the onset of puberty between 6 and 8 years of age. No height benefit was shown in patients treated after 8 years. Gonadal function is promptly restored in girls after cessation of treatment, and reproductive potential appears normal in young adulthood. Data are conflicting on the long-term risk of polycystic ovarian syndrome in both treated and untreated women. Fat mass is increased at the start of treatment but normalizes thereafter, and GnRHa itself does not seem to have any long-term effect on BMI. Similarly, analogue treatment does not appear to have a negative impact on BMD. Owing to the paucity of data available, no conclusions can be drawn on the repercussions of CPP and/or its treatment on the timing of menopause and on the health of the offspring."
CD008018,0,26255743,0,Adjuvant endocrine therapy for premenopausal women with hormone-responsive breast cancer.,"Multiple strategies for endocrine treatment of premenopausal women with hormone-responsive breast cancer have been assessed and results have been presented over the last two years. These include tamoxifen for 5-10 years (ATLAS and aTTom), tamoxifen for 5 years followed by aromatase inhibitor (AI) for 5 years for women who have become postmenopausal (MA-17); ovarian ablation (OA) by surgery (EBCTCG overview); ovarian function suppression (OFS) by LHRH agonist (LHRH agonist meta-analysis); or combinations of approaches including OFS plus tamoxifen or AI (SOFT, TEXT, ABCSG 12 and E3193). Many of these trials have taken place in the backdrop of (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy which can confound interpretation because such therapy can suppress ovarian function either transiently or permanently. Nonetheless these trials suggest in aggregate that 10 years of tamoxifen are better than 5 years and that a program of extended adjuvant therapy of tamoxifen for 5 years followed by aromatase inhibitor for 5 years is effective for suitable candidates. The SOFT and E3193 trials do not show a major advantage for use of OFS + tamoxifen compared to tamoxifen alone. The joint SOFT/TEXT analysis and ABCGS12 trials both suggest that outcomes can be excellent with the use of combined endocrine therapy alone in properly selected patients but give conflicting results with regard to potential benefits for OFS + AI compared with OFS + tamoxifen. Further work will be needed to ascertain long-term outcomes, identify factors that predict who will benefit from extended adjuvant endocrine therapy, and assess role of OFS by medical or surgical means. It is clear, however, that endocrine therapy is a critical part of the adjuvant regimen for most premenopausal women with hormone-responsive breast cancer, and a subset of these women with luminal A-type tumors can be safely treated with endocrine therapy alone."

Ovulation was induced by the following protocols: group I (271 cycles): buserelin short protocol (1 mg/day, intranasally) with human menopausal gonadotropin/human chorionic gonadotropin (hMG/hCG); group II (45 cycles): buserelin (short protocol) with pure follicle stimulating hormone (p-FSH)/hMG/hCG; group III (24 cycles): clomiphene citrate (100 mg/day) with hMG/hCG; group IV (122 cycles): hMG (3 ampules/day) and hCG; group V (113 cycles): hMG/hCG and prednisolone (7.5 mg/day) after cycle programming with oral contraceptives. The lowest cancellation rate (3.3%) was noted in group I, followed by group V (9.7%). The highest number of follicles was observed in groups I (8.3 +/- 0.3; mean +/- SEM) and V (7.8 +/- 0.5). Also, more oocytes were retrieved in group I (7.2 +/- 0.3, p < 0.001), which were of good quality based on oocyte maturity as well as on the fertilization rate, and more embryos (4.5 +/- 0.3, p < 0.05) were developed. The correlation between estradiol and the total follicular volume on the day of hCG administration was also examined in the five groups. The best correlation (r = 0.6502) was found in group I, followed by group V (r = 0.5810). Significant differences were observed in the five groups with regard to the number of hMG ampules administered (p < 0.0001, F = 15.393) and the stimulation days (p < 0.0001, F = 35.32). Sixty-six clinical pregnancies were achieved: 37 (17.5%) in group I, seven (25.9%) in group II, one (10%) in group III, ten (15.6%) in group IV and 11 (15.5%) in group V (differences were not statistically significant). In conclusion, all five protocols were satisfactory in ovarian stimulation for in vitro fertilization, and gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) analogs seemed to be more advantageous by reducing the cancellation rate, enhancing the number of oocytes retrieved and embryos developed and by improving the pregnancy rates."

Lung biopsy confirmed LAM in both patients. Both were treated sequentially with medroxyprogesterone and a LHRH agonist (buserelin) to achieve reversible medical castration. Neither subjective nor objective improvement was noted after 13 and 5 months, respectively, of buserelin therapy (900 micrograms/day, nasal spray) despite an effective suppression of the pituitary-gonadal axis.

Thirteen received chemotherapy before the age of 11 years. Ten remained prepubertal at their last assessment, nine of whom showed biochemical evidence of primary ovarian failure. The remaining three were pubertal or adult, and although basal follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinising hormone (LH) levels were normal, all had shown abnormalities of gonadotrophin secretion previously. Eight girls received chemotherapy after 11 years of age. Only three girls exhibited an elevated basal FSH level or exaggerated FSH response to GnRH. Elevated basal FSH values had been noted previously in two of the other five girls. All girls entered or progressed through puberty spontaneously. Seven experienced menarche at an appropriate age. However in four, gonadotrophin levels, which had been elevated, were now within the normal range. In two, menses had continued throughout with normal midfollicular oestradiol levels, whilst the other two developed secondary amenorrhoea associated with radiation-induced gonadotrophin deficiency. The majority of girls showed evidence of primary ovarian dysfunction. This did not prejudice pubertal development or the timing of menarche.

CD008018,0,22503276,0,The effects of letrozole on ovarian stimulation for fertility preservation in cancer-affected women.,"Survival rates for fertile women with cancer have increased significantly, lending importance to considering the possibility of motherhood after cancer. This study was a retrospective analysis of a prospective database comparing two groups of patients who underwent fertility preservation after being diagnosed with either breast cancer or a non-hormone-dependent cancer between 2009 and 2011. Nineteen oncology patients were included in the study. The objective was to assess the efficacy of ovarian stimulation with aromatase inhibitors versus a standard antagonist protocol. This study sought to quantify oestradiol concentrations in patients receiving letrozole and to determine the length of time between diagnosis of malignancy and onset of fertility preservation. Number of mature oocytes retrieved in the non-hormone-dependent cancer group was comparable to that in the breast cancer group (15.4±8.19 versus 16.3±7.31). Oestradiol concentrations were higher for patients with non-hormone-dependent cancer (1666.4±739.42 pg/ml versus 829±551.11 pg/ml, P=0.006). There were no differences between the groups in the length of time between diagnosis and fertility preservation (17.4±4.93 versus 16.4±1.74 days). Oestradiol concentrations of breast cancer patients on the letrozole protocol remained much lower than those of patients on the antagonist protocol."

CD008018,0,17923831,0,Assisted reproduction and breast cancer.,"Breast cancer is the most frequent cancer in reproductive age women. Although well known causal link between estrogen and breast cancer, the impact of ovulation induction on the risk of breast cancer still remains to be clarified. One of the recently recognized long term adverse effects of adjuvant cytotoxic chemotherapy given for breast cancer is premature ovarian failure and infertility, both of which significantly compromise the quality of life of a cancer survivor. Thanks to significant developments in assisted reproductive technologies these patients may benefit from a wide range of fertility preservation options. The most established technique is embryo cryopreservation; oocyte cryopreservation can be considered in single women; both of which require at least 2 weeks of ovarian stimulation beginning with the onset of the patient's menstrual cycle. Novel ovarian stimulation protocols using tamoxifen and letrozole can be used to increase the margin of safety in estrogen sensitive breast tumors. When there is no time available for ovulation induction, ovarian tissue can be cryopreserved for future transplantation without delay in cancer therapy. The benefit of ovarian protection by gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues is unproven and unlikely, and thus this treatment should not be recommended as the sole method of fertility preservation."
CD008018,0,27422055,0,Preservation of gonadal function in women undergoing chemotherapy: a review of the potential role for gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists.,"A cancer diagnosis in women of reproductive age has unique medical and psychosocial ramifications, especially with treatments that are known to cause gonadal toxicity. For patients who undergo chemotherapy, a multidisciplinary team approach is essential to ensure that the patients' reproductive wishes are addressed. Currently, embryo and oocyte cryopreservation are the standard of care for those who wish to preserve their fertility. The use of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists has been a source of debate with numerous studies that have investigated the efficacy on both fertility and ovarian function preservation. This review evaluates the current literature on the use of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists for preservation of gonadal function. Assisted reproductive technology is excellent for preservation of fertility but will not protect gonadal function. Protection of gonadal function is critical for the broader issues of health and quality of life as a result of a hypogonadal state. At this moment, gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists are the only drug class available to protect gonadal function."

CD008018,0,17353864,0,Gender difference: fertility preservation in young women but not in men exposed to gonadotoxic chemotherapy.,"Decreased secretion of pituitary gonadotropins, by decreasing gonadal function, may possibly protect against the sterilizing effects of chemotherapy. Although previous claims that primordial germ cells fare better than germ cells that are part of an active cell cycle have been made, this hypothesis has not been seriously tested clinically until recently. The only prospective randomized study performed to date found that gonadotropin releasing hormone agonistic analogue (GnRH-a) protected the ovary against cyclophosphamide-induced damage in Rhesus monkeys by significantly decreasing the number of follicles lost during the chemotherapeutic insult. We have administered a monthly depot i.m. injection of GnRH-a to more than 125 young patients exposed to gonadotoxic chemotherapy for malignant or nonmalignant diseases, after informed consent, starting before chemotherapy for up to 6 months, in parallel and until the end of chemotherapeutic treatment. Less than 7% developed irreversible hypergonadotropic amenorrhea. The remainder (>93%) resumed cyclic ovarian function, of which 32 patients spontaneously conceived 46 times. These patients were compared to a control group of over 125 patients of comparable age (15-40 years), who were similarly treated with chemotherapy but without the GnRH-a adjuvant. The 2 groups were similar in age, diagnosis, and the ratio of HD to non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients. The 2 groups also received similar doses of radiotherapy exposure and the proportion of radio-plus chemotherapy-treated patients was similar. The cumulative doses of each chemotherapeutic agent and the mean or median radiotherapy exposure did not differ between the groups. Our and others' results support the effectiveness of GnRH-a administration also to patients receiving cyclophosphamide pulses for systemic lupus erythematosus and other autoimmune diseases. Possible explanations for the beneficial effect of the GnRH-a on minimizing the gonadotoxic effect of chemotherapy are discussed. Multi-center prospective, randomized studies are awaited to substantiate the in vivo effect of GnRH-a as an unequivocal means of minimizing follicular apoptosis."

CD008018,0,18056027,0,The contribution of luteinizing hormone to Alzheimer disease pathogenesis.,"Several hypotheses have been proposed that attempt to explain the pathogenesis of Alzheimer Disease (AD) including theories involving senile plaque and neurofibrillary tangle formation, increased oxidative stress, and cell cycle abnormalities, since evidence for each of these pathological phenomena have been well documented in AD. Recent epidemiological and experimental data also support a role for the gonadotropin luteinizing hormone in AD. Paralleling the female predominance for developing AD, luteinizing hormone levels are significantly higher in females as compared to males, and furthermore, luteinizing hormone levels are higher still in individuals who succumb to AD. Luteinizing hormone, which is capable of modulating cognitive behavior, is not only present in the brain, but also has the highest receptor levels in the hippocampus, a key processor of cognition that is severely deteriorated in AD. Furthermore, we recently examined cognitive performance in a well-characterized transgenic mouse that over-expresses luteinizing hormone and found that these animals show decreased cognitive performance when compared to controls. We have also found that abolishing luteinizing hormone in amyloid-beta protein precursor transgenic mice (Tg2576) using a potent gonadotropin-lowering gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist, leuprolide acetate, resulted in improved hippocampally-related cognitive performance and decreased amyloid-beta deposition. These findings, together with data indicating that luteinizing hormone modulates amyloid-beta protein precursor processing in vivo and in vitro, suggest that luteinizing hormone may contribute to AD pathology through an amyloid-dependent mechanism. These promising findings support the importance of luteinizing hormone in AD and bring to the forefront an alternative, and much needed, therapeutic avenue for the treatment of this insidious disease."

CD008018,0,18468953,0,Medical management of fibroids.,"The ideal medical therapy for fibroids is, arguably, a tablet that is taken by mouth, once a day or, even better, once a week, with minimal, if any, side-effects, that induces fibroid regression and thus a resolution of symptoms rapidly, but without affecting fertility. Such a magic bullet does not yet exist, and there are no indications that one is on the horizon. Driven by the observation that fibroid growth is hormone dependent, current medical treatments mainly involve hormonal manipulations. Gonadotrophin-releasing hormone analogues (GnRHa) have been the most widely used, and while they do cause fibroid regression, they can only be used in the short term, as temporizing measures in the perimenopausal woman, or pre-operatively to reduce fibroid size, influence the type of surgery, restore haemoglobin levels and apparently reduce blood loss at operation. They are notorious for rebound growth of the fibroids upon cessation of therapy, and have major side-effects. GnRH antagonists avoid the initial flare effect seen with GnRHa therapy, but otherwise do not appear to have any additional advantages over GnRHa. Selective oestrogen receptor modulators, such as raloxifene, have been shown to induce fibroid regression effectively in post-, but not pre-, menopausal women; even in the former group, experience with these drugs is limited, and they are associated with significant side-effects. Aromatase inhibitors only appear to be effective in postmenopausal women, have potentially significant long-term side-effects, and experience with their use is also limited. There are suggestions that the levonorgestrel intra-uterine system can cause dramatic reduction in menstrual flow in women with fibroids, but to date there have been no RCTs of its use in these women, in whom rates of expulsion of the device appear to be high. The progesterone antagonists mifepristone and asoprisnil have shown significant promise and warrant further research, as they appear to show efficacy in inducing fibroid regression without major side-effects. However, they and the other hormonal therapies that alter oestrogen and progesterone production or function significantly (danazol, gestrinone) are not compatible with reproduction. Therefore, the quest for the ideal medical therapy for fibroid disease continues, and increasing understanding of fibroid biology is ushering in non-hormonal therapies, although all are confined to laboratory experimentation at present. In the meantime, surgical and radiological approaches remain the mainstay effective therapies."

CD008018,0,8213225,0,Comparison of hCG versus GnRH analog for releasing oocytes following ultra low-dose gonadotropin stimulation.,"Previous data have suggested there is a higher incidence of luteinized unruptured follicle (LUF) syndrome (defined as failure to release any oocyte as determined by sonography) in gonadotropin-treated patients following human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) versus the gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist (GnRH-a) leuprolide acetate. The present study was designed to determine if an ultra low-dose gonadotropin regimen, designed not to raise the serum estradiol level much above normal for non-stimulated cycles, might result in a decrease in LUF following hCG treatment, and even reduce the rate to that seen following leuprolide acetate. The hypothesis tested was that the higher estradiol levels might suppress the pre-ovulatory follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) surge which, in turn, would inhibit plasmin production, thus preventing detachment of the oocyte from the follicle. The data did show a reduced rate of LUF incidence with either hCG or leuprolide acetate in ultra low-dose human menopausal gonadotropin-(hMG-) treated patients compared to data from previous studies with conventional hMG/hCG therapy. Pregnancy rates were also similar following hCG or leuprolide acetate for release in low-dose hMG-treated patients. Preliminary data show that leuprolide acetate is superior to hCG for causing oocyte release when stimulation is with low-dose purified FSH, and possibly also that low-dose hMG is superior to low-dose purified FSH for producing superior pregnancy rates."
CD008018,0,1386817,0,The response of uterine fibroids to GnRH-agonist treatment can be predicted in most cases after one month.,"Twenty-seven patients with uterine fibroids were treated for 3 months with the GnRH-agonist goserelin prior to surgical myomectomy. Ovarian function was suppressed reliably in all patients. After three applications, 15 fibroids were reduced in volume by more than 50%, and one complete remission was achieved. Seven patients showed a decrease of 10-50% in volume. However, in 5 cases there was no significant reduction. Analysing the time course of the fibroid reduction, the response can be predicted in most cases as early as four weeks after the first injection. Retrospective statistical analysis showed that a 50% reduction in fibroid size due to GnRH treatment is preceded by a 35% reduction after 4 weeks in 81% of cases, and after 8 weeks in all cases. Only 2 of 12 fibroids, which showed a smaller response (less than 50%) to GnRH therapy, were reduced by more than 35% after 4 and 8 weeks. In most cases it seems to be possible to estimate the individual response to GnRH-application after the first injection, so that it is possible to stop therapy in non-responding patients."

With the publication of the SOFT (Suppression of Ovarian Function Trial) and TEXT (Tamoxifen and Exemestane Trial) randomized trials, there is considerable interest in OA as an adjuvant treatment, either in combination with tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor (AI). Thus, we have reviewed current guidelines and key studies on this important topic and have highlighted the relevant biological and pharmacological aspects of the various endocrine therapies. The results of two key randomized trials addressing the use and controversies of OA in premenopausal breast cancer are discussed and recent research emphasizing the detrimental consequences of premature menopause and the cost-effectiveness of OA is presented. In low-risk patients with HRP premenopausal breast cancer, OA is not beneficial and tamoxifen remains the anti-hormone treatment of choice. In high-risk women (previous chemotherapy or women younger than 35), OA in combination with AI is more effective but is arguably not cost-effective, particularly when OA is achieved medically using a GnRH agonist/antagonist. Compared to tamoxifen alone, the SOFT trial showed a 4.5-7.7% reduction in breast cancer relapse using OA (in combination with either tamoxifen or AI) in high-risk women, though the 5-year overall survival benefit was limited (1.4-3.6%). Premature menopause is associated with long-term mortality risks and women often experience significant menopausal symptoms that impact on quality of life. These considerations should play a role in the treatment selection of those patients who may benefit from adjuvant OA."

CD008018,0,25673474,0,Clinical benefit of sequential use of endocrine therapies for metastatic breast cancer.,"Sequential use of endocrine agents is common in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC). In premenopausal women with MBC, tamoxifen and/or a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH) agonist are options for endocrine treatment. Meta-analysis showed that the combination of the two agents is superior to either monotherapy. Under ovarian ablation or function-suppression, an agent used to treat postmenopausal women, such as the aromatase inhibitor (AI), fulvestrant, becomes possible as a subsequent therapy. In postmenopausal women, endocrine treatment options are widely available and an optimal sequence has not yet to be determined. Options for first-line therapy of metastatic disease include an AI for women who have received adjuvant tamoxifen, or tamoxifen for patients who have received adjuvant AI. In addition, data suggest that fulvestrant is a promising therapeutic option that has proven efficacy in the treatment of postmenopausal women with MBC. Other agents that may be used in the sequence include a steroidal AI or a progestin. Furthermore, estrogen additive therapy by with diethylstilbestrol or ethinylestradiol has recently been revived and showed a high response rate as a salvage endocrine therapy, although its mechanism of action is still unclear. Thus, sequential use of endocrine therapies, especially the use of a subsequent therapy with a different mechanism of action to the prior therapy, has a beneficial effect in maintaining a good quality of life and extending survival for MBC with hormone responsiveness."

Several strategies have been implemented with the purpose to overcome the issue of follicular depletion associated with the chemotherapic agents. When possible, cryopreservation of embryos, either isolated or associated to other procedures, is the technique that presents more scientific evidence and the best pregnancy rates. Other procedures, more experimental, could be proposed in the setting of clinical studies and allways after informed consent. This is the case of cryopreservation of ovaric tissue, the use of GnRH agonists and the cryopreservation of oocytes. Finally some emerging techniques like in vitro maturation of oocytes, anti-apoptotic drugs that protect the gonadals from the toxicity of chemotherapy or the use of stem cells to improve the ovarian reserve, can in the future have a place in oncofertility preservation. In patients with breast cancer the technique that shows better outcomes continues to be the cryopreservation of embryos after a protocol of follicular stimulation allied to the aromatase inhibitors with lower levels of plasmatic stradiol. Children are a special group in which the options are limited, being the cryopreservation of ovaric tissue the most promising strategy although still constitutes an experimental technique.

CD008018,0,18515310,0,Hormonal suppression for fertility preservation in males and females.,"Methods to restore fertility of men and women sterilized by medical treatments and environmental toxicant exposures are under investigation. Rendering spermatogenesis and ovarian follicular development kinetically quiescent by suppression of gonadotropins has been proposed to protect them from damage by cytotoxic therapy. Although the method fails to protect the fertility of male mice and monkeys, gonadotropin and testosterone suppression in rats before or after cytotoxic therapy do enhance the recovery of spermatogenesis. However, the mechanism involves not the induction of quiescence but rather the reversal, by suppression of testosterone, of a block in differentiation of surviving spermatogonia caused by damage to the somatic environment. In men, only one of eight clinical trials was successful in protecting or restoring spermatogenesis after cytotoxic therapy. In women, protection of primordial follicles in several species from damage by cytotoxic agents using GnRH analogs has been claimed; however, only two studies in mice appear convincing. The protection cannot involve the induction of quiescence in the already dormant primordial follicle but may involve direct effects of GnRH analogs or indirect effects of gonadotropin suppression on the whole ovary. Although numerous studies in female patients undergoing chemotherapy indicate that GnRH analogs might be protective of ovarian function, none of the studies showing protection were prospective randomized clinical trials and thus they are inconclusive. Considering interspecies differences and similarities in the gonadal sensitivity to cytotoxic agents and hormones, mechanistic studies are needed to identify the specific beneficial effects of hormonal suppression in select animal models that may be applicable to humans."

CD008018,0,24503025,0,Adjuvant endocrine therapy of perimenopausal and recently postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.,"Although 5 years of tamoxifen has been the standard adjuvant endocrine therapy for premenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer for more than 2 decades, emerging results suggest that either switching to an aromatase inhibitor after 5 years of tamoxifen when postmenopausal or continuing tamoxifen for an additional 5 years can further decrease relapse risk. As a result, more premenopausal breast cancer patients will be continuing adjuvant endocrine therapy through the menopause transition. In this setting, questions arise regarding continued tamoxifen use through 10 years and/or the timing and appropriateness of switching to an aromatase inhibitor. In addition, it is now recognized that estrogen levels substantially decline for approximately 2 years after the last menstrual period and that chemotherapy and/or tamoxifen-induced amenorrhea preclude reliable ovarian function determination. Because aromatase inhibitors are only effective in a low estrogen environment without ovarian estrogen production, determination of the optimal endocrine adjuvant therapy for perimenopausal women and those recently postmenopausal represent a challenge requiring understanding of current clinical study results and the potential for interactions among therapeutic interventions, ovarian function, and clinical outcome. Available options include tamoxifen for 10 years, tamoxifen for 5 years followed by aromatase inhibitors, tamoxifen with a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist, aromatase inhibitor with an LHRH agonist or aromatase inhibitor with bilateral oophorectomy. Although completed (Austrian Breast Cancer Study Group [ABCSG]-12) and ongoing (SOFT [Suppression of Ovarian Function Trial], TEXT [Tamoxifen and Exemestane Trial]) clinical trials are addressing some issues, many questions will remain requiring individualized clinical judgement.

CD008018,0,21472633,0,Fertility preservation in girls and adolescents before chemotherapy and radiation - review of the literature.,"There has been a significant improvement in survival rates over the last decade as a result of advances in the treatment of cancer in children. One of the consequences of chemotherapy may be damage to the ovarian function, which can lead to loss of fertility. Methods of fertility protection have been developed for adult women as a result of advances in reproductive medicine, which make the option of becoming pregnant after surviving cancer realistic. However, only some of the methods can be used in prepubescent girls and adolescents. In addition, a higher number of miscarriages and premature births have been found in women who underwent pelvic radiotherapy during childhood or adolescence and the children were more commonly growth retarded. The effects of cancer treatment on the ovarian function and later fertility should be discussed at the start of treatment."
CD008018,0,20972713,0,Fertility preservation and infertility treatment in breast cancer patients.,"About 12% of breast cancer cases occur before the age of 35 years. Thus, young patients may consider preservation of ovarian function during cytotoxic therapy and/or childbearing after treatment. Besides the exposure to cytotoxic agents over several months, a significant number of patients will need sequential antihormonal therapy for years. Thus, even young patients at diagnosis may have to postpone pregnancy for years. At that time, the probability of pregnancy may per se be considerably reduced. Young patients per se carry a worse prognosis compared to their postmenopausal counterparts. Ovaries may harbor viable tumor cells. Premenopausal patients have a higher prevalence of BRCA gene mutation than older patients. Thus, even if the ovaries are preserved, the risk of developing cancer in the ovary may be high. Normal menstrual cyclicity after chemotherapy/antihormonal therapy does not preclude premature ovarian failure. After antineoplastic therapy, it is recommended to wait at least for two months before the evaluation of the ovarian function. The most reliable parameter to assess the ovarian reserve is the anti-muellerian factor (AMH; Muellerian Inhibiting Factor, MIF). Four randomized studies have investigated the protective effect of the GnRH analogue goserelin on ovarian function. Due to the inconsistent results observed, the concurrent administration of GnRH analogues with cytostatic chemotherapy now has to be considered experimental and cannot be recommended. Emergency in vitro fertilization may be performed between breast cancer diagnosis and the start of chemotherapy in selected cases. Extracorporal in vitro fertilization may be performed and the resultant embryo cryopreserved to preserve fertility."
CD008018,0,9405728,0,Biochemical markers as predictors of bone mineral density changes after GnRH agonist treatment.,"To evaluate bone biochemical markers as predictors of the efficacy of a hormone replacement therapy (HRT), we studied the bone changes induced by the cessation and return of ovarian function in 28 patients treated for 6 months with a GnRH agonist. This model reproduced the effects observed in postmenopausal women with high bone turnover treated with HRT. At the end of the treatment, Z scores were 1.8 +/- 0.3 for Crosslaps (CTx) and deoxypyridinoline (D-Pyr), and 1.1 +/- 0.2 for bone alkaline phosphatase (B-ALP) and osteocalcin (OC). This indicated an imbalance in bone remodeling with a high bone resorption. Bone mineral density (BMD) fell by 4.2 +/- 2.5%. The changes in BMD between the 6th and 12th months were 0. 34 +/- 2.24 and -1.73 +/- 3.25% at the lumbar spine and the femoral neck, respectively. Biochemical markers except urinary calcium and hydroxyproline measured at 6 months were positively correlated with the BMD changes at the lumbar spine. After the resumption of menstruation, 13 of 28 women displayed positive spine BMD changes between the 6th and 12th months; in this group, bone biochemical markers measured at 6 months were significantly higher (P = 0.02). Stepwise regression analysis showed that the association of B-ALP and D-Pyr measured at 6 months explained 40% of BMD variance and the association of B-ALP, PTH, and estradiol 56%. We conclude that measuring individual biochemical bone markers can help to predict the bone effect of an increase in the circulating estradiol in women with ovarian deficiency."

CD008018,0,20642381,0,Relationship between the oestradiol/oocyte ratio and the outcome of assisted reproductive technology cycles with gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist.,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship of oestradiol level on the day of hCG (peak E2)/oocyte ratio and the outcome of ART cycles. Of the patients who underwent IVF-ET, 600 normal and high responders to the first cycle of COH with gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH)-agonist were included in the study. Patients were designated into three groups based on peak E2/oocyte ratio (Group A: <100 pg/ml per oocyte, Group B: 100-200 pg/ml per oocyte, Group C: >200 pg/ml per oocyte). A comparison among groups was made regarding ovarian stimulation characteristics, fertilisation, implantation and pregnancy rates. After the division based on E2/oocyte ratio, in Group C, the number of oocytes retrieved, 2PN and M2 oocyte were statistically lower than both of the other two groups (p = 0.001, 0.001, 0.001, 0.045). HCG day E2 level was significantly different in all groups (p = 0.001), and fertilisation rate was meaningfully highest in Group C and lowest in Group A (p = 0.001). No difference existed among the three groups with respect to the number of embryos transferred and implantation rates. However, clinical pregnancy rate was significantly lower in Group A than others (p = 0.04). In ART cycles suppressed by GnRH-agonist, IVF outcomes are lower in patients with an E2/oocyte proportion of <100 pg/ml per oocyte."

CD008018,0,23515450,0,Treatment and outcomes of precocious puberty: an update.,"Precocious puberty is a common problem affecting up to 29 per 100,000 girls per year. The earliest identified neuroendocrine change in early puberty thus far is increased kisspeptin secretion from the arcuate nucleus and the anteroventral paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus. The regulation of kisspeptin secretion is not well understood, but neurokinin B and dynorphin provide autocrine regulation. The etiologies of precocious puberty may be subdivided into GnRH-dependent and GnRH-independent causes. GnRH-dependent precocious puberty, often called central precocious puberty (CPP), is usually treated with GnRH analogs. Newer developments in the treatment of CPP include expanded data on the safety and efficacy of the subdermal histrelin implant, which is useful for long-term treatment, although removal may be difficult in some cases. Preliminary data suggest that the implant may be left in place for up to 2 years without loss of biochemical suppression. In the last 2 years, more data have been published concerning extended-release leuprolide acetate injections that indicate that the 11.25-mg dose may not provide full biochemical suppression but may clinically suppress signs of puberty, including the accelerated growth velocity and advanced skeletal maturation seen in CPP. Treatment options for familial male-limited precocious puberty and McCune-Albright syndrome are expanding as well, although data are preliminary. Long-term outcome studies of CPP indicate overall good menstrual and reproductive function, but the prevalence of polycystic ovary syndrome may be higher than in the general population. Remarkably few studies have evaluated the behavioral and psychological outcomes of precocious puberty, in contrast to early normal maturation. Additional outcome studies of endocrine, metabolic, and psychological effects of CPP are clearly needed."
CD008018,0,28398024,0,Gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced premature ovarian failure in breast cancer patients.,"Since the survival of patients with cancer has significantly improved, chemotherapy-related premature ovarian failure (POF) in young cancer survivors has become a major issue in oncology. POF is associated with several health-related negative consequences, including menopausal symptoms, increased risk of cardiovascular diseases, osteoporosis, sexual dysfunction, and infertility. According to the major international guidelines, embryo/oocyte cryopreservation are the standard procedures for fertility preservation in young cancer women. However, these techniques do not protect the whole ovarian function from the gonadotoxicity of anticancer therapies; indeed, they can only preserve fertility without preventing POF and related side effects. In recent years, temporary ovarian suppression during chemotherapy with lutenising hormone-releasing hormone analogues (LHRHa) has emerged as an option to preserve both gonadal function and fertility. Despite temporary ovarian suppression with LHRHa showed to be an effective strategy to reduce the risk of treatment-related POF in several randomized clinical trials, its use as a standard procedure is still under debate. The present review will encompass the current evidences and controversies on the efficacy and safety of ovarian protection with LHRHa during chemotherapy for preservation of ovarian function and fertility in breast cancer patients, in light of the new data published."

CD008018,0,21919808,0,Fertility sparing in cancer patients.,"Infertility can arise as a consequence of treatment of oncological conditions. As cancer survival rates continue to improve, many women will face infertility after successful treatment of their malignant diseases. This review summarizes the current state of different fertility preservation options in these patients. This review will discuss the premature ovarian failure and other adverse reproductive outcomes in female patients who receive chemotherapy and radiation. In addition, cancer-specific fertility preservation methods are presented. Embryo cryopreservation is a well established technique to preserve fertility. However, it requires delaying cancer treatment for two to six weeks and a partner or willingness to use donor sperm. When these criteria cannot be met, more experimental options include oocyte cryopreservation for later IVF and ovarian tissue cryopreservation. In-vitro maturation is a promising technology and can be applied in combination with oocyte or ovarian tissue cryopreservation. Ovarian transposition remains the standard option for women undergoing pelvic radiation. Lastly, the efficacy of GnRH analoga in ovarian protection during chemotherapy has still not been proved. As fertility preservation choices include both established and experimental methods, a highly individualized approach is required in the management of patients looking for fertility preservation options."

CD008018,0,20943612,0,Prevention and treatment of side-effects of systemic treatment: bone loss.,"Cancer treatment-induced bone loss (CTIBL) is generally more rapid and severe than bone loss associated with menopause in women or ageing in men and women. In premenopausal women with breast cancer, CTIBL is mainly caused by chemotherapy with resultant ovarian failure, by GnRH agonists or by tamoxifen. In postmenopausal women, steroidal and non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors (AIs) increase bone turnover, decrease bone mass and increase fracture rate (hazard ratio increased to 1.38-1.55 compared with tamoxifen). Zoledronic acid can prevent bone loss in premenopausal women receiving adjuvant therapy with goserelin in combination with either anastrozole or tamoxifen and in postmenopausal women receiving AIs. Denosumab has been shown in a placebo-controlled study to significantly increase bone mineral density in postmenopausal women under AIs. More limited studies indicate that oral bisphosphonates used at licensed doses for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis can also prevent AI-induced bone loss. In prostate cancer, bone loss that occurs with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) also leads to an increased fracture rate. The bisphosphonates pamidronate and alendronate can prevent bone loss whereas zoledronic acid can increase bone mass under ADT. As for breast cancer, delay in bisphosphonate therapy is detrimental to bone health. The protective effects of denosumab on bone loss and incidental vertebral fractures have been demonstrated in a 3-year placebo-controlled trial."

CD008018,0,22281514,0,Chemotherapy and fertility.,"The overall increase in cancer prevalence and the significant increase in long-term survival have generated worldwide interest in preserving fertility in young women exposed to gonadotoxic chemo- and radiotherapy. Infertility represents one of the main long-term consequences of combination chemotherapy given for lymphoma, leukaemia and other malignancies in young women. The gonadotoxic effect of various chemotherapeutic agents is diverse, may involve a variety of pathophysiologic mechanisms, and is not unequivocally understood. Proliferating cells, such as in tissues with high turnover (i.e. bone marrow, gastrointestinal tract and growing ovarian follicles) are more vulnerable to the toxic effect of alkylating agents. These agents may also be cytotoxic to cells at rest, as they are not cell-cycle specific. Alkylating agents, the most gonadotoxic chemotherapeutic medications, cause dose-dependent, direct destruction of oocytes and follicular depletion, and may bring about cortical fibrosis and ovarian blood-vessel damage. The reported rate of premature ovarian failure after various diseases and chemotherapeutic protocols differ enormously, and depend mainly on the chemotherapeutic protocol used and age range of the woman. Several options have been proposed for preserving female fertility, despite gonadotoxic chemotherapy: ovarian transposition, cryopreservation of embryos, unfertilised metaphase-II oocytes and ovarian tissue, and administration of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonistic analogs in an attempt to decrease the gonadotoxic effects of chemotherapy by simulating a prepubertal hormonal milieu. None of these methods is ideal and none guarantees future fertility in all survivors; therefore, a combination of methods is recommended for maximising women's chances of future fertility."

Administration of hypothalamic hormones can mimic hypophysectomy and gonadectomy, and is essentially devoid of side effects. A successful use of agonistic analogs of LH-RH for treatment of endocrine-dependent prostate cancer has been documented in several hundred patients. Experimental studies suggest that agonists and/or antagonists of LH-RH might be useful for treatment of breast cancer and pituitary tumors. Our work in animal models also indicates that analogs of somatostatin, alone or combined with LH-RH agonists, could be considered for therapy of chondrosarcomas, osteosarcomas, and pancreatic cancer. Experiments are in progress on the use of LH-RH analogs for treatment of ovarian cancer, neoplasms of the female genital tract, and for protection against gonadal damage during chemotherapy. These investigations should extend the concepts of endocrine treatment of cancers."
CD008018,0,16222310,0,Phase II trial of tamoxifen and goserelin in recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer.,"Endocrine therapy is a recognised option in the treatment of chemo-resistant ovarian cancer. We conducted a nonrandomised phase II evaluation of combination endocrine therapy with tamoxifen and goserelin in patients with advanced ovarian cancer that had recurred following chemotherapy. In total, 26 patients entered the study, of which 17 had platinum-resistant disease. The median age was 63 years and enrolled patients had received a median of three chemotherapy regimens prior to trial entry. Patients were given oral tamoxifen 20 mg twice daily on a continuous basis and subcutaneous goserelin 3.6 mg once a month until disease progression. Using the definition of endocrine response that included patients with stable disease (SD) of 6 months or greater, the overall response rate (clinical benefit rate) was 50%. This included one complete response (CR) (3.8%), two partial responses (PR) (7.7%) and 10 patients with SD (38.5%). The median progression-free interval (PFI) was 4 months (95% CI 2.4-9.6) while the median overall survival (OS) was 13.6 months (95% CI 5.5-30.6). Four patients received treatment for more than 2 years (range 1-31) and one of them is still on treatment. In none of the four patients was there any evidence of recurrent or cumulative treatment related toxicity. Treatment-limiting toxicity was not seen in any of the study population. Endocrine data demonstrated a marked suppression of luteinising hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) to less than 4% of baseline values. No consistent correlation could be established between LH/FSH suppression and tumour response. Likewise no relationship was observed between Inhibin A/B and pro-alpha C levels and tumour response. Inhibin is unlikely to be a useful surrogate marker for response in locally advanced or metastatic ovarian cancer. Combination endocrine therapy with tamoxifen and goserelin is an active regimen in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer patients. Hormonal therapy is advantageous in its relative lack of toxicity, ease of administration and tolerability, thus making it suitable for patients with heavily pretreated disease, compromised bone marrow function and other comorbid conditions that contraindicate cytotoxic therapy as well as in patients with indolent disease."

Ten premenopausal women with infertility and intramural-submucous myoma manifesting with menorrhagia and obstruction of the tubal ostia were recruited for this study. A long-acting depot GnRH-a, Decapeptyl, was given intramuscularly every four weeks for three months as an adjunct prior to myomectomy. Luteinizing hormone, follicular stimulating hormone and estradiol declined to the menopausal range following treatment. The size of the myoma decreased to a mean of 32.3 +/- 13.3% of the original volume. Myomectomy was performed in eight patients at the end of the study. Remarkably little blood loss was observed during the surgery. All of the patients had their uteri preserved, and six out of eight patients achieved pregnancy within 12 months after surgery. Our results indicate that monthly administration of long-acting GnRH-a significantly reduces the myoma volume and makes myomectomy technically easier to perform with the possibility of reduced complication rates and better preservation of future fertility."

CD008018,0,17913663,0,Controversies of adjuvant endocrine treatment for breast cancer and recommendations of the 2007 St Gallen conference.,"Endocrine treatment for breast cancer was introduced more than a century ago. The discovery of hormone receptors has allowed targeting of endocrine treatment to patients whose primary tumours express these receptors. In the adjuvant setting, different approaches are used in premenopausal or postmenopausal women. In premenopausal patients, suppression of ovarian function and the use of tamoxifen are the most important therapeutic options, even though questions on timing, duration, and combination of these compounds remain unanswered. The use of aromatase inhibitors in combination with ovarian-function suppression is currently under investigation in the premenopausal setting. In postmenopausal patients, aromatase inhibitors given after 2-3 years or 5 years of tamoxifen have shown a significant benefit over tamoxifen alone. However, questions on this treatment also remain unanswered. For example, whether all patients should receive an aromatase inhibitor or whether some subgroups of patients might be optimally treated by tamoxifen alone is yet to be established.

Despite being pretreated with GnRH agonist and without withholding gonadotropins, serum E2 decreased by 49.5% and 41.0% of pretreatment values (long luteal and microdose flare, respectively) after initiation of ganirelix, and 68.1% of the patients became pregnant."
CD008018,0,11276454,0,Current therapy of catamenial pneumothorax.,"Catamenial pneumothorax, or monthly recurring pneumothorax associated with menstruation, has been reported with increasing frequency in recent years. A representative case illustrates the clinical syndrome, particularly the intraoperative findings. Characteristic of this disorder are a peak incidence in the late twenties or early thirties, recurrent right-sided pneumothoraces occurring at the onset of menstruation, and an association with pelvic endometriosis. Pathologically, there is a consistent pattern of intrathoracic, especially diaphragmatic, foci of ectopic endometrial tissue. There is also a strong association with diaphragmatic fenestrations, though their significance is controversial. Traditional therapy has involved treatment with estrogens, danazol, or thoracotomy with mechanical pleurodesis. These methods have proven, through a large meta-analysis, to be associated with a relatively high rate of recurrence. Subsequent advances in hormonal therapy, along with the development of minimal access surgery, have led to an evolution in management. Despite uncertainty as to the etiology of catamenial pneumothorax, diagnosis of the condition is straightforward and modern treatment is successful in preventing recurrence."

CD008018,0,28173995,0,GnRH antagonist and letrozole co-treatment in diminished ovarian reserve patients: a proof-of-concept study.,"The current study aimed to investigate the effects of luteal gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist pretreatment on the outcomes of diminished ovarian reserve (DOR) patients who were treated using a FSH/letrozole/GnRH antagonist (FLA) protocol. Thus, patients who had luteal GnRH antagonist pretreatment (AFLA) prior to stimulation were compared to patients who had the FLA protocol, only. An electronic database was used to identify patients and stimulation characteristics. Women who had a total antral follicle count (AFC) of <7 were included in the analysis. A total of 45 cycles using luteal GnRH antagonist pretreatment in combination with a letrozole/GnRH antagonist (AFLA) protocol were compared to 76 cycles using a FLA protocol, only. The total gonadotropin dose, duration of stimulation, and peak estradiol levels were comparable between the groups (p>0.05). However, the AFLA group had significantly more metaphase-2 (MII) oocytes (p=0.009), a higher oocyte maturity rate (MII/total oocytes) (p=0.029), and a higher mature oocyte yield (MII/AFC) (p=0.020) with more cleaved embryos (p=0.036), and a significantly reduced number of canceled cycles (26.7% vs. 44.7%; p=0.048). The clinical pregnancy rate per cycle was 22.2% vs. 13.2% (p=0.195) in the AFLA and FLA groups, respectively. Interestingly, a subgroup analysis including ESHRE Bologna criteria poor responder patients showed that the luteal administration of GnRH antagonist resulted in better outcomes when compared with the FLA protocol alone. In conclusion, luteal GnRH antagonist pretreatment improves ovarian stimulation parameters and reproductive outcomes in poor ovarian reserve IVF patients."

CD008018,0,8671425,0,"The effect of human menopausal gonadotrophin and highly purified, urine-derived follicle stimulating hormone on the outcome of in-vitro fertilization in down-regulated normogonadotrophic women.","It has been suggested that the luteinizing hormone (LH) activity of human menopausal gonadotrophin (HMG) preparations used for ovarian stimulation in in-vitro fertilization (IVF) may have adverse effects on reproductive outcome. In the present prospective, randomized trial of 218 infertile couples this notion was investigated. A total of 114 women were treated with Pergonal (HMG group) and 104 with Fertinorm HP (HP-FSH group). The two groups were comparable with regard to duration of infertility, cause of infertility, age and number of previous IVF attempts and all had normal basal gonadotrophin concentrations before treatment was started. A standard hormonal treatment consisting of pituitary down-regulation with gonadotrophin-releasing hormone analogue (GnRHa) for 14 days starting on cycle day 21, followed by either HMG or highly purified follicle stimulating hormone (HP-FSH), three ampoules (225 IU) per day for 7 days, was used in all cases. The daily hormone dose was thereafter individualized according to the ovarian response. A maximum of two pre-embryos were transferred after 3 days of culture. Luteal support with progesterone (300 mg per day intravaginally) was used in all cases. Serum concentrations of oestradiol, FSH and LH were measured on days 1 and 8 of stimulation and on the day of oocyte retrieval. The mean number of days of stimulation, mean number of ampoules of HMG or HP-FSH used, mean total motile sperm count on the day of oocyte retrieval and mean numbers of oocytes retrieved (13.4 versus 13.7) or pre-embryos transferred (1.8 versus 1.8) were similar for both groups. Significantly (P < 0.05) more cycles in the HP-FSH group (17 = 16%) were cancelled due to complete failure of fertilization than in the HMG group (7 = 6%). The mean fertilization rate was significantly (P < 0.05) higher in the HMG group (56%) than in the HP-FSH group (50%), and significantly more transferable pre-embryos were obtained in the HMG than in the HP-FSH group (mean: 4.0 versus 3.2; P < 0.01). Serum hormone concentrations were similar to the two groups on stimulation day 1, but differed significantly with regard to FSH, LH and oestradiol on stimulation day 8. The clinical outcome was similar in the two groups, with an ongoing pregnancy rate (> 12 weeks of gestation) per started cycle of 33% in the HMG group and 29% in the HP-FSH group. The clinical abortion rates were similar (10 and 14%), and the implantation rate was 30% in each group. In conclusion, no detrimental effect of the LH activity of HMG on the clinical outcome of IVF in GnRHa down-regulated normogonadotrophic women was found. To the contrary, some beneficial effects of HMG on fertilization rates and pre-embryo development as compared with HP-FSH were demonstrated. These effects, as well as the differences in serum hormone concentrations during ovarian stimulation, may be caused by differences in LH content and/or in the composition of FSH isoforms of the HMG and HP-FSH preparations."
CD008018,0,28764603,0,Luteininzing hormone releasing hormones analogs in combination with tamoxifen for the adjuvant treatment of premenopausal women with hormone receptor positive breast cancer.,"The role of ovarian function suppression (OFS) through luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonists (LHRHa) in addition to tamoxifen has been questioned until recently. In 2015, two large clinical trials led to a paradigm shift in the adjuvant endocrine treatment of premenopausal women, introducing the use of LHRHa plus tamoxifen (or aromatase inhibitor, AI) into current clinical practice. Areas covered: The present review aims to provide an in-depth overview of the role of LHRHa+tamoxifen for the adjuvant treatment of premenopausal women with hormone receptor positive breast cancer (HR+BC). Expert opinion: The addition of LHRHa to endocrine treatment (either tamoxifen or AI) is effective in premenopausal women who are at high risk of relapse. To date, no clear recommendations are available for the choice between LHRHa+tamoxifen and LHRH+AI. Although recent data showed better DFS with LHRHa+AI, other issues should be considered: 1) approximately 20 out of 100 women do not reach complete OFS with LHRHa+AI; 2) there is no extended endocrine therapy option that can be applied to women who received 5 years of LHRHa+AI and remained premenopausal at the end of the fifth year. Long-term results of the SOFT-TEXT study are needed to establish if LHRHa+AI is superior to LHRHa+tamoxifen."

CD008018,0,15927827,0,Systematic review of LHRH agonists for the adjuvant treatment of early breast cancer.,"There is increasing use of luteinising hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists in the adjuvant treatment of breast cancer (J. Clin. Oncol. 19(2) (2001) 343). However, few mature studies are available and there is uncertainty regarding the optimal use of these agents. We performed a systematic review to address the role of LHRH agonists in the adjuvant treatment of pre-menopausal women with early breast cancer. As ovarian suppression is unlikely to benefit women with ER-negative tumours, the review is limited to women with ER-positive disease. The objectives of this review were to address the following issues; the role of LHRH agonists compared to tamoxifen (TAM), LHRH agonists in place of chemotherapy and LHRH agonists integrated into chemo-hormonal regimens. We identified 11 randomised trials. In three trials, adjuvant suppression of ovarian function using LHRH agonists, with or without TAM, had similar benefits at 5-6 years follow-up in terms of disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) to adjuvant CMF chemotherapy (J. Clin. Oncol 20(24) (2002) 4628; J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 95(24) (2003) 1833; Anticancer Res. 22 (2002) 2325; In: San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium, San Antonio, TX, 2003, Abstr 40). These findings suggest that ovarian suppression using LHRH agonists (+/-TAM) is a reasonable alternative to CMF chemotherapy in women with oestrogen receptor (ER) positive tumours. The role of chemotherapy in addition to LHRH agonists is not clearly defined and mature results of four trials are awaited (J. Clin. Oncol. 20(24) (2002) 4621; J. Clin. Oncol. 18(14) (2000) 2718; Proc. Am. Soc. Clin. Oncol. 2000, Abstr 279; Proc. Am. Soc. Clin. Oncol. 20 (2001) Abstr 104; Proc. Am. Soc. Clin. Oncol. 2001, Abstr. 1777). Data is also inadequate at the time of publication to inform decisions about the efficacy of LHRH agonists in comparison with TAM for the treatment of ER-positive early breast cancer (Proc. Am. Soc. Clin. Oncol. 21 (2001) Abstr. 103; Eur. J. Surg. Oncol. 28(5) (2002) 505; Proc. Am. Soc. Clin. Oncol. 22 (2003), Abstr. 15)."

CD008018,0,22284634,0,Adjuvant therapy with GnRH agonists/tamoxifen in breast cancer should be a good council for patients with hormone receptor-positive tumours and wish to preserve fertility.,"Infertility represents one of the main long-term consequences of the chemotherapy used for the adjuvant treatment of breast cancer. Approximately 60-65% of breast cancers express the nuclear hormone receptor in premenopausal women. Adjuvant endocrine therapy is an integral component of care for patients with hormone receptor-positive (HR+) tumours. The GnRH agonist (GnRHa) alone or in combination with tamoxifen produces results at least similar to those obtained with the different chemotherapy protocols in patients with HR+ breast cancer with respect to recurrence-free survival and overall survival. It is time to indicate adjuvant therapy with GnRHa associated with tamoxifen for patients with breast cancer (HR+ tumours) if they want to preserve their reproductive function. The evaluation of ovarian reserve tests: follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH), inhibin B, antral follicle count (AFC) and ovarian volume 6 months, and 1 year after the end of therapy with GnRHa/tamoxifen must be realised. The recurrence-free survival and overall survival should be analysed. The major implication of this hypothesis will be to avoid adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with breast cancer (HR+ tumours) that request fertility preservation. It is expected that ovarian function should not be altered in almost all cases and subsequent pregnancy a real possibility."

Following surgical treatment, 64 premenopausal patients with early breast cancer received goserelin 3.6 mg (every 28 days for 1 year) and an adjuvant treatment which was chosen according to the patient's prognosis. Median age was 42 years (range 27-50). ECOG performance status was 0-1 in all patients. Twenty-eight patients (44%) had estrogen receptor (ER)+ tumors and 36 (56%) patients had ER- tumors. Fifty-two (81%) patients had stage II disease and 12 (19%) had stage III disease. Eighteen patients received cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil chemotherapy, 46 patients received an anthracycline-based regimen, and nine of them received high-dose chemotherapy and autologous peripheral blood progenitor cell transplantation. Fifty-one patients (80%) were irradiated. ER+ patients also received tamoxifen for 5 years. Serum estradiol was suppressed to values below 40 pg/ml in all patients.

During GnRHa alone and with hormone treatment, we compared AVP and body fluid regulatory responses to 3% NaCl infusion (HSI, 120 min, 0.1 ml. min(-1). kg body wt(-1)), drinking (30 min, 15 ml/kg body wt), and recovery (60 min of seated rest). Plasma [E(2)] increased from 23.9 to 275.3 pg/ml with hormone treatments. Plasma [P(4)] increased from 0.6 to 5.7 ng/ml during E/P and was unchanged (0.4 to 0.6 ng/ml) during E. Compared with GnRHa alone, E reduced osmotic AVP release threshold (275 +/- 4 to 271 +/- 4 mosmol/kg, P < 0.05), and E/P reduced the AVP increase in response during HSI (6.0 +/- 1.3 to 4.2 +/- 0.6 pg/ml at the end of HSI), but free water clearance was unaffected in either group. Relative to GnRHa, pre-HSI plasma renin activity (PRA) was greater during E (0.8 +/- 0.1 vs. 1.2 +/- 0.2 ng ANG I. ml(-1). h(-1)) but not after HSI or recovery. PRA was greater than GnRHa during E/P at baseline (1.1 +/- 0.2 vs. 2.5 +/- 0.6) and after HSI (0.6 +/- 0.1 vs. 1.1 +/- 1.1) and recovery (0.5 +/- 0.1 vs. 1.3 +/- 0.2 ng ANG I. ml(-1). h(-1)). Baseline fractional excretion of sodium was unaffected by E or E/P but was attenuated by the end of recovery for both E (3.3 +/- 0.6 vs. 2.4 +/- 0.4%) and E/P (2.8 +/- 0.4 vs 1.7 +/- 0.4%, GnRHa alone and with hormone treatment, respectively). Fluid retention increased with both hormone treatments. Renal sensitivity to AVP may be lower during E due to intrarenal effects on water and sodium excretion. E/P increased sodium retention and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone stimulation."

CD008018,0,21699083,0,Regulation of AMH and SCF expression in human granulosa cells by GnRH agonist and antagonist.,"With the progress of cancer treatment, fertility preservation has become an urgent requisition. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRH-a) and antagonist (GnRH-ant) have been used to protect fertility for these patients. However, studies showed that although GnRH-a and GnRH-ant had a comparable down-regulating effect on the pituitary, GnRH-ant could not preserve ovarian function. Moreover, GnRH-ant alone could deplete primordial follicles. It might be speculated that an additional intraovarian system existed except the pituitary system. Anti-Müerian hormone (AMH) and Stem cell factor (SCF) proved to be the key factors in follicle recruitment and development. The balance between AMH and SCF was tightly related to ovarian reserve. To investigate the intraovarian effect of GnRH-a or GnRH-ant on ovarian reserve, we examined AMH and SCF expression in human granulosa cells (hGCs). GCs were isolated from follicular aspirates after oocyte removal from the patients undergoing assisted reproduction techniques. After pretreated with GnRH-a (triptorelin) or GnRH-ant (cetrorelix) for 48 h, mRNA and protein of AMH and SCF were analyzed by Real-time PCR and Immunoblot assay respectively. The results indicated that AMH mRNA and protein expressions were down-regulated in the GnRH-ant groups, SCF mRNA and protein expressions were up-regulated in the high-dose GnRH-ant group. There was no difference of AMH and SCF expression in the GnRH-a group or GnRH-a + GnRH-ant group compared with control. These results suggested the effects of GnRH-a and GnRH-ant on the regulation of AMH and SCF were different, which may provide insight into the mechanism of GnRH-a and GnRH-ant interventions on ovarian reserve."

CD008018,0,28646567,0,Severe menses-associated hypertension successfully treated with gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist.,"A case of a 32-year-old nulliparous white woman referred for a 5-year history of severe hypertension, hypokalemia, and resultant systolic dysfunction is presented. She additionally had a left ventricular ejection fraction of 30% including left ventricular dilation and normal left ventricular mass index, as measured by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging when she initially presented to us. Her history revealed that her severe hypertension episodes were monthly and would occur around the catamenial (menses-associated) time. Two weeks following her menses, blood pressure decreased significantly but remained elevated above 140/90 mm Hg. This cycle repeated monthly and required multiple hospitalizations for hypertensive emergency in the form of acute decompensated heart failure and severe headaches. She required potassium supplementation. This prompted a complete evaluation for secondary causes of hypertension, which was negative. Female and male sex hormone levels, including testosterone, were also within normal limits. She received an injection of leuprolide acetate depot (11.25 mg every 3 months), a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist. This significantly reduced the magnitude of these episodes."
CD008018,0,3125071,0,The effect of leuprolide acetate in aiding induction of ovulation in hypergonadotropic hypogonadism: a case report.,"A 43-year-old woman with a history of 5 years of amenorrhea sought help in achieving a pregnancy. Her gonadotropins were found to be elevated and thus she was diagnosed as having ovarian failure. She was made to ovulate on many occasions by suppressing her gonadotropins first with estrogen, then stimulating her ovaries with hMG. However, she became refractory to this therapy and she was switched from estrogen to LA to suppress gonadotropins. The woman ovulated three times just with leuprolide therapy before any hMG was added. A possible hypothesis is that, on the way down to subnormal levels of LH and FSH, a critical level of gonadotropins was attained where they were still high enough to stimulate the follicles, but low enough to allow restoration of gonadotropin receptors, which previously had been down-regulated by the elevated gonadotropin levels."
CD008018,0,12538505,0,Adjuvant hormonal therapy for premenopausal women with breast cancer.,"Hormonal manipulation has been used for over 100 years to treat breast cancer. Ovarian ablation/suppression and tamoxifen are currently accepted adjuvant endocrine therapies for premenopausal breast cancer. Methods of permanently ablating ovarian function include surgical oophorectomy and radiation-induced ovarian failure; medical castration with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogues is a reversible approach. Adjuvant chemotherapy frequently results in permanent amenorrhea and thus represents an indirect form of ovarian ablation. Although early randomized trials of ovarian ablation suffered from small sample sizes and design flaws, a meta-analysis of their results through the Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group demonstrated a clear benefit from ovarian ablation as a single intervention in the adjuvant treatment of women less than 50 years of age with breast cancer. The Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group meta-analysis also demonstrated the efficacy of 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen as a single treatment modality, regardless of age. Even with these improvements in disease-free and overall survival, several important questions remain unanswered. The relative efficacy of adjuvant chemotherapy versus ovarian ablation/suppression has not been strictly defined. However, the data suggest that the clinical benefit of either chemotherapy or ovarian ablation/suppression and 5 years of tamoxifen is similar. Thus, ovarian ablation/suppression combined with tamoxifen is a reasonable alternative to chemotherapy for some women with good-risk early-stage breast cancer (high hormone receptor expression, low-grade or lymph node-negative disease), particularly those wishing to preserve fertility. The value of combining ovarian ablation/suppression with chemotherapy, other endocrine therapy, or both and ameliorating the long-term morbidity of estrogen deprivation remain important areas for investigation. With the advent of multiple targeted endocrine therapies with distinct mechanisms of action, there is a unique opportunity to design highly informative clinical trials that can define the optimal combinations and sequencing of hormonal therapies in the treatment of early-stage breast cancer."
CD008018,0,28796038,0,Clomiphene citrate is associated with favorable cycle characteristics but impaired outcomes of obese women with polycystic ovarian syndrome undergoing ovarian stimulation for in vitro fertilization.,"The aim of this study was to explore the effect of clomiphene citrate (CC) on the cycle characteristics and outcomes of obese women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) undergoing ovarian stimulation for in vitro fertilization (IVF).This is a retrospective cohort study, and it was conducted at the tertiary-care academic medical center.This study included 174 obese PCOS patients undergoing IVF.In the study group (n = 90), CC and human menopausal gonadotropin (HMG) were administered simultaneously beginning on cycle day 3, while in control group (n = 84) HMG was used only. Both of the 2 groups used medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) for preventing premature luteinizing hormone (LH) surges. Ovulation was cotriggered by a GnRH agonist and hCG when dominant follicles matured.The primary outcome measure was the number of oocytes retrieved. Secondary outcomes included the number of top-quality embryos, maturation rate, fertilization rate, cleavage rate, incidence of premature LH surge, and OHSS.The study group received obviously lower total HMG dose [1650 (975-4800) vs 2025 (1350-3300) IU, P = 2.038E-4] but similar HMG duration. While the antral follicle count (AFC) is higher in study group, the number of oocytes retrieved and top-quality embryos are remarkably less [5 (0-30) vs 13 (0-42), P = 6.333E-5; 2 (0-14) vs 3.5 (0-15), P = .003; respectively]. The mature oocyte rate is higher in study group (P = .036). No significant differences were detected in fertilization rate and cleavage rate between 2 groups.CC has a positive influence on cycle characteristics, but might be correlated with the impaired IVF outcomes (less oocytes retrieved and top quality embryos, lower oocyte retrieval rate) in obese PCOS patients undergoing IVF, when HMG and MPA are used simultaneously."

These results are important because danazol is associated with a significant number of side effects, particularly androgenic effects, such as weight gain and acne. Although gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists are associated with hypoestrogenic side effects, such as hot flashes and reversible bone density loss, recent studies suggest that the risk of these side effects may be modified when gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists are combined with a progestin. These findings suggest that such regimens may further enhance the clinical usefulness of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist therapy for endometriosis and other estrogen-mediated diseases."

CD008018,0,3937850,0,[Induction of ovulation in 1985].,"There are many methods that can be used to induce ovulation when there is a fault in ovulation in patients who have normal prolactin levels. These are: Bringing the weight to a normal level. Giving Clomiphene. Giving Tamoxifen. Giving cyclofenil and bromocriptine, which really have no more effect than giving a placebo. Giving gonadotrophins in a classical way. This is very useful where there is hypogonadic amenorrhoea but much less useful when the failure of ovulation occurs with normal gonadic function. It is accompanied by a risk of multiple pregnancies and of hyperstimulation, which should be monitored by ultrasound very strictly so that it cannot become too serious. The use of purified FSH which theoretically should be more adequate, at least in cases where the gonadic function is normal in spite of failure of ovulation. Pulsatile administration of LHRH, which in cases of hypothalamic amenorrhoea carries less total risk than giving gonadotrophins. Finally, wedge resection of the ovaries which is reversed for polycystic ovaries that are larger than normal in size, and allied methods. The first choice for hypogonadic hypothalamic amenorrhoea would seem to be the LHRH pump; and for failure of ovulation with normal gonadic function Clomiphene or Tamoxifen. When anti-oestrogens fail to correct these latter cases one can choose according to the case between gonadotrophins, choosing if possible pure FSH, and/or wedge resection. In the last resort in these cases the LHRH pump can be used. The frequent failure of these methods show that perhaps it is possible to create a hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism by giving agonists for a long time or antagonists to LHRH in such a way that a second attempt can be made to induce ovulation using gonadotrophins in better conditions of efficacy and safety."

CD008018,0,17914074,0,"How to preserve fertility in young women exposed to chemotherapy? The role of GnRH agonist cotreatment in addition to cryopreservation of embrya, oocytes, or ovaries.","The possibilities to preserve fertility in women exposed to chemotherapy are: in vitro fertilization plus embryo cryopreservation, ovarian cryopreservation, unfertilized ova cryopreservation, and the administration of a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist. Because none of these methods is ideal, combination of several methods should be considered. Because the chances of preserving gonadal function following combined-modality treatment are significantly better for girls than for boys, simulation of a prepubertal milieu was applied only to women of reproductive age. The administration of GnRH agonists to women with Hodgkin's disease, breast cancer, and other malignancies, or to patients with lupus nephropathy, in parallel with chemotherapy, by others and by us, has demonstrated a significantly lower rate of premature ovarian failure in survivors than in nonrandomized controls. Several prospective, randomized studies are ongoing. A recent meta-analysis found that the administration of a GnRH agonist, in addition to chemotherapy, to patients with breast cancer was associated with less recurrence and superior survival. Several possibilities to explain the beneficial effect of GnRH agonists to minimize chemotherapy-associated gonadotoxicity are suggested: (a) The hypogonadotropic milieu decreases the number of primordial follicles entering the differentiation stage, which is more vulnerable to chemotherapy; (b) The hypoestrogenic state decreases ovarian perfusion and delivery of chemotherapy to the ovaries; (c) A direct effect of the GnRH agonist on the ovary occurs independently of the gonadotropin level; (d) GnRH agonists may upregulate an intragonadal antiapoptotic molecule such as sphingosine-1-phosphate; (e) The GnRH agonist may protect ovarian germline stem cells."

CD008018,0,26626234,0,Treatment strategies for the infertile polycystic ovary syndrome patient.,"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disorder in women of reproductive age. Infertility is a prevalent presenting feature of PCOS, and approximately 75% of these women suffer infertility due to anovulation. Lifestyle modification is considered the first-line treatment and is associated with improved endocrine profile. Clomiphene citrate (CC) should be considered as the first line pharmacologic therapy for ovulation induction. In women who are CC resistant, second-line treatment should be considered, as adding metformin, laparoscopic ovarian drilling or treatment with gonadotropins. In CC treatment failure, Letrozole could be an alternative or treatment with gonadotropins. IVF is considered the third-line treatment; the 'short', antagonist-based protocol is the preferred option for PCOS patients, as it is associated with lower risk of developing ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (specifically by using a gonadotropin--releasing hormone agonist as ovulation trigger), but with comparable outcomes as the long protocol."

GnRH analogues are also the preferred treatment for advanced and even metastatic or recurred carcinomas originated from the reproductive tract. The original rationale for a GnRH analogue in the treatment was to block the endogenous gonadotropin and thereby steroid hormone secretion which was thought to stimulate tumor growth. However, more than 80% of ovarian and endometrial cancers express receptors for GnRH, and the analogues inhibit proliferation of the GnRH receptor-bearing tumor cells both in vivo and in vitro, supporting evidence for a direct antiproliferative effect. These receptors could be used for targeted chemotherapy (by tumoricidal agents linked to GnRH analogues) to improve antitumor effects and reduce side effects compared with conventional systemic chemotherapy. In addition to the anticancer action, GnRH analogues act to protect the gonads during radiation and/or chemotherapy by preferentially steering cells into cell cycle arrest with a decline in responsibility to the chemotherapy and radiation. In women who wish to maintain potential fertility, GnRH analogue therapy is successful in preventing the most critical postoperative complication, adhesion formation. The additional unrecognized benefits may add to the advantage of GnRH analogues in cancer management in gynecology."
CD008018,0,1674933,0,Ovarian stimulation concomitant with pituitary-ovarian axis suppression by different GnRH agonists.,"The present study compared the effect of gonadotropin therapy alone with a combination of gonadotropins and GnRH agonist on ovarian stimulation in anovulatory women and in spontaneously ovulating patients in an IVF program. Nineteen infertile patients were treated with combined GnRH agonist/gonadotropin therapy for induction of ovulation. Ten women received combined therapy for ovarian stimulation in the framework of an IVF-ET program. Twenty-one additional patients served as controls, receiving gonadotropins but not GnRH agonist for induction of ovulation or ovarian stimulation stimulation before IVF-ET. This study indicates that the GnRH agonists Buserelin, Decapeptyl, and Decapeptyl CR are similarly effective in their ability to down-regulate pituitary-ovarian axis function. The suppressive effect occurred by 14 days in 77% of the patients, and never required more than 28 days. Stimulation of ovarian function, when carried out in the presence of a suppressed pituitary-ovarian axis, required an increased dose of exogenous gonadotropins (26.4 vs. 16.5 ampules). Our data do not support the view that GnRH analogs can aid in the synchronization process of oocyte maturation."

Current options for medical treatment include control of estradiol and progesterone production or action and are discussed in this review. Although curative treatment of fibroids relies on surgical strategies, the current trend is for uterine-sparing treatment to preserve fertility and avoid unnecessary surgery. Currently approved medical treatments include intrauterine progestin delivery to reduce uterine bleeding, GnRH analogues, and, more recently, selective progesterone receptor modulators to control uterine bleeding and reduce fibroid volume."
CD008018,0,22764552,0,A comprehensive approach to the spectrum of abnormal pubertal development.,"Puberty is the biological transition from childhood to adulthood. The process involves the coordination of hormonal, physical, psychosocial, and cognitive systems to result in physiologic change. Precocious puberty is defined as pubertal development beginning earlier than expected based on normal standards. Gonadotropin dependent precocious puberty is caused by premature activation of the hypothalamus resulting in pulsatile secretion of GnRH. Gonadotropin independent precocious puberty is caused by excess sex hormones from peripheral or external sources. Treatment with GnRH agonists should be offered to prevent early fusion of the epiphyseal plates to avoid unnecessary short stature and should not be based on perceived psychosocial consequences of early puberty. Delayed puberty is the absence of or incomplete development of secondary sexual characteristics. Hypergonadotropic hypogonadism or primary hypogonadism may result from genetic mutation syndromes or can be acquired from antiovarian antibodies, exposure to radiation or chemotherapy, inflammatory insult, or surgical removal of the gonads. Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism or secondary hypogonadism is due to hypothalamic dysfunction resulting in impaired secretion of GnRH. The long-term goal for patients with inadequate estrogen stimulation is to maintain the serum concentration of sex steroids within the normal adult range to promote the development of secondary sexual characteristics, prevent premature bone loss, and ultimately to induce fertility when indicated."

Nineteen men were studied before they received chemotherapy. Fifteen of the 19 had a sperm count of 20 million/ml or greater and motility was at least 40% in all 15. In the remaining 74 men, gonadal function was studied after completion of chemotherapy (6 months--8 years). Semen was obtained from 49 men who had received six of more courses of MVPP. Forty-two were azoospermic and five of the remaining seven had a sperm count below 1 million/ml. Decreased libido and sexual activity was common during treatment but in the majority of men these returned to normal after completion of chemotherapy. The median FSH and LH levels and the median increments in serum FSH and LH levels after LHRH administration were significantly elevated compared with an age-matched control group. The mean testosterone level of the patients was significantly lower than in controls suggesting Leydig cell damage but androgen replacement therapy was not indicated in any individual patient. No evidence of hyperprolactinaemia as a result of MVPP therapy was found. These results suggest that sperm storage before chemotherapy represents the main possibility for these patients to have children after completing chemotherapy. Before starting chemotherapy, advice should be given to these patients concerning possible changes in sexual behavior during treatment and the very high incidence of permanent infertility following treatment."

E(2)/P support, compared with low-dose hCG, induced a shorter luteal phase (11.2 ± 1.1 vs. 15.0 ± 1.6 days) and fewer subjective complaints (0 vs. 42%), whereas hCG caused more free fluid accumulation and enlarged ovaries than E(2)/P alone.

Normo-ovulatory women (n = 74) undergoing ovarian stimulation prior to intracytoplasmic sperm injection were treated with leuprolide acetate (n = 25) before ovarian stimulation with recombinant human FSH (r-hFSH) or with cetrorelix 3 mg on stimulation day 7 (with (n = 25) or without (n = 24) r-hLH 150 IU on days 7-10). The main outcome measures were the number of metaphase II (MII) oocytes retrieved; secondary efficacy end-points; adverse events (AE) and other safety measures. There were no significant differences between groups for MII oocytes retrieved, duration of stimulation, total r-hFSH dose and pregnancy rates. The group treated with cetrorelix alone had a significantly lower concentration of oestradiol per follicle compared with the other groups. The majority of AE were mild to moderate in severity. Cetrorelix and leuprolide acetate appear to have comparable efficacy and safety, although cetrorelix has the advantage of typically requiring only one injection."

CD008018,0,2570764,0,Monthly administration of the LH-RH analogue decapeptyl for long-term treatment of ovarian dysfunctions and estrogen-dependent disorders.,"The ovarian function of 11 patients suffering from estrogen-dependent disorders and ovarian dysfunction was suppressed by monthly administrations of an analogue of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH). During the initial 11 to 18 days of treatment, the LH-RH analogue Decapeptyl was subcutaneously injected daily, followed by intramuscular administration of the peptide encapsulated in biodegradable microspheres at 30-day intervals over a 13- to 35-week period. After an initial increase on day 1 of treatment, serum levels of both LH and FSH declined, but did not reach hypogonadotropic values. The pituitary response in the release of both LH and FSH by a LH-RH bolus injection was almost completely suppressed during the treatment course. 17 beta-Estradiol serum levels decreased into the castration range within 9.1 +/- 4 days and remained low in 92% of the values estimated. In one patient, pretreatment mean testosterone levels on the order of 1.9 ng/mL were suppressed to normal within 14 days and remained low under therapy. Seven out of the 11 patients benefited from this therapy. In conclusion, the treatment with Decapeptyl in a slow-release formulation is an effective and suitable approach for the long-term suppression of ovarian function in estrogen-dependent disorders and ovarian dysfunctions."
CD008018,0,16757104,0,Long-term GnRH agonist treatment for female central precocious puberty does not impair reproductive function.,"Depot gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist (GnRHa) therapy is the treatment of choice for patients with central precocious puberty (CPP). It is still unclear whether long-term exposure to GnRHa is associated with impaired reproductive function in adulthood. The present study was performed on 46 women, former CPP patients, 12.5+/-3.7 years after the discontinuation of treatment with depot GnRHa. In a structured interview, we assessed general health status, clinical signs possibly associated with hyperandrogenism, menstrual cycle, gynaecological diseases and reproductive function. It appears that long-term treatment with depot GnRHa is safe and does not impair reproductive function. The risk of former CPP patients to develop hirsutism and/or polycystic ovary syndrome does not seem to be increased compared to the normal population but this issue needs to be addressed in further long-term follow-up studies."
CD008018,0,8671156,0,Short term pituitary desensitization: effects of different doses of the gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonist triptorelin.,"Gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRHa) are used to prevent inadequate luteinizing hormone (LH) surges during ovarian stimulation in in-vitro fertilization (IVF). Dose studies for optimal dose assessment are lacking and unfavourable effects of the agonist on granulosa function and oocyte quality have been suggested. This double-blind randomized study was undertaken to assess the effect of four different doses to triptorelin on the degree of desensitization of the pituitary, and the recovery time of pituitary function after withdrawal of the agonist. Sixty-six regularly cycling women were allocated to a treatment group (n = 32) and a control group (n = 34). To assess the degree of pituitary desensitization and restoration in the treatment group, gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) challenges (100 microg, i.v.) were performed during treatment (day 17), and 2, 4 and 6 days after discontinuation of treatment. At the same time blood samples for oestradiol and triptorelin concentrations were drawn. In the control group a GnRH test was performed on day 2 of the menstrual cycle. Both pituitary desensitization during and pituitary recovery after agonist treatment, expressed as the LH response to exogenous GnRH, appeared to be dose dependent. As the use of reduced dosages still offers a considerable degree of pituitary suppression, studies on dose adjustments in the use of triptorelin, in ovarian stimulation in IVF are warranted."
CD008018,0,29312996,0,The Rising Phoenix-Progesterone as the Main Target of the Medical Therapy for Leiomyoma.,"Leiomyomas, also known as uterine fibroids, are a common benign tumor in women of reproductive age. These lesions disrupt the function of the uterus causing menorrhagia and pelvic pressure as well as reproductive disorders. These women pose a true challenge for clinicians in the attempt of choosing the suitable treatment for each patient. Patient's age, interest in fertility preservation, and leiomyoma location and size are all factors to be taken into account when deciding upon the preferable therapeutic option. For the past few decades, surgical treatment was the only reliable long-term treatment available. A variety of surgical approaches have been developed over the years but these developments have come at the expense of other treatment options. The classical medical treatment includes gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists and antagonists. These agents are well known for their limited clinical effect as well as their broad spectrum of side effects, inspiring a need for new pharmacological treatments. In recent years, promising results have been reported with the use of selective progesterone receptor modulators (SPRM). Long-term clinical trials have shown a reduction in bleeding and shrinkage of leiomyoma mass. These results instill hope for women suffering from symptomatic leiomyomas seeking an effective, long-term medical option for their condition."

CD008018,0,9359638,0,Direct intraperitoneal insemination compared to intrauterine insemination in superovulated cycles: a randomized cross-over study.,"The aim of this randomized cross-over study was to determine whether direct intraperitoneal insemination (DIPI) is superior to intrauterine insemination (IUI) in hyperstimulated cycles. The treatment cycles were stimulated with either clomiphene citrate and human menopausal gonadotrophins, or buserelin and human menopausal gonadotrophins. 207 subfertile couples with a cervical factor, a male factor, a combined cervical and male factor, or an unexplained subfertility were randomly assigned to the first treatment cycle. IUI and DIPI were performed in alternate cycles to a maximum of 6 cycles per couple. Every treatment cycle was followed by a nontreatment cycle. The pregnancy rate per completed cycle was 24% for IUI and 16% for DIPI (p = 0.018), whereas the cumulative pregnancy rates for IUI and DIPI were 53 and 40%, respectively (p = 0.002). There were no significant differences between pregnancy rates for IUI and DIPI in the different categories of subfertility. We conclude that DIPI does not offer better pregnancy chances than IUI in superovulated cycles."
CD008018,0,10573250,0,Gonadotrophin-releasing hormone analogues: a novel treatment for premenstrual asthma.,"Premenstrual exacerbation of asthma, as reflected by a reduction in peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), has been demonstrated in 40-100% of female asthmatics. Epidemiological data demonstrate that admission to hospital with an exacerbation of asthma occurs more frequently perimenstrually. Therapeutic interventions aimed at modifying this precipitating factor, however, remain limited. We report on a 32-yr old female with asthma in whom a marked increase in symptoms and reduction in PEFR occurred premenstrually, necessitating recurrent admissions to hospital. Frequent severe exacerbations resulted in the chronic use of oral maintenance corticosteroids. In order to suppress gonadotrophin secretion and ovarian function, a long-acting gonadotrophin-releasing hormone analogue was administered with a view to inducing a reversible menopause. This resulted in improvement in respiratory symptoms, the absence of PEFR dips premenstrually, a reduction in maintenance prednisolone dosage and no further hospital admissions during a follow-up period of 14 months. The authors propose that gonadotrophin-releasing hormone-analogue therapy is a rational and innovative adjuvant treatment worthy of further study in cases of severe premenstrual asthma."
CD008018,0,8253919,0,The choice of treatment for anovulation associated with polycystic ovary syndrome following failure to conceive with clomiphene.,"The choice of treatment for clomiphene-resistant anovulation associated with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is presently arbitrary and selection criteria are not available. A total of 144 women with anovulatory infertility associated with PCOS who failed to conceive on clomiphene were treated with either pure follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) (n = 29), or human menopausal gonadotrophin (HMG) (n = 60), or gonadotrophin-releasing hormone analogue (GnRHa) and HMG (n = 55). Analysis of 306 treatment cycles and 53 pregnancies revealed a cumulative conception rate at 4 months of 23% with FSH, 47% with HMG and 69% with GnRHa + HMG. The miscarriage rate was highest in the HMG group (44%) and consequently the cumulative live birth rate was superior when GnRHa was used in combination with HMG. There were no significant differences in the basal clinical and endocrinological features of those who conceived compared with those who did not, either in the whole group, or in the individual treatment groups. Thus, the choice of treatment for clomiphene-resistant women with PCOS cannot be guided by the basal clinical or endocrinological features of this heterogeneous syndrome with the present state or knowledge."

CD008018,0,16126441,0,[Medical preservation of ovarian function before and during radiochemotherapy].,"Intensive use of radiochemotherapy has greatly improved the prognosis associated with cancer in young women patients. However, improvement of the vital prognosis is frequently associated with impairment of fertility and premature ovarian failure. Cryopreservation of ovarian tissues has been developed but effective secondary use of cryopreserved tissue by means of autograft or through in vitro follicular maturation need yet to be clarified even though first success seemed to be recently obtained. Infant ovaries have been considered to be less sensitive than adult ovaries, which has suggested that hypophysal blockage could protect adult ovaries against fertility impairment before and during radiochemotherapy. Non-randomized studies using LHRH agonists support such a hypothesis. However what we know about physiopathology of follicular destruction involving exaggerated apoptosis and several animal models do not fit with these results. By consequence randomized studies need to be performed to verify the benefit, which one could expect from such a systematic clinical use."

CD008018,0,21545958,0,Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist in laparoscopic myomectomy: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials was performed to estimate the effects on surgical outcomes of pretreatment with gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist before laparoscopic myomectomy. The electronic bibliographic databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Knowledge, Scopus, and Cochrane Library, and reference lists from relevant articles were searched for English-language publications describing randomized controlled trials of GnRH agonist pretreatment vs placebo or no treatment before laparoscopic myomectomy. Three studies including 168 participants were identified. Pretreatment with GnRH agonist did not reduce operative time; however, intraoperative blood loss was statistically lowered (mean difference, 60 mL; 95% confidence interval [CI], 39-82). Statistical difference was also observed in postoperative hemoglobin concentration (mean difference, 1.15 g/dL; 95% CI, 0.46-1.83]) and red blood cell count (mean difference, 0.65 × 10(6) cells/mL; 95% CI, 0.16-1.14]) but not serum iron concentration. None of the patients in the studies experienced any major intraoperative or postoperative complications, and only 1 patient in each group required blood transfusion. This study does not show a difference in operative time with GnRH agonist pretreatment, which clarifies the previous conflicting reports on the effect of GnRH agonist therapy on the duration of laparoscopic myomectomy. Furthermore, despite previously reported decreased bleeding conferred by the laparoscopic approach compared with laparotomy, this meta-analysis demonstrates a further reduction in intraoperative blood loss with GnRH agonist pretreatment in patients undergoing laparoscopic myomectomy. Additional high-quality studies with appropriate power and follow-up are needed to corroborate these findings and to evaluate the treatment effects on short- and long-term outcomes such as perioperative complications and fertility."

Chemotherapy has conferred significant improvements in disease-free and overall survival for young women with breast cancer; however, with improved cure rates, long-term adverse effects of cytotoxic treatment, such as premature ovarian failure (POF) and infertility, have become increasingly important.

Thereupon, this study was conducted to evaluate the age-related recurrence patterns after conservative surgery for endometrioma."
CD008018,0,18495569,0,[Premature ovarian failure after chemotherapy for breast cancer].,"About a quarter of breast cancers occur before menopause. Most breast cancer types occurring in young women require adjuvant treatments that can partially or definitively affect the reproductive function. Risk factors of chemotherapy-induced ovarian failure (CIOF) include woman's age, type, dose and schedule of chemotherapy. Cyclophosphamide-based regimens, notably when high doses are used, confer the highest rates of CIOF (especially for patients older than 40). A continual decline in ovary function follows cyclophosphamide-based regimens. By contrast, anthracycline-based regimens confer lower rates of CIOF and ovarian function recovers in half of the cases. The role of more recently reported adjuvant chemotherapy strategies in CIOF, such as alternative schedules (for example, dose-dense therapy), newer agents (for example, taxanes) or the addition of new therapies such as trastuzumab, is still controversial or unknown. Ovarian suppression through gonadotropin releasing hormone (Gn-RH) agonists treatment during chemotherapy to avoid CIOF is still under evaluation. Until the publication of prospective clinical trials results, ""non-controlled"" use of Gn-RH agonists should not be encouraged, notably for patients with a hormonosensible tumor, since there is insufficient evidence regarding their safety and effectiveness on female fertility preservation. More recent data suggest that an individual woman's risk of developing CIOF could be determined by the exploration of some genetic variants like CYP2C19. Before treatment strategy determination, the desire to preserve fertility should be systematically taken into account. Likewise, the early loss of ovarian function induced by treatments has to be explained to young patients diagnosed with a breast cancer and can sometimes lead to therapeutic options associated with less ovary dysfunction."
CD008018,0,18789958,0,Leuprolide acetate reduces both in vivo and in vitro ovarian steroidogenesis in infertile women undergoing assisted reproduction.,"Despite the probable inhibitory effects of GnRH analogues on ovarian steroidogenesis in vitro, their association with assisted reproduction protocols shows favorable results. This suggests that there are important differences in the behaviors of these drugs when administered in vivo versus in vitro. To clarify these differences, this study was designed to analyze the effect of leuprolide acetate (LA) on ovarian steroidogenesis in women undergoing In Vitro Fertilization (IVF). A prospective, randomized open label study was conducted on 14 women (26-35 years): seven receiving only gonadotrophins (Group 1) and seven receiving gonadotrophin plus LA at 1mg/day (Group 2). The LA in vivo effect was determined with serum and follicular fluid (FF) samples and via luteinized granulosa cell cultivation (GCC), where cells were obtained during oocyte retrieval after ovarian hyperstimulation. In vitro analysis was performed via addition of LA to GCC only for Group 1 (without LA) at progressively higher concentrations (0, 10(-12), 10(-9) and 10(-6)M). In vivo, the main observation was a reduction in androgen production in Group 2, represented by lower androstenedione production in FF (G1=6479+/-3458; G2=3021+/-1119 ng/ml; p=0.04) and a lower testosterone peak in GC at 96h (G1=0.64+/-0.12 ng/ml; G2=0.50+/-0.19 ng/ml; P=0.02), but a higher fertilization rate (G1=67%; G2=83%; p=0.009). In vitro, testosterone, estradiol and progesterone were also reduced by LA, even though this reduction occurred for progesterone only at the highest LA dosage (10(-6)M; 606.0+/-114.3 ng/ml versus 1524.0+/-246.5 ng/ml; p=0.02). Results show that LA reduces ovarian steroidogenesis in vivo by essentially inhibiting androgen synthesis; whereas, in vitro, ovarian steroidogenesis is reduced overall."
CD008018,0,12425754,0,Management of premenopausal women with early-stage breast cancer: is there a role for ovarian suppression?,"There is an overwhelming body of evidence that adjuvant ovarian ablation/suppression has a favorable impact on survival for premenopausal women with hormone-responsive early-stage breast cancer. This article reviews the randomized controlled trials that provide these data and the indirect evidence suggesting that much of the benefit seen for adjuvant chemotherapy in estrogen receptor-positive patients < 50 years of age is an indirect consequence of a chemical castration. Therefore, carefully selected women may have a choice of ovarian suppression with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogue, such as goserelin, as an alternative to chemotherapy, which would allow younger premenopausal women to retain fertility. In addition, if chemotherapy is selected and the patient does not develop permanent amenorrhoea, then additional treatment with a GnRH analogue is indicated."
