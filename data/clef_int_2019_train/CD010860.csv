CD010860,0,16503593,0,Hybrid dynamic coating with n-dodecyl beta-D-maltoside and methyl cellulose for high-performance carbohydrate analysis on poly(methyl methacrylate) chips.,"Hybrid dynamic coating using n-dodecyl beta-d-maltoside (DDM) and methyl cellulose (MC) has been developed for suppression of analyte adsorption and electroosmotic flow (EOF) in a poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) channel. The adsorption of APTS-labeled sugars in a PMMA channel was obviously suppressed with DDM dynamic coating; however, EOF was reduced only by a factor of approximately 25%, resulting in irreproducible separations. In contrast, both analyte adsorption and EOF in a PMMA channel were efficiently minimized with MC coating; however, concentrated MC above 0.3% was required to achieve high-performance separations, which greatly increased viscosity of the solution and caused difficulties during buffer loading and rinsing. In addition, n-dodecyltrimethylammonium chloride did not show observable effects on reducing analyte adsorption, although it has the same hydrophobic alkyl chain as DDM. These results strongly indicated that the polysaccharide moiety of surface modifiers has a specific affinity to surface charges and is crucial to achieving efficient and stable dynamic coating on the PMMA surface. Hybrid dynamic coating with 0.25% DDM and 0.03% MC was found to minimize both analyte adsorption and EOF in a PMMA channel to a negligible level, while still keeping a low viscosity of the solution. High-speed and high-throughput profiling of the N-linked glycans derived from alpha1-acid glycoprotein, fetuin, and ribonuclease B was demonstrated in both single-channel and 10-channel PMMA chips using DDM-MC hybrid coating. We propose that DDM-MC hybrid coating might be a general method for suppressing analyte adsorption and EOF in polymer MCE devices. The current MCE-based method might be a promising alternative for high-throughput screening of carbohydrate alterations in glycoproteins."

CD010860,0,20394408,0,"Hybrid ceramic polymers: new, nonbiofouling, and optically transparent materials for microfluidics.","A new, commercial hybrid ceramic polymer, Ormocomp, was introduced to the fabrication of microfluidic separation chips using two independent techniques, UV lithography and UV embossing. Both fabrication methods provided Ormocomp chips with stable cathodic electroosmotic flow which enabled examination of the Ormocomp biocompatibility by means of microchip capillary electrophoresis (MCE) and (intrinsic) fluorescence detection. The hydrophobic/hydrophilic properties of Ormocomp were examined by screening its interactions with bovine serum albumin and selected amino acids of varying hydrophobicity. The results show that the ceramic, organic-inorganic polymer structure natively resists biofouling on microchannel walls even so that the Ormocomp microchips can be used in intact protein analysis without prior surface modification. With theoretical separation plates approaching 10(4) m(-1) for intact proteins and 10(6) m(-1) for amino acids and peptides, our results suggest that Ormocomp microchips hold record-breaking performance as microfluidic separation platforms. In addition, Ormocomp was shown to be suitable for optical fluorescence detection even at near-UV range (ex 355 nm) with detection limits at a nanomolar level ( approximately 200 nM) for selected inherently fluorescent pharmaceuticals."
CD010860,0,20684520,0,High-throughput profiling of the serum N-glycome on capillary electrophoresis microfluidics systems: toward clinical implementation of GlycoHepatoTest.,"We developed a 3 h procedure for preparing serum N-glycans and labeling them with 8-aminopyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid (APTS) by sequential addition of reagents to the serum and incubation in a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) thermocycler. Moreover, we succeeded in analyzing these samples by capillary electrophoresis on three commercial microfluidics-based platforms: the MCE-202 MultiNA, the 2100 Bioanalyzer, and a modified prototype of the eGene system which were originally designed for nucleic acid separation and detection. Although these instruments use short separation channels, our technical improvements made it possible to reliably measure the N-glycans constituting GlycoHepatoTest. This test comprises a panel of biomarkers that allows follow-up of liver fibrosis patients starting from the early stage. In this way and for the first time, we demonstrate a clinical glycomics assay on an affordable, robust platform so that clinical chemistry laboratories can exploit glycomics in the diagnosis and monitoring of chronic liver disease. Another potential application is the rapid screening of the N-glycosylation of recombinant glycoproteins produced for pharmaceutical use."
CD010860,0,18997295,0,Development of a rapid screening instrument for mild cognitive impairment and undiagnosed dementia.,"Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) often presages development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We recently completed a cross-sectional study to test the hypothesis that a combination of a brief cognitive screening instrument (Mini-Cog) with a functional scale (Functional Activities Questionnaire; FAQ) would accurately identify individuals with MCI and undiagnosed dementia. The Mini-Cog consists of a clock drawing task and 3-item recall, and takes less than 5 minutes to administer. The FAQ is a 30-item questionnaire completed by an informant. In addition to the Mini-Cog and FAQ, a traditional cognitive test battery was administered, and two neurologists and a neuropsychologist determined a consensus diagnosis of Normal, MCI, or Dementia. A classification tree algorithm was used to pick optimal cutpoints, and, using these cutpoints, the combined Mini-Cog and FAQ (MC-FAQ) predicted the consensus diagnosis with an accuracy of 83% and a weighted kappa of 0.81. When the population was divided into Normal and Abnormal, the sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value were 89%, 90%, and 95%, respectively. The MC-FAQ discriminates individuals with MCI from cognitively normal individuals and those with dementia, and its ease of administration makes it an attractive screening instrument to aid detection of cognitive impairment in the elderly."

CD010860,0,19212721,0,Microchip capillary electrophoresis.,"Microchip capillary electrophoresis (MCE) is gaining popularity due to the developments of simple microfabrication methods under nonstringent laboratory conditions. Moreover, the low material and production costs of polymer-based microchips have further stimulated advances in the applications of MCE in various fields, including clinical analysis, drug screening, biomarker identification, and biosensing. In this chapter, a simple and robust protocol for fabrication of microchips for lab-on-chip testing and microchip electrophoresis is described. The microchips are hybrid poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS)/glass microchips, which are produced by a combination of photolithography and micromolding processes. This type of microchip has been used in a wide range of analyses."
CD010860,0,16350786,0,[Laboratory on a microfluidic chip].,"The recent achievements of microfluidic chip and its applications, based on the works mainly carried out in the authors' lab are reviewed. The chip fabrication capabilities have been extended into design and fabricate chips with higher degree of complexity in different materials, such as quartz, glass, polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), and polydimethyl siloxane (PDMS). A set of methods for surface modification of micro-channels on such materials have been developed, which results in better reproducibility and higher efficiency in protein and peptide analysis. The use of novel materials for chip fabrication is also under investigation. A series of microfluidic workstations with integrated chip manipulation as well as laser induced fluorescence (LIF), ultraviolet (UV), electrochemical and chemiluminescence detection modules have been developed to attain the abilities of complex microfluidic control and data acquisition schemes. A single cell/single molecule imagining system was built up for dynamic analysis of molecular or cellular events too. Based on the work mentioned above, different functional units, such as membrane, monolithic, isotachophoresis (ITP) etc were set up and integrated. Glycoform separation of turkey ovalbumin in a lectin monolithic column and an electrophoresis channel was performed on an integrated microchip. And a novel technique has been developed that allows for the coupling of ITP and non-gel sieving electrophoresis for protein analysis in a single microchip and resulting in - 50 fold increase of the sensitivity in comparison with the use of gel electrophoresis only. A single molecule detection (SMD) based technique was developed for simultaneously measuring both bulk flow and near-wall flow velocity in the microchannels. And more recently, an SMD based technology was developed for observing molecular interactions at single molecule level. An ultra-rapid microchip electrophoresis method was established for simultaneous determination intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reduced glutathione (GSH) related to apoptosis and oxidative stress. In an effort to develop a novel microfluidic based drug screening platform, systematic studies on the interaction between granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and sulfated oligosaccharides were carried out at both molecular and cellular levels. Doxorubicin induced apoptosis of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) was studied using the integrated microfluidic device with concentration generator. In the application phase, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) diagnosis based on reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and microfluidic chip electrophoresis (MCE) with 18 cases, methylation analysis of the P16 gene in 159 samples of patients and references for cancer diagnosis and polymorphism analysis of angiotenigen gene in 226 patients and references with essential hypertension are described.

CD010860,0,3980292,0,Cognitive styles and learning styles as predictors of academic success in a graduate allied health education program.,"The inclusion of noncognitive variables in the admissions decision process has been suggested as a reliable means of more fully assessing the potential abilities of individuals within the applicant pool. An increase in predictive efficiency is particularly important now that allied health educational programs are faced with a continuing decline in the number of applicants. This study was designed to determine whether cognitive-style and learning-style variables are predictive of success in a graduate allied health education program. Three cognitive-style measures were used to assess integrative complexity, dogmatism, and field-independence-dependence. Learning-style preferences were measured by Canfield's Learning Styles Inventory. Academic success was measured by scores on the Master's Comprehensive Examination (MCE). The results indicated that there was no significant relationship between academic success and the cognitive-style variables. However, a stepwise multiple regression indicated that 20.44% of the variance on the multiple-choice section of the MCE and 41.36% of the variance on the essay portion of the MCE were explained by learning-style variables."
CD010860,0,20164591,0,"The computerized self test (CST): an interactive, internet accessible cognitive screening test for dementia.","The computer self test (CST) is an interactive, internet-based instrument designed to assess functional cognitive domains impaired by Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). This study consisted of 215 total subjects with a mean age of 75.24. The 84 cognitively impaired patients (excluding patients diagnosed as MCI) met all criteria set forth by NINCDS/ADRDA for the diagnosis of AD. Control participants consisted of 104 age-matched individuals who were cognitively unimpaired. All patients completed the CST prior to other routine neurocognitive procedures. The CST accurately classified 96% of the cognitively impaired individuals as compared to controls, while the Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) accurately classified 71% and the Mini-Cog 69% in the same respect. In addition, the CST accurately classified 91% of the six experimental groups (control, MCI, early AD, mild to moderate, moderate to severe, and severe) as compared to 54% for the MMSE and 48% for the Mini-Cog. In conclusions, the CST demonstrates a high degree of sensitivity and specificity and is capable of accurately identifying cognitive impairment in patients with variable degrees of cognitive abnormality. This interactive internet-based cognitive screening tool may aid in early detection of cognitive impairment in the primary care setting. The ease of use and interpretation may also provide the means to obtain an accurate baseline from which to monitor cognitive changes over time."
CD010860,0,18049065,0,How to try this: the mini-cog.,"As the population grows and the proportion of older adults increases, the incidence and prevalence of dementia are expected to increase dramatically. Health care providers' lack of awareness of current geriatrics practice and persistence in holding the outdated belief that confusion is a normal part of aging contribute to significant under recognition of dementia in all settings. Early recognition and diagnosis are critical to carrying out best practices in the care of older patients. The Mini-Cog is a simple, effective, easily administered screening tool that can uncover cognitive impairment in its earliest stages. The tool consists of a three-item recall task and a simple clock-drawing task. The Mini-Cog takes only three to five minutes to administer and requires minimal training.

CD010860,0,21695696,0,Impact of extractables/leachables from filters on stability of protein formulations.,"Aqueous extractables/leachables from three sterilizing-grade filter membranes [polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), polyethersulfone (PES), and mixed cellulose ester (MCE)] were found to significantly reduce the surface tension of aqueous solutions. To evaluate the effect of these extractables/leachables from filter membranes on stability of protein formulations, model IgG2 formulations (with or without added surfactant) were spiked with different levels of filter extractables from stock solutions as a stress study. The stock solutions of extractables were created by processing the filter membranes through autoclaving and soaking steps. The IgG2 formulations were subsequently subject to agitation and temperature stress. Extractables/leachables from the filters were found to have a significant protective (PVDF, PES) and destabilizing (MCE) impact on both visible and subvisible particulates formation under agitation stress for formulations that did not contain any additional surfactant such as polysorbate 80. The impact of filter extractables/leachables on chemical stability of the antibody formulation displayed a more complicated pattern, but was generally destabilizing, causing increases in aggregation, oxidation, and acidic species. In conclusion, extractables/leachables from filter membranes may have impact on protein formulation stability and caution should be exercised during protein filtration, especially when filtering small volumes and in preformulation or high-throughput screening studies."

CD010860,0,11680896,0,Integrating molecular medicine with functional proteomics: realities and expectations.,"We analyze key proteomic issues and cutting-edge technologies that will spearhead inroads into functional interpretations of human diseases and their therapeutic rectification, following the availability of the predicted human proteome. We contrast the distinctions between high quality data that are low throughput, (e.g., 3-D proteomic reconstructions in embryogenic and nervous system contexts, and multigenerational transgenic studies), versus automated data harvesting that is more distant from human disease phenotypes and currently fulfills a diagnostic role, (e.g., molecular portraits of human diseases via transcriptomic analyses). We examine the extent to which these approaches impinge upon a realistic understanding of human diseases, namely how close they come to revealing the causal events involved in the initiation of disease. While tissue sources from human embryogenesis, foetal development and the brain remain the absolute priority, the pragmatic approaches utilize judicious data integration from selected proteomic studies of model organisms. The role of genome-wide disease-related screens, ""humanized"" transgenic analyses, multigenerational gene interference methods, and analyses of post-translational modifications in epigenetic contexts from Drosophila will be crucial, since these avenues are far too slow and transgenically cumbersome in mammals. Finally, the implementation of multi compartment electrolyzers (MCE) and multi photon detection (MPD) systems will be pivotal for the proteomic profiling of human tissue samples."

Thus, human error must be guarded against at every juncture. We have implemented a portable system, the MiniCog Rapid Assessment Battery, to assess quickly and accurately nine cognitive functions (including attention, working memory, and problem-solving). This system is intended to provide an ""early warning,"" indicating when an astronaut or other type of worker is suffering from stress-related deficits that may affect performance. The results can be used to warn a worker to pay additional attention or take a countermeasure (even if only a brief rest). At present, the MiniCog platform is fully functional; it includes software for administering cognitive tests on a hand-held device and providing immediate user feedback, as well as desktop software for authoring new tests and scoring results in detail. Studies are underway to assess the utility of the MiniCog Rapid Assessment Battery for measuring impaired cognitive performance induced by a variety of stressors, for evaluating countermeasures, and for predicting performance on more complex tasks.

This can have disastrous effects on the operational capability of aircrew, but such impairment could be prevented by auxiliary cooling devices. This hypothesis was tested under very hot-dry conditions, in which eight males performed 2 h of low-intensity exercise (~30 W) in three trials, whilst wearing biological and chemical protective clothing: temperate (control: 20°C, 30% relative humidity) and two hot-dry trials (48°C, 20% relative humidity), one without (experimental) and one with liquid cooling (water at 15°C). Physiological strain and six cognitive functions were evaluated (MiniCog Rapid Assessment Battery), and participants drank to sustain hydration state. Maximal core temperatures averaged 37.0°C (±0.1) in the control trial, and were significantly elevated in the experimental trial (38.9°C ± 0.3; P < 0.05). Similarly, heart rates peaked at 92 beats min(-1) (±7) and 133 beats min(-1) (±4; P < 0.05), respectively. Liquid cooling reduced maximal core temperatures (37.3°C ± 0.1; P < 0.05) and heart rates 87 beats min(-1) (±3; P < 0.05) in the heat, such that neither now differed significantly from the control trial (P > 0.05). However, despite inducing profound hyperthermia and volitional fatigue, no cognitive degradation was evident in the heat (P > 0.05). Since extensive dehydration was prevented, it appears that thermal strain in the absence of dehydration may have minimal impact upon cognitive function, at least as evaluated within this experiment."

Using a pan-genome microarray including MAP and M. avium subspecies hominissuis 104 genomes (MAPAC) we demonstrate the genotype to be MAP Type II with a single deletion of 19 contiguous ORFs (16 kb) including a complete mammalian cell entry (mce7_1) operon and adjacent proline-glutamic acid (PE)/proline-proline-glutamic acid (PPE) genes. A deletion specific PCR test was developed and a subsequent screening identified four goat herds infected with the variant strain. Each was located in central Spain and showed epidemiological links suggestive of transmission between herds. A majority of animals infected with the variant manifested a paucibacillary form of the disease. Comparisons between virulent complete genome compliment strains isolated from multibacillary diseased goats and the MAP variant strain during entry into activated macrophages demonstrated an increased sensitivity in the variant to intracellular killing in human and ovine macrophages. As PPE and mce genes are associated with mycobacterial virulence and pathogenesis we investigated the interplay of these gene sets during cell entry using the MAPAC array. This showed significant differential transcriptome profiles compared to full genome complement MAP controls that included changes in other undeleted mce operons and PE/PPE genes, esx-like signalling operons and stress response/fatty acid metabolism pathways. This strain represents the first report of a MAP Type II genotype with significant natural genomic deletions which remains able to cause disease and is transmissible in goats."
CD010860,0,14518050,0,High-speed chiral separations on a microchip with UV detection.,"Fast chiral separations of a variety of basic and acidic compounds could be realized on microfluidic quartz chips. A microchip electrophoresis instrument equipped with a linear imaging UV-detector was used. The usually applied but troublesome fluorescence tagging in order to enable fluorescence detection could be omitted. Using sulfated cyclodextrins as chiral selectors baseline separation of 19 compounds could be achieved in less than 1 min with high reproducibility. The relative standard deviation of migration time was below 7%. The fastest separation could be performed in 2.5 s which is to date the fastest separation of enantiomers reported. It was possible to apply microchip electrophoresis (MCE) for the determination of high enantiomeric excess (ee) values, as exemplarily shown for pseudoephedrin where 2% of the minor enantiomer could reliably be determined beside high amount of the other isomer. Successful separation of a mixture of 3 chiral drugs could be performed in a single run in less than 11 s utilizing a separation length of only 12 mm. These results show that MCE has great potential for fast chiral analysis and high-throughput screening."
CD010860,0,15217776,0,Screening for cognitive impairment among older people in black and minority ethnic groups.,"There is a well-documented tendency for cognitive tests to underestimate the abilities of older people in black and minority ethnic groups. This gives rise to a substantially higher risk of mistaken diagnosis of dementia. Reasons include differences in extent or focus of formal education, lack of familiarity with English, lack of literacy in own first language, and culture-specific factors related to individual test items. Attempts to improve the accuracy of screening for these groups have included adaptation of existing tests, including adjustment of cut-points, translation and replacement of culture-specific items. So-called 'culture-free' tests have also been developed, which are less dependent on language, literacy and other skills developed during formal education. Cultural modifications and evidence of cross-cultural performance are summarized here for traditional tests (Mini-Mental State Examination, Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire, Short Orientation-Memory-Concentration Test, Abbreviated Mental Test Score, Clifton Assessment Procedures for the Elderly), and for culture-free tests (Clock Drawing Test, Mini-Cog, 7-minute screening battery, Time and Change Test). The evidence on unadapted traditional tests shows that short ones perform at least as well as longer ones, and are more consistent across cultural and educational groups. Cut-point adjustments have not been universally found successful in improving accuracy, and do not address issues of acceptability. Translated and/or culturally adapted versions exist for a number of tests: it is important to establish cut-points appropriate to the target populations. There are promising results on culture-free tests, which are seen as less threatening and require little language interpretation, but they require further evaluation."
CD010860,0,16859628,0,Development and assessment of radioreceptor binding assays for the detection of saxitoxin binding proteins in biological extracts.,"Several radioreceptor assays using tritiated saxitoxin ([(3)H]STX) were developed to identify a suitable primary screening method for the detection and characterization of soluble saxitoxin binding proteins from biological extracts. Assays using anion and cation exchange, protein binding, and traditional charcoal radioreceptor methods were compared with two previously reported formats. A protein binding assay incorporating filters of mixed cellulose esters (MCE) outperformed all other assay strategies with maximal signal, low background, exceptional reproducibility, minimal matrix effects, and high throughput. Binding site titrations verified that an increase in total protein in the assay led to a concomitant linear increase in the amount of specifically bound [(3)H]STX within the range of 1-90microg total protein. Saturation binding experiments demonstrated that the binding sites were saturable and that nonspecific binding was linear. The MCE assay was unaffected by 600mM NaCl and 500mM KCl. Likewise, minimal variation of specific binding was observed between pH 5 and pH 9, but inhibition was observed below pH 5."

CD010860,0,16499914,0,High-throughput nitric oxide assay in biological fluids using microchip capillary electrophoresis.,"In order to develop a high-throughput screening method for the nitrogen monoxide metabolites, nitrite and nitrate, in biological fluids, we have investigated the simultaneous determination of these metabolites using microchip capillary electrophoresis (MCE). In this study, the control of applied voltage to obtain higher sensitivity by increasing the sample injection volume was investigated. Also, the improvement of reproducibility by correcting the injection volume using the internal standard was investigated. By increasing the sample volume, the limits of detection achieved for nitrite and nitrate were 24 and 12 microM, respectively. Because we used a 10-fold diluted sample when detecting nitrite and nitrate in human serum, it was necessary to increase the sensitivity by a factor of 10-50. The run-to-run and day-to-day relative standard deviations achieved were improved to less than 10% by using an internal standard to correct the injection volume. Moreover, we obtained successful separation of nitrite and nitrate in spiked human serum within 6.5 s under optimum analytical conditions. As a result, although it is necessary to obtain greater sensitivity, it was concluded that determination of the amount of NO metabolites in biological fluids using MCE is possible."
CD010860,0,19142914,0,Simple and rapid genotyping of D-amino acid oxidase gene recognizing a crucial variant in the ddY strain using microchip electrophoresis.,"A rapid genotyping method of D-amino acid oxidase (DAO), an enzyme that catalyzes the oxidative degradation of most of the D-amino acids in mammals, has been established. This method employs a one-step PCR, restriction enzyme digestion and rapid microchip electrophoresis (MCE), and the DAO genotype of the living individual mice was definitely determined within a day by clearly separating the 95 and 107 bp Hpa II digested DNA fragments. For verification of the method, the DAO activity in the kidney of individual mice was also determined, and the obtained values completely matched the estimated genotypes (DAO(+/+), DAO(+/-), and DAO(-/-)). The intrinsic amounts of D-Pro in the serum and kidney of mice with three DAO genotypes were compared for the first time, and demonstrated that the D-amino acid amounts in the DAO(+/+) mice (1.93 +/- 0.66 nmol/mL serum, not detectable in the kidney) and DAO(+/-) mice (1.50 +/- 0.24 nmol/mL serum, not detectable in the kidney) were almost the same. The present method should be a powerful tool to establish various pathologic-model animals under the complete care of their intrinsic DAO activity, which are useful for the screening of D-amino acids having physiological activity and/or diagnostic values."

CD010860,0,8733925,0,Nonverbal local context cues explicit but not implicit memory.,"Memory research distinguishes two components of episodes--the event or item and the spatial-temporal setting or context in which it occurred. The word context is used either globally to denote the physical, social, or emotional environment at study and test or it is used locally to refer to another word or picture that was paired with a particular target. In this article, we report four experiments that investigated the influence of two different nonverbal local contexts on explicit word recognition and implicit word identification test performance. In each experiment, university students studied words that were displayed against various extra-item local contexts, and the contexts were either the same or different at study and test. What differed across experiments was the nature of the contexts: for Experiments 1 and 2, it was a band of color that stretched across the computer screen, and for Experiments 3 and 4, the context was a colored line drawing. The combined findings from all experiments provide no evidence of memory context effects (MCE) on priming. By contrast, recognition test performance showed reliable MCEs but only when the local context was a concrete drawing or when it was a color that was target-related or appropriate. The discussion compared these findings with those from previous studies that concerned the cueing effectiveness of verbal and nonverbal extra-item contexts."

CD010860,0,17120261,0,Usefulness of microchip electrophoresis for the analysis of mitochondrial DNA in forensic and ancient DNA studies.,"We evaluate the usefulness of a commercially available microchip CE (MCE) device in different genetic identification studies performed with mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) targets, including the haplotype analysis of HVR1 and HVR2 and the study of interspecies diversity of cytochrome b (Cyt b) and 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) mitochondrial genes in forensic and ancient DNA samples. The MCE commercial system tested in this study proved to be a fast and sensitive detection method of length heteroplasmy in cytosine stretches produced by 16 189T>C transitions in HVR1 and by 309.1 and 309.2 C-insertions in HVR2. Moreover, the quantitative analysis of PCR amplicons performed by LIF allowed normalizing the amplicon input in the sequencing reactions, improving the overall quality of sequence data. These quantitative data in combination with the quantification of genomic mtDNA by real-time PCR has been successfully used to evaluate the PCR efficiency and detection limit of full sequencing methods of different mtDNA targets. The quantification of amplicons also provided a method for the rapid evaluation of PCR efficiency of multiplex-PCR versus singleplex-PCR to amplify short HV1 amplicons (around 100 bp) from severely degraded ancient DNA samples. The combination of human-specific (Cyt b) and universal (16S rRNA) mtDNA primer sets in a single PCR reaction followed by MCE detection offers a very rapid and simple screening test to differentiate between human and nonhuman hair forensic samples. This method was also very efficient with degraded DNA templates from forensic hair and bone samples, because of its applicability to detect small amplicon sizes. Future possibilities of MCE in forensic DNA typing, including nuclear STRs and SNP profiling are suggested."

CD010860,0,8900595,0,Molecular cloning of an alpha-esterase gene cluster on chromosome 3r of Drosophila melanogaster.,"All or part of the alpha-esterase gene cluster in Drosophila melanogaster has been isolated by screening a YAC clone that spans cytological region 84D3-10 with consensus carboxyl/cholinesterase oligonucleotides. The cluster encompasses 11 putative esterase genes within 65 kb of genomic DNA and is one of the largest clusters of related protein-coding genes yet reported in Drosophila. The cluster must include the gene encoding the major alpha-esterase isozyme, EST9, which has previously been mapped to 84D3-5. It probably also includes the genes encoding the EST23, MCE and ALI esterases that have previously been mapped to 84D3-E2. The latter three are homologs of genes involved in organophosphate insecticide resistance in the sheep blowfly, Lucilia cuprina and the housefly, Musca domestica. Sequencing of one of the putative esterase genes in the Drosophila cluster, alpha E1, shows that it would encode features characteristic of an active carboxyl/cholinesterase, including the so-called catalytic triad, the nucleophilic elbow and oxyanion hole. It also shows that the closest relative of alpha E1 amongst previously published esterase sequences is ESTB1, which confers organophosphate resistance in Culex mosquitoes. We argue that we have cloned the D. melanogaster version of a major cluster of esterase genes which have variously mutated to confer organophosphate resistance in diverse Diptera."

CD010860,0,18654937,0,Types of deception revealed by individual differences in cognitive abilities.,"The two studies reported in this article are an extension of the neuroimaging study by Ganis et al. (2003), which provided evidence that different types of lies arise from different cognitive processes. We examined the initial response times (IRTs) to questions answered both deceptively and truthfully. We considered four types of deceptive responses: a coherent set of rehearsed, memorized lies about a life experience; a coherent set of lies spontaneously created about a life experience; a set of isolated lies involving self-knowledge; and a set of isolated lies involving knowledge of another person. We assessed the difference between truthful and deceptive IRTs. Scores from cognitive tasks included in the MiniCog Rapid Assessment Battery (MRAB) were significant predictors of IRT differences. Each type of lie was predicted by a distinct set of MRAB scores. These results provide further evidence that deception is a multifaceted process and that different kinds of lies arise from the operation of different cognitive processes."

CD010860,0,9831484,0,MVLN cells: a bioluminescent MCE-7-derived cell line to study the modulation of estrogenic activity.,"We previously established a stable expression system in MCF-7 cells for the detection of (anti)estrogenic activity by assaying the reporter enzyme activity of firefly luciferase. In this cell line (called MVLN), the bioluminescent response can be measured either in the cellular homogenate, or in intact living cells. Here we present various potential experimental uses of this cellular model. First, we used this cell line to screen natural or synthetic molecules classified as full or partial (anti)estrogens and observed that their behavior towards our model was identical to that expected. Moreover, the bioluminescent response was in agreement with the natural responses like cellular proliferation or stimulation of the progesterone receptor. We then demonstrated the inhibitory effects of retinoic acid and 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3, two molecules which do not compete with estradiol for its receptor. We thus deduced that with this cell line an ""antiestrogenic"" effect which occurred at any step of the estrogenic action, might be detected. Finally, we showed that detection of luciferase activity in intact living cells was particularly helpful for investigating the evolution of estrogenic activity. For instance, we observed that long-term treatment of MVLN cells with an antiestrogen irreversibly decreased the bioluminescent response by more than 90%. This phenomenon affected all cells equally and could not be reversed, even by long-term estradiol treatment. We therefore conclude that this chimeric response faithfully reflects estrogenic action in the cell and can be used to develop different aspects of the endocrine research."

The sensitivity of the MCE was 93.5% and specificity was 82%. Multivariate statistical analysis showed that the age, sex and education all had significant impacts on the MCE global rating. Out of 13 MCE items, only nine (temporal orientation, spatial orientation, calculation, repetition of a sentence, inverting the order of 3 numbers, sequence of praxic orders, abstraction and naming of objects) discriminated between subjects with dementia and controls. The MCE proved to be a highly efficient screening instrument for dementia."

CD010860,0,16844966,0,Screening for caspase-3 inhibitors: effect of a reducing agent on identified hit chemotypes.,"When studying cysteinyl proteases in general and caspases in particular, it is generally accepted that a reaction buffer must contain a reducing agent to prevent essential cysteinyl groups from spontaneous oxidation. Dithiothreitol (DTT) and beta-mercaptoethanol (beta-MCE) are 2 of the most broadly used reducing agents. While screening a library of small molecules against caspase-3, the authors have found that the nature of the reducing agent used, DTT or beta-MCE, dramatically affects screening results and leads to identification of nonoverlapping hits. Screening in DTT-containing buffer revealed few novel classes of small molecules that selectively and reversibly inhibit caspase-3 but failed to identify isatin sulfonamides recently found to be potent and selective caspase-3 inhibitors (false negatives). On the other hand, screening in the presence of beta-MCE failed to identify a series of hit compounds, 1,3-dioxo-2,3-dichloro-1H-pyrrolo[3,4-c]quinolines, discovered with DTT, whereas isatin sulphonamides in these conditions exhibited strong caspase-3 inhibition. In this work, the authors show that thiol-containing reducing agents can affect catalytic activity of caspase-3 and modify its thermostability in a redox-potential-independent manner. The authors speculate that the differential structural modifications of caspase-3 seen with different reducing agents represent structurally different caspase-3 conformations and are responsible for its differential sensitivity to small molecules of different chemotypes. Hence, selection of the reducing agent may dramatically affect the quality of high-throughput screening campaigns."

CD010860,0,22310499,0,Reducing agents affect inhibitory activities of compounds: results from multiple drug targets.,"High-throughput screening (HTS) of large compound libraries has become a commonly used method for the identification of drug leads, and nonphysiological reducing agents have been widely used for HTS. However, a comparison of the difference in the HTS results based on the choice of reducing agent used and potency comparisons of selected inhibitors has not been done with the physiological reducing agent reduced glutathione (GSH). Here, we compared the effects of three reducing agents-dithiothreitol (DTT), β-mercaptoethanol (β-MCE), and tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP)-as well as GSH against three drug target proteins. Approximately 100,000 compounds were computationally screened for each target protein, and experimental testing of high-scoring compounds (~560 compounds) with the four reducing agents surprisingly produced many nonoverlapping hits. More importantly, we found that various reducing agents altered inhibitor potency (IC(50)) from approximately 10 μM with one reducing agent to complete loss (IC(50)>200 μM) of inhibitory activity with another reducing agent. Therefore, the choice of reducing agent in an HTS is critical because this may lead to the pursuit of falsely identified active compounds or failure to identify the true active compounds. We demonstrate the feasibility of using GSH for in vitro HTS assays with these three target enzymes."

The experimental setup consists mainly of a lamp-based epifluorescence microscope for variable-wavelength fluorescence detection and imaging and a programmable four-channel bipolar high-voltage source capable of delivering up to +/- 10 kV per channel. The optical unit was equipped with a high-sensitivity photomultiplier tube and an adjustable aperture. The system was applied to MCE separations of flurescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labelled amines utilizing blue light (450-480 nm) for excitation as well as for the separation of rhodamines utilizing excitation light in the green spectral region (531-560 nm). At optimized conditions baseline separation of four FITC-labelled amines could be obtained in less than 50 s at a detection limit of 460 ppt (1 nM) with a signal-to-noise ratio of 3:1. Three rhodamines could be baseline-separated in less than 6 s at a detection limit of 240 ppt (500 pM). The relative standard deviations of absolute migration times determined in repetitive MCE separations of FITC-labelled amines were below 2.5% (n= 25).

Recent proteomic reports of Bacillus subtilis have shown that many proteins with Sec-like signal peptides and absence of a transmembrane helix domain are still observed in membrane-enriched fractions, but further evidence about signal peptide cleavage or soluble protein contamination is still needed. Here we report a proteomic screening of identified peptides in culture filtrate, membrane fraction and whole cell lysate of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. We were able to detect peptide sequencing evidence that shows that the predicted signal peptide was kept uncleaved for several types of proteins such as mammalian cell entry (Mce) proteins and PE or PE-PGRS proteins. Label-free quantitation of all proteins identified in each fraction showed that the majority of these proteins with uncleaved signal peptides are, indeed, enriched in the Triton X-114 lipid phase. Some of these proteins are likely to be located in the inner membrane while others may be outer membrane proteins."

Factors effective in reducing use of investigators' time and expenses included limiting exclusion of data because of abnormal Mini-Cog scores by careful initial screening and avoiding repeated reminders or follow-up, collecting data in small groups, collapsing consent, dementia screening, and data collection into single sessions, as well as accommodating for sensory and literacy deficits. The cross-sectional, descriptive studies were conducted among community-dwelling older adults attending senior citizen centers and among older adults in independent or assisted living apartments within continuing care retirement communities (CCRCs). In the latest study, a convenience sample (N=152) was recruited and data collection was completed in 4 weeks at a total cost of less than $5,000. Methods common to qualitative research and those commonly used in community-based research were adapted to reduce time and costs for recruitment, screening, and data collection. Given limited availability of research funding, other nursing researchers may find one or more of these methods useful."
CD010860,0,15961323,0,Altered generation of spontaneous oscillations in Alzheimer's disease.,"Slowing of spontaneous alpha oscillations and an anterior shift of a source of alpha activity (8-13 Hz) have been consistently reported in the EEG studies of Alzheimer's disease (AD). It is unknown whether these changes are associated with a gradual shift in location and frequency of existing sources or rather with the involvement of a new set of oscillators. We addressed this question by applying source modeling (minimum current estimates, MCE) to spontaneous alpha activity recorded with a 306-channel MEG system from eleven non-medicated AD patients with mild to moderate cognitive impairment and twelve age-matched controls during the eyes-closed session. AD patients had predominant lower alpha band sources in the temporal regions, whereas in the controls, robust alpha sources were found near the parieto-occipital sulcus. Activation within the parieto-occipital region was significantly weaker, and activation in the right temporal area was significantly enhanced in the AD patients. These results suggest an increased temporal-lobe contribution coinciding with parieto-occipital deficits. We propose that MCE, which provides simultaneous mapping of several oscillatory sources, might be useful for detecting neurophysiological abnormalities associated with AD in combination with other neuropsychological and neurological measures."

Identification of minimal cytotoxic epitopes (MCEs) from this CMV protein is of importance for peptide-based vaccines and immunotherapeutic approaches. Several pp150-specific CTL clones were derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of healthy CMV-positive donors with autologous fibroblasts infected either with CMV AD169 or with a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing full-length pp150 protein. HLA A*0301- and HLA A*6801-restricted CD8+ pp150 T-cell clones derived from different donors were found to efficiently kill autologous CMV-infected fibroblasts. Fine mapping of each MCE first used a T-cell epitope prediction algorithm. Overlapping peptides within the recognized regions were screened. The analysis identified pp150(792-802) and pp150(945-955) as MCEs for the HLA A*6801 and the HLA A*0301 pp150 clones, respectively. In vitro stimulation by recombinant modified vaccinia Ankara virus expressing full-length pp150 elicited high frequencies of CMV-CTL and interferon gamma production specific for the MCE identified in all subjects. The consistent presence of pp150 T cells in CMV-exposed individuals supports a role for this antigen in shaping the antiviral CTL response and indicates that pp150 could be a pivotal constituent of prophylactic and therapeutic CMV vaccines."

We studied 72 diabetic patients, aged 41 to 65 years, recruited consecutively at the Poitiers diabetes clinic. All patients had at least one cardiovascular risk factor associated with diabetes mellitus (type 1 diabetes duration > or =15 years, dyslipidaemia, smoking, hypertension, micro/macro-albuminuria). A structured questionnaire, physical examination and resting electrocardiogram provided no evidence of coronary heart disease. SMI was defined as positive exercise electrocardiogram and/or dipyridamole thallium myocardial scintigraphy. CRP was estimated using the Framingham equation adapted to the French population. We defined a high CRP value as annual CRP > or =1.5%. Major coronary events (MCE) were defined as myocardial infarction, ischaemic heart failure, unstable angina or sudden death. Twenty-one patients with type 1, and 51 with type 2 diabetes were followed up for 39+/-12 months: 30 women and 42 men, aged 55+/-7 years with diabetes duration of 16 +/- 11 years (mean +/- SD). SMI was detected in 8 patients. Major coronary events occurred in 8 patients, 2 of whom had SMI. High CRP was found in 18 patients, 3 of whom had MCE. CRP was significantly higher in those patients with a major coronary event (1.71 +/- 1.11 versus 1.03 +/- 0.56%; p=0.048), but not in those with SMI (1.19 +/- 0.72 vs 1.09 +/- 0.67%; p=0.654). In Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, a high CRP was associated with the risk of a major coronary event (log-rank=5.36; p=0.021), whereas SMI was not (log-rank=2.02; p=0.155). The cumulative incidence of MCE in those patients with high and low CRP was 8.08 (0.49-15.67) vs 2.15 (0.06-4.22) events per 100 patient year of follow-up, respectively."
CD010860,0,22172089,0,The Mini-Cog versus the Mini-Mental State Examination and the Clock Drawing Test in daily clinical practice: screening value in a German Memory Clinic.,"The aim of this study was to compare the screening value of the Mini-Cog, Clock Drawing Test (CDT), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the algorithm MMSE and/or CDT to separate elderly people with dementia from healthy depending on test time, type and severity of dementia, and demographic variables in a German Memory Clinic."
CD010860,0,20638142,0,A quick dementia screening tool for primary care physicians.,"The accuracy and consuming-time of screening methods are important factors in the early diagnosis of dementia. In this study, we aimed to know whether the eight-item test (including three-item recall, attention and calculation, subtracted from the mini-mental state examination (MMSE), clock drawing test (CDT), and instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) impairment or any combination of the above tests can be used as a quick and effective dementia screening tool. A total of 188 seniors aged over 60 years were enrolled at a geriatric clinic. The result revealed that a cutoff score of 6/7 in an eight-item scale had a sensitivity of 94.9% and a specificity of 59.1% in the detection of dementia. In terms of sensitivity and specificity, the eight-item scale performed better than a score of two in three-item recall (51.3%/87.3%), a score of one in three-item recall (83.3%/53.6%), CDT (39.0%/96.9%), mini-cognitive assessment instrument (Mini-Cog) test (53.7%/95.5%), a score of less than three in attention/calculation test (74.7%/77.3%), impairment of transportation or medication in IADL (67.2%/90.6%), and any impairment in IADL (77.2%/67.9%). In subgroup analysis, a cutoff score of 5/6 were adjusted for the low-education group. We conclude that an eight-item test is a sufficient and simple tool for the screening of early dementia in primary-care clinics focused on older people care."
CD010860,0,22700858,0,Predicting cognitive sequelae in survivors of critical illness with cognitive screening tests.,Survivors of critical illness have a high rate of cognitive impairments that may persist years after hospital discharge. Data are lacking regarding whether cognitive screening tests administered at hospital discharge can be used to predict which critically ill patients are likely to have long-term cognitive sequelae.

CD010860,0,11241728,0,The Mini-Cog: receiver operating characteristics with expert and naïve raters.,"As elderly populations grow, dementia detection in the community is increasingly needed. Existing screens are largely unused because of time and training requirements. We developed the Mini-Cog, a brief dementia screen with high sensitivity, specificity, and acceptability. Here we describe the development of its scoring algorithm, its receiver operating characteristics (ROC), and the generalizability of its clock drawing scoring system."
CD010860,0,9674026,0,[Clock drawing test: qualitative and quantitative evaluation methods].,"The interest about the Clock Drawing Test (CDT) is justified because the importance of praxic disorders and especially the constructive apraxias in demented patients. Generally, this kind of deficits or intellectual losses has been less studied than aphasisas and agnosias. Nevertheless, praxias are usually affected in demential processes, even in initial stages."
