CD010355,0,2154154,0,Pressurized aerosol versus jet aerosol delivery to mechanically ventilated patients. Comparison of dose to the lungs.,"The purpose of this study was to compare deposition of aerosol to the lung from a metered-dose inhaler (MDI) and aerosol holding chamber and from a jet nebulizer in ventilator-dependent patients. Twenty-one patients were entered into the study, all receiving assisted ventilation and inhaled bronchodilators because of airflow limitation. The average age was 68 yr; there were 10 men and 11 women. The patients were randomized to receive either 4 puffs (800 micrograms) of radiolabeled fenoterol by MDI of 1.75 ml (1,750 micrograms) of radiolabeled fenoterol solution by nebulizer. Imaging of lung fields was made by a portable scintillation camera at 5-min intervals during the study. Results showed that 20 patients completed the study, 9 receiving fenoterol by MDI, and 11 by jet nebulizer. Four were excluded from analysis because of previous pneumonectomy, two from each group. Lung deposition measured as a percent of given dose from either system was 5.65 +/- 1.09 (mean +/- SEM) for MDI plus extension chamber and 1.22 +/- 0.35 for jet nebulizer (p less than 0.001). Therefore, this trial shows significantly greater efficiency of aerosol deposition to the lung in ventilator-dependent patients when using an MDI plus aerosol holding chamber than when using a jet nebulizer."
CD010355,0,3318740,0,A comparative study of conventional versus high-frequency jet ventilation with relation to the incidence of postoperative morbidity in thoracic surgery.,"Sixty-five patients undergoing a thoracic procedure were randomly allocated to one of two groups. The first group received a conventional method of ventilation (double-lumen endobronchial tube and collapse of one lung) and the second, high-frequency jet ventilation (HFJV). The incidence of postoperative chest infections (clinical and bacteriological), the chest drain volumes, and the length of postoperative stay in the hospital were recorded. Results showed the jet ventilator group had a significantly reduced mean hospital stay (p less than 0.01), which could be attributed to a lower incidence of postoperative chest infections (p less than 0.001) and significantly improved arterial blood O2 tensions at 4 hours (p less than 0.05), 24 hours, and 7 days postoperatively (p less than 0.001)."
CD010355,0,17992482,0,[Clinical Year in Review - advanced COPD].,"COPD is a frequent disease, affecting approximately one in four smokers. In older patients > 70 years of age, the proportion of individuals who never have smoked increases up to one in three individuals. Severe disease is present in 10%, and the limitation of performance is usually caused by airway obstruction, in a smaller portion of patients by the loss of alveolar surface (emphysema). After medical treatment with antiobstructive and anti-inflammatory drugs, oxygen remains a major therapy option. With it, hypercapnic patients benefit most from long-term therapy. Patients with predominant emphysema benefit most from high-flow (6-8 l/min) oxygen therapy during exercise. Permanent yellow or greenish sputum decoloration is suggestive of chronic bacterial colonization. This group of patients may benefit from a permanent inhalative therapy with antibiotics (mainly aminoglycosides). There is growing evidence from current literature to support this concept. If dyspnea is severe, especially during mild exercise, a subset of patients might benefit from the use of long-acting morphium. Goal of this therapy is to downregulate breathing control. Predominantly ""pink puffers"" seem to respond. A dose of 10-20 mg will usually be sufficient. Life-threatening hypercapnia is usually not observed with this form of therapy. Noninvasive ventilation is an option for patients with severe hypercapnia. Thereby, ventilatory pressure or inspiratory volume should be selected to effectively unload the respiratory muscles. This will increase quality of life. Life span is likely to be prolonged, however, comparative data where patients were effectively ventilated (as seen on the reduction of hypercapnia) are missing. A multicenter trial addressing this topic is currently being conducted in Germany. Independent of the severity of COPD, patients in general benefit from physical training with alternation of endurance and interval training being most effective. This will decrease the number of hospital admissions and probably mortality as well. Lung volume reduction surgery virtually treats lung hyperinflation. Bullectomy is still considered effective for isolated bullous emphysema as well as lobectomy, if this portion of the lung is without function. Shaving procedures are still associated with high rates of complications and should only be performed in selected cases. Effectiveness of endoscopic lung volume reduction surgery by implantation of plugs or valves cannot be assessed yet. First data are rather disappointing. Ultimate alternative remains lung transplantation with life expectancy ranging between 5-6 years independent of age. Indeed, consequent application of previously described measures might preserve a stable state over many years."

CD010355,0,18453351,0,Anesthetic considerations in candidates for lung volume reduction surgery.,"The administration of anesthesia to patients undergoing lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS) requires a complete understanding of the pathophysiology of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, the planned surgical procedure, and the anticipated postoperative course for this group of patients. Risk factors and associated morbidity and mortality are discussed within the context of patients with obstructive pulmonary disease in the National Emphysema Treatment Trial having surgical procedures. Preoperative evaluation and the anesthetic techniques used for patients undergoing LVRS are reviewed, as are monitoring requirements. Intraoperative events, including induction of anesthesia, lung isolation, management of fluid requirements, and options for ventilatory support are discussed. Possible intraanesthetic complications are also reviewed, as is the optimal management of such problems, should they occur. To minimize the potential for a surgical air leak in the postoperative period, positive-pressure ventilation must cease at the conclusion of the procedure. An awake, comfortable, extubated patient, capable of spontaneous ventilation, is only possible if there is careful attention to pain control. The thoracic epidural is the most common pain control method used with patients undergoing LVRS procedures; however, other alternative methods are reviewed and discussed."
CD010355,0,9620517,0,Arterial oxygenation and shunt fraction during one-lung ventilation: a comparison of isoflurane and sevoflurane.,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of isoflurane and sevoflurane on oxygenation and shunt fraction during one-lung ventilation (OLV). Twenty patients undergoing lobectomy for lung cancer and scheduled for long-term OLV were enrolled in this study. Patients were allocated to treatment with either isoflurane or sevoflurane. Arterial oxygenation, shunt fraction, and hemodynamics were evaluated at the end of two-lung ventilation; 20 min after the initiation of OLV; 20 min after the application of 4-cm positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) to the dependent lung; 20 min after 8-cm PEEP; and 20 min after the conversion from OLV to two-lung ventilation. There was no significant difference between isoflurane and sevoflurane with regard to oxygenation, shunt fraction, or hemodynamics during OLV. PaO2 values after the application of 4-cm PEEP increased from 131.1 +/- 11.8 mm Hg to 190.6 +/- 22.9 mm Hg in the isoflurane group (P < 0.05) and from 127.2 +/- 14.3 mm Hg to 192.4 +/- 26.9 mm Hg in the sevoflurane group (P < 0.05). The selection of either isoflurane or sevoflurane for OLV was made without regard to arterial oxygenation and shunt fraction. PEEP application to the dependent lung is useful for improving oxygenation during OLV, but 8-cm PEEP had no added effect compared with 4-cm PEEP."
CD010355,0,2198997,0,Non-conventional techniques of ventilatory support.,"The non-conventional techniques for ventilatory support represent a new approach to the management of patients with respiratory failure. A large number of studies indicate that these techniques can maintain adequate gas exchange under conditions in which the traditional concepts of gas transport no longer hold. We have reviewed the group of techniques, collectively called high frequency ventilation (HFV), in which the tidal volumes are much less (1 to 5 ml per kg) than those observed during conventional mechanical ventilation. Although HFV has theoretical advantages in some clinical settings, it has been shown to be superior to conventional mechanical ventilation in but a few. HFV appears to provide adequate ventilation while still allowing access to tracheal and laryngeal surgical fields. It has been successful during pneumonectomy, and in the treatment of bronchopleural fistulae. The relevance of tracheal insufflation (TRIO) of oxygen and constant flow ventilation (CFV) to the human clinical setting is uncertain. TRIO may be useful to oxygenate patients who are difficult to intubate, or TRIO could be applied for ventilation of patients involved in mass casualties. Although CFV does not maintain normal levels of PaCO2 in humans, it can provide adequate oxygenation. It might be clinically applicable during thoracic surgery, in which movement of the abdominal and thoracic contents associated with conventional mechanical ventilation is undesirable. During CFV, the lung is kept motionless with sufficient airway pressures to maintain patency of airways and alveoli. CFV is useful as a tool for studying phenomena affected by breathing. The rationale for the use of an artificial lung during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) or extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal with low positive pressure ventilation (ECCO2R-LFPPV) in the treatment of acute respiratory failure is to provide temporary respiratory function while the pulmonary lesion is being treated or is resolving. The factors that most limit the usefulness of ECMO are not technical but relate to the ability of the lung to recover structurally and functionally after a severe insult. Poor survival figures in the published series of ECMO in adults reflect the gravity of illness prior to treatment. However, results in neonates have been quite encouraging. ECCO2R allows less exposure of blood to the extracorporeal circuit and avoids the reduction in pulmonary blood flow associated with ECMO. Although the reported survival of adults with severe acute respiratory failure treated with ECCO2R is extremely promising, it is important to point out that none of the published reports are controlled, randomized studies.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
CD010355,0,21357311,1,Intermittent positive-pressure breathing after lung surgery.,"Intermittent positive-pressure breathing is thought to avoid atelectasis and improve pulmonary function after major lung resections. Since no clear scientific data was available to confirm this, our objective was to determine whether atelectasis can be avoided and if postoperative lung function is improved. Prospective analysis was carried out in 135 patients operated on between 2007 and 2009; 55 received intermittent positive-pressure breathing. Pre- and postoperative lung function tests were similar in both groups. Pulmonary complications were observed in 19% of patients without intermittent positive-pressure breathing and 27% of those who received this treatment. We were unable to find evidence that additional improvement in postoperative pulmonary function is achieved when adding intermittent positive-pressure breathing to the standard physical therapy."
CD010355,0,20887415,0,How do COPD and healthy-lung patients tolerate the reduced volume ventilation strategy during OLV ventilation.,"Although a strategy of tidal volume (V(t)) reduction during the one-lung ventilation (OLV) period is advised in thoracic surgery, the influence of the pre-operative respiratory status on the tolerance of this strategy remains unknown. Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare the pulmonary function between chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and healthy-lung patients during the operative and the post-operative period."

CD010355,0,11673215,1,Noninvasive ventilation reduces mortality in acute respiratory failure following lung resection.,"When treated with invasive endotracheal mechanical ventilation (ETMV), acute respiratory insufficiency after lung resection is fatal in up to 80% of cases. Noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation (NPPV) may reduce the need for ETMV, thereby improving survival. We conducted a randomized prospective trial to compare standard therapy with and without nasal-mask NPPV in patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory insufficiency after lung resection. The primary outcome variable was the need for ETMV and the secondary outcome variables were in-hospital and 120-d mortality rates, duration of stay in the intensive care unit, and duration of in-hospital stay. Twelve of the 24 patients (50%) randomly assigned to the no-NPPV group required ETMV, versus only five of the 24 patients (20.8%) in the NPPV group (p = 0.035). Nine patients in the no-NPPV group died (37.5%), and three (12.5 %) patients in the NPPV group died (p = 0.045). The other secondary outcomes were similar in the two groups. NPPV is safe and effective in reducing the need for ETMV and improving survival after lung resection."

Therefore, the standardization of a physiotherapeutic attendance after lung resection in children is necessary."
CD010355,0,15648983,0,"An evaluation of the relative efficacy of an open airway, an oxygen reservoir and continuous positive airway pressure 5 cmH2O on the non-ventilated lung.","The aim of this study, during one-lung ventilation, was to evaluate if oxygenation could be improved by use of a simple oxygen reservoir or application of 5 cmH2O continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) to the non-ventilated lung compared with an open airway. Twenty-three patients with lung malignancy, undergoing thoracotomy requiring at least 60 minutes of one-lung ventilation before lung lobe excision, were studied. After routine induction and establishment of one-lung ventilation, the three treatments were applied in turn to the same patient in a sequence selected randomly. The first treatment was repeated as a fourth treatment and these results of the repeated treatment averaged to minimize the effect of slow changes. Arterial oxygenation was measured by an arterial blood gas 15 minutes after the application of each treatment. Twenty patients completed the study. Mean PaO2 (in mmHg) was 210.3 (SD 105.5) in the ""OPEN"" treatment, 186.0 (SD 109.2) in the ""RESERVOIR"" treatment, and 240.5 (SD 116.0) in the ""CPAP"" treatment. This overall difference was not quite significant (P = 0.058, paired ANOVA), but comparison of the pairs showed that there was a significant better oxygenation only with the CPAP compared to the reservoir treatments (t = 2.52, P = 0.021). While the effect on the surgical field was not apparent in most patients, in one patient surgery was impeded during CPAP. Our results show that the use of a reservoir does not give oxygenation better than an open tube, and is less effective than the use of CPAP 5 cmH2O on the non-ventilated lung during one-lung ventilation."

CD010355,0,27310989,0,Application of CO2 waveform in the alveolar recruitment maneuvers of hypoxemic patients during one-lung ventilation.,"Deterioration of gas exchange during one-lung ventilation (OLV) is caused by both total collapse of the nondependent lung and partial collapse of the dependent lung. Alveolar recruitment maneuver improves lung function during general anesthesia. The objective of this study was to investigate whether there is an indirect relationship between the changes of CO2 expirogram and the selective lung recruitment. To further improve the oxygenation and gas exchange, we compare adjust setting of ventilated parameters based on CO2 expirogram and a preset setting of ventilated parameters during OLV in patients undergoing right-side thoracic surgery.Thirty patients met the requirements criteria that were studied at 3 time points: during two-lung ventilation (TLV), during OLV with preset ventilation parameters (OLV-PP), and during OLV with adjustable ventilation parameters (OLV-AP) that are in accordance with CO2 expirogram. Adjustable ventilation parameters such as tidal volume (VT), respiratory rate (RR), positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), and the ratio of inspiratory to expiratory were adjusted by utilizing the phase III slopes of CO2 expirogram, which together with the relationship between the changes of CO2 expirogram and the selective lung recruitment.During OLV, the phase III slopes of CO2 expirogram in patients with pulse oxymetry (SpO2) decreased less than 93% after the OLV-PP, and were absolutely different from that during TLV. After OLV-AP, the phase III slopes of CO2 expirogram and SpO2 were similar to those during TLV. During OLV, however, parameters of ventilation setting in both OLV-PP and OLV-AP are obviously different.This study indicates that alveolar recruitment by utilizing CO2 expirogram probably improves SpO2 level during one-lung ventilation."

CD010355,0,7985254,0,[Prevention of postoperative pulmonary complications after heart-lung surgery. Comparison of 3 different mask physiotherapy regimens].,"The object of the investigation was to compare the effect of three different physiotherapy masks on the incidence of postoperative complications after thoracic surgery. It was carried out as a prospective, consecutive, randomized comparison at a Department of Thoracic and Heart Surgery at a University Hospital. The therapy was performed by experienced and specially trained physiotherapists. One hundred and sixty patients were evaluated; 60 patients undergoing heart surgery, 59 patients having pulmonary resection, and 41 patients with exploratory thoracotomy. In each operative category the patients were treated with one of three face mask systems used in addition to routine chest physiotherapy. These were either continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), positive expiratory pressure (PEP), or inspiratory resistance--positive expiratory pressure (IR-PEP). Postoperative pulmonary complications were assessed by forced vital capacity (FVC), arterial oxygen tension (PaO2), and chest X-ray examination, all parameters were measured preoperatively and on the fourth and ninth postoperative day. The patients filled in a questionnaire concerning their opinions about their mask treatment. IR-PEP showed a lesser decrease in PaO2 on day nine. Otherwise there was an equal decrease in FVC and PaO2, and equal frequency of atelectasis in the three mask treatments. It is therefore concluded that any of the three therapies: continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), positive expiratory pressure (PEP), and inspiratory resistance--positive expiratory pressure (IR-PEP) may be used as supplement to standard chest physiotherapy."

CD010355,0,12057100,0,Photodynamic therapy for mesothelioma.,"Multiple trials of traditional cancer therapies for malignant pleural mesothelioma (including surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy) have not convincingly demonstrated that any one treatment is superior to supportive care alone. Although there have been reports of long-term survivors who were treated with aggressive surgery combined with radiation and aggressive multi-agent chemotherapeutic regimens, these patient populations are highly selected and results cannot be generalized to a larger population. Despite attempts to use aggressive multimodality therapies, disease recurs in most patients. Local failure in particular is a large part of the natural history of mesothelioma, especially after surgery alone. Therefore, one of the major considerations in the development of new treatments is the inclusion of aggressive local therapies. Photodynamic therapy (PDT), a local treatment modality, is being evaluated as an adjuvant therapy to surgical resection. Clinical use of PDT requires the use of a photosensitizing agent and light of a wavelength specific to the absorption characteristics of the sensitizer in the presence of oxygen. The treatment effect of PDT is superficial, mostly because of the limited depth of light absorption in tissues. Therefore, it is theoretically an ideal treatment for tissue surfaces and body cavities after surgical debulking procedures. One theoretical advantage of PDT is that it can be used to treat the lung surface after a pleurectomy; therefore, patients may be treated with a pleurectomy rather than with an extrapleural pneumonectomy. Several studies have evaluated the efficacy of PDT in the treatment of mesothelioma. Clinical studies have not proven convincingly that the use of PDT is superior to the use of other adjuvant therapies or to surgery alone. The advent of newer photosensitizers and improved laser technology has led to a renewed interest in evaluating PDT. Additional studies are necessary to determine the role of PDT in the treatment of mesothelioma."
CD010355,0,2519936,0,Intrapleural bupivacaine--technical considerations and intraoperative use.,"The authors evaluated the incidence and type of technical problems associated with blind insertion of intrapleural catheters placed in 21 anesthetized patients and then injected in a double-blind fashion with 0.5% bupivacaine (1.5 mg/kg) or isotonic saline. The patients' chests were then opened, catheter positions located, and the lungs inspected. Eleven of the catheters were located with the tips intrapleurally, three extrapleurally, and seven actually in lung tissue. Eight patients had holes in the lung surface. Three patients had a pneumothorax, two of which were under tension. Plasma bupivacaine levels reached maximal concentrations at about 20 minutes in those with intrapleurally placed catheters, but not until 60 minutes when the catheter had actually penetrated the lung. Significant variations in plasma bupivacaine levels were achieved when the catheter entered lung tissue, with potentially toxic levels in one patient. To evaluate intraoperative analgesic effects, all patients were given a standard anesthetic with isoflurane, oxygen, and a muscle relaxant. There was no significant difference in isoflurane requirement between the groups who had bupivacaine v saline injected into their intrapleural catheters before surgery. It is concluded that blind insertion of intrapleural catheters can be hazardous, especially if followed by positive-pressure ventilation. In addition, catheter placement in lung tissue, which was not uncommon, delays the time for peak plasma concentrations and may increase risk of toxicity. Intrapleural bupivacaine was not found to be a useful adjunct to general anesthesia during thoracotomies."
CD010355,0,26407182,0,Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation for prevention of complications after pulmonary resection in lung cancer patients.,"Pulmonary complications are often observed during the postoperative period of lung resection for patients with lung cancer. Some conditions such as intubation, a long stay in the intensive care unit, the high cost of antibiotics and mortality may be avoided with the prevention of postoperative pulmonary complications. Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) is widely accepted and often used in hospitals, and may reduce the number of pulmonary complications and mortality after this type of surgery.

CD010355,0,9296413,0,Effects of oxygenation during selective lobar versus total lung collapse with or without continuous positive airway pressure.,"Hypoxemia is common during anesthesia with one-lung ventilation (OLV). This study tested the hypothesis that selective lobar blockade would result in higher PaO2 values compared with those found with total lung collapse independent of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) application. Thirty patients undergoing lobectomy were randomly assigned to one of four groups with the following maneuvers during OLV: Group 1 (n = 8) total lung collapse (TLC) plus 5 cm H2O of CPAP to the nonventilated operative lung for 15 mins, followed by selective lobe collapse plus 5 cm H2O of CPAP (during selective collapse only the surgical lobe was collapsed and the rest of that lung was ventilated); Group 2 (n = 6) selective lobar collapse plus 5 cm H2O of CPAP to the operative lung, followed by TLC plus 5 cm H2O of CPAP; Group 3 (n = 8) total lung collapse without CPAP, followed by selective lobe collapse and no CPAP; Group 4 (n = 8) selective lobe collapse without CPAP, followed by TLC and no CPAP. To obtain selective lobe collapse, the bronchial blocker of the Univent (Vitaid, Lewiston, NY) endotracheal tube was guided into the operative bronchus with the aid of a fiberoptic bronchoscope. Blood pressure, heart rate, and arterial blood gas measurements were obtained during the following times: Time 1--while the patient was awake; Time 2--two-lung ventilation (2LV) in the supine position; Time 3--after 30 min of OLV in the lateral decubitus position (no CPAP or selective blockade); Time 4 and Time 5--during maneuvers described above (see group description); Time 6--2LV resumed; Time 7--30 min after extubation. Twenty-eight patients completed the study. There were no differences among groups with regard to arterial blood pressure, heart rate, or arterial oxygen saturation during the experimental maneuvers. All four groups showed a decrease in PaO2 from 2LV to OLV (P < 0.05). Both with and without CPAP application, oxygenation was improved with selective lobe collapse compared with TLC. When selective lobe collapse with 5 cm H2O of CPAP followed TLC (group 1), PaO2 values increased to values similar to those found for 2LV (PaO2 449 +/- 122 vs 394 +/- 105 mm Hg). This study indicates that by using a bronchial blocker, changing from total lung collapse to selective lobar blockade improves PaO2 during lung surgery."

MATERIAL AND METHODS Sixty patients receiving lung lobectomy were randomized into the conventional one-lung ventilation (CV) group (n=30) and the ipsilateral low tidal volume high frequency ventilation (LV) group (n=30). In the CV group, patients received only contralateral OLV. In the LV group, patients received contralateral ventilation and additional ipsilateral ventilation of low tidal volume of 1-2 ml/kg and high frequency of 40 times/min. Normal lung tissues were biopsied for the analysis of lung injury. Lung injury was scored by evaluating interstitial edema, alveolar edema, neutrophil infiltration, and alveolar congestion. RESULTS At 30 min and 60 min after the initiation of one-lung ventilation and after surgery, patients in the LV group showed significantly higher ratio of the partial pressure of arterial oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen than those in the CV group (P<0.001). Lung injury was significantly less severe (2.7±0.7) in the LV group than in the CV group (3.1±0.7) (P=0.006). CONCLUSIONS Additional ipsilateral ventilation of low tidal volume and high frequency can decrease the risk of hypoxemia and alleviate lung injury in patients receiving lobectomy."

CD010355,0,15919483,0,Average P/F ratio during donor management for finding out the potential donor of lung procurement.,"We investigated the potential donors from cases without lung procurement in spite of considering procurement as the donor. We reviewed 207 cases considered for lung procurement. Donors were divided into 2 groups according to whether or not their lungs were harvested: 50 did and 157 did not. We investigated their age, gender, donor management periods, blood pressure, heart rate, P/F ratio, PCO2, HCO3, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), respiratory rate, abnormal findings in the chest X-ray, blood chemistries, sputum culture, and intravenous administration of steroid. Univariable or multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to predict lung harvesting by various factors. Univariable logistic regression analysis revealed maximum heart rate (HR) and respiratory rate (RR), maximum, minimum, and average P/F ratio, and abnormal findings in the chest X-ray, to be predictors to perform transplant. The maximum HR and RR of the non-harvest group are higher than those of the harvest group. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed average P/F ratio only to be a predictor to transplant. We divided the non-harvest group into 2 groups according to whether or not their P/F ratio was >300: 55 did (P/F 300 group) and 102 did not (P/F 299 group). Between P/F 299 group and the harvest group, univariable logistic regression analysis revealed maximum HR, maximum and minimum RR, maximum PEEP, maximum, minimum, and average P/F ratio, and abnormal findings in the chest X-ray to be predictors to transplant. Maximum HR, PEEP, and maximum and minimum RR of the P/F 299 group are higher than those of the harvest group. Maximum, minimum, and average P/F ratio of the P/F 299 group are lower than those of the harvest group. The average PCO2 of P/F 299 group is higher than that of the harvest group. The rate of abnormal findings in the chest X-ray of the P/F 299 group is higher than that of the harvest group. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed average P/F ratio only to be a predictor to transplant. There were no predictors between the P/F 300 group and the harvest group in both univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses. Furthermore, there were no different factors between the P/F 300 group and the harvest group. Our study showed that 35.5% of the non-harvest group had a P/F ratio of >300 and had no difference compared with the harvest group. Our data suggest that potential donors existed in the non-harvest group and increased the number of lung procurement to 27.3% from 13.0% of all donors."

Despite an improvement in the perioperative management of cancer patients and specialization of surgical teams, morbidity and mortality remains significant. Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) is an effective therapeutic option in hypercapnic respiratory failure. It also improves functional and gasometric parameters when undertaken before surgery. The objective of the preOVNI study is to demonstrate that preoperative non-invasive ventilation for 7 days, at home, reduces the postoperative respiratory and cardiovascular complications of lung resection surgery, in a high-risk population."

CD010355,0,21675066,0,Mini-ventilation for improved oxygenation during lung resection surgery.,"Lung separation is frequently used during lung resection to facilitate surgery and hypoxaemia may occur because of increasing pulmonary shunt. In this study, we tested a method of mini-ventilation to the non-dependent lung and compared it to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) to improve oxygenation during lung resection. Thirty-eight adult patients participated in this randomised, single-blinded crossover study. Following lung separation, mini-ventilation and CPAP of 5 cmH2O were alternately applied every 15 minutes to the non-dependent lung. Mini-ventilation was performed by a portable time-cycled ventilator with a respiratory rate of 8 breaths/minute and a tidal volume of 0.1 to 0.15 l. Arterial blood gases, peak inspiratory pressure, the dynamic compliance in the dependent lung and the surgeon's evaluation of the surgical field exposure were recorded. The arterial oxygen partial pressure was significantly higher during mini-ventilation compared to CPAP (379 vs 228 mmHg). No difference was noted in the dependent lung peak inspiratory pressure or in the dynamic compliance. The surgical conditions were similar with both methods in 53% of the patients, while the surgeon preferred CPAP in 44% and mini-ventilation in 3%. In conclusion, mini-ventilation is a simple method which improves oxygenation during lung resection. However due to interference with surgical field exposure, it should be reserved for cases in which CPAP does not relieve hypoxaemia."

CD010355,0,17484789,0,Respiratory controversies in the critical care setting. Should noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation be used in all forms of acute respiratory failure?,"Noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation (NPPV) has been a major advance in the management of acute respiratory failure. Over the past decade alone, NPPV has been the subject of over 1,500 scientific papers, including 14 meta-analyses. NPPV's utility in many clinical settings has been well established, with demonstration in randomized trials of lower intubation rate, mortality, hospital stay, and advantages in other important clinical outcomes. However, it is still used in a minority of patients with acute respiratory failure. While there probably are situations in which NPPV is commonly under-utilized, there are other situations in which it is unlikely to be of benefit or likely to inflict harm. This paper debates the data for and against the more widespread application of NPPV. It will assist the clinician to identify both good and poor candidates for NPPV and thereby devote respiratory care resources where they will be most effective, and optimize patient outcomes."
