CD008081,0,785652,0,Cystoid maculopathy.,"Cystoid macular edema has become the most common and troublesome complication following cataract extraction. New techniques in cataract extraction, such as phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implants have not eliminated the problem, and careful studies are needed to determine whether they exacerbate or diminish it. Cystoid macular edema occurs in many areas of ophthalmology: cataract surgery, retinal surgery, uveitis, ocular tumors, diabetes, and arteriosclerotic vascular disease. Every ophthalmologist must, therefore, be thoroughly acquainted with methods for its recognition and with the inflammatory and vascular factors in its development. Prognosis and treatment are discussed, and the major gaps in our present understanding of pathogenesis are indicated, including the manner by which the vitreous changes following lens extraction lead to inflammation and the reason for the specific susceptibility of the mascular and disc capillaries to the inflammatory stimulus. Some hypotheses are presented."

CD008081,0,19183764,0,Severe macular edema induced by pioglitazone in a patient with diabetic retinopathy: a case study.,"We report a case of severe diabetic macular edema (DME) that developed after pioglitazone was used by a patient with proliferative diabetic retinopathy. A 30-year-old woman with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus visited our clinic in 2004. She had moderate pre-proliferative diabetic retinopathy OU. Because of the rapid progression of the diabetic retinopathy, she received pan-retinal photocoagulation in both eyes. Two weeks before using pioglitazone, her visual acuity was 0.9 OD and 0.7 OS. On October 2007, pioglitazone was prescribed by her internist because of poorly controlled blood glucose level. Two weeks later, her body weight increased, and her face became edematous. Her visual acuity decreased to 0.5 OU, and ophthlamoscopy showed severe DME in both eyes. Two weeks after stopping pioglitazone, her visual acuity improved to 0.8 OD and 0.5 OS, but the DME was still severe in the optical coherence tomographic images. Then, one half the usual dose (25 mg) of spironolactone, a diuretic, was given and her macular edema was resolved. Her final visual acuity improved to 0.9 OD and 0.7 OS. We recommend that when a patient taking pioglitazone complains of decreased vision, the physician should promptly consult an ophthalmologist."

CD008081,0,19568362,0,A case of radiation retinopathy of left eye after radiation therapy of right brain metastasis.,"A 37-year-old female, who had received modified radical mastectomy for cancer of her right breast, presented with decreased visual acuity in the left eye after radiation therapy for the management of the metastasis to her right brain 14 months ago. After ocular examination, we diagnosed her as radiation retinopathy. At the time of the first visit, the corrected best visual acuity was 0.4 in the left eye, and fundus examination revealed cotton wool spots and cystoid macular edema (CME). The findings in the right eye were normal except for cotton wool spots in the superior major arch. Fluorescein angiography (FA) showed marked telangiectasia and microaneurysms in her left eye but tiny microaneurysms in her right eye. Subsequent optical coherent tomography (OCT) showed CME. We injected intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide (TA). Two weeks after treatment, the visual acuity was improved to 0.6 and the retinal thickness was decreased. Three months later, the visual acuity in the left eye was dropped to 0.3 due to the recurrence of CME, so we injected intravitreal TA again. Five months later, visual acuity was improved to 0.5 and OCT revealed the improvement of CME. The incidence of radiation retinopathy is higher in the side nearer to radiation, but careful radiation blocking is also required on the opposite side of irradiation site considering the possibility of radiation retinopathy and careful observation is required on both sides of the eyes when performing fundus examination."

A 15-year-old girl with a history of mild, stable retinopathy of prematurity in both eyes noted progressively reduced visual acuity to hand motions in the left eye. Examination disclosed a vasoproliferative tumor of 10-mm base and 3.5-mm thickness with near total (macula-off) exudative retinal detachment. She was treated with iodine-125 plaque radiotherapy, giving apex dose of 40 Gy over 4 days. The tumor regressed to 1.9 mm and retinal detachment resolved 8 months following therapy. Epiretinal membrane with significant macular pucker and edema later developed and was managed with pars plana vitrectomy and membrane peeling. Visual acuity was counting fingers due to photoreceptor loss. Retinopathy of prematurity is a rare cause of vasoproliferative tumor.

The percentage of patients with DMO grows alongside the increasing number of diabetes occurrences. The DMO treatment has seen major developments in the past few years. A number of new treatment technologies have emerged, which enable not only a stabilisation of macular oedema but in the case of an early detection also a decrease of retina oedema accompanied by a visual functions improvement. Laser coagulation has remained the standard DMO treatment for many years; when applying modern diagnostic testing technologies (FAG and OCT), the newest trend in DMO treatment is the use of anti-VEGF preparations, depot intravitreal corticoids and in some cases also surgical intervention in the form of pars plana vitrectomy (PPV).

CD008081,0,17979601,0,Emerging pharmacotherapies for diabetic macular edema.,"Diabetic macular edema (DME) is the most frequent cause of severe vision impairment in patients with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Even though patients should achieve optimal glycemic control, normalization of blood pressure and serum lipids, as well as improvement of cardiac and renal status, these measures alone will not prevent every patient from developing visual loss caused by DME. The goal of local treatment for DME is vision improvement, usually achieved after reducing leakage on fluorescein angiography (FA) and retinal thickness on optical coherence tomography (OCT). Laser photocoagulation is still the standard treatment for clinically significant DME. However, laser photocoagulation rarely provides major visual improvement, especially in patients with diffuse DME. Thus, a therapeutic intervention that restores visual acuity impaired by DME more often remains a significant unmet medical need. This review aims to present the most important emerging drug technologies for therapy of DME at present, including corticosteroids, vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors, protein kinase C inhibitors, small interfering RNA, hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors and non-hormonal anti-inflammatory agents. Recent progress in this field suggests that local management of DME may change rapidly in the near future. Novel emerging drugs should enable better anatomical and functional outcomes for therapy of this sight-threatening disease."

An 80-year-male, a known case of chronic open-angle glaucoma for 13 years, had his IOP controlled by multiple topical antiglaucoma medications. There was an increase in IOP, progression of optic disc cupping and visual field loss along with cataract over the past 6 months. The patient underwent uneventful phacoemulsification with posterior chamber intraocular lens (PCIOL) and penetrating trabeculectomy. Postoperatively, the trabeculectomy bleb was flat and IOP was 44 mmHg and was not controlled by bleb massage. Bleb needling and suture lysis were performed after 2 weeks. The IOP dropped from 44 to 6 mmHg. Three days later the patient presented with a sudden decline in visual acuity (VA) from 0.5 to 1.225 logMAR. The fundus showed multiple retinal haemorrhages resembling ODR. Choroidal detachment also occurred after 3 weeks. Optical coherence tomography confirmed the presence of macular oedema which was treated with an orbital floor triamcinolone acetonide injection (OFTA).

CD008081,0,20594160,0,Intravitreal Bevacizumab (Avastin(®)) for Diabetic Retinopathy at 24-months: The 2008 Juan Verdaguer-Planas Lecture.,"Diabetic retinopathy (DR) remains the major threat to sight in the working age population. Diabetic macular edema (DME) is a manifestation of DR that produces loss of central vision. Proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) is a major cause of visual loss in diabetic patients. In PDR, the growth of new vessels is thought to occur as a result of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) release into the vitreous cavity as a response to ischemia. Furthermore, VEGF increases vessel permeability leading to deposition of proteins in the interstitium that facilitate the process of angiogenesis and macular edema. This review demonstrates multiple benefits of intravitreal bevacizumab (IVB) on DR including DME and PDR at 24 months of follow up. The results indicate that IVB injections may have a beneficial effect on macular thickness and visual acuity (VA) in diffuse diabetic macular edema. Therefore, in the future this new therapy could replace or complement focal/grid laser photocoagulation in DME. In PDR, this new option could be an adjuvant agent to pan-retina photocoagulation so that more selective therapy may be applied. In addition, we report a series of patients in which tractional retinal detachment developed or progressed after adjuvant preoperative IVB in severe PDR."

In total, 26 eyes in 26 patients were treated with three intravitreal injections of bevacizumab (Avastin™) given at 4-week intervals. Study parameters included: visual acuity (VA), perceived visual improvement, central macular thickness as measured by Spectralis OCT, macular sensitivity and fixation pattern as measured by MP-1 microperimetry, and the incidence of ocular and systemic side-effects. At the time of follow-up, 76.9 % of eyes showed a significant improvement in VA (p = 0.012), 38.4 % showed a one-line improvement on the ETDRS chart compared with VA at day 0, 30.7 % showed a two-line improvement, and 7.6 % showed at least a three-line improvement. The mean central macular thickness was 447 microns at day 0 and 311.1 microns at follow-up (p = 0.003). The mean baseline macular sensitivity, by MP-1 microperimetry, was 8.29 dB; at follow -up, macular sensitivity had improved to 14.26 dB (p = 0.025). These results support further controlled trials on the efficacy of intravitreal bevacizumab in treating diabetic macular edema. Microperimetry and OCT are important tools in managing diabetic patients, providing a detailed study of the macular region, particularly when it is necessary to monitor the morphological and functional outcome after various interventions.

The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of DR and DME in a community in China and to analyze the characteristics of their optical coherence tomography (OCT) images. This study was an incidence survey based on data from 108,132 residents living in the Beixinjing District, Shanghai, China. Patients with DME came from the local health network. OCT was performed in 151 eyes of 100 type 2 diabetes patients with DR and 102 eyes of normal control subjects. Totally 795 cases were examined, and 215 of them were diagnosed to have DR. The average thickness of the macular fovea was 195.56 microm in 151 eyes from 100 random samples. Forty-six eyes had macular thickening. The statistical analysis showed that there was a positive correlation between the thickness of the macular fovea and -log of best-corrected visual acuity (r = 0.2869, p = 0.0004) as well as the severity of DR (p = 0.0003).

The different therapeutic options available, and their most accepted indications depending on the degree of diabetic retinopathy that patients have, are reviewed. We propose what to do in cases of mild, moderate and severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy as well as in cases of proliferative diabetic retinopathy (panphotocoagulation/antiangiogenic drugs/vitreorretinal surgery). The treatment of diabetic macular edema depending on its angiographic and topographic characteristics is also discussed. The importance of metabolic control of the patient is stressed (tight glycemic control, control of arterial hypertension and dyslipemia) in aiding the treatment of diabetic retinopathy. This therapeutic proposal has been discussed widely by retinologists from the four largest hospitals in the Canary Islands, and is therefore an agreed text based on recent scientific literature."

The individual risk can be significantly reduced by early blood glucose control and treatment of vascular risk factors. Ophthalmologic screening visits in diabetics even without visual symptoms are necessary to ensure early treatment. Once visual function is impairmed, it is often irreversible. Ophthalmologic treatment is indicated when neovascularizations develop, carrying the risk of vitreous hemorrhage and tractive retinal detachment. Panretinal photocoagulation improves the balance of retinal oxygen demand and supply and therefore reduces the neovascular stimulus. In case of diabetic macular edema, focal retinal photocoagulation or intravitreal drug injections can be performed to stabilize capillary permeability in order to preserve vision. In advanced cases, the decision for surgical treatment via pars-plana-vitrectomy has to be evaluated individually."

CD008081,0,21212801,0,"The Optic UK Lecture: bench-to-bedside adventures of a diabetes researcher: results past, results present.","This presentation covers two topics. First is a basic laboratory study, designed to explore the mechanism for the phenomenon of 'early worsening,' in which individuals with type 1 diabetes and early to moderate retinopathy are rapidly placed on 'tight' blood glucose control, after which about 10% of these individuals develop a worsening of retinopathy with the appearance of multiple 'cotton wool' spots. Our studies on cultured retinal cells used vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production as an index of cellular ischaemia. VEGF production increases substantially when cells are cultured in low oxygen, but VEGF production in these hypoxic cultures decreases when the medium contains a fivefold excess glucose concentration. Cultures with no medium glucose also show increased VEGF production. In the clinical situation, we infer from these results that retinas with early retinopathy have a reduced blood supply and are therefore relatively ischaemic, thus increasing their VEGF production. Adding glucose provides an alternative energy supply, thus reducing the demand for VEGF and hence, reducing the likelihood of 'early worsening.' However, reducing the glucose supply to these already compromised retinas further increases their ischaemia and, therefore, the stimulus to produce more VEGF. The second part of this presentation is a clinical exploration of possible reasons for the frequent, wide discrepancy between measured central macular thickness by optical coherence tomography (OCT) and visual acuity in eyes with diabetic macular oedema. I explore the influence of different diseases in which macular oedema appears, the presence or absence, and size, of cystoid cavities; duration of the oedema; age of the subject, different anatomic derangements including epiretinal membranes and disruptions of the photoreceptor layer, and various biochemical and physiological mechanisms."
CD008081,0,19284099,0,[Loal and multifocal electroretinography in the diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy].,"The paper gives the results of electroretinography (ERG) in 38 patients (73 eyes) with type 2 diabetes mellitus at different stages of diabetic retinopathy (including in diabetic macular edema). The reductions in the macular ERG (M-ERG) amplitude parameters and in the retinal density of bioelectrical activity and the decreased amplitude and longer latency of multifocal ERG (mfERG) N1 and P1 components evidence the involvement of the retinal macular region into the pathological process and the magnitude of these changes depends on the presence of imaged macular edema. Despite the certain limitations of mfERG, assessment of the topography of retinal bioelectrical activity in the central field of vision is an important supplement to M-ERG results and may be a prognostic criterion for the development of a pathological process and its extent."
CD008081,0,14733132,0,[Vitreous and macular diseases].,"We investigated the vitreous in its origin, morphology, metabolism and regeneration, and its role in various vitreomacular diseases. Focal vitreous liquefaction developed anterior to a laser induced chorioretinal scar in rabbit eyes, which suggested that a normal retina is necessary to maintain the integrity of the vitreous. We measured levels of hyaluronic acid and of the precursor of type II collagen in vitreous samples obtained by vitrectomy. Those levels declined with age in women. The precursor of type II collagen was at the same level in the samples from vitrectomy and those obtained by fluid air exchange, which suggested a persistent secretion of type II collagen into the vitreous cavity even after vitrectomy. We found a posterior precortical vitreous pocket in human autopsied eyes whose vitreous was stained with fluorescein. Using the same methods, we confirmed the presence of intravitreal fibrous membranes in the ""tractus"" in the anterior vitreous. In clinical studies using biomicroscopy, observations during surgery, scanning laser ophthalmoscopy, and optical coherence tomography (OCT), we clarified the role of premacular vitreous cortex which forms the posterior wall of the ""pocket"" in the premacular membrane and macular hole. The premacular vitreous cortex seems to be the main structure of the premacular membrane and its contraction may cause macular hole. Ring-shaped proliferation tends to develop along the outer margin of the ""pocket"". OCT demonstrated that some diabetic macular edema is caused by traction of the premacular vitreous cortex. Vitrectomy appear to be effective for diabetic macular edema by eliminating vitreous traction and the accumulated cytokine in the ""pocket"". The retina appears to have a program for vitreous metabolism throughout life, including the premacular pocket formation."
CD008081,0,14733133,0,[Relationship between vitrectomy and the morphology and function of the retina].,"Pathological processes in the vitreous will be reflected in the morphology and function of the retina, and these processes can originate from sources outside the vitreous. The purpose of vitreous surgery is to remove the qualitatively and/or morphologically diseased vitreous. Successful vitrectomy will be manifested by an improvement in the structure and/or function of the retina. We have evaluated the morphology of the vitreoretinal interface, and the function of the retina before and after vitreous surgery. Plasmin-assisted vitrectomy was used in some cases to remove the diseased vitreous more efficiently and less invasively. The effect of this procedure was assessed by examining the morphology and function of the retina. First, the relationship between the qualitative and structural abnormality of the vitreous in macular diseases was studied. In aphakic/pseudophakic eyes with cystoid macular edema, there was a depression of retinal function over the entire retina which may have been caused by chemical mediators released into the vitreous. These mediators may have been produced by inflammation in the anterior segment of the eye. In eyes with an idiopathic macular hole, optical coherence tomographic (OCT) images suggested that the progression of the macular hole might depend on a balance between foveal adhesion and the posterior vitreous. Second, the efficacy, surgical damage, and limitations of vitreous surgery were investigated. The recovery of macular function was assessed by focal macular electroretinograms (FMERGs) after vitrectomy for epiretinal membrane, choroidal neovascularization, and diabetic macular edema. The concurrent examination by optical coherence tomography (OCT) suggested that a decrease in retinal thickness contributed to the functional recovery. Macular functional recovery was delayed and limited after macular translocation, diabetic macular edema, and internal limiting membrane peeling. Third, we studied the effect of plasmin-assisted vitrectomy on the retina. The plasmin was used to remove the vitreous more completely and less invasively. In rabbits, ERG, OCT, and histological examinations demonstrated that the use of commercially-available plasmin at a concentration used on human patients resulted in temporary adverse effects on the retina. For human patients, we purified the plasmin from the patients' serum at the Nagoya University Hospital and the activity was about the same as in previous reports. The purified plasmin was approved by our hospital's institutional review board, and written informed consent was obtained from each patient. Patients with macular edema, idiopathic macular hole, and epiretinal membrane without posterior detachment underwent plasmin-assisted vitrectomy and were evaluated morphologically and electrophysiologically. The efficacy of the plasmin in separating the vitreo-retinal interface was demonstrated by an occasional spontaneous posterior vitreous detachment with or without core vitrectomy, and the presence of less vitreous cortex attached to the internal limiting membrane that was removed during vitrectomy. This was the first histological demonstration of the effectiveness of plasmin in the living eye. Full-field ERGs before and after surgery demonstrated clear evidence that no alteration of retinal functional had occurred, although we did detect a possible osmotic effect by an increase in OCT-determined retinal thickness by the high-molecular weight autologous plasmin. In future studies, the proper concentration and reaction time for each condition of the vitreous should be determined. In conclusion, the pathophysiology of the vitreous should reflect the retinal function. The recovery of the structure of the retina is important for the recovery of retinal function. This should always be the primary goal of surgeons who perform quality surgery."

Peptide bioregulators in 90% cases promoted improvement of vision acuity, improved the ophthalmoscopic picture of the fundus oculi (resolution of hemorrhages, plasmorrhages, decreased macular edema) and in all cases improved the functional activity of the retina and retinal bloodflow. No negative changes in the clinical picture were observed after peptide bioregulators in any of the cases.

Some clinical cases of macular edema linked to ocular diseases like postradiotherapy for ocular melanomas remained of poor functional prognosis due to the primary disease.

Macular edema associated with epiretinal membranes or vitreomacular traction is the main cause of poor functional recovery.

CD008081,0,6676979,0,Funduscopically controlled scotometry.,"The following is a brief summary of the results in our ten groups of cases. The positive features of laser scotometry are emphasized. The normal response is well defined: there are no uncertain blind spot margins. The peripheral field is probably extended beyond 60 degrees nasally and superiorly. The size and shape of the small central scotomas associated with macular holes are easily defined and correlated directly with the visible edge of the hole. This result is distinct from the intact subjective response with cystoid maculopathy and surface wrinkling retinopathy. Plotting the margins of peripheral abnormalities such as retinal detachments, retinoschisis, and lattice degeneration is easily done. Schisis is distinguished by an absolute scotoma. This scotometry is facilitated by a larger ""normal"" field with the laser instrument. Lattice degeneration causes a field defect. A branch retinal artery occlusion shows a slightly jagged border, difficult to detect by standard methods. A cotton-wool spot does not show a total nerve-fiber-bundle defect. Small absolute scotomas are correlated with degenerative changes within nevi. Degenerative changes over small melanomas--ie, the orange spots--also produce absolute field defects. ""Bear track"" lesions have a normal field, whereas dense black isolated lesions are associated with absolute scotomas. In macular degeneration the bright laser test object is usually visible to the patient within detachments of neuroepithelium, detachments of the pigment epithelium, and over recent subretinal neovascularization. Response is absent over sharply-defined zones of pigment atrophy and over late subretinal fibrovascular mounds. In contrast to the degenerative cases, a selection of hereditary cases showed no direct correlation between the zone of pigment atrophy and the zone of absolute scotoma. The scotoma was much larger than the atrophic region, extending to the edge of the cream-colored subretinal spots. The laser target method sharply defines the absolute scotoma associated with papilledema. It also detects a slit-like nerve-fiber-bundle defect, suggesting progressive damage. Small, but possibly not the earliest, scotomas associated with glaucoma can be detected with laser scotometry. In some cases they are detected when the Goldmann perimetric field is normal. Late residual visual fields are easily defined, since fixation can be directly monitored. The vertical border of hemianopic defects can be defined within one degree of accuracy."

CD008081,0,16932949,0,[Diagnostics of metamorphopsia in retinal diseases of different origins].,"We investigated the ability of preferential hyperacuity perimeter (PHP) and Amsler grid testing to detect metamorphosia in patients with macular hole (MH), central serous retinopathy (CSR), epiretinal membranes (EM), intermediate AMD (iAMD), classic and occult choroidal neovascularization (CNV) due to AMD, and compared the results. A total of 147 patients (n =153 eyes) with classic (35 eyes) and occult (38 eyes) CNV, iAMD (13 eyes), MF (23 eyes), RCS (11 eyes), EM (13 eyes) and control group (20 eyes) were involved. All of these patients underwent corrected visual acuity and eye examinations inclusive of the Amsler grid. The PHP test was performed after pupil dilation. In all patients, fundus photography and optical coherence tomography (OCT) (Humphrey/Zeiss OCT III) were performed. In patients with CNV and CSR a fluorescein angiography was also performed. Metamorphopsia detection rates by Amsler grid and PHP were compared statistically. The sensitivity of PHP vs Amsler grid in detecting metamorphosia was 69% vs 85% in patients with MH, for CSR 64% vs 73%, EM 77% vs 100%, iAMD 85% vs 100%, classic CNV 83% vs 94% and occult CNV 81% vs 71%. The results for patients with occult CNV were significant (P =0.046), using the chi(2)-test. The PHP-test showed high sensitivity for diagnosing CNV. In occult CNV, PHP was superior to the Amsler grid in detecting metamorphopsia. In the other diseases involving the macular (MH, EM, CSR, iAMD), the detection rate and sensitivity of the Amsler grid was superior to PHP."
CD008081,0,15459787,0,"[Optical coherence tomography for macular edema. Classification, quantitative assessment, and rational usage in the clinical practice].","Optical coherence tomography (OCT) allows for morphological assessment of macular edema of various origins by producing two-dimensional images of the retina. In addition, retinal thickness can be measured quantitatively. In diabetic maculopathy, damage of the blood-retinal barrier can be indirectly assessed by locating the intraretinal fluid accumulation and the progress of maculopathy from diffuse to cystoid edema and even rupture of the retinal structure can be described as well as the formation of neurosensory retinal detachment with subretinal fluid. Increase of retinal thickness correlates with decrease in visual acuity. Detailed interpretation of OCT images can replace fluorescein angiography in certain cases, as has been shown for uveitis. In order to obtain correct classification of macular disease in routine clinical use, all images have to be completely assessed and compared to previous investigations and to the measurements of the fellow eye. More accurate normal values of retinal thickness and volume can be expected in the future. The importance of OCT in routine clinical assessment of macular edema will most probably continue to grow."

CD008081,0,23264331,0,Postsurgical cystoid macular edema.,"Cystoid macular edema (CME) is a primary cause of postoperative reduced vision. It may occur even when the intraoperative course is successful for operations such as cataract and vitreoretinal surgery. Its incidence following modern cataract surgery is 0.1%-2.35%. This risk is increased if there are certain preexisting systemic or ocular conditions and when there are intraoperative complications. The etiology of CME is not completely understood. Prolapsed or incarcerated vitreous and postoperative inflammatory processes have been proposed as causative agents. Pseudophakic CME is characterized by poor postoperative visual acuity. Fluorescein angiography is indispensable in the workup of CME, showing the classical perifoveal petaloid staining pattern and late leakage of the optic disk. Optical coherence tomography is a useful diagnostic tool, which displays cystic spaces in the outer nuclear layer. The most important differential diagnoses include age-related macular degeneration and other causes of CME such as diabetic macular edema. Most cases of pseudophakic CME resolve spontaneously. The value of prophylactic treatment is doubtful. First-line treatment of postsurgical CME should include topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and corticosteroids. Oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors can be considered complementary. In cases of resistant CME, periocular or intraocular corticosteroids present an option. Antiangiogenic agents, though experimental, should be considered for nonresponsive persistent CME. Surgical options should be reserved for special indications."

CD008081,0,22352446,0,Diabetic retinopathy: current and new treatment options.,"Diabetes mellitus has become a major health concern worldwide and its incidence is projected to increase. Diabetic macular edema (DME) and proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) are considered the most sight-threatening ocular complications in these patients. Pivotal studies, such as the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) and the Diabetic Retinopathy Study (DRS), have established macular and pan-retinal laser as the gold-standard of treatment for these complications. The recent discovery of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its role in the development of proliferative disease, has led to a movement towards treating PDR and DME with anti-angiogenic medications alone or in conjunction with the gold-standard of care. Due to the severity of the diabetic ocular complications and the rising incidence of diabetes worldwide, it is important for the non-ophthalmologist care provider to be informed of the new treatments available for these conditions in an effort to better guide their patients. In this review, I will discuss the importance of these new methods of treatment as well as the significance of systemic glucose control, vitreous surgery and laser photocoagulation."
CD008081,0,20825070,0,Optical coherence tomography in imaging of macular diseases.,"OCT (opitcal coherence tomography), is a diagnostic method that enables the analysis of the retinal structures by means of high-resolution tomographic cross-sections of the retina. Whereas fluorescein and indocyanine angiography allow visualization of the retinal epithelium layer and chorioretinal vessels, OCT may help in diagnosing and monitoring the condition of many internal retinal layers. Ultrasound B-mode examinations have a resolution of about 150 microm while OCT provides a resolution of 10 microm. OCT makes it possible to detect and measure morphological changes, retinal thickness, retinal volume, thickness of retinal nerve fiber layer and various parameters of the optic disc. We use OCT in the analysis of the retinal structures in various pathologies such as macular holes and pseudo-holes, epiretinal membranes, macular edemas of various origins, including vasooclusive disease and diabetic macular edema, lesions of vitreoretinal interface and vitreoretinal traction, serous and hemorrhagic detachments of the retina and of pigment epithelium, age related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma. OCT is an examination that is fast, sensitive, reproducible, non-invasive, non-contact and easy to perform and interpret for a retinologist. The aim of this article is to present OCT principles and techniques as well as OCT interpretation and images of most common retinal diseases: age related macular degeneration--dry and wet form, retinal angiomatous proliferation (RAP), central serous chorioretinopathy, epiretinal membranes, macular holes, diabetic retinopathy."

CD008081,0,17472415,0,Ruboxistaurin: LY 333531.,"Ruboxistaurin, an orally active protein kinase C beta (PKC beta) inhibitor, is a macrocyclic bisindolylmaleimide compound under development by Eli Lilly with potential as a therapy for diabetic macular oedema and other diabetic angiopathies, including diabetic retinopathy, diabetic peripheral neuropathy and diabetic nephropathy. Ruboxistaurin is awaiting approvals in the US and Europe for the treatment of diabetic retinopathy. Eli Lilly and Alcon entered into a long-term agreement to co-promote ruboxistaurin in the US and Puerto Rico for diabetic retinopathy. The agreement is subject to the US FDA's approval of the agent for this indication. Under the terms of the agreement, Alcon will assume primary responsibility for promotion to eye specialists including retinal specialists and general ophthalmologists, while Eli Lilly will be targeting endocrinologists and physicians. Subject to approval in the US, Eli Lilly will receive milestone and marketing payments from Alcon. Alcon in turn will receive compensation based on product sales. In December 2003, Eli Lilly signed a joint development and co-marketing agreement with Takeda Chemical Industries for ruboxistaurin in the Japanese market. Under the terms of the agreement, Eli Lilly Japan and Takeda will jointly develop ruboxistaurin in Japan, will file an NDA for diabetic peripheral neuropathy and diabetic retinopathy, and subsequently will market the drug in Japan. Ruboxistaurin was submitted for approval in Europe in the second quarter of 2006. The agent is also in phase II studies for the treatment of diabetic maculopathy (macular retinopathy) in Japan. Data from a phase III, 3-year study of ruboxistaurin in patients with moderate to severe diabetic retinopathy showed that ruboxistaurin markedly reduced the risk of sustained vision loss compared with placebo. This multicentre, randomised study, named PKC-DRS2 (Protein Kinase C-Diabetic Retinopathy Study 2), was conducted at 70 clinical sites and involved 685 patients with diabetic retinopathy. The agent is also in a phase II study in the US, Canada and Europe in patients with clinically significant macular oedema. The trial (B7A-MC-MBCU), which will evaluate oral administration of the drug using optical coherence tomography over a period of 18 months, is expected to enrol approximately 220 patients. This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was initiated in August 2005 and is expected to be completed in March 2008. Previously, results of the PKC-Diabetic Retinopathy Study (PKC-DRS) showed that ruboxistaurin at a dose of 32 mg/day has potential to reduce the risk of moderate vision loss especially in patients with diabetic macular oedema. This phase III, randomised, double-blind, multidose study in 252 patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes receiving ruboxistaurin or placebo for 3-4 years evaluated the safety of the agent and its effect on progression of diabetic retinopathy, moderate vision loss and sustained moderate vision loss. The study was conducted at Joslin Diabetes Center and at centres in the US, Canada, Denmark, The Netherlands and the UK. In 2004, Eli Lilly presented new analysis of previously reported data for ruboxistaurin in diabetic macular oedema indicating that ruboxistaurin has the potential to decrease the progression of diabetic macular oedema involving the center of the macula. Positive results from the PKC Beta Inhibitor Diabetic Macular Edema (PKC-DMES) trial were reported in 2003. Eli Lilly expected to file for approval of ruboxistaurin for the treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathy in the US and Europe in 2005. However, no development was reported for this indication. On 15 March 2007, Eli Lilly withdrew its marketing authorisation application for ruboxistaurin for diabetic retinopathy filed with EMEA in May 2006. Its current development status in the EU is unclear at this stage."

We report a case of a 69-year-old male patient who came to our attention for macular edema in hemiretinal vein occlusion.

A chorio-retinal shunt was demonstrated. The autofluorescence technique was used to predict the risk of CNV in the fellow eye. PDT was performed twice, but after the second cycle, patient developed choroidal ischemia and the visual outcomes were poor. The temporal course of CNV, the presence of a chorio-retinal shunt, and the autofluorescence pattern in the fellow eye let us to speculate that the CNV was related to the vascular occlusive process.

CD008081,0,10896334,0,The historical discovery of macular edema.,"The occurrence of macular edema, or of intraretinal fluid in general, was largely unknown prior to the invention of the ophthalmoscope. One of the first reports on 'Retinitis in Glycosuria', a disease complex, which today would partly be described as diabetic maculopathy, was published in 1856 by Jaeger. His observations were confirmed less than twenty years later by Nettleship in London, and in 1875 Appolinaire Bouchardat from Paris described fluid and lipid accumulation in the macula which led--in his words--to a glucose induced amblyopia. The first pathophysiological hypotheses of fluid accumulation in the posterior pole were then put forward in 1882 by Tartuferi, who thought the edema represented swelling of photoreceptor sheaths. In 1896, the Frenchman Nuel coined the term 'oedème maculaire' which he had observed in a retinitis pigmentosa patient. However, it was not until the end of the first World War, that the Swiss ophthalmologist Alfred Vogt observed macular edema in a variety of other ocular conditions such as iridocyclitiOFF macular edema to a macular hole. A quarter of a century later Bangerter coined the German term 'Zystoides Makulaödem', and in 1950, Hruby was the first to draw attention to the development of macular edema after cataract extraction. Three years later this was followed by Irvine's classical paper on cystoid macular edema after intra- and extracapsular cataract extraction which had been complicated by incarceration of the vitreous in the anterior segment with consecutive tugging on the macula. A decade later, the phenomenon of cystic fluid accumulation in the macula after cataract extraction was further characterised by Gass and Norton using fluorescein angiography. The ensuing years saw the emergence of new concepts regarding the blood-retinal barrier and the paramount role of its dysfunction in the development of macular edema."
CD008081,0,17142144,0,Association of manganese superoxide dismutase gene polymorphism (V16A) with diabetic macular edema in Korean type 2 diabetic patients.,"This study was designed to investigate whether V16A polymorphism of the manganese superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) gene is associated with the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus and with progression of diabetic retinopathy (DR) and diabetic macular edema (DME). We simultaneously analyzed insertion/deletion polymorphism of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene in the 16th intron to avoid its confounding effect. A total of 192 nondiabetic subjects and 304 type 2 diabetic patients were included in the study. Diabetic retinopathy was classified as nonretinopathy, nonproliferative retinopathy, and proliferative retinopathy. Diabetic macular edema was defined as thickening of the retina and/or hard exudates within a 1-disk diameter of the center of the macula. Diabetic macular edema was further classified into focal, diffuse, and ischemic types. The A allele frequency of the Mn-SOD gene was not different between nondiabetic and type 2 diabetic subjects, between the normotensive and hypertensive groups, between the DR (-) and DR (+) groups, and among the stages of DR. In the DR (+) group, the DME (+) group had a lower A allele frequency than that of the DME (-) group. In the DME (+) group, focal, diffuse, and ischemic types were found in 8, 23, and 6 patients, respectively. The A allele frequency of each type was 0.188, 0.109, and 0.0. The D allele frequency of the angiotensin-converting enzyme gene did not differ in any of the comparisons. Clinical and laboratory parameters of the A allele carriers were not different from those of the noncarriers except for the prevalence of hypertension and DME. Hypertension, diabetic duration, and insulin therapy were related to DR. The A allele, hypertension, and insulin therapy were associated with DME. In conclusion, our results suggest that V16A polymorphism of the Mn-SOD gene is not related to the development of diabetes and progression of DR, but is associated with DME in Korean type 2 diabetic patients."

The instrument is an advanced imaging technique that provides unprecedented high resolution and cross-sectional tomographic images of the ocular microstructure in situ, and in real time. Since its introduction about four years ago, a multitude of advantages has made OCT an essential instrument in ophthalmic imaging. The technique has fast image acquisition speed and non-contact, non-invasive applicability, allowing a non-excisional 'optical biopsy' to be performed. The purpose of this paper is to provide an evidence-based review of the increasing role of OCT in the diagnosis and management of ocular disorders, particularly in age-related macular degeneration, diabetic macular oedema, macular hole, epiretinal membrane and glaucoma. Being one of the first users of OCT in Australia, our clinical experiences will be highlighted and clinical examples of various conditions will be presented to provide an overview of the immense implications of OCT in practice. The latest developments of the OCT revolution, in relation to combining OCT with fundus photography and scanning laser ophthalmoscopy, will also be described.

In this prospective case series we investigated the efficacy and safety of anti-VEGF treatment in reduction of central retinal thickness (CRT) and improvement in visual acuity (VA) in patients with diabetic macular edema (DME). 9 patients were followed up for 6 months and treated monthly with intravitreal ranibizumab. VA and CRT were measured at each visit. Treatment was discontinued as the peak improvement of either parameter was reached and reinstituted in case of deterioration/recurrence of edema. Study endpoints included: VA using ETDRS chart, CRT and number of injections at 6 months. Mean VA from all 9 patients increased by 0.3 lines of logMAR (p < 0.05 compared to baseline), and CRT decreased from 515 +/- 123 microm to 310 +/- 110 microm. The improvement of VA after ranibizumab injection was in correlation with a decrease in CRT. Mean of 4 injections were needed to control the disease during the follow-up period. Ranibizumab treatment was effective in VA and reducing CRT. Several injections were needed to control the disease. Regular OCT examinations and retreatment are advised in order to maintain initially reached VA."

CD008081,0,12507629,0,Mechanisms for monitoring changes in retinal status following therapeutic intervention in diabetic retinopathy.,"Trials of new compounds (e.g., protein kinase C inhibitors) for the treatment of diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular edema historically have used tools such as seven-field stereoscopic fundus photography to grade retinopathy, and endpoints such as the need for retinal photocoagulation to evaluate efficacy. Improvements in diabetes care have led to slower spontaneous progression of retinopathy than anticipated, however. A consequence of this trend is that clinical trials for diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular edema are expected to last for many years and require large numbers of patients before evidence-based conclusions can be made. Therefore, interest in new assessment tools is growing. This review briefly describes the basic pathophysiologic factors involved in the pathogenesis of diabetic macular edema to provide a basis for the introduction of new quantitative and objective endpoints. Special consideration is given to measuring fluorescein permeability of the blood-retinal barrier. The quantitative measurement of retinal thickness using optical coherence tomography is a promising noninvasive method. Microaneurysm counts, assessment of length and diameter of retinal vessels, and computerized quantification of all pathologic elements may also be useful as diagnostic tools and/or efficacy endpoints."

One-hundred and thirty-six eyes with diabetic retinopathy were analyzed with OCT to explore the different patterns of DME. Some eyes with DME were studied with OCT pre and postoperatively to determine the efficacy of photocoagulation and vitrectomy to restore a normal macular profile. Sixty-eight eyes with a central foveal thickness of 200 mu or more were considered ""edematous"". Three different patterns of DME were recognized and analyzed: macular thickening, cystoid macular edema and shallow retinal detachment. The change in macular profile and internal retinal structure after laser or surgical treatment are well visible with OCT. OCT contributes in understanding the anatomy of DME and the intraretinal damage and seems to be the technique of choice for the follow-up of macular edema. We think that this tool should always be used in monitoring the effect of therapies in future studies."

CD008081,0,22539259,0,Microcystic macular oedema in multiple sclerosis is associated with disease severity.,"Macular oedema typically results from blood-retinal barrier disruption. It has recently been reported that patients with multiple sclerosis treated with FTY-720 (fingolimod) may exhibit macular oedema. Multiple sclerosis is not otherwise thought to be associated with macular oedema except in the context of comorbid clinical uveitis. Despite a lack of myelin, the retina is a site of inflammation and microglial activation in multiple sclerosis and demonstrates significant neuronal and axonal loss. We unexpectedly observed microcystic macular oedema using spectral domain optical coherence tomography in patients with multiple sclerosis who did not have another reason for macular oedema. We therefore evaluated spectral domain optical coherence tomography images in consecutive patients with multiple sclerosis for microcystic macular oedema and examined correlations between macular oedema and visual and ambulatory disability in a cross-sectional analysis. Participants were excluded if there was a comorbidity that could account for the presence of macular oedema, such as uveitis, diabetes or other retinal disease. A microcystic pattern of macular oedema was observed on optical coherence tomography in 15 of 318 (4.7%) patients with multiple sclerosis. No macular oedema was identified in 52 healthy controls assessed over the same period. The microcystic oedema predominantly involved the inner nuclear layer of the retina and tended to occur in small, discrete patches. Patients with multiple sclerosis with microcystic macular oedema had significantly worse disability [median Expanded Disability Score Scale 4 (interquartile range 3-6)] than patients without macular oedema [median Expanded Disability Score Scale 2 (interquartile range 1.5-3.5)], P = 0.0002. Patients with multiple sclerosis with microcystic macular oedema also had higher Multiple Sclerosis Severity Scores, a measure of disease progression, than those without oedema [median of 6.47 (interquartile range 4.96-7.98) versus 3.65 (interquartile range 1.92-5.87), P = 0.0009]. Microcystic macular oedema occurred more commonly in eyes with prior optic neuritis than eyes without prior optic neuritis (50 versus 27%) and was associated with lower visual acuity (median logMAR acuity of 0.17 versus -0.1) and a thinner retinal nerve fibre layer. The presence of microcystic macular oedema in multiple sclerosis suggests that there may be breakdown of the blood-retinal barrier and tight junction integrity in a part of the nervous system that lacks myelin. Microcystic macular oedema may also contribute to visual dysfunction beyond that explained by nerve fibre layer loss. Microcystic changes need to be assessed, and potentially adjusted for, in clinical trials that evaluate macular volume as a marker of retinal ganglion cell survival. These findings also have implications for clinical monitoring in patients with multiple sclerosis on sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulating agents."

CD008081,0,2064492,0,Improved detection and referral of patients with diabetic retinopathy by primary care physicians. Effectiveness of education.,"We studied the effect of a 4-hour course in recognition and management of diabetic retinopathy on the ability of nonophthalmologist physicians to detect and to appropriately refer patients with sight-threatening diabetic retinopathy. Participants completed a written examination covering case management and performed a total of 340 dilated ophthalmoscopic examinations on selected patients before and 2 weeks following the teaching session. Accuracy of ophthalmoscopy was assessed by comparison with standardized grading of fundus photographs. Scores on the written examination increased from a mean of 49% to 78% correct. The likelihood of failing to detect and appropriately refer patients with proliferative or preproliferative retinopathy decreased from 60% to 15%. Similarly, for patients with maculopathy, the likelihood of failure to detect and to appropriately refer decreased from 83% to 15.6%. These data suggest that education may significantly improve the ability of nonophthalmologists to detect and to appropriately refer patients who are at risk for vision loss."

CD008081,0,18330892,0,Topical administration of a multi-targeted kinase inhibitor suppresses choroidal neovascularization and retinal edema.,"Age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, and retinal vein occlusions are complicated by neovascularization and macular edema. Multi-targeted kinase inhibitors that inhibit select growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases and/or components of their down-stream signaling cascades (such as Src kinases) are rationale treatment strategies for these disease processes. We describe the discovery and characterization of two such agents. TG100572, which inhibits Src kinases and selected receptor tyrosine kinases, induced apoptosis of proliferating endothelial cells in vitro. Systemic delivery of TG100572 in a murine model of laser-induced choroidal neovascularization (CNV) caused significant suppression of CNV, but with an associated weight loss suggestive of systemic toxicity. To minimize systemic exposure, topical delivery of TG100572 to the cornea was explored, and while substantial levels of TG100572 were achieved in the retina and choroid, superior exposure levels were achieved using TG100801, an inactive prodrug that generates TG100572 by de-esterification. Neither TG100801 nor TG100572 were detectable in plasma following topical delivery of TG100801, and adverse safety signals (such as weight loss) were not observed even with prolonged dosing schedules. Topical TG100801 significantly suppressed laser-induced CNV in mice, and reduced fluorescein leakage from the vasculature and retinal thickening measured by optical coherence tomography in a rat model of retinal vein occlusion. These data suggest that TG100801 may provide a new topically applied treatment approach for ocular neovascularization and retinal edema."

It was recently proposed that OCT data embeds functional information from the human retina. Specifically, it was proposed that blood-retinal barrier status information is present within OCT data. Following this rationale, in this work we illustrate (based on support vector machines) the possibility to discriminate between eyes from healthy volunteers, eyes from type 2 diabetic patients with no signs of diabetic retinopathy (ETDRS level 10 eyes) and eyes diagnosed with diabetic macular edema, thus confirming the presence within OCT data of information on the BRB status."

CD008081,0,20556548,0,Optical coherence tomography imaging for diabetic retinopathy and macular edema.,"Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a noninvasive imaging modality that uses low-coherent interferometry to visualize an optical cross-section of biological tissues. Over the past two decades, the ability to perform OCT imaging of the neural retina has afforded clinicians and researchers a highly reproducible method of diagnosing and following diabetic macular edema (DME) that compares favorably to other methods of DME assessment such as clinical examination and fundus photography. Although central subfield mean thickness has been the OCT parameter most commonly used to evaluate DME in clinical research trials, OCT also allows evaluation of morphologic changes that occur in DME, including compact retinal thickening, intraretinal cystic changes, subretinal fluid, and vitreomacular traction. OCT parameters have been shown to be only moderately correlated with visual acuity. However, improvements in technology leading to higher resolution, faster acquisition speed, image registration, and three-dimensional imaging that are available with newer spectral domain OCT models may allow future identification of valid OCT-derived surrogate markers for visual function in patients with diabetes."

Following treatment with 1.25 mg of intravitreal bevacizumab, reduction in macular leakage was shown by fluorescein angiography and resolution of edema was shown by optical coherence tomography (OCT); however, visual acuity deteriorated and fluorescein angiograms demonstrated progressive enlargement of the foveal avascular zone (FAZ), which had shown no abnormalities before the injection. Despite normalisation of macular thickness on OCT and cessation of leakage on angiography, visual acuity remained at the same level until 6 months of follow-up. Intravitreal bevacizumab must be used with caution in patients with chronic, persistent diabetic macular edema. Disruption of the fragile fine foveal network of capillaries with induction of macular ischemia may result following treatment even if there are no pre-existing defects in the FAZ and may be responsible for non-improvement or decrease in visual acuity."

CD008081,0,15963467,0,Functional VEGF C-634G polymorphism is associated with development of diabetic macular edema and correlated with macular retinal thickness in type 2 diabetes.,"Since vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has a strong effect on induction of vascular permeability, VEGF is an attractive candidate gene for development of diabetic macular edema (ME). Among the 378 patients with type 2 diabetes studied, 203 patients had no retinopathy, 93 had non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR), and 82 had proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). ME was present in 16 patients with NPDR and 47 patients with PDR. We genotyped three VEGF polymorphisms: C-2,578A, G-1,154A, and C-634G. Genotype and allele distribution of C-634G, but not C-2,578A or G-1,154A, were significantly different between patients with and without diabetic retinopathy. Logistic regression analysis revealed that the C-634G genotype was a risk factor for DR (p = 0.002), and furthermore for ME (p = 0.047), independently from severity of DR, with the -634C allele increasing the risk. Macular thickness measured by optical coherence tomography was correlated with the C-634G genotype, with the trend increasing with the presence of more -634C alleles (p = 0.006). Stepwise regression analysis showed that duration of diabetes and presence of the C-634G genotype were independent predictors of macular thickness. In addition, basic transcriptional activity levels associated with the -634C allele were greater compared to those seen with the -634G allele in human glioma and lymphoblastic T-lymphocyte cells. These results demonstrate that the VEGF C-634G polymorphism is a genetic risk factor for ME as well as DR."

This study was aimed at comparing the relative utility of fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA) with ophthalmoscopy (OPT) in its diagnosis with a cross-sectional cohort. A total of 100 patients of type 2 diabetes mellitus was divided into 3 groups depending on the duration from initial diagnosis and matched by important risk factors. Group A was < 5 years duration and had 31 patients; group B ranged between 5 and 15 years and had 40 patients; and group C were > 15 years with 29 patients. Parameters compared were: Normal retina (NR), background diabetic retinopathy (BDR), preproliferative diabetic retinopathy (PPR), proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR); and clinically significant maculopathy (MAC). Dye leakage (DL) and micro-aneurysms (MA) were assessed separately as they are recognised early markers of DR. Result analysis revealed that FFA is well correlated with OPT (0.99) for all groups except group A, where DL (35.5%) played a significant role in altering the correlation (0.85 versus 0.98--OPT versus FFA); 8% of total patients revealed a worse grade with FFA compared to OPT, so appropriate grading of retinopathy is better with FFA at any duration. Less severe varieties of DR predominate in all the groups (BDR-77.4%, 80%, 24.1% respectively), more severe varieties dominate in group C (17.2% and 58.6% of PPR and PDR respectively). MAC is present significantly in group C. FFA is strongly advised, at least in the high-risk groups, at initial diagnosis for detection of DL and also appropriate grading. OPT is a simple and adequate option beyond 5 years of duration. OPT is as good as FFA for the diagnosis of MAC."

CD008081,0,1595515,0,Retinal vein occlusion.,"Retinal vein occlusion is a common form of retinal vascular disease, especially in middle-aged and older individuals. The diagnosis is based on the funduscopic finding of retinal vein dilatation in association with retinal hemorrhages and cotton-wool spots. The pathology can involve the entire venous system or can be limited to a branch of the central retinal vein. Retinal vein occlusion can be distinguished clinically from diabetic retinopathy and other retinal diseases. Treatment for the acute phase of retinal vein occlusion has been disappointing. However, some late complications, such as persistent macular edema and neovascularization of the iris and retina, respond well to retinal photocoagulation. The family physician has an important role in detecting and controlling risk factors for retinal vein occlusion, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus and hyperviscosity syndromes."
CD008081,0,15325193,0,Macular edema.,"Macular edema is the final common pathway of many intraocular and systemic insults. It may develop in a diffuse pattern where the macula appears generally thickened or it may acquire the characteristic petaloid appearance referred to as cystoid macular edema. Although macular edema may be associated with protean underlying conditions, it is most commonly seen following intraocular surgery, venous occlusive disease, diabetic retinopathy, and posterior segment inflammatory disease. As well as clinical suspicion, a wide range of investigations may lead to the diagnosis of macular edema. Fluorescein angiography and optical coherence tomography provide enhanced visualization of the geometry and distribution of macular edema. A variety of approaches to the treatment of macular edema have been attempted, with a variable degree of success. These options have included topical and systemic steroids, topical and oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents and laser photocoagulation treatment. More recently other therapeutic modalities, including immunomodulators, intravitreal injection of triamcinolone, and pars plana vitrectomy have also been employed. Clinical trials are currently looking into the use of a steroid slow-release intravitreal device for the management of macular edema secondary to uveitis and diabetes. This article reviews the clinical entity of macular edema focusing on the current therapeutic strategies for its management."
CD008081,0,21090999,0,Ocular coherence tomography and diabetic eye disease.,"Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is a high-resolution, cross-sectional imaging technique that allows detailed assessment of retinal thickness and morphologic evaluation of the neurosensory retinal layers. OCT imaging has rapidly been integrated into diagnosis and management of diabetic macular edema (DME) in routine clinical practice and clinical trials. OCT findings correlate well with other evaluation techniques for DME. Although there is a moderate correlation between OCT measured retinal thickness and visual acuity, OCT cannot replace visual acuity because there is a high degree of variability. Recent improvements in OCT technology have led to widespread interest in the use of spectral domain OCT, which is faster and has higher resolution than time domain OCT. Future research in OCT imaging will likely result in improvements in image quality. The ability to combine OCT with other various diagnostic modalities will further improve the evaluation of DME in both clinical practice and trials."

Twenty patients with moderate nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) with persistent CSMO underwent PPV. Patients had baseline and postoperative clinical assessment including Ocular Coherence Tomography (OCT). Baseline vitreous and aqueous and serial postoperative aqueous samples were analysed for vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A), pigment epithelium derived Factor (PEDF) and other factors (pg/ml) including hepatocyte growth factor, MMP 9, soluble flt-1 Receptor, and TGF beta1 by ELISA. Vitreous from patients with full thickness macular holes (8) and proliferative diabetic retinopathy (22) were collected for comparison as controls. Vitreous VEGF-A concentration in the NPDR group was 957 pg/ml compared to 239 pg/ml in the macula hole (FTMH) control (p < 0.0001) and 596 pg/ml compared to PDR (p = 0.006). The median diabetic vitreous PEDF concentration was 1.36 microg/ml (FTMH 2.6 microg/ml p = 0.05). In NPDR, it was higher (1.59 microg/ml) than PDR (1.27 microg/ml) p = 0.02. There were changes to the HGF, soluble flt-1 Receptor and TGF b1 concentrations in the NPDR compared to either PDR or the normal state. In CSMO, two OCT profiles were identified: dome-shaped macular elevation (Group 1) (n = 4) and diffuse-low elevation profile (Group 2) (n = 16) which also showed differences in the postoperative median aqueous VEGF concentrations despite macular volume decreasing for both. The results suggest that there is an up-regulation of VEGF in the vitreous of the diabetic eye with a reciprocal decrease in PEDF. The structural and molecular differences between the two OCT macular profiles may explain the varying response to PPV in patients with diffuse CSMO."

Medical records of patients who received IVTA (4 mg/0.1 mL) for DME were reviewed. Optically non-reflective areas which appear dark spaces within the 1000 μm from the center of the macula on OCT scan defined as MH. Best corrected logarithm of minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) visual acuity, CMT as determined by optical coherence tomography (OCT) and MH quantified from the OCT scans by using metamorph analysis were evaluated before the injection and at 1, 3 and 6 months in all, and up to 12 months in some eyes, after the IVTA injection. The correlations between these variables were also studied. 28 eyes of 27 patients were included in the study. Eyes with DME treated by a single IVTA injection responded with a trend towards significant improvement in logMAR VA at 1 (p < 0.0001) and 3 months (p < 0.0001), but no significant improvement in relation to baseline at 6 months was observed (p = 0.07). CMT was significantly reduced at 1 month (p < 0.0001), 3 months (p < 0.0001) and 6 months (p = 0.01) compared to baseline. Like the trend observed in VA improvement, MH also significantly reduced at 1 month (p < 0.0001) and 3 months (p < 0.0001), but not at 6 months (p = 0.14) compared to baseline. There was no correlation between the VA ratio and the CMT ratio (r = 0.18, p = 0.36), but there was a significant correlation between the VA ratio and the MH ratio (r = 0.85, p < 0.0001). There was also an inverse relationship between MH ratio and the age of the patients (r = -0.7089, p = 0.0001). Macular hydration seems to be a better parameter than macular thickness for determining the effectiveness of IVTA treatment in a subset of eyes with DME.

The development of VA from the baseline examination until the last checkup in treated eyes is reported. This classification showed a better visual outcome after photocoagulation in eyes with a decreased VA at baseline (groups 1, 2) compared with eyes with a good initial VA (groups 3, 4). The difference in visual outcome between the second and third groups as well as between the third and fourth groups was statistically significant (p < or = 0.001).

However, there is an increasing demand for high-resolution imaging of ocular tissues to improve the diagnosis and management of diabetic retinopathy. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) provides important additional information about the retina. It produces reliable, reproducible and objective retinal images especially in diabetic macular edema and provides information about vitreoretinal relationships that can clearly only be detected with OCT. It enhances the ability to exactly diagnose diabetic macular edema, epiretinal membranes, vitreomacular or vitroretinal traction. OCT also brings new insights into morphological changes of the retina in diabetic retinopathy. It demonstrates that macular edema is a complex clinical entity with various morphology. With the OCT, structural changes and quantitative assessment of macular edema have become feasible as determined with retinal thickness and volume. OCT is more sensitive to small changes in retinal thickness than slit-lamp biomicroscopy."

We examined a most risky factor for CSDME in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and diabetic retinopathy (DR) confirmed using optical coherence tomography by multiple regression analysis (MRA). As the risk factors, wakening-up BP was added to such factors. Seven diabetic Japanese patients with CSDME (group 1) and 124 subjects without CSDME (group 2) assonated with DR using optical coherence tomography were studied. The durations of T2DM in groups 1 and 2 were 15±10 years and 20±15 years, respectively. There was no statistically difference in means of gender, duration, age, body mass index (BMI), HbA1c, TC, LDL and TC/HDL, serum creatinine, urinary albumin excretion rate, and clinic BP between two groups. Morning systolic home BP (MSHBP), cigarette smoking and foveal thickness were significantly (p<0.001) higher in group 1 than group 2, whereas visual acuity was significantly (p<0.00?) lower in group 1 than in group 2. The patients in both groups had received various kinds of drugs for hyperglycemia, hypertension and others. There were no significant differences in the variables in both groups. MRA revealed that MSHBP, cigarette smoking and pioglitazone as TZD treatment were significantly positive predictors for CSDME, while BMI had a significantly negative predictor. Other variables were not significantly correlated to CSDME. The review summarizes a multiple regression analysis revealed that MSHBP makes an addition to predictive factors for CSDME among risk factors reported previously in patient with T2DM."

CD008081,0,17229183,0,Diabetic macular oedema: a clinical overview.,"Diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of blindness in working aged-adults in westernised countries. Diabetic macular oedema (DMO) is a manifestation of diabetic retinopathy and is the leading cause of the visual impairment that occurs with diabetic retinopathy. There are multiple ways of classifying DMO; however, none appear to be wholly satisfactory. DMO occurs more frequently in type 2 diabetes mellitus, and appears to be more prevalent as the duration of diabetes increases, and as the severity of diabetic retinopathy worsens. There are multiple risk factors in common with diabetic retinopathy, such as hyperglycaemia, hypertension and dyslipidaemia; however, specific factors such as the presence of renal disease appear to be more significantly associated with DMO. Whereas the gold standard for diagnosis of DMO is via clinical examination, there is considerable variability involved, and hence, this has led to the advent of more objective methods of quantifying the degree of retinal thickness, such as optical coherence tomography. Laser photocoagulation appears to be the only universally acceptable treatment of choice to date; however, this is a destructive therapy, and its side effects coupled with the suboptimal efficacy has led to the advent of potential new therapies which will undoubtedly compliment the existing approaches, in the future management of a patient with DMO."

In this paper, we describe 6 patients with CME and 1 patient with diabetic macular edema (DME), all of whom were treated with nepafenac 0.1%, a novel prodrug NSAID. Three (3) patients with acute CME following cataract surgery were treated for 3-4 weeks with nepafenac 0.1%, with or without concomitant steroids. Both retinal thickness and visual acuity improved in all 3 cases. The 3 patients with chronic CME, each of whom had been previously treated with steroids with or without concomitant NSAID therapy, were started on nepafenac 0.1% three times daily. Retinal thickness and visual acuity improved in each case, except for 1 patient with 20/25 pretreatment visual acuity. The mean improvement in visual acuity of all 6 CME patients was 2.5 lines and the mean decrease in retinal thickness was 282.8 microm.

To correlate retinal structural derangement with retinal sensitivity alterations in cases with diabetic macular edema, using SDOCT and MP. Prospective study of 34 eyes of 30 patients with DME. All patients underwent comprehensive ophthalmic examination, fluorescein angiography, microperimetry and SDOCT. Four distinct morphological patterns of DME were identified- diffuse retinal thickening (DRT), cystoid macular edema (CME), schitic retinal thickening (SRT) and neurosensory detachment (NSD) of fovea. Some retinal loci presented with a mixture of above patterns There was significant difference in retinal thickness between groups (P<0.001). Focal retinal sensitivity measurement revealed relatively preserved retinal sensitivity in areas with DRT (13.8 dB), moderately reduced sensitivity (7.9 dB) in areas with CME, and gross retinal sensitivity loss in areas with SRT (1.2 dB) and NSD (4.7 dB) (P<0.001). Analysis of regional scotoma depth demonstrated similar pattern. Retinal sensitivity showed better correlation to OCT pattern (r=-0.68, P<0.001) than retinal thickness (r=-0.44, P<0.001).

CD008081,0,17417154,0,[Optical coherence tomography follow-up of a case of solar maculopathy].,"Solar maculopathy is caused by sun-gazing without protection and in most cases appears to be reversible. Retinal damage may be caused by photochemical changes combined with a rise in temperature at the time of sun observation. We report a case of bilateral solar retinopathy following direct sun gazing after observation of the partial eclipse on 3 October 2005. A 25-year-old Caucasian man presented 24 h after watching the eclipse with symptoms of blurred vision and a bright positive central scotoma. Total direct viewing time was approximately 5 min. While observing the eclipse, the patient kept both eyes open. On presentation, his visual acuity was 20/25 in his right eye and 20/32 in his left eye. Ophthalmoscopic examination revealed a bilateral yellowish-white spot in the center of the foveal region. Static visual field examination did not disclose any absolute scotoma but a decrease in the foveal threshold was noted in both eyes. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) examination revealed a bilateral increased reflectivity of the inner foveal retina that was greater in the left eye. This finding was associated with a hyporeflective area of the underlying retinal pigment epithelium: choriocapillaris complex and an increase in retinal thickness. Eight days later, visual acuity was 20/20 in each eye. Funduscopy showed the yellow lesion had vanished. Four months after exposure, funduscopy was normal and OCT scan showed normal reflectivity of all retinal layers in the fovea. However, static visual field examination disclosed a decreased foveal threshold on the left eye. We compare the OCT findings in this patient with the data reported in the literature. Indeed, various OCT findings have been reported depending on the intensity and frequency of sun exposure. This observation demonstrates that OCT appears to be potentially useful in the evolutive follow-up of solar maculopathy, and emphasizes the importance of eye safety during solar eclipse observation."

More effective and stable treatments for ocular neovascularization are needed, yet there are major limitations in the present animal models. To develop primate models of diabetic retinopathy and choroidal neovascularization, rhesus monkeys were injected subretinally or intravitreally with an adeno-associated virus (AAV)-2 vector carrying the cDNA encoding human vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Overexpression of VEGF was measured by intraocular fluid sampling over time. Neovascularization was evaluated by ophthalmoscopy through angiography, optical coherence tomography, and ultimately histopathology.

This paper reports the rare occurrence of unilateral macular edema with visual loss. We present an interventional case report with fundus photograph and optical coherence tomography (OCT). A 48-year-old white male with hepatitis C, treated with a six-month course of pegylated interferon alpha and ribavirin, complained of gradual reduction in the vision of his left eye. Visual acuities were 20/16 right and 20/400 left with clinical examination and OCT confirming cystoid macular edema. This report shows that cystoid macular edema may rarely occur in association with hepatitis C infection and/or interferon therapy. Physicians and ophthalmologists should be alert to this potential but infrequent association as the resultant visual loss is a significant potential complication that should be discussed when obtaining informed consent for interferon treatment."

CD008081,0,19757353,0,[Surgical treatment of diabetic macular oedema].,"The therapy for diabetic macular oedema often remains unsatisfactory for both patient and treating physician. Therapeutic approaches comprise laser therapy as the evidence-based ""basic therapy"" and increasingly also intravitreal injections of drugs which, however, have only a limited effect. One argument for the use of vitrectomy in the treatment of diabetic macular oedema is its potentially permanent positive effect. On the one hand, removal of the adherent vitreous may facilitate the supply of the inner retina ""per diffusionem"" from the vitreous, on the other hand it may allow movement of harmful cytokines from the retina into the vitreous also by diffusion. Furthermore, from the pathophysiological standpoint, the vitreoretinal interface itself is modified by glycosylation processes and may thereby contribute to the occurrence of macular oedema. Pathological vitreofoveolar adhesions, which now can be visualised by use of ocular coherence tomography, may also add to the development of macular oedema in a mechanical-tractive manner. A critical analysis of the published clinical studies reveals that the macular retinal thickness is indeed reduced after vitrectomy, disappointingly however, this does not translate into better visual acuity in patients without detectable tractive components. But, in the case of eyes with tractive components of the diabetic macular oedema, there is good evidence for a surgical approach."

The pathogenesis of BRVO is thought to involve both retinal vein compression and damage to the vessel wall, possibly leading to thrombus formation at sites where retinal arterioles cross retinal veins. The most common cause of visual loss in patients with BRVO is macular oedema (MO). Grid or focal laser photocoagulation has been shown to reduce the risk of visual loss and improve visual acuity (VA) in up to two thirds of individuals with MO secondary to BRVO, however, limitations to this treatment exist and newer modalities have suggested equal or improved efficacy. Recently, antiangiogenic therapy with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) has been used successfully to treat MO resulting from a variety of causes.

CD008081,0,10896343,0,The pathogenesis and clinical presentation of macular edema in inflammatory diseases.,"Cystoid macular edema (CME) is a classical complication of ocular inflammation. This syndrome was already described by Irvine in 1953 but the pathogenesis of this condition remains unclear. Cystoid macular edema can result either from a rupture of the inner or from the outer blood ocular barrier. Clinical CME that is responsible for a low visual acuity must be differentiated from angiographic CME that can be present even without any decrease in visual acuity. Fluid progressively accumulates into the outer plexiform layer of the retina and pools into cystic spaces. Fluid accumulation can now be better seen with optical coherence tomography (OCT). In chronic CME fluid accumulation is associated with thinning of the retina and fibrosis. At this stage irreversible lesions are present and CME does not respond to medical therapies. Inflammatory CME must be differentiated from CME resulting from irreversible vascular damage such as in diabetic CME or due to vein occlusions. Experimental research on cystoid macular edema has been hampered by the lack of animal model: most of laboratory animals have no macula, monkeys appear to be highly resistant to macular edema. Five major causes have been suspected to be at the origin of CME: (1) photic retinopathy, (2) trauma of ocular tissue, (3) secondary irritation of the ciliary body, (4) vitreous traction and (5) pharmaceutically induced CME. Clinical experience has shown that pseudophakic CME usually responds well to local therapy of steroids and non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and/or in association with systemic acetazolamide. Acetazolamide is increasing fluid resorption through the retinal pigment epithelium. Postoperative CME rarely needs additional posterior subtenon's injections to resolve. But in CME occurring secondary to uveitis additional posterior sub-Tenon's steroid injections or systemic steroids may be necessary to decrease the constant release of inflammatory mediators."
CD008081,0,11309739,0,Vitrectomy for refractory diabetic macular edema.,"Diabetic macular edema may occur or worsen as a consequence of vitreomacular traction in some eyes. The precise role of the posterior hyaloid in the pathogenesis of diabetic maculopathy remains unclear. The determination of which eyes might benefit from vitrectomy is the most challenging aspect in the treatment of this condition. Fluorescein angiography, B-scan untrasonography, and optical coherence tomography may be helpful in this regard. Most often, vitreous surgery is performed when diabetic macular edema persists despite multiple laser treatments. All reports published to date regarding vitrectomy for diabetic macular edema are uncontrolled and nonrandomized patient series. Visual improvement after vitrectomy is related to the duration of edema, as well as the extent of intraretinal lipid and vascular nonperfusion."

CD008081,0,10896349,0,Novel imaging techniques for diabetic macular edema.,"Retinal edema should be defined as any increase of water of the retinal tissue resulting in an increase in its volume. It may be of cytotoxic or vasogenic origin. Development of vasogenic macular edema is dependent on a series of factors such as blood pressure, blood-retinal barrier permeability, retinal cell damage, retinal tissue osmotic pressure and retinal tissue compliance. Objective measurements of retinal thickness are now possible using the Retinal Thickness Analyser. Localised measurements of blood-retinal barrier permeability may also be obtained using the Retinal Leakage Analyser, a modified confocal scanning laser fluorometer, while obtaining simultaneously angiographic images of the choroid and retina. These new imaging techniques show that cytotoxic and vasogenic retinal edema may occur independently in the early stages of diabetic retinopathy.

Non-full-thickness macular holes have been associated with myriad ocular conditions. Originally, lamellar macular holes were described as secondary to diabetic macular edema and macular pseudoholes as idiopathic. The pathogenesis of secondary non-full-thickness macular defects was recently confirmed by spectral-domain optical coherence tomography. These may be mistaken for macular hole lesions, despite careful clinical examination. Careful biomicroscopic examination with a contact lens and optical coherence tomography help to ensure accurate diagnosis. Surgical management with or without air or gas tamponade improves visual acuity and foveal morphology in most eyes."

A study was conducted to determine whether spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) could be used to detect subthreshold retinal burns created using the 532-nm green wavelength laser. A series of retinal burns of gradually decreasing intensity were created in 10 eyes. Retinal burns produced with duration of laser exposure of 0.03 second or less, although clinically invisible, were detectable on the SD-OCT scan as increased retinal reflectivity confined to the outer retinal layers. This series demonstrates the potential of using SD-OCT imaging to verify delivery of subthreshold laser burns."

Visual acuity and intraocular pressure were also measured. Of 622 patients screened, 149 (24.0%) had background and 32 (5.1%) advanced retinopathy/maculopathy. The fundus was inadequately visualised in four (0.6%) patients. Following screening, 86 (13.8%) patients were referred to the ophthalmology clinic for appropriate treatment and follow up. Hospital-based optometrists using a slit lamp offer a useful new method for screening for diabetic eye disease. They can identify previously unrecognised sight-threatening diabetic eye disease and important non-diabetic eye disease requiring intervention, and are relatively cheap. This method is ideally suited for rapid referral to the specialist. The results merit larger-scale studies both to confirm the effectiveness of this method and to assess whether hospital trained optometrists could perform screening in the community."

CD008081,0,11318279,0,Cystoid macular oedema in uveitis: an unsolved problem.,"Most papers on the subject of CMO associated with uveitis are retrospective, combine patients with different disease aetiologies, at different stages of evolution, and often describe patients who were previous treatment failures with other therapies besides the one under consideration. There are almost no prospective randomised double-masked controlled studies. This is perhaps in part due to the relative sparsity of uveitis patients seen by many uveitis centres. At the moment, treatment is largely empirical, based in large part on the studies, and others, quoted above. The need to regularly repeat courses of therapy, loss of efficacy of certain form of therapy after repeated use, and cumulative side-effects, all need to be taken into consideration when interpreting results and deciding upon the best approach to be adopted. The risks to the patient's well-being increase with the addition of systemic medication, and long-term steroid use can cause hypertension, induce or exacerbate diabetes, cause premature osteoporosis, cushingoid features, peptic ulceration and aseptic necrosis of the femoral head. Immunosuppressive drugs can be nephrotoxic, hepatotoxic, cause hypertension, gastric disturbances and excessive hair growth. The assessment of macular changes, both structurally and functionally, is the key aspect in understanding visual loss in CMO and also in predicting potential visualrecovery. The combined use of the various tools mentioned here, such as SLO, OCT and electrodiagnostic tests, may give us some of the necessary answers in this process. However, all these tests will need to be validated. A prospective analysis of CMO in cases of uveitis, especially if coupled with therapeutic intervention, will give us the opportunity to achieve this objective."

CD008081,0,20703048,0,Postsurgical cystoid macular edema.,"Cystoid macular edema (CME) is a primary cause of reduced vision following both cataract and successful vitreoretinal surgery. The incidence of clinical CME following modern cataract surgery is 0.1-2.35%. Preexisting conditions such as diabetes mellitus and uveitis as well as intraoperative complications can raise the risk of developing CME postoperatively. The etiology of CME is not completely understood. Prolapsed or incarcerated vitreous and postoperative inflammatory processes have been proposed as causative agents. Pseudophakic CME is characterized by poor postoperative visual acuity. Fluorescein angiography is indispensable in the workup of CME, showing the classical perifoveal petaloid staining pattern and late leakage of the optic disk. Optical coherence tomography is a useful diagnostic tool, which displays cystic spaces in the outer nuclear layer. The most important differential diagnoses include age-related macular degeneration and other causes of CME such as diabetic macular edema. Most cases of pseudophakic CME resolve spontaneously. The value of prophylactic treatment is doubtful. First-line treatment of postsurgical CME should include topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and corticosteroids. Oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors can be considered complementary. In cases of resistant CME, periocular or intraocular corticosteroids present an option. Antiangiogenic agents, though experimental, should be considered for nonresponsive persistent CME. Surgical options should be reserved for special indications."
CD008081,0,20703049,0,Retinitis pigmentosa and other dystrophies.,"Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is an inherited retinal degeneration that affects predominantly peripheral visual fields. Macular edema may cause additional central visual acuity decrease. Fluorescein angiography and/or optical coherence tomography detect the presence of macular edema in 10-20% of RP patients. Macular edema can manifest at any stage of the disease and may be unilateral or bilateral. In X-linked forms, macular edema is very rare. The origin of macular edema in RP patients still remains poorly understood. The possible pathophysiological role of autoantibodies has been suggested (retinal, carbonic anhydrase, and enolase antibodies). Drug therapy is the primary treatment for macular edema in patients with R P. Systemic carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, such as oral acetazolamide or topical dorzolamide, still are the mainstay of initial therapy. If cystoid macular edema is refractory to acetazolamide, intravitreal corticosteroid injections could be administered. Intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy has also been used in cases of macular edema persistence after oral acetazolamide therapy, though with uncertain results. Vitrectomy can also be proposed, but its role is not clear yet. Autoimmune retinopathies (AIRs) are a group of rare diseases characterized by acute or subacute progressive vision loss and are thought to be mediated by autoantibodies specific to retinal antigens. The AIRs encompass paraneoplastic syndromes, such as cancer-associated retinopathy and melanoma-associated retinopathy, and a larger group of AIRs that have similar clinical and immunological findings but without underlying malignancy. These diseases may also be complicated by macular edema."

It usually results from the breakdown of the inner blood-retinal barrier. Early detection of retinal abnormalities is vital in preventing diabetic macular oedema and subsequent loss of vision, whilst assessment of retinal thickness is important for treatment and follow-up. Until recently, however, the methods available for detecting and evaluating diabetic macular oedema were slit-lamp biomicroscopy and stereoscopic photography, both of which are limited in detecting earlier retinal changes. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a new diagnostic imaging modality that provides high-resolution, cross-sectional images of the eye. It is proving to be an accurate tool for the early diagnosis, analysis and monitoring of retinopathy, with high repeatability and resolution. It allows not only the qualitative diagnosis of diabetic macular oedema, but also the quantitative assessment of oedema.

Thirty-four eyes of 22 patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy and DME refractory to laser photocoagulation therapy received an intravitreal injection of 1.25 mg/0.05 ml of bevazicumab. Changes in mean best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), central macular thickness (CMT), regression of neovascularization over time, and correlation between BCVA and CMT were evaluated. Follow-up visits were at weeks 1, 2 and 4 and months 3 and 6. Mean BCVA was significantly better than baseline only at week 2 (P = 0.036). Mean CMT decreased significantly from baseline at weeks 1, 2, and 4 (P = 0.001). At months 3 and 6, mean CMT increased, albeit insignificantly (P = 0.804 and P = 1.0). The decrease in fluorescein leakage was moderate in all eyes at the end of week 1. At week 2, there was total resolution of fluorescein leakage in 24 (70.5%) eyes and moderate resolution in 10 (29.5%) eyes. At the end of month 3, the fluorescein leakage was fully resolved in 5 (14.7%) eyes, moderately resolved in 24 (70.5%) eyes, and was similar to baseline in 5 (14.7%) eyes. At month 6, the fluorescein leakage was fully resolved in 3 (8.8%) eyes, moderately resolved in 20 (58.8%) eyes, and was similar to baseline in 11 (32.4%) eyes. A moderate but insignificant negative correlation was found between visual acuity and CMT (P > 0.05).

CD008081,0,12585705,0,A contribution of image processing to the diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy--detection of exudates in color fundus images of the human retina.,"In the framework of computer assisted diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy, a new algorithm for detection of exudates is presented and discussed. The presence of exudates within the macular region is a main hallmark of diabetic macular edema and allows its detection with a high sensitivity. Hence, detection of exudates is an important diagnostic task, in which computer assistance may play a major role. Exudates are found using their high grey level variation, and their contours are determined by means of morphological reconstruction techniques. The detection of the optic disc is indispensable for this approach. We detect the optic disc by means of morphological filtering techniques and the watershed transformation. The algorithm has been tested on a small image data base and compared with the performance of a human grader. As a result, we obtain a mean sensitivity of 92.8% and a mean predictive value of 92.4%.

According to the results of basal fundus photography, patients were divided into two groups, without MDR (48 cases) and with MDR (54 cases). Patients with proliferative DR or macular edema were excluded. No difference was found between patients with or without MDR and the control group for all OCT parameters investigated. Mean HbA1c of the last 5 years (P < 0.001), microalbuminuria (P = 0.002), total (P = 0.046) and LDL cholesterol (P = 0.007) and triglyceride (P < 0.001) levels were higher in patients with MDR, along with higher prevalence of hypertension (P = 0.013), younger age at diagnosis (P = 0.018) and longer diabetes duration (P < 0.001) with regard to the patients without MDR and controls, although no significant correlation between these parameters and RT was found. Our study suggests that MDR without macular edema in patients with T1D cannot be detected with OCT. Therefore, the conventional diagnostic methods are mandatory to detect early DR."

Its use allows more precise evaluation of retinal pathology in DME, including retinal thickness and edema, vitreomacular interface abnormalities, subretinal fluid, and foveal microstructural changes. Additional advantages include its ability to quantitatively monitor response to treatment of DME by laser, intravitreal pharmacotherapies, and vitreoretinal surgery. OCT measurements are now used in all major clinical studies of DME treatment as critical endpoints. This article presents a review of both time-domain and spectral-domain OCT in the diagnosis and management of DME. The authors discuss the various parameters evaluated by the OCT systems and provide an evidence-based evaluation of their accuracy, significance, reliability, and limitations. As the capability of OCT continues to advance, it appears that its use will play an increasingly important role in the understanding, evaluation, and treatment of DME."

The precise mechanisms leading to the development of diabetic retinopathy and the progressive decrease of vision are still undetermined. Recent studies have shown that not only vascular but also neuronal abnormalities are associated with the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy. Because neuronal cell death leads to an irreversible decrease in visual function, early changes in the morphology and physiology of the neural retinas of diabetic patients are important. The alterations of the morphology of the retina can be obtained by high-resolution B-scan optical coherence tomography (OCT). The thickness of the macular area and retinal nerve fiber layer can be measured reliably and accurately by the installed software of OCT instruments. The high-resolution images can be used to evaluate diabetic macular edema and optic nerve damage quantitatively in patients with diabetic retinopathy. This review describes how the OCT measurements can be used to manage patients with diabetic retinopathy. We also present the early retinal changes involved in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy."

Some manifestation of hypertensive retinopathy developed in 19 one-kidney and 19 two-kidney animals, and white deposits formed in 14 and 5 monkeys, respectively. The onset of white deposits showed no correlation to severity of arterial hypertension or of retinopathy. All eyes with white deposits had antecedent macular or retinal edema. The deposits were everchanging, taking months or even more than a year to resolve. Our study suggests that in hypertensive retinopathy the white retinal deposits are most probably the result of exudative and/or neural degenerative processes. All the available pieces of evidence indicate that it is more appropriate to call the white deposits 'lipid deposits' than 'hard exudates'."

Clinically significant macular oedema (CSMO) is the most severe form of DMO. Almost 30 years ago, the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) found that CSMO, diagnosed by means of stereoscopic fundus photography, leads to moderate visual loss in one of four people within three years. It also showed that grid or focal laser photocoagulation to the macula halves this risk. Recently, intravitreal injection of antiangiogenic drugs has been investigated to try to improve vision in people with macular oedema due to DR.Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is based on optical reflectivity and is able to image retinal thickness and structure producing cross-sectional and three-dimensional images of the central retina. It is already widely used because it provides objective and quantitative assessment of macular oedema unlike the subjectivity of fundus biomicroscopic assessment, which is routinely used by ophthalmologists instead of photography. Optical coherence tomography is also used for quantitative follow up of the effects of treatment of CSMO. Disadvantages of using OCT are the cost to purchase it and the need for trained personnel to perform the examinations."

Diabetic maculopathy is the main cause of legal blindness in the adult population in western countries. The examination method involves digital fundus photography that enables comparison of the incidence, number as well as the size and the shape of pathological foci on the retina during patient visits. It, however, does not depict one important change--chronic retinal ischemia. This is identified using contrast imaging--fluorescein angiography (FAG). Administration of a contrast medium--fluorescein--into cubital vein enables depiction of non-perfused regions of the retina that form the basis for laser therapy indication as part of the prevention of proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Optical coherence tomography (OCT), during which an optical beam makes a cross-section through all 10 layers of the retina, is an important advance in the diagnostics of diabetic macular oedema.

To present the vitreoretinal interface in diabetic macular edema (DME) associated with both epiretinal membrane (ERM) and incomplete posterior vitreous detachment (PVD), as detected by spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). METHODS. In a retrospective study, findings were analyzed in one eye in consecutive patients. Excluded were eyes that had undergone vitreoretinal intervention or that had complete PVD or complete vitreous attachment. RESULTS. Of 44 eyes with DME and ERM, incomplete PVD was apparent in 23 (52.2%) eyes. A hyperreflective unified ERM/posterior vitreous cortex (PViC) membrane, or EVi membrane, was apparent in various sizes in 20 (87.0%) of the 23 eyes. This unified membrane (n = 20) was associated with vitreopapillary adherence in 19 (82.6%) of 23 eyes. Two major OCT presentations (n = 23) were encountered: incomplete vitreopapillary detachment (n = 11; 25% of 44), with attachment to the macular ERM, and posterior vitreous detachment from the macula, associated with vitreopapillary adhesion (n = 10; 22.7%), in four different manifestations. In the remaining two eyes, there was no association between the ERM and the PViC. CONCLUSIONS. In eyes with DME, ERM, and incomplete PVD, the posterior cortical vitreous and ERM appeared as one united EVi membrane in various lengths in most eyes, typically associated with vitreopapillary adhesion. These findings may have clinical importance in the context of epimacular membrane characteristics and its removal in DME."

Morphological differences in OCT parameters were established to have impact on the effect of visual rehabilitation. Following 3-4 months of CPE with IOL implantation in DM patients with the areactive type of a macular morphological response to surgical stress, the increase in visual acuity exceeded that observed in the hyperactive and aggressive types of a macular response by 12.8 and 57.7%, respectively.

A simple posterior vitreous detachment was created during pars plana vitrectomy accompanied by simultaneous cataract surgery in 19 eyes of 17 patients with DME. The visual acuity (log MAR units), multifocal electroretinograms (mfERGs), and optical coherence tomographically (OCT)-determined foveal thickness were determined preoperatively and at 6 months postoperatively. The median preoperative log MAR visual acuity was 0.7 (20/100; range, 0.3-1.1), and it improved significantly to 0.4 (20/50; range, 0.15-1.0) postoperatively (p = 0.016). The median foveal thickness was 510 (range, 194-800) microm preoperatively and was significantly reduced to 201 (range, 60-631) microm postoperatively (p =0.0002). The median of response density of the mfERGs in the macular area was 6.3 nV/ deg2 (range, 2.8-14.8) preoperatively, and 6.1 nV/deg2 (range, 2.4-14.3) postoperatively, a non-significant change (p = 0.27). The median of peak latency of the macular response was 30.0 ms (range, 25.0-44.2) preoperatively and it decreased significantly to 28.3 ms (range, 26.7-35.0) postoperatively (p = 0.003). In conclusion, vitrectomy with the creation of a PVD in eyes with DME improved the visual acuity and foveal thickness significantly. In addition, a decrease of the peak latency of the macular mfERGs suggested an improvement of the physiological function of the macula although the amplitude of the mfERGs was not changed significantly."
