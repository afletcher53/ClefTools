CD008759,0,8259482,0,[Hepatosplenic schistosomiasis: case report and clinical review].,"Although seen rarely in Switzerland, schistosomiasis is a parasitosis affecting 200 to 250 million people round the world, mainly in tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, Central and South America. Depending on the parasitic species, the ureters and the bladder (S. haematobium) or the intestine and the liver (S. mansoni, S. japonicum, S. mekongi) are primarily involved. Other organs may be affected (lung, kidneys and central nervous system). Hepatosplenic schistosomiasis represents a special form of chronic infection by S. mansoni, S. japonicum or S. mekongi predominantly occurring in adolescents heavily and repeatedly infected during childhood, together with an additional genetic predisposition for the disease. Hepatosplenic schistosomiasis on a worldwide scale is one of the most prevalent causes of portal hypertension in man. We describe a 33-year-old Portuguese female with mansonian hepatosplenic schistosomiasis 12 years after leaving Africa, who had hepatosplenomegaly, portal hypertension, esophageal varices and hypersplenism. Splenomegaly and slight anemia had been known for years without prompting further work-up. Two months before diagnosis she had been delivered of a normal child after pregnancy without portal-hypertensive complications, namely esophageal hemorrhage. Because of placenta accreta, however, erythrocyte transfusion had been performed after delivery and was possibly responsible for hepatitis C found later on. Pathophysiology, clinical findings and therapy of the disease are discussed."

This report describes subcutaneous transposition of the resected spleen in normal experimental animals with the Vena porta constricted with Ameroid rings and liver cirrhosis induced by DMNA. The report also covers 9 patients operated on from 1972 to 1973 with subcutaneous transposition of the spleen. A 77-year-old woman died postoperatively, one patient died after 2 years 4 months, and one had slight bleeding. All the other patients are alive 2-4 years after the operation, with no signs of renewed bleeding. The advantage of subcutaneous transposition of the spleen is that it eliminates hypersplenism."

NRH may cause non-cirrhotic portal hypertension with potentially severe consequences such as refractory ascites, variceal bleeding and hypersplenism. Obliteration of the small intrahepatic portal veins in association with prothrombotic disorders linked to HIV infection itself or anti-retroviral therapy seem to be the causes of NRH and thus the term HIV-associated obliterative portopathy has been proposed."

Liver biopsy is essential, especially to rule out other processes. Being a disease of unknown etiology, the majority of cases have been described in eastern countries. However, it may be an underdiagnosed disease in the West. Symptoms are related to portal hypertension and the clinical spectrum is wide, ranging from anemia with normal liver function tests to bleeding due to esophageal varices. Treatment is directed to the complications and the prognosis is better than in patients with cirrhosis.We report three cases of HPS presenting at different clinical stages and the findings of liver biopsies, the clinical outcomes and a review of scientific literature."
CD008759,0,2359944,0,"[Portal hypertension in cirrhoses: mechanisms, symptomatology and complications].","Cirrhosis is the most common cause of portal hypertension. This disease creates an intrahepatic block, principally by reducing the volume of sinusoids. Clinically, portal hypertension in cirrhosis is characterized by spleen enlargement, collateral venous circulation and the presence of oesophageal or gastric varices; these signs are frequent but not constant. Ultrasonography is used in the evaluation of all patients with portal hypertension. Beside the presence of oesophageal varices at fibroscopy, it is the best morphological exploration method to visualize portal hypertension. Portal hypertension may be complicated by haemorrhages due to rupture of the oesophageal varices and by ascites or encephalopathy, the latter two complications occurring when liver cell degeneration is associated with portal hypertension."

However, its impact on the outcomes of patients with cirrhosis and acute gastroesophageal variceal bleeding remains unknown.

The main outcomes analyzed were 5-day treatment failure and 6-week mortality."
CD008759,0,23978714,0,Non-cirrhotic portal hypertension - diagnosis and management.,"NCPH is a heterogeneous group of liver disorders of vascular origin, leading to PHT with near normal HVPG. NCPF/IPH is a disorder of young adults or middle aged women, whereas EHPVO is a disorder of childhood. Early age acute or recurrent infections in an individual with thrombotic predisposition constitute the likely pathogenesis. Both disorders present with clinically significant PHT with preserved liver functions. Diagnosis is easy and can often be made clinically with support from imaging modalities. Management centers on control and prophylaxis of variceal bleeding. In EHPVO, there are additional concerns of growth faltering, portal biliopathy, MHE and parenchymal dysfunction. Surgical shunts are indicated in patients with failure of endotherapy, bleeding from sites not amenable to endotherapy, symptomatic hypersplenism or symptomatic biliopathy. Persistent growth failure, symptomatic and recurrent hepatic encephalopathy, impaired quality of life or massive splenomegaly that interferes with daily activities are other surgical indications. Rex-shunt or MLPVB is the recommended shunt for EHPVO, but needs proper pre-operative radiological assessment and surgical expertise. Both disorders have otherwise a fairly good prognosis, but need regular and careful surveillance. Hepatic schistosomiasis, CHF and NRH have similar presentation and comparable prognosis."
CD008759,0,1784058,0,Congenital hepatic fibrosis in Saudi Arabia.,"Congenital hepatic fibrosis (CHF) is a recognized cause of portal hypertension with oesophageal varices, gastro-intestinal haemorrhage and cholangitis in children without significant impairment of hepatic or renal function. This report describes the varied clinical presentation of CHF as seen at King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre (KFSH & RC) and emphasizes the clinical patterns that should enable a pediatrician to consider the diagnosis. Fourteen children with CHF were diagnosed between 1981 and 1988. The age at presentation ranged from 1.8-14 years (mean: 7.5 years); clinical manifestations at diagnosis were splenomegaly (12), hepatomegaly (11), failure to thrive (10), marked abdominal distention (4), and fever (4). Liver function tests were normal except for high alkaline phosphatase. Eight patients had polycystic kidneys confirmed on ultrasound examination. Upper gastro-intestinal endoscopy showed oesophageal varices of variable severity in all eight patients examined. Splenoportography revealed splenic vein occlusion in one patient. One patient died within days of admission with convulsions, coma, and aspiration pneumonia. One patient was lost to follow-up. The remaining 12 patients are all alive and receive regular follow-up. Two patients required splenorenal shunt. In view of the prevalence of consanguinity in Saudi Arabia, the diagnosis of CHF should be considered in children with hepatomegaly despite normal liver function tests, and particularly in those with renal abnormalities and/or evidence of portal hypertension."

CD008759,0,25536638,0,Portal vein thrombosis: what is new?,"Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is one of the most common vascular disorders of the liver with significant morbidity and mortality. Large cohort studies have reported a global prevalence of 1%, but in some risk groups it can be up to 26%. Causes of PVT are cirrhosis, hepatobiliary malignancy, abdominal infectious or inflammatory diseases, and myeloproliferative disorders. Most patients with PVT have a general risk factor. The natural history of PVT results in portal hypertension leading to splenomegaly and the formation of portosystemic collateral blood vessels and esophageal, gastric, duodenal, and jejunal varices. Diagnosis of PVT is made by imaging, mainly Doppler ultrasonography. According to its time of development, localization, pathophysiology, and evolution, PVT should be classified in every patient. Some clinical features such as cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and hepatic transplantation are areas of special interest and are discussed in this review. The goal of treatment of acute PVT is to reconstruct the blocked veins. Endoscopic variceal ligation is safe and highly effective in patients with variceal bleeding caused by chronic PVT. In conclusion, PVT is the most common cause of vascular disease of the liver and its prevalence has being increasing, especially among patients with an underlying liver disease. All patients should be investigated for thrombophilic conditions, and in those with cirrhosis, anticoagulation prophylaxis should be considered."
CD008759,0,6979264,0,"Esophageal varices in Nairobi, Kenya: a study of 68 cases.","Sixty-eight patients with proven esophageal varices wer studied at Kenyatta National Hospital, Nairobi, Kenya. Of these patients, 29.4% had schistosomal portal hypertension, 22.1% cirrhosis and only 8.8% extrahepatic portal vein occlusion. One quarter of the patients had a normal liver biopsy and extrahepatic portal vein that was demonstrated to be patent. Problems relating to liver biopsy sampling resulting in underdiagnosis of specific causes of esophageal varices such as schistosomiasis are discussed. We argue that many of these patients were likely to be suffering from idiopathic portal hypertension, a condition apparently not previously recognized in Africa. Of this last group, 70.6% had suffered gastrointestinal bleeding, as had 50% of the patients with schistosomiasis. Together these two groups accounted for three-quarters of all patients who had bled. The detection of eggs of Schistosoma mansoni in stool and/or rectal snip correlated well with liver biopsy findings in both a positive and negative sense. Only 18% of patients with negative stools and snips had evidence of schistosomiasis in the liver, and positive stools or snips were found in only 14.6% of patients without schistosomal liver involvement. Of the patients in the study, 50% were of the Kamba tribe, although only 12.9% of all medical admissions to the hospital were Kamba (P less than 0.01). Luo patients were significantly more frequent within the group with schistosomiasis (P less than 0.02). Esophageal varices were attributed to tropical splenomegaly syndrome in only one patient. The implications of our results are discussed and our findings are compared with previous work from East Africa."

CD008759,0,18161700,1,Platelet count is not a predictor of the presence or development of gastroesophageal varices in cirrhosis.,"Current guidelines recommend esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) in patients with cirrhosis to screen for gastroesophageal varices (GEV). Thrombocytopenia has been proposed as a noninvasive test to predict the presence of GEV. There is no agreement regarding a specific platelet count (PLT) that can reliably predict GEV. The present longitudinal study aims to (1) further investigate the relationship between varices and PLT at the time of endoscopy, (2) investigate whether changes in PLT from the baseline over time can predict the development of GEV, and (3) investigate whether changes in PLT correlate with the hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG). A secondary analysis was conducted for 213 subjects with compensated cirrhosis with portal hypertension but without GEV enrolled in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial of a nonselective beta-blocker used to prevent GEV. PLTs were obtained every 3 months, and HVPG measurements and EGD were done annually. The PLTs were compared between subjects who did and did not develop GEV. In a median follow-up of 54.9 months, 84 patients developed GEV. PLT was greater than 150,000 in 15% of patients at the development of GEV. A receiver operating curve did not show any PLT with high sensitivity or specificity for the presence of GEV. Subjects with clinically insignificant portal hypertension (HVPG < 10 mm Hg) whose PLT remained greater than 100,000 had a 2-fold reduction in the occurrence of GEV (P = 0.0374). A significant correlation was found between HVPG and PLT at the baseline, year 1, and year 5 (P < 0.0001)."

CD008759,0,3259859,0,Management of variceal bleeding in patients with noncirrhotic portal vein thrombosis.,"Since 1971, 70 patients have been seen at Emory University Hospital with gastroesophageal varices secondary to extrahepatic portal vein thrombosis (PVT). Thirty-seven of these patients had had prior major operative therapy. In only three patients (8%) was shunt surgery successful, and there was a high incidence of rebleeding, other morbidity, and mortality. Of especial note are the serious consequences of simple splenectomy; splenomegaly and thrombycytopenia should rarely, if ever, be used as indication for splenectomy in portal hypertension. In 1977, the use of selective distal splenorenal shunt (DSRS) was begun at Emory in this population and a selective shunt has been possible in 24 of 29 patients (83%) who had had no prior operative therapy. Results have been excellent with a greater than 90% patency rate, long-term portal perfusion in all, no encephalopathy, and late rebleeding in one patient. Quantitative studies at 3-6 years show stability of liver function, significant decrease in spleen size, and rise in platelet count. However, long-term follow-up (greater than 15 years) is required in PVT patients before definitive assessment can be obtained. A specific problem of the PVT patient is late shunt stenosis which requires close observation; dilatation of the shunt was performed in six of the 24 patients with a patent shunt. Poor results with non-shunt operative procedures in PVT were again documented. The proper role of endoscopic variceal sclerotherapy is not yet clear, but appears to be an excellent addition to the therapeutic options. In conclusion, for patients with a patent splenic vein, initial therapy should be a selective shunt; for patients without a patent splenic venous system, endoscopic sclerotherapy is the procedure of choice."
CD008759,0,11392047,0,[Effect of portosystemic anastomosis on the degree of splenic inhibition].,"Secondary hypersplenism is a well-known complication of portal hypertension. Reduced platelet count is a more alarming sign for the physician than risk for the patient. Improvement of thrombocytopenia is urgent, when portal hypertension with splenomegaly and thrombocytopenia presents with life-threatening haemorrhage from gastroesophageal varices. In this case, treatment aimed at stopping the bleeding may be more beneficial than any intervention on the spleen. In this study, we evaluated long-term effects of an elective distal splenorenal shunt or small diameter H-shunt on splenomegaly and thrombocytopenia in 26 patients with portal hypertension operated for repeated bleeding from oesophageal varices. 25 patients had splenomegaly and 16 patients had thrombocytopenia before shunting. Surgery corrected splenomegaly in 16 patients (64%), platelet counts increased in 13 of 16 patients with thrombocytopenia (81.2%)."

CD008759,0,25817781,0,Using Ultrasonic Transient Elastometry (FibroScan) to Predict Esophageal Varices in Patients with Viral Liver Cirrhosis.,"The correlation between liver stiffness (LS), measured by ultrasonic transient elastometry (FibroScan), and the presence and severity of esophageal varices (EV) in patients with viral cirrhosis of the liver has not been well documented to date. The study described here investigated the value of using FibroScan to predict EV. Patients with cirrhosis (200 patients: 167 cases caused by hepatitis B virus and 33 cases caused by hepatitis C virus) underwent both upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and FibroScan. Demographic, clinical, biochemical and endoscopic data and FibroScan-obtained LS parameters were collected. The mean LS value in patients with EV (33.2 kPa) was significantly higher than the mean LS value in patients without EV (18.6 kPa) (p < 0.05). The mean LS value in patients with grade 2 and 3 EV (38.3 kPa) was significantly higher than that in patients with grade 1 EV (24.8 kPa) (p < 0.05). Overall, FibroScan was 86.4% sensitive and 72.2% specific in predicting the presence of EV, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.84. The sensitivity and specificity for the patients with grade 2 or 3 EV were 84% and 73% (AUROC = 0.86). When FibroScan was combined with platelet count, the overall sensitivity and specificity of prediction increased to 84% and 80% (AUROC = 0.88), respectively, and 84% and 75% (AUROC = 0.89), respectively, in patients with grade 2 and 3 EV. FibroScan alone or combined with platelet count might predict the presence and severity of EV in patients with hepatitis B or C-related viral cirrhosis."

PH syndrome is usually interpreted by practitioners as a clinical manifestation of liver cirrhosis even if it is not necessarily related to the involvement of this organ. In patients with hepatic pathology, PH is likely to develop not only in case of fibrotic transformation and false lobule formation but also in case of disturbed blood flow in the portal vein, e.g. when granulomatous lesion of parenchyma takes place. Pathophysiological mechanisms and clinical peculiarities of intra-, sub-, suprahepatic and mixed forms of this condition are discussed. Etiological factors leading to the development of PH syndrome are considered. An original observation is presented of a patient with generalized sarcoidosis and histologically confirmed thoracic lymph nodes, spleen, lungs, liver; moderate granulomatous hepatitis, septal fibrosis (Knodel histology activity index 1-1-3-3- (8 scores)), PH, grade 1 oesophageal varicosis, splenomegaly, splenorenal anastomoses. The involvement of liver in the pathological process did not exceed 20%. Clinical, laboratory and instrumental studies rarely reveal manifestations of these changes.

The aetiology of portal hypertension in these cases has not been well studied, but it may be related to compression of the cyst over the portal vein, secondary biliary cirrhosis, or even extrahepatic portal venous thrombosis. We present our experience with four cases of choledochal cysts with associated portal hypertension over a 10-year period (1991-2001). Gastrointestinal bleeding, splenomegaly or incidental discovery of oesophageal varices led to the diagnosis of associated portal hypertension. Excision of choledochal cyst and bilioenteric bypass may not be feasible in those patients with massive collaterals in the region of porta with secondary portal hypertension. An initial approach of internal drainage (endoscopic/operative) of the cyst may allow regression of collaterals and subsequent safe excision of the cyst in this difficult group of patients. The liver function and histopathology dictated the final outcome."

Emergency endoscopy demonstrated bleeding from esophageal varices. Management of variceal hemorrhage by endoscopic injection sclerotherapy, using 5% ethanolamine oleate, was successful. Following the control of variceal bleeding, she was treated with hydroxyurea, a myelosuppressive agent. The spleen size markedly decreased and she was discharged 3 months later. Variceal hemorrhage in myeloproliferative disorder has been reported to be fatal on many occasions, despite different therapeutic approaches, including surgery. In this report, we demonstrated that endoscopic injection sclerotherapy followed by treatment with a myelosuppressive agent was effective in a patient with myeloproliferative disorder and variceal hemorrhage."

Using a new ""button"" technique, a stricture 0.9 mm in diameter was found to be compatible with life in more than 90% of the rats. Angiographic and anatomic studies of portosystemic collaterals confirmed observations in earlier experiments. Oesophageal varices were not seen, despite sustained elevation of portal venous pressure during the four weeks following induction of portal hypertension. Development of paraportal veins bridging the obstacle is suggested to be responsible for maintenance of normal liver structure and for recovery from the transient hepatic dysfunction. Increase of phagocytosis in the germinal centres of the enlarged spleens was found after four weeks, suggesting immunologic changes caused by portal hypertension and/or portosystemic shunt circulation."

An abundance of collateral paths was noted in most patients. No regularity in development of these collaterals was found. It was not correlated to liver disease etiology, sex or liver function parameters. Portal pressure was not correlated to the size or amount of collaterals. In four patients with liver cirrhosis hepato-fugal flow in one segment of the liver was noted proving that portal flow through the liver is not uniform in this disease. The size of the haemorrhages was only correlated to presence of hepato-fugal flow in the main stem of the portal vein. It was not correlated to the estimated size of the oesophageal varices or to portal pressure. Percutaneous transhepatic portography seems to be of little help in selecting ""high risk bleeders"" in portal hypertension. Other factors may be of greater help in this task as indicated by the findings in this investigation that patients with alcohol cirrhosis had larger haemorrhages than those with cirrhosis of another etiology and that patients with none or few bleeding episodes had higher thrombocyte count than those with several haemorrhages."

Diagnosis of NRH is relatively difficult and involves surgical pathology, and thus it is necessary to improve the preoperative recognition of NRH. Here, we analyze 15 cases of NRH to better understand this disease. All the liver specimens were microscopically examined by hematoxylin-eosin staining and reticulin and Masson trichrome staining. Diagnoses of NRH were confirmed by pathological examination. Clinically, NRH presents as diffused liver lesions with mildly increased liver enzymes. Portal hypertension is the most common clinical manifestation presenting prominently as splenomegaly, hypersplenism, and esophageal varices bleeding. NRH is often associated with autoimmune or collagen vascular diseases, and such patients often present with a variety of positive autoantibodies and increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), Ig and γ %. Pathological examination of the liver showed diffuse small regenerative nodules without fibrous septa and obstructive portal venopathy. For those patients with portal hypertension of unknown cause and preserved liver function, especially, those combined with autoimmune diseases, NRH should be considered."

This patient presented with epigastric pain that had no obvious origin prior to admission. Laboratory examinations were positive for hepatitis B surface antigen and α-fetoprotein, and severe esophageal and gastric varices were detected during gastroscopy. Abdominal X-ray plain film showed well-defined linear and track-like calcification, with irregular margins directed along the course of the portal venous system. CT revealed extensive calcifications along the course of the portal, splenic, superior mesenteric and gastroesophageal veins.

The 118 patients evaluated retrospectively had underlying liver cirrhosis (LC) (62), idiopathic portal hypertension (IPH) (42), and extrahepatic portal occlusion (EHO) (14). The weight of the spleen did not differ significantly among the three diagnostic groups: 640 +/- 473.5 g for LC, 780 +/- 414.6 g for IPH, and 683 +/- 457.2 g for EHO. Before splenectomy, portal pressure was significantly elevated in the patients with EHO (410 +/- 85.2 mm H2O) as compared to either the LC or IPH groups (348 +/- 64.1 and 348 +/- 73.5 mm H2O). Following splenectomy the reduction of portal pressure was significantly greater in the EHO group (29 +/- 15.5%) than in either the LC (18 +/- 17.4%) or IPH (19 +/- 17.0%) groups. Each group was subdivided according to severity of splenomegaly: marked (spleen weight > or = 500 g) or slight (spleen weight < 500 g). Patients with LC and marked splenomegaly showed a reduction in liver function parameters as shown by the prolongation of indocyanine retention rate at 15 min as compared to those with slight splenomegaly. Though it is not statistically significant, the average portal pressure tended to be higher among those with marked splenomegaly.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

CD008759,0,1551537,0,Nodular regenerative hyperplasia of the liver in early histological stages of primary biliary cirrhosis.,"Nodular regenerative hyperplasia (NRH) is a condition characterized by hepatocytic nodules distributed throughout the liver without perinodular fibrosis. The etiology is unknown, but it has been reported in patients with a variety of diseases, including autoimmune diseases and primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC). In this study, the liver biopsies of 64 patients with PBC were reviewed. Thirty-five biopsies in histological stages I or II belonging to 30 patients were suitable for study. NRH was found in 43% of biopsies (47% of patients). In 80% of these biopsies, nodular transformation was focal, while it was diffuse in the remaining 20%. Splenomegaly was more common in patients with NRH. Laparoscopy displayed evidence of portal hypertension in two of these patients and endoscopy showed esophageal varices in one patient. Serum levels of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase were also higher in these patients. Lesions in small intrahepatic vessels, florid bile duct lesions, and portal granulomas were found more frequently in biopsies with NRH. We conclude that nodular hyperplastic changes are very common in early histological stages of PBC, and consequently, this disease should be considered in the etiology of NRH. These changes may contribute to early development of portal hypertension in these patients."

Fifty-six consecutive patients of portal hypertension with ascites attending the GI surgery outpatients clinic were divided into two groups on the basis of history: (a) those who had no history of GI bleeding; and (b) those who had an episode of GI bleeding within the past 21 days. Child-Pugh score was calculated for all patients. All the patients were assessed by ultrasonography and SAAG was estimated. Groups (a) and (b) were compared and sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value of using SAAG as a possible screening test for GI bleeding were calculated. SAAG values correlated significantly with bleeding and splenomegaly. For prediction of bleeding, SAAG had a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 33.33%, positive predictive value of SAAG for GI bleeding was 71.4% and the negative predictive value was 100%. Estimation of SAAG is possible even in a small, modestly equipped laboratory, and could provide a new means for the identification of high-risk patients for GI bleeding and define patients more accurately for future clinical studies. The results of the present study are encouraging for clinicians working in developing countries and may help in optimizing prophylactic therapy and where available, improving the cost effectiveness of screening endoscopy."

Computed tomography of the abdomen showed splenomegaly and a small amount of ascites, without liver cirrhosis. She was diagnosed as having IPH and followed-up as an outpatient. Five years later, she developed symptoms of a common cold and rapidly progressive abdominal distension. She was found to have severe liver atrophy, liver dysfunction, and massive ascites. Living donor liver transplantation was then performed, and her postoperative course was uneventful. Histopathological findings of the explanted liver showed collapse and stenosis of the peripheral portal vein. The areas of liver parenchyma were narrow, while the portal tracts and central veins were approximate one another, leading to a diagnosis of IPH. There was no liver cirrhosis.

However, splenectomy remained controversial for hypersplenism in WD as it was reported that splenectomy leaded to serious emotional and neurological deterioration in WD patients with hypersplenism. In the current study, we present our experiences in 70 WD patients with hypersplenism who had undergone splenectomy, outlining the safety and efficacy of splenectomy in WD. The clinical database of 70 WD patients with hypersplenism who had undergone splenectomy in our hospital between 2009 and 2013 were reviewed and followed-up regularly. Before splenectomy, all the patients accepted a short period of anti-copper treatment with intravenous sodium 2, 3-dimercapto-1-propane sulfonate (DMPS). All the patients demonstrated a marked improvement in platelet and leucocyte counts after splenectomy. No severe postoperative complication was observed. In particular, none of the 37 patients with mixed neurologic and hepatic presentations experienced neurological deterioration after splenectomy, and none of the patients with only hepatic presentations newly developed neurological symptoms. During the one year follow-up period, no patient presented hepatic failure or hepatic encephalopathy, no hepatic patient newly developed neurological presentations, and only 3 patients with mixed neurologic and hepatic presentations suffered neurological deterioration and these 3 patients had poor compliance of anti-copper treatment. Quantative analysis of the neurological symptoms in the 37 patients using the Unified Wilson's Disease Rating Scale (UWDRS) showed that the neurological symptoms were not changed in a short-term of one week after splenectomy but significantly improved in a long-term of one year after splenectomy. Additionally, compared to that before splenectomy, the esophageal gastric varices in most patients significantly improved one year after splenectomy. Thus, we may conclude that splenectomy is a safe and effective therapeutic measure for hypersplenism in WD patients who had been preoperatively treated with DMPS for powerful anti-copper therapy."

We therefore aimed to clarify them and compare them with HCC with intrahepatic metastases. A series of 118 patients who had definite hepatitis C viral status and multinodular HCC were divided into two groups: a multicentric occurrence (MO) group (n = 38), with multicentric HCCs; and an intrahepatic metastasis (IM) group (n = 80), with HCC having intrahepatic metastases. Clinicopathologic variables, including the patient's survival and disease-free survival rates, were compared between the MO and IM groups. Univariate analysis revealed the presence of esophageal varices, the presence of hepatitis C virus infection, a platelet count of less than 10 x 10(4)/microliter, hepaplastin test, gamma-globulin, the histologically active hepatitis, tumor size, des-gamma-carboxy prothrombin > 0.1 AU/ml, positive portal vein invasion, and histologic grade as discriminating factors. The MO score to differentiate multicentric HCCs from intrahepatic metastatic HCCs was determined using the following four independent factors selected by a stepwise regression analysis: the presence of hepatitis C virus infection, a platelet count of less than 10 x 10(4)/microliter, tumor size, and histologic grade. The sensitivity and specificity of the MO scores using those factors were 84% and 70%, respectively, when the cutoff value was 0.4. The disease-free survival rate in the MO group was similar to that in the IM group, whereas the survival rate in the MO group was significantly better than that in the IM group. The multivariate analysis revealed the multicentric occurrence of HCC as one of the independent prognostic factors. Clinicopathologic factors differentiating multicentric HCCs from intrahepatic metastatic HCCs were the presence of hepatitis C virus infection, a platelet count of less than 10 x 10(4)/microliter, small tumor size, and low histologic grade."

The sizes of the organs usually involved in this disease were quantitatively assessed according to a standardized protocol, and measurements were adjusted to the body height of the individual. The results were compared with those of healthy controls matched by sex, age, geographical origin and socio-economic status. Considerable differences were found between patients and controls as well as between residents from the two areas. The liver of both patients and controls from the Sudan was significantly smaller than that of patients and controls from Brazil. Only in Brazil, but not in the Sudan, was the left liver lobe larger in patients than in the controls. The diameter of the portal and the splenic vein, the spleen size and the thickness of the gallbladder wall were significantly increased in patients from both areas. The increase of the portal and splenic vein diameter was significantly correlated with the degree of hepatic periportal fibrosis and the frequency of bleeding from endoscopically proven oesophageal varices in the patients, irrespective of their geographic origin. In contrast, such correlations were not found for the degree of splenomegaly nor for the degree of gallbladder-wall thickening. It is concluded that standardized sonographic organometry permits the assessment of morbidity in hepatosplenic schistosomiasis mansoni under different endemic conditions.

CD008759,0,14752839,1,Prevalence and predictors of esophageal varices in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis.,"Patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) may develop and bleed from esophageal varices. However, the exact prevalence of esophageal varices in patients with PSC remains unknown and potential predictors of esophageal varices in this population have not been identified. Our aim was to determine the prevalence of esophageal varices in patients with PSC and the variables that predict their presence. Data were collected on 283 patients with PSC treated for the first time at the Mayo Clinic (Rochester, MN) during 8 consecutive years. Thirty-six percent (102 of 283) of patients had esophageal varices including 56% (57 of 102) with moderate/large varices. After excluding 28 patients with a history of variceal bleeding, data on 183 patients were analyzed to identify independent predictors of esophageal varices and of moderate/large size varices. Platelet count, albumin level, and advanced histologic disease were independent predictors of esophageal varices (area under the receiver operator characteristic [ROC] curve = 0.88). After controlling for the presence of advanced histologic stage and albumin levels, the odds ratios (OR) of platelet count less than 150 x 10(3)/dL for the presence of esophageal varices was 6.3 (95% CI: 2.6-15.8). The diagnostic accuracy of these results was corroborated by cross-validation of the data in an independent set of 72 patients with PSC (area under the ROC = 0.90). In conclusion, in patients with PSC, noninvasive markers of portal hypertension and of advanced liver disease predict the presence of esophageal varices. Our results suggest a clinically applicable and useful approach to identify patients with PSC who are more likely to benefit from endoscopic screening for esophageal varices."

This woman had a history of mild liver dysfunction since the age of 30 years, and abdominal distention, esophageal varices, splenomegaly and ascites since October 1996. Imaging examinations revealed liver deformity with severe atrophy of the left lobe and the anterior segment of the right lobe. Celiac arteriography showed narrowing and upward deviation of the proper hepatic artery, and occlusion of the left and right anterior hepatic arteries. Since March 1997, hepatic venography showed stenosis in the right hepatic vein truncus. Budd-Chiari syndrome was clinically diagnosed. She died in June 1997. The autopsy disclosed massive tumor embolism in the left and right anterior portal branches, few in the hepatic artery, and occlusion of the left and right anterior hepatic arteries. The extensive tumor embolism resulted in portal hypertension, and atrophy of the left lobe. The anterior segment of the right lobe was probably caused by the occlusion of both the hepatic arteries and the portal veins. The posterior segment of the right lobe, without massive tumor embolism in its portal branch, appeared hypertrophic."

Spleen TE was not reliable in 16 patients (14.3%). Among the 96 patients with a valid measurement (69.8% men, mean age: 63.2 ± 9.5 years), 43.7% had no oesophageal varices, 29.2% had grade 1% and 27.1% had grade 2 or grade 3 oesophageal varices. Patients with values of 75 kPa by standard spleen TE had mean values of modified spleen TE of 117 kPa (range: 81.7-149.5). Linear regression revealed a significant correlation between modified spleen TE and oesophageal varix size (r = 0.501; beta: 0.763, SE: 0.144; P < 0.001). On univariate analysis, the variables associated with grade 2/grade 3 oesophageal varices were AAR score, APRI score, platelet/spleen ratio, liver TE and modified spleen TE. On multivariate analysis, only modified spleen TE (OR: 1.026; 95% CI: 1.007-1.046; P = 0.006) and AAR (OR: 14.725; 95% CI: 1.928-112.459; P = 0.010) remained independently associated with grade 2/grade 3 oesophageal varices. Platelet/spleen ratio was the best predictor of oesophageal varices area under the ROC curve (AUROC: 0.763, cut-off: 800, sensitivity: 74%, specificity: 70%), while modified spleen TE was more accurate in predicting grade 2/grade 3 oesophageal varices (AUROC: 0.82, cut-off: 54.0 kPa, sensitivity: 80%, specificity: 70%). Portal hypertension increases spleen stiffness, and the measurement of modified spleen TE is an accurate, noninvasive tool for predicting the presence of large oesophageal varices in patients with compensated HCV cirrhosis."
CD008759,0,12587456,0,[Partial resection of the spleen and spleno-renal shunt in the treatment of portal hypertension with splenomegaly and hypersplenism].,"Some of serious hepatic diseases with cirrhosis may be complicated by portal hypertension, splenomegaly and hypersplenism. Splenomegaly inhibits regenerative processes of the liver, and also intensifies sequestration of the cellular components of blood up to hypersplenism. Cytopenia caused by hypersplenism is aggravated by negative hepatic influence on bone marrow activity-hemathopoesis, and also by recurrent bleeding from oesophageal varices, and from the other site of gastrointestinal tract. This circle of pathologic conditions may be interrupted only by liver transplantation, until which patients are jeopardized by acute bleeding and chronic anemia. Partial resection of the spleen and splenorenal shunt may correct portal hypertension and hypersplenism, prevent gastrointestinal bleeding, and alleviate hepatic regenerative processes inhibition. In this study, 51 patients with partial resection of the spleen and splenorenal shunt, were analyzed."
CD008759,0,1343892,0,Portal hypertension in schistosomiasis: pathophysiology and treatment.,"In heavily infected young patients, there is a ""non-congestive"" phase of the disease with splenomegaly which can improve after chemotherapy. A strong correlation between hepatosplenic form and worm burden in young patients has been repeatedly shown. The pattern of vascular intrahepatic lesions, seems to depend on two mechanisms: (a) egg embolization, with a partial blocking of the portal vasculature; (b) the appearance of small portal collaterals along the intrahepatic portal system. The role played by hepatitis B virus (HBV) and C virus infections in the pathogenesis of liver lesions is variably considered. Selective arteriography shows a reduced diameter of hepatic artery with thin and arched branches outlining vascular gaps. A rich arterial network, as described in autopsy cases, is usually not seen in vivo, except after splenectomy or shunt surgery. An augmented hepatic arterial flow was demonstrated in infected animals. These facts suggest that the poor intrahepatic arterial vascularization demonstrated by selective arteriography in humans is due to a ""functional deviation"" of arterial blood to the splenic territory. The best results obtained in treatment of portal hypertension were: esophagogastric devascularization and splenectomy (EGDS), although risk of rebleeding persists; classical (proximal) splenorenal shunt (SRS) should be abandoned; distal splenorenal shunt may complicate with hepatic encephalopathy, although later and in a lower percentage than in SRS. Propranolol is currently under investigation. In our Department, schistosomatic patients with esophageal varices bleeding are treated by EGDS and, if rebleeding occurs, by sclerosis of the varices."
CD008759,0,1126603,0,Noncirrhotic presinusoidal portal hypertension associated with chronic arsenical intoxication.,"A 39-year-old male with bleeding esophageal varices due to portal hypertension was observed. The patient had taken an arsenical preparation during a period of 12 yr because of psoriasis and subsequently developed keratotic changes of the palms and soles of his feet and an epithelioma of the scrotum. Physical examination was unremarkable except for splenomegaly and skin lesions. Liver function tests were normal; a needle biopsy of the liver (right lobe) showed nonspecific changes. Combined hepatic and umbilicoportal catheterization revealed, on splenography and portography, huge esophageal varices and patent portal vein; dilation, distortion, and cut-off of many intrahepatic portal branches were found. A marked gradient existed between the free portal venous pressure (25 mm Hg) and the wedged hepatic venous pressure (9.5 mm Hg). Hepatic blood flow, portal PO2, cardiac output, cardiac index, and blOOD volume were within normal range. Arteriographies did not reveal arteriovenous shunts in the splanchnic or splenic vessels. A splenorenal shunt were performed and a wedged biopsy of the liver (left lobe) revealed nonspecific changes. Three years later the patient had not experienced any episode of hemorrhage or hepatic encephalopathy but developed an epithelioma of the tongue. No known cause could be incriminated in the pathogenesis of the portal hypertension. However, there was unequivocal chronic arsenic intoxication. Toxic hepatitis, cirrhosis, noncirrhotic portal hypertension, and hemangiosarcoma of the liver have been reported with the intake of arsenicals. Thus, it is suggested that in this patient, presinusoidal portal hypertension was secondary to chronic arsenical intake associated with marked intrahepatic vascular changes seen on portography."

A retrospective cohort study of 2,525 patients who underwent laparoscopy.","The aim of this study was to evaluate the meaning of laparoscopic splenomegaly and its relationship with the severity and evolution of liver cirrhosis. Medical records of 2,525 consecutive patients with chronic liver diseases who underwent laparoscopy and video-guided hepatic biopsy were reviewed. There were 1,610 (63.8%) men and 915 (36.2%) women. All patients underwent gastroscopy to diagnose esophageal varices. The diagnosis of cirrhosis was made in 910 (36.0%) patients, while 620 (24.6%) had hepatic fibrosis, and 995 (39.4%) chronic active hepatitis. Splenomegaly was present in 460 out of 910 patients (50.5%) with cirrhosis. Among the 1,615 patients without cirrhosis, splenomegaly was present in 80 (4.9%), and esophageal varices were present in 70 out of 910 (7.6%) cirrhotic patients. In patients without cirrhosis, esophageal varices were present in 30 out of 1,615 (1.2%) at the time of laparoscopy. Statistical analysis showed significant differences between patients with cirrhosis and without cirrhosis for splenomegaly (χ(2)=717.03, p<0.001) and esophageal varices (χ(2)=50.57, p<0.001). In conclusion, laparoscopic splenomegaly seems to be an important prognostic factor in liver cirrhosis, which represents a risk factor for portal hypertension."

The clinical history and biochemical investigations usually only indicated some form of hepatobiliary disease, but all patients with spider telangiectasia, splenomegaly, or esophagogastric varices had diffuse parenchymal liver disease, and further investigation was only required to detect its cause. Laparoscopy succeeded in 129 patients (91%), and serious complications occurred in six (4%). The appearance of the liver did not accurately reflect the underlying pathology, indicating the need for biopsy in all cases. Laparoscopy and 99mTc-sulfur colloid liver imaging each failed to detect a few hepatic malignancies, but none were missed by both investigations combined, and similar results were obtained for parenchymal liver disease. Scanning and laparoscopy proved a highly accurate diagnostic combination."

CD008759,0,8096109,0,Use of ultrasound in a study of schistosomal periportal fibrosis in rural Zimbabwe.,"Ultrasound was used to diagnose periportal fibrosis (PPF) in a rural Zimbabwean community where Schistosoma mansoni is endemic. Ultrasound findings were compared with stool microscopy and abdominal palpation in 492 adults (305 females). 47 (9.6%) had definite PPF. The prevalence of PPF increased with age (P < 0.001), while S. mansoni egg counts decreased with age. Even within age groups, egg count did not correlate with PPF. No association was found between lifetime alcohol consumption and the presence of PPF. Splenomegaly and mid-line enlargement of the liver were specific (97% and 94%) but insensitive (21% and 28%) markers for PPF. Spleen size varied with S. mansoni egg count independently of the presence or degree of PPF. Endoscopy of 18 patients with PPF revealed oesophageal varices in two, both of whom had severe PPF."

A 62-yr-old female with liver cirrhosis was followed up in our hospital. Real-time ultrasonography initially detected aechoic space at the middle part of the splenic vein, confirmed as SVA by contrast-enhanced computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and angiography. Magnetic resonance imaging showed the stagnation of blood flow in SVA, which suggests the presence of hypertension in the portal venous system. Moreover, SVA enlarged in parallel with the development of esophageal varices. These observations suggest that the persistent stagnation of blood flow in the portal venous system may have played a major role in the increase in size of the SVA in this case."

CD008759,0,7361269,0,Direct splenocaval shunt for selective decompression of portal hypertension in children.,"A new operation for selective decompression of portal hypertension in children with diminutive splenic veins is desired. The operation, direct splenocaval shunt (S-D-SCS), produces transplenic decompression of gastric-esophageal varices without interfering with the existing portal flow status in any significant measure. The proximal free end of the inferior vena cava (IVC) is joined to the side of the splenic vein, which is ligated on the hepatic side of the anastomosis. Addition of partial gastric devascularization completes the operation. Technically the operation is simple and easily executable. Because the IVC is utilized in creation of the shunt, anastomoses as large as 1.72 +/- 0.45 cm in diameter are obtained with splenic veins of less than 1 cm in diameter. S-D-SCS was performed in 10 children with a mean age of 9.25 +/- 3.36 years and a mean splenic vein size of 8.2 +/- 2.25 mm in diameter. Shunt thrombosis occurred in one patient who died. Nine patients survived the operation and obtained class A surgical results over a follow-up period of 7 to 12 months. None rebled, developed postshunt encephalopathy (PSE), or manifested laboratory evidences of protein intolerance. Insignificant alterations were brought about in liver blood flow (EHBF) and sinusoidal pressure (CSP); portal blood flow to the liver was maintained; and liver function tests were preserved at preoperative levels. The surgical results were superior to those following mesentericocaval and portacaval shunts in our earlier series of children with comparable mean age, body weight, and postoperative interval when studied functionally. About 30% of all of the shunt patients died of liver failure within weeks or months after the operations, and an additional 30% of the patients developed clinically significant PSE over variable periods of follow-up. These high mortality and morbidity rates were preceded by significant reductions in EHBF and CSP and concomitant precipitation of liver function abnormalities."

CD008759,0,14665393,0,Haemostatic abnormalities in hepatosplenic schistosomiasis mansoni.,"Hepatosplenic schistosomiasis is a complex immuno-regulatory disease and is major health problem in endemic countries. Acute bleeding is one of its most serious complications and often life-threatening. Clinical studies have demonstrated that the patients with hepatosplenic schistosomiasis are prone to develop complex haemostatic abnormalities that may be linked to the potential risk of bleeding from ruptured esophageal varices in these patients. The deficit in haemostatic parameters is more pronounced with the advancement of the disease and is maximal in the patients with experience of haematomesis. Evidences of enhanced generation of thrombin and plasmin indicate the presence of low-grade DIC in advanced hepatosplenic schistosomiasis, which is considered as a principal cause of haemostatic abnormalities in this endemic disease. Demonstration of procoagulant expression in peripheral blood monocytes of the patients and in the livers, spleens and intestines of S. mansoni-infected mice suggest their possible implication in the causation of DIC in S. mansoni infections. Moreover, because in vitro analysis indicates a participation of immune mechanisms in the localized procoagulant expression, it seems likely that the immune responses to schistosomes play a major role in the pathogenic mechanisms of haemostatic abnormalities in hepatosplenic schistosomiasis."

The patient had been receiving factor VIII:C clotting factor concentrates (mean 60,000 U/year) since 1975. In 1984 alanine aminotransferase presented abnormal levels. The CD4 lymphocyte count in 1991 was normal and ultrasonographic scan showed normal liver morphology. In 1991 the patient were found to be seropositive for HCV antibodies as detected by the ELISA method and confirmed by the RIBA method. One year later, a progressive increase in policlonal gamma-globulin and a decrease in the CD4+ lymphocyte count to below 500/muL were detected in concomitance with ultrasonographic evidence of a progressive increase in the longitudinal diameters of the liver and spleen and signs of liver inhomogeneity. A significant inverse correlation was observed between the increase in the longitudinal diameter of the liver and the decline in albumin levels, and between the increase in the longitudinal diameter of the liver and the drop in platelet count. Elevated levels of ammonemia, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, alkaline phosphatase and IgA were detected. Moreover, decreased levels of the C4 and C3 complement fractions were documented. At this time (1994), esophagogram and esophagogastroscopy evidenced varicosities in the lower esophageal section (stage F1).

Radiographic findings which suggest splenic vein occlusion are gastric varices without esophageal varices and collateral veins in the left upper abdomen during the vascular phase of rapid sequence pyelography. Additional features may be associated with the underlying disease, such as pancreatic calcification and upper abdominal mass lesions. The diagnosis is usually confirmed by high dose celiac or splenic angiography. Examination of the stomach with barium for the detection of gastric varices is more sensitive than has been previusly recognized; features which suggest them are described.

The contribution of respiratory variations of splenic and mesenteric veins was also evaluated. Taking 13 mm as the limit for the normal diameter of the portal vein, 10 and 9 mm for the upper limits of the mesenteric and splenic veins, respectively, and respiratory variations being absent, the positive rates were 91, 88, and 92 per cent and the false-positive rates were 44, 38, and 42 per cent, respectively. The predictive values of a positive test were 0.34, 0.33, and 0.34, respectively, and the predictive values of a negative test were 0.96 for the portal and mesenteric veins and 0.97 for the splenic vein. Because the portal vein is always visible, the portal diameter may be employed in the screening through the presence of large varices in association with the assessment of respiratory variation in the splenic or mesenteric diameter. A cut-off point of 13 mm and the absence of respiratory variations precludes the need for endoscopy in 47 per cent of patients."

Thorough history taking and serological exam revealed no evidence of chronic liver disease. Liver biopsy was done and there was no cirrhotic nodule formation. Instead, perivenular fibrosis was noted. Considering new development of esophageal varices and splenomegaly after 12 cycles of oxaliplatin-based adjuvant chemotherapy, we could conclude that portal hypertension in this patient were due to sinusoidal injury by oxaliplatin. Finally, we recommend regular follow-up with endoscopy and radiologic examination for checking the development of varices and for screening of varices and splenomegaly in patients with colo-rectal cancer who receive oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy."

Bleeding occurred in 0.9% of patients from the trocar site, in 0.2% from the biopsy site, and in 0% from the Veress needle site. These figures were independent of the presence of advanced liver disease, with or without portal hypertension. Bleeding complications occur rarely during laparoscopy with guided liver biopsy and do not seem to be related per se to the presence of liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension. If anything, bleeding complications represent an unpredictable event in most cases."

A 53-year-old SSc patient showing huge esophageal varices and splenomegaly without liver cirrhosis was diagnosed with IPH. As heterozygous Leiden mutation was detected, some coagulation abnormality and resultant formation of microthrombi in the branches of portal vein were suggested as a cause of IPH in this case. This is the first report showing the possible association between Leiden mutation and one of the complications of SSc."

CD008759,0,25682057,0,Managing unusual presentations of venous thromboembolism.,"Venous thromboembolism that occurs in unusual sites is challenging because of the potential severity of presentation, the presence of some major provoking risk factors, the high prevalence of potential contraindications to antithrombotic therapies, the lack of solid evidence to guide therapeutic decisions, and because of the severity of long-term consequences. For example, venous thrombosis in the splanchnic veins frequently occurs in patients with liver cirrhosis. Not uncommonly, these patients present with concomitant active gastrointestinal bleeding, and/or low platelet count or oesophageal varices. If inadequately treated, splanchnic vein thrombosis (SVT) may further worsen portal hypertension and, thus, increase the long-term risk of bleeding. Up to 40% of patients with cerebral vein thrombosis (CVT) have signs of intracranial bleeding at the time of the diagnosis. This finding is associated with worst prognosis in terms of death or severe disability. Despite the apparent presence of a major contraindication to anticoagulation, only a timely administration of parenteral anticoagulant drugs may improve this unfavourable outcome. The available evidence on the management of these two challenging disorders, SVT and CVT, will be reviewed in this article."

Study of 40 patients surviving for more than 10 years.,"To define long-term prognosis of children who underwent surgery for biliary atresia, a retrospective study was undertaken in 122 children who underwent one of the Kasaï procedures between 1968 and 1977. Forty of the 122 children (32.7%) were alive after 10 years. Firm hepatomegaly was present in 31 and splenomegaly in 29 children. Serum bilirubin or all liver function tests were normal in 21 and 11 children, respectively; survival rate decreased with the age at operation, but no significant difference was observed in the rate of children surviving with normal serum bilirubin whether they underwent surgery before age 2 months or between 2 and 3 months. Twenty-four had esophageal varices and 15 experienced gastrointestinal bleeding. Normal liver-function tests and absence of portal hypertension were observed in 11 of 122 children. These results indicate that Kasaï's procedures were helpful in a significant proportion of children with biliary atresia who underwent surgery during this period. However, 80% of children who initially underwent surgery with Kasaï's procedures should eventually undergo liver transplantation."

CD008759,0,26340692,0,Prognosis of acute variceal bleeding: Is being on beta-blockers an aggravating factor? A short-term survival analysis.,"Nonselective beta-blockers (NSBB) are widely used because they have been proved effective in the prophylaxis of acute variceal bleeding (AVB). However, a significant proportion of patients still experience AVB while on treatment with NSBB, and its impact on prognosis of AVB is unknown. The present study was aimed at assessing the effect of being on prophylactic therapy with NSBB on 5-day failure and 6-week mortality of patients with cirrhosis admitted with AVB. Included were 142 patients: 49 were receiving prophylactic therapy with NSBB (NSBB group) and 93 were not (control group). There were some differences in the baseline characteristics between the groups: higher proportion of alcoholic etiology and active alcoholism (37% versus 10%), higher platelet count, and lower hematocrit at admission in the control group. However, the severity of AVB and initial treatment were similar. Five-day failure occurred in 20% of patients (14% in NSBB versus 24% in controls, P = 0.27). The adjusted odds ratio for 5-day failure under NSBB was 2.46 (95% confidence interval 0.53-11.37, P = 0.25). Nineteen patients (13%) died, and two had liver transplantation within 6 weeks. The probability of survival at 6 weeks was 96% in the NSBB group and 82% in the control group (P = 0.02). After adjusting by propensity score and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score, the NSBB adjusted odds ratio for 6-week mortality was 0.38 (95% confidence interval 0.05-2.63, P = 0.32). The estimated association between NSBB with both 5-day failure and 6-week mortality was homogenous across all Model for End-Stage Liver Disease spectrums."
CD008759,0,23396934,0,Autoimmune hepatitis in a teenage boy: 'overlap' or 'outlier' syndrome--dilemma for internists.,"An 18-year-old boy presented with upper gastrointestinal bleeding and jaundice. Investigations revealed coarse hepatomegaly, splenomegaly and advanced oesophageal varices. Blood reports showed marked rise of alkaline phosphatase and more than twofold rise of transaminases and IgG. Liver histology was suggestive of piecemeal necrosis, interphase hepatitis and bile duct proliferation. Antinuclear antibody was positive in high titre along with positive antismooth muscle antibody and antimitochondrial antibody. The patient was positive for human leukocyte antigen DR3 type. Although an 'overlap' syndrome exists between autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) and primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), a cholestatic variant of AIH, a rare 'outlier' syndrome could not be excluded in our case. Moreover, 'the chicken or the egg', AIH or PBC, the dilemma for the internists continued. The patient was put on steroid and ursodeoxycholic acid with unsatisfactory response. The existing international criteria for diagnosis of AIH are not generous enough to accommodate its variant forms."
CD008759,0,10079338,0,Distal splenorenal shunt with splenopancreatic disconnection for portal hypertension in biliary atresia.,"This study evaluated the long-term effects of distal splenorenal shunt with splenopancreatic disconnection (DSRS-SPD) on portal hypertension (PH) in biliary atresia (BA) patients. Five patients with BA underwent DSRS-SPD at the age of 3.3 to 8.5 years. They had been free from jaundice after hepatic portoenterostomy (HPE); however, they gradually developed gastroesophageal varices and hypersplenism. Portal venous pressure after anastomosis was 37.2 +/- 6.1 cmH2O, as high as that before anastomosis (37.8 +/- 3.3 cmH2O). Postoperatively, liver function tests became worse within 2 weeks; however, they returned to preoperative levels within 1 month without any further treatment. No patient developed a significant encephalopathy throughout the observed period. During follow-up of 4 to 12 years, the shunt was patent in all patients. Spleen size decreased after operation. Abdominal-wall venous dilatation completely disappeared in two of four patients. The platelet counts gradually increased and were significantly higher 3 years (126.6 +/- 59.3 x 10(3)/mm3) after DSRS-SPD than preoperative values (66.0 +/- 24.2 x 10(3)/mm3). White blood cell counts showed no significant changes. No patient developed a gastrointestinal hemorrhage postoperatively, although three had had repeated hemorrhages before the operation. Two patients showed disappearance of varices endoscopically at 2 years and 7 months after DSRS-SPD, respectively, but had recurrent varices at 7 and 11 years, respectively. The endoscopic findings regarding varices 3 to 7 years after DSRS-SPD were as follows: decreased number (80%); decreased length (40%); improvement of form (20%); improvement of fundamental color (60%); disappearance of red-color sign (100%); disappearance of gastric varices (75%); and disappearance of acute gastric mucosal lesions (100%). Although one patient later underwent liver transplantation because of progression of liver cirrhosis, all five are doing well. From these results, DSRS-SPD may prove to be a safe and feasible procedure for intrahepatic PH after HPE for BA and may improve gastroesophageal varices and hypersplenism on long-term follow-up."

Child-Pugh class A liver function and a platelet count of > or = 60,000/mm(3) were among the inclusion criteria for SHARP. No safety data in patients with < 60,000/mm(3) of platelets are present. Thrombocytopenia is one of the most frequent challenges faced in patients with chronic liver diseases. We report a series of three patients with HCC and platelet count < 60,000/mm(3) who were successfully treated with sorafenib with no complications. We describe the current data on sorafenib and challenges faced in patients with HCC. In addition, we emphasize the need for informed consent when facing factors that predispose to bleeding (esophageal varices, coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia), possible band ligation before the start of sorafenib, careful clinical monitoring and discontinuation of sorafenib when major bleeding occurs."

Assessment of reproducibility and changes found following a selective distal splenorenal shunt.,"Liver and spleen size were measured in 11 normal subjects and 12 patients with cirrhosis. Volume was calculated by adding together the area measurements obtained from successive transverse abdominal scans. The normal mean volume of the liver (+/- S.D.) was 1,493 +/- 230 cm3 and that of the spleen was 219 +/- 76 cm3; interobserver variability was 4-8% and the day-to-day coefficient of variation was 6-10%. In cirrhotic patients studied prior to and 7-10 days after a distal splenorenal shunt, the mean liver volume fell from 1,642 to 1,529 cm3 (p less than 0.06) and the mean spleen volume from 660 to 507 cm3 (p less than 0.006), supporting the use of such a shunt in selective decompression of varices and maintenance of portal hypertension.

CD008759,0,17461491,0,Is portal vein cavernous transformation a component of congenital hepatic fibrosis?,"Congenital hepatic fibrosis (CHF) is an autosomal recessive disorder that belongs to the family of fibropolycystic liver diseases. This family includes a spectrum of disorders which are usually found in combination with each other and are usually inherited. Clinically fibropolycystic diseases have three effects being present in different proportions, those of a space occupying lesion, of portal hypertension and of cholangitis. In most patients, the first manifestations of CHF are signs and symptoms related to portal hypertension such as splenomegaly and varices. Portal hypertension in these patients has been attributed to the hypoplasia or compression of the portal vein radicles in the fibrous bands. Cavernous transformation of the portal vein (CTPV) is a relatively rare condition resulting from extrahepatic portal vein obstruction with recanalization or collateral vein formation to bypass the obstruction. It has been found that patients with CHF having an accompanying CTPV have relatively large splenomegaly and suffers more frequent episodes of bleeding from esophageal varices. We believe that CTPV is a congenital component of CHF and also one of the important causative factors of portal hypertension in these patients."

Increased portal blood flow secondary to splenomegaly has been proposed to explain its development. In a 60-year-old woman with proven myelofibrosis of 10 years' duration and gross splenomegaly, portal hypertension developed with esophageal varices and ascites. There was no demonstrable obstruction to portal blood flow. Following splenectomy the ascites and esophageal varices disappeared. Despite the presence of splenic myeloid metaplasia, splenectomy did not impair the patient's hematologic status.

We were able to control a case of complicated large gastroesophageal varices with gastrorenal shunt and portal hypertensive gastropathy using a combination treatment of partial splenic embolization, endoscopic embolization and transjugular retrograde obliteration. We first applied partial splenic embolization to reduce the hyperdynamic cycle of portal hypertension and to treat thrombocytopenia. We secondarily applied endoscopic embolization for the esophageal varices. Transjugular retrograde obliteration was performed for the gastric varices 14 days after endoscopic embolization. The wedged hepatic venous pressure had not changed after transjugular retrograde obliteration. After the combination treatment, the gastroesophageal varices were successfully obliterated, but portal hypertensive gastropathy did not worsen. The platelets count, arterial ketone body ratio and ICGR15 were improved. Partial splenic embolization was useful to protect side effects of endoscopic embolization and transjugular retrograde obliteration.

While splenomegaly is commonly associated with portal hypertension, no clear hemodynamic link between portal pressure and splenic enlargement has yet been established. In an effort to clarify the hemodynamic significance of splenomegaly in portal hypertensive patients the relationship between spleen size and portal pressure was retrospectively reviewed and the contribution of splenic inflow to portal hypertension prospectively studied. In 50 consecutive cirrhotic variceal bleeders studied angiographically, there was no correlation between spleen size and corrected sinusoidal pressure. Portal pressure was then prospectively measured before and after splenic vein clamping in 12 cirrhotic patients undergoing distal splenorenal shunt. No significant pressure drop occurred following elimination of splenic venous flow. On the basis of these data, there would appear to be no firm hemodynamic basis for splenectomy or splenic embolization alone in the unselective management of cirrhotic patients with variceal bleeding."

CD008759,0,1949143,0,Schistosomal periportal fibrosis in Zimbabwe: use of ultrasound in patients with oesophageal varices.,"Ultrasound (U/S) imaging of liver was used in a prospective study of 62 consecutive patients with oesophageal varices in the central hospitals in Harare; 50 had haematemesis. U/S changes of Symmers's periportal fibrosis (PPF) were graded from mild (grade 1) to gross (grade 4). 46 patients (74%) had U/S features of PPF: 7 were grade 1, 7 grade 2, 29 grade 3, and 3 grade 4. Patients with PPF were more likely to have bled (P less than 0.05) and were less likely to have ascites (P less than 0.05) than those without PPF. Spleen or liver size or grade of varices did not correlate with the U/S grade of PPF. Rectal snips were positive for schistosome ova in 19 of 28 cases with PPF and 2 of 7 cases without PPF. Patients with PPF were more likely than those without PPF (P less than 0.005) or controls (P less than 0.0001) to have spent their childhood in an area of Zimbabwe with a high prevalence of Schistosoma mansoni. Schistosomal PPF appears to be a common cause of portal hypertension in Zimbabwe. It is strongly associated with childhood spent in areas of high S. mansoni prevalence."

CD008759,0,4252495,0,Peritoneoscopic features of intraabdominal vessels in cirrhosis of the liver.,"Peritoneoscopy was carried out in 57 cirrhotic patients in order to evaluate the morphological features of intraabdominal veins. These were described either as normal or characterized by minimal, moderate, or marked alterations: accordingly, the patients were classified into four groups. Intrahepatic and intrasplenic pressures were measured in most patients; abnormally elevated values were found in every case, and the higher figures belonged to the subjects with minor involvement of the intraabdominal veins. Superficial collateralization and oesophageal varices appeared unrelated to changes in these veins, whereas splenomegaly was mostly found in patients with normal or slightly altered intraabdominal veins. Percutaneous splenoportography was performed in 16 patients, and venographic appearances did not correlate with peritoneoscopic features of the intraabdominal veins. Ascites, on the other hand, was exclusively present in patients with alterations in these veins. It is suggested that some pathogenetic relationship might exist between changes in intraabdominal veins seen by peritoneoscopy and ascites."

CD008759,0,25320239,0,How I treat splanchnic vein thrombosis.,"Antithrombotic treatment of splanchnic vein thrombosis (SVT) is a clinical challenge. Depending on the site of thrombosis, patients are at risk of developing liver insufficiency, portal hypertension, or bowel infarction and may experience recurrence in both the splanchnic veins and other vein segments. To prevent recurrence, anticoagulant therapy should be started as soon as possible after diagnosis and is often continued for an indefinite period of time. However, active bleeding is not infrequent at the time of SVT diagnosis, and major risk factors for bleeding, such as esophageal varices or a low platelet count, are frequently present in these patients. In real-world clinical practice, a proportion of SVT patients are left untreated because the risks associated with anticoagulant therapy are felt to exceed its benefits. However, the majority of patients receive anticoagulant drugs, with heterogeneous timing of initiation, drug choice, and dosages. Evidence to drive treatment decisions is limited because no randomized controlled trials have been carried out in these patients. This review provides practical guidance for the use of anticoagulant drugs in patients presenting with SVT, including symptomatic as well as incidentally detected events."

CD008759,0,556323,0,[The diagnostic value of wedged hepatic vein pressure in chronic hepatitis and liver cirrhosis (author's transl)].,"In 38 patients with chronic hepatitis and 53 patients with liver cirrhosis the portal vein pressure was determined by wedged hepatic vein pressure (WHVP). There were significant differences among chronic persistent, chronic active hepatitis and liver cirrhosis. The wedged hepatic vein pressure increased in chronic active hepatitis according to the rate of hepatic connective tissue. The platelet count and the thromboplastin time were correlated to the values of wedged hepatic vein pressure not only in chronic active hepatitis but in liver cirrhosis as well. The correlation among serum albumin level, bromsulphalein retention and systolic blood pressure after Riva-Rocci and wedged hepatic vein pressure was significant in liver cirrhosis exclusively. Even if the determination of wedged hepatic vein pressure does not permit an absolute statement on the risk of hemorrhage of esophageal varicosis it is nevertheless suited for follow-up controls in chronic hepatitis and liver cirrhosis and renders possible an outlook on the progress of the disease."
CD008759,0,2804591,0,Platelet aggregability after endoscopic intravariceal injection of 5 per cent ethanolamine oleate into oesophageal varices.,"Platelet aggregability and the coagulative and fibrinolytic systems were examined in 45 patients who underwent endoscopic injection sclerotherapy for oesophageal varices. Five per cent ethanolamine oleate, the sclerosant used, was injected into the oesophageal varices. There were significant increases in the concentrations of fibrinopeptide A, fibrinopeptide B-beta-15-42 and fibrin degradation products-E after the sclero-therapy. At 1 h after the sclerotherapy the mean(s.e.m.) platelet aggregation was significantly suppressed to 71.9(4.2) per cent of that before the treatment (P less than 0.01). There was a gradual recovery within 1 week to the same level seen before the sclerotherapy. Thromboxane B2 and 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha, both stable products of thromboxane A2 and prostacyclin respectively, showed significant temporary increases after the sclerotherapy (P less than 0.01). The peak increase in the level of thromboxane B2 was noted within 1 h after the sclerotherapy and earlier than that for 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha. This increased ratio of prostacyclin and thromboxane A2 may be related to the marked limitation in platelet aggregation."

CD008759,0,14571795,0,Clinical significance and prediction factors of gastric varices in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.,"Hepatocellular carcinoma is part of the natural history of liver cirrhosis. Gastrointestinal bleeding and hepatic failure are the leading causes of death in hepatocellular carcinoma patients. With gastrointestinal bleeding, variceal bleeding is the most prominent, and most variceal bleeding is of esophageal origin. Gastric varices bleeding is often a massive and severe bleeding episode. The role of gastric varices among patients with hepatocellular carcinoma remains to be clarified. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the prevalence, clinical significance and prediction of gastric varices in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma."

Deterioration of patient's clinical condition during the long wait for a compatible donor usually casts a poor prognosis on the patient. We report a 6-year-old girl who underwent splenic artery embolization as an alternative procedure due to a life-threatening clinical condition while liver graft was not immediately available. She was a case of idiopathic portal hypertension with portal vein occlusion that had resulted in splenomegaly, pancytopenia, gastric and esophageal varices. Living graft transplantation was contraindicated due to portal vein lesion. She was listed as high-urgency for liver transplantation as she developed repeated esophageal variceal bleeding requiring frequent sclerotherapy and admission to the intensive care unit. Prevention of the ongoing worsening clinical complications, improvement of hematological disorders and correction of hypersplenism was achieved right after splenic artery embolization. The patient resumed normal daily life and has been successfully eliminated from the waiting list of liver transplantation. We conclude that this is a safe and effective alternative to splenectomy that might call of further liver transplantation."

In a prospective study, we evaluated 101 consecutive patients with portal hypertension for spleen size measured ultrasonically by SVI, presence and size of esophageal varices, and etiology of portal hypertension. A total of 219 age-matched controls were evaluated ultrasonically to define a normal SVI. Splenomegaly defined by 1 or 2 standard deviations of normal SVI had high accuracy in predicting portal hypertension, presence of esophageal varices, and provided a clue to the etiology of portal hypertension.

The transplantation resulted in (a) normalization of platelet and leukocyte counts, (b) reduction of splenomegaly by 20% +/- 3% (P less than 0.02), (c) disappearance of ascites, and (d) diminution of esophageal varices in all patients.

He had received a kidney allograft 6 1/2 years ago. Treatment with azathioprine and prednisolone for immunosuppression had been discontinued 1 year before admission. The underlying cause of the splenomegaly appeared to be an idiopathic portal hypertension. Until now, this disease has been described in only 13 kidney transplant patients receiving long-term immunosuppressive therapy with azathioprine. For the first time we demonstrate that azathioprine can cause this chronic liver disease even if the drug has been withdrawn some time before. Therefore, the indication for azathioprine must be considered very carefully."
CD008759,0,1719808,0,Significance of hemostatic molecular markers during disseminated intravascular coagulation in patients with liver cirrhosis treated by endoscopic embolization for esophageal varices.,"We studied the quantitative changes of hemostatic molecular markers with time during the course of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) induced by endoscopic embolization using thrombin for esophageal varices in nine patients with liver cirrhosis. The plasma levels of D-dimer, a product of plasmin degradation of cross-linked fibrin, and thrombin-antithrombin-III complex (TAT) were significantly higher in patients before treatment when compared with 60 healthy individuals. The plasma levels of TAT, D-dimer, and plasmin alpha 2-plasmin inhibitor complex (PIC) increased significantly 5-15 min after thrombin injection into the varices, earlier than the changes of conventional coagulofibrinolytic factors, reached a maximum level after 180 min, and started to decline after 1 day. Although the plasma PIC level returned to normal after 7 days, both TAT and D-dimer were still above the pretreatment level. Although there was no change in urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA), tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) increased significantly after 5 min. The plasma level of plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) showed only a slight elevation after treatment. We propose that the hemostatic molecular markers TAT, D-dimer, and PIC are suitable for the early diagnosis of DIC after endoscopic embolization using thrombin in patients with liver cirrhosis and that the increase of PAI-1 is too small for the regulation of fibrinolysis due to t-PA in DIC occurring in liver cirrhosis."

CD008759,0,7732266,0,Sonographic features of portal hypertension in schistosomiasis mansoni.,"The diagnostic value of real-time sonography in the study of portal hypertension was assessed in 66 patients with hepatosplenic schistosomiasis mansoni, all with Symmers's fibrosis and esophageal varices. Seventy-one individuals without schistosomiasis were selected as controls. The inner diameters of the portal vessels were measured by sonography in all patients and controls: splenoportography was also performed in the schistosomal group. Intra-splenic pressure was over 30 cm of water in 44 of 60 patients with schistosomiasis. The upper limit of normality for portal vessel diameters was set through receiver operating characteristic curve at 12 mm for portal vein, 9 mm for splenic vein at splenic hilus, and 9 mm for superior mesenteric vein. The best discriminative vein for the diagnosis of portal hypertension was the splenic vein followed by the portal vein. A direct correlation was observed between the diameter of the splenic vein, measured by sonography, and the intra-splenic pressure. Except for the paraumbilical and mesenteric veins, more frequently identified by sonography, there was no statistical difference in the frequency of visualization of splanchnic vessels by sonography or splenoportography."
CD008759,0,6803472,0,Portal hypertension after successful Kasai's operation for biliary atresia--special reference to esophageal varices.,"Thirty-four patients with biliary atresia have undergone Kasai's operation in our clinic during the past 12 years. Of 21 patients who showed good bile excretion postoperatively, 8 are surviving more than 2 years later. 4 of these survivors and 2 who died of hepatic failure after operation which succeeded in achieving bile excretion, developed portal hypertension with esophageal varices. More than 30 similar patients have been reported in the literature. Esophageal varices after a successful Kasai's operation developed in one fourth of the patients who were expected to be cured. Half of these went on the hemorrhage. Portal hypertension due to biliary hepatic fibrosis could be divided into acute and chronic types. The acute type had a poor prognosis due to concomitant severe postoperative cholangitis, whereas, almost all patients with the chronic type survived, if the esophageal varices were well controlled conservatively or operatively. Transthoracic esophageal transection with paraesophagogastric devascularization seems to be the treatment of choice, and splenectomy may be added through the diaphragm only in patients with hypersplenism. Major or minor shunting procedures should be avoided because they decrease the blood flow to the liver."
CD008759,0,9834338,0,Portal vein thrombosis in cirrhosis with variceal hemorrhage.,"Organized thrombus in the main trunk of the portal vein was encountered in 85 (6.5%) of 1300 patients with cirrhosis and variceal hemorrhage who underwent direct portacaval shunt (PCS). The thrombus was successfully removed with restoration of portal blood flow in all patients by phlebothrombectomy and balloon catheter extraction. Of the 85 patients, 65 were among 400 unselected patients who underwent emergency PCS (16%), and 20 were among 900 selected patients who underwent elective PCS (2%). All patients were closely followed for at least 5 years. Patients with portal vein thrombosis (PVT) had more advanced liver disease than those without PVT, reflected preoperatively in significantly higher (P < 0.01) incidences of ascites (75%), severe muscle wasting (52%), varices of very large size (94%), the hyperdynamic state (94%), severe hypersplenism with a platelet count of less than 50,000/mm3 (92%), and placement in Child's class C (52%). Side-to-side PCS reduced the portal vein-inferior vena cava pressure gradient to a mean of 23 mm saline solution in patients with PVT, similar to the marked pressure reduction obtained in patients without PVT. PCS promptly stopped variceal bleeding in all patients in the emergency PCS group. Permanent prevention of recurrent variceal bleeding was successful in 95% of patients with PVT and more than 99% of patients without PVT. Survival rates were similar in patients with and without PVT. In patients with PVT, survival rates at 30 days and 1, 5, 10, and 15 years following emergency PCS were 69%, 66%, 65%, 55%, and 51%, respectively, and following elective PCS were 95%, 90%, 70%, 65%, and 60%, respectively. Quality of life was similar in patients with and without PVT. Long-term PCS patency was demonstrated yearly in 93% of patients in the group with PVT and in 99.7% of patients without PVT. Other similarities after 5 years between patients with and without PVT, respectively, were the incidences of recurrent encephalopathy (9% vs. 8%), alcohol abstinence (61% vs. 64%), improved liver function (68% vs. 62% to 75%), and return to work (52% vs. 56% to 64%). It was concluded that in patients with cirrhosis and variceal hemorrhage it is almost always possible to remove portal vein thrombus by means of phlebothrombectomy and then perform a direct PCS with results similar to those achieved in the absence of PVT."

CD008759,0,3488457,0,A method of measuring quantitative hepatic function and hemodynamics in cirrhosis: the changes following distal splenorenal shunt.,"Quantitative measurement is required to define the severity of chronic liver disease and the effects of therapy on its complications. This paper presents a method of such assessment based on measurement of hepatocyte function, liver volume, functional liver blood flow, portal perfusion and cardiac output. Data are presented on 54 patients evaluated prior to, and one year after DSRS for variceal bleeding. Preoperative testing showed that alcoholics (n = 24) had significantly (p less than 0.05) larger liver and smaller spleen volumes than nonalcoholic cirrhotics (n = 22) and patients with portal vein thrombosis (n = 8), but that the other parameters were not significantly different by etiologies. At one year after DSRS: all groups showed a significant (p less than 0.01) reduction of 41 per cent in spleen size: liver volume was significantly (p less than 0.05) reduced in cirrhotics: there was a significantly (p less than 0.01) greater loss of portal perfusion in alcoholic cirrhosis: liver blood flow showed a significant (p less than 0.05) rise in alcoholics when compared to nonalcoholics and portal vein thrombosis patients: cardiac output rose in alcoholic cirrhosis: hepatocyte function was not significantly different in any group. This study shows that in patients all doing well clinically one year after DSRS, there are markedly different hemodynamic responses. Further studies on cirrhosis aimed at improving therapy for its complications should include some objective, quantitative assessment, first to define the study population, and second to measure the effect of the therapy."

MTI and PDW were linearly and inversely correlated to platelet count both in controls and patients. MTI and PDW were markedly increased in LC as compared to controls, while MPV was not significantly different.

CD008759,0,12322843,0,Rate and associated risk factors of rebleeding after endoscopic variceal band ligation.,"Bleeding esophageal varices is associated with a high mortality rate. Despite advances in management, the mortality rate remains at 30-80 per cent. Endoscopic variceal band ligation (EVL) is a new technique designed to manage esophageal varices with the aim of reducing the complication rate. Variceal rebleeding which occurs in 6-36 per cent of patients is common during the treatment period before variceal obliteration is achieved but related factors remain unknown. Thirty-one patients with a history of esophageal variceal bleeding and endoscopically confirmed between February 1999 and February 2001 received regular EVL until variceal disappearance and were reviewed retrospectively. There was no major complication. Rebleeding was documented in 8 patients (25.8%). Portal hypertension-related conditions, such as gastric varices and portal hypertensive gastropathy, were the most common sources of rebleeding. Platelet count and prothrombin time were not found to be closely related to rebleeding (p-value=0.79, 0.08) but Child-Pugh's C patients had a significantly higher rebleeding rate compared with Child-Pugh's B and A respectively (p-value=0.047).

We report here a 10-year-old boy who presented to us with hematemesis, malaena and splenomegaly. An ultrasound showed a recanalized portal vein with collaterals suggestive of portal vein thrombosis. He had grade IV esophageal varices. The liver function tests were normal. Investigations for prothrombotic factors showed that tests for PNH and for APC resistance were negative. Levels of anti-thrombin II and protein C were normal. There was a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time with a normal prothrombin time. Presence of lupus anticoagulant was confirmed with dilute Russell viper venom time and platelet neutralization test. Repeat tests after 10 weeks showed persistence of the lupus anticoagulant. ELISA test for anti-phospholipid antibody was negative. The association of lupus anticoagulant with portal vein thrombosis in the pediatric age group is very rare."

A 35-year-old man underwent LDLT using a right lobe graft as an aid for primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) in 2005. Follow-up endoscopic and computed tomography (CT) examinations showed esophagogastric varices with splenomegaly in 2009 that increased (esophageal varices [EV]: locus superior [Ls], moderator enlarged, beady varices [F2], medium in number and intermediate between localized and circumferential red color signs [RC2]; gastric varices [GV]: extension from the cardiac orifice to the fornix [Lg-cf], moderator enlarged, beady varices [F2], absent red color signs [RC0]). A portal venous flow to the esophagogastric varices through a large left gastric vein was also confirmed. Preoperative Child-Pugh was grade B and score was 9. Because these esophagogastric varices had a high risk of variceal bleeding, we proceeded with a laparoscope-assisted Hassab's operation. Operative time was 464 minutes. Blood loss was 1660 mL. A graft liver biopsy was also performed and recurrence of PSC was confirmed histologically. It was suggested that portal hypertension and esophagogastric varices were caused by recurrence of PSC. Postoperative complications were massive ascites and enteritis. Both of them were treated successfully. This patient was discharged on postoperative day 43. Follow-up endoscopic study showed improvement in the esophagogastric varices (esophageal varices [EV]: locus superior [Ls], no varicose appearance [F0], absent red color signs [RC0], gastric varices [GV]: adjacent to the cardiac orifice [Lg-c], no varicose appearance [F0], absent red color signs [RC0]) at 6 months after the operation. We also confirmed the improvement of esophagogastric varices by serial examinations of CT."
CD008759,0,1319901,0,Chronic liver disease in Ethiopia: a clinical study with emphasis on identifying common causes.,"Between July 1986 and April 1989, 334 hospitalized adult Ethiopian patients with chronic liver disease were studied according to a protocol to define their clinical features and to identify risk factors with the aim of preventive intervention. Of these, 14 had chronic hepatitis, 208 cirrhosis and 112 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Both clinical and histological diagnostic criteria were employed. A detailed questionnaire was used to document demographic and clinical data. A common clinical presentation among patients with chronic hepatitis was darkening of the face and hands with or without hypertrichosis of the face and blisters over the dorsi of the hands. This overt or latent form of porphyrea cutanea tarda (PCT) responds to chloroquine. Patients with cirrhosis of the liver commonly present for the first time with ascites, splenomegaly, haematemesis and/or melena from oesophageal varices, and mental changes due to hepatic encephalopathy. Overt or latent forms of PCT are also common features. Peculiar to these cirrhotics is the rarity of spider naevi, gynaecomastia, testicular atrophy, Dupuytren's contracture, parotid gland enlargement and clubbing of the fingers. Exhaustion, loss of appetite, rapid loss of weight, right upper quadrant and/or epigastric pain (all often of less than 6 months' duration, a big, hard, tender and grossly nodular liver with bruit, signs of portal hypertension, and/or hepatic encephalopathy, in a young male with a rapid down hill course characterize the Ethiopian patient with HCC. Serum anti-nuclear factor, anti-mitochondrial anti-bodies and anti-smooth muscle anti-bodies were absent in those with chronic hepatitis and were uncommon in the cirrhotics and HCC cases. One or more hepatitis B virus markers were found in 86% of chronic hepatitis, 88% cirrhosis and 78% HCC and the HBsAg carrier state was found in 36%, 29% and 23%, respectively. Among the HBsAg carriers, HBeAg positivity was less common than anti-HBe but anti-HDV was significantly higher than in the healthy general population. Alphafetoprotein (AFP) levels greater than 500 mg/ml were present in 16 (8%) cirrhotics and 58 (52%) patients with HCC. Histologically, 3 of the chronic hepatitis patients had progressed to cirrhosis, 8 of the cirrhotic patients had chronic active hepatitis and 85% of HCC cases occurred in a background of macronodular cirrhosis. Three cirrhotics developed HCC during follow-up.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

Hepatosplenomegaly with preservation of liver function and esophageal varices were demonstrated. Histologically, portal alterations were consistent and prominent and included subintimal sclerosis of the intrahepatic venous branches and telangiectases. Angiographic patterns were variable, but all exhibited intrahepatic portal venous obstruction. In three patients, there was an association with extrahepatic portal vein obstruction at different sites. Our data suggest that intrahepatic portal vein thrombosis could be the primary disorder in hepatoportal sclerosis, which may vary in extent and site, involving the intrahepatic branches of the portal vein with or without the involvement of the portal trunk. Combined clinical, angiographic, and pathologic data can contribute to a better understanding of hepatoportal sclerosis in children."

CD008759,0,11380442,0,Hepatic fibrosis plays a central role in the pathogenesis of thrombocytopenia in patients with chronic viral hepatitis.,"The pathogenesis of thrombocytopenia in chronic hepatitis is not well known. This study evaluated the relationship between liver injury, serum thrombopoietin, splenomegaly and thrombocytopenia in chronic viral hepatitis. Two hundred and nine patients were enrolled, 85 with splenomegaly and 124 without. Thrombocytopenia was present in 71% and 23% of patients with or without splenomegaly respectively. In subjects with low platelet count, those with splenomegaly showed significantly lower platelet numbers than those without splenomegaly. The spleen size correlated with portal hypertension. An inverse correlation between spleen size and platelet count was observed (r = -0.54; P < 0.0001). In patients without splenomegaly, thrombocytopenia was associated with the grade of fibrosis; platelet counts were the highest in patients with fibrosis 0-2, lower in those with grade 3 (P < 0.008) and lowest in those with grade 4 (P < 0.05). These findings were independent of demographic and biochemical characteristics, hepatic necroinflammatory activity, portal hypertension and splenomegaly. Patients with normal platelet counts showed higher thrombopoietin levels than those with low platelet counts (P < 0.0001). An inverse correlation between thrombopoietin levels and fibrosis grade was observed (r = - 0.50; P < 0.0001). Median thrombopoietin levels were 58 and 27 pg/ml for fibrosis grade 0-1 and grade 4 respectively (P < 0.001). These data indicate that advanced hepatic fibrosis, causing an altered production of thrombopoietin and portal hypertension, plays the central role in the pathogenesis of thrombocytopenia in chronic viral hepatitis."

The patient is a 47-year-old male with a history of polymyositis who presented to the emergency room with complaints of lightheadedness and melena for 2 days. On initial presentation, the patient had positive orthostatic vital signs. He was found to be anemic with presenting hemoglobin of 5.8 g/dl (compared with 13.4 g/dl 4 months prior to presentation). The patient was aggressively resuscitated with intravenous fluid and blood transfusions. An emergency esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed which showed isolated gastric varices in the fundus of the stomach, with no active bleeding or high-risk stigmata. Abdominal computed tomography revealed focal splenic vein thrombosis and splenomegaly with ill-defined hypodensities. Portal and superior mesenteric veins were patent. Mild edema was seen surrounding the spleen and non-specific abdominal lymphadenopathy was also reported. A surgical consultation recommended an urgent splenectomy. Pathology of the removed spleen revealed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Positron emission tomography-computed tomography revealed lymphomatous disease in the thorax, abdomen, pelvis and bone marrow. The patient was subsequently started on chemotherapy."

Thrombosis and occlusion of the portal vein leads to portal hypertension with enlarged spleen and the development of porto-systemic collaterals. The main clinical presentation is gastroesophageal variceal bleeding and hematologic abnormalities due to splenomegaly (hyperspleenismus-pancytopenia). We described the young patient with splenomegaly and extensive cavernous transformation of portal vein. The patient had thrombosis portal vein in early childhood and massive bleeding from large oesophageal varices at age 13. Full clinical evaluation is required because of abdominal pain. The liver is histologicaly and functionally normal. Diagnosis of cavernous transformation of the portal vein is confirmed by abdominal ultrasography, color Doppler ultrasonography and CT angiography. Oesophagogastroscopy reveals almost complete reduction of oesophageal varices, but confirms portal gastropathy as a source of patient's complaints. Natural course of PVT in this patient shows possibility of full reduction of oesophageal varices, but still the presence of different consequences of portal hypertension."

All parameters were markedly altered in the disease groups. Reduced levels of Fg, Plg, alpha 2-AP and PAI were associated with increasing levels of PA, t-PA, DD and FDP. Alterations were most marked in the group complicated by acute bleeding. It was concluded that these patients have an enhanced fibrinolytic state. This was probably aggravated in the haematemesis group by an acute haemostatic imbalance that superimposed the low grade chronic DIC reported in cases of hepatosplenic schistosomiasis."

CD008759,0,12938529,0,Preliminary clinical application of contrast-enhanced MR portography.,"The clinical application of contrast enhanced (CE) MR was evaluated. A total of 66 CE MR portograms were obtained by performing fast imaging with steady procession (FISP) technique on a 1.5-T Siemens magnetom vision. A maximum intensity projection algorithm was also employed to include all vessels in a single image. The patency of portal venous system, the presence and extent of varices were also evaluated. The results showed that all images had diagnostic quality. Main portal vein (MPV) and its 4th-6th level intrahepatic branches were visualized in 10 normal persons serving as control. The diameter of MPV, splenic vein and superior mesenteric vein was 1.02 +/- 0.21, 0.8 +/- 0.15, 0.8 +/- 0.26 cm respectively, which were significantly lower than that in portal hypertension patients (1.38 +/- 0.27, 1.26 +/- 0.18, 1.24 +/- 0.18 cm, respectively). In 23 preoperative cases of portal hypertension, dilated portal vein and tortuous enlarged splenic vein were found in 23 cases; esophageal and coronary varices in 12 and 19 cases, respectively. In 7 postoperative re-examined cases with portal hypertension, the flow velocity and flow of MPV were decreased in all cases and esophageal varices could still be observed in 3 cases. New vessels appeared in the great curvature of stomach in 2 cases. In 20 cases of liver carcinoma, occlusion of MPV or its intrahepatic branches were showed in 14, compression and dislocation of intrahepatic portal vein were found in 6. In other 6 cases, 2 were splenic venous thrombosis and 4 were tumors in the intestine or retro-peritoneum. It is concluded that three-dimensional CE MR portography is an accurate technique for evaluating the portal venous system. It is a reliable and noninvasive technique that can provide important information for the evaluation of patients' condition before TIPSS and liver transplantation."

He was clinically diagnosed as having Caroli's disease by physical examination and image analyses study. The patient died after seven years and three months from the onset of the disease on account of renal function impairment. An autopsy was performed, revealing cystic dilatation of the intrahepatic bile duct, associated with a cirrhotic liver and also evidence of portal hypertension, substantiated by esophageal varices and splenomegaly. The liver weighed approximately 2,200 g. A histological investigation revealed typical morphological evidence of cirrhotic glomerulopathy and tubular degeneration with the presence of calcium casts in the dilated tubuli.

In this paper, the pathogenesis of the cirrhotic change, biliary duct abnormality and potential malignant transformation in the liver are discussed in relation to Caroli's disease."
CD008759,0,20714008,0,Hepatitis C and hepatocellular carcinoma.,"Chronic hepatitis C virus infection is a well-recognized risk factor for occurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In Europe, Oceania and America, chronic hepatitis C and alcoholic cirrhosis are the main risk factors for HCC. In Latin America, a few retrospective and one prospective study have also shown the predominant role played by hepatitis C in this setting. Furthermore, the incidence of HCC has been increasing in industrialized countries in the last decades; partially as a consequence of the increase in HCV-related cirrhosis (as the long-term sequel of the peak of infections occurring 2-4 decades ago). The main risk factor for HCC development in patients with hepatitis C is the presence of cirrhosis. Among patients with hepatitis C and cirrhosis, the annual incidence rate of HCC ranges between 1-8%, being higher in Japan (4-8%) intermediate in Italy (2-4%) and lower in USA (1.4%). Some studies have also found that HCC may be the first complication to develop and the more frequent cause of death in the compensated HCV-associated cirrhosis. Other risk factors for HCC occurrence are older age at infection, male gender, decreased platelet count, esophageal varices, presence of porphyria cutanea tarda, liver steatosis or diabetes, infection with genotype 1b, coinfection with hepatitis B virus or with HIV and chronic alcoholism. Many studies and also meta-analysis have reported that antiviral therapy based on interferon may reduce the incidence of HCC in chronic hepatitis C, especially in patients with sustained virologic response. Patients with HCV-related cirrhosis should undergo surveillance for HCC."

Doppler ultrasound was used to assess PVT in 48 patients (group 1) who had received sclerotherapy for variceal hemorrhage as well as in 52 patients (group 3) with cirrhosis and portal hypertension who had not received sclerotherapy. Assessment of PVT was made at the time of surgery in 24 patients (group 2) who had received sclerotherapy for variceal hemorrhage, failed therapy, and had portacaval shunt surgery or received liver transplantation for liver failure. One patient had splenectomy for symptoms related to a massively enlarged spleen. The incidence of PVT in group 1 was 10%, in group 2 was 13%, and in group 3 was 10%. The incidence of PVT in the three groups was not significantly different statistically.

CD008759,0,2642352,0,Hemodynamic study of occlusion of the splenic vein caused by carcinoma of the pancreas.,"The most common cause of occlusion of the splenic vein is pancreatic disease, such as pancreatitis or carcinoma of the pancreas. As compared with benign causes, carcinoma of the pancreatic body or tail may readily involve not only the splenic vein, but also, eventually, the splenic artery. Therefore, the clinical features of occlusion of the splenic vein may be profoundly altered according to the nature of the underlying causes. In an attempt to clarify the pathophysiologic findings and hemodynamic mechanism of occlusion of the splenic vein associated with carcinoma of the pancreas, three patient reports were selected from our past experience. Upon analyzing the clinical course of these patients, three consecutive phases may be distinguished. Phase 1 is the insidious or latent phase represented by Patient No. 1. The splenic vein is partially occluded and gastric varices or splenomegaly has not developed. Phase 2, the collateral developing phase, is represented by Patient No. 2. The splenic vein is completely occluded while the splenic artery is patent, resulting in marked gastric varices and splenomegaly. Phase 3 is the vanishing phase and is represented by Patient No. 3. The occlusion of the splenic artery is superimposed on the occlusion of the splenic vein, causing gastric varices to vanish and the enlarged spleen to shrink."

In the case of liver cirrhosis, the phagocytic activity of RES (K value) was markedly diminished, and a negative correlation between the K value and alpha 2-M was recognized in endotoxemia. These results suggest that endotoxemia in liver cirrhosis is based on spillover of endotoxins from portal flow."

Effectiveness of ESA was evaluated by a decrease in spleen size, hypersplenism, disappearance of esophageal varices and improvement in blood count. The results show that chronic embolization of the splenic artery in children is relatively safe and effective surgical treatment for portal hypertension. It lessens portal hypertension, reduces and in some cases eliminates hypersplenism and splenomegaly. Furthermore, being pathogenically sound it may be operation of choice in treatment of chronic hepatitis with portal hypertension and is well tolerated by children."

A 44-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with severe epigastralgia, nausea and tarry stool. Two years previously he had undergone endoscopic sclerotherapy for esophageal varices caused by alcoholic liver cirrhosis. Endoscopy revealed an open ulcer with a bleeding vessel in the duodenal bulb, and sclerotherapy was performed by clipping the vessel and injecting 20 ml of 0.2% epinephrine. His platelet count was 3.5x10(4)/mul. Twelve hours later, he again developed epigastralgia and hypotension. Emergency computed tomography and ultrasonography revealed an intramural hematoma, 15x18 cm in diameter, at the dorsal and lateral duodenum. Endoscopy and upper gastrointestinal series revealed severe stenosis of the duodenal lumen caused by intramural hematoma. He received parenteral feeding for 22 days and within 8 weeks the hematoma was gradually absorbed using conservative management. Intramural duodenal hematoma may be diagnosed as a complication of the endoscopic procedure in a patient with a bleeding tendency, such as liver cirrhosis."

CD008759,0,11565131,0,Assessment of portal hypertension in humans.,"Patients suspected of having portal hypertension (either by clinical history, physical examination, or previous diagnosis) should undergo ultrasonography and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. Ultrasonography, preferably using the duplex technique, can disclose the patency of the portal venous system, the presence of signs of portal hypertension (splenomegaly, portocollateral vessels, repermeabilization of the umbilical vein, and so forth) and provide additional information about liver, biliary, or pancreatic diseases that may be the cause of portal hypertension. Endoscopy can assess the presence and size of gastroesophageal varices, the appearance of the variceal wall, and the presence and severity of portal hypertensive gastropathy. Patients showing a patent portal vein should have hepatic vein catheterization to evaluate the presence of presinusoidal, sinusoidal, or postsinusoidal portal hypertension. Patients in whom presinusoidal portal hypertension is suspected (those having esophageal varices with an HVPG below 10 mm Hg) should have liver biopsy and percutaneous transhepatic measurement of portal pressure. In sinusoidal portal hypertension, the results of endoscopy and HVPG measurement are decisive for the therapeutic management of the patients. The authors' results indicate that, before starting prophylactic therapy with beta-blockers, all patients should undergo at least an hepatic vein catheterization to assess HVPG; it would be preferable to have a variceal pressure measurement also. These measurements must be repeated 3 to 4 weeks after the final dose of therapy has been reached to assess the risk of variceal bleeding or rebleeding."

Two hundred and seventy-four HCV/HIV-coinfected, previously naïve individuals with compensated cirrhosis enrolled in one Spanish prospective cohort who received peg-IFN/RBV were included in this study. The frequency of severe bleeding and sustained virological response (SVR) rate were compared between patients with a pretreatment platelet count ≤70,000/mm(3) and >70,000/mm(3), respectively. Sixty-one (22 %) patients had a baseline platelet count ≤70,000/mm(3). The median (Q1-Q3) pretreatment platelet count was 58,000 (49,000-65,000) cells/mm(3) in the platelet ≤70,000 group and 129,000 (102,500-166,000) cells/mm(3) in the platelet >70,000 group (p < 0.0001). Seventeen (28 %) subjects of the platelet ≤70,000 group and 71 (33 %) patients of the platelet >70,000 group achieved SVR (p = 0.4). Only 2 (3.2 %) patients in the platelet ≤70,000 group developed a severe hemorrhagic event, specifically esophageal variceal bleeding.

For that reason, efforts have been made to develop noninvasive methods for characterization of EV. The aim of this study was to explore the value of platelet count to spleen size ratio (PSR) for noninvasive prediction and characterization of EV in patients with alcoholic liver cirrhosis (ALC). One hundred and seventeen patients (20 females and 97 males, mean age 60.7) with ALC were included in our research. All patients underwent endoscopic examination upon which the EV were classified as small (< 5 mm), large (> 5 mm), or absent. Spleen size (bipolar diameter in mm) was assessed by ultrasound. Platelet count to spleen diameter ratio was calculated and the values obtained were compared to the presence, size and risk of bleeding from EV as defined by endoscopy. No significant difference in PSR could be found between patients without and with EV (1.341 ± 0.725 vs. 1.053 ± 0.636, respectively; p = 0.06). The PSR was significantly different between the patients with small and large EV (1.103 ± 0.689 vs. 0.876 ± 0.314; p < 0.05) with a cut-off value of 1.141 (sensitivity 94.7%, specificity 38.2%, AUROC = 0.656; p = 0.042). The value of PSR below 1.182 pointed to patients at risk from variceal bleeding with 91.7% sensitivity and 38.5% specificity (AUROC = 0.625, p = 0.035). Based on our results, it is not possible to recommend the use of PSR as the exclusive noninvasive indicator for the presence, size and bleeding risk from EV due to its low specificity for these categories in patients with ALC."

Efforts have been made to develop non-invasive predictive models that may correlate with LC and EV. The role of liver stiffness measurement (LSM)- and spleen stiffness measurement (SSM) by transient elastography (TE) in the diagnosis of LC and prediction of EV was studied on 90 subjects selected from the outpatient clinics of Bakhash Hospitals. They were classified into three groups: GI included 10 healthy volunteers as a control group, GII included 20 chronic hepatitis (CH) patients and GIII included 60 cirrhotic patients. Patients in GIII were further subdivided equally into two subgroups A & B according to presence or absence of EV. GIII patients were evaluated by gastroscope for screening and grading of EV. All groups were subjected to complete blood picture, liver and kidney function testes and abdominal ultrasonography as well as LSM (right lobe) and SSM by using fibroscan. LS were significantly higher in LC patients as compared with CH patients and controls.

Finding at least moderate hepatic fibrosis or gastroesophageal varices (GOV) at oesophago-gastroduodenoscopy (OGD) has been an indication for combined transplantation. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is a sensitive method for detection of GOV. We hypothesized that EUS would detect early GOV and decrease the need for liver biopsy. Sixteen children, median age 13 months (range, 7-88), being assessed for intestinal transplant underwent simultaneous OGD and EUS. In 9 of 16 patients the results of OGD and EUS were concordant, that is, both positive (2) or both negative (7) for GOV. In seven patients, GOV were only identified by EUS. Liver biopsy was avoided in four of these cases. EUS is superior to OGD for detecting GOV in children with intestinal failure-associated liver disease and results in fewer liver biopsies being necessary."

Particularly a lower K.ICG rate compared to the Rmax rate was found in many cases of liver cirrhosis accompanied by esophageal varices and idiopathic portal hypertension. On the other hands, we performed multiple regression analysis on 12 other liver function tests. K.ICG was strongly related to platelet count, circulatory blood volume, and albumin, all factors relating to portal hypertension. Rmax largely depended on LCAT, A/G ratio, and cholinesterase, which are Therefore, the dissociation between K.ICG and Rmax was caused by differences in the characteristic of each disease."

There is little data on the effect of side-to-side lieno-renal (SSLR) shunt on oesophageal variceal size, splenic size and splenic pulp pressure (SPP) in patents with non-cirrhotic portal hypertension. We evaluated pre- and postoperatively endoscopic grading of varices, splenic size and SPP for predicting shunt patency in 86 patients with non-cirrhotic portal hypertension: 56 with extrahepatic portal venous obstruction (EHPVO) and 30 with non-cirrhotic portal fibrosis (NCPF). The EHPVO patients with patent shunts (n = 47) showed significant reduction in SPP (pre-operative 43.56 +/- 7.9 vs postoperative 29.96 +/- 0.5 vs 0.92 +/- 0.8). Patients with blocked shunt (n = 9) did not show significant reduction in SPP and varices grades. However, there was reduction in spleen size (8.6 +/- 3.0 vs 6.3 +/- 4.3). In the NCPF group, 28 had patent shunts and showed significant reduction in SPP (46.3 +/- 13.5 vs 33.8 +/- 7.6 cm of saline), splenic size (9.1 +/- 3.3 vs 6.8 +/- 4.6 cm below costal margin) and varices grades (2.8 +/- 0.7 vs 1.05 +/- 0.96). As only two patients with NCPF had blocked shunts, no statistical comparison between patients with patent and patients with blocked shunts could be done. In conclusion, following SSLR, there is a significant reduction in SPP and varices grades in patients with patent shunts. Endoscopic grading of varices can be used to predict shunt patency. However, spleen size is not a good criteria for predicting shunt patency."

We attempted to determine the relationship between the liver or spleen stiffness and the presence of ascites or esophageal varices by acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) imaging. A total of 33 chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients (median age 68; range 51-84) were enrolled. We evaluated the relationship between the liver or spleen stiffness and indicators of portal hypertension as well as clinical and biochemical parameters. Fourteen healthy volunteers were used for validating the accuracy of AFRI imaging. The liver and spleen stiffness increased significantly with progression of liver disease. A significant positive correlation was observed between the liver and spleen stiffness. However, spleen stiffness, but not liver stiffness, was significantly associated with the presence of ascites (P < 0.05), while there was no significant association between the spleen stiffness and spleen index/presence of esophageal varices in CHC patients. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve based on the spleen stiffness was 0.80.

A 62-year-old man with hepatic cirrhosis secondary to hepatitis C and documented portal hypertension was admitted with hypersplenism and bleeding esophageal varices. Endoscopic ligation successfully controlled acute bleeding, but blood loss continued over the next 45 days. Bleeding secondary to portal-hypertensive gastropathy was diagnosed endoscopically.

CD008759,0,23485521,0,Cholesteryl ester storage disease: review of the findings in 135 reported patients with an underdiagnosed disease.,"Cholesteryl ester storage disease (CESD) is caused by deficient lysosomal acid lipase (LAL) activity, predominantly resulting in cholesteryl ester (CE) accumulation, particularly in the liver, spleen, and macrophages throughout the body. The disease is characterized by microvesicular steatosis leading to liver failure, accelerated atherosclerosis and premature demise. Although CESD is rare, it is likely that many patients are unrecognized or misdiagnosed. Here, the findings in 135 CESD patients described in the literature are reviewed. Diagnoses were based on liver biopsies, LAL deficiency and/or LAL gene (LIPA) mutations. Hepatomegaly was present in 99.3% of patients; 74% also had splenomegaly. When reported, most patients had elevated serum total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, and transaminases (AST, ALT, or both), while HDL-cholesterol was decreased. All 112 liver biopsied patients had the characteristic pathology, which is progressive, and includes microvesicular steatosis, which leads to fibrosis, micronodular cirrhosis, and ultimately to liver failure. Pathognomonic birefringent CE crystals or their remnant clefts were observed in hepatic cells. Extrahepatic manifestations included portal hypertension, esophageal varices, and accelerated atherosclerosis. Liver failure in 17 reported patients resulted in liver transplantation and/or death. Genotyping identified 31 LIPA mutations in 55 patients; 61% of mutations were the common exon 8 splice-junction mutation (E8SJM(-1G>A)), for which 18 patients were homozygous. Genotype/phenotype correlations were limited; however, E8SJM(-1G>A) homozygotes typically had early-onset, slowly progressive disease. Supportive treatment included cholestyramine, statins, and, ultimately, liver transplantation.

Recently esophageal varices have been well controlled by endoscopic sclerotherapy, and the surgical treatment may be indicated in older children complicated with severe hypersplenism and marked splenomegaly, which are resistant for sclerotherapy. As a surgical procedure, splenectomy with periesophago-gastric devascularization (Hassab's operation) seems to be very useful for portal hypertension by biliary cirrhosis. The reoperation, hepaticoenterostomy, was performed in 3 patients with biliary reobstruction. All three patients are alive and well, and two of them are at 19 years (university student) and 24 years (married life) of age.

There were 324 consecutive patients with portal hypertension due to cirrhosis (n = 229), non cirrhotic portal fibrosis (NCPF: n = 64) and extrahepatic portal venous obstruction (EHPVO: n = 31). During this period, 146 patients with dyspepsia, 35 with splenomegaly and 32 with ascites due to varied causes served as negative and positive controls. Real time ultrasonography using a 3.5 MHz linear array scanner was performed in a fasting state in all subjects. Portal and splenic vein diameter greater than 10 mm, splenomegaly, hepatic and splenic hilar collaterals were suggestive of portal hypertension. Non visualization of the portal vein which was replaced by a cavernoma had a diagnostic accuracy of 98% in EHPVO. Splenic infarcts and absence of ascites were features of non cirrhotic portal hypertension (NCPF and EHPVO). Sonography had an overall diagnostic accuracy of 80%. A stepwise logistic regression with multivariate analysis using discriminate function showed that collaterals at the hepatic and splenic hilum, hepatomegaly, ascites and splenic infarcts were independent markers to differentiate cirrhotic from noncirrhotic causes of portal hypertension. The discriminate equation generated had a mismatch of 9.8%. Correlations between the sonographic signs demonstrated that the variceal grade correlated positively with the presence of splenic hilar collaterals and the liver size inversely correlated with presence of ascites.

The aim of this study was to evaluate morbidity from CHF in ARPKD post renal transplantation. Data were analyzed for six males and eight females, transplanted for ARPKD (mean age 8.3 years, range 1-22.3 years) at the University of Minnesota between 1972 and 1998. Follow-up was for a mean of 14.5 years (range 3.1-33.6 years). One and 5 years patient survival rates were 93% and 86%, respectively. Overall five patients (36%) died; 4/5 deaths were related to CHF. Causes of death were hepatic failure immediately post transplant (n = 1), septicemia related to bile duct dilatation (n = 3) and multiorgan failure (n = 1). One and 5years graft survival rates were 87% and 70%, respectively. One patient had a combined liver-kidney transplant and two were re-transplanted. Initial signs of CHF were splenomegaly (n = 5), hepatosplenomegaly (n = 4) and gastrointestinal bleed (n = 2). Progression of CHF through childhood included hypersplenism (n = 7), esophageal varices with gastrointestinal bleeding (n = 5) and bile duct dilatation (n = 5). Portal hypertension was treated with portosystemic shunt (n = 3), sclerotherapy (n = 2), banding of varices (n = 1) and transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (n = 1). Of the nine survivors (mean age 12.8 years) 78% have functioning grafts (one liver-kidney transplant), 63% have portal hypertension and 22% have asymptomatic biliary dilatation. Complications of CHF developed in 79% of children who received a renal transplant for ARPKD. Mortality related to CHF occurred in 29% and accounted for 80% (4/5) of the deaths."
CD008759,0,7789679,0,Evaluation of the effects of esophageal varicosclerosants on local vascular occlusion and systemic blood coagulation.,"The efficacy and safety of the various sclerosants available for esophageal sclerotherapy have not been adequately investigated. In the present study, we experimentally evaluated the effects on local vascular occlusion and systemic blood coagulation of five sclerosants: 5% ethanolamine oleate, 99.5% ethanol, 2% aethoxysclerol, thrombin, and n-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate. The effects were tested after injection into the auricular vein of rabbits. Prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, plasma fibrinogen level, and peripheral blood platelet count were measured before injection and 5 minutes, 1 hour, 1 day, and 7 days later. Histologic examinations were then made of the auricular vein, lungs, liver, spleen, and kidneys. In the initial period after injection of ethanol or thrombin, fibrinogen level and platelet count were significantly reduced. Except for thrombin, none of the drugs affected prothrombin time or partial thromboplastin time. Local thrombosis took place after the injection of ethanolamine oleate, ethanol, and aethoxysclerol, whereas thrombin injection did not result in local thrombosis or vascular occlusion. Cyanoacrylate produced no local thrombus formation but caused vascular occlusion. Over-dosing of thrombin and ethanol led to sudden death of animals. These findings suggest that it is necessary to assess further the safety of intravascular use of thrombin, that the other drugs seem to be usable, and that careful consideration should be given to the excess use of ethanol in clinical settings. The present animal model may be useful for evaluating various sclerosants, although findings may not be applicable to humans because of differences in vascular size."
CD008759,0,20970162,0,Severe hepatosplenic schistosomiasis: clinicopathologic study of 102 cases undergoing splenectomy.,"We present the preoperative findings of 102 patients who underwent successful splenectomy for advanced schistosomiasis japonica. All patients were symptomatic for schistosomiasis and had splenomegaly greater than or equal to II according to the Hackett criteria. Before surgery, all patients underwent clinical examination including full blood count; fibrinogen and serum protein levels; liver function tests; and serology for hepatitis B, C, and D. Ultrasound examination of the liver and spleen and liver histology for evidence of pathology were also undertaken. Ninety patients had a treatment history for schistosomiasis. Fifty-six patients were seropositive for hepatitis B virus antibody, and 6 patients were seropositive for hepatitis C virus antibody. Immunohistochemical testing of the liver samples confirmed that 45 patients were positive for hepatitis B virus surface antigen, thereby indicating active infection. A total of 66.7% of patients had fibrosis stages II to III by ultrasound; and 76.5% of patients had portal vein inner diameter greater than 12 mm, indicating portal vein hypertension. A total of 83.2% of patients showed various stages of esophageal varicosis via x-ray, and 81.4% had fibrotic stages III to IV by liver biopsy. Coinfection with hepatitis B virus accelerated the development of liver fibrosis. There was moderate concordance between the fibrosis assessed by ultrasonography and histopathology, indicating that ultrasound underestimates the true pathology. Combined assessment is needed to improve the diagnosis of clinical hepatic fibrosis."

Prevalence of infection dropped from 53% to 34%, and intensity of infection (> or = 400 eggs/g of faeces) from 31% to 18%. There was a reduction in hepatomegaly and hepatosplenomegaly, although splenomegaly alone was unchanged. Prevalence of periportal fibrosis decreased from 14% to 10%. Endoscopic investigation of patients with fibrosis showed a reduction in oesophageal varices from 47% to 30%. Mortality due to bleeding varices was high (community-wide, up to 11/100 infected patients with bleeding). Thus praziquantel mass treatment can be spaced to a much longer period, reducing the expense of treatment, delivery and distribution."

This procedure was especially useful for treatment of splenomegaly and cytopenia because a constant reduction of spleen dimensions and increase in platelet count were registered. The effectiveness of transcatheter embolization and follow-up are based on clinic, hematologic and sonographic findings. We believe sonographic monitoring to be very useful both to evaluate splenomegaly and signs of portal hypertension and to reveal splenic complications (abscesses).

CD008759,0,3665300,0,Radioisotopic flow scanning for portal blood flow and portal hypertension.,"The use of a simple, noninvasive, isotope scanning technique for the determination of relative portal blood flow and detection of portal hypertension is described. Using this technique the presence of portal hypertension was demonstrated in seven of nine patients known to have elevated portal venous pressure. By contrast, esophageal varices were demonstrated in only five of these patients, illustrating the potential value of the method. Furthermore, this technique has been adapted to the study of portal blood flow in patients with myeloproliferative disorders with splenomegaly but without disturbances in hepatic architecture. Results demonstrate that the high relative splenic flow resulting from the presence of splenomegaly may in turn be associated with elevated relative portal blood flow and portal hypertension. The theoretic reasons for the development of flow-related portal hypertension and its relationship to splenic blood flow are discussed."

We evaluated the course of these patients to establish if any putative latent myeloproliferative disorder influenced the clinical course compared to those with a known cause. Among 132 EHVO patients, 78 (59%) had a known etiology, 7 (5%) with an overt myeloproliferative disorder. The ""idiopathic"" group had 54 patients; 24 (13 men, 11 women) were diagnosed after 15 years of age, (median 38 years, range 17-70) with a median follow up of 96 months (19-372). Only 2 (8%) developed an overt myeloproliferative disorder. These 24 had a similar pattern of bleeding and onset of ascites as those with known cause. In EHVO failure to diagnose a latent myeloproliferative disorder does not influence the course of variceal bleeding, and thus has little prognostic significance."

Various treatment strategies for the management of bleeding stomal varices have thus far been reported. We report the case of a 60-year-old woman with refractory recurrent bleeding from varices in a sigmoid stoma, along with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and marked splenomegaly. A physical examination revealed that the skin was discolored and bluish around the circumference of the sigmoid stoma. The venous phase of a celiac arteriogram revealed an afferent vein from the splenic vein and another from the inferior mesenteric vein, and veins draining into the left superficial epigastric vein. A balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration (BRTO) procedure was performed. The skin around the stoma, initially discolored bluish, improved markedly. After 10 months of follow-up, the patient has remained well without further episodes of stomal bleeding.

EGD showed non-bleeding Grade 1 esophageal varices and a clean-based duodenal ulcer. Colonoscopy was normal. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed liver cirrhosis with mild ascites, paraumbilical varices, and splenomegaly. He had multiple episodes of hematochezia, requiring repeated blood transfusions. Capsule endoscopy identified the bleeding site in the jejunum. Concurrently, CT angiography showed paraumbilical varices inseparable from a loop of small bowel, which had herniated through an umbilical hernia. The lumen of this loop of small bowel opacified in the delayed phase, which suggested variceal bleeding into the small bowel. Portal vein thrombosis was present. As he had severe coagulopathy and extensive paraumbilical varices, surgery was of high risk. He was not suitable for transjugular intrahepatic porto-systemic shunt as he had portal vein thrombosis.

Haemograms, platelet aggregation tests, flow cytometry investigations of CD41/CD42b antibody and vWF:Ag assays were performed. Mean platelet counts were low (77,522/mm3) and 82.2% of patients presented thrombocytopenia. An inverse relationship between spleen size and platelet count was seen. Macroplatelets were found in 57.1% of patients, indicating good bone-marrow response, but were insufficient to compensate for the decrease in platelets due to splenomegaly. Decreased or absent platelet aggregation was seen in 50% of patients, probably due to low platelet counts. Markers for GPIIb/IIIa were normal in more than 90% of patients, not supporting the increased capture and destruction of platelets in the spleen that is hypothesized to occur with cirrhosis. Similar to cirrhosis, vWF:Ag levels were high or very high in 70.5% of patients. High levels of vWF:Ag were associated with platelet counts <100,000/mm3, larger spleen diameter and oesophageal varices. In conclusion, hepatosplenic schistosomiasis leads to a lower platelet count due to pooling in the spleen and, consequently, impaired aggregation, but not to increased capture and destruction of platelets in the spleen. High vWF:Ag levels probably promote stabilization of platelet microaggregates and prevent minor manifestations of thrombocytopenia such as petechiae, ecchymosis and gingival bleeding."

There was no abnormality in the countenance, cardiovascular system, or vertebral column. Except for the brother who died from an accident, jaundice gradually increased. Death followed due to cirrhosis. Liver biopsy specimens of these 2 patients showed diminution of interlobular bile ducts with no significant cholangitis. At autopsy, the livers of the 2 patients showed biliary cirrhosis without extrahepatic biliary obstruction. In both cases there was an accessory lobe on the right hepatic lobe. Histologically, septal bile ducts showed pronounced papillary proliferations of the epithelium; there was also a decrease in the number of small interlobular bile ducts. Excess copper accumulation in the liver was ascertained. It is suggested that the disease in the 2 autopsied cases is intrahepatic cholestatic cirrhosis due to hypoplasia of the intrahepatic biliary trees."

CD008759,0,26025214,0,Idiopathic non-cirrhotic portal hypertension: a review.,"Idiopathic non-cirrhotic portal hypertension (INCPH) is a rare disease characterized of intrahepatic portal hypertension in the absence of cirrhosis or other causes of liver disease and splanchnic venous thrombosis. The etiology of INCPH can be classified in five categories: 1) immunological disorders (i.e. association with common variable immunodeficiency syndrome, connective tissue diseases, Crohn's disease, etc.), 2) chronic infections, 3) exposure to medications or toxins (e.g. azathioprine, 6- thioguanine, arsenic), 4) genetic predisposition (i.e. familial aggregation and association with Adams-Oliver syndrome and Turner disease) and 5) prothrombotic conditions (e.g. inherited thrombophilias myeloproliferative neoplasm antiphospholipid syndrome). Roughly, INCPH diagnosis is based on clinical criteria and the formal exclusion of any other causes of portal hypertension. A formal diagnosis is based on the following criteria: 1) presence of unequivocal signs of portal hypertension, 2) absence of cirrhosis, advanced fibrosis or other causes of chronic liver diseases, and 3) absence of thrombosis of the hepatic veins or of the portal vein at imaging. Patients with INCPH usually present with signs or symptoms of portal hypertension such as gastro-esophageal varices, variceal bleeding or splenomegaly. Ascites and/or liver failure can occur in the context of precipitating factors. The development of portal vein thrombosis is common. Survival is manly limited by concomitant disorders. Currently, treatment of INCPH relies on the prevention of complications related to portal hypertension, following current guidelines of cirrhotic portal hypertension. No treatment has been studied aimed to modify the natural history of the disease. Anticoagulation therapy can be considered in patients who develop portal vein thrombosis."

Over the years, several studies addressing this issue have been performed with little success. The recently proposed platelet count/spleen diameter ratio appears to be the best noninvasive predictor of esophageal varices developed so far. However, the available evidence is not yet sufficient to allow for the modification of the current policy of screening cirrhotic patients by endoscopy at the time of diagnosis to detect varices."

Spleen size, diameter, blood velocity, and flow rate of portal, splenic, and superior mesenteric veins were recorded. In patients without chronic liver disease Doppler measurements were repeated on 2 different days to assess intraobserver variability. Significant differences among the three groups were found for mean values of spleen size and diameters of portal, splenic, and superior mesenteric veins. Nevertheless, a considerable overlapping of individual data was observed. No differences were observed in mean hemodynamic measurements, except for blood velocity in portal vein and flow rate in splenic vein. The intraobserver variability for repeated Doppler measurements was clinically unacceptable for most of the variables studied. Echo-Doppler assessment of splanchnic flow seems to be an unreliable tool in the management of cystic fibrosis patients with portal hypertension at risk of esophageal varices."

A 17-year-old male patient with mild epigastric pain and splenomegaly was found to have gastric varices by gastroscopy, and SVO by selective angiography. At operation, the splenic vein was occluded by hard fibrous tissue at the splenic hilum, and thus a splenectomy was performed. A microscopic examination of the tissue revealed caseous necrosis surrounded by epithelioid cells and Langhans-type giant cells. Although there were no other findings suggesting intestinal tuberculosis, it seemed that tuberculous lymphadenitis of the splenic hilum most likely caused the occlusion of the splenic vein. Because specific tests for tuberculosis were negative in both immunohistochemical staining for bacille Calmette-Guérin and polymerase chain reaction of DNA for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the time of infection was assumed to have occurred a long time before. SVO can sometimes be seen in pancreatic diseases, but this patient with tuberculosis appears to be the first such reported case in the English literature."

Laboratory tests indicated microcytic hypochromic anemia and iron overload. We performed urgent endoscopic examination, and diagnosed bleeding from esophagogastric varices. Abdominal CT showed liver cirrhosis and marked splenomegaly, but no evidence of gastrorenal shunt. The varices were treated by Hassab's operation and splenectomy. Pathologic examination revealed hepatocytes in the cirrhotic nodules filled with iron pigment. The cause of the liver cirrhosis was considered to be due to iron overload resulting from thalassemia. We diagnosed the cause of the microcytic anemia as thalassemia by gene analysis, which revealed heterozygosity of a deletion (deltabeta thalassemia Jpn-type II) and one point mutation (-31A-->G)."
CD008759,0,6248921,0,[Pathologic-anatomic reflections on portal hypertension (author's transl)].,"Portal hypertension is defined as an increase of the portal venous pressure over 20 cm H2O or 7 mm Hg, respectively. It may be induced by different types of portal venous stenosis or obstruction, primarily by cirrhosis and fibrosis of the liver and, less frequent by posthepatic disorders such as the Budd-Chiari-syndrome or congestive heart failure. Portal hypertension is followed by ectasia and phlebosclerosis of the portal vein, by splenomegaly, ascites and by various types of collateral circulation. Among these, oesophageal varices, are most important since they often lead to acute upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage, the major complication of portal hypertension. Bleeding from oesophaeal varices is essentially based on atrophy of the squamous epithelium, caused by ischemia from local hypoxia and venous stasis. Portal hypertension and the frequently compromised blood clotting mechanism due to reduced synthesis of clotting factors in the liver aggravate the bleeding. Atrophy of the esophageal mucosa presents an area of decreased resistance likely to ulcerate with easy erosion of the varices--usually lying very superficially--; with mechanical irritation by food or peptic erosion from gastroesophageal reflux being frequent inducers of hemorrhage."

Even in very developed medical centers, this disorder is still one of the most important misdiagnoses of clinical practice. To inexperienced physicians, presenting esophageal varices and upper gastrointestinal bleeding usually prompt an unfortunate diagnosis of cirrhosis. A heterogenous clinical presentation and progression of this disorder should be recognized by physicians, and management should be directed towards some specific problems confined to this disorder. Although a genetic basis and other factors are implicated in its pathogenesis, exact underlying mechanism(s) is (are) unknown. In this review, we discuss the heterogeneity of idiopathic portal hypertension, its etiopathogenesis, clinical presentation and management issues.

Patients with thrombocytopenia may have esophageal or gastric varices secondary to portal hypertension, leading to variceal bleeding which exposes the liver to further damage. Here, we present a female pediatric patient with PSC and CD, whose progressive thrombocytopenia was successfully controlled by romiplostim, a TPO receptor agonist. The patient developed bloody diarrhea at four yr of age, and was subsequently diagnosed with PSC and CD when seven yr old. While CD was well-controlled by immunomodulators, the patient's thrombocytopenia gradually progressed resulting in petechiae (platelet count of 11 × 10(9) /L) when she was 10 yr and four months old. She responded poorly to immunoglobulin and corticosteroids. Weekly subcutaneous injection of romiplostim was therefore initiated, and platelet counts were maintained over at 50 × 10(9) /L. She was able to undergo successful LDLT without platelet transfusion seven months after the initiation of romiplostim. Romiplostim was not required after LDLT with improved platelet counts. This case report suggests that romiplostim may be effective in the treatment of thrombocytopenic children with liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension, and in eliminating the need for platelet transfusion during the peri-transplant period."

They were divided into three groups according to the modified Child's classification for cirrhotic severity, where A = good, B = fair and C = poor. In addition, the patients were divided according to the presence or absence of each of the following: ascites, splenomegaly and oesophageal varices. Radionuclide-labelled solid meals were used to evaluate gastric emptying and the 14C-urea breath test was used to detect Helicobacter pylori infection. Gastric emptying was represented by the gastric retention ratio of the solid meal at 90 min (RR90) and calculated using the following formula: the residual radioactivity within the region of interest (ROI) covering the whole stomach at 90 min divided by the initial radioactivity within the ROI at 0 min. We found that 75.7% (28/37) of the patients had abnormal gastric emptying and 45.9% (17/37) had H. pylori infection. No significant correlation was found between abnormal gastric emptying and H. pylori infection. There were no significant differences among the three groups regarding gastric emptying or H. pylori infection according to the modified Child's classification. However, the highest rates of abnormal gastric emptying and H. pylori infection were in patients in Child's class C. The differences in RR90 among patients with and without ascites, and patients with and without splenomegaly, were not significant (P > 0.05). However, there was a significant difference between the patients with and without oesophageal varices (P < 0.05).

A history of hematemesis, blood transfusion, sclerotherapy, and lower limb edema correlated with the ultrasonographic grade of periportal fibrosis. With increasing grade, the average liver size was smaller and the average spleen size was larger, as determined by physical examination and by ultrasonography. Abnormalities in serum enzyme levels were more frequent in those with thicker portal tracts. Greater diameters of the portal and splenic veins and ultrasonographically detectable collateral blood vessels were associated with increasing thickness of portal tracts. The grade of endoscopically determined esophageal varices was highly correlated with the grade of periportal fibrosis. We concluded that this method of grading accurately reflects the hemodynamic changes and provides a good estimate of the clinical status of patients who have periportal fibrosis due to schistosomiasis mansoni. Where available, it should replace clinical grading based upon the liver and spleen size as detected by physical examination."

All patients but two were Chinese war veterans seen in Taiwan about 35-55 years after their presumed infection in Mainland China. The US presentations were reviewed. The data from Doppler portal flow studies were available for 39 patients with HSJ, and compared to data from Doppler portal flow studies in 40 normal healthy volunteers and to this data in 40 patients with postnecrotic cirrhosis. A typical ""coarse reticular pattern"" due to fibrosis in the whole liver was noted in 40 patients (85%). Other findings included periportal fibrosis (15%), septum-like fibrous bands extending to the liver capsule (32%), and an apparent nodular liver surface (19%). Splenomegaly was noted in seven patients. While coexisting hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) were evident in three patients, and esophageal varices were found in three others, yet both conditions were found only in patients with positive hepatitis-B-surface antigen (HBsAg). Doppler flowmetry of the portal veins in HSJ patients showed a mean flow rate of 15.34 +/- 6.82 cm/sec, and a mean flow volume of 993.21 +/- 290.63 ml/min, both showed no significant difference from those in normal adults (p > 0.5). HSJ can be confidently diagnosed in patients with hepatic fibrosis when the hepatic pathology is presented as a coarse reticular pattern. The portal hemodynamics in HSJ patients who have been isolated from the infection site (for more than 35 years) are significantly different from portal hemodynamics in cirrhotic patients and are similar to those in healthy volunteers."

A 68-year-old man was admitted for treatment of a pancreatic body tumor. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed a honeycombed cystic mass. A celiac angiogram showed a hypervascular tumor supplied mainly by a dilated splenic artery and dorsal pancreatic artery. In the venous phase, the patent splenic vein had a large hepatopetal collateral vein via the coronary gastric vein. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy showed isolated varices of the gastric fundus. We made a preoperative diagnosis of a serous cystic tumor of the pancreas with left-sided portal hypertension and performed distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy. The resected tumor was 8 cm in diameter and had a typical honeycombed microcystic pattern with central stellate scarring. The spleen was not enlarged.

The aim of this study was to evaluate whether this protective effect is maintained in the long term and if it extends to other portal hypertension complications.
CD008759,0,17308780,0,Remodeling of hepatic vascular changes after specific chemotherapy of schistosomal periportal fibrosis.,"Hepatosplenic schistosomiasis was the first human disease in which the possibility of extensive long standing hepatic fibrosis being degraded and removed has been demonstrated. When such changes occurred, the main signs of portal hypertension (splenomegaly, esophageal varices) progressively disappeared, implying that a profound vascular remodeling was concomitantly occurring. Hepatic vascular alterations associated with advanced schistosomiasis have already been investigated. Obstruction of the intrahepatic portal vein branches, plus marked angiogenesis and compensatory hyperplasia and hypertrophy of the arterial tree are the main changes present. However, there are no data revealing how these vascular changes behave during the process of fibrosis regression. Here the mouse model of pipestem fibrosis was used in an investigation about these vascular alterations during the course of the infection, and also after treatment and cure of the disease. Animals representing the two polar hepatic forms of the infection were included: (1) ""isolated granulomas"" characterized by isolated periovular granulomas sparsely distributed throughout the hepatica parenchyma; and (2) 'pipestem fibrosis' with periovular granulomas and fibrosis being concentrated within portal spaces, before and after treatment, were studied by means of histological and vascular injection-corrosion techniques. Instances of widespread portal vein obstruction of several types were commonly found in the livers of the untreated animals. These obstructive lesions were soon repaired, and completely disappeared four months following specific treatment of schistosomiasis. Treatment was accomplished by the simultaneous administration of praziquantel and oxamniquine. The most impressive results were revealed by the technique of injection of colored masses into the portal system, followed by corrosion in strong acid. The vascular lesions of non-treated pipestem fibrosis were represented in the plastic casts by considerable diminution of the fine peripheral portal vein radicles, plus dilatation of periportal collaterals. Four months after treatment, this last picture appeared replaced by tufts of newly interwoven vessels formed along the main portal vein branches, disclosing a strong angiomatoid reparative change. Understanding about the cellular elements at play during fibro-vascular repairing changes of hepatic schistosomiasis represents a matter of considerable scientific and conceptual importance. At present time one may only speculate about the participation of some type of natural stem-cell capable of restoring the diseased liver back to normal once the cause of the disorder has been eliminated."

We encountered the case of a young male Filipino patient diagnosed with PV after the rupture of esophageal varices. The complete blood cell count showed a slight increase in white blood cells. An abdominal computed tomography scan disclosed splenomegaly and occlusion of the portal vein and collateral vessels.

CD008759,0,2214174,0,[A latent form of essential thrombocythemia presented as portal hypertension and associated with acquired von Willebrand syndrome].,"A 32 year-old male patient was admitted to our hospital because of abdominal tumor. The examination on admission showed massive splenomegaly and esophageal varices although peripheral blood cell counts were within normal limits. Exploratory laparotomy was performed with the diagnosis of portal hypertension and revealed the multiple thrombus formations in the splenic vein and the extramedullary hematopoietic findings in the spleen by the microscopic examination. In vitro colony forming assay showed the formation of spontaneous erythroid colonies in cultures of progenitor cells (from peripheral blood mononuclear cells) in erythropoietin-poor medium. Increasing thrombocytosis was observed immediately after splenectomy, and hemorrhagic diathesis of nasal bleeding and gastrointestinal bleeding were also detected. The analysis of plasma von Willebrand factor (vWF) revealed the decrease of ristocetin cofactor activity and the lack of large multimeric components of vWF. These abnormal findings observed after splenectomy led to recovery through the administration of busulfan with the improvement of thrombocytosis. Accordingly, the course of the disease clearly indicated it to be the essential thrombocythemia represented as portal vein thrombosis and in latent form with normal cell counts in peripheral blood at the time of diagnosis, and subsequently, to develop into a full-blown form associated with acquired von Willebrand syndrome following splenectomy."
CD008759,0,8621130,0,Splenic Doppler impedance indices: influence of different portal hemodynamic conditions.,"The spleen plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis and maintenance of portal hypertension. Few data exist about splenic hemodynamics evaluated by duplex sonography in this condition. Twenty-six normal subjects, 207 patients with portal hypertension of various causes, and in different splenoportal hemodynamic conditions, and 31 patients with liver transplantation were evaluated. In each patient the splenic resistive index (RI = peak systolic--end diastolic velocity/peak systolic velocity) and pulsatility index (PI = peak systolic--end diastolic velocity/mean velocity) were measured. In 17 cirrhotic patients, splenic indices were compared with portal hemodynamics as invasively evaluated by hepatic vein catheterization. In the various groups, RI and PI were respectively: normal subjects, 0.51 +/- 0.05 and 0.72 +/- 0.11; cirrhotic patients with hepatopetal portal blood flow (n = 167), 0.64 +/- 0.08 and 1.03 +/- 0.24; cirrhotic patients with hepatofugal portal flow (n = 3), 0.74 +/- 0.08 and 1.27 +/- 0.08; cirrhotic patients with portal vein thrombosis (n = 9), 0.74 +/- 0.08 and 1.36 +/- 0.34; patients with noncirrhotic obstruction of the portal system (n = 7), 0.69 +/- 0.11 and 1.16 +/- 0.28; cirrhotic patients with surgical decompression of splenic vein system (n = 21), 0.54 +/- 0.07 and 0.76 +/- 0.15; patients with liver transplantation (n = 31), 0.50 +/- 0.08 and 0.70 +/- 0.15. Both RI and PI were significantly higher in cirrhotic patients with hepatopetal portal flow compared with controls (P < .0001), and even higher in cirrhotic patients with portal vein thrombosis (P < .004 and P < .001 in comparison with RI and PI values of cirrhotic patients). In patients with noncirrhotic portal vein thrombosis, splenic impedance indices were higher than those in controls (RI and PI P < .0001). Cirrhotic patients who underwent surgery for the therapy of portal hypertension showed splenic impedance indices significantly decreased compared with other cirrhotic patients (RI and PI P < .0001). In patients who underwent liver transplantation, splenic impedance indices were the same as those in controls. In 23 of the 52 patients surgically treated (surgical shunt or liver transplantation), impedance indices were evaluated both before and after surgical treatment. All these patients showed a decrease in splenic impedance indices (RI and PI, P < .0001) after surgical treatment. RI and PI values were higher in patients with large esophageal varices as compared with patients without or with small varices (P < .02 and P < .01). RI and PI values were not related to age, mean arterial pressure, sex, Child-Turcotte-Pugh score, presence of ascites, or cause. A significant correlation was found between splenic impedance indices and portal resistance as evaluated by hepatic vein catheterization (r = .80, P < .001 for RI values; r = .87, P < .001 for PI values). In conclusion, this study shows that splenic impedance indices are increased in cirrhotic patients, and seems to demonstrate that in patients with cirrhosis these indices reflect portal vein blood flow resistance."

Laboratory evaluation of hepatic, renal, hematologic, autoimmune, or infectious disease etiology or abnormality was negative. Ultrasound revealed a normal fetus, an enlarged spleen, dilated splenic and hepatic vasculature and an enlarged liver with periportal fibrosis. Abdominal computed tomography revealed subcapsular calcifications, dilated ducts, and periportal fibrosis. Esophagogastrojejeunoscopy showed no varices. The presumptive diagnosis of hypersplenism secondary to chronic hepatosplenic schistosomiasis was made. Based on pathophysiology and literature review conservative management was elected.

Subsequently, we documented an extrahepatic portal vein obstruction and esophageal varices. After several episodes of cataclysmic upper GI bleeding a mesentero-portal shunt (MPS) was performed at 10 months. The shunt thrombosed, and after three failed attempts of thrombectomy, it was removed. One month later a splenorenal shunt was performed, and this closed spontaneously by 3 years. The patient suffered from ischemic stroke after placing the first shunt, and has spastic diplegia, left frontal lobe epilepsy, hyperactivity and attention deficit disorder, and severe psychomotor delay.

Review of the literature demonstrated that where decompensated cirrhosis is present the renal blood flow is characteristically low, although the total cardiac output is elevated. This circulatory disturbance results in the production of urine low in sodium, although normal in solute content. It also renders the kidney more vulnerable to further, sometimes minor, reductions in renal blood flow. As more patients with hepatic cirrhosis live through episodes of gastrointestinal bleeding and hepatic coma, death in acute renal failure will undoubtedly become more common."

Vague abdominal pain, increased bleeding tendency and edema were initial complaints, and hepato- or splenomegaly and ascites were found as well. Liver function tests were not or only mildly disturbed; hemolysis and pancytopenia were always present. Colloid uptake was absent at liver scintigraphy and the hepatic venous wedge pressure was increased. Esophageal varices were demonstrated. Liver biopsy showed extensive midzonal and pericentral sinusoidal dilatation. After discontinuation of azathioprine the symptoms and the extent of sinusoidal dilatation disappeared gradually, but after 1-3 years fibrosis or micronodular cirrhosis had developed and splenomegaly with hypersplenism remained. These observations strongly suggest an association between chronic use of azathioprine and the development of venous congestion of the liver with sinusoidal dilatation, eventually resulting in chronic liver disease."

In cases of chronic encephalopathy resulting from hepatic insufficiency that may be due to liver cirrhosis, the presence of a spontaneous porto-spleno-renal shunt should be considered as a distinct possibility, not only in the absence of apparent oesophageal varices and splenomegaly, but also when there is hepatopetal flow in the portal vein."

CD008759,0,1176566,0,"[Surgical treatment of cavernomas of the portal vein. 56 cases, including 42 operated cases].","The difficulty of surgical treatment of cavernomas of the portal vein results from the anatomical conditions created by this type of portal hypertension, in spite of favourable physiological conditions due to the integrity of the hepatic parenchyma. The latter is, in fact, relative after a certain length of history. This erratic course renders difficult assessment of the efficacy of methods of treatment. In the light of 56 cases, including 42 operated cases, the authors present the indications for surgery which depend on the severity and frequency of hemorrhage and also on the patient's age. When repeated bleeding occurs, a by-pass should be attempted whenever possible, if the bleeding impedes social life or growth, or if it threatens life. Mesenterico-caval anastomosis is preferable before the age of 7 years. Spleno-renal anastomosis requires a sufficient size of splenic vein. Ligature of aesophageal varices or disconnection of the oesophagus from the stomach, may be considered in cases of moderate hemorrhage. The varices may be treated by sclerosing injections after failure of a by-pass operation or in inoperable patients. Oesophago-gastrectomy is useful but should be a last resort."

The exact pathogenesis of NRH has not been established, but it's been suggested that obliteration of portal veins may initiate the nodular transformation. It is also known that this disease is associated with autoimmune disease, myeloproliferative disease, lymphoproliferative disease, primary biliary cirrhosis, and some chemotherapy agents. The patients with NRH are usually asymptomatic, yet if they have symptoms, the most common clinical manifestations are those of portal hypertension, including splenomegaly and esophageal varices with or without bleeding. We report a case of nodular regenerative hyperplasia that presented with clinical manifestations similar to those of primary biliary cirrhosis."

The prospective study took into consideration both initial fibrosis of the liver and the morphology of the porta hepatis (PH) at surgery. Kaplan-Meier survival estimates and statistical calculations demonstrated a relationship between long-term survival and histologic findings in the liver and porta hepatis. The efficacy of HPE is significantly influenced by the morphology of the PH and to a lesser extent by the initial liver fibrosis. Surgery should thus achieve pattern 1 morphology of the PH, but this is problematic because of the close relationship of the vascular and biliary structures in its two lateral zones."
CD008759,0,2050328,0,Primary biliary cirrhosis: relation between hepatic function and pulmonary function in patients who never smoked.,"We studied the relationship between selected variables of hepatic and pulmonary function in 47 patients with primary biliary cirrhosis, who were participating in a prospective study to assess sequential pulmonary function at yearly intervals. An additional 20 patients with primary biliary cirrhosis, who were liver transplant candidates awaiting transplantation, were studied. None of the 67 patients ever smoked cigarettes. Severity of primary biliary cirrhosis was characterized by histological stage and the Mayo risk score derived from a Cox regression model that used the following variables: serum bilirubin and serum albumin levels, age, prothrombin time and clinical severity of edema. Pulmonary function assessment included key variables describing expiratory airflow (forced expiratory volume in 1 sec divided by forced vital capacity) and efficiency of gas exchange (steady-state diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide). We found a significant relationship between histological stage of primary biliary cirrhosis and steady-state diffusing capacity (p = 0.02) and between the Mayo risk score for disease severity and steady-state diffusing capacity (p = 0.03). Progressive deterioration of steady-state diffusing capacity was associated with increasing severity of primary biliary cirrhosis. No relationship existed between pulmonary function and the presence of sicca complex or Sjögren's syndrome or the clinical manifestations of portal hypertension (e.g., esophageal varices, ascites and splenomegaly). No significant relationship existed between expiratory airflow and severity of primary biliary cirrhosis. We conclude that in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis who have never smoked, a statistically significant relationship exists between the severity of the liver disease and the efficiency of gas exchange measured by steady-state diffusing capacity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

All were subjected to full history taking, clinical examination, routine laboratory examinations including serum pre-albumin, abdominal ultrasonography, MELD score was calculated for all patients, Child classification for all patient and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. The results showed that platelet count was lowest in patients with varices, decrease of platelet count with increase of grading of esophageal varices. Platelet count was lowest in patients with early bleeding esophageal varices at 6 weeks in comparison to patients with bleeding esophageal varices at 4 months and patients with bleeding esophageal varices at 6 months.

The cellular immune response was assessed before and one month after splenectomy. The assessment included the enumeration of T lymphocyte subsets in vitro using monoclonal antibodies and in vivo by intradermal skin test for delayed reaction using specific Schistosoma mansoni adult antigen and non specific purified protein derivatives (P.P.D.). The result showed that the possibility of the delayed skin reaction was higher after splenectomy, also there was an increase in the number of T helper cells and reduction in number of T suppressor cell but the number of pan T cell did not significantly change. This result indicates that the ratio of T helper/T suppressor ratio improved after splenectomy with a concomitant improvement of the immunological response of the patients."

It is of two types, acute and chronic portal vein thrombosis. Anticoagulation therapy is recommended for all patients with acute portal vein thrombosis. Chronic portal vein thrombosis is characterised by the development o f portal hypertension. Bleeding from ruptured varices is the main complication. In the absence of bleeding, continuous anticoagulation therapy should be considered for chronic portal vein thrombosis in whom an underlying prothrombotic factor is to be identified. Here in this report a 13-year-old girl presented with haematemesis. The spleen was hugely enlarged. Her Hb was 8.38 g/dl. Grade III oesophageal varices were found in oesophagogastroduodenostomy.

The diagnosis of spontaneous splenic vein thrombosis should be considered in the presence of gastrointestinal bleeding with unexplained splenomegaly.

During one year of follow-up blood cell counts including erythrocytes, white blood cell, neutorophiles and platelets, the size of spleen on ultrasound were assessed. After a year we noticed marked, statistically significant decline in white blood cells, neutrophiles and platelets counts. The size of the spleen remained unchanged. We may conclude that repeated sclerotherapy of oesophageal varices does not contribute to the rise in blood pressure within the portal system while decrease in blood cells count might be attributed to deterioration of the liver function."

From that time, his platelet count gradually increased to more than 2 X 10(6)/microliter until 1979. However, his platelet count gradually decreased to less than 6 X 10(5)/microliter in 1985. Also, in 1982, erythroblasts and immature myeloid cells began to appear in the peripheral blood, and the liver and spleen became palpable in 1985. Bone marrow then revealed osteomyelosclerosis. These findings suggested that ET had transformed to myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia. Increased hepatosplenomegaly was accompanied by the appearance of ascites in June, 1988, and an esophageal varix ruptured in December of the same year. The varix was resected and the spleen was removed. After the operation, ascites did not recur and his condition became stable.

Here we report a case of a 40-year-old female patient with Crohn's disease and genetic hypercoagulability disorder-factor V Leiden, who in the course of azathioprine immunosuppressive treatment for inflammatory bowel disease developed NRH, which was clinically manifested by thrombocytopenia and delicate hepato-splenomegaly. Moreover, her endoscopic examination of upper gastrointestinal tract demonstrated esophageal varices. Genetic analysis revealed heterozygous genotype (*1/*3A) of thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT), a key enzyme of thiopurines' metabolism, which results in lower activity of TPMT enzyme, thereby making our patient more susceptible to azathioprine-related hepato and myelotoxicity development. Treatment was started with the immediate cessation of azathioprine therapy, and administration of propranolol as primary prophylaxis for bleeding from esophageal varices. Currently (3 years after diagnosis) remission of Crohn's disease is achieved, however, progression of features of portal hypertension is observed. Propranolol administration is continued and the patient is constantly monitored in our Department. Our Case Study highlights the clinical difficulties and challenges associated with diagnosing of azathioprine-induced NRH, as well as, supports previous observations that hypercoagulability disorders and abnormal TPMT activity may contribute to NRH development."

The diagnosis is important because it frequently results in development of gastric and duodenal varices. It is often assumed that the diagnosis should only be suspected in patients with splenomegaly. This report describes 19 patients in whom splenic vein thrombosis was diagnosed by angiography although clinically unsuspected. In 11, the spleen was normal in size although extensive gastric varices were present. In 3 patients the presenting problem was massive hematemesis. Review of the upper gastrointestinal examinations in these patients showed thickened gastric or duodenal folds although in the absence of esophageal varices, the diagnosis was not made prior to angiography. More liberal use of angiography in patients with an appropriate clinical background, such as a history of pancreatitis, may lead to earlier and more frequent diagnosis of splenic vein obstruction. Varices that result from splenic vein obstruction can be cured by splenectomy."

Most infants with short bowel syndrome eventually wean from parenteral nutrition, and most of those who do not wean tolerate parenteral nutrition for protracted periods. However, a subset of children with intestinal failure remaining dependent on parenteral nutrition will develop life-threatening complications arising from therapy. Intestinal transplantation (Tx) can now be recommended for this select group. Life-threatening complications warranting consideration of intestinal Tx include parenteral nutrition-associated liver disease, recurrent sepsis, and threatened loss of central venous access. Because a critical shortage of donor organs exists, waiting times for intestinal Tx are prolonged. Therefore, it is essential that children with life-threatening complications of intestinal failure and parenteral nutrition therapy be identified comparatively early, i.e. in time to receive suitable donor organs before they become critically ill. Children with liver dysfunction should be considered for isolated intestinal Tx before irreversible, advanced bridging fibrosis or cirrhosis supervenes, for which a combined liver and intestinal transplant is necessary. Irreversible liver disease is suggested by hyperbilirubinemia persisting beyond 3-4 months of age combined with features of portal hypertension such as splenomegaly, thrombocytopenia, or prominent superficial abdominal veins; esophageal varices, ascites, and impaired synthetic function are not always present. Death resulting from complications of liver failure is especially common during the wait for a combined liver and intestinal transplant, and survival following combined liver and intestinal Tx is probably lower than following an isolated intestinal transplant. The incidence of morbidity and mortality following intestinal Tx is greater than that following liver or kidney Tx, but long-term survival following intestinal Tx is now at least 50-60%. It is probable that outcomes shall improve in the future with continued refinements in operative technique and post-operative management, including immunosuppression."

CD008759,0,5548559,0,Stimulation of insulin secretion by medium-chain triglycerides in patients with cirrhosis.,"Oral medium-chain triglycerides were given to 10 normal volunteers, 12 cirrhotics (group I) without and 28 cirrhotics (group II) with abnormal portal systemic communications (ascites, splenomegaly, oesophageal varices, or surgically-created portacaval shunts). After 30 ml of medium-chain triglyceride oil there was no appreciable change in serum glucose levels in any of the three groups nor in serum insulin levels in the normals and in cirrhotics in group I. However, there was a significant increase in serum insulin levels in the cirrhotic patients in group II. It is suggested that the rise in serum insulin levels after medium-chain triglycerides noted in the cirrhotics with shunts is due to shunting of insulin-containing portal blood around the liver (anatomical shunts) and to a diminished hepatic cell mass capable of extracting insulin (functional shunt). This differential response of serum insulin levels to medium-chain triglycerides may prove to be of value in detecting the presence of abnormal portal systemic communications in cirrhotic patients."

CD008759,0,7252729,0,Hepatoportal sclerosis in childhood: a mimic of extrahepatic portal vein obstruction.,"In the absence of cirrhosis, most children with portal hypertension and bleeding esophageal varices have extrahepatic portal vein occlusion. In the past 2 yr this clinical picture has been mimicked by two children with hepatoportal sclerosis causing their variceal hemorrhage. Hepatoportal sclerosis has been well described in adults. It is manifested by splenomegaly, portal hypertension, and variable ascites and hepatomegaly. Liver histology is initially normal but subsequently shows periportal fibrosis without cirrhosis. Hepatic manometrics indicate a presinusoidal block, but angiography demonstrates a patient portal vein. Typically there is abrupt narrowing of the intrahepatic portal branches, giving a ""withered tree"" appearance. These findings are illustrated by two children who presented with esophageal variceal bleeding at 21 and 20 mo of age, respectively. They are the youngest reported cases of hepatoportal sclerosis. The etiology of hepatoportal sclerosis is uncertain, but the disease appears to be only slowly progressive. Control of variceal bleeding by central portosystemic shunts in this condition is associated with a 50% incidence of hepatic encephalopathy. Therefore alternate methods of therapy need be considered. Endoscopic injection sclerotherapy successfully controlled variceal bleeding in one child reported here. Hepatoportal sclerosis is a distinct entity and must be considered in the differential diagnosis of portal hypertension in infants and children."

CD008759,0,1843929,0,[Predictive value of ultrasonography in portal hypertension].,"Portal hypertension is a common pathology in childhood and one of its most common causes is cavernomatosis of the portal vein. This obstruction causes hemodynamic changes which lead to splenomegaly and collateral circulation. Esophageal varices are one of the most important sequelae, which endanger the patient's life because of a bleeding tendency. Ecosonography helps to detect the thickening of the lesser omentum vis a vis the aortic diameter, caused by the collateral circulation. We studied 15 children presenting with portal hypertension resulting from portal vein cavernomatosis; we performed an upper GI endoscopy and abdominal ecosonography. The endoscopy revealed grade II esophageal varices in 20% of cases, the remaining 80% had grade III and grade IV. Ecosonography revealed an increased lesser omentum/aorta ratio in children with portal hypertension, compared to controls (p < 0.001). Our results suggest that the lesser omentum/aorta ratio has diagnostic value in pediatric portal hypertension."
CD008759,0,23593929,0,New approaches to the autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease patient with dual kidney-liver complications.,"Improved neonatal medical care and renal replacement technology have improved the long-term survival of patients with ARPKD. Ten-yr survival of those surviving the first year of life is reported to be 82% and is continuing to improve further. However, despite increases in overall survival and improved treatment of systemic hypertension and other complications of their renal disease, nearly 50% of survivors will develop ESRD within the first decade of life. In addition to renal pathology, patients with ARPKD develop ductal plate malformations with cystic dilation of intra- and extrahepatic bile ducts resulting in CHF and Caroli syndrome. Many patients with CHF will develop portal hypertension with resulting esophageal varices, splenomegaly, hypersplenism, protein losing enteropathy, and gastrointestinal bleeding. Management of portal hypertension may require EBL of esophageal varices or porto-systemic shunting. Complications of hepatic involvement can include ascending cholangitis, cholestasis with malabsorption of fat-soluble vitamins, and rarely benign or malignant liver tumors. Patients with ARPKD who eventually reach ESRD, and ultimately require kidney transplantation, present a unique set of complications related to their underlying hepato-biliary disease. In this review, we focus on new approaches to these challenging patients, including the indications for liver transplantation in ARPKD patients with severe chronic kidney disease awaiting kidney transplant. While survival in patients with ARPKD and isolated kidney transplant is comparable to that of age-matched pediatric patients who have received kidney transplants due to other primary renal diseases, 64-80% of the mortality occurring in ARPKD kidney transplant patients is attributed to cholangitis/sepsis, which is related to their hepato-biliary disease. Recent data demonstrate that surgical mortality among pediatric liver transplant recipients is decreased to <10% at one yr. The immunosuppressive regimen used for kidney transplant recipients is adequate for most liver transplant recipients. We therefore suggest that in a select group of ARPKD patients with recurrent cholangitis or complications of portal hypertension, combined liver-kidney transplant is a viable option. Although further study is necessary to confirm our approach, we believe that combined liver-kidney transplantation can potentially decrease overall mortality and morbidity in carefully selected ARPKD patients with ESRD and clinically significant CHF."
CD008759,0,17216996,0,A prospective study: prediction of the first variceal haemorrhage in schistosomal and non schistosomal liver disease.,"A prospective study was conducted on liver disease patients without previous history of bleeding (haematemesis and/or melena) to identify those at highest risk of bleeding. A hundred and twenty non-alcoholic patients (96 males and 24 females), ages ranging from 30 to 60 years were studied. Patients were followed for up to two years or to time of bleeding (mean 18 +/- 7.3 months), during which 34 (28.3%) patients bled. Schistosomal patients showed less incidence of bleeding (12.1%, p < 0.05) than those with mixed aetiology (Schistosoma and cirrhosis 23.5%, and chronic active hepatitis and schistosoma 44.4%). The presence of positive viral markers (either HCV antibodies or HBsAg) was associated with a higher percent of bleeding during the follow-up period (43.2% and 45.4%, respectively), than those negative for these markers (21.7%, 24.4%, respectively). Univariate analysis showed the following significant risk factors associated with bleeding: modified child classification, reduced platelet count, endoscopic findings of cherry red spots, gastric varices and increased grade of oesophageal varices. Multivariate analysis revealed that the risk of bleeding was significantly related to the presence of cherry red spots, the presence of gastric varices, grade of oesophageal varices and the patient's prothrombin time. In conclusion, bleeding from oesophageal varices is a frequent and serious event in patients with chronic liver disease. The risk of variceal bleeding from liver disease with mixed aetiology (schistosomiasis associated with viral hepatitis HBV or HCV) was found to be significantly higher than that with schistosomal aetiology alone. The endoscopic findings of cherry red spots, gastric varices, increased grade of oesophageal varices and to a lesser extent the prothrombin time were found to be high risk factors. Patients having those risk factors should be considered for prophylactic measures."

Hematological data showed liver dysfunction and antinuclear antibody was positive. In February 2002, the patient was admitted to our hospital to investigate these abnormalities of liver function further. The features of arthritis, thrombocytopenia with elevated platelet-associated IgG, positive antinuclear antibody, and anti-DNA antibody lead to a diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus. Liver biopsy revealed infiltration of Glisson's capsule by plasma cells, compatible with autoimmune hepatitis. We performed hepatic venography to investigate severe pancytopenia, remarkable splenomegaly and esophageal varices. Wedged hepatic venous pressure was mildly elevated, and hepatic veins displayed sharp angles, smooth walls and development of anastomosis with each other. These findings suggested idiopathic portal hypertension. Cytopenia and liver dysfunction gradually improved on treatment with 40 mg/day prednisolone. Esophageal varices were disappeared, and splenomegaly had improved after 6 months. As autoimmune factors are considered to underlie the development of idiopathic portal hypertension with systemic lupus erythematosus, steroid administration represents a therapeutic option in this condition."

The indications for surgical intervention include gastrointestinal haemorrhage due to rupture of esophageal varices, a very bulky enlarged spleen and, more, rarely, recurrent ascites. Simple splenectomy (9 cases) suppresses discomfort and pain, corrects the hypersplenism and brings about a moderate reduction of portal pressure. Spleno-renal anastomosis (19 cases) remains the operation of choice. The long-term results, difficult as these are to assess under ill-regulated African conditions, appear satisfactory on the whole, due to less serious damage to the hepatocyte than in the cirrhoses (62% Child A and 29% Child B). We therefore continue to advocate splenectomy followed if possible by a spleno-renal shunt in bilharzial portal hypertension."

In all patients, esophageal varices were completely disappeared after EIS. To investigate risk factors for recurrence of esophageal varices after EIS, hemodynamic changes in the portal system before and after EIS were studied by portal vein catheterization and ultrasonography. In patients in whom portal pressure rose after EIS, recurrence of varices was observed in high incidence (p < 0.05). Furthermore, variceal recurrence appeared frequently in patients with progressive splenomegaly after EIS (p < 0.05). During post-EIS course, new appearance or increase in size of non-variceal portosystemic collaterals was detected by ultrasonography in 22% of the patients. In these patients, variceal recurrence rate was low (p = 0.09). In patients with shunts around the splenic hilum, variceal recurrence rate was lower compared with the patients with paraumbilical vein (p < 0.05). Prognostic factors for variceal recurrence were analysed using multiple regression model. It was suggested that the absence of non-variceal portosystemic collaterals was the most risky factor. In conclusion, observation of portal hemodynamics is considered to be useful for the long-term management of patients with esophageal varices treated with EIS."
CD008759,0,1866503,0,[Idiopathic portal hypertension].,"Patients with portal hypertension without a demonstrable cause have been reported in the literature under several different terms, such as tropical splenomegaly, phlebosclerosis, obliterative portal venopathy of the liver, hepatoportal sclerosis, noncirrhotic portal fibrosis and idiopathic portal hypertension (IPH). Such patients have been described worldwide, with a greater frequency in India and Japan. The etiology of IPH is still unknown, although some of the theories that have been proposed are: exposure to toxic substances or drugs, relationship with the hepatitis-B virus, immunologic abnormalities, systemic or intra-abdominal infections and clotting abnormalities. The main histopathologic findings are periportal fibrosis, obliteration of small portal veins and sclerosis of the interhepatic portal system. Although these abnormalities could be secondary to portal hypertension, it has been proposed that the vascular changes are the primary event that leads to portal hypertension. The site of increased resistance in IPH is found at the presinusoidal level with some component at the sinusoidal and postsinusoidal level. The main symptoms and signs in IPH are upper gastrointestinal tract bleeding secondary to esophago-gastric varices, symptoms related to anemia, and splenomegaly. The long-term prognosis for patients with IPH is better than for cirrhotic patients, with a 77% survival at ten years. Variceal bleeding is the main cause of death, and some treatment to prevent bleeding or its recurrence is warranted. Although no comparative trial has been performed in IPH patients, the surgical management could be the first choice for elective treatment in these patient without liver failure, because of the high re-bleeding rates with chronic sclerotherapy. Pharmacologic management could be considered for prophylactic treatment of these patients."

CD008759,0,26091449,0,The Role of Spleen Stiffness in Determining the Severity and Bleeding Risk of Esophageal Varices in Cirrhotic Patients.,"Esophageal varix and its hemorrhage are serious complications of liver cirrhosis. Recent studies have focused on noninvasive prediction of esophageal varices. We attempted to evaluate the association of liver and spleen stiffness (LS and SS) as measured by acoustic radiation force impulse imaging, with the presence and severity of esophageal varices and variceal hemorrhage in cirrhotic patients. We measured LS and SS, along with endoscopic examination of esophageal varices for a total of 125 cirrhotic patients at a single referral hospital in this prospective observational study. The diagnostic utility of noninvasive methods for identifying varices and their bleeding risk was compared, including LS, SS, spleen length, Child-Pugh score, and various serum fibrosis indices. Esophageal varices were present in 77 patients (61.6%). SS was significantly higher in patients with varices than in those without varices (3.58 ± 0.47 vs 3.02 ± 0.49; P < 0.001). A tendency toward increasing SS levels was observed with increasing severity of varices (no varix, 3.02 ± 0.49; F1, 3.39 ± 0.51; F2, 3.60 ± 0.42; F3, 3.85 ± 0.37; P < 0.001). SS was significantly higher in patients who experienced variceal hemorrhage than in those who did not (3.80 ± 0.36 vs 3.20 ± 0.51; P = 0.002). An optimal cut-off value of SS for high-risk varices (≥ F2) or variceal hemorrhage was 3.40 m/s. SS was significantly correlated with the presence, severity, and bleeding risk of esophageal varices. Prompt endoscopic evaluation of variceal status and prophylactic measures based on the SS may be warranted for cirrhotic patients."

CD008759,0,8114315,0,[Etiology and management of esophageal varices].,"The most common etiogenic disease of portal hypertension that we experience is liver cirrhosis, which accounts for 84% of all cases. In patients with portal hypertension, congestion by portal blood due to cirrhosis causes a rise in portal pressure and development of collateral circulation between the portal system and the postcaval system is observed. Esophageal varices are associated with higher mortality than any other symptom of portal hypertension and are an important consideration in treatment. When emergency endoscopic examination and diagnosis show esophageal variceal bleeding, the varices must be constricted directly using a Sengstaken-Brakemor tube. If hemostasis is maintained, medical and surgical procedures can be performed after the recovery of body strength. Endoscopic Injection Sclerotherapy (EIS) has recently been widely carried out to prevent variceal bleeding and its application is increasing. However, treatment with EIS alone is not sufficient in terms of long-term efficacy, and surgical treatment is effective, especially in patients with gastric varices or splenomegaly. For Child A and B groups, both with good liver function, non-shunting operation, especially, the SUGIURA procedure, shows a marked effectiveness on varices. For group Child C, EIS is selected. The newly-developed Transjuglar Intrahepatic Portasystemic Shunt (TIPS), is being used, recently. For hepatic insufficiency, liver transplantation is expected to be one of the method for future treatment. Cirrhosis is also commonly accompanied by hepatoma, and this must be taken into consideration in treatment."

This prospective study included 100 cirrhotic patients without previous variceal hemorrhage or endoscopic intervesion. Biochemical, imaging and endoscopic findings were collected in all patients. Several parameters including P/D and P/A ratio were measured and their association with the presence of EV and HREV was tested. The results showed that only P/D and P/A ratios were found to be independent predictors for the presence of EV and HREV in multivariant analysis.

Her spleen was markedly enlarged, and the histologic findings of her liver were not consistent with hepatic cirrhosis, but with idiopathic portal hypertension. A venous hum was audible in the upper abdomen. Superior mesenteric angiography revealed a porto-systemic shunt vessel under the abdominal wall, originating from the umbilical vein. She was injected four times with a sclerosant, and this brought about disappearance of the esophageal varices. Two years after the first admission, the venous hum was no longer audible, but there was a recurrence of the esophageal varices.

However, more data and studies may be necessary for further evaluation."
CD008759,0,348448,0,Comparative clinicopathological and bacteriological studies in schistosomiasis mansoni.,"FIFTY MALE Egyptian inpatients with active colonic mansoniasis were studied clinicopathologically, endoscopically, radiologically and bacteriologically. This was done to find out the pattern of colonic and urinary enterobacteria and serum antisalmonella agglutinins in various stages of mansoniasis. Cases are divided into three groups (A, B and C) according to the stage of their hepato-splenomegally. Their clinical presentations were dysentery, rectal bleeding, abdominal distension, anaemia, endocrinal changes and general weakness. Oesophageal varices were diagnosed in 19.8% of group C patients. Distal colonic polyps were noticed in 25% and 4% of group A and B cases respectively, while colonic ulcers were found in 20% of patients of either group. The total number of bilharzia ova per gram of fresh colonic biopsy was highest in group A and lowest in group C subjects. Mucosal and submucosal bilharzial granulation tissue formation together with mucosal hypertrophy were conspicuous among group A and B patients. Hematoxylin and eosin stain was of good diagnostic value and the rest of the stains used did not show any fungi or fibrinoid deposits."
CD008759,0,15479399,0,Human immunodeficiency and hepatitis virus infections and their associated conditions and treatments among people with haemophilia.,"Treatment with contaminated plasma products before 1990 resulted in extraordinary prevalence rates of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis B and C viruses (HBV, HCV). In the Second Multicentre Haemophilia Cohort Study (MHCS-II) during 2001-03, 30% of HCV-seropositive survivors had HIV and 4.6% were HBV carriers. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) radically altered the consequences of HIV/HCV coinfection. Whereas opportunistic infections predominated previously, current major complications are liver failure and bleeding (exacerbated by decreased clotting factor synthesis, hypersplenic thrombocytopenia, and oesophageal varices). Most HIV-positives in MHCS-II were HIV RNA-negative and had > 200 CD4(+) cells microL(-1), but only 59% were on HAART. With HIV, especially after 41 years of age, liver disease was apparent (jaundice in 5%, ascites 7%, hepatomegaly 9%, splenomegaly 19%). HAART increases survival but may contribute to various comorbidities. Without HIV, sustained HCV clearance is obtained in > 50% with combined pegylated interferons plus ribavirin, but data in haemophilic populations, especially with HIV, are limited. In MHCS-II, HCV RNA negativity was 41% following standard interferon plus ribavirin; among interferon-naive participants (implying spontaneous HCV clearance), HCV RNA negativity was 12% with and 25% without HIV. Without HIV, spontaneous HCV clearance was much more likely with early age at infection and particularly with recent birth (late 1970s or early 1980s) but not with bleeding propensity or its treatment. Most (72%) participants had received no anti-HCV therapy. Hepatic and haematological conditions are likely to increase during the coming years unless most adult haemophiliacs are successfully treated for HIV, HCV or both."
CD008759,0,16534680,0,Improved prognosis of cirrhosis patients with esophageal varices and thrombocytopenia treated by endoscopic variceal ligation plus partial splenic embolization.,"The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of the combination of endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL) and partial splenic embolization (PSE) compared with EVL alone in cirrhosis patients with thrombocytopenia. In a prospective study, 84 cirrhosis patients with esophageal varices and thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 50,000/mm(3)) underwent EVL plus PSE (N = 42) or EVL alone (N = 42). Primary end points assessed during the follow-up period included the recurrence of varices, progression to variceal bleeding, and death. Comparison between combined treatment and variceal ligation alone by multivariate analysis showed a hazard ratio of 0.44 for the recurrence of varices (P = 0.02), 0.19 for progression to variceal bleeding (P = 0.01), and 0.31 for death (P = 0.04). These results suggest that the combination of EVL plus PSE can prevent the recurrence of varices, progression to variceal bleeding, and death in cirrhosis patients with esophageal varices and thrombocytopenia."

Robotic surgery for hepatic resection has not yet been extensively reported. The aim of this paper is to report the first known case of liver resection with use of a computer-assisted, or robotic, surgical device in Latin America. A 72-year-old male with cryptogenic liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma was referred for surgical treatment. Preoperative clinical evaluation and laboratory data disclosed a Child-Pugh class A patient. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a 2.2 cm tumor in segment 5. Liver size was decreased and there were signs of portal hypertension, such as splenomegaly and enlarged portal vein collaterals. Preoperative upper digestive endoscopy disclosed esophageal varices. Five trocars were used. Liver transection was achieved with harmonic scalpel and bipolar forceps. Hemostasis of raw surface areas was accomplished with interrupted stitches. Operative time was 120 minutes. Blood loss was minimal and the patient did not receive transfusion. The recovery was uneventful and patient was discharged on the 3rd postoperative day without ascites formation. Laparoscopic hepatic resection can safely be performed. The laparoscopic approach may enable liver resection in patients with cirrhosis and evidence of liver failure that would contraindicate open surgery probably because it precludes the transection of major abdominal collaterals. The Da Vinci robotic system allowed for technical refinements of laparoscopic liver resection due to 3-dimensional visualization of the operative field and instruments with wrist-type end-effectors."
CD008759,0,19065558,1,Insulin resistance is a risk factor for esophageal varices in hepatitis C virus cirrhosis.,"Indirect methods to predict the presence of esophageal varices (EV) in patients with cirrhosis are not sensitive enough to be used as a surrogate for endoscopy. We tested the effectiveness of liver stiffness measurement (LSM) by transient elastography and the presence of insulin resistance (IR), a marker associated with fibrosis progression, in the noninvasive prediction of portal hypertension. One hundred four consecutive patients with newly diagnosed Child A hepatitis C virus (HCV) cirrhosis underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy to search for EV. Clinical, anthropometric, biochemical, ultrasonographic, and metabolic features, including IR by the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA), and LSM by transient elastography, were recorded at the time of endoscopy. EVs were detected in 63 of 104 patients (60%). In 10 patients (16%), the EVs were medium-large (>or=F2). By multivariate analysis, the presence of EVs was independently associated with a low platelet count/spleen diameter ratio (OR, 0.998; 95% CI, 0.996-0.999) and a high HOMA-IR score (OR, 1.296; 95%CI, 1.018-1.649), not with LSM (OR, 1.009; 95%CI, 0.951-1.070). It is noteworthy that nine of ten patients with medium-large EVs had a platelet/spleen ratio of less than 792 or an HOMA-IR of greater than 3.5. The independent association between low platelet count/spleen diameter ratio (OR, 0.998; 95%CI, 0.996-1.000), high HOMA-IR score (OR, 1.373; 95%CI, 1.014-1.859) and presence of EV was confirmed in the subgroup of 77 nondiabetic subjects."

CD008759,0,7780239,0,Idiopathic portal hypertension in renal transplant recipients: report of two cases.,"We present herein the cases of two patients who developed idiopathic portal hypertension (IPH) following renal transplantation. Both patients had been treated with azathioprine and prednisolone for 6 years and 4 months and for 4 years and 7 months, respectively, and presented with splenomegaly and thrombocytopenia suggesting hypersplenism. Celiac angiography showed a dilated splenic artery and vein in both patients. When the splenic artery was obliterated with a balloon catheter in case 1, the portal venous pressure decreased from 51 cmH2O to 36 cmH2O, and the direction of the superiomesenteric venous blood flow became hepatopetal rather than hepatofugal. These results suggested that the spleen might have played an important role in the development of IPH in these two patients. A splenectomy was therefore performed, immediately following which the portal venous pressure decreased remarkably, and the esophageal varices disappeared during the postoperative follow-up period. Microscopic examination of liver biopsies taken at the operation revealed lymphoplasmacytic infiltration with bile duct hyperplasia but no evidence of periportal fibrosis, and electron microscopy demonstrated very mild perisinusoidal fibrosis. Thus, the histological changes seen in the livers of these patients seemed not to have caused the portal hypertension. In conclusion, although few patients develop IPH after renal transplantation, we should be aware of its possibility and consider splenectomy as the treatment of choice."
CD008759,0,8248041,0,[Hemophagocytic syndrome in HIV infection].,"This report describes the clinical spectrum and outcome of the hemophagocytic syndrome (HS) in 5 HIV infected patients. All 5 patients presented with fever, hepatomegaly and/or splenomegaly, confusion or coma and respiratory symptoms. Severe anemia was associated with thrombocytopenia and with neutropenia in 4 cases. Diffuse intravascular coagulopathy was present in 2 cases. Liver function tests were abnormal in three patients. The diagnosis of HS was made 2 to 12 weeks after the onset of symptoms and required in most patients repeated examinations of the bone-marrow, showing infiltration by histiocytes with prominent phagocytosis of blood cells. In one case this infiltration was not seen in the bone-marrow but only in the liver and the spleen. Varicella, mycobacterium infection, oesophageal candidiasis, Kaposi sarcoma were observed in the evolution of 3 patients. Anaplastic large cell Ki-1 lymphoma was present in one case. Four patients died as a result of complications of HS. The one patient with lymphoma survived."
CD008759,0,2668556,0,Ultrasonographic diagnosis of portal vein cavernous transformation in children.,"The aim of this work was to evaluate the efficiency, sensitivity, and specificity of ultrasonographic findings in the diagnosis of portal vein cavernous transformation and secondary splanchnic hypertension in children. Twenty patients with esophageal varices on endoscopic sclerotherapy, with ages ranging from 1 to 15 years (mean of 7.5), were compared with 20 age-matched normal asymptomatic controls. In 17 cases, diagnosis was confirmed by splenoportography. Ultrasonographic portal vein features, respiratory variations in splenic and superior mesenteric veins, lesser omentum to aorta diameter ratio and spleen size, as well as the presence of vessels in the lesser omentum and of spontaneous anastomoses, were analyzed in both groups. The efficiency of ultrasonography to establish a diagnosis of portal vein cavernous transformation reached 100%. Splenic and superior mesenteric vein respiratory variation was negligible in patients and inspiration versus expiration diameter differences ranged from 1 to 4 mm (mean of 2.4) in controls (p less than .001). Mean lesser omentum to aorta ratio was 2.07 in patients versus .9 in controls (p less than .001). Splenomegaly was found in all but two cases; lesser omentum vessels were visualized in nine cases; whereas five presented spontaneous splenorenal anastomoses and gallbladder varices were observed in five patients. Thus, ultrasonography allowed portal vein cavernous transformation to be diagnosed throughout; portal hypertension was also detected. It may be concluded that ultrasonography, either alone or associated with endoscopy, provides a reliable method for portal vein cavernous transformation diagnosis. Angiography should be reserved for preoperative or controlled hemodynamic studies."
CD008759,0,24509356,0,[Transient elastography as a predictor of oesophageal varices in patients with liver cirrhosis].,"One of the most serious complications of liver cirrhosis is variceal bleeding. Early recognition of the oesophageal varices is of primary importance in the prevention of variceal bleeding. Endoscopy is the only means to directly visualize varices and measure their size, as one of the most important predictor of the risk of bleeding. During the course of cirrhosis repeated oesophago-gastro-bulboscopic examinations are recommended. As these interventions are expensive and often poorly accepted by patients who may refuse further follow-up, there is a need for non-invasive methods to predict the progression of portal hypertension as well as the presence and the size of oesophageal varices. After several combinations of biological and ultrasonographical parameters proposed for the detection of advanced fibrosis, it was suggested that liver stiffness measured by transient elastography, a novel non-invasive technology may reflect not only fibrosis and portal pressure but it may even predict the presence or absence of large oesophageal varices in patients with cirrhosis."
CD008759,0,8676434,0,Abnormal gastric emptying in patients with liver cirrhosis.,"Twenty-eight patients (aged: 44-76 years) with liver cirrhosis secondary to chronic hepatitis were included in this study. None of the patients had a history of gastric surgery, diabetes, hypothyroidism, or neurological or collagen vascular disease. The patients were divided into groups based on the presence or absence of the following conditions: (1) ascites, (2) splenomegaly, (3) esophageal varices. Radionuclide labelled solid meals were used to evaluate gastric emptying (GE). GE was represented by the gastric retention ratio of the solid meal at 90 min (RR90), and calculated by the following formula: RR90 = residual radioactivity within the region of interest (ROI) covered the whole stomach at 90 min divided by the initial radioactivity within the ROI at 0 min. The RR90 values of the patients were compared with the RR90 values of 25 normal control volunteers. If the RR90 was more than two standard deviations (SD) above the mean of the control group (> 0.687), GE was defined as abnormal. The results showed 71% (20/ 28) of the cirrhotic patients had abnormal GE. Patients with ascites, splenomegaly, or esophageal varices had higher RR90 values than patients without ascites, splenomegaly or esophageal varices. The differences in RR90 among patients with and without ascites, and patients with and without splenomegaly, were not significant (P values > 0.05). However, there were significant differences among the 2 patient groups separated according to the presence or absence of esophageal varices (P values < 0.05). In addition, poor correlations (R square values < 0.01) were found for RR90 and serum values of bilirubin and albumin."

A case of pancreatic endocrine tumor presenting with gastric variceal hemorrhage secondary to left-sided portal hypertension associated with splenic vein occlusion is presented. A 53-year-old man with hemorrhage from isolated gastric varices was referred to our hospital. Laboratory studies revealed normal liver function. Surveys to identify the cause of gastric varices by an abdominal CT, MRCP, and abdominal angiography revealed splenic vein occlusion secondarily attributed to the pancreatic tail tumor and splenomegaly. The pancreatic tumor was suspected to be a resectable endocrine tumor. A distal pancreatectomy, splenectomy, partial resection of the gastric fundus, and limited lymph node dissection were performed. By the histological examination, the diagnosis of nonfunctioning pancreatic endocrine tumor with malignant potential was determined. Three years after the surgery, the patient is doing well and reveals no sign of recurrence. In this case, the unusual presentation for pancreatic endocrine tumors such as a gastric variceal hemorrhage had an advantage that led to early presentation prior to the development of metastases with possible curative surgery."

The patient had a history of poor compliance with her prescribed cysteamine therapy. Routine examination revealed normal liver function without hepatomegaly but asymptomatic splenomegaly. An abdominal ultrasound suggested mild oesophageal varices, confirmed later on endoscopy. A liver biopsy revealed an abundance of cystine crystals within the hepatic Kupffer cells, with preserved hepatic architecture. Although the pathophysiology of this rare complication is unclear, in the absence of other aetiologies the likely cause is the patient's poorly controlled cystinosis. As cystinotic patients live longer with improved renal transplant management and cysteamine therapy, it is of interest to characterize the long-term course of the illness after renal transplantation. An understanding of the pathophysiology of hepatic dysfunction will be required to manage this potential late complication of the disease."

CD008759,0,26159268,0,Clinical Evaluation and Prognosis.,"Liver cirrhosis is no longer considered a homogeneous disease, with two different phases now identified: 'compensated' and 'decompensated' cirrhosis, in which complications of cirrhosis characterize the latter. Within each phase, different stages and predictors should be recognized in order to correctly stratify the prognosis and individualize possible therapeutic options. Key Messages: In compensated cirrhosis the presence of clinically significant portal hypertension [CSPH = hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) ≥10 mm Hg] constitutes the most important independent predictor of several relevant clinical endpoints (formation of esophageal varices; first clinical decompensation). An optimal HVPG response to medical therapy of portal hypertension (HVPG reduction <12 mm Hg or ≥20% vs. the pretreatment value, responders) has been consistently linked to a decrease in the risk of variceal bleeding both in primary and secondary prophylaxis, and to a decrease in the risk of presenting other clinical decompensating events. Furthermore, in patients undergoing secondary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding, being an HVPG responder is associated with an improved survival. HVPG also maintains an independent prognostic value in patients with decompensated cirrhosis. Noninvasive alternatives to HVPG for the prediction of CSPH have been investigated; liver stiffness by transient elastography and the combination of liver stiffness, spleen size by ultrasound and platelet count are currently the best methods to noninvasively diagnose CSPH, with an accuracy of about 90%. Additional factors modulate prognosis in cirrhosis. Liver function (albumin, bilirubin, INR) is independently associated with prognosis both in compensated and decompensated cirrhosis, and in the latter phase renal function also plays a central role. Among clinical cofactors, obesity and diabetes are emerging as variables increasing the risk of progression to decompensation and death in cirrhosis."

CD008759,0,22046771,0,[Liver cirrhosis--procoagulant stasis].,"Abnormal hemostasis tests and bleeding are often associated in liver cirrhosis. In these patients the balance between hypo- and hypercoagulation status is more fragile than in healthy people. In the hemostatic abnormalities associated with chronic liver disease are two main chategory factors: favoring hemorrage and favoring thrombosis. The main factors that favoring hemorrage are: low platelet count, impaired platelet function, decreased levels coagulation factors (II, V, VII, IX, X, XI), quantitative and qualitative abnormalities of fibrinogen, vitamin K defiency, low levels of trombin activable fibrinolisis inhibitor, activat plasminogenic tisular. The factors favoring thrombosis are elevated levels of factors VIII and von Willebrand, decreased levels of protein C, protein S, antithrombin, decreased levels of plasminogen. Traditionally it was thought that arterial and venous thrombosis is rare events in cirrhotic patients but recent studies have indicated that thrombotic complications can paradoxically occur even if clinically an increased risk of hemorrhage is considered. Treatment of venous thrombosis in patients with cirrhosis using routine anticoagulation with heparin and vitamin K antagonists has been described but with a high level of bleeding complications. So, based on the limited data available, AASLD guidelines stated no recommendations for or against the use of anticoagulation in cirrhotic patients with portal thrombosis. Although abnormal hemostasis tests and bleeding are often associated in patients with chronic liver disease it is a relatively poor correlation between hemorrhagic risk and routine diagnostic tests of hemostasis. Management of bleeding complications in liver cirrhosis varies and no general guidelines are available. The main therapeutic strategies are: red cell concentrate, plasma, platelet concentrate, recombinant factor VIIa, factor concentrates, desmopressin, antifibrynolitic agents, thrombopoietin receptor agonists, antibiotics. Clinical studies examining safety and efficacy of the various products for the different bleedeing or trombotic complications of liver cirrhosis need to be initiaded."

Clinical signs were splenomegaly, leucothrombocytopenia, and esophageal varices of fourth degree. The histology of the liver biopsy showed portal fibrosis with no evidence of cirrhosis. No causing agent or known disease could be found for the histopathological and clinical features. Due to a severe deterioration of general condition and a decline of synthetic liver function, liver transplantation and splenectomy were performed. The histological examination of the explanted liver revealed features of IPH, demonstrating portal fibrosis and dilated vessels adjacent to portal tracts; no cirrhosis was found. The postoperative recovery was without any severe complications. The duration of hospitalization was 28 days. Following liver transplantation, the esophageal varices disappeared and leucocytes, platelets as well as parameters of hepatic synthesis reached normal values. Initially, the immunosuppression was composed of prednisolon, tacrolimus, and antibodies against IL-2 receptors (BT 563) and was later continued with prednisolon and tacrolimus. Within the follow-up observation of 26 months, there was no evidence for graft rejection, severe infection, or occurrence of portal hypertension. Up till now the patient is in good condition with normal graft function. Liver transplantation may be a curative therapy for patients with advanced disease of IPH but the long-term follow-up after transplantation has to show whether IPH can reoccur."

CD008759,0,23820400,0,Management of portal hypertension in children with portal vein thrombosis.,"Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is a common cause of portal hypertension in children. Predisposing conditions for PVT are obscure in more than half of the cases. Variceal bleeding and splenomegaly are the most frequent initial manifestations. Radiologic imaging studies are the mainstay for diagnosis. Treatment includes pharmacologic, endoscopic, and surgical modalities. β-Adrenergic blockers are not routinely used in children because of unproven efficacy and significant adverse effects. Endoscopic methods, such as sclerotherapy and endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL), are highly effective in the treatment of acute variceal bleeding and eradication of varices. EVL is the treatment of choice because of minimal complications and the need for few endoscopic sessions. EVL facilitates portal decompression either by the formation of collateral vessels or by surgical portosystemic shunting, when vessels grow to the proper diameter for anastomosis. Surgical portosystemic shunts are reserved for refractory cases because of significant complications and technical difficulties.

There were 40 patients with spleen injuries, sustained mainly in road traffic accidents (26 or 65%), various accidents in the workplace, at home, knife stabs etc. (14 or 35%). The majority of those injured in road traffic accidents were polytraumatized (77%). Splenectomy was done in 36 patients. Successful splenic salvage was accomplished in 2 cases by the patch procedure. Two children with spleen injuries were treated conservatively, with careful follow-up of laboratory findings, clinical course, scintigraphy and ultrasound findings. Among other diseases splenectomy was done in hypersplenism (3), in spontaneous rupture because of splenomegaly, metastatic carcinoma and hydatid cyst (1 patient respectively). Together with other surgical procedures splenectomy was done in total gastrectomy because of carcinoma (3), in left hemicolectomy also because of carcinoma (2), in haemorrhagic oesophageal varices surgery (1) and in lesion caused by an instrument (1). Because of questionable results, no autologous transplantation was done. There were no cases of postsplenectomy infection."

Significant improvements in outcomes have been achieved with oxaliplatin-based combinations in these settings when compared with administration of 5-fluorouracil alone. Pathologic evaluation of normal liver from patients undergoing neoadjuvant oxaliplatin treatment has identified histologic evidence of sinusoidal injury, although the effect of this finding on patient outcomes after hepatic resection appears to be minimal. This article describes the use of oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy in 6 patients with stage III or IV CRC who developed evidence of noncirrhotic portal hypertension. These patients developed complications of portal hypertension including esophageal or hemorrhoidal varices with bleeding, splenomegaly with associated thrombocytopenia, and ascites. In each case, oxaliplatin-induced hepatic sinusoidal injury was identified as the most likely factor contributing to the development of noncirrhotic portal hypertension.

She had a haemoglobin concentration of 56 g.l-1, 20% prothrombin, 228 s activated cephalin time for a control time of 60 s, 0.9 g.l-1 of fibrinogen and a platelet count of 53 G.l-1. Because of the poor condition of her peripheral veins, it was decided to insert a central venous catheter. The axillary vein was chosen because of the coagulopathy. The axillary artery was accidentally punctured during the second attempt. Despite manual compression for 15 min, a small haematoma arose. The catheter was inserted in the right internal jugular vein. At the same time, a very large oedema of the left arm was noticed. The axillary haematoma had spread to the breast and lumbar fossa. The humeral and radial pulse amplitudes were decreased, and the patient complained of paraesthesiae. At phlebography, a vast haematoma was seen to compress the axillary vein. The patient's condition rapidly worsened, and she died 19 hours after admission with a probable cerebral haemorrhage. Although complications of axillary venous catheterization are rare, this case demonstrates that, in patient with very abnormal coagulation tests, central venous access should be obtained via a peripheral vein."

The aim of this study is to establish indicators of variceal bleeding. We studied 40 patients with compensated hepatosplenic schistosomiasis and varices, analyzing four endoscopic (variceal size, red color signs, fundic varices, and congestive gastropathy), nine ultrasonographic (right and left hepatic lobe size, periportal and gallbladder wall thickness, portal and splenic veins diameter, spleen longitudinal axis and volume, and presence of collateral circulation), and five US-Doppler parameters (portal and splenic veins velocity and flow and portal vein congestion index). Patients were divided in two groups according to previous history of variceal bleeding. The group with bleeding episodes was again divided in two groups: with and without treatment, namely endoscopic sclerotherapy. All endoscopic parameters and two ultrasonographic (periportal thickness and portal vein diameter) were statistically different between the groups with and without previous bleeding. The likelihood index, adopted to determine the best parameters related to previous bleeding showed that the most important combinations are: gastropathy and red signs followed by portal vein diameter and variceal size. In conclusion, although aware of the limits of the statistical analysis due to the small number of patients, our results demonstrated that endoscopic and US parameters (isolated or combined) can identify patients with a high risk of variceal bleeding, allowing physicians to optimize prophylactic therapy."

These findings were seen by chance when an abdominal ultrasound was performed in order to clarify splenomegaly or esophageal varices. The characteristics of the disease are the positive proof of a convoluted agglomeration of racemose venous structures that have replaced the normal single portal vein and signs of portal hypertension. The sonographic figures are so typical that ultrasound is the decisive procedure in its diagnosis and that direct or indirect splenoportography is not necessary. The present results show that clinical manifestations of cavernomatous transformation of the portal vein are delayed sometimes in to adolescence and that invasive diagnostic methods are only necessary when shunt operation is planned."

CD008759,0,11991599,0,Clinical predictors of large esophagogastric varices in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignancies worldwide, especially in Asia. Gastrointestinal bleeding due to esophagogastric variceal hemorrhage is one of the leading causes of death in HCC patients. The aim of study was to determine whether clinical variables were predictive of the presence of large esophagogastric varices (EGV) before performing endoscopy. Three hundred and four HCC patients who received endoscopy were enrolled and studied retrospectively. Univariate and stepwise logistic regression analysis were used to evaluate associations between the presence of large EGV and patient characteristics. There were 248 patients with small or no EGV and 56 patients with large EGV. The optimal critical values determined by a receiver operating characteristic curve for platelet count and albumin level were 135,000/mm3 and 3.5 g/dl, respectively. Stepwise logistic regression analysis demonstrated that splenomegaly [odds ratio (OR): 9.72; confidence interval (CI): 3.75-25.17], portal vein thrombosis (OR: 2.73; CI: 1.50-4.97), low platelet count (<135,000/mm3) (OR: 3.78; CI: 2.07-6.90) and low albumin level (<3.5 g/dl) (OR: 3.44; CI: 1.73-6.82) were significant, independent predictors for large EGV. Large EGV also could be independently predicted by Child-Pugh classification, splenomegaly (OR: 4.93; CI: 1.87-13.01), or portal vein thrombosis (OR: 2.37; CI: 1.28-4.39) while excluding the non-cirrhotic patients. In conclusion, splenomegaly, low platelet count (<135,000/mm3), and low albumin level (<3.5 g/dl) are clinical predictors to stratify HCC patients at risk of developing large EGV. Besides factors related to liver cirrhosis, portal vein thrombosis is also an important predictor for HCC patients with large EGV."

In a review of the English literature, 209 patients with isolated splenic vein obstruction were found. Pancreatitis caused 65% of the cases and pancreatic neoplasms 18%, whereas the rest was caused by various other diseases. Seventy-two per cent of the patients bled from gastroesophageal varices, and most often the bleeding came from isolated gastric varices. The spleen was enlarged in 71% of the patients. A correct diagnosis in connection with the first episode of bleeding was made in only 49%; 22% were operated on because of gastrointestinal bleeding, but the cause of bleeding was not found. The diagnosis should be suspected in patients with gastroesophageal varices, but without signs of a liver disease, especially if isolated gastric varices are found. The diagnosis is confirmed by portography."
CD008759,0,18294933,0,Diagnosis and monitoring of portal hypertension.,"Currently, oesophago-gastroduodenoscopy is the standard method to diagnose the presence of oesophago-gastric varices and to estimate the risk of bleeding. It is recommended that all patients undergo endoscopic screening for varices at the time when cirrhosis is diagnosed. After screening endoscopy, patients with medium or large varices should be treated to prevent bleeding, while all other patients should undergo periodic surveillance endoscopy. However, at a given point in time a variable proportion of patients will not have varices, since the prevalence of varices is variable. Thus, screening all cirrhotic patients with endoscopy to detect the presence of varices implies a number of unnecessary endoscopies. In recent years a wealth of new methods have been proposed as alternatives to conventional oesophago-gastroduodenoscopy for the non-invasive or minimally invasive diagnosis of oesophageal varices. Three of these methods (the platelet count/spleen diameter ratio, Fibrotest and Fibroscan) are truly non-invasive. Of these, the former is promising and needs a proper validation, Fibrotest appears to be insufficiently precise, while Fibroscan needs further evaluation. Multidetector CT oesophagography and capsule endoscopy are not entirely ""non-invasive"", since the first requires air insufflation into the oesophagus via an orally passed tube, and the latter requires swallowing the capsule. Multidetector CT oesophagography is promising, but needs further evaluation; capsule endoscopy is safe and reliable and might be proposed as an alternative to oesophago-gastroduodenoscopy in patients unable or unwilling to undergo oesophago-gastroduodenoscopy."

CD008759,0,15351894,0,Extrahepatic portal hypertension in children: observations on three surgical procedures.,"This paper presents a comparative prospective study of three modalities of surgical treatment for extrahepatic portal hypertension in children: central splenorenal shunt after splenectomy (CSS), side-to-side lienorenal shunt (SSLR) without splenectomy, and splenectomy and gastroesophageal devascularization (SGD). In an 18-month period, 27 procedures were performed: 10 CSS, 10 SSLR, and seven SGD. The outcomes were evaluated by fall in portal pressures, hematological parameters, shunt patency, splenic regression, and disappearance of esophageal varices. All three procedures were comparable in the fall of portal pressure after surgery. The average blood loss and operating time were statistically significant in favor of SSLR compared with CSS. At 3-month follow-up, shunt patency was confirmed by duplex Doppler study in all the patients in the SSLR group and in nine out of 10 patients in the CSS group. In the CSS and SGD groups, hypersplenism resolved in all the patients. In the SSLR group, blood counts improved in only five out of eight affected children. No patient re-bled during a follow-up of 3-5 years. There were no cases of hepatic encephalopathy or overwhelming postsplenectomy sepsis. In conclusion, CSS is useful when there is a large spleen, severe hypersplenism, and a shuntable splenic vein. SSLR is suitable when there is only mild splenomegaly, mild hypersplenism, and a shuntable splenic vein. Splenectomy and devascularization is the choice when there is no shuntable splenic vein."
CD008759,0,21922871,0,Management of extra hepatic portal venous obstruction (EHPVO): current strategies.,"Extrahepatic portal venous obstruction (EHPVO) is the commonest cause of portal hypertension and variceal bleeding in children. Though mortality related to variceal bleeding is uncommon, morbidity due to massive splenomegaly with hypersplenism, growth failure, ectopic varices like rectal varices and portal biliopathy is significant. A significant proportion of cases in adults are due to procoagulant state but the same has not been documented in children. Studies in children have shown that hereditary or acquired coagulation disorders do not play a role in the pathogenesis of EHPVO in children. Regarding endotherapy for variceal bleeding, there is no doubt that band ligation is superior to sclerotherapy. Nevertheless, a combination of band ligation followed by sclerotherapy has shown to be superior to either modality in children with EHPVO. Growth retardation due to growth hormone resistance is common in children with EHPVO. Diminished portal blood flow results in decreased insulin delivery to the liver and thereby decreased production of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-I) and insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3). Improvement of growth after restoration of hepatic blood flow with mesenteric-left-portal bypass or Rex shunt, has been documented. Portal biliopathy is universal in adults and common in children but symptomatic cases are mainly in adults; thereby suggesting a progressive nature of the condition. Symptomatic biliary obstruction can be managed endoscopically but shunt surgery followed by biliary bypass (if necessary) seems to be the best management option. With the availability of the most physiological shunt (mesenteric-left-portal bypass or Rex) the management paradigm of EHPVO has changed from endotherapy to primary shunt surgery."

An extensive diagnostic evaluation was completed within seven hours of hospital admission, and the shunt operation was undertaken within a mean of 8.5 hours. Follow-up study was conducted in a special clinic, and the current status of 97.1 per cent of the patients had jaundice, ascites or encephalopathy alone or in combination on admission. Systemic intravenous administration of posterior pituitary extract temporarily controlled the hemorrhage in 94 per cent of the patients, and the emergency portacaval shunt promptly and permanently controlled the varix bleeding in 96 per cent of the patients. Contrary to recent proposals, patients with the highest portal perfusion pressure and, presumably, the largest hepatopetal portal flow had the highest survival rate and those who were presumed from pressure measurements to sustain the smallest portal flow diversion from the shunt had the lowest survival rate. The operative survival rate was 51 per cent, the predicted seven year survival rate for those operated upon seven or more years ago was 42.5 per cent. Encephalopathy requiring dietary protein restriction developed at some time in 17 per cent of the survivors. Sixty per cent of the survivors abstained from alcohol, and 53 per cent resumed gainful employment or full time housekeeping. Preoperative factors that adversely influenced survial rate were ingestion of alcohol within one month of bleeding, ascites, severe muscle-wasting and a small liver. Postoperatively, the single most important factor that compromised long term survival was resumption of alcoholism. In comparisons with our previous prospective studies, emergency portacaval shunt resulted in a significantly greater long term survival rate than did either emergency medical therapy or emergency varix ligation, followed by elective shunt. It is concluded that emergency portacaval shunt is the most effective treatment of bleeding esophageal varices in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis. Criteria for exclusion of those patients who are unlikely to derive long term benefits from portacaval shunt remain to be defined by further studies."

In 10 of 19 patients, the development of peristomal varices was documented 12-133 mo after operation. Risk factors for the development of peristomal varices included splenomegaly, esophageal varices, advanced histologic stage at liver biopsy, low serum albumin, thrombocytopenia, and an increased prothrombin time. Recurrent bleeding from peristomal varices was a major problem; 7 of 10 patients required repeated blood transfusions. The only therapy of long-term benefit was surgical decompression of the portal venous system in 1 patient and liver transplantation in a second patient.

CD008759,0,11890333,0,Surgical treatment of schistosomal portal hypertension.,"Schistosomiasis mansoni is a widespread parasitic disease in the Brazilian territory that affects over 8 million individuals. Hepatosplenic schistosomiasis is a serious clinical presentation of this disease, associated with splenomegaly, liver fibrosis, and portal hypertension, and is responsible for approximately 7% of schistosomotic patients. The surgical treatment of portal hypertension in schistosomotic patients has distinct features when compared with cirrhotic patients, mostly because hepatic function is preserved in schistosomotic liver disease. Therefore, when attempting to reduce the portal pressure, the surgeon must be aware that the surgery might interfere with hepatic perfusion, and consequently with hepatic function. The aim of this study was to report the results achieved with splenectomy, division of the left gastric vein, devascularization of great gastric curvature, and postoperative endoscopic variceal sclerosis, as a surgical option to esophageal varices in hepatosplenic schistosomiasis. A total of 111 patients were studied, and the following is a list of inclusion criteria: age >16 years, history of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, presence of esophageal varices on preoperative endoscopy, hematocrit >22% and prothrombin enzymatic activity >50%, negative viral hepatitis on serologic tests (anti-HBV and anti-HCV), and definition, after liver biopsy, of exclusive schistosomotic liver disease. The following list includes exclusion criteria used: presence of liver disease other than schistosomotic, history of alcohol abuse, and preoperative thrombosis of the portal vein. The rebleeding rate was 14.4% during a mean 30-month follow-up period; portal vein thrombosis was 13.2%, and there was a global mortality of 5.4%. Gastric varices were present in 46.9% of the patients; for those patients, a gastrotomy and running suture of the varices achieved an eradication rate of the varices of 75.6%. The degree of periportal fibrosis was also analyzed. Periportal fibrosis staging revealed that patients with class II or III liver fibrosis had a significant increased risk of recurrent GI bleeding when compared with patients with class I liver fibrosis. Despite the elevation on alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), most other liver function tests showed no alteration or were corrected after surgery. We conclude that splenectomy, division of the left gastric vein, devascularization of great gastric curvature, and postoperative endoscopic variceal sclerosis showed good results globally and should be considered as therapeutic options in the treatment of hepatosplenic schistosomiasis."
CD008759,0,1591128,0,CT and angiography in chronic liver disease.,"Detailed correlation of CT and angiographic findings in a retrospective analysis of 25 cases of portal hypertension is presented. The largest diameters of the common and proper hepatic arteries, the portal, splenic, and superior mesenteric veins, and perigastric veins were measured by the two methods, including a CT control series of 20 subjects. The splenic transverse diameter was also measured. Portosystemic collaterals and concomitant pathology disclosed by the two methods were compared. A ratio of nearly 1 was found between vessel diameters measured by angiography and CT, and about 1.3 for splenic size, applying uncorrected measures from angiographic films and a vernier caliper on CT studies. The diameters of hepatic arteries, splenic, and superior mesenteric veins and spleens were significantly larger than those of controls. Except for demonstrating arterial details and esophageal varices, CT was found equal or superior to angiography in mapping portosystemic collaterals, and to disclose concomitant pathology."
CD008759,0,2640042,0,[Serum concentration of bile acids and portal hypertension in cirrhotic patients. Possible correlations].,"For the detection of mild liver disease (acute viral hepatitis, chronic persistent hepatitis, fatty liver) serum bile acids levels have not proved to be superior to transaminases or other common liver tests with almost similar sensitivity and/or specificity. Indeed it has been possible to show in patients with compensated cirrhosis of the liver that the serum bile acids concentration is related to the degree of intrahepatic shunts and that there was a significant relationship between the fasting serum bile acids and the intrinsic clearance of ICG. Measurement of serum bile acids appear to be more sensitive for detection of cirrhosis than commonly used tests. The elevation of bile acids concentration in cirrhotic patients is thought to result from a reduced hepatic clearance and/or from portosystemic shunting. In order to determine the role of serum bile acid estimation in the indirect assessment of portal hypertension, fasting and two-hour postprandial serum bile acids concentration were measured in 36 patients with liver cirrhosis, classified according to Child-Pugh's criteria. Real time ultrasonography, esophagogastroscopy and static liver scintigraphy of the liver were carried out in all patients. The size of esophageal varices, the portal vein and its related structure, the nuclear criteria were graded according to the common methods. Between the clinical findings, splenomegaly, was noted and graded, though the size of spleen does not correlate well with the level of portal pressure. In our patients a good correlation (p less than 0.001) existed between the two hour postprandial bile acids concentration and ultrasonographic findings of portal hypertension. Fasting serum bile acids (SBA) were significantly higher in severe than in mild liver cirrhosis according to Pugh's criteria (p less than 0.001). In conclusion we think that SBA concentrations have a great prognostic value in assessment of major complications (upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage particularly). The reduced liver blood flow, for intra-and extrahepatic porto-systemic shuntings, is probably the main cause of reduced hepatic clearance of bile acids."

Portal hypertension.","Eighty-five patients with chronic splenomegaly and proven oesophageal varices were studied at Kenyatta National Hospital, Nairobi. The major defined groups were hepatosplenic schistosomiasis (24%), cirrhosis (20%) and portal vein occlusion (11%). Hyper-reactive malarial splenomegaly (tropical splenomegaly syndrome) was considered as the cause of oesophageal varices in only one patient. In 26% of cases liver biopsy was non-diagnostic and the extrahepatic portal vein was demonstrated radiologically to be patent. Such patients were thought to be suffering from idiopathic portal hypertension, not previously described elsewhere in Africa. Hepatitis B surface antigen was detected in 12% of controls and in 58% of patients with cirrhosis (p less than 0.001). Some serological marker of previous hepatitis B virus infection was present in 92% of patients with cirrhosis and in 79% of controls. Kamba patients from Machakos and Kitui Districts were significantly more prevalent than expected among these 85 cases of portal hypertension."
CD008759,0,9706517,0,"Late clinical, biochemical, endoscopic and electroencephalographic evaluation of patients with schistosomal portal hypertension treated with distal splenorenal shunt.","The authors performed a late evaluation of a distal splenorenal anastomosis minimum of five years following operation on 13 patients with schistosomiasis of the compensated liver-splenic type. The study of the anastomosis had been proven patent when the evaluation took place. Each patient underwent clinical, laboratorial, endoscopic and electroencephalographic assessment. The results demonstrated that no patient had shown any sign of recurrence of upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Among the endoscopic aspects, esophageal varices disappeared in 46.1% of the cases. There was reduction in the number, extent and volume of esophageal varices in 46.1%, 38.4% and 53.8% of the cases. Gastric varices disappeared in 91.6% of the cases. Only one patient (7.6%) had shown clinical and electroencephalographic signs of hepatic encephalopathy in the late final evaluation (non-significant). Only one patient (7.6%) had shown late postoperative ascites (non-significant). There were no significant alterations in serum levels of sodium, potassium, urea and creatinine in all the 13 patients. The values of indirect serum bilirubin increased in 92.3% of the patients. There was regression of splenomegaly in all 13 patients, as well as a significant improvement in their hematological values. There were no significant changes in the serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase or in the activity of the plasma prothrombin. The authors concluded that the distal splenorenal anastomosis became a protection factor against upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage and led to long-term improvement in the endoscopic aspects of esophagogastric varices, a significant improvement in the laboratorial aspects of hypersplenism and a marked reduction of splenomegaly with no significant changes in the hydroelectrolytic metabolism, renal function and hepatic function and had not compromised, long term, the quality of life of the majority of patients."
CD008759,0,7856971,0,Partial portal decompression alleviates thrombocytopenia of portal hypertension.,"Thrombocytopenia due to splenic sequestration of platelets occurs commonly in patients with portal hypertension. Partial portal decompression for bleeding esophagogastric varices, via the small diameter H-graft portacaval shunt (HGPS), is intended to partially decompress the portal system below bleeding threshold but also to maintain a degree of portal hypertension sufficient to maintain prograde portal perfusion. This study was undertaken to determine whether the reduction of portal pressures seen in patients undergoing HGPS is sufficient to relieve the thrombocytopenia seen in patients with portal hypertension. A total of 74 patients underwent small diameter HGPS for bleeding esophagogastric varices not amenable to medical management. Thirty-four (46%) patients had thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 80,000/mL) before shunting. Platelet counts were obtained preshunt, at discharge, and from 1 to 3 years after shunting. Portal pressures decreased significantly from 30mm Hg +/- 5.6 (SD) pre shunt to 19mm Hg +/- 5.8 (SD) after shunting (P < 0.001). Platelet counts increased from a pre-shunt value of 61,000/mL +/- 2,700 (SEM) to a platelet count of 139,000/mL +/- 21,800 (SEM) at discharge (P < 0.006) and to 102,000/mL +/- 17,500 (SEM) 1 to 3 years after shunting (P < 0.001). Patients undergoing portasystemic shunting for bleeding esophagogastric varices are frequently thrombocytopenic. Partial portal decompression using the 8 mm HGPS is sufficient to alleviate thrombocytopenia associated with portal hypertension immediately following HGPS and for years to follow. The presence of thrombocytopenia does not preclude the use of partial portal decompression in patients with bleeding varices requiring operative intervention."
CD008759,0,8307479,0,Longterm outcome after injection sclerotherapy for oesophageal varices in children with extrahepatic portal hypertension.,"A consecutive series of 36 children with bleeding from oesophageal varices secondary to extrahepatic portal hypertension was successfully treated by endoscopic injection sclerotherapy and followed up over a mean period of 8.7 years after variceal obliteration. There were no deaths from portal hypertension or its treatment and morbidity related to oesophageal sclerotherapy was minimal. Endoscopic injection sclerotherapy alone proved safe and effective in controlling variceal bleeding from portal hypertension in over 80% of the children. Recurrent variceal bleeding developed in 10 (31%) patients but half of these were effectively treated by further sclerotherapy. Gastric variceal bleeding unresponsive to sclerotherapy necessitated successful portosystemic shunt surgery in four (13%) patients. Two children required splenectomy for painful splenomegaly. In most children injection sclerotherapy is the best treatment for the primary management of bleeding oesophageal varices, reserving portosystemic shunting or other surgical procedures for those with bleeding from gastrointestinal varices."

This study was conducted to investigate the independent indicators of recurrent hemorrhage in cirrhotic patients within 6 weeks after cessation of initial EV bleeding. Ninety-seven consecutive cirrhotic patients with EV bleeding, but without evidence of infection, who were admitted to our hospital between December 2005 and February 2008 were retrospectively analyzed.

CD008759,0,1081742,0,Splenic artery ligation in selected patients with hepatic cirrhosis and in Sprague-Dawley rats.,"The effects of splenic artery ligation were studied in Sprague-Dawley rats and in eight selected symptomatic patients with hepatic cirrhosis. In rats, this maneuver induced splenic infarction, reduced functional splenic mass, transiently raised platelet and reticulocyte counts and was without local complications. In seven selected patients with cirrhosis and prominent splenomegaly, the splenic artery was markedly enlarged, splenic arterial flow was greatly increased and splenic artery ligation partially lowered portal pressure. In three patients with varying cytopenias secondary to hypersplenism splenic artery ligation uniformly improved peripheral blood elements, although varying degrees of hypersplenism later recurred necessitating splenectomy in one. In five other patients, splenic artery ligation in conjunction with coronary vein ligation in four was performed for bleeding esophageal varices. Two patients later required portacaval shunting, and one other in whom operation was undertaken in desperation died of hepatic failure. Celiac-mesenteric arterioportography, operative portography, hemodynamic measurements and examination of peripheral blood elements in these eight patients suggests that splenic artery ligation in conjunction, where appropriate, with coronary vein ligation has several potentially beneficial effects. Hypersplenism may be sufficiently controlled to alleviate clinical symptoms. Arterial inflow into the portal system is reduced tending to lower portal pressure. Transheptic portal flow from the mesenteric bed is preserved. Venous anastomotic channels still functioning around the splenic pedicle and no longer draining a hyperdynamic splenic circuit may be converted into an escape route for mesenteric venous blood entering the portal system under high pressure. Nonetheless, each of these effects and their interrelationships require further study before this operation assumes a larger role in the treatment of complications of portal hypertension."
CD008759,0,16952592,0,Outcome of total splenectomy with portosystemic shunt for massive splenomegaly and variceal bleeding in cystic fibrosis.,"Multilobular biliary cirrhosis and portal hypertension are frequent complications of cystic fibrosis liver disease, leading to esophageal varices and splenomegaly. Therapy is focused on variceal bleeding control; however, reduction of spleen volume is also important to restore gastric volume and resolve invalidating abdominal discomfort. We report long-term follow up (median duration, 5.5 years; range, 14 months-21.5 years) of 6 patients with cystic fibrosis (4 men, 2 women; median age, 14 years; range, 8-18 years) who underwent splenectomy with a splenorenal shunt operation. Three patients received elective surgery for massive splenomegaly with important abdominal discomfort, recurrent variceal bleeding, and hypersplenism. Three were urgently treated to control variceal bleeding after several sessions of sclerotherapy. All but 2 received antipneumococcal vaccination before surgery. Four patients had a weight gain of 10% within 3 months of surgery, and 3 developed spontaneous puberty. Lung function remained stable, and there was an overall reduction of respiratory tract infections. The youngest patient, however, died of overwhelming septicemia during treatment with steroids. Although total splenectomy has important risks, in well-selected cases, it can have benefits. Immuno- and chemoprophylaxis, combined with patient awareness of supplementary risk of infections is indispensable to minimize septic complications."

Prolongation of the PT and APTT and decreases in fibrinogen and alpha 2-PI were seen in the thrombin (TH), sodium tetradecyl sulfate (STS), and ethanolamine oleate (EO) groups. Polidocanol (PO) and absolute ethanol (ET) had less pronounced effects on these systems. A transient decrease in the cardiac index (CI), pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) and pulmonary artery resistance (PAR) was observed with the administration of the sclerosants, especially in the TH and STS groups.

Histologically the hepatic tissue showed occlusion of intrahepatic portal-vein branches by organised thrombi, as well as angiomatous vessels in the sclerosed portal areas. the increased pressure as well as medial atrophy with portal-vein sclerosis were the cause of the portal-vein aneurysm. Portal hypertension may have been the result of intrahepatic vascular obstruction and of the increased flow through the enlarged spleen. It is suggested that interaction of several factors, related to the basic disease of myelofibrosis led to these complex anomalies of the liver and portal vascular system."

Age at the onset of gastro-intestinal bleeding 3 1/2 months and 13 years. Splenomegaly with hypersplenism, hematemesis and melena have been the most frequent clinical manifestations. Percutaneous splenoportography be coelio-mesenteric arteriography confirmed the diagnosis of cavernomatous transformation of the portal vein. Among the 31 children, 28 bled from their varices, the 3 others did not to date. Among the 28 patients with active bleeding complication, 7 have been treated conservatively, 11 had sclerotherapy (sclerosing injections of varices). On the surgical point of view, 7 had ligation of varices with intra-thoracic transposition of the spleen in 5 of them. Portosystemic shunts were performed in 10 patients, 3 central spleno-renal and 7 cavo-mesenteric shunt. Each of these 28 patients had an average of 9,5 episodes of gastro-intestinal bleeding, 8.7 hospitalizations, and received 7.5 liter of blood. Medical treatment, sclerotherapy, ligature of varices and intra-thoracic transposition of the spleen are palliative measures. Nevertheless the procedures are time and life savers, allowing improvement and development of natural porto-systemic shunts. Follow up of unshunted patients on a period of 8 to 17 years revealed a decreasing frequency and intensity of the hemorrhagic manifestations. Operative risks and morbidity of recurrent bleeding should be the guidelines for surgery. Natural course of illness and possible neuro-psychiatric consequences of a porto-caval shunt should also be considered."

Bleeding from esophageal varices occurred only in cases with recurrence of jaundice or moderate biliary retention, i.e. for 6 children. A portocaval shunt was constructed in 7 cases; all had bled except one. One child died two and a half years later from pneumococcal sepsis after a splenorenal shunt with splenectomy; another child had numerous recurrence of bleeding episodes. Five children have a functional shunt and have not rebled. When biliary atresia is cured by hepatoportoenterostomy, with complete disappearance of biliary retention, the risk of bleeding from esophageal varices is unlikely, in spite of persistent cirrhotic alterations of the liver; in these children, there should very seldom be an indication for a portocaval shunt."

CD008759,0,8215980,0,The role of neurogenetics in Gaucher disease.,"Gaucher disease is the most prevalent hereditary metabolic storage disorder, and the most common genetic disease in individuals of Ashkenazic Jewish ancestry. Patients with Gaucher disease have been classified into three clinical phenotypes. Patients with type 1 disease exhibit markedly variable hepatosplenomegaly, anemia, thrombocytopenia, skeletal, and, to a lesser extent, pulmonary and kidney involvement. The central nervous system does not appear to be involved. In patients with type 2 Gaucher disease, hepatosplenomegaly and extensive central nervous system damage are apparent in infancy. These patients usually die between 1 and 2 years of age. Patients with type 3 Gaucher disease have been subclassified into types 3a and 3b. Type 3a patients exhibit mild-to-moderate hepatosplenomegaly and slowly progressive neurologic deterioration. Recurrent myoclonic seizures are common. Patients with type 3b Gaucher disease exhibit splenomegaly along with extensive hepatomegaly that is frequently accompanied by esophageal varices. Horizontal supranuclear gaze paresis is the major neurologic sign. Excessive quantities of glucocerebroside accumulate in the organs of patients with Gaucher disease because of a deficiency of the enzyme glucocerebrosidase. In the vast majority of patients, the reduction of glucocerebrosidase activity is caused by mutations in the gene that codes for glucocerebrosidase. In a few instances, glucocerebroside accumulates due to a lack of saposin C, a cohydrolase that is required in addition to glucocerebrosidase for the catabolism of glucocerebroside. Mutations in the glucocerebrosidase gene are discussed in the context of the severity of disease and the presence or absence of nervous system involvement. Enzyme replacement therapy is highly beneficial for patients with type 1 Gaucher disease. Enzyme replacement is also being investigated for patients with type 3b Gaucher disease. Novel procedures must be developed to deliver glucocerebrosidase to the nervous system so that patients with type 2 and type 3a Gaucher disease can be helped.

Having increased aspirin to 4mg/kg/day, three of the seven aspirin resistant patients responded, while one developed upper GI bleeding from esophageal varices and was withdrawn from the study. For the three remaining patients, their doses were increased to the maximum of 300mg/day, and two of the three responded. Thrombin antithrombin complex and D-dimer levels were significantly decreased after taking aspirin (2mg/kg/day), although D-dimer level was still significantly higher than that in non-splenectomized group. Therefore, aspirin dosage can be adjusted individually to reach maximum effect of platelet inhibition. In addition, aspirin can reduce the levels of coagulation markers."

We assessed the value of 2D-U/S technology in predicting the source of UGIB.Of 38,551 patients presenting to ED, 900 patients (2.3%), 534 male (59.3%) and 366 female (40.7%) developed UGIB. Analyzing results obtained from U/S examinations by data mining for emergent UGE were patients with liver cirrhosis (LC), splenomegaly, and ascites (42.6% incidence of UGIB), followed by LC and splenomegaly (14.6%), LC only (9.4%), and was only 0.5% who had no morbidity finding by 2D-U/S.Ultrasonographic instrumentation increases the feasibility of predictive emergency medicine. The area has recently not only gained a fresh impulse, but also a new set of complex problems that needs to be addressed in the emergency medicine setting according to each priority."

At diagnosis both children had low platelet counts, one also had leucopenia. The cystic disease of the kidneys was verified by angiography. Coeliacography and splenopartography were diagnostically irrelevant. The diagnosis only became apparent from liver biopsy which was performed during splenectomy. After splenectomy there was an increase of platelets, white blood cells and the clotting factors II, V and X. The three years follow-up showed a constancy of renal impairment and of the minor oesophageal varices observed in the one patient who did not have a spontaneous spleno-renal anastomosis. So far no bleeding has been observed. Porto caval anastomosis was omitted in both children. Pros and cons are being discussed."

CD008759,0,6605419,0,Portal obstruction in children. I. Clinical investigation and hemorrhage risk.,"We examined 108 children with obstruction of the portal vein. Symptoms included splenomegaly and gastrointestinal tract hemorrhage. Obstruction was secondary to portal vein injury in 44 children and was combined with congenital malformations in 17 others. Ultrasonography provided the correct diagnosis in 36 of the 37 children in whom it was performed. Angiography, performed in 101 children, showed that the obstruction extended to the superior mesenteric vein in 14 children and to the entire portal venous system in seven; intrahepatic branches were involved in half the cases. Natural splenorenal shunts were visible in 19 children but were not clearly associated with a lower risk of gastrointestinal tract bleeding; in five of 30 children, cavography displayed abnormalities of the inferior vena cava. Spontaneous gastrointestinal tract hemorrhage occurred in 78 children. Fiberoptic endoscopy showed esophageal varices in 79 of the 81 children studied. The presence of tense varices and congestion of esophageal mucosa clearly augmented the risk of bleeding. These results suggest a simple method of investigation based on ultrasonography for diagnosis and on endoscopy for prognosis. Angiography should be limited to children with a history of gastrointestinal tract bleeding for whom a surgical portosystemic shunt is being considered."
CD008759,0,25914217,0,Impact of clinically evident portal hypertension on the course of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients listed for liver transplantation.,"Liver transplantation (LT) is the best curative treatment for early hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with cirrhosis. However, the current shortage of organs causes prolonged waiting times and poorer intention-to-treat (ITT) survival (i.e., after listing) owing to tumor progression and dropout. Portal hypertension (PH) is a recognized risk factor of HCC development in patients with cirrhosis and its recurrence after resection. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential impact of PHT on the results of LT on an ITT basis. Patients with cirrhosis listed for LT for HCC were included and their outcomes after listing were compared according to the presence or absence of PH defined as presence of esophageal varices or ascites or low platelet count and splenomegaly. Among 243 consecutively listed patients, 70% were affected by PH, which was associated with a significantly higher risk of tumor progression (38% vs. 22%; P = 0.017) and a higher risk of dropout (22% vs. 8%; P = 0.01). Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) was similarly applied to the two groups (60% vs. 67%; P = 0.325). An absence of TACE was the only other independent risk factor of dropout owing to tumor progression. Under an ITT analysis, PH reduced overall survival (OS), but there was no difference in OS and time to recurrence post-LT. The only pathological feature that could potentially explain this observation was the lower complete response to TACE in the PHT group (12% vs. 36%; P = 0.001)."

The sarcoidosis regressed rapidly after high doses (60 mg/day) of prednisone. Portal hypertension developed later and provoked a severe hematemesis from rupture of esophageal varices. Signs of pulmonary arterial hypertension were then observed, and the diagnosis confirmed by pressure tests after catheterization, and angiography. A portocaval shunt caused the esophageal varices to subside, but the pulmonary arterial hypertension, resistant to corticotherapy, was rapidly fatal. In the case reported, the pulmonary arterial hypertension, independent of any parenchymatous lesion, was attributed to fibrosis of the arterial walls. The association of portal and pulmonary arterial hypertension with sarcoidosis is a very rare occurrence, and the pathogenesis of this association remains a debatable subject."

The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of liver cirrhosis, its main causes and clinical presentation in HIV+ patients. Observational, cross-sectional, retrospective study of all HIV+ individuals followed at one reference HIV outpatient clinic in Madrid. Liver fibrosis was measured in all cases using transient elastometry (FibroScan). All 2168 HIV+ patients on regular follow-up (76% males, 46% injecting drug users) were successfully examined by FibroScan) between October 2004 and August 2006. Liver cirrhosis was recognized in 181 (overall prevalence, 8.3%), and the main aetiologies were HCV, 82.3%; HBV, 1.6%; dual HBV/HCV, 2.8%; and triple HBV/HCV/ hepatitis delta virus (HDV) infection, 6.6%. The prevalence of cirrhosis differed among patients with distinct chronic viral hepatitis: HCV, 19.2%; HBV, 6.1%; HBV/HCV, 41.7%; and HBV/HCV/HDV, 66.7%. In 12 patients with cirrhosis (6.7%), no definite aetiology was recognized. Overall, cirrhotics had lower mean CD4 counts than noncirrhotics (408 vs 528 cells/microL respectively; P = 0.02), despite similar proportion of subjects with undetectable viraemia on highly active antiretroviral therapy. Clinical manifestations of liver cirrhosis were: splenomegaly, 61.5%; oesophageal varices, 59.8%; ascites, 22.6%; encephalopathy, 12.1%; and variceal bleeding, 6.1%. Liver cirrhosis and hepatic decompensation events are relatively frequent in HIV+ individuals. Chronic HCV and alcohol abuse, but not chronic HBV, play a major role.

A 33-year-old Japanese male who had undergone renal transplantation 8 years previously was transferred to our hospital because of hematemesis from ruptured esophageal varices. He had no history of any liver disease before the renal transplantation, but had a history of receiving blood transfusion. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) and ultrasonography revealed marked splenomegaly and collateral channels, but no obliteration which might cause portal hypertension in the hepatic or portal vein. No findings suggestive of hepatitis or liver cirrhosis were found either macroscopically on laparoscopy or by liver biopsy. Light microscopic study of the liver biopsy specimen showed mild periportal fibrosis, inconspicuous portal branches in the most peripheral tracts, but no pseudolobule formation or piecemeal necrosis. However collagen deposition was found in the perisinusoidal space and partly in intercellular space on electron microscopy. We consider that the development of portal hypertension in this case is responsible for the collagen deposition, which may be related to the administration of azathioprine after renal transplantation. There are few reports on IPH after renal transplantation, and it is stressed that a lower amount of azathioprine than previously reported may induce IPH under such conditions."

CD008759,0,6608145,0,[Hemorrhagic portal hypertension with soft liver].,"Over 14 years the authors have observed 6 adults with a special form of portal hypertension revealed by massive gastrointestinal hemorrhages due to rupture of voluminous esophageal varices. Though first suggested by huge enlargement of the spleen (5 out of 6 cases), cirrhosis was eventually discounted by laparoscopy and laparotomy. The liver was of normal volume, smooth (never nodular) and above all soft to the touch, to the biopsy needle and to the surgeon's hand. The histologic lesions of the liver were minimal and heterogeneous: fibrosis without cirrhosis (2 cases), isolated and mild steatosis (2 cases), one non-specific lymphohistiocytic granuloma (2 cases), moderate myeloid metaplasia (2 cases), hepatic siderosis without fibrosis (1 case), sinusoidal congestion (3 cases). Normality of the portal vein was evidenced by angiography (5 cases) or inferred from the elevated porta-caval gradient (1 case), and was confirmed once on autopsy. Sus-hepatic catheterization was performed in every case and provided the following information: right atrial pressure always normal, sus-hepatic veins normal, porta-caval gradient normal or slightly elevated in 4 patients (suggesting presinusoidal block) and obviously elevated in the other two (as in post-sinusoidal block). The minimal histologic lesions of the liver, the normality of the portal vein, the lack of sus-hepatic obstruction, and the variable porta-caval gradient make it impossible to localize the obstacle (if any) and thus say what is the mechanism of portal hypertension with soft liver. In the absence of elevated splenic inflow, this hypertension has to be classified as essential or idiopathic. Soft consistency of the liver has never been reported before in such cases."

During 7 years of close follow-up, the patient presented with multiple major episodes of upper and lower gastrointestinal bleeding caused by different pathogenic mechanisms, such as IBD, AvWD, gastric varices, and thrombocytopenia. AvWD mimicking familial vWD type III on laboratory testing was most probably triggered by autoimmune mechanism associated with PBC. Therapy of PBC with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) resulted in significant decrease of liver enzymes followed by normalization of vWF and FVIII levels. Portosystemic shunt placement with ligation of gastric varices improved hypersplenism and severe thrombocytopenia and led to clinical stability for more than 24 months. The clinicopathological features of these disorders and of the recurrent bleeding episodes are discussed in the text along with a review of the literature."

CD008759,0,21031538,0,Differences in portal hemodynamics between whole liver transplantation and living donor liver transplantation.,"The aim of this study was to investigate the differences in portal hemodynamics between whole liver transplantation and living donor liver transplantation (LDLT). Twenty patients who underwent LDLT (the L group) and 42 patients who underwent whole liver transplantation (the W group) were enrolled, and colored Doppler ultrasonography was performed preoperatively and on postoperative days (PODs) 1, 3, 5, 7, 30, and 90. The changes in the portal blood flow velocity (PBV) and portal blood flow volume (PBF) were monitored. The graft and spleen sizes were measured with angiographic computed tomography, and upper endoscopy was used to measure esophageal varices on PODs 14, 30, and 90. Although the portal venous pressure (PVP) decreased after graft implantation, it was higher in the L group with a smaller graft size ratio (25.7 ± 5.1 cm H₂O for the L group and 18.5 ± 4.6 cm H₂O for the W group, P < 0.05). PBF and PBV increased in both the W and L groups on POD 1 after transplantation; however, the PBF and PBV peaks were significantly higher in the W group. The postoperative PVP and graft volume were greatly related to PBF on POD 1. Grafts in the L group regenerated rapidly after the operation, and the volume increased from 704 ± 115 to 1524 ± 281 mL as early as 1 month after transplantation. A rapid improvement in splenomegaly was observed in both groups. An improvement in esophageal varices was observed in the W group on POD 14 after transplantation, whereas no change was observed in the L group. The portal venous flow in patients with portal hypertension showed a high perfusion state after LDLT, but in contrast to whole liver transplantation, the PVP elevation after LDLT postponed the closing time of the collateral circulation and affected the recovery from splenomegaly."

This was the only time such a case had ever been encountered in a pregnancy in the history of Turin University's Obstetrics and Gynaecological Clinic. The case of a 20-year-old woman is considered. She was admitted to our observation at the Obstetrics and Gynaecological Department of Faculty ""B"" of the University of Turin, suffering from CHF, a primigravid in the eighth week of gestation. Haematochemical tests carried out on the patient showed a platelet deficiency without evident changes in liver and renal function. Objective examination revealed a slight hepatosplenomegaly confirmed by abdominal echotomography. The haematochemical examinations subsequently carried out confirmed thrombocytopenia due to hepatosplenic hyperhaemocataresis. In agreement with the will of the patient and her family, and after having heard the opinion of our hospital's anaesthetists and internists, a conservative approach was decided on and close monitoring of maternal and foetal conditions was planned, with hospitalisations scheduled for every fortnight. Together with the internists and anaesthetists, it was decided to allow the pregnancy to proceed as far as foetal maturity but not to term, to avoid problems relating to the excessive increase in uterine volume which would have led to pressure on the portal tree and so favoured haemorrhaging due to rupture of the oesophageal varices. Caesarean delivery was planned for the 37th week of gestation. The birth went according to plan and the foetus was a live, vital male with Apgar index of 9/9. The placenta presented normal characteristics and a weight of 590 g. No haemorrhagic complications were observed either in the course of surgery or in the postoperative phase, notwithstanding the preoperative finding of a platelet count of 64,000 platelets/ mm3. Although in our case neither the pregnancy nor the delivery constituted a serious danger for the life of the mother, possible obstetric complications are among the most serious encountered in obstetric pathology and can lead both to maternal death and to the intrauterine death of the foetus. For these reasons we believe it essential to provide correct, clear and adequate information about the risks involved for patients suffering from congenital hepatic fibrosis, especially if they are associated with renal polycystic disease, and who are admitted to our wards with the desire to programme a pregnancy."

Biopsies were possible in 165 cases. When all 144 patients with ascites were separately analyzed, 82% were due to cirrhosis of the liver with or without PHC and 9% tuberculous peritonitis. There was a good correlation between laparoscopic and histological diagnosis. Though invasive, the procedure carries low morbidity and the diagnostic yield is high. The laparoscope, therefore, should be considered as an appropriate technology for developing countries."
CD008759,0,12870732,1,Non-invasive predictors of the presence of large oesophageal varices in patients with cirrhosis.,"The usual clinical practice is to screen all patients with established cirrhosis at the time of diagnosis by upper endoscopy for the presence of varices. Patients with large varices should be treated with non-selective beta blockers to reduce the incidence of first variceal bleeding. However, fewer than 50% of cirrhotic patients have varices at screening endoscopy and most have small sized varices, with a low risk of bleeding. The aim of the present study was to determine whether clinical or laboratory non-endoscopic parameters could predict the presence of large oesophageal varices."

Noncirrhotic portal hypertension with bleeding esophageal varices, splenomegaly, and hypersplenism may occur. A metallic taste, gastrointestinal disturbances, and Mee's lines may be seen. Bone marrow depression is common. 'Blackfoot disease' has been associated with arsenic-contaminated drinking water in Taiwan; Raynaud's phenomenon and acrocyanosis also may occur. Large numbers of persons in areas of India, Pakistan, and several other countries have been chronically poisoned from naturally occurring arsenic in ground water. Toxic delirium and encephalopathy can be present. CCA-treated wood (chromated copper arsenate) is not a health risk unless burned in fireplaces or woodstoves. Peripheral neuropathy may also occur. Workplace exposure or chronic ingestion of arsenic-contaminated water or arsenical medications is associated with development of skin, lung, and other cancers. Treatment may incklude the use of chelating agents such as dimercaprol (BAL), dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), and dimercaptopanesulfonic acid (DMPS)."

At age 63 years, endoscopic ablation with cyanoacrylate glue had been performed for bleeding gastric varices. At the time of the present admission, a low-density mass (about 23 mm in diameter) was seen in the tail of the pancreas, and splenic vein occlusion and collateral veins were revealed on computed tomography. A hypoechoic tumor (about 22 mm in diameter) and splenic vein occlusion were clearly visualized on the pancreas tail via endoscopic ultrasonography. Venous phase of the splenic arteriogram revealed a completely occluded splenic vein in the hilus of the spleen. Thus, the patient was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer (stage I: T2N0M0). A surgical resection of the pancreatic tumor was performed, and a pancreatic tail resection with part of stomach around the pancreas tail, and splenectomy, were selected for this patient, in June 1998. Histopathological examination of the resected tumor revealed capsuled abscess formation with foreign body reaction between the stomach and the pancreas tail, and necrosis was present in the pancreas around the abscess. There were some deposits of cyanoacrylate glue in the tumor. The mass was considered to be an inflammatory tumor. In summary, this case of inflammatory pancreas tumor is a novel complication after endoscopic obliterative therapy with cyanoacrylate glue."

CD008759,0,3560244,0,Volvulus of the stomach: an African series and a review.,"A radiological diagnosis of gastric volvulus (GV) was made in 11 of 576 consecutive upper gastrointestinal series at the University of Benin Teaching Hospital, Nigeria, over a two-year period. The clinical symptoms were thoracico-abdominal in three and abdominal in eight; these cases were evaluated as acute in three, acute upon chronic in two, and chronic in six. There was a significant delay in the diagnosis in all cases (except a neonate in the series), and no case was diagnosed on clinical grounds alone.THE PREDISPOSING FACTORS (EXCEPT THE CLINICAL MISDIAGNOSIS OF THE NEONATE) IN SIX OF THE SEVEN CASES THAT CAME TO SURGERY WERE: diaphragmatic hernia and perigastritis (left lung abscess, thoracic empyema), arteriomesenteric compression of the duodenum in pregnancy (peptic ulcer), splenomegaly (hepatosplenomegaly, ascites, esophageal varices), previous gastrojejunostomy (stomal ulcer, left subphrenic abscess) and two cases of intestinal malrotation with mesenteric abnormalities (small bowel obstruction in one and duodenal atresia in the other). In one idiopathic case, gastric outlet obstruction was clinically suspected prior to surgery. Thus, the putative rarity of GV in black Africans is not supported by this experience.Gastric volvulus is a clinico-radiologic entity that may present with a confusing thoracico-abdominal symptom complex. A greater awareness of the radiologic features is quintessential to an expeditious and usually successful surgical management that will avoid potentially serious complications. Negative surgical findings do not exclude GV as the underlying cause of acute abdomens necessitating emergency laparotomies."

The complication was seen in 14 of 140 (10%) patients with polycythemia vera (PV), 3 of 23 (13%) patients with essential thrombocythemia (ET), 1 of 106 (1%) patients with idiopathic myelofibrosis (IMF), and none of 232 patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Leading symptoms and signs were abdominal pain, progressive splenomegaly, widening abdominal girth, ascites, venous collaterals, and nausea and vomiting. The diagnostic modalities with highest specificity were angiography and explorative laparotomy. A causal relationship between the thrombotic event and hematocrit, thrombocyte count, or hemostatic abnormalities at the time of diagnosis could not be established. Detailed laboratory tests of platelet function and coagulation and fibrinolytic parameters of 5 surviving patients did not show any specific defect. Despite medical and surgical intervention, 39% of the patients died within 2 months after diagnosis of the thrombosis. The majority of the survivors developed further complications like liver cirrhosis with portal hypertension and esophageal varices or the short bowel syndrome after extensive bowel resection for mesenterial infarction."

We sought to define the predictors for the presence of varices at baseline and for newly developing varices in patients with PSC. We used prospectively collected data from a multicenter randomized trial of high dose ursodeoxycholic acid for PSC. All 150 patients enrolled were reviewed for predictors of varices and we excluded 26 patients who had esophageal varices at baseline so that predictors of newly developing varices could be determined. Clinical examination, blood tests, and upper endoscopy were done before randomization, at 2 years and after 5 years. Liver biopsy was performed at entry and at 5 years. The median age (interquartile range) of patients was 45.9 years (35.8, 54.9). In a multivariable logistic regression, a higher Mayo risk score (> or =0.87) or a higher aspartate/alanine aminotransferase (AST/ALT) ratio (> or =1.12) were significantly associated with the presence of varices at initial endoscopy (odds ratio = 1.9 and 3.9). By the end of the study, 25 patients had new varices (20.2%). In a Cox model, after adjustment for baseline variables lower platelet count and higher total bilirubin at 2 years were significantly associated with the presence of new varices. The platelet count of 205 (x 10(9)/L) and the total bilirubin level of 1.7 mg/dL were the best cutoff values for the detection of new varices."
CD008759,0,4472192,0,Management of extrahepatic portal hypertension in children.,"Among 69 patients with PVT, 338 variceal bleeding episodes occurred. Only two patients died from bleeding, and both lived in remote communities and were inaccessible to medical care. Fifty-three children underwent 164 operations for the management of PVT. Once operative management was undertaken, subsequent operations frequently were necessary. Nonoperative measures controlled acute variceal hemorrhage in most instances during the past 10 years. Almost all patients who underwent splenectomy alone, variceal ligation, gastric division, splenic transposition, or makeshift shunts subsequently rebled. These operations are rarely indicated in the current management of children with PVT. Portal venography is essential to define the portal venous circulation before a shunt operation is attempted. Cavomesenteric or central splenorenal shunts prevented further bleeding in eight of 15 patients and are the most reliable operations to control bleeding in patients with PVT. Emergency operation is rarely necessary to control bleeding. Sixteen patients (average age 14.6 years) with PVT did not undergo any operations, and are alive. Each of the six patients with PVT who died from complications of portal hypertension did so within nine months of an operation. Four of these patients had previous splenectomy and died with sepsis as one of the major factors. Bleeding episodes became less frequent as the patients increased in age. Patients who underwent shunts under unfavorable circumstances or who received various other operations to treat portal hypertension appeared to have a higher risk of morbidity and mortality than those managed nonoperatively."

A 74-year-old man consulted our hospital for further examination after a mass screening for gastric cancer. On physical examination liver enlargement was palpable, but liver function tests were normal. Abdominal ultrasonography, computed tomography, technetium-99m liver scintigraphy, and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography revealed a small right hepatic lobe and moderate splenomegaly, in contrast to a hypertrophic lateral segment of the left hepatic lobe, as well as ectopic dislocation of the gallbladder. Endoscopic examination revealed esophageal varices, indicating portal hypertension. Abdominal angiography demonstrated mild shunt flow between the hepatic artery feeding from the gastroduodenal artery and the portal vein. A biopsy specimen taken from both lobes of the liver showed normal liver tissue histologically. Based on these findings, we made a definite diagnosis of hypogenesis of the right lobe of the liver with portal hypertension. The present case appears to be the first such case accompanied by portal hypertension reported in Japan."

The patient suffered three episodes of variceal bleeding, but the esophageal varices were not eradicated by two sessions of endoscopic injection sclerotherapy and endoscopic band ligation. Abdominal ultrasonography and computed tomography showed a giant accessory spleen (6 x 6 x 5 cm), gallbladder stones, and complete postsplenectomy splenomesoportal thrombosis. Subsequent 99mTc scintigraphy confirmed the presence of a functioning residual splenic nodule. Thus, we performed gastroesophageal devascularization (Hassab-Paquet procedure) with accessory splenectomy and cholecystectomy, after which the platelet count normalized and no further variceal bleeding occurred during 17 months of follow-up. To our knowledge, this is the first report in the English medical literature of accessory splenectomy for recurrent thrombocytopenia in a patient with liver cirrhosis."

Only 7 cases have been reported previously. The patient presented with bleeding esophageal varices. Splenomegaly and hyperkeratosis of palms and soles were later noted and led to the discovery of chronic arsenic poisoning.

Combination of thrombocytopenia (less than 100 10(9)/l) and a bleeding time greater than 8 mn was more frequent in Group B (80%) than in Group A (45%) (p = less than 0.05). On the other hand, no significant difference between the two groups was found in the activated cephalin time, thrombin time, prothrombin complex factors (II, V, VII-X), fibrinogen, antithrombin III, Factor VIII complex factors, FDP levels or plasminogen. In conclusion, these results suggest that disorders of primary haemostasis may be involved in bleeding from gastro-intestinal varices in cirrhosis.

However, direct demonstration of gastroesophageal varices by ultrasonography is still very difficult. An attempt was done to correlate sonographic features of portal hypertension with the degree of fibrosis to screen patients having varices and predicting their chance of bleeding. The results obtained were found to be consistent with the esophagogastric endoscopy and with history of hematemesis. Four parameters were used, size of spleen, degree of periportal fibrosis, presence of collaterals and portal vein diameter. A pilot field survey was also done adopting the same principle."

He subsequently received 10 cycles of a modified 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin (mFOLFOX6) regimen as adjuvant chemotherapy from June 2008 to December 2008, following which he developed thrombocytopenia and splenomegaly. In May 2011, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed, which revealed esophageal and gastric varices. The varices were treated endoscopically with ligation and balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration. A liver biopsy was performed to determine the cause of the portal hypertension in the absence of severe hepatic dysfunction or liver cirrhosis. The biopsy revealed obliteration of the peripheral portal veins with sinusoidal dilatation without fibrosis or inflammatory cell infiltration in the hepatic lobules. Oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy has been associated with hepatovascular injury, such as sinusoidal dilatation and fibrosis, resulting in non-cirrhotic portal hypertension as seen in this case."

CD008759,0,19292923,1,Blood ammonia levels in liver cirrhosis: a clue for the presence of portosystemic collateral veins.,"Portal hypertension leads to the formation of portosystemic collateral veins in liver cirrhosis. The resulting shunting is responsible for the development of portosystemic encephalopathy. Although ammonia plays a certain role in determining portosystemic encephalopathy, the venous ammonia level has not been found to correlate with the presence or severity of this entity. So, it has become partially obsolete. Realizing the need for non-invasive markers mirroring the presence of esophageal varices in order to reduce the number of endoscopy screening, we came back to determine whether there was a correlation between blood ammonia concentrations and the detection of portosystemic collateral veins, also evaluating splenomegaly, hypersplenism (thrombocytopenia) and the severity of liver cirrhosis."
CD008759,0,9247444,0,Late postoperative follow-up of patients submitted to subtotal splenectomy.,"Subtotal splenectomy preserving the upper splenic pole vascularized only by the splenogastric vessels has been performed by us in 91 patients since 1984. This procedure was combined with central splenorenal shunt or portal variceal disconnection to treating schistosomatic portal hypertension (n = 67); it was combined with distal pancreatectomy to treat pancreatic cystadenoma (n = 1), and it was carried out for severe splenic trauma (n = 14), and to control severe Gaucher's disease (n = 4) and myeloid metaplasia due to myelofibrosis (n = 5). All patients are alive. In the present paper, we present the late postoperative follow up of 32 patients operated in a period that ranges from 1 to 12 years. All patients are satisfied with the operation. Increased counts of white blood cell (n = 10) and platelets (n = 7) were the only hematological alterations. Esophageal varices were present in 23 of 27 patients operated due to portal hypertension, but all of them were shorter than in the preoperative period. The ultrasound confirmed the presence of the splenic remnant (30 of 32) without significant size changes. Splenic scintigraphies were positive in 30 of 32 patients. Subtotal splenectomy seems to be a safe procedure that can be useful in portal hypertension, some metabolic and hematological diseases, and benign growth of the distal pancreas."

This is a retrospective cohort of 60 consecutive patients with schistosomiasis admitted to a university hospital in Maceió, Brazil. The patients were divided into 2 groups: patients with and without acute kidney injury (AKI) according to the RIFLE criteria. We compared the groups for differences in clinical manifestations and laboratory tests. Patients' mean age was 58 ± 16 yr, and 56.7% were female. The average length of hospital stay was 16.4 ± 12.1 days. Patients with hypertension and diabetes were 35% and 21.7% respectively. The main clinical symptoms and signs presented were ascites (86.7%), splenomegaly (80%), and hepatomegaly (63.3%). Current or previous history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding was found in 45% of patients, esophageal varices on endoscopy were present in 92%, and periportal fibrosis on ultrasound examination in 81% of patients. AKI incidence was 43.3% during hospital stay. Mean age and length of hospitalization were higher in the AKI group. Diuretic use, such as furosemide and spironolactone, ascites, and AST levels were also associated with AKI. Death occurred in 5 cases (8.5%), 4 of them in the AKI group. The classifications Child-Pugh score (CHILD) and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD), used to assess the severity and prognosis of chronic liver disease, presented higher scores among patients with AKI (CHILD: 9.5 ± 1.5 vs. 8.4 ± 1.7, P = 0.02; MELD: 19 ± 5.8 vs. 13 ± 3.9, P < 0.001). Renal dysfunction is an important feature of schistosomiasis, which is associated with significant morbidity and possible increased mortality. Further studies are necessary to establish the mechanisms through which schistosomiasis can lead to renal dysfunction."

In 25 cirrhotics with spleen enlargement and portal hypertension and in seven controls, the following parameters were determined: estimated splenic volume (ESV) from the radiographic view of the spleen, according to Blendis, Williams and Kreel (1969), specific splenic blood-flow (SSBF), total splenic blood-flow (TSBF), porto-hepatic gradient (PHG), specific splenic resistance (SSR) and total splenic resistance (TSR). Moreover, the size and extension of oesophageal varices, at oesophagoscopy, were classified according to Dagradi (1973). PHG, ESV and TSBF were increased in all subjects, SSBF was increased in two cases, SSR was increased in two cases and decreased in two cases, TSR was decreased in all cases and ESV was not correlated to the level of portal hypertension. Neither TSBF nor TSR were found to be correlated to the level of portal hypertension, as estimated by PHG or by oesophageal varices. It is concluded that, in patients with liver cirrhosis and spleen enlargement, splenomegaly is likely to be the consequence of pulp hyperplasia and not of passive congestion, and that increases in splenic blood-flow do not contribute significantly to portal hypertension."

CD008759,0,23397529,0,Advances in the evaluation and management of children with portal hypertension.,"Portal hypertension commonly accompanies advanced liver disease and gives rise to severe and life-threatening complications, including hemorrhage from esophageal varices. Diagnosis of portal hypertension in children currently relies on finding evidence of splenomegaly and the formation of portosystemic collaterals. There is a paucity of pediatric data to support the use of primary prophylaxis against variceal hemorrhage. A combination of vasoactive drug and endoscopic therapy should be used to manage variceal bleeding. Prevention of rebleeding is best achieved by endoscopic variceal ligation. Rex bypass surgery is the optimal therapy for prevention of further bleeding from portal vein thrombosis. Options to manage recurrent bleeding while on preventative therapy include surgical portosystemic shunt, Rex bypass, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS), and liver transplantation. Management of gastric varices may require injection of cyanoacrylate glue or TIPS."

We report a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the impact of clinically significant portal hypertension on survival in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) following hepatectomy. Searched data in PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library were reviewed and 11 publications were included in the meta-analysis. The inclusion criteria of clinically significant portal hypertension were esophageal varices and/or thrombocytopenia with splenomegaly. Pooled data were extracted and computed into odds ratios (ORs) for clinical outcome and hazard ratios (HRs) for overall survival. The final pooled data were composed of 2,285 patients. There were 775 patients with clinically significant portal hypertension (PHT group) and 1,510 patients without clinically significant portal hypertension (non-PHT group). Pooled proportion of mortality was 6.1% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.032-0.116) in PHT group and 2.8% (95% CI 0.014-0.054) in the non-PHT group. The pooled proportion of morbidity was 41.7% (95% CI 0.274-0.575) in PHT group and 34.7% (95% CI 0.243-0.467) in non-PHT group. Pooled data confirmed a significantly higher postoperative mortality in the PHT group, with OR 3.02 (P < 0.001). The PHT group also demonstrated significantly higher occurrence of postoperative complications (OR 1.39, P = 0.008), liver-related morbidity (OR 3.10, P < 0.00001), and liver failure (OR 2.14, P = 0.0005) compared to the non-PHT group. According to the overall survival, pooled analysis demonstrated that the PHT group demonstrated poorer survival than the non-PHT group (HR 1.48, P = 0.007). The analyses support significantly higher rates of postoperative mortality, complications, liver-related morbidity, liver failure, and poorer overall survival in PHT group compared with the non-PHT group. Surgical resection should be selected carefully with strict surgical strategy in patients with clinically significant portal hypertension when surgical resection is planned."

The possibility of torsion of the spleen is high due to the long and mobile nature of the vascular pedicle. Generally, cases are asymptomatic. Under conditions of delayed diagnosis, symptoms of splenomegaly, left portal hypertension, gastric fundal varices, and hypersplenism may present as a result of development of vascular congestion associated with chronic torsion. There are only a few cases in the literature reporting the association of wandering spleen and fundal varices.

We define ""good results"" as the complete restoration of biliary flow and normalization of bilirrubin levels. The long-term evolution of these good results can be diverse. The objective of the present work is to analyze the outcome of patients in our series in whom a favourable initial response was achieved, as well as evaluating their present situation and future perspectives. The authors present a total of 17 patients operated by Kasai's technique since 1985, that constitutes the group with good results in our series. The controls were based on general analysis, liver function and periodic ultrasound explorations. All received a standardized medical treatment consisting of vitamin supplements (A, D3, E, K) minerals (zinc, calcium, phosphate, iron) ursodexoxicolic acid, luminal,as well as close control of calorie intake. In two patients the levels of bilirrubine were progressively increased with time, stabilizing at between 5/6 mgs/100 ml, with progressive hepatic hardening, appearance of splenomegalia, indirect signs of portal hypertension and a slight deterioration of hepatic function. One received a transplant at age 12 with Quick levels below 50%. The other, aged 16, continues with an acceptable hepatic function and good quality of life under recommendation of transplant. Eleven patients with ages ranging from fourteen months to seventeen years presented slight and firm hepatomegalia, moderate portal hypertension, GOT 71 +/- 8 mg/100 ml, GPT 97 +/- 11 mg/100 ml and normal bilirrubine levels. From this group, 3 patients, all under five years of age, experienced bleeding from esophageal varices which were controlled by sclerosis and medical treatment (propanolol and isosorbide dinitrate). Recently, one three year-old patient developed a hepatocarcinoma of rapid, mortal evolution. Since then, the determination of alfa-feto protein in follow-up controls has been introduced. Four other patients of 5, 6, 14, 16, years of age are completely assymptomatic with an excellent clinical evolution. In our experience,the patients that overcome the third year after surgery without serious complications seem destined to reach puberty with a good quality of life. However, some cases show signs of hepatic fibrosis and portal hypertension, 77% in our series.

It is a consecutive case series, 17 retrospective and 21 prospective, from 1977 to 2000, admitted before and after 1990, respectively. The main clinical presentations were lymphatic, abdominal and cutaneous involvement, and fever. The alterations which disappeared more slowly were lymphadenomegaly, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and osteoarticular pain. Poor intestinal absorption, esophageal varices and splenic calcification were observed before treatment and persisted as sequelae. There was a satisfactory response to initial treatment in 56.7% of cases. Half the patients became asymptomatic in the ninth month of treatment, and 17+/-8% of cases presented with at least one symptom of the disease after 30 months of treatment. There were five deaths, and treatment failure was frequent and associated in part with the irregular use of antifungal. Treatment with ketoconazole was safe and effective. PCM is a serious systemic disease with slow evolution and high lethality, requiring treatment maintenance for a minimum of 24 months with careful and prolonged follow-up. Studies are necessary to evaluate the efficacy of different antifungals and the ideal treatment length for children with PCM."

The aim of this communication is to share our experience with 153 cases on whom upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was done over a period of 24 months at a paediatric gastroenterology unit of a tertiary care hospital of Dhaka, Bangladesh. Children who attended the department with various gastrointestinal problems are the subjects of this paper. Intravenous midazolam and 10% pharyngeal xylocain were used in majority of cases for sedating the children. The ages of the children were between 15 months to 15 years (9.41+/- 3.22 years). The positive diagnostic yield was 92 out of 153 cases (60.1%). The major indication for doing endoscopy in the present series was recurrent abdominal pain (51.6%), followed by upper gastrointestinal bleeding (28.8%). Combining histopathological findings and CLO/rapid urease tests the overall positive yield of recurrent abdominal pain was 45 out of 79 (57%). The sources of upper gastrointestinal bleeding could be identified in 79.5% cases. Esophageal varices indicating portal hypertension were found in 62.5% children who were endoscoped for unexplained splenomegaly with or without ascitis. Endoscopy has become a safe and valuable procedure in the management of upper gastrointestinal problems in children and gastric antral biopsy has increased the positive diagnostic yield of recurrent abdominal pain in the studied children."

Most of apparently idiopathic cases of splanchnic vein thrombosis are related to an increased coagulation related to a congenital or acquired defect of haemostasis. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of a new and effective treatment. Nine male and 9 female patients (range of age: 19 to 81 years) experienced a mesenteric venous thrombosis. There were 14 mesenteric vein thromboses with infarction, two transient mesenteric venous ischaemias without bowel infarction and two acute thromboses of the splanchnic veins without bowel ischaemia. A coagulopathy was detected in seven patients: oral contraception, protein C (PC) or antithrombin III (AT III) congenital deficiencies, acquired deficiency of AT III, PC and protein S (PS), polycythaemia in the post-partum period and primary myeloproliferative disorder. No coagulopathy was associated with thrombosis in eight cases: mesenteric haematoma, splenomegaly, cirrhosis, appendicectomy, cholescytectomy, chronic heart failure, treatment with beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist and digitalis, stenosis of the portal anastomosis after liver transplantation. Twelve patients required surgery: eight intestinal bowel resections with immediate anastomosis, four resections without immediate anastomosis. Only one patient underwent a second look for a repeat bowel resection. No death occurred in the early postoperative period and 17 out of 18 patients were alive after 12 years. An oral anticoagulant therapy was undertaken from two months to seven years. However, three patients suffered a recurrent thrombosis. Two of them required a long-term anticoagulation. Six patients experienced a portal hypertension and oral anticoagulants were discontinued in three of them because of bleeding oesophageal varices. Six patients were treated only by unfractionated heparin (UFH) or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) followed by oral anticoagulants. After laparotomy, two were only treated with UFH without any bowel resection, as mesenteric venous ischaemia was too extensive. These observations suggest that the choice between an appropriate medical or surgical treatment is important and must be discussed. Since 1989, the therapeutic choice has been modified by ultrasonography and contrast enhanced computed tomographic scan which confirms diagnosis, allows to follow up and check the effects of anticoagulation and to choose the time for surgery.

We have studied prospectively the progression of clinical, biochemical, cholangiographic, and hepatic histologic features in 45 patients with both primary sclerosing cholangitis and chronic ulcerative colitis to compare these variables in the 20 patients who had undergone proctocolectomy with the 25 who had not. The two groups were similar initially with regard to clinical, biochemical, cholangiographic, and hepatic histologic findings. All patients were followed for a minimum of 1 yr and overall duration of follow-up was similar in both groups (4.1 vs. 3.9 yr). Clinically, new onset of hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, esophageal varices, and ascites did not differ in patients with and without proctocolectomy. Biochemically, the serial changes in bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase, prothrombin time, and albumin were similar. Histologic progression on liver biopsy did not differ between groups, nor did changes on serial cholangiograms. Proctocolectomy also had no effect on survival. We conclude that proctocolectomy for chronic ulcerative colitis has no beneficial effect on the primary sclerosing cholangitis in patients with both diseases."

The operative mortality was 4/25. One patient had an early thrombosis. All post-operative angiography otherwise showed patent shunts. After a median observation time of 43 months, 10/20 patients included in the followup were dead. The chief cause of death was liver failure. Encephalopathy has been common although generally of minor degree. Hypersplenism, judged by thrombocyte count, was not significantly affected by the operation. Six of 21 patients have had gastrointestinal hemorrhage after the operation but no hemorrhage proved fatal. Postoperatively esophageal varices size was considerably diminished in most cases as judged by contrast x-ray. Ascites has not been a problem in this series. Postoperative angiography showed a marked and rapid reduction of portal blood flow to the liver with progressively more blood deviated through the coronary vein towards the shunt. This reduction in portal flow is a possible explanation of the high frequency of postoperative liver failure. This version of the distal spleno-renal shunt has probably no advantages over the portacaval shunt."

CD008759,0,3276151,0,Ultrasonographic findings with bleeding and nonbleeding esophageal varices.,"Real time ultrasonography was carried out in 49 cirrhotic patients within 10 days of esophagoscopy, and in 20 normal subjects. Among the cirrhotic patients, 42 had varices and 18 of these had hematemesis within 3 months of study. The varices were graded 0 to 4+ endoscopically; the diameter of the portal vein, the splenic vein, the hepatic artery, and the maximal length of the spleen were determined on ultrasound. In addition, portal collateral veins and the sudden amputation of portal vein branches in the liver were identified when present. There was a significant correlation of the diameter of the portal vein and the maximal spleen length with the magnitude of varices on endoscopy; there was no significant relationship between the splenic vein or the hepatic artery diameter. Less than half the patients with varices had sonographically demonstrated collaterals or portal vein branch amputation. A sonoscore was derived allotting one point each for enlarged portal vein (greater than 1.3 cm), enlarged spleen, collaterals or two or more amputated veins. The sonoscore correlated better with the endoscopic grade of varices than any other marker. The sonoscore among the patients with varices who bled was significantly higher (p less than 0.01) than any of the other measures. It is concluded that real time ultrasound can be used to screen for varices and to identify the need for endoscopy."

Fifty-nine patients with cirrhosis-induced hypersplenism were treated with PSE. The patients were randomly assigned into two groups: gelfoam group, which includes 32 patients using gelfoam particles as the embolic material, and BS group, which includes 27 patients using BS particles. The peripheral blood cell counts and parameters for complications associated with PSE were measured during the follow-up. The mean values of leukocyte and thrombocyte, but not hemoglobin, were significantly increased after PSE (p < 0.01) in both groups. The values of leukocyte and thrombocyte during the long-term follow-up were significantly improved in BS group than that in gelfoam group (both p < 0.01). The frequency of bleeding episodes from esophageal varices in both groups was significantly reduced after PSE (both p < 0.01), but the post-PSE bleeding episodes showed no remarkable differences between the two groups (p = 0.084). Post-embolization syndrome consisted mainly of fever, nausea and vomiting, and abdominal pain in the two groups. The incidence of grade II to III abdominal pain in BS group (82.8%, 27/33) was significantly higher than in gelfoam group (57.9%, 33/57) (p = 0.020). The mean survival time was 61.5 ± 9.1 (median 60, 1-157) months in gelfoam group and 63.4 ± 9.9 (median 52, 0-161) months in BS group, which showed no significant difference (p = 0.930). In conclusion, BS particles could be used as the embolic material in PSE. Compared to gelfoam used in PSE, BS can achieve even better efficacy in alleviating hypersplenism. It provides a long-term effect on the hematological parameters, bleeding from esophageal varices and good palliation, and improved clinical status contributing to symptomatic control."

A patent or enlarged paraumbilical vein was found in 85.6% of patients overall and 82.5% of patients with varices indicating a relatively high sensitivity. A portal vein diameter greater than or equal to 13mm was found in only 41.1% and greater than or equal to 15mm in only 20% of patients. A thrombosed portal vein and reversed portal vein flow were present in 3.4% and 5.3% of patients respectively. These signs have only been reported in the context of PHT and are felt to be specific for PHT, but both have a very low sensitivity. Portal vein velocities were highly variable suggesting that this is not a useful predictor of PHT. Splenomegaly was found in only 53.5% of patients demonstrating its poor sensitivity as a sign of PHT. Varices were found in 73.3% of patients overall, and in 100% of patients with a patent or enlarged paraumbilical vein combined with ascites. No other statistically significant correlation between varices and sonographic findings was demonstrated. We conclude that the presence of a patent or enlarged paraumbilical vein is a practical, useful and sensitive ultrasound sign to look for in the diagnosis of PHT."

Hepato-splenic volumes were serially measured by CT scan. The regenerative speed (cm3/day) of the remaining liver were significantly higher in the N group than LC and in the larger resection class. Liver functions tended to return to the initial levels behind the time of restoration of the liver volumes. The delay was partially caused by the posttransfusion hepatitis (PTH), which developed more frequently with an increase of fresh frozen plasma transfusion given. The changing pattern of splenic size was strongly regulated by the massiveness of hepatectomy. Newly developed posthepatectomy esophageal variceal ruptures were endoscopically determined in the 10% of the 129 late deaths after hepatectomies for hepatomas (1973-1987) with or without recurrences and its occurrence was found to be enhanced in the massive resection in the LC group ended with the poor regeneration of the liver and persistent postoperative splenic enlargement."

CD008759,0,6879370,0,Extrahepatic portal venous obstruction. A retrospective analysis.,Extrahepatic portal venous obstruction is a frequent cause of portal hypertension in children. In the majority it presents as gastro-intestinal haemorrhage or as incidental splenomegaly on routine medical examination. The diagnosis is suggested by the presence of oesophageal varices in a patient whose liver function is normal and can be confirmed by portal venography. A conservative approach with early intensive management of haemorrhage is advised. Surgical shunts do not reduce the frequency of haemorrhage in most patients. Splenectomy should be avoided in all instances.

We retrospectively assessed the impact of propranolol treatment on HCC occurrence in a cohort of 291 patients with compensated viral C (HCV) cirrhosis, prospectively followed and screened for HCC detection. Of the 291 patients included in the cohort, 93 patients [50 males: mean age, 59.5 ± 12 years; body mass index (BMI), 25.7 ± 4.4 kg/m(2); and platelet count, 111 ± 53 Giga/L] developed esophageal varices (OV) or had OV at inclusion and 198 patients (111 males: mean age, 55.8 ± 13 years; BMI, 25.7 ± 5 kg/m(2); platelet count, 137 ± 59 Giga/L) did not. Among patients with OV, 50 received treatment by propranolol. During a median follow-up of 54 months interquartile range (32-82), 61 patients developed an HCC. The 3- and 5-year HCC incidence was 4% and 4%, and 10% and 20% for patients treated and not treated by propranolol, respectively (Gray test, P = 0.03). In multivariate analysis, propranolol treatment was associated with a decrease risk of HCC occurrence [HR, 0.25; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.09-0.65; P = 0.004], and was the only independent predictive factor of HCC occurrence in patients with OV (HR, 0.16; CI, 0.06-0.45; P = 0.0005).

CD008759,0,12601348,0,Prospective analysis of risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with liver cirrhosis.,"Better knowledge of the risk factors associated with the appearance of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) could improve the efficacy of surveillance programs. A total of 463 patients aged 40 to 65 years with liver cirrhosis in Child-Pugh class A or B were included in a program of early diagnosis. The predictive value of different risk factors was evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression model. Thirty-eight patients developed HCC. In the multivariate analysis, 4 variables showed an independent predictive value for the development of HCC: age 55 years or older, antibody to hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV) positivity, prothrombin activity 75% or less, and platelet count less than 75 x 10(3)/mm(3). According to the contribution of each of these factors to the final model, a score ranging between 0 and 4.71 points was constructed to allow the division of patients into 2 different risk groups. The low-risk group included those with a score of 2.33 points or less (n = 270; 4 with HCC; cumulative incidence of HCC at 4 years, 2.3%), and the high-risk group included those with a score greater than 2.33 (n = 193; 34 with HCC; cumulative incidence of HCC at 4 years, 30.1%) (P =.0001). In conclusion, a simple score made up of 4 clinical and biological variables allowed us to distinguish 2 groups of cirrhotic patients at high and low risk for the development of HCC. We believe this score can be useful in establishing a subset of cirrhotic patients in whom a surveillance program for early detection of HCC could be unjustified."
CD008759,0,7959205,0,Respiratory function after injection sclerotherapy of oesophageal varices.,"Arterial oxygen tension (Pao2), carbon dioxide tension (PaCO2), and vital capacity were measured preoperatively and one day postoperatively in patients with chronic hepatic cirrhosis having elective oesophageal injection sclerotherapy under general anaesthesia. The results were compared with the same measurements made in patients with chronic cirrhosis anaesthetised and scheduled to have injection sclerotherapy under general anaesthesia but who, because of variceal obliteration, only had an oesophagogastroscopy. In the injected group PaO2 decreased by 9.3 (3.0) mm Hg (1.2 (0.4) kPa) (mean (SEM)) (p < 0.02) but in the controls did not change. The difference between the two groups was significant (p < 0.02). Vital capacity decreased by 0.39 (0.08) litres (BTPS) (p < 0.01) after injection sclerotherapy but in the controls did not change. Again the difference between the two groups was significant (p < 0.02). In the injected group there was a significant correlation between the change in PaO2 and the percentage change in vital capacity (r = 0.787, p < 0.01) but no such relation was seen in control subjects. These results suggest that oesophageal injection sclerotherapy is associated with a restrictive defect in respiratory function one day after the injection caused, possibly, by sclerosant embolising to the lung."

After a 4 year period when her myeloproliferative disease was considered to be transitional a complete transformation to myelofibrosis occurred. She was treated by splenic irradiation and later with alkylating agents in an attempt to give her symptomatic relief from massive splenomegaly. Repeated and massive haemorrhage from gastro-oesophageal varices was treated initially by percutaneous transhepatic sclerosis of the gastro-oesophageal collateral vessels. A subsequent dacron mesocaval jump graft operation was successful in preventing further haematemesis and melaena. During the last year transformation back to polycythaemia vera has occurred.

The anamnesis of the 59-year-old housewife revealed previous anemia, splenomegaly and abnormal liver function 21 years ago. Three years ago, esophageal varices were found. A tortuously distended vein was seen in the falciform ligament at the time of laparoscopy, and this finding was confirmed by angiography and ultrasonography. Esophageal varices and hypersplenism were also noted. Despite these findings, liver biopsy specimens of both lobes showed only slight fibrosis with minimal lymphocyte infiltration in some portal areas, and no evidence of cirrhosis. Patency of the umbilical vein and portal hypertension without significant histologic change of the liver, are both in keeping with the features of this disease. Dilatation of the umbilical vein seemed to be congenital and did not contribute to active blood flow of portal hypertension in this patient. In Japan, development of ""caput medusae"" in portal hypertension is rather rare, whereas esophageal varices and splenomegaly are more frequent. Venous hum is also seldom found. 14 cases of Cruveilhier-Baumgarten disease and 28 cases of Cruveilhier-Baumgarten syndrome have been reported from Japan in the literature since 1911."

A high percentage of encephalopathic disorders and nearly 50% of the patients suffering from the hemorrhage from esophageal varices were the first sign of the cirrhosis in both groups. Despite hemorrhage from esophageal varices a few patients obtained surgical help preventing recurrence of the hemorrhage.

In order to study the effects of sclerosing agents, which may escape into the systemic circulation during treatment, seven sheep were given either ethanolamine oleate (n = 4) or sodium tetradecyl sulfate (n = 3) intravenously. A control group (n = 3) was treated identically with the others except it did not receive any sclerosing agent. The study showed that both sclerosing agents caused an immediate and severe fall in total respiratory compliance and arterial oxygen tension. There was a marked trapping of platelets in the lungs, which was also reflected by a drop in platelet count in peripheral blood. The lungs from the animals receiving sclerosing agents appeared moderately to severely congested and the wet/dry weight ratio of the lungs was significantly increased compared with untreated normal lungs (p less than 0.01). Histopathological examination revealed severe damage to the alveolar membranes, intraalveolar fibrino-haemorrhagic exudate, collapse of alveolar spaces and numerous eosinophilic leukocytes in the broadened, oedematous alveolar walls. It was concluded that the sclerosing agents used in this study, ethanolamine oleate and sodium tetradecyl sulphate, cause severe lung injury if given intravenously in sheep in doses corresponding to 25-50% of what is normally used during sclerotherapy in patients. The mechanism of this action may be that of an increased microvascular permeability causing marked alveolar damage and destruction of the blood gas barrier of the lungs."

CD008759,0,18706733,0,Non-invasive (and minimally invasive) diagnosis of oesophageal varices.,"Current guidelines recommend screening all cirrhotic patients by endoscopy, to identify patients at risk of bleeding who should undergo prophylactic treatment. However, since the prevalence of varices in cirrhotic patients is variable, universal screening would imply a large number of unnecessary endoscopies and a heavy burden for endoscopy units. In addition, compliance to screening programs may be hampered by the perceived unpleasantness of endoscopy. Predicting the presence of oesophageal varices by non-invasive means might increase compliance and would permit to restrict the performance of endoscopy to those patients with a high probability of having varices. Over the years, several studies have addressed this issue by assessing the potential of biochemical, clinical and ultrasound parameters, transient elastography, CT scanning and video capsule endoscopy. The platelet count/spleen diameter ratio, CT scanning and video capsule endoscopy have shown promising performance characteristics, although none of them is equivalent to EGD. These methods are perceived by patients as preferable to endoscopy and thus might increase adherence to screening programs. Whether this will compensate for the lower sensitivity of these alternative techniques, and ultimately improve the outcomes if more patients undergo screening, is the crucial question that will have to be answered in the future."

In the present study, we compared the diagnostic and prognostic values of the noninvasive fibrosis markers in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis. A total of 219 consecutive alcoholic cirrhosis patients were included. Biochemical scores and liver stiffness (LS) were compared with hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG). For the detection of clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH; HVPG≥10 mmHg) in compensated patients, LS and LS-spleen diameter to platelet ratio score (LSPS) showed significantly better performance with area under the curves (AUCs) of 0.85 and 0.82, respectively, than aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index, FIB-4, Forns' index, Lok index, (platelet count)2/[monocyte fraction (%) × segmented neutrophil fraction (%)], and platelet count-to-spleen diameter ratio (all P<0.001). However, for the detection of high-risk varices, none of the non-invasive tests showed reliable performance (AUCs of all investigated tests < 0.70). During a median follow-up period of 42.6 months, 46 patients with decompensated cirrhosis died. Lok index (hazard ratio [HR], 1.13; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.05-1.22; P = 0.001) and FIB-4 (HR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.01-1.10; P = 0.009) were independently associated with all-cause death in decompensated patients. Among the tested noninvasive markers, only Lok index significantly improved discrimination function of MELD score in predicting overall survival. In conclusion, LS and LSPS most accurately predict CSPH in patients with compensated alcoholic cirrhosis. In the prediction of overall survival in decompensated patients, however, Lok index is an independent prognostic factor and improves the predictive performance of MELD score."

CD008759,0,19200133,1,Complete blood count reflects the degree of oesophageal varices and liver fibrosis in virus-related chronic liver disease patients.,"To optimize management of chronic liver disease (CLD), a simple and noninvasive test to determine oesophageal varices (EV) and liver fibrosis is necessary. We performed a cohort study in a single tertiary care centre in order to devise a simple index reflecting EV and liver fibrosis. We derived an index reflecting EV which resulted from portal hypertension (the first part) and evaluated the index's ability to detect liver fibrosis which resulted in portal hypertension (the second part). Five hundred fifty-six patients (the first part, n = 409, mean age = 55.4 years, EV prevalence = 34.0%; the second part, n = 147, mean age = 48.8 years, cirrhosis prevalence = 12.9%) with virus-related CLD were included. P2/MS [(platelet count [10(9)/L])(2)/(monocyte fraction [%] x segmented neutrophil fraction [%])] was derived to detect EV. The area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of P2/MS was 0.916 (95% confidence interval, 0.879-0.954) for detecting EV, and 0.905 (0.862-0.947) for detecting high-risk EV (grade >or= II or with red colour signs). P2/MS had AUROCs of 0.952 (0.904-0.999) and 0.873 (0.792-0.955) for histological cirrhosis (METAVIR F4) and significant fibrosis (METAVIR F2-F4), respectively, which were significantly greater than those of AST-to-platelet count ratio index (0.658, P < 0.001; 0.644, P = 0.003) and FIB-4 (0.776, P = 0.031; 0.707, P = 0.026). The predictive values of P2/MS were maintained at similar accuracy in subsequent validation sets. Our study suggests that P2/MS comprising only the complete blood count results is an efficient and noninvasive marker reflecting the presence of EV and the grade of liver fibrosis in patients with virus-related CLD. An independent external validation of P2/MS is required."

Further investigation revealed that there were no oesophageal varices or splenomegaly. Liver biopsy showed grade II fatty change only, with no other specific or significant pathological features. Transhepatic portography showed a raised portal pressure (20 mm/Hg) but the portal system was patent throughout. There was an abnormal leash of vessels in the caecum thought to represent a variceal plexus. This patient was diagnosed as having idiopathic colonic varices. This case is discussed together with nine other reports of idiopathic colonic varices from the published literature.

Eighty-four patients with cirrhosis underwent both TUS and endoscopic examination for esophageal varices (EVs). LEDS were assessed under the esophageal resting state and during the swallowing process. Univariate analysis indicated that spleen diameter, spleen vein diameter, portal vein diameter, LEDS and left gastric vein hepatofugal flow were significantly associated with the presence of EVs. No LEDS were detected in patients without EVs at rest or during swallowing. Of the 69 patients with EVs, LEDS could be detected in 21 cases (30.4%) in the esophageal resting state and in 58 cases (84.1%) during the swallowing process. Compared with the esophageal resting state, the swallowing action can significantly improve display of LEDS during TUS (p = 0.000), which may be beneficial for TUS detection of EVs."

CD008759,0,6693074,0,Extrahepatic biliary atresia.,"Extrahepatic biliary atresia is defined as partial or total absence of permeable bile duct between porta hepatis and the duodenum. The incidence varies from 1:8,000 to 1:10,000. Cholestasis is total and permanent. 131I Rose Bengal test and needle liver biopsy allow correct identification of 95% of cases before surgery. Before the surgical procedure described by Kasai in 1959, all patients died between 1 and 2 years of age. Through the use of different types of Kasai's procedures by experienced groups, 30 to 35% of patients are successfully operated on. In our group, 248 infants underwent surgery, 121 before 1977: 44 (36.6%) are alive at least 5 years after surgery. Growth is within normal limits in all children still alive, even in those who presented with numerous and severe episodes of cholangitis during the first two postoperative years. Portal hypertension was progressive in 23 children with splenomegaly and esophageal varices developing between 1 and 2 years of age. Five patients bled profusely between 2 and 4 years of age: portal systemic shunts were performed in 4. Surgical liver biopsies were performed in 20 children, 5 to 8 years old: cirrhosis was present in all and was micronodular in 13 and macronodular in 7. The most impressive histologic change was absence of biliary ducts or ductules. This histologic finding can be related with percutaneous transhepatic cholangiographic pictures. Despite the abnormal appearance of intrahepatic bile ducts and the constant presence of cirrhosis with portal hypertension, all 44 patients who are alive at least 5 years after surgery seem to lead almost normal lives."

CD008759,0,6333264,0,Selective variceal decompression in portal vein thrombosis.,"Thirty-two patients with congenital portal vein thrombosis have been managed for bleeding gastro-oesophageal varices. Fifteen had splenectomy and/or other therapy before referral: nine were managed by endoscopic sclerosis, four by devascularization and two by total shunt; six rebled. Seventeen had their spleen 'in situ' at referral and were evaluated for selective shunt: thirteen had distal splenorenal shunts (DSRS)--one transiently rebled despite a patent shunt and one had shunt thrombosis; four had no veins suitable for shunt, and were managed by splenectomy and devascularization, with two rebleeds. Detailed study of seven patients before, and 1 year after DSRS, showed a rise in platelet count, maintenance of hepatocyte function, portal perfusion, liver blood flow and liver size. The spleen showed a significant (P less than 0.025) reduction in size with trans-splenic decompression. We conclude that DSRS provides an excellent method for long-term control of bleeding in such patients, without alteration of liver function or haemodynamics. Patients managed by splenectomy and direct ablative procedures have a significantly (P less than 0.05) greater risk of rebleeding than patients receiving DSRS."
CD008759,0,1081379,0,Erosive hemorrhagic gastroduodenitis with fibrinolysis and low factor XIII.,"Four patients with erosive hemorrhagic gastroduodenitis were found to have high fibrinolytic activity of the gastric juice. No increase in the fibrinolytic activity could be demonstrated in the circulating blood, but the values found for fibrinogen, plasminogen and alpha2-macroglobulin were low. A high content of FDP was found in the serum. All patients had a markedly decreased content of factor XIII. Platelet count and other coagulation components were normal. These findings were interpreted as signs of local fibrinolysis in the diseased parts of the gastrointestinal canal. The bleeding stopped after oral and intravenous administration of a fibrinolytic inhibitor (AMCA Cyclokapron) and of factor XIII-containing concentrate. In bleeding from gastroduodenal ulcer and esophageal varices, no increase in gastric fibrinolytic activity was found. It is suggested that the high local fibrinolytic activity in the stomach in erosive gastritis together with the low content of factor XIII contributes substantially to the hemorrhage in this condition. These observations may lead to a revision of the treatment of such cases."

Under basal conditions the platelet count, prothrombin activity, normotest and antithrombin III were all reduced; fibrinogen was in the low, and partial thromboplastin time in the high, normal range. A significant shortening of PTT and a further reduction in the platelet count, in the normotest and in fibrinogen occurred after 30 min. On one occasion laboratory evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation was observed. After 18 h most parameters approached basal values, but the normotest remained persistently reduced. Even though a transient activation of the coagulation process, with consumption of platelets and the liver-dependent clotting factors took place after sclerotherapy in most cases, leading in one to self-limiting disseminated intravascular coagulation, haemorrhagic complications did not occur in our patients. These results suggest that injection sclerotherapy did not lead to clinically significant deterioration of coagulation even in patients with abnormal coagulative function. The observed changes appeared to be self-limiting and confined to the laboratory level in all cases."

The ideal method to diagnose portal hypertension should be accurate, noninvasive, objective, and reproducible. The study evaluated the predictive value of two non-invasive parameters for the diagnosis of esophageal varices (EV): 1-Right liver lobe diameter/serum albumin ratios (RLLD/S. albumin), and 2-Platelet count/splenic bipolar diameter ratios (Platelets count/SBPD). This study included eighty Egyptian patients with post-hepatitic cirrhosis (45 males and 35 females). They underwent laboratory ultrasono-graphic and endoscopic examinations within one week. RLLD/S. albumin and Platelets count/SBPD ratios were calculated. The results showed that EV were not detected by upper digestive endoscopy in 25%, while grade I of EV was found in 17.5%, grade II in 17.5%, grade III in 20%, & grade IV in 20%. RLLD/S. albumin concentration ratio diagnosed the varices at cut off value of 3.43 with 95% sensitivity and 80% specificity. Also, it was positively correlated with grading of E.V, when this ratio increased the grading of E.V increases and vice versa. Besides, it predicted bleeding from E.V. at cut off value of 5.096 with 63% sensitivity and 73% specificity. Platelet count/SBPD ratio predicted the presence of varices at cut off value 1847 with 95% sensitivity and 93% specificity, and negatively correlated with grading of EV, when this ratio decreased grading of E.V increase and vice versa. It also predicted bleeding from E.V. at cut off value of 4809 with 50% sensitivity and 93% specificity."

A measure of the total activity in the spleen was derived from the peak activity and the length of the spleen. In cirrhosis this was closely related to the finding of oesophageal varices thus showing the importance of a collateral circulation (which allows colloid to bypass the liver) in the increased uptake of colloid by the spleen. In eight patients with hepatosplenomegaly due to blood dyscrasia or disease involving the reticuloendothelial system, total activities in the liver and spleen were estimated from the anteroposterior colour dot scan, and both liver and spleen blood flow were measured by methods independent of reticuloendothelial cell function. The results showed that the main factor causing increased uptake of colloid by the spleen in these diseases was an increased blood flow in the spleen relative to that in the liver."

Although the AIP improved using steroid therapy, the gastric varices and splenic vein obstruction did not resolve; case 3: A 68-year-old man was diagnosed with AIP complicated by gastric varices, splenic vein obstruction, and splenomegaly. The gastric varices, splenic vein obstruction, and AIP did not improve using steroid therapy. These three cases suggest that gastric varices or splenic vein obstruction without splenomegaly may be an indication for steroid therapy in patients with AIP because the complications will likely become irreversible over time."

In 10 patients, portal diversion was performed; outcome being favorable with a follow-up of one to six years. The analysis of these cases and of the 113 previously published reports calls for the following comments: 1) In most cases, NRH is characterized by small-sized hepatocytic nodules scattered throughout the entire liver with no surrounding fibrosis; however this histological pattern may vary somewhat, with adjacent normal zones being found adjacent to typical cirrhotic fibrosis; although a precise morphometric study was not performed in our patients, obstruction of the tiny branches of intrahepatic portal veins was not observed. 2) Histological diagnosis of NRH is difficult and in most cases requires surgical biopsy specimens and specific coloration of the reticulin network. 3) NRH must be considered as a new cause of intrahepatic (sinusoidal or presinusoidal) portal hypertension and/or of chronic anicteric cholestasis. 4) A number of various conditions may be associated with NRH, the most frequent being Felty's syndrome and myeloproliferative disorders. 5) The pathogenesis of NRH remains unknown. 6) Portal diversion generally has a favorable outcome in this disease."

Gastrointestinal hemorrhage has not recurred, splenomegaly regressed, and platelet and white blood cell counts increased gradually. Neither patient developed a significant encephalopathy, and liver function tests showed no significant changes throughout the observed period. The authors considered the shunting feasible despite the relatively narrow splenic veins. In both patients the anatomic position of the splenic vein--more caudal to the posterior wall of the pancreas--facilitated its isolation. In the smaller infant, the inferior mesenteric vein was sutured to gain a satisfactory segment of splenic vein.

Etiological assessment was based on anamnesis, laboratory data, needle liver biopsy and patients of each group were divided into 3 subgroups (grade A, B, C) according to Child-Turcotte classification. A > 1.3 cm diameter of portal vein and a > 13 cm spleen size evaluated by means of real-time ultrasonography together with the occurrence of esophageal varices at endoscopy were considered as signs of portal hypertension. Our study shows that such signs are more frequent in patients affected by posthepatitic cirrhosis in comparison with those affected by alcoholic cirrhosis. If the severity of the disease was considered, at the early stage (grade A) no significant difference was reported in portal diameters while splenomegaly and esophageal varices appeared more frequent in posthepatitic cirrhosis. In grade B patients the increase of portal and spleen size proved significantly greater in posthepatitic cirrhosis whereas prevalence of esophageal varices was similar in the two groups.

CD008759,0,16435503,0,[Non-invasive diagnosis of portal hypertension in cirrhosis. Application to the primary prevention of varices].,"One of the major complications of cirrhosis is the occurrence of portal hypertension and esophageal varices. At present, universal endoscopic screening of esophageal varices is recommended in association to primary prophylaxis in patients at high risk of variceal bleeding. But this screening is invasive and could be not cost-effective. Besides, pre-primary phrophylaxis is not effective and hampared by side effects. So, non invasive diagnosis of portal hypertension might be useful. This one could depend on non invasive measurement of hepatic venous pressure gradient, but its application to screening is not well-documented and its use in treatment monitoring is debated. A second way could be non invasive diagnosis of large esophageal varices because of prognostic and economic issues. Indirect echographic markers of portal hypertension and esophageal varices (ascites, portal vein diameter > or = 13 mm, spleen length, maximal and mean velocimetry of portal vein flow, respectively < 20 cm/s and < 12 cm/s) could be useful. Among this parameters, spleen length is an independent predictive marker of esophageal varices. Besides, several direct or indirect blood markers of fibrosis have been tested. Platelet count is repeatedly a predictive marker of esophageal varices in multivariate analysis. The other predictive factors of esophageal varices could be: prothrombin time, splenomegaly, spider naevi, Child-Pugh class, bilirubinemia, platelet count/spleen diameter ratio and Fibrotest, but these data require validation. In summary, in regard to actual results, non invasive diagnosis of portal hypertension might be useful in esophageal varices screening, but the substitutes to endoscopy have limited place actually in clinical practice, and exclusive non invasive diagnosis of portal hypertension is not applicable; the only test that seems to be useful in clinical practice is conventional endoscopy awaiting the results of videocapsule."

The following parameters were compared in 51 patients with chronic liver disease (40 with cirrhosis and 11 with chronic hepatitis): portal vein flow velocity and congestion index, hepatic and splenic arteries resistance indexes (RI), modified liver vascular index (portal flow velocity/hepatic artery RI) and portal hypertension index, a new index calculated as: [(hepatic artery RI x 0.69) x (splenic artery RI x 0.87)]/portal vein flow velocity. Highest accuracy was achieved by the splenic artery RI and the portal hypertension index (both around 75%) at cut-offs, respectively, of 0.60 and 12 cm/s(-1), which appeared to be, therefore, the most favorable parameters for the clinical practice. Their use may limit the need for endoscopy to search for varices."

CD008759,0,2304591,0,[Splenectomy as therapy for esophageal varices in a myeloproliferative syndrome].,"We describe the history of a man aged 73 with a myeloproliferative syndrome and massive splenomegaly, who was admitted with bleeding oesophageal varices. After sclerotherapy and other conservative measures had failed to stop the bleeding, splenectomy was performed. Liver biopsy obtained at the time of splenectomy showed extramedullary haematopoiesis and no signs of cirrhosis. Six weeks after the operation no varices were present any more. Studies of the pathogenesis of portal hypertension in splenomegaly of different causes show the importance of the increased splenic blood flow as one of the main contributory causes to this specific type of portal hypertension. Therefore this type of portal hypertension can probably be cured by splenectomy, as we saw in our patient and as has been described in several case reports."

CD008759,0,11476922,0,Noninvasive grading of the severity of portal hypertension in cirrhotic patients by echo-color-Doppler.,"The possibility of estimating portal hypertension combining splenic Doppler pulsatility index (PI), which has been shown strictly to be related to portal resistance, and portal blood flow (PBF) was evaluated. Hepatic venous pressure gradient, and splanchnic Doppler parameters were measured in 40 cirrhotic patients. A formula to assess the severity of portal hypertension from Doppler parameters was calculated in a training group of 19 patients, and then this formula was tested to prospectively predict the degree of portal pressure in 21 further patients. In the training group, the regression of portal resistance over splenic PI was calculated and individual values of estimated portal resistance were obtained for every patient of the test group. From them and from observed values of PBF, an estimated value of portal pressure was calculated. The following formula was obtained [(0.066*splenic PI -0.044)*PBF]. In the second group, predicted and observed portal pressure were well correlated (r = 0.71, p = .0003). A good accuracy for the prediction of mild or severe portal hypertension was obtained."
CD008759,0,21040236,0,The optimal cut-off for predicting large oesophageal varices using transient elastography is disease specific.,"The diagnosis of cirrhosis requires screening for oesophageal varices by upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. In many countries, serological tests and elastography are replacing liver biopsy for diagnosing cirrhosis. The aims of this study were to see whether there was an optimal cut-off of liver stiffness that could predict the presence of large (>F2) oesophageal varices and whether this was disease specific. A total of two hundred and twenty-two patients with all cause cirrhosis (Child class A) were screened, and 211 had successful elastography and are included in the analysis. Of the patients studied, one hundred and thirty-two patients had no or small F1 varices and 79 had large varices. Liver stiffness of 19.8 kPa had a negative predictive value of 91% and a positive predictive value of 55% with an area under the curve (AUC) on receiver operating characteristics (ROC) of 0.73 in differentiating between small and large varices. Seven patients with large varices would have been incorrectly classified. In the 157 patients with hepatitis C as the aetiology of cirrhosis, the negative predictive value was 98% and only one patient was misclassified. Liver stiffness was superior in diagnostic accuracy to platelet count in all patients. A liver stiffness of >19.8 kPa could be utilized as a cut-off for endoscopy and beta blocker utilization, particularly in patients with hepatitis C."
CD008759,0,10434755,0,[A case of progressive systemic sclerosis complicated by idiopathic portal hypertension with severe anemia].,"A 44-year-old woman had been diagnosed with progressive systemic sclerosis (PSS) at the age of 39 years old and mild pancytopenia was noted at that time. At the age of 41 years symptoms of dry mouth appeared. In April 1997, anemia was in progress (Hb 5.8 g/dl) and severe esophageal varices were found by gastrointestinal fiber scope, and massive splenomegaly by abdominal CT. Serological examination was negative for hepatitis virus and for anti-mitochondrial antibody. In addition, Indocyanine Green test was normal and typical findings of liver cirrhosis were not demonstrated by CT scan. Also, the bone marrow result was normal. Therefore hypersplenism with idiopathic portal hypertension (IPH) was suggested and the patient was referred for splenectomy with the aim of improving the pancytopenia. The weight of the spleen was 2100 g and the pressure of the portal vein was measured at 390 mm H2O. The diagnosis of IPH was determined because pathologically there were no findings for liver cirrhosis. After splenectomy, pancytopenia was remarkably improved (Hb 9.6 g/dl). Consequently, this case was diagnosed as IPH complicated with PSS and Sjögren syndrome."
CD008759,0,15889562,0,The correlation between cytopenia and esophageal varices in patients with liver cirrhosis.,"This retrospective study analysed the case records of 200 patients in the Department of Gastroenterology, Singapore General Hospital from February 2000 to January 2001 who had liver cirrhosis and underwent gastroscopy for the detection of varices. The aim of this study was to determine any relationship between leucopenia, thrombocytopenia and the occurrence of esophageal varices in a cirrhotic population. Our results showed that the diagnostic yield of varices grade 2 and 3 was 6.3% if platelet count was > 150,000/mm3, 25% if platelet count was 100,000 to 150,000/mm3, 38.9% if platelet count was 50,000-99,000/mm3 and 100% if platelet count was <50,000/mm3. Similarly, the diagnostic yield of varices grade 2 and 3 was 19.4% if total white count was > 4,000/mm3, 66.7% if total white count was 3,000- 4,000/mm3 and 94.8% if total white count was < 3,000/mm5. We conclude that thrombocytopenia and leucopenia can be used to stratify risk for occurrence of esophageal varices in cirrhotic patients and gastroscopy will have a high yield for varices when platelet count is < 150,000/mm3 or total white is < 4,000/mm."

Celiac angiography showed normally opacified splenic artery and vein and a markedly enlarged spleen with large avascular zones. Splenic infarction was associated with the spontaneous disappearance of a syndrome of hypersplenism. The spleen was surgically removed. Histological examination showed multiple thromboses of the small arterial and venous vessels. The cause of this infarct remained unclear.

CD008759,0,11172334,0,Which patients with cirrhosis should undergo endoscopic screening for esophageal varices detection?,"Our aims were to develop a noninvasive predictive tool to identify cirrhotic patients with esophageal varices and to evaluate whether portal Doppler ultrasonographic parameters may improve the value of other predictors. One hundred forty-three consecutive compensated cirrhotic patients underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. Fourteen clinical, biochemical, ultrasonographic, and Doppler ultrasonographic parameters of each patient were also recorded. Esophageal varices were detected in 63 of the 143 patients examined (44%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 36.2-52.6). Medium and large esophageal varices were observed in 28 subjects (44%; 95% CI 31.4-58.4). Using stepwise logistic regression, presence of esophageal varices was independently predicted by prothrombin activity less than 70% (odds ratio [OR]: 5.83; 95% CI: 2.6-12.8), ultrasonographic portal vein diameter greater than 13 mm (OR: 2.92; 95% CI: 1.3-6.4), and platelet count less than 100 x 10(9)/L (OR: 2.83; 95% CI: 1.27-6.28). Variables included in the model were used to generate a simple incremental rule to evaluate each individual patient. The discriminating ability of the prediction rule was relevant (area under the curve: 0.80) and did not change by replacing ultrasonographic portal vein diameter with congestion index of portal vein. We concluded that compensated cirrhotic patients should be screened by upper gastrointestinal endoscopy when prothrombin activity less than 70%, platelet count less than 100 x 10(9)/L, and ultrasonographic portal vein diameter greater than 13 mm are observed, whereas those without any of these predictors should not undergo endoscopy. The contribution provided by portal Doppler ultrasonographic parameters does not appear of practical utility."

CD008759,0,6601749,0,[Emergency endoscopy in patients with liver cirrhosis].,"A report is given about emergency endoscopy in 389 patients because of bleeding from the upper gastrointestinal tract; 60 of these patients had cirrhosis of the liver as confirmed by biopsy. In the total group 17.4% were found to have bleeding from esophagus varices, in the cirrhotic group the incidence was 53%. Erosive lesions of the stomach came second in incidence, accounting for 27% of the cases in the latter group. In 60% of patients with cirrhosis, who had had acute bleeding, esophageal varices were present in abundance, whereas only 27% of patients without bleeding did have such excessive formation of varices. Thrombotest and thrombocyte count were equal in both groups. In 50% of 133 patients with cirrhosis of the liver without acute bleeding complications, a second potential source of bleeding beside esophageal varices could be detected. This underlines the importance of emergency endoscopy in patients with cirrhosis of the liver suffering from acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding."
CD008759,0,22440250,0,Relationship between elevation of glycated albumin to glycated hemoglobin ratio in patients with a high bleeding risk of esophageal varices.,"Variceal hemorrhaging due to portal hypertension is a severe complication of liver cirrhosis. Although several biomarkers have been reported as predictors of the presence of varices, it is still difficult to assess the risk of variceal bleeding without esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). The ratio of glycated albumin (GA) to glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was reported to increase with the progression of liver fibrosis. The aim of the study was to investigate whether the GA/HbA1c ratio is related to the severity and bleeding-risk of the varices."
