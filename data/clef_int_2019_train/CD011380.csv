CD011380,0,20220184,0,Oral ivermectin versus malathion lotion for difficult-to-treat head lice.,"Head-lice infestation is prevalent worldwide, especially in children 3 to 11 years old. Topical insecticides (i.e., pyrethroids and malathion) used as a lotion, applied twice at an interval of 7 to 11 days, are typically used for treatment. Resistance of lice to insecticides, particularly pyrethroids, results in treatment failure. The efficacy of alternative agents is controversial."
CD011380,0,22798972,0,"A Comprehensive Review of Clocortolone Pivalate 0.1% Cream: Structural Development, Formulation Characteristics, and Studies Supporting Treatment of Corticosteroid-responsive Dermatoses.","Clocortolone pivalate is a mid-potency topical corticosteroid available as a 0.1% emollient cream approved by the United States Food and Drug Aministration for use in the treatment of corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses. The vehicle is formulated for application to a variety of corticosteroid-responsive skin disorders, including those with inflamed and fissured skin, such as eczematous dermatoses. Hence, the potency of the formulation and its vehicle characteristics are important when treating disorders, such as atopic dermatitis and other eczematous dermatoses, which are prone to cutaneous irritation and skin sensitivity to exogenously applied agents. As both localized and diffuse eczematous dermatoses and seborrheic dermatitis are common in pediatric patients (including infants) as well as in adults, the fact that clocortolone pivalate 0.1% cream has no age restriction related to its use according to United States Food and Drug Aministration-approved product labeling is important to recognize. The chemical structure of clocortolone pivalate is a unique design that provides high lipid solubility. Highly lipophilic topical corticosteroids exhibit augmented penetration through the stratum corneum, which provides higher epidermal concentrations. It has been reported that the structural characteristics of this molecule enhance its potency without increasing the potential for topical corticosteroid-related adverse effects. Clocortolone pivalate 0.1% cream has been studied in randomized, controlled trials of patients with atopic dermatitis and other eczematous dermatoses, psoriasis vulgaris, contact dermatitis, and seborrheic dermatitis. It has been shown to be more effective as monotherapy in the treatment of these corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses than the vehicle. Its efficacy and safety in pediatric patients and patients with facial dermatoses have also been demonstrated. Patients using clocortolone pivalate 0.1% topical cream in clinical trials had a low rate of adverse events, which were primarily minor application-site reactions. Systemic reactions related to the drug were not observed in these trials. Clinical studies of patients with corticosteroid-responsive dermatological conditions have found that clocortolone pivalate 0.1% cream is an effective class 4 topical corticosteroid with a favorable safety profile."
CD011380,0,8560510,0,Skin diseases of children in Mali: a public health problem.,"In order to estimate the importance as a public health problem of skin diseases, we investigated the prevalence and severity of skin diseases in a representative sample of children in Mali. 1817 children were randomly selected in 30 clusters by probability-proportional-to-size sampling in Koulikoro region. The mean prevalence (+/- 2 SD) of skin diseases was 34 +/- 4%. The most frequent dermatoses were pyoderma (12.3 +/- 1.6%), tinea capitis (9.5 +/- 2.5%), pediculosis capitis (4.7 +/- 1.4%), scabies (4.3 +/- 1.5%), and molluscum contagiosum (3.6 +/- 1%). The most troublesome dermatoses were scabies and severe pyoderma. Pyoderma was the only dermatosis associated with poor individual or household hygiene. Public health services were little used by the population for skin diseases, probably because of the lack of an adequate response by the services and the high cost of treatment. The high prevalence and the severity of many of the lesions, and the discomfort caused, make pyoderma and scabies a significant public health problem in Mali."
CD011380,0,6339288,0,Evaluation of halometasone ointment in the treatment of paediatric patients with chronic eczematous dermatoses.,"Fifty children suffering from non-infected chronic eczematous dermatoses were treated with an ointment containing 0.05% halometasone, a new high potency trihalogenated synthetic corticosteroid. Halometasone ointment does not contain parabens or perfumes. The trial population consisted of patients (under 1 to 16 years old) with non-infected chronic nummular dermatitis, seborrhoeic dermatitis, atopic dermatitis and contact dermatitis. Halometasone ointment yielded very satisfactory therapeutic results and exhibited an excellent tolerability. It produced 'good' or 'very good' results in 82% of the patients and gave an overall cure rate of 76%. The number of patients obtaining an early cure, i.e. in less than 30 days, was thirty-six (72%). An early onset of therapeutic effect, i.e. within 6 days of starting the treatment, was reported in 77.1% of the patients. All the children (including eighteen infants) tolerated halometasone ointment well and no adverse effects, either due to local skin intolerability or the transcutaneous systemic absorption of the corticoid, were observed in this trial, nor were any instances of skin atrophy reported. Cosmetic acceptability and ease of application were considered 'good' in forty-nine (98%) patients."

CD011380,0,12926604,0,Prevalence and treatment of Pediculus humanus capitis with 1% permethrin and 0.4% d-phenothrin in Turkey.,"Pediculosis humanus capitis (head lice) is an important public health problem among school children. In our study, 20,612 schoolchildren (10,367 boys, 10,245 girls) were examined for Pediculus humanus capitis in 36 elementary schools between December 1996 and February 1998 in Ankara, Turkey. The prevalence of pediculosis capitis infestation was found to be 3.4% (701/20,612). Of these, 382 students were treated with application of 1% permethrin cream rinse, and 184 students with 0.4% d-phenothrin shampoo. On day 14 of the controlled trial, the success rates were 93.7% in the 1% permethrin cream rinse group and 75.5% in the 0.4% d-phenothrin shampoo group. The 1% permethrin cream rinse was also significantly more active in pediculicidal efficacy when compared to the 0.4% d-phenothrin shampoo (p<0.001). As a result, these findings demonstrate that pediculosis capitis still remains a widespread health problem."
CD011380,0,8205601,0,"Synergized pyrethrin mousse, a new approach to head lice eradication: efficacy in field and laboratory studies.","The purpose of this study was to evaluate the pediculicidal and ovicidal efficacy of a new, single-application formulation of synergized natural pyrethrins (presented in an aerosol mousse form) compared with an established, effective formulation based on permethrin (in a creme rinse form). The trial was a single-blind, comparative, randomized, parallel-group study. Children between the ages 7 and 15 years and adults with active head lice infections, identified by the presence of live lice, were enrolled from a school and a children's home in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Prevalence of infection ranged from 75% to 100% in the two study centers. The field study confirmed laboratory findings showing pyrethrin mousse to be effective at killing both lice and their eggs with a single 10-minute application. Of 52 patients identified with lice, 42 were treated with pyrethrin mousse and 10 with permethrin creme rinse. In each case, a sample of viable louse eggs was taken from the patients' hair before and after treatment. The eggs were then incubated to assess ovicidal activity. After treatment, the patients were examined for lice on alternate days until day 8 and then again on day 14. None of the patients in either group was found to have lice up to 2 days after treatment. One patient was found to have two moribund hatchlings on day 4. By day 6, when any eggs still present on the scalp would be expected to hatch, 19 pyrethrin mousse-treated patients were available for assessment. Two patients had been reinfected from contacts.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
CD011380,0,22592706,0,Interventions for chronic blepharitis.,"Blepharitis, an inflammatory condition associated with itchiness, redness, flaking, and crusting of the eyelids, is a common eye condition that affects both children and adults. It is common in all ethnic groups and across all ages. Although infrequent, blepharitis can lead to permanent alterations to the eyelid margin or vision loss from superficial keratopathy (abnormality of the cornea), corneal neovascularization, and ulceration. Most importantly, blepharitis frequently causes significant ocular symptoms such as burning sensation, irritation, tearing, and red eyes as well as visual problems such as photophobia and blurred vision. The exact etiopathogenesis is unknown, but suspected to be multifactorial, including chronic low-grade infections of the ocular surface with bacteria, infestations with certain parasites such as demodex, and inflammatory skin conditions such as atopy and seborrhea. Blepharitis can be categorized in several different ways. First, categorization is based on the length of disease process: acute or chronic blepharitis. Second, categorization is based on the anatomical location of disease: anterior, or front of the eye (e.g. staphylococcal and seborrheic blepharitis), and posterior, or back of the eye (e.g. meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD)). This review focuses on chronic blepharitis and stratifies anterior and posterior blepharitis."

The purpose of this investigation was to confirm the activity of tocopheryl acetate in a clinical setting in comparison with a standard widely used preparation.
CD011380,0,16703782,0,Effective treatment of head louse with pediculicides.,"Of the pediculicides on the market, most are not 100% ovicidal and don't have a residual activity of more than 2 days. Therefore, at least 2 treatments are necessary to control the entire louse population. In order for a pediculicide to be effective it should kill all active stages of the louse after a single treatment. Otherwise remaining lice will continue laying eggs and the following treatments will not be fully effective, at least against the eggs. However, there is no general consensus as to when the second treatment should be conducted. Taking into consideration that head louse eggs hatch between 5 to 11 days, it is suggested that a second treatment should be administered 10 days after the beginning of the treatment. This might also explain why most of the clinical trials that were conducted by treating the patients twice with an interval of 6, 7, or 8 days showed a poor efficacy, and clinical trials where the pediculicide was applied with an interval of 10 days showed an efficacy level of more than 90%."

CD011380,0,16650232,0,Albendazole: single or combination therapy with permethrin against pediculosis capitis.,"Pediculosis capitis is a worldwide problem and a growing concern because of resistance to pediculicides. In the present study, we investigated whether albendazole could be used in the treatment of pediculosis capitis in combination with 1% permethrin or alone. A total of 150 children were randomly divided to five groups of 30 each. Group 1 got albendazole in a single dose (400 mg), group 2 got albendazole at 400 mg for 3 days, group 3 was given 1% permethrin, group 4 took 1% permethrin and albendazole in a single dose (400 mg), and group 5 got 1% permethrin and albendazole in a dose of 400 mg for 3 days. Groups given albendazole were also given another 400 mg dose of albendazole after 1 week. The success rate of treatment at the 2-week follow-up for all groups was 61.5%, 66.6%, 80.0%, 84.6%, and 82.1%, respectively. No statistically significant difference was found between the groups. The results of this study suggest that albendazole is effective against pediculosis capitis and there is no synergistic effect between albendazole and 1% permethrin."

Spinosad is a natural mixture of the pediculicidal tetracyclic macrolides spinosyn A and spinosyn D. Spinosad 0.9% mainly interferes with nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in insects, thereby producing neuronal excitation that results in paralysis of lice from neuromuscular fatigue after extended periods of hyperexcitation. Spinosad 0.9% kills both permethrin-susceptible and permethrin-resistant populations of lice. It is also ovicidal, killing both eggs (nits) and lice. Systemic absorption was not detectable after a single topical application of spinosad 1.8% for 10 minutes in children. In randomized, evaluator-blind, multicenter clinical trials, topical spinosad 0.9% without nit combing was significantly more effective than permethrin 1% with nit combing in the eradication of head lice assessed 14 days after one or two treatments. The majority of subjects treated with spinosad 0.9% without nit combing required only a single treatment to eradicate head lice, while the majority of those treated with permethrin 1% with nit combing required two treatments.

The aim of the study is to compare the efficacy of sertaconazole 2% cream with hydrocortisone 1% cream in the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis. In total, 138 patients suffering from seborrheic dermatitis were studied. Sixty-nine patients received local sertoconazole 2% cream and they were recommended to use the cream twice a day and for 4 weeks. To create a control group, 69 patients received hydrocortisone 1% cream twice a day for four weeks. At the time of referral, and at 2 and 4 weeks after their first visit, the patients were examined by a dermatologist to check the improvement of clinical symptoms. The mean age of patients was 36.45 +/- 13.23. The highest level of satisfaction (85.1%) was observed 28 days after sertaconazole consumption: 76.9% was recorded for the hydrocortisone group. No relapse of the disease one month after stopping treatment was observed in either the sertaconazole 2% group or the hydrocortisone 1% group.

CD011380,0,20199404,0,The clinical trials supporting benzyl alcohol lotion 5% (Ulesfia): a safe and effective topical treatment for head lice (pediculosis humanus capitis).,"Benzyl alcohol lotion 5% (BAL 5%) is a non-neurotoxic topical head lice treatment that is safe and effective in children as young as 6 months of age. The safety and efficacy of this pediculicide has been studied in 695 (confirm number) subjects in all phases of clinical development. Scanning electron micrographs (SEM) demonstrated that the active agent appears to stun the breathing spiracles open, enabling the vehicle to penetrate the respiratory mechanism (spiracles), therefore asphyxiating the lice. Initial phase II trials compared this novel product to RID using identical volumes of treatment (4 oz/application) and yielding, almost, identical efficacy. This outcome pointed to the significant importance of completely saturating the hair with the product in order to achieve maximum treatment success. A second phase II trial, which allowed the use of sufficient product to saturate the hair, resulted in 100% efficacy after both 10 and 30 minute treatments. A third phase II trial verified an effective dose. Phase III trials compared BAL 5% to vehicle placebo for two 10-minute applications. It proved to be safe and effective (p < 0.001) for treatment of head lice and is the first FDA-approved non-neurotoxic lice treatment, now available in the United States as Ulesfia lotion."

The subjects, with a mean age of 9 years, had long-standing lice infestations and at least 20 viable ova. The subjects were treated with the test preparation, which was allowed to remain on the hair for 12 hours. Ovicidal and pediculicidal efficacy for the malathion lotion was significant; overall clinical evaluation by the investigators showed a significant number of moderate to marked therapeutic responses to malathion lotion. Only one adverse reaction (in the malathion lotion group) was reported, the stinging of pyodermal lesions in reaction to the alcoholic vehicle. Other concomitant scalp diseases were unchanged or improved at the end of the study."

However, the presence of this bacterium has recently been detected in the head lice of homeless individuals and Nepalese slum children. Previous studies have reported the isolation of Acinetobacter baumannii from the body lice of homeless individuals. An epidemiological survey including 74 schools was conducted between 2008 and 2009 in Paris. After a first visual examination, the hair of children with suspected pediculosis was combed with a fine-tooth comb to collect live adult head lice. Molecular studies were performed on randomly selected DNA samples to detect B. quintana and A. baumannii by specific quantitative real-time PCR. Among a collection of 288 DNA samples, B. quintana was not detected, but A. baumannii was detected in 95 DNA samples (33%). Further study is needed to determine the significance of the finding of A. baumannii in head lice."
CD011380,0,7684080,0,A comparative study of seven pediculicides and their packaged nit removal combs.,"The incidence of pediculosis infestation is greater than that for all childhood communicable diseases combined. Each year approximately 6 to 12 million persons become infested, resulting in an estimated cost of $367 million to manage the problem. Pediatric health care providers are often confused regarding proper management of head lice because of the multitude of manufacturer claims in the competitive advertising market. This comparative study was designed to evaluate the combined efficacy of seven pediculicidal agents with their supplied nit removal combs in the treatment of head lice. A sample of children (n = 223) was studied from 4271 children screened at various elementary schools throughout Florida. The results of this study can assist school health care providers and pediatric nurse practitioners in identifying the most effective nit removal comb and those children at risk for head lice infestations."

A total of 860 children, 474 (55.1%) boys and 386 (44.9%) girls, with ages ranged from 6-13 years were critically examined. They were randomly selected from two schoolchildren (one for boys and one for girls) in Jazan Province. The children or their parents were subjected to questionnaire and physical examination by visual inspections of scalp and hair for the presence of adult lice, nymphs, and/or eggs (nits). A total of 114 children (13.3%) were infested with head lice, 73 (18.9%) girls and 41 (8.6%) boys. The highest infestation rate was recorded in rural area (20.5%). Pediculosis had a negative association with father's education level and frequency of hair washing (p > 0.01). The results indicated that rural residence, sex, long hair, age- group 6- < 8 years old, positive history of previous infestation, sharing of beds and combs, uneducated mother and family overcrowding might be the risk factors for the head lice infestation."
CD011380,0,25223568,0,Treatment of pediculosis capitis: a critical appraisal of the current literature.,"Pediculosis capitis is the most common ectoparasitic disease in children in industrialized countries and extremely common in resource-poor communities of the developing world. The extensive use of pediculicides with a neurotoxic mode of action has led to the development and spread of resistant head lice populations all over the world. This triggered the development of compounds with other modes of action. The current literature on treatment approaches of head lice infestation was searched, and published randomized controlled trials were critically analyzed. The following compounds/family of compounds were identified: spinosad, a novel compound with a new neurotoxic mode of action, isopropyl myristate, 1,2-octanediol, ivermectin, plant-based products, and dimeticones. The efficacy and safety of these compounds are reviewed and recommendations for the treatment of pediculosis capitis in individuals as well as the interruption of ongoing epidemics are provided."

We designed a randomized, controlled, parallel group trial involving 100 participants with active head louse infestation to investigate the activity of a coconut and anise spray and to see whether permethrin lotion is still effective, using two applications of product 9 days apart. The spray was significantly more successful (41/50, 82.0%) cures compared with permethrin (21/50, 42.0%; p < 0.0001, difference 40.0%, 95% confidence interval of 22.5% to 57.5%). Per-protocol success was 83.3% and 44.7%, respectively. Thirty-three people reported irritant reactions following alcohol contact with excoriated skin. We concluded that, although permethrin lotion is still effective for some people, the coconut and anise spray can be a significantly more effective alternative treatment."
